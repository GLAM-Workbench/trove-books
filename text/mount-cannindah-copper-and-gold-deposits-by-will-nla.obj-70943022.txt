REPORT ON MOUNT CANNINDAH COPPER AND OOLD
DEPOSITS, BY WILLIAM H. RANDS, ASSISTANT
GOVERNMENT GEOLOGIST.
Mount Cannindah ia situated near the head of Cabbage-tree
Creek, which is a branch of Splinter Creek, on the Dawes Range,
about ien and a-half miles due north of Cannindah Head Station in
the Burnett district. It is, according to the two-mile lithograph
(Sheet No. 8, Burnett District), about six miles west of the point
where the Burnett Range branches off from the Dawes Range. It
will be about thirty-two miles distant from the nearest point on the
Bundaberg-Gladstone Railway, now in course of construction.
Between Cannindah Head Station and the mines the country is
of a gently undulating character, until a point about two miles from
the field is reached, when the road traverses a steep spur from the
Dawes Range, the ascent of which tested well the stamina of the
horses, and the descent had to be made with wheels locked, and a tree
tied on behind the buggy to act as a break. Another road was being
cleared, which will cut off the worst part of this spur.
Mount Cannindah is not a mountain in the ordinary sense of the
term. The workings are situated on small spurs running from a large
semi-circular spur from the Dawes Range. This spur forms a basin-
shaped depression on the range.
A considerable area, in fact, as is shown on the sixteen-mile
geological map of the colony, the greater portion of the Burnett
district, is occupied by rocks belonging to the ? Gympie Beds?
{F ermo-carboniferous). In the neighbourhood of Caunindah Head
Station the rocks consist of sandstone, grits, shales, and limestone, in
which there is a layer of interbedded basalt. In the vicinity of the
workings, hai?dened shales appear to be the predominant rocks, but
beds of limestone, sandstone, &c., also occur.
Basalt is met with on the top of the range north of Mount Can-
nindah, from which point a magnificent view of the country towards
Milton and the tableland in the Port Curtis district ia obtainable.
Conical-shaped hills of basalt also occur nearer to the workings on the
northern side of Cabbage-tree Creek. These are hills, and
the basalt in this case probably overlies the ? Gympie Beds.?
A map of ihe blocks that have been taken up, showing the posi-
tion of the workings, by Mr. J. B. Eitzgerald, Mining Surveyor, is
attached to this Report.
Messrs. Burns and Lynch were the original prospectors of the
place, and on and off they have been working on Cabbage-tree
Creek for alluvial gold for the past seven years. When it was first
discovered some very good patches of alluvial gold were found, and
for the first six months or so there were as many as sixty men on the
field who made fair wages; but since that time, with the exception of
two or three fossickcrs now and again, Messrs. Burns and Lynch
have been the only men there, and they have made but a bare subsis-
tence. Cabbage-tree Creek has been worked for alluvial gold from


the camp, near the Mount Cannindah Blocks, down to a little below
the Apple-tree Block (see map). It is impossible to get any estimate
of the quantity of alluvial gold obtained.
Mr. Gustav Hirsch, in consequence of specimens brought down
to him, visited the place for the first time about six months ago, and
since that time he has been prospecting the neighbourhood, with the
result that he has found deposits of rich copper ores, and also several
auriferous leaders.
Altogether there are about fifteen men prospecting and mining
for Mr. Hirsch, and there is a population of from forty to fifty men at
the place.
The deposits of copper ore are in large brecciated dykes running
through the slates, which crop out very prominently at the surface.
These dykes are to a great extent made up of an impure kaolin ; they
are now so much altered that it is impossible to conjecture what the
original nature of the rock was of which they were composed. On
prospecting along the outcrop of these dykes, green stains of carbonate
of copper were seen, which on being followed down led to the
discovery of the deposits of copper ore about to be described.
THE MOUNT CANNINDAH CLAIM.
This is situated to the north-west of the area shown on the map,
and comprises Blocks Nos. 4 and 5, of ten acres each. The dyke
here is running in a north and south direction, and is about 40
yards in width. A trench has been driven through this in a direction
west-south-west. This cutting for the first 40 feet was in
kaolinized rock, mixed with angular fragments of shale, then for 9
feet 0 inches through some rich copper ore, and then for 9 feet
to the end of the cutting the dyke contains copper stains.
The rich copper ore, which is cuprite (the red oxide of copper),
occurs in bunches or pockets in the dyke. About six tons of this
high-grade ore has been taken from this cutting, and sent away for
treatment.
Where the rich copper ore has been taken out, as far as could be
seen in the cutting, there only remains around it the dyke rock, with
blue and green carbonate of copper stains, and here and there small
detached fragments of the oxide of copper.
I took away a sample, about 8 lb. in weight, from a heap of what
are called ? seconds,? ore not considered rich enough to cart away by
dray, which has been assayed by Mr. J. Brownlie Henderson, the
Government Analyst, who has given mo the following returns; ?Gold,
3 dwt. 20 gr. per ton of ore; silver, 2 oz. 6 dwt. 19 gr. per ton of
ore; copper, B?3 per cent.
Twelve feet south of the end of the cutting a shaft has been sunk
to a depth of 12 feet. This is known as the ? Gold Shaft.? The
shaft is in the felspathic rock, in which there are irregular silicious
iron-straiued veins and bunches. On washing stone taken from here
I obtained prospects of fine gold. Mr. Hirsch informs me that he
has assayed a number of samples taken indiscriminately from the
shaft, and that they give an average of 1 oz. 15 dwt. 12 gr. of gold
per ton, and 20 oz. 0 dwt. 15 gr. of silver per ton.


A sample taken by myself, and assayed by Mr. Henderson,
yielded at the rate of 12 dwt. 1 gr. of gold per ton, and 10 oz. 2 dwt.
6 gr. of silver per ton. .
There is no regular gold-bearing deposit, and it is highly probable
that most of the gold occurs in the iron-stained silicious material.
What is called the lower trench is situated 135 feet to the south-
south-west of this shaft. This cutting has been driven 35 feet in
length in a northerly direction.
Ou the east side of the cutting there is a bunch of about
18 inches in width of red and black oxide of copper, with specks
of native copper; next to this there is 4 feet of the brecciated
dyke, containing blue and green carbonates of copper; then 2 feet
8 inches of a decomposed felspathic shale containing little or no
copper ore; and lastly, ou the western side of the trench, there is a
silicious ore containing green and blue carbonates of copper. This
cutting is about 10 feet deep in the deepest part. Here, again, the
rich oxide ore is in a bunch. About ten tons have been sent away for
treatment from this place.
Samples of ? seconds ? taken by myself, and assayed by Mr.
Henderson, yielded at the rate of 3 dwt. 20 gr. of gold per ton,
16 dwt. 18 gr. of silver per ton, and 755 per cent, of copper.
About 25 feet east of this cutting the surface soil has
been removed and disclosed similar rock, impregnated with the car-
bonates of copper. No work has been done on this at present, but as
far as could be seen there was about 12 feet in width of this
copper-stained rock.
A similar dyke, which has not been prospected, occurs in Block A,
immediately east of the Mount Cannindah Blocks.
THE MARSHALL BLOCK.
The Marshall Block is thirty acres in extent; it is situated about
three-quarters of a mile south-west of the Mount Cannindah Blocks,
on a spur from the semi-circular range.
A dyke in this block runs north-east and south-west. Only a
small hole has been sunk here, and there is little to be seen. As in
the Mount Cannindah Claim, strings and stains of the carbonates of
copper ore are running through a felspathic rock. Mr. Hirsch
informed me that H tons of ore were sent away from here, which he
estimates will yield about 20 per cent, of copper. Close to this there
is a silicious rock, highly impregnated with oxide of iron,
A trench has been dug higher up the spur, about 150 yards
south-west of this. Here, again, the copper stains are in a felspathic
dyke, running in a north-east and south-west direction. In parts
where the rock is not quite so much decomposed, it appears fo be
composed of felspar and hornblende, and w r as probably a diorite. No
rich copper ore has been found in this trench.
THE MONUMENT BLOCK.'
This block is sixty acres in extent, and it is situated immediately
south-west of the Marshall Block. The block is named from a large
rock standing out like a monument from one of these dykes, running
in a nearlv north and south direction,


The lower working on the Monument Lease is an open trench or
quarry,' driven into the hill for a distance of 25 feet, which is
about 12 feet deep at its farthest point. On the southern side of
the trench there is a large pocket, or bunch, of red and black copper
oxide (very rich indeed), and near the furthest end of trench a vein
of oxide of copper occurs running east and west, but as it goes down
in the cutting, the copper ore runs out, and an iron-stained silicious
vein takes its place. Underneath the large pocket of ore on the
southern side of the trench there is the soft decomposed felspathic
rock containing only a few copper stains. Prospects of gold are
obtained on washing the dyke rock ?? gossan,? as it is termed here.
Eight tons of copper ore have been sent from this place for
treatment.
About 100 yards south-south-east of this a small prospecting hole
has been put down, in which there are low-grade carbonates, with a
little oxide of copper.
The upper cutting or trench is about 50 yards from the lower
trench. Here there is a baud of about 2 feet 6 inches of felspathic
rock, completely interlaced with minute veinlets of blue and green
carbonates of copper. This is an exceedingly pretty ore, and from its
weight must contain a good percentage of copper. It appears to be
dipping in a south-south-westerly direction. A little red oxide of
copper is mixed with this. No rich oxides were discovered in this
cutting, and only about one ton of ore was sent away for treatment.
The upper and lower cuttings appear to be situated on two
separate dykes running in a north-west and south-easterly direction.
The outcrop of these dykes, with copper stains here and there,
can be traced for at least 200 yards in a north-westerly direction.
Similar dykes occur in other portions of this lease in which copper
ore is visible.
With reference to the formation of these deposits of copper ore,
it is evident that the ore has been brought up in solution, and
deposited in the small cracks, fissures, and cavities, or soft portions of
these dykes, at a period subsequent to their formation. The dykes
themselves show evidence of some disturbance in that they are
brecciated, being formed to a large extent of broken and angular
particles of the dyke rock itself, with particles of shale mixed with
it; so that it is easily understood how water carrying the ores in
solution could have found its way up and deposited the copper in the
interstices of the rock.
Whether the copper ore, at the distance it is from a railway, will
pay to work, if found in sufficient quantities, is for metallurgists to
decide.
Up to the present, as the above descriptions show, nothing but
open-cast work has been carried on, and this is scarcely sufficient to
indicate in what quantities the payable copper ore is likely to exist.
What has been proved is that rich copper ore occurs in what are
known as ?pockets? or ?bunches,? distributed here and there
throughout a mass of dyke material. When underground work
commences, unless these pockets are large and of frequent occurrence,
or a more defined body of ore is met with, great difficulty will be
experienced in finding them without any indications to act as a guide.


Mr. Hirsch has, I understand, now decided to sink shafts, and
drive tunnels at lower levels, so that this problem should soon be
solved.
Two blocks have been taken for gold?viz., the Little Wonder
and the Apple-Tree.
THE LITTLE WONDER.
This claim is situated about half-a-mile south of the Mount
Cannindah. Three leaders have been found on this property, averaging
from 4to 6 inches in width. Trenches only have been put down
on them. The leaders are running in an east and west direction.
A sample, collected by myself and assayed by Mr. Henderson, yielded
gold at the rate of 13 dwt, 17 gr per ton, and 12 dwt. 20 gr. of silver
per ton. This return is much lower than what Mr. Hirsch has
obtained. He tells me that the average of several assays was about
4 oz. of gold per ton.
I may add that I obtained prospects of gold in every sample I
washed.
What is known as the B Reef runs east 30 degrees north,
and is perpendicular. A trench has been dug along it, in which it
averages about 6 inches in width. A little higher up the ridge the
leader is very rubbly, and on washing this rubble I obtained fair
prospects of gold. The reef is in slate country, but almost imme-
diately south of it there is a small patch of intrusive syenite.
The C Reef is situated almost 50 feet south-east of the above,
and is running nearly east and west. Not much work has been done.
There is only a small trench, which shows it to be about 6 inches in
width.
Rive and a-half tons of quartz from the Little Wonder Reef were
sent to Aldershot for treatment. After sampling it yielded by assay at
the rate of 1 oz. of gold per ton, and by actual treatment at the rate of
1 oz. 4 dwt. of gold per ton. The result by assay has, I conclude,
been given in pure gold.
Ten tons were also sent to the Eidsvold battery for treatment,
and yielded 26 oz. 8 dwt., or at the rate of 2 oz. 12 dwt. of gold
per ton.
THE APPLE-TREE.
This is situated close to Cabbage-tree Creek, about one and
a-quarter miles south-south-east of the camp.
There is a large outcrop of a dyke, of like character to those on
the Mount Cannindah and Monument Claims, in which there are a
few stains of carbonate of copper, and impregnations of oxide of iron.
The dyke is running east 10 degrees north, and west 10 degrees south.
A trench has been dug at right angles to and across the outcrop
of this dyke, on the southern end of which a small quartz reef, of
from 5 to 6 inches in width, is running in a north-east and south-west
direction, and dipping north-west at 40 degrees. The reef contains a
fair amount of oxide of iron, and also iron pyrites, and there is little
doubt that at 'a comparatively shallow depth it will contain large
quantities of iron pyrites.


The rock close to the reef is very much decomposed, and has the
appearance of being a decomposed diorite. A trench, 150 feet in
length and about 4 feet in depth, has been dug in a south-westerly
direction on the reef. The reef in this trench, though generally of
solid quartz, is mullocky in parts, and in places not more than 2 inches
in width.
I collected a sample from this leader, which was assayed by Mr.
Henderson, with the result that it yielded at the. rate of 1 oz. 4 dwt.
19 gr. of gold per ton, and 24 oz. 6 dwt. 2 gr. of silver per ton.
There is a parallel leader, on which no work at all has been done,
100 yards north of this.
About three-quarters of a mile north of the camp, on the opposite
side of Cabbage-tree Creek, there are several outcrops of large quartz
reefs. The quartz is hard and white, and not of a character likely to
carry payable gold.
The prospects from these reefs have, I was informed, been very
poor.
The reefs which up to the present Mr. Hirsch has found in this
district, and which have proved to be auriferous, are certainly some-
what small, but they have only been worked in shallow trenches.
They are true fissure reefs, and sinking alone will prove whether they
will increase in size in going down ; but I must add that the average
size of a reef at the surface where it has been traced any distance
as an indication of what may be expected below ground.
The small quantity of stone that has been crushed shows that
they contain gold in payable quantities, provided that a sufficient body
of stone can be obtained.
The formation (Gympie Beds) in which they occur has proved
auriferous at many places in the district. Monal Gold Field, situated
in a very similar position with reference to the Dawes Eange, and
about seventeen miles to the north-west, has in the last four years
yielded 11,545 oz. of gold from 9,800 tons of quartz.
The Cania Gold Field, in rocks of the same age, is about twenty-
five miles in a direction slightly north of west.
The area prospected at Mount Cannindah is very small, and as
the same rocks occur over a large district there is every probability of
fresh discoveries being made.
