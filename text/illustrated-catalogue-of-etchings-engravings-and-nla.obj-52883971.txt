MELBOURNE CENTENNIAL EXHIBITION, 1888.
| Extract from the Argus. January 19th, 1889.]
A great many of the leading Art Publishers of London have sent collective exhibits,
consisting of selections of the works published by them from time to time. These
collective exhibits are, in nearly every case, extremely fine, and enable the beholder to form
an excellent idea of the high perfection to which the art of engraving has been carried in
England. The sub-jury have selected for special mention the small but very choice
collection of Messrs. C. E. Clifford & Co. The large number of works exhibited in this
court by the artist and owner include many Etchings and Engravings of considerable
merit.
