ON THE EXTINCT ANIMALS OF THE
COLONIES OF GEEAT BRITAIN.
By Professor Owen, C.8., F.R.S., &c.
At the conclusion of my student?s career at Paris, in the time of
Baron Cuvier, my first application of that great teacher?s ? Laws
of Reconstruction of Extinct Animals from their Fossil Remains ?
was to those of the British Isles,* of which study the results, as
relating to the Mammals,! Birds, and Reptiles,! have been
published.
I next turned my attention to the fossil evidences of these
classes of animals in the Colonies of the Empire ; and I propose to
submit to the Royal Colonial Institute, on the present occasion,
the chief results in relation to the Cape of Good Hope, Australia,
and New Zealand.
Cape of Good Hope.
My present notice of the evidences of extinct animals of
the Cape of Good Hope will be limited to those of the Reptilian
class, to which the South African crocodiles, tortoises, lizards, and
toads are now the animals nearest akin. Of fossil remains of
serpents I have received none ; nor are any of the fossil reptiles
which have reached me from the Cape allied in genera, families, or
even orders, to those now existing in the world. All the Cape
subjects of my attempts at restoration are from what are commonly
termed the ? Karoo beds,? covering an area of over 200,000 square
miles, extending between latitudes 35 Q and 83� 80' S. and longi-
tudes 20� and 28 E. They overlie deposits of Devonian and
Carbonifeious age, include those answering to European Permian
and Trias, and consequently are of older date than the oolites and
liassic cliffs in England from which have been derived, among
other strange reptilian forms, the numerous kinds of ichthyosaurs
and plesiosaurs.
The Cape fossils are embedded and petrified in shales and rocks
of quartzose sandstones, the strata of which slightly incline in
their southern verge from horizontality. They seem to have been

deposited from lacustrine or estuarine waters during a lapse of
time which may be conceived from the mountain ranges into
which they are now elevated. The following vertical thickness of
the fossiliferous strata has been ascertained: at the ? Stormherg
beds,? to be 1,800 feet; at the ? Beaufort Beds,? 1,700 feet; at the
? Koonap Beds,? 1,500 feet; at the ?Upper Ecca beds,? 1,200 feet.
These stratified beds, or basins of ancient waters, have been, in
the course of their upheaval, traversed by trap dykes, and the
consolidating and elevating forces to which the shales have been
subject have converted them into the hardest and most intractable
rocks that my chisel ever operated on : it ? strikes fire ? at every
blow. The difficulty of extricating the embedded teeth and bones
of the strange creatures that haunted the banks and shallows of the
ancient lakes or estuaries is enhanced by the near correspondence
in colour of the petrified parts to the dark, often black, rock in
which they are embedded.
In the year 1838, Mr. Andrew Geddes Bain, employed in the
construction of a military road north of Fort Beaufort, observed in
parts of the rock he was blasting, portions like teeth and fragments
of bone ; these he transmitted to the Geological Society of London,
and they were referred by the Council to me to report on. The
result was so novel that Mr. Bain was encouraged to persevere in
the collection and transmission of such evidences, and received for
that purpose grants of money from the Geological Society and
from the Trustees of the British Museum. I kept up communica-
tion with Mr. A. G. Bain until his demise, and have continued the
same with his son, Mr. Thomas Bain, the present Surveyor of
Eoads to the Cape Colony.
The rich series of fossil evidences from these gentlemen have
been supplemented by specimens transmitted by successive
Governors (Sir George Gray, K.C.8., and Sir Henry Barkly, K.C.B),
by H.E.H. the Duke of Edinburgh, by Dr. Guybon Atherstone, of
Graham?s Town, by Dr.Eubidge, by J. M. Orpen, Esq., Government
Surveyor of the Cape, and by several friendly Colonists.
Besides separate ? Eeports ? and ?Memoirs? in the ?Transactions
of the Eoyal and Geological Societies,? the fossils so received have
afforded subjects filling 70 plates of a 4to. work of 100 pages of text, \
now on the table.
I think the most extraordinary, as it was the first to be restored,

of the old Cape reptiles, was a creature attaining the size of a walrus,
and which, like that amphibious mammal, had a pair of long,
pointed tusks descending from the upper jaw. But it had no other
teeth, and it combined the two-tusked character with a lower jaw,
edentulous, like that of a tortoise, and a skull exemplifying croco-
dilian and lacertian structures. Many species of this type, varying
in size, came successively to hand, and exemplified the genus called
Dicynodon. Other two-tusked reptiles required a distinct generic
section, called Ptychognathus. A third extensive series carried the
tortoise likeness further by the absence of tusks, but with the same
composite cranial structure as in the Bidentals; and, in short, a
series of Eeptilia was brought to light which necessitated the
formation of a new order in the class, to which was assigned the
denomination of Anomodontia.
Now, although no true coal has been met with in the Karoo
strata, although present in the older Devonian series, at the Cape,
called the Kowie Coal beds, yet remains of a rich series of vegeta-
tion on the land traversed or occasionally visited by the Karoo
reptiles have been detected. I was not surprised, therefore, to
receive evidences of huge herbivorous dragons, akin, although re-
motely, to our own liassic scelidosaurs and the Wealden iguanodons.
The jaws of the Tapinocephali, of the Pareiosauri, and of the
Anthodons were armed with close-set series of equal-sized teeth,
having crowns adapted to crush and pound vegetable substances,
and were associated with modifications of the skull for horizontal
grinding movements of the jaws. A significant fact was elicited by
scrutiny, and sections of parts, of the back-bone of these Dinosauria.
The bodies of the vertebrae retained more of the foetal structure than
has been met with in any post-triassic herbivorous reptile. Those
of anthodon, for example, were bi-concave as in fishes, and those of
pareiosaurus and tapinocephalus carried the primitive embryonal
character a degree further. The apices of the hollow terminal
cones, which nearly meet in the centre in Anthodon, communicate
in the other genera, exemplifying the persistence in those huge
dragons of a continuous, beaded notocord. Hence the necessity of
placing them in a distinct section of Dinosauria, called ? Treto-
spondilia,? and it may be, as our restorations become completed,
that erpetologists will regard them as the types of an order
distinct from the later forms of Dinosauria.
In the Trias of Europe had been found the jaws and portions of
skull of a fossil creature provided with large flattened crushing
teeth, like a pavement .covering the palate above, and the corre-
spondingly broad tracts of the under-jaw. These fossils wore


referred by Agassiz snd Meyer to an extinct fish called Placodns.
The first specimen of this rare genus that came to my hands, from
Germany, showed, however, characters which led me to think it
was a reptile, not a fish. It was with much pleasure, therefore,
that I found among the Cape fossils an unequivocal and larger
extinct reptile, provided with similar crushing teeth, and with these
only ; forming, likewise, a pavement upon the palate opposed
to similar teeth on a broad alveolar tract of the lower jaw. Since
describing and figuring this fossil, under the name Endothiodon, I
have lately received a second species of the same genus, also from
the Karoo beds. It is, of course-, significant to note that the only
analogous form of reptile from localities elsewhere than at the Cape
had left its remains in deposits of Triassic age. At the present
day, the only known aquatic vertebrates adapted by their teeth to
crack and crush shell-fish belong to the class of Fishes : such, for
example, are the Wolf-fish (Anarrhichas) and the Port Jackson
Shark (Cestracion).
An extensive series of Eeptilia has been brought to light from
the Cape fossiliferous beds above specified, which were of a more
strictly and decidedly carnivorous nature than the Dicynodonts,
combining upper tusks of a more piercing and trenchant character
opposed to a pair of similar tusks below, crossing in front of the
upper pair when the mouth was shut. These killing and holding
teeth, like the canines, or laniary teeth, of. the lion and dog,
were preceded by incisor teeth of a similarly pointed shape, and
followed by molar teeth, of the character of those called carnassial
or sectorial in Mammalian ferae. This type of dentition, in which
the ?incisors,? ?canines,? and ?molars? can be specified on
characters of size, shape, and relative position, had hitherto
been unknown, save in the Mammalian class; but it is combined
in these extinct Cape creatures with a true Reptilian or cold-
blooded cranial and vertebral structure. With this guiding
evidence of the Reptilian class of our present series of fossils, I
further found associated with such dentition that the teeth were
retained, as in Mammals, sufficiently long for the fangs to dwindle
and become consolidated at the implanted end; that the humerus,
with ridges and processes adapted to as free evolutions of the fore-
paw as in the lion, also showed a canal for the passage and
defence of a brachial artery and nerve, not present in any exist-
ing kind of Reptile, but characterising the humerus in many,
especially feline carnivorous, Mammalia. Furthermore, that the paws
were supported by joints or phalanges in the same numbers, or
according to the same formula, as the Mammalian paw.


Detecting many and various modifications of this carnivorous
reptilian type, I felt constrained to group them into a distinct
order, called Theeiodontia. This order was exemplified in
South Africa by a species and genus ( Titanosuchus fewx ) surpass-
ing the lion in size; by others as large as a leopard ( Lycosaurus
pardalis); and by others, again, as small as a cat or foumart
(Galesaurus and Procolophon). I may also note a fact of some
significance, that the incisive formula in the Theriodonts is not
that of the higher or placental Mammals, but of the lower, more
g g
reptile-like, marsupial ones. Thus, Oynodracon has i like
the opossums ( Didelphis ); Lycosaurus has i Thylacinus
and Sarcophilus (the native hyama and devil of the Tasmanian
colonists); while the placental Carnivora never show more than
. 3-3
* 3-3'
In the existing Eeptilia the characters above specified are want-
ing. They would have been unknown and unsuspected as reptilian
ones, save for such researches as are here summarised. If the gap
in the series of animals continued from the Triassic to the present
period had not been filled up otherwise than by reptiles, the living
remnant of that class would have testified to total loss of such
gains of organisation as had enriched the predecessors of modern
tortoises, lizards, and crocodiles.
We now know, through discovery and study of fossil remains,
that not one of the gains which benefited our extinct reptiles
has been lost, but has been handed on, and advanced through a
higher type of Vertebrates, of which mammalian type we trace
the dawn back to the period when Eeptiles were at their best,
grandest in bulk, most numerous in individuals, most varied in
species, best endowed with kinds and powers of locomotion, and
with instruments for obtaining and dealing with both animal and
vegetable food.
Then obtrudes the question, and will not be parried, Has the
transference of structures from the Eeptilian to the Mammalian
type been a seeming one, delusive, due to accidental coincidences
in animal species independently created ? Or, was the transference
real, consequent on the incoming of modified species by way of
descent, and through the operation of a secondary law ? Certain it
is that the lost reptilian structures defined in this paper are now
manifested at the Cape of Good Hope by quadrupeds with a higher
condition of cerebral, circulatory, respiratory, and tegumentary


systems. But into these higher generalisations of biological
science it is beside my present purpose to enter.
I therefore next proceed to notice the Extinct Animals of the
Colony of
New Zealand.
When Cook re-discovered,* or, for us, virtually discovered New
Zealand, in 1769, he was accompanied by Solander, a pupil of
Linnaeus, and by Joseph Banks, an ardent collector of facts and
objects of Natural History. They made every effort, and tried
every means of inquiry of the friendly natives, in pursuance of
their quest. A dog, resembling that which they had seen in Poly-
nesian islands, and probably introduced into New Zealand by the
Maories, was noticed, and a species of rat was obtained, which was
fostered for food by the natives. Bats had flown thither, but no
wild land-mammals were seen or heard of. Although Captain
Cook was enjoined by the ? Admiralty Instructions ? to bring
home ?any extraneous fossils? he might meet with, none such
were obtained in New Zealand ; nor could any information be
extracted as to any beast or bird notable for its large size that
then existed or had existed in the island. In the Maori ? Voca-
bulary ? appended to the ? Voyage,? neither the word ? Moa ?
nor ?Movie? occur. The natives gave no sign that they knew
anything of gigantic birds which had served their ancestors for
food.
Subsequent expeditions, having Natural History more directly
in view, sent out by the French Government, were equally unsuc-
cessful. The accomplished zoologist Lesson accompanied the
?Voyage de la Coquille ?in 1820. MM. Quoy and Gaimard were
attached to the Astrolabe (1827). The ? Zoologie? of both
voyages was brought out in detail and with rich illustrations by
the French Government, but no clue to the singular extinct Avi-
fauna of New Zealand was obtained. Confirmation was recorded
of the small wingless bird, the Kivi, of which Captain Barclay, of
the ship Providence, had brought to England a skin, in the
year 1812; but no idea was suggested of the gigantic race of
which that bird has proved to be the sole survivor.
One afternoon in the year 1838, as I was preparing for a lecture,
an individual was announced, who unwrapped a bone which he
# Abel Tasman reached the west coast of New Zealand in December, 1642.
He made no observations on the animals or products of the islands, and de-
parted, after the slaughter by the natives of four of his crew.


stated he had obtained in New Zealand from a native, who told
him it was the bone of a great eagle, and for this specimen the
man asked the sum of ten guineas. I assured him he had been
misinformed, that no bird of flight had a bone of that structure;
that it was a ? marrow-bone,? in shape and size like those brought
to table wrapped in a napkin.
To further questions as to its locality, the vendor replied by
showing, among other evidences, a jade-stone weapon, which I
knew to be peculiar to the New Zealanders, and he still attached
so much value to the unpromising fragment, that I consented to
try to make out the bone if he would leave it and call the next day.
After ? Lecture,? I took the bone to the skeleton of the ox, ex-
pecting to verify my first surmise ; but with much resemblance to
the shaft of the thigh-bone, there were precluding differences:
from the arm-bone ( humerus) of the ox, which also affords the
tavern delicacy, the discrepancy of shape was more marked. Still,
led by the thickness of the wall of the marrow-cavity, I proceeded
to compare the bone with similar-sized portions of the skeletons of
the various large quadrupeds which might have been introduced
and have left remains in New Zealand.
In the course of these comparisons I noted certain superficial
impressions which recalled to mind similar ones which I had ob-
served on the surface of the bones of some large birds. There-
upon, I proceeded to the skeleton of the ostrich. The ?bone?
tallied in point of size with the shaft of the thigh-bone in that
bird, but was different in shape. In the latter character it was
more like the thigh-bone of the cassowary; but it differed in a
more important particular from that bone in the ostrich, casso-
wary, emu, rhea, and eagle, inasmuch as in those birds the
femur is ? pneumatic,? or contains air, whereas the huge bird?s
bone in question had been filled with marrow, like the thigh-bone
of a beast.
I was almost staggered by the conclusion in which I was landed.
Could a bird as big as an ostrich, and of a more massive build,
have ever found subsistence in so small an island as New Zea-
land ? All analogy seemed against it. The ostrich has the whole
continent of Africa for its home, the rhea roams over South
America, the emu over Australia, the cassowary over New Guinea !
These considerations, indeed, told more strongly with the then
master - ornithologists, my seniors, Vigors and Yarrell, and to
whose judgment I looked with due deference. Yet their scepti-
cism was more natural from their not being practically familiar
with the force of palaeontological evidence. And, as I urged, this


huge bird, if I could be credited, was new to Science, and so might
as well have come from New Zealand as from anywhere else. In
short, the ? Paper ? was admitted into the Transactions of the
Zoological Society, with one plate, giving four views of ? the bone ?
in question.
On the publication of the volume in 1839, one hundred extra
copies of the paper were struck off, and these I distributed in
every quarter of the islands of New Zealand where attention to
such evidences was likely to be attracted.
At that date their acquisition to Great Britain was mainly pro-
moted by the ?New Zealand Company,? whose agent, Captain
William Wakefield, was zealously carrying out the principles of
colonisation advocated by his brother, Edward Gibbon Wakefield.
Through J. R. Gowen, Esq., a director of the company, the dis-
tribution of my paper was recommended and efficiently carried out
by Captain Wakefield.
The missionary promptly worked in the track of the colonist.
Imperial recognition became inevitable. First a Governor, then a
Bishop, Dr. Selwyn ; afterwards a Chief Justice, my friend Sir
William Martin, went out. Upon each and all I pressed the claims
of the possible big bird of New Zealand to attention according to
leisure and opportunity. The years 1840 and 1841 passed, and 1
began to doubt, but misgiving went no further than as to locality;
of the bird itself I may say I was ? cock-sure.? Toward the
close of 1842 came the welcome letter of the Rev. William Cotton,
M.A., companion of the Bishop, announcing the discovery of big
bones in the North Island, and this was followed by the arrival of
a boxful transmitted by a fellow-missionary, now the Right Rev.
Bishop Williams, to Dr. Buckland, by whom these specimens were
generously confided to me for description. They included a nearly
perfect specimen of the bone of which I had received the shaft,
and with it the other bones of the hind limb of the same bird.
These afforded adequate grounds for defining a genus Dinornis,
and a species struthioides. But what I was not prepared to see,
and saw with amazement, were similar evidences of a larger species
of the same genus, a Dinornis inge <s, and other remains of a still
larger kind, a Dinornis giganteus. But might not these be parts
of individuals of the one and the same gigantic bird at different
stages of growth ? The answer to this question is given by the
well-marked characters of immaturity which the bones of the
bird?s leg display, and especially the third or metatarsal bone,
which is a compound one, and does not acquire the consolidation
or coalescence of its three or more constituent elements until


maturity is reached. Moreover, with the above evidences of birds
of the same genus, surpassing in size any previously known, were
others of smaller size, also of full-grown birds. They indicated
the former existence in New Zealand of a Dinornis casuarinus, a
Dinornis dromioides, a Dinornis otidiformis, so called as agreeing in
size respectively with the cassowary, the emu, and the bustard.
Of the latter I subsequently received remains justifying its title to
a distinct genus, Aptornis. All the others belonged to the genus
Dinornis. Correspondence was kept up with every contributor in
New Zealand of specimens and of information bearing upon this
new chapter in ornithology. Year by year accessions of fossils
reached me; all were of the class of Birds.
No evidence of an extinct mammal or of an extinct reptile has
hitherto been obtained from the comparatively recent formation
yielding the avian remains. The progress of restoration was in
two directions, one in perfecting a knowledge of the entire skeleton
of an individual, the other of the specific and generic modifications
of these extinct wingless birds. The law of correlation, justifying
the affirmation from the first fragment that the bird was terrestrial,
incapable of flight, proportionally heavier and more sluggish than
the ostrich, was vindicated by discovery of the small and keel-less
breast-bone ; and by the relatively still smaller scapular arch, which,
moreover, indicated an entire want of wings by the presence of a
ridge where the socket for the main wing-bone should have been,
and where it exists in the ostrich, and also in the apteryx, in
which the wing is reduced to the smallest relative dimensions
among existing birds. If any still smaller rudiments of a humerus
should have existed and have been suspended by ligament to the
scapulo-coracoid arch, in Dinornis, such specimen has not yet
reached me. Means of restoring the skull, the pelvis, the vertebral
column, and the entire foot successively arrived.
The next and very remarkable kind of Dinornis was characterised
by the relative thickness of the bones of the hind limb, and sug-
gested the epithet Elephantopus. This elephant-footed bird was as
tall as an ostrich, but must have outweighed two at least of that
largest of living birds?the Avium maxima of Linnaeus. But I was
favoured, next, to receive remains of a Dinornis which as much sur-
passed in size the giganteus, as did this the ingens. Deeming then,
as now, that the limits of bulk were surely reached, I committed
myself to the nomen specif cum of Dinornis maximus. Of this
stupendous bird you may see the skeleton in the British Museum.
I thought the articulated'casts of that of the Megatheriumi giganteum
a suitable equivalent, in which the accomplished founder of the


Natural History Museum at Christchurch, Canterbury Province,
South Island, concurred. Dr. von Haast has had the same plea-
sure in adding that evidence of one of the hugest extinct Mammals
to his museum at the Antipodes, as I have experienced in the
addition, due to his discovery in the Glenmark swamp of the
maximised Moa, of the skeleton of that bird in our National
Museum at home.*
The species of Dinornis now more or less completely restored
are fifteen in number, viz. struthioides, ingens, giganteus, dro-
mioides, casuarinus, rheides, crassus, gravis, gracilis, geranoides,
robustus, elephantopus, curtus, and maximus. The last two
exemplify the opposite extremes of size in the extinct genus.
Our knowledge of these extinct wingless birds is not, however,
restricted to their osteology. Some have left their remains in
caves, and under other conditions, which have enabled us to study
and compare portions of their skin, and even their plumage. The
feather, as in other flightless birds, had loose barbs, and it was
provided with an after-shaft, two feathers growing out of one quill,
as in the cassowary. Of the skin of the sole of the foot and of the
form and substance of the toes I have had evidence from foot-
prints in tidal clay, and from casts of such. I have also received
evidence of the eggs of the Dinornis. Perhaps one of the richest
localities of the remains of these extinct birds of New Zealand was
discovered by the Rev. Richard Taylor, M.A., of the Missionary
Station at Wapganui, near or along the shore at Waimate. ?It
appeared,? he wrote, ?to be a regular necropolis of the race.?
From this locality was obtained the specimens subsequently ob-
tained by purchase from Mr. Walter Mantel!, for the British
Museum.
The spread of colonies in different parts of both islands of New
Zealand, with concomitant growth on my part of correspondence
and appeals for search, collection, and transmission of fossil re-
mains, have resulted in a corresponding harvest of such evidences,
from which, besides the confirmation and restoration of the above-
cited species of Dinornis, indications of other extinct wingless or
short-winged birds have been received. They have included two
kinds of coot, one (Notornis) of the size of a turkey, the other
(Aptornis) nearly as big as a cassowary ; a third kind of bird
* I am indebted to the Duke of Argyll for the opportunity of comparing, in
1858, the bones of the hind limb transmitted to his Grace by the hev. Dr.
Little from the South Island of New Zealand ; which bones are described and
figured in the Trans, of the Zool. Soc. vol. vi.


(Cuemiornis) in the leg-bone of which characters like those of a
natatorial bird (Colymhus) were pointed out,* was subsequently
shown by Dr. Hector, of Wellington, New Zealand, who obtained
an entire skeleton in the North Island, to be most nearly allied to
a large anserine bird (Cereopsis) still living in Australia.! But in
the still larger extinct goose of New Zealand, as in the large coots
and kivis, the wings had become too small for flight.
The most remarkable exception to this flightless character of
the extinct birds of New Zealand was discovered in the Glenmark
swamp, in the form of bones having the nearest resemblance to
those of the Kahu Harrier-kite of the island (Circus Gouldi ), but of
a size surpassing those of the largest condor or lammer-geyer.|
I suppose this huge bird of prey may have harried and carried off
the chickens of the gigantic Moas, and that the extinction of the
Harpagornis, as it has been termed by its describer, the accom-
plished naturalist, Dr, von Haast, may have followed as a conse-
quence that of its prey. So grand a bird of flight could hardly
have escaped the notice of the natives with whom Banks and
Solander communicated, or of such acute ornithological observers
as the monographer of the existing Avifauna of New Zealand, W.
L. Buffer, Esq., F.R.S., of Wellington. It may be that some
lingering tradition of the bird led the Maori, from whom the first
indication of the fossils of New Zealand was obtained, to caff it
? the bone of a great eagle.?
More than one story of stiff existing Moas have found their way
into New Zealand newspapers ; but, like those of the great sea-ser
pent, they lack the data requisite for scientific acceptance. In both
cases the proper attitude of the naturalist is the ? expectant? one.
When the first portions of the skeleton were described and
figured in 1847, upon which the former existence of the great flight-
less coot of New Zealand was affirmed, the Notornis was concluded
to have passed away as completely as the Dinornis. But it fortu-
nately happened that Mr. Walter Mantell, visiting the south-west
part of the South Island, in 1849, came upon a party of seal-fishers
who had captured the living bird on the shore of Dusky Bay, and
had luckily kept the skin after cooking arid eating the unique
specimen. The skull and leg-bones brought to London with this
skin served to identify the species and genus: the skin, beak, and

feet confirmed the inference from the fossils. This specimen of
the Notornis Mantelli was purchased by the British Museum, where
it may now he seen.*
I suppose that any captor who should bring his Dinornis alive to
London might reckon upon a rich reward from the Council of the
Zoological Society.
At present all that I have been able to get, besides the bones,
have been brains,! rings of the wind-pipe,J gizzard stones,� eggs,
feathers, || and bits of skin,t of unquestionable Moas. But how
about the brain, it may be asked, unless you had a fresh bird ?
A very pertinent question. The brain is represented by a cast
of the interior of the cranium. It is relatively smaller than
that of the ostrich, which is reckoned the least intelligent of living
birds.
My first acquaintance with the eggs of Dinornis was founded
on the fragments of the shell obtained from ancient cooking-pits.**
Thereupon I broke up an ostrich egg into similar fragments ; then
compared the curves of their outer surface. The long and the
short diameters, i.e., the longitudinal and the transverse dimensions
of the egg, were thus indicated in the ostrich fragments; by like
indications in those of the bits of the Dinornis egg-shell, I recom-
posed the longitudinal and transverse contours of the entire egg, as
shown in plate xc. of the undercited work ; and such egg I hypo-
thetically referred to the Dinornis elephantopus. f f
In the year 1865 the entire egg of a larger species was sent to
London, and submitted to my inspection. It fetched �lOO at the
sale by auction at Stevens?s rooms. Its history is as follows. A
colonist, digging the foundation of a store at Kaikoura, Canterbury,
New Zealand, came upon the skeleton of a Maori, who had been
buried in the sitting posture, and upon his lap had been placed, at
the interment, this egg. His greenstone adze was also found in
the grave. From the superiority of length of this egg to that
ascribed to the Dinornis elephantopus, wjfh a minor degree of trans-
verse diameter, I conceived it might belong to the taller and less

robust species, Dinornis ingens .* I subsequently received from Dr.
Hector intelligence of the discovery of an egg of the Dinornis crassus,
containing some bones of a partly-hatched chick ; they included a
sternum, pelvis, coraco-scapular arch, showing the unequivocal
characteristics of their genus,! but no wing-bones. On these and
some other data I have formed an estimate of the size of the egg of
the Dinornis maximus, at sixteen inches by twelve inches in the two
diameters. |
The living kivi ( Apteryx ) is remarkable for the large proportional
size of the egg, of which it lays but one at each procreative season.
It is probable that its extinct gigantic kindred could as little afford
a relatively greater incubating area to the shelly case of their
embryo.
Of the numerous transmissions from divers localities in both
islands of New Zealand, not any have included a bone of a land-
mammal having any claim to be considered an aboriginal species,
or belonging to one which has become extinct, and would have been
otherwise unknown. Now and then, though rarely, the bone of a
rat, of the Maori dog, and of a seal could be picked out.
New Zealand never had an indigenous Mammalian fauna com-
parable to the rich Marsupia one of Australia. A bat or two flits
in its atmosphere, seals haunt its coasts, and thereupon is occa-
sionally stranded the carcase of a whale.
When the Maori first landed, he found no kangaroo or other
herbivorous beast to yield him flesh. The sole source of that food,
the more needed from the absence of the bread-fruit and cocoa-nut
trees which he had left at Hawaii, and the colder climate of the
land to which he had been driven, was in the various kinds of huge
birds incapable of flight. These, it is evident, had overspread both
islands. The rich development of ferns, with nutritious elements
in unusual proportion in the roots, of which the Maoris still avail
themselves for their favourite bread, formed a perennial table for
the support of the feathered bipeds, to which divers other kinds of
vegetable nourishment were doubtless added. � Foot-prints on the
sea-shore suggest their varying their diet by picking up marine
animals. For how many centuries, before the unfeathered biped
appeared, the Dinornithidie had roamed supreme over the islands
there are no adequate grounds for estimate.

There are evidences of different kinds that the extirpation of the
extinct birds of New Zealand was the work of man.* The question
of the origin of these wingless species is a deeper one. Into that
I have entered as far as there seemed to be any data for guidance
at the conclusion of the work on the subject of the present section
of the communication now offered to the Institute.!
Australia.
I finally proceed briefly to state the chief results of palteontogical
research in the Colonies of Australia, restricting the present notice
to the extinct species of the Mammalian class. The labours of
zoologists in the discovery and determination of the existing kinds
have made generally known the fact of the prevalence in the Aus-
tralian continent of the peculiar group called Marsupialia, or pouched
beasts ; those, viz., which produce their young prematurely as
compared with the rest of the class, and transfer them to a skin-
hag covering the teats, to which the embryo remains attached till
it gains the size and strength of the ordinarily born young in the
higher organised or placental Mammalia. But one existing genus
of these Marsupials is known elsewhere in the world?the opossums,
viz., of America ( Didelphys , Linn.). Our knowledge of the various
modifications of the Didelphs of Linnaeus has been derived exclusively
from the remnant of that vast Melanesian continent of which Aus-
tralia, Tasmania, New Guinea, and a few outlying insular frag-
ments now remain. The carnivorous kinds are represented by the
Tasmanian Thylacine, of the size of the wolf, by the somewhat
smaller Sarcophile or Devil of the Tasmanian colonists, and by
still smaller Dasyures or native cats and weasels of Australia.
The insectivorous kinds are represented by the bandicoots {Pera-
meles, Myrmecobius, Cheer opus) : the frugivorous species by the
arboreal phalangers, koalas, and petaurists ; the root-eaters by the
burrowing wombats ; the grazers and browsers by the numerous
and varied family of the saltatory potoroos and kangaroos. The
largest existing marsupial in Australia is the Boomer kangaroo
(. Macropus major). The skull of the biggest kangaroo which has
come under my observation does not exceed eight inches in length.
Such a kangaroo will outweigh by one alf the biggest thylacine.
John Gould, in his beautifully illustrated work on the ?Mammals
of Australia,? gives the length of 2 ft. 2 in. to the wombat of

Tasmania ( Phascolomys ursinus) ; the bones of the Phascolomys
latifrom of the Australian continent indicate a somewhat larger
animal, hut the skull scarcely exceeds 7 in. in length. The skull
of the largest of the extinct wombats is more than a foot in length.
Between this and the largest existing wombat were two other
species of intermediate dimensions; there were also wombats
distinct in kind but resembling in size the two or three existing
species; finally, there existed a smaller species in Australia. All
these have passed away. Admitting the specific distinction of the
two kinds of wombat now living in Australia and that of the sole
existing Tasmanian species, fossil remains have made known the
former existence of seven kinds which have become extinct.
These wombats ranged from the size of a marmot to that of the
European bear (Ursus arctos ), and the distinctive characters of the
largest kind are of generic value.
The fossil evidences of kangaroos are more abundant and
varied than those of the wombats. I shall limit myself to a brief
notice of the larger extinct kinds.
I have referred to the dimensions of the skull of the biggest
known existing kangaroo.
The first extinct species represented by the fossils obtained by
Sir Thomas Mitchell from the caves of Wellington Valley, had a
skull of 10 in. in length. I called it Macro /jus Titan, not antici-
pating in 1836 to find it but a middle-sized species. Subse-
quently I received evidences of a kangaroo with a skull 12 in. long ;
and next of one with a skull as large as that of a full-sized ox,
16 in. in length.
Now these extinct species do not differ merely in magnitude
from each other and from the smaller existing kinds, but in
modifications of the teeth and in the proportions of the limbs.
As the kangaroos gained in bulk they lost in power of leaping.
The hind limbs were less disproportionately long, the fore limbs
less disproportionately short. Both pairs took a more equal
share in the support and progression of their bulky frames.
Nevertheless all the well-marked characteristics of the macropodal
foot were retained, the modifications being restricted to those of
size and proportion of toes and leg-bones.
So likewise with tlie teeth. Certain teeth of extinct kinds were
shaped for cutting, the same teeth in other kinds for pounding.
Species not exceeding or inferior in size to existing kangaroos
manifested specific distinctions in the teeth, in the skull, and in
parts of the skeleton. T have had to name and characterise a
score of kinds of kangaroo that have existed in Australia and have


passed away; and these extinct species have made known to the
zoologist seven generic modifications of the macropodal family,
distinct from any of the genera still represented by known living
kinds of kangaroo.
The most interesting result of these comparisons of the fossil
remains of kangaroos were the indications of a gradual resumption
of the more ordinary quadrupedal character in the larger extinct
species. This transition I found to be completed in still larger
forms which retained, in the main, the macropodal type of
dentition, the modifications of the teeth indicating a more strictly
herbivorous character of quadruped.
The first of these forms was manifested under three specific
modifications, on which have been founded a Nototherium Mitchelli,
a Not. Victoria , and a Not. inerme. Of this genus I have as yet,
indeed, obtained little more than portions of the skull and teeth.
But a few detached bones of the ankle show a deviation from the
kangaroo type of foot toward that of the ordinary character, and
an arm-bone indicates a more equal size with stouter proportions
of the fore and hind limbs. I infer the Nototherium to have re-
resembled in general character a large tapir; but it was essentially
a marsupial quadruped.*
Amongst the cave-fossils submitted to me in 1835 by Sir Thos.
Mitchell, and which are described and figured in the ? Apoendix ?
to his ? Three Expeditions into the Interior of Eastern Australia ?
(2 vols. Bvo., 1838) was the fore end of one-half of a lower jaw
with the implanted end of a fractured tusk. It indicated a beast
as big as a hippopotamus. This fossil and a limb-bone sent to
Paris, of what I subsequently determined to belong to the same
species, had given rise to the notion that a true hippopotamus and
an elephant had left their remains in the caves and drift deposits
of Australia, f
After an extensive and minute comparison of the tooth-stump
from Wellington Valley with every quadruped of similar size
having such a tusk at the fore part of the under jaw, I came to the
conclusion that it must have belonged to a distinct kind of animal;
that the tusk had been one of a pair like the lower incisors in the
kangaroos, wombats, and phalangers ; and that the fossil, therefore,
indicated the former existence in Australia of a marsupial quad-

rnpod as big as a rhinoceros or hippopotamus ; but, being of a
distinct genus and species, I described and figured it as represent-
ing a new form?a Diprotodon australis.
But what would this problematical Diprotodon, guessed at by a
bit of a tooth, turn out to be ?
Now, here I may remark that there is no chase in the sporting
world so exciting, so replete with interest, so satisfactory when
events prove one to have been on the right scent, as that of a huge
beast which no mortal eye will ever see alive, and which, perhaps,
no mortal eye ever did behold !
Such a chase is not ended in a day, a week, or a season. One?s
interest is revived and roused year by year, as bit by bit of the
petrified portions of the skeleton come to hand ? and thirty such
years elapsed ere I was able to outline a restoration of Diprotodon
australis, such as is shown in the Plate of the work* now sub-
mitted to the Institute.
The dental formula of the diprotodon is that of the notothere

and of the kangaroo, viz., i- - c ~??=, =2B- The true

molars have the crown cleft into two strong transverse ridges, also
the fundamental pattern of those teeth in the kangaroos. But the
skull of the diprotodon is a yard in length.f The thigh-bone
might well suggest to the Parisian palaeontologist the idea of an
elephantine quadruped. The fore limbs and hind limbs are of
equal length. The animal must have trod the ground like a
heavy pachydermal brute. Yet there are multiplied proofs in its
skeleton that it carried its young in a pouch, and that it belonged
to the prevalent characteristic type of suckling beasts in Australia
?that it was, in fact, the giant of the Marsupial order.
In wild nature a balance is maintained between the flesh-makers
and the flesh-eaters. The teleologist expatiates upon the bene-
ficence of the check interposed by Providence upon the undue
increase of the vegetable feeders through the contemporaneous
existence of their devourers.J In Australia, at the present period,
the wild or native browsers and grazers are in excess.
The native or aboriginal carnivora are now too few and too
feeble to keep the herds of kangaroos in due check. The largest

known existing native carnivore in Australia is the so-called
?native cat? (Dasyurus macro unis).
In the smaller adjacent insular tract of ? Van Dieman?s Land,?
or Tasmania, although there be no kangaroo exceeding the
Australian rufous kind in size, there are two kinds of indigenous
Marsupial carnivivora larger and more destructive than any known
to exist in the more extensive continent. One of these is the so-
called ? devil,? the other the native hyaena. The zoologist
substitutes for the colonial vernacular appellatives his descriptive
Greek compounds. Sarcophilus, or ? flesh-lover,? designates the
mischievous, untameable brute which might weigh down a jackal,
though of more compact and robust build. Thylacinus, or ? pouched
wolf,? or ? hyaena ? is the name by which the larger striped sheep-
worrier is known to science.
Strange that neither of these ? checks ? should exist in the
wider field, to operate upon the manifold herds of marsupial
herbivores of the larger continent! Stranger still if the balance
or check had never been interposed during the old times, when the
larger kinds of kangaroo and their huge, even gigantic congeners
browsed the scrub or grazed the prairie over the length and
breadth of the Australian continent.
The following is the account which the palaeontologist has to
render on this subject. Mitchell?s gatherings in the breccia clefts
and hollows of the limestone rocks in Eastern Australia included
remains of both Sarcophilus and Thylacinus, corresponding in bulk
and specific characters with the species still existing in Tasmania.
Considering the size of these carnivores, their audacity, the damage
which the larger one inflicts upon the flocks of the Tasmanian
colonist, and the stupid pertinacity with which the smaller
?devil? devastates his poultry-yard, it is not likely that either
species would have escaped the notice of the Australian settler if
it had lingered on to be a pest, or an ally, to any of the great
colonies of that continent.
I conclude, therefore, that both the species have become extinct
in Australia, and that they formerly existed there as they still
exist in Tasmania. Moreover, in addition to the cave-specimens,
I have received evidences of both Thylacinus and Sarcophilus from
the drift deposits and beds of rivers in several and distant parts of
Australia. And these fossils, besides testifying to species indis-
tinguishable by tooth and bone from the Tasmanian kinds, indicate
others of larger size, which have never been observed living. Of
Sarcophilus, of which the present ursine kind might be matched
by a jackal, I have had evidence of a species ( Sarcophilus laniarius )


as big as a leopard. Of Thylacinus I have also fossils of a larger
than the existing kind, equalling a panther in power ( Thylacinus
major). Neither of these extinct Australian carnivores, however,
bore the proportion to the nototheres and diprotodons which the
South African lion bears to the buffaloes, elands, and other great
herbivores upon which it preys.
Something still seemed wanting in the proportion of the beasts
of prey to the beasts which converted the grass and herbage of the
field into flesh in these ancient epochs of Australian life.
Now, among the fossils submitted to me by Major Mitchell, in
1835, was a tooth, which from its resemblance to that called the
? carnassial,? or ? flesh-cutter,? in the lion?s jaw raised a suspicion
that there had existed in Australia a carnivore exceeding in size
the largest of the extinct Thylacines. But a comparison of this
solitary fossil with all the modifications of the teeth in the various
existing kinds of Marsupialia, had made me acquainted with a
somewhat similarly shaped sectorial tooth in certain small phyti-
phagous and mixed-feeding genera. I could not, therefore, give
undue weight to other resemblances supporting only a conjecture.
Additional discoveries might supply the required test, and were to
be waited for. If the large fossil sectorial tooth in question wa s
the premolar of a gigantic phalanger or potoroo, it must have been
preceded by teeth shaped for cutting and nibbling, and have
been followed by several large flat or ridged broad molars for
crushing and grinding. If the large sectorial tooth was a premolar
of a carnivore, it must have been preceded by teeth for piercing
and holding, and have been followed by molars small in size and
few in number, tubercular in shape, and adapted at best for
pounding gristle or tendon.
Pending, therefore, the possible acquisition of specimens yielding
the required dental evidence, I contented myself with giving figures
of the tooth in question,* in order to attract attention to any fossils
which might show such a tooth associated with more of the
animal?s dentition.
In the course of a few years I received the requisite evidence.
First, in the form of a lower jaw, from the bed of the Condamine
river, Queensland; next, in that of a mutilated skull, from the bed
of a lake eighty miles south-west of Melbourne ; and subsequently,
by more perfect specimens demonstrative of the super-carnivorous
character of the dentition of the extinct beast, which thereupon

I called Thylacoleo, or pouched lion. Teeth like the canine
tusks of the lion precede the carnassial tooth first discovered; that
tooth is followed, also as in the lion, by one small tubercular tooth
in the upper jaw, opposed to two smaller tuberculars in the lower
jaw; the carnassial of that jaw worked upon the upper one like a
shear-blade, and the extensive and smoothly worn surfaces are
matched by those of the flesh-cutters in old lions and hyasnas of
the present day.
Thus it appears that Australia was formerly inhabited by
mammals of the peculiar marsupial type, not only varied for pre-
datory and herb-eating life, but exhibiting their type under
dimensions as varied as are the higher or placental wild beasts of
the larger continents of the globe. Creatures nearest of kin to
the Australian forms, and, like them, marsupial, have indeed lived
and bred on land which now forms part of the island of Great
Britain. Fossil remains of a carnivorous mammal with a dentition
most nearly like that of Thylacoleo, have been discovered at
Purbeck, on the Dorsetshire coast. Fossil remains of an insecti-
vorous marsupial, many-toothed like the Australian Myrmecobius,
have been found in Oxfordshire, in the slates of Stonesfield. Both
these localities are of the middle or ? Mesozoic ? period in geology,
and I may give an idea of their antiquity by saying that not a
particle of the chalk cliffs or ? bushless downs ? in England had
been formed, when the old pre-Britannic continent flourished which,
in its vegetation, its shells, the fishes of its sea-shore, and the beasts
of its fields, bore the nearest resemblance, in fauna and flora, to
the antipodean seat of our present flourishing Australian Colonies.
We are now superseding there the oolitic types, which alone pre-
sented themselves to the naturalists of Cook?s voyage, by the
higher forms of vegetable and animal life that have lent themselves,
or been by man, adapted to his special needs, in Asia and Europe.
But the kangaroo, which Banks and Solander first saw, and
thought to be a huge bird as it hopped out of their ken into the
scrub, was actually the largest marsupial quadruped that at that
date existed in Australia.
At what period became extinct those huger forms of marsupial
life which palaeontology has made known to us ? To what cause
is due the extinction in Australia of the diprotodons, the noto-
theres, the thylacoleons, the phascolones or gigantic wombats, the
palorchestes, procoptodonts, protemnodonts, sthenurans, with the
thylacynes and sarcophiles which alone of all the preceding
Marsupials still linger on in life in the neighbouring island of
Tasmania ?


No other extirpating cause has suggested itself to my mind save
the hostile agency of man. No evidence of diluvial catastrophe or of
climatal change has been discovered to account for the disappear-
ance, for example, of the Macropus Titan and the survival of
Macropus major.
To a race of men depending, like the ? black-fellows,? for sub-
sistence on the chase, the largest and most conspicuous kinds of
wild beasts first fall a prey. Their dog, the half-wild dingo, assists
in this work. The smaller kinds, with swifter powers of locomo-
tion, more easily conceal themselves and escape.
True it is that, as yet, no evidence of the ancestry of the existing
aborigines of Australia has been detected in the caverns which
have yielded fossil remains of their hypothetical prey. But such
caves, if explored with due care, skill, and method, may bring to
light, as they have done in England, indubitable evidences of the
pre-Adamitic or pre-historic men of Australia; the extensive shell-
mounds attest the enormous period during which these primitive
people roamed over that continent. *
In conclusion, I may remark that, at the commencement of my
application of anatomical knowledge, fifty years ago, to the recon-
struction of extinct species, not one such of the classes here treated
of was known to have lived in any of the three great Colonies
which I have selected for this evening?s discourse.
What, then, may be expected from analogous researches and
collections of the fossil remains in the caves, drifts, and tertiary
deposits of New Guinea! As we learnt from the admirable paper
to which I was privileged to listen at a former meeting of this
Institute, we may infer from the varied configuration of New
Guinea, from its mountain ranges and concomitant streams and
rivers, its caverns, doubtless opening into defiles and valleys, its
latitudes, involving conditions and stimulants of life surpassing
those under which the beasts flourished on whose remains Colonial
palaeontology has been hitherto exercised, that there is a promise
of results which will exceed in novelty, in singularity, and variety
of vertebrate structures all that has been contributed from
Australia and New Zealand towards a philosophical comprehension
of the scheme and origin and progress of animated nature.
