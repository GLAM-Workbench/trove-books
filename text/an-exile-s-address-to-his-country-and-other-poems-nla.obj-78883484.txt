INTRODUCTION.
A Li HOUGH thousands of miles divide Irishmen from;
lC|| the land of their birth?that land of patriots and
martyrs, of long suffering and sorrow?still their
hearts and minds travel back in dreams to the glorious-
scenes of their youthful days. There is not an Irishman to
be found in any part of the universe who is not watching
with keen interest the doings and movements of the enemy
in that sainted green isle to-day. For centuries she has
suffered the storms of bloodshed and persecution, and not-
withstanding the progress of civilization, still we find
persecution prolonged by the ruthless enemies of our race.
Then how long, oh God! is the chain of tyranny todiang
heavily around the necks of our noble race ??a race who
fought and won the battles of their persecutors on many a
well-contested field. Still, notwithstanding the sacrifice of
Irish blood in defence of England?s cause, Irishmen are
looked upon by the tyrants of the day as African slaves..
\ et they say that Britons never shall be slaves.
If Ireland then be a part of the British empire, why not
grant Ireland self-government and give Irishmen an oppor-
tunity of elevating themselves in life as they do in other
lands ? Oft have Irishmen saved the honor of England?
they fought and fell at Waterloo and other fields; for


centuries they have befriended England, and why not
England now befriend Ireland by granting her a parliament
in College-green as a reward for past services ? How long
are the tyrants of the day to hold the reins of power ? or is
the state of things that now exist, going to continue for ever ?
Human nature answers?No ! Englishmen are compelled
to emigrate as well as Irishmen, and leave behind them for
ever their native land and scenes of their early days. And
why ? Because they are ground down by the tyrants who
are persecuting Ireland by Coercion rule and banishing her
sons into exile. But the day is not far distant when
Education will bring those proud aristocrats down to their
bearings in England as well as in Ireland. I may venture
to say that Education will be the redemption of the working
classes all over the universe.
Is there any redemption for unhappy Ireland ? Yes ; she
shall yet be free. Time after time the most glorious hopes
have been dashed to the ground ; still, notwithstanding
failures, the spirit of Irishmen remains unconquered. They
are inspired by the spirit of the dead?a spirit urging them
onward to the goal of Victory. Oh ! green-robed Innisfail!
shade of her illustrous dead! I invoke you in her behalf;
break her fetters !
Break her fetters ; let Freedom smile
Upon that ancient, faithful, holy isle
Those few verses of argumentative debate between Pat
O?Brien and the tyrannical Balfour I hope the reader will
find interesting. I have also added a lew verses to this book
written by me for the Newcastle Morning Herald on the day
previous to the arrival of Mr. John Dillon, M.P., in
Newcastle. In those few lines mention is made of the name
of the brave John Mandeville, who sacrificed his life in a
prison cell for no crime but that of advocating the immortal
rights of Irish nationality. The words spoken by the
never-to-be-forgotten Emmett from the Green-street dock,
? The man dies, but his memory lives,? will apply to the
departed John Mandeville. He is dead, but his memory
lives in the hearts of all true Irishmen. Let every Irishman
who reads those few lines fervently pray to the Lord of


Hosts, who delivered the Israelites out of the land of bondage,
to break the tyrants? chain, and put an end for ever to the
misery and tribulation existing in Ireland to-day; and I
myself do most fervently pray for the welfare of my native
land, and may the clouds of darkness which have hung over
the sweet land for ages fade away like the morning dew.
? Goo Save Ireland.?


PREFACE.
3B- TRUST that the reader will excuse any errors that may
appear from the pen of a self-taught man, and I also
trust that the contents of this book will be interesting and
amusing to the minds of those who may peruse it. Born
1863, in Annadown, Galway, Ireland, five Irish miles from
the historic city of the tribes, where the spirit of Irish
nationality has an undying hold. At an early age I was
taught to love my country, and honor the memory of her
departed martyrs, who sacrificed their lives for her sacred
cause. Although seas divide me from that sainted isle
and friends of youth, the love of country instilled
into my mind in my youthful days shall never die. And
I shall never cease to write her praises and in her
defence ; for the warmest aspirations of my life is to see my
native land rise once more to that proud position which she
is entitled to, and see happiness and prosperity for ever
flourish through the land. Although I may never again
behold the scenes of my early days, yet it will be consoling to
ray heart to know that on some glorious future day now
looming in the distance those I have left behind me will
reap the benefits of the golden harvest of victory in triumph
?lreland free, happy, prosperous, and regenerated !
Patrick F. Collins.


Exile?s Address to His Country.
Air ??Eileen Ogue.?
Sad was the hour when you and I parted?
Erin my country a b'essing on thee !
1 wander in exile sad broken-hearted ?
Erin my country a blessing on thee !
For years I?ve travelled the wilds of Australia,
Gray is my hair ; there?s no happiness for me
Since I left dear old Ireland, my own native sireland ?
Erin my country a blessing on thee !
For years cruel tyrants, lov?d land, they?ve spoilt you?
Erin my country a blessing on thee !
Black-hearted traitors through ages beguiled you?
Erin my country a blessing on thee !
When I read of your wrongs in this far distam n. tion,
I question my thoughts are you destined to be
For ever bound down beneath curs?d persecution?
Erin my country a blessing on thee !
I?d give thousands in gold once more to see you?
Erin my country a blessing on thee !
I?d shed my life s blood in aiding to bee you?
Erin my country a b?essmg on thee !
At night when sleeping, while the stars are shining,
I dream of you Ireland far over the sea ;
Will I ever behold you, sweet isle of the ocean?
Erin my country a blessing on thee !
My days are near ended in this world of sorrow?
Erin my country a blessing on thee !
I?m old, I?m feeble, I?ve no hopes in the morrow?
Erin my country a blessing on thee !
I?d wish to be buried beneath my own native shamrock,
But alas ! Ennisfail, I will never be ;
My fond hopes are banished, joys ever vanished ?
Oh! matchless green Eiin, a blessing on thee!
January
10th, 1891.


Send Me a Shamrock From Home.
_ [A Friend leaving Australia for Ireland, the land of his
birth, the writer requested him to send him a shamrock
from home.]
Dear friend ! pray excuse the presumption,
By which I recall to your mind
My last request, made in Port Jackson,
Where you left many friends here behind.
Our acquaintance ever was pleasant,
Your warm heart embolden?d my tone
In requesting when you reach old Erin
You?d send me a shamrock from home.
Chorus.
I trust there?s no need of reminding,
\ our kind heart could ne?er cause delay,
And the promise you know it was binding,
I?d have it on Patrick?s Day.
No present could gold ever have purchased,
Nor pleasure produced by good wine,
Could equal to me the dear shamrock,
Plucked by hands less worthy than thine.
To me, sir, that dear plant?s an emblem
Of Three on the heavenly throne,
To whom Erin has ever been faithful,
Oh ! send me the shamrock from home !
Chorus.
Methinks that the air. in its transit,
Will preserve the dear plant fresh and green.
Since it?s lived thro? the age of transplanting,
?Twill weather the storm now, I ween.
Tho? ten long years have passed over,
Since those alien laws doom?d me to roam,
Still in spirit I dwell in old Ireland?
Do send me the shamrock from home !
Chorus.


No monarch more proud of his crown, sir,
Than I of my shamrock shall be,
And no prodigal son ever more welcom?d,
Than my dear native shamrock to me.
I will first bathe it o?er with my tears,
And commune with the dear thing alone ;
Oh ! I?m sure you?ll never rob me such blisses,
You?ll send me the shamrock from home.
Chorus,
Tho? it?s cruel to tear the dear plant
From the stem that so long kept it green,
Thro? long of trial and oppression,
Whilst now the bright sunburst is seen.
Borne aloft by the sons of old Erin,
Whose patriot spirits ne?er flown ;
And now, as you?re back in their sunshine,
Remember my shamrock from home.
Chorus.
I shall then drink success to my shamrock,
To you and my dear native land,
And the laborers now in the vineyard?
Parnell, and his patriot band.
And another I?ll drink to the memory
The heroes whose spirits have flown
To the region of bliss, while defending
That dear little shamrock from home.
Chorus.
Now I hope, sir, the day?s not far distant,
And that you and I?ll yet live to see
When the shamrock and harp doth emblazon
The flag of the brave and the free.
For no people have ever fought braver,
Nor more perseverance have shown,
But I?ll finish by wishing you near me
When wetting the shamrock from home.
Chorus.
August 2nd, 1886.


The Dying Atheist.
One night in last November, as the sky shone bright and
clear,
The moon fast sinking in the west, cold was the atmosphere ;
The night owls screamed and flew about in wanton joy
and mirth,
The stars, in all their brightness, cast reflections on the
earth.
The hour is twelve ; all gone to rest, to sleep the hours away,
And all within that village seemed as silent as the clay.
Till a human voice this silence broke, by loud and horrid
scream :
A man who never worshipped God, and the subject of my
theme.
This man, a firm atheist, on a bed of sickness lay,
With agonising countenance, life ebbing fast away ;
He had a Christian daughter, on seeing his pains increased,
With lightning speed she left the house and sought a holy
priest.
She pleads, ? My father?s dying, all hope of him is past,
Oh ! come to his bedside, he may be saved at last;
Although a hardened sinner?to the Church a bitter foe,
His sins may yet be cancelled, if, Father, you?ll but go.?
The good priest hastened with the child, her father to console.
Hoping at the eleventh hour to save a sinful soul ;
He calmly urged the dying man that he may now repent?
Prepare his soul to meet his God for a life so badly spent.
With angry voice the dying man cries, ? What has brought
you hear ?
Begone at once and leave this room, I?ve neither hope
nor fear ;
I, who never worshipped God, nor ever knelt to pray,
I cannot now, at my last hour ; I pray thee, go away !?


? Be calm,? the good priest cried, ? bear this one fact in mind:
That Christ, the Saviour, purchased the redemption of
mankind,
And whilst there?s life there yet is hope, I'll wait fur your reply,
I cannot thus be turned away without the reason why.?
There knelt his only daughter, a girl of tender years,
Praying to God to save his soul, in sorrow and in tears.
The priest traversed the cottage floor to beguile the hours
away,
He paused, he stood and listened, he heard the mortal say :
MORTAL.
What are those objects in my room ? Oh ! what do I behold ?
A host of demons round my bed, which makes my blood
run cold ;
I hear a voice, a mocking voice, as if from pole to pole:
? Your glass is run, you man of sin, I'm waiting for your soul.?
DEMON.
I am the mighty Lucifer, ambitious, proud and vain,
Cast from high heaven into hell, there ever to remain;
Rebelled against the Lord of Hosts, creator of land and sea,
The sun, the moon, and countless stars, so joyous once for me.
Having faithfully served me in this life, I?ll reward you in
return,
I?ll take your soul to hell with me, eternally to burn ;
I?ve full possession of you now, there?s none can bar my claim,
Except that priest your daughter called, but only called
in vain.
MORTAL.
Forbear ! forbear ! Oh ! Satan depart and leave this place !
I now believe that Christ has died to redeem the human race.
Oh ! God above, your mercy show a sinful wretch like me,
Too late, alas ! I now confess my wickedness to thee.


The short time now allotted me I will repent and pray,
Confess my sins to the good priest before the dawn of day.
(to, Satan ! thou hast tempted me, with bad thoughts fill?d
my mind,
Thou has sever?d me from Christ?my God, the saviour of
mankind.
His eyes now wandered right and left, he groaned aloud with
pain ;
? av � merc J> mercy oh my God! Come hither daughter Jane J
Go call the good priest to my side, who sought my soul to save,
t or I would my spirit to my God, my body to the grave.?
The good priest, still in waiting, walked to the man?s bedside,
Exhorting him to now confess, and then in God confide.
He did confess, and wept aloud, then heaven?s mercy craved,
He kiss d the cross, he worshipped God, oh ! may that soul
be saved !
He called his daughter to his side, who played a noble part,
And begged her for his soul to pray with fervency of heart.'
This dying man, in prayerful thought, to the good priest
turn?d and said?
? Ma y od * iave m ercy on my soul!? So saying, the spirit fled.
February 18 th, 1891.


Lift Your Head, Dear Erin!
Lift your head, dear Erin,
Oh ! my country, weep no more,
Be once again a nation,
As you?ve been in days of yore.
Your soldiers and your chieftains
Many victories did gain,
Commanded by the great O?Neil
On Clontibret?s lawny plain.
Cast off your chains, Erin dear,
Have Freedom once again,
As in the days when Brian Boru
Fought the pirate heathen Dane.
When his valiant clans cried aloud,
? Death to the Odan race !?
And mowed them down like blades of grass
When they met them face to face.
Your best of sons have fought and died
For that just and holy cause,
And some were banished into exile
For breaking England?s laws.
When Sarsfield fell on a foreign field
He placed on that wound his hand,
Saying, ? Would to Ood this blood was shed
For you, my native land.?
The Wexford men of ninety-eight
They sought to overthrow
The tyrant laws that ground them down,
And filled their land with woe.
They bravely grasped the sword in hand,
They swore they?d never yield,
Oh Innisfail they died for thee,
On gory?s bloody field.


Emmett too, in the bloom of youth.
He bravely died for thee,
His ambition was to free your sons
From the chains of slavery.
Russell and the Bros. Shears,
On the gallows did not quail;
A thousand times they?d die for thee.
My green-robed Innisfail.
Allen, Larken, and O?Brien
Died on the gallows tree,
Within the dark Manchester gaol,
Far from their dear country.
When on the gallows, those loving three
Grasped each other?s hand,
Saying ? God save Ireland ever more ;
Our own dear native land.?
SUPPLICATION.
Oh ! may their last prayer soon be granted.
And their lives not be given in vain ;
May her sons ne?er cease their efforts
Till Ireland?s freedom they regain.
December 11th, 1890.


A National Aspiration.
Air ??The Harp That Once.?
Erin, how long shall we, thy sons,
Mourn thy sad downfall,
And friendless roam o?er land and sea
Thy miseries to recall.
Shall hearts so warm and arms so brave
Both earth and ocean roam,
And live as cuckooes hatched abroad,
Who never knew a home.
The pains of some are eased by time,
But not those of thy sons,
Whose passions but by time inflame
In witnessing thy wrongs.
Are we less brave than were our sires,
Or is our cause less true ;
Or are we not the lineal stock
Of the great Brian Boru !
Our existence we?d sooner doubt
Than our lineage to thee,
Whose cause is engraved on our hearts
To endless memory.
And if the shedding of our blood
Would only make thee free,
Thy sons in pride would all have died
. To gain thy Liberty !

Mother Erin?s Address to Michael Davitt
My noble son! may you live to see
Your mother Erin, a Nation free ;
As I have been in days of old,
In days of heroes and soldiers bold.
Those men who grasped the sword in hand,
And fought and died for their native land?
Oh ! may their spirit from each hollow grave,
Rise like the ocean?s swelling wave.
The tyrant foul may that spirit chase ;
In each Irish heart may it find a place,
Until Innisfail is free from care,
As pure and free as the morning air.
Oh ! Michael Davitt, I appeal to you :
Do not desert me, be ever true,
Advocate my cause as you?ve done before,
Let your voice re-echo from shore to shore.
You, who have suffered in a prison cell,
For that immortal cause you loved so well;
And oft you?ve laboured, with pen and brain,
To redeem me from the tyrant?s chain.
Then, come to my aid ! oh come with speed !
Of your wise counsel I?m now in need ;
In the midst of rivals now take your stand.
And be arbitrator to your native land.
Let all Home Rulers again unite,
And adopt once more the course that?s right;
And if they do, ere long I ween,
We?ll have a Parliament in College-green,
Oh ! Michael Davitt, flower of Mayo !
Sound the death knell of each tyrant foe;
Let my green flag wave o?er land and sea,
Oh ! break my fetters, and my sons are Free !
January 10th, 1891.


A New Version of ? Home Rule for
Ireland Evermore.?
Hibernians one and all, responsive to the call,
Rejoice whilst we the glad news do proclaim,
The Parnellites have spoke, they?ll break the English yoke,
Leaving Ireland a nation once again.
Chorus.
You men of valiant might who fight old Ireland?s fight,
And you who have sent aid from ev?ry shore,
Your names will yet be seen on our flag on College Green
When it?s Home Rule for Ireland evermore.
Chorus.
When Grattan the just found Ireland in the dust,
Resolv?d she?d yield no more to foreign rule,
His Irish volunteers filled England?s heart with fear
And wrested from proud Albion Home Rule.
Chorus.
Still the serpent?s trail haunted poor old Granuaile,
Till by bribery and treachery most cruel
The traitors basely sold for England?s cursed gold
Their own liberty and Ireland?s Home Rule.
Chorus.
May success quickly crown those patriots of renown
Now labouring Erin?s cause to maintain,
And may they live to see the Green Flag floating free
On every tower in Ireland once again.
Chorus.
June Bth, 1888.


Balfour and Pat O?Brien.
Pat O?Brien ;
? Fellow countrymen, come listen to me
If you love freedom and liberty;
Banish for ever that brainless fool
A Balfour, and his Coercion School.
He is now Chief Secretary to this Isle,
And a disgrace to rank and file.
Inspired by malice to the height of fury'
He has deprived the land of trial by jury. ?
Balfour :
? The Irish race I have ever hated,
Hence over the land I have predominated;
I have shed their blood to cool them down,
Right in the streets of Mitchelstown. ?
? Yes! you have, you infamous loon,
Just like a tiger, or fierce baboon;
You have cast a gloom over the nation,
By bloodshed, eviction, and conflagration.
?There is Gladstone also??Grand Old Man,
I will mar his play as well I can;
Let him not think that I?m such a fool
As to grant to Ireland, so called, Home Rule.
? You confiscator ! what do you mean ?
On innocent women you vent your spleen ;
You have tyrannized us without fear of God,
And ruled the country with an iron rod. ?


? Pat! keep your temper, be calm and cool,
It was Salisbury passed Coercion Rule,
And by his aid, whilst I reign
I will crush the League and your Campaign. ?
?The old and feeble, you have their curse,
The orphans also, infinitely worse ;
You have sent us to gaol for shouting ? 800 !?
It?s a fitting honour conferred on you. ?
?It is an honour, Pat, I cannot see,
Befitting to a man like me ;
Please draw near, hear your fate?
All Irishmen I will exterminate.?
?Do your worst, you avaricious man,
Exterminate me if you can ;
Throw off your coat, contest with Pat,
You tyrannising Aristocrat.?
? No, no ! Pat, that I never can,
For I am not a fighting man;
To contest with you I cannot see,
For I am far above your low degree.?
? That insult I will not take from you,
I, a descendant of Brian Boru ;
Put up your hands, don?t hesitate,
You venomous, poisonous reprobate.?
? Let Englishmen know I?m the nation?s friend
If they will listen and comprehend ;
You would ? cut the painter,? that I ween,
If you had a Parliament in College Green.?


? Notwithstanding your stumbling blocks,
We will achieve Home Rule, you cunning fox
On our ancient towers we will yet behold
Our Father?s Ensign of Green and Gold.?
?Not so, Pat, you will never see
Your native land and nation free ;
So cease agitation and give arguing o?er,
You will find no mercy in A. Balfour.?
? Your mercy, Arthur, I do not crave,
Not from such a tyrant knave ;
Think?st you because we are poor,
That your tortures we will endure.?
? I would advise you, Pat, as a friend,
Your speech and manners had better mend
Mse I will give you foreign sense,
If you give me more of your impertinence.?
? If you advise me, Arthur, ? as a friend,?
To such I will not condescend ;
I look upon you, whil?st I pay my rent,
With hatred, scorn, and contempt.
? I will treat you again as before,
A nd march you off to Tullamore,
Where they will neatly cut your hair,
Be the weather foul or fair.?
? I defy you, Arthur, and your threats,.
And police also?your canny pets ;
I care not for your cattish claw,
Or the ruthless tyrants of the law.?


?You conspirator ! do not provoke,
Or I will rise a cloud of smoke ;
I?ll place my soldiers on every hill,
Determined your country?s blood to spill.?
? Is that your game ? you fiendish clown !
To send your soldiers to mow us down ;
You can send them now, as your wish
Is impure, corrupting and heathenish.?
? That is my game. Beware in time !
And steer your course to some foreign clime
Leave the land ?ere it is too late?
I would advise you, Pat, to emigrate.?
? I will not leave my native land,
To wander on a foreign strand ;
Not for you will I cross the sea,
To obey your orders, given ruthlessly.?
? You peace disturber ! just hold your prate,
Or deeds of violence I will perpetrate ;
I will destroy your land?s best sons
With bayonets and fire-spitting guns.?
? Verily, Arthur, I have no fears
For your tnreats of violence or your sneers;
For your deeds on earth you shall groan
When the fiery demon gets his own.?
? Into this world I never came
To be consigned to any fiery flame ;
So you I will torture and agonize,
And shed your blood as a sacrifice.?


? You inhuman monster, reflect and pause !
?Ere you violate God?s holy laws ;
By your Coercion you have naught achieved,
But the curses of those you left bereaved.?
? Pat O?Brien, I cannot see
How their curses could injure me ;
Although their fathers are among the slain,
I look upon them with proud disdain.?
? By all rank herbs and poisoned weeds,
How you glory in inhuman deeds !
I call you naught but a nation?s tool,
Cease tyrannising ! Give us Home Rule.?
? By all that earth holds dear to me,
By all the fishes in the sea ;
By the sun and by the moon,
I shall never grant you such a boon !?
? By my brave ancestors ! you shall see
That we are determined to be free ;
Leave the land, or I will end your strife,
Do not torment our future life.?
[Seizes Balfour by the
throat.
? Oh ! Pat O?Brien, let go my throat,
And I will swear by a solemn oath
That I will resign and leave this shore?
So farewell, Pat, for evermore !?
Erin.
? Oh ! Patey darlint, Gra-ma-chree,
You have gained a glorious victory ;
Your name and fame will ever shine,
Three hearty cheers for Pat O?Brien !?


Lines of Welcome to J. Dillon,
M.P
[Written by P. F. Collins for the Newcastle
Herald on the day previous to the arrival of Mr.
Morning
Dillon in
Newcastle.]
Welcome, Dillon, brave and true !
Deasy, Esmonde, welcome too !
To this sunny land of ours,
Golden land of fruit and flowers.
Tell us all of Erin?s woes?
Cruel evictions, brutal blows.
Tell us of the crowbar gang
And of Balfour?s poisoned fang.
Tell us of Coercion rule,
Of Rowdy Roche, Balfourian tool.
Tell us of the brave O?Brien,
Pale and worn in prison lying.
Tell us then of Mitchelstown?
Patriot men like dogs shot down ;
Remind us of John Mandeville?s fate,
Who died within a prison gate.
Tell us all of Donegal,
Of smoky hut and muddy wall ;
Men oppressed and forced to feed
On rare shell-fish and rank sea-weed.
Now, then, Erin?s sons awake!
Make Ireland?s land grabbers quake !
Balfour also (ruthless villain) ?
God Save Ireland !!
And John Dillon !!!


Death?s the End ot All That?s Life.
" ? 1 oo^O^Q�
Air?? Tell Me Not in Mournful Numbers.?
Man must die, there?s nothing surer,
But he knows not when nor where,
In the height of pomp and pride
He must leave behind all wealth and care.
The bravest man in any nation,
Crowned with honours from the battlefield,
Although in life he has been victorious,
Yet at last to death must yield.
The proud and vain, never dreaming
That grim death is drawing near,
They persecute a fellow creature,
Treat the poor with a contemptuous sneer.
Death alone treats all men equal,
It spares no mortal king or queen ;
Death?s the end of all that?s life?
Lives shall wither though now so green.
On land or on the ocean.
Death is active everywhere,
By the loss of friend or parent
We cry aloud in deep despair ;
But they?re only gone before us,
Short?s our days on earth we know,
The predistant hour is fast approaching
When death will strike its fatal blow.
The greatest monarch in any kingdom,
Proudly seated upon his throne,
Though guarded by ten thousand soldiers
Grim death enters to claim its own.
As day after day are passing over,
Death is closing around us fast;
Sinners, pause if you?ve wronged your neighbour,
Make some atonement for the past.


Oh, mortal man, do not be selfish !
Thou art but a fist of clay !
Dark death yet will overcome thee,
Your flesh will melt and bones decay.
Do not aspire for too much riches,
Extend your hand to help the poor ;
Do not despise a fellow creature
Who seeks assistance at your door.
Help him according to circumstances,
Love your neighbour as men should do?
Act the part of the good Samarian,
Be a Christian staunch and true.
When your days on earth are ending,
When death?s approaching to claim it?s due,
It will console you at your last moments
That you?ve done in life as men should do.

Hope Consoles the Heart and Mind
In all avenues of labour
Men are ever seeking gain,
Some are seeking wealth and pleasure,
Some for ever seek in vain.
Although in life we meet misfortunes,
We are happy and resigned
By the thoughts of a better morrow?
Hope consoles the heart and mind.
Then let us be ever active
Through the rugged path of life,
Let us not be ever absent
From the middle of the strife;
Hoping for bright and better days,
Leaving all the past behind,
Ever thinking of the future?
Hope consoles the heart mind.
Let us labour late and early,
Day by day, week after week,
By energy and perseverance
We can attain the end we seek.
Men leave home and friends behind them.
Happiness in other lands to find,
To seek their fortune beyond the ocean?
Hope consoles the heart and mind.
Some men wish for fame and honors,
Others wish for gold in store
Until their days on earth are ended.
When they?ll cease to wish no more.
Falter not in your endeavours,
Providence may yet prove kind,
Heed the maxim, it?s a moral?
Hope consoles the heart and mind.


Let us hope though temptests gather.
Though our past efforts were in vain.
Fight the battle still mc*e bravely,
Well never conquer if we refrain.
We live in hopes as days pass over,
Making life?s rough path refined,
Until we reach the predestin?d moment?
Hope consoles the heart and mind.

Burns? ?Man Was Made to Mourn? Refuted;
Man Was Not Made to Mourn.
Man, the noblest work of God, King of the whole creation,
1 ho formed last is first in rank and endless as duration ;
Since man was no abject slave, no tyrant?s law to spurn,
I hen why should man in pomp and pride write man was
made to mourn !
The chain suspended from on high which links all creation,
'lake man away, you break that tie; what an exalted
station !
k>ut if that man was Nature?s man, and of its vital spark to
burn,
I hen justly might the poet write that man was made to
mourn.
When trusted man violated trust which made the Father fret,
The Son, seeing no recompense in man, says, ?I?ll nay
the debt!?
Oh, what a fount of love and joy he purchased man?s return,
Which obviously refutes the phrase that man was made
to mourn.
What pleasure to a loving God to make a weeping thing
Afflict by pain, compel in chains his homages to bring.
Such blind philosophy as that the God of love doth spurn,
The phrase is a blasphemous one : man was not made
to mourn !
I think I hear a queriest ask, Has the debt been paid ?
Oh yes, ?twas paid a thousandfold; thou need?st not be
afraid,
The faithful promise was fulfilled, he left us not forlorn,
Yet angels could not understand that God for man should
mourn.


The sun forsook the August scene, new midnight veiled
his face;
Soul! did?st thou fly thy Maker?s pain whil?st he redeemed
our race !
Or start?st thou at the guilty load which on the cross was
borne!
Hell howled because the phrase was false that man was
made to mourn.
His mighty power o?erwhelmed the cross and made creation
groan,
He has burst earth?s great marble tomb our crimes to atone.
Heaven wept that man might smile, a glorious news to learn,
His words, suspended from the cross, proved man?s not
made to mourn.
Oh, aged sire with trembling limbs shrunk eyes and hoary
hair,
Thy noble brows well furrowed o?er by years of worldly care,
Be this thy consolation ??tis never too late to learn :
That Jesus died and paid the debt, man was not made to
mourn.
Hell though made of offending man, man was not made for it,-
God never gave his image life to fill that burning pit.
Whilst warring in this world of care, where ills like years
return,
Reverse the phrase, ?twill cheer thee on, man was not made
to mourn.
Trials and troubles we may have numerous as the sand,
Sever?d from every friendly tie, even our native land,
When man violates his Maker?s law in this probatory sojourn,
Unjustly treats his fellow man, ?tis man makes man to mourn.
The predestined hour will come at last when worldly cares
will end,
From this sea of storms we?ll then be freed by death, the
poor man?s friend;
The joyful tidings we shall hear at the end of our sojourn :
? Come ye blessed of my sire?you were not made to
mourn !?
April 6th, 1890.


The Irish Land League.
Arise Hibernia?s gallant sons wherever you may be,
And send your voice of sympathy across the trackless sea !
Expressive of your confidence in those who fight so well,
I mean that gallant band of men led on by brave Parnell.
The fearful odds they fight against yet hems them in
their den,
The bars for centuries held safe are now declared too thin ;
The prescribed rules of battle changed to guard the
tyrant well,
And save them from the grand attacks led on by brave
Parnell.
Oh, where?s that vaunted fair play which England boasts
the while,
Is nowhere more conspicuous than in this British Isle !
Away such empty, boastings, the House has rang its knell,
The laws of right they?ve put to flight to ave them from
Parnell.
Freedom of speech, proud England?s boast?a thing now of
the past,
'The tyrants have by brutal force chain?d liberty at last;
Expelled by force that gallant host, who plead their cause
so well, ?
Those patriots of Irek*nd, led on by brave Parnell
Then send a cheer across the sea, ?twill aid them in
this fight,
And send this prayer to heaven with me ?? May God
defend the right ? ;
And send your contributions too, tyranny to expel,
And aid that gallant band of men led on by brave Parnell.


Now success to the Land League, may heaven defend its
cause,
And guard the leaders in their trials from violating the laws,
For that is what the tyrants seek?a prteext to expel,
And shed the patriot blood of those led on by brave Parnell.
Tho? last not least the Ladies? League-?our sisters now in
arms.
Whose courage shed, if possible, more lustre on their charms;
The aid they give and its extent some future bard shall tell,
Whilst led by Ireland?s Joan of Arc, sister to brave Parnell.
August 15 th, 1885.


An Irish Exile?s Fate.
A heartrending eviction one day took place-
In the County of Donegal,
The houses fired, the flames rose high
And the roofs commenced to fall.
As the crackling fire with fury raged
It was painful to behold,
And hear the cries of children,
Of the feeble and the old.
A gray haired man gazed on his home
Enveloped in flames of fire,
And by his side there stood his son
Who thus addressed his sire?
? Oh, father, dear, do not lament,
To sorrow do not give way,
For I will revenge this foul deed
Ere the dawn of the coming day.?
? My son, my son, ? the old man cried,.
? Remember the hangman?s rope;
Be calm and cool, do nothing rash,
You are now our only hope.
The God above, the Lord of Hosts,
To him I kneel and pray,
Him alone can revenge our loss
On the great tribunal day.?
?Father, ? cried the youthful son,
? In this land I cannot stay
To witness scenes of fire and blood
As I witnessed them to-day.
So, father dear, hear me out,
To Australia I will go,
And seek my fortune in that lamb
Far from this scene of woe. ?


The father answered ?Be it so,
My son, I will not detain,
Although God knows it will break our hearts
And cause us grief and pain.?
? Console yourself, now, father dear,
Do not shed such tears,
For I will return to my native land
In the course of a few years. ?
The morning came to bid farewell
To friends he loved so dear,
But of the fate awating him
The reader yet shall hear.
His blood felt cold, his limbs grew weak,
There was sorrow in his face,
As he gave his dear old parents
A long, loving, last embrace.
He landed safe in Moreton Bay
In August eighty-two,
And travelled over one hundred miles
In search of work to do.
At last he found employment
On a station near Lismore,
Where he laboured late and early
Until eighteen eighty-four.
One morning he sought the overseer
These words to him did say,
? Write out my cheque, pay me off,
To-morrow I?m going away.
For young men are leavb g Brisbane
In hundreds, I am told,
And going away to Kimberley
In search of hidden gold.?
He set out next morning
Just by the break of day,
And to the shipping office
He went without delay.
His heart within him leaped with joy
As others joined him there,
And from Brisbane straight to Normanton
He paid his passage fare.


He started off for Kimberley
And travelled night and day,
The thoughts of fortune and of home
Consoled him on the way :
He reached his destination,
But, alas ! what met him there ?
It was bitter disappointment,
Sorrow and despair.
He retraced his steps to Normanton
Upon the following day,
But as night came on he missed the track
And got lost upon the way.
For days he wandered up and down,
Not knowing where to go,
Grief was heavy at his heart,
And tears commenced to flow.
?Would to God, ? this young man cried,
? That I never left my home,
To die of hunger in this land
Where the idle savage roam.?
He spread his blanket beneath a tree,
Saying here I am going to die:
Too late, alas, there came at last
Two young men passing by.
? Water, ? gasped the dying man,
?Oh, bring me water I implore,
My tongue is swelled within my head,
My limbs are stiff and sore.?
They pressed the water to his lips
In hope his life to save,
But it was the last he ever drank,
On this side of the grave.
With a faint voice he spoke these words,
? Would you be so kind
As to put your hand into my breast,
And a letter there you, will find;
Inform my parents in Donegal
That my days on earth are done,
That never more will they behold
Their dear and loving son.?


His frame shook, his pale lips moved,
He cried out in despair,
? Receive my soul in heaven,
Lord, God, hear my prayer,??
His broad chest heaved, his eyes grew dim,
The young man knelt to pray,
Ai d ere they arose his sacre l soul
From earth had passed away.
They buried him deep beneath a tree
That grows on rising ground,
He will rise one day from beneath the clay
When Michael?s trumpet sounds.
Then let us pray to God on high,
Who died for our souls to save.
That no tyrant?s hand ever disturb
Young Johii O?Donnell?s grave.


The Casteration Hall; or, Hall of Science]
[The following verses were suggested by an article in tho
Liberator , of November 22, 1890, by Joseph - Symes :
? . . And now listen! Yes, even prudes and parsons
had better listen. Science must take the vicious, the
criminal classes, and the consumptives in hand?and make
them sterile ! Yes, take from them the power to reproduce
kind.?]
As themes that?s new are all the rage,
I?ll venture a few lines
About a social democrat,
Well known as Joseph Symes.
This theorist lately has evolved,
For good of one and all,
From Joseph Symes to holy Joe
Of Casteration Hall,
Chorus.
So if you?d know his whereabouts,
And wish to make a call,
Just ask the boys for holy Joe
Of Casteration Hall.
The great physician, Dr. Koch,
His secrets now can go ;
A more effective cure we?ve got,
Direct from holy Joe,
Whose name is now immortalised,-
Years hence will but recall
The debt we owe to holy Joe
Of Casteration Hall.
Chorus.


The Mai thus theory?s in the shade ;
Bradlaugh?Desant?s also,
For all social reformers are
Eclipsed by holy Joe.
The sick and weakly of our race
Have but to make a call,
And there receive the antidote
Of Casteration Hall.
Chorus.
'?Tis said he?ll practice on his dupes
To prove his social scheme,
Whose intellects are truly weak?
Fit subjects for the theme.
Besides, ?tis only just and fair,
Whatever chance befall,
That those who pay the piper dance
At Casteration Hall.
Chorus.
When charity?s exercised at hpme,
?Tis said we then shall know
The secrets of the social scheme
Set forth by holy Joe.
The boon, meanwhile, of priceless worth
When open unto all,
Must surely fill the coffers of
The Casteration Hall.
Chorus,
No more deformed or weakly folks
Shall dwell in our nation,
They must be brought, cost what it may,
To cheque generation.
No more asylums we shall need,
Nor hospitals withal,
For all must go to holy Joe
Of Casteration Hall.
Chorus.
?2Sth January, 18!) 1.


The Melbourne Strike,
You Working Men of Melbourne,
Once more I say, Unite
And show those wealthy tyrants
That you are determined to fight.
Tell those men that you mean to win
On Labour?s battle-field,
Or sacrifice all earthly things
And die before you yield.
Some of you men once left your home
And crossed the angry waves,
And found a home in this sunny land
Where Britons shan?t be slaves.
We must be free as men should be,
Our just rights to maintain,
Then sound the labour war cry
Over continent and main.
Your fathers in the days of old
As all 'of you well know,
Were slaves beneath those wealthy lords,
Who neither plough nor sow.
They live by you, poor working men,
On the fruits of your hard toil;
Be firm, then, do not give in,
Prove faithful and be loyal.
The rich man lives in a marble hall,
With luxuries all around,
Your daughters serve him at his board
And mend his lady?s gown.
Each night at nine he drinks his wine
And smacks his lips with glee,.
Whilst the working man for ever lives
In want and misery.


On Eight Hours? Day demonstrate
That you are determined to be free,
That the state of things that now exist
Shall no longer be.
Then lift your banner up on high
And march in grand array ;
No matter what Duncan Gillies
Or Colonel Price may say.
Then celebrate both one and all
This glorious Eight Hours? Day,
In defiance of those who would shoot you down
If they had but their own way.
They may say ?Fire low, and lay them out !?
But mark well what I say,
Retaliate and pay them back
On the next election day.
September 20th 1890.


A Word on the Society of Irish National
Foresters.
an Irishman, I feel as if in duty bound to expound to
Irishmen and men of Irish descent over all the world
the aims, objects and aspirations of the above Society. Prior
to the year 1877 the only benefit society that existed in
Ireland?so far as I am aware?was the Ancient Order of
Foresters. In that same year Sargeant McCarty, Daniel
Redden, Michael Davitt, and other political prisoners were
released from English dungeons to breathe once more the air
of freedom, on Irish soil, Consequently a public demonstra-
tion took place in Dublin, which marched in procession
through the principal streets of the city. In that procession
the members of the Ancient Order of Foresters took an active
part, jubilant at the release of their country?s noblest sons.
A few prejudiced and narrow-minded members of the ancient
order in the north of Ireland wrote to the Executive Council
in London, and yelled in fierce denunciation of the members
of the Dublin branch for taking part in, as they termed it, a
disgraceful street procession, and informed them that they
would not or could not tolerate such conduct. The Executive
Council, in reply, wrote to the members of the Dublin
)ranch informing them that the next time they brought the
branch down to such a disgraceful degree they would expel
them from the society and cut them off from all benefits
therefrom. This slur cast upon them was more than human
natuie or Irish blood could endure. The consequence was
that those insulted members waited upon the leading


Nationists of Dublin, in the hope of discovering some means
of redressing their grievance. The answer that they received
was this:?? Have you not men enough in your country to
form a society of your own ? You want to be Foresters and
Nationalists; then there is your society already named?the
Irish National Foresters. They accepted this advice, and
adopting means to establish themselves as Irish National
Foresters registered under the Friendly Societies? Act. In
the latter end of 1877 the first branch was formed in Dublin,
and in the following year several branches were also formed
in England, Scotland and Wales. In England since June,
1890, up to the present day the society shows an increase of
50 branches and 3000 members. In Cape Colony they have
formed four branches, and in America the society is making
rapid strides.
The first branch formed in Australia was in Melbourne in
1886. From that time up to the present the society has
progressed by leaps and bounds beneath the shadow of the
Southern Cross. In Melbourne the society can boast of nine
branches, bearing the names of Ireland?s most illustrious
sons:?The Robert Emmet Branch, Henry Grattan Branch,
Daniel O?Connell Branch, Michael Davitt Branch, C. S.
Parnell Branch, John Dillon Branch, John Mitchell Branch,
Joseph Biggar Branch, and Patrick Sarsfield Branch.
Seeing the progress the society has made during this short
period of time, I can confidently prognosticate that the Irish
National Foresters will become the greatest Irish benefit
society the world ever knew. And I trust and hope that the
day is not far distant when I shall hear of branches formed
all over the Australian colonies, bearing the names of the
countless illustrious Irishmen who suffered and sacrificed
their lives for old Ireland?s sacred cause. There are neither
pass-words nor secrets connected with this society. It is
exclusively Irish?that is to say, Irishmen and men of Irish
descent. It is also non-sectarian, and its motto is ?Unity,
Nationality, Benevolence and Fraternity.? ?I am and
always have been of opinion,? said his Grace the Most Rev.
Dr, Croke, Archbishop of Cashel, ? that the Irish National
Foresters? Benefit Society is a most useful organisation, being


as I believe of a purely benevolent character, pursuing it- 8
aims openly in the light of day, and wholly free from the
taint of that pernicious secrecy which the Church so properly
condemns.?
Lach member is in duty bound to aid brethren in distress:
sympathise with dear old Ireland in her trials and tribula-
tions, and hpnor the memory of her poets, bards, patriots and
martyrs; aid in the restoration of their down-trodden
countrymen at home, as far as circumstances will allow; and
earnestly and patiently await the dawn of Ireland?s inde-
pendence.
Ihe society is unlimited in number as to members, as
well as in its number of branches and districts; it is
governed by at Executive Council and a Board of Directors.
Jhe Executive Council consists of the following officers:
'o h i ef (HC.R.), High Sub-Chief Banger
(H.S.C.K.) General Secretary (G.S.), Treasurer to the
Executive Council (E.C.T.), Woodward to the Executive
E.C.W.), and Beadle to the Executive Council (E.C.8.).
Any Irishman in any part of the Australian colonies desirous
of joining or forming a branch of this society should corres-
pond with the editor of the Melbourne Advocate, who will
inform him, in ? answers to correspondents,? the name and
address of the General Secretary for all branches in Melbourne,
and also full particulars concerning the Society. I fail to see
why Irishmen and men of Irish race should hesitate in
becoming members of the society. I think it is the dutv
of every Irishman who sympathises with the ? Green Isle?
to participate in forming branches of the society, as it will be
the best means of uniting the scattered race in one grand
brotherhood in all parts of the world where Irishmen exist.
In the Assembly rooms of the Irish National Foresters?
what do Irishmen behold as they enter ? They behold the
emblems so dear to their fathers in days gone by. Those
emblems recall to the mind of the Irish exile the scenes of
his youth and the love that he owes his native land. In
that assembly room behold the flag that waved so proudly
over Limerick city where the women fought with the men
and rooted the enemy from within its walls ; that flag beneath


which Sarsfiold fought at Aughrim and many a well con-
tested field ; that flag raised on high by the immortal
Father Murphy at Enniscorthy, Vinegar Hill, and Wexford
town ; that flag carrried by the Iri-eh Brigade to victory on
tne bloody field of Fontenoy, when they conquered the
enemy and saved the honrr of France ; that flag which ere
long will float proudly in the breeze over an Irish Parliament
in College Green.
Irishmen, then rally around the standard of Irish "National
Forestry, and demonstrate to the world that you are proud
of the land from which you have sprung, and that you are
men worthy of your name and race.
As my eyes truly indicate the hour being past midnight,
when body and mind need repose, I must therefore come to
a close, asking you to join me in the prayer, ? Ireland a
Nation Once Again,? adieu !
PATRICK F. COLLINS.


Lord
Salisbury Jubilant by the Split
in the
Irish Party.
Lord Salisbury is on the spree,
With a Tory host around him;
r the brave, a vicious knave,
In the height of glee has found him.
My worthy B , thus spoke he :
In Ireland they are rioting?
My trusty friend, you comprehend?
Amongst themselves they are fighting.
Now Parnel he wants to be
Still leader of the party,
His eyes are dim, they blinded him,
Did the supporters of McCarthy. ?
He must give in?man of sin !
If he gives us any lingo
We?ll put him out, without a doubt,
We?ll do it, by Saint Jingo.
Then we?ll be for ever free
From this man of iron will ;
We?ll coerce again, hill and plain,
We?ll slaughter and we?ll kill.
Pat and Kate must emigrate
From valley, hill and plain ;
hrom Dublin down to Derry town,
From Limerick to Coleraine.
Arthur dear, be of good cheer,
My cunningness will tire them ;
My aim is true, my bullets too,
Whenever I can fire them.
The truth I speak, that?s what I seek
You know I find delight in
Ihe O?s, the Mc?s, Pats and Jacks,
Like Kilkenny cats a-fighting.


Then Balfour spoke, shook his cloak,
His heart as light as feather;
The moon shone bright, that very night,,
As they counselled there together.
Said he : My Lord, a grand reward
Is the fruits of all our plotting?
Ireland mown, dissension sown,
Her sons in gaol are rotting.
I feel so glad, I do by-dad,
Exclaimed the tyrant Lord,
It consoles my mind to leave behind
A great and grand record.
Then fill a glass, let it pass,
We?ll drink both night and day, sir;?
Here?s to the fold that bought with gold
The great warrior, O?Shay sir.
The Times failed and Piggot sailed
Across the sea to Spain, sir;
An ounce of lead pierced his head,
He blew out his brains, sir.
I?ve fired a gun and I?ve won, ?
I?ll urge them on to crime, sir ;
Let Ireland groan, she?ll be our own
In some good future time, sir.
Good-night, Balfour, I?ll say no more,,
I?ll meet you in the house, sir;
In my dreams I?m plotting schemes,
I?m as cunning as a mouse, sir.
The Times subscribe in aid of bribe,
A hundred more has joined, sir ;
We?ll gain our end, trust me, friend.
By fraud and force combined, sir..
May 6th, 1891.


Ireland?s Patriot Martyrs.
to thy slumbers, immortal hero of 1803 He
wh ? fcrificed his precious life for the cause he loved
a , cherished. He who would dispute every inch of
ground ere the enemy should set foot on the land he so
dearly loved. For loving that land he was tried, condemned
and executed by order of the monstrous Judge Norburv*
whose name can only be mentioned through a mist of blood
that hangs over Green Street Court. That extreme love of
country forced him across the ocean to seek the aid of Foreign
owers, in order to deliver his country from the chains of
bondage, and take her place among the nations of the earth.
Although eighty-eight years have passed since the execu-
tioners axe severed the head from his body, yet his memory
is fresh and green in the hearts of all true Irishmen and
Irishwomen, and will flourish to the end of time. Let us
t, n . P ra 7 aJ id hope that the day is not far distant when the
glorious hopes of his life shall be fully realised, and a fitting
monument raised on high in commemoration of his life and
t eath. You are dead, but not forgotten. Peace to your
shade, Robert Emmett. y
Peace to your slumbers. Wolf Tone, Lord Edward, Orr,
and Russell, who bravely died for our country's cause. Look
Lr happy countrj ? 9tm groanin �
Peace to your slumbers, Allan, Larkin, and O?Brien, who
sacrificed your lives on the Manchester Scaffold, far from the
home of your fathers and loving friends. You, who so nobly
lescued Deasy and the gallant Colonel Kelly from the
tortures of an English dungeon. Your names have never
been forgotten, and your dying prayers will be repeated until
Aui! nd u� f time ,' Slee P on ! Allan > La rkin, and O?Brien.
Although your bodies lie deep in English soil, your spirits
live in Ireland to-day. ?
Last of all: Peace to your slumber, John Mandeville, who
dmd a victim to the monstrous Balfourian Coercion Rule,
am. left a loving wife to mourn his loss in the bloom df youth,
bus, by the death of John Mandeville, one more gloaous
name is added to the long, long list of Erin?s Martyrs


Irishmen ! While the memory of those departed heroes of
your country remain fresh in your minds, it will ever inspire
you to aid your country as far as circumstances will allow ;
and, suffice it to say, the Irishmen of Australia have nobly
aided the cause of Ireland in the past. They have fully
demonstrated to the world that an Irishman loves his country
next to his God
Let us then honour the memory of those departed Martyrs
?by adiing the cause of our country until victory is achieved l ?
They are dead ; but their spirit lives, and unconquered.
They died for that cause?that seemingly lost cause?
But a cause that shall yet be won !
Unhappy Ireland ! May she ever have such men as those
ever ready to follow in their footsteps, and lack nothing of
their undying spirit. Hoping, then, that Ireland will yet
be happy, prosperous and free, when her present tyrants go
down for ever into the limbo of oblivion, and all that will
remain to show that they once lived will be the memory of
their heartrending earthly deeds.
They rose in days when monsters reigned,
To fight their country?s battle ;
When tyrants tortured young and old,
And slaughtered them like cattle.
They are dead, but their spirit lives,
It will haunt Coercion knaves,
Until Freedom smiles on Erin?s Isle
With her sons no longer slaves.

FOOT COSTUMIER.
PRIZE
Brilliant Success of as. Australian Artisan.
First Honors Against the World.
Mb. J. M. Kelly, the well-known Boot and
Shoe Maker, of Truphit House, 214 Kussell-street,
is an artisan of whom the colony may well feel
proud, as he furnishes a splendid example of what
can be accomplished by the application of steady
perseverance, artistic skill, and a determination to
excel. Step by step he has stubbornly contested
the right to the first position of honour at some of
the world?s great exhibitions during the last few
years, and has on each occasion been rewarded
with victory, his noteworthy successes being?
First Prize at the great Indian and Colonial
Exhibition, London, 1886, and First Prize Adelaide
Exhibition, 1887. To these have been added the
first honours of our own great Exhibition, in the
face of unexpected difficulties, as the following
Will show:?
Melbourne, February 16,1889.
SIR,?I have the honour, by direction of the
