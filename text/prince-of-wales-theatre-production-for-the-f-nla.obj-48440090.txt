** The mat for root —for dross the fresh gnatoo, — ! And sandal oil to fence against the dew ;
For food, the cocoa nut—the yam—the bread; The gourd with water, recent from the rill,—
Born of the fruit —for board the plantain’s spread, The ripe Banana from the mellow bill—
With its broad leaf—or turtle shell—which bore A pine torch pile to keep undying light,
A banquet in the flesh it covered o’er. And she herself as beautiful a* night.”
