PRINTED BY R HORNE, BRIDGE STREET.


At a Meeting of the Members of the Whitby
Literary and Philosophical Society, held on
Tuesday, the 29 th day of March, 1853, Dr.
Merryweather was introduced by the Presi-
dent, Henry Belcher, Hsq.
Ladies and Gentlemen ;?I have to bespeak your
kind attention to a Lecture, proposed to be given by
Dr. Merryweather, on the interesting subject of,
? Gold and Iron.? The mention of these two names
is, of itself, sufficient to recommend the Lecture to
your earnest attention, and I have no doubt but that
the various facts which will be brought before you,
by the Doctor, will add still more to that general
interest which the subject may excite. I will not
detain you, but resign my place to the Doctor.




%. Disquisition
CONCERNING
GOLD AND IRON.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen,
It is now about twenty years since I had the
honour of delivering a Lecture before this Society, on
the metal Platina, the most ponderous of all metals,
its specific gravity being 21 ?5. I then explained by
what means I had been enabled to make a fire, by
the aid of this substance, which could be kept at a
red heat, for any length of time, without personal
attendance, and that by this means, I was fortunate
enough to solve the problem of Uniform Temperature.
It is, at present, my intention to endeavour to
entertain you with some account of two other metals,
namely, Gold and Iron, the specific gravity of the
former being 19 - 3, and of the latter 7'7 . As these
subjects would be too long for one Lecture, I beg of
you to consider this as merely an introductory one.


In the year 1745, there was a country lad, about
17 years old, called Jem Cook, the son of a farmer?s
labourer, at Ayton, in Cleveland. This lad made his
appearance at Staithcs, a fishing town, about half a
score miles north-west of Whitby, for the purpose of
initiation in the mysteries of a shopkeeper. After
a little time, Jem became the companion of the fisher-
men and sailors, and not having any predilection for
standing behind a counter, he took every opportunity
he could avail himself of, to accompany these hardy
and adventurous sons of the ocean, in their excursions
along the romantic and ironbound cliffs of Staithes
and Runswick. Mr. Sanderson, Jem?s master, per-
ceiving something in the lad more adapted for entei-
prise than for his tranquil mode of life, to his honour,
introduced him to Capt. John Walker, a shipowner at
Whitby, a man of the highest respectability. With
this gentleman, Cook served his apprenticeship. In
1752, Capt. Walker, engaged James Cook as mate,
to a 400 tons ship, employed in the Coal trade, and
was so much pleased with his intelligence, activity,
and steadiness of character, that he decided upon
making him commander of this ship. But Cook
having a higher ambition, entered the Royal -Navy in
1755. From this point, by good and clever conduct
he worked his way, and after obtaining the good
wishes and friendship of his superior officers, was

made Lieutenant in 1768, in order to take the com-
mand of a ship of discovery, to proceed to the
Southern Hemisphere. As Lieutenant Cook had the
privilege from Government, of choosing his own ship,
he determined to select the best vessel it was possible
to obtain, and purchased the Endeavour of 370 tons,
built at Whitby.
After the Endeavour had been equipped at Deptford
Lieutenant Cook commenced his voyage from London
on the 30th of July, 1768. On the 28th of April,
1770, he planted the British standard on the Austra-
lian shores, and took possession of that glorious
country, in the name of his Britannic Majesty, a
country more than twenty-five times larger than tho
British Isles. There are many persons living, who
were in existence when this native of the north riding
of Yorkshire secured to this realm, that El Dorado.
The mineral wealth of that land was all there when
Cook took possession of it. Geology was scarcely
known as a science then, and that science has only
just opened out the immense treasures of those golden
regions. It was only last month that a single ship,
the Australian, arrived in London, bringing upwards
of a million pounds sterling in gold, ten tons weight
of which was deposited in the Bank of England,
This ship also brought a present to our beloved Queen,
in the form of a nugget of pure gold, of the weight


of twenty-eight pounds. This Ilesperidian fruit was
an appropriate mark of respect, to send to the Grand-
daughter of the monarch, who first obtained posses-
sion of those golden regions.
The calculations are, that we shall receive annually,
from Australia, twelve to twenty millions sterling,
the product of that wonderful country. But when
we consider the instinctive love of the human race
for gold, in preference to all other commodities, and
when we behold the immense tide of population that
is flowing to those distant shores, the majority of
whom, will not rest satisfied until they have tried their
hands at the diggings; and when we imagine such a
multitude of human beings intent upon such an object
and in a country, where the other day, a single nugget
of pure gold was found of forty-six pounds weight,
I think that twenty millions sterling, will not he the
maximum that reaches this country, annually.
These are strange and most eventful times: only
imagine a cargo of nine hundred young ladies, at
present preparing to go out to this garden of the
Hesperides, under the command of the admirable Mrs.
Chisholm. Doubtless, this example will be extensively
followed, when the ladies of this country hear of the
happy marriages of the first embarkation. As the
time is fast approaching when the fair sex will plume
themselves on becoming birds of passage, it behoves


all bachelors to look out in time, or they will be left
in the lurch, or will have to follow, and be obliged to
bend the knee to the golden calf, before they can rise
to obtain the lady?s hand. Besides, people need not
be afraid, in these halcyon days, of large families, for
Australia will want all they can spare. Then the
colonists will sing with the Psalmist: ?Thy wife shall
be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house: thy
children like olive plants round about thy table :
happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them.?
These are glorious results to emanate from a poor
peasant boy, who was born at Marton, in Cleveland,
on the 27th of October, 1728 ; taught to read and
write at Ayton ; learned to row and steer a boat at
Staithes ; also obtained a knowledge of Navigation,
and how to thoroughly understand and manage a ship,
at Whitby.
Listen to what this illustrious navigator says of
himself, and of Whitby, after his return from his
second voyage round the world : ? Upon the whole,
I am firmly of opinion, that no ships are so proper
for discoveries in distant unknown parts, as those
constructed as was the Endeavour, in which I per-
formed my former voyage. For no ships of any other
kind can contain stores and provisions sufficient (in
proportion to the number of men,) considering the
length of time it will be necessary they should last*


Hence it may bo concluded, so little progress had been
hitherto made in discoveries in the southern hemis-
phere : for all ships which attempted it before the
Endeavour, were unfit for it ; although the officers
employed in them, had done the utmost in their
power. It was upon these considerations, that the
Endeavour was chosen for that voyage. It was to
these properties in her, that those on hoard owed their
preservation ; and hence we were enabled to pro-
secute discoveries in those seas, so much longer than
any other ship ever did, or could do. And although
discovery was not the first object of that voyage, I
could venture to traverse a far greater space of sea,
fill then unnavigated, to discover greater tracks of
country in high and low south latitudes, and to per-
severe longer in exploring and surveying more cor-
rectly these extensive coasts of those new-discovered
countries, than any former navigator, perhaps had
done during one voyage. In short, these properties
in the ships, with perseverance and resolution in the
commanders, will enable them to execute their orders;
to go beyond former discoverers ; and continue to
Britain, the reputation of taking the lead of all nations
in exploring the globe.
?These considerations concurring with Lord Sand-
wich?s opinion on the same subject, the Admiralty
determined to have two such ships as are here recom-


mended. Accordingly, two were purchased. They
were both built at Whitby, by the same person who
built the Endeavour. The largest of the two was
462 tons burthen. She was named Resolution ; and
sent to Deptford to he equipped. The other was 336
tons burthen. She was named Adventure ; and was
sent to he equipped at Woolwich,
? And now it may he necessary to say, that, as I
am on the point of sailing on a third expedition, I
leave this account of my last voyage in the hands of
some friends, who in my absence have kindly accepted
the office of correcting the press for me ; who are
pleased to think, that what I have here to relate,
is better to be given in my own words, than in the
words of another person ; especially as it is a work
designed for information, and not merely for amuse-
ment ; in which, it is their opinion, that candour and
fidelity will counterbalance the want of ornament.
? I shall therefore conclude this introductory dis-
course with desiring the readers to excuse the inac-
curacy of style, which doubtless he will frequently
meet with in the following narrative ; and that, when
such occurs, he will recollect that it is the production
of a man, who has not had the advantage of much
school education, hut who has been constantly at sea
from his youth; and though, with the assistance of a
few good friends, he has passed through all the


stations belonging to a seaman, from an apprentice
boy in tbc coal trade, to a Post Captain in the Royal
Navy, he has had no opportunity of cultivating letters.
After this account of myself, the Public must not
expect from me, the elegance of a fine writer, or the
plausibility of a professed book maker ; but will, I
hope, consider me as a plain man, zealously exerting
himself in the service of his country, and determined
to give the best account he is able of his proceedings. ?
?? Plymouth Sound, July 7th, 1776.??
After this quotation of the words of Capt. Cook,
I think I cannot do better than give you the apposite
lines of Robertson, the historian, on the character of
Pizarro, who commenced his career from the low
office of a swineherd, and by perseverance and energy
rose to the command of an expedition which discover-
ed the gold regions of Peru, in 1526, where the
ordinary domestic utensils were found to be made of
pure gold. I believe you will agree with me, that
the following remarks apply to our immortal Cook.
? With a temper of mind no less daring, than the
constitution of his body was robust, he was foremost
in every danger; patient under the greatest hard-
ships; and unsubdued by any fatigue. He was soon
considered as a man formed to command. Every
operation committed to his conduct proved success-
ful, as, by a happy but rare conjunction, he united


perseverance with ardour, and was as cautious in
executing, as lie was bold in forming bis plans. By
engaging early in active life, without any resource
but bis own talents and industry, and by depending
on himself alone in his struggles to emerge from
obscurity, he acquired such a thorough knowledge of
affairs, and of men, that he was fitted to assume a
superior part in conducting the one, and in governing
the other.?
I do not know what your thoughts may be, but I
consider that Capt. Cook has signally identified him-
self with Whitby. If all merchants, underwriters, and
emigrants were aware of the opinion that that great
man had recorded of the ships that were built at this
port; (and doubtless, superior ones can be built now,)
they would prefer them to all others for voyages to
Australia, on account of strength, durability and
safety. Our shipowners have only to follow up what
Capt. Cook so auspiciously began, and then, I trust
the day is not far distant, when wo shall witness such
ships sailing majestically out of our harbour, to the
Australian shores; and bringing back weighty cargoes
in return.
I cannot conclude this part of my Lecture, without
throwing out a suggestion, which I do with all defer-
ence. You are aware that we have, for some time
been making an effort to get a budding of our own


for a Museum ; and for which wc have got a few
golden props. But as it is very desirable that we
should have a building, which would be an ornament
to the Borough ; I would suggest that, a proper build-
ing should he erected on the West Cliff, and connected
with a monumental tower to the memory of Captain
Cook, which would be a landmark to the thousands of
British mariners, who are constantly passing our coast,
and which might be called, ? Cook?s Australian
Monument.? A Museum containing such a valuable
collection of Saurian fossils as we possess, I do not
think would he an inappropriate foundation for such
a monument; considering that some of them have
been dug out of the very cliffs under the shadow of
which, Cook first acquired a knowledge of the sea.
Besides, by a scheme like this, you would extend the
circle of your subscriptions; and I doubt not, would
acquire sums from distant quarters for so popular an
object. Capt. Cook is of world-wide renown, and
will ever rank as the greatest of navigators, and he
an Immortal glory to the British nation.
It was beautifully said by the talented Mr. Inger-
soll, the American minister, at Birmingham, the
other day, that, ?Iron abounds in your soil; and
who shall doubt that from the beginning of the world
till now, iron has been honoured as the best of metals ?
Who shall doubt, notwithstanding the character of


the now almost forgotten Ophlr gold, eclipsed as it
is by the gold of Australia and California, iron is
calculated in its substantial advantages to go above
and beyond it ? It is a remarkable and curious fact
that of all the characteristic discoveries of the pre-
sent age, iron is the essential ingredient. If you
want to make roads for the passage of individuals,
and the transportation of merchandise over land,
iron is the ingredient that is used. If you wish to
see the powerful enginery that conducts these indivi-
duals and that merchandise over those roads, you
will find that iron is the special ingredient of the
steam engine. If you wish to carry those indivi-
duals on errands of business or affection from one
part of the world to another, over the ocean or on
the shore, it is iron that is specially, used. Iron is
the metal that has robbed the lightning of its power,
to come to your aid. In your country, not many
years ago, a great experiment was made, and at-
tended with eminent success ?I mean the great
Britannia tubular bridge, and it is all iron. Indeed,
the nation and the town that rests on iron, mingles
the golden with the iron age. I know very well that
the various productions of Birmingham have of very
late years made themselves known in a place and
upon an occasion that gave them a world-wide repu-
tation, if they did not possess it before ?that at the


Great Exhibition; thus proving that this was a place
which could produce, exhibit, and carry on produc-
tions, equal to those of any other part of the world.?
?You are destined to he a great people; and lam
delighted to see that there is between this particular
town and our country a relation of a somewhat pecu-
liar character, ?peculiar when contrasted with other
places, such as Manchester, the great manufacturing
establishments of which wo supply with the raw
material which they work up ; whereas with regard
to this town it is different, for we are the purchasers,
and you in Birmingham are the manufacturers, to
an extent that is very great. I trust the time is
not distant?it is said to be rapidly approaching,
and evidences have been lately given of it to some
extent, that at least in one article which is largely
used in your establishments, we shall become large
producers and large exporters to Birmingham?l
mean the copper on the borders of Lake Superior,
winch has already been found in considerable quan-
tities, and of great purity and richness.? ?Why
should not we, therefore, in our large country, unite
in harmonious intercourse that shall know no inter-
ruption, no abatement, especially with this town ?
Why should we not inscribe on our banners along
with you that word which I believe to be your motto,
? FORWARD,? and in going forward, and together,


as tho representatives of the religion, the morality,
the language, and the liberty of the world ??
It is curious as well as amusing to observe the
changed spirit that has come over the character of
John Bull. From being rude, he has become amia-
ble. Formerly he was calling Jonathan, ? yankee,?
and ?yankee-doodle,? now, it is all ?Brother Jona-
than.? Their last meeting was at Birmingham,
where the scene was truly pathetic. John admired
the gigantic proportions of his dear Brother Jona-
than, and expressed a desire to engage in the strong-
est ties of fraternity for the future; and wished them
to be ?lovely and pleasant in their lives,? and then,
they would be ? swifter than eagles and stronger
than lions.? Jonathan was affected at his patriar-
chal Brother?s kindness :?he wished no stinking
fish to poison their union :?he desired them to ho
hound together by a threefold cord, which could not
be easily broken, composed of gold, copper and iron.
John was quite agreeable, and suggested that if
Jonathan would supply the gold and copper from his
California and Superior Lake, ho would furnish the
iron.
After the Brothers had taken a few glasses of
wine together, John expressed his admiration of his
Brother Jonathan?s gigantic size:?you have quad-
rupled since I treated you so badly eighty years ago.


Anti 5n sixty years more, I shall quadruple again,
replied Jonathan, for I have room for expansion :
but you, Brother John, for want of room, must re-
main in statu quo. Mark this, Jonathan, that some
bulbs attain to an enormous size; others, like my-
self, instead of increasing in size, send out ofF-sets,
and I, like them, retain the original dimensions.
Besides, I have a heavy weight to carry perpetually
on my shoulders. Look at my off-sets in the East:
?behold my Australia, which my lad Cook got for
me. I have a great affection for it, as well as for
your California. To tell you the truth, I have liked
you better since you had it, and I think you like me
no worse for having Australia.
Before we part from our hospitable friends at Bir-
mingham, let us tell them to contrive some iron
towns and cities, upon the Paxtonian principle, (as
far as iron is concerned), to send out to Australia
and California ; in order that no future catastrophies
like that which occured in San Francisco, should oc-
cur. They must not forget to send out to them iron
churches and chapels, the spires and domes of which,
they will perhaps gild when they get them. I wish
you would tell your folks at New York to gild the
summits of your Crystal Palace, and let us see how
it looks. I know Brother Jonathan that you do
things at once : but they say that they have to kick


me a dozen times, before I listen to the suggestions
of mj folks, and they say also, that I turn round at
last, and growl, and promise to do wdiat they want
if they won?t kick me again. So it is, I can?t get
on as fast as you do ; it is part of my constitution,
(doctors call it idiosyncrasy,) to sleep over measures
and often do wrong at last, what might have been
done right at first.
Brother John, I shall always be willing to enter
into any schemes with you, provided, they be those
of reciprocity and liberality. In America, we look
more to the future than you do : we think it a sin
to allow any of our youth to escape without a good
practical education : ?we consider that those who
are now born, will live to see and hear the English
language spoken by two hundred millions of people ;
and for that language to convey the blessed influences
of the Christian religion of peace and good-will to
all mankind. We are conscious that if our children
were not educated, and proper attention not paid to
our youth, from fourteen to twenty years of age,
which we consider to be the Robinson Crusoe period
of life, we should be fostering a permanent hotbed
for every description of crime. Therefore, we make
it an absolute rule, that every one of our children
should have a good practical education. The conse-
quence is, that all our young citizens are as clever


as they are enterprising. They are well indoctrin-
ated with Christian principles, which will enable the
majority of them to think and act correctly under
every circumstance, and in every situation. lam
delighted to see our good friends at Birmingham
acting on these sound principles.
? I thank you, my Brother Jonathan, for this
homily. I now begin to think I ought to send car-
goes of such youths to Australia, for I have not
room for them here : there, they would thrive and
prosper :?here, for want of education and occupa-
tion, they become what you call a festering hotbed
of crime. I wish I had been as good as you are,
Jonathan, when I was young ; I should not have had
to carry always on my shoulders this heavy budget,
which some folks tell me is a blessing, because it
keeps me from meddling too much with other peo-
ple?s affairs.
It is certainly an ugly off-set, Brother John, that
I sincerely wish to see reduced, I know of nothing
comparable to peace, friendship, and reciprocity of
commerce between us, to accomplish that object.
Continue to be of good cheer, for you have had the
patience of Job, who said, ?Thou shalt know that
thy tabernacle shall be at peace : thou shalt know
also that thy seed shall be great, and thine offspring
as the grass of the earth.? ? Then shalt thou lay


up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as the stones
of the brooks.?
It is now about twenty years since I took a geolo-
gical walk with my lamented friend, the late Mr.
Richard Moorsom, who was then President of this
Society. Our excursion extended up the Railway
as far as Beckhole. Our object was to seek for
minerals and mineral waters. I found a curious
substance, something like lime with a tinge of yellow
ochre, some of it was nearly white. We traced it
to the summit of the basaltic ridge, which crosses
the middle of Godeland. We brought away many
specimens of it, as well as samples of all the springs
we met with. We also examined minutely the bed
of Godeland Beck, near to the south side of the
church that has since been erected there, and found
it composed of a firm mass of marine fossil shells.
I little thought, at that time, that this was to turn
out the oolitic ironstone, which is, at present, causing
such a sensation. Upon analyzing the waters of the
springs, I found them every one to he more or less
chalybeate. Upon examining the mineral found in
contact with the basaltic ridge, I fused it into an
opalescent state ; some of which, from the white
stone, was exceedingly beautiful. It agreed in its
characters with the porcelain-earth, given by Pro-
fessor Jameson, in his Mineralogy. I represented


the circumstance to the Whitby Stone Company,
who authorized me to get a correct analysis. I sent
specimens of it to ray friend Dr. David Boswell Reid,
(then residing in Edinburgh) and upon comparing
his analysis with those of the Saxon porcelain-earth,
I was gratified to find that I had been correct in my
supposition, but our earth contained a larger impreg-
nation of iron. The Whitby Stone Company sent
specimens to the Potteries, and I believe received no
encouragement. From the enormous quantity that
I have found of this mineral, connected with that
singular basaltic feature of our district, I am quite
of opinion, with our increased chemical knowledge,
the Saxon secret might be found out, by which they
banish the iron from their porcelain earths. I have
for this reason brought the subject prominently for-
ward, in order that it may draw forth more attention.
About fifteen years ago, the Whitby Stone Com-
pany commenced working the oolitic ironstone at
Grosmont; from whence they have exported many
thousand tons annually to the northern coal-fields.
Their first mine was near the spot where the present
President of this Society was mainly instrumental in
the erecting an elegant church and school, for the
benefit of the miners and the neighbouring popula-
tion. I had the satisfaction of being present at the
opening of that church, which was afterwards con-


secrated by the Archbishop of York. I congratu-
late my inestimable friend, Mr. Belcher, who in pro-
moting - the building of that sacred edifice, has not
only, unintentionally, raised his own monument, to
transmit his worthy name to future generations ; but
he has planted it on the very rock of iron, from
which the first modern workings of the oolitic iron-
stone, in the north of England, took place.
In consequence of being in a delicate state of
health, I determined upon leaving Whitby in March,
1 843, to take up my abode in the beautifully romantic
dale of Danby, situate about twelve miles north west
of this place. As I had often visited that district
previously, I became aware of the salutary influence
of the pure air in which it is enveloped ; and I must
acknowledge that I never knew what - the sensation
of robust health was, until I took up my residence
there ; where I remained three years. As the in-
habitants of that lovely district appear to possess an
immunity from half the maladies that the human
frame is subject to ; I was not surprised to find it a
country remarkable for longevity. I once invited to
my house twenty-four old people to a tea party,
whose united ages amounted to 1848 years. There
will be several ladies and gentlemen in this assembly
who were present at that time ; and to their honour
waited upon those aged poor people :?and truly


exhibited the Spartan virtue of paying respect to
age.
Having a knowledge of the learned researches of
my friend, the late Rev. Dr. Young, the worthy and
indefatigable secretary of this Society ; I felt myself
prepared, when in Danhy, to examine the antiquities
by which I was surrounded. In honour to our Rev-
erend friend, I beg to bear my humble testimony to
the truth and correctness of his descriptions.
At present, I must beg of you to accept a conclu-
sion that I arrived at, which it is necessary I should
not keep back ; because it bears intimately on the
present subject. At the time that Great Britain
was a Roman province, the Romans had their roads,
their camps, and their stations in this immediate
neighbourhood. They had a camp half way between
Waupley and Freebrough Hill ; one at Crown End
between Westerdale and Basedale, and several other
stations in the vicinity of Danhy. Close upon these
camps and stations, and within their view and com-
mand, were British villages, such as those between
Danby Beacon and Waupley, Westerdale, and be-
tween Ugthorpe Rails and Stonegate, <fec., <fec. :
vestiges of all which roads, camps, stations and
villages remain to this day.
I have been long of opinion, that when the Romans
took possession of this district, Crunkley Gill, the


deep and narrow ravine, between Lealholme Bridge
and Great Fryup, was an elevated force or waterfall.
Such being the case, it would bold up the waters of
the river Esk, and convert the low lands of Danby,
Great Fryup, Little Fryup, Commondale, Wester-
dale, and Basedale into a continuous lake. The
Romans would find the sides of the hills sloping to
this lake, clothed with forest trees and gigantic hol-
lies. They would find these forests to abound with
wild game. A specimen of the remains of the Red
Deer, of gigantic proportions, has been very recently
found by Mr. Bewick, imbedded in the alluvial soil,
near Grosmont, and presented by him to your Mu-
seum ; and which, I have on the table on the present
occasion. They would also find the same ironstone
with petrifactions of marine shells, similar to that
which they possessed ?in Bavaria, Salzburg, the
Tyrol, and France, which afforded forty per cent, of
good iron.? In my examinations of the district, on
the borders of such a lake, as I have endeavoured to
describe, I have found that iron has been smelted to
an enormous extent: which is proved by the heaps
of slag, or cinder hills, as they are called, that still
remain in situ. I now exhibit on the table some of
of the slag I have taken out of a cinder heap at
Ainthorpe, in Danby.
I have therefore arrived at the further conclusion


that the Roman legions and cohorts, who took up
their stations on our undulating moorlands, where no
forests could possibly grow ; where they held the
ancient Britons as prisoners or slaves ; compelled
them to he hewers of wood, the burners of charcoal,
and the smelters of iron. They kept them at work
in the Dales by day, and marched them to their
encampments at night, on the moors, to be under
military surveillance. Nothing but extreme neces-
sity could have induced either Romans or ancient
Britons to select our elevated bleak moors as places
of residence. It must be borne in mind that the
Romans were conquerors ; and that seventeen or
eighteen hundred years ago Britons were their slaves.
That was an age of paganism, long before the mon-
astic institutions were established in this part; and
that it was centuries after, before Streanshalh Abbey
reared its glorious head, where St. Hilda prayed ;
and when the Holy Cross was planted upon the
British and Roman tumuli.
As I have sworn fealty to the Lord of the Manor
of Danby, I trust the excellent Viscount Downe will
pardon me for the liberty I have taken ; and what I
am going still further to take, with his property.
In order that you may comprehend this Danby Lake,
let us suppose, ladies and gentlemen, that you joined
me at a pic-nic at the top of Crunkley Gill; where I


had provided a few barrels of gunpowder ; and after
a little sapping and mining, I had got my galvanic
battery in readiness, and that my worthy friend Mr.
Richardson, our chief magistrate, was kind enough
to assist me, by holding the wires until I told him
that all was ready. Now for it?the earth trembles
?there is a rumbling like thunder under ground?
down tumble the huge rocks, and they are hurled with
a crash into the bed of the Esk. As we have got
into a pretty mess, the sooner we are off the better.
What did the ladies say and do ? They said it was
frightful?and rushed into the gentlemen?s arras.
What did the gentlemen say and do ? They said, it
was delightful ?and of course ran away with the
ladies. Thus you see, It was a regular good jolly
elopement?an Australian consummation.
The next thing we hear, is, that the Dales? folks
are fleeing to their mountains : that the jolly millers
will have to whistle twelve months for water ; as
they cannot possibly get any until our Lake Superior
has risen to the top of the obstruction in Crunkley
Gill. As our gradients are favourable, you see with
what ease we get over our engineering difficulties !
Thus, we have got a tolerably good sized lake formed.
In my next Lecture, (if you like this,) you shall have
a series of other lakes, all of which would enable
the Romans to boat down their iron from their smelt-


iug works to tlielr road and camp at Leaserig. I
might as well tell you now, that I intend to stop at
the straits of Newbiggin, or at Woodlands; therefore
you will have nothing to fear at Whitby. Hence,
you will perceive that I intend to represent, that in
ancient times, this was a lacustrine district.
During my residence in Danhy, in 1845, I took
immense pains, and was at considerable expense, in
making efforts to get a Railway from Whitby to
Stockton. For this object we had a Committee at
Stokesley, of which the Rev. Charles Cator was
chairman. By a resolution of that Committee, I
was deputed to act for the Dales. I give the follow-
ing extract from the York Herald of January 17th,
1846.
?Memorials. Dr. Merryweather, a deputation
from the Whitby and Tees Railway, with branch
from Stokesley, to join the Great North of England
at Cowton, presented memorials from Danby, Wes-
terdale, Commondale, Farndale, Rosedale, Great
Fryup, Little Fryup, Lealholme, Glazedale, Egton,
Eskdaleside, Sleights, Aislaby, Ugglebarnby, Snea-
ton, Sneaton Thorpe, and Easington ; also from the
fishing towns of Staithes, Robin Hood?s Bay, and
Runswick, to the Directors of the York and North
Midland Railway Company, in the following terms:
?In presenting the memorials from Staithes, Robin


Hood?s Bay, and Runs wick, places renowned for
supplying the finest fish found upon the east coast,
it is to be observed that no class of individuals will
he more deservingly henefitted by railway communi-
cation from the sea, to different parts of the interior,
than the industrious inhabitants of these isolated
fishing towns. The great obstacle that they have
had chiefly to contend with hitherto, has been the
want of expeditious transit for their fish to the inte-
rior of the country ; hut if the prayer of their pe-
tition be acceded to, it will enable them to transport
daily (when not prevented by stormy weather) fish in
a state of the greatest freshness and purity, to the
tables both of the poor and the rich, in almost every
part of Yorkshire, thereby creating new markets for
these hardy and adventurous children of the ocean.
? In the formation of this railway, which (when
fully carried out) will make Whitby the sea-port foT
the North Riding of Yorkshire, an instance will be
established of a railway, instead of detracting from,
materially adding to the maritime power of the na-
tion, by increasing the demand for fish, and so mul-
tiplying the number of fishermen and sailors.
? There is one feature connected with the Dales
(through which the railway in its present contem-
plated extent will pass), which is of the first import-
ance, that is, the ironstone with which they abound.


1 his fact was not unknown to the Romans, who have
left enduring testimonials of their imperfect mode of
smelting ; and so numerous are the cinder hills, as
they are called, which are found in various parts of
the district, that one is tempted to imagine that they
had here found their stores of iron, from which to
forge their arms for the subjugation of the world.
There is now a fair prospect of these treasures being
again developed by the railway ; happily not for
purposes of destruction, but for the object of extend-
ing the blessings of peace, comfort, and prosperity.?
In company with Mr. Belcher, the president of
this Society, and Mr, William Thompson, I joined
in escorting the eminent Birkenshaw, Mr. Alfred
Dickens, (brother to the inimitable writer,) and the
jolly Buxton, the engineers and surveyer of the York
and North Midland Railway Company, over the
ground of the proposed line of railway. An Act of
Parliament was procured to make the line as far as
Castleton ; with the understanding that it was to be
extended. Thus, the York and North Midland Rail-
way Company became possessed of the heart of the
oolitic iron district. But what is most astonishing,
they have not, to this day, had the heart to make the
line ! All the railway maps contain the dotted lines
to Castleton. Now that I witness the tremendous en-
ergies, which are put forth at Guishro?, and the south


bank of the Tees, where it is likely there will he
twenty blast furnaces this year ; 1 cannot hut desig-
nate it as a most unwise procrastination on the part
of the York and North Midland Railway Company.
Particularly unwise, because it would make a large
expenditure incurred in the construction of the AV hitby
and Rillington line, pay well, instead of being, as at
present, of doubtful benefit. However, I have the
satisfaction of reflecting that I have done my duty.
I beg to remark, emphatically, that I never had a
railway share in my life, and what I did on that
occasion was entirely at my own cost, having never
received a sixpence from any one. I therefore retire
with clean hands ; and feel very well content to leave
all further proceedings in the promotion of the Dales?
Railway, under the management of my friend, Mr.
George Parke, who, I have heard from many res-
pectable quarters, is well qualified to keep the affair
alive ; and I do not think he will rest until he gets
it accomplished.
Now that an amalgamation of three Companies
(all more or less interested in the extension of the
Whitby and Cleveland line,) is likely to take place,
I would urge Mr. Parke to get the original plans
carried out ; with the addition of a junction with the
Guishorough Railway. I can promise him the sup-
port of the Directors of that line ; and of my friends,


who formed the Committee at Stokesley. By these
means, Whitby would have a through coast railway :
and would likewise become a sea-port for the impor-
tant towns of Leeds and Bradford. Besides, they
might take return traffic of ironstone to their own
coal-fields.
One of the most valuable hooks that was ever
published in any language, is the, ? Reports of the
Juries,? of the Great Exhibition. In the Report of
Class I, page 7, you will find the following remarks:
?Mr, S. Blackwell, in the interesting collection
which he has exhibited, has placed this important
fact in the strongest light. He has brought together
the materials used in supplying each principal group
of iron works, carefully indicating the exact locali-
ties whence these minerals are obtained.?
Mr. Blackwell has favoured me with a copy of his
excellent lecture, which he delivered last year, before
the Society of Arts in London ; from which, I make
the following extracts.
?The history of the iron manufacture may he
divided into two great periods : the first, extending
from the earliest historical notice of it, which we
possess, down to the time of the introduction of coal
as the fuel used in smelting ; and the second, ex-
tending from this date down to the present time.?
? The great abundance of iron ores in so many


different localities in the kingdom ; and the extensive
forests which anciently covered such large tracts of
our island, rendered England celebrated from a very
early period, for its iron manufacture.?
? There are few districts where iron ores are now
found in which the remains of old and very ancient
workings do not exist ; and, in some localities, these
remains may he traced to an extent, which shows
that at a very early period, the smelting of our iron
ores with the charcoal of our forests was most ex-
tensively carried on. Not only in localities, which
are now important seats of the manufacture of iron,
hut in some which have long ceased to be such ; and
even in others, where, until very recently, iron ores
were not known to exist, is this found to he the case.
This is the case in Northamptonshire, the ores of
which have only attracted attention since the close
of the Exhibition ; hut which the remains of old
workings show to have been well known to the Roman
colonists of our island.?
?The rapid destruction of the forests of the coun-
try, and other causes, gradually led to a very great
decrease in the quantity of iron manufactured, until
at length, in 1740, it had declined to 17,350 tons,
the produce of 59 furnaces.?
? Attempts had been made, as early as 1620, to
employ coal for the purpose of smelting ; hut, al-


though partially successful, the use of this fuel can-
not he said to have commenced to any extent until
1740.?
? Its introduction at that time marks the second
epoch in the manufacture of iron, hut the increase
in the quantity produced, was a very gradual one.
In 1788 the annual production had risen to nearly
70,000 tons ; in 1800, to about 180,000 tons ; in
1825, to 600,000 tons ; and in 1851, the year of
the Exhibition, it may be said to have amounted to
upwards of 2,500,000.
? Of this enormous quantity, South Wales pro-
duced 750,000 ; Scotland 775,000 ; South Stafford-
shire and Worcestershire, nearly 600,000 ; and other
districts about 400,000. Total, about 2,500,000
tons.?
? The following have been the quantities of iron
exported during the last two years.
?In 1850, 1,122,084 tons. Declared value,
ï¿½9,567,108.
?In 1851, 1,296,873 tons. Declared value,
ï¿½10,424,137.
? Taking the average of these two years, we may
estimate the quantity of iron exported as equal to
1,200,000 tons per annum, being twofold the entire
make of the kingdom in 1826.?
I have now the satisfaction of introducing to your


notice Mr. Blackwell?s observations concerning the
oolitic ironstone of this district, which ought to he
peculiarly interesting, as proceeding from such an
authority.
?We now come to another class of ores of great
importance ; a class, the discovery of which marks
a new epoch in the history of the iron trade, and
which is of twofold interest, from the fact that our
knowledge of the existence of these deposits of iron
has occurred simultaneously with the developement
of the facilities of transport now afforded hy our
railway system ; and without which, this class of ores
would have been comparatively worthless. Thus,
the iron trade, after giving birth to this wonderful
result of modern science and industry, finds itself
fostered and extended in its hounds, by its own off-
spring ; and a new era opened out to it hy its own
inherent, and self-sustaining power.
? These deposits of ore are found occupying a po-
sition at the base of the oolitic formation, which,
commencing on the East Coast of our Island, from
the south hank of the river Tees to Scarborough,
stretches in a line more or less interrupted through
the midland counties of Yorkshire, Lincolnshire,
Rutlandshire, Northamptonshire, Oxfordshire, and
Dorsetshire, down to the South Coast, between Lyme
Regis and Dorchester, where, being turned aside by


the granite formations of Devon, it is prolonged into
France.
? The iron ore in this formation was first known
and worked at its northern extremity in the neigh-
bourhood of Middlesbrough. There, some two or
three years ago, a workman noticed a considerable
deposit of iron, which took place from a spring,
issuing at the base of one of its beds. Upon cal-
cining a piece of the rock, its character was at once
evident ; he communicated his discovery to the pro-
prietors of the extensive iron works of "W itton Park
and Middlesbrough, who immediately recognised its
importance, as the bed, upon examination, proved to
be fifteen feet in thickness at the point of out-crop,
and to contain thirty per cent, of iron.
? Lying at the summit of the Cleveland hills, in
many places with only a thin covering of soil, it
could be raised at a cost even less than that of the
celebrated blackbands of Scotland and North Staf-
fordshire. Its cost, indeed, resolved itself more
into the question of transport. The railways of the
district, already laid down for its important coal
trade, supplied these means: and branches were
speedily made to the Cleveland Hills themselves.
But for this discovery, some of the principal iron
works of the North of England, must have been
closed ; as the cheap blackbands of Scotland, had


destroyed the present value of the comparatively
expensive argillaceous ironstones of the Newcastle
coal-fields, which, consequently, could no longer be
used. In addition to the supply of existing works,
the almost inexhaustible supply within reach, led
to the erection of new furnaces at Middlesbrough,
where three furnaces are already in blast, working
almost exclusively from this ore : and others are in
process of erection. The extent to which it will
ultimately he worked, will he evident from the fact,
that last year, although so short a time had elapsed
since its discovery, one firm, that of Messrs. Bolck-
low and Vaughan, raised and sent off 200,000 tons
of stone to their own and other works. New rail-
roads are being applied for in the present session
of Parliament, for opening additional tracts along
the range of hills ; and every indication exists of a
constantly expanding manufacture of iron in this
district.
? The character of the ore is peculiar, and quite
distinct from any previously worked. Its colour in
the centre of the bed is of a greenish blue : towards
the outside (when not protected by a considerable
baring) it assumes a brownish tinge ; owing to a
partial oxydisation of the iron ; it often presents a
conglomerate appearance, from the contrast which
the homogenous fracture of some of its parts pre-


sents with the clearly developed oolitic structure of
others. When not oxydised, it contains about thirty
per cent, of iron ; and the cost of raising, (including
royalty and delivery to the distance of three or four
miles) does not exceed three shillings to three and
sixpence per ton. The bed appears to thicken as
it goes southward, where it is sometimes twenty feet
thick. Where it is now principally worked, being
fifteen feet thick it produces about 30,000 tons per
acre.?
In addition to this admirable statistic and graphic
account of Mr. Blackwell?s ; I have been favoured,
through the courtesy of Mr. Pease, (who has ho-
noured us with his presence this evening,) with the
manuscript copy of Mr. Campbell s lecture, which
was read before the Royal Society of Arts of Edin-
burgh, who append their valuable report thereon.
This report is peculiarly interesting to me, as eman-
ating from the seat of learning, where I obtained
my knowledge of geology and mineralogy, under
Professor Jameson, who was the pupil of the illust-
rious Werner.


Edinburgh, 27th February, 1852.
Chambers, 11, Scotland Street.
? A notice of the Iron district, lately discovered
in the Cleveland Hills, in the North Riding of
the County of York, with specimens of the
Ores."
? Mr. President and Gentlemen,
? When in the North of England last autumn, my
business on the river Tees brought me to the vicinity
of this new ironstone field, where the energetic oper-
ations which could be seen going on upon the face of
the hills under Eston Nab, and the traffic of iron-
stone upon the Stockton and Darlington Railway,
were exciting great interest.
? There is a great quantity of freestone quarried
out along with the ironstone, and as it was proposed
that the freestone should be used in the dykes for
the future improvement of the river, I got acquainted
with what was doing, and brought home some small
specimens of raw and roasted ore ; two of the pieces
having each the mark of a large shell on it. The
ore being of an unusual appearance, and having been
so late as the beginning of last year discovered to
be in such enormous quantity, it was suggested to
me, that some information on the subject would be
interesting to this Society.
?? I have therefore had some communications on


the subject, and one gentleman intimately acquainted
with these operations, writes me from England, (on
the 26th, instant,) that they will ultimately revolu-
tionize the iron trade, both there and in Belgium.
? Finding the subject to be so intimately connected
with the useful arts and the productions of the coun-
try, and coming within your list of subjects, I have
prepared this communication, and I have succeeded
in getting two first rate specimens down from the
workings. They are herewith submitted. They are
nodules resembling what in our Scotch ore are called
halls.
? The other hlueish and brownish specimens shew
the appearance of the masses.
? A most remarkable feature in these mines is,
that the ore is got by open quarrying, with drifts at
short intervals into the rocks, thirty to forty feet.
The beds in this mountain of ironstone are nearly
level, and vary in thickness from twelve feet, to no
less than twenty feet, and extend southerly for miles,
with the same facilities for working. Indeed, it is
estimated that no less than ten millions of tons may
yet he got, without the expense of sinking shafts.
The present workings are about seven miles from
Middlesbrough, where there is a large wet dock for
the shipment of coal.


?Two smelting furnaces have been erected there,
and both were in blast before I left.
? There is no limestone or coal got in the district,
but vessels coming for coals to the Tees, where it is
brought down by railway, are commonly in ballast,
which is either sand or chalk from the London chalk
basin, this latter I understand, is what is mostly
used instead of limestone for smelting purposes.
1 have just been informed, that two more fur-
naces are being erected at Middlesbro?, and that it is
contemplated to erect furnaces on the spot, whenever
the proposed railway is ready to bring coal and lime
to the workings.
? Operations were commenced about the month of
April last, and besides what is smelted at Middles-
bro?, a great deal of ore goes up the Stockton and
Darlington Railway,?this has averaged the rate of
200,000 tons per annum.
? I am informed, that some days lately, upwards
of two thousand tons of ironstone have passed up to
the smelting furnaces in the west during the twenty
four hours, the mineral trains running night and day.
? All this is going on very quietly by the Eston
Mining Company, but such gigantic operations can-
not but attract notice, and I hear that other parties
are preparing to enter on this large field of enter-
prize.


?The largeness of this quantity of ironstone, and
its contiguity to the surface, offers great inducements
for the erection of furnaces, which must greatly in-
crease the make of iron in this country. This is of
vital importance to the iron trade, especially at this
time, when the putting about one half of the old fur-
naces out of blast, is considered to be the only way
to prevent ruin under the present prices of pig iron.
? The question can be of no less interest to Scot-
land, where the make of iron is increasing so rapidly,
and where the make has continued to exceed the de-
mand so that during the last five years, the stock on
hand has increased at the rate of 50,000 tons per
annum, and during last year, prices continued to fall
(to 375. 6d., No. 1.)

?Ironstone has been recently found at a great
depth in Northamptonshire, which will enable the
Staffordshire iron-masters, who supply the London
trade, to compete with other districts.
? As the future supply of ironstone is attracting
much notice at the present, and the geological fea-
tures of a district being an important point, I beg
leave to add a few general remarks.
? In our Geological Maps, a large tract south of


the Tees Bay, and including the Cleveland hills, is
marked limestone, with indications of ? iron sand ?
along the top of the ridge.
? The top of Eston Nab is freestone over the iron
workings. Pits dug in the sides of the mountain
shew conglomerate of shells. This is what about a
year ago, was discovered to he ironstone. There is
no limestone found in the district.
?The ironstone is hlueish, and some of it brown,
from the oxide of iron. One of the pieces exhibited
shews a brown streak, which mineralogists know to
indicate ore.
? Muriatic acid gives no indication of lime, even
on the whitest of the shells, as they are probably
already saturated with sulphuric acid with the iron
oxide.
? A cliff on the south shore of the Tees Bay shews
a bed of gypsum or alabaster. The ninth Buoy
Scarp, a rock in the navigation of the Estuary, is
lias of the lower oolite formation ; and on the north
of the river we find the magnesian limestone, of
which the new West Hartlepool Docks are mostly
built.
? ? The alum rock occurs towards Whitby, and both
lime and coal have been worked in one of the dales
of the Cleveland hills, about ten miles from the iron-
stone workings. Hence it may he inferred that both


fuel and flux may yet be got beside the iron ore,
though, it is probable that these may be at an incon-
venient depth.
? The bed of the River Tees, is on the new red
sandstone, appearing at Dinsdale, thirty miles up its
course, then at ? Yarm Shoal,? ? Barwick Quarries,?
and at ? Seaton Carew,? on the north side of the
mouth of the Tees.
? Near to Barwick, the great basalt dyke, lying in
the freestone, crosses the river, forming a harrier
there called, ? Old Roger.?
?At Eston there is a beautiful pure spring, hut
good water is scarce in the low ground, and there is
none round Middlesbrough. At the Railway Hotel
there, I found a plentiful well of had water ; which I
took to he a chalybeate spring. Water is pumped
up to supply the shipping, hut it is had and brackish.
? Some of the ore is roasted at Middleshro?, before
it is carried to the furnaces, about twenty-five miles
westward, in the coal and lime district of Durham.
? Our coalfield extends three hundred miles, from
the Tay to the Severn at Bristol; by twenty to one
hundred and twenty miles in breadth. This forma-
tion consists of sandstone, ironstone, clays, and lime-
stone. The latter being the most metaliferous of the
secondary rocks, terminates about Whitby, where
the chalk formation begins, in which no metals are


found, the mineral field continuing up the western
side of the Island, consequently the Cleveland iron-
stone lies much to the south east of what was con-
sidered as the mineral field of the north of England,
generally estimated at half a million of acres.
? From the appearance of slag and other remains,
it is thought that the Romans had smelted ore on
the Cleveland hills as elsewhere. It is supposed
they used wood for fuel, hut no bellows, and that
they set their furnaces on the tops of hills to catch
the wind. These facts known in history make it re-
markable that ironstone was not sought for before.
Indeed, the estate was not long since sold for a mei?e
nominal price.
? In conclusion, I expect the specimens may he of
interest to some of our Members, and I have endea-
voured to procure the most authentic information on
the subject to lay before you. There has not yet
however been time to ascertain the result of expe-
rience. (A Chart of Tees Bay accompanies this
Paper, in which is shown the position of Eston Nab.

? Report on Mr. Campbell's ?Notice of the iron
district, lately discovered on the Cleveland
Hills, in the North Riding of the County of
York, with specimens of the Ores.' Read be-
fore the Royal Scottish Society of Arts, 22nd
March, 1852.?
?Your Committee having considered Mr. Camp-
hell?s Paper, and examined the specimens of the ore,
have to report as follows.
?I. The ironstone is of good workable quality.
In structure it is fine granular, chiefly consisting of
an aggregation of minute spherical individuals re-
sembling the roe of a fish, in geological language,
oolitic. In this and other characters, it is identical
with what is termed lenticular iron, found and work-
ed in Bohemia and other countries. Your Committee
have not ascertained that an analysis of the Cleve-
land ore has been made, hut the Bohemian variety,
which it most nearly resembles, contains about forty
one per cent, of metallic iron. The Cleveland ore
not being so high in specific gravity, may he assured
to yield at least thirty five per cent, of iron. On
this point however we have to take into our estimate,
the account received by Mr. Campbell since the
reading of his Paper, namely, that the ore in work-
ing down the bed, has improved in quality, which
will of course yield a higher per centage.


?11. The value of the Cleveland ore is settled
by practical operations. Mr. Campbell, in his notice
states, ?that two thousand tons of ore are daily sent
from Eston iron works to be smelted,? and from
further information received by him, as recommended
by this Society, another Company had started in
March last, at Skinningrove, near Eston, and a third
Company has commenced operations on a large scale
at Upleatham, and three blast furnaces have been
erected at the place where the ironstone is found.
Your Committee has been informed, that the iron
produced from this ore, is what is termed, ? hot short
iron, ? but that by the addition of a certain quantity
of Haematite ore, this imperfection is removed.
? 111. From these facts your Committee has come
to the following conclusions. First.?That the iron-
stone is of good workable quality. Second. ?That
the thickness of the bed, its horizontal extent, and
the facility and consequent cheapness at which the
ore is obtained, the ready means of conveyance by
water and railway, will enable parties engaged in
this great iron-field to outrival others in cheapness,
and thus extend our commerce in this important
article to other countries, which will therefore be of
national importance.
? A geologist and mineralogist might cavil at a
point or two in Mr. Campbell?s ?Notice,? which do


not however in the least affect the main object of the
Paper, All which is humbly reported by

Edin. 14 June, 1852.
Ye men of Cleveland and of Whitby Strand, you
are destined to become an important people, not only
nationally hut internationally ! ?tell it not to the
York and North Midland Railway Company ;?pub-
lish it not in the Houses of Parliament, that they hold
the rusty iron key, which keeps you at a dead-lock.
Even Mr. Blackwell has been led into a mistake
about the Whitby and Cleveland Railway, which he
would perceive on the maps, hut which is, in fact, in
nubibus.
What is to he done ? Are we to he kept at a stand
still ? Is our railway to remain un-opened to the
north west ? Certainly not! We will find millions of
tons for our railway, and ten thousand freights for
our ships, annually. We have a line of cliff coast,
from Sandsend to Staithes, of eight miles in extent,
the property of the noble and illustrious Patron of
this Society. Along this coast, fortunately, the
oolitic ironstone, (so abundant in the Yale of the
Esk,) crops out, in inexhaustible quantity, and of
the richest ore of any I have seen : some of it being
of the specific gravity of iron itself. Specimens of


which I exhibit on the table. I have lately visited
the neighbourhood of Staithes, to examine the iron-
stone beds there, which are of enormous magnitude
and extent. Mr. Bigland is at present carrying on
extensive operations, for the working of these ores.
From their elevation above, and proximity to the
sea ; by the aid of jetties, the ironstone can he al-
most pitched out of the mines, into the holds of
ships.
The cost of our oolitic ironstone, as Mr. Blackwell
truly remarks, resolves itself into the expense of tran-
sport. The royalty being a mere acknowledgment?
the mining of it a comparative trifle ?the remainder
of the cost must belong to the railway and the ship-
ping interest. I believe lam correct in the suppo-
sition, that all shipowners have a predilection for
return freights.
We read in eastern story, that there was once a mag-
netic iron island, which was shunned by all mariners,
because it loosened the bolts of their ships. When
I was examining the iron rocks at Staithes, the other
day, I thought of the oriental story, and imagined
that the thousands of colliers, which are constantly
passing with cargoes of black diamonds to the south,
instead of shunning the iron rocks, like the ships of
Arabia, the shipowners should allow them to he
naturally attracted, and permit their captains to par-


take of a turbot dinner, with a tankard of Linton?s
prime ale, whilst the miners were tilling the holds of
their empty ships ; with the very material that is so
much wanted and prized at the northern coal-fields.
The object of these remarks, is to expose and make
known the advantages offered to the owners of colliers;
and I trust for their remuneration.
I have latterly had many conversations with the
Marquis of Normanby, on the mineral wealth of that
line of coast, of which he is the fortunate owner.
As there is ample room, I suggested that contracts
should be entered into with a large company, or a
number of smaller ones, for the working of this iron-
stone. I think it right and proper to state, that his
Lordship informed me, that, if a Whitby Company
desired to enter into a contract, such a Company
should have the preference. I also suggested the
policy of having depots of ironstone at Great Grims-
by, and other places possessing railway and water
communication with the interior, where the ironstone
could be taken by smaller craft at favourable seasons
of the year, to be ready for sale to the ironmasters.
I have lately had several communications with the
Great Grimsby Dock Company, and they assure me,
that they will give every facility for such an ar-
rangement.
It must, certainly, be of national importance, and


of peculiar interest to the iron-manufacturers of Bir-
mingham, to know, that I am pointing out to them
a district, which can with the greatest facility supply
them with millions of tons annually ; and that for
generations to come.
If any iron-master would apply to me, I will send
him specimens of the ironstone I have been naming :
and if the iron-masters would come with their wives
and families, and spend a few weeks during the sea-
son, at our beautiful watering place, where they
would find elegant mansions all ready for their com-
fort and accommodation :?if they would apply to
me, I should he happy, on that occasion, to prove
the truth of my assertions by giving them ocular de-
monstration ; and supply them with every information
they might require. lam collecting specimens from
the entire oolitic iron district, which will be labelled
with the names of the localities, and the owners
thereof; for the purpose of being placed in our
Museum, for general inspection.
I beg to suggest to the Birmingham iron-masters,
the policy of forming a Company for themselves in
this district.
There has been recently published, an elegant
volume on, ? The Rivers, Mountains and Sea Coast
of Yorkshire,? by Professor Phillips, F. R. S., the
eminent geologist. It will he a reflection on every


Yorkshire library, not to possess this exceedingly
valuable work. If you refer to page 288, you will
read the following prophecy respecting Staithes :
? At some time, perhaps, the quiet of this romantic
place will he disturbed by mining, and its hardy
fishermen?athletic Norwegian forms ?will he set to
more tedious work in ironstone pits. At present it
is unrivalled in the variety of organic remains, which
may he collected from the cliffs of lias, marlstone,
and ironstone, at a small distance.? It is a good
thing to have the prediction of a scientific name, for
it tends to lead to its realization. I have informed
Professor Phillips that his prophecy is likely soon to
he verified ; and in my last letter from him, he said
that he should like to hear me on ironstone.
You know that when the weather is brilliantly
fine, I can predict with unerring certainty a thunder
storm or a tempest; hut on the present occasion I
am performing the part of an alchymist, for the
benefit of the district in which I reside?by the
transmutation of our iron-ore into gold. At the
same time, I do not wish it to he supposed that lam
exempt from what I represented to he the instinct of
all human beings?the love of gold : for it would be
a comfortable thing to have a farthing per ton, on
all the ironstone, which is likely to leave this part.
I would willingly give half of it towards Captain


Cook?s monument. lam obliged to say this, for
the consolation of those, who accuse me of doing so
many things without remuneration. It is my maxim
that, it is the duty of every man to do the best he
can, for the public good.
There is in domestic cookery a very favourite dish
of children, which is called a hlack-cap pudding.
Whoever has watched the instincts of children, before
they have been drilled into fashionable ways?will
have often perceived the hatter to he consumed the
first, and the conglomerated currants left to the last
?for a bonne bouche. I shall follow the example of
such children, and have reserved the sweetest and
most interesting part of my Lecture until the last. I
have often heard it remarked by strangers, that the
females of this district were extraordinary fine, women.
For my part, I have travelled in various countries, and
I must confess, I never did see any where such an
array of fair and splendid women, as these parts dis-
play. You have the Grecian form, with the Circassian
beauty of feature and complexion. If I were put to
the test, I could point out faces similar to many that
Raphael and Correggio have immortalized. Let us
examine into the cause of this. As the sea prepon-
derates over the land, so do the fluids of the human
body over the solid parts. It is known that if a
person be scorched to death, on the sandy deserts of


Sahara, he is reduced to such lightness, as would
quite astonish you. What is the principal ingredient
in the fluid parts of the blood of the body ? Water.
What is the colouring matter of the blood ? Iron.
If it were gold, you would be gilt; and lam sure
no man would like a gilded wife, I mean as regards
her complexion. I cannot answer for the likings of
ladies, but I can tell them an anecdote of a gentle-
man, who was watching the diggers bringing their
gold dust to the Banks, in Australia ; and he ob-
served one fellow draw his hand from his dust bag,
and rub it over his perspiring face?and he asserts
that the man was absolutely gilt. If iron were ban-
ished from the blood, the maiden?s blush and rosy
hue, would go along with it. You now perceive that
iron is an ingredient in the internal circulation. If
iron were absent, you would be like Lot?s wife?a
pillar of salt.
You must bear in mind that almost all the water,
particularly, in our Dales, is more or less chalybeate,
that is, impregnated with the salts of iron. It is
therefore evident that this water, by consumption,
gets into the human circulation, by which the con-
stitution and health of the body are invigorated and
benefitted. Look at our athletic Dales? men?they
have the round and strong muscles of the lion.
Look at the women?they are the picture of health


and strength. Look at their children?they are like
rose-buds. You now perceive that it is iron every
where, and iron for ever. If you wish to witness
iron in its greatest purity?you have only to observe
the blush of a beautiful woman. (There is in this
assembly, a young gentleman, who has just said to
his neighbour, ?beautiful,?) I need not, therefore,
make any apology for touching on their charms.
No one who has seriously observed the events of
the last five years, can escape from the conviction,
that the hand of Divine Providence has been signally
manifested. The instincts of the human heart have
been acted upon in a most extraordinary manner.
The gold of the unpopulated deserts of California
and Australia, has tempted the people of densely
populated countries, to sacrifice all native ties, to
rush into all kinds of hardships and trouble, hitherto
unthought of, for the sake of that mammon, which
they imagined would procure happiness. Even the
same inducement has caused China, the most exclu-
sive of all nations, to burst asunder its rigid barriers,
which nothing before was able to break. Thus, you
see the love of gold?this cupidity, has been the in-
strument by which Providence is carrying out its
vast designs. Have you not seen the collective wis-
dom of our Legislature baffled and turned to foolish-
ness ? Behold those patriots, who left their country


for their?country?s good, now luxuriating in golden
regions.
Everybody wants gold, but few can get it; but
iron is the absolute necessity of every human being.
When I consider, that before long, there will be
100,000 miles of railway, and its appendages, to be
kept up in perpetuity : and when I contemplate our
extensive colonial possessions : and India with its
one hundred and fifty millions of inhabitants, all of
which sooner or later must have their systems of
railways ; and will be ever looking to Great Britain
for their supply of this universal and useful commod-
ity ?I cannot but think that that district is highly
favoured, which possesses such a large amount of
this peculiar mineral wealth as our own.
It was reputed that Whitby, during the war, was
the richest town hut one, in the kingdom, for its
size. As riches beget apathy ?and as lam treating
on iron?l beg respectfully, to stir you all up with a
red hot iron. All medical men are aware that the
actual cautery, often performs a radical cure, when
all other means prove abortive.
I shall conclude this Lecture with the beautiful
language and noble sentiments, which Mr. Blackwell
uttered before the Society of Arts last year, which I
have told him do honour both to his head and to his
heart.


?And now to supply these requirements, another
great source of iron is disclosed to us ; to the argil-
laceous and hlackband ironstone of our coal-fields,
and the haematites of our carboniferous limestones,
are added the oolitic ores, with the rich per centage
of iron they contain, the low cost at which they are
raised, and their exhaustless supplies. Can this
constant progression of means, this developement of
one resource after another, as society requires it, he
other than a wise and most beneficent arrangement,
which has for its purpose the advancement of society
to a higher and higher point, and the attainment of
that unity amongst all the nations of the earth,
which must ultimately prevail ?
? Nor does it appear a less wise and beneficent
arrangement that the stores of mineral wealth, so
needful for the world?s progress, should exist in cli-
mates temperate as our own, which has produced the
strong and vigorous Anglo-Saxon race : to whom
work is less a toil than a passion, and amongst whom
there are so many who do not shrink to devote even
their entire lives, to the developement and extension
of some great enterprize.
But if to the Anglo-Saxon race has been given so
large a proportion of the mineral riches of the world,
it must not he forgotten, that, equal to the power
thus committed to their care, is the responsibility


thereto attached; they must of necessity he the guides
and promoters of the advancing civilization of the
present day, seeing that the very basis of that civi-
lization, is to be found in the increased and increasing
power, to adapt to the requirements of society, the
great physical resources of the world ; and that the
science and the skill of the present day, would he
comparatively powerless, hut for the stores of iron
and coal, by which that science, and that skill can
he rendered available. The Steam-engine, the rail-
road, and the electric telegraph, the characteristic
features of the present day, are indeed, preparing a
quiet revolution for the world : breaking down class
interests, and substituting universal interests in their
place ; they are fast uniting in one bond of unity the
entire human race, and are leading rapidly, to use
the words of His Royal Highness Prince Albert,
? to the accomplishment of that end, to which,
indeed, all history points, the realization of the unity
of mankind.
? For ourselves, it would not be sufficient, that, in
the hands of a higher power than our own, we are
unconsciously working out the designs of Providence,
but we should try to discern the coming changes,
which are arising around us ; that thus, conscious
whereunto our work is tending, we may be enabled
to place ourselves in harmony therewith.


?That we have earnest workers amongst us?men
working with noble aims, with no party or merely
national spirit, but in the great cause of humanity
itself, ?the Exhibition of 1851 has clearly shown.
? May its promoters long he remembered with
honour, and may the important benefits which it
already appears to have conferred upon all our prin-
cipal trades, be productive of the results, for which
its promoters so nobly worked.?




A Report of the Speeches , delivered after the
conclusion of Dr. Merryweather s Lecture.
Henry Belcher, Esq., the President.
Ladies and Gentlemen: ?I beg the favour of
your remaining for a short time, because, in addition
to the duty which is due from us all, in acknowledg-
ing the lecture, there are two or three gentlemen in
the room, who, I believe, could say a few words on
the subject of it.
With respect to the Lecture itself, I will not offer
to give any opinion, wishing to leave that in the
hands of others, hut just to observe that I am sorry
so eminent a person as Mr. Blackwell, was not more
fully informed of the facts of the case, because he
has left the iron stone of our district, entirely out of
notice in his observations.
The address of the Lecturer however, sets the mat-
ter very much to rights, and as I am glad to hear it
will be published, and I hope, extensively circulated,
I trust not only the inhabitants of our own neigh-
bourhood, but the public generally, will become aware
of the facts; and that iron-works may be established
with advantage, in our Valley, as well as in the Vale
of Cleveland ; not that we wish to detract from the
importance of the Iron-works on the other side of
the hills, as I believe there is abundant scope for


works, in all parts of the district ; and from the ac-
counts we have heard to night, we have nothing at
all to fear on that score.
Ladies and Gentlemen :?I will not detain you
longer, as I know that there are several gentlemen
in the room, who would he very glad to say a few
words on the subject ; and I heg to propose, ? That
? the thanks of this meeting he given to Dr. Merry-
? weather, for the very interesting Lecture he has
?given, and for the important information he has
?brought before us.?
Christopher Richardson Esq., Field House.
Ladies and Gentlemen :?I am very happy to
have the honour of seconding the motion of Mr. Bel-
cher on this occasion, hut I may say that the wire
that Dr. Merryweather put into my hands, had such an
effect upon my nerves, that I am quite unable to ex-
press myself. The scene was, ladies flying into my
arms, I think that was what the Doctor gave you an
idea of, hut however, I am very glad you are all very
cheerful and very quiet. I heg to second the vote of
thanks which Mr. Belcher has proposed, and am
much obliged to the Doctor.
Henry Belcher Esq :?Before putting this to the
Meeting, it would be as well to request that any
gentleman present who has any observations to make
will he kind enough to express them. We should


be very happy to hear them, Mr, Yasey, I think, is
prepared to say a few words, and any observations
coming from so practical a man will he highly valu-
able, and I am sure, he favourably received.
George Yasey, Esq.
Mr, President, Ladies and Gentlemen: ?I do
most heartily concur in the vote of thanks being
moved and seconded, and as our worthy President
has said that I wish to make a few remarks, they
will only be in my own way, and very short. I could
enter into the feelings, I am sure, of our highly res-
pected and worthy magistrate, Mr. Richardson, in
feeling himself almost electrified by touching the
wire at Crunkley Gill. However I have been several
times in that neighbourhood, and I believe there is
a great deal of truth which may be brought out of
the idea, that Doctor Merry weather has suggested.
I believe all Danby Dale is very like half of a
bottle, laid down on its side ; and Crunkley Gill to
he the very place where the cork goes in : if the
cork was put in, the course of the water would he
stopped, and the whole Dale above become a fine
lake, on the borders of which the iron was munufac-
tured. I can see that this may be quite correct, as
I suppose it was in the time past, ?some seventeen
hundred years ago, (I think that was the time the
Doctor referred to) ; and I think the more of it, he-


cause I have been an eye-witness of the slag the
Doctor mentioned. I have seen it, not only in Dan-
hy, hut in Glazedale ; and not in mere fragments
hut part of the hill is composed of that slag ; and it
is perfectly evident to me, that iron has been manu-
factured there, and it is also evident to me, from
what I have heard in this Lecture, that our country
forms a body of iron.
I would just observe, that scarcely can we find a
single individual who carries out one single thing to
a state of perfection. Now, though Captain Cook
was brought from an iron district ?though he seemed
to he raised from a bed of iron?his mind was a mind
of iron?his constitution seemed to he a constitution
0 f i r on?and all the way through his interesting life,
you will find that he carried out the very names of
the ships that he got from Whitby?he carried all
of them out to the very utmost. The ? Endeavour,
?and he endeavoured to secure his object. His
? Resolution ? seconded his Endeavour ; and his
? Enterprize ? crowned the whole. He secured
many great colonies, and long may our Queen keep
possession of those highly valuable colonies. But I
Avas about to say, that one man scarcely ever carries
out one single thing to perfection. Captain Cook
had no idea of Australia being a land of gold. It
has fallen to others to carry out the principle. They


have now found the precious metal which every per-
son in this country welcomes. I will just mention
what struck me, whilst the Lecture was being deliv-
ered : namely, that it is near about a century since
Captain Cook left the harbour and port of Whitby?
since that great man commenced his sea-faring life
?and it is well for us, and it must he interesting
too, to find family connections still living, who can
almost bring to their recollection the noble minded
man, who was so enterprising, and at the same time
so successful.
But another thing in connection with this I would
say, we have had some Geologists at Whitby : Dr,
Young, and his colleague, who was with him every
day, less or more, Mr, John Bird. Well?Mr. John
Bird had a farm just where the Ironstone was found,
and is now extensively worked, yet, Geologist as he
was, he only found a few cart loads, though at the
same time, the ironstone on the same farm, was worth
more than the farm itself. Geologists think they
have found something and for want of perseverance
lose it, or leave it for others to prosecute to a suc-
cessful consummation.?So it has been and will con-
tinue.
But there is one thing which we may gather from
the Lecture which has been given, and that is, we
want something which will bring about the better


working of the mineral. What will it avail us, if the
iron he a solid body and he not worked ? If we have
ever so valuable a metal in our neighbourhood, if it
is not taken up, we are not the better for having it
in our possession. Now iron, as it has been remarked
before in the present Lecture, is of immense value :
I will just give you the opinion of our highly respect-
ed Member for the Borough of Whitby,* ? Iron is
our true civilization so said our worthy represent-
ative, Robert Stephenson, Esq., at Bangor, in sight
of the Menai and Conway tubular bridges. He might
well feel justified in proclaiming this, for iron is a
great power in this present age, it is revolutionising
the world, the iron rail and the iron wires of the
telegraph have already brought towns so near to
each other, that a country has now become hut as
one vast city : and iron railroads are also bringing
countries nearer to each other, and binding them
into one common interest. We even hear of an iron
bond of union between England and Calcutta?a
railroad stretching across Europe and Asia Minor,
rendering the distance, in point of time, between
London and Calcutta, only one week. Nor is the
* Mr. Stephenson was prevented hy the pressing nature
of his engagements at the time, from being present at Dr.
Merryweather?s Lecture.


proposal a mere chimera, ?it is a thing that will be
realized in our own day. In a dozen years time,
iron will form the road, and iron locomotives the fiery
horses, to hear the iron carriages, freighted with
their living loads, along the great highway. So
that it may be said that our navigator, Capt. Cook,
not only found out and took possession of the islands
of the world, hut from the very spot from which he
sprung, there was to be procured the metal which
forms the foundation of a road, the length and
breadth of the land. And that which I have just
stated is not a mere chimera, it is actually commenc-
ing?it is breaking out from New York to California
?it has taken a sudden re-passage on the waters
from Dover to Calais ?and then it will take its
passage again from the coast of France, through
Europe and Asia Minor, till it shall reach where,
when Captain Cook was In his prosperity, it took
him twelve months to go to, and perhaps as many to
come hack again.
The days we live in are days of great excitement
on this subject, hut I presume we are only at the
beginning. We must make iron useful?it is now
taking the lead among metals. We?all of us
make some use of it. I trust we shall not bring
Glazedale and Danhy into floods of water, hut make
them available, and cross from side to side by other


means. That we*shall have an iron rail the whole
length of these Dales, in order that the valuable
materials which are so abundant, may be brought to
bear in a profitable way to every person, to whom
they belong.
Not only is iron made use of in railways and
telegraphic wires, but it is brought into more com-
mon use. Have we not lately seen that the Crystal
Palace was composed of iron and glass, its principal
strength iron ? And then, only lately her Majesty
had a ball room made of iron. An iron house was
made at Manchester for the honored man who came
from Turkey. And not only so, but household fur-
niture is beginning to be made of iron.
How can we help this ? It seems from the spirit
of the Lecture, that iron is a most important part,
even of our own constitution. That the more good
blood we have, the more iron we exhibit, the better
we shall look, and the longer we shall live. Let us
therefore, do what we can to make iron useful to our-
selves, useful to our fellow countrymen ?and, finally,
useful to the world. I beg, most cordially, to sup-
port the vote of thanks.
The President.
Are there any other Gentlemen who would wish
to make some observations, in addition to what has
been said ? We shall be exceedingly happy to hear
them.


John Waddington, Esq.
Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: ?In the
Iron trade, Whitby has not received the credit it
deserves, or has it been honoured as I think it ought
to be. It was from this district that the stone was
first introduced into the iron manufacture. In the
year 1837, the Whitby Stone Company, with some
others, including some of the manufacturers on the
Tyne tried the stone : and subsequently, a second
visit was made to the district. As to the value
of the iron : the London people reported, that it was
such rubbish, they could not call it iron; but the
Birtley Iron Company stated, it answered their end,
and said : ? If we can get it at a payable rate, we
shall be induced to try it.? They wrote subse-
quently : ?We are now enabled to use it along with
other stone in the neighbourhood, and from Corn-
wall.? Mr. Hunt then came, and bought thirty
thousand tons, and when he had used ten thousand
tons of that, he came and made a contract for four
years. He afterwards, in proceeding with the manu-
facture, informed me that, instead of using one third,
he was using nineteen parts of Whitby stone. It
was from him that, the impetus was given to the iron
trade of this district. In the year 1837, Mr. Walker
of this town, and Mr. Nicholas King, were deputed
by the Whitby Stone Company, to examine the


strata, ami they gave a most elaborate Report to the
Stone Company, shewing that they had discovered
this ironstone in the Cleveland Hills, and that it
dipped down towards Redcar, These hills were ex-
amined, and were well known to the Whitby Stone
Company, who exerted themselves to bring about,
and develope the resources of the country ; and Mr.
Hunt offered to> take a share in iron-works, if any
were established in Whitby ; hut all were then so
well satisfied with shipping, that not one would go
into the trade. Then, other iron-works slowly took
the stone, amongst the rest, the Derwent Iron Com-
pany came here, and obtained forty thousand tons.
Messrs. Bolckow and Vaughan, who were supplied
originally from this part of the country, thought
theirs was a discovery at Eston Nab, but far from
it. It is precisely the same stone as we are working
here. The seam is from fifteen to twenty feet thick,
and probably, ere long, that will be in active opera-
tion. There has been a very elaborate Report made,
within the last fortnight, of the mineral riches of
this district. The cost of producing iron at Gros-
mont, would be about two shillings higher than at
Middlesbrough. Probably, ere long, your valleys
will be defiled by smoky chimneys, filth and dirt;
and your ears deafened by the rolling of engines. I
cordially join in thanking the Doctor for his address.


Henry Pease, Esq.
Your very able lecturer has made only one error.
Mr. Pease, of whom he has spoken, and who has
had the honour to he the Member for South Durham,
is not present. lam his brother. 1 happen to be
a little acquainted with ironstone myself. I came
here to learn from your able Lecturer, and not to
speechify : but the iron question is strictly a national
question, and therefore, although an entire stranger
in Whitby, perhaps, I may not be out of place in
making a few remarks. Many in this room are
aware that, in order to the smelting of iron success-
fully, there must be the right amount of limestone,
and the right quantity of coal, or of cinder, or culm
?coke made from coal of a peculiar quality. . These
articles can all be obtained from the district to which
your attention has been directed, except the moun-
tain limestone. If you have the mountain limestone
within reasonable distance of Whitby, that will give
you a very decided advantage for the manufacture of
iron at your own doors. In the manufacture of iron
at Middlesbro?, the lime has to be carried a great
number of miles. Indeed, they are obliged to use a
great quantity of chalk, which is brought by the
ships that trade to London Avith coals, as ballast, in-
stead of the limestone, although the latter is brought
by the railway at very low charges. Now with re-


gard to the manufacture of iron at your town, there
is one other important point?that of iron shipbuild-
ing ; for although the ships of Whitby have been
peculiarly successful, there is no question that iron
is gradually stealing upon you and us, as compared
with Avood, for shipbuilding purposes : and not upon
us only, but it is stealing upon the public, and that
not very stealthily either ; for if you look at the
Clyde, you will see an immense business carried on.
You will find in a paper published at Glasgow, a list
of 30,000 tons of shipping, now building of iron
only. An iron ship requires as much iron as a very
considerable Icpgth of railway does, to build it. This
is an important fact for you, because if iron be steal-
ing upon you, in whole or in part, as a substitution
for wood, and thus far displacing it?if your port be
known as a port in which ships can be built of iron
?if it be known that you have iron ore in great
quantity (33 to 40 per cent.), if it be known, also,
that haematite ore can be obtained, or if that can be
brought to your port, you can thereby be enabled to
set on foot an iron shipbuilding establishment, which
would confer upon Whitby a stimulus, not merely
of a day, but with the growth and increase of our
country, would you grow, and your wealth increase
in proportion.
Now, perhaps, many of us have little idea of the


extent to which the iron trade is carried on. Lady
Guest, the widow of the late Sir John Guest, is at
this very time, consuming 2000 tons per diem, and
sending 1000 tons per day of bar iron from her roll-
ing mills. Now, can you suppose, that if the trade
which is in the hands of one lady?(and I am sorry
to say she is a widow) hut who, I believe, manages
it with great tact and skill ?be turning out of the
mill 1000 tons of bar iron per diem on an average,
what an enormous return per annum must be yielded.
I would conclude these remarks by suggesting how
far it would be your interest, as inhabitants of this
town, in conjunction with your able representative
(Mr. Robert Stephenson) ?and I am sure you are
highly honoured, and in this respect greatly privi-
leged, in having such a member ?to associate your-
selves together, and, aided by the experience of the
lecturer, to look far and near, sidewards and for-
wards, and see whether you can form a company of
gentlemen who will not rest until they have accom-
plished the object in view. It has been said that
the York and North Midland Railway Company are
apathetic, and will not further the object by making
the line to Guisbrough ; that, indeed, they are op-
posed to it; but I think this is only in appearance.
You will commonly find that railway companies will
not try to form a trade, yet if others would establish


it, they will not eventually oppose that which must
ultimately tend to their advantage. Ido not speak
this disinterestedly ; I am connected with railways
myself, as well as with iron.
I can confirm what your lecturer has said ; I can
venture to state that there is enough iron trade in
prospect for all of us, and if you are disposed to as-
sociate yourselves, as I have mentioned, I am certain
(and I am connected with the Guishrough and north
line and with the iron-works myself,) that any in-
formation that could he rendered by the gentlemen
connected with the Northern Iron-works, would he
afforded to you, so that nothing which has hy a kind
Providence been placed in this district, should he
lost to its inhabitants.
The Pkesident. It will now he my pleasing duty
to propose for your acceptance the vote of thanks to
Dr. Merryweather, for the important and interesting
Lecture he has given to us ; and it is a very gratify-
ing circumstance, that that Lecture has been pro-
ductive of our hearing so many practical, sound, and
sensible observations from the gentlemen present:
particularly, those emanating from the personal ex-
perience and practical knowledge of Mr. Pease, to
whom, I am sure, we must all feel exceedingly ob-
liged, for the kind manner in which he has expressed
himself towards us, and for the advantages that, he


has assured us, lie before us, and only need to be
turned to account. Ladies and gentlemen, may I
request of you to signify your approbation of Dr.
Merry weather?s lecture, by the general holding up of
a hand.
The thanks of the Meeting were then presented :
and acknowledged by
Dr. Merryweather.
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen :?I beg to
return you my heartfelt thanks for the honour you
have done me. lam sure it affords me the greatest
pleasure to come before you, to give a lecture ; and
I am glad to see so many ladies and young people
here. I beg to say that, 1 have no idea at all, that
ladies and young persons should be excluded from
scientific lectures. I think that ladies, on whom the
care and first instruction of children depend, ought to
know more about science, as the more likely they will
be able to teach the youthful mind. Now, science
appears to be too much conducted as a monopoly:
it is almost kept apart, to be monopolized by a few
societies of males; and the ladies and the rising youth
are all excluded. I have endeavoured on the present
occasion, to make a scientific lecture agreeable to all
of you?to every class. The lecture is an introduc-
tory one, and as you have approved of this, with
vour permission, I will prepare another : I shall go


on with the same subjects, and the next time I come
before you, I hope to bring forward various analyses
of the oolitic ironstone, and some other very useful
information.
The Lecture is to he published : it will be printed
in about a fortnight ;?one hundred copies are en-
gaged to go to London : one hundred to Birmingham
and Staffordshire: one hundred to the United States
of America : and one hundred to Australia.
The scheme of the Pamphlet, is to have the Rev.
Dr. Young?s antiquarian Map of this district, and
to have a frontispiece of the best view of Whitby,
and a plate of Staithes. There will be about seventy
pages, and the price will he one shilling. In addi-
tion, the excellent speeches, which have just been
made, will be appended. After Mr. Horne, the pub-
lisher, has been paid his expenses ; it is arranged
that whatever surplus there may be, it is to go to-
wards the new Museum :?and if we manage to get
a Monumental Tower, which I almost think we shall
(for Capt. Cook), of course it will he for the monu-
ment also?in fact, it will he for the general fund.
Now, I have had something to do with monuments:
when I published the last lecture, I had the honour
of bringing before this Society?on ? The Tempest
Prognosticator.??you will remember one part of
that lecture, where I paid a high compliment to the


celebrated Jenner ?the author of "V accination. I
thought it my duty, as a medical man, to do him all
the honour I could. I considered him to he one of
the greatest benefactors of the human race ; and I
stated that when foreigners came to the Great Exhi-
bition, many would ask to see the monument of our
immortal Jenner ! !
Well, the Royal Commissioners wrote to me for
fifty-two copies of that lecture, for the purpose of
distributing all over the world : ?so these copies
went, under that great authority, to all nations.
Now, mark, ?that it is nearly half a century since
Jenner died. 1 only, last week, saw in the ?Times,
an advertisement, in that colossal paper, of a sub-
scription for a monument to Hr. Jenner \ and His
Royal Highness Prince Albert at the head of it, with
three or four hundred pounds contributed from the
United States of America.
I have had something to do with that monument,
and it encourages me with respect to Capt. Cook?s.
In giving you lectures, I do every thing that I can,
and then submit it for your consideration, and then
ask you for your co-operation.
In delivering this lecture twice, before 000 per-
sons, that is 600 persons, if you each buy a copy ?
and I hope you all will ?that will make ï¿½3O at once.
I offer all my services gratuitously. lam certainly
anxious about the scheme I have brought before you.


If you approve of it, I trust you will give it all the
encouragement you can.
lam exceedingly obliged to you all; lam sure?
I return you my most grateful thanks, for having
listened to me so patiently ; I know that a scientific
lecture is a dry affair, and when I got among figures,
I was almost tired myself.
But now the pamphlet must be read to be appre-
ciated : I do not say any thing in praise of myself?
I do not take credit to myself?because it is a com-
pilation, and has brought forward such authority that
that it will have great influence in America?great
influence in Australia?great influence in Birming-
ham?in short, great influence in every place that
we want service from.
I have thought it right to make these suggestions,
and have thrown in, for your amusement, a little
humour to break the tedium. I believe we shall
have very good success ?only, I don?t want to be
unsuccessful I I know that the last lecture has been
spread all over, consequently, I have been receiving
letters from all parts of the world?l believe?l
think I have a box full.
I have promised you another lecture on, ? The
Tempest Prognosticator at present, we have other
subjects to deal with, and will try to get our iron
?FORWARD,? so that we can say that, ? Nothing
succeeds so well as success.?


On the following night , Dr. Merryweather re-
peated his Lecture to those who could not get
into the room on the first night; and the fol-
lowing remarks were afterwards made :?
George Parke, Esq.
I have very great pleasure in rising to propose,
?that the thanks of this audience he given to Dr.
Merry weather for his valuable Lecture,? hut previous
to this resolution being seconded, I wish to make a
few observations, which I think this audience will
not object to listen to. The reason for my doing so,
suggested Itself only last night, from the circum-
stance that after the Lecture by Dr. Merryweather,
several most interesting speeches were delivered by
Mr. Belcher, Mr. Vasey, Sen., Mr. Waddington, and
Henry Pease, Esq., of Darlington, of all which, I
am happy to state, an excellent report has been taken,
and will be communicated to the newspapers, next
week, and I am sure they will afford you great
pleasure in perusing.
Dr. Merryweather having made kind allusion to
me, I have been induced to prepare a statement,
which I wish to introduce to your notice, if you will
give me your kind attention.
The inhabitants of Whitby and the neighbourhood,
will for ever be indebted to Dr. Merryweather, for his
valuable Lecture, it will lay the foundation of many


new projects, the carrying out of which, will be of
incalculable benefit to this town ; in the course of a
few years, the value of houses and land in the town
and neighbourhood will be enhanced, the population
will increase, and the circulation of money among
tradesmen will be immense. From a desire to pro-
mote the interest of the town, and having studied
Railway statistics, I recently issued two or three cir-
culars hearing upon a northern line of railway, which
I have always thought, and still think, belongs to the
York and North Midland Company, and ought, by
them to he carried out. It would be a great benefit
to the Whitby and Pickering Branch, which has cost
360,000?. or 15,000?. per mile : it might now be
made for much less than half that amount. I men-
tion the following facts for the purpose of shewing
that new railways at this period of our history, can
be proved to be highly remunerative, and good sound,
and safe investments. The York and North Midland
is 279 miles in length, it stands at a cost of upwards
of 7,000,0002., or 24,000?. per mile. The following
is an estimate of what the line could now be made
for, viz., 50 miles at 15,000?. per mile, and 229 miles
at 8,000?. per mile, making a total of 2,580,000?.
This cannot be an over estimate, when it is consider-
ed that several new railways will be opened shortly,
for traffic, others are under contract, and others are


before Parliament, the cost of which is little above
5,000?. per mile.
The receipts of the York and North Midland Com-
pany, for the year ending 1852, were upwards of
458,000?., which, after deducting working expenses,
rates, taxes, and permanent way fund, would pay on
the above estimates of 2,580,000?., a dividend of 10
per cent, per annum. I firmly believe that if the
York and North Midland Railway Company, would
make the proposed north line from Grosmont, direct
to the coal fields, (as it is desirable to have coal to
smelt our ironstone on the spot, and the cheaper it
can be obtained, the more profitable,) and in what-
ever direction the line goes, the Guisbro? line must
run into it, they must work amicably, so that both
will be benefitted.
The line in summer, would be very productive by
cheap passenger trains, from Edinburgh, Berwick,
Newcastle, Sunderland, Durham, Stockton, Middles-
bro?, Guisbro?, Darlington, Northallerton, and all
parts of the north, thus avoiding the Inclined plane
at Goathland, which, the first promoters of the
Whitby and Pickering Railway would have avoided
by going round the hill, but for want of capital.
The day, however, is not far distant, when this will
have to be done. I have no hesitation in asserting,
that the north line, if economically made and worked,


and a liberal spirit manifested by the shareholders,
in selling at a cheap rate, or giving the land, will
ultimately pay 10 per cent, to the York and North
Midland Company ; they can work it cheaper than
any other company in connection with their own line.
Ihe present Tork and North Midland Directors
came into power, under very unfavourable auspices.
The money market, at that time, was much agitated,
commanding as high as 8 per cent, interest; and the
affairs of the Company were in a very embarrassed
position. The Directors could not, however desirous,
have made the North line to Castleton. They are
now rapidly emerging out of difficulty, and the amal-
gamation with the York, Newcastle and Berwick,
and Leeds Northern, will place them in easy circum-
stances, and they will rise to great prosperity. I
am inclined to think, that the time for final decision
on the part of the York and North Midland Railway,
as to making the north line, has now arrived, and a
clause ought to be inserted in the amalgamation bill,
now before Parliament, to the effect, that, in the
event of the York and North Midland Company not
making the line, and that, should another company
be formed for the purpose, that company shall not
be obstructed by unreasonable rates of toll, or run-
ning powers ; or rather, that certain rates of toll, or
other privileges, within the bounds of reason, shall


be granted by the York and North Midland Company,
on their line from Grosmont to Whitby ; otherwise
amalgamation powers may reasonably be considered
as bordering on monopoly, or closing the door to
public accommodation. I suggest this for the con-
sideration of the Yiscount Downe, The Honourable
Octavius Buncombe, M. P. for this Riding; the suc-
cessors of the late R. C. Elwes, Esq.; Wm, Brown,
Esq., our respected townsman; James Wilkinson,
Esq., of Aislaby ; and all other landowners through
whose property, the northern line would run, I also
suggest to them for their own interests, to be so kind
as offer their land at a moderate rate at once, as
their property would much enhance in value, by means
of railway transit through it. lam anxious to leave
no stone unturned, by way of promoting this railway.
In some respects I labour under disadvantages by not
being a man of wealth, I dare not call a meeting of
the inhabitants, for the purpose of memorializing
the directors of the York and North Midland Rail-
way, though such memorial, I am sure, would be
numerously signed. I am exceedingly obliged to
many gentlemen and respected tradesmen, who have
personally expressed their approbation of my circu-
lars. I cannot but think, that if the gentlemen of
this town, would co-operate with the tradesmen, by
way of getting up a memorial, or adopting some


other means whereby a demonstration may be made,
they would confer a boon upon the town, entitle
themselves to the highest respect, and render lasting
and Important service to the public.
Our connection with the York and North Midland
Railway, gave rise to the building of the new town, on
the West Cliff. This beautiful room and commodious
Hotel, in which we are now assembled, the numerous
houses now built, and being built, and from 3 to 400
in addition, now being marked out by the talented
architect, Mr. Dobson, shews the advantage of rail-
way communication ; the thousands of visitors to this
splendid watering place within the last three years,
leaving with the most favourable impression, express-
ing themselves utterly astonished that such a delight-
ful country existed, is another favourable feature.
I am given to understand that Geosge Hudson, Esq.,
M. P., the spirited proprietor of the New Town, (to
whom the inhabitants of Whitby are, and ever will
be, deeply indebted, for the benefit he has conferred
upon them,) is determined to spare no expense in
making the New Town as attractive as possible; and
such energy and enterprize will, undoubtedly, some
day, realize to the spirited proprietor and his succes-
sors, a splendid fortune. I think it proper to assert
that this building project, originated by Mr. Hudson,
has already brought, and will continue to bring, an


immense benefit to the York and North Midland
Railway, in passenger receipts. The electric tele-
graph, that has performed such wonders since its in-
vention, ought to be laid from Rillington to Whitby.
The Government of the country ought to have a
Telegraph to every sea-port town in England, other-
wise they must be unprepared for foreign invasion ;
it might be of serious consequence to us at Whitby,
were the enemy to land here, thus, for want of the
telegraph to summon the aid of soldiers from the
Interior, we might all be demolished. To Ship
owners, Shipping Insurance Companies, Merchants,
and Tradesmen, (fee., the telegraph would be of in-
calculable benefit. I hope I may not be considered
as taking a liberty, in mentioning the name of Gideon
Sraales, Esq., one of the largest shipowners in the
port, whom I congratulate, in having been so suc-
cessful, by a kind Providence smiling upon his in-
dustry and skill. The telegraph to Mr. Smales,
might easily be worth 100 Z. per annum, or more.
Suppose he has a ship ashore at Scarbro?, or any
other place, and the ship is uninsured, the intelligence
is immediately conveyed to Mr. Smales, by tele-
graph, off he starts, and is soon on the spot; and his
skill and energy being sharpened by non-insurance,
and the chances of saving the ship from destruction,
he accomplishes his object, caused entirely by being


half of this company, its sincere thanks to Dr.
Merryweather, for the Lecture he has given us this
evening, and in also expressing a hope, that in the
next Lecture, he will adduce additional facts, and
shew that Iron will have to he the saviour of our
district, after all.
THE END.
