AERIAL VIEW OF FARM AND BUILDINGS.
"Navua" is recognised as an Arboretum under the De-
partment of Agriculture for the propagation and growing
of native and commercial flora. This scheme of develop-
ment, under the direction of the Curator of the Botanical
Gardens, has resulted in the planting of some four
thousand trees and shrubs especially featuring various
native pines, silky oak, eucalypts, tung oil trees, pop-
lars, elms, etc. This is an illustrative example of what
beautification can be accomplished in co-operation with
expert advice, all tending to make country living
attractive.

Foreword
THE foundation of NAVUA STUD FARM, specialising in
the breeding of Jersey Cattle and Berkshire Pigs, was deter-
mined after years of consideration as to the particular
demands for the improvement of this breed of cattle and pigs
in Australia.
The policy determined was to breed from the Company's
own importations from Jersey Island-bred stock and English
Berkshire Pigs. To give effect to such, we imported through
that famous American Breeding Establishment, Meridale
Farms. The Managing Partner of Meridale, Mr. P. A. Dutton,
made selection on our behalf on the Island of our original
draft of cattle consisting of six females and one bull, Bravo's
Lad—63B4.
We, in furtherance of our pre-determined policy, have since
added three importations of Island stock, specially selected
by our representative from New South Wales. The first of
these comprised ten females and one bull, Kahoka's Lucky
Boy—9138; the second twenty-two females; and the third
ten females and one bull, Dreamer's Hamptonne Star —
Vol. 22. The females in the several importations were mated
and in calf to the leading Island Sires, and such policy gives
to clients a wide range in selection for their schemes of
breeding. Frequent importations determines that the quality
and Island type of "Navua'' stock will be maintained, and
young stock are available to buyers at reasonable prices
from such foundation animals in our herd.
In reference to our pigs, we found these a necessary corollary
to our Jerseys and also entered on something distinctive. We
availed ourselves of the services of Mr. Andy Gray, Senior
Piggery Instructor of the New South Wales Department of
Agriculture, while on a visit to Great Britain, to select on our
behalf. Such selections of English stock, together with our
American and Australian stock, has established an excep-
tional stud of this profitable adjunct to the dairy farmer's
MAKING FRIENDS.
business. To maintain those regular conditions so necessary
to the successful maintenance of breeding stock, "Navua"
has, in the selection of the farm site, carefully surveyed all
the possibilities of dry seasons, etc., and is completely safe-
guarded in respect of such. Our Farm originally comprised
some 160 acres, which we have found necessary to increase,
by an additional purchase of farm land adjoining, to 300
acres. It is of sweet, undulating country with a large propor-
tion of river flats, situated in the County of Cook, some 45
miles by road from Sydney at the foothills of the Kurrajong
Mountains, a section of our Blue Mountain Coast range, and
has a frontage of 2 miles to the Grose River, which forms our
Eastern boundary. This river frontage is devoted to growing
fodder crops comprising Lucerne, Egyptian Clover, Oats,
Corn, etc., and is arranged for irrigation from the river by
our electrically-driven centrifugal pumps. This method of
farming our land ensures abundance of green rations to our
stock irrespective of seasonal rainfall conditions. The grazing
areas are divided into small sections of cultivated pasture

grasses, principally Perennial Rye and the various types of
Clovers. This permits rotational grazing under systematic
and orderly methods.
Fodder conservation is another phase not overlooked, and
when our objective is attained we will hold over 1,000 tons
of silage on the Farm in specially constructed concrete silos.
We concentrate principally on Maize Silage, but to vary such
have introduced Oats and Barley Silage. In addition to our
silos we will have storage capacity capable of holding some
400 tons of Oaten and Lucerne Hay, this being chaffed for
use as required for the preparation of concentrated feeds.
Supplementary feed rooms are incorporated in the various
buildings housing the animals which permits of regular
feeding with the minimum of labour. The general construc-
tion of the farm buildings is of concrete, and special attention
is directed to sanitation and drainage. All services necessary
to the proper hygienic conduct of the enterprise are con-
nected to our sewerage system. Over 7,000 feet of salt-glazed
pipes are installed, which indicates the thorough attention
that has been given to this most essential requirement.
The milking bails are fitted with latest type steel pipe

divisions with continuous concrete feed troughs, which is the
principle adopted in all the up-to-date dairies in the U.S.A.
as the most hygienic, and were determined upon by the
Governing Director after noting their general use during a
recent visit abroad.
The bails are fitted with the flexible neck yoke of Louden
pattern, which allows the animals the maximum freedom
with security during time in bails.
Our dairy for milk treatment comprises a wash and storage
for cans, testing laboratory, milk receiving room, separating
room and storage room for delivery, most complete in every
respect. All windows, doors, eaves and ventilators are fly
and mosquito proof, with specially operating ventilating gear
to lantern sky lights. The floors and walls are tiled through-
out, with special attention to wash down drainage. The
utmost care was given to this construction, and "up-to-the-
minute" methods employed to ensure the maximum in dairy
hygiene. Hot and cold water circulates through the cow bails
and dairy, each animal receiving attention before milking.
The calf rearing house, which is a most important section, has
received the attention and consideration in design and con-
struction so necessary to successful rearing of calves. We
house the young animals at nightfall, and each has its sep-
arate loose box with individual tinned feeding trough and
bucket. These receive the same attention as our milking
appliances, with the result that calf troubles are practically
unknown at "Navua." Each animal is bedded down at even-
ing, and the floor drainage is so arranged that the animal is
always on dry bedding.
The increasing demand for "Navua" stock, and the ever
widening of their distribution, assures us that our policy is
meeting with the approval of buyers. It is with every confi-
dence that we will continue to produce and distribute the
Island type of animal that will make for the improvement
in production and advancement of the Jersey cow in
Australia.

Shipment and Care of Cattle
Purchase of animals from ''Navua'' covers and includes their care to point
of despatch, rail or steamer, also the supply of weatherproof rug, headstall and
lead rope. If it is required that young stock be crated or any special conditions
requested by purchasers, such additional costs to be on buyers' account.
THE "NAVUA" GUARANTEE.
The "Navua" guarantee is so comprehensive that the underlying principle
involved is to make every sale produce a satisfied customer. This is the best
advertisement, and the greatest asset that any breeding establishment can
possess. Our guarantee is based upon the assumption that both buyer and
seller are honest, and that each recognises and accepts his responsibility in a
transaction that is finalised for the mutual benefit of both parties, and also for
the advancement and welfare of the Jersey breed.
To achieve this object "Navua" undertakes to give a customer all the facts in
their possession concerning any animal in which he is interested and guar-
antees, without question, that it shall be as so represented. This applies to
everything which may have a bearing upon the value of the animal. The selling
policy of "Navua" is so open and above board that there is little opportunity
of any misunderstanding. When the question of price is agreed upon and any
Veterinarian's inspection made, if so requested by the buyer, the buyer can
safely take possession with the assurance that he knows as much about the
animal that he has purchased as the seller does. All animals are sold at
"Navua" by private treaty and at reasonable prices. There are many advantages
to both buyer and seller if personal contact can be made, as if the purchaser
is enabled to view our animals it affords him the opportunity to make com-
parisons and selections to his own liking. In compiling the illustrations
throughout this Catalogue, such were obtained by a single visit of our photo-
grapher to the Farm, and gives a straightforward indication of the animals under
everyday conditions and in various stages of their work. This, we think, is a
more reliable way of giving to our customers a clear idea of what they might
expect to see on a visit to the Farm. No animal has been specially prepared
to be photographed.

PRODUCTION TEST
All cows in the Navua Stud are tested for production by the Dairy Branch of the Department
of Agriculture, New South Wales. Buyers can inspect official production and daily records
when selecting stock at "Navua." We test all cows in the herd, and make no special selection.
Normal feeding methods are pursued throughout the whole herd.
TUBERCULIN TEST
All dairy cattle in the Navua Stud over the age of six months are subjected to a Tuberculin Test
by Veterinary Officers of the Stock Branch of the New South Wales Government as required
for recording and gazetting the herd as a "Tubercle Free Herd."
CONTAGIOUS ABORTION (6*n g ' s Di*e« e ) TEST
All dairy cattle in the Navua Stud are subjected to the above test and conditions required by the
Stock Department, and the herd is gazetted Abortion Free by the Department of Agriculture of
the New South Wales Government.
The above tests ensure that purchasers can with every confidence depend upon the stock
being free from the two most prevalent disease menaces evident in cattle of to-day.

IMPORTED JERSEYS
IN BAILS
The diversity of blood lines in the
members of our Jersey herd will
enable us to supply superior young
bulls in almost any family you
may prefer.
This picture illustrates the animals in the milking bails. We
accommodate 24 animals at each feeding, and while the
utmost freedom is given the animal, they are so spaced as to
be out of reach of one another, being securely locked in the
Louden Flexible Yoke which permits the animal to secure
the feed over the full range of trough allotted her. The troughs
are slightly inclined to the drainage system to permit of easy
washing down, which is carried out daily. The floors of the
stalls are also laid with slight slope to shallow rectangular
drain at back of stalls, which permits at all times maintaining
that necessary standard of cleanliness so essential in the
handling of milk.
The width of the feed alley is ample for the entry of our
wheeled feed trolleys from the feed store at end, and each
cow's feed is portioned out as to the individual requirement.
The method of handling is most complete and labour-saving,
as the feed is prepared on the trolleys, covered over, and
placed in the mangers just before feeding.

BULL YARDS
In designing this most important section, due regard was
given to the restrictions necessary to herd Sires, and yards of
ample proportions for exercise were provided.
In our scheme the yards were placed so that the animals were
not segregated to some secluded out-of-the-way corner. We
have four yards, two each side of main drive way with a loose
box 14ft. x 12ft. for each animal. These are constructed of
concrete, close boarded on inside, with opening shutters on all
sides, thereby ensuring positive protection from the weather yet
ample ventilation. Each pair of Bull houses has a small feed-
room attached, and the feed can be placed through trap-door
to manger with no need to enter the loose box, and each yard
is supplied with individual concrete watering trough.
Around the yard fences are planted shade trees for the protec-
tion of the animals, and are in harmony with the general scheme
of beautification. Our fences, we claim, are everlasting, the
uprights being steel channels and the rails galvanised piping
2in. diameter, and makes altogether a very attractive ensemble.

ESTABLISHING A REGISTERED HERD
• One often hears amongst dairymen that the establish-
ment of a registered herd is not worth the trouble inciden-
tal thereto. Progress since the earliest days has run hand
in hand with those who are enthusiastic. The desire to suc-
ceed more than compensates for the additional thought
necessary to conduct and manage a registered herd, for
after all a registered animal consumes no more than perhaps
a grade or nondescript.
The methods evident in establishing a registered herd are:—
1. The purchasing of a herd of mature animals.
2. The purchase of a calf herd and rearing to a breeding
age.
3. Purchase of a few registered foundation cows and bull,
and building up a herd of descendants from such
foundation stock.
This is the most economical method, as a farmer can intro-
duce two or three registered females with a registered bull,
and the progeny of such, when in profit, replacing the grades.
It is remarkable how soon this scheme will eventually
change a grade herd into registered pure-breds. This scheme
can be applied to a change over from one particular breed
to Jerseys if occasion demands such a policy for that
objective—PßOFlT—which is the incentive to all progress.
If a careful selection is made in the foundation animals it
enables one to make himself practically independent of
external resources so far as his females are concerned, and
thus greatly increase his possibility of having a disease-free
herd.

Water Sto rage
• Concrete water tanks are a feature at
"Navua,'' and are placed in such positions that
the run off can be (if necessity arises) used for
irrigation over pastures, and is indicative of the
detail and careful attention given to all phases
likely to arise in the successful conduct of the
farming side of our enterprise. The total storage
of water aimed at is one-half million gallons
and, to indicate the freedom of water usage at
"Navua," our weekly consumption is some
30,000 gallons. Water is reticulated to each
grazing paddock and supplied to stock in con-
crete troughs permanently full by self-regulating
automatic valves. No labour is required water-
ing stock, and water is available to the animals,
thus ensuring abundance at all times. Our
supply and water conservation is one which
is frequently commented on by visitors.
CALF-REARING PENS, SHOWING CENTRAL FEED ALLEY.
FENCING
The fencing shown here is a feature at "Navua." The posts
are constructed of reinforced concrete, spaced eight to a
chain, and are so arranged that the straining wires are on
the face of the posts.
This permits of ease in fixing the rabbit-proof netting and
completes a permanent fence, entirely immune from the
ravages of white ants and fire. This type of fence sur-
rounds the whole property.
Jersey buyers will find genuine help and co-operation at
"Navua."
• This building is so placed to obtain the
maximum amount of sunlight, yet be protected
from the cold winds of winter by a system of
drop shutters which, when not in use, are
fastened under the wide overhang of roof.
These can be lowered by the turn of a clip
and afford complete comfort to the animals
housed. Our calves enter each cubicle from
the outside, and are fed from the central feed
alley clearly shown. Each calf has its own
tinned steel milk bucket and feed trough, and
the utmost attention is given to the cleanliness
of these implements and calf pens. "Navua"
manufactures its own fly spray and uses it
daily. The floor drainage is arranged to im-
mediately leave the pens, and all animals are
bedded down on removable wood floors for
ease in hosing down and cleansing. Under
these conditions of rearing calves there are no
setbacks, and the young animals are given the
best possible chance of development.

Why Choose The jersey Breed?
• Many engaged in dairying have reasons for handling
various breeds and if it has been their life work handling
stock, the breed so handled is almost a family tradition and
one rarely sees a departure or cross over to another breed.
Entering the business of dairy farming with an open mind
as to stock selection, one on investigation finds that the
results achieved by the Jersey breed as demonstrated by
text books and statistical data clearly indicate the conclusion
that the Jersey Cow is pre-eminent as the most economical
producer. Dairy Colleges throughout various countries have,
over a period of many years of record keeping, placed the
breed foremost as giving the best results on the basis of
food consumption either in the avenue of supplementary
feeding or natural pasture. Less concentrates need be given
and more cows can be grazed if the herd be Jerseys.
Many flattering appellations are accorded the breed, all
extolling its ability and greatness. Phrases such as Profit
Breed —Greatest Dairy Cow in the World —Queen of the
Dairy—The Most Efficient Dairy Machine in Existence —can-
not be accorded a breed without records established support-
ing such adulatory terms. The Jersey as well as subscribing
to the production and profit side of business is without ques-
tion the most beautiful breed of dairy animals. In claiming
this one does not infer that the other dairy breeds are devoid
of beauty, in fact, the writer "takes off his hat to every good
dairy cow" irrespective of breed.
Economy in production has long been established as a
Jersey character and perhaps a reason for such is that Jersey
cattle can claim breeding as Jerseys for a longer period of
years than many of the other breeds. In 1789 Jersey passed a
law which is still in force that no cattle were allowed to be
imported except for immediate slaughter. Even Jersey cattle
taken to England and France adjacent thereto for Show pur-
poses are not to be returned.
The outstanding prepotency of the Jersey is attributed to this
purity of breeding. When one goes back to 1789 in pure
bloods it would be rather a freak to get a throw-back in the
registered cattle. Following the axiom as handed to us in
Mendel's Laws of Breeding—" Like begets like or the likeness
of some ancestors" one is fairly secure in claiming pre-
potency for the breed. This is amply demonstrated in world-
wide show ring results. Champion Sires have produced their
like and high production dams have produced high produc-
tion daughters. So wide is the popularity of the breed that
the cattle have penetrated into all corners of the earth and it
can truthfully be said—
" That the sun never sets on a Jersey."
If you want to improve your type, your production, and
establish a herd of real breeding cows, we recommend a bull
from one of our foundation cows.

INFECTIOUS - CONTAGIOUS - ABORTION
or BANG'S DISEASE
• Bang's Disease, infectious abortion, contagious abortion,
and abortion disease are different names for a livestock dis-
ease, especially prevalent in cattle that causes heavy loss to
dairymen and stockmen generally, the disease being com-
mon to both dairy and beef animals. It has existed for cen-
turies although for a long time its cause remained obscure.
During recent years it has gained additional prominence and
has become a matter of growing concern to those engaged
in raising or handling cattle. As interest in the production of
better stock has increased and as the long-distance shipment
of animals has become more common, conditions have not
only become more favorable for the spread of the disease
but have made the losses which it causes of greater conse-
quence to cattle owners.
NATURE OE TEE DISEASE
Bang's Disease has puzzled stock owners and has been the
subject of much controversy among investigators. There has
been a tendency to regard the act of abortion, its most usually
observed symptom or manifestation, as the disease itself.
Viewed in this manner it has been natural to suppose that
the malady may commonly be acquired just before the act
of abortion and that recovery has taken place when the
generative organs show evidence of having assumed their
normal condition. Experimental studies have plainly shown
that this conception of the disease is erroneous and have at
the same time revealed something of its true nature.
It has been determined that the act of abortion is merely one
symptom or manifestation of the disease, a rather inconstant
one in fact, and that abortion, when it occurs, is commonly
induced by a diseased condition of the membranes through
which oxygen and nourishment pass from the dam to the
fetus. The diseased condition is brought about by the action
of germs which may have invaded the uterus of the dam
7L At
viL£i
St


NATURE OF IFF DISEASE, contJ.
weeks or even months previously. If the gestation period
is well advanced before the membranes become severely
affected the calf may be weak but living when expelled.
When the infection becomes severe during the earlier months
of gestation, the fetus is usually dead on expulsion. Whether
the dam expels a dead fetus or a calf with sufficient vigor to
survive is determined to a great degree by her ability to
resist the action of these germs.
Although the act of abortion is the most readily observed
symptom of the disease, it has been noted also that in
affected herds sterility, or barrenness, is commonly more or
less troublesome; animals give birth to calves which,
although living, may be too weak to resist some of the more
common ailments; cows show a tendency to retain their
afterbirths, and a reduced milk production is occasioned in
dairy herds by the failure of animals to complete their normal
gestation periods. Losses due to these conditions may equal
or even exceed those represented by the number of calves
that are born dead.
TEE DISEASE AND ITS EEEECTS
Infectious abortion of cattle has been known from the earliest
times. The contagious nature of the disease was recognised
long before the cause was ascertained. Professors Bang,
a Danish investigator, and Stribolt in 1897 isolated the causa-
tive agent of the disease in Denmark. Bang was able to
produce abortions and premature births by infecting healthy
pregnant cows with the organism that had been recovered
from the products of other abortions. These findings were
subsequently confirmed by McFadyean and Stockman and
by other workers throughout the world. During 1887 David
Bruce, a surgeon in the British Army, when investigating a
human disease known as Malta, Mediterranean, or undulant
fever, isolated a micro-organism, and some twenty-one years
after the discovery by Bang a Miss Alice C. Evans, an
employee of the United States Department of Agriculture,
observed a close similarity of the two organisms. The name
Brucella Abortus was given the organism in honour of
Bruce, the first discoverer of the germs.
Infectious abortion of cattle is as great a menace to the
cattle industry as tuberculosis, if indeed it is not greater.
Abortion is not always its most harmful manifestation, and
for this reason it has in recent years been renamed Bang's
Disease, after the discoverer of this infection.

Contagious Abortion (continued) .
It has been shown by Rinjard, of France, that Brucella Abortus
was associated with poll-evil and fistulous withers in horses.
This work has been confirmed in the United States, Holland,
Sweden and Australia. It is not known how the organism
gains entrance to the body, or whether it is the primary
cause or merely a secondary invader, but there is no doubt
that it can produce suppurative processes in the horse, and
the blood test indicates a well-marked reaction.
CALVES
It is very fortunate that the calves of infected cows, with
very few exceptions, are not permanently infected. Even
though the fetal membranes and the milk contain Brucella
Abortus, and the calf shows a high blood reaction, this will
disappear when the calf is weaned or changed to a clean
milk supply, and removed from other sources of infection.
This possibility of obtaining calves from valuable cows is
something that owners of such animals should realise.
While the calf is receiving infected milk it may be a spreader
of infection, for it has been shown that Brucella Abortus may
be recovered unchanged after passage through these animals.
It is therefore dangerous to move calves from infected
cattle or association into a clean herd without a period of
local quarantine, preferably in two stages of fresh pasturing
which should be carried out before they become sexually
mature.
ADVANTAGES op a negative eerd
The great advantage of a negative herd lies in the improved
health and efficiency of the animals. Breeding troubles
largely increased by Bang's Disease means fewer calves,
smaller milk yield and economic loss generally. Profit is
only obtained by the ability of the cow to produce on the
basis of milk supply and reproduction of species. The pos-
session of a negative herd increases the demand for young
stock, as the tendency of buyers is to add to herds only
from Accredited Free breeding establishments.

VACCINATION, DRUGS AND MINERALS
• At the present time there is no cure for Bang's Disease.
Whether something will eventually be developed which
will have a curative action remains to be seen, but at the
present time there is no question as to the truth of this state-
ment. If owners of livestock would only believe this, they
would be saved a good deal of money and disappointment.
A small number of animals may recover from the disease,
but no known remedy will hasten this natural process.
Also, there is no satisfactory method of immunising animals
so that they will not contract the disease. Such success as
has been attributed to vaccination has been in prevention of
the act of abortion, and not to its ability to keep the animal
free from infection. In fact, the animal must be artificially
infected before breeding in order to bring this about.
Abortions are not always the most important manifestation
of Bang's Disease. In a herd in which the animals have
passed through the acute stage, and have developed a certain
tolerance to infection, abortions may cease for a time. This
cessation of abortions has misled many in judging the effi-
cacy of prophylactic and curative agents. Treatment is usually
commenced during the acute stage, and the following year,
when the number of abortions has been much reduced by
the development of a degree of tolerance, the credit for this
is ascribed to the agent employed.
No drug has proved of any value in the control of Bang's
Disease up to the present time. Many substances have been
tried by mouth, by injection under the skin and into the blood
circulation without any evidence of benefit. The difficulty is
that any substance capable of destroying Brucella Abortus
in the body would also prove fatal to the animal. The
history of intravenous injections for the destruction of the
true bacteria, to which Brucella Abortus belongs, is not en-
couraging. Medicinal substances for the treatment of this
disease have gained their popularity, almost if not entirely,
because they were used and their value was judged at a
time when the disease had run its natural course.
There is no acceptable evidence that minerals are of value
in the control of Bang's Disease. Abortions and other breed-
ing troubles have been produced experimentally by some
workers by feeding a mineral-deficient diet, and minerals
undoubtedly have an important place where such a condition
exists, but they do not influence the course of Bang's Disease
in an otherwise normal herd.

RETAINED AFTERBIRTH
• Retention of the afterbirth is a common condition in
herds, and owners are frequently at a loss to know what to
do when this occurs. Since the afterbirth of healthy animals
often is not expelled until after a few hours, owners are
justified in viewing its retention with little alarm until twenty-
four hours after the act of abortion or parturition, provided
the animal appears to be normal otherwise. Retention of the
afterbirth longer than twenty-four hours signifies that inflam-
mation of the uterus may be present and responsible for its
adherence. When the afterbirth has been retained for two
or three days its putrefaction usually becomes marked. In
this putrefactive process within the uterus poisonous sub-
stances may be generated and absorbed by the animal, caus-
ing fever, loss of appetite, and other evidences of severe
trouble. Invasion of the blood stream by the bacteria may
terminate fatally.
The afterbirth is frequently removed before putrefaction is
excessive by reaching into the uterus with the hand and
separating as carefully as possible the attached areas and
flushing the organ out afterwards with mild antiseptic so-
lutions or warm salt water. The flushing may be done by the
use of a soft rubber tube with a diameter of about half an
inch, to which a funnel is attached. The fluid should not be
allowed to remain long in the uterus, but should be syphoned
out by lowering the external end of the tube when filled
with the fluid.
The afterbirth can seldom be removed by hand without caus-
ing some injury to the uterine walls, a factor that renders
the operation of uncertain value. A putrefactive afterbirth in
contact with injured uterine walls may readily be more harm-
ful and more likely to kill the animal than is its contact
with an uninjured uterine surface.
A less drastic method is consequently often advisable. This
method permits the afterbirth to remain attached to the uterine
walls while, by introducing mild antiseptic substances into
the uterus, the rapid multiplication of germs is prevented until
the membranes come away of themselves. Separating the
pendent portion of the afterbirth from the retained part about
six or eight inches exterior to the vulva is a means of reduc-
ing the contamination of surroundings. A dram (level tea-
spoonful) of iodoform, combined with a quart of olive oil, and
introduced into the uterus through a rubber tube is recom-
mended. The milk of animals so treated may have an iodo-
form odour for several days, and therefore should not be
used for food. Such irrigating fluids as those mentioned for
washing out the uterus after removal of the afterbirth by hand
may be used, but seem to be less efficient than iodoform and
oil. It is seldom advisable to introduce irrigating fluids more
often than once a day or once in two days. Although animals
have been known to retain the afterbirth for as long as ten
days, after a single administration of iodoform and oil, as
described, they appeared to experience little discomfort or
harm.
Retention of the afterbirth is a more serious condition than
often realised, since it may be followed by or induce barren-
ness. Because of this fact the assistance and experience of
a qualified veterinarian are highly desirable.
DAIRY COWS AND SALT
• It is more essential to provide the dairy cow with an
adequate supply of salt than any other animal on the farm.
In the manufacture of milk she requires considerable salt,
and unless it is provided the cow will develop abnormalities.
Cows require varying quantities, usually determined by the
milk yield. A good practice to adopt is to mix about 11b. of
salt to each lOOlbs. of feed, and arrange that in addition the
cows have free access to a lick containing salt as one of
the principal ingredients.
In the following lick the animal is certain to obtain all the
salt she requires:—
Salt 40 parts
Sulphate of iron 1 part
Bonemeal 10 to 20 parts
The addition of a little Molasses will add to the palatability
of the mixture.

Li ne Breeding and In-Breeding
LINE BREEDING
• These two terms are frequently and freely discussed by
dairymen, and one finds it difficult to follow the various
contentions and theories on the respective merits of such
breeding schemes.
Line breeding has great advantages and few disadvantages.
No other system of breeding has produced such satisfactory
results or is likely to be evolved, as following line breeding
to a successful end demands the careful selection of respec-
tive animals with a proven line of descendants holding to
definite characteristics. Line breeding permits of concentra-
tion on type and quality by selection from the numerous de-
scendants of a good individual animal. This careful selection
is of vital importance. A breeder who breeds on pedigree
alone without exercising the utmost discriminating care in his
selection of animals to be mated within the line of breeding
chosen is liable to meet with disappointment. His beliefs
in the efficacy of such a system may be shaken.
Pedigree is a guarantee of blood lines only, and presents to
the breeder a field inside which he can select and breed from
with confidence.
IN-BREEDING
A system of breeding similar to line breeding only carried
to dangerous limits by the mating of very closely related
individuals in the ancestral line of descent. The accompany-
ing diagrams of the respective systems are explanatory.
2 and 3 are respectively a son and daughter of 4, and mated
to produce 1, therefore 1 is in-bred.

The dam of No. 2 and sire of No. 6 are brother and sister,
2 and 3 are cousins, and 1 is in-bred.
Sire 2 is a grandson of 9. The dam 3 traces to 9, four genera-
tions back, and are distantly related, therefore line-bred.

RANDLE TEE COW KINDLY
* The fundamental basis of dairying is closely linked up
and based on the maternity of the cow. Seeing that the cow
is a mother, it is of the utmost importance that she be treated
with kindness, with care and regularity in the matter of feed-
ing and milking, and she will do her share in responding to
such consideration. This is definitely proven by results, and
the spectacle of a person on horseback and accompanied
with dogs chasing cows up to the bails, or the display of
bad temper when milking, can only have one effect —that is,
a reduced quantity of milk. It is a cow's affection for her calf
that prompts her to give milk, and if a person handling cows
can gain the confidence of the animals by kindness in treat-
ment, it will be found the animals are glad to come to the
bails and will give of their best to the person tending them.

RESPONSIBILITY OP SROW JUDGING
TO BREEDING
• To-day the animal which is generally the most popular
as a breeding animal is the one which has won the highest
awards in the show ring. It seems, therefore, that with few
exceptions the judges of a breed are the men who shape the
destiny of particular breeds. They select individuals which
they deem the best, and in some cases without the neces-
sary consideration as to whether they are the best for their
respective purposes or not. A few men to-day are to be
praised or blamed for the types of the breeds of to-morrow.
The animals which they adjudge to be the best will be in
demand and selected as breeding stock, and shall surely
stamp the future stock with their characteristics. How im-
portant then is it for judges to get together on a definite
determined standard type and consistently award prizes only
to animals conforming to such ideals, always mindful that
the animal to be judged is at one end of the lead rope only.
Foresight is an attribute of intelligence.


MAP OF JERSEY ISLAND INDICATING PARISH BOUNDARIES AND PRINCIPAL ROADS. THE ISLAND IS DENSELY
POPULATED AND IS A POPULAR HOLIDAY RESORT FOR VISITORS DURING SUMMER MONTHS.
Jersey Island
• The Island of Jersey is the largest of the group known
as the Channel Islands, and is sixteen miles west of Nor-
mandy (France) and 125 miles south of Southampton (Eng-
land). It is about 11 miles east to west, by an average width
of 4i miles—4s square miles, or about 28,800 acres.
The Islands were part of the territory of the Duke of Nor-
mandy, and on William of Normandy becoming King of
England the allegiance of the Islands followed as a matter
of course, and have since remained English territory.
The population varies between fifty and sixty thousand, and
Jersey is a popular pleasure and health resort frequented by
both the French and English. The climate is temperate, a
rainfall of about 31 inches, free from snow and frosts. The
arable land comprises some 20,000 acres, and farmers are
mostly free-holders engaged in raising vegetables for the
London market and in the breeding of cattle.
The Island is divided into Parishes, and retains special privi-
leges of self-government from Great Britain and is really an
independent State, making its own laws by its own form of
representative legislature. Although small in area, in fact,
only the size of a few Australian farms combined, it has
achieved wonderful importance. If a country's greatness is
to be measured by its contribution to the progress of civilisa-
tion and the welfare of humanity, the Island of Jersey is
pre-eminent in as much as her supreme contribution to
human well-being is the Jersey cow, which most merits the
admiration and gratitude of mankind.
The Royal Jersey Agricultural and Horticultural Society was
established in 1833, and it is due to the management laid
down by this august body that the Jersey holds that pre-
eminent position in the dairy world of to-day.

Uterine Irrigation
• An easily prepared irrigation within the reach of all
cattle men is one prepared by the mixing of one heaped
tablespoonful of common table salt with one gallon of boiled
water and used at body temperature. A common fault almost
universally noticed is the use of boiled water cooled down
to required temperature by addition of cold water not treated.
The cold water used for cooling should be first boiled and
allowed to cool, bottled, corked and labelled, and held ready
at all times for emergency use. The necessary quantity can
then be obtained by boiling a small proportion of water
dissolving the salt therein more effectively, and adding the
cold water from the bottles to the required quantity and tem-
perature for use.
ENSURING A CLEAN HERD
Cows with uterine discharges of any kind whatsoever should
always be kept away from the rest of the herd until they
have recovered.
Navua Limited will gladly send prices and
descriptions o[ animals to prospective clients,
but we extend an open invitation to all who are
interested to inspect our Herd and Farm.

To Out Patrons
In compiling the brochure indicating the opera-
tions of Navua Limited in Jersey, breeding, we found
it necessary, in order to keep the same within reason-
able limits, to confine the pedigrees and illustrations
solely to animals imported from the Island of Jersey.
In addition, on the Farm we have a number of
imported-in-dam animals and a large herd bred from
our imported stock, which are available for sale at
most reasonable prices.
We are also establishing families from selected mat-
ings, with a view to augmenting and assisting clients
in any policy of line breeding determined. This
enables breeders to return to Navua for follow on
Sires or Dams to carry on their particular theories
and schemes of breeding. As an indication of our
policy to establish family lines, which was definitely
laid down at the commencement of our operations
in 1929, we have four generations of some of our
cows on the Farm, and three and two generations
from the later shipments. This is no mean achieve-
ment in so short a period, and will be fully appre-
ciated as a sound policy to discriminating buyers.
By confining our illustrations to only imported
animals we have been forced to leave out an out-
standing young Sire, "Navua Design Oxford" (imp.-
in-dam), whose breeding is so keenly sort after. We
have several young females due to freshen early
to this Sire. We are also prepared to breed animals
to matings selected by our clients, which further
assists them in any particular breeding they desire.

DREAMER’S HAMPTONNE STAR (Imp.).—Vol. 22.
Serviceability of the Bull
• The value of a bull is judged by his ability to beget
healthy offspring of quality, and the measure of this ability
is the number of progeny produced. In this respect no two
bulls are alike. Normal bulls present marked differences in
the number of cows that they may successfully impregnate
during the course of a given year or during their lifetime,
even when given equal opportunity. One animal may be
able to impregnate 15 cows a year, another 35, and an
exceptional bull may handle the service of as many as 100
cows during the course of a year. The bull's fertility reacts
inversely to the frequency of service after his maximum of
safety in service has been reached.
A young bull should not be placed in service until he is
between 12 and 14 months' old. For the first year he should
be used on cows or heifers whose genital health is most
assured, so that an early estimate of his fertility and the
desirability of his progeny may be obtained.
The following suggested table is a reasonable guide as to the
amount of service a bull should receive during his first year
of work, and it is best to use him rather less than more.
Frequency Total
of Use. Services.
For first two months .. 15 to 25 days 3
For next four months .. 10 to 20 days 10
For next six months .. 7to 25 days 18
The bunching of services should be avoided and also the
practice of turning a young bull out to pasture with a group
of cows or heifers and thus permitting of promiscuous service.

REFERENCE TO "FOUNDATION STOCK"
COWS
A “Foundiition” cow is simp
y one whose ancestry has been
unregistered in the Islnnd Hen
Rook but which is herself admitted
to registry nfter due inspection by the Qualification Committee. It
should not bo overlooked that such a cow wins her right to rogistru-
tion purely by vhtue of her individual excellence. Of course, the
purity of her Wood is unquestioned, bec.-inse no foreign blood inis
been admitted to the Island for several centuries.
Many of the most widely known families of Jersey fame started with Foundation cows. Origa, Eminence, Industry, Blonde, Pen-
nithorpe, Gamboge, Violette, Interest —tbe.se and many others have
proved their claim to fame through the outstanding merit of their
descendants.

Berkshire Pigs
FOR QUALITY AND EARLY MATURITY.
• We have specially featured the rearing and housing
of pedigreed-Berkshires and have at Navua some very
fine Boars and brood Sows. The three important points
have been studied closely since the foundation of the
Stud, namely, Breed Type, Quality and Fecundity. Now
by careful selection and mating a type of pig has been
evolved which- may reasonably be relied upon to do
egually well in the Show Ring and at home for breeding
purposes. The system of management affords every fac-
ility for the specialisation so essential in the case of
pedigree breeding. In our system of mating, pedigree
plays-its part, but we have always kept before us the
reguirements of the Commercial Pig Market. It is inter-
esting to note such famous animals as Carry On, Pyg-
malion, British Queen, Marina, President and Princess
Royal, who are all represented close up in the pedigrees
of our breeding stock. It is a pity more attention is not
paid to the improvement of our Commercial Pig Herds,
because it would not be very long before an ordinary
grade herd could be so improved as to be egually good,
if not better, than an ordinary pedigree herd, by the con-
tinued use of a pure bred Boar.
The Berkshire breed, as a whole, is the breed most
suited to our climate, as well as for the production of
pork or bacon, and it can more than hold its own as a
pig with the ideal carcase for the export bacon trade.
The modern improved Berkshire is a beautiful lengthy
pig with very even and deep sides, fine in the bone,
and is upright on its pasterns—in fact, it has a conforma-
tion that denotes early maturity and yet able to lay on
flesh guickly and evenly. For crossing purposes with
other breeds the Berkshire is outstanding.

OUR MODEL HYGIENIC FARROWING PENS.
TME PIGGERIES
• This section has received special attention in design
and equipment of the buildings. They are of concrete through-
out, and the layout permits of abundance of light and ventila-
tion at all times. The farrowing pens each have a fixed feed-
ing trough connected to the sewerage system, thus permitting
of cleaning after each feeding. The floors of the pens and
yards attached are graded to drains, which ensures the
animals at all times being kept under ideal conditions. Each
pen yard is fitted with a shower, and during hot weather
the animals make constant use of such. Exercise yards are
in conjunction with the farrowing pens for sows and litters,
and in addition a general run is available which affords
plenty of good grazing and exercise. We feed no offal to
our pigs, their ration comprising pollard, lucerne, root crops,
maize and milk. The Stud Boars and Brood Sows are kept
under natural conditions, having free run of area watered
with permanent creek and necessary shelter trees.
SALE AND DESPATCH
OE STUD PIGS
Purchase covers and includes the care
of pigs crated on rail or steamer. We
crate our pigs in hygienic crates con-
structed of new timber, and such are
not returnable for re-use.

Shetland Ponies
• A selection was made for Navua for a small Stud of these ponies
and the Stallion, Banjo, has been three times Champion at the
Melbourne Royal Show, and is the holder of many First Prizes.
The native home of the Shetland pony is on a group of rocky
islands about 200 miles north of Scotland, the principal one being
Main Land, on which is located Lerwick, the largest town and port.
For the most part these Isles are rough and barren, merely affording
pasturage of a few sheep and ponies. No trees or shrubs of any
significance grow on the islands, and the surface is merely a suc-
cession of hills of rock formation with peat and decaying vegetable
matter in the basins. The soil covering is very light, on which
heather and scanty grass grow, affording the only pasturage for the
ponies and sheep, and what is cultivated lies in the valleys. How
long these ponies have been bred on the islands is not a matter
of record, but it is definite that they have been bred there for
centuries, and it is for this reason, living under such hard conditions
and environment, that a small type of horse has naturally been
evolved. They are the smallest of all ponies, their type approximates
that of a small draught horse, although many are seen that are
slender of bone and fine of body, more after the trotting horse type.
In height the Shetland should not exceed 10 hands 2 inches for
choice specimens, and a mature animal will weigh from 325 to 3751b5.,
according to its height and condition.
The colour of the Shetland is quite variable—black, bay and brown
being most common, but they may be grey, roan and chestnut
with combinations of white. In fact, piebald and spotted ponies are
quite common. The coat is long and shaggy in winter, it being fit
protection against the inclemency of the weather it had to endure
without any shelter. In spring the heavy coat is shed, and in summer
the coat is short and sleek, while at all times a long heavy forelock,
mane and tail are characteristic. The head of the Shetland should
not be too fine, the eye should be prominent, the neck inclined to
be short and strong with some crest in stallions.
The chief reason for the popularity of the Shetland lies in its extreme
intelligence coupled with docility. These two things go to make it
the ideal pony for small children, and not only this, children and
Shetland ponies seem to have for each other a natural affinity.
Virtually the ponies are made pets of at Navua.

PONIES
In addition to our Registered
Stud of Shetland Ponies, we are
able to offer ponies suitable for
young people’s use, thoroughly
broken in and quiet by hand-
ling and bred from selected
mares ranging in height from
11 to 13 hands. These will be
available at the most reasonable
prices and should commend
themselves to anyone in search
of a reliable pony.

GOOD STOCK IS TEE EOUNDATION OE SUCCESS
Good tools do not make a good workman, but a skilled tradesman can be greatly handi-
capped by inferior equipment. In stock raising the same principle applies and if a man is
interested in dairying where the product is the measure of success achieved, it is most essential
to have the best that one can buy. It is recognised that cheap dairy cattle are seldom bargains
and it is necessary for success to have cows of good type and plenty of capacity. It is also
essential that great care be exercised in the purchase of bulls from recognised producing
families. Good cattle may cost more to purchase but no more to keep and the results are more
profitable.
Buy the best you can and breed them better.
