“ Do you like ours V father’s new book, Bay? ”
“ Aw, there’s not any picture of the Santa-cart
written in it! ”


Oh!
What a lot of lots of things
For little boys to like!


So Bay doesn’t stay in the stars any more


THE BAY AND PADIE BOOK
WHISPER!
When you’re coming in the door
Please come gently, very gently!
Micky might be on the floor!
Fact, he might be anywhere!
Near the hallstand, by the stair!
Hush! step gently, very gently!
When you’re coming in the door.

THE SHADOW SHOW
TRAINS with wheels and clouds of smoke,
Funny crowds of dodging folk,
Trams that run along with sparks,
Sofa games and pillow larks, Book
Grubs and ponies, worms and tigers,
Sparrows on the tree, A.
Oh!
What a lot of lots of things
For little boys to see! ‘v’?-'
■kk-
Aeroplanes and paper darts, ;
Woodmen driving broken carts, s'
Minahs on the chimney tops,
Swallows dodging near the shops,
Barking pups that make the postman
Fall down off his bike;
Oh!
What a lot of lots of things
For little boys to like!
Great big pictures in big books,
Pastry from the pastrycook’s,
Circuses and Mentone sand.
Musics of the soldier band,
Chocolates wrapped in silver paper
So they won’t get wet;
Oh!
What a lot of lots of things
For little boys to get!
Tip-toe, Tip-toe, hush the noise,
There’s a wide-eye-whisper tune;
Micky’s making songs for boys
Sleepy after the afternoon


THE SOLDIER BAND
MY mother and my father are both having tea
to drink;
Inside the pastry shop they saw me last.
They don’t know where I’ve got to, for I’ve
runned from where they think;
I heard the soldier band go marching past.
Padie
Book
Oh, tiddley—om—ti—pomp they go! Stamp
soldier, stamp!
A cab-horse jumped into the air and bumped
against a lamp.
Ta —rah—ra—rah, the trumpets go telling the
boys to come,
And always and all the time, bang goes the drum.
Look at their lovely leather legs! The big brass
things they blow!
I don’t care where I walk or who I meet,
I’m following the band away to where the musics
grow,
I’m hitting my hoots heavy on the street.
For I must find the music man that lets them play
so loud,
And find the funny place where soldiers go
To fill their trumpets with the noise they blow
among the crowd —
It’s not a tea and pastry shop I know.
WHISPER!
Anyone seen Micky here?
Him that lives above the ceiling.
Sometimes far and sometimes near,
Boys have heard his little squealing.


Oh, I must find the music place, and stamp along
the track,
And try to let no trams run over me;
If I’m a long, long way from home, the band will
play me back,
That’s if I’m good and never spill my tea.
When I grow up a soldier man, I’ll buy a pole to
wag,
With silver top and tassels red and blue;
I ’ll tell my little brother to be carrying the flag,
While I call out and tell him how to do.
I don’t know where my father is, I’ve left him in
a shop,
And if I’m lost there’s bound to be a noise;
If fathers want their children, they should make
the policeman stop
The music of the bands that steal the boys.
Oh, tiddley—om—ti—pomp they go! Stamp,
soldier, stamp!
A captain with a silver sword is marching them
to camp,
Ta —rah —ra —rah, the trumpets go, telling the
boys to come,
And always and all the time, bang goes the drum.

WHOM TEE GODS LOVE
HE’S so chubby and happy and wonderful,
Dainty and perfectly made,
That when he hides at the sunbeams there,
Out on the grass in his cradle chair,
Somehow I feel afraid.
We ought to hide him away, I think,
Real beauty was always a bane,
If the gods get to know of his baby wiles,
Of his firm round limbs, or his magic smiles,
They’ll want him back again.
WHISPER!
Hush, you! Hush! I think I hear
Just a little noise of humming!
If you see him waiting near
Please don’t whisper him we’re coming!

} But little Boyo Browneyes and Billy Wirehair ?
Little Imps of Gloryland with great hig eyes
Follow me with questionings and laughter and

Little cheeky pixie hoys whom nothing can
suppress,
Whose pandects, codes and institutes are hound
in mother’s “Yes.”
When Uncle comes in Sunday clothes they
clamour to he kissed,
Black-currants sticking to each face and pan-
cakes in each fist.
Four fists that is, all over jam, and four hlack

Just come from playing motor-chairs and sailing

For ivhat’s your talk of tidiness and putting The
things “right there”
To little Boyo Browneyes and Billy Wirehair?
I’m picking up the channel or I’m trucking up
the slope,
I’m hauling on the shear-head with a length of
yellow rope;
No matter where I’m wandering, in dreaming or
in fact,
Wool-loaded down the hlacksoil plains or past
the desert tract,
About the city clamorous with many brakes and
bells,
It takes no sweep of wizard wand nor moonlit
fairy spells
To bring me back to kitchen land, and whom do
I see there
But little Boyo Browneyes and Billy Wirehair!
PEEP SONG
OH, Friday night’s the laundry night,
Down the street in the dark —
And Saturday night’s the picture night,
When bands play in the park.
But Sunday morning is the time
We do the pillow-peep,
To see what things the fairies brought
While two boys were asleep.
SSI
WHISPER!
In the after afternoons
When there comes big starey moon*,
Often we’ve heard Micky playing
the window, fairy tunei
But I don’t know what he’s saying
In the after afternoons.


NATURE STUDY
But Sufi sprang from an unknown spot,
And the two boys wondered, afraid,
i I'j When he carried the mouse to a garden plot
And played, and played, and played.
THE SKY IN THE POOL
DOWN by the glassy pool
Sand and water meet,
There’s a little wooden stool,
Marks of little feet.
When the broth was in the howl,
Mother called to-day;
Mother called and no one came,
Someone was away.
Then there came a little hoy,
Whose hroth was very cool,
Stuttering in wonderment,
“The shy is in the pool!”
And mother tvept, because the clear
Depths of all pool-shies,
The soul’s wonder, the heart’s fear,
Were gathered in his eyes.

THERE ’S women and there’s men as well and:
little baby things, Padie
And some haves only dresses on and some of ’em
haves wings,
They nibble dandelions for meat, they drink the
bubble frorf,
They never spill their cocoa-milk all down the , 7, j
table-clorf, ¥
They never cry because it hurts, they always eat
their brorf.
Last night we heard a trumpet in the tea-tree
down the street,
And Padie left the table that was full of things
to eat,
He galloped for the music that seemed not so far
away,
And neely found the fairies where the trumpet
used to play!
Our mother went and eatched him and he neely
wasn’t found,
He neely fell into the creek through looking
round and round.
A naughty sea-shell cutted him, he had a bleedy
toe,
He lorst one Sunday sandal and he didn’t seem
to know;
He only stood and wondered why all fairies live
in moons,
And go home in the twilight with their trumpets ’
blowing tunes.

If he’s in the trellis tree;
It’s too damp for boys to go
Hunting in the grass below.
On the rafters in the night
I’ve heard little footmarks trot;
And I watch the candle light,
Wondering if it’s him or not.
Micky’s always everywhere;
Watches children while they sleeping;
’Round about the attic stair
Sometimes mother saw him peeping.
Micky doesn’t like much noise,
He’s a wide-eye whisper fairy;
Very kind to girls and boys,
Very shy and most contrary.

Lords have lashed and poets have pondered,
Blood has flowed in the runnels deep,
Beacons have broken and faiths been squan-
dered;
Through dank forests these songs have wandered F F
Quietly crooning our babes to sleep.
Grandmother melodies, grandmother fancies,
Crooned by the Oxus ever endure!
Epics of valour and throne romances
Have much honour and take big chances,
But the clowns tvho sang for the babes are sure.
The goblin speaks tvhile in old caves moulder
Priest-made destinies and lord-made law,
The goblin leered from the monarch's shoulder
And, his sight being true and his young heart
bolder,
’Twas only the goblin the baby saw!
So the god's death agonies are baby chatter!

The red earth rolls, for what can matter
If old John Spratt licks clean his platter
And the brown cows go to the broom?

THE ROAD OF NOW AND
THEN
TINKLE, tinkle go the bells,
King and prince and silver knight
March through stories grandma tells
When the winter fire’s alight.
Down the Road of Stories ride
People who have never died;
Fairies float and trumpets blow,
Pretty soldiers fence and bow,
On the Road from Long Ago,
Long Ago till Now.
Johnnie Fawkner sailed a boat,
There’s its picture in the book;
Roses, wreaths and banners float
’Round the head of Captain Cook.
In the time when knights were bold
Ladies rode with bells and chains,
Horses rugged in white and gold,
Feather-legged with plaited manes.
Singing, Watch Europa go,
Wearing thinner clothes than silk.
Riding from the cattle show
On her bull as white as milk.
Sturt he led a caravan,
Kelly made the bankers jump;
Leiehardt was a camel-man
Riding on a camel-hump.
Down the Road of Stories march
Gentle-folk and bullock-men,
Cracking whips and wearing starch
On the Road of Now and Then

SLEEP SONG
Half-past bunny-time,
’Possums by the moon;
Tea and bread-and-honey time,
Sleep-time soon.
Things that poets pant to see,
The beautiful, the true,
Are nothing to the phantasy
The closed eyes view.

There’s a widc-eye-whisper tu
Micky’s making songs for boys
Sleepy after the afternoon.


KITCHEN LULLABY
; OTEADY in the kitchen, steady in the hall,
p ” u Don’t let the dipper or the gruel pot fall!
The ole blind’s flapping
Book And the little dog’s snapping
tAt the butcher and the baker and the woodman
when they call.
Ssh! ssh! ssh! for the little hoy peeping,
Ssh! ssh! ssh! did the milky make him start ?
Little boy sleeping, sleeping, sleeping,
Little boy sleeping at his mother’s heart.
What a lot of noises, carts and buzzing flies!
Keep his little hands down, shut his little eyes;
For the boys are larking
And the dogs are barking
And he can’t go to bye-low though he tries and
tries.
Ssh! ssh! ssh! for the little boy blinking,
Blinking at the fairies who are wanting him to
go;
Little boy thinking, thinking, thinking,
Little boy thinking if he will or no.
Rubs his little eye for to push the sleep away;
Better on the lawn is it? Watching spriggies
play?
Minahs and starlings,
But no such darlings
As the little boy that’s never been to sleep this
Ssh! ssh! ssh! for the big eyes gleaming,
Dee, dee, softly his mother sings;
Little boy dreaming, dreaming, dreaming,
Fluttering to bye-low on bull-fly wings.
WHISPER!
Anyone seen Micky here?
Him that lives above the ceiling.
Sometimes far and sometimes near.
Boys have heard his little squealing.


BARTER
KIDDIES must have little shoes
Softly buckled round their toes,
Rompers wrought in butcher blues,
That’s the way the money goes.
In the Summer silky cool
Fabrics foaming in the breeze;
In the Winter muffling wool —
We must buy our kiddies these.
Woolly gaiters, tasselled hoods,
Mantles soft that flow and fall,
All the very best of foods,
All the very best of all.
Babies must have songs for sleep,
Anxious watchings night and day,
Kisses if they laugh or weep,
So the ripe hours rush away.
And for this we pay (it seems
We may not serve visions, too)
With our high neglected dreams,
With great things we meant to do.
FATHER SONG
THEY mean such a wonderful lot to me,
It’s quite absurd how my soul is smitten
With Padie, who’s four, and Bay, who’s three,
And Sufi, a Persian kitten!
So mother must worry, and father must fuss,
But I’ll fake these songs to a sadder version
When manhood steals the boys from us,
And the Bottle-o pinches the Persian!

SUNDAY DINNER
THE butcher corned and he bringed no meat,
But he crawled in the poultry pen,
And he putted his hand among they feet,
And catched the father hen.
He catched it as hard as anything,
But it didn’t once crowed at all,
And he tied its feet with a bundle of string
And hanged it up on the wall.
And now and again its wings went flap,
But that didn’t frighten me!
I runned for my little brother chap
To come outside and see.
The father hen’s not crowing now,
The ittooest ittoo bit;
We’re going to tell our father how
The butcher’s hurted it!
Our father has mended the bathroom door
And the leg of the rocking chair;
He mended the fence long time before,
And he bought my horse some hair.
He made the bikes so they wouldn’t squeal,
And he made the bunny to talk;
He hammered some tacks in the engine wheel
When the engine couldn’t walk.
And he cured the teddy when it was dead,
And he mended the barrow for me—
So father will mend the rooster’s head
Before he haves his tea.


THE CONCERT IN THE
HARDEN
THE wheelbarrow wept to the willows
And Padie called out for a hymn:
He dabbled his boots on the pillows
And the minister looked quite grim.
While the Emu turned the pages
The Wallaby sang with zest,
Of the error in uncle’s wages
While the chairs all turned to the West,
The Baker paused with a frigid stare
The
Bay
and
Padie
Book
And his heels apart, of course;
And the shell-back sprang from his sunny lair
With his hand upon his horse.
The rooster’s grandma nursed the cat,
Which uttered nor purr nor sound,
While the Platypus followed the Minister’s hat
Around and round and round.
WHISPER! ! !
SIT up in your beds and hark!
Something said “meow” in the dark!

Was it a mousie trapped under the stairs'?
Was it a manager stealing some shares

THE COMING OF BAY
T> AY doesn’t stay in the stars any more;
X 3 He didn’t mnch cry nor care
i ’ache When Hod pushed him out of a big star door
Into the everywhere.
I ringed him up on the telephome
And down he flied to me!
X'pidn’t you know how Bay came home?
I got the push-cart, see?
And wheeled him in the front-yard door
Just one way and another,
I didn’t make mud-marks on the floor,
Or scratch the paint on the front-way door,
’Cos I am a careful brother ;
I putted him into the new white cot,
I covered him up till he grew quite hot,
And then called mother to see;
So Bay doesn’t stay in the stars any more
But only with mother and me.
BABY SONG
THE grandmas talked with worried eyes
And said it was a shame —
Nobody wanted Littley then
Before our Littley came.
Boyo’s nose will be out of joint,
He's a toddling baby yet,
And now there’s another one coming along,
Poor little pet!
But Littley rode through the storm of doubt
And the cloud of the troubled brow;
Nobody wanted Littley then —
But you should hear them now!

Who upset the pot of musk?

Looking for their trains.

Always "ii the head;

Only cried an ittoo bit;
Anyone been fighting Bay,

On the picture of the train
Just when I was reading it.

Why is mother worried so ?
All these good things can’t be true.
Have the boys been good who show
Scratches red and bruises blue ?
I dunno, I dunno,

Two boys together,
Rolling on the lawn all day

Holding them and folding them
For two boys’ nest.
Boys washed and pillows patted,
Everything’s all right,
Picture books to cuddoo up,
And please leave the light.
Hey Dee and Hey Ho!
And little 80-Peep,
One story, two songs,
To make the boys asleep.
Say about Red Riding Hood
And what the Bunyip said,
Wynken song and Tom, Tom,
And piggy-back to bed.

On the rafters in the n
I’ve heard little footmarks trot;
And I watch the candle light.

TDLEASE can I have a light, mother! and
A I never know what to do
j- never Know wnat to ao Padie
When the Three Bears ride on the White Bell- ' , I
horse,
And the Mermaid gallops to Banbury Cross,
And the Cheshire Cat says “Moo!”
Gnomes come round with prickly wings
And squeeze in under the clo’s,
The dark gets full of story things, "; / ■ *
The window-moon says “Pee, fo, fum!”
And the Pigs that went to market come
And nibble at my toes!
Two big eyes walk round the room,
Pierce Pirate Ships go by;
And Sleeping Beauty straddles a broom
And falls all down the sky;
The Man in the Moon waits underneath
And gobbles her up with great big teeth,
And that’s what makes me cry!
The things you tell in the afternoon
Get mixed and won’t come right;
“Pee-fo-fum!” says the Window-Moon—
It’s the little candle they fear, mother,
Will you leave the candle here, mother
Please can I have a light!
MOTHERHOOD
IT would appear that no great pleasures can he
Without their merit of trial and urgency :
For I do know a lady whose rare joys
Wake when she has tucked in two little hoys.

Micky doesn’t like much noise.
He’s a wide-eyc-whisper fairy.
Very kind to girls and boys,
Very shy and most contrary.


WHISPER!
Tip-toe, tip-toe! Hush the noise!
There’s a wide-eye-whisper tune!
Micky's telling songs to boys,
Sleepy after the afternoon.
