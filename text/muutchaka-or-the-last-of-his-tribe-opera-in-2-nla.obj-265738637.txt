Nelly Goulbourne.
Alone in nature’s garden wandered
f I A maiden young, a maiden fair ;
p " Alone through perfumed beds she sauntered,
\J J * Some one to seek— he was not there.


Her brilliant eyes showed deep affection,
’Twas cruel fate for him to be
Away, and throw her in dejection,
When both of them could happy be.
She wandered on,
Hope still remained
Within her pure confiding heart.
A step —her heart at once regained
Its former strength, and ceased to smart.
’Tw r as he. How gently he did soothe her ;
Her head dropped low to words so sweet,
His happy smile, his soft caresses,
Enter Geo. —
Happy, happy, thus to be.
Nelly and Geo. —
No more in nature’s garden wanders
A maiden young, a maiden fair ;
No more through perfumed beds she saunters
Alone —for he who loves is here.
