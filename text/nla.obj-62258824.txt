"Vrow that the centre of Australia has at length been reached,
and the continent itself crossed from shore to shore, it
may not be without interest if we review the several la-
bours of our explorers in this field. We propose, therefore, to
trace the progress of Australian discovery from its first small
beginnings. We propose to follow the white man from his
small village on Port Jackson to his rich settlements along the
borders of the great Interior. We shall accompany the ad-
venturous pioneer into that great Interior itself. With the
materials which he has given us, we shall endeavour to draw
the chief outlines of the continent as it now stands disclosed to
us. Here we shall be able to place a flourishing colony, mapped,
surveyed, and portioned out into its several districts and town-
ships ; there the mere fragments of a river or mountain range;
often we shall be obliged to leave an absolute blank. Nor shall
we have to revert to any very distant period. It is not
quite fifty years since the inhabitants of one small village dis-
covered a rift in the mountain range which confined them
to the shores of Port Jackson. Thence we shall trace the
tide of settlement and the explorers who led it. We shall find
them again and again repulsed, but again and again re-
turning to the charge. We shall behold them now retreating
from their lines, and now breaking through to rich territories
which lie beyond. Now we shall abandon the search as worth-
less, and anon we shall be led through waving pastures and by
the banks of deep and clear waters. We shall turn aside from
the hot blast of the desert, and find the cool breezes of the
south sighing around us. For a moment, too, we shall behold
the curtain raised on the awful Interior, and then dropped for


years. For a moment we shall gaze on those vast ruins of
nature?lifeless among the tropics, blasted amid perpetual sun-
shine ; and then all is conjecture?how far do they extend?
What lies beyond them ? Where have they entombed the lost
expeditions which ventured into them? Through all these
changing scenes we shall find a great empire growing up. We
shall see it occupying new territories ; and we shall pass through
great territories which it is yet to occupy. Not indeed that
the explorer is far ahead of his fellow-colonists. Australian
occupation has kept close on the heels of Australian disco-
very. If we find the explorer much in advance of the settler,
we may be sure that the way is too difficult, or the infor-
mation too scanty for immediate pursuit. Since the Australian
colonist took to flock-keeping, there never was a time when he
did not want more land. He would have explored for himself,
but that the discovery of secure halting-places?sometimes few
and far between made absolutely necessary this division of
labour. The occupation of the Australian colonies has been
entirely peaceful, but it has never been continuous. From
time to time, settlers suddenly poured into new districts,
while all beyond seemed a desert. Then, while flocks and
herds were multiplying and demanding new pastures, again
commenced the task of the explorer. Thus, while the Austra-
lian colonist was obliged to leave the management of exploration
mainly in the hands of his Government, he watched the pro-
ceedings of the Government exploring expeditions pretty closely.
Not seldom, he was tending his flocks and rearing his home-
stead on the scene of some discovery before the Governor?s
despatch had reached England. Great and prosperous cities,
too, we leave on the route behind us. We pass through a
wilderness, and, in a few years, it is an independent colony,
constructing its roads and its railways, making its own laws,
and astonishing us by its wealth. On the future of these
colonies we have not now to speculate. However closely com-
merce and politics have pursued the Australian explorer, his
duties are clear and distinct; and at present we propose merely
to trace the progress of geographical discovery through the
great continent which it has recently added to the four quarters
of the globe.
Some fifty years ago, a thriving English town had grown up
on the shores of Port Jackson. The Governor?s house was of
stone. The judge and a few government officers had brick;
but the main portion of the inhabitants were content with
plastered logs and shingled roofs. Yet the people of Sydney
felt no small pride in their town. They would have liked a


little more land for their few sheep and cows. But the flocks
on which they relied roamed through far different pastures.
When the season came round, they sailed away down the great
Southern Ocean, and came back laden with black oil and
sperm. Their harbour was the finest in the world, sending
its arms in among their cottages and town gardens, and capable
of containing the whole British navy; their log huts were
bathed in everlasting sunshine, and business was good. From
the sparkling waters of the Bay to the Blue Mountains behind,
all was bustle and activity whalers from Europe and America
refitting, immigrants landing, new houses building, and vine-
yards and orange-groves creeping round the Bay. Such as it
was, it comprehended all the English in Australia. Through
those Blue Mountains no man could find a way to the boundless
regions which lay beyond. Howards were offered for the dis-
covery of a mere sheep-track. The more adventurous citizens
risked life and limb not always without fatal results?in
clambering up and down their craggy sides, and peeping into
their black fissures. At length, the long-sought pass was dis-
covered. In 1813, Mr. Evans, a Government surveyor, found
himself, after repeated attempts, on the other side of the Blue
Mountains, and, with care and great labour, retraced his steps
to Sydney. Immediately the pent-up flocks and herds of the
colonists poured themselves out over Bathurst Plains and the
western districts of New South Wales; and the people of
Sydney began to desert their town gardens for sheep-feeding
and wool-growing.
O O
But a new impediment arose. Land was to be had for the
taking of it, but there was scarcely any water. Buin hung
over the head of the flockowuer who was not within reach of a per-
manent stream. An unusually dry summer left him a beggar.
In vain he hurried his flocks to the nearest watering-place.
They strewed the way with their carcasses. All the permanent
streams were quickly occupied. New South Wales was not to
be a great w'ool-growing country after all, unless more rivers
could be discovered. To little purpose they had searched Europe
for the sheep most famous for their wools, if these priceless animals
were now to die of thirst. The Government surveyors were in-
structed to be always on the look-out for rivers. Bivers pro-
mised to be the death of the Government surveyors. Such rivers
no man ever heard of before. They all ran inland. They
stopped when least expected, leaving no visible channel or
watercourse. Sometimes they w r ere as salt as the waters of
the ocean ; at another period of the year they contained excel-
lent drinking water. Bow they formed merely a chain of ponds;


and now, in a perfectly dry season, they boiled over their banks,
filling whole valleys with crashing timber, and sweeping away
the apparently secure homesteads which had sprung up on their
shores. In 1818, Mr. Oxley, the Surveyor-General, on a river
exploration, was surprised to find the Lachlan and the Mac-
quarie, the most important rivers then known, ending in vast
reedy marshes. What did become of the rivers had already
been repeatedly discussed. The records of Cook, and the Dutch
and French maritime discoverers, had been searched; but they
contained no notice of any considerable stream finding its
way to the ocean?certainly none within thousands of miles
along the sea-coast from Sydney. Mr. Oxley?s discovery now
appeared to bring the discussion to an end. It was now laid
down, as beyond all doubt, that the interior was an immense sea,
into which all the rivers emptied themselves, either by ordinary
channels or by underground passages.
In 1828, Captain Sturt, an officer of the 39th Regiment,
then stationed at Sydney, set out, with the approval of the
Colonial Government, to explore Mr. Oxley?s inland sea. But,
on sailing down the Macquarie to the point marked on Mr.
Oxley?s chart, all trace of sea or lake had disappeared.
? The channel, which had promised so well, without any
? change in its breadth or depth, ceased altogether, and, while
e we were yet lost in astonishment at so abrupt a termi-
? nation, the boat grounded.? The reeds were still there, but
the whole country beyond, as far as his party could travel, con-
tained not a drop of water. Abandoning ail hope of taking up
the Macquarie again, Captain Sturt struck into a more northern
course, and came upon the Darling a -river far exceeding in
size the Lachlan or the Macquarie. From a sloping bank on
which his party stood, stretched, some forty feet below them, a
magnificent stream, seventy or eighty yards broad, ?evidently
? very deep, and literally covered with pelicans and other wild
? fowl.? Eagerly the men, parched under an almost tropical sun,
and after several days? toil, rushed down its green bank to taste
its waters. ? Nor shall I ever forget the cry of amazement that
? followed their doing so, or the looks of terror and disappoint-
? ment with which they called out to inform me that the
e was so salt as to be unfit to drink.? Further search was now
impossible, and a hasty retreat was made to Sydney.
It was not quite so certain now that there was an inland sea.
Many abandoned the theory altogether. Yet how was a district,
larger than Spain and Portugal put together, drained ? Every
settler could tell of the mighty floods which had swept away
his sheep, his cattle, his farmyards, and, not seldom, his farm-


servants and shepherds. Where did these mighty floods go to,
or how were they carried off? The freshwater streams had
been found to disappear altogether, after a short course inland.
The Darling, which was quite large enough for a main drain,
was salt. Yet whole seas went somewhere, for Mr. Oxley?s
sea had disappeared before Captain Sturt could overtake it.
Nothing was to be discovered by following the course of the
ordinary sluggish freshwater streams. Creeping through a vast
extent of level country, more like canals than rivers, they were
stopped by the first impediment that came in their way.
Captain Sturt, whose arguments we are repeating, could trace
their cessation to nothing stronger than a bank of more than
ordinarily stiff soil. To solve the mystery, it was necessary to
follow the course of some more impetuous stream. The Aus-
tralian Alps, lying to the south of the Settlement, supplied
such a stream. A thousand rills, fed by its snows, joined them-
selves into one impetuous torrent, and dashed down a steep and
rocky channel. No ordinary impediment was likely to stop the
Murrumbidgee, and Captain Sturt determined to trace its
stream whither it might lead. The settlers who had already
secured its green banks reported that it made directly for the
interior, and showed no signs of abated strength. They would
have followed its course themselves but that it exhibited unmis-
takeable symptoms of leaving behind it the rich fertility which
marked its early progress. In 1829, Captain Sturt started on a
journey with which may be said to commence the history of the
Australian colonies.
Striking the Murrumbidgee at Yass Plains, about 300 miles
from Sydney, he proceeded along its banks with a large and
well-equipped party. The stream continued to gain in breadth
and body of water, but all appearance of fertility was fast dis-
appearing from its course. In little more than a week after its
departure from Yass Plains, the expedition found itself in an
absolute desert. The drays, loaded with provisions and other
necessaries, had caused immense labour to the men from the
shifting sandy nature of the soil and the dense patches of
e scrub ? which grew down to the water?s edge; but now neither
horses nor men could bring them any further. Yet a streams�
impetuous in its course was not to be abandoned. A friend,
who still held fast to the theory of an inland sea, had prevailed
on the leader of the expedition to add the timbers of an
old w T haleboat, which had already seen service at the South
Pole, to his equipments on leaving Sydney. They were nailed
together, and a small raft, capable of carrying a few bags of
flour, was constructed from the fallen timber on the river?s


bank. Half a dozen picked men were retained. The re-
mainder, with the drays, were sent back to Sydney. And,
next morning, at break of day, this small boat?s crew dropped
down the stream, bound for that mysterious and unknown In-
terior, which, alike, the European and the savage of the coast
regarded with curiosity and awe.
The Murrumbidgee is composed of alternate deep and broad
reaches of water, and steep rapids. In these rapids, the stream,
contracted within a narrow channel, hurries through a dark and
gloomy gorge, deep down between frowning and precipitous
rocks, hid from the sun by dense overhanging woods. Successive
ages had almost choked up these sunless chasms with fallen trees,
whose branches, pointing up stream, threatened to rip up the
boat. On the seventh day of the voyage, from one of these
sunless rapids the boat unexpectedly shot out into a broad and
noble river, running at right angles to its tributary, the Mur-
rumbidgee. In a country singularly deficient and uncertain in
its means of communication by water, they had discovered a
river not unworthy to be classed with the great watercourses of
Europe, and doubtless owing its broad stream to the unfailing
snows of the Australian Alps. Wherever the Murray might
lead them, at least it solved a very important portion of their
inquiry. It was certainly the main artery of New South Wales.
?I directed,?says Captain Sturt, ? the Union Jack to be hoisted,
* and, giving way to our satisfaction, we all stood up in the
* boat, and gave three distinct cheers.?
More safely the whaleboat now dropped down the even tide
of the Murray, and on the thirty-third day of the voyage on its
stream, the banks retired on each side, and then were lost in
the distance. The explorers found themselves floating on the
bosom of an extensive lake, becoming slightly brackish as they
advanced, while over its waters was borne the distant thunder
of the great Southern Ocean. To this was given the name of
Lake Alexandrina, and Sturt?s observations showed him that he
had cut off the south-eastern corner of the continent. Indeed,
Lake Alexandrina is separated from the Southern Ocean merely
by a narrow bar of shifting sand. The shores of the lake were
clothed with green pastures, and the whole surrounding country
seemed excellently adapted for agriculture a want beginning
to be severely felt by the colonists of New South Wales, who
were already getting their wheat and potatoes from Van Lie-
men?s Land, and even from New Zealand. It is almost unne-
cessary to say that the Adelaide district has since become the
granary of Australia, producing the finest wheat in the world,


and supplying the early goldminers of New South Wales and
Victoria with the necessaries of life.
But time permitted only a hasty view of these new disco-
veries. Our explorers had a long and weary row, up stream,
before them. They were already on famine allowance, and even
famine allowance would last them only on condition that they
rowed up the stream in the same number of days in which they
had rowed down. This they accomplished after great exertion
and suffering, prolonging their journey into each night until
they had reached their former camping-ground. When re-
lieved from Sydney, they had divided their last morsel of food,
and, owing to privation and incessant toil at the oar, symptoms
of insanity had already appeared among the men.
Wheat-lands and fresh waters had been the two wants of
JNew South Wales. If they were not now brought to the
very door, they were, at all events, near enough to relieve
the colonists from serious apprehensions. Flocks and herds
had increased with extraordinary rapidity, and all the available
districts had already been taken possession of. Whether
flocks and herds could be driven to the shores of the Southern
Ocean was indeed questioned, for Captain Sturt reported
portions of the banks of the Murray to be little better than a
deseit. But a new class of men, known as e overlanders,? now
appeared. The loud stockwhip of the overlander, and not
seldom the sharp crack of his rifle, as some Murray tribe
attempted to steal his cattle, now resounded through these
dark woods. Many thousands of horned hoofs daily thun-
dered over its bank, or plunged into its tide to cut off some
tedious bend of the river. Down the Murray poured the
overflowing flocks and herds of New South Wales, and spread
themselves oyer the new pastures round Lake Alexandria. *
The fame of the new settlement reached Europe, and the
English and the German emigrant were soon sowing their
The overlanders are, nearly all, men in the prime of youth,
whose occupation it is to convey large herds of stock from market to
market, and from colony to colony. The overlanders are generally
descended from good families, have received a liberal education
(Etonians and Oxonians are to be found among them), and, even at
them first start in the colonies, were possessed of what is considered
an independence. Among them is to be found a degree of polish
and frankness rarely to be looked for in such a mode of life; and. in

wheat-fields and tending their vines on the shores of Spencer
Gulf. In a few years more, the district was erected into an
independent colony under the title of South Australia, and the
foundations laid of the present City of Adelaide.
That the rich pastures of the present Colony of Victoria should
all this time have escaped the notice of the colonists of New
South Wales, is indeed matter for surprise. So early as 1824,
two settlers, Messrs. Hume and Hovell, had crossed the Mur-
rumbidgee, and penetrated to the shores of Port Phillip.
Explorations undertaken by private settlers in search of new
pastures were then kept as secret as possible. In general, the
discoverer waited until he could get a sufficient flock to take
possession of them himself. But it was whispered that a rich
territory would yet be found to the south of the Murrumbidgee.
Still, the opinion of the Surveyor-General w r as entitled to
weight, and Mr. Oxley had assured his fellow-colonists that no
rich territory could possibly exist to the south of the Murrum-
bidgee. It was reserved for another surveyor-general to lead
the way to a colony, for its size and population certainly
the richest and most flourishing under the British Crown.
Major Mitchell had, succeeding Captain Sturt?s trip down the
Murray, conducted several expeditions to the northern and
western portions of the colony of New South Wales, for the
purpose of tracing the connexion between the river system of
the colony and this new stream. In 1836, he placed beyond
question the junction of the Murray and the Darling, a point
which had been in considerable dispute; and then, crossing
over to the left bank of the Murray, he struck into his
Australia Felix, or Colony of Victoria, as we now know it.
Nor did he proceed far before the great importance of the new
district became apparent. Lying between Sydney and Ade-
laide, and within the bend of the Murray, it possessed the
well-watered pastures and deep agricultural soil which the
people of Sydney were only too glad to seek at the moi'e
distant mouth of the Murray. On his return to Sydney,
the Colonial Government immediately made known the capa-
bilities of their new province, and settlers from New South
Wales, and from the neighbouring island of Van Diemen?s
land, poured, in a continued stream, into Port Phillip Bay, and
spread their sheep over its broad plains. The government
auctioneer came down from Sydney, and knocked down town-
building allotments at unheard-of prices such was the great
promise of the new territory?and, within twelve months after
the discovery of Sir Thomas Mitchell (who had received the

honour of knighthood on receipt of the news in England), its
new colonists were building the present City of Melbourne.
Thus were permanently occupied the three colonies of New
South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria a group which
fills the south-east angle of the continent. But we cannot
proceed to the vast solitudes which yet lie behind this group
without some notice of the great and long-continued services
of a gentleman with whose name the history of these colonies
must be ever associated. And we can here the more suitably
enter into some explanation of the services which Count
Strzelecki has rendered to the Australian colonists, inasmuch
as he brings us to the very garden of the colony whose discovery
and occupation we have just described. The Blue Mountains,
whose dark abysses and sunless streams had so long shut in the
settlers on Port Jackson, are but a portion of the immense
chain which stretches from north to south of the continent,
and which, from Cape York, the extreme northern point of
Australia, to Wilson?s Promontory, its extreme southern point,
are known as the Australian Alps, the Snowy Mountains, the
Warragong, the Liverpool Ranges, or, more generally, as the
Great Dividing Range which separates the eastern seaboard from
the interior. This immense chain, plunging into the Southern
Ocean at Wilson?s Promontory, and now and then rising to the
surface of Bass Strait, at length emerges permanently from the
ocean on Van Diemen?s Land, and forms the chief feature of
that island. Along this Great Dividing Range are displayed
the chief geological and mineralogical elements which constitute
the soils and subsoils of New South Wales and Van Diemen?s
Land ; while its several peaks, snow-clad summits, and immense
richly-clothed tablelands exercise considerable influence over the
climate, and over the drainage of the regions on either side of it.
Immediately succeeding the explorations of Sir Thomas Mitchell,
which we have just brought to a close. Count Strzelecki entered
on an examination of these ranges, which extended over several
years, and entailed an immense amount of labour and hardship.
The various summits of the chain within the two colonies of
New South Wales and Van Diemen?s Land were named by him;
their heights ascertained; their mountain streams traced; the
geology and mineralogy, the terrestrial magnetism, the climate,
the fossil and existing flora, the fossil and existing fauna, the
state and prospects of agriculture, the physical, moral, and
social condition of the aborigines investigated; and the w r hole
of this vast district brought within a geological map of
great scientific value. All which may be found in the Count?s

We have now to follow him into what we have not un-
fairly called the garden of Australia Felix. We have already
seen that the Great Dividing Range runs from north to south
of the East Coast, and buries itself in the Southern Ocean at
Wilson?s Promontory. Before, however, reaching 1 � on �
Promontory, it throws oft' a spur which traverses the wo e o
Australia Felix, or Victoria, from east to west, anc on ose
slopes the rich goldfields of Bendigo, Ballarat, Mount Alexander,
the Ovens, Omeo, Mclvor, and several others now cluster.
Coming down this spur from the Great Dividing Range, an on
the slope of it opposite to that traversed by Sir Thomas Mitchell,
Count Strzelecki found himself within a beautiful district, whose
existence had not been even suspected. Enclosed between the
sea and the snow-clad summits of this Alpine barrier, sie eie
by it from the hot blast of the interior, and watered by
numerous unfailing streams fed from its snows, a large (is nc T,
not many degrees from the tropics, possesses an almost iLngiisn
climate. Later tourists from Melbourne and Sydney are loud
in their praises of the Arcadian beauty of Gipps Lan . s
lowlands are interspersed with some splendid lakes, w ie i s
rivers, navigable for sixty and eighty miles from t eir junc ion
with the lakes, are the finest and most valuable within the
Australian colonies. Flowers in endless variety, anc o
beauty, form a widespread carpet. The tall fern-trees, wi
their gigantic leaves, droop into natural bell-shape ten s.
* We cannot refrain from quoting the words of Sir George Gipps,
with which he introduces the discoveries of Count Strze ec u wi im
what was then the district of Port Philip. ?I cannot do so he
writes, ? without making your lordship aware ol tic ee m 0
? respect and esteem which have been incited towards iimamoiij,
? the people of this colony.? Similar tributes were also paid by the
colonists of Van Diemen?s Land, among whom we recognise the
name of his brother in geographical discovery, Sir John hrankim,
who was then Governor of the island. It is with surprise we no
that, up to the present, these tributes have been merely honorary,
both on the part of the colonies and the Home Government. 11c
researches of Count Strzelecki were conducted entue y a 1
expense (thus differing entirely from all the explorations which come
within the limits of our subject), and on them was expended by him-
self a very considerable sum. On the part of the Austra lan c >
this is, we believe, a singular exception. We cannot ca o
any other Australian explorer with whom the colonis s
promptly shared the golden tide which has inundated them.

1 , provisions running short, and suffering from the fatigues
� t ieir previous labours, the Count and his men attempted to
reach Melbourne by a short cut across the ranges. The skirts
o t icse i anges are clothed with a dense and almost Impenetrable
scrub. They had to abandon their pack-horses and all the
botanical and, geological specimens collected on the way.
Hor twenty-two days they literally cut their way through the
scrub, seldom advancing more than two miles a day, and beino-
in a state of complete starvation. Their clothes were torn
piecemeal away, and their flesh, lacerated by the sharp lancet-
hke brambles of the scrub, was exposed to the keen air of
these snow-crowned ranges. With difficulty Count Strzelecki
and his men reached Melbourne, but the horses, with all
his valuable collections, were never recovered. In his
report of this expedition to Sir George Gipps, then Governor
ot -New South Wales, we have the first official notice of the

discovery of gold. It stands thus among an enumeration of
the mineralogical specimens collected in the district, in the

Strange as it may appear, these solitudes have scarcely
been interrupted since they echoed to the footsteps of Count
Strzelecki and his men. Its exploration has been carried no
further: some of its finest rivers have not yet been traced. The
colonial land system threw it, at an early period, into the possession
ot some half-dozen fiockowners; and the tide of settlement, turned
from the very shore of Port Phillip Bay, spread to the north and
west of Already, however, there are evidences of a
change in this injurious system of land policy. Town and country
allotments are now being sold within the Gipps* Land district; and
Captain Cadell, who has successfully opened up the Murray, the
Darling and the Murrumbidgee to steam navigation, has proposed
ole Co omal Government to introduce steam vessels also on the
fnpps Land lakes and rivers. Should these exertions be followed
up, we may shortly expect to see Gipps?Land taking its proper place
at the head of the agricultural districts of Victoria.

yielding a very small quantity or proportion of gold, sufficient to
attest its presence.?
Thus was lying for twelve years, entombed among the Par-
liamentary papers, that important discovery which was to effect
such changes in the Australian colonies, until at length, in 1851,
another Governor of New South Wales, taught by the pros-
perity of California, consented to make more publicly known
Mr. Hargreave?s fresh discoveries of gold. But to Count
Strzelecki the first discovery on the spot was unquestionably
due in 1839 ; which was corroborated by Sir Roderick Mur-
chison?s scientific precognition in 1845 and 1848.*
But the great continent still lies before us. Captain Sturt
has brought us from Sydney westward to Adelaide, and at
Adelaide we arrive at the extreme limits of eastern settlement
almost of Australian settlement, for the Swan River Colony,
at the opposite, or western, corner of the continent, scarcely
effected more than a landing, and, until these last few years,
with difficulty maintained even that position. From Adelaide
we shall have chiefly to follow the further progress of dis-
covery ; but as the Swan River Settlement influenced in some
degree the dii?ection which exploration took, we shall, while the
people of Adelaide are planting their wheatfields and building
their city, take a glance at the coast on which the Swan
River settlers had landed. With the early history of this
settlement we have little to do. Soon after Sturt?s trip down
the Murray, several English capitalists brought out a number
of hired labourers to found a colony on the banks of the Swan
River. All the elements of wealth were in abundance. The
capitalists, in addition to labour, brought with them supplies of
everything necessary for the farmer and the- flockowner, and the
land was most excellent. The Home Government, however,
made one fatal error. It was too bountiful with its lands. To
Mr. Peel were given 500,000 acres; to the Governor of the
new settlement 100,000; similar grants were made to the other
capitalists. Each had so much land he did not know what to
do with it. For a trifle he parted with large portions of it.
The imported labourers found they could be landowners instead
of farm-servants. They all left their employers, and lived on
their estates, doing nothing. The very seeds were not put

published in 1856.


in the ground. The cattle Avere neglected, and died. The
employer of 300 servants found himself without one. He had
to make his own bed, cook his own meals, and behold his pro-
perty going to ruin around him. The imported labourers fared
no better. When autumn came round, they had no harvest to
reap. They came back to their masters, and insisted on the
terms of their contract. Failing to obtain what they had
eaten and destroyed, they insisted on hanging them. With
difficulty the Governor and the capitalists escaped with their
lives. A feAv ships took away most of the hired labourers to
the colonies of New South Wales and Yan Diemen?s Land,
Avhere they found themselves much more comfortable as highly
paid farm-servants than as starving landowners.
There still remained, in Perth and at King George?s Sound,
around Cape LeeuAvin, the nucleus of a settlement destined to ex-
pand into the Colony of Western Australia, though without any
material increase of population. Of the immense North-West
Coast, stretching thence to the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria,
and, as a ship sails, some 3000 miles long, nothing was known, nor
were the settlers around Swan River inclined to push occupation
tQAvards the north. The successes of Captain Sturt and Sir
Thomas Mitchell in opening new lands had noAV attracted
the attention of England towards Australia. The importance
of connecting the North-West Coast of Australia by means of a
settlement, nearer and under happier fortunes than the Swan
River Settlement, was urged upon the Home Government. It
was replied that no settlers would go to a coast of which
nothing whatever, save the misfortunes of the SAvan River
settlers, was known. Sir George Grey, the present Governor
of New Zealand, was then a captain of the 83rd Regiment
in London. Seized Avith a spirit of adventure, he proposed to
the Government to go and explore the North-West Coast of
Australia. H.M.S. ?Beagle? Avas then lying at Plymouth,
preparing for a marine survey of the Australasian seas and
gulfs, Avhich was to extend over some years. Captain Grey?s
proposal Avas accepted, and a passage was offered for him-
self and his exploring party in the ?Beagle.? To him we
chiefly owe the little Ave knoAV of this coast. It is much
to be regretted that his researches were interrupted by continued
mishaps. But for these mishaps we should now possess a more
complete knowledge of this portion of Australia a portion
apparently abounding in all that can conduce to successful
colonisation, and the nearest of the whole continent to our Indian
Empire, to China, and to the rich islands of the Indian Archi-


pelago. Of Sir George Grey?s progress along this coast we
shall now offer a rapid sketch.
Captain Grey was to land in Hanover Bay, towards the north
of the continent, and to explore the coast down towards the
Swan River Settlement. His expedition accordingly reached
Hanover Bay in 1838, and immediately found themselves in a
most delightful tropical country. Everywhere?by the sparkling
cascade of the Prince Regent?s River, along the picturesque
banks of the Glenelg, through deep alluvial meadows watered
by countless rivulets Captain Grey pauses to admire the
beauty of the scenery:
? Those of the party,? he writes, * who were not very tall, travelled,
as they themselves expressed it, between two high green walls, over
which they could not see; and those green walls were composed of
rich green grass, which the ponies ate with avidity. On a subsequent
occasion, when we re-visited this valley, we had io call to one an-
other, in order to ascertain our relative positions, when only a few
yards apart. And yet the vegetation was neither rank nor coarse,
but as fine grass as I have ever seen.?
From Hanover Bay the expedition proceeded for seventy
miles inland along the banks of the Glenelg, a river discovered
in the vicinity, the country still preserving its favourable
appearance.
Here, however, all further progress was abandoned. Soon
after landing, Captain Grey, with two of his men on an excur-
sion in the neighbourhood of the bay, came upon some natives.
One of the men, betraying his terror at their unusual appear-
ance, and seeking safety in flight, encouraged some of them to
cast their spears, from which Captain Grey received a severe
and dangerous wound. Fatigue and want of proper remedies
had now brought on more threatening symptoms, and with the
advice of his companions, he abandoned further advance. On
his return to Hanover Bay he was received on board the
? Beagle,? luckily then off the coast, and sailed thence to the
Mauritius in order to recruit his health.
In the following year he again started with an exploring
party consisting of thirteen men. By the advice of the
settlers at Swan River, where he put in before proceeding to
the north of the coast, he departed from his original intention
of exploring downwards from Hanover Bay to Swan River,
and determined to land at Shark Bay, about 600 miles to the
north of Swan River, and to explore the coast district thence
upwards to Hanover Bay. At Shark Bay, however, a violent
tempest put an end to further exploration at its very starting
point. The sea rose, and washed away the Avhole depot of


stores. Two leaky whaleboats, and a little flour and salt-pro-
visions, were alone left, and with these Captain Grey and his
men made a hasty retreat for Perth. About half-way from
Perth, the two boats were so shattered by the surf as to be
found useless, and the retreating party took to the land. Here
they would have all miserably perished, but for the superior
strength and endurance of the commander. They lay down,
and declared themselves unable to proceed any further. Leav-
ing them on the sea-shore, at a native well, Captain Grey
pushed on for Perth, and reached the out-settlements. Horse-
men were immediately despatched with food, and arrived in
time for the relief of all the party, save one.
From King George?s Sound, Captain Grey took ship to
Adelaide, to meet the regular Australian passenger vessels, on
his return to England. And to him the people of Adelaide
now eagerly applied for information of the North-West Coast.
Indeed, nothing could be more indistinct than the know-
ledge which the settlers around Adelaide possessed of the
immense wilderness lying to the north and west of them. The
very coast-line of the whole continent was most uncertain.
Since the days of Captain Cook, scarcely a white foot had
crossed it; and the Dutch previously had contented them-
selves by naming a few of its most conspicuous headlands.
Owing to his mishaps and forced marches. Captain Grey
could give them little information of the North-West Coast.
Hanover Bay, diametrically opposite to them, at the other
extremity of the continent, was of little avail for immediate
occupation, but King George?s Sound, at the extremity of their
own coast, the South Coast, contained fine pasture lands, and but
few settlers to make use of them. But of their own coast the
settlers of Adelaide knew probably less than of the other tAvo, the
East Coast and the North-West Coast. Mr. Bass had, indeed,
several years before, drifted through the strait Avhich now
bears his name in an open whaleboat, and made the discovery
that Yan Diemen?s Land Avas an island. Captain Flinders, his
companion in the Avhaleboat, had, at a later period, folloAved up
this discovery by coasting along the whole of the south main-
land and sketching its singular shore from the deck of his ship;
but the impetuous current which, coming up from the South
Pole, SAveeps through the Great Australian Bight, and an unin-
terrupted Avail of precipitous cliffs, some 500 or 600 feet high,
into Avhich this current was eating, deterred him from endanger-
ing his vessel by a too near approach. Such Avas the scanty
information Avhich the people of Adelaide had hoav to guide
them in seeking an extension of settlement towards the west.


It might, indeed, at first sight, be supposed that the unex-
pected acquisition of such important territories as Australia
Felix and South Australia would, for some considerable time,
satisfy the eastern colonists. But the old craving for land had
soon grown as strong as ever. In truth, it had scarcely abated.
Australia Felix was surrounded by New South Wales, by
South Australia, and by the sea. Its 4 tenants of the Crown,?
as they chose to be called or 4 squatters,? as they soon came to
be called?were permitted to take up 4 runs,? or sheep and cattle
stations, as large as English counties. In a wonderfully short
time, Australia Felix was occupied from the Murray to the sea.
South Australia was little more than a geographical expression.
Its parliamentary boundaries, on the north and west, exist only
on paper. To the present day, none but the foot of the ex-
plorer has ever crossed their meridians. The land in the neigh-
bourhood of Adelaide was such as Captain Sturt had described
it?rich in pastures, and needing but the care of the husband-
man to give forth its corn and wine; but the traveller to the
north of Adelaide soon found himself in a wilderness. The
early settlers on Port Jackson never sought more eagerly to
escape beyond the Blue Mountains than did the inhabitants
of the Adelaide district now seek to know what lay beyond the
desert which encompassed them. Within a few short years, the
city of Adelaide had grown with amazing rapidity; the whole
of the surrounding district was already overflowing with flocks
and herds; but the settler who endeavoured to push to the
north or west could nowhere discover either water or grass.
The efforts of its new government were unremitting; settlers
were most ready to contribute to the expenses of exploring ex-
peditions; and various were the plans discussed. Already
Adelaide had its Press, its lecture hall, and reading rooms. A
file of Adelaide newspapers for 1839, the year in which Captain
Grey called at Adelaide, will be found very much occupied by
letters on exploration, * papers ? read, and reports of discussions
on the subject. The distance to King George?s Sound was
certainly immense, the coast line anything but inviting; but
might it not be worth while to ascertain, by practical experi-
ment, the possibility of driving sheep overland thither ? Would
not such an experiment most certainly lead to the discovery of
good intermediate districts ? Then, to the north of Adelaide,
there was that mysterious Lake Torrens. Might not a better
country commence with its northern shores, if they could be
reached ?
In 1840, these discussions were brought to a practical issue.
After much debate, the attempt to form a junction with the
YOL. CXVI. NO. CCXXXY. C


western settlement was abandoned; and an expedition, called
the Northern Exploring Expedition, was formed by the united
assistance of the Government and the colonists. Mr. Eyre, the
late Governor of St. Vincent, was then a settler in the colony
of South Australia. He had already gained considerable expe-
rience as an explorer, both in New South Wales and in its new
dependency, the Port Phillip district, as Sir Thomas Mitchell?s
Australia Felix soon came to be called. More recently he
had made some incursions into the country to the north of
Adelaide, and, on the opposite shore of Spencer Gulf, in the
Port Lincoln district; and to him was entrusted the command
of the expedition. He was to ascertain the extent and nature
of Lake Torrens. A range of hills, called Flinder?s Range,
ran from Adelaide northwards ; they might lead to a change of
country, or feed some inland stream. And, if possible, he was
to penetrate to the centre of the continent.
The centre of the continent this expedition was fated never
to reach; nor even to cross to the opposite shores of Lake Torrens.
Its steps we shall have to follow in a widely different direction.
Of Lake Torrens, however, we may say that its southern shores
were now found desolate and dreary in the extreme. The lake
itself was about twenty miles broad, covered with a thick coat-
ing of salt, which had all the appearance of freshly fallen snow.
Under this salt was found a bed of soft mud, becoming so deep
towards mid-channel as to frustrate all their efforts to cross the
lake. On maps of Australia, Lake Torrens figures very much
in the shape of a horseshoe. The appearances observed by
Mr. Eyre on the present occasion at four different points on its
western arm, together with some researches of Captain Sturt,
on its supposed eastern arm, on an exploring expedition to
which we shall presently come, are the principal grounds for
this view of the Torrens basin. More recently, however, it has
been ascertained that what was known as Lake Torrens is not
one, but several lakes ?in fact, a semicircular chain of lakes,
or mud ponds; and that, more curiously still, a portion of its
western arm is the terminus of a river, which takes its rise on
the East Coast of the continent, some 1,500 miles distant. At
present, however, we have to follow the strange adventures of
Mr. Eyre.
Abandoning Lake Torrens, he threw himself entirely upon
Flinder?s Range, hoping that the slopes of its hills would furnish
sufficient water to his party in their progress northward. But
hill after hill grew smaller and less frequent, and gradually the
country settled down into a desolate level. One peak still rose
from the plain, and from this, named by him Mount Hopeless,


he determined to take a last observation. Without water or
food for the horses, and through a low sandy country, his party
bore down on Mount Hopeless, and ascended to its summit.
?And cheerless and hopeless, indeed,? he writes, ?was the prospect
? before us.? As he had feared, all trace of Flinder?s Range now
ceased, and before him lay a wide desolate level, interrupted
only by the ridge forming the shore of the still more gloomy
lake. This ridge of the lake, which, at each point of previous
observation, had been bending round from west to east, now ap-
peared on his right hand. Supposing, therefore, that his only
means of escape from this apparently uninterrupted semicir-
cular basin was by descending to either of its southern ex-
tremities, he returned to the head of Spencer Gulf, where a
narrow isthmus separates the waters of the gulf from Lake
Torrens, and crossed into the Port Lincoln district, intending to
resume his northern course when sufficiently clear of the lake.
Repeated attempts, howevei', proved the impracticability of
forcing a passage northward from this portion of the coast.
At every point, when advancing a few miles inland, impene-
trable scrub, and a total absence of water and food for the
cattle, drove the expedition back. Nor did it appear an easier
task to advance along the coast itself. Leaving the main
portion of his men at Fowler?s Bay, Mr. Eyre made three
several attempts to reach the Great Bight, hoping that, after
passing that portion of the coast, the country would be found
to open up more favourably inland. But, after encountering
great hardships and the loss of several of his horses, he rounded
the Great Bight only to behold the same impenetrable country.
The objects proposed for the Northern Exploring Expedition
seemed, therefore, impossible of attainment; and Mr. Eyre, on
his return to Fowler?s Bay, sent the men composing it back to
Adelaide. Mr. Eyre himself we have now to follow through
a feat the most wonderful in the whole annals of exploration.
We have already mentioned that the rich pastures of King
George?s. Sound and Swan River had been the subject of dis-
cussion in Adelaide. They lay at the extremity of the South
Coast, but was it likely that they were confined to the ex-
tremity of the South Coast? Was it likely that a coast district,
1,500 miles long, was absolutely barren ? An explorer would
be certain to meet good intermediate districts, and good interme-
diate districts would bring the whole of the North-West Coast
within reach of the Adelaide flockowner. The northern route
had been adopted at Mr. Eyre?s own request, enforced by his
own experience in the Port Lincoln district. His present ex-
cursions to the head of the Great Bight proved the difficulties


of a western route along the coast to be for greater than he
had urged upon the Exploration Committee in Adelaide ; but
Mr. Eyre now determined to take up the western route, and to
force a passage to King George?s Sound.
The South Coast, from Fowler?s Bay to King George?s Sound,
lay as Captain Flinders had sketched it from his ship. Indeed,
down to the present time, Mr. Eyre himself is the solitary
white man who has trod its desolate wilds. From the summit
of the cliffs, which had frowned down on the topmasts of H.M.S.
* Investigator,? stretched inland a table-land without rise or fall,
until a dense and impenetrable skirting of scrub hid it from
sight. This table-land Mr. Eyre had now ascertained to be an
unbroken sheet of limestone. At the bottom of the cliffs the
action of the current had hollowed out immense caverns; and,
occasionally, huge portions of the rock became detached and
tumbled into the ocean, showing by the rapidity with they were
engulfed the hopelessness of finding any path by the margin
of the sea. Inland, the country seemed equally unpromising,
and the only portion capable of sustaining animal existence was
a narrow strip extending along the edge of the table-land, over-
looking the sea. Here the action of the wind had collected
some scattered heaps of sand, on which grew a few tufts of sour
grass and salsolaceous herbs. But already from Fowler?s Bay
to the head of the Great Bight, neither lake, pond, nor stream
had been discovered ; and we may now say that from Fowler?s
Bay to King George?s Sound, a distance'of upwards of 1,500
miles, no vestige of a watercourse, nor any surface-lake, or
pond was met. During the day, a strong wind blows from the
interior, sometimes scorching in its heat, and loaded wuth fine
sand. Towards evening, this is met by a chilling breeze,
coming up from the great Southern Ocean; and doubtless to
the action of those two winds is to be attributed the deposition
of sand on the limestone surface along the edge of this exposed
table-land. Occasionally, at intervals of 150 and 200 miles, the
sand had been formed into a cluster of hills, and on digging
down to the limestone, at these places, a little brackish water
was found to ooze out between the sand and the rock. Strange
as it may seem, this was the only water at all approaching fresh,
which could be discovered along the whole course of this terrible
journey.
In undertaking this most forbidding task, Mr. Eyre had
determined to risk the life of no European save himself. The
men composing the North Exploring Expedition had, therefore,
been sent back to Adelaide. But the overseer of the party, a
servant long in the employment of Mr. Eyre, and a man of


great energy and courage, refused to leave his master, and Mr.
Eyre at length consented to accept his assistance. In addition,
lie retained two aboriginal young men, who had been some time
in his service on his farm, and a third aboriginal, named Wylie,
a native of King George?s Sound, who had lately arrived in
Adelaide in a vessel which had touched there. With these, Mr.
Eyre commenced making some necessary preparations,' and
giving his horses rest before finally leaving Fowler?s Bay. He
had informed the Governor, by letter, of the resolution which
he had formed, but, in addition, the officers and men of the
disbanded expedition made known, on their return to Adelaide,
the great difficulties which Mr. Eyre had already experienced in
his several efforts to round the Great Bight, and the singularly
unpromising nature of the country beyond its head. From
these it appeared that Mr. Eyre was advancing on certain des-
truction, and a Government sloop was immediately despatched
to Fowler?s Bay with a strong recommendation from the
Governor to return, accompanied by an official approval of his
conduct as leader of the late Northern Exploring Expedition.
But Mr. Eyre?s resolution was not to be changed, and the sloop
returned to Adelaide without him. ?We were now alone,? he
writes, ? myself, my overseer, and the three native boys, with a
? fearful task before us. The bridge was broken down behind
* us, and we must succeed in reaching King George's Sound, or
? perish. No middle course remained.? Having constructed bags
to hold water, and having given the cattle sufficient rest, Mr.
Eyre commenced his journey. His stock of provisions then
consisted of some sheep remaining over from the disbanded
expedition, and a few bags of flour. The head of the Great
Bight was again rounded, and the same forbidding nature of
country was found to extend along its western arm the only
vegetation being a few scattered tufts of grass, and the only
water being procured from beneath the sandhills, occurring at
intervals of 100 and 200 miles.
That man or beast should travel through a succession of
such intervals, extending over upwards of 1,500 miles, is indeed
wonderful, and, we believe, wholly without parallel. Some-
times a group of sandhills occurred at the end of one or two
days? march; more frequently, scarcely a blade of grass, and not a
drop of water, was met for a whole week, and human endurance,
taxed beyond what it might be believed possible for human endu-
rance to sustain, was no longer supported by the hope that another
group was yet in advance, or that retreat was possible. Mr.
Eyre?s progress during one of those long intervals between
water and water, may be thus sketched. After a halt of three


or four days at one of these groups of sandhills to recruit,
the horses were again loaded for a fresh start, the bags were
filled with water, and the sheep were led out of their pen. For
two or three days the horses were able to carry the few bags of
flour, water, and other necessary baggage. On the fourth day
their strength began.to fail, and it became necessary to lighten
their loads the rejected articles being left on the wayside.
On the fifth and sixth days the horses became totally exhausted,
and no exertions could force them to proceed further. Leaving
them also stretched on the wayside, Mr. Eyre and his men, with
the empty water-bags, hurried forward until the next group of
sandhills appeared above the horizon. Arriving at these, they
immediately proceeded to scoop out a well, considerable labour
and delay being occasioned by the repeated falling-in of the
sand. Leaching the surface of the limestone they quenched
their thirst, and took a few hours? rest while the water-bags
were filling. The whole party then shouldered their bags, and
proceeded back to the horses; and these they generally suc-
ceeded in bringing on by easy stages to the sandhills; though
occasionally they found one of the wretched and worn-out
animals in its last struggles. Having brought everything living
to the water, the most laborious task yet remained. Their pro-
visions and few indispensable articles were still strewed along
their track; and, while the horses were taking some rest, it
was necessary to go back and collect them, Mr. Eyre and his
men carrying them on their backs a distance of sometimes forty
or fifty miles. In addition to these immense labours, a further
task devolved on Mr. Eyre and the overseer. The horses,
though found unable to endure the same privation as the men,
were, nevertheless, essential to the preservation of the party.
Notwithstanding their fatigue, the want of water made them
restless during the night, and, when not closely watched, they
seized every opportunity to return to the last watering-place
the scattered position of the few tufts of herbage rendering it im-
possible to tether them. Nor could so important a task be safely
entrusted to the two aborigines. Mr. Eyre and the overseer,
therefore, agreed to divide each night between them, so as by
strict watch, to ensure the possession of the horses in the
morning.
In this manner Mr. Eyre and his small party had toiled on
for a couple of months, and had now accomplished more than
half their journey, when an appalling act of treachery plunged
him in fresh difficulties, and seemed to render his ultimate escape
hopeless. In the midst of one of these long stages between water
and water, they had encamped for the night, and Mr. Eyre had


taken the first watch over the horses. It was approaching
toward midnight, when Mr. Eyre?s watch would expire and he
would be relieved by the overseer. The horses in their restless-
ness had led him some distance from the camp, when the report
of a gun interrupted the sighing of the breeze over these
desolate wilds. Startled by so unusual an occurrence, Mr. Eyre
immediately hastened back to the camp.
4 1 met the King George?s Sound native, Wylie, running towards
me, and in great alarm, crying, ? Oh, Massa, oh Massa! come here
but could gain no information from him, as to what had occurred.
Upon reaching the encampment, which I did in about five minutes
after the shot was fired, I was horror-struck to find my poor overseer
weltering in his blood, and in the last agonies of death. Glancing
hastily around the camp, I found it deserted by the two younger
native boys; whilst the scattered fragments of our baggage, which I
left carefully piled up under the oilskin, lay thrown about in wild
disorder, and at once revealed the cause of the harrowing scene before
me. Upon raising the body of my faithful, but ill-fated follower, I
found that he was beyond all human aid. He had been shot through
the left breast with a ball. The last convulsions of death were upon
him, and he expired almost immediately after our arrival.
? The frightful, the appalling truth now burst upon me, that I was
alone in the desert. He who had faithfully served me for many
years, who had followed my fortunes in adversity and in prosperity,
who had accompanied me in all my wanderings, and whose attach-
ment to me had been his sole inducement to remain with me in this
last and, to him, alas! fatal journey, was now no more. For an
instant, I was almost tempted to wish that it had been my own fate,
instead of his. The horrors of my situation glared upon me with
such startling reality as, for an instant, almost to paralyse the mind.
At the dead hour of night, in the wildest and most inhospitable
wastes of Australia, with a fierce wind raging in unison with the
scene of violence before me, I was left with a single native, whose
fidelity I could not rely upon, and who, for ought I knew, might be
in league with the other two, who, perhaps, were even now lurking
about, with a view of taking away my own life, as they had done
that of the overseer. Three days had passed away since we left the
last water, and it was very doubtful when we might find any more.
Six hundred miles of country had to be traversed before I could hope
to obtain the slightest aid or assistance of any kind, whilst I knew
not that a single drop of water or an ounce of flour had been left by
these murderers from a stock that had previously been so small.?
Their small store of flour had indeed been the incentive to
this horrible deed. The two natives had taken with them all
the flour and water they could carry, and the double-barrelled
guns of Mr. Eyre and the overseer, leaving behind them only a
brace of pistols and a rifle which had a ball fast in the breech,
and was useless for the time. The encampment showed that


they had laid their plan for murdering the overseer over night;
but, as the country around was entirely destitute of food, it is
most probable that they perished as soon as their stock of flour
was exhausted.
� After obtaining possession/ continues Mr. Eyre, ?of all the
remaining arms, useless as they were at the moment, with some
ammunition, I made no examination then, but hurried away from the
fearful scene, accompanied by the King George?s Sound native, to
search for the horses, knowing that, if they got away now, no chance
whatever would remain of saving our lives. Already the wretched
animals had wandered to a considerable distance ; and although the
night was moonlight, yet the belts of scrub, intei?secting the plains,
were so numerous and dense that, for a long time, we could not find
them. Having succeeded in doing so at last, Wylie and I remained
with them, watching them during the remainder of the night; but
they were very restless, and gave us a deal of trouble. With an
aching heart, and in most painful reflection, I passed this dreadful
night, every moment appearing to be protracted to an hour', and it
seemed as if the daylight would never appear. About midnight the
wind ceased, and it became bitterly cold and frosty. I had nothing
on but a shirt and a pair of trousers, and suffered most acutely from
the cold. To mental anguish was now added intense bodily pain.
Suffering and distress had well-nigh overwhelmed me, and life
seemed hardly worth the effort necessary to prolong it. Ages can
never efface the horrors of this single night, nor would the wealth of
the world tempt me to go through similar ones again/
With daylight, Mr. Eyre and Wylie prepared to hasten from
this di?eadful scene. There was not sufficient sand on the sur-
face of the limestone to bury the body of the overseer, and
nothing remained but to wrap his blanket around it. The
sheep had all been consumed, or perished on the journey.
Eorty pounds of flour was now their only stock of provision;
and, abandoning everything else, save his charts and papers,
Mr. Eyre hurried from the spot with his solitary attendant,
Wylie. The two natives again appeared before starting, and
made efforts to gain over Wylie, but they could not be induced
to speak to Mr. Eyre, and, after a short time, they disappeared
in the desert.
The two travellers were now obliged to live chiefly on their
horses, curing the flesh in the sun, and carrying on a sufficient
quantity for some days? consumption. On these occasions, Mr.
Eyre, in the midst of such overwhelming troubles, records in
his note-book the strange appetite of Wylie for horseflesh.
When a horse was killed, lie ate several pounds before lying
down. During the night he got up almost hourly to resume
his feast. He lay on the ground. He roared in agonies of
indigestion. He begged to be allowed to rest a day. He was


very bad; too much walk had made him bad; he was curing
himself with horseflesh. In the morning he loaded himself,
notwithstanding his illness, with choice pieces, and, with tears
in his eyes, left behind him all that he could not carry. The
singular wall of cliffs, too, retired inland, and they were enabled
to gain access to the sea-shore, where they occasionally caught a
stinging ray-fish. At length, when human nature threatened to
sink under such long-continued fatigue and exposure, and to
reach the settlement at King George?s Sound, now close at
hand, appeared beyond their strength, a whaling barque was
sighted off the coast. On perceiving their signals, the commander
Captain Rossiter, of the French whaling-ship ? Mississippi
sent a boat for them, and they were received on board with
much hospitality. After recruiting themselves here for some
weeks, they were again landed, within easy reach of the settle-
ment, where they arrived in July 1841, after an absence of
over twelve months from Adelaide.
This immense journey places beyond question the astonishing
fact that a seaboard 1,500 miles long, from Spencer Gulf to
King George?s Sound, does not add one drop of water to the
ocean. How the drainage of the immense district to the north
of this coast is conducted, remains as yet unknown. Frequent
thunder-clouds, rising from the great Southern Ocean, passed
over Mr. Eyre?s head, and evidently burst before they pro-
ceeded many miles inland. At particular points, too, flights of
parrots were observed, birds which are rarely seen at a con-
siderable distance from water. From these and other consider-
ations, it is not improbable but that the absolute wastes which
Mr. Eyre traversed may extend little beyond the sea-coast, and
be succeeded by good and valuable land. For many years the
barren results of his coast journey have deterred research in
that direction; but recent explorations to the west of the
Torrens Basin, to which the course of our narrative will bring
us, are beginning to open a more promising tract of country to
the colonists of South Australia. At present, however, Mr.
Eyre brings us to the extremity of the South Coast, and,
rounding Cape Leeuwin, we again come out on the North-West
Coast. Here, while we have been following Mr. Eyre, the
? Beagle ? has been accumulating some further information for us.
Of the immense coast, however, from Perth to Hanover Bay,
we have nothing further to add. To the present day it lies
almost wholly unknown.
The ? Beagle,? it will be recollected, received Captain Grey
on board at the mouth of the Glenelg, after his encounter
with natives, and from the Glenelg we have to follow her still


more to the north, as she takes up the remaining portion of
the North-West Coast. Soon after her arrival in the Aus-
tralasian seas, the command of the * Beagle? devolved on Captain
Stokes. Of the portion of mainland now examined by this
traveller, our curiosity is greatly increased to know more.
The country appears a continuation of those rich and pic-
turesque scenes on the banks of the Glenelg, already described
by Sir George Grey; but the ? Beagle? allows us so little time
to examine them or to discover to what they lead inland, that
we must consider even this portion of the North-West Coast
as yet awaiting and inviting examination. Captain Stokes?
instructions, as commander of the ?Beagle,? applied only to a
marine survey of the coast, and his hours on land, which we
owe to a love, of exploration and to the very great promise
which the country held out to him, were necessarily limited by
this duty, and by the safety of his vessel. Stolen hours are
pleasant; and certainly the hours which Captain Stokes has
stolen to explore this portion of the North-West Coast furnish
very pleasant reading. We have adventures with crocodiles
and alligators, to remind us that we are among the tropics. We
go boating up river after river, thrusting aside, for the first time,
the overhanging thickets, amid the screaming of cockatoos and
the flights of innumerable paroquets, of every imaginable hue.
We obtain glimpses leading us to hope that we are "about to lift
the veil from the mysterious Interior. In King?s Sound, the
Fitzroy River was discovered, and followed up by a boat?s
crew of the ? Beagle 5 for ninety miles beyond the coast. It was
found to pass through a rich alluvial soil, abounding with
tropical vegetation, and the country beyond seemed equally
promising. Higher up on the coast, the River Adelaide was
discovered, and also followed up for about eighty miles inland.
But Captain Stokes? most valuable discovery on this coast was
the River Victoria, which he followed for 140 miles inland, and
quitted with regret. His explorations along the course of this
stream led him to regard it as the most promising inlet to the
Interior, and, with this view, he most strongly urged the for-
mation of an expedition to start from some point on its banks.
At the solicitation of the Royal Geographical Society, Captain
Stokes? recommendations were ultimately acted upon by the
British Government; and Mr. Gregory?s Victoria River Expe-
dition of 1856 is, doubtless, still in the recollection of our readers.
Owing to mishap and mismanagement, the Victoria River Expe-
dition has not added much to our knowledge of the Interior; but
it may not be uninteresting to refer to it again in its proper place.
Mith the Gulf of Carpentaria, Captain Stokes completed his


survey of this portion of the coast. At the head of the gulf he
discovered some considerable streams. The chief of these, the
Albert, he traced, by boat, for fifty miles inland, when, finding
the channel choked by fallen timber, he proceeded on foot for
several miles further through his Plains of Promise. In taking
leave of the ? Beagle,? we have to regret, equally with Captain
Stokes, that the safety of his vessel obliged him to relinquish
each of these tempting opportunities to obtain an insight into the
vast solitudes which lie behind the North-West Coast. *
At present, our narrative takes us back to the city of Ade-
laide, now hemmed in by Mr. Eyre?s gloomy Lake Torrens,
and the terrible South Coast which he had just traversed.
The settlers of the Adelaide district had abandoned all hope
of finding an outlet to the west. What was the nature of
the great Interior which lay to the north of them was now the
most important inquiry. Mr. Eyre?s exploration in that direc-
tion had terminated with Mount Hopeless. But Mount
Hopeless was situated on their side of Lake Torrens. It was
impossible to say what good land might lie on the northern shores
of the lake. It was impossible for the colonists to rest satisfied
jmtil the centre of the continent was actually reached, and the
possibility of an extension in that direction finally ascertained.
Captain Sturt had been the most successful of Australian ex-
plorers; and Captain Sturt must now settle this question for
them. In 1844, he started from Adelaide with a strong and
well-equipped party, consisting of sixteen men, the officers of
the expedition being Mr.,Poole, as second in command and sur-
veyor, Mr. Stuart (now so well known for his late exploits in
exploration), as draughtsman, and Mr. Brown, as surgeon.
Desirous to escape altogether from the meshes of Lake Tor-
rens, which had already entangled Mr. Eyre, he left that
district on his left hand, and passed up the Murray and the
Darling, merely making a descent, at intervals, oir the Torrens
basin, to ascertain the existence of an eastern arm. On each
of these occasions a shore was seen, similar in many respects to
* A further attempt has been made, within the past year, to learn
something more of this Coast. An exploring expedition, under the
command of Mr. F. T. Gregory, landed in Nickol Bay, midway in
the immense gap left by Sir George Grey between Swan River and
Hanover Bay, and endeavoured to penetrate inland, but was stopped
at some distance from the Coast, and obliged to return. It has,
however, ascertained the existence of a broad seaboard of excellent
agricultural land behind Nickol Bay, and makes it all but certain
that the North-West Coast is backed by a dividing range similar to
the dividing range of the East Coast.


the shore described by Mr. Eyre on the western arm; and
hence we have Lake Torrens, with its horseshoe shape, on our
maps.
. Leaving the Darling, which was taking him too much out of
his northern course, at its junction with a small tributary, called
by the natives the Williorara (the Menindie of the late expedi-
tion under Burke and Wills), he endeavoured to pass up the
M illiorara. But its waters quickly failed him, and pasture was
becoming daily more scarce. The expedition had started in
winter, so as by help of the spring showers to push to the
north. The sun was now beginning to dry up the pools, and
no time was to be lost By means of forced marches, Captain
Sturt and his men passed over a very inhospitable tract of
country, and reached as high as lat. when they unex-
pectedly came upon a picturesque spot, well watered and
supplied with food for the cattle. To this was given the name of
the Rocky Glen Depot; and here Captain Sturt determined to
allow both men and horses to recruit for some time, while he
explored the country beyond, for the purpose of selecting the
most safe northern route. With dismay he gradually ascer-
tained that no northern route was to be found. The Rocky
Glen ceased as suddenly towards the north as it had opened,
and the country beyond became an absolute desert. In
vain Captain Sturt and the officers under his command fol-
lowed the course of every creek now a cracked, baked
channel?and made long and harassing excursions into the
district around. Neither water nor pasture was to be found
beyond the Rocky Glen. Retreat, too, was cut off. The
summer?s sun had now dried up every pond and creek which
had supplied them on their line of march, and six months? im-
prisonment in the Rocky Glen Depot became certain.
Eor six months no rain fell. The violence of the sun
became insupportable. To escape from its rays, a large under-
ground chamber was excavated, to which the men retired during
the heat of the day. Gradually the surrounding desert closed
in on them. The whole vegetation of Rocky Glen became
mere snuff, and was carried away by the hot blast. Nothing
was left but the naked rocks, and the pool of water on whiph
their lives depended. Day by day, it too yielded to the fury of
the sun. ? Under its effects, every screw in our boxes had
been drawn, and the horn handles of our instruments, as well
as our combs, were split in fine laminas. The lead dropped
out of our pencils; our signal rockets were entirely spoiled;
? our hair, as well as the wool on the sheep, ceased to grow,
? an d our nails had become as brittle as glass.? Scurvy now


attacked the whole party. Some of the men would be un-
able to proceed with the expedition, and Mr. Poole was
dying. In this condition, the winter months came slowly
round, and the first refreshing shower fell. The way was
again open, and it might be possible to save Mr. Poole. A
litter of boughs and dried leaves was already prepared; and
with Mr. Poole six of the men endeavoured to make a retreat
on Adelaide. But the winter had been too long in coming.
Mr. Poole died a few hours after his attendants had quitted the
camp, and his body was brought back just as Captain Sturt
and the remainder of the expedition were about to start on their
northern course. His companions raised a rude pyramid of
stones on a neighbouring hill to mark the place of his in-
terment, and Mount Poole is all that is left to tell of the
weary days spent in the Pocky Glen Depot. ? That rude
* structure,? writes Captain Sturt, ? looks over his lonely grave,
? and will stand for ages, as a record of all we suffered in
* the dreary regions to which we were so long confined.?
About fifty miles further on, a fresh halting-place was dis-
covered, called Park Depot. And from Park Depot Captain
Sturt made two sustained efforts to reach the centre of the
continent, passing each time through districts of a most sin-
gular nature. And now, for the first time, we approach the
great Interior, ? that region from which the Murray had formerly
borne Captain Sturt aside, and from which the gloomy prospect
seen from Mount Hopeless had, more recently, compelled Mr.
Eyre to turn. Doubtless, to the results of these two efforts is
to be mainly attributed the opinion, up to a late period so
almost universal, that all Central Australia would be found of
a very worthless character. How strong were the grounds for
this opinion we shall the better judge when we have followed
our explorers on these two excursions from Park Depot.
Accompanied by Mr. Brown and three men. Captain Sturt
started from Park Depot, maintaining a course 25 degrees west
of north, or, in other words, bearing right down on the centre of
the continent. In a short time, the country assumed all the
appearance of a desert. Neither grass nor water was any
longer visible, and the eye rested on nothing, to the brink of
the horizon, but reddish-brown sand. Gradually, as they ad-
vanced, this sand swelled into long parallel ridges, running from
east to west, and rising higher and higher, until at length our
explorers found themselves toiling over a very ocean of solid
billows, some 50 or 60 feet high, and succeeding each other in
endless uniformity. This formation bore no traces of the
action of water, and must have been the slow result of a prevail-


ing wind accumulating its solid waves in the gradual course of
ages. At the distance of about 200 miles from Park Depot,
this singular country came to an abrupt termination, and our
explorers stood before what is now known as Sturt?s Stony
Desert. The parallel sand ridges, running from east to west,
were suddenly chopped off at right angles, and, in their stead,
stretched an immense level plain, uninterrupted all round the
horizon from south to north, and thickly strewn with small
fragments of quartz, firmly packed together, and rounded as if
waterworn. Still adhering to their course, 25 degrees west of
north, our party descended into this singular plain, and pro-
ceeded on their way over its natural pavement. Neither herb
nor shrub protruded through the firmly-wedged quartz frag-
ments. No sound or movement could be heard or seen all round
them, and the dray-wheels and hoofs of the horses left not the
least impression on the surface of the plain. All that could
attract or sustain animal and vegetable life Nature seemed to
have rigidly excluded from this scene of desolation. Thus the
sun went down, and Captain Sturt and his men encamped for
the night in the Stony Desert.
With the morning, our party was again under weigh; and,
at the distance of about thirty miles from its commencement,
the Stony Desert was found to come to an equally abrupt ter-
mination. An immense plain of clay, or dried mud, now lay
before them, entirely destitute of vegetation, and resembling, as
Captain Sturt describes it, ? a boundless ploughed field, on
f which floods had settled and subsided.? No water, however,
could be found, and the earth, cracked by the heat of the sun,
abounded in immense fissures, which were avoided only by ex-
treme watchfulness and care. Still maintaining their original
course, our party arrived at the termination of this plain also,
and found the tall sand ridges re-appear, precisely as they had
left them on the eastern shore of the Stony Desert. In fact, the
whole district seemed merely interrupted by the course of the
Stony Desert and Mud Plain from north to south, and again re-
sumed its former appearance without any disturbance whatever.
Again our explorers toiled over this solid ocean of red billows?
an ocean seen, as it were, under the glare of some great confla-
gration*, lashed into waves running mountains high, and then
suddenly frozen all round from centre to horizon. From want of

from the reflection of the bare surface of red sand.? ( Despatch of
Mr. A. C. Gregory, published in Proceedings of Royal Geographical
Society for 1857.)


food and water, the horses were now almost exhausted; and the
men, who could bring nothing with them from Park Depot but
some tea and a little flour, were scarcely better able to encounter
the difficulties of this most harassing country.
At length a small creek appeared ahead, and revived the
hopes of the party. It received the name of Eyre?s Creek.
It contained some good water, and communicated sufficient
fertility to its neighbourhood to furnish a meal for the horses.
On following it down, however, it soon died out on the desert,
leaving merely a few incrustations of salt, and leading to a
country as destitute of vegetation as that they had already
traversed. Resuming their original course, from the slight de-
viation along Eyre?s Creek, the party again proceeded on their
way, and penetrated to lat. 25� 50' without meeting any further
signs of vegetation, and only a creek?whether a continuation of
Eyre?s Creek was not ascertained?which afforded no relief to
man or horse. c Its channel was glittering white, and thickly
c encrusted with salt, nor was any water visible; but, on going
? down to examine it, in several places, where the salt had
f the appearance of broken and rotten ice, we found that
f there were deep pools of perfect brine underneath, on which
c the salt floated, to the thickness of three or four inches.?
They were now more than 400 miles from Park Depot, and,
with the exception of the head of Eyre?s Creek, some fifty
miles behind, had nothing in the intermediate region to fall
back upon. They had advanced 200 miles beyond the Stony
Desert, without meeting any indications of a permanent change
in the nature of the country, or any encouragement whatever
to proceed further. Both men and horses were so weak that
any further advance would greatly endanger their retreat on
Eyre?s Creek. Under these circumstances. Captain Sturt de-
cided to fall back on Eyre?s Creek, and, by its assistance, to
regain the Depot. To reach the centre of the continent, in
their present condition, would strain both horse and man; and
should the centre of the continent be found a desert, their de-
struction would be certain.
?Yet I turned from it with a feeling of bitter disappointment. I
was, at that moment, scarcely a degree from the tropic, and within
150 miles of the centre of the continent. If I had gained that spot,
my task would have been performed, my most earnest wish would
have been gratified; but, for some wise purpose, this was denied me.
Yet I may truly say that I should not thus have abandoned my
position, if it had not been a measure of urgent and imperative
necessity.?
The party regained the main expedition with considerable


difficulty, and in a most exhausted condition. And so ends the
first excursion from Park Depot.
After some short rest at Park Depot, Captain Sturt again
started with Mr. Stuart and two men. His present object may
be shortly explained. The whole appearance of the Stony
Desert its immense deposits of mud on its western bank, the
watervvorn appearance of its quartz pebbles, the sudden change
from sand ridge to level pavement and from mud bank to sand
ridge, the similarity of the country for so many miles on each
side of it all led him to the conclusion that it was the dry
bed of some immense watercourse coming down from the north.
Should this conclusion be correct, the Stony Desert would be
again met by a more northern route, and might possibly furnish
a key to the solution of this strange country. With this object
Captain Sturt left his former course to Eyre?s Creek a little on
the left, diverging from it at a small stream which he called, in
honour of his friend and fellow explorer, Strzelecki?s Creek, and
maintained a course from Strzelecki?s Creek almost due north.
After some days? travelling, our explorers were agreeably
surprised by increasing signs of fertility, and on the seventh
day of their journey they came upon the banks of a fine creek
flowing through an extensive and even picturesque tract of
pastoral country. This is Cooper?s Creek, so recently asso-
ciated with the melancholy fate of Burke and Wills, after they
had solved the most important problem of Australian exploration.
Returning to their original course, after some examination of
the Cooper?s Creek district. Captain Sturt and his small party
soon left this oasis behind them, and were again tolling over a
sea of red sand ridges, exactly similar to those met with in the
first excursion from Park Depot. At the end of another week?s
travelling, the Stony Desert again appeared in all its awful
stillness. It seemed broader at this point, and, though preserv-
ing the same features on its eastern bank, some changes w r ere
now observed on its opposite shore. There was no mud plain,
and the Stony Desert itself, instead of being replaced by the
red sand ridges, seemed to extend its character to the surround-
ing country. Some hills were completely covered to their
summits wuth the same description of quartz fragments, so
closely strewn as to obstruct all vegetation. Nor could any
water be discovered. The country beyond seemed of a most
forbidding character, and both men and horses were now suffer-
ing severely from want of water. For half an hour Captain
Sturt sat on the summit of one of those quartz-clad hills,
sweeping the horizon with his telescope, hoping to find some
encouragement to advance. But no change in the nature


of the country could be detected, and the attempt was aban-
doned.
? I was now nearly fifty miles from water, and feared that, as it
was, some of my horses would fail before I could get back to it. Yet
I lingered, undecided, on the hill, reluctant to make up my mind, for
I felt that, if I thus again retired, it would be a virtual abandonment
of the task undertaken. I should be doing an injustice to Mr. Stuart
and my men, if I did not here mention that I told them the position
we were placed in, and the chance on which our safety would
depend, if we went on. They might well have been excused, if they
expressed an opinion contrary to such a course; but the only reply
they made me was to assure me that they were ready and willing to
follow me to the last. After this, I believe I sat on the hill for more
than half an hour, with the telescope in my hand ; but there was
nothing to encourage me onward.?
Keluctantly the horses? heads were turned, and the most
protracted effort yet witnessed to reach the centre of the con-
tinent was finally abandoned. The party now hastened to
throw themselves back on Cooper?s Creek, some 200 miles dis-
tant, and the nearest halting-place. It was a journey for life
or death. The horses which refused to proceed were abandoned
on the way. When a horse fell, his light baggage was hastily
distributed among the rest, and the retreat continued. Unin-
terruptedly, night and day, they retreated. At night one of
the men went before them with a lantern, and thus assisted in
their course over these vast sand ridges, and through the un-
broken solitude of the Stony Desert, our explorers safely
reached Cooper?s Creek. Over these regions, the hot winds,
so disagreeably felt even on the coast settlements, blow with
unusual violence. On the morning of their arrival at Cooper?s
Creek, one of these hot winds began to blow, and towards mid-
day raged with great fury. The leaves of the trees along the
creek became crisp in a few moments, c and fell like a snow
f shower around us.? The wastes of sand ridges,* from which
they had just escaped, seemed now a very ocean. The crests of
the sand billows were cut off, and whirled on high in thick
spray. Blinding torrents of fine sand, driven before the wind,
were poured over the Cooper?s Creek district, smarting and
blistering the feverish skin. Towards the horizon, sea and sky
were mingled in one red mass. Every living thing turned from
the glow. An all-pervading relaxation seized man and beast.
The horses were unable to bear the weight of their own heads.
Propped against trees, and turned from the hot wind, they let
their heads fall to the ground as if the muscles of the neck had
been severed. A thermometer, graduated to 127�, burst from
the excessive heat, though placed in the fork of a large tree-.

And, in all probability, had this tempest overtaken our party in
the desert, they would have all perished. Passing through
Cooper?s Creek district. Captain Sturt with his men again joined
the main expedition at Park Depot, greatly weakened by sick-
ness, and scarcely capable of any further exertion. On the
following day, he found himself unable to walk. In a day or
two more, his muscles became rigid, and his limbs contracted.
* Gradually also my skin blackened. The least movement put me
f to torture, and I was reduced to a state of perfect prostration.?
But Park Depot was many hundreds of miles from Adelaide,
and an immediate retreat was now necessary. Already another
summer had come round, and the sun was drying up all the
pools and watercourses on the way. It was doubtful, indeed,
whether the way was still open. Mr. Brown proposed to go and
ascertain, lest the expedition should be again caught in the
desert. Unless Flood?s Creek, about 150 miles nearer Adelaide,
contained sufficient water, it would be dangerous to move the
expedition, and Mr. Brown determined to learn the condition
of Flood?s Creek. The hide of a bullock was sewn together so
as to form a water-tight bag. This, filled with water, was
placed on the way some seventy miles in advance, and on the
following morning Mr. Brown started with a light spring cart,
containing about thirty gallons of water. By this contrivance
he was enabled to supply himself and his horse with water
half way on his journey, without encroaching on the store which
he carried with him. Anxiously the men watched for his re-
turn. On his report depended another six months? imprison-
ment in Rocky Glen Depot, and both officers and men recalled
Rocky Glen Depot with horror. On the eighth day they came
to Sturt?s tent to tell him that Mr. Brown had appeared in
sight, and in a few minutes he stood before him. ??Well,
?Brown,? said I, ?what news??is it to be good or bad??
? ? There is still water in the creek,? said he; ? but that is all I
? can say. What there is, is as black as ink; and we must
? make haste, for in a week it will be all gone.? ? A bed of leaves
was placed in one of the carts, into which Captain Sturt was
lifted, and the whole expedition commenced its retreat from
Central Australia. Flood?s Creek was safely reached, and it
enabled them to push on to the Murray. The news was
carried down the Murray that Sturt, now nineteen months
absent and supposed dead, was returning. The settlers along
its banks hastened to place their carriages at the service of him-
self and his exhausted men. Under the light of an Australian
moon, they again passed the clustering vines and golden wheat
fields which surround Adelaide.


? I reached mj home/ writes their commander, 4 at midnight, on
the 19th of January, and, on crossing its threshold, raised my wife
from the floor, on which she had fallen, and heard the carriage of
my considerate friends roll rapidly away.?
While the people of Adelaide were seeking an extension of
settlement towards the north, the people of Sydney were also
occupied by a project of their own. Between Sydney and India,
China, and the rich islands of the Dutch in the Indian Archi-
pelago, lay the whole continent of Australia. If their ships
went to the south-west, there was more than half the continent
to sail round. If they went to the north-east, there were the great
Barrier Beef, 1,200 miles long, and the dangerous Torres Strait,
where the timbers of many a stout Sydney barque lay moulder-
ing on the small islands which choke the passage. An overland
route to the Gulf of Carpentaria would bring the Indian
Archipelago almost to their door. With a practical route to
the Gulf of Carpentaria, the whole commerce of Southern and
Western Asia and its islands would be thrown open to the
Australian colonies. What then appeared a golden dream is
doubtless now on the eve of being accomplished. Burke and
Wills have laid a way to the shores of the Gulf, and, but for the
terrible mishap of a few hours, might have lived to see it
occupied by the iron road and the electric wore.
Sir Thomas Mitchell, who was then Surveyor-General of the
colony of New South Wales, warmly advocated this project.
He invited Dr. Leichhardt, who was already known for some
explorations he had conducted in the neighbourhood of Moreton
Bay to the north of Sydney, and which eventually laid the
foundations of the new colony of Queensland, to accompany him
on an expedition to the shores of the gulf. As however there was
no probability that Sir Thomas Mitchell could leave Sydney dur-
ing that year, Dr. Leichhardt accepted the command of the expe-
dition, and started on his way in 1844, the same year in which
Captain Sturt had already started from Adelaide. Dr. Leich-
hardt?s journey adds nothing to our knowledge of the interior.
It was entirely a coast route, and though of enormous length
extending from Sydney to Port Essington, a distance, along the
coast, of not less than 3000 miles?and leading the way to much
excellent land afterwards occupied by the colonists of Bew South
Wales, it would possess little interest for us now but for the im-
penetrable mystery which still enshrouds the fate of a succeeding
expedition commanded by the same leader. Nor had it any
influence whatever on the discovery of an available overland route
to the Gulf of Carpentaria. An elevated coast range, we have
already seen, extends from Sydney to the shores of the Gulf.


The eastern slope of this range, overlooking the Pacific, is well
watered by numerous coast streams, and possesses extensive
terraces of fine pastoral land, though every now and again inter-
rupted by broken and almost impassable districts. Along these
slopes Dr. Leichhardt led his party, with abundance of water
and pasture for the cattle ; but its position, and the nature of
the country, render it, for a commercial high road, as little useful
as the north-west passage to India.
In the following year, Sir Thomas Mitchell started in his
turn, with Mr. Kennedy,?a young surveyor, in the employ-
ment of the Government, ?Dr. Stephenson, and a well-
equipped party of twenty-six men. Dr. Leichhardt, we
have seen, proceeded along the eastern slope of the Great
Dividing Range. Sir Thomas Mitchell now decided on examin-
ing its summit and western slope, expecting to pick up some
stream, at its source, which would lead him to the shores of the
gulf. No such passage was found; but the discoverer of
Australia Felix was, in a great measure, compensated by the
magnificent country which now disclosed itself within tropical
Australia, ?in many spots, indeed, exceeding in luxuriance and
beauty of scenery the Australia Felix of 1835. Advancing
beyond the Darling, and making direct for the tropic, Sir
Thomas Mitchell found himself within a network of streams,
taking their rise in the Dividing Range, and flowing through
the broad rich table-lands which were now found to form its
highest elevation. Here, at the very time Captain Sturt and
his men, in the same latitude, and at the foot of the very same
Dividing Range, were buffeting the red sand billows and in-
haling the scorching blast of the desert, the expedition under
Sir Thomas Mitchell was wandering through the most lovely
Claude-like scenery, and following the course of such streams
as prompted their discoverer to name them, the ? Claude,? the
? Lorraine,? the 4 Salvator,? &c.
? Here,? he writes, ? the weather was most pleasant, temperate, and
English-like, though we were still within the tropics. A sweet
breeze blew from the south-west, and the degree of temperature was
between 50 and 60 degrees of Fahrenheit, ?the most agreeable of
any, I believe, to the human frame. There was abundance of water,
and the young grass was daily growing higher.?
But Sir Thomas Mitchell?s chief discovery in this district was
the river Victoria, ? of course, wholly unconnected with Captain
Stokes? Victoria, on the North-West Coast, at the opposite ex-
tremity of the continent. Here, at length, appeared to be the
long-sought stream opening a passage to the Gulf of Carpentaria;
and anxiously the expedition followed it down the western


slopes and table-lands of the Great Dividing Range, along banks
waving with perfumed lilies, through rich deep meadows, with
splendid reaches of water, capable, as Sir Thomas Mitchell
writes, of floating steamers of the largest tonnage. The Victoria
was followed for about 200 miles, when the provisions of the
expedition, reduced by their previous explorations, totally foiled
them, and the pursuit was abandoned, though the stream
appeared still tending towards the north. Strangely enough,
Sturt and Mitchell were then on the banks of the same stream,
for the Victoria and Cooper?s Creek have been since ascer-
tained to be the same river,? and could they then have com-
pared notes, it would have been known that the hopes of a
passage to the north, by the Victoria, were altogether delusive.
That stream, shortly after Sir Thomas Mitchell?s farthest point
on it, takes a turn towards the south, and thenceforward main-
tains an entirely southern course. Mr. Gregory, who, at a
subsequent period, followed the course of the Victoria through
most inhospitable wastes, ?? ridges of red drift sand, ten to fifty
f feet high, running parallel to each other, and in a nearly north
? and south direction, ? boundless mud plains,? and tracts resern-
? bling the stony desert described by Captain Sturt,? found it,
at length, to form the western arm of Lake Torrens, which is
separated from the head of Spencer Gulf, near Adelaide, by a
narrow isthmus, flooded only during a rainy season.
Of the Victoria, however, nothing was then known in Sydney,
save what Sir Thomas Mitchell had just seen. A noble stream,
through a garden of lilies, and making for the head of the Gulf
of Carpentaria, seemed well worth following, and Mr. Kennedy,
the second in command of Sir Thomas Mitchell?s late expedi-
tion, was instructed to trace its further course. Taking it up
where the late expedition had been forced to retreat on Sydney,
this young officer proceeded along its banks. But, even in the
comparatively short distance between Mitchell?s furthest and the
rich Cooper?s Creek district, the Victoria traverses an absolute
desert. Scarcely any water, and no food for the horses, could
be found; the river-bed had taken a permanently southern
direction, and, as a road to the north, was valueless. Having
satisfied himself, therefore, that the Victoria was the Cooper?s
Creek of which Captain Sturt had just brought intelligence to
Adelaide, Mr. Kennedy returned to Sydney.
We may here, almost without interruption to the order of
events, follow the short career of this spirited young officer.
Though unable to discover a practical overland route to the
head of the Gulf of Carpentaria, the people of Sydney were
not inclined to abandon all hope of communication with its


shores. York Peninsula is that enormous isosceles triangle
which forms the eastern arm of the Gulf of Carpentaria. The
base of this triangle is an imaginary line from Rockingham Bay
to the head of the gulf. A land communication along this
imaginary line would save a considerable distance of sea voyage,
and would wholly escape Torres Strait. The Indian and Chinese
traders, and the Dutch islanders, might then land their wares at
the head of the gulf. A few coasters from Rockingham Bay to
the colonies would complete the rest of the journey. But
York Peninsula was a terra incognita, and Mr. Kennedy, some
months after his return from the Victoria River, was sent to
explore it. He was to examine the peninsula on its Pacific side,
from Rockingham Bay to its vertex, Cape York. A colonial
sloop was to lie off Cape York, to supply stores to the exploring
party, on its arrival there, when the exploring party was to turn,
and examine the gulf side, down to its head.
In 1848, Mr. Kennedy and his party of twelve men, including
a native black, named Jacky Jacky, were landed at Rockingham
Bay, and the colonial sloop f Albion ? took up its post off Cape
York. The whole particulars of the terrible tragedy enacted on
York Peninsula we shall probably never learn. Month after
month, the i Albion? lay off Cape York, but the man on the
look-out reported no signal from the shore. At length, at the
end of six months, the signal-man called the officers to witness
a strange appearance on the sea-beach. A native naked,
emaciated, and apparently dying was seen to crawl from the
dense woods which overhang Cape York. He held a bough in
his hand. Gaining the beach, he waved the bough in the
direction of the ?Albion.? A boat was immediately lowered,
and the native brought on board. He proved to be Jacky
Jacky, at death?s door, from wounds and hunger. For fourteen
days, he said, he had tasted nothing but water. His clothes,
which, as a member of the exploring expedition, he had received
from the Government store at Sydney, he had used to bury Mr.
Kennedy. While he greedily devoured the food placed before
him, the officers and men of the * Albion ? listened to his tale.
When the party landed at Rockingham Bay, they found the
country covered with a dense and tall scrub. For four months,
they literally cut their way towards Cape York, through this
scrub, with saws and hatchets, and seldom making more than a
mile or two a day. Their provisions became exhausted, and
they ate their horses. When they had eaten their horses, they
were still 200 miles from Cape York. The soil, excluded from
sun and air by the dense scrub, was found most unhealthy.
Most of the men, from sickness and insufficiency of food, were


now too weak to proceed any further. In this strait, Mr.
Kennedy placed eight of the men in camp, near the sea-shore,
at Weymouth Bay, and, taking Jacky Jacky and three of the
strongest men with him, set forward to procure assistance from
the ?Albion.? A savage tribe now appeared in their track.
After some days? travelling, a dangerous accident happened to
one of the men from the explosion of a gun, and he could not
be moved. Leaving the other two men to protect him, Mr.
Kennedy again hurried on with Jacky Jacky. The blacks now
got ahead of them. At Escape River they showered their
spears on them. Jacky was wounded in the face. Mr.
Kennedy received several spears in the back, leg, and sides.
He fell, but immediately stood up again; fired his gun, and
then fell again. Jacky stood over him, with his gun cocked.
It missed fire, but he still covered the savages. Mr. Kennedy?s
aim had been true one savage was writhing in the agonies of
death. The rest drew back, and peered from behind the trees.
Jacky seized his master, and carried him down to the stream,
through a belt of scrub.
??He said,? continues the faithful fellow, ??Don?t carry me far.?
Then Mr. Kennedy looked this way (imitating him), very bad. I said
to him, ? Don?t look far away,? as I thought he would be frightened.
I asked him often, ?Are you well now?? and he said, ?I don?t care
for the spear wound in my leg, but for the other two spear wounds in
my side and back;? and he said, ?I am bad inside, Jacky.? I told
him, ? Black fellow always die, when he gets spear in there.? He
said, ?I am out of wind, Jacky ! ? I asked him, ? Mr. Kennedy, are
you going to leave me?? and he said, ? Yes, my boy, I am going to
leave you.? He said, ?I am very bad, Jacky; you take the books to
the Captain of the ?Albion;? but not the big ones. The Governor
(of New South Wales) will give anything for them.? I then tied
up the papers. He then said, ? Jacky, give me paper, and I will
write.? I gave him paper and pencil, and he tried to write; and he
then fell back, and died. And 1 caught as he fell, and held him; and
I then turned round myself, and cried. I was crying a good
while, until I got well. That was about an hour, and then I buried
him. I digged up the ground with a tomahawk, and covered him
over with logs, then grass, and my shirt and trousers.??*
Jacky kept watch until dark. Then he slipped silently into
the stream, and waded up its channel, keeping his head only
above water, until he was sufficiently far to escape detection.
From Escape River he crept on through the silent woods,
exhausted by wounds and hunger, and ? falling asleep,? as he

said, for whole days beside ponds and waterholes, until at length
he reached Cape York.
On hearing his story, the 4 Albion ? was immediately got under
weigh, and all haste made to relieve the remainder of the party.
Jacky pointed out where the wounded man and his two com-
panions had been left, along the coast. Captain Dobson landed,
but could find none of them. Nor has their fate been yet
discovered; though portions of European clothing were found
among the savages in the neighbourhood, which left little doubt
but they had been murdered. From this the 4 Albion ? crowded
all sail to Weymouth Bay, where the remainder of the men had
been left in camp. On landing, the ship?s officers discovered a
European at a wells side, sitting on his pitcher. They hastened
to him, but he was quite dead. They proceeded to the camp.
A. lionible smell caused them almost to faint. Few had the
nerve to enter. Five bodies were lying in their beds, and had
lam foi some weeks. Two beds showed signs of having been
occupied within some hours. Their owners were looking for
shell-fish on the beach. They had seen the ? Albion,? and'now
staggeied back to camp?mere skin and bone, and so weak that
they had been unable to drag their dead companions out of their
beds to bury them. Search was next made for the body of Mr.
Kennedy, but his grave had been opened, and the body removed.
Ao tiace of it, or of his papers, has been yet discovered.
Jacky says he hid the papers in the hollow of a tree, but they
could not be found.
The Victoria River was yet again to be associated with
disaster. Dr. Leichhardt had been for some time making pre-
parations for an expedition, even more important than his great
overland Expedition to Port Esslngton. He proposed to bisect
the whole continent by taking the greatest diameter possible
as a base route. Moreton Bay and Perth are the two extremities
of such a diameter, and Dr. Leichhardt was preparing to cross
from the Moreton Bay district to the capital of Western
Australia, by a line passing through the centre of the continent.
Kennedy had just brought the news from Sydney that the
Victoria had abandoned its northern course, and was coming
lound to the west. It seemed, therefore, to offer a passage into
Central Australia, and Dr. Leichhardt determined to avail
himself of it. Early in 1848, a month or so before Mr.
Kennedy started for Tork Peninsula, he left Sydney with a
large and well-equipped party under his command. Of the
fate of himself and his whole party, no trace has ever been
discovered up to the present moment. A horse, said to belong
to the expedition, did arrive at Adelaide some years ago, but


this affords little clue. Horses abandoned by Captain Sturt in
Central Australia, as dying, have arrived after many years in
Adelaide. The little that we do know of the proceedings of
the lost expedition may be told in very few words indeed. It
will be recollected that nothing was then known of the Victoria
beyond Cooper?s Creek district, nor that the Victoria was the
Cooper?s Creek of Captain Sturt, except from Mr. Kennedy?s
conjectures. No one then imagined that the Victoria, after its
wanderings in Central Australia, would bring the traveller back
again to settled districts. It is, at least, certain that Dr. Leich-
hardt made direct for the banks of the Victoria. It is also
certain that Dr. Leichhardt abandoned the Victoria when he
found it leading him too much to the south. Mr. Kennedy, in
his excursion down the Victoria, had discovered a large and
imposing tributary joining it on the right-hand bank. This he
called the Thomson. It then possessed a considerable body of
water indeed, was as large as the Victoria itself. In spring
time it would doubtless hold out a tempting offer to an ex-
pedition seeking to penetrate the interior. Dr. Leichhai?dt left
Sydney in April, and would arrive at this portion of the Victoria
about the beginning of the Australian Spring. Mr. Gregory
some ten years after, in 1857, shortly after his return from his
explorations on the North-West Coast, started from Sydney,
under instructions from the New South Wales Government, to
discover, if possible, some traces of the lost expedition. Their
marks were not yet obliterated on the banks of the Victoria.
So far into the interior as the 146 th meridian, Mr. Gregory
found a tree marked ? L,? after which no further trace could be
discovered on the Victoria. The 146 th meridian is, however,
higher up the stream than the junction of the Thomson. Mr.
Gregory accordingly arrived at the conclusion that the expe-
dition had, at this point, abandoned the Victoria and passed up
the Thomson. Under this conjecture he himself passed up the
Thomson almost to the tropic. It was then summer, and the
river at that point presented merely a dry and baked channel,
without water or grass. It was evidently leading out into
Sturt?s great desert, but offered no inducement to proceed.
There can scarcely be a doubt but that Dr. Leichhardt, passing
up the Thomson at a more promising season of the year,
launched out on that terrible country which had so nearly en-
tombed Captain Sturt and his men. Whether the impending
summer cut off retreat, or a hostile tribe attacked them on the
western borders for it is almost certain that no tribes, unless
perhaps a few isolated families mutually afraid of each other,
inhabit Central Australia ?is left to mere conjecture. Yet it


is impossible but that traces of so large an expedition are still
extant. If they died within Central Australia, their remains are
still there, probably undisturbed. If they were murdered by a
border tribe, it is certain that their arms and implements are
still preserved by them. Now that secure halting places have
been discovered within Central Australia, and that its explorer
is longer driven to a series of forced marches for life or death,
it might be yet possible, without risk, to clear up the myste-
rious tate of Dr. Leichhardt and his men.
With the lost expedition of Dr. Leichhardt we have come down
to a period so fresh in the memory of our readers that there is
little left for our narrative to supply. Indeed, with the unpro-
mising account brought by Captain Sturt from Central Aus-
tralia, the tragic fate of Mr. Kennedy?s expedition, and the
disappearance of Dr. Leichhardt?s whole party, enterprise in
Australian exploration received a considerable check. Nothing
of importance was attempted until Mr. Gregory?s Victoria
River Expedition landed on the North-West Coast in 1855, for
the purpose of carrying out, under the instructions of the British
Government and the Royal Geographical Society, the recom-
mendations of Captain Stokes. It will be sufficient to give a
very rapid sketch of the progress of that expedition premising
that the loss of the ?Torn Tough ? in the river, and the mis-
management of the depot of stores for the overland party at
the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria, very much weakened its
resources. Following up the Victoria of Captain Stokes to
lat. 18 12' and long. 130� 39', where it appears to take its rise,
Mr. Gregory found himself on the summit of a dividing range,
similar to the Dividing Range of the East Coast. Descending
the slope of this range towards the interior, he penetrated, by
help of a small creek, so low as lat. 18� 31', long. 131� 44'.
Turning thence eastward, he proceeded along the borders of a
very inhospitable tract of country, in hope of meeting some
fresh inlet, until at length another creek was discovered making
for the interior, to which the name of Sturt?s Creek w r as given.
Sturt s Creek led the exploring party as low south as lat. 20� 16',
long. 127 35', or five degrees below the mouth of the Victoria,
and wanting about two and a half degrees of the centre. For
the first 100 miles traversed by it, the land along its right bank
consisted of vast plains of rich soil covered with beautiful
grass. As they followed it, however, the country gradually
deteriorated, and Sturt?s Creek at length terminated in a chain

Colonies Proceedings of Royal Geographical Society, 1858.


of dry salt lakes, for which no outlet could be found. Unable
to penetrate any further towards the south, Mr. Gregory pro-
ceeded to the head of the Gulf of Carpentaria, but, finding no
stores to meet him there, he was forced to retreat on Sydney
by Dr. Leichhardt?s old route. *
Nothing further remains to be noticed until we come to the
late explorations of Mr. Stuart from Adelaide, and of the ex-
pedition under the command of Messrs. Burke and Wills from
Melbourne. Nor have we anything to add to the accounts of
these so recently published, save to endeavour to award to each
of these travellers his fair share in the solution of the two problems
which had so long resisted the efforts of Australian explorers?
to reach the centre, and to cross the continent. It is quite true
that Mr. Stuart solved the one, and Messrs. Burke and Wills
the other. Yet this is a judgment scarcely fair to Mr. Stuart.
He has certainly done something more. If to cross the con-
tinent means to cross from known to known, then Mr. Stuart
had solved both problems before the expedition under Messrs.
Burke and Wills had left Melbourne. If to cross the con-
tinent means to cross from sea-beach to sea-beach, then had
Mr. Stuart been repulsed from almost every point of the
compass, in no less than seventeen attempts, and been twice
driven back on Adelaide before Messrs. Burke and Wills gazed
on the waters of the Gulf. A rapid sketch of the results of
Mr. Stuart?s explorations may not be uninteresting, more
especially as it will afford a view of the relative position of the
two expeditions in the field.
Since the return of Captain Sturt from Central Australia,
the people of Adelaide had sought in vain for an extension
of territory. They always kept explorers in the field, and
Messrs. Hack, Swindon, Freeling, Warburton, and lastly Mr.
Babbage, had cleared up a good deal that was vague and un-
certain in and around the Torrens Basin. The large flock-
owners, too, were not idle, and many of them had eaten their
way into the surrounding country as far as safety allowed.
Yet the colony of South Australia was still little more than
the Adelaide district in an Immense and unknown wilderness.
At length, in 1858, Mr. Stuart made some discoveries of great
importance to the colonists. Penetrating to the west of Lake
Torrens with one white man, and a native who treacherously
deserted them ?he came upon an extensive district of country
abounding in natural springs, and clothed with the Kangaroo
grass so highly prized by the Australian flockowners. For
this discovery the Colonial Government presented him with
a large tract of land within the district.


Towards the close of 1860, news arrived in Adelaide that
Mr. Stuart and two men had reached the centre and crossed
over to the north coast, and, in a few days, Mr. Stuart himself
arrived in Adelaide, and lodged his maps and papers in the
hands of the Government. As these documents alter all pre-
conceived opinions of the character of the interior, we make an
extract here and there. Mr. Stuart and his two men commenced
their exploration on March 1, 1860, from Chambers? Creek, in
the district discovered by him in 1858, and journeyed in the
direction of the centre:
1 March 29. The country travelled over to-day is the best I have
ever seen.
March 30. Struck another large gum creek [a creek fringed
by the gum tree, or eucalyptus'], coming from the south of west,
and running to the south-east. It is a fine creek: its courses of
watei spread over a grassy plain a mile wide. The water holes
long and deep, with immense plants growing on its banks,
indicating permanent water. The wild oats on its banks are four
feet high. Ihe country gone ov6r to-day, although stony, is com-
pletely covered with grass, and even better than that passed over
yesterday.
1 April 3, We passed over a plain of as fine country as any man
could wish to see a beautiful red soil, covered with grass a foot
high. . . . I have not passed such splendid country since I have
been in the colony.
l April 12.?Again struck the creek coming from the west, and
several other gum creeks coming from the range. We have now
entered the lower hills of the range, and have travelled through a
splendid country for grass.
? April 15. The country in the ranges is as fine a pastoral country
as a man could wish to possess, having grass to the tops of the hills,
and an abundance of water through the ranges.
1 April 22.?-I find, from my observations of the sun, that lam
now camped in the Centre of Australia. About two and a half
miles to the N.N.E. is a high mount. I wish it had been in the
S� to to-morrow, and build a cone of stones, plant
the British flag, and name it, Central Mount Stuart. . . . Splendid
grass all around.
� April 23.?Centre. Took Keckwick and the flag, and went to
� 16 moun b which I find to be much higher and more
difficult than I supposed ; but, after numerous slips and knocks, we
reached the top. It is as high as Mount Serle, if not higher. The
view to the north is over a large plain of gum, mulga, and spinifix,
with watercourses running through. The large gum creek that we
crossed winds round this hill, in a north-east direction; at ten miles,
it is joined by another. . . . Built the cone of stones, in the centre
o which I placed a pole, with the British flag nailed to it. On the
top of the cone I placed a small bottle, in which is a slip of paper,


stating by whom it was raised. We then gave three hearty cheers
for the flag.?
We have extracted sufficient to show that Central Aus-
tralia is very far from being the worthless country which it
was so long supposed to be. Our extracts are from the rough
notes of Mr. Stuart taken down at the end of each day?s
journey, and placed in the care of the Colonial Government
without any further revision. Beyond the centre, their great
difficulties commenced. Mr. Stuart made three efforts to reach
the coast by a north-west course, and each time was driven
back on the centre by dense belts of scrub and scarcity of water,
both men and horses suffering severely from illness and fatigue.
A north-west course to the sea was at length abandoned, and
Mr. Stuart attempted to reach the coast by a north-east course
from the centre. On this course, as our readers are aware,
Mr. Stuart and his small party were attacked by savages, and
obliged to retire. His extreme northern point, in this year,
was lat. 18� 47', long. 134� O'. Mr. Gregory, we have seen,
descended from the north, along his Sturt?s Creek, to lat. 20�
16'. Mr. Stuart, therefore, even on this occasion, overlapped
the explorations of Mr. Gregory by close on degrees of lati-
tude. In fact, Mr. Stuart had arrived within a district already
marked by the routes of Mr. Gregory, Captain Stokes, and
Dr. Leichhardt. This attack of natives occurred in June,
1860, when the exploring expedition under Messrs. Burke and
Wills was still in Melbourne. With the first day of the new
year, 1861, Mr. Stuart again started from Adelaide, with a
party of twelve men under his command, for the purpose of
actually reaching the sea-coast. And now the two expeditions
were in the field. Mr. Burke?s expedition had left Melbourne
in August, 1860; but Messrs. Burke and Wills did not start
from Cooper?s Creek on their journey to the Gulf of Carpen-
taria until December 14, just a fortnight before Mr. Stuart left
Chamber?s Creek. The two routes through Central Australia
are pretty parallel, the distance of Cooper?s Creek from Cham-
ber?s Creek, about 300 miles, being mainly adhered to. On
this occasion, Mr. Stuart found no difficulty in making good
his former route, and was able to advance nearly two degrees
beyond its extremity?his extreme northern point now being
lat. 17� O', long. 133� O'. The continuation of his former
route, also, opened some fine country wide grassy plains
? consisting of black alluvial soil from 16 ft. to 20 ft. deep,
4 and covered with luxuriant grasses, 4 feet and 5 feet 6
4 inches high,? chains of lakes, some of them 10 and 12 miles
long, abounding with fish, and lined along their banks with


troops of e pelicans, white cranes, ibises, and native com-
f panions? and, as Mr. Stuart confidently states, accessible
to cattle from Adelaide at all seasons of the year. This fine
country, however, towards the north was backed by belts of
dense scrub, and from it attempts were made, in no less than
fourteen different directions, to force a passage to the coast.
In June, 1861, the task was abandoned; while in February,
Messrs. Burke and Wills had actually visited the shores of the
Gulf of Carpentaria by a more easterly, and entirely indepen-
dent, route. With the few particulars of this route, found
among the rough notes and charts of Messrs. Burke and Wills,
the public are acquainted from the papers recently laid
before Parliament. Their solution of the last problem of
Australian Exploration is perfect. From the shores of Port
Phillip Bay to the shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria, they
laid down a direct and practicable route for their fellow-
colonists, and returned to their Depot on Cooper?s Creek ?to
find it abandoned. How bitter their disappointment?how-
protracted their sufferings?how nobly they died, when thus
forsaken in the desert, we may spare ourselves to recount.
When Australian settlement shall have spread into the interior,
and occupied the shores of the great Gulf, it will still be
remembered that Burke and Wills were the first to overcome
all obstacles, and to force a passage from shore to shore. Still
will be remembered the tribute paid to them by the Governor
of their colony*:??So fell two as gallant spirits as ever
e sacrificed life for the extension of science, or the cause of
f mankind. Both were in their prime; both resigned comfort
e and competency to embark in an enterprise by which they
* hoped to render their name glorious; both died without a mur-
? mur, evincing their loyalty and devotion to their country to
? the last.? To the representatives of Richard O?Hara Burke
the Royal Geographical Society has most deservedly awarded
its great Gold Medal perhaps the highest honour a scientific
b6dy can bestow.
