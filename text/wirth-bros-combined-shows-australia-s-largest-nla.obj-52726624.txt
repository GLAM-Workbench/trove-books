All other Shows have to bow before us. Ours is where toil lays down its burden with a laugh.
The Only Circus worth calling a Circus in Australia.
We have cheap would-be imitators, but not one Competitor.
Next year they will show you some very inferior copies of our Grand
Show of this Season.
Largest, Grandest and Best in Everything.
The Air is full of Wirths.
Fairy Playground for the Children.
Where Critics only say they see too much,
We present more than can be advertised.
We Everywhere exhibit Everything.
As Solid as the Bank of England, backed up with Talent, Energy,
Brains and Capital.
Erecting a whole City of illuminated Tents; the Biggest Spread of
Canvas ever erected.
Each day we secure some rare new features.
TRiliilM Sensations
THREE RING CIRCUS
Unprecedently superior
Acta and performances that
have never before been offered
to critical and discerning
audiences ; spreading a huger
cloud of Canvas, requiring
more Cars, Coaches, and Loco-
motives to move it; more Dens,
Lairs, and Cages for its ani-
mals, and more than twice
the number of per-
formers and working peo-
ple than any two shows on the
continent; in brief, a thorough
and perfect idealisation of
Canvas Exhibitions. All the
classical, exhilarating and ex-
citing effects of the Sports,
Pastimes, Chariot Races and
Gladiatorial Contests of the
Hippodromes of Ancient Rome
Revivified, rehabilitated and
reproduced, furnishing not
only .to the historian and
student, but even to the most
superficial observer, object
lessons that can never fail to
interest, amuse, and instruct.
THRILLING EPISODES OF THE WAR, and the Hurdle Races and Perilous Steeplechases of Merrie England Excitingly Produced.
