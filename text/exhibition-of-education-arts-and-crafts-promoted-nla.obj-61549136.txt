The Course of Study in Victorian Schools*
In order that visitors to the Exhibition of 1914 may be in a
position to better understand the nature of the work which
is shown in the various sections, the Committee of the A.N.A.
has asked for brief notes outlining the course of study in all
grades, together with some allusion to the exhibits shown in
each section, and the following articles, written in response to
that request, are here given for general information.
At the time of the State School Exhibition of 1906, educa-
tion in Victoria had just received a great awakening, and so
much interest had been aroused in connection with educational
progress that the Department of Education was much en-
couraged in its efforts to enlarge the scope of its work, and,
although the course of instruction in vogue at that time had
not been very long in our schools, it was felt that its aims
could be very greatly extended and improved.
Although much has been said from time to time with regard
to the intentions of the original framers of the Act of 1872, and
the assertion has been repeatedly made that the system was
never intended to be as extended and elaborate as it is, it can-
not be too often repeated that such assertions are absolutely
incorrect, and that the late Mr. Wilberforce Stephen, in in-
troducing the Act of 1872 in the House, distinctly stated that
while the course of education prescribed at that time was
necessarily but elementary, and suited to the requirements and
possibilities of the day, it would have to be improved and
added to from time to time, until a thorough system of educa-
tion worthy of the State should be evolved.


But even though the originators of the old Act had given no
such forecast of possible future alterations, it must be remem-
bered that all true education must be progressive if it is to be
worthy of the name, and the country or State that neglects to
endeavour to keep abreast of the progress made by others in
this matter will soon be hopelessly adrift, and will very rapidly
realise the baneful effects of failing to appreciate the ?far-
reaching possibilities of truly efficient national education.?
The remarks made by the Director of Education at the time
of the Exhibition of 1906 with regard to the extraordinary
activity in connection with popular education all over the world
apply with greatly intensified force at the present moment.
In his article on ??ldeals in Modern Education,? he stated
that the. changes experienced in all parts of the world were
?manifesting themselves in fundamental alterations of me
syllabus of instruction, in a growing demand for more health-
ful and efficient school environment, and in the great em-
phasis which was at that time laid upon the selection and
training of teachers.
In the period that has passed since that article was written
great advances have been made in connection with education
in Victoria, and great efforts put forth to reach some at least of
the ideals so clearly indicated as absolutely necessary.
It has been realised by the Press, by the people, by the
Department and by Parliament that the great cause of educa-
tion is one in which financial economy is fatal to success, and
honest efforts have been made to improve the positions of
the teachers so that they might be free to pursue their noble
calling with the knowledge that an appreciative public would
see that they were adequately remunerated for their work.
As far as the male teachers are concerned, much relief has
been given. The Junior Teachers (male and female) have
received careful consideration, their salaries increased, and
most commendable improvements have been made in the pro-
visions for their efficient training. Some of the lower paid


female teachers, too, have aJso received long-delayed in-
creases; but the fact still remains that the majority of the
female teachers are very greatly underpaid, although it has
to be admitted that but for them the work of our schools
could not be carried on.
The question of giving them salary commensurate with the
value of their services has again been raised in the present
session of Parliament, and it is to be hoped that the fact that
it will probably considerably increase the education vote will
not prevent their receiving justice.
The vast importance of education demands full recognition
by all, and so long as inadequate pay is given for the work of
teaching it will be impossible to obtain the very best work
from the teachers, or to attract the best people into the ranks
of the profession.
In the last Exhibition work was shown from every quarter
of Victoria, and the exhibits were so numerous that the Exe-
cutive Committee found it impossible to compile a catalogue
of them. On this occasion, although in number they are less,
in quality they are by no means inferior, and show con-
clusively that a vast amount of excellent work is carried out
by the teachers in every part of the State.
In addition to exhibits from the State, Primary and Techni-
cal Schools, and from the High Schools, there is a good display
from the Roman Catholic Primary Schools, from the Institu-
tion for the Blind, the Deaf and Dumb, and also from the
special schools established for teaching the mentally deficient,
and visitors to the Exhibition will be greatly interested in
seeing what has been done by children who cannot work under
normal conditions, but who nevertheless are bright examples
of what can be accomplished by teachers and pupils by the
exercise of patience and perseverance.

THE SCHOOL LIBRARY,
3iy Charles R. Long, M.A., Inspector of Schools, Education
Department, Victoria, and Editor of the Department?s
Publications, Chairman of the Library Sub-Committee
of the Exhibition Committee.
Victoria has not yet recognised, as some other countries
have done, that the public library in a town ought to be
related intimately to the educational institutions of the town.
Though few in the community seem to have this conception
of the function of our libraries, supported, though they are. to
a considerable extent by public funds, and, therefore, intended
surely to be definitely educational, the Education Department,
seeing that it should be so, has been doing something of late
years to bring about the desired state of things. For many
children in Victoria, the elementary school has been a blind
alley. They went to school and left school, and that was the
end of their education. Having started them. on the right
course, it is reasonable for the State to provide facilities for
them to continue their education. An important part of these
facilities consists in having properly equipped public libraries.
The teachers of the higher elementary school, the high school,
and the technical school should be able to take and to send
their pupils to the library of the town ?a library so planned,
so stocked, and so officered that the time spent there would
be profitably spent. If our young people resort to the library,
learn how to use and enjoy its contents, they will continue to
do so in after years to their own and the community?s great
advantage.
The beginning that the Department has made towards this
desirable state of things is to endeavour to give some ability
in using books of reference and to implant a taste for reading
by having a collection of books in the elementary school.
These results attained, the other will come in time. Let us
hope the time is not far distant. It does not require any
stretch of the imagination to suppose that, as the children
glide from school into active life, there will move with them
the sense of cultivation and refinement which the school
initiated and the public library continues.
The Department has been at pains to make it clear to
teachers that a library is an essential part of the equipment
-of a school, and that its existence and the evidence of its profit-
able use by the pupils are to be noted with approval by inspec-
tors.


By way of helping local effort, the Department supplies a
bookcase on receiving proof that �5 has been spent on library
books; and, to a school in membership with the Victorian
State Schools Decoration and Equipment Society (the fee for
joining which is small), a subsidy at the rate of �1 for �1 is
given for the purchase of a library. Further, the Society will
buy from teachers? lists, if approved, or the Society will make
a selection, if requested. The Victoria League of Victoria has
also assisted in the formation of libraries by sending, free of
cost, parcels of books to small schools where the raising of
funds locally is not easy. The result is that there are few
State elementary schools in Victoria without a collection of
books for library purposes.
Even though his library may be small, the teacher should
try to make it an intimate part of the life of the school. He
should, if possible, refer to it in his lessons, saying about some
doubtful point that has arisen, ?We must look that up in such
and such a book in the library,? and then take care that it is
looked up He should seek, by means of the collection of
books he has got together, to lead his pupils to enjoy good
literature, and to avoid the silly, vapid papers that assail them
on every hand. Children vary markedly in taste and in the rate
of its improvement; but few boys and girls will be inclined,
after having enjoyed healthy, interesting books, to revert to
an inferior kind; that is, if good reading matter is kept acces-
sible to them. Much in the earlier years may be fiction?good
fiction?tales capable of cultivating the imaginative faculties
of the child, the sense of dramatic joy, and the sense of honour
and justice.
Unfortunately, the accommodation in our school buildings
is so restricted that the books are generally shut up
in cupboards, situated in dark passages, or in particular class
rooms, inaccessible to the majority of pupils except for a few
minutes on a stated day once a week. There should be, in
every large school at least, a room set apart for, and sacred
to, the library.
The Department values highly the opportunity the holding
of this Exhibition gives for bringing under the notice of the
public the importance of the library in our system of education.
A committee, consisting of Miss E. Cassidy (assistant teacher,
Manningtree-road. Hawthorn), Mr. S. Summons, M.A., LL.B.
(ex-inspector of Schools), Mr. R. Tobin (ex-head teacher of
the Northcote School), Mr. C. O. Dentry (assistant teacher
of the Port Melbourne School), Mr. G. M. Wallace (sub-
editor of the Education Department?s Publications) (Secre-
tary), and the writer (Chairman), has been at work on what
seemed to them to be the most urgent need?the making of a
list to help teachers to select with ease and confidence books
for the lending library of the elementary school.


They have listed groups of books, each group worth about
T>/- at the catalogue prices, and divided it into three sections
-?one for the lower grades (5 years to 8 or 9), another for
the middle grades (8 or 9 years to n or 12), and the third for
the upper grades. These books; will be on view at the Exhibi-
tion, and the lists will be available.
It should be stated that the members of the Committee
intended to read every book before listing it, but lack of time
rendered that impossible. There is no space here to set out
the principles that guided them in making their selection, but,
at any rate, they had something in mind like the following
from?the pen of Professor Brandes?Dangerous books are
not only those which speculate in the reader's sensual im-
pulses, or appeal to his idleness or frivolity, but those also that
represent base and low things as admirable, or disseminate
prejudices, and throw a hateful light on liberal mindedness, or
the pursuit of freedom.?

OCCUPATIONS.
One of the most striking illustrations of the advances which
have been made in education during recent years is seen in the
introduction of handwork into both primary and secondary
schools Looked at bv teachers at first somewhat askance, its
usefulness and value, both educationally and practically, are so
obvious that it has been rapidly received into favour, and now
forms an essential and integral part of the curiiciilum or
schools, in practically every country in the civilised world.
This handwork usually takes the form of cookery and wood-
work for senior girls and boys respectively, and of occupations
in some more tractable material for the other pupils.
Sloyd woodwork was introduced into Victoria in 1901 by
Mr. John Byatt, an expert from London, and is now being
taught to about 12.000 boys in the three upper grades m 60
centres and 70 country schools in various parts of the State.
The course of instruction includes making the working
drawings.- and from them examples of all the models shown
in the exhibit, the pupils thereby gaming considerable ability
in making and reading drawings, and a good practical acquaint-
ance with some half a dozen timbers and all the ordinary tools
of a woodworker.
In addition to these practical advantages, many boys are
laving the foundation of a future hobby, and are learning to
be neat, accurate, orderly and methodical, qualities which will
stand them in good stead in whatever walk of life they may
afterwards tread.
sloyd woodwork is now one of the subjects of free instruc-
tion, and the department provides all the necessary tools and
timber.
The exhibit consists of four parts; ?
1. A working class of 20 boys.
2. Sets of the ordinary drawings and models.
3. A complete full-sized suite of furniture for a gentle-
man?s den made from Victorian woolly butt and mess-
mate timbers seasoned by the House patent process at
the Newport workshops; and


4- An Bft. dinghy, the ?Argo,? made by Zeus A. Merfield,
i- to the specifications of the Albert Park Boys? Dinghy
Club, which has won several prizes at the Club races.
All the models shown in the exhibit, including the furniture
and dinghy, are the work of boys from 12 to 14 years of age.
The furniture and dinghy, though they do not form a part of
the ordinary Sloyd course, have been included to show what
boys can do who have been through the course of training.
While it is generally agreed that woodwork is the best form
of handwork for the upper grades of boys, there is no similar
unanimity as to a single best form of work for other pupils,
consequently several are in use, probably with considerable
advantage. These include modelling in clay or plasticine,
raffia weaving, cardboard work, repousse work, wire work,
chip carving, stencilling; and for girls, needlework.
Examples of all these, showing the kind and quality of the
work done, may be found in the ?Occupations? and ?Needle-
work? Exhibits under the Dome. Visitors should also see the
working class in the Banqueting Hall.
In addition to the manual skill which is developed by the
various occupations, many of them widen the pupil?s acquaint-
ance with materials, tools and processes, and afford one of the
few opportunities he has to cultivate kis taste for form and
colour.
That the articles made are often useful in the home is only
an incidental advantage, as it is the ?doing? which is of value
from an educational point of view and not the ?thing? done.
The articles are merely a means to an end, and that end the
training of the child to become a good and useful citizen.

was kindly lent by John J. Rogers and Son, Little Collins-
street.

STATE SCHOOLS' NEEDLEWORK.
The exhibit in this subject is a very large one. the women.
teachers having responded most liberally. One hundred and
twenty schools have contributed, some of which are located
in far-away country districts, so that the exhibit is a represen-
tative one in every sense of the word. We are \eiy sorry that
time did not permit of all being advised as to the colours used
in preparing special work.
Many teachers have sent in work that was executed long
before the Exhibition was mooted, consequently a few of the
mounts may appear rather incongruous as regards colour.
How r ever, on the wdiole. the work has been very carefully pie-
pared, and is of very good quality, very little having been le-
jected. The whole of the mounted work has been arranged
in grades.
In the Preparatory, I. and 11. Grades, where the ages of the
children average six years, seven years and eight years re-
spectively, the amount shown is not so great as in the other
orades. This is owing to the fact that a separate Court is
o-iveu to all branches of Junior Work, where similar Needle-
work is shown. It will be noticed that the mounts representing
the Preparatory Grade consists of designs pricked out, and
worked with colored wools, to represent familiar objects or
to represent pictures of Nature, hairy and other stories which
have emanated from correlated subjects taught in these grades.
Grade I. consists of Canvas mats worked in coloured w r ools,
showing the various stitches used in Needlework throughout
the higher grades.
Grade II mounts do not lend themselves to artistic arrange-
ment. as turning down hems, tacking and hemming are the
requirements of the programme in this grade. In some cases
the square-hemmed handkerchief has been converted into a
fancy sachet; in other cases, where utility has been considered,
towels are shown hemmed and folded on some of the mounts.
So long as the Needlework came up to the standard the Com-
mittee felt in duty bound to mount these articles, though no
colour scheme could be worked out.
In Grade 111. (age 9 years) the pocket apron predominates,
and the hemming and top-sewing in most ofthese is excellent.
Knitting is begun in this grade, and consists ot squares ot
plain knitting converted in most cases into small kettle-holdei &
or dolls? bonnets, as seen the mounts.


Grade IV. (age to years). Many teachers have shown for
-this grade a pocket apron on a more elaborate scale than that
of Grade 111., while others have shown a workbag which is
more in keeping with the requirements of the programme. A
pair of knitted cuffs, and darning on huckaback, completes the
programme for this grade, which is well represented.
In Grade V. (age n years), various useful garments in calico
and other cotton fabrics are shown ; these have been cut out by
paper-folding.
Cuffs knitted with wool of two colours, so as to show neat
joinings, darning on stocking-web and flannel, and sewing on
of tapes all appear side by side on some of the mounts in this
grade.
Grade VI. (age 12 years). Here flannel garments, cut out
by paper folding, appear, showing all the stitches used in their
construction.
Some darns on stockings?specimens of knitting (heels,
toes and together with small socks and specimens of button-
holes) ?all very good indeed.
Grades VII. and VIII. (ages 13 and 14 years) furnish a very
dainty exhibit on the whole, most of the girls having elected
to make small frocks and pinafores, entailing much neat and
in some cases elaborate work. Others have sent in skirts,
blouses and elaborately trimmed under-garments, all tending
to make the exhibit a very interesting one. Bootees and
knitted socks appear in abundance in these grades, while some
very good darns and patches are seen on the mounts.
There is also a good exhibit in fancy designs on Canvas,
from the various grades, which are well worthy of notice.
Dolls dressed in garments cut out and made by the pupils
in higher grades lend a charm to the exhibit.
When it is seen that too mounts have been filled with plain
work, while the glass cases and stands are laden with more
delicate and fancy articles?all the production of girls whose
ages range from six to fourteen years?it will surely be ad-
mitted that pupils and teachers have done their part well.
It remains for the public to show their appreciation of these
efforts by not only visiting the Needlework Court, but by look-
ing carefully into the work that,,our Young Australian Girls
have accomplished under the guidance of their teachers in the
State Schools.

DOMESTIC SCIENCE.
Cookery.
Public and parental opinion is gradually giving intelligent
heed to the growth of a movement which promises, if wisely
controlled and intelligently fostered, to yield a har\est of rich
national results.
It would be interesting to many to deal with these questions
which are met and must be answered, namely
(i) Is it felt to be necessary for schools to provide an
increasing part of that education which used to be
more generally furnished by home life ?
(2) Is there a feeling that there is a danger of an actual
decline in household skill owing to the conditions of
modern city life or to the increasing of employment
of women in houses of business?
(3) Is it felt that the school should attempt to arrest this
decline ?
(4) Are people at all concerned by any observed or sus-
pected tendency in primary education as now or-
ganised to make girls wish to be clerks, typists or shop
assistants, etc., rather than housekeepers, home
workers or helps?
The changing social conditions which demand reairange-
ment of former expenditure of time and energy aie lecognised
as a factor in the evident need to secure for young people in
schools that which in a previous state of society permitted to-
be gained in the home.
That the integrity and dignity of home life must be main-
tained as a coefficient of national prosperity is widely accepted;
that this conception is now reaching the 'many seems evident
from the great increase of attention devoted to the whole
question lately. I should place as the most powerful motive,,
held perhaps unconsciously, but nevertheless tenaciously by
the majority, the lust of progress. This determination leads
a people, instinctively interested in cause and effect, to ob-
serve wherein lies their weakness and in what direction ma}
be found their strength.
The stress and strain of professional and commercial life
soon test the vigour of the physical as well as of the mental
conditions of those subjected to it, and these turn the
thoughts to the essentials of physical well-being.

The expression given to their views by representatives
among these different classes have exerted an influence on
public opinion which causes it now to almost demand that
schools shall provide for children such training in citizenship
and home making as shall raise up a strong race of well-
nurtured people, skilled not alone in the right conduct of
their own lives, but impatient of the existence of any condi-
tions unfavourable to the health of the community. Among
these conditions would rank decline in household skill and a
weakening of the maternal instincts, both, when apparent,
being traceable results of the increasing employment of women
outside their homes; the false sense of shame associated with
domestic service; impatience of the so-called uneventful life
of the young mother engaged in household and family cares,
are prevalent. Determined efforts are now being made to
combat these erroneous sentiments, and are directed to en-
hance the dignity of household service, to point out the beauty
and intense responsibility of motherhood, and to encourage
all women to consider that their education is incomplete unless
thev are practically acquainted with household management.
In the Banqueting Hall at the N.W. corner of the Exhibi-
tion any afternoon during the Exhibition (excepting Satur-
days) the public may visit and spend much profitable time in
a very busy scene. Some of the girls from the 7th and Bth
Grades (who have received training in cookery some time
during 1913) from the urban and suburban schools are pre-
paring cooking, dishing and serving a three-course dinner for
70 people, also showdng invalid breakfast and tea dishes. This
scene is a replica of the ordinary Cookery Centre (and there
are now over sixty such scattered all over Victoria), and
shows practically what is being done in our High. Higher Ele-
mentary and Elementary Schools.
The room has been so arranged that each girl is pro-
vided with a kitchen table, also drawer and cupboard. In
each drawer and cupboard she has small kit. such as rolling-
pin, three knives, one fork, and three spoons, a skewer or
cookery needle, a paste-board and chopping-board, a plate,
three basins (graded), and a mug. The ?kit? is limited,
and children are taught to manage in the practice without
making a big wash-up when her cookery is finished. Every-
thing is given to her bright and clean, and after her practice
she is held responsible for her kit, and is taught best methods
of cleaning, to enable her to leave things as clean and bright
as before.
In many centres we use the wood .stoves, others gas, others
oil, and others the electric stove, and children are given an
all-round knowledge of management of heat of oven. Every

apart from these, if the child is taught to manage any one me-

as the temperature is the guide forthebest method of cooking

HISTORY,
The place of history in education has been much discussed,
and though there is great difference of opinion about the
matter, all educationalists agree upon the point that history
has a place in education. There is considerable diversity
about what are the right methods of teaching history, but
it is generally agreed that history should be taught. Conse-
quently, in an exhibition of school work, it is to be expected
that history will be represented ; but there will be consider-
able diversity in the character of the exhibits. In the teach-
ing of history there cannot be such appeals to the senses as
in the teaching of such subjects as reading and arithmetic,
though the senses are appealed to by means of pictures,
historical relics, and objects of that kind. These, however,
are used as illustrations to define more clearly viva voce de-
scriptions. In the actual teaching of history, therefore, viva
voce methods are all-important. It is the teacher who is the
vivid picturesque story teller, and word painter, whp has
the first call upon the interest of the scholars. But history
is not merely story telling. It is something more than that.
History does not only tell the story of the past; it aims at
explaining the present by the past. There are present with
us to-day conditions and institutions: How did they arise."
The skilful teacher will pay great attention to this phase of
history, and he will be able to arrest and hold the interest
of his scholars in dealing' with it. But even in this respect
the subject makes great demands upon viva voce powers,
and is more a mental exercise than ever. Hence the excellence
of teaching methods in history must not be judged by the
number of exhibits. One skilful teacher, with a piece of
chalk and a blackboard, will do far more in making history
lessons bright, interesting and effective, than a score of
mediocre ones can effect with the use of pictures, diagrams,
elaborate plans and historical relics.
Yet these latter have a distinct and valuable place in the
teaching of history, and the skilful teacher will not be con-
tent with his piece of chalk and blackboard, when he can
secure more finished and accurate illustrations to assist him in
giving correct impressions. The scholars, too, will be en-
couraged to give definiteness to their own impressions, by
making pictures, diagrams and plans in connection with their
history lessons. Hence, though the worth of our history
teaching must not be estimated by the character of the
exhibits, yet the exhibits will give -a good general indication
of the lines upon which the subject is being taught, and among

the exhibits will be found the aids the teachers employ, and
the exercises asked from the pupils, to secure clearness and
definiteness of impression in regard to the history lessons.
One of the most difficult conceptions to obtain in the minds
of scholars is that of duration of time. To the child a month
is as a year to adults, and a year is as an age. Even the
older scholars find it difficult to grasp the idea of a century,
and proportional difficulty with longer periods. Our history
text-books give the history of the past in different style.
Some aim at an interesting, picturesque narrative, without
much regard for chronological sequence, others attempt a
record of events in strict order of time. There is something
to be said for both methods, but it is very desirable indeed
that the plastic memories of children should be made use of
to obtain a correct sequence of important historical events
and dates. Among the exhibits, therefore, in our History
Court, will be. found many time lines of different kinds, and
connected with different periods. Some of these time lines
are very ingenious, and very instructive. Even in mechanical
contrivance there is much to commend, while considerable
thought and device has been expended in making these aids
clear, distinct and interesting.
To secure accurate ideas as regards the conditions in the
past, it is necessary for the children to understand the state
of the country under consideration, to have an idea of the
material progress that has been made, to know about the
social and industrial circumstances. For example, feudal
conditions must be explained and illustrated- Hence pictures,
diagrams and models, to portray these feudal times, will be
used, and our history court shows exhibits of this sort. There
is a Norman castle, with its keep, its walls, its moat, its
drawbridge, and its portcullis. This is the work of boys who
have had a sloyd training, and who wished to materialise in
their conceptions of a feudal home. There are
pictures of knights and pilgrims, some the work of the
teacher, for illustrative purposes, and some the work of
scholars, to show that descriptions by the teachers have been
realised. There are also bright, highly-coloured sketches by
young pupils, illustrating the eventful careers of favourite
heroes and heroines. Bruce and guardian demon, the Spider,
Joan of Arc, an anatomical marvel on an equally marvellously
designed warhorse, Boadicea, and a host of others. This
defining of the children?s ideas in coloured crayons is surely
an exceedingly valuable exercise.
Then, too, there are compositions and essays in great num-
bers. It must not be expected that these essays wall show'
profound historical knowledge and great literary, ability.

1 he}' are the work of children, making their way through
the mists of ignorance and inexperience towards clearer con-
ceptions of conditions and circumstances altogether different
from those with which they are acquainted.
It would not be expedient or profitable to try to enumerate
all the different kinds of work displayed, and all the many
illustrative aids exhibited. They are in the History Court, to-
be seen and studied. The pictures, however, deserve special
attention. 1 here has been a decided advance in the quality of
the historical pictures for illustrating lessons, and our Vic-
torian teachers have not been slow to discriminate between
the good and the inferior. In our schools many very fine
pictures are now to be found?pictures illustrating both* Eng-
lish and Australian historical events. A careful inspection of
these pictures will show that money is not being grudged
in providing for the children?s artistic enjoyment, as well as
for their historical information.
But behind all the exhibits it is necessary that the visitor
to the exhibition should try to visualise for himself the
earnest, skilful teacher, with an attentive, interested class,
the teacher, by vivid word-painting, outlining a picture of a
critical epoch in history, by definite stimulating, questioning,
invigorating the mental condition of each pupil, and then using
his illustrative material, be it rough blackboard work or more
finished artistic illustrations, to impress clearly and distinctly
upon the child a memorable view of the event he is dealing
with. For, after all, it is the teacher himself that can be the
only effective comment upon the exhibits of this history sec-
tion.
In order to give visitors to the Court an idea of the history
treated, it will be necessary to state that the children in our
schools begin in almost the lowest grades to have stories about
great historical characters of all countries and periods. It is
hoped that the telling to them of these stories will beget in
them appreciation of noble qualities, and a patriotic love of
Australia. In the next higher grades they begin to take
stories of English and Australian history, but without any
definite attention to chronology or sequence. The highest
grades deal with English and Australian history in more detail,
and combined with the teaching of history is the teaching of
civics. In the treatment of civics the aim is to give the
scholars a view of the duties of a citizen, and a knowledge of
the great political and civil institutions of the country. The
history lessons illustrate or enforce the teaching of civics, and
great examples of patriotism receive special attention. Alto-
gether. the aim is to make the teaching of history and civics,
result in the building up of a finer type of Australian citizen.


MATHEMATICS.
The very line display in the section devoted to mathematics
must be most gratifying to those who guide the destinies of
our schools. Such a display should effectively dispel any mis-
givings concerning the quality of the teaching of this subject.
Once again have the teachers of our State demonstrated their
ability to keep abreast of progressive developments. It is
little over a year since a new course of study, involving many
radical changes, was issued by the Education Department, yet
already, in mathematics, as in every other subject, teachers
have shown themselves ready to interpret this course in the
broadest spirit, and quick to seize upon what is best in it. and
turn it to good advantage.
Perhaps the most far-reaching of modern developments in
the teaching of mathematics lies in the greater insistence upon
maintaining a close and constant connection between arith-
metical calculations and the problems of everyday life. At
every turn one is struck by the spirit of reality and of utility
that pervades the arithmetical teaching of to-day. The old,
weird problems in compound proportion or stocks and shares
that presented to wondering pupils a most impossible set of
conditions, that were rooted in nothing that gave solid ground
for youthful reason to operate from, have been replaced by
exercises drawn from daily needs and daily experiences.
Many of the exhibits give evidence of the power pupils are
gaining to apply the rules and principles of mathematics to
material drawn from the environment they know and under-
stand. The operations of farm, dairy, orchard and factory are
levied upon for a supply of suitable examples. Business trans-
actions of every kind are freely and finely illustrated. Many
-of the weekly or monthly accounts, balance-sheets, household
accounts, etc., are models of neatness and accuracy. Senior
pupils, too, show considerable skill in drawing upon the com-
mercial columns of the daily papers for arithmetical raw mate-
rial. Another feature of the modern teaching that is brought
out by a survey of the exhibits is the free and skilful use
made of practical illustrations of rules and processes. Some
of the experimental methods of proof are highly ingenious and
most instructive. The reflective adult who keeps his eyes and
his mind open as he wanders through the Court, will find
everywhere visible and tangible proofs of processes which, in


his own school experience, he was compelled to accept orr
trust. The rules of mensuration have been stripped of the veil
of mystery which enshadowed them from our youthful gaze..
Measuring and weighing, the plotting of graphs, the method
of superposition?all these and other devices have been called
in to aid the present-day embryonic Newtons and Leibnitzes.
The thorny path of fractions and decimals has been dotted so-
plentifully with practical devices for illustration that precoci-
ous mathematicians of seven and eight years tread it in full
confidence. Older pupils negotiate without difficulty problems
based upon concentric circles, prismoidal forms (haystacks,
troughs, etc.), and irregular rectilineal figures, because teachers
have learned more and more to employ experimental and
practical methods.
Another reassuring feature of the exhibits is the fine display
of work done in algebra and geometry. These are compara-
tively new subjects in our elementary schools. If the nature
of the work shown, and the excellence of its execution can
be accepted as criteria, then it is safe to prophesy that these
branches of mathematics have come to stay. Taught by right
methods, geometry is a most valuable auxiliary of arithmetic;
indeed, mensuration cannot be soundly taught apart from a
knowledge of elementary geometry. Teachers, too, have not
been long in finding out that algebra is not by any means a
new subject, but merely a kind of generalised arithmetic, and
that the power to use algebraic methods of solution, particu-
larly the method of equations, gives pupils a most effective
weapon in dealing with problems in arithmetic.
Taken altogether, the display in mathematics is highly credit-
able, and. better still, promises well for the future. It makes
quite clear that our present-day syllabuses and methods are
justifying themselves in their results, that modern arithmetic
is much more interesting and more understandable than the
arithmetic it replaced, that a finer all-round training is secured
by bringing the hand and eye to minister to the intellect, and
that nothing but good has resulted from the emphasis now laid
upon bringing the work of the school into closer touch with
the activities outside its walls.
Much has been said and written of late about the inferior
attainments of our pupils in arithmetic as compared with those
of pupils of a decade ago. There is nothing, however, in this
exhibition to indicate that these pessimistic utterances have
any basis in fact, while there is very much to prove that never
before in the history of our schools has the teaching of mathe-
matics been so soundlv and broadlv based.

SCHOOL PUBLICATIONS.
By CHARLES R. LONG, ALA., Inspector of Schools, and
Editor of the Department?s Publications.
The course of study prescribed for the elementary schools
of Victoria is comprehensive ?an essential, in this era of uni-
versal education and complex civilisation, if an adequate foun-
dation is to be laid for subsequent courses of instruction and
training. The work set out for the period extending from the
time the pupil is four and a-half years of age till he is fourteen
is intended not only to serve in developing mind and body,
but also in being as useful as possible by way of a preparation
for future requirements, and for the earning of a livelihood.
There is scope in it for connecting home interests and school
interests, and for practical applications that will impart reality
to the words of the book.
Xo secure these desirable ends, to teach the course of stud}
with confidence and intelligence, is no light contract for the
teacher, however well he may have been trained; and this the
administrators of our educational system cleailv perceixed
'when they issued the prescriptions. Of late years, therefore,
much has been done, both by word of mouth and by means ot
the printed page, to help the teacher to supplement his know-
ledge, give his work its proper direction, show him \\ hat to
teach and how to teach, and enable him to secuie the maxi-
mum result from his efforts.
The printed matter of local production that is now used m
our elementary schools is a noteworthy feature of our system
of education, and, we believe, it cannot be paralleled in an}
part of Greater Britain. The imported book, except m tne
school library and in the teachers' library, is conspicuous by
its absence; but the book written and printed in the State to
suit the needs of the pupils in working through the course of
study is in evidence everywhere, and enables progress to be
made, and results to be obtained that would otherwise be im-
possible.
First in importance is THE SCHOOL PAPER (insti-
tuted by Sir Alexander Peacock, when Minister of Public
Instruction, in 1896)? a monthly magazine m three numbers,
o-raduated as to difficulty in ideas and language to suit the
developing powers of its young readers. It forms the mam


supply of subject-matter for the teaching of reading, and the
imparting of general knowledge. The children work up to its.
simplest number through THE VICTORIAN PRIMER
and THE VICTORIAN FIRST BOOK. They write in
THE AUSTRALIAN COPY-BOOK. On the teacher?s desk
lies the' file of THE EDUCATION GAZETTE AND
TEACHER?S AlD?the Department?s monthly circular of
announcements, instructions, guidance, notices and news ?
each number usually 32 pages of small print. The teacher
will prepare some of his lessons from its pages, but may also
turn to his CIRCULARS OF INFORMATION (nearly a
score in number), for information and guidance.
In addition to these and other publications printed at the
Government Printing Office for the Education Department,
there are books, issued by Victorian publishers, and written
by men and women who have made a special study of some
subject of the curriculum, or some phase of educational work,
and whose productions have 'met with the confidence of the
teachers, and the approval of the administrative officers.
Among such books are the following:?Fl�ST STEPS AT
SCHOOL. THE FEDERAL PRIMER. THE FEDERAL

each year. They represent literary, artistic, and typographi-
cal effort, carried out by local firms, under the supervision of
the Education Department.
Who can adequately assess the good effected by the stimu-
lus given to book production in Victoria during the last few
years by the policy of encouraging local effort that has been
pursued by the Minister of Public Instruction?

Cleanliness in Ice Cream Manufacture
Cleanliness is a prime factor in the manufacture of any
food. It is necessary to purity, and especially to desirability.
It is a known fact that Milk and Cream absorb impurities
very rapidly, and for that reason it is of unusual importance
that the laws of modern sanitation be strictly observed in the
manufacture of a commodity made from these products.
In the making of I.X.L. ICE CREAM no pains or care
is spared to make the product perfect. Every utensil with
which the Cream comes in contact is thoroughly scoured
and steamed each time it is used'. The freezing is done by
electricity, and neither the Ice Cream itself, nor the material
out of which it is made, comes in contact with anything ex-
cept sterilized steel utensils and clean white enamel.
The result of such methods is a pure and healthful pro-
duct, which does not contain the semblance of a germ, or
impurity of any kind.

HORTICULTURE
MR. C. E. ISAAC.
1 he value of the school garden in brightening school sur-
roundings, and making school life more attractive, is so
obvious that very little comment on this phase of the subject
is needed.
The Education Department has for a considerable number
of years recognised the value of the school'garden as an edu-
cational factor, and it is now quite exceptional to find a State
School without, at least, some attempt at a garden.
Many causes have contributed to the spread of the move-
ment. Certificates have been awarded by the Department, on
the recommendation of the District Inspectors, to schools
which have exceptionally fine gardens, and the stimulus given
by the Australian Natives Association in annually awarding
a magnificent framed picture for the best improved school
ground in each inspectorate has been very great indeed. The
greatest credit, however, should be given to the teachers them-
selves, as it has been only through the sacrifice of a great
deal of time, and the expenditure of a great deal of labour
and, in many cases, money as well?on the part of the teachers
that the school gardening movement has reached its present
state in Victoria.
Some idea of the thought and labour given to making the
school grounds attractive may be gained from the plans and
photographs exhibited.
It is unfortunate that this first public exhibition of the gar-
dening work done at schools should occur at what is pro-
bably the worst time of the year from the horticultural point
of view. Even under favourable conditions flowers are some-
what scarce at the present time, but when it is considered
that most school gardens have only the natural rainfall to
depend on, and that a vacation of five weeks, in the hottest
part of summer, has just ended, it is somewhat surprising that
any flowers are obtainable at all.
A considerable portion of the exhibit in flowers comes from
the seed-raising plots at the nursery of the Victorian State
Schools Horticultural Society.


This Society was formed a little over three years ago, with
the object of assisting teachers in forming and improving
school gardens, and so spreading a love of gardening amongst
the children of the State. Any school may become a member
of the Society on payment of the annual subscription fee (two
shillings and sixpence), and is then entitled to participate in
the free distributions of seeds and plants which take place at
various times during the year. Last year the membership of
the Society numbered over seven hundred separate schools,
and it is expected that it will reach one thousand schools
during the present year.
Although somewhat hampered by lack of funds, a great deal
of help has already been given to teachers by the Society.
Over 30,000 packets of seeds and 100.000 seedlings, as well
as many thousands of rooted roses, chrysanthemums, etc.,
have been distributed free to the schools. This has been ren-
dered possible by the great amount of voluntary assistance
given by members, especially in the matter of saving seeds
from choice plants, in established gardens, and sending them
into the central office for free distribution.
Curators of public gardens, both in the metropolis and in
country towns, have also given great assistance by the gift of
valuable plants for distribution to the schools.
While giving every encouragement to the movement, the
Education Department has not, up to the present, given any
direct financial assistance; but the present Minister for Public
Instruction (the Hon. Sir Alexander Peacock), was so im-
pressed with the magnitude and value of the work the Society
is doing, when it was brought under his notice, that he pro-
mised to do everything in his power to assist it. and it is ex-
pected that a Government grant, on a pound for pound basis,

AGRICULTURE
MR. C. E. KIRMSOE.
In over 700 Victorian rural elementary, .schools Elementary
Agriculture is the science which: is. being:.taught. Probabty
nothing is of more importance to the development of the State,
and therefore of greater general interest,; than the agricultural
possibilities of the various districts, and the, .work shown at
this exhibition brings out the fact that the schools are taking
their place in this field. ??vfec ; 'o''
The Education Department supplies seed (a good choice
of varieties) and manures, and the various firms dealing in
seeds and artificial manures have given valuable assistance.
The scientific attitude is brought to bear on the subject,
and reasons are sought for the selection of the crop sown, for
the methods of cultivation, for success, for failure; and the
possibilities of improving a yield, and accordingly the profits,
must be investigated. Investigation leads to experiment,
and in this branch the various grades seek to build up a store
of definite knowledge, which is of agricultural value, as well
as the means of excellent training for their powers of observa-
tion and thought. Practical operations are not neglected, and
in many rural schools the manual work lies in this direction.
The beginning of this subject is made in the lower grades
in the Nature Study work, where observation and simple infer-
ence are of great importance; accordingly much of the experi-
mental material in this section at the exhibition should be
looked at in relation to the later agricultural teaching, where
special conditions are imposed in an experiment, and the re-
sults carefully recorded.
The experimental material shown illustrates two sections ?
the indoor and the field work?and it is of special importance
that the facts brought out in the indoor work should be applied
to the field experiments. Apparatus, with descriptions, is
shown, illustrating the various facts connected with soil,
physics?e.g., the mechanical analysis of soil, capillarity, varia-
tion in soil temperature, etc., etc.


Field samples in various crops are shown, and interesting-
results observed from the experiments carried out; these em-
brace the results of irrigation, green manuring, artificial manur-
ing, drainage, rotation, test of a number of varieties, to ascer-
tain which most suitable for the district, etc.
On the mounts are also shown charts, descriptions of experi-
ments, of processes in cultivation, of pests and remedies, of
friends of the farmer, and, where possible, these will be seen
illustrated by diagrams or actual specimens.
Milk-testing is done in various schools, and in the exhibition
is illustrated by charts and apparatus.
Samples of seed are shown, and the value of seed selection
duly appreciated as a factor in agricultural success.
1 he cultivation of vegetables is undertaken by many schools,
and specimens are exhibited from various parts of the State.
The big part played by the pupils is noticeable right through
this Court, and records and notebooks show how the results of
experiments are preserved.
If from the elementary schools? exhibit a journey be made
to the Court of the Agricultural High Schools, the further
development of principles and processes is observed, and the
beginnings in this subject appreciated at their true value.


PHYSICAL TRAINING.
J. H. BETHERAS, M.A.
On ist July, 1911, the Commonwealth regulations and in-
structions for universal training, under the Defence Act, 1903-
1910, came into full operation. Among other considerations,
-all boys from 12 years to 14 years of age were liable to com-
mence a military training and to serve as Junior Cadets. The
intention was to provide the boys with a really sound bodily
training. The training was to include:?(a) A daily practice
in physical exercises. (b) Marching drill, and one or more
of the following;?(c) Miniature rifle shooting, (d) Swim-
ming. (e) Organised games. .(f) First aid. (g) Mariners?
compass and signalling exercises (for certain ' coast town
schools).
This adoption by the Commonwealth of the principle of
universal training brought a further responsibility to the head
teachers of the schools?the responsibility of providing the
prescribed training for the Junior Cadets attending schools.
As a new programme of instruction was at the time under the con-
sideration of the officials of the Education Department of Victoria,
it was thought advisable by them to recast the whole scheme of
physical .training, and bring it up to date in objective and
procedure for all the grades in the school,' and into line -with
the requirements of the Defence Department, so far as the
Cadets were concerned. ? The Syllabus of Physical Exercises
for Public Elementary Schools.? published by the London
Board of Education, was accepted as the text-book. The
series and the graded tables of exercises are admirably suited
to the needs of Victorian scholars; the exercises are com-
menced in the child?s first year at school, and are carried on
by progressive stages, thus making a systematic whole-school
course.
Swimming, already a well-ordered and popular part of the
training in many schools, was retained. Other subjects intro-
duced for the first time into the programme were first aid and
-organised games. Miniature rifle shooting was to be taught
where there were school rifle ranges; rifle matches for tro-
phies were arranged for competition every November. In
?certain seaport schools, some special instruction was to be
given to prepare boys as Naval Cadets. The military drill
was restricted to squad drill. The fine organisation of Cadets

that had obtained for many years in Victoria was given up, with
much regret, by the teacher-officers, who had been so enthusi-
astic in its worth and progress. It was found, however, that
there was something in the new exercises that captivated
teachers and scholars; the practice was varied, and the physi-
cal improvement was real. In bringing the new system into
operation, the first step was to reach the teachers easily and
effectively, and to induce their good-will and co-operation. It
was clearlv seen that, if satisfactory results were to be ob-
tained. the training of the children must be directed and
supervised by properly qualified and interested instructors.
The Defence Department provided three instructors, who con-
ducted schools of instruction for the male teachers. These
schools were carried on in Melbourne. Ballarat. Geelong, Ben-
digo. Castlemaine and Maryborough. A camp summer school
of physical training was held at Geelong, where 150 men re-
ceived an excellent training for three weeks under the De-
fence Department staff. At the same time, in Geelong, there
was a summer school for women teachers; the number en-
rolled was no; Miss Gertrude Anderson was in charge.
The Education Department has been successful in the efforts
to provide the best available training for the teachers, and so
in town and country the scholars are now under competent
instructors, for the most part certificated as such by the De-
fence Department. The District Inspectors, too, have had a
thorough course of training under the direction of Major
Alderson. the chief instructor of physical training.
The importance of the physical training of children is
commonly understood. It is not an extra; it is not a little
pleasurable recreation at change of lessons; it is not just a
marching up and down; it is an essential part of education,
A sound body, in addition to being an important objective in
itself, will certainly have great influence in the development of
the mental and moral faculties. Physiologists tell us of the
interdependence of the physical and mental powers. And
control of the body will help to control of the will. Make a
boy proud of his body, and he will respect it, care for it,
honour it?no mean result in any scheme of education.
A daily practice for fifteen minutes in formal physical exer-
cises is given to all pupils in the State schools. The whole
time set for all the subjects of physical training is about two
hours a week. The objective is to secure a healthy physique.
The training does not include rod or dumb-bell exercises;
it does not necessarily lead to extraordinary muscular develop-
ment and feats of strength; it is but little concerned with
spectacular, calisthenic displays; if is not a competition by


teams. It is a real endeavour to provide for the proper physi-
cal development of the individual scholar, and of every scholar
who is not exempted by reason of infirmity. The instruction
is directed to the need of the pupil rather than of the class, and
watchful care is taken to prevent strain or undue fatigue. In
a memorandum published by the London Board of Education,
the general purpose of the system is thus explained:?
?i. The system is intended (a) to aid in building up a
sound constitution, thus securing health, and the
power of endurance; and (b) to give a high degree
of bodily control, and hence efficiency and economy
of eflfort.
?2. The exercises are chosen for their effects, and are
given a definite form in order that these effects may
be capable of control by the teacher.
?3. Ihe exercises may be arranged in a carefully gradu-
ated progression.
?4. The exercises are arranged in the lesson on a rea-
soned plan.
It is the policy of the Education Department to have the
girls taught by the women teachers, and to this end Miss
Gertrude Anderson has been appointed by the Minister of
Public Instruction to superintend the training of women
teachers.
I he whole course of bodily training is. being as carefully
considered and carried out as are the arrangements for mental
-culture.
The illusti ations in the exhibition show the teachers in their
training classes, and also some of our best scholars at practice.
It is easily seen that the physical well-being of the children
is already much improved, the erect and graceful carriage of
tne head and body, the more capacious chest, the square and
even shoulders, the straight back are becoming more common
with the scholars. Inspectors, teachers and onlookers are
saying how quickly the new physical training is correcting the .&?
bad habits of stooping, slouching and careless gait.
The good result that has been obtained is mainly due to the '%
teachers, who have displayed a sound commonsense in the
choice ot exercises, and have imparted into their part of their
duty a splendid enthusiasm. I here is a realitv in it that
leaches the scholar ? and touches him, body and soul.

PHYSICAL SCIENCE
J. T. SAXTON, M.A.
Physical Science has now for some years been recognised
as an indispensable part of the programme of study in State
Elementary Schools. This is by no means a matter for sur-
prise, when one considers the potent influence of Natural
Science in the progress and welfare of humanity, it is univer-
sally recognised that an educational policy would be indeed
short-sighted which would deprive the rising generation early
in its career of a knowledge and an interest in the epoch-mak-
ing discoveries of such masters as Archimedes, Galileo, New-
ton, Fayaday, Pasteur, and the rest. It is not by any means
assumed that the child of the elementary school should have
a knowledge of a host of facts. The important thing for him
is not the fact itself at all. but the training in observation
and reasoning which he undergoes in his attempts to reach the
fact. The essential thing is that the child must himself be
a seeker and a doer, that the world of nature, or, rather, a
very limited portion of it. must be investigated by him, with
the teacher as his guide, and as his guide only. His results
are in many respects inaccurate, but they are quite as accurate
as his immaturity will allow.
In fostering this concentration of attention on the apparently
salient features of natural phenomena, and in bringing physi-
cal processes under control, so that they may be more exactly
observed, the study of Practical Physics is of special benefit.
Its fundamental truths are so capable of exact demonstration,
and manipulative skill is so much in evidence in the adjusting
of apparatus, that pari passu with the development of his rea-
soning faculties there is' an awakening of the inventive and
constructive impulses, which are so necessary in these days of
the rapid inarch of scientific procedure and its applications to
industry. The exhibition of aids will convey to the public
only a faint idea of the character of the work done in this
subject in our schools. It will indicate in the main the
breadth of the programme, and the great variety of choice left
to the teacher. The mounted drawings, with their marginal
notes, are typical of the careful notebook records made by
pupils, of their experiments, and the apparatus concerned. Air
pressure, with the barometer syphon pump; heat, and its
effects on solids, liquids, gases; mechanical powers, such as


the lever, wheel and axle, pulley, inclined plane, are among
the subjects in which interest is aroused, and of which explana-
tions are gained through practical experiments, carried on by
the pupils. An important part of the new* programme in
Science is the stress which has been laid on the practical
applications of principles to industry, and generally to the
life around the school. The main thing is first to secure the
child's interest in, say, a pump, a steam engine, a refrigerator,
an aeroplane, and then, by suitable experiments, satisfy the
cravings for explanation which have necessarily been aroused
in him. It is, of course, impossible to secure an adequate
idea of the true value of Science work in schools without a
careful inspection of the students at actual work. Charts and
exhibits of apparatus truly indicate what has been reached in
ability to record results of observation, but they cannot in
any degree give an adequate idea of the ability to make obser-
vations, or of the attitudes of interest in constructive work,
and in explanations of principles, which have been inculcated.

ENGLISH.
WILLIAM HENDERSON, B.A.
In primary schools of \ ictoria, English embraces reading,
including memorising of prose and poetry, spelling, writing,
grammar, and composition. It will be seen that the treatment
deals with the practical, intellectual and ethical sides of the
subject, and aims at putting the young pupil in a position
from which he can think and act with some measure of inde-
pendence.
Analysis deals with sentence-value, and towards this end
charts have been arranged, showing the development of the
subject from sentences, simple in structure, up to examples of
compound and complex arrangement, dhis part of the suo-
ject receives much prominence in primary schools, and the
pupil is introduced to sentence-value at an early age.
Parsing deals with phrase-value; but the purely logical
treatment of this phase of English does not lend itself readilv
to chart illustrations. The value of the training can best be
realised through contact of teacher with class. Notwith-
standing this drawback, teachers have prepared typical lessons
to indicate the direction of the instruction. Word-value is
best approached through derivations, and charts of various
kinds have been prepared to show the part that graphic illus-
tration takes in fixing language rules upon the minds of
young pupils.
Phonics deals with letter-value, and this branch of the
programme has, in recent \'ears, received close and vigoi-
OUS treatment. The illustrations are purely diagrammatic, but
they tend to show what is being done to obtain pure and
correct sounds amongst our children.
It is not the purpose of this outline to discuss methods of
teaching English, but merely to indicate the content of the


subject in primary school life ; but one may be pardoned for-
drawing - attention to the small diagram which indicates-
roughly the time devoted to the intellectual and the mechani-
cal sides of reading. Each section represents a grade, and
the area of each section may be regarded as the length of
time devoted to each side. It should be noticed that as the
child advances in grade, the intellectual side is strongly
stressed.
This exhibition is designed to illustrate the attempts, the
machinery and the results of pupils and teachers in the treat-
ment of English.
In the Court will be seen specimens of penmanship and com-
position done by pupils arranged according to grades, the
Committee believing that this arrangement will indicate most
effectively to the public the development of the child mind
thiough the primary school order. Amongst the compositions
prominence has been given to both description and imagina-
tion.
For those who take an academic interest in the exhibition,
charts, showing typical lessons jn the different parts of Eng-
lish, have been carefully prepared.


Technical Education in Victoria.
The aim of those connected with Technical Education is to
encourage our boys and girls to enter upon some branch of
technical work, and to provide a suitable preparatory training
for such work. Two years ago the Education. Department took
over the preparatory technical school which had been estab-
lished at the Working Men?s College, and altered the name to
the Melbourne Junior Technical School. The work carried on
there attracted much attention, and since it was evident that
the boys who attended the classes were receiving a training
for their future work, as well as preparation for higher techni-
cal school workj schools of a similar type were established at
Ballarat. Bendigo, Geelong, Collingwood, Sunshine and the
Swinburne Technical College.
The curriculum of these schools is uniform for all schools
during the first year. It includes the ordinary educational
subjects, but stress is laid on mathematics, drawing, an
simple forms of manual work, illustrative of drawing. During
the second year there are compulsory subjects, such as Eng-
lish, mathematics and drawing; but the practical work is on
lines suitable for each boy?s future occupation.
The Higher Technical Schools have in the past worked out
their own destiny. Each school endeavoured to develop on
lines most suitable for the students. The Working Men?s
College, being for many years the only technical school in the
metropolitan district, undertook and developed a large number
of branches of science, art, and trade work. It was the only
place where a Melbourne workman could obtain a full train-
ing in the subjects fundamental to his trade, and the only place
where he could gain practical instruction outside the work-
shop. The College is open day and evening, but the majority
of the students attend in the evening, and the exhibits shown
are the handiwork of the evening students.
The Swinburne Technical College has developed mainly on
the trade side ; but higher work in engineering and industrial
art have been taken up. The Collingwood Technical School
is only two years old. Day classes for the Junior Technical
School, and evening classes for technical students, are in full
swing. It is the only school where trade instruction is given
in plastering and in bricklaying.

The Sunshine Technical School is carried on during the day
for junior technical boys; also for the apprentices from Mr.
H. V. McKay?s workshops. Mr. McKay allows his boys to
attend for one afternoon per week.
Classes in English, mathematics, drawing, science and trade
work are carried on during the evening.
The Ballarat School of Mines was one of the first technical
schools established in the State. The special work first taken
up in the school was largely connected with mining pursuits.
The school served as a training ground for many of our pro-
minent mining men, and the importance of the work done by
this and other schools has never been realised. Branches of
engineering, and several trade subjects have been added to its
curriculum. The Art School, which is associated with the
School of Mines,' is the best of its kind in the State.
The Bendigo School of Mines was established in 1872, for
the purpose of providing instruction and training in the prin-
ciples of science, with their application to the various indus-
tries. The school is well equipped, and a large number of
courses of training for vocational technical pursuits is pro-
vided. These courses include mining, metallurgy, engineering,
surveying, trade and art subjects.
The Geelong Gordon College is developing on the engineer-
ing and building sections, while it has specialised in the train-
ing given to those connected wth the woollen industry, trade
and art work form essential parts of its curriculum.
Country Technical Schools have been established at Castle-
maine, Dalyesford, Maryborough, Stawell, Bairnsdale, Beech-
worth. In these, science, engineering and mining, and art sub-
jects are taken up; Castlemaine is expanding on the trades
side. The other country schools are at Warrnambool, Hor-
sham, Nhill, Echuca, Kyneton and Sale. The main object of
the latter schools is to teach such drawing and art work as is
necessary for those who desire to apply such knowledge to
trade, or industrial art.
The exhibits from the various schools do not fully represent
the activities of the institutions. Students who are at work
during the day, and who can only attend evening classes, have
no opportunity of indicating what is being done in mathe-
matics and many branches of science?trade and art work.

-greatly in its attitude towards the important arts of Swimming
and Life-saving.
So much so, that the Government has engaged two per-
manent organisers, who are attached to the Education Depart-
ment. With a staff of seven teachers, transferred from ordin-
ary scholastic duties for the summer months, these organisers
superintend the instruction and examination of school chil-
dren in swimming and life-saving.
The physical education of the children is receiving con-
siderable attention now, and parents are realising the import-
ance of this part of their children?s welfare. That swimming
is ideal physical training, and stands above any other method
or form, is a fact that is gaining general recognition.
During the currency of the exhibition, demonstrations of
land drill will be given in the arena, and the water work of
Swimming and Life-saving will be given in the special tank
erected at the rear of the grand-stand. On the east wall of tke
North Gallery some 200 square feet of space are devoted to
photographs, etc., to show what has been done, and what is
being accomplished, in country and urban areas.
It is instructive to note the progress made in the movement
since 1910. In that season (1910-11) some seventy-one schools
had classes of instruction in swimming and life-saving. The
next season (1911-12) saw the figures rise to 171 ?a large in-
crease, which was entirely dwarfed by that of the season
1912-13, which saw 504 schools actually teaching the arts as
part of the school?s ordinary curriculum.
This season (1913-14) promised to be bigger still, and that
promise has been fulfilled, for there are now over 700 schools


instructing- and encouraging- the children in learning the
methods of Swimming- and Rescue work.
Since 1910 some 7250 children have gained certificates of
proficiency in swimming and life-saving; and over 120 teachers
have fully qualified for the Department?s Certificate of com-
petency in Swimming, Life-saving and Physiology.
Last season six thousand children learnt to swim, and it is
expected that before the end of next April the figures for this
summer should reach very near 10,000?a gratifying state of
affairs.
The Swimming Bath at the rear of the Grand Stand will be
m use every day during the three weeks in which the exhibi-
tion will be open. Each day, at stated hours, school boys will
give demonstrations, under the supervision of the Staff of the
Swimming and Life-saving Branch of the Education Depart-
ment.
The bath, which is a patent, has been specially erected for
the occasion by Messrs. Shanks and Co., of 353 Flinders-lane,
Melbourne, who are the patentees.
The arrangements for Swimming and Life-saving in connec-
tion with the exhibition have been carried out by a special
sub-committee.


THE TEACHERS' COLLEGE COURT,
.the Teachers? College is an institution that is very little
known to the general public, and yet the work that is accom-
plished, in an unobtrusive way, in training the teachers of the
State, is, indeed, to be regarded as of the first importance. In
all the most enlightened communities of the world it is now
recognised that teaching is an art, and that the teacher must
undergo a course of training in order not only to learn the
fundamental principles of his profession, but also to receive as
broad a general education as possible, and to acquire a right
attitude to his future work. In these modern times specialisa-
tion is necessary in all fields, and none the less in the teaching
profession, so that in our College we have a separate course for
teachers for Kindergarten Schools, Primary Schools, and
Secondary Schools, and also for Domestic Science. All are
expected to pass certain preliminary examinations; the major-
ity of students being recruited from the High Schools before
entering the College, are required to serve as Junior Teachers
for two years, under the supervision of Head Masters of Pri-
mary Schools. The Kindergarten teachers, while at the Col-
lege, undergo a very special course in the method of teaching
in the Kindergarten and Infant School rooms; whilst the
Primary teachers are trained in the special methods of the
Primary School Those who are undertaking the Secondary
course must spend three years at the University m completing
the course for the Diploma of Education. In all courses there
are special experts, whose duty it is to supervise the practical
training in teaching, and the student must, before giving? a
lesson, prepare detailed notes of the method he professes to
use in the treatment. At the conclusion, the expert goes over
the lesson point by point, and shows the defects, or suggests
alternative schemes. Demonstration lessons, for the students?
guidance, are also given by the special masters of method, and
care is taken that the students see only the best. At certain
periods, sections of the students are brought together to hear
one of their number teach a special lesson, known as the
Criticism Lesson, and at its conclusion, a general criticism and
discussion is entered upon, under the management of a master
of method. As special work for their profession, all students
undertake a course in voice culture and choral work, and attend
classes in modelling and drawing. The men are also required
to complete a course of woodwork, whilst the women undergo
a short training in sewing. Special classes are also conducted
at the College for the students who are being trained to teach
domestic science work. In order to cope with the demand


for teachers in the country districts* the Department of Edu-
cation has established at the College short courses of training
for young people who are willing to take up duty in the remote
districts. Their course of training is mainly devoted to the
management of country school's..
The College is situated at the south-east corner of the
University reserve, and provides residential accommodation
for the majority of the students. The students are trained
not only professionally, but social life at the College helps to
equip them for the part they are to play ini the community at
a later stage.
EX PER IAIE XT A L EDUCATION.
One of the latest developments in education, which forms-
a part of the curriculum of the Teachers' College, is the
attention that is being paid to what is known, as Experimental
Education. This divides itself into several branches, but the
main ones are the investigation of the laws of thought, as
ascertained by close observation of the students themselves,
and the school pupils, and the questions concerning the teach-
ing of each subject of the curriculum. Material is being
gathered together for statistical purposes to ascertain which
methods produce the best results, so that ultimately a scientific
basis may be given to all teaching. Not the least important
of these are the investigations into the amount of fatigue
produced by various kinds of school procedure. Ihe exhibit
shows some of the apparatus that has been gathered together
by the College, but as the work is merely in its infancy, very
few results are as yet fully established, and hence these give
rather an indication of the nature of research than the final
conclusions.
A few typical phases of the teachers' training are exhibited,
though for the most part the work does not lend itself to*
concrete illustration.
As blackboard illustration forms such an important part
of the teacher's equipment, a few sketches are shown, giving
various historical and geographical illustrations. Notes of
Criticism Lessons, with the accompanying blackboard
sketches, give some idea of the nature of the preparation
necessary for a special lesson. The students undergo a course
in Science, and are encouraged to make and set up apparatus.
The exhibit shows a series devised to illustrate the principles
of hydrostatics.
Nature Study is an important subject for all Primary and
Kindergarten students.


The exhibit shows: ?I. The value of photography as an aid
to nature Study, by a series of photographs of insects and
birds, taken from living specimens. 2. The basis of the classi-
fication of insects by a series of drawings of the wings of
insects. 3. The relation of scorpions; Spiders and centipedes
to each other, and to insects. 4. Notes of lessons on the earth-
worm, duckweed arid parts of a flower, with illustrations. 5.
Germination of seeds by growing specimens. 6. Animals and
plants living in fresh water aquaria, with illustrations of same.
7. The work of the Gould League of Bird Lovers.
Another section of the Court is devoted to the Kindergarten
and Junior School Exhibit.
The aim of the Kindergarten and Junior School exhibit is
to present a few ideas developed by the following students: -
(a) Departmental ; (b) Free Kindergarten ; (c) teachers of
Correspondence Classes; (d) 1 eachers -of Infant 1 eacher
Centres (Metropolitan and Country), who have been receiving
tuition at or through the Teachers? College for Ist and 2nd
Kindergarten or Infant Teacher's Certificate.
The work shown is only that which has been prepared from
time to time for examination, and not for exhibition purposes.
As far as possible it is arranged to show the scope of the
I.T.C. (Infant Teacher Certificate) work, and' also the atten-
tion necessary for the training of teachers To meet the minds
of young children. Much of the hand work, the simpler forms
shown, can be done by the children themselves.
The exhibit consists of eight exhibits:?
SECTION I. ?Suggested Preparatory Work.
A development of one side of Home Life in connection
with the story of the Three Bears.
SECTION ll?Child Study.
Original Flays, Songs, Books. Mother Flay. Litera-
