REPORT
ON
THE BENDIGO GOLDFIELD
("CENTRAL AREA")
This Report is the outcome of an investigation into the
present condition and future prospects of the ( "Central Area ")
of the Bendigo Goldfield, undertaken with a view to seeing what
improved methods could be adopted in the conduct of mining
operations to neutralise the recent heavy increase in the cost of
labour and mining requisites, and so restore the industry to the
level of its previous prosperity.

SECTION 1. HISTORIC AND ECONOMIC
Bendigo lies 101 miles North West of Melbourne. It was one of the
earliest Australian goldfields, and its growth has sychronized with
the second great expansion in the gold yield of the world, consequent
upon the Californian and Australian discoveries. Bendigo is now one
of the most famous gold mining centres in the world; it is a substan-
tial city, with a population of over 35,000 people. The climate
and general conditions of life in Bendigo are exceedingly good, and
as a result of this important factor, the efficiency of the miners
is very high, and labour troubles, in consequence, have seldom
occurred in the 65 years’ history of the field.
Rich alluvial gold was found in the Bendigo Creek in the latter
part of 1851, shortly after the discovery of gold at Ballarat, and
for some years, work was confined to the alluvial deposits. Specimen
or quartz gold having been found in the outcrops, and the alluvial
deposits gradually becoming exhausted, attention was more and
more given to the working of the reefs. The claims, at first
very small, were gradually increased by purchase and amalgamation,
as the working conditions became more onerous with the increasing
depth. At first very little scientific knowledge was either available
or displayed. Few knew of the origin and nature of the quartz
deposits, and none troubled about economical methods of working. But
knowledge of mining was gradually developed during the 65 years
following the discovery of gold in Bendigo, and the methods early
attained a high standard of general efficiency as far as practical
mining was concerned; the field, however, suffered greatly,
by attaching an undue weight to the excellence of this department,
and neglecting scientific and financial efficiency. As a consequence
organisation of the field, as a whole, became conspicuous by its
absence, and immense sums of money have been wasted through bad
financial administration and lack of co-ordination in mining opera-
tions. Only the wonderful richness and productiveness of the field
has enabled profits to be made.
Persuing (as is usual when theory does not follow closely upon
practice), a penny wise and pound foolish” policy, the sudden rise
in the cost of labor, such as has recently taken place, immediately
disorganised the industry. Market values of the various mining
stocks have almost disappeared, and the gold yield for 1915 is the
lowest recorded. This great change is due, not to the depletion of
the resources of the field, but is primarily the result of changes
of policy and methods not having been introduced to meet the extra
charges which confronted the managements as a result of higher wages
and more costly stores. Instead of increasing efficiency, savings
were made by economy in development work. Driving, crosscutting and
sinking were curtailed. But the relief was as temporary as it was
fatal, for the lack of development and prospecting since 1912 has
been followed by the inevitable disastrous consequences.
SECTION 2
(a) STRUCTURE OF THE BENDIGO ORE DEPOSITS
(b) METHOD OF MINING ON THE BENDIGO GOLDFIELD
The area in which the Bendigo Goldfield is situated is almost
entirely composed of sedimentary sandstones and slates which were
originally laid down on the ocean bottom far from land. These rocks
were subsequently contorted by lateral pressure and earth movements
into corrugations, the axes of which run approximately 17°, West of
North. The age of the beds themselves is Ordivician, and it is
supposed that the folding occurred at the time of the great
granitic intrusions, about the end of the Devonian period.
While the sedimentary rocks were being folded into corru-
gations, frequent openings and cracks occurred between and across


the beds. This fracturing was particularly severe at the crests
of the corrugations (anticlines), and in the troughs (synclines),
where the cavities (in both anticlines, and synclines) were filled
with quartz which formed the saddle, and inverted saddle, reefs
which are as unique, as they are famous throughout the world for
their richness and productivity. The legs of these reefs gradually
decrease in thickness until, at some distance below the cap of the
saddle, they become attenuated and gradually die out. No two
saddle reefs are alike. In some cases the legs extend for hundreds
of feet in depth, and in others a leg will "cut out” at a few feet
from the cap. Frequently above the cap of the saddle reef, what
is known as a "neck” of quartz occurs and sometimes extending
for a great height.

Although a large proportion of the gold won in Bendigo has
come from saddle reefs, there are other reefs of a different
charater, which are the result of quartz filling the irregular
fracturing across the stratification. These "spurry formations”
are in many mines very important.
The most generally accepted theory of the origin of the gold-
bearing quartz deposits forming the Bendigo reefs, is that the
quartz and gold were derived from solutions given off by the grani-
tic intrusions which underlie the whole area of Bendigo, but which
only outcrop to the south. Opinions differ as to what proportion
of the quartz and gold was derived from these original solutions
or what was dissolved from the surrounding sediments and
re-precipitated. In any case, however, the solutions ascended
through faults and cracks in the folded and fractured rocks, and
precipitated the material held in solution, and so formed the
reefs containing quartz and varying quantities of gold, galena
zinc blend, and iron pyrites. ’


Why one reef contains a greater quantity of gold per ton of
quartz than another, why certain parts of the same reef are better
than others, or why a reef exists where it does, and not somewhere
else, are vital questions from a commercial point of view; but
there is at present not sufficient evidence to formulate any
satisfactory answers of a general character. In this regard,
though much has already been done, it is in the highest degree
important and necessary that a collection of all the evidence
bearing on these questions should be made. Definite knowledge
of the conditions which determine the existence, extent, and value
of the ore bodies, will save very large sums of money in prospect-
ing and developing the field.

34 issued by Vic-
torian Department
of Mines).
The principal theories that have been advocated in regard to
the occurrence of gold in Bendigo are; —
1. The zone theory, the principles of which are:—
(a) That there exists some peculiar quality in a whole
series of beds of country rock of a particular age,
that determines the precipitation of gold from
solutions passing through them.
or (b) That if a payable reef be found between two particu-
lar beds on an anticline, it may be reasonably
expected that another and similar reef will be found
in the neighbouring anticline or adjoining syncline
between the same beds.
2. The horizontal zone theory, according to which there are
a number of horizontal zones running through the Bendigo
goldfield, which alternately contain comparatively rich,
and comparatively barren reefs.


S. The vertical zone theory, which assumes that there are
vertical zones cutting at an angle across the goldfield,
and cause horizontally alternate comparatively rich and
comparatively poor values in the contained reef.
4. The intersection theory, the principle of which is that
values will be found in general at the points of inter-
section of two faults, or at the intersection of a fault
with an opening between the bedding of the country rock.

Area.” Scale 1 inch = 9000 ft.


All the above theories have something to commend them, and in
some cases are definitely applicable and of considerable value in
prospecting. But before they, or any combination of them, can be
applied in a more general way to mining in Bendigo, there must be
a collection of all the data available. A quantitative examination
of the cases of gold occurrence, which are in accord with one or
more of these (or some other) theories, can then be made. It may
then be possible to establish laws, which, even though they are not
general and conclusive, will, nevertheless, be of great assistance
in working the Bendigo goldfield. Prospecting and development thus
scientifically directed will save many times over the cost of this
preliminary work. There are ample signs that a great deal of very
valuable geographical information is lying available in Bendigo,
and this, if systematically collected, will be of great assistance
in mining. Many mine managers and others are working in this
direction, but so far their scientific efforts have not had suffi-
cient appreciation, and no attempt has been made to properly organise
the work.
Although the area of the whole Bendigo Goldfield is large, the
main portion of the field within which most of the mines are located,
is only some 20 miles long by 4 miles wide. Within this area again,
there is a portion--the ‘‘Central Area ’’--having a length of
about 5 miles and a width of 1 mile, from which the major portion of
the gold production of Bendigo has been mined. This small section of
the field contains the middle group of lines reef, of which there
are no less than 29 on the whole field.
The main lines of reef are known as the Lightening Hill, Hustlers,
Derby, Paddy’s Gully, Garden Gully, Deborah, Sheepshead and New Chum.
Their location can be seen in Fig. 3, which also shows the ‘‘Central
Area’’ of the field. On these lines of reef there is still a vast
quantity of ground to be prospected. Even where work has been done,
there are frequent examples of shafts having been sunk, and crosscuts
put out, without any driving being done, although it is common know-
ledge that in a short distance along the line of reef, the quality
of the stone (which may be barren when cut), will often so improve
as to make the reef highly profitable. Numerous instances of this
kind can be seen, and these shafts form an asset of the greatest
value to any comprehensive scheme of prospecting the Bendigo gold-
field.
Within this small ‘‘Central Area’’ or heart of the field, the New
Chum, Sheepshead, Garden Gully and Hustler’s lines of reef have been
worked much more extensively and continuously, than the Paddy’s Gully,
Derby, and Lightening Hill lines. But, although only prospected at
isolated points, these latter lines have had sufficient work done on
them to demonstrate their profitable nature. This opinion is quite
justified by the success that has attended the prospecting of the
reefs in the few mines where it has been done ; for example, the
Paddy’s Gully line of reef, in the Collman and Taeehi Co.’s mine and
the Johnson Co’s. Nos. 1 and 2 mines, and the Derby line in the
Johnson Co.’s No. 3 mine have given highly profitable returns.
The work so far done on the Paddy’s Gully, Lightening Hill, and
Derby lines of reef show well-proportioned anticlines, and the gold
occurrences already discovered force the conclusion that the systema-
tic working of these lines will lead to the discovery of very profit-
able reefs in the vast area so far unexplored. The future
possibilities are well illustrated on the Sheepshead line of reef
which laid neglected for half a century, simply because the
present ground surface did not happen to cut across the saddle
reefs, and show payable outcrops of quartz. It was only the
perseverence of the late Mr. G. Lanseli, in opening up the Little
No. 180 Mine, that led to the discovery in depth of reefs of
equal size and richness to any on the field, and resulted in the
opening up of the Central Red White and Blue and other valuable
mines. In this case nothing was showing on the surface because


the beds intersected by the surface happened to be, at that
particular elevation, unfractured and compact, and did not lend
themselves to the formation of quartz reefs. But at a greater
or less depth, earth movements have occurred, and have opened
and cracked the beds of country rock, and thereby established
favourable conditions for auriferous quartz depositions. This
is no mere theory. Althoiigh the surface may be barren,
profitable reefs are found in depth. This has been proved
on the Paddy ? s Gully, Derby and Lightening Hill lines of reef,
just as it ha,s been definitely proved in other parts of the
field. Fig. 4 illustrates how many reefs never come to the
surface. Systematic prospecting and development of most of the
Bendigo anticlines is alone needed to develop quartz deposits
which, although not showing on the surface, will be as valuable as
any yet worked in Bendigo.

of reefs which do not outcrop at the surface.
Although the field outside the "Central Area" has yielded
extensively, and there are many reefs unprospected, taking every-
thing into consideration, the lines undeveloped within the
"Central Area" should be the first attacked under the scheme of
work proposed in this report. This area gives the surest promise
of high return, and will thus stimulate the formation of other
large enterprises to work the balance of the field.
A perusal of the reports of all the mining companies on the
Hustlers, Garden Gully, and Sheepshead lines of reef, shows that
many massive bodies of quartz have been intersected by crosscuts,
but beyond cutting the reef they remain unprospected, lack of
funds or some diversion to another plan of campaign having pre-
vented further work along the reefs. By scientifically assembling
all the data available and correlating the mining developments in
one shaft with those in the adjacent mines, the work of opening
up undeveloped bodies can be undertaken in the most efficient
manner. But without this scientific preliminary investigation,
prospecting is merely groping in the dark.
When the alluvial deposits became exhausted, and more and
more attention was devoted to the quartz, many small reefing
claims were pegged out along the numerous lines of quartz out-
crops in Bendigo, and a great number of shafts were sunk to
shallow depths on many of the reefs. As the quartz near the sur-
face became worked out, and mining became more diffcult and
expensive, the richer companies purchased the poorer leases or
amalgamated with them. In this way the leases worked by each com-
pany became much larger and assumed their present dimensions.
With the increase of water in depth, engines were needed, and with
the additional working expenses due to the mines getting deeper,
a process of selection, depending to some extent on permanent
suitability but very largely upon the fortunes of the moment, was
made; one shaft would be continued and another abandoned.


In recent years, due largely to the work of the geological survey
staff, and to the earlier work of Mr. Nicholas, Mr. E. J. Dunn and
many others, data showing the relation of the reef on one mine, to
the same occurrence in another, has accumulated. Mine surveys have
also been carried out much more accurately. In the past, however,
there has been the most lamentable carelessness and neglect in these
respects. Important facts have been discoverd, but were soon for-
gotten, as plans were kept on only a few mines, and much data has
therefore been permanently lost. But there is still much information
available. If this were collected and applied with scientific
insight and proper organisation, it could be made much use of in the
preliminary surveys and scientific correlation of data, which would
enable those in charge of the industry to scientifically carry on the
work and use available money to the best advantage. A mere collec-
tion of this data may not immediately show where gold is to be found,
but it will frequently show, by negative evidence, that certain work*
is not worth doing, and so capital can be saved or devoted to other
work. Negative evidence in such a case is almost as valuable as
positive results. The unfortunate belief that prospecting data
can be remembered without the use of systematic records, and plans
has been responsible for much unnecessary work and large expenditure
of capital in Bendigo; expensive drives and crosscuts have been
driven only to find that the reef had been already prospected or
worked.
In Bendigo, mines are opened up with levels usually 80 ft. to
100 ft. apart. These are connected by rises and winzes, and the
reefs thus cut up, are stoped by the ‘‘flat back’ ’ method. On the
whole, this method of stoping is probably the most suitable, as the
reefs have usually a low pitch; but the rill system might, with
advantage, be used in large ‘‘neck’’ and ‘‘spurry’’ formations,
many of which run up to 50 and 100 feet in width. As the
stone on the average is mild and the gold is almost perfectly
free and responsive to a simple amalgamation treatment, opportunities
for low working costs are exceptionally good. The records of many of
endigo mines show that the cost per ton on producing mines is as
low as 9/- to 13/- per ton, including all administrative costs. In
these circumstances it is useless to hope for increased efficiency
by a forlorn attempt to extract more work from the employees than
they have hitherto done. I am of the opinion, that, for practical
work the Australian miner is the equal of any other, and although
by obtaining his co-operation, both mine owner and miner may benefit
largely, there is no substantial saving to be made by an attempt to
drive him to do more physical labor; the reverse is more likelv to
be the result.
The big economies that are possible in Bendigo will be the result
of an altered financial and administrative policy. Within the
Central Area’’ of the Bendigo goldfield there are over 40 pro-
perties each owned by a separate Company, every one of which has a
Board of Directors, Legal Manager, and Mine Manager with staff.
As a consequence the work on one mine is practically uncoordinated
with the work on its immediate neighbours and other operating
mines in the vicinity.
The remuneration paid to the officers of the Bendigo companies
is low, and it is not on the ground of expense of management that
I attack the system. It is because of its obvious and unavoidable
inefficiency, resulting from an immense amount of duplication of
work and plant and unnecessary prospecting and development.
An illustration of this can be seen in the many deep shafts
that have been sunk all over the Bendigo field. Some of these
shafts have been continued to great depths at a cost of tens of
thousands of pounds, whilst the ground could have been equally
well prospected, developed, and worked from a neighbouring com-
pany's workings. On the other hand, shafts have not been sunk to
any depth in many localities where the prospects justified it; lack
of financial means on the part of the proprietors may have been


the cause of this, but frequently it has been a case of interest
for the moment, being diverted to some more alluring discovery
elsewhere. In many cases, plants were put on properties only to
be sold off when practically no work was accomplished, whilst other
mines have been killed through never having had a proper plant.
This stoppage of work because of some temporary and local finan-
cial embarrassment, or other avoidable cause, has resulted in a
considerable number of mines being abandoned, when in the in-
terests of the field as a whole, the prospecting should have been
continued.
The recent mining operations on the Derby line of reef a,fford
an instance of misdirection of expenditure. This line of reef is
a main anticline, and is situated in the heart of the field, be-
tween the best producing mines on the Garden Gully and Hustlers
lines of reef. It could reasonably be expected, therefore, that
at least in the central area, the Derby line of reef would prove
to be highly productive, yet the Johnson's Reef Co.'s No. 3 has
been the only shaft sunk on it to any depth. In spite of the fact
this shaft had been deep enough to work it, an adjacent reef
at 1300 ft. in depth lay undiscovered for many years. Ulti-
mately this large reef was found, and it produced a large amount of
profitable ore yielding 18,000 oz. of gold. In consequence
of this discovery, interest in the Derby line was greatly
stimulated, and the Collmann and Tacchi, South Johnson's, and
Derby Companies commenced active mining operations. Shafts were
sunk to 300 or 400 ft., but the gold yields in the Johnson's Reef
Co.'s mine falling off, all these companies abandoned work without
ever getting to the depth necessary to reach a continuation of the
formation, and the Derby line of reef, apart from the Johnson's
Reef Co.'s mine, remains unprospected. Now, if one shaft only
say the South Johnson's Co.'s shaft, had been sunk, it would have
served the purpose of all three, and the money which had been put
into these three ventures (about £12,000 to £15,000) would have
been ample to reach and open up for the full length of all three
properties the continuation of the reef so profitably worked by
the Johnson's Reef Co. Unfortunately there are many such causes of
divided effort failing to achieve a success which would have been
certainly won if the work had been concentrated.
The artificial boundaries of the leases, which are usually most
irregular in size, are often the cause of high working costs and
great inconvenience, as frequently shafts have been sunk by no
means centrally situated to the area to be worked. Take a case in
point and one that has often occurred. A shaft is situated in one
lease, say 600 ft. from the boundary common to the adjoining
lease in which the shaft is only 100 ft. from the same boundary
a payable reef runs through both properties, and is worked by both
companies up to the common boundary. Under these conditions
material will have to be trucked 600 ft. in the one mine and 100 ft.
in the other. In addition to this unnecessarily expensive method
of transporting the stone, the cost of developing and mining the
reef would be very much more than would have been the case if
each company worked 350 ft. from each shaft. *
Another example of an arbitrarily fixed lease boundary causing
high working costs is seen in the case of the Virginia and Great
Northern Companies. The mines adjoin, have the same depth and
have the same reef running through both, yet the costs in the
Virginia Mine are approximately 11/- or 12/- per ton, and in the
Great Northern they are over £l per ton. The Great Northern
Company has a great quantity of water to pull, no battery and an
obselete plant, and the reefs are smaller. But the effect of these
circumstances on the working costs could be largely eliminated and
costs reduced in both cases to below those of the Virginia Comnany
if the two mines were worked as one. The workings of the Great
Northern Company at present are situated about midway between this
company’s and the Virginia Company’s shafts. Stone has to be


trucked to the former company’s shaft, a distance of 500 ft., raised
to the surface, and then carted back to the Virginia Company ’s battery,
a similar distance. If a connection between the two mines were made
au the proper level and an adequate underground hauling system was
installed, the whole of the stone mined by the Great Northern Company
could be taken up by the Virginia shaft and dumped direct into that
company s mill. The whole of the top expenses of the Great Northern
Company could then be done away with, and the Virginia Company’s
costs would be lowered, because of the increased output. It is safe
to say that, if the reef recently worked in the Great Northern mine
were mined by these means, and wihout consideration of lease boun-
daries, at least £12,000 of useless expenditure would have been saved
by the company during the last three years.
The most important factor in Bendigo mining administration is
the manner in which development work has been, and is being, carried
out. Owing to the nature of the reefs, a very large amount of
development work has to be done to pick up the shoots of profitable
stone. Probably from 20,000 feet to 30,000 feet of scientifically
directed driving, or its equivalent in rises and winzes, must be done
in Bendigo every year, if the average production of gold during the
last 50 years is to be maintained. Now, although the actual working
out of the reefs, when found, is not uneconomical, the method of
carrying out the prospecting and development to find these reefs and
enable them to be worked, is desperately so. Financial stringency
resulting from the No Liability system, and the policy of having
small companies entails, as a rule, the cutting down of all work
underground to two or three rock drills, and sometimes less. There
are actually many cases on record when only two men were employed
underground doing effective work, while the directorate, management,
and surface staff, were simply waiting the results of their efforts.
This hopeless inefficiency has resulted partly from custom, and
partly from failure to realise ordinary economic principles of
mining, but it is principally due to the fact that the Bendigo
mining companies are all too small, and their financial resources too
limited for proper work.
Frequently, it has been the case, that shareholders who had
received the dividends were not the shareholders who subsequently
owned the shares when calls had to be made to carry out prospecting
a.nd development work. The latter were soon discouraged or were
not able to pay the calls, and no determined effort was made to
get the calls in at a sufficiently rapid rate to enable the mine
to be worked full handed, which is necessary if economical work
is to be done.
The following is typical of many instances of this most
uneconomical way of working the mines: —Finances are so low that
work underground has been restricted to one face, at a cost, with
materials and truckers, of say £6O per month. To keep this going,
£9O per month has to be spent on top expenses and administration.
During the month not more than say 35 ft. of driving is done for*a
total cost of £l5O. In these circumstances the drive will cost about
£4/6/- per foot. Now, if five more rock drills were used underground
at an additional expenditure of £6O per month each, the top
expenses will increase scarcely at all, and the total cost will
then approximate £450 per month. But for this sum, 210 ft. of
driving would be done, and the cost would not be then more than
£2/3/ per ft. As it is footage of development and prospecting
which determines results, any scheme which would permit work being
concentrated and the mines worked full handed would obviously
save immense sums. An actual example of the economy that is
possible is to be seen in the case of the Confidence Extended
Company. It was costing over £3 per foot to drive, but by
merely increasing the number of miners below, the cost over all was
reduced to 30/- per foot.
What all tnis really points to is that in a great many cases it
would pay a company to remain idle for eight months in the year and


then to work for only four months with a full staff, rather than to
work continuously with only one or two faces being driven. Of course
water difficulties, labour covenants, and the present necessity of
keeping the public interest alive, would not permit of this being
done, but from an economic point of view it would be preferable
to the way many mines in Bendigo are worked.
With small companies, for the reasons already stated, it is
almost impossible to carry out efficient work such as could be done
by one large company controlling many mines, and with adequate
financial resources. By concentrating the work, the most efficient
mining could be obtained, and the whole of the prospecting and
development work could be scientifically systematised.
Another fruitful avenue of waste exists in the failure of
Bendigo mine owners to keep abreast of modern mechanical improve-
ments. There are a few plants in Bendigo which are very efficient,
but there are a great number which are most inefficient. The
reason for this is now, not so much lack of appreciation of the
value of possible improvements, but shortage of funds. As a rule,
small companies cannot afford to improve their plants out of calls,
and they are forced to go on year after year with inefficient
machinery, which in a few years' time eats up, in firewood alone,
more money than would be sufficient to provide new up-to-date and
efficient plants.
Under existing conditions, very little care is taken to have
scientifically and accurately recorded data in regard to the fuel
consumed, and the work done, by the many plants on the Bendigo
field. It is too expensive for each company to have a specially
trained engineer, yet one well qualified man could supervise and
continually have under test the whole of the machinery of the
field. A general investigation of Bendigo mining plants will
probably take from about five to six months to complete, and is a
necessary preliminary to determining the capital required to
bring the machinery up to date. But with efficient plant and
proper supervision, the economies that will be effected will soon
pay for any expenditure in bringing the machinery up to date.
The use of the diamond drill has never found favour in Bendigo,
for the reason that its votaries claimed too much for it, and its
opponents admitted too little. But the drill, if scientifically
used, would be of great assistance in prospecting. It would not
as a rule, determine values, but by determining in advance, where
reefs did not exist, expensive and useless crosscuts, winzes, and
rises could be avoided. In the case of the Victory and Pandora
and Garden Gully Companies, for example, much money has been spent
recently in an endeavour to locate spurs in the eastern country
on the supposed continuation of the reef worked at the 1100 ft.
level by the Carlisle Company. Expensive crosscuts were driven at
a number of levels but no spurs were located. The information thus
expensively gained was entirely negative, and if a thorough
geological examination had, in the first place, been made of the
vicinity, it is probable that no work at all would have been done,
except possibly to confirm the theory by a few diamond drill holes,
which would have shown all that the crosscuts did. The cost of the
drilling would have been one-sixth of the expenditure on cross-
cuts, and the money thus saved could have been devoted to pros-
pecting work in other directions.
Another use for the diamond drill would be to prospect between
crosscut and crosscut, and so save expensive winzes and rises
which are not needed for any other purpose than that of finding
out if reefs exist or not. The actual cost of a winze to connect
two crosscuts 100 ft. apart is usually £SOO, and a rise would cost
£250. A diamond drill bore could be put through from crosscut to
crosscut for approximately £75, and in very much less time.


Whilst the bore may not be useful in actual stoping, the information
it gives will enable the management to lay out the work exactly
where required if a reef is met with, and it would save expensive
winzes and rises if nothing were struck.
The diamond drill, if properly used, will be the means of
saving considerable sums of money in prospecting the Bendigo
goldfield. For the small existing individual companies to employ
one would be beyond their resources, but with an amalgamation of
interests a drill and expert staff could be constantly employed
in different mines.
Attempts have been made to prospect what are known as side-lines
with long crosscuts from the mines on the main lines. Prospecting
by this means cannot be too strongly condemned. In the first place,
it is not possible to prospect an anticlinal axis by merely
driving a crosscut; in the second, the expense of opening up a
reef line from one of these crosscuts is very great. When it is
realised that the quantity of ground which has to be driven
through is so great compared with the area prospected by one
crosscut, to expect success is almost futile, yet the failure to
discover values leads to the condemnation of the whole line of
reef on wholly insufficient evidence.
Although many shafts on the main lines of reef have been
unproductive; for instance, the Londonderry Company's sha.ft on
the Garden Gully line and the Pearl Company's on the New
Chum line, it does not follow that payable reefs do not exist
in even these areas. The prospecting may simply have been
insufficient, or misdirected.
The presence of quantities of water has frequently embarrassed
the operations of an individual company, although the Bendigo field,
taken as a whole, is virtually dry. A mere accident of location
at an unfavourable position from a drainage point of view, will put a
very heavy charge on an individual company which, as a result, may be
ruined by having to contend with all water in the vicinity. It is
only recently that steps have been taken to equalise the costs of re-
moving the water among all the mines concerned, but great difficulties
in doing this are constantly occurring. If the administration were ,
centralised, and the field worked as a whole, adequate and economical
pumping appliances could be installed at the most convenient
situations instead of being scattered in small units, and the cost of
keeping the mines dry would be spread over the whole field.
SECTION 3. FINANCIAL AND FUTURE POLICY.
Having dealt with the many opportunities there are for conducting
Bendigo mining more efficiently, it is now desirable to express
quantitatively, in actual money saved, the results of introducing
an improved system of mining with concentration of control and
scientific methods. In regard to estimates of proposed future
expenditure, it will readily be seen that new events, and unforseen
developments may considerably disturb some of the figures, but, on
the whole, what is set forth will be found to express sufficiently
accurately the results which can be achieved by carrying out the
suggested amalgamation of properties.
Under the present system, there is a complete absence of
confidence in the future of Bendigo mining. Prices of shares have
never been so low. The total market value of all the Bendigo mines
is now less than one-tenth of what it was ten years ago. Yet none
can say the intrinsic value of the goldfield has decreased in any-
thing like that ratio. The fall in value is due to this: —Ten years
ago, the expenditure of money on prospecting and development was at
the rate of over £200,000 per annum; to-day not much more than
£50,000 per annum is being spent.


The change in the financial position of the Bendigo mining
companies during the last two years will be appreciated after
perusal of the following tables, which, showing the gold yields,
calls, and dividends for many years past.

The £5,001,520 contributed in calls, must not be regarded as new
capital invested for it is in reality the reinvestment of dividends
p * d l lf a o ompany of £400,000 nominal capital, had aoquired
the Bendigo goldfield in 1881, and made no economies in working at
all i^. t^ e net pr ?f lt over the 36 y ear s (i-e., dividends less calls),
”“3 d have equalled approximately £50,000 per annum or about
2 Ve f J t j3 e whole P eriod - “ will thus be seen that
since 1881 the field has not only financed itself, but has paid a
h ?S h of interest. As a matter of fact this return should be
slightiy better, as the calls have been calculated as being paid on
, a whole of the shares issued, no allowance being made for those
that were forfeited. 6 vnose
From these figures it will be seen that the Bendigo goldfield
has been so exceedingly prolific, that the waste and inefficiency


from a system of small ownerships did not kill profits, but
merely engendered a condition of laissez-faire in the directorates.
The results on the whole were profitable, why change the methods?
This was the attitude adopted. The complete absence of any
standard system of keeping costs militated against, and still
prevents, the investing public and the shareholders themselves
seeing the actual conditions of affairs on each mine, as there
was, and still is, no ready means of comparing working costs.
When a company worked a large reef and extracted ore at very
creditably low figures, the working costs were kept and sometimes
made public, but when a company worked in only a small way, or did
development work only, no costs were kept, and the effect of the
penurious doling out of small amounts of money for developmemt
work was not observed. But the high costs (in many cases they
were more than double what they should have been) lengthened the
periods of depression and delayed opening up of new reefs. Too
often a company was ruined before another profitable reef was
discovered simply through a hand to mouth expensive system of
prospecting and development. Ample money was actually subscribed,
but it was fritted away through there never being sufficient
available to work the mine efficiently.
After considering the position of the field, its achievements,
and its prospects, in the light of the foregoing history, there
appears to me to be some forty properties contiguous to one another
which most effectively lend themselves to amalgamation as they will
receive the greatest immediate benefit from centralised administra-
tion and coordination of work. These properties are owned by the
following companies:
Suffolk United Windmill Hill
New Moon Koch’s Pioneer
South New Moon Carlisle
Clarence United Cornish United
Catherine Reef United Pearl
Williams United Hercules and Energetic
New Argus Ironbark
Specimen Hill Victoria Consuls
Virginia Unity
Murchison Garden Gully United
South Virginia Sea Amalgamated
Great Northern South Garden United
Constellation Central Red vVhite and Blue
Golden Pyke Sheepshead
Golden Age Monument Hill
Princess Dagmar United Hustlers and Redan
North Johnsons Hustlers Reef
Johnson’s Reef Great Extended Hustlers
Collmann and Tacchi Derby Reefs
Confidence Extended Victory and Pandora
Not only do these companies lend themselves to most effective
central administration and scientific management, but the mines give
the greatest facilities for carrying on operations in a big way, as
they°eontain reefs which so far have given the highest gold yields.


A summary of the balance sheets of the whole of the mining
companies operating in Bendigo for the three years ending December
31st, 1914, is as follows: —

Analysing these figures, it will be seen that the total gold
production for the three years (including tributors’ gold) was
sol,672,734; whilst the wages paid (including tributors’ proportion)
were £922,359. In order to arrive at the net profits for this
period (assuming the expenditure on capital items to equal the
amortization of pre-existing capital), it is necessary to first
deduct shareholders’ contributions, (£291,894), from the dividends
paid, (£373,106). The difference indicates a profit of £81,212. To
this figure must be added the surplus of receipts over expenditure, a
matter of £34,227. The approximate net profit for the field
during the three years in question would therefore be £135,439, or
an average annual profit of £38,479 for the whole of the mines
constituting the Bendigo goldfield.
Considering now the group of mines occupying the ‘‘Central
Area,’’ and which it is proposed should be amalgamated, the balance
sheets, for the same three years, if summarised, give the following
figures:— . ° ”

From the foregoing figures it will be seen that the mines
in question produced £1,237,750 worth of gold, including that won
by tributors, whilst the wages paid (including the tributors share
of the gold) amounted to £641,833. The difference between the
areholders ’ contributors, (£194,544), and the dividends,
(£322,253), is £127,709. Assuming the expenditure on capital
account to equal the amortization, the only other factor is the


variation in the companies* bank accounts v/hich improved to the
extent of £16,897 in the aggregate. The profit therefore amounted
to £144,606 or £48,303 per annum, an amount equal to the average
profit of the whole field during the past 35 years, and some
£lO,OOO greater than the profit made by the whole of the Bendigo
mining companies in the same period.
SECTION 4. ECONOMIES RESULTING FROM AMALGAMATION.
It is now necessary to estimate what additional profits can be
made as a result of the amalgamation of the ‘‘Central Area” com-
panies, and introducing more efficient methods and machinery on
their mines.
The item of expenditure on the mines which gives the largest
opportunity to improve on is ( ‘Prospecting and Development.”
Mention has already been made of the fact that no proper
system of keeping costs has been used in Bendigo, but by analysing
the balance sheets of call paying companies, a very good idea
can be formed of what prospecting and development has cost, and
is costing, shareholders.
Taking the following S 3 call paying companies, viz.:--New
Argus, Unity, Collmann & Tacchi, New Shenandoah, North Johnsons,
Confidence Extended, Sheepshead, Great Southern, Golden Age,
Constellation, Derby Reef, Devonshire, East Virginia, New R. W. &
B. Consolidated, Murchison, Victory & Pandora, Hustlers Reef,
Monument Hill, Garden Gully United, Specimen Hill, Pearl, and
South Johnsons, a total of £147,777 was called up from share-
holders, and £131,870 was received for gold sold during the
previously mentioned three year period. During the same time
46,771 feet of driving, crosscutting, rising and winzing, were
carried out on their mines, so the net cost of development was
about £3 per foot. But it does not mean that the actual cost of
this development was even as low as this high figure, for it will be
seen that the companies in question, apart from doing development
work, produced £131,870 worth of gold, and this helped to pay the
expenses of the mine. The actual cost of the driving, cross-
cutting, etc., was therefore probably as high as £4 or £5 per
foot. Now it has been definitely established by experience in
several mines in Bendigo, that, with a full staff, driving (or
its equivalent in rising or winzing), costs about £3 per foot.
This includes all top expenses, and allows for no gold being
obtained. The increased cost, amounting to perhaps £3 per foot,
is therefore the amount which shareholders pay for working their
mines in a small, inefficient way. Now, if one-third of these
33 mines had been kept open for one year each, instead of all
being worked continuously for the full period of three years, the
same total amount of money concentrated with a full staff, first
on one mine and then on another, v/ould have enabled driving,
etc., to be done for about £3 per foot instead of £4 or £5 per foot.
The total cost of development for the three years v/ould then be
some £93,543 instead of £148,057, and the saving v/ould have been
nearly £30,000 per annum. Allowing for gold obtained this
estimate would be increased. In other words, if the work had been
concentrated, it would have been possible to have done double the
development and prospecting work for the money expended. This
would have greatly increased the amount of profitable stone avail-
able, and this in turn, would have lead to increased production
and profits. Although economies in this direction are the most
important effects that will accrue from concentration of mining,
correlating the work done on all the mines, will enable a
scientific system of laying out prospecting and development to be
adopted; subsequent mining could then be done to much greater
advantage and with increased efficiency.


I believe , therefore, that at least ££o,ooo per annum, would
be a conservative estimate of the savings that can be made in the
cost of prospecting and development as a result of, having all the
mines under one management, concentrating work on certain mines
until they are brought, either to a self supporting stage (or are
abandoned), and then concentrating on another lot of unproductive
mines. Alternatively, instead of saving this money, it could be
judiciously expended in obtaining an additional 10,000 feet of
prospecting and development. All the change in policy really means,
is this:—lnstead of having a number of mines half manned under-
ground, all the mines that are working will be fully staffed. An
objection may be raised, that this concentration of effort will
lead to less labour being employed. But the most casual examina-
tion will disprove this. What will happen is that more men will be
employed underground, and there will be fewer on the surface.
The wages paid by the companies in the f f Central Area, ’ ' to-
gether with the tributors' proportion of gold, amounted to £660,531,
during the period under review on page 16. Changes of great im-
portance and in two contrary directions have taken place since
then. In the first place, the rate of wages has been increased
on an average, about by an award of the Arbitration Court,
and by an agreement since entered into. The present rates of wages
are to last until November, 1919. The increase since 191£ (prior
to which the rates were practically stationary for 30 years)
amounts in all to h§%. In other words, two men will now cost as
much as three did formerly. The problem therefore is, how to get
the same result as before 191£ with two-thirds the number of miners.
It is obvious, that, to continue to hope that matters will right
themselves is merely the ostrich’s method of dealing with trouble.
Luckily at the present time, the water drill is available and
promises to save the situation.
The water drill can be comfortably worked with one man and makes no
dust. Until a year or two ago, the practice had always been to employ
two men on each rock drill, but there is now no reason why one man
should not effectively operate a rock drill, and obtain the same
results as far as actual ore broken is concerned, as were formerly
obtained by two. The system of ‘‘one man one drill’’ has been given
a trial in Bendigo, and this has, in general, proved the foregoing
statements. In some cases, especially where the system has had the
whole-hearted support of the mine managers, the actual total working
costs have been lowered, in spite of the increase in the rate of
wages paid. In fact there are definite instances of a higher pro-
duction of ore from one man with one drill, than there was previously
from two men. This economy certainly affects only the rock drill
operator, but he is the most important employee a mine has, and upon
his efficiency and work the whole fabric rests.
Increase in efficiency of transport by the careful grading of
tram-lines, and improvements in trucks and trucking systems, is a
comparatively simple matter to attain, and is a factor that will be
productive of further economies. The contract system and careful cost
records will also do much to reduce costs.
Improved methods, if adopted, can, therefore, be relied on to
reduce underground expenses to approximately the same level as that
prior to the increase in the rates of wages. On the surface,
mechanical improvements, and the centralisation of work, are the
principle means of increasing the efficiency of labour.
I, therefore, feel quite justified in the statement, that the
experience of the new one man drills worked under the contract
system, with a proper method of keeping costs, will enable the cost,
per ton of ore, and per foot of development, to be reduced to
approximately what it was in the past. But I consider the full
benefits of these improvements can only be obtained if the work be


concentrated (both on the surface and underground), and controlled
by one central authority composed of highly trained technical men.
The expenditure on fuel by the mines in the ‘Central Area’’ is
nearly £44,000 per annum. The mechanical efficiency obtained by the
different mines in Bendigo varies very greatly; some plants are
working on a remarkably low fuel cost; others work on an extraor-
dinarily high one.
CRUSHING.—In many cases fuel for generating steam costs from
1/- to 1/6 per ton of ore crushed. The Johnson’s Reef and Shennan-
doah Companies' batteries are examples of this inefficiency. Yet in
the immediate vicinity, with modern mills like those of the
Central Red White & Blue, Virginia, and North Bendigo Companies,
the cost for fuel is under 3d. per ton of ore crushed. There is
no reason why the same efficiency should not be obtained all
round, if the necessary technical skill and capital were avail-
able. By using to their full capacity those plants which are
G ient, and by closing down old plants, a considerable saving in
crushing can be immediately effected. For example, there are two
companies, each of which has a separate battery, the crushing
costs at one equals 2/- per ton, and at the other it is 5/- per
ton. With an amalgamation of interests there is nothing to pre-
vent all the crushing being done at the efficient mill, which
could then be kept continuously employed, and with reduced costs '
all round.
WINDING AND PUMPING.—Many of the winding and pumping plants on
the Bendigo goldfield are most inefficient, and use probably 50%
more fuel than would be required by modern machinery. But apart
from the great saving in fuel expenditure, resulting from the use
of efficient plant, concentrating mining and prospecting work and
carrying out the work from one shaft instead of two, or
possibly three, would effect further great economies in fuel.
COMPRESSED AIR. --Providing compressed air for underground uses a
considerable amount of fuel. At present there is a separate air
compressor for nearly every mine, yet one large efficient plant could
supply all shafts within a radius of 3000 feet. It is far cheaper
to supply compressed air from a central compressing plant within
this radius, than to run a separate plant at each mine, especially
when the number of drills used on each mine is small.
SUMMARY.—By installing modern and efficient plant, and by con-
centrating the machinery as much as possible, there is no reason why
a saving of at least £5,000 per annum could not be effected in fuel,
by modernising the machinery in Bendigo, even after allowing for the
amatorization of capital cost over a period of not more than three
oi four years. And this saving is quite apart from the economy
arising from the increased efficiency in the labour that would at
the same time result.
( ( The expenditure on stores and materials by the mines in the
Central Area’’ is £47,000 per annum. The principal individual
item is dynamite, which probably represents at least one third of
this total. At present explosives cost the Bendigo mines 52/6 per
ease. Offers, however, have already been received, which, if
accepted, will show a saving of on the present cost; this would
represent a saving to the mines of approximately £4,000 per annum.
In regard to the expenditure on ‘‘other materials,’ ’ there is
no doubt that at least 10% could be saved by establishing ‘‘a central
store in charge of a capable man, who understood his business and
and was a good buyer. By standardising tools and stores used on the
field, and by absorbing any surplus stocks, a further great saving
could be effected.


If all the Bendigo mines were owned by the same company, and
controlled by the one central management, machinery that is lying
idle on one mine could, if suitable, be shifted and employed
at another where it is required. There would then be no necessity
to purchase new machinery, and much expense would thereby be saved.
Furthermore, by organising a central repair and fitting shop, a
great saving can be made on the amounts now paid by the companies
in the upkeep of their plants. I estimate the saving on the
‘‘machinery ’' account (which involves at present over £lO,OOO a
year) would be at least or £l,OOO a year.
The actual expenditure on *‘Sundries*' by the Bendigo companies
is really the difference between the expenditure and recipts
columns of their balance sheets. ‘‘Sundries'' include interest,
crushing, carting, lease rents, plant, air charges, insurance,
etc., and total the very large sum of £37,434 per annum. On
analysis of the figures, it will be seen that there is much room
for savings being affected.
(a) INTEREST.--Under existing circumstances, some companies
have a credit balance whilst others are overdrawn in
their accounts. Those in credit receive little or no in-
terest ; those overdrawn are charged the highest rate of
interest. There is probably an aggregate debit balance
averaging £15,000 permanently against some of the com-
panies included in the proposed amalgamation, but other
companies have credits which probably amount to between
£7,000 and £B,OOO. By setting one amount against the
other, an annual saving of £5OO could be effected in
interest payments, if the resources and liabilities of
the 40 companies controlling the ‘‘Central Area'' were
pooled.
(b) CRUSHING.--In the event of amalgamation, this item of
expenditure would still remain a cross entry as between
the several mines and batteries. No economies would
therefore be effected except by the improved treatment
methods which have already been considered.
(c) CARTING.--No very great economies could be effected in
the cost of transport under present conditions, but
improved organisation and better transport systems
would probably greatly reduce the cost of taking ore
from the mines to the batteries.
(d) LEASE RENTS.--No economy could be effected in this item.
(e) PLANT EXPENDITURE.--At present, the directors of com-
panies whose mines have closed down, or are about to
do so, hold on to the stores and machinery in the hope
of a revival. In the end, however, the stores are
often allowed to go to ruin, and the machinery is
frequently sold at a nominal price. Contem-
poraneously other companies are making continuous
additions to their mining plants, and machinery has
to be bought. If one large concern controlled the whole
field, plant could be used where most desired, there
would be no waste of stores and machinery, and instead
of buying new plant, much of the machinery in disuse
could be transferred to mines where it is required.
(f) PRINTING AND STATIONERY.--Under existing conditions it
is necessary to circulate notices for 40 different com-
panies. A separate communication must be sent out in
regard to calls, sales of forfeited shares, and meetings,
by each company, to each of its shareholders. A balance
sheet and report have also to be printed half-yearly by


every company. This entails great expense in printing
and postage, and occupies a considerable proportion
of the time of the legal manager’s staff. The expendi-
ture of printing and stationery would be reduced by at
least if the companies were amalgamated and only one
set of notices, balance sheets, etc., had to be circu-
lated .
(g) SUNDRY ITEMS.--It is reasonable to believe, that adminis-
tration from one central office would avoid a great deal of
overlapping, and save considerable minor expenditure which
is now inevitable.
On sundries, printing, stationery, and other sundry expenditure,
there should be a saving of at least £5,000 per annum as a result of
amalgamation.
The indirect saving as a result of better methods and proper
co-ordination of work would total a sum just as large as the direct
savings above enumerated. As an example of this indirect economy,
the case of working the Great Northern and Virginia mines as one unit
might be quoted; by this arrangement (details of which are given on
page 9 of this report), alone at least £5,000 per annum could be saved
, 4 scale of operations on the group of mines in the
Central Area be maintained as in the three years previously
mentioned, there is no reason why, at the end of the first year,
savings at the rate of at least £70,000 per annum should not be made
through amalgamation. And, in subsequent years when the organisation
is complete, there is no doubt that other avenues for economy will
reveal themselves.
Other directions in which savings can be made as a result of amal-
gamation of the Bendigo mines might be mentioned. Of these the most
important is, perhaps, the suppression of gold-stealing. Those with
knowledge of the question have estimated the amount of gold stolen in
Bendigo at worth from £20,000 to £30,000 per annum. At the present
time, the mining companies have no organised system of dealing with
this evil, but if the whole of the I ‘Central Area’’ were owned by
one company, there is no reason to doubt that effective measures
could be taken to stamp out any gold stealing there may be, or at
any rate, minimise it.

During the three year period ending 31st December, 1914, the
Bendigo goldfield produced 1,074,764 tons of ore. Reference to the
summary of balance sheets shown on page 16 of this report will show
that the total expenditure of the mining companies, which produced
this amount of ore was £2,054,651/17/4. To get the actual cost, the
dividends paid and the sundry receipts (which are in most cases a
cross entry), will have to be deducted from this amount, and the
total cost per ton of ore crushed then works out at 29/- per ton.
It has been and is assumed by many that mining costs at Bendigo are
very low, but when the free milling nature of the ore, the mild
character of the average rock, the relative cheapness of stores, the


accessibility and climatic conditions of the field, and the number
of large lodes that are mined, are considered, 29/- or 7\ dwts. per
ton of ore, is a very high working cost, and one that should be
easily reduced. These figures will show how false an impression is
given by the criticism of an occasional balance sheet of a company
‘‘on gold.’’ Mining costs in Bendigo at the present, and in the past,
instead of being amongst the lowest in the world, as they should be,
are, under the conditions, probably the highest. A reduction of
1 dwt. or 4/- per ton should be a very easy matter, and this would
amount to the saving of £70,000 per annum which has been estimated
as the economy that can be effected by amalgamation.
The cost of management for the whole of the Bendigo goldfield
is at present £12,910, and the cost to the companies included in
the Central Area'' is approximately £B,OOO a year. The present
system of management is that each company has its mine manager and
his staff, its legal manager, its board of directors, and its
registered office. This gives a diversity of individuals, all
knowing something about all the branches of mining, but gives few
men, if any, who are specialists in any one department. As in
everything else, specialisation is essential in mining, and it is
impossible for one man to be expert in everything.
An incomparably better system of management would be to have
each branch of mining under the control of a specialist, instead of
as hitherto, having each mine controlled by a separate body. The
specialists of one branch could then be in continuous consultation
with the specialists in other departments, and they would form
the controlling executive of the field.
The system of management I would, therefore, institute is as
follows:--
THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND GENERAL MANAGER.--A central Board
of Directors should be elected by the shareholders, to govern the
financial policy of the company which takes over the mines
included in the f "Central Area.’’ This Board should direct the
affairs of the company generally, and would appoint a General
Manager, who would carry out the policy of the Board, and directly
control the group of specialists administrating each department,
and co-ordinate their work.
THE ADVISORY STAFF.--The departments I would create are at
first six in number. Each would be administered by a trained
specialist, forming, together with his confreres, an f 'advisory
committee,'' which would really control the technical
administration and work of all the amalgamated mines. In
short, this committee would carry out and direct the policies
determined by the Board of Directors. It would meet daily, and
would administer the several departments, and should be consti-
tuted as follows
1. THE CHIEF ENGINEER.--The Chief Engineer would be in charge
of all actual mining operations s,nd transport. He would advise as
to the system of mining to be adopted, and would investigate all
underground methods. He would, in consultation with the mine
managers, control 3,11 prospecting and development work, and would
act as chairman of the ‘'advisory committee'' in the absence of
the General Manager.

2. THE MECHANICAL ENGINEER.--The Mechanical Engineer would be
in charge of all machinery, the efficiency of which he would be
continuously investigating. He would have control of the fitting
and repair shops, and the erection of all plant. He would
also advise on, and supervise, the installation of underground
mechanical systems.


3. THE GEOLOGIST AND SURVEYOR.—The Geologist and Surveyor
would be in charge of all surveys and plans. He would record all
data resulting from prospecting and development, and would link up
the surveys of the workings in one mine with those in another.
This officer would also make recommendations for prospecting and
development, and in this connection he would work in conjunction
with the Chief Engineer.
4. SUPERINTENDENT OF STORES.—The Stores Superintendent would
have charge of the purchase and distribution of all materials and
stores required for all the mines. He would audit the stocks
held at the various mines, and keep a record of consumption on
each.
5. BATTERY SUPERINTENDENT.—The Battery Superintendent would
be in charge of all mill work, and would settle which mill shall
receive each mine's ore. He would investigate problems of gold ex-
traction as they arise, and determine the method of treatment. He
would superintend the work of the mills generally, attend to the
sale and sampling of concentrates, and investigate the treatment
of tailings, and tailings dumps.
6. THE ACCOUNTANT AND SECRETARY.—This officer would be in
charge of all the books of the proposed company, including the
share registrar. He would, in conjunction with the Chief Engineer,
determine costing systems, and all questions of administrative
finance. He would act as Secretary both to the Board of Directors
and to the committee'' of specialists, and would be the
Public Officer of the company.
I estimate that the cost of managememt, with the above system,
will be approximately £8,000 per annum, or about the same sum as
it is at present. The change in the system will therefore show
no immediate saving over the present arrangements, but its
increased efficiency is obvious. The proposed new management would
actually provide an organisation with a co-ordinated technical
control, an arrangement which is entirely lacking at the present
time. It will, in addition, fulfill all the functions that are
now performed by the many boards of directors and legal managers,
who at present control and direct the operations on the Bendigo
mines.
Before any complete reorganisation scheme can be put on
a proper footing, certain preliminary work will necessarily have to
be done. It is - essential that a proper system of keeping costs shall
be introduced. The Mechanical Engineer will have to go thoroughly
into the question of the relative efficiency of the various plants.
The Geologist and Surveyor must undertake, with an efficient staff,
the compilation of records of all the mines, co-relate all data, and
prepare a complete set of plans, all to one scale. When this is
done, a complete scheme of reorganisation of plant and an adequate
policy of development work can be laid out.
CONCLUSION.
The outstanding features disclosed by this investigation are
that mining in Bendigo has reached a critical condition on account
of : --
1. curtailment of prospecting and development during the
past few years.
2. --The heavy increase in the cost of labour and mining
requisites.
3. --The small amount of capital now being introduced for the
purpose of opening up new reefs.
If things are allowed to drift, mine after mine will close down,
and only those that are paying their way or making a profit will be
kept working. These mines will then have to bear all the cost of
draining the field, and with these additional expenses, it is not
likely they would long survive the stoping out of the present ore
bodies, as development work on even these mines is being sadly
restricted.


On the other hand it has been abundantly proved:
1- the Bendigo goldfield invariably responds to
prospecting and development.
2- there is still a vast extent of reef channels
absolutely unprospeeted.
3- the existing methods of mining and management are
most inefficient, and that the average working costs are
over 7 dwts. per ton, and can be substantially reduced.
4- by efficient management, concentration of work, and
up to date machinery, a matter of £70,000 per annum can
be saved if the mines in the ‘‘Central Area’’ be worked on
the same scale as they were two years ago.
I estimate that the recent increase in the cost of wages will
absorb the profits previously made by the Bendigo mines, and that the
savings made by the introduction of the one man drill will also be
required to enable the field to pay its way. But the saving of £70,000
which can be made in the other directions mentioned in this report,
will be available as profit. To effect this saving, the system of
management must be completely altered, and there is no other way of
effecting the change except by amalgamation of interests, and
making available a sum of £lOO,OOO to put the machinery in order,
reorganise the whole field, and ‘‘catch up’’ with the prospecting and
development. It is useless doling out money in small amounts as
hitherto, as development has got so far behind, tha,t existing ore
reserves will have gone before new bodies of stone are opened up.
It is also useless perpetuating the present methods and system of
management, because only by centralised and technical control,
and improvements in mining methods and machinery, can the increase
in working expenses be met, and the field put on a payable basis.
In these circumstances, an amalgamation of interests is really
obligatory, because it is only by this means that sufficient
economy can be effected to justify the necessary further capital
being subscribed.
It is true that one large company will destroy, to some extent,
the lure of the ff big rise, '' and eliminate the speculative
element in Bendigo mining, but it also does away with the possi-
bility of a heavy and complete loss. Shareholders in the dividend
paying companies will be compensated by a correspondingly greater
allotment of shares, and they will be exchanging an extremely
risky holding (on which they are certain to have pay calls sooner
or later), for one which will return a reasonably certain annual
income.
Speculative support for mining will only sustain it as long as
profits are being made in adjacent properties, and recent experi-
ence of Bendigo mining has shown that business methods must re-
place the speculative if the field is to regain its former
prosperity. By amalgamation of interests the risk of individual
failure will be eliminated. A glance at the dividend payers, say
at intervals of five years for the 35 years, will show that those
mines must in contempt at one period, are the most favourably
circumstanced at another, and vice versa. Practically all the
properties it is suggested to include in the scheme of amalgama-
tion, have had several periods of high prosperity, and still
contain ample possibilities for further rich discoveries.
In summing up I definitely say that it is only by economies
and more efficient work that the Bendigo goldfield can be put on a
profit making basis. I further say, that these economies can only
be obtained by concentration of control, scientific management and
co-ordinated mining, and these in turn can only be brought about
by amalgamation of interests.
