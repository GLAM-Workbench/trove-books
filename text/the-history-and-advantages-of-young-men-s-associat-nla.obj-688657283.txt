PREFACE.
The following- Lecture was prepared at the request of the
“Beechworth Young- Men’s Association/’ and was delivered
a large and highly interesting audience at the public inaugura-
tion of the Association, on June 10th, 1856. It was prepared
solely in reference to delivery. Its publication is owing to the
following resolution of the Members of the Association, “ Resolved
unanimously, That the President he requested to publish the
Lecture delivered by him on June 10th.” In deference to this
request, made by about forty young men, the Lecture is now
committed to the press. I have not felt myself at liberty to
make any alteration; the Lecture is printed precisely as it was
delivei ed. I must, therefore, ask the indulgence of the reader,
and lemind him that these pages should not he read and criticised
as if they had been written for publication.
It was my privilege and honour to be one of the fourteen young
men who instituted the London “Young Men’s Christian Asso-
ciation in 1844, and to be its first Honorary Secretary. I am
not without hope, that the cursory glance at its rise and progress,
which I have given in the following pages, may induce some


PREFACE.
young’ men in this land to attempt and persevere in similar efforts.
The “ Beechworth Young Men’s Association” has commenced
with fair prospects of success. Though in a very limited com-
munity, in one month after its establishment it numbers moie
than fifty members. If the publication of this Lecture should in
any degree call attention to, and induce efforts for, the mental
and spiritual improvement of the young men in Victoria, its
design will have been fully answered.

YOUNG MEN’S ASSOCIATIONS:
THEIR HISTORY AND ADVANTAGES.
A LECTURE.
I cannot commence my address to you this evening’ without
referring* for a moment to the pleasure which I feel in being’
invited by the Beechworth Young- Men’s Association to g-ive the
introductory lecture, and thus, as it were, publicly to inaugurate
their proceedings as a Society.
The subject on which I am to address you is the “ History and
Advantages of Young Men’s Associationsit is not of my own
choosing, hut has been selected by the members of the Associa-
tion, yet had the selection rested" with myself it could not have
been more to my mind.
It is reported of the celebrated Correg-gio that, while wander-
ing one day through a gallery of pictures at Home, and contem-
plating the triumphs of art, forgetful of every surrounding cir-
cumstance, he burst forth into the passionate exclamation, “I
also am a painterso, when I am associated with a number of
young men, when I consider how full of hope is their future, how
awful their responsibilities, and how important the influence which
they must exert over the destinies of the present and future ages,
I can hardly suppress a sentiment similar to that of the great
painter, and exclaim “ I also am a young man!”
Looking upon man as an immortal being—reflecting upon his
great capabilities for good or evil—knowing something of the
dangers to which his morals are exposed, and the specious snares
which would allure him from virtue, remembering that the youth
is father to the man, that the habits, the tendencies, the moral
education of the young must greatly influence and mould the
character of the mature man; I feel the overwhelming importance
which should ever be attached to the period of youth, and to the
institutions and principles in which “ our young men” are trained.
One of the characteristics of the age is the attention which has
been attracted to the education of the masses. Learning and
science are now no longer confined to the cloister or the forum,


but are scattered broadcast over our land. The last quarter of a
century has done more towards the elevation of the middle and
working classes, than probably any two preceding- centuries ; and
the efforts which have been made have proved most reproductive,
in the physical and moral benefits which have residted from them.
Science and art have an almost mag-ic power, greater and more
astounding- than the necromancy of past ag-es, or the fabled powers
of the gods of heathen mythology. Machinery has lightened the
labour and cheapened the products of industry to an almost in-
credible degree. Railways and steam ships have brought the
poles almost within hail; while the electric telegraph enables us to
chain the lightning, and by its mysterious agency, hold converse
with the most distant parts of our earth, and thus annihilate
space.
The implements of education are now placed so completely in
the hands of all, that the workhouse boy can, by his own effort,
raise himself to the eminent Biblical scholar—the blacksmith to
the proud pre-eminence of being able to read eighteen languages
—the carpenter lad to be professor of Oriental Literature in the aca-
demic halls of Cambridge—the humble farmer’s son to the honour
of being the discoverer of the planet Neptune; while the number
of distinguished individuals who have risen from the artizan to
the employer, the inventor, the engineer, and have astonished the
world by their stupendous tubular bridges, fleet locomotives, ariel
machines, and wonderful mechanical appliances, is so great as to
forbid our referring to them in the limits of the present lecture.
Time was when the mental and moral elevation of the masses
was feared. “ A little knowledge ” was said to be “ a dangerous
tiling,” —disastrous consequences were predicted from the general
dissemination of literature, science, and art. But that period has
passed away. The problem has been solved, and, instead of
sowing the seeds of moral and political dissolution, it has proved
to be the cement, which, by its inherent qualities, binds man closer
to man.
Rank, wealth, office, and other outward circumstances, must
ever exert their influence while society is constituted as at present.
The gradations of our social organisation arise from the constitu-
tion of our natures, and the fitness of things, and must therefore
be regarded as the ordinance of God; and a judiciously directed
improvement of the people will not only not lessen the wisely
settled order of society, but will rather tend to cement and con-
solidate it. Educate the people, educate them in the great prin-
ciples of Christian morality which the Bible teaches, and you will
help to establish the times of the church and the nation.
Much has been accomplished in the present century by the
establishment of mechanics’ institutes, literary institutions, public
libraries, young men’s associations, &c. They give opportunity to
the middle and working- classes to cultivate letters, art, and
science, during their hours of cessation from labour; and they
have had the two-fold effect of stimulating- effort to acquire the
education necessary to use these advantages, and of lessening the


hours of labour, so that the advantages may he obtained. The
mechanic, the artizan, the clerk, and the shopman, no longer
regard themselves, and are no longer looked upon, as machines,
necessary for the successful carrying on of trade, and the imple-
ments by which wealth is to be accumulated; but are seen in
their true character as men, as moral agents, as rational beings,
whose claim to mental and physical recreation and education is as
strong as that of the more favoured of their race. Hence it is
that the age of adult education, for it is this at which the me-
chanics institute and the young men’s association aim, has also
been the age of moral elevation and amelioration of the curse of
labour. Landed proprietors have built their model labourers’
cottages, manufacturers have established their factory schools and
factory libraries, merchant princes and retail tradesmen have insti-
tuted their lecture halls and libraries. The hours of labour have
been brought within more reasonable limits. Noble lords, elected
commoners, and cabinet ministers have not only rivalled each other
in zeal in the senate on behalf of those oppressed by labour, and
by legislative enactment protected them from the pressure of
tyranny and avarice; but they have been likewise found in the
mechanics’ institute, the farmers’ society, the athenaeum, the
young men’s association, foremost as instructive and popular
lecturers.
Happy the country where such sights are seen, and such facts
heard. England, the home of the brave and the free, the land of
liberty, equality, fraternity,—the focus of literature, science, and
art, —the land of the Bible, —may thy sons long continue to grow
in virtue, morality, and religion. May thy armies and navies
ever be invincible; may thy soil never be trodden by foreign foe,
never distracted by civil disturbances. May thy merchant fleets
long continue to sail on every sea; thy sons, by their indomitable
energy, to people distant shores, and plant the banner of thy
“ phantom flag,” and of the “ cross,” in many lands. May thy
Queen long be spared, by her virtues to adorn thy throne and shed
lustre upon her crown. May thy laws, thy institutions, thy
religion, thy commerce, long bless thy own and distant climes,
and may thy destiny be “ upwards and onwards” till time shall be
no more!
Manifold are the illustrations which the history of human effort
afford, that u great results from, little causes spring .” Few cir-
cumstances of late years have more strikingly shown this than the
history of “Young Men’s Associations.” About the years from
1840 to 1844 considerable attention was attracted to the physical
and moral condition of the young men engaged in business in the
metropolis. At that time the usual hours in the shops were from
seven in the morning to ten, eleven, and twelve o’clock at night—
from fifteen to seventeen hours. There was no class more de-
graded and dissolute—none who lived in greater disregard to
morals and religion—none who were sunk deeper into ungodliness
and dissipation than the 50,000 shopmen of London. And what


is said respecting them must, in some sense, be said of those simi-
larly occupied in the large provincial towns. The great confine-
ment, and the respiration of a vitiated atmosphere, induced disease
of various kinds, and resulted in a frightful mortality. The testi-
mony of the most eminent medical men went to prove that “ The
healthiest youths often, after two or three months of this
drudgery, fall ill; if they recover, it is to become sallow, thin,
sickly, and thus to drag on their doomed life in cheerless lassi-
tude till they exchange it for an early tomb.” The revelations of
medical science led many of the young men to make an effort for
the physical and moral regeneration of themselves and their
fellow-assistants. “ The Metropolitan Drapers Association ” was
formed for the purpose of obtaining an abridgment of the hours of
business in the drapery and other trades. In this movement the
assistants were joined by many of the most respectable employers.
A prize essay on the evils of the u Late Hour System” was pub-
lished, and obtained a very wide circulation. Public meetings
were held; medical gentlemen and the ministers of various deno-
minations earnestly aided the effort, and in the course of a few
years a very marked change was effected, and nearly all the
respectable houses of the metropolis, and in the provincial towns,
reduced their hours of business to reasonable limits.
It may be supposed that such a movement as that which I
have briefly sketched would be met with many obstacles. But
the chief objection of its opponents was that “ If young men had
more time at their disposal they would spend it in dissipation;
and that, therefore, to close the shops earlier would do them more
harm than good.”
It was to meet this objection that Young Men’s Associations
were formed. A few young men, residing in one of the houses of
business in which their physical and mental culture was not over-
looked, began to consider how they might be useful to their
fellow assistants in other houses. A meeting was the result of
these reflections, and it was held in a bedroom in the house of
G. Hitchcock and Co., St. Paul’s Church Yard, on 6th July, 1844.
Eight young men were present at that meeting’, and these, with
six others (fourteen in all), formed themselves into an association
for promoting the improvement of the moral and spiritual condi-
tion of young men engaged in houses of business. Early in its
history the society adopted the name of the “ Young Men’s Chris-
tian Association.” Its efforts were at first confined to the seeking
out Christian young men in different establishments, and encou-
raging them to attempt the introduction of religious services and
mutual improvement classes. Once a fortnight meetings of mem-
bers -were held, at which reports were furnished as to the success
which attended the efforts of the association, and also for mutual
edification and prayer. The first place in which these meetings
of members were held was at the St. Martin’s Coffee-house, Lud-
gate Hill. About two months after the formation of the associa-
tion, the place of meeting- was changed to Radley’s Family Hotel,
Bridge street, Blackfriars, the former room having become far too


small. In four months the number of enrolled members had
reached to seventy, and religious services were established in
fourteen large houses of business.
At this state of the Society’s progress it was deemed advisable
to make the public acquainted with the movement, for until then
its operation had been carried on in the most private and unosten-
tatious manner. No person was admitted to its meetings but by
direct invitation of the committee ; and no public intimation what-
ever had been given of its existence or operation.
On the Btli November, 1844, a tea-meeting of the members and
friends of the association, was held in the large room at Radley’s
Hotel. Many fears had been expressed that in this step the com-
mittee were precipitate; hut the event proved the wisdom of the
course they had adopted. About two hundred persons, mostly
young men, sat down to tea together. The meeting which fol-
lowed will never be forgotten by those who attended it. The
ministers who took part in the meeting were the Revds. John.
Branch, of the City Mission; William Arthur, Wesleyan; Wil-
liam Fraser, Baptist; and R. W. Dibdin, Church of England.
Mr. Owen, of Great Coram street, occupied the chair. The asso-
ciation was now fairly launched. Many were the predictions that
it would have only a brief existence, and the idea was ridiculed
that an association of a few young men could hold together long.
Some trembled and some hoped, but none were sanguine enough
even to dream that it would ever affect the good or reach the posi-
tion which it has now attained.
Many were the difficulties with which the association had to
contend, and much watchfulness and care had to be exercised on
the part of the committee. Exception was taken by some to the
exclusive character of its membership. The accomplishment of
the objects at which it aimed was regarded as utopian by others;
while a large number openly avowed their belief that the move-
ment would speedily die out.
But attention was soon attracted to the association; its objects
and agencies were warmly advocated by the religious press and
from the pulpit, and its progress from that period became rapid
and permanent. Branches were formed in several parts of the
metropolis, and the existence and success of the society soon be-
came a most powerful argument against the objection, “That if
young men had more time they would use it improperly.”
During the winter of 1845 the experiment was tried of the
delivery of a series of lectures, on topics not strictly religious hut
religiously treated. The trustees of the Wesleyan Centenary Hall
kindly placed that large and spacious room at the disposal of the
committee, and who, in order to meet the case of the young men
in the West End, also engaged the lecture room of the Leicester
Square Institution; the lectures being- delivered alternately at
either place, and the hour of delivery so fixed as that the young-
men could attend. The price of admission was nominal. The
lecturers were men of well known and acknowledged ability;
among whom may be mentioned Revs. Dr. Cumming, Dr. Archer,
William Arthur, John Stoughton, and James Hamilton. The


experiment was completely successful ,* all the lectures were well
attended, and some of them crowded. It was a triumphant an-
swer to the calumny that if time were given young men , they
would spend it badly. The winter lectures thus inaugurated have
been continued annually, and for several years past have obtained
crowded audiences, and the Exeter Hall Lectures of the “ Young-
Men’s Christian Association” are now .familiar as u household
words.” The eleventh course of lectures has just been completed,
nine courses have been published in a cheap form, and have had a
very large circulation. It is not too much to say of these volumes
that in interest, in importance, and in general literary ability they
stand unrivalled.
When the association had been in existence about six months, it
was found to be necessary to employ a paid secretary. Twenty-
eight applications were made for the office, and among’ the appli-
cants were nine ministers of the Independent Denomination, and
one minister of the Established Church. Many of the candidates
were evidently superior persons ; but after a very careful and
anxious consideration of their merits and claims, and personal
interviews with those who appeared to be the most eligible, the
committee declined to appoint any one of the applicants. The
office was then offered to the honorary secretary, but was not
accepted by him. The appointment of Mr. T. H. Tarlton to this
office was followed by the happiest results. To his deep piety, un-
tiring energy and judicious conduct of the society’s affairs, much of
its present position is due. The appointment of a secretary natu-
rally led to the engagement of an office, and a suite of rooms was
rented for this purpose in 14, Sergeant’s Inn, Fleet street. The
operations of the association were carried on from this place until
towards the end of 1849, when the premises previously occupied
by the “ Whittington Club,” 7, Gresham street, City, were
secured. Here the committee were enabled to carry into success-
ful prosecution a scheme which had occupied their attention at an
early period in the history of the association, viz., the establish-
ment [of a library and reading* room, and the formation of a
“ home ” for those who arrive friendless in London, where do-
mestic comfort and Christian guidance shall be combined. The
library for circulation and reference was a most valuable help to
young men, and the reading room was supplied with all the
literary and religious periodicals of the day. A news and refresh-
ment room was provided, and supplied with the principal daily and
weekly papers, and in which refreshments, tea, coffee, &c., were
obtainable by the members on moderate terms. Rooms were ap-
propriated for classes, of which the following were formed :
German, Latin, French, Hebrew, English grammar, Greek, Arith-
metic and Mathematics, and Discussion. There was likewise a
Lecture Hall, in which devotional meetings, lectures, and addresses
were conducted weekly. Here young men could meet their
friends, without being obliged to go to the tavern; they could
consult a valuable and well-selected library; they could take
home with them books for reading and study; they could make
themselves acquainted with the great movements of the age ; with


the politics of the clay, and the news of the hour. They could
join in the weekly devotional meeting-, or listen to a lecture, or
address, from some eminent minister, while on Sabbath afternoons
the excellent secretary conducted a most interesting and profitable
Bible class.
Here then, the entire scheme of the projectors of the Young
Men’s Christian Association was fully developed, and I am sure
that those of its early friends who had laboured and prayed, and
anxiously watched its progress, must have been amply repaid for
their toil and expenditure, when they witnessed the successful in-
auguration of their entire project, at the opening of these rooms
on the Ist October, 1849.
About the end of 1854 the committee purchased the lease of
the premises known as the “ City of London Literary Institution,
Alclersgate street,” in which place the association is now carried on
with full vigour and great success; every succeeding’ year giving-
increasing evidence of its great usefulness.
I have given this brief sketch of the association, hut it woidd
he altogether incomplete did I omit to state that, so early as
January, 1845, branches were commenced, in order that young
men in other parts of the metropolis should share advantages in
common with those of the city. The first of these was the West
branch, founded 16th January, 1845, the meetings in connexion
with which, were held in the School-room of the Scots Church,
Swallow street, Piccadilly • this was followed by branches in the
Borough, East (or Whitechapel), Islington, Pentonville, Padding-
ton, and Kennington.
At the time when the Young Men’s Christian Association was
instituted such agencies were unknown. There might have ex-
isted a few societies of young men connected with Christian
churches, hut it was not known by the projectors of the Christian
Association that any attempt had ever been made to bring the
young- men of different denominations together, for mutual,
spiritual and mental improvement. The ground was untrodden—
there was no previous experience upon which to rely, or from which
to gather data. The enterprise was a noble one, and its first
efforts were watched with deep interest, not only by those engaged
in it, but by many who wished it well, but who declined to
commit themselves to any movement, the permanence and practi-
cability of which were somewhat doubtful. That small hand of
young- men who first gave birth and shape to the association were
noble and indomitable spirits, and deserve the enduring fame of
the marble or the page of history, far more than many whose
names are emblazoned there. But their record is on high, and
the great day of accounts alone can reveal the benefits which have
resulted from their efforts.
Mechanics’ institutes, and literary institutions, had been in active
and successful operation. They had performed an important part
in the mission of' the age —the elevation of the working classes.
But they were not sufficiently social on the one hand, and were


too exclusively literary and scientific on the other. When rightly
conducted they led from “Nature to Nature’s God;” but it often
happened that through the indifference of those who should have
taken the lead, the management was left to others who perverted
the objects for which they were established, and not unfrequently
scepticism and socialism “ philosophy falsely so called,” were
taught to the serious detriment of the young and unwary, in-
stead of that true science which is ever the “ hand-maid of
religion.”
The great problem of the age was, shall religion be dragged
down to the level of the ideas and principles of man’s selfishness;
in other words, shall the commerce of the world prescribe its
terms to religion, or shall religion regulate commerce. As it is
strikingly put by Mr. Binney, “ Is it possible to make the Best of
both Worlds.”
Infidelity and irreligion boldly asserted the negative, and from
the accumulated evidence which they brought, the host of illustra-
tions which they presented, in which falsehood and “ sharp prac-
tice ” in trade "succeeded, while truth and probity were unfor-
tunate, seemed to make it a hopeless task for those who would
take the affirmative. The task was an important one. None
appeared to have the moral courage to enter the lists, and the
champion was about to withdraw from the field a victor. It was
then that the Young Men’s Association appeared. Few in number,
—without the aid of rank, or fame, or name, —“ alike to fortune
and to fame unknowntheir banner incribed with the asserted
truth, that man was the better servant, the better master, the
better artizan, the better employer, the better man of commerce,
for being’ a Christian : That commercial and Christian excellence
were compatible. The voice came not from the pulpit ; it had
often been asserted there; but it was said “ what do ministers of
religion hnow about business f” It came from the shop, —the
counter, —the counting-house. The field was fairly and hardly
fought; but the victory did not long hang in doubt — Heligion
and commerce were compatible. The labourer at his humble toil, —
the mechanic at his work, —the shopman behind the counter, —
the merchant in his multifarious business, — the manufacturer
among his machinery, —and the ship-owner in his counting-house,
—could be “diligent in business,” while “fervent in spirit serving
the Lord.” It was possible to make the best of both worlds —the
Christian Association had successfully solved the problem.
But there was yet another question, subordinate, it is true, to
the preceding one, yet of great importance. Could the men of
business, and especially those who were the employed, attend to
business, and, at the same time, cultivate the social and intel-
lectual principles of their nature. No, was the all but universal
answer to the query. No ! “for attention to intellectual pursuits
will make young *men less fit for business.” No! said another
class, “ for give young men more time at their disposal, and they
will spend it in dissipation.” On this question also the association
ventured to join issue, and after a full fair, and impartial trial, the


almost unanimous verdict has been given against the soundness of
the first objection, while the second has been declared to he a
calumny and a libel!
The field which Young* Men’s Associations found open and un-
occupied was that which lay between the Mechanics’ Institute and
the Church. These were looked upon, in many instances, as an-
tagonistic. They should not have been so; for science should he
u the handmaid of religion.” Could they he brought nearer toge-
ther? Could men—Christian men—be induced to regard each
other as brethren in Christ, and, putting their peculiar religious
views in abeyance, meet on the broad basis of our common Chris-
tianity ? And, further, could they he induced to rid themselves
of the narrow prejudices which many of them held, and look upon
literature, science, and art as not antagonistic to religion ? And
could the devotee of science, literature, and art, condescend to
meet the humble and unpretending Christian man, and thus seek,
each of them, to understand one another better ? It was said to
he impossible; —it has been proved to be possible! And the social
meetings, —the friendly intercourse, —the Christian companionships,
—the literary tastes, —the scientific inquiries,—which have been
formed and promoted by Young Men’s Associations, have demon-
strated the practicability of uniting religion with social and intel-
lectual pursuits.
The objects at which these associations aim are twofold :—the
preservation of young men from vice, and the assisting them in
the acquirement of virtue. The former is sought to be accom-
plished by leading them from scenes of temptation and from evil
associations —the latter by helping them to form safe and profit-
able companionships,—by making the path to intellectual pursuits
smooth and pleasant,—by teaching them the dignity of their na-
ture, and the awfulness of their destiny,—by making the hall of
science the vestibule of the temple, and the social re-union the
introduction to Christian communion.
The agencies employed for the accomplishment of these objects
are Devotional Meetings, Classes for the Study of the Bible, Sci-
ence, and Letters, the reading and discussion of Essays, the deli-
very of Lectures ; in fine, the adoption of any methods really cal-
culated to elevate and bless man.
And what a harvest of good has sprung up from the seed sown !
Twelve years ago fourteen young men formed the first Young
Men’s Association. The infant has grown so marvellously, that
though so youthful in years, it is a fully developed man ; taking
his position side by side with the great societies of the metropolis,
inferior to none of them in the deep interest it creates. And the
society, though so young, has been a fruitful parent, and can point
thankfully to many lusty sons in Great Britain and Ireland, most
towns and cities in England possessing a vigorous scion from this
parent stock. Some of the provincial children almost rival the
parent himself in the magnitude of their proportions, the energy of
their action, and the success of their operations. Thousands of
young men in various parts of our fatherland, are enrolled as mem-


bers of Young- Men’s Associations, tens of thousands have beer
benefited by their instrumentality, and hundreds of thousands ar<
reached by their published lectures.
How many have been saved by the fostering- care of these socie-
ties from the paths of vice and depravity; how many attractec
from the tavern, the theatre, the g-aming--table, the house of in-
famy ; how many incited to the cultivation of their mental anc
moral natures; how many led to the Saviour and the church; anc
how many to the realms of eternal blessedness; —cannot now b<
told, but will be known in u that day.”
Young Men’s Associations have not been confined to the lane
of their birth, but have been planted and have taken deep root ii
America. In many of the most important cities of the Unitec
States’, Associations exist, and are characterised by the energy o
the American people. The following* extracts from the “Nationa
Magazine,” an American publication, will, I am sure, be felt t<
be deeply interesting :
“ We take pleasure in reminding the young* men into whose hand:
this magazjpe may fall, of the formation of “ Young Men’s Chris-
tian Associations ” in several parts of the country. The associa-
tion in this city has commenced its career with spirit and promise
Its rooms are at 659 Broadway. The association in Boston has
advanced rapidly. It now has the finest hall in that city, fur-
nished with genuine elegance, and supplied amply with periodicals
Its library is also rapidly augmenting.
“ An association, we observe, has been formed recently in the city
of Washington ; and we doubt not that similar institutions wil
soon be organized in all our principal cities.
“ This most interesting provision for our young men originated ir
the example of the London Young Men’s Christian Association—
an institution which now occupies a commanding place among the
religious schemes of the English metropolis. Besides a wel
supplied library and reading-room, it has in the same building s
spacious hall for lectures, a salon for conversation, an apartmenl
for refreshment, well guarded against intemperance, bath-rooms.
&c. The Christian young men of various denominations find ii
a capital substitute for the ordinary clubs and similar resorts. Ah
persons who are considered entitled to membership are considered
also entitled to each other’s confidence and friendship. Important
acquaintances are thus formed, tending to both the social and
business advantages of the members. Young men from the
country especially find it a favourable resort, as it affords them
intellectual and social entertainment, and valuable introductions to
the safest society.
“We hope our American associations will soon be able to pro-
vide all the conveniences, and even luxuries, of their London
model. Every innocent attraction should be given to the scheme.”
The Rev. Dr. Ferris, in an address at the organisation of the


New York Association; spoke in the following warm terms of the
project: —
« The blessing of many a young man will be yours—the blessing of many
a family, from which the young stranger comes, will be yours—the bless-
ing of many a pastor, over whose young men you exercise your liberal
enlightened influence, will be yours. We shall all bless you; for you will
lead on to usefulness many who will take their place by the side of those
who come here as stranger lads, but are now the pillars of our churches
I have spoken of many ruined, but we should not forget that multi-
tudes of those who came here to ‘seek their fortunes,’ strangers, friend-
less, almost penniless, are now our most worthy citizens —ornaments of piety
—the reliance of all our benevolent societies, —the actors and liberal pro-
moters of all useful enterprises and improvements. The fact is a striking
one, that the once strangers and their children are the life of our city, as
they are most amazingly the majority. May you have the privilege of adding
many to this number, and with even a more consecrated influence. Nat.
Mag., vol. i., p. 472 (1852).”
“ Association for mutual improvent is the feature of the times. In several
of the city (Boston) and suburban churches an experiment has been tried with
marked success. A society for social and intellectual culture has been insti-
tuted, open to all the members of the congregation, with certain moral restric-
tions. Its office is to secure the development of the social affections, to encou-
rage thoughtfulness, to provide for the sick and poor, and to gather children
into the Sabbath School. Lectures, discussions, conversations, and music varied
to save from monotony, and previously arranged by appointed officers, render
one evening in a fortnight a means of peculiar profit and unalloyed pleasure.
A very lively social feeling is secured throughout the society; successful
enterprises for doing good are originated; valuable mental discipline is at-
tained, while the expense and small talk that are the almost indispensable
attendants upon a church benevolent society is avoided.”— Nat. Mag. vol. iv.
p. 93 (1854).
Young Men’s Associations in this land have not, so far as my
information goes, been generally successful. The past few years
have been so peculiar, and the influences at work so unfavourable
to mental culture, that few projects, aiming at intellectual or
moral improvement, have prospered. The exciting nature of
men’s engagements, —the insane speculation which has been so
rife, —the engrossing cares to which men have given themselves
up;—the rude and uncomfortable mode of life to which many
have abandoned themselves, —and the very general prevalence of
vice and ungodliness, have proved such a formidable list of
obstacles, that almost every effort of science and religion to culti-
vate the understanding, and affect the heart, has been in vain.
What these have failed to effect the Allwise Disposer of events has
accomplished in another way. Reckless speculation has brought
its own cure. The intemperate race for gold has, by its own
reaction, sobered its victims. All have learned lessons of wisdom
and economy from the past; and it is to be hoped that most will prac-
tise the experience so dearly and painfully bought. In the return
of general prosperity with which we are now favoured, it is of the
last consequence we should remember, that the true greatness of
any people depends upon the cultivation and practice of virtue, and
religion. Every right-minded man should remember that he has
a mission in the world, and standing in the midst of society,


strewed with the moral wreck and ruin of multitudes, —with a
vivid apprehensions of its evils and dangers, and with a deep
wrought conviction of his individual duty , he should swear alle-
giance to his Maker, and solemnly vow , by his aid, to do what one
man can do to elevate and save his country , and drive from her
sunny skies and fertile soil, vice and ungodliness. And, having
made this resolve, he should manfully persevere in his duty!
There is an awfulness, a sublimity, a fascination about the
future, which makes some men dread its contemplation, whilst it
allures others onwards to foolish speculation, and reckless prog-
nostications. Ido not assume to be a prophet, nor to be able to
look further into the future than an ordinary mortal. I have no
desire to lift the veil, which our wise and benevolent Creator has
hung before the future. I have implicit confidence in the power
of physical, mental, and moral truth. I have no apprehensions as
to the ultimate result of the g’rand conflict which wages between
truth and error. lam not alarmed, albeit the vantage may seem
often to be on the side of error. It will not always be so • it is
less so now than in the past. Truth may sometimes retire to her
“lines of Torres Vedras •” but it is not because she is vanquished,
it is only that she may gather new strength, and hurl her forces
with irresistible destruction upon the foe. Vice and crime con-
tinue ) but they are compelled to abandon their apologies. Infi-
delity and scepticism 'still evince vitality; but they have been
forced to shift their ground, and appear under new and more
specious names.
“ Error has had her triumphs in the past;
Truth’s are to come. In ages far remote,
Her light "was feeble as a glow-worm’s lamp,
But fed by noble thoughts and valiant deeds,
Eann’d by the aspirations of the wise,
Tended by virtuous hearts with patient care,
’Mid cold and darkness and tempestuous wrong,
Bose higher and glowed clearer, until now—
When, like a beacon on a mountain top,
Seen of the nations, it illumes the world.
Truth was a snow-flake on a precipice
In the far-off cold summits of the past,
Which fell; and falling gathered strength and bulk
To fall again more heavily, and roll
Adown the slope of time. ’Tis rolling now,
Huge as an avalanche; and in the air
The whizzing, and the roaring, and the crash
Of its great progress may be heard afar.”
What shall the future of this land be ? is a question of the
deepest moment to us, and to the whole world—a question the so-
lution of which is in the hands of its people ! I would not have
you be insensible to its political constitution • —as citizens and elec-
tors, act your parts and fulfil your trusts with a steady view to its
present and future weal. But it is in reference to its social and
moral condition that I ask the question. Most of us—if not all—


have made this our adopted land. In it our children and relatives
will live when we have passed away. Tens of thousands of our
countrymen, as well as multitudes from other nations, will flock
to these shores. Australasia must he a great empire !—shall she
be a blessing, or a curse to the world ? Remember, Australia—
Victoria —will be what you —the present generation—make her ; —
rich in commerce and in crime —the land in which to make money,
but not to remain and live in: or blessed with a virtuous and
happy people attached to its soil, educated, religious, and exhibi-
ting the characteristics of that righteousness which “ exalteth a
nation^
When an African Prince sent an embassy, with costly presents,
to the Queen of Great Britain, and asked her in return to tell him
the secret of Eng-land’s greatness and England’s glory, our beloved
Queen sent him, not the number of her fleets or her armies, the
cost of her crown jewels, or the details of her commerce, but she
sent him a beautifully bound copy of the Bible, and said, “ this
is the secret of England’s greatness !”*
No Englishman will ever forget the memorable day when Bri-
tain’s greatest Admiral hung out from his ship the signal, “ England
expects every man to do his duty,” nor will he ever cease to re-
member how nobly that signal was answered. There are other
times and other scenes when the same demand is made, and the
true patriot is called upon to enter the battle field, take his share
in the conflict, range himself on the side of virtue, and conquer or
die in her service. Such a time is the present, —such a scene, this
land. Behold its present condition ; think of its capabilities; view
its geographical position; ponder its almost fabulous mineral
wealth; reflect upon its almost magic progress; gaze upon its
intemperance —its impurity—its open profanation of the Sabbath;
look forward to its future destiny for good or evil, and then take
your stand either for truth or error —for virtue or vice , —but for-
get not that Victoria expects you to do your duty !
There are signs of hopefulness in the land. They are multi-
plying, and the influence of the wise and virtuous are being felt.
Let us unite with them and strengthen their hands. The dawn of
a brighter day is streaking the horizon. Moral and religious in-
fluences have not been exerted in vain; the cloud may yet be no
larger than a man’s hand, but it will spread until its showers shall
fertilize the entire moral soil.
I look with pleasure upon the organisation of this society. I
trust that it is but the beginning of similar associations in other
parts of our land, and especially on other gold-fields. I trust this
society will accomplish the most sanguine hopes of its projectors.
The omen of this evening is for good; and most heartily do I
adopt the language of the gifted transatlantic poet and apply his
eloquent words to our adopted land:—
* Speech of the Rev. Cannon Stowell, at the Manchester and Salford
Bible Meeting, October, 23rd, 1853.


“ Sail on, Victoria, strong and great ;
Humanity, -with all its fears,
With all the hopes of future years,
Is hanging breathless on thy fate!
* * * *
Fear not each sudden sound and shock,
’Tis of the wave and not the rock;
’Tis hut the flapping of the sail,
And not a rent made by the gale!
In spite of rock and tempest roar,
In spite of false lights on the shore,
Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea!
Our hearts our hopes are all with thee,
Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,
Our faith triumphant o’er our fears,
Are all with thee—are all with thee !”
