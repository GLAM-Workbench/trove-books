Paris the Prince and Relen the fair
OR
THE GIANT HORSE AND THE SIEGE OF TROY.
SCENE 1—Exterior of the Palace of Menelaus, King
of Sparta, on the hanks of the Eunrotas. A hand-
some Phrygian galley moored alongside the
landing-place. As the curtain rises, lively dance
music (" Festa di Ballo”) is heard proceeding from
the Palace, which is lighted up as for a festival.
Enter Hymen, equipped for a journey ; he carries in Jus hand
his lighted torch.
Hy. This is no place for Hymen, god of marriage—
My wrongs they scoff at, and my rites disparage.
[Extinguishes torch
But two months wed—nay, not so much —not two—
So excellent a king (’twixt me and you)
As was to this snob Paris with his chatter,
As—let me see— my par lent to his hatter. [Earns within
Those horns, poor Menelaus! It’s too bad—
I m off _ [going
Enter Cupid, from palace.
Cup. ( calling) Hi, man! hallo, man ! Hymen, lad!
Hy. By Jove, here’s Cupid, that eternal worry.
(to Cupid ) What do you want with me ? I’m in a hurry.
Why, you’ve been drinking F «.
Cup- _ Yes ; success to love!
Don’t get into a huff. *
Hy. I! in— enough.
Cup. What’s up, old fellow ? " '
Hy. Do not this hlanched^cheek,
This travelers’ toggery, for themsefves speak ?
Doesn’t this mug pitch a sad yarn ?
Cup. {aside) I spot.
{aloud) Bravo ! mug! pitcher! {aside) What jug-antic rot.
{aloud) I see j you needn’t any more explain.
(aside) That pallid mug’s not like his poor silly ain.
{aloud) That railway rug and valise seem to say,


Tn rugged language, veil he's going away.
You’re going off?
Hy. These goings on, you see,
Don’t suit a steady-going file like me.
Oup. A steady-going what ? Oh, stop your blowing.
You’ll be returned if you’re as Teddy Cohen,
And leave I in the lurch.
Ily. Ah, how diverting!
The King in Crete, the Queen with Paris flirting.
Oup. To put this interesting case compactly,
While he’s in that Crete, she’s in-dis-creet ?
By. ’Xactly.
It’s shocking.
Cup. Come, old chap, don’t be a blockhead.
Hr. My hair stands all on end.
Cup. I see your shock head.
Hy. Cupid, good-bye.
Cup. Good-bye, if you must go.
(aside) Though you’re my colleague, I must say you’re slow.
.Still fast and slow combine when there’s one pay-day—•
Don’t wo find Langton chumming with O’Grady ?
Duet. —Air— La Belle Helene.
Hy. Then adieu to Lacedsemon ;
Beauteous Helen, too, farewell;
And, although you’ve put the steam on,
May your loveliness wear well.
Cup. There’s no fear, sir, while I’m here, sir.
Day and night, in sun and shade,
Her complexion and affection
Xever shall be on the fade.
Gold her hair is—
Hy. Fresh from Paris.
Cup. Posy cheeks—
Hy. The carmine’s hue.
Cup. , Eyes of violet—
Hy. Trick of the toilet.
Cup. Ivory teeth—
Hy. And nearly new.
Cup. Lips like corals—
Hy. And what morals!
Cup. And a figure like a queen’s.
Hy. Incorrect, sir,
Both. Recollect, sir,
That I’ve been behind the scenes.
[Dance, and exit Hymen


Cup. Now then to play my rosy little game.
Paris and Helen shall exalt my name :
Love rules the court, the camp, the grove, they say,
And they shall add, Love rules the right-o'-way.
Lo! where they come. [Music. Cupid looks off
'Enter Paris and Helen, from the palace.
My work I see’s half done.
Paris, (to Helen) Shall Ibe lunny ?
Hel. Ho, I’m tired of fun.
Par. Will you have music ?
Hel. Tired of music too.
Par, Some ground and lofty tumbling shall Ido ?
My double summersets I think you’ll praise ;
Or shall I gyrate on the light trapeze—
One flip-flap ?
Hel. Ho, I’m tired of acrobatics.
Par. Croquet —three up ?
Hel. I think not.
Par. Well, aquatics ?
(quickly) Cat’s cradle, logarithms, chess, conchology,
Kiss-in thc-ring, billiards, or palaeontology?
Victorian politics, perhaps they’d divert you ?
Hel. Murder! go from me, homicide.
Par. What’s hurt you ?
Why send me from a side I love so well,
My Helen ?
Hel. Go! I’m married.
Par. That’s mp. knell. , /
Let me recite
Hel. O dear, Hm-Ps -drradful-xvori. ///& £> J
Par. The maiden speech of Mr. fotrrj-Heurke-? C/V
Or shall I read ? —now what d’ye say—condense
The famous six weeks’ Toorak correspondence ?
Hel. Certainly not. Oh, cease, you horrid tease.
Par. Too trivial, p’raps (she isn’t hard to please).
Hel. Ah, do please shut up.
Cup. Humph! I’ll interfere.
Par. You are /hfigued ; lean on me.
Hel. • O dear, dear!
I’m so ennuyee.
Par. So I knew ye were.
Hel. I’m tired of everything on earth, I swear.
Paris. This palace ?
Hel. Yes.


Paris. These grounds, so neat and trim ?
Your husband P
Hel. Lor, I’m very tired of him.
Ask me no more, but do please Clymene summon.
Paris. And who is Clymene ?
Hel. My tiring woman.
But no ; I’m tired of being attired.
Cup. (aside) Walker!
Paris. Nautical fellows would call that a caulker.
Of her veracity I’ve got a big doubt—
What girl was ever tired of being rigged out ?
Cup. (advancing) How do, how do ? Madam and sir, good day;
Do you want anything in my small way ?
Paris. Preposterous cad. [Stasis Paris on the bach’
Hel. Low fellow, prithee go.
Cup. From such a prettg pair depart—oh, no.
Paris, (fiercelg) Depart, or—
Cup. What ?
Paris. Well, never mind.
Cup. What stuff.
Both of you know me: I’m the God of Love!
Paris.
Hel.
j Lor!
Cup. (to Paris) Shall I tell her your Mount Ida sprees—
The shepherdess CEnone ?
Paris. Don’t, if you please.
Cup. (to Helen) Shall I inform him about Theseus, eh ?
And Leda, and the Swan ?
Hel. Oh, don’t, I pray.
Cup. (to loth) I’m here to help you.
Paris. Thanks.
Hel. How kind of you.
Cup. I nced’nt tell you what you have to do
When love steps in —[Helen falls into the arms of Paris
I see I’m understood.
Paris. Amo.
Hel. Amas. [they embrace
Cup. That’s the indicative mood.
Hel. But is’nt this wrong ?
Paris, No ; quite correct, that’s clear.
Cup. (to Helen) Your case is quite exceptional, my dear;
.... ] Joal . ;] IR blame of turning that sweet noddle.
And you of womankind shall be the model.
Posterity will say she had her passions,
‘Jf'ZZ. Bike all the women have —for Paris fashions.


Paris. That’s rather neat.
Cup. Now, off you go to Troy.
Where is your gall-cj ?
Paris. ’Longside yonder buoi/.
TfilO. —Air — Man with the Indian Drum.
Cup. Then over the very salt sea,
We’ll absquatulate, you, him, and me.
Paris. And startle the sharks from their innocent larks,
And stop the gay porpoises’ spree j
Then come with me, love.
Hel. Yes, I’ll come
Anywhere, dear, with you for a chum;
Only talk pretty, do, and I’ll listen to you,
As long as my ear’s got a drum.
Together.

Hel. I’m afraid it is wrong for us three,
That is to say, you, him, and me,
To be going on thus.
Paris. Pray, don’t mate a fuss.
Your scruples are fiddle-de-dee.
Hel. But my husband —
Cup. Don’t mention him, mum.
Hel. "Well, I won’t.
Paris. ( enraptured ) That’s my own darling.
{kisses her) Nyum.
Cup. That’s iligant kissin.’
Hel. To you, love, I’ll listen,
As long as my ear’s got a drum.
[Ensemble as before
Air —Tin Ballo.
Together, (in unison) Then quick, quick, to our gallant barque
and spread the sails ;
O’er the sea let us flee, you and I, and him, that’s three;
Wig wig, wiggle, waggle, let the whales wag their tails,
While we laugh, laugh, laugh, and chaff, chaff, chaff,
And quaff the mild two ales.

Music, Enter Menelaus, Agamemnon, Achilles, Patroclus, Ajax,
Diomedes, and other Grecian chiefs.


Men. Welcome to Sparta, valiant chiefs of Greece.
Ach. A snuggish crib.
Ajax. Yes, freehold or on lease ?
Idiom. Pre-emptive right, perhaps ?
Aga. How did you git it ?
Pat. Under the fortee-sicond clause ?
Men. You’ve hit it.
Aeh. Well done, Patrochxs.
Men. Yes, the fact you speak.
And you’re Patroelus ?
Pat. Faith, I’m that same Greek.
Aga. He comes from Opus.
Men. All I hope as he’s
Not come from Opus here tor mopusses.
(to Pat.) So you’re from Opus ?
Pat. Iss, that is my faction,
Although I’m of Milesian extraction.
Aga. Patroelus a Milesian ?
Pat. Sure, that’s me,
Well-known from Cork-as-is to Donaghadee,
Ach. My bosom friend.
Men. He’s lucky.
Ach. Isn’t he like me
In height and figure P
Men. Well, the fact don’t strike me.
Ach, In age I’ve the advantage.
Men, Here’s a welter.
Ach. Though he is a Milesian I’m his elter.
Men. So you’re Achilles ?
Aga. King of —
Men. What ?
Pat. The dunce.
Well, not Achilles King of the Cafe once—
The mighty son of Thetis.
Men. That is right.
Ach. Two stone I’ll give to any man to fight,
Three hundred notes a side, a tenner down,
The mill to come off ’tween this here and town,
What do you say ?
Men. For me a mill’s no charms.
Ach. I’m to be heard of at the Butchers’ Arms.
Pat. Won’t ye be after fighting?
Aga. Where’s the occasion ?
Pat. An’ do ye ask that same from a Milesian ‘f
Where’s my shillelagh ?


Acli. Hush, Pat, you forget— ■
Shillelaghs haven’t been invented yet.
Pat. Then let’s invint ’em now.
Act. We rausn’t, really. s
Pat. {pathetically') What’s a Milesian with no shillelagh? \ \
Ach. A pleasanter fellow than with one.
Men. He frowns.
Pst. ( sulduedly) Murder and Irish, likewise tear and ouns, V
Thunder accompanied by turf —bedad !
Ah, musha, faugh-a-ballagh, Ballinafad. \ \
Misther Pat-roclus, don’t ye now be frisky, \ V
An’ I’ll go bail they haven’t invinted whiskey. \J
The hayth’nish times ! no blackthorn, no potheen ! VI
{to Ach.) Have they invinted ladies ?
Men. ' Gents, the Queen
Awaits our coming. Shall we now adjourn ?
{aside to Aga.) To see my Xelly anxiously I yearn. \
Let’s join the ladies, it will be such joy for ’em. '
(to Tat.) What do you say ?
Pat, (enthusiastically) The darlints ! Pat’s the boy for ’em. '
Men. Tin's way, then, noble chieftains.
[■ Going. Chord. Enter Hymen
Hy. » Hold, man! stay. \
Men. I know I’m old, but why the h, I pray ?
Hy. Ask me not whv —your wife, the queen, has—
All. What P
Hy. Has cut— '
Men. Her finger ?
Hy. Xo, her— \
Men. Throat ? \
Hy. She’s not.
Her stick, her lucky.
Men. I grow very faint. \ ’
What ? gone ! she isn’t, haven’t, hasn’t, ain’t. \ \
Hy. Paris is in the same boat. N
Men. I grow fainter .] \
Pat. The same boat! then she’s cut the canoe- bial painter, \
Hy. To Troy she’s lied with Paris.
Men. Oh, the minx.
Pat. She’s gone to troy to better herself, she thinks.
Men. She that was so upright, I fondly hoped.
Upright no longer—she’s eloped.
Pat. Yes, sloped,
Aga. [Revenge.
All. Hear! hear !


Aga. This insult touches all.
Forward, to Troy.
Pat. You shan’t have twice to call.
Whisht, Pat, ye divil, ye smills a shindy, boy.
Aga. We’ll be en route before to-morrow’s sun.
Cio Men.) Come, bear it like a man.
Pat. A married one.
Men. To mizzle thus with him was very measley.
Pat, Some men can’t get rid of their wives so easily.
All except Aga. and Men. Ha ! ha!
Aga. This simpering ain’t quite the cheese.
Pat, It shows that he has got their sympa- thies,
Aga. You’ve chosen me as chief.
Ach. Oh, I think not.
Aga. Your mem’ry’s treacherous, you have forgot.
Ach. I’m sure —
Aga. (to Ach., aside ) You have no cause to be alarmed.
But all these gents remember —and —they’re armed.
Forward to Troy, I say.
Pat. Ditto to you.
Apa. We will besiege it.
Pat. ' We beseech you, do.
The rapparces will cut ’em up like fun ;
\io Men) Up with your pecker, man, the war’s begun.
Come, bear it like a man.
Men. My brain is chaos.
Pat. At least you’ll bear it like a Men —
Men. “ . Alas!
Air —Hear It LUce a Man.
Pat. Adversity, you ought to know,
Is common, sir, to all,
My. But isn’t this a heavier blow
Than on most mortals fall ?
Pa', Philosophy should guide your life,
So pray its dictates scan;
Men. Put if you’d lost your only wife ?
Pat. I’d bear it like a man.
Cho. She’s gone away, we grieve to say,
With a chap whose hide we’ll tan;
But wives have gone before to-day,
So bear it like a man.
Air —Corporal Kelly.
Pat, She’s levanted and decamp-ed,
And away from him she’s gone,
With a Trojan, Trojan, Trojan, Trojan,


Chorus. Trojan, Trojan, Trojan.
Hy. And with this youthful sojer
Helen’s evidently sworn
For to sojourn, sojourn, sojourn, sojourn,
Chorus. Sojourn, sojourn, sojourn, sojourn.
Pat. But corporal punishment we’ll
Inflict on that young swell.
Chorus. But corporal, &c.
SCENE 2. —Apartment in the Palace of King Priam.
Music. —Instrumental Introduction to La Trnviata. Enter
CaSSANDUA, in a state of deep dejection.
Cass. Why do I weep ? tears arc hut sorry stuff.
Too*late, too late—that is—not soon enough.
I’d host explain, perhaps —T will—this is it:
Apollo loved me, paid me many a visit —
Ah, what a phiz it was! enough to win you,
It was so winsome—but to continue,
Phoebus (which is, you know, Apollo’s alias)
Brought me bouquets of sun-flowers and dahlias.
Says he, “ I’m very fond of you says I, “ Oh, sir.”
Says he, “ Don’t stand so far olf, nay, come closer ;
I want yon for to tell what present'd suit yer.”
“ No present,” says I, let me foretell the future.”
“ All right, you’re on,” says he (ray Phceous !)
And then he asked me for his fee a truss,
But I refused to let him blow a buss to mo,
And then my customer got cross and cust-a-me.
Thy prophecies, though true, shall be thought sLammerSj
The most unmitigated stiif—yes, crammers.
He gave me fils. I’ll go in for sensation —
But no, this scarcely is a fit occasion.
To holloa out my solid griefs were rude,
No, let me whisper them in soh’d-tude.
Air —La Tradata.
Some call this poor darter of Priam a tartar,
Some think her a martyr, a la Traviata.
The young gals they chatter,
The ancient ones patter.
“ Look at her, oh, drat her, she’s mad as a hatter.”
That’s not what’s the matter ;
Love these poor heartstrings continues to shatter.
That’s what’s the matter. \_fill's exhausted%


Air —She Danced Like a Fairy.
Oh, my heart it’s a breaking, I’m one mass of woes.
From where the wool grows all down to my toes,
For I’m nuts on him still, and I very well knows
That he doesn’t care twopence for me ;
He said my complexion was fair as the lily’s,
Declared I had beauty and nous,
But I served him as Ballarat served Duncan Gillies,
And in fact put him out of the house.
He danced like a very saltatory bird,
He did on my word, and you’ll think it absurd.
But I doted on Harwood, of whom you have heard,
And Apollo skedaddled from me.
[Dances. Fnter Cupid
I’m giddy with this whirling.
Cup. How do, dear.
Cass. What in the whirled, young man, do you do here ?
(. anxioush)) This place, this hour! I’ll call for help.
Cup. ‘ Be quiet.
It’s a’ right.
Cass. If it aint, I’ll make a riot.
Cup. Don’t waste that breath so fraught with music—
Cass. Fellow!
Music, indeed, I’ll raise a violent yell oh !
Here goes —
Cup. One moment, if you please.
Cass. One act.
Cup. Apollo sent me here to tell you it’s a fact—
Cass. A. fact I ha! ha!
Cup. You needn’t feel surprise,
~W&rcfastfrieuds, he and I.
Cass. In fact, al -lies.
Cup. He sends his best regards, and begs to say,
Your punishment begins from this here day.
You know his curse.
Cass. ( passionately ) Ah, beardless boy, shut up ;
I know his curse ! it’s you no whiskers, pup.
Cup. ( frightened ) He sends the customary greeting.
Cass. He ?
(sadly) The curse to Mary—no, the curse to me,
As it occurs to me. Ah, me ! oh, my!
I feel I’m going.
Cup. Where ?
Cass. To prophecy.
Cup. I will inspire you with a subject fit.


Cass. My country’s fate —
Cup. Look yonder, that is it.
Jftisic. The curtains are drawn aside, discovering Farls and
Helen in the galley. Panorama of the Duke of Edinburgh s
outward voyage.
Cass. Helen of Sparta, and eloping —bother.
And who’s her friend ? some super ?
Cup. No, your brother,
Paris, the Trojan Prince.
Cass. So ’tis, I see un.
But where are they ? that’s not the blue iEgean.
That’s not the way to Troy the Prince is taking.
Cup. Remember, dear, a prophecy you’re making—
The future route you see.
Cass. Let me reflect —
The future route for princes—
Cup, Quite correct.
Cass. Where arc they now ? at Malta ?
Cup. They’re passed Malta.
Cass. By the cut of its gib I’d say its the gut of Gib- raltar.
I see the rock.
Cup. Those British fellows lore it,
’Cos it’s a thing that other nations covet.
Cass. They’ll never guv it up if right I take ’em,
And ’twill be something difficult to make ’em.
Sure as two lifers make a tenner.
Cup. ( surprised , looks into the orchestra) Eh ?
Cass. I don’t mean fifers in the orchestra.
Cup. A band on that, what orchestra ? oh, say!
Don’t tell me that it’s Eliot York astray,
Or Cupid will giv*e up —he will, by jingo.
Cass. That York astray is only in his lingo.
Cup. Talking of tenners, here’s the pick, the chief.
Cass. I understand, the Peak of Teneriffe.
Cup. The highest in the world.
Cass. ( correcting him) As you believes.
{to audience) He hasn’t seen the famous tenor, Peeves.
Cup. Then it seems Peeves you know P
Cass. I do, my lad.
Cup. The father of the tenors ?
Coss. Yes, be dad.
Cup. I know as high a tenor.
Cass. A sire ! what one ?
Who is this higher tenor I


Cup. Tenner-son,
The north-east trade they’ve caught, amico mio,
Cass. The two ?
Cup. Oh, yes.
Cass, Well then, they’re up at Rio.
Rio di Janeiro.
Cup. What ?
Cass. Rid you ne'er hear o' that ?
In the Brazils.
Cup. Where they’ve brass heels /
Cass. You flat.
Cup. It’s there they have ’em, or in Callao.
Cass. They only wear brass heels in the ballet.
Cup. Oh!
What horrid hole is this ?
Cass. Hole—its an islet.
The waves seem ready, yes, to annihilate.
The fugitives, my interestin' coon , are
OIF the triste isle of Tristan d' Acunha.
Mark where the waves mount high as high Olympus.
Cup. I do."
Cass. And how the windy whirlwind whines and whimpers ;
The snow-white albatross (that ocean fairy),
The speckled chicks of the maternal Carey.
Mark yon lone mount. What, don’t you see it, eh ?
Cap. The lone mount ?
Coss. Hot the Mount-de-piete.
But Table Mountain.
Cup. (pawns).
Cass. ( looking at him) Yannder's Table Bay.
Cup. Excuse my yawning; I was up so late.
Cass, (pawns ) Don’t mention it, you see we’re off the Gape,
The Indian Ocean we arrive at next.
Cup. Hot a bad thing in oceans—don’t be vexed.
Cass. She’s taken too much cyclone.
Cup. Who ?
Cass. The ship, see—
She reels like something drunk upon the dip sea.
Grlenelg, in Holdfast Bay—
Cup. In full regalia—
The first port of arrival in Australia.
Cass. First port of arrival, perhaps, wore cher,
But for a sportive arrival look ’ee there.
Cup. The Prince P
Cass. Yes, and his suite.


The little dears.
I love their gala smiles and gala tears ;
And see the heaps of flowers.
£j agg Flowers are there ?
Cun, Surely a land of flowers.
Cass. Of flour rather —
I call that wheaty.
Cup. A great country.
Cass. Yes, it s spacious.
£ U p‘ It must be very nice.
Cass. Andjfari-nacious.
Cup. With floral products I declare tis gay—
Gay as of Tahiti,
Cass. Tahiti f-loral lay. . .
Upon St. Yincent’s gulf they ve turned their backs,
And left its shores.
£j U p # Shores redolent of blacks,
Where the tall savage dares all sorts of breezes,
And whacks his ox-eyed yin whene’er he pleases.
’Tis freedom’s atmosphere —why you grin ?
Cass. An atmosphere, I say, of ox-eyed gin.
Cup Shame —they are our Hrrin colored brethren.
Cass. True *
Sweet errin b’roth’r, I think X smell ye noo,
Far in the distance, out of sight almost;
They’ve in spectered the shadowy western ghost^ —
Portland, of which fresh Butters is the deary.;
Belfast —
Cup. Once known as Eoutledge’s Port I airy.
Cass. And Wh.rrnam.bool, where folks insanely cater
For those who love and the pot-hater.
Cup. That’s vulgar, very—cast ideas of pot away.
Cass, (shivers) Icy, icy—l see, they’ve passed the (H)oi-ivay—'
They’re through the Heads like an idea.
Cup. An idear.
Cass. I didn’t say an idea of yours, my dear.
Cup, Lor, what is that ? , ~
Cass. A notion I ve imbibed
Of something which can hardly be described,
Except as representing dulcit puer,
gome thirty thousand pounds expenditure.
More sea —and now Tasmania they’ve run down-
Cup. Bun down — oh, but —
Cass. Oh, but that’s Hobart Town.
Cup. What mountain’s that ?


Cass. Mount Wellington, sweet brat.
I s’pose you think tv ought t'llude to that.
Cup. More sea and sky.
Cass. They skirt the eastern coast,
Perfumed with flowers and scented herbs, a host;
And aromatic plants, and gums, and holly,
Enough to make a rheumatic fellow jolly ;
Acacias, which the veriest Brute as is
Would never quarrel with —and fruit-es-is.
Wow mark yon lovely bay—’tis Sydney Harbor.
Cup. Oh, eafuzleum ;
Cass, {wildly) The daughter of the barber.
The vision ends.
Cup. Apollo won’t deceive you.
A our future route for princes ! who’ll believe you ?
Cass. And yet some future day, a princely boy’ll
Come by this route to —
Cup. Troy ?
Cass. Well to f Royal.
A hearty, honest sailor lad. Yes, while
I gaze around I seem to see his smile —
’Tis there.
Cup. Oh, this is too romantic.
Cass. Yes, call me cranky, if you like, or frantic;
Consider me a goose, an idiot, flat—
Ay, even Biudon’s very oldest hat;
But from what now I say I’ll never wince—
So here’s prosperity to that young Prince !
Again—
Cup. Look back again ?
Cass. The vision’s back—
The strong west wind is now upon their track.
And now a long, wide waste of ocean, boy.
They near, they’re nearer, now they’re here at Troy.
Termination of the panorama. Troy disclosed, and grand
tableau. Helen and Paris received by Priam and the Trojans
in the grand square of the palladium. Cassandra rushes
towards them, gesticulating wildly.
Cass. Hold hard! stop! stay! scaldings! et cetera! ho!
Troy goes to blazes or let Helen go. [ Great confusion.
Solo, Cassandra— Air, “ J 3 Scherzo.”
As curds and whey not jolly are,
And ginger beer is mild,
And no more suits a schol-i-ar
Than whiskey does a child.


As waxworks fire the youthful soul,
As lectures suit the slow,
You’ll send her back,
Yes, quick, ah, quick, ah, back,
If even pick-a-back, I know.
Chorus. Not if we know it.
Lor, don’t she go it,
Who can believe her,
Awful deceiver,
Stow it and blow it.
As curds and whey, &c.
Tableau. Cassandra in a state of prophetic ecstacy, all the
others contemptuously regarding her. Scene closes.

Ilec. She’s upset everything—stand it I won’t—
The insolent young hussy.
Pri. Hus — say, don’t.
Hec. For nine long years—
Pri. Of more than twelve months each ?
Hec. No more. Since first the Greeks began the siege
I’ve stood it —
Pri. Like a brick.
Hec. ( proudly ) A Trojan mother.
Pri. Trojans are bricks.
Hec. My feelings I can’t smother ;
She sneers at me, and scorns me.
Pri. Ay! and slates you.
Hec. She mocks me to my face.
Pri. An-dimit-aics you.
Hec. The mother of nineteen she calls “ old gal,”
Alludes to poor Cassandra as her pal,
Makes love to Hector, right before the eyes
Of his Andromache, all rule defies.
Pri. (aside j The saucy slut.
Hec. Pinches that dear Polriena.
There is no fixiri her.
Pri. (aside) The little vixen, ah !
Would I were younger.
Hec. I won’t have her here.
Pri, She’s only a kid —a little giddy, dear —
Mere giddiness, that’ all.
Hoc. Oh, guidness! gracious!


Each day shows men are call alke mendacious .
Priam. I hear a step.
Hec. ’Tis hers.
Priam. By Jove, I knew it
By the melodious creak of her Greek boot.
She comes, all smiles and chignon.^
Hec. ( suspiciously regarding Friam) I’m bad rather.
Pri. Her step comes nearer.
Hec. [aside'] But he’s her step-father.
Pri. How I adore her step.
Hec. [aside] Oh, that’s the caper!
That door step indicates you’re near a scraper.
Filter Helen and Cassandra.
Hel. (to Cass.) A prisoner? a Milesian ? are yon joking ?
Cass. I prophecy by this time that he’s choky in.
Hel. [disappointed] Oh, if you prophecy—
Cass. (tragically ) Apollos curse ; oh fate!
( colloquially ) I saw him quodded at a quodder to eight.
Hel. His name ?
Cass. Patroclus.
Hel. (aside) Ah, again I’m spooney.

Hec. That’s rather pert.
Pri. ( admiringly) I never saw a pertier.
Hec. (to Helen) I’m queen of Troy ; has ever that occurred to you.
Pri. Entitled to respect from king and courtier,

Nor the inevitable warrior to worry ysr.
Here one can smoke and think.

That he’s a pal o’ mine.

Oh, Helen’s eye has pierced my heart through,
Like a Palliser shot from a modern war gun;
Her smile is the sweetest I ever knew,
And classical Greek is her nasal organ.
Her step is as stately as any queen’s,
When I see her I think that my bosom will bust up,
Her streamers behind look like fairy reins,


And her train most effectively sweeps all the dust up;
Chignon high, golden flax,
Boots like my ankle-jacks;
Model in toddlin’, mincing, wincing;
Oh, Helen deary!
Of all the sweet faces of all the Greek races,
From Thessaly to Ballyshannassy, lads,
Helen’s the dearest —oh, yes I by far;
No wonder she are
The cause of the war.
Oh. sweet Nelly, Nelly!

Have quitted tvarfare and the wharf together
And gone to sea, favored by wind and weathe-,

They destined me for Heptune at a price
Which struck me as an awful sacrifice, *
So I withdrew this lot, and then they dried up,
Sailed with the tide, and left poor Sinon tied up.
They also left their giant horse behind,

Ah, I see the burning city !
And no fire brigade to hail!
Pat, Some one's there —I wonder who ?
P’raps old Bogy—oh, horror ?
Who goes there? ,
Cass. That voice—’tis well!
’Tis the voice of that bold swell!
Pat, Know you no more ? The time has come !
Whistles. A ladder is let down from the helly of the horse, and
the Greeks commence descending.
How is it, maiden, that thou art so dumb ?
Cass, With music other maids their friends importunes,
But poor Cassandra only can tell fortunes.
Pat, Four-tunes —a joke! ha, ha!
Cass. You seem amused.
Pat. I never was more serious.
[Motions the Greeks to open the gates of the city
Cass, You’re confused,
Perplexed and puzzled.
Ah, the cause I catches —
You’ve been a reading Buckingham’s despatches.
Suddenly sees one of the Greeks, and screams, then clings to
Pat., tvho struggles to get away. Gong.
Duo —Les Huguenots.
Cass. No you don’t, no yon don’t, don’t away from us go!
Pat. Oh, I won’t, oh, I won’t, won’t away from you go.
Cnss. No you don’t sneak away from us so !
Pat. No I won’t, &c.
Cass. Although to the Greeks we’re betray’d !
Pat. you’re


Cass. Yet our cry shall be still, who’s afra-id ?
Both. Not I, &c.
Cassandra clings io Patroclus, who drags Tier across the stage,
ala “ Valentine and Raoul.” Exeunt,
The scene opens, disclosing the city. Triumphal entrance of the
Grecian army, and capture of Ilium, Grand march and
tableau amidst the ruins of the burning city.
Chorus. — Air — Skedaddle.
Our drama being over,
We’ll all skedaddle, &c. ;
The fact you’ll soon discover —
We’ll all skedaddle, &c.,
But though the siege is o’er,
And finished is the war,
And though the Greeks, by their gay tricks,
Have won the Trojan shore ;
Yet, with your kind approval,
We shall recommence the fight,
And we’ll all skedaddle
Again to-morrow night !
