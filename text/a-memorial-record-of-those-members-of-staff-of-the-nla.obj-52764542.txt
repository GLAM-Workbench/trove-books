ROLL OF HONOUR
OF
The Commercial Banking
Company of Sydney
Limited
1914-1918


A Memorial Record
of
Those Members of the Staff of
The Commercial Company of Sydney
Limited
who served their King and Country
in
The Great War
1914-18


IN his address at the General Meeting of Shareholders in
July, 1919, the Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr.
George J. Cohen, stated that it was intended to erect an
Honour Roll in memory of those members of the Staff who
enlisted for Active Service m the Great War.
Owing to building operations and consequent office
disturbance this has not yet been possible, but when the new
premises now m course of erection are completed a handsome
bronze Honour Board will be erected at the western end of
the Banking Chamber in Barrack Street, on which the names
of all those members of the Staff who enlisted will be engraved.
As, however, it may be a considerable time before this
can be done, the Directors have decided to issue this record
in affectionate remembrance of those members of the Staff
of The Commercial Banking Company of Sydney Limited
who in the cause of liberty and right and with true self-
sacrifice and devotion to duty answered the call of King and
Country and fought m the greatest war in the world s history.
Many, alas! of those who went away made the supreme
sacrifice, and of them it can assuredly be said that their names
will not only be graven on the Honour Board, but in the
hearts of their fellow Bank Officers, and the memory of them
will ever be recorded with loving and grateful remembrance
in the annals of the Bank.
H H. Massie,
General Manager.
