PROSPECTUS.
The following Advantages are offered by this Company .
The guarantee of an ample subsci'ibed Capital.
The Division of one half of the Profits at the end of every Five Years
amongst the first thousand Policy Holders who are assured for the whole
term of life, in sums amounting to £5OO and upwards, by Tables No. 1,2,
and 3, and amongst the first thousand Annuitants who have paid £5OO or
upwards for their Annuities.
Note. —Every vacancy in the first thousand Policy Holders is filled up by the Holder
of the next oldest Policy who is assured to a sufficient amount, on the plan of the
Equitable Society:—in like manner in the first thousand Annuitants the vacancy is filled
up with the Holder of the next oldest Annuity Deed, but the Assured and Annuitants
succeed only to the vacancies in their respective class.
Ascending and Descending Scales of Premiums (see Tables 2 and 3.)
The option, to the Assured by Table 1, of paying two-thirds only of the
first five premiums, leaving the other third as a permanent debt against
the Policy, but to prevent such an accumulation of debt as, in a long
course of years, might diminish the value of the Policy to a grqatei ex-
tent than persons not accurately informed on such matters would antici-
pate, the annual interest, at the rate of 5 per Cent., on the unpaid thiids,
is to be paid up each year, along with the Renewal Premium.
To those who do not participate in profits, the Company offers as low a
scale of premiums as is consistent with safety.
The Policies issued by this Company, if assigned to third parties by
way of sale, or as security, are not void by the death of the Assured Life
by suicide, duelling", or the hands of Justice, so far as the inteiest of such
third parties is concerned.
To Annuitants.
To the purchasers of Annuities this Company, in addition to participa-
tion in profits , holds out the advantage of a much highei rate of Annuity
than can be granted with safety by Companies which make their invest-
ments entirely in this Country.
To Emigrants to the Australasian Colonies, this Company offers
the following peculiar Advantages.
No extra premium is charged to the Assured for the whole of life,
for one voyage out and home as cabin or intermediate passengers in ap-
proved vessels to, or for residence in the Australasian Colonies in approved


situations. Distance from medical advice, occupation in whale fishery,
or distant voyaging, will be covered by equitable premiums ; but parties
may proceed from port to port throughout the Australasian Colonies in
decked vessels of 100 tons or upwards.
Premiums on Policies wherever effected, may be paid at any settle-
ment in Australasia where there is a Bank authorized to receive the same.
Policies, whether effected in England, or the Australasian Colonies,
may be made payable in either by endorsement , provided the Assured
do not quit the country in which the Policy is made payable, without
notice to the Directors.
India , Ceylon , and China.
Tables of Premiums for Assurance on the Lives of Officers engaged
in civil and military service in the East Indies, Ceylon, and China, have
been calculated, and may be seen at the Office of the Company.
Premiums may be paid and claims settled in India.
The Premiums charged for Residence in India are immediately reduced
to the English Scale on the return of the Assured Life to England for
permanent residence.
The N. American Colonies and Cape of Good Hope.
No extra Premium is charged for residence in any of these Colonies,
nor for one direct voyage out and home.
Voyages to and Residence in other parts of the World
Are covered at rates as nearly proportioned to the extra risk as the infor-
mation respecting the healthiness of the respective localities will admit of.
For the profits to which the Assured may become entitled at each quin-
quennial rest and division, a separate Policy will be issued, which being
unincumbered by the payment of premium, will be an absolute reversion,
payable at the death of the Assured, and increasing, without cost, in value
every year, and therefore readily available for private sale or deposit, and
which the Society will always purchase on equitable terms , or receive in
commutation of future premiums on the original Policy.
For the profits to which the Annuitants may become entitled, an
equivalent additional Annuity will be granted.
Two Directors and one Auditor may be chosen from the Assured, and
two Directors and one Auditor from the Annuitants, thereby giving
them cognizance of and control over the disposal of the funds.

ASSURANCE OF ONE LIFE AGAINST ANOTHER.
(without profits.)
TABLE No. 9>
♦ A person, aged 35, may assure £lOO, in case of his dying before another person, aged 60, by an Annual Premium of fl. 12s. 2d,


ANNUITIES.
The Rates of Annuity offered by this Company are larger than can be
supported by investments made entirely in this country, and than are
offered by any existing respectable Life Assurance or Annuity Company.
These rates are however put forth by this Company, not only with a
positive assurance of their safety, but of their leaving a wide margin for
profits, in which the Annuitants (see pp. 4 and 5) will participate at each
quinquennial division.
The mode of improvement of Annuity funds adopted by the Company is
the remittance of them to the Australasian Colonies, where the investment
of them is superintended by a Board of Directors and Trustees, and
where the rate of interest must, as is always the case in a distant colony,
remain much higher than in the mother country.
The security of this mode of investment when superintended with that
caution which is secured by the arrangements of this Company, is illus-
trated by the fact that although its operations extended through the years
1842, 1843, and 1844, which were years of unexampled depression, no
loss whatever was experienced, although a rate of interest was obtained
more than double what is obtainable in this country.
The security of the Annuitants is further guaranteed by an ample sub-
scribed capital.


ANNUITIES (payable half-yearly) granted for
every £100 of Purchase Money.

TABLE No. 11. DEFERRED ANNUITIES.


ENDOWMENT SURVIVORSHIP ANNUITIES.
The annexed Table is intended to provide in a simple, convenient, and
effectual manner for the support and education of Children, on the death
of a Father and until the attainment of the age of Twenty-one.
It is particularly designed for the use, and is strongly recommended to
the attention (and serious attention will insure the adoption of the plan in
a great number of cases) of those who intend to bring up their children
to any profession which will not enable them to support themselves until
after some years of preparation. Those whose families are dependant
upon a life income, and who would wish that their children should have
the inestimable advantage of a good education , who feel well assured that
if they themselves live this object will be obtained, but who know that if
they die the means left at the disposal of the children’s mother or guardian
are inadequate to supply the funds both for the support of a widow and
the education of children, will find no plan so suitable for the attainment
of their wishes in those respects as the one now offered.
There are at this moment hundreds of professional men who intend to
send their children to college, with a view of their entering on some pro-
fession—Clergymen, for instance, who design their children for the
Church ; many such are in possession of incomes which will enable them
with ease to attain this object if they live. All such should ask them-
selves, hqw this object will be obtained in case they die. They have,
probably, assured some one two or three thousand pounds upon their lives.—
By such assurances they have, perhaps, provided an income for a widow
and adequate support for the infancy of two or three children, but how are
the large expenses of education to be obtained from such a fund. The
advantage of the plan now offered lies mainly in this, that by a compara-
tively small half yearly payment, for a limited number of years, he will
be able to purchase exactly what he wants—neither more nor less. The
Benefit now offered commences with the necessity for it (viz., with the death
of the parent), and leaves off exactly when the necessity most frequently
ceases : viz., with the death of the surviving child, or the attainment of
the age of 21, by which time it is expected that the Annuity will have en-
abled him to support himself.
A few Examples will elucidate the scheme and the use of the Table.
A Father, aged 32, may purchase an Annuity of £lOO (five times the
tabulated amount, which is £2O) on the life of a child 2 years old, the
Annuity to commence on the father’s death, and to continue until the
child shall have attained the age of 21, by paying down the very moderate
sum of £B. 16s. 3d., and continuing to do the same, half-yearly, for 10
years, after which the premium ceases although the benefit continues. A
payment of £5. 17s. lid. would enable a parent of the same age to pur-
chase a similar Annuity on the life of a child aged 5.
