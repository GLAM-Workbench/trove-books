RULES
OF THE
AUSTRALASIAN ASSOCIATION.
I.—The Association is styled “ The Australasian Asso-
ciation.”
IX —The objects of the Association are the promotion of the
social and general interests of its members, and of the
establishment on a firm basis of a friendly recognition
amongst Australasian Colonists.
lll._The Members of the Association shall be qualified as
under: —
1. Natives of any of the Australasian Colonies ;
2. Persons who arrived in any of the Australasian
Colonies under the age of ten years ;
and they must have attained the age of eighteen years.
IV. —Members shall pay an entrance fee of Five Shillings,
and a quarterly subscription of Five Shillings, in ad-
vance.
V.—Xn order to afford an opportunity to other Colonists to
give their support to the Association, such persons may
be admitted as Honorary Members, Annual or Life, upon


payment of a subscription of One or Five Guineas,
respectively ; they shall not, however, be entitled to
vote or take any part in the government of the Asso-
ciation.
Vl.—The management of the Association is vested in a
President, two Vice-Presidents, and a Committee of
twenty-one Members, seven of whom form a quorum.
They have power to make bye-laws, and to alter, amend,
or rescind the same as occasion may require, and such
bye-laws shall have the same effect as, but shall not be
opposed to, these Rules. They have no power to incur
liabilities beyond the estimated revenue of the Associa-
tion for the current quarter.
Vll.—The President and the Vice-Presidents for the time
being shall be Trustees in whom all the property of the
Association, real and personal, shall be vested.
VIII.—A Treasurer and a Secretary shall be appointed, who
must be Members of the Association, and who will be
included in the number of the Committee if honorary
officers ; but a paid officer shall not be a member of
the Committee, and he shall hold office only during the
pleasure of the Committee. Two Auditors shall be
appointed, who shall not be members of the Committee
whose duty it will be to examine and certify to the ac-
counts of the Association, half-yearly, and to report
upon the same to the annual general meeting of the As-
sociation.
IX. —All office bearers shall retire annually, but an interim
vacancy (occurring otherwise than as hereinafter pro-
vided) may be tilled by the Committee of Management
at their discretion. Retiring officers shall be eligible for
re-election.


X.—From and after the adoption of these Rules, any per-
son desirous of becoming a Member of this Association
must be nominated in writing by two members thereof ;
such nomination to be handed in to the Secretary,
together with a sum amounting to not less than ten
shillings. The name of the candidate shall then be
posted by the Secretary in the Chambers of the Asso-
ciation for seven days. The question of admission of
such candidate to membership shall be decided at the
next meeting of the Committee after the expiration of
such period. The voting shall be by ballot, and one
black ball in five shall exclude.' If the candidate be
elected, the sum before mentioned shall be paid to the
Treasurer; if he be not, it shall be returned. This Rule
shall apply in every respect to Honorary Members, with
the exception of the pecuniary deposit, which must not
be less than the annual subscription.
Xl.—The subscription of a Member shall become due on
the date of his election, and he shall not be entitled to
any of the privileges or benefits of the Association
while it is unpaid or in arrear. The payment of the
entrance fee or any quarterly or other subscription
shall imply a member’s acquiescence in the Rules of the
Association. ,
Xll.—The Annual General Meeting of the Association shall
be held on the first Monday in October, to receive the
Report of the Committee of Management, including the
Treasurer’s Statement and the audit of the accounts,. to
elect officers for the ensuing year, and to transact such
other business as may he brought forward for considera-
tion.
XIII.—The General Meetings of the Committee of Manage-
ment shall be held weekly, at the Chambers of the As-
sociation ; and Special Meetings may he held as the cxi-


gencies of business demand: the day of meeting to be
posted in the Chambers for the information of Members
generally. Any Member of the Committee absenting
himself from three consecutive meetings without a
sufficient excuse shall be deemed to have vacated his
office, and, at their next subsequent meeting, the Com-
mittee shall proceed to fill up the vacancy by the election
thereto of another member of the Association.
XlV.—The Secretary shall take full and correct minutes of
the proceedings and decisions of all meetings of the
Association and of the Committee of Management, keep
the records, attend to all correspondence, receive ac-
counts and vouchers, check the same ahd certify to
their correctness, and perform such other duties in con-
nection with the affairs of the Association as the Com-
mittee may from time to time consider desirable :
for the ensuring of accuracy, it is incumbent on the
chairman of every meeting to certify to the correct-
ness ot the minutes thereof, before their submission to
the next meeting for confirmation.
XV.—The Treasurer shall receive all entrance fees, subscrip-
tions, and other moneys for and on behalf of the Asso-
ciation ; and his receipt shall be a sufficient discharge
for the same. All such moneys shall be paid by him
into a Bank on account and to the credit of the Asso-
ciation, at least once a month. The Treasurer shall keep
the accounts of all moneys received and disbursed for
the Association, and submit the same, if necessary, at
every regular meeting of the Committee.
XVI. —Every payment for and on behalf of the Association
shall be made by cheque signed by the Treasurer on
the order of the Chairman of the meeting at which the
account shall have been passed.


XYII.—The Chambers of the Association shall be under the
direction and control of the Committee, upon whom it is
incumbent to promote the co-operation of Members
generally to make the Chambers attractive as a place of
frequent resort —by the collection of literary and other
works bearing upon Australasian interests, and of regular
files of the leading newspapers and periodicals published
in all the Colonies ; by organising, when practicable,
reunions for the consideration of matters of mutual con-
cernment ; and, by lectures, open discussions, or otherwise,
to impart information upon and to illustrate the history
and progress of the Colonies. To these ends, the Chambers
shall, subject to the agreement of the Committee, be at
the service of Members who may desire to form sections
or classes for their social, intellectual, or physical ad-
vancement. A book shall be kept in the Reading-room
in which any Member may enter, and sign with his own
name, suggestions for the furtherance of any object that
may he considered to be within the scope of the Asso-
ciation, to be laid before the Committee at every regular
meeting.
XYlll.—Visitors to the Colony may be admitted to the
Chambers of the Association by any two Members of
Committee for any period not exceeding one month.
XIX.—No books, pamphlets, periodicals, newspapers, maps,
&c., shall be removed from the Chambers of the Associa-
tion without the consent of the Committee. Any Mem-
ber injuring any of the property of the Association
shall make good the same.
XX. —The Committee shall have power by an absolute ma-
jority of votes to expel any Member of the Association
for misconduct, in wilfully infringing the Rules, or act-
ing in a manner unbecoming or dishonorable, or in any
way prejudicial to the interests of the Association.

be convened by the Committee upon requisition signed
by ten Members of the Association, stating the ob-
ject of such meeting.
XXII. —Any Member may resign his connection with the
Association by writing to that effect, addressed to the
Secretary ; but no such resignation shall relieve such
Member from the payment of any subscription or other
money due by him at the date of his resignation.
XXIII. —No Member retiring from, or ceasing for any cause
his connection with, the Association shall have any right
to, interest in, or claim upon, any property of the Asso-
ciation.
XXIV. —Whenever these Rules shall have been found not
to have provided for any urgent requirement, the deficiency
shall be made good by the Committee, who shall report
the nature of their provision to the next General Meet-
ing of the Association, when, if the same be approved
or confirmed, it shall be binding on all Members of the
Association.
XXV. —A book containing these Rules, together with any
Bye-laws passed by the Committee, fairly written or
printed, shall be kept in the Chambers and be accessible
at all times that they are open to the Members of the
Association.
XXVI. —It shall be competent for the Committee of Manage-
ment to make Regulations (consistent with Rules VI.
and XXIV.) under which Branch Associations may be
established in country towns throughout the colony.
