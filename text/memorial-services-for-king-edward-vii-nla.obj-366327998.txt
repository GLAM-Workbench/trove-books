Beneath the shadow of Thy Throne
Thy Saints have dwelt secure;
diai. A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone;
Sufficient is Thine Arm alone,
And our defence is sure.
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.
ff Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
p Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away;
From everlasting Thou art God, dim. They fly forgotten, as a dream
To endless years the Same. Dies at the opening day.
/ O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
dim. Be Thou our guard while troubles last,
pp And our eternal home. Amen,

TJLMIGHTY GOD, with Whom do live the spirits of them that depart hence in the
H Lord, and with Whom the souls of the faithful, after they are delivered from the
burden of the flesh, are in joy and felicity; we bless. Thy holy name for all Thy saints
departed this life in Thy faith and fear, especially Thy chosen servant King Edward, who,,
by the grace Thou didst bestow upon him, ever studied to preserve Thy people committed
to his charge in peace and godliness. We humbly beseech Thee, 0 Lord, to grant
heavenly consolation to Thy servants, our Sovereign Lord King George and Queen Mary,..

The sun gone down,
Darkness comes over me,
My rest a stone,
eres. Yet in my dreams Id be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,

Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.
f Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Beth-el I’ll raise ;
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee. Amen.
?, AMD PEOPLE .
our gracious Queen-Mother Alexandra, the Duke of Cornwall, and all the
E-oyal Family; while they mourn the death of one so dear, may they not
sorrow as those without hope for him who sleeps in Jesus. Endue us all
with grace so to follow Thy blessed saints in all virtuous and godly living
that we may come to those unspeakable joys, which Thou hast prepared
for them that unfeignedly love thee; through Jesus Christ our Lord.
THE BAPTIST CHAPLAIN will announce the Hymn-™
“Bearer, (Bob, to XEbce.”

6ob Save the Iking...
save onr gracious King,
Long live our noble King,
God save the King ;
Send him victorious,
Happy and glorious,
Long to reign over us,
God save the King.
Thy choicest gifts in store,
On him be pleased to pour,
Long may he reign;
May he defend our laws,
And ever give us cause
To sing, with heart and voice,
“God save the King.”
