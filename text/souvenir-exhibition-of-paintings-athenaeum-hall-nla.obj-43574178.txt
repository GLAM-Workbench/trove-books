SOME PRESS REVIEWS OF TOM ROBERTS’
WORK
Reynold’s 'Newspaper, February Bth, 1920:
His pictures from the Italian Lakes may be described as
poetry in oils.
•SMorning PoSl, February 7th, 1914 :
He has the poetic vision for abstract beauty, though he
never loses sight of locality even in his most transcen-
dent moments. His colour sense is in sympathy with
his visual outlook, and, in combination, they help him
to produce paintings with charming and dramatic mo-
tives that arouse thought and emotion.
‘Daily Sketch, February 13th, 1914:
When I went to see Tom Roberts’ paintings at the Walker
Galleries, Bond Street, yesterday, they told me the Queen
and Princess Mary paid a visit on Tuesday afternoon and
particularly admired a group of pictures of Lake Como.
Standard, February 9th, 1914 :
His work is cheerful in spirit, and careful, though not
laboured, in execution ; he is a good colourist.
Observer, February Bth, 1919 :
Unity of vision, tact in selection, and a certain tenderness
not untinged with melancholy, constitute the charm of
his work.
JVestminster Gazette, February 10th, 1914:
There is nothing of the common picturesque in Mr.
Roberts’ representation of the Lake Como scenery. He
has no effects of flashing colour. His pleasure is in grey
da}-s'when the lake seems to be dreaming, and the moun-
tains are broad masses of magnificent gloom.
‘Pall Mall Gazette, February 13, 1 914 ;
But Mr. Roberts’ work has its own distinction ; of deli-
cate colour and charm of tone. His design has a dignity
and a fine sense of space.

7 A Mountain Muster (59 x 59) W.R.A. - 450
More than once the great pastoral life of Australia
has allured the artist. The shearing scene, entitled
“The Golden Fleece,” in the Sydney Art Gallery,
and “ The Breakaway” in the Adelaide Art Gallery,
have won wide recognition. The “ Westminster
Gazette” wrote of the latter: ‘ The rising clouds of
dust, the galloping sheep, the frantic efforts of the
riders, the clean limbs of the horses, and, above all,
the fierce sunlight, are all rendered with a graphic
truth that makes the pidlure haunt the memory.’
The “Mountain Muster” belongs to the same
category. It represents a scene on a vast cattle
station in New England, about 40 miles from
Grafton. During the painting of the work, the
Artist converted a Mia Mia into a studio and every
morning had to ride 5 miles over mountains to the
scene of his labour.
