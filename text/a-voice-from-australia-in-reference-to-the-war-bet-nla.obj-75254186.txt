SOUTH AMERICAN WAR.
My Dear Sir: ?The New York Herald of the 7th September
only reached me yesterday, having, for the perusal of my son,
been delayed in Melbourne, so that I can but hurriedly express
to you my views about the article by the special correspondent,
as well as regarding our mutual friend Malinouski?s letter embod-
ied therein; and as you have built railways both in Peru and in
Chili, designed bridges and rolling stock for both countries, an
expression by you as to jvhether my opinion is correct, would, no
doubt, be considered as impartial as mine, interested, as we both
are, just as much in the welfare of Peru as in that of Chili.
The special correspondent's letter has evidently been very care-
fully prepared, and shows that he has gathered a great deal of
information through the medium of English-speaking persons on
the West Coast; but his not having interviewed Minister Novoa
and other Chilians who only speak Spanish, I fear are indications
of the correspondent?s lack of knowledge of the latter language,
a familiarity with which tongue on such a mission is indispensable,
and would have enabled him to reckon things up still better.
better.
Minister Novoa is, according to the Herald's ? special? charged
in Peru with ?sharpening and even instigating severities which
? his military colleague, Admiral Lynch, on the contrary, had
? done much to mitigate,? and it is hinted that ? Sehor Novoa,
? to strengthen his hands at the next election for President would
? not be likely to conclude peace but on terms unreasonably ad
? vantageous to his country,? whereas Stnor Lynch is represented
as wanting peace from motives of humanity. As regards Novoa?s
severity, you will find that it is only those who do not know him
that characterize him as a ?severe? man, and that the Peruvians
in Paris, as soon as he was appointed civil representative of the
Chilian government, in Lima, were the originators of the reports


of the terrorism, it was said he was sure to make the order of the
day in Peru, specially alluding to that, when Governor of Valpa-
raiso, in 1858 and 1839, he had, during the Gallo-revolution, or-
dered Captain, now General, Sotomayor to bring down field guns
to attack the barricades with in Valparaiso streets. It was, how-
ever, Sotomayor?s own plan to bring the guns and some grape-
shot down from the artillery barracks; but they were never used,
and were merelv intended for a display, partly to encourage the
soldiers that defended the palacio, and partly to deter the insur-
gents, who finally gave way when they saw the artillery coming.
This incident in Chili?s last revolution was by the radical and
liberal party in Chili made the ? cheval de bataille? of to attack
Don Jovino Novoa, accusing him of severity, reports of which
also spread to Peru, and were by Peruvian fugitives in Paris re-
vived and made capital of to prejudice the world against him,
when he was sent to Lima, while they carefully avoided to let
any one know that the real object of his mission was to be a
check on the military commander and mitigate any undue severities
attempted by the leaders of the army of occupation, a task Senor
Novoa was well adapted for,both owing to his kind disposition, and
to his 'prestige and tact, as well as on account of his relationship
with the Peruvian family of the like name. You know very well
that the appointment of Novoa, who had been a judge, ? governor,
and a cabinet minister, who was an old member of Congress, an able
jurisconsult, a man of calm judgment, and whose father had been
a justice of the Supreme Court, a man of real sangre azul , was
almost the best security the Chilian Government could give the
world, in general, and the Chilian people in particular, that matters
would be carried on in an orderly manner in Lima during the
military occupation. Knowing personally both Lynch and Novoa,
I cannot understand how the Herald's special correspondent could
come to the conclusion that the latter was the severer one of the
two, and I can only account for it by the probability of the corres-
pondent not being ?well up? in Spanish, and that he, therefore, has
been unable personally to form an opinion of Don Jovino Novoa,
but allowed himself to be guided in his judgment by persons who
had accepted as bona fide the mare?s nest of ? Novoa quelling a
revolution by firing on the people with grape shot,? and, there-
fore, ascribed to him every alleged act of severity during the


Chilian occupation of Lima, instead of applying to him for re-
dress, when needed.
But to hint even at such a thing as Novoa securing ? unreason-
ably advantageous terms of peace ? to serve him as a factor in
gaining votes at any future elections for President, is to me proof
positive that the correspondent has never been acquainted with
Don Jovino Novoa, who is specially known for his disinterested-
ness and his generous disposition. The terms of peace, moreover,
were not left to him to arrange, but they were dictated by the
Santiago Cabinet.
Admiral Lynch's statements I find, in substance, correct. Some
of them I will refer to when I deal with Malinouski?s letter.
As regards the policy of spoliation , referred to by the corre-
spondent of the N, Y. Herald , you will remember what I said on
pages 8, 9 and 10 of my little pamphlet, ? Mr. Clement Markham
and Sehor Garcia y Garcia as Historians." The wholesale employ-
ment of dynamite for automatic infernal machines, distributed all
about the roads, in the shape of saddles, hats, caps, watches, drink-
ing cups, match boxes, etc., and arranged with springs and detona-
tors, the ?explosive gig,? the ? mechanical bumboat,? the abuse
of the Red Cross Hospital, at Arica, to explode the electric
mines from, the firm belief on the part of the Chilians that the
Peruvians violated the armistice outside of Lima ; the circum-
stance of the Peruvians, after having lost the battle, still, from
the roofs of the houses, keeping up a fire on the Chilian soldiers,
at Chorillos, after destroying the staircases, so that the Chilians
could not get at them, and the tone of the Peruvian press, coupled
with a prolonged campaign in an enemy?s country, all were fac-
tors in causing the Chilian soldiers to give no quarter at the latter
part of the war, and, in my opinion, self preservation only caused
the Chilians to set fire to some of the houses at Chorillos. The
various instances that Sehor Garcia y Garcia refers to in his de-
clarations in the Times will, no doubt, be investigated by the
Chilian government, and, until the report of the investigation be
published, we are bound to suspend our judgment. As regards
Minister Yergara having said in Congress that he meant to crip-
ple Peru for a hundred years, we all know that what a Minister
says in Parliament, when he wants his estimates passed, is not
always exactly, to the very letter, what he means, and that in


the heat of Parliamentary debates, sentiments are not unfre-
quently given expression to which, in a calmer mood, would not
have been uttered; and, besides, after all, is it not always the
object of a belligerent to cripple his enemy as much as possible,
so that he may not be able to renew his attacks, or, in other
words, so that peace may be enjoyed for as long a period as pos-
sible? It is hardly fair to judge of the effect without investi-
gating the causes; many an empty hall and devastated garden,
many crumbled and blackened walls, have each a history attached
to them, or certain incidents connected with their destruction
which, when inquired into, will, in a great measure, exculpate
the Chilian army of occupation. The carrying off to Chili a few
trophies of the war, I can easily understand would have a good
effect, alike on the tax-payer and on the recruiting of soldiers ;
none of these matters can be judged correctly by an outsider, un-
acquainted, or only slightly familiar, with the two countries and
the people that inhabit them.
The levying of fees for Custom House licenses is, by the N. Y.
Herald correspondent, found objectionable and ultra' severe; but
he forgets that this very system has been in vogue in Chili for
many years under the law of patentes, and it is but natural that
the Chilians should organize the Callao Custom House after the
model of the Valparaiso one. A first class house of business
pays as high a fee in the latter port as in the former, and the
rate of assessment is left with the Collector of the Customs and
the Judge of Commerce, with appeal to a Board, if disputed.
The N. Y. Herald's special is afraid that Peru can never get 10
the front again, as a solvent nation, on account of Chili refusing
to pay her debts for her; but has it not always been asserted by
keen observers of Peru that the best that ever could happen to her,
would be if she were to lose the guano and nitrate deposits, so
that she might be forced to turn her attentions to the real and
lusting sources of revenue, cultivation of the rich products she
can grow and to mining? Once order restored, even if Peru
were only to exist North of Islay, money will not be wanting to
extend the Oroya Railway, get at the treasures of Cerro de Pasco,
finally reach the affluents of the Amazon, and find an outlet to
the Atlantic for the valuable productions which the plateau and
her Eastern slope are so rich in, while the Northern provinces


and the middle districts can immediately commence to yield
a revenue to the government of the new Dictator. 1 was in Lon-
don when the telegraph flashed us the news that the Novoa-
Lavalle protocol provided that Chili guaranteed the debt of Peru
to the bondholders; but lat once told the Chilian Minister that
I considered it utterly impossible that such could be the case,
and that the cablegram could only refer to a division of profits
on the sales of guano up to that date, and on the quantity of one
million tons of guano that was still to be sold ; and that function-
ary also immediately asserted the same as I, that Chili could never
consider it right to take upon herself the burden of paying for
Peru a debt of forty to fifty million pounds sterlings Now I see,
from the New York Herald , that we were both right in our opin-
ion. I consider the Novoa-Lavalle protocol fair to both countries,
under the circumstances, and I am fully convinced that, if the
Cabinet of Santiago had dictated such terms as Don Jovino
Novoa felt too severe or unfair to Peru, he would have resigned
rather than be instrumental in committing an act of injustice. He
is a perfectly independent man, and has been serving his country,
during the occupation of Lima, at great personal sacrifice to him-
self and his family. 1 don?t believe that Novoa will ever enter
the lists as a candidate for the Presidency; but he may, when a
vacancy occurs, become Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, which,
I think, would give general satisfaction, as he has no longer any
political flag, and is the ab est jurisconsult in South America.
One or two other points in the correspondent?s report, I will
touch upon when reviewing the letter embodied in his sketch.
M. Ernest Malinouski?s letter to the French Minister in Chili.
You will, no doubt, be surprised that Malinouski, who, accord-
ing to the correspondent of the N. Y. Herald , has not been in
Lima during the Chilian military occupation, but been an exile
in Ecuador ever since the dictatorship of Pierola, should have
committed himself to the ? ultra intense ? Peruvian view of the
situation and set himself up as an authority on Chilian affairs, of
which he knows nothing, never having lived in Chili, nor ever
having had any opportunity of forrninga correct opinion of Chilian
character, politics and finance. His letter, besides, adds one to the


already numerous instances of people being well up in* a special
branch, or in a special profession, but outside of that mere nin-
nies, devoid of any general information, and taking for granted
all what their friends tell them.
Chilian misrepresentations? M. Malinouski asserts, in no meas-
ured terms, that the Chilian Government and the Chilian press
have systematically misrepresented everything during this untor-
tunate war, but the world has already given its verdict to the
contrary, and we have the reports of Captain Albert Matkham,
R. N., not Mr. Clement Markham, the would-be-historian, G< m-
mander Acland, R. N., Lieutenant Madan, R. N., and Lieutenant
Leon of the French Navy, all impartial, intelligent outsiders,
giving the assurance that the Chilian statements are correct and
that the Peruvian press is entirely untrustworthy. Has M. Malm-
ouski, during his exile from Peru, never noticed that the steamers
would bring to Guayaquil, mail after mail, Peruvian official
accounts of great victories, on paper, which invariably turned out
to be defeats? Is he not aware that most positive proof was
found in the Lima archives of the past that the Peruvian Govern-
ment had systematically subsidized certain newspapers to circu-
late only news favorable to Peru, whereas no instance of Chilian
corruption of this kind has ever appeared ?
The Peru-Bolivii Treaty of Alliance? The existence of this treaty,
the Chilian Government is accused of having been aware of for
several years, although the Chilian Minister?s circulars state the
opposite, and although it is on record that, just before the war
broke out, the Peruvian Minister to Chili, when asked officially
whether any such treaty had ever been made, denied all knowl-
edge of it, thereby proving that the protoc d was even then a
secret. If it had been discussed in the Congress of Peru and in
that of Bolivia, as affirmed by Malinouski, the Blue Books con-
taining the debates could, at a moment?s notice, be accessible in
the library of the Chilian Congress, both to the Peruvian Pleni-
potentiary and to the Chilian Minister for Foreign Affairs who, on
the occasion referred to, demanded to know whether the rumors
of the existence of a defensive and offensive treaty between Bolivia
and Peru was correct, whereas if the matter were on record and
such a well known fact, as affirmed by Malinouski, there would
have been no need for the inquiry by the Chilian Minister, nor


?any use of a denial on the part of the Peruvian diplomatist,
especially when the Blue-Books of Peru and Bolivia could be pro-
duced at a moment?s notice. Let Malinouski say whether he
himself ever heard of the treaty, when it was made, and ?debated
on?! I can assure you, Mr. Evans, that although I was frequently
in various parts of Bolivia and. Peru for two to three years after
the treaty was made, and mixed with all the ? Doctores ? and
members of Congress, as well as with several who were in the
administrative service, and also knew well Don Adolfo Ballivian
who, it now appears, made the treaty, I never heard but, at most,
vague rumors or after-dinner talk to the effect that ?if Chili were
to put any pressure on regarding the dispute about the boundary
limits and the Antofogasta nitrate question, Peru would interfere. ?
The then Chilian Minister at La Paz, the poet Walker-Martinez,
has, after the outbreak of the war, incidentally stated in a small
literary sketch, that he knew there was a secret treaty between
Peru and Bolivia, and the Chilian Minister at Buenos Ayres states
he was aware that an agent from Peru came to the Argentine Gov-
ern ment to negotiate for a treaty of alliance, but did not succeed.
These are the only instances of any of Chili?s representatives hav-
ing stated that they were cognizant of the treaty in question. The
particulars, details, or the special object of the treat} 1- , however,
did not transpire, and the Chilian Government, no doubt thought,
either that it was still only a project, or that it only had reference
to a rumored purchase of some Bolivian nitrate fields, on the part
of Peru, whose Government was desirous of controlling the nitrate
and guano trade of the coast, and invariably had one plan or an-
other cm the topics then current, but to which generally not much
importance was attached, as the Peruvian projects generally ended
in smoke. The details of the treaty, lam sure that neither the
Chilian representative in Peru, nor the one in Bolivia had any
cognizance of. The then Chilian Minister in Lima is now in Wash-
ington and can speak for himself. The matter is brought foward
by Malinouski, to prove that the Chilian Minister for Foreign
Affairs was guilty of a misstatement when he said, in his circular
to the Diplomatic Body, that Chili had, only just before the out-
break of the war, acquired information of the defensive and offen-
sive treaty between Bolivia and Peru. I hold, however, that the


Minister?s assertion is correct and that a thousand Malinouskis
cannot disprove it.
Preparations for War. ?Malinouski charges Chili with having
been secretly preparing herself for a war with Peru and Bolivia,
for the purpose of extending her territory at the expense of these
latter republics, and states that Chili?s preparations for war,
though denied officially, were admitted in the Chilian Congress
by the Ministerial party, when attacked by the opposition and
charged with plunging the country into hostilities, unp-epared.
To this I must say that I examined in London the returns of the
Chilian Statistical Department when the ultra-philo Peruvians
made a similar charge, and I found that the quantity of arms
and ammunition that had been imported by Chili, from Europe
and the United States, in the five years preceding the war, was
utterly insignificant, and the correspondence of the Chilian Lega-
tions published in the Blue-Books prove, to a certainty, that Chili
was completely unprepared for war in February, 1879, when she
found herself obliged to assert her rights by force of arms and
face the two conspirators, who, it then appeared, had secretly been
in league ever since February, 1873 ; for those communications
show clearly that the Santiago Government, only after the declara-
tion of war , started telegraphing and writing for war material,
which, however, was very difficult to procure owing to the string-
ency of the laws of neutrality of Europe and the United States.
At the same time, Bolivia had confided too blindly in her ally to
arm herself and Peru had entertained too great a belief in Chili
ultimately yielding to Bolivia?s demands, to arm herself fully, so
that none of these three Republics were prepared for war; and
there can be no doubt about the circumstance that the mission of
the Peruvian Minister, Lavalle, who denied all knowledge of the
Secret Treaty, was for the purpose of delaying the declaration of
war somewhat and for that of giving Peru time to prepare herself
for the struggle, and was only frustrated by Chili?s decisive step
of sending him his passports and declaring war, as soon as the
existence of the treaty was found to be a fact.
The circumstance of the Opposition Party in the Chilian Con-
gress, availing itself of the lack of preparations for war to make
this matter a count in its impeachment of the Ministry, must
carry more weight with a true historian?not one of the Clement


Markham type ?than the lame arguments adduced by the Min*
sterial Party, who, in their reply merely ?generalized,? stating
that they had enough ships, men, guns and ammunition, to open a
campaign with, that they were better prepared than their enemies,
that the Chilians were good sailors and brave soldiers, their ships
as good as those of Peru, their credit better, and that the country
was far better able then to cope with an enemy than when declar-
ing war against Spain in 1865. The latter assertion certainly
was true, for in 1865, Chili?s delaration of war was quite quix-
otic ; her ports were unfortified, her infant navy had to go and
lay up in the Chiloe Archipelago ; she had to submit to a pro-
longed blockade and finally to the bombardment of Valparaiso
without firing a gun in return. This taught her a lesson, and she
fortified her chief ports, increased her navy somewhat, and started
a volunteer force, which soon got on the road to efficiency; her
regular army was, however, when the war broke out, 1,133 men
short of the normal strength of 3.573 fixed by Congress, whereas
the combined Peruvian and Bolivian army was 11,001 strong,
without equating 5,400 Peruvian police soldiers, and the chances
of recruiting were naturally greater in favor of the two allied Re-
publics 'with a population of 5,800,000, while Chili had only
2,155,029 inhabitants, and would have to carry the war into the
enemy?s country.
A few months before the outbreak of the war, the Chilian Con-
gress, as seen by the Blue-Books, had reduced considerably the
annual budget both for the army and the navy departments, and
the sale of the greater part of the navy had even been suggested,
the clerical staff of her then only Legation in Europe had been
entirely suppressed, and consisted, when the war broke out, of a
minister and his secretary, provided with a banking account just
about enough for their ? daily bread ? but not to execute any in-
dents for war material, as shown by the plain, straightforward
letters of Minister Alberto Blest Gana, laid before Congress in
Chili as an appendix to the memorandum of the Minister for
Foreign Affairs. Surely, the statesmanlike documents of the
Minister for Foreign Affairs of Chili ought to carry more weight
than the debating squabbles in Congress between two factions op-
posed to each other and who make political capital of anything
that may further the interests of their political party or may


please their respective constituents. This M. Malinouski ought
to have reflected on before hanging his hat on so slender a peg
as a parliamentary ?mud heaving.? You know enough in the
States of what ? Congress-talk ? amounts to.
Chili has from this war derived a good lesson, and will, no
doubt in future, ? to enjoy peace, always be prepared for war.?
She has gained the respect of all large nations by the energy she
has displayed during the war with Peru and Bolivia with an
army only 2,440 men strong, when the war broke out. She lit-
tle by little contrived efficiently to arm and drill her ? roios ? and
? huasos ,? and sent 60,000 soldiers into the enemy?s country, and
this without going into the money market as a borrower, at the
same time religiously paying all the coupons of her loans previ-
ously contracted for remunerative railway construction and in-
vested therein. ?In future, a war with Chili,? says the French
Lieutenant Leon, in his interesting letter to the ?Revue Maritime ,?
??would only be possible for England or France, and for them
only at enormous cost. Chili, in fact, will have to enter into the
calculations of any nation intending to undertake a war. * * ?
chili's motive for war.
The verdict has, long ago, been given by all the respectable
press of the entire world that Chili went to war on the one hand
because a solemn treaty had been bioken by Bolivia, backed up
by Peru, and, on the other hand, it became manifest that a de-
fensive and offensive alliance existed between Peru and Bolivia.
It was simply a matter of self-preservation and of policy, as above
stated, for Chili to take the initiative and declare war, although
she was unprepared, and had not half the population of Bolivia
and Peru ; but it would have been dangerous to wait and enable
Peru to contract loans and procure more war material. This
verdict Malinouski in vain seeks to upset by advancing the
entirely new theory that ?Chilian collapse and bankruptcy were
imminent just before the war, and her financial prosperity a
sham?her mines being exhausted, and her agricultural wealth
dwindled down to zero, because California and Australia had
ceased to be her regular customers at exhorbitant prices,? all of
which, according to Malinouski, ? Chili was to remedy by going
to war and taking some Peruvian provinces containing guano


and nitrate.? On this head I must say that if Malinouski brings
such a theory forward in good faith, it only shows that he has
never taken the trouble to study Chilian statistics, and that he
is entirely unacquainted with the country he speaks of so dog-
matically, while he takes for granted whatever fables the ?chil-
dren of the sun? stuff him with, none of which are more ridic-
ulous than the one that Chili, as stated by him, had found it im-
possible, just before the war, to raise a new loan in London, in-
stead of the fact being that Chili, although she only owes her
foreign creditors ï¿½d,974,333, has not been in the European mar-
ket as a borrower for m my years, finding the exchange on re-
mittances so heavy that she prefeis to contract an internal debt,
when needed, by issuing treasury warrants, although she has
always been able to get whatever money she wanted on the Lon-
don Stock Exchange, both owing to her hack hone and on account
of her punctuality with which she always has discharged her
financial obligations. London financiers know well enough by
statistics that ten years ago the value of the real estate in Chili
was ï¿½140,000,000, and that n-w with the improvements and
the higher value of land, it may be estimated at ï¿½200,000,000,
while the mineral wealth of Chili is incalculable; one single
mine, the Pique at Tamaya, having during the last few years,
yielded over ï¿½2,400,000 ; and the silver mines of Copiapo and
Atacama being now in so good a state that the ? Encyclopaedia
Britannica,? in the article on Chili in the last Supplement, affirms
that they aie ? recovering their former richness, the copper mines,
although much neglected, still yielding considerable quantities.
Financiers know all about Chili?s inexhaustible coal mines ; one
company alone, the Lota Coal Co., having an annual income of
ï¿½140,000.
They are also fully cognizant of the value of the Taltal nitrates.
The discovery of the rich silver mines in the Cachineal Moun-
tains; they know that gold mining is again becoming a paying
industry in Chili ; that her output of timber is considerable, her
agricultural resources very large and capable of yielding much
larger profits when the Concepcion to Tome Railway gets made,
with branches all through the Maule District, and when the new
Santiago railway via Melipilla is constructed, her income from
whaling and from the coasting trade, even in competition with a


large English line of steamers, is very considerable and well
known. Nobody knows better than the London bankers that
from 1870 to 1873, Chili got many millions of dollars out of the
Caracoles Silver Mines; all know that Chili supplies the entire
West coast of South America with fodder, beans, potatoes, vege*
tables, poultry, eggs, dried beef, dairy produce, and provisions
of all kinds. They are also aware of there being in operation in
Chili 1,102 miles of railway, the State lines alone being worth
ï¿½8,000,000, and carrying yearly about one and one quarter mil-
lion passengers, and some 600,000 tons of cargo, yielding in all
over ï¿½400,000 receipts. That a trans Andean railway is being
constructed by an English company, is also a well-known fact,
and that this will open up a still greater era of Chilian prosperity,
which will be further increased when New Zealand makes Valpa-
raiso and Montevideo her mail and passenger stations, such com-
munication also opening up commercial relations between New
Zealand and the South Pacific Coast.
People are also well aware that when Chili finally extends her
railway system to Auruucania, and gives her attention to stock
raising instead of merely cattle fattening, and goes in for sheep
and wool, her prosperity will be almost equal to that of Australia;
that she has cheap labor, a population about double that of Aus-
tralia, while she is not like Australia hampered with a debt of
about ï¿½110,000,000, all know in financial circles in London.
Chili's climate and geographical position and topography, one is
aware, are also better suited for agricultural pursuits than those
of Australia, the latter inland continent suffering from droughts,
and doing but little in the way of artificial iirigation and planting
of trees on the slopes of the hills that divide the main watersheds.
Chili?s 6,000 miles of State telegraphs also would enter as a factor
in the eyes of a financier, when making up his mind as to her sol-
vency ; but above all the positive, incontrovertible facts that her
national revenue has about doubled itself every ten years, the
Perez administration in 1866 having a revenue of $9,079,986, the
Errazuriz government in 1878 $16,"30,000, and Santamaria
showing in 1882 $39,008,219, and that Chili always paid her way,
even during the war, and not like Peru dishonored her coupons
long before the war, cannot fad to have due weight.
Chili, however, did not apply to the London money market, as


she considered she could get better teims in Valparaiso and San-
tiago, where the banks have an aggregate capital of about (forty
millions of dollars) $40,000,000, and where the Edwards, Cousino,
Goyenechea, Brown, Matte and a few wealthy families, alone, are
possessessed of $180,000,000, Chili counting among her sons
seventy-eight millionaires.
The financial crisis of 1874 and 1875 was caused by over-spec-
ulation in mining and nitrate by people who worked on a capital
borrowed from the banks, but did not affect the prosperity of the
country as a whole; money lost by some, was made by others.
The government had a fit of retrenchment on, reduced all the
military budgets just before the war, cut down the expenses of
the foreign legations, and practised all sorts of economies with a
view to be able to put on their next estimates considerable sums
for harbor improvements and extension of railways, when the
attitude of Bolivia, backed up by Peru, gave things quite another
turn, and provoked Chili into the present war, in which it was at
first, quite a ? toss up ? whether she would be successful or not.
Molinouski's assertion that California and Australia were Chili?s
milch cows, and that when they became dry, her agricultural
prosperity went to the wall, is only in keeping with the rest of
his statements.
I remember very well that from 1857 to 1875, it was quite an
unusual thing for charters from Chili to those countries to buy in
the market, and but only odd shipments were made now and
again, as speculations, many of them resulting in a loss ; but to
make still more sure of the matter, I called yesterdav on the
Honorable, the Minister of Finance of New South Wales, who I
knew had been largely connected with the trade in cereals between
Australia and Chili, and also had resided in Chili, to see whether
a regular business could be established in wheat and flour between
these countries, but failed in making anything of it but a fitful,
sporadic trade, of a very venturesome kind, only possible when
a failure of ciops took place in Australia. I also interviewed
Mr. W. 11. Eldred, of the old established firm of Eldred & Co,
of Sydney, who I knew had been connected with Dickson, Bar-
ker & Co., Consino & Garland, Melchor, Concha i Toro, and other
West Coast people in the cereal trade between Chili and the Aus-
tralian Colonies, and I had a chat with two Californians of the


?good old time,? while I had also fresh in my m?nd a conversa-
tion I had had with Sir John Robertson, the old Premier of this
Colony, some previous, during which the speculation that
occasionally had been carried on between South America and
Australia, came on the tapis. Reckoning up all what these gen-
tlemen told me, I can say that my own impression has been quite
confirmed in this, that the trade of Chili in cereals with California
and Australia never deserved the name of a regular trade, but
partook merely of the character of isolated ventures, commencing
in 1850 as regards California, continuing till 1853, and starting
with Australia in 1853 and lasting from two to three years, taking
a fresh spurt in 1861 and 1865, whereas statistics show me that
Chili has driven a steady trade with Great Britain in cereals all
through, sending the latter country f. i., in 1867, 2,097,976 cwts.,
and in 1874,2,207,016 cwts., while the United Kingdom, in the
like years, only received, respectively, 706,819 cwts., and 285,208
cwts. fiom the whole of Australia.
Australia may however, in time become a regular customer to
Chili in cereals, as the Australians are not satisfied with the
small profits of growing wheat, but prefer either maize or sheep
and wool. A work published here by the government of the
Colony on the industrial progress in 1871, has this passage :
? Despite the prolific character of the crop, the profit is small.
It is also a fact in relation to wheat and maize, that owing to the
mode in which they are cultivated, the growers become every
year less capable of withstanding foreign competition. The land
being cropped year after year, and neither manured nor properly
cultivated, its yield materially diminishes.? * * * ?Latterly the
farmer has turned his attention to more profitable crops.? ** *
? The wheat may eventually be confined to the table lands ?; * *
and in a prize essay on ?The Commerce and Shipping of Aus-
tralia,? published here in November, 1882, the Rev. 11. T. Burgess,
says, respecting the great wheat country, South Australia, that
?a cheap and careless system of farming is almost invariably
adopted,? The same author mentions as an instance of the un-
certainty of the South Australia wheat production, and the un-
certainty of the price that may be fetched, that in 1879, she pro-
duced 14,260,964 bushels, which brought her in ï¿½1,648,112,
while the next year she only had a crop of 8,606,610 bushels,


but which, nevertheless, left her ï¿½2,469,720. Again, General,
the Hon. Wm. Fielding, who owns extensive lands in Australia
and New Zealand, says, in the ??Nineteenth Century? for July
this year, respecting Australian agriculture, that, as regards maize
and other cereal crops, they cannot be made to pay out here with
the present heavy rate of wages, and that the Australian sugar
planter will have to resign himself to lose two crops out of five,
owing either to drought while growing or to floods during crush-
ing, as well as to the usual diseases the cane is subject to. For
my own part I consider that guano and other fertilizers are far
more resorted to on the West Coast of South America than in
Australia, and I should recommend the Chilians even to increase
the use of fertilizers, and to change their crops more frequently.
These matters may interest folks in Chili, as the new railways in
the Maule province, and the line by way of Melipilla, will, no doubt,
in connection with the present introduction of agricultural labor,
from Europe into Chili, enable her t* compete, in course of time,
very successfully with the Colony of South Australia, even in
Australia, especially in Greenland, as regards wheat and flour,
more especially if a higher class of wheat be introduced in Chili,
and better-machinery used in their flour mills. It is said here
that the Chilian wheat is too much like the Egyptian wheat,
having too little gluten. It ought to suit Chili to take part in
the next International Exhibition in South Australia, in 1885,
and study this question, and their energetic Consul-General, will
no doubt, draw their attention to this. The real causes of the
war, ?to return to our muttons,? were, however, far different ones
to what Malinouski observes, and are stated by me in my remarks
in the pamphlet above referred to. They are too well known to
need to be repeated here.
As regards the Breach of Truce at Mirafiores , I notice conflicting
statements on the part of Admiral Lynch and M. Malinouski.
There is no doubt that the Chilians believe that the Peruvians
committed an act of treachery on that occasion, hence, Lynch?s state-
ment; but it is equally certain that many of the foreign ministers
who had to run for it, when disturbed at their luncheon, think
that the Chilians broke the truce. I have, however, carefully
read the opinions of Lieutenant Madan, R N., and Lieutenant
Leon, French navy, and ? cross examined ? Commander Acland,


E. N., personally on this subject, and I am completely of their
opinion that the Peruvian outposts, during the truce, seeing
General Baquedano with rather numerous followers advancing
on horseback, mistook the Chilian staff for a cavalry skirmishing
party, and opened fire, other Peruvian pickets did the same, and
the Chilians unfortunately spread the word ? traicion ? (treason),
along their ranks, and opened a smart return fire, which soon
became general on both sides?one of those incidents which oc-
casionally may occur in a war, but which are to be deplored, and
for which no one is in reality responsible.
The statements made by the three trustworthy naval officers
named, one French and two English, will, to the French Minis-
ter in Chili, whom Malinouski addresses, be more satisfactory
than the account given by Peruvians, Chilians, and by some
foreign diplomatists, who were almost frightened out of their
wits, when the Chilian shells burst into their dining room, or
thereabouts.
Chilians and Chilian interest abounding in Tarapaca , I see
Malinouski denies, but it is a fact for all that. It was so when
I was there, the statistics I have not by me here.
Revenue derived by Chili from the enemy's territory. ?I don?t know
if Malinouski?s figures are right; but I can only say that whatever
it comes to in hard dollars, the Tarapaca and Lima revenue can
never be an equivalent for Chili?s sacrifices and sufferings in this
war, wherein she has had to train up non-combatants, make soldier*
of them, take them away from their wives and families, causing
unhappiness both by deaths and by the changed conditions in the
citizen-soldiers when they return home, not the least being the
fresh family ties they have formed in Peru. Whatever Chili has
got out of the enemy?s territory, everything considered, she has
well deserved. Admiral Lynch?s statement that, when all the ac-
counts are made up, it will be found that Chili has not made out
of the war what the parliamentary papers show, I think there iï¿½
some reason in. I heard the same in London, and you will own
that not only ought the actual amounts collected in Peru to figure
in the account, but also ?per contra? the cost of some of the
men of war and transports, the war material purchased, a sinking
fund for the pensions to be paid, a sum to capitalize the continued
increase in the pay sheets by promotion given to officers and men


in the war, the cost of the ?colonization-office? in Europe, some-
thing to cover the continual drain on the national purse that
probably most of the soldiers and the civil employees will re-
main for many years, as well as a sum to represent the falling off
of the national industries caused temporarily by the absence of
a great many of the citizen-soldiers, and, permanently, by all the
killed ones, apart from evil effects on society in general through
the demoralization that, on their return, will be found to have
taken place in the soldiers during this lamentable war. I have
had read to me letters written by the present President of Chili
on this very subject, and know that he, along with all good people
in Chili, which are legion, has been longing for peace for a con-
siderable time. The Chilian statesmen, one and all, have sin-
cerely deplored this war all along,
chili?s relation to the CREDITORS OF PERU.
The legal position of Peru?s creditors, from a point of interna-
tional law, regarding any territory which Chili retains by force of
arms, and respecting any revenue collected from it, is simply this,
that that part of their security has disappeared beyond a doubt, and
that the creditors must look to the rest of the Peruvian territory,
that not occupied by Chili, to recoup them for their advances. Peru
would do well to recognize the legal representative of the bond-
holders as interventors in the management of the national finances ;
and I firmly believe that if that be done, and the bondholders see
clearly in any ? reconstruction scheme ? a way to continuous
revenue, as I think they cannot fail to, there will not be wanting
money for Peru, from these very bondholders, to finish the Oroya
Railway, get out the silver of Cerro del Pasco and send down the
Amazon the valuable products of the great plateau and of the
Eastern slope of the Andes, while the Middle and the Northern
Provinces of Peru, are ready at once to yield a revenue ; and
they may, later on, when the Panama Canal gets finished, have a
still greater prosperity before them.
As the above is undoubtedly the legal position, and bearing in
mind the old quotation of ? timeo Danaos et dona ferentes,? I
have followed with great interest the negotiations all through be-
tween the bondholders and Chili, and have been able to come to
no other conclusion than this , that Chili was merely con tempering


and rocking io sleep the various committees and made certain conces-
sions, DURING THE WAR, when she was afraid of the enemy getting
money and means to fight from some of these committees , especially
the Paris one , hut I never did think Chili so ultra generous as to pay
Peru's debt; and on reading the report by Minister Alberto Bleat
Gana in the ? Meraoria de Relaciones Bsteriores ? for 1882, I felt
still more sure that when the war was over, the bondholders
would have to look to Peru, and not to Chili, for their interest.
A financial reconstruction scheme, with proper intervention, so
that the old bonds could be bought up cheap, and the Public
Works of Peru be finished, and become thoroughly remunerative,
I hope will be initiated soon, and that Iglesias Pierola, Calderon
and Montero, all will unite in one Ministry under English or
American Protectorate. The debt of Peru could be bought up
for ï¿½10,000,000 or less, although nominally ï¿½50,000,000. Little
Victoria, with only 900,000 inhabitants, owes between ï¿½22,426,502
and ï¿½26,426,502, while New Zealand even owes ï¿½SB. Bs. Id. per
head, and Queensland ï¿½52. 17s. sd. per head.
I remain? dear sir, yours most truly,

My Dear Sir : ?l am pleased to see that you received my
letter of September 14th, and also the Herald containing the
letter of Mons. Malinouski to the French Minister, and the in-
terviewing of Admiral Lynch by the Herald correspondent.
I thank you for having given me so quickly a free criticism on
the articles published in the Herald. I felt assured that you
would give a frank opinion on the matter of the eternal war be-
tween Chili and Peru, that has been so disastrous to the latter.
Your long residence in Peru, Bolivia and Chili, and your
knowledge of all European languages and all countries, as well
as your educational training in early life among a people who
love liberty and honest action among men, and also your per-
sonal knowledge of many of the actors in this war drama, fitted


you for giving a clear and unbiased opinion on facts, causes and
results. I think you have been a careful and correct observer
and delineator of events as they transpired, and that you have
jotted down the main features of this drama or tragedy without
prejudice or bearing malice to any. It is difficult to write
history and write it correctly. Who among the English can take
a French version of the Battle of Waterloo, and recognize in it
any feature of truth as they understand it ? Who among our
own people can read the history of our civil war by Jefferson
Davis, and not feel a glow of indignation as he turns from page
to page and finds them filled with inaccuracies and misstate-
ments?errors so glaring that a Confederate General, within a
week, in my house, has denounced them in terms stronger than
I am prepared to write?
The great misfortune of Peru was that she could not see her-
self as others saw her. There is an immense deal of human
nature in those two lines of Burns :
?Oh, wad some power the gif tie gie us,
To see ourselves as others see us,?
She could not see that her people (Indians of mixed blood)
were not of a warrior race, while her opponents were plucky and
full of fight all over.* And she could not see that besides the
old time corruption of colonial days, she had two other elements
of corruption that had long been gnawing at her vitals. I mean
? Guano ? and Slavery,? To be sure the latter had been abol-
ished in 1855, but the effects were there still, and the mixed
blood of the Spaniard with the Indian and the African could be
seen at every corner, turn which way you would. Knowing
from early life the baneful effects of slavery, I could not but see
it when I was in Peru. After the war broke out I wrote to my
old friend Don Geronimo-Urmeneta, formerly Prime Minister of
* N. B.?Lieut. T. B. M. Mason, U. S. N., in bis able paper : ? The War on
the Pacific Coast of South America,? after giving a grapnic description of the
battle between the ?Esmeralda? and the Peruvian iron-clad ? Huascar,?
mounted with 300 pounder guns, in which battle the ? Esmeralda? was sunk,
going down with her colors flying and guns firing, says of Captain Prat of the
? Esmeralda (who was killed in the engagement), and after giving bis speech
to his men before the engagement ; ? Had the results of the action been dif-
ferent it might have passed for bombast ; as it is. it becomes a fitting text for
the naval students of the future ? Captain Prat?s speech was : ? Children, the
odds are against us ; our flag has never been loicered in the 'presence of the en-
emy ; I hope it will not be to-day . As long as I live that flag shall fly in its
place, and if I die, my officers will know how to do their duty. '


Chili, and said, ? You may thank God that you never had the
tainted garment of slavery hanging on your shoulders, and help-
ing to drag you down into the mud and mire of a miserable po-
litical existence.?
The trouble with Peru was that, as they were going down in
the mire, they were going up in their own estimation and conceit.
They claimed to be Republicans without having the slightest
ideas or knowledge of the first principles of Republican Govern-
ment, or the rights of man, or respect for the law ; their cities
and towns swarmed with generals and colonels, all great mili-
tary savans in their own estimation, all feeding at the ? public
crib,? and all ready to start a revolution as soon as they saw a
chance of success without exposing their own bodies. They took
Arica five times by storm in one year while 1 lived there, the
last time without any resistance. General Guarda came in the
town, and committed many atrocities on the poor and defence-
less natives of his own country. He killed my doorkeeper by
my side, while the American consular flag was flying over my
house ; his soldiers blew open the doors of the English Consul-
ate with their carbines, and shot a child in its mother?s arms in-
side of the consulate, while General Guarda stood by and saw it
done, and when Mr. Nugent, the English Consul sent a complaint
to Mr. Sullivan, the English Minister in Lima, he received for
answer that he thought General Guarda had been very lenient
under the circumstances.
The Peruvians, no doubt, thought that their own countrymen
had been very lenient under the circumstances, when six of them,
in black dominoes, walked into the dining room of this very
Minister ?a nephew of Lord Palmerston?and each left, as a me-
mento of his regard, a dagger in his breast?killing him at his
own dinner table, and walking out before his guests could come
to his assistance. On asking General Guarda why he fired on
my house ?putting thirty-six balls through it?and killed my
doorkeeper while the American flag was flying over it, and why
he turned 500 horses into my garden and destroyed it, he had
the audacity to tell me that he did it because my men fired on
his troops, and he saw them do it. I said to him: ? General,
with the best fire-arms in my house that ever came to South
America, and men who know well how to use them, you would


have had some one hurt to-day if they had used them, instead of
having a large force and not a scratch on one of them,? There
was absolutely no resistance, and yet the understrappers of this
valiant General took all the Peruvians they could find on my
railway station, tied their hands behind their backs, and blew the
tops of their heads off.
These things have nothing to do with the recent war, but they
show the savagery of some of the officers, and the spirit that ac-
tuated them in their civil struggle to see who shall sit on the top
of the pile, until some hungry man who is stronger than he
tumbles him off. The whole thing looks to me as if the elements
out of which a stable government and true nationality can grow
does not exist any longer in Peru. They have no industry, no
mechanical knowledge, and no ability to develope the great
sources of wealth, both mineral and agricultural, that lie hidden
in their soil. The cotton-plant (gossipium herhacium ) that with
us is an annual, with them is a perennial, growing wild and pro-
ducing balls fully equal to our best Georgia cotton. I could
pick irom plants in my garden at Arica buds, flowers, bulbs,
balls, and ripe long-staple cotton, all at one time and in every
month in the year. The most vigorous and prolific plantation
of sugar-cane I ever saw was in Peru. Their mountains are full
of rich veins of gold and silver, and other precious metals, but
they will remain untouched for centuries if their development
depends on the present inhabitants. The Indians do not care
for gold and silver. They know of many rich veins of the pre-
cious metals, but they have been so defrauded and trodden on
ever since the conquest that they would die before they would
tell a white man where he could find gold or silver. The History
of the Salcedo Mine and the Report of the Brothers Ulloa to the
King and Government of Spain, 150 or more years ago, fully
attest the accuracy of this assertion.
When I was in Peru in 1856, the Minister of War, Don Do-
mingo Elias, had a contract from the government to ship the
guano, out of which he was said to make $400,000 a year. He
run short of rails for his tracks on the Chincha Islands, and sent
a man-of-war to Arica to borrow rails of me. At first he was re-
fused, but afterwards, finding he had the power to give me much
trouble, I loaned them, with the understanding that they were to


be returned or paid for in three months. They were never re-
turned or paid for. What can be expected of a government that
feeds a cabinet minister openly on such contracts as that, and
allows him to use men-of-war to carry materials out of which his
profits were to grow.
When Peru was piling railway contracts on Mr. Meiggs to the
amount of $134,000,000, in which pie they all had a finger, I said
to a Peruvian, a member of the diplomatic corps : ? Your govern-
ment is foolish to attempt those trans-Andean railways, particu-
larly the Oroya Railway, as it can never pay its running ex-
penses, and no one knows what it is going to cost,? He said, ? I
suppose it is as good a way to spend our money as to spend it in
shot and shell. We got about $600,000,000 off of the Chincha
Islands, and we spent it nearly all in shot and shell,? and he
might have added?in the love of gold for our own pockets.
What an old love it is, and how its corrupting influences were
felt away back in the times of Virgil, when he sang,
? Sacra fames auri quia
Non cogis mortalia pectora,? &c.
I was in Paris when the Chili-Peruvian war broke out, and,
meeting some Peruvians, 1 said: ?Your people were foolish to
bring on a war with Chili; Chili will whip you.? They said, ? oh,
no I we can whip five Chili?s.? I said, ? You don?t appear to know
the history of your own country. Chili whipped you in 1838 and
she will surely do it again ?; they could not believe that I meant
what I said. I told you something of General Guarda, but I
did not tell you the whole. In 1855, I had some three hundred
Chili peons at work on the Arica and Tacua Ry. ; they were my
old hands that I had brought from the Copiapo Ry., and were
good and reliable workers, but they would plunder a watermelon
Chacra in spite of my most earnest entreaties for them to desist and
reflect on the immorality of such conduct. They soon satisfied me
that they could not only take the watermelons without much
injury to their consciences, but that they could and would take
the whole Province of Moquegua if I were to tell them to.
I had at the time a conglomerate of the ?Genus Homo,? for
besides the Chilians I had a body of Quichua and Amara In-
dians from the mountains, Coast Negros, Pigtails from the Ce-
lestial empire, and a shipload of Navies, full blood John Bulls


and Paddies, and a regular commissariat and camp for each class.
They never mixed, except on Saturday nights, when they all sat
down together in brotherly love to a friendly game of cards, to
see who could drink and cheat the most devoutly far into Sun-
day morning. When Guarda came down to Arica to drive the
Tarapaca insurgents out, and restore order and morality by kill-
ing the people, he heard of there being some good fighting element
out on the railway, so he sent a detachment of his Carabineros
out and bagged the whole of my Chili laborers, thinking to make
soldiers of them ; but to think and accomplish are two things. On
asking him why he captured my mep, he said ,l because I found
them with arms in their hands, and I have lots of sworn affidavits
to its being so,? He blustered a good deal when I told him that
they had nothing but picks and shovels in their hands, that they
were over a mile from the town, that they were all Chilians and
that unless they were given to me at once I would send by the
mail steamer that night for a Chili war vessel to force their re-
lease. He was a coward and a bully, he gave up the men and
was afterwards ordered by his government to apologize to me for
his conduct.
In speaking as I have of the Peruvians and my experience
among them, I must not forget to honor those who deserved it,
I found in Peru, a few men who were learned, high-toned, gen-
tlemanly, and honest on all occasions. Among these was Don
IldefonsO Zavala, the Prefect of the Province of Moquegua. A
Prefect is as you know, a kind of Viceroy in his Province.
Zavala was a gentleman, an honest man, and had no desire but
to see his country prosper. At my request he abolished the
Government System of ? Cargadoros ? at Arica, a measure that
all the foreign merchants had been praying for for twenty years.
He backed me with his influence and good-will, and clothed me
with all the power I desired, so that when we had once rid our-
selves of yellow fever and revolution the railway sprang rapidly
forward to completion. Without the kind acts of Prefect Zavala
the Arica & Tacna Pailway would not have been an accomplished
fact to this day. And without the noble, generous, capable,
patriotic and chivalric life and acts of Admiral Grau, (who lost
his life in battle while in command of the ? Huascar,? after
having made his vessel and himself feared and respected from


the Gulf of Guiaquil to the Straits of Magellan), what bright
light will Peru have to shine out in the pages of History, and
give lustre to her arms on the sea in this terrible war. How are
the mighty fallen?
Peru, once the most powerful and richest of all the Colonies
of Spain, and the only one that was honored with a Yice-Roy,
has fallen, and how ? by the hand of what was once the poorest of
all the Colonies of Spain, a Colony that is small in size and weak
in population, but valiant in heart, and true to honest convictions,
and maintaining a stable Government. Climate has something to
do with the differences between these two peoples. I have
often thought of what President Lincoln said to a gentleman who
had come from Chili, and was impressing him in the early part
of our war with the superiority of Chili, over all the rest of the
West Coast Republics. Lincoln was a rude specimen of hu-
manity, but he was a shrewd observer, and blessed with a great
deal of common sense; he said, ? Do they grow the apple down
there?? ?Oh! yes,? said the gentleman. ? They will do,? said
Lincoln, ?They will hold their own.? In connection with this,
it is well to remember a saying of Humboldt?s, that, ? Industry
was impossible where the banana grew.?
I started to write you twenty lines at most, and I find my pen
has run over fourteen pages ; could not stop it, so I must apologize
for the pen.
I shall look for you here next year. In your wanderings over
Australia, I hope you will be able to pick up some archaeologi-
cal 'remains for me and for the Smithsonian. Bring me, if you can
get them, some crania, and weapons, implements, etc., of the an-
cient Australians, and I will hold you in the highest esteem for-
ever and ever.
I remain, dear sir,
Sincerely yours,
W. W. EVANS, of Sans Souoi,
Near New Rochelle.
