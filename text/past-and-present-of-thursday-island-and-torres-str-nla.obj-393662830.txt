From the First Gun Emplacement on the Military Road.
(cfi The view of Thursday Island is taken from above the first gun
emplacement on the Military road, and gives a very fair idea of
the town at the present time.
The settlement dates from 1877, when the Government
Buildings were erected and Petty Sessions were first held. Shortly
after, and early in 1878, Somerset was abandoned, the buildings
being sold to Mr. Jardine. The native name of Thursday Island
is Wai ben, and its area is 816 acres. Its present population is
1515, of whom 574 are European. There are 2132 men of
various nationalities employed in boats and shipped on articles.
The number of Japanese so employed in 1898 was 790. Early in
March last a number of boats and upwards of 300 lives were lost
in a cyclone on the east coast of the Cape York Peninsula.

Murray Island. '
Vt* -*- HE Murray Island people are very proud of their Court House.
It is built of coral lime concrete, and is a most substantial and
creditable structure, constructed by themselves under the direc-
tion of Mr. Bruce. The Queensland Government contributed
the iron for the roof, but everything else must be credited to the
natives. There are verandahs on three sides, and the material for
the verandah on the fourth side has been obtained, though as
yet, as is seen in the photograph, it has not been added.
d he Mamoose, or head man, known familiarly as “ Harry,’”
dispenses justice, and in doing so is assisted by a council of
advisers, who are elected by the heads of family.
d here are four policemen who maintain order if necessary,
and who act on instructions from the Mamoose. They wear a
uniform, which is supplied them by the Queensland Government,
and they are quite conscious of the responsibilities of office.
d'hey receive a small honorarium of a year as a sort of
retaining fee for their services.

JOHN DOUGLAS.
Thursday Island,
{THORTLY before Referendum day—the 2nd of September—
I was asked by the Federation League to deliver an
address to the people of Thursday Island on its history,
with special reference to the great topic of the day. This 1
undertook to do, and I was subsequently requested by a good
many residents on the Island to have it printed for
purposes of reference.
Mr. Corran, of the “ Torres Straits Pilot,” has kindly
placed at my disposal the report of the proceedings which
appeared in his paper, and this is now reproduced nearly in
its original form.
I have added a few statements, chiefly in explanation
of a few very excellent photographs taken by Mr. Claude
Falconer when on a cruise in the “ White Star ” among the
islands of Torres Straits.

30th September, 1899.

1 Murray Island.
(9*1
* The picture here given shows the Murray Island school children
who are a very bright and orderly lot, quite equal in intelligence,
according to my estimate, to the ordinary run of white children.
Mr. John Bruce is their teacher, and he has had them under his
tuition for fully five years. He is paid by the Queensland Go-
vernment, and is the only white man at present permanently resid-
ing on Murray Island. The population of Murray Island, accord-
ing to our census and population registers, which are regularly
kept by Mr. Bruce, numbers 481, and I am happy to say that of
late years the population has slightly increased. The excess of
births over deaths since 1893 stands at 39.
Murray Island may be said to be “ self-contained.” There
are very few foreigners, and South Sea Islanders are kept at
arm’s length, not being encouraged either to- settle on the island
or tO' intermarry with the women.

In the beginning God created Thursday
Island. There are some persons possibly
who might hesitate to confirm that state-
ment, and who might prefer to say that
Thursday Island grew unconsciously, like
Topsy, and that one fine morning it arose
above the sea level, growing grass and
producing living creatures in that mysteri-
ous order of creation of which as yet we
know very little. I am not going to dis-
pute about the origin of Thursday Island —
how it came to exist, and how in the far-off
ages it began to bask under the puissant
forces of the great Creative Power. Suf-
fice it to say that our little Island is pro-
bably as old as the mightiest monarchs of
the Andes and the Himalayas. Its founda-
tions are laid in the bed rock of the oldest
geological formations. Here and in this
very neighbourhood was enacted the great
drama of man’s earliest existence. There
are no historical landmarks, I regret to say,
of that most interesting period. There are
no precious memorials of those times which
can be said to throw much light on the
stone age as it still exists in New Guinea.
I cannot tell you when men first came to
look on these shores. I cannot tell you
with any approach to accuracy where our
first Garden of Eden was situated, whether
on this Island, or on Hammond Island, or
on Moa or Badu. Of this you may be
certain, on no less an authority than my
own, that there was once, not far from us,
a Garden of Eden of our own. We have
indeed just as good a right to a Garden
of Eden on these Australian' shores as the
dwellers in Mesopotamia. Adam and Eve
were here in all their primitive sim-
plicity. Cain of Torres Straits killed Abel
just in the same way, and the same savage
destiny was worked out through endless
ages. So that after all, Thursday Island
is probably as old as the oldest island of
the ocean, and if there is honour in old
age, and in an ancient origin, Thursday
Island has a perfect right to any distinc-
tion which may be founded on such associa-
tions. In due course, also, there came a
time when the Sons of God, as our ancient
annals have it, took to themselves the
daughters of men. That stupendous al-
liance, which I do not pretend wholly to
comprehend, no doubt bore fruit here, as
it did elsewhere, and it is quite possible
that his Caucasian Majesty of the present


day may claim to trace his ancestry to such
an origin. However that may be, I will
claim this for Thursday Island, that it is
as old as Nineveh or Persepolis, as old as
Rome or Carthage, and that during all that
stormy time when empires rose and fell it
was held in reserve in quiescent insignifi-
cance, awaiting the advent of that peculiar
people whom I have referred to, and who
may for our present purpose be designated
as the Sons of God. Well then, having
thus shadowed forth the distant past, the
period of gestation when this Thursday
Island and this Torres Straits of ours was
being formed in the fruitful womb of time,
let me now glance briefly at its history in
later times—in the living present which we
know of and which we may regard as his-
torical as compared with those mystic ages
which the mighty forces of Nature devoted
to the creative period. The first recorded
fact, then, which I connect with the present
uj the voyage of Torres through Torres
Straits. That was in August, 1606. In the
same year came the Dutch to Duyphen
Point, which is south of the Batavia River.
Torres was unable to make his way round
to the north of New Guinea, being baffled
by contrary winds, so he coasted along the
southern shores of New Guinea, annexing
everything in the name of the King of
Spain, and kidnapping some twenty natives
as curiosities for his master. He says that
he sailed through the Straits in the nth
parallel of south latitude, and at the same
time says that he got into great difficulties
among the reefs which extend, according to
his computations, up to the fifth parallel.
How he arrived at this conclusion is diffi-
cult to understand. He got through, how-
ever, and reached Manila that same year.
You will all agree with me I think when I
say that Luis Vaez de Torres must have
been a plucky sailor and a dexterous naviga-
tor to accomplish such a feat with the im-
perfect ships and appliances which then
prevailed. It is curious to know, also, as
many of you I daresay do not know, that
the account of his voyage did not transpire
until more than 150 years after, when a
copy of it was discovered in an official
pigeon-hole at Manila, when that Spanish
colony was occupied by the British in the
early years of George the Third’s reign.
Anyway, Torres managed to thread his
way through the Straits in August, 1606.
That was in the reign of James the First
of England and Sixth of 'Scotland, but
whether he did so through Endeavour
Straits, or by the Prince of Wales Channel,
or by what we know as the Napoleon Pass,
I cannot tell you. He probably sighted
the Prince of Wales group. Make a note
then of your first historical landmark. Luis
Vaez de Torres passed through Torres
Straits in August, 1606. That was about
the time of the Gunpowder Plot. Then,
after a long interval of more than 160 years
came Cook, our illustrious voyager. Cook
did not know of the discovery made by
Torres, at any rate there is no hint of such
knowledge in his travels, for Torres’ dis-
covery, as I have told you, lay perdu at
Manila. Well, Cook unfurled our flag
on Possession Island in 1770, sailing
joyfully out of the reefs through Endeavour
Straits, Landmark No. 2. Most memor-
able ! That was about the time when the
Act was passed which levied a duty on tea
imported into America. Most memorable
also! For it was that Act which lost us
our American colonies of that time—lost,
do I say, though to their great gain and to
ours also, I verily believe, for they were

Village cf Greenwell, Badu, cr Mulgrave Island.
Tq-'Badu is the native name of Mulgrave Island, as it appears in the
charts. There is a population of about 180. The village which
they used to inhabit was situated at the eastern extremity, but,
they have moved lately to a new village not far from Green
Island, which is often resorted to as an anchorage by the shelling
boats. I have named this village Greenwell from my old friend
Canon Greenwell, of Durham, who is a very high authority on
anthropology. They have good canoes, and the men live by
fishing and working as divers in shallow water, which is known
among us as swimming diving; that is diving in from three to
four fathoms of water. There is good timber on the island,
which is impervious to the attack of the formidable
ierido navalis, and there is an abundance of a wild native yams,
known to the natives as Boers, which are very palatable, and
quite worthy of being ranked with the English potato.
A school has lately been established on the island, taught
by a white man, and when I last visited this island there were 41
children in attendance. The most of them understand English,,
and they are very anxious to learn, both to read and write.






then enabled to work out their destiny on
a grander scale; and to us of the old parent
stem there came a capacity to branch out
into a wider space in India and in Canada,
and above all in this new continent of Aus-
tralia. It was some compensation indeed
for the tea duty, that Cook should at that
time have accomplished the exploration of
the eastern coast of New South Wales, as
he called it, planting his staff on Possession
Island, and thus opening out a vast area of
amplification for our Anglo-Saxon race.
Remember once more that Landmark in
your history, 1770 —most memorable! —not
only for us, but for the world itself! Thus
the spirit of Life and Light began to move
on the face of the waters, and a new birth
began—the babe leaped, as it were, in its
mother’s womb. (Applause.)
Let me here dilate a little on this plan
which you see before you. It is an en-
largement of Captain Cook’s chart which
has most kindly been made for me by
Captain Coxen, our artillery commandant.
It is wonderfully accurate you will observe
with the exception of some minor details
which have been filled in by subsequent
observations. Here Cook planted his staff
on Possession Island in 1770. It is a note-
worthy incident in the history of Aus-
tralia, and it may be hoped that it will
some day be monumentally perpetuated in
some permanent fashion. In Sydney, you
know, there is a fine statue to Cook
in one of their public places. Why should
not we, at this extremity of Australia, where
he accomplished this the greatest of his
achievements, why should not we too have
some lasting memorLl indicating on these
shores the act of our glorious discoverer.
Twenty years after came H.M.S. Pandora
sailing from Tahiti, and she left her bones
in Torres Straits. In the following year
Eligh and Portlock passed through. That
was in 1792. Then came Bampton and
Alt, the adventurous traders and explorers
of the Papuan Gulf; and after them noth-
ing, or nothing historical so far as I know
for more than fifty years, when Blackwood
of the Fly and Owen Stanley of the Rattle-
snake, as recorded by Jukes and McGilliv-
ray, began to make history by their surveys
and observations. It was time that they
did, for it was then beginning to be per-
ceived, as their instructions testify, that
there must soon be steam communication
between Sydney and Singapore, and the
way must be prepared by further explora-
tions and surveys through Torres Straits.
Blackwood accordingly surveyed the Raine
Island entrance, and erected his tower
there. Owen Stanley improved on that
and surveyed Bligh’s entrance, exploring
at the same time the waters and the Is-
lands in the vicinity of the Warrior Reef.
Thus we reach another landmark in our
history —the voyages of the Fly and the
Rattlesnake, 1844 —1850.
Alas, dear Thursday Islanders, I have
looked (in vain in your School of Arts
Library, consisting of two thousand vo-
lumes, mostly novels —in vain have I
looked for the voyages of the Fly and the
Rattlesnake. I can find no trace of Jukes
or McGillivray. You have an excellent
edition of Cook’s voyages, from which I
have taken the chart which you see; but
you have no Jukes and no McGillivray, and
as far as I can fin'd you have no Bible. I
fear me much that the members of the
School of Arts have not yet found salva-
tion. Find salvation by all means. Buy a
good edition of the Revised Version, and
buy also the voyages of the Fly and the


Rattlesnake. They are the very title-deeds
of your inheritance.
: Once more let us go over these land-
marks.
Landmark No. i. —Creation of Thursday
Island—unrecorded —omne ignortum pro
magnifico, probably the same as the sun
and the moon and the stars.
Landmark No. 2. —Visit of the Sons of
God to the daughters of men, also beyond
historical computation, an insoluble prob-
lem.
Landmark No. 3. —Luis Vaez de Torres
A.D. 1606.
Landmark No. 4. —Captain Cook at
Possession Island, a.d. 1770.
Landmark No. 5. —Voyages of the Fly
and the Rattlesnake, 1844 —1850.
Now we are approaching what may be
called modern times. Torres Straits had
been explored. Occasionally ships passed
through it. I think I see before me to-
night an ancient mariner, Captain Dark,
who in the early days of his seafaring,
between 1840-50, passed several times
through Torres Straits. But as yet little
was known of the great northern territory
of Terra Australis. Fitful attempts had
been made to establish a settlement at
Port Essington, and had failed. It then
came to be perceived that, if there was to
be a harbour of refuge in Northern Aus-
tralia, it would be somewhere in the vicinity
of Cape York, or York Cape, as Cook has
it, and not at Port Essington. Thus the
exploration of the York Cape Peninsula
became a necessity. So an expedition was
organised in Sydney, and E. B. Kennedy
was placed in command of it. They left
Sydney on the 26th of April, 1848, in the
barque Tam o’Shanter under the convoy of
H.M.S. Rattlesnake, thirteen all told, one
of them being a namesake of my own. They
landed at Rockingham Bay on the
23rd of May. Why so far south
it is hard to tell. They were sadly
embarrassed by the difficulties of the
country in those parts, and were quite ex-
hausted by their wanderings before ever
they reached the Peninsula. I suppose
that you all know the disastrous results of
that expedition. Poor Kennedy was killed
by the blacks on the Escape River, within
sight of Albany Island, whither a vessel had
been sent to meet him. His faithful com-
panion Jackey Jackey, an Australian abor-
iginal, saw him die, and afterwards reached
Albany to tell the tale. Kennedy had left
eight men at a depot he formed at Wey-
mouth Bay. Weymouth Bay is to the
south of Piper Island Light. Of those
eight men two only survived, Carron and
Goddard. Carron was the botanist of the
expedition, and from him we know every-
thing that is known about the expedition
up to the time when Kennedy left them to
make a dash for Albany. They were res-
cued by Captain Dobson and Dr. Vallack
in the Ariel on the 30th of December,
1848, and were taken back to Sydney. A
few months after, in May of the following
year, T. Beckford Simpson, the master of
the brig Freak, visited Weymouth Bay and
brought away the bodies, or rather the
bones, of Niblet and Ward. He buried
them on the highest point of Albany
Island. Captain Owen Stanley after-
wards erected a tombstone, as we are
told, over the grave. It was in reality a
stout wooden tablet, which was afterwards
destroyed by one of the fires which every year
sweep over Albany Island and burn un all
the long grass which prevails. The tablet
was renewed by Mr. John Jardine in 1865,

and again by Mr. Frank Jardine. This
last tablet has nearly shared the fate of its
predecessors. I visited Albany Island the
other day for the purpose of ascertaining
its condition, and finding that it was fast
perishing I brought it in with me. Here it
is, you see. I hope that this time it may
be renewed in some permanent form, so as
to resist the effects of fire or of time, and
that it may remain to remind us and those
who come after us of Kennedy and his
companion. They were brave men. They
fell in no inglorious battle with the un-
known, and ought to be remembered as
the first of our explorers. I can well re-
member when I first came to this country
in 1851 how the fate of Kennedy and his
companions was being talked about.
Silence, however, once more brooded over
the Peninsula and tne waters of Torres
Straits for a good many years after Ken-
nedy passed out of our sight. It was not
until after Queensland came to the front
that anything more was done to let in the
light. The first thing done was to establish
a Port of Refuge, as it was called, at
Somerset. Ships were beginning carefully
to puzzle out a track through the Straits.
Men who were not altogether absorbed by
the glamour of our gold discoveries began
to study the charts. They came to the
conclusion that Albany Island commanded
a fine position and that some day or other,
and somewhere in that neighbourhood,
there must be an Australian Singapore.
Had not the hydrographer in the Admiralty
instructions to Captain Owen Stanley fore-
shadowed steam communication through
the Straits ? Sir George Bowen, our first
Governor, was keenly alive to the situation.
He came up to Albany in H.M.S. Pioneer
in 1861. In 1862 Mr. John Jardine was
sent up from Brisbane to form a settlement,
At that time Captain Edwards of the Blue
Bell schooner had a beche-de-mer station
at Frederick Point, the curing house and
store being built of rough stones. Then
followed wooden houses, constructed at
Brisbane and erected on the mainland at
Somerset, as it was beginning to be called.
Shortly after came H.M.S. Salamander from
England, with a company of Marines. Her
commander was Lieut. Pascoe, and the
doctor of the vessel was Dr. Haran. Dr.
Haran wrote a paper on the meteorology of
Torres Straits, which, if I mistake not, was
published in the proceedings of the Royal
Geographical Society. The era, then, of
the foundation of Somerset, of John Jardine,
and of the Salamander was 1863. Every-
body down south was talking of Somerset,
and what a great place it was going to be
—the Singapore of Australia —forgetting
that geographical position alone, without
trade and peaceful competition, will never
make a Singapore either here or elsewhere.
However, the merchants of Brisbane and
Sydney made up their minds that Somerset
must go ahead, and so a good many thou-
sands were raked into the Treasury at Bris-
bane for the allotments which were then
sold right down to Fly Point and the City
of the Anthills. Still there was not much
real growth. There were barracks for the
Marines, whose area of occupation was
limited enough. There was a schoolmaster
too, who was supposed to be a native in-
structor, but the natives never came to be in-
structed, and indeed kept such careful watch
and ward over the redcoats that their ex-
peditions into the interior were limited to
about half-a-mile from the barracks. But
about this time there were other explorers
afoot, whose explorations were not quite so


limited. The Messrs. Jardine —Frank and
Alick —had left Rockhampton in May,
1864, with a mob of cattle, and they ar-
rived at Somerset on the 17th of March,
1865. It was a wonderfully daring drive
through country which over a great part
of the distance was absolutely unoccupied
and had not been traversed, except by
Kennedy with the disastrous results you
have heard of. Well, the arrival of the
Jardines at Somerset with their mob of
cattle gave it a forward impulse. Hence-
forward there was an overland track,
though it was not much followed. Pearl-
shellers also began to frequent Albany Pass.
Pearshell was then worth a ton in
Sydney, and there were pearl? besides, so
that there seemed to be sorjie hope for
Somerset.
Moreover, the people in Brisbane began
to think that if ever there was to be steam
communication through Torres Straits it
waa time to stir about it. So it was de-
cided to send a sort of diplomatic mission
to Batavia to see if the Dutch would join
us in the enterprise. Captain Simpson,
a retired naval commander, was fixed upon
as a man who would suitably represent us.
He bought a new uniform, I remember, so
that he might appear with sufficient im-
portance before the Governor-General of
Netherlands India. Captain Simpson at-
tained the object we had in view. The
Dutch joined us in subsidising, a service for
a few experimental trips. The Souchays
was chartered under Captain Blick, and
afterwards the Hero. It fell to my lot to
sign the first charter for a steamer service
through Torres Straits, for I then happened
to be Postmaster-General. The Dutch also
sent their representatives to Brisbane in the
persons of Mr. Van Delden and Mr. Frazer,
but it was found, after experience, that the
policy of the Hollanders was not in the
direction of free exchanges, and the next
contract was carried out by Messrs. M’Tag-
gart, Tidman and Co., of Singapore. Aftir
them came the Eastern and Australian
Coy., and then the British Indian Coy.
From 1866 to 1877 Somerset grew a little,
though slowly. There was a store and a
post office, and there were some pearl shell-
ing stations on Albany Island, but the
anchorage in Albany Passage was regarded
as very troublesome and even dangerous
for large mail steamers—with the tide
sweeping through it as it does they had
often to hold on by both anchors. At that
time, also, the maritime boundary of
Queensland was extended so as to include
all the islands between the coast and Ihe
Barrier Reef. I remember well how pur
old friend Douglas Pitt was quoted, to,;me
at the time as an instance of how tl.iere
were some of our people who had got
beyond the jurisdiction, and were living on
the islands without the benefit of judge or
jury. Messrs. M’Farlane and Murray also
had come to Somerset and had gone to
Murray Island to establish their mission
there. That was in 1871. Everything,
therefore, was prepared for another step
forward, and thus it fell to me onqe more
to mark another era in our history by the
annexation of the islands and the transfer
of the settlement from Somerset to, Thurs-
day Island. The annexation wa? made, and
the transfer was effected in 1877. I have
often thought, since I have become better
acquainted with the locality, that a good
deal was lost by us when we left Somerset
and the mainland. We abandoned with it
the chance of occupying some twenty or
thirty thousand acres of fine rich scrub land

Darnley Island.
This grasshouse may be regarded as a typical representation of
the habitations occupied by the people of Darnley. The popula-
tion of Darnley is about 250, and of these nearly half are either
South Sea Islanders, or the children of South Sea Islanders who
have married Darnley women. The mixture of races has re-
sulted, in my opinion, in a decided improvement, both mentally'
and physically.
The houses mey now live in are an improvement on the old
bee-hive structures of the primitive Darnley Islanders, and the
young people of the present generation are more enterprising.
They have been making a good deal of money lately out of the
black-lipped shell, which is pretty abundant in their waters. The
deep water in the vicinity of Darnley has been the scene of many
a diving casualty, and there are a number of graves on Darnley
Island of divers who have dived once too often.

near Somerset, as good as any in North
Queensland, and we abandoned also the
chance of a railway which might have
been pushed through the Peninsula and
made our starting point for the East, for
India, China, and even the Old Country.
Who then thought that emigrants could be
brought through the Red Sea! Good
anchorage also could have been found in
one of the bays between Somerset and
Cape York. But the die was cast. Thurs-
day Island was chosen as the future har-
bour of refuge, and Mr. Chester moved
over to occupy the present Residency in
1877. During the interval between 1866
and 1877 there hal been a succession of
Resident Magistrates at Somerset. Cap-
tain Simpson first, who succeeded John
Jardine, then Frank Jardine, and after him
lin, and finally Chester, who held sway
here until 1885, when I entered on office.
It never dawned upon me in 1877, when I
first visited Thursday Island, and when I
chose the site of the present School and
Post Office reserves —it certainly never oc-
curred to me then, that I should be privi-
leged in my latter years to take an active
share in the administration of your affairs
and in the islands of the Straits.
They have been years of very great
interest to me, and not altogether unprofit-
able, I hope, to the inhabitants of this
little dependency of a dependency. We
have grown slowly and surely. We are now
known all over the world as the northern
sentinel island of Australia, and the centre
of a thriving local industry. You can hardly
expect me, I think, to dwell on the present
occasion on the history of the years from
1877 to the present time. I may revert to
them at some future time, and tell you
about the establishment of your local Go-
vernment, the annexation of New Guinea,
the visit of the Auxiliary Squadron, the
commencement of your fortifications, and
the issue of the great controversy between
the believers in the six-inch shell limit or
the five-inch. Let us hasten on to the cul-
minating point of our modern history now
before us, that question which has to be
decided next week on the 2nd of Septem-
ber, 1899.
What say you ? Are you for union or
against it? Are we to be one people from
Cape Leeuwin to Cape York? Is this
great island continent of Australia to be
one country ? It is already one by the in-
dissoluble laws of nature —shall I not
rather say by the laws of the Great Crea-
tor, the majestic Ruler of Events in the
procession of human affairs ? It is sur-
rounded by the sea. It stretches from the
tropics to the temperate zone. Is this
great country of ours which during the last
century we have won from primitive bar-
barism, is it to be made still more one by
the closest possible political, economical,
and racial relationship ? Are we now,
henceforth and for ever to enter upon our
inheritance during the reign of her
Majesty the Queen in the Victorian
era ? Shall we accept this proffered
priceless gift, or shall we reject it ?
That is what you will be asked to
say on the 2nd of September, and I can-
not doubt what your answer will be. I
dare say you remember those stirring words
of Robert Burns—
“ Then let us pray, that come it may,
As come it shall for a’ that,
When man and man, o’er all the earth,
Shall brothers be and a’ that.”
Well, that is a big hope, a hope long de-
ferred, and not yet within sight. But we can


at any rate pray, and some of us can do
more than pray, on the 2nd of September,
that we shall have a United Australia,
bound together, indissolubly as one people,
inhabiting one country one continent,
which by the help of God and our good
selves we intend shall never again be
divided. That is what I am going to say
next Saturday. That is what I am very
confident you will say. Pardon me for
once more obtruding my personal remini-
scences upon you. So far back as 1859,
that was before Thursday Island was
thought of or had any being except as the
inheritance of King Tarbuckef—well, so
far back as 1859, when I was standing
for the Darling Downs, then a part of New
South Wales, I made my first declaration
for federation, and hoisted the standard of
a United Australia, and had a flaming para-
graph in my address to the electors. It
was quite beautiful, I can assure you, and
was a good deal admired at the time as
an exuberant fancy of young “ Leather
Jacket,” as they used to call me, because
in those days I used to wear a deerskin
coat which never wore out. Those were
the days when we could quote Tennyson
by the page, and could dream about “ the
Parliament of Man, the Federation of the
World.” We declared not only for the
Federation of Australia, but for the close
alliance of the Anglo-Saxon race. You
will find it all set out in black and white
in the pages of the “ Darling Downs Ga-
zette” of those days, a little weekly periodi-
cal much after the manner of the “ Pilot,”
which was started by me in those days of
youthful exuberance. Well, I have stuck
to my text ever since. You don’t sup-
pose, I am sure, that I am going
to forswear my first love in my old
age ? I stick to federation. I stick
to union—union first among ourselves,
union with the great country whence
we come, and union too with our kindred
across the seas in the United States of
America. I once scandalised a great man,
a Cabinet Minister, my Lord Derby, by
an announcement of that kind. It was in
London, at a club dinner. Lord Derby
was the guest of the occasion. Mr.
Thomas Archer, who was then Agent-
General, was our host. There were no re-
porters there, and I think we were all
the merrier and the more outspoken.
There were a good many Australians pre-
sent, most of them Queenslanders. Lord
Derby was perpetrating the bargain at that
time with Bismark which gave the Ger-
mans their slice of New Guinea, and gave
Great Britain a free hand in Egypt. Some-
how or other I had to reply to a toast.
Warmed by the geniality of our host, I
discoursed about! union among ourselves
in Australia. Of course that was a theme
which roused some enthusiasm among my
hearers, but when I went on to speak of
union with our kinsfolk across the Atlantic
the response was rather feeble, and Lord
Derby, who sat opposite to me, looked
very glum. Nevertheless, I went on and
said that union among ourselves in Aus-
tralia meant closer alliance with the United
States of America and the supremacy of
the Anglo-Saxon race ! That was about
fifteen years ago. Since then there have
been some exciting episodes in our his-
tory which have not exactly made for
peace in the Anglo-Saxon family, but
things have settled down very much lately.
We have shown a real friendly spirit to one
another, which indicates a lasting unanim-
ity, and my remarks on the festive occa-

sion alluded to, which aroused a fiery gleam
of disapprobation from Lord Derby, would
now probably be received with applause as
very pardonable platitudes.
And now let me address to you a few
earnest words of friendly counsel. I am
not altogether in love with the Common-
wealth Constitution. It is, and has been,
the subject of fair criticism, though in the
heat of party contention there has been
much criticism also which has been quite
beyond reason. There is much in it which
I should like to see different. There is
a good deal in it which will lead to serious
difficulties and differences. If I had been
born in New South Wales, and if I had
inherited the special love of the country
in which I was born, I think I should have
voted “ No,” and have done my best to post-
pone Federation for a few years, until it
could have been accomplished on terms
more favourable to my mother State.
Nevertheless, the people of New South
Wales have accepted the Bill and accepted
it by such a majority as leaves no room
to doubt that they are willing to adopt
it with all its difficulties and responsibilities.
They are actuated by the highest patriot-
ism, and they nave declared that they are
prepared to make some sacrifices in order to
attain a higher elevation in the status of
nationality. That is the aim and object
of the Constitutional Commonwealth which
we seek to adopt. It indicates a new birth.
I do not exactly say that, like the human
apotheosis, it has been “sown in dishonour.”
But like all efforts of Nature, it has been
accomplished not without some pangs of
parturition. It could scarcely be other-
wise. It is this very struggle for exist-
ence which gives it a value which it would
not have had otherwise. May we not
hope, may we not anticipate, that this Con-
stitutional Commonwealth of Australia will
be “ raised in glory,” will be built up so as
to illustrate in all its wisdom, its strength,
and its beauty, the splendour and the bene-
ficence of our Victorian era ? When it is
accomplished, as accomplished it certainly
will be, it will be more for us and more
for the human family, we will hope and be-
lieve, than any of the great battles which
have been lost and won during the last cen-
tury. It will be more for us, and those
who come after us, than all the military
achievements of our times; more for us
than the bloody holocaust of the Soudan ;
more for us than the commercial annexa-
tion of China or the territorial acquisition
of Imperial India; more for us now and for
ever afterwards than the crowning victories
of Trafalgar or Waterloo, though it is pos-
sible that without them our Constitutional
Commonwealth might have been relegated
to an indefinite future. I say then that the
adoption of the Constitutional Common-
wealth will be for us by far the greatest
achievement which has yet been accom-
plished in our Australian history, and will
be for us and for our children a glorious
consummation in the closing years of the
Victorian era. lam sure that you will not
expect me to-night to dilate on the legal
instrument by which it is proposed to ac-
complish our manifest destiny. Its merits
and its demerits have all already been
thrashed out to distraction, until the wheat
and the chaff have been well separated.
We all have our peculiar notions of what
this Constitution might have been, and what
it might still be made. I have my no-
tions, and doubtless you have yours, but
what am I, and what are you, that we
should stand in the way, and enter our pro-


test against an ultimatum which has already
been accepted by a commanding majority
of the people of Australia ? We approve
of its general scope and we anticipate the
greatest benefit from its adoption. But
even if, in the opinion of some of us, sac-
rifices have to be made in order to attain
this larger life, is it not the teaching of all
experience that some surrenders must be
made before we can attain to the final vic-
tory ? We give up some of our provin-
cial autonomy in order to enter upon a
higher form of government, which we hope
will give more defined expression to our
national development. We stand up as
Australians. We do not by any means
cease to be Queenslanders or even Thurs-
day Islanders. Nay, more —the very in-
tensity of your local predispositions will be
the measure of your usefulness in the larger
life which awaits you. May I venture to
say, on your behalf, that while you joyfully
claim to call yourselves Australians, and
while you wish to identify yourselves with
everything that is great and good in your
inheritance, you are Home Rulers to the
backbone. And what is Home Rule ? It
is not necessarily the amplification and re-
duplication of Parliamentary government. It
is rather, according to my interpretation,
the intelligent ordering of local self-govern-
ment. It commences in the household it-
self, the home made sacred and imperish-
able by the union of men and women who
respect themselves and love their children.
That is the very core and central citadel
of Home Rule. If it is sound and vitalised
by a sense of supreme responsibility, it
will make itself felt through all the ramifica-
tions of municipal and provincial govern-
ment up to the higher embodiment of our
Constitutional Commonwealth. If it is not
sound, and is soulless, then all I can say
is that life in this Commonwealth of ours
will scarcely be worth living for. But ours
is the hope of a .better age —auspicium
melioris cevi —and we are still a part of that
wonderful congeries of States which is held
together by the maritime and commercial
supremacy of the British Empire. No
grander or more beneficent Empire has
flourished in the history of mankind. It
has been spoken of by one of the brightest
and most hopeful of our statesmen as the
“ greatest secular influence for good now
known to mankind.” And so it is. None
of us present, I am sure, wish to loosen the
ties which unite us to what we affectionately
speak of as the old country. And yet,
my friends, we cannot doubt that the larger
life of manhood is opening out before us,
and this acceptance of our Constitutional
Commonwealth is equivalent in some re-
spects to our coming of age. We shall
have to face responsibilities which we have
never known before. To what extent shall
we share in the responsibilities of the Em-
pire ? Those who have most warmly
supported union among us have always con-
sidered that Federation would largely con-
duce to the further definition of our external
relations, arid to the perfecting of our de-
fensive preparations. I believe it will.
When it is necessary, and when we are
called upon to do so, it will be found, I
feel sure, that our Young Australians will
fight for their country as well as any of
those who have gone before them. They
are made of the same stuff, and will stand
the same strain. They will make as good
soldiers, and they may learn to make as
good sailors, as those who were born in the
days of Wellington or Nelson. Nor will
they be wanting in making the needful pre-

Tci) °f Barn, * n British New Guinea , in dress and undress .
Tq)Daru, or Yarn, as it is sometimes called, is an island of Torres
Slraits, within New Guinea waters, and is the Headquarters of
Administration, in what is known as the Western Division. In
these illustrations we have a fine representation of the Native
Constabulary in uniform, and in mufti. Fine men and capable of
anything under good officers. It was at first supposed that it
would be impossible to trust the natives of New Guinea to do
the work of a constabulary, and Fijians were employed for this
purpose. After a time, however, and sometimes after having
served a sentence as punishment, it was found that they were very
susceptible to improvement under discipline, and they may now
be regarded as a thoroughly efficient body of men who can be
trusted under any circumstances of difficulty if well led. They
arc armed with Snider carbines, and are fairly good shots at short
distances.






parations for defensive purposes, if there
needs must be war; though their best ener-
gies, I hope, will not be, and ought not to
be, bent in that direction. They have a
whole continent to themselves. They have
to subdue the vast wilderness it still is.
They have to make railways from sea to sea
—from north to south, and from east to
west. They have to build new cities.
They have to plant new forests, and they
have to make the sea itself subservient to
their purpose. Above all, they have to
establish for themselves fruitful homes,
where peaceful industries may flourish, and
where frugal habits may abound. These
are the lasting and secure foundations of
States, and these are the foundations on
which our Commonwealth must be laid if
it is to take an active share in the manifesta-
tions of that power which has been spoken
of as “ the greatest secular influence for
good now known to mankind.”
And now, once more, let me ask you —
What are you going to do next Saturday ?
I, for my part, am going to vote “ Yes” with
all my might; and lam thankful that I have
lived long enough to see the day when it
will become my privilege to do so. If
I had a thousand votes for Referendum
Day they should all be cast in the same
way. And what are you going to do ? I
will venture to say that you, too, will vote
“ Yes.”
FINIS.
There are not many of us in this little
place, but I believe that we are good grit,
and I expect that we shall vote as one man.
Let us all be on the side of the angels, the
Australian angels of the future. I dare
say that you remember the amusing contrast
which Disraeli once drew between the
lower orders of the human species and the
angels. There had been a good deal of
talk about the processes of evolution in the
order of creation. Darwin’s “ Origin of
Species” and his “ Descent of Man” had set
people thinking, and there was much con-
troversy about them. Disraeli took advan-
tage of this, and ranged himself on the side
of the angels ! And so do I. I take
my stand alongside of those beautiful beings
in their white wings and flowing robes which
are depicted in Dore’s great pictures.
There they are, with their celestial coun-
tenances beaming in the glorious light of the
rising sun, which shines full upon them.
And I turn my back on those sad, doubting
souls who have gloom shadowed on their
whole aspect —the gloom of disappointment
and defeat which presages their final doom.
You, too, I am confident, will range your-
selves with the hosts of heaven, and will
march with them from victory to victory,
to the triumphant consummation of our
Australian Constitutional Commonwealth.
