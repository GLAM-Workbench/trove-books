Their story in the stone is told
Their spirits muster and we tremble
We are the guests; our hearts behold
The silent paladins assemble.

That have subsided with the thunder.
Their's the departure, their's the fame;
Ours the reverence and the wonder."

THE ANZAC MEMORIAL IN DETAIL.
A descriptive schedule to he read in
conjunction with the reference guide opposite.
(1) THE SACRIFICE
This is the central motif of the Memorial Design. It
comprises a bronze group of sculpture depicting the re-
cumbent figure of a young warrior who has made the
supreme sacrifice, his naked body lies upon a shield which
is supported by three womenfolk —his best beloved, Mother,
Wife and Sister, and in the arms of one is a child, the
future generations for whom the Sacrifice has been made.
It illustrates the sacrifice engendered by war, self
sacrifice for duty —and the beautiful quality of womanhood
who in the war years with quiet courage and noble resigna-
tion bore their burdens, the loss of sons, husbands and
lovers.
The group rises pyre-like from symbolical flames of
Sacrifice, which radiate from its base.
Placed centrally in the Hall of Silence, it is below the
eye line of all visitors to the Hall of Memory, so that all
who gaze upon the group from this place of Memories
must bow their head in acknowledgment of those whom it
symbolises —the heroes and heroines of N.S.W. in 1914-
1918.
(2) THE WREATH BALUSTRADE
In the Hall of Memory is the Well of Contemplation
through which all who enter gaze upon the Sacrifice, and


around this Well is a balustrade of polished New South
Wales marble designed in wreath-like form in sympathy
with the Spirit of the Sacrifice which it encircles.
(3) THE FRANCE & BELGIUM NICHE.
In the Hall of Memory are Niches of Remembrance.
Cut into the walls of the Niche devoted to France and
Belgium are the names of the principal battle areas in those
countries where the Australian Imperial Forces operated in
1914-1918, and on the floor of this niche is a stone taken
from France around which, in the marble paving, is a
representation of the Rising Sun —the insignia of the A.I.F.
(4) THE NEW GUINEA and the HIGH SEAS NICHE.
On the walls of this niche are carved the names of the
principal places in New Guinea and Episodes at Sea where
or in which Australians participated. On the floor of this
niche is a stone taken from New Guinea and radiating
from it in the paving is again the Rising Sun —the insignia
of the A.I.F.
(5) THE PALESTINE NICHE
Contains the names of the principal battle areas of the
Palestine and Mesopotamia campaigns and, let into the floor,
is a stone taken from Palestine around which the Rising Sun
circles to tell of the connection between these countries and
the Sons of Australia in their great adventure.
(6) THE GALLIPOLI NICHE
Tells of the places sacred to Australian memory
places where the men of the A.I.F. engraved the name of
their Country on the pages of History. Here are to be read
the names of the great battles in which the A.I.F. particip-


ated in this theatre of war and here on the floor of this
niche is also a stone —taken from the shores of Gallipoli —-
and around it —halo-like —is the insignia of the A.1.F.,
again the Rising Sun.
(7) THE ARCHIVES DOORWAY.
On either side of this doorway growing imperceptibly
from the marble walling are urns graven in marble and
bearing graven flames of sacrifice, this doorway leads to that
chamber wherein will be deposited historical records of the
Sacrifice, the Courage and the Endurance of those in whose
memory the Memorial has been erected.
On the door leading to the Archives Room is a sym-
bolical representation of the Red Cross.
Surrounding this doorway, carved from the solid
marble, is an abstract symbolism representing the Flaming
Sword of War, pointing to the war years 1914-1918, and
carried on the wings of time, and rising—like the source of
its inspiration —is the Rising Sun of the A.I.F. —rising and
ever to arise fresh in the minds of Australian generations,
the symbol of a young country grown to nationhood.
(8) THE NAVY BAS-RELIEF.
High on the walls of the Hall of Memory are bas
reliefs depicting the four great branches of the A.1.F., and
behind the central groups in each case are marching figures
—the March of the Dead—those who were called forth
from life on service, and at their feet and flanking the
central figures in these panels are groups of crosses —quiet
symbols of quiet sentinels in far-off lands.
The Navy bas-relief depicts a naval officer and men

resting, war weary and worn after their efforts, and dwelling
on the memory of their companions for whom the passing
shadow figures, and attendant crosses speak in silent witness.
(9) THE AIR FORCE BAS-RELIEF
Depicts an air force officer and men resting after
their war efforts and contemplating in like manner the
memories of those years, their departed comrades and their
resting places being symbolised by the marching figures and
the ever-present crosses.
(10) THE ARMY MEDICAL BAS-RELIEF.
Here is depicted one of the noblest phases of the war
—weary and wounded men tended with loving care by
the Mothers of the race —here is to be seen a Matron, and
two of her charges sitting in contemplation and weariness,
and behind are to be seen again the March of the Dead and
the eternal crosses which speak of the closing gateway from
life.
(11) THE ARMY BAS-RELIEF
Illustrates members of the A.I.F. Infantry resting after
their war efforts, exhausted, and sitting in contemplation
of lost friends who have joined in the March of the Dead
and whose departure is symbolised by the crosses on either
side
(12) THE ARCHIVES ROOM.
In this room it is proposed to house an official History
of the War and other details covering the activity of the
A.I.F. during 1914-1918.


(13) THE STAIRS TO THE HALL OF SILENCE
Lead down to a viewpoint from where the Hall of
Silence is seen from a new angle. On the threshold of
the Hall of Silence and in close proximity to the Sacrifice
to which they refer are the words:
"LET SILENT CONTEMPLATION BE YOUR OFFERING."
And around the walls of the Hall of Silence are inscribed
those war areas of 1914-1918 wherein the Sacrifices of
which the central group is the symbol—occurred. On the
doors to the Hall of Silence are carved great suspended
swords flanked by smouldering urns, these symbolise the
suspended sword of Mars—the God of War, and echo the
spirit of that sword which bears the outstretched arms of
the Sacrifice.
(14) THE SOUTH PORTAL
Gives access to the Hall of Memory from the southern
approach.
(15) THE NORTH PORTAL
Gives access to the Hall of Memory from the northern
approach and overlooks the Lake of Reflections.
On entering the Memorial one walks from the cold
grey light of nature into an atmosphere of mellow amber
lighting derived from the four great windows in the Hall
of Memory which are glazed with amber glass, on which
are emblazoned the insignia of the A.I.F. —the Rising Sun
—rising phoenix-like from the Flames of Sacrifice. This
symbol faces north, south, east and west, and growing forth
therefrom is the winged torch of Liberty, a symbol of
that ideal which has proved the saving feature of 1914-
1918.


(16) THE EASTERN CAMPAIGNS.
This bronze bas-relief panel, 32' 0" long by 4' 6" high,
depicts the activities of the A.I.F. in the Eastern theatres
of war —Gallipoli, Egypt, Palestine and Mesopotamia. Here
are to be seen incidents referring to the landing at Gallipoli,
Marines, the landing of Supplies, the Army Medical Ser-
vices, the Camel Corps, the Engineers, the Army Service
Corps, the Light Horse, the Infantry carrying barbed wire
entanglements, the Machine Gunners, the Artillery and the
Engineers.
This panel, illustrating the Eastern theatres of War,
has been placed on the eastern side of the Memorial.
(17) THE WESTERN CAMPAIGNS.
A bas-relief panel, similar in size to that illustrating
the Eastern campaigns, is placed on the Western facade of
the Memorial, immediately over the Entrances to the offices
of the Returned Soldier organisations.
On this panel are depicted men of the Air Force, the
Cycle Corps, the Infantry in full marching equipment, Wag-
gon Drivers, Infantry in winter dress, Pioneers, Heavy
Artillery, Stretcher Bearers, Bombers, Machine Gunners,
Infantry in action, the Tanks Corps, and a Gas Attack.
(18) THE SOUTH APPROACH
Leads to the Hall of Memory and the terrace from
which arise the granite buttresses supporting the seated
figures.
(19) THE NORTH APPROACH
Serves a similar purpose for those visitors who ap-
proach the Memorial from the Lake of Reflections.


(20) MEMORIAL URNS.
Flanking each approach to the Memorial and at either
end of the bronze panels depicting the Eastern and Western
Campaigns, are Memorial Urns symbolising the resting
places of the Ashes of departed War Heroes.
THE SEATED FIGURES:
High on the walls of the Memorial, surmounting the
granite buttresses are colossal figures representing the
various units of the Army, the Navy, the Air Service, and
the Army Medical Corps. These figures are shown resting
after their war efforts, contemplating the tragedy and wast-
age of war —silent sentinels and guardians of the spirit of
the Memorial, and literal representations of those whose
memory the Memorial perpetuates. The figures are as
follows: —
(21) Naval Signaller.
(22) Aviator.
(23) Nurse.
(24) Air Force Mechanic.
(25) Infantryman.
(26) Signaller (Military).
(27) Gas Rescue Man.
(28) Surgeon.
(29) Lewis Gunner.
(30) Pioneer.
(31) Bomber.
(32) Ammunition Carrier.
(33) Field Artillery Driver.
(34) Light Horseman.
(35) Marine.
(36) A.B. Seaman in winter kit.


ANGLE BAS-RELIEFS.
Adjoining the seated figures beforementioned at each
angle of the Memorial are bas-reliefs depicting the follow-
ing:
(37) The Navy.
(38) The Air Force.
(39) The Army Medical Corps.
(40) The Infantry.
THE CORNER FIGURES.
At each angle of the Memorial, above the seated figures
are colossal standing figures representative of the four
great branches of the A.1.F., they are as follows:
(41) Naval Commander.
(42) Flying Officer.
(43) Matron.
(44) Second Lieutenant.
These figures, erect and alert, seem to gaze out upon
the world —eternal reminders of the men and women of
1914-1918.
(47) THE WINGED FINIALS.
At the apex of the pilasters framing the internal bas-
relief panels depicting the Army, the Navy, the Air Force,
the Army Medical Force and the March of the Dead, are
great winged finials symbolising the flight of the soul after
death, these winged finials lead the eye of the visitor to the
Stars of Memory which encrust the dome above.


(48) THE DOME OF STARS.
High above the Sacrifice is the great Dome of Stars.
On this dome there has been placed one star for every man
or woman from New South Wales who served in the Great
War. In all, there are 120,000 stars, a constellation of
memories which tells in simple fashion the collective effort
of the men and women of New South Wales in 1914-1918.


They in their valorous hour dismissed the morrow,
Washed are their souls of weariness and tears.
They have bequeathed their splendour and their sorrow—
The radiant earth and all the unwritten years.
Leon Gellert.
