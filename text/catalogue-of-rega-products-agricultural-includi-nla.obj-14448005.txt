IMPROVED No. 2 NON-FERROUS
BARREL SPRAYER
Suitable for the application of Lime and White Washes, Bordeaux Mixtures, Lime
Sulphur, preparations of Liver of Sulphur, Emulsion Oils, Red and White Oils,
Cattle, Hog and Sheep Spraying for Tick and Lice Disinfecting, and for all classes
of Spraying which come within the range of a first class machine of this kind.
Built to the usual "Rega" high standard of quality under the maker's well-known
guarantee.
Only those features which time and test proved invaluable to a first-class machine have
been incorporated in the Rega" Barrel Sprayer. Simplicity of design, based on sound
engineering construction principles, marked our course in the preparation of this "Reaa"
Product.
This model is now made from solid gunmetal and brass, except the handle and clamps
which do‘not contact the liquids.
THE CHIEF ESSENTIALS IN A BARREL SPRAYER
are a good pump, easy to get at, with a properly designed plunger. High compression
valves capable of withstanding the hard work valves have to do. A strong air chamber
with ample space and elasticity to hold sufficient liquid to keep two lines of hose going,
without exertion; an agitator which can be used independent of the pump for thoroughly
mixing the solution before it is sprayed, and the whole machine handy to handle in and
out of the barrel. All these important features are incorporated in the "Rega" Barrel
Sprayer.
In addition, we have adopted as standard equipment a very clever
and ingenious instant release plate (see illustration) for fitting
to the barrel. By simply raising the small eccentric lever the
spray pump is released, which can then be taken from the barrel
without unscrewing any bolts or nuts. The opening is 8" x 5",
which is very convenient for cleaning and filling; a template is
sent out with each one for marking off the hole to be cut in the
45 gallon barrel when supplied without barrel.
INSTANT I RELEASE
Barrel pumps are often laid aside between spraying seasons, allow-
ing the plunger leathers to shrink, with a consequent loss of
pressure until the leathers again become wet and swollen.
In the "Rega" type of piston the cotton follower (which does not
shrink) takes care of the pressure until the plunger leather becomes
wet and swollen, permitting it to resume normal functioning.
Sometimes grit and dirt will so impair the efficiency of a plunger
leather that it will not function; under such circumstances the
cotton follower is invaluable, as it ensures that the pump will
function until a new leather plunger is fitted.
One of the most important features of a spraying machine of this type is the AGITATOR
or MIXER. For satisfactory results liquids must be thoroughly mixed before commencing
to apply them, and agitated during spraying operations. Unless the agitator can be
worked independent of the pump, the first application will not be properly mixed.
The "Rega" Pump Plunger Rod is connected to the lever handle by a CENTRE PIN
which can be withdrawn, leaving the pump at rest unt l the liquid is thoroughly mixed;
then the pin can be instantly inserted and the pump brought into operation. This
important feature should appeal to your good judgment.
The handle is drilled for three selective positions of the plunger rod centre pin,
allowing for three different stroke lengths of the pump, according to the number of
nozzles being used. The machine is built for two hoses and will maintain four
nozzles at high pressure.

KNAPSACK SPRAYER

KNAPSACK SPRAYER
(MOLE'S PATENT)
DETACHABLE PUMP
DESCRIPTION.
DETACHABLE PUMP, IS A SPECIAL FEATURE of this
Sprayer which allows ready replacement of worn or
damaged parts such as tank or pump. In the past,
when pump cylinders have worn, it has been found
necessary to return the knapsack to us for dismantling
and repairs. To overcome this, and in order to save
expense to the user, we have adopted the new invention
of a detachable pump. This feature has been greatly
appreciated by all purchasers.
The pump is very powerful. The cylinder is made from
solid drawn brass tube, 6 inches long x IV2 inches,
stroke 2!/2 in. Designed with Mole's Patent Air Lock
Tube and Stuffing Box combined, and Liquid Return
System.
Plunger bucket is fitted with two die-formed oil dressed
cupped leathers, and a cotton packed follower. When
the leathers are dry after the machine has been out of
use for a time, the cotton packed follower will function
until the leathers take up the liquid. An important
feature of the M.P. pump.
THE "REGA" PUMPING SYSTEM
Surplus liquid above the plunger is returned to the container by the liquid return way
which is made into the container through the top connecting bracket. Screwed therein
is the liquid return shoulder piece into which is screwed the liquid return tube and valve.
The parallel motion lever imparts extraordinary power to the pump with the minimum
effort, which necessitates the fitting of high compression valves and a solid drawn brass
tube air chamber. Spraying mixtures are applied in cloud form by means of the
enormous pressure obtained in the combination.
THE "REGA" BACKREST.
The latest improvement to the "REGA” Knapsack, is the addition of a SPECIAL Backrest.
This enables the machine to sit like a cushion and prevents sore backs. The weight
of the machine is also eased from the operator's back, and makes spraying easy and
comfortable.
THE VALVES.
The pump inlet and air chamber compression valves are made from solid brass, and are
the mushroom type with ground-in seats. A light compression valve spring is fitted to
the stem for quick closing.
LOSS OF PRESSURE.
Generally caused through valve trouble. Take them out and clean. The valve chambers
are get-at-able, and easily inspected.
At the bottom of pump and air chamber are caps with two pins on each. Take the
special combination key supplied with machine, place loop over pins and unscrew. On
the pump side it will be necessary to drop lever by taking out the one pin which passes
through the vertical connecting rod.
With caps off, the valves are in view; insert the two prongs of key in the valve slots, and
unscrew anti-clockwise, inspect, clean and replace.
SPECIAL CARE.
Keep all moving parts well oiled. Oil plug of stop cock occasionally.
After use, pump clean water through machine.
After using corrosive liquids or mixtures containing soaps, fats, or similar mixtures, clean
well with warm water.
All parts of the "Reoa" Knaosack Sprayers are standardised, and spares can be obtained
through all good hardware stores.

CAUTION
Attention is drawn to the No. 2 Model which is specially made for
spraying acid content liquids. As quite a number of the ready made
spraying solutions offered today contain corrosive agents, we strongly
advise users of "REGA" Knapsacks (especially if they do not know the
analysis of the spraying solutions they may be using) to always use our
lead coated machines. A good rule to follow is to wash out your
machine with warm water after use.
LOSS OF PRESSURE
Is due to faulty valve at foot of pump or locking device not screwed
down tightly on rubber gasket.

JETS.
Two are supplied. "P" or penetration

economy jet throws flame 4 ft. long.
THE "REGA" WAY OF ERADICATION
Is a scientific method of control and eradication of noxious growths and pests. With
regard to trees and weeds, if they are fired when GREEN and the life-giving sap is in
the foliage, the effect is most damaging to the roots. The leaves are to the plant what
the lungs are to us. The secret of success of the flame thrower as a destructive agent
is to burn before seeding commences and prevent germination. Interrupt the breathing
system of the plant and suffocate its growth, retard development, and kill it.
First give the plant life a quick scorch, causing the foliage to wither, and another
application about 5 days later should result in a complete burning.
TREATMENT OF BLACKBERRY, LANTANA, GORSE AND SIMILAR.
Take up a position on the windward side. Use the "P" Jet. Direct flame close to
ground and ignite from end to end quickly. The wind will assist the flame to travel
through the growth. Choose a fine warm day for work.
In about 5 days give a second application of flame.
For very heavy infestations of lantana, first cut a strip on the windward side and leave
for about a week to dry. Then burn.
BURNING FIRE BREAKS.
The "Rega" Flame Thrower is an excellent machine for burning fire breaks. The general
method adopted is to treat the growth with a quick scorch, either in bursts or continuous
flame, using the "E" (Economy) Jet when moving along. Face the cone towards the
ground, and a scorch about 4 feet wide is produced by moving the burner from side to
side. When dry and withered, it can be finished off with a second application.
RABBITS.
Ram green stuff in burrows and apply flame, driving the heavy smoke and poisonous oil
fumes through the burrows creating a deadly poison gas unsurpassed by dangerous poison
gases. Another successful method is to fire one "dead" shot (no flame) into burrow,
followed by a "live" shot (with flame) then block up burrows.
GRASSHOPPER PLAGUES.
The flame thrower is the most effective destroyer of these pests. Kill them before they
cdn fly and save the enormous waste of poison bait. Sweep the flame over the infested
area. Millions of hoppers can be destroyed in a very short space of time.

material moving to the centre and prevent packing at the sides; of special
advantage for use with fine dusts which may cling to the strainer. Fitted
in machine when sent out.
Strainer: Three supplied, extra fine, fine and coarse.
Spreaders: Two supplied one large 6 in, diffusing, one angle spoon for
ground work.
Cog Wheels: Gunmetal cast (not stamped).
Ratchet and Pawl: Sturdily built for long service.
Rocker Arm: Gunmetal cast, to resist pressure.
The Machine is force-fed with a large capacity bellows, developing a
most powerful drive to reach high trees or cover wide areas of ground
work. This Duster is unquestionably the most economical and efficient
duster available to the grower today.
Superfine Adjustments: Give the user a wide range of dust volumes
and are made possible by the variable position of the rocker arm and the
provision of strainers of different mesh.
Instantaneous Control and Elimination of Waste: Makes possible the
care of the smaller plants to their full growth. Plants can be spotted
with dust, effecting the greatest economy of dusting material. For
continuous flow of dust it is only necessary to move the extension to
and fro, this spreads the dust evenly with a minimum of exertion.
All "REGA" parts are standardised and obtainable through leading
hardware stores.

HIGH PRESSURE
BUCKET SPRAY PUMPS
DESCRIPTION.
The pumps are adjustable tor height in the Kinged bracket by means of the thumb screw
in the clip.
The Footrests are made from strong mild steel bar.
The Plunger Buckets are fitted .with oil dressed leather washers. Easy and simple to
renew.
These pumps are suitable for spraying Lime Sulphur and preparations based on Liver of
Sulphur, Sulphoids, Bordeaux Mixture, Arsenate of Lead, Oil Emulsions, Veterinary
Drenches, Cattle and Sheep Oils, Lime and Whitewash Sprays, etc. Disinfecting Dairies,
Stables, Kennels, Fowlhouses, Piggeries, Stagnant Pools, destroying Mosquito Larvae, etc
Washing windows, cars, carts, etc.
The "REGA" Air-lock Air Chamber is a unique feature. Some
years ago the patentee of the "Rega" system of atomization
took up the study of this class of pump; exhaustive experiments
and tests were made covering each integral part: size and
shape of air chamber; air force and elasticity; air retaining;
kind, shape, and size of valves and valve ways; relativity of the
two air retainers, handle air tube and air chamber in combina-
tion with the stuffing box factor! The result was a spray pump
superior to anything ever befbre, and ever since the specifica-
tion has remained unaltered. Note the air recess above the
airlock tube which is designed in union with the stuffing box
to hold compression.
The function of an air chamber is to give elasticity to the liquid stream and cushion it
to flow evenly at all pressures.
Water being incompressible for practical purposes, the size, shape and construction of
the air chamber is very important. Force is produced by confining the liquid and reducing
the air cushion. Keep the stuffing cap on top of the air chamber screwed down on to
the packing. Oil occasionally. A leaking stuffing box weakens the pump

This invention is a great improvement
on the standard model.
You can see by the illustration that it has an air chamber which enables the operator to
make the strokes with ease.
The air in the air chamber is compressed with every stroke of the pump, storing up
energy to give elasticity to the liquid stream, and cushion it to flow evenly at all
pressures.

This type of pump works on the trombone
principle.
The pipe and strainer are inserted in a
bucket. In practice the liquid passes
through the handle on each stroke of
the pump at very high pressure up to

LEAKLESS AUTOPOP CUT OFF VALVE
Patent No. 23193/35.
Codeword: "AUTOPOP."
The patent consists of a diaphragm, or pulsator, interposed
between the valve lifter and the oscillator, thereby effecting
the opening and closing of the valve without the possibility
of the liquid escaping.
The valve is fitted with a rubber insertion diaphragm for
general use. A spare diaphragm is sent out with each valve
and a metal one for use with oil.
You are advised to carry spare diaphragms of the kind mostly in use.
Under actual test the metal diaphragm, for use with oil, lasted for 6,000 pulsations The
rubber insertion diaphragm showed little signs of wear after 8,000 pulsations
