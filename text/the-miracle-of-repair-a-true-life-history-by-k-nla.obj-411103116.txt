A SPOILT CHILD.
“ Spare the rod and spoil the child.”
?00R dear child, he did not mean it.” These or similar
words would be spoken by my aunt with respect to
myself, a child eleven years of age, when about to be
corrected by my father for some wrong-doing of which I
had been guilty.
At a very early age I had been deprived by death of a mother’s
tender care. In compliance, however, with her dying request, I
was placed under the charge of my aunt, my mother’s sister, who
so well fulfilled her part in the fond solicitude she bestowed upon
me, that I soon obtained the sobriquet of “ the spoilt child.”
“ Aunt Annie, Aunt Annie,” cried out the spoilt child one
night as usual, just as aunt, father, and the rest of the family
were seated down to the customary ten o’clock evening supper.
“ Annie,” said my father, “ why do you not correct that child
and send him to bed, you are completely spoiling him.”
Poor aunt Annie, she was too tender hearted to bestow some
well merited punishment upon me, so she arose from the table
with the remark, “ poor child he does not like being left alone.”
My father replied that I would eventually suffer more keenly
through not being corrected whilst a child. Aunt Annie seemed
to think however that it would make her pet obdurate.
My father expostulated, and probably said that somewhere he
had read of a mother who would at one moment chastise her
child, and the next moment fondle him, as if making the confession
that she had wrongfully punished him. My father would not
advise such a method as that, but did no doubt consider that I
ought to receive some proper correction.
It was of no avail, aunt Annie was bent upon spoiling me, re-
gardless, it would appear, of the consequences.


The course that my aunt pursued would have been no great
matter of surprise to me in after years, had she been of a morally
or intellectually weak character. This was not the case, for she
was a true Christian lady of considerable talent, versed in various
languages, and an accomplished harpist, and pianist.
Before her sister’s marriage (for she accompanied her married
sister to Australia) had removed her to a distant home, as a
harpist, she had been much admired in the drawing-room
entertainments of some of England’s nobility, with whom her
parents were on visiting terms, but she was of far too modest and
retiring a disposition to care much for public display, and besides,
possessing a small income that sufficed to meet her wants, she
exercised her gifts for the pleasure they afforded in themselves. In
early youth, and as a young man, I was passionately fond of music,
and would sit and listen hour after hour to my aunt’s playing.
I can but offer one solution, as to why my aunt so thoroughly
spoilt me, it is this, my aunt left England with her married sister
on account of her own lover dying just previous to her sister’s
marriage, and departure for the colonies ; and so it seems to me
that all her pent up love and affection were bestowed upon her
spoilt boy. Such was the character of one of the persons, who
aided in the formation of my character, and really, when the
position and want of education of the other are considered, it
would appear as though nature worked through opposites at
times to effect her purposes. This other person then who was
a factor in my early training, was none other than the cook of the
household. She too could boast of somewhat, a temper that at
times brooked no interference from the younger members of the
family, and also a very fair share of muscular development, that
added weight to her temper. Being in her prime, when I was a
child, she exercised a considerable amount of authority amongst
the young folk, and this more so because she was a most trust-
worthy servant, and possessed some sterling qualities, as forty
years of faithful service in my father’s household, and a branch of
it fully proved.
There were certain occasions in those early days when it was
deemed advisable on the part of the young members of the family


to avoid collision with the cook in the culinary portion of the
house, into which we would at all times make our way in search
of stray sweetmeats. Then it was that the signal would go
round, “ Bridget is put out to-day, we had better keep out of her
way.” I however was exempt from any fear on that score, and
so naturally incurred the jealousy of the others.
“ Bridget,” John or Mary would say, “ have you any small
cakes to-day, did you make any when making the pastry ” ?
“ Now look here, ‘ Bridget would say,’ you go away out of this
and don’t get me in a temper.” Shortly afterwards, I would
appear on the scene and ask : “ Bridget, did you make me any
cakes to-day.” “ Yes, dear boy, I put some away for you,” and
producing them would remark “ eat them up quick as the others
have just been after them.” Thus advised, and with no great
amount of pressing, I would sit down and eat them all up.
My eldest brother used to relate the following story about me,
much to my disgust. He took me when about thirteen years of
age, with two other lads of a like age, on one occasion to see
“The Lights of London” performed, but prior to our entering
the theatre, he took us into a confectionery shop, giving us
permission to enjoy ourselves without stint. He ever after
declared that I ate very much more than either of the others,
and declined to repeat the experiment under similar circumstances,
in so far as I was concerned.
The training I received from my aunt and the cook unfort-
unately makes the story only too credible.
It would be false and cruel to suppose that those who spoilt
me, intended to accomplish the result they in fact did, and which
sent me out at last utterly unfit to take my part in the battle of
life, as I should have done, and to handicap me most severely in
the struggle of “ the survival of the fittest.”
Speaking, personally, I do not think any parent can bestow a
greater curse upon his child than to allow it to escape, through
mistaken kindness, all punishment for wrong-doing, as happened
in my case.


A DESULTORY EDUCATION.
Supple sinewed, iron jointed, they shall dive and they shall run,
Catch the wild goat by the hair and hurl their lances in the sun,
Whistle back the parrot’s call, and leap the rainbows of the brooks,
Not with blinded eyesight poring over miserable books.
LOCKSLEY HALL.
JT is a trite and common remark that clergymen’s sons do not
generally turn out the best of sons from a moral point of view.
It may be that this statement arises partly from the fact that
the son of a minister of religion, owing to the position his
father occupies in the parish, becomes better known than most
other lads in his native spot, and so he finds it more difficult to
escape observation in after life, and then some people are apt to
think, that of necessity, clergymen’s sons should be morally better
than other people’s children, oblivious of the fact that we all bear
the taint of moral evil. I offer no apology for myself, because
my father was a minister of the Gospel, for I am ready to admit
that I was as bad as bad could be.
Decency forbids me from setting out in detail the iniquities
into which I sank, but truth compels me most emphatically to
assert that, the description of the natural man by St. Paul in the
first chapter of the Epistle to the Romans, and in other parts of
the Scriptures wherein he is pourtrayed as carnal, sensual,
devilish, was fully exemplified in my downward course.
Yes, I was the youngest son in a clergyman’s family. Prior
to my birth, my father held the position of head-master of the
Church of England Grammar School in a rapidly rising city.
At the time of my birth he had exchanged this post for the charge
of a parish adjacent to this city. Here it was that up to the age
of thirteen I resided, enjoying many a pleasant holiday at a
country residence near the sea which my father possessed.
Some of my earliest recollections centre round this spot removed


from the town. The beautiful ocean, bay and beach became
indelibly imprinted in my memory. The bay, at times most
picturesque, with its fringe of woodland and the white canvas of
the yachts, that tossed upon its waves. Upon the silvery beach
my companions and I gathered shells of rare beauty, and hailed
with delight the drawing in of the fishermen’s net, as we sported
on the sands.
The school which I attended, when not on these holidays,
was close by our city home. Here I made the acquaintance of
a monkey and dog, the dog left a few scars on my calves, the
monkey luckily being hindered from following suit by being
chained up. Even these animals you see had a tender regard for
me, which I need scarcely say I did not return, being so much
opposed to what I was led to expect a “ spoilt child ” should
receive at the hands of others, the being allowed to be always
master of the situation.
At this school I acquired the rudiments of Latin, French, and
Mathematics, and learnt to play the noble game of cricket, in
which I excelled during all my school days. Providence had
most certainly endowed me with a large share of physical strength
in my youth, else I could never have endured the terrible strain
put upon my constitution. My companions remarked, that, as a
youth, I was exceedingly strong and healthy, but alas, e’er I had
reached my nineteenth year I was compelled to seek medical
advice, in consequence of an evil associate having, years prior to
this, contaminated my childish mind before I really knew of the
attendant danger of the evil course into which he was leading me.
It is a dreadful, but true fact that there are human monsters
(more abroad than some are apt to think) who are at work in our
midst instilling iniquity into the minds of the young, to whom
Christ’s words of condemnation apply in their fullest meaning :
“ Better a millstone were hanged about their necks and that they
were cast into the sea, chan offend one of these little ones.” In
health and strength, however, I reached my sixteenth year. Up
to this age I had not yet begun to reap the bitter fruit of my
childish error. As yet that seed of evil, sown years before, had
not affected my constitution, which two years later on it did,


bringing in its trail, a veritable serpent’s trail, long years of
nervous prostration and physical weakness.
Reader, “ the mills of God grind slowly” sometimes, but then
“ they grind exceeding small,” as to my bitter cost I discovered.
Better, far better for me, had my sin been made apparent by some
visible effect, instead of from its insidious character remaining
hidden, and so practised unobserved, till my constitution was
undermined, for then I should have been warned of the danger,
and may be the after bitterness would have been warded off.
“ Fools make a mock of sin,” but wise people pay heed,
believing that “ if men will not accept council at first hand cheap,
they will buy repentance at second hand dear.” How dear, these
pages will, to some extent, disclose, if you care to peruse them.
But to return from the digression. At the age of thirteen I
left school, and entered upon a long holiday of three years
duration, of which I shall now speak. It came about in this
manner. My father had just exchanged the residence near the
sea for another country seat more inland, situated, however,
near a pleasant river. My aunt was prevailed upon to go, and
so I readily went with a companion of my own age and some
others of our connections ; the other members of the family
remained at the town home, paying us occasional visits. I entered
into the enjoyments that my new home afforded with great spirit.
It was hardly to be wondered at that I should revel in such a
place, as I now found myself in. If was a magnificent home,
replete with every comfort. The original owner, once a very
wealthy man, had squandered thousands of pounds in most
elaborately laying out extensive grounds, and erecting a handsome
and commodious residence thereon. At the entrance to the
grounds near the public highway stood two massive iron gates,
on either side of which was erected a pretty lodge for some of
the attendants ; from these gates a long and shady carriage drive
extended up to the residence. The building itself was well fitted
for social pleasures, and was the scene even in my time of some
festive gatherings, and, no doubt, of many a brilliant one in
previous days.
In front of the residence an extensive flower garden containing


the choicest shrubs and plants had been laid out, interspersed
here and there with ornamental trees of intrinsic worth and
beauty, beyond this stretched out fields of lucerne and clover,
adding to the picturesqueness of the view. At the rear and
sloping down to the river was the orchard, an exceedingly fine
one in every respect. By means of powerful machinery, and
immense iron tanks raised high up in the air on solid stone
structures, the fields, garden, and orchard had been placed under
irrigation. It was no wonder that the original owner, wealthy
though he once was, came to ruin here. As the saying goes, I
was quite my own master during my stay here. The abundance
of fruit, that grew in the orchard, was at the disposal of myself
and companions, without any restriction whatever. Many times
a day for months would we climb the almond trees, fill our
pockets, descend, and, after the fashion of monkeys, crack the
shells and devour the kernels, so great was the supply of these
nuts. Other fruits were also so prolific that tons rotted away
unused. This waste might well have been turned to good use
by a distribution of the fruit amongst the poor of the hospital, a
few miles away, but alas, those left in charge like myself were on
pleasure bent, and so gave small heed to others wants.
Then what delight the river afforded us. Beneath some
stately old willow, that spread out its branches far over the water,
at midday, in the morning, or evening, as the fancy took us, we
would sport in the clear stream.
Here I learnt to ride, for there was no lack of horses. Two of
those persons in charge, who like myself did very much as they
pleased, brought over on one occasion twenty young untamed
horses, and performed some splendid feats of horsemanship in
breaking in these animals. I got many a nasty throw. On one
occasion I was dragged, through my foot being caught in the
stirrup iron, after being thrown, and only through a providential
mishap to the unshod hoof of the horse was my life saved. I
could recount many hairbreadth escapes both in the taming of
the horses, and from drowning in the river, as some of us could
not swim at that time.
What shooting excursions too were indulged in when my


brothers came up from town on a visit. One brother had already
lost one limb and part of another by a gun accident, but he was
as ardent a sportsman as ever.
My other brother, the eldest, was a “ crack ” pigeon shot, who
at last fell a victim to his love of sport through camping out in
the wet on fishing and shooting excursions, at the lovely home as
I call it, during my residence there. I was very much attached
to this brother, who died at the early age Of twenty-six, just as
he had entered upon a most promising career of worldly success.
I was his constant companion in all such boating, fishing and
shooting excursions, in which the attendant danger was not too
great for a mere lad such as I then was. Of late years I have
recalled with thankfulness the belief (though I gave little heed
to it at the time), that this brother died in the happiness of the
Christian hope. These were “ gala ” days indeed that the arrival
of these brothers made for us. The days were spent in shooting,
riding, and swimming, the evenings in singing and dancing parties.
One incident, out of many that occurred, I shall now relate, ere
I close the story of those happy days. My eldest brother to
whom I was so much attached was a limb of the law, an Attorney,
Proctor, &c., of this Honorable Court, and possessed a quiet horse
at the town home, which he rode in a somewhat more dignified
style than did John Gilpin on his famous wedding day celebration
tour I trow. It happened one day when on a visit to us he wished
to take a ride, and he made a request for a quiet horse. An animal
rather restive was saddled up. We all waited round to see what
sort of a mount, not our “ country cousin,” but my town brother
would make. He wore (and on this hangs the joke) the “tall hat,”
a head covering not particularly common in the country. My
brother, accustomed only to his own quiet steed, cautiously at-
tempted to mount. After several unsuccessful trials he was about
to give up in despair, when one of the onlookers remarked in as
serious a manner as he could, “ I think the horse is afraid of the
tall hat,” My brother actually changed the hat, and after a few
more attempts was seated in the saddle and rode away. Sometimes
I think I had my revenge for the story of the confectionery shop, for
he was, you may be sure, often “ twitted about the horse and the


hat.” But you may ask how came it to pass that a parent
highly gifted, highly educated, allowed his son to waste these and
other precious years, as still later on I did, in pleasure and idle-
ness ? I can only reply, I have often since asked myself, why
indeed ? but in those days the why and the wherefore of my
parent’s dealings with me gave me no thought. My health at
this period could have offered no excuse for the need of a holiday,
for, prior to and during the whole of my stay here, my health was
excellent. Not a single lesson during all those years was I asked
to learn, nor was I once bidden to attend Church, and so I did
neither one nor the other.
I had reached my sixteenth year, when my father relinquished
the interest he had in this riverside home, and thereupon I
returned to the city home.
I was very loathe, I admit, to leave the river and give up my
freedom and country life, but after a short lapse of time, and
none of the dreadful things happening at the Grammar School to
which I was now sent, such as being tossed in a blanket, and
other like indignities, of which I had a fear, 1 earnestly settled
down to work. It was during these school days I first came
under religious impressions. Hitherto Sundays had been spent,
as the week days, in sport. Now, however, on my return, my
father as Incumbent of the Parish was under the necessity of
having me prepared for confirmation, for which purpose I was
placed under the charge of his curate. The religious impressions
I felt at this time lasted on and off about three years, after which
I sank into open sin for many long years. There entered into
my mind, however, some thoughts during this time, which under
God’s mercy, led me at last, after a protracted period of agonizing
doubt and bodily suffering, to abandon the vile impurities into
which I had sunk, and to seek repentance and light, I knew
nothing in those days of the existence of such books as Farrar’s
Eternal Hope, Cox’s Salvator Mundi, and similar writings, yet
like thoughts, as are therein contained, entered into my mind in
these schooldays, the result of which I relate later on. Two
years and a half I attended this school, at the end of which I
entered upon another long holiday of four years.


A LOVELY HOME.
I dreamt of bliss in pleasure’s bowers
While pillowing roses stayed my head
But serpents lurked among the flowers
I woke and thorns were all my bed.
T WAS eighteen years old when my studies ended in a manned
(1 that I little dreamed of. I had expected that, after a further
short period of schooling, I should then have entered upon
a University career, with a view to entering subsequently
the sacred ministry. My father, at an earlier date, had proposed
placing me under articles to my eldest brother and his partner.
I evaded this chance of legal training at this time, my brother’s
early death, and that of his partner shortly after, put an end to
all hopes in that direction. When I mentioned the church, my
father suggested the Medical profession as the goal of my am-
bition, for which, I confess, I had not the slightest inclination.
Before a final decision was come to, with regard to my future
path in life, an event occurred, that shaped my career wholly
different to what I had then set my heart upon. My health gave
way to such an alarming degree at this very period, that it
necessitated my being placed under the charge of a medical man.
I began to suffer from extreme weakness and nervous debility,
the direct outcome of years of previous evil-doing, having been
taught it as I have said, when too young to perceive the danger.
To me the warning “ Be sure thy sin will find thee out,” was
fulfilled in such a bitterness of anguish for over twenty years,
that human language fails to describe it.
At this critical period of my health, my father was about
completing the purchase of a country residence, whither he
intended to remove, and there spend his remaining days. It was
■uggested that such was the very spot where I could enjoy a change,
with the view of recuperating my shattered nervous system.


The period spent at the city Grammar School embraced many
happy days, and pleasant recollections. I had not been the
“ Dux,” of the school in book learning, but so diligently had I
worked during my attendance there, that in spite of my previous
three year’s holiday, and utter disregard of studies, during that
long period, I was well advanced in the foremost class. In the
cricket field I carried off the “ palm ” as the best bat of my day.
When, therefore, I consented to take a trip, it was not without a
pang I bade adieu to my schoolmates, although I had hoped
after a good holiday, that our acquaintance would be renewed
during a college life, and this expectation was more dwelt upon
from the fact, that my father had during my earlier years been
the intimate friend of the Mathematical Professor of the Univer-
sity, and likewise of the Warden of one of the affiliated colleges,
where they respectively resided. Through these edifices, in my
childhood I had frequently roamed, upon the occasions of my
aunt’s visits there. As the years gradually rolled on, I looked
forward more and more, till my eighteenth year, in hope of
spending some years at these seats of learning. Splendid oppor-
tunities lay before me, but alas ! I “ chose rather the pleasures
of sin for a season,” than the path of duty. “ I sowed to the
wind, I reaped the whirlwind.” The sequel shows how all my
fondly cherished hopes were to be for ever blighted.
My father having completed the negotiations with regard to
the purchase of the property, a few months later on my father,
aunt, I, and a few distant connections, after a sea voyage of a
few hundred miles, found ourselves located in a very romantic
spot, and which has ever been described, by those who visited it,
as one of the most beautiful and picturesque localities in the
Southern Hemisphere, Ocean, forest, river, lake, and mountains
being observable from one point of observation.
The site, upon which the residence was erected, had been chosen
on account of the extensive view that it commanded, of which I
will speak, after a short mention of the residence itself. The
residence had been built with due regard for sociability and
entertainment on a large scale The original owner, from whose
son my father purchased the property, was an officer of high


rank in Her Majesty’s Indian army, and during his tenure of the
estate it was the scene of many a brilliant gathering. These
elaborate festivities were not repeated in my father’s time, they
were far too costly, and had brought ruin at last upon the Indian
Officer, who once the possessor of very ample means, and
largely vested squatting interests, had spent his money too
freely here. The home was sometimes designated “ the hundred
roomed house,” to convey some idea of its spaciousness. From
what I heard related, I am not surprised at the ruin of the Indian
Officer. To add to the comfort of the occupants, a massive double
verandah on the western side warded off the rays of the setting
sun. This was the front of the home and over-looked the lake, a
beautiful sheet of water. The building was three storied, and at
the top of all was the watch tower. Standing under the double
verandah, (for there was another very long ordinary one on the
south side),, and looking westward, especially at sunset, a
panorama of natural scenery of surpassing loveliness met the view.
I will describe, most inadequately, I admit, something of the
landscape. At your feet lay as it were (for the edge of the lake
was scarcely half a mile distant from the residence) an expanse
of water, about four miles in length and two in breadth. The
intervening green sward sloping gently down, presented an un-
interrupted view of the lake, and adorned with trees and shrubs
of natural and artificial growth, some of great beauty, added to
the charm. Around the edge of the lake was a thick fringe of
rushes interspersed with native trees, to the right lay an island
in the waters of the lake. At sunset when everything was usually
calm, the mountains just west of the lake, and behind which the
sun sank to rest, clouds and trees would be mirrored on the
waters of the lake, and on its bosom the swan and other aquatic
birds could be discerned gliding gracefully along. Then might
this spot well be deemed an earthly paradise.
Here, in a certain sense, it might be said that nature was as
undisturbed, as though the place were in Equatorial Africa. The
estate consisted of three thousand acres, and the residence was
over three miles from the public road, and, on account of the
great belt of rushes mentioned, thick scrubs, and an immense


swamp, the lake was accessible only through means of a canal
and bridge formed at some cost by the first owner of the estate.
On the south, east, and west, stretched away millions of acres of
uninhabited thickly timbered country, the home of vast quantities
of various kinds of game, to which I shall presently allude.
Near the front verandah grew two lofty Norfolk Island Pine
trees. These I would climb on a still day to within a few
branches of the top, and the view thus commanded well repaid
the exertion. But for most of the visitors the watchtower
sufficed, from which, at ease, and in comfort, the ocean, lake,
forest, and large creek could be gazed upon, the ocean lying to
the east in a direct line about two miles away, not that you could
reach it in that short distance, as one day I found to my cost,
having to walk twenty miles, through missing the swamp crossing
in my ardour for seeking sport, e’er I arrived at home. The
watchtower, however, was for a more practical purpose than the
enlargement of the landscape, for, from it by means of a telescope,
a signal given on the passing steamer could be observed, and
thereupon the stately four-in-hand coach, with liveried attendants,
would proceed to the village port, seven miles distant, and thence
convey the guests to the Indian Officer’s home, where amidst a
scene of much conviviality he would be welcomed. My delight
centred in the lake, the forest, and ocean beach. To-day maybe
on the lake, gliding peacefully over its calm waters, or tossing on
its waves, should a sudden storm arise, to-morrow down upon the
ocean beach, riding, or walking, as the fancy led me, or perhaps
one of a party fishing in the creek, that emptied itself into the
sea, at another time exploring the forest with dog and gun.
Alas ! all too quickly passed those happy days away ! The
possessor of a vehicle of my own, some horses, dogs, firearms,
and fishing tackle, with game and fish in abundance close at hand,
there was no lack of pastime.
Besides affording a large supply of fish, the lake was the native
home of the wild swan, the duck, coot, and other birds that
frequent the water. Amongst the reeds they hatched their young.
One pastime that exercised our muscles, and was the cause of
much excitement to us, was the chase after the young swan just


before it could use its wings in flight. A very lightly constructed
boat was used in this sport, and as the young swan would grace-
fully glide off at right angles to the body of the boat as the bow
came near the bird, there would be need of much skilful manoeuvr-
ing to capture the prey. The creek three miles from home
witnessed many a camping out expedition.
In the forest the feathered tribes were plentiful. Pigeons of
rarious species, snipe, quail, plover, and other kind of game,
not omitting the wild turkey, to entice the sportsman. Then
for the naturalist there were birds of exquisite and varied plum-
age. Here in its native haunts, the Regent Bird, bedecked with
its strong contrast of burnished gold and shining dark velvety
attire, presented itself as a lovely and striking object to the eye
as it met the gaze, in the soft clear light of a bright spring day.
In the dense scrubs, some ten or twelve miles away, the Rifle
Bird might be seen to glitter in the sunlight, and there, that great
mimic of sounds, the Lyre Bird, kept his haunts, and at intervals
the Bellbirds’ notes would sound out sweetly on the air. It may
be, that my temperament, then somewhat inclined to the melan-
choly and excitable caste, and my previous course of reading,
helped to intensify my enjoyment of the natural charms that so
profusely existed here. My mind was imbued with the Arabian
Nights and other Fairy Tales. Ghost stories (which parents in
kindness to their young children should forbid), Greek and Roman
Mythologies, then the Poets, Novelists, Scott, Lytton, and others,
books of travel and adventure, Sketches of the lives of all the
celebrated Naturalists, and then the study of the Classics at
school, Horace, Homer, Virgil, parts of Euripides, and others.
Thus equipped I could have truly soliloquised,
Here about the beach I wandered, nourishing a youth sublime,
With the fairy tales of science, and the long results of time,”
as day after day, accompanied only by my dog (for I often pre-
ferred to go alone), my gun ready for action, in sportsmanlike
fashion I explored the water, or the forest, yet ever and anon
gazing upon the beauties of the wild landscape that spread out
before me. And what a picture I often gazed upon! Words of
mine could but faintly convey to those who have not enjoyed it


for themselves, the peacefulness and loveliness of a sunrise or
sunset, such as I have felt and looked upon, when languidly
reclining in the boat, that rested motionless upon the placid
bosom of the lake. Sportsman though I was, and the love of
sport ran strongly in the family, at such a time and place, it
seemed like desecration to make the sharp crack of the rifle
(that instrument of destruction amongst the feathered tribe) ring
out upon the silent air. My father who had resided in England,
Scotland, and Jamaica, spoke in the highest terms of the beauty
of the natural scenery.
There were times when the poets words became aptly appro-
priate,
“ Summer Isles of Eden lying in dark purple spheres of sea.”
Those were happy days, for I had not then cast aside that virtue,
or religion, without which, as Cicero declares, no one can be
happy. Occasionally I would visit the village, a seven mile ride,
calling upon my friends to arrange for some pleasure party. The
town itself, or I should rather call it the village, had an air of
romance about it. On its heights, at whose base the ocean rolled
its breakers, was here and there, a soldier’s grave, around which
there lingered many a tale.
For further change I would spend weeks with friends who lived
some thirty miles away, at the foot of a small mountain, and
close beside a rippling stream, which eventually enlarged into a
river. My journeys to these friends would take me through some
wild and picturesque country. The road ran for miles along the
bank of the river and stream just alluded to. Clear as crystal
flowed this rivulet over its bed of smoothly rounded pebbles,
affording an acceptable boon wherewith to quench the thirst,
in the sultry noon, by the coolness and purity of the water.
In the spring of the year the beauty of the scenery along the
river’s banks was increased by the native foliage ; itself of various
hues, being interspersed with the flower of the edible passion
fruit, and blossom of the English peach. The willow tree throve
in all its luxuriance, and the small leaved native fig tree grew
round and compact as a ball. Festoons of creepers hung from
the native trees, forming with the undergrowth in many places


an impenetrable mass. Scented flowers perfumed the air, whilst
others displayed their variegated colours. Edible native fruits,
such as the raspberry, one kind particularly delicious with sugar
and cream, the gooseberry, and other sorts were likewise obtain-
able.
Such was the locality, where unfettered and unrestrained I
spent four happy years, just as I was emerging into manhood,
building castles in the air, alas ! to be too rudely, and ruthlessly
cast down. Yet one incident occurred towards the close of my
residence here, that proved invaluable to me in after years. My
attention was called to Tom Paine’s “ Age of Reason,” by a
Frenchman who had the supervision of a vineyard, or rather of
its laying out I should say, as my father died before the time of
its fruitage. In my ignorance then, I was rather carried away
with Paine’s sophistries, but fortunately for me, I had previously
glanced at a volume of Christian Evidences in my father’s library,
to these I at once had further recourse. I was satisfied that
Paine’s objections were fully refuted. I referred the Frenchman
to the Evidences of Christianity, but, as he shortly afterwards
left my father’s service, I cannot say what effect the Evidences
had upon his mind.
In respect of this matter let me repeat what it is related, that
prince of philosophers (whom one historian speaks of as the
greatest mind of the human race ever born to teach his fellow
men, Sir Isaac Newton), said to Halley the Astronomer when
Halley made some infidel remark in Sir Isaac’s presence : “ Dr.
Halley, I am always pleased to hear you speak on astronomy, as
I know you have studied it, I have studied Christianity, and am
certain you have not.” And now at last all this happiness drew
to a close. As if by the touch of an enchanter’s wand, all became
changed, and how changed you will undoubtedly perceive, as you
peruse the following pages.


“ Men laugh and riot till the feast is o’er,”
“Then comes the reckoning and they laugh no more.”
GOING TO RUIN.
JHAD just entered upon my twenty-second year, when my
father died. I was not long left in ignorance of the fact
that my father had invested his all, during the few short
years that he had lived in retirement, in various experi-
mental ways in connection with the homestead, the results of
which would now scarcely more than realize as many hundred
pounds as he had thereon expended thousands. Like Professor
Huxley’s theory of the atom, life on one side, and dead matter
on the other, which the maid of the kitchen would find accept-
able, especially in damp weather, if only it would work out in
practice, and the live side keep the wood dry, and warm, so my
father’s calculations, though apparently correct on paper, and
thus giving hopes of some profit, practically resulted in a large
loss. My father’s income likewise ceased at his death, and my
aunt’s income was too limited to maintain so expensive a home,
for I must inform you that, when my father purchased the
property he had just received a few thousands of pounds in hard
cash, in addition to which, he still received the yearly income,
ceasing, as I said, at his death. Under these circumstances it
soon became apparent that in a few short months I must quit
forever this delightful home. To me it was indeed a bitter blow.
It is said that disappointment either makes us morally better or
worse. We either rise above or sink beneath our load of grief.
I sank beneath its weight, and how low I ultimately sank, God
and myself only know.
All my religious impressions now vanished, only to return after
years of terrible mental and spiritual anguish, and much physical
lassitude, not as impressions only, but burnt into my very soul as
if by fire as realities.


A few months after my father’s remains were laid in the grave,
I took my unwilling departure with aching heart, and dread
foreboding of the future. The poet sings “ coming events cast
their shadows before,” and truly for me they did.
I was now to seek my fortune, or rather I should say mis-
fortune, in the Metropolis, near which I first saw the light of day.
Upon my arrival there, I received the few hundred pounds that
fell to my share after the resale of the property and adjustment of
affairs. In a few months I spent the bulk of this money, intent
upon the gaieties of city life. Church-going no longer had any
attraction for me; and pleasure, noc duty, being all my search.
Sundays and week-days were alike spent in dissipation. A
Sunday lunch with a well-to-do friend would be followed by a
ride, or drive to some fashionable hotel, returning late in
the evening, mostly in a state of insobriety, or, may be, the
Sunday afternoon would be passed away at some watering place.
The opera and play house engaged many of my week-day
evenings.
My aunt, with whom I resided, had exercised some control as yet
over my outward actions, but after her death I plunged into those
excesses, which at length brought me to the verge of insanity and
the grave. My behaviour did nevertheless occasion my aunt some
deep misgiving, and just prior to her death she warned me, for
I had, it seems, filled her loving and gentle spirit with alarm, but
alas, she warned in vain. Twelve months after our return to the
Metropolis she died. Bad as I was, I sorely missed her. How
could it be otherwise! She had spoilt me it was true, but her
patience and unselfishness were stamped upon my memory as
something divine. No sooner had she passed away than my
feelings became unbearable, I resigned the position I had been
fortunate enough to obtain, just as my money was all but expended
on city life, and selling all my belongings I started upon another
holiday. It was during this holiday of twelve months duration
that I met a friend who had known me at the Lake home, when
I was religiously inclined. He was at this time studying for the
Church, and the high dignitary, under whose tuition he then was,
at my friends instigation, intimated that he would be pleased to


prepare me for the like sacred office. At that time it rang in my
ears like a horrid mockery to suggest such a course to me, living
as I then was (unknown to my friend), in flagrant sin. I ab-
solutely refused the offer, and yet about fourteen years later on,
during which years I became thoroughly steeped in vice, I was
led, through a clergyman obtaining for me (against my wish as
you shall hear), a Lay Reader’s License, to decide not for the
sacred ministry, but for that, without which such a profession is
but a hollow sham, even a Christian life.
When my purse became exhausted, I again returned to the
Metropolis, and found employment, but how unfit I was for any
kind of employment at all! The excitement of city life, and the
hope of reaping a rich harvest by fortunate speculation had
buoyed me up somewhat during my aunt’s lifetime, but now that
she was gone, I lost hope in that direction. Now it was that
I cursed the hardness of my lot. The service that I engaged in
was not arduous, but it entailed confinement upon me, and that
I did not like. My health did not improve nor my temper either
as I chafed and fumed. “ Bound to the earth man lifts his eyes
to heaven. Is it a boon so kindly given that being we would be
again ?” Assuredly I should have answered, no. Willingly
would I have put an end to my miserable existence, had I not
held that, it is “ better to bear the ills we have than fly to others
that we know not of, ” such a burden had life become to me.
In worldly dissipations I sought to bury my sorrows. Full
many a time, after I had thrown aside the last restraint of virtue,
came back to me Lord Byron’s words with maddening power—
There’s not a joy the world can give,
Like that it takes away,
When the glow of early thought declines,
In feeling’s dull decay ;
’Tis not on youth’s smooth cheek
The blush alone which fades so fast,
But the tender bloom of heart is gone,
E’er youth itself is past.
Then the few, whose spirits float above
The wreck of happiness,
Are driven o’er the shoals of guilt
Or ocean of excess ;


The magnet of their course is gone,
Or only points in vain ;
The shore to which their shivered sail
Shall never stretch again.
Byron gives us here but what every soul that wilfully and
willingly sins, must sooner or later undoubtedly re-echo, the wail
of a hopeless despair. It is for such as these “ who sit in
darkness and in the shadow of death, being fast bound in affliction
and iron, because they rebelled against the word of God, and
condemned the counsel of the Most High,” that my life history is
recorded as another witness to the truth of the Psalmist’s
utterances, in the tenth to the fourteenth verses of the one
hundred and seventh psalm, that they too may perceive that there
is likewise mercy for them if they will but seek it, and to point
them to that Friend of whom every true Christian is bound in his
inmost heart to believe for himself and wish for others, as
expressed in the lines—
“T could not do without Him,
Jesus is more to me
Than all the richest treasures
Of earth can ever be.
But the more I find Him precious,
And the more I find Him true,
The more I long that you should know
What He can be to you.”
I have already told you that I chafed at the confinement I was
subjected to. Each bright day recalled only too vividly the
freedom I once enjoyed. Every casual mention of the home so
dear to me went like a dagger through my heart, for the galling
thought would cut me sharp, that even if I could go back, all the
ties that had bound me to the spot were dissolved for ever. My evil
course too, when I did stop to think, seemed to be transferring all
my former joys and pleasures into goads, wherewith to sting me.
An evil spirit of unrest was upon me, and whither I should have
wandered I know not, had not an event taken place that stopped my
wanderings. I married. I was, however, by no means contented
with my indoor occupation, so that no sooner had I accumulated
by saving and fortunate speculation a few hundred pounds, than I


entrusted the whole to a person, I deemed reliable, to invest in a
business venture, that I hoped would eventually yield me a limited
income in a more independent position. My partner either
deceived me, or knew less of the business than I did. He anyway
had all the enjoyment, whilst I had to “pay the piper.” After
this loss I grew, if that were possible, more discontented and
bitter at heart than ever. Eight years had now passed since I
had left the Lake home, and a godless discontented life I had led
in very truth, although I tried hard to find solace in all sorts of
pleasures.
I had married at the age of twenty-six, and at my thirtieth
year my second child was bom. I mention this merely, because
it was when this child was about two months old, I carried her
upstairs to her bed, whilst I was in a sort of trancelike state,
consequent upon a collapse of the system, which I shall now
shortly touch upon. About the hour of eight o’clock of this
particular night I began to read aloud to my wife. Suddenly the
book fell from my hands, my eyes became fixed upon the light, I
grew rigid and quite cold. My wife rushed over to me, I tried to
speak, and tell her I was dying, but I had become speechless.
How long I remained in this state I could not say, and my wife
was too terrified to take any particular notice as to the duration
of the attack. When I came to, I still remained dazed for some
length of time. The maid was away, and my wife dared not leave
me. Next morning the doctor was called in. He said it was due
to a momentary stoppage of the heart’s action, but this never
accounted for the after effects, not physical, but mental, that I
endured. A week later on I felt the attack coming on again, and
warned my wife to take me to the doctor at once. All will power
seemed gone, I went with her as if I were in a dream. Shortly
after this I suffered such awful mental agony, that a quarter of an
hour appeared an eternity to me. These were the only two acute
attacks I had, but years of misery followed, much bodily weakness
and mental torment.
About two months later on, when I had somewhat recovered
from these sudden collapses, my thoughts reverted, strange fact,
to religion. I say strange, because I had done my utmost to keep


all that away. Such a book as the Bible found no place in my
library at that time. I did my best, for the eight years prior to
this, to forget that there existed such a book, for a life of sin such
as I led, and the teachings of the Bible don’t agree. In all truth
my conscience had been seared with a hot iron. But now I
suddenly began to pray and fast, in such a manner as to excite
the alarm of my wife and some friends, who observed my behaviour
at the time.
People talk of religious mania, certainly I could not lay claim
to having too much religion, and say that was deranging my mind.
My relatives and friends would scarcely have admitted that to be
the case, knowing, as they did, my thoroughly godless life. I was
not in this state because I had too much religion, or too much
hope. The truth in my case (and I can only speak for myself),
was, that I had lost all hope, because I had given up, and scoffed
at all religion ; and now the finite seeking to grasp the Infinite by
his own puny powers, proved as abortive, as for the whale to
attempt to drink up the sea it lives in.
In this awful plight of unrest I began to frequent diverse
churches, and even found my way to the Salvation Army Barracks,
so tormented in spirit was I.
One night in particular I knelt at the penitential form of the
Army so long, that the few who remained said at last, “ you
don’t want to be saved.” I replied that I would stay there all
night, if they could do me any good. I remained till past mid-
night, and they grew weary of me, but thank God, He the all
Patient all Merciful One still bore with me, otherwise I should not
be relating the occurrence after the lapse of many long years. My
wife, who was ignorant of my whereabouts on this occasion till
one of the officers of the Army informed her, was naturally much
distressed at my absence. After this I sought relief from a Church
of England Clergyman. He said to me “ you appear to believe
the threatenings of God, why not accept His promises in Christ
Jesus ? ” He referred me likewise to the sixteenth article of the
Church.
I now attended some Evangelical Services, and whilst at these
Mission Meetings I obtained some peace of mind, but during the


journeys home after the services my agony of spirit was almost
more than I could endure. Eventually despair took such hold
upon me and drove me to the commission of acts of such iniquity
that the marvel is how I escaped a derangement of the mind,
instead of recovering my health as years later on I did in a most
marked manner.
My health, of necessity became affected by my procedure, and
again my medical adviser was consulted. He plainly expressed
the opinion that I should go mad unless I gave over thinking :
then I replied I must become so, for of a certainty I cannot give
up thinking. It was then decided that I should try a change,
sick leave was obtained, but do not suppose that I ceased to think.
No, I spent my holiday fishing, and rowing, and reading religious
books, pursuing my religious inquiries long after my holiday had
ended. Openly sinning at one time, devouring religious books
and praying at another : those of you, who may have read the
true description of the atheist Voltaire’s death, have a description
of my state at this time, but thank God I was not cut off then
in that awful state, awful at any time, let one assure you who
has felt it.
Sick at heart, I imagined that I should become somewhat
contented if I could only realize a few thousands of pounds, and
engage in rural pursuits. With this object in view I entered into
land speculations with all the money that I could save. In
former years I had made large profits on small investments, and
spent the money as already indicated. I looked forward with hope
that a few years would place at my disposal sufficient for a fair
start. Alas for the third time I was to learn a bitter lesson. In
the midst of all my expectations, a national monetary collapse
took place, ruining many, and utterly depreciating all land values,
of which I shall speak in another chapter.
I was making haste to grow, if not rich, at least in a sense
independent. Contented I was by no means with all my hopes at
this time of making money. My family during these years
increased, and thoughts with regard to their moral welfare began
to force themselves upon me. I was reaping the fruits of a god-
less irreligious life, the outcome of which was becoming more


apparent year by year in my discontent and ill health. Such did
not appear a desirable heritage to bequeath to my children. As
Dives in the parable wished his brethren warned against coming
into his place of torment, so I had no desire for my children to
follow in my steps. How often would Tom Hood’s lines cut me
to the heart,
“ But now ’tis little joy
To know I’m further off from heaven,
Than when I was a boy.”
But the crown of all my sorrows came back to me in the recol-
lection of bygone happiness, and loss of innocence of heart. Here
was the adding of grief to grief, for without the shadow of a doubt
the poet truly sings when he says that,
“ A sorrow’s crown of sorrow is remembering happier things.”
This is the chief ingredient in the cup of the backslider, which
constitutes its awful poison, verily “ the backslider shall be filled
with his own ways,” and of this cup I had drunk deeply.


BANKRUPTCY and the MIRACLE
OF REPAIR.
“ Ah who can say, however fair his view,
Through what sad scenes his path may lie ;
Ah who can give to others woe his sigh
Secure his own will never need it too.”
KIEKE WHITE.
JHAD now reached a condition of mind when I could truly say,
“ despair is worse than pain,” physical pain. Give a man
hope,andhe will exhibit marvellous powers of endurance; let
him lose hope and what indeed remains ? At the commence-
ment of my monetary investments, and for some years following,
all bid fair to meet my expectations. I could on several occasions
have disposed of my land purchases at considerable advantage, but
declined to do so, believing that after the lapse of a few more
years I should be enabled to realize thereon very handsome
profits indeed, but e’er these years had sped the whole country
became, as I have hinted, involved in pecuniary troubles, and
landowners were at their wit’s end, some of them succumbing to
their losses either in a hastened death or maddened brain. I saw
now that years of hard savings were gone, and that I could only
hope to avoid bankruptcy by still further years of monetary loss.
Sleepless nights, nights of deep anxiety, and dread followed,
for a time my mind hung in the balance, and was it any wonder ?
I was in ill health at the time, the direct result of my misdeeds,
and the record of my life pressed heavily upon me, and what a
record ! Three times after an open profession of religion, each
time I backslided. One period of this profession had lasted
about three years, during a year of w 7 hich I had been a Sunday
School Teacher, and a Communicant. The other periods of my
religious feelings extended over some months. Ido think I can


honestly say, I never acted the hypocrite in religion. Whilst my
religious emotions lasted I kept from sinning, when these
impressions subsided, I relapsed into open sin. After each fall
I sank, if possible, lower than before. I defied my Maker, for I
had become at last, as one “ without God and without hope in
the world.” I most assuredly believed that I had committed the
unpardonable sin, and looked upon myself as enclosed in that
iron cage of despair, out of which John Bunyan represents that
there is no exit. No wonder that at this time the old school
master of my childish years used to remark when he saw me,
that I looked as though I had all the cares of the world upon my
back. Verily I had a load that few would care to bear willingly.
Texts such as these rang in my ears, “it is impossible for
those who were once enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly
gift, and were made partakers of the Holy Ghost, - - - - if they
shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance, seeing they
crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and put Him to an
open shame,” “ for if we sin wilfully after that we have received
the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sins but a fearful
looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall con-
sume the adversaries.” Well might I exclaim, “ Thy terrors
have I suffered with a troubled mind,” and that for long years.
I needed no preacher to convince me that there was a hell for the
guilty and awakened conscience, which awakening, God grant
may come to all who peruse these pages, in this existence, so that
they may escape a more awful doom hereafter. To me the
Apostle’s words might truthfully have been applied, “to deliver
such an one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh, that the
spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus.” Whilst I lay
in this anguish of soul, a friend spoke to me of Canon Farrar’s
book, “ Eternal Hope,” touching upon a subject which had
haunted my mind, when only seventeen years old, though I was
quite unaware, until my friend at this time told me, of the
existence of any writings upon such a theme.
Eagerly did I devour that book. It was however but the
beginning of the inquiry. Doubts of all kinds took possession of
me, and only after studying writings both in favour of and adverse


to this hope, with the utmost anxiety and with a final appeal to
the Scriptures did hope return.
Just as I was about to sink under the accumulated weight of
ill health, pecuniary disaster, and religious, or to speak more
correctly, irreligious despair, hoped revived, and in God’s good
providence my health likewise slowly improved.
To me those beautiful lines of Frances Eidley Havergal’s
assumed a reality, for—
“To a heart where emptiness seemed emptier, made
By colourless remains of tasteless pleasure,
One came and pitying the hollow shade
Poured in His own strong love in fullest measure.”
And indeed my heart had become empty, for the pleasures of
sin having lost their first sweetness, and yielding now nothing
but the foulness of decay, “ for the wages of sin is death,” the
death of all that is pure, and noble in the soul, added agony to
agony. The memory of my evil ways had become “ the savour
of death unto death ” to me, for the poet’s warning—
“ Let no heart brave its power
With guilty thoughts o’ercast,
For then a poisoned flower
Is the memory of the past.”
had most practically and entirely been disregarded by me. One
question has often forced itself upon me since. How came Ito
escape the overthrow of my mental faculties when others did not ?
The very friend, who acting as an agent for me, purchased most
of the land on my behalf, through which I became ruined in
pocket, partly succumbed I believe, to his own losses in the
selfsame direction. He died shortly after the National disaster,
in respect to land speculations took place, thereupon the very
furniture was sold under the eyes of his wife, and e’er long she
was an inmate of a lunatic asylum, leaving two helpless babes
upon the world. After my own wonderful recovery, I can only
say, God forbid that I should ever limit the goodness of Him,
“ whose tender mercies are over all His works,” and of whom
South says, “ God never creates what His mercy cannot embrace,”
My reason, itself the gift of God, my personal experience, partly
set out in these pages, certain expressions in God’s word, and


those great general principles, that ran through the whole of the
Scriptures. God’s love, His unchangeableness, and all this mani-
fested towards fallen man, spoken of in these terms by Him who
knows only too well what is in the hearts of men, “ye are of your
father the devil,” rather lead me to accept that hope, which some
godly men of the church of England hold, and which Luther
himself expressed thus, “ God forbid that I should limit the time
for acquiring faith to the present life. In the depths of the
divine mercy there may be opportunity to win it in future state,”
and which hope that great master mind Bishop Butler appears to
open out, in parts of the third and fifth chapters of his “ An-
alogy,” part 1,, for he speaks of a combat hereafter and the
possible reclamation of the vicious by the example of the good in
the future state. As I regained hope, I began to attend Divine
service frequently. After an attendance on my part of three
years, the Lay-Reader of the church resigned, and I was asked to
accept the position. I declined as I had so far made no definite
decision with respect to the Christian life, nor was I at this time a
Communicant at the Lord’s Table. Again the office was pressed
upon me, once more I refused to allow the Clergyman to nominate
me to the Bishop as a Lay-Reader, more especially as just at this
juncture a few of my friends had been discussing in my presence,
how unfit a person was to hold the position, who did not conform
to the outward requirements of religion, even, to say nothing of
any reality within. Shortly after this, much to my surprise, I
was appointed, without my consent, and the Bishop’s Licence
placed in my hands. It now only remained for me, either
absolutely to refuse, and return the License, or decide to accept
the duty, and with God’s help to lead a different life. This time
I decided for Christ, for I had no wish to live over again the
last fifteen years of my accursed sinful life, intolerable almost at
times, full of wasted opportunities, regrets, and dark despair, and
from the time of that decision I date the commencement of a new
life and, physically, the miracle of repair.


PRESSING CREDITORS.
WHEN a man really becomes aware that he lias reached a
state of bankruptcy, it is one matter to wish he had
not arrived at such a condition of things, and another
to find that some of his creditors are determined
to pursue him to the bitter end. The latter course some of
them followed with respect to myself, as you shall hear in
the next chapter. In the meanwhile they did not fail to
remind me of my indebtedness, and of what might possibly
be its unpleasantness in the end. When, therefore, I determined
as a matter of absolute necessity, to relinquish all my effects
for the benefit of my creditors, I was by no means in a
position to be envied, and the after effects of my bankruptcy
were in some ways disagreeable for a time. So it was when I
turned my back upon my former life. I had sold myself to work
sin for years, and my old master was not one likely to part with
my services without expostulation, and so I truly found such was
the case. I had been a backslider, and of all men he needs most
the grace of God to help him, for he gathers around him an array
of obstacles the most difficult to surmount. His old master
often whispers in his ear, “ Oh you will soon come back to your
old service,” an insinuation full of poignant pain, yet nevertheless
like nauseous medicine, exerting a wholesome effect ultimately-
And because “ even so it is now, as then, he that was born
after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the Spirit.”
The backslider must needs meet the bitter taunt of those who
are cognizant of his backslidings (for there is many a Shimei in
the world yet), that it is but hypocrisy under the guise of which
he would again fulfil his sinful desires, shifting their ground of
attack to make the false charge of hypocrisy, well knowing that
those who sin as I have done, seek no religious cloak to pursue


their sins under. It is at such times as these that he feels his
utter weakness, and the need of the grace of God to uphold him
in the battle. Most earnestly and solemnly do I wish that I had
the power to so represent, as I have felt it, the scathing agony
that pierces the once backslider, as the sneer is flung back to him
by those he would lead into the narrow way of safety, that he is
insincere, the very fact that his own past behaviour lends some
colour for such an accusation, creating its own most bitter
sting. In many unlocked for ways the law of retribution asserts
itself, for the grace of God does not destroy the results of sin as
regards the natural punishment, but supplies the power of
resistance and endurance in the midst of the otherwise over-
whelming temptation. And this strength only comes after a
sinner has recognised the fact that, paramount to all, is the truth,
that against God he has sinned, ‘ ,£ against Thee, Thee only have
I sinned,” and has cast himself in trust upon that infinite mercy,
which God has revealed in Christ Jesus His Son.
To the only place of refuge, the Cross of Christ, I betook
myself, when I saw that I was spiritually bankrupt, for I
discovered at last that there alone I could avoid my soul’s
creditors, who where arraigning me at the bar of high heaven, by
a recital in my aroused and terrified conscience, of those sins I
had been guilty of, in fulfilling the lusts of the flesh in every
conceivable shape, and found that —
“ Through His Son our precious Saviour,
God will pardon all our sin,
Will forgive our past behaviour,
Open heaven and let us in.”


THE BANKRUPTCY COURT AND
A CERTIFICATE.
The ills we see ;
The mysteries of sorrow, deep and long,
The dark enigmas of permitted wrong,—
Have all one key ;
This strange sad world is but our Father’s school—
All chance and change His love shall grandly overrule,
—F. E. HAVEKGAL.
HE Land Companies were determined that I should be
branded with the Official Stamp of the Bankruptcy Court,
notwithstanding that I was quite willing to forego all
moneys (a considerable sura) that I had paid to them, and
relinquish any claim I might have to the land property I had
thereby acquired.
The outlook was not inviting, for there depended upon me at
this time a wife and seven helpless children, helpless because all
quite young, one of them moreover being a cripple, and on that
account needing special care and attention. Besides all this a
further addition to the family was shortly expected, who in fact
arrived on the very day that I obtained my “ Order of Discharge”
from the Court. It was also forcibly hinted to me that should
any hitch occur to delay the obtaining of my Certificate of Dis-
charge, my position would be at stake, the limited supply of
household effects that I possessed might even be seized upon, and
I with a sick wife and eight children cast upon the world.
This was a dark picture, dark enough surely, rising up before
me, made blacker at the eleventh hour by one of the Companies
opposing the granting of my Certificate of Discharge. Six years
prior to this, and a picture not nearly so dark, involving only the
fear of losing all my money, all but unhinged my mind, and yet
under this latter blacker cloud, I suffered but some slight attacks


of depression, which soon were put to flight. Now the whole
secret is this. In the latter case I had laid hold upon hope, and
hope has well been described, as “ an angel of the soul;”
But my troubles by no means ended with my Order of Dis-
charge. In my efforts to avoid bankruptcy, for the six years
prior thereto, I denied myself the obtaining articles of household
furniture, to a great extent indispensable, in view of my increasing
family. Then came Law Costs in respect to my obtaining my
Discharge. Expenses incident upon my wife’s illness, to meet
which I had no funds reserved, not one single penny, and to
crown all, a month later my income was materially reduced.
Yes, I was most wofully bankrupt. Five years before this I had
been taught that I was in a more awful, infinitely more awful,
state of bankruptcy than this, a state of spiritual bankruptcy.
Reader, have you ever become aware that you are spiritually bank-
rupt, for that after all is the most momentous bankruptcy ? If you
have been so taught and would seek a Certificate of Discharge that
shall annul your past obligations, and allow you to start afresh with
better hopes and loftier moral and spiritual aspirations, do not
despair. I obtained it, and so may you, and as the greater
always embraces the less, it saved me in the hour of my temporal
bankruptcy when the sky was blackest. The door of hope is open
to you whoever you are, and whatsoever deed you may have been
guilty of, if only you will sincerely seek repentance and commit
yourself to the hands stretched out in the darkness to aid you.
You cannot have sinned more deeply against your God than I
have done, against the human law you may have, but surely the
offence against God, when you learn to judge correctly, is of an
infinitely more heinous and grievous a character. I have already
told you that I cannot stain these pages with a recital of the acts
of iniquity that I was guilty of. Suffice for you to know that I
tasted of every sinful pleasure that man is capable of tasting, and
drank copiously of some of the most vile. My heart was filled
with the deepest enmity towards God and man. I “loved
cursing ” verily “ I clothed myself with cursing like as with a
garment.” No human being ever poured forth language more
vile or foul than fell from my lips. Alas, such language is not


confined to the ignorant classes. Education is of itself no bar to
it. The gentleman of talent and learning as distinguished from
the Christian gentleman is not uncommonly tainted with this
impurity, and the name of God is all to glibly uttered by the
tongue of many. Profane and impure talk will undoubtedly re-
bound sooner or later upon those who use it to their utter shame
and confusion as it assuredly did in my case. “ God will not hold
him guiltless that taketh His Name in vain.” For though “ Thou
wast a God that forgavest me ” nevertheless “ Thou tookest
vengeance of my inventions.”
Till I nearly reached my thirty-seventh year I revelled in
godless pleasure, with the short intermissions that I have
mentioned, making attempts to abandon my sins, but only to sink
deeper as the years rolled on. By the goodness of God alone I
escaped suicide, when once in particular impelled all but thereto
under the influence of drink and disappointment. In a marked
manner too was I saved from a softening of the brain as I have
before hinted at, the outcome that must most naturally have
followed my evil doings, had God not otherwise in mercy ordained
it. Holy John Bradford once said, pointing to a murderer, “ there
but for the grace of God goes John Bradford.” Those best
acquainted with the evil in their own hearts will readily ac-
quiesce in his statement.
So it came to pass that in trusting God for spiritual welfare I
found help in worldly difficulties also, and proved his promise
true “ 1 will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
me.” “ Call upon me in the day of trouble I will deliver thee
and thou shalt glorify me,” and I experienced that He is “ a very
present help in time of trouble,” and learnt something of the
deep truth and hidden beauty of God’s purpose as revealed in
that magnificent psalm of David, the thirty-seventh psalm.
Presumably no one seeks for trouble, yet as “man is born to
sorrow as the sparks fly upwards,” it is wisdom to know where
help can be obtained when needed. Do not despair then, however
low you may have sunk.
Sinner despair not, Christ stoopeth low*
To rescue the soul that is lost in sin,
And to raise it to life and enjoyment again.


Yes, infinitely low he stoops. Take courage then and come
direct to Him, by a personal trust of your own, “ Him that
cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out,” is the wide reaching
invitation. Think not however that the return journey is easy ;
I tell you plainly and candidly it is not. Do not expect to go all
the journey in a sleeping berth, and yet if so minded, the weakest
may find sufficient strength to uphold him on the way. The road
from earth to heaven is long, and the pilgrim sometimes grows
weary, for—
There are sandy tracts that lie
Cold and sunless vast and drear,
through which the pathway leads. At times the Christian may
be depressed and downcast, but victory is assured him, in spite
of all. Could it be expected that lof all others would pursue
my return without some grievous falls ?
The Christian’s course has aptly been compared to the
advancing tide, in which there are occasional relapses of the
waves, but on the whole there is an onward progressive movement
of the waters. “ Whosoever will live godly in Christ Jesus,” says
the apostle, “ shall suffer persecution,” and again “ through much
tribulation we must enter into the kingdom of heaven.” My
backslidings had so intensified these truths for me that I might
well exclaim, “ who is sufficient for these things ? ” Had I not
found that “ when the enemy comes in like a flood the Spirit of
the Lord puts him to flight,” thus teaching the believer, that
“ all our sufficiency is of God,” I would have been irretrievably
overwhelmed.
For here so strong the evil seems,
So weak appears the good ;
Our standard wavers in the rush
Of evil like a flood.
At times through the long lonely watch,
Nor sun nor moon appears,
Without incessant fightings are
Within incessant fears.
But in our stronger hours we grasp
The warrior’s sword again,
And burn the good fight yet to fight
The faithful watch maintain.


“ In this warfare there is no discharge ” and it embraces “ the
manifold temptations that death alone can cure ” in the case of
the believer. Sore pressed at times when my religious emotions
subsided to their lowest ebb, and my heart seemed too stony to
contain the love of God, what remained but to cling at such
times, hard and fast to the bare promises of God, the Immutable
One, who gives encouragement to the sons of men in these, and
other like words : “I will heal their backslidings.” “Him that
cometh unto me I will in no wise cast out.” “My strength is
made perfect in weakness.” I will never leave thee nor forsake
thee.” Often would I feel the need of re-echoing the lines, —
Trust Him when dark doubts assail thee,
Trust Him when thy strength is small,
Trust Him when to simply trust Him,
Seems the hardest thing of all.
The great lesson that I had to learn was, that it was faith, not
religious emotion that I must cultivate, that so I might build
upon the sure Word of God, and upon the ever fluctuating
emotions of the heart, the natural feelings, which had so often
deceived me, and each time sunk me to a lower hell of
iniquity, and despair. I was being taught that I must “ not
trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus’ name.” But
“ all things are possible to him that believeth.” Having found
the grace of God sufficient to raise me up out of my slough of
despair, I bear record that no human being who reads my life
history, can ever after plead that it is not sufficient for him, if he
but seeks for it. “ The door of repentance may never be closed,”
says Canon Farrar. I have no wish to close it. I would but add
my own bitter and woful experience to add weight to Canon
Farrar’s warning set forth in his book “ Eternal Hope,” and
remark, that if repentance in this life is so agonizing as I have
found it to be, then if hereafter it still may be, how unutterably
awful it must then be. For if the part shining of the Eternal
Light upon a human soul be terrible, what the full glare will be,
your own reason must consider. I merely raise the question to
arrest your attention upon the subject. Be warned in time then.
Remember that “ it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of


the living God ” who is “ a consuming fire,” and be not one who
“ after thy hardness and impenitent heart treasurest up unto
thyself wrath against the day of wrath,” but rather let “ the
goodness of God lead thee to repentance.”
But whether men preach hope hereafter, or not, and I have
already expressed my thoughts upon the matter, my repentance
most fully declares its possibility in this state of existence, for
every one who desires to repent.
There is a class of people who rather ridicule the idea of such
a sinner as David being a man “ after God’s own heart.” I
myself thank God it is so recorded as it reveals the far reaching
mercy of God to penitents. Reader, have you ever perused a
discourse of that celebrated critic, the late Dr. Lightfoot, Bishop of
Durham, touching upon the fall of Judas. Judas is therein set
forth as having lost hope. Undoubtedly when anyone does that
and fully awakens to the consciousness of such a fact he sinks
into utter despair. But such a state need never be yours if only
you will accept as truthful what I have herein recorded of myself,
because then there can be no ground for despair, but only for
hope, and hope is salvation, “ for the Lord taketh pleasure in
them that fear Him, in them that hope in His mercy.” First
fear, “ the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom,” then
hope, in His mercy as revealed in His Son. Doubtless it is hard
to hope, at times it is true when all seems dark. The patriarch
Jacob could exclaim, “ all these things are against me,” faithful
Abraham could ask Sarah to say, she was his sister, the poet
Cowper found it hard at times to trust, and so have other
Christians. There will be need at times of much patience. We
may have to say ofttimes—
My half day’s work is done, and this is all my part,
I give a patient God my patient heart,
And clasp His banner still, though all its blue be dim,
These stripes no less than stars, lead after Him.
Hard and agonizing though on such occasions it may be to
spell out the lesson of trust, yet for the weakest by the grace of
God which is promised to all that asked, it is possible.
The trial of faith is called “the fiery trial,” and fire scorches,


smarts, and pains, when applied to the flesh as you are aware.
That the trial of your faith being much more precious than of
gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire.” Nevertheless
it is likewise declared, that “ God is faithful who will not suffer
you to be tempted above that you are able, but will with the
temptation also make a way of escape that ye may be able to
bear it.”
But now the difficulty of the whole matter presents itself, and
I must here throw the whole onus and responsibility upon your
shoulders, patient reader. I have fulfilled my part, it only
remains for you to do yours.
The difficulty is this, how am I going to persuade you that all
I have related of myself is true so that you too may lay hold upon
“ that hope which is the anchor of the soul, both sure and stead-
fast ? I cannot transfer to you my experience in such a way as
to make you conscious of its bitterness, as if you had endured it
yourself. I could indeed mention witnesses who could vouch
for the truthfulness and reality of what is narrated herein, in so
far as fact and action can he observed in a person’s life and
testified thereto by another, but to you who may not know these
persons such a course would avail nothing. I can, therefore, in
conclusion only reiterate that all I have penned with regard to
myself is thoroughly reliable.
I cannot as I have said, believe for you, no man can believe
for another, such must be a personal act. Let me ask you,
therefore, to accept not my testimony only, but that of two of
England’s most distinguished Physicians, who have not long
passed away, and then you who may be in the gloom of despair
shall by accepting and trusting individually the same living
loving personal Friend, as they did, possess the witness in
yourself, and know that the religion of Jesus Christ means
something more than a mere turning over a new leaf, or a mere
outward reformation, and abandonment of some one or more sins
only. You shall discover that it is in fact, a new birth, with new
hopes and changed desires, and the creation in the heart of a
new affection. Here then are the words of the discoverer of
chloroform, the late Sir J. Y. Simpson, “ I saw myself a sinner


standing on the brink of ruin deserving nought but hell: for one
sin, no, for many, committed against the unchanging laws of God.
But I looked again, I looked and saw Jesus my Substitute
scourged in my stead and dying on the Cross for me. I looked, I
cried, and I was forgiven.” Sir James Clark wrote thus “ I
believe I am justified in saying that if tried in the right way, the
religion of Jesus Christ never fails.” The Scripture Saints of
God are through the darkness stretching out hands of welcome
to each returning sinner. Listen to the beloved Apostle St. John,
“God is love,” “ and He is the propitiation for our sins and not
for our sins only, but for the sins of the whole world.” “ This ”
said the late celebrated Scottish Divine, Dr. Guthrie, “ throws a
halo of mercy round the world, perish the hand that would narrow
it a hairsbreadth.” Hear that great prophet Moses, “ yet now if
Thou wilt forgive their sin, and if not blot me I pray Thee out
of Thy book which Thou hast written,” a more than human
prayer. Here is the stamp of divinity written in golden letters,
at once attesting its Divine origin. Search the pages of Pagan
history and you can find no prayer, no wish therein, comparable
to this, uttered by him who “ spake face to face with God,” and
we might well hesitate to accept its far reaching depths. Did not
St. Paul interpret it for us when he exclaimed, “ I could wish
that myself were accursed from Christ for my brethren.” Mark
the last utterance of the martyr Stephen, full of righteous anger
indeed, yet underneath it all the love, “ Lord lay not this sin to
their charge.” Meditate upon the story of Jonah and the gourd,
and then far down the ages rings out above them all, the words
of Christ Himself (whose spirit alone it is they but breathed
forth), “ and I, if I be lifted up, will draw all men unto me.”
“ Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.” And
He in very truth and deed became a curse for our salvation.
True therefore to my own convictions, and knowing full well the
truth and reality of what I have written, I send forth these pages,
not in despair, but in hope, and bid you, whosoever you are, and
into whatsoever state of sin you may have sunk, and have become
dismayed thereat, to repent and believe, “ to trust and not be
afraid,” and then shall begin for you, if not as in my case, the


physical Miracle of Repair also, yet most assuredly spiritually
(which is infinitely more important at last) that which amidst all
the manifold changes and chances of this mortal life can alone
afford solid hope and lasting comfort and consolation, and which,
as the philosopher, Sir David Brewster, in his dying hour testified
to, can give perfect peace, as the last act in the drama of human
life is fulfilled, the voyage of the soul upon the great untried
ocean of Eternity,—
The Miracle of a New Birth.
