MINERAL STATISTICS OF VICTORIA
(Reprinted, for gratuitous distribution, from the ? Australian and New Zealand
Gazette? of Sept. 19, 1868, by J. Tennant, Mineralogist to Her Majesty,
Professor of Mineralogy and Geology, King?s College, &c,, 149, Strand, London.)
The mineral statistics of the colony of Victoria for the year 1867,
which confer great credit on the Executive department, contain some
very interesting information with respect to this important branch of
colonial enterprise. It is premised that ? whilst the old centres of popu-
lation are still prosperous the miners continue to explore, with scarcely
diminished energy, the more remote parts of the colony, many of which
are now the scenes of active industry. The gold fields now extend
westward from Stawell to the River Bendoc, on the eastern confines of
the colony, a distance of 350 miles, and from north to south nearly 180
miles. It is not easy to collect accurate information respecting the
proceedings of the miners over so large an area ; and but for the Zeal-
and activity of the several officers employed in the department, and the
prompt, courteous replies made to inquiries by mine-owners and others,
these tables could not have been compiled.?
The decrease in the number of miners employed which has been
observed from year to year since 1859, though not so large this year
as last, if we compare the mean numbers for the two years, is yet so
great as to occasion surprise. The mean number of miners employed
in 1866 was 73,577 and in 1867 it was 65,857, showing a decrease of
7,720. In none of the districts is there an increase in the number of
alluvial miners; and in the mining districts of Maryborough and Castle-
maine the decrease is very large. As regards Maryborough, this is
mainly due to the fact that large numbers of the Chinese miners have
left the central division and to a considerable reduction of the number
of European miners in the Dunolly division. In the central division
of the Castlemaine district there is a decrease of 620 in the number of
Chinese alluvial miners; and in the other large divisions the decrease
in the number of both Europeans and Chinese alluvial miners is con-
siderable. The operation of the 42nd section of the Amending Land
Act and the prosecution on an extensive scale of public works for the
supply of water to Geelong and the gold fields have had the effect of
withdrawing great numbers from mining pursuits. Those who have a
desire to acquire landed property and those who can apply only un-
skilled labour in mining operations are glad to have an opportunity of
leaving a somewhat uncertain but, in the main, profitable pursuit for
employments better suited to their tastes and capacities.
In 1866 there was a decrease in the number of quartz miners, as com-
pared with 1865, of 2,448, and it is a hopeful sign that this year it is
so much smaller, and that in the two districts ?Ballarat and Beech-
worth ?where the decrease was so remarkable in 1866, there is this
year in both a small increase. The following shows the total number
of miners employed on the gold fields from 1859 to 1867 inclusive :
1859, 125,764; 1860, 108,562; 1861, 100,463; 1862, 93,379: 1863,�
92,994 ; 1864, 84,986 ; 1865, 79,457 ; 1866, 70,794; 1867, 63,053. That
the total number of miners in 1867 should be little more than half of
the number for 1859 is, at the first view, somewhat perplexing and


seemingly irreconcilable with that appearance of prosperity which is
observable in nearly every part of the colony ; yet, when taken in con-
nection with other statistics ?those relating to roads, public works,
municipalities, agriculture, and stock, ?it is even more surprising that
so much should have been done for the permanent improvement of the
towns, in the construction of railways and roads, and in reclaiming
waste lands, and that still more than GO,OOO persons among a popula-
tion of 660,000 should continue to give all their labour to the work of
searching for gold.
On the 31st December, 1867, there were 15,629 Chinese miners
engaged in alluvial mining and 47 in quartz mining, making a total of
15,676. Having regard to the extent of the auriferous areas, they are
not very unequally distributed throughout the mining districts, except
as regards Gipps? Land, where there are only 640 enumerated. It is
probable, however, that in this district a good many not included in the
registrars? returns are employed near the boundary line between Vic-
toria and New South Wales. Last year the number was 20,134,
showing a decrease of 4,458. Several causes have operated to reduce
the number of those employed in mining. A great many have found
employment in New Zealand, not a few have returned to China, and
large numbers have found it profitable to devote their labours to gar-
dening in places where there is a ready market for their produce. It
is, perhaps, not more difficult now than formerly for them to get good
profits by re-working abandoned auriferous ground ; and enjoying in
every respect the same privileges as Europeans, it is somewhat remark-
able that the numbers continue to decrease.
The following is a statement of the average earnings per man per
annum for the past eight years, without distinction of classes :
1860 �79 9 3
1861 74 15 n
1862 67 17 10
1863 70 9 2
1864 74 i 9
1865 74 4 2
1866 80 8 3
1867 87 1 7
The mean for the eight years is 76/. Is. nearly. The average earnings
per man of the alluvial miners and quartz miners severally in 1867 was
?alluvial miners, 67/. 10s. l�d. ; quartz miners, 158/. 11s. B| d. These
calculations must not be accepted as absolutely correct, though every
endeavour has been made to get accurate data. With respect to the
earnings of the quartz miners the difficulty is not so great, because
there is some check on the estimated quantity of gold got in the quan-
tities of gold actually obtained from certain parcels of quartz crushed.
The average earnings of the quartz miner would amount to 141/. Is.
s\d. from the data so obtained, but it is well known that it is at pre-
sent impossible to get returns from all the mills. It is satisfactory to
note that in whatever way the matter is tested this fact is indisputable,
that both from the alluvial mines and the quartz veins the average re-
turns per man per annum are higher this year than they have been at
. time during the past eight years.
The number of engines employed remains nearly as it was last year
(1866) ; but many small additions to apparatus, which it is not possible
to comprise in a return, have been made in several of the larger esta-
blishments, and with good results.
The number of steam engines employed and the stamp-heads for
reducing vein-stuff for the past four years are as follow


Alluvial. Quartz.
Year. No. No. No. of Stamp-heads.
1864 ... 441 447 ... 4,575
1865 ... 473 491 ... 5,119
1866 ... 480 510 ... 5,437
1867 ... 470 532 ... 5,529
There is a slight decrease in the power employed in alluvial mining,
but in quartz mining the increase is marked and satisfactory. Ac-
cording to the returns made by the mining registrars and surveyors,
there are 2,381 auriferous quartz reefs already opened and 868|
square miles of auriferous ground which have been worked more or
less.
The total area of land held as ? claims? under the bye-laws of the
Mining Boards was, on the 31st December, 1867, as follows :

Excluding the land protected by certificates (which may or may not
be worked hereafter), there were, therefore, only 73,918 a, 1 r. 35 p.
actually held hand Jide for mining purposes on the 31st December by
03,053 miners, giving an average per man of la.or. 27 p. The
number of leases in force on the 31st December, 1867, was 1,047;
area, 11,846 acres. The total amount of capital proposed to be em-
ployed in working these areas was 3,194,281/. The revenue derived
from the gold fields from 1851 to 1867 inclusive is 5,179,445?. os. 9 d.
The revenue derived during 1867 from lands held by virtue of miners?
rights, under the bye-laws of the mining boards, was 11,507/. 18s. 9 d.,
and, taking the mean total area so held for the past year, the miners
have paid at the rate of 3s. 0-47*7. per acre; and, under the leasing
system, the amount actually paid per acre is 15s. 4 d. The estimated
value of the ? claims? in all the districts of the colony is 7,461,212/.
948,850 12-20ths tons of quartz were crushed during the year 1867,
which yielded 498,077 ozs. of gold, or an average of 10 dwts. 12-2 grs.
per ton.
An interesting question engaging a large share of public attention
is the extraction of gold from auriferous pyrites. In the Creswick
division 165 tons of pyrites yielded 751 ozs. 8 dwts. of gold, or an ave-
rage of 4 ozs. 11 dwts. I*B9 grs. per ton. In the Crooked River sub-
division two tons gave 94 ozs. 14 dwts., or at the rate of 47 ozs. 7 dwts.
per ton. From the Blackwood division a number of samples have
been sent to Melbourne, and the yield is said to be from 17/. to 32/.
per ton. The average return of gold is, therefore, about three ounces
per ton, and the cost of extracting the gold 3/. per ton, or 1/. per
ounce.
The length of water races is 2,300 miles 24 chains. These are used
exclusively for mining purposes,, and have cost, according to the infor-
mation furnished by the registrars, 321,903/., or at the rate of 139/.
185. B d. per mile. On the 31st December, 1867, there were 126 water-
right licenses in force. The areas occupied amount in the aggregate to
1,194 a. 2r. 23 p., the total length of the
chains, and the maximum quantity of water to be diverted per diem is


131,990,000 gallons. The aggregate area of the reservoirs under
license is 303 a. 2 r. 17 p., and the total capacity of the same 232,102,092
gallons. The capital invested, or proposed to be invested, in these
works is 138,257/. and the annual rent paid is 989/. 10s.
The mining companies registered in the several courts of mines dur-
ing the past year amounted to 160, the number of shares 491,801, and
the nominal capital 1,234,096/. 10s. The number of companies wound
up during the year was 12, the number of shares comprised in them
was 16,680, and the nominal capital was 131,600/.
The following is the account of the metals and minerals other than
gold obtained during the year :
Silver?Only 178 tons of ores were raised at St. Arnaud and but 78 ozs.
12 dwta. of silver smelted ; but a large quantity of the gold got was mixed
with silver, and it is not known how much was parted in Victoria. The
customs returns show that 366 ozs. 2 dwts. of silver were exported.
Tin?There were 177 tons 10 cwts. of black sand (mostly oxyde of tin) and
4,256 lbs. of tin exported during the year.
Copper??About 230 tons of ores have been raised and 3 cwts. of copper
exported.
Antimony?There were 272 tons of sulphide of antimony raised and 508
tons 7 cwts. exported. This last includes ores which were raised but not sent
forward for export during 1866.
Coal and Lignites?Only a few samples were raised.
Flags and Slates?There were 1,560 square yards of hearth stones, 2,000
square-yards of coreing, 6,440 square yards of paving, and 431 tons cwts.
of flags raised during the year. The quarries containing roofing slates were
not worked.
The following is an estimate of the value of the metals and minerals raised
in the colony from the first discovery of the gold fields to the 31st December,
1867
Gold, 33,910,052f ozs �135,643,811

The quantity of gold exported during 1867 was 1,433,687 ozs., of
which 560,527 ozs. were obtained from quartz veins and 873,160 ozs.
from alluvial workings.
