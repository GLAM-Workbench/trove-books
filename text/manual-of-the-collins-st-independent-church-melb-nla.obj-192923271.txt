Membership.
The Church is prepared to welcome as candidates for membership
children who give evidence of fitness, on the understanding that they
do not vote as members until they have attained the age of 21.
Church Finance.
The expenses of public worship and the many forms of Christian
enterprise are met partly by the voluntary contributions of the people,
collected at the services in the Church each Sunday. The principle
of “weekly offerings” is scriptural and sound. The simple scriptural
principles are:—
Each one laying by in store as God has prospered him.
Each one out of such store giving cheerfully and with ready mind.
Each one on the first day of the week bringing an offering as an act
of thankfulness, dedication and worship.
Each one according to his ability, not according to anyone else’s
standard, or the space at Church placed at his disposal.
Each one as to the Lord, and not to men.
“He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly, and he which
soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.” Every worshipper,
old and young, may share in this.
Pew Accommodation.
Forms of application for sittings can be obtained from the deacons,
or from any of the stewards in attendance at the doors.
The Church has from its inception adopted the system of voluntary
weekly offerings, instead of seat rents for the maintenance of public
worship, each worshipper contributing as an act of thankfulness and
consecration.
On application to any of the deacons, envelopes may be obtained
in which members of the congregation can enclose their usual
offerings.


Pastor’s Address.
To the Church and Congregation.
My Dear Friends,
The Pastor’s address this year must take an exceptional
form. Instead of the usual communication between the Pastor
and the Church it must partake of the character of a farewell, for
before these words are perused by you I shall have ceased to be
your Minister and only bear to you the relation of an honorary
character which you have kindly given to me as Pastor emeritus
and which I greatly value.
It would be useless to attempt a review of the more than twenty-
three years in which I have been permitted to minister to you.
How many of those who welcomed me on my arrival from England
have passed away! How numerous the changes which the years
have brought! But through them all in spite of every vicissitude
and variety of experience we can say truly, ‘ ‘ Goodness and mercy
have followed us,” and the good hand of the Lord has been with us.
Let me then record my thankfulness to the Giver of every mercy
and to the graciousness of the Head of the Church, which has been
ceaseless and overflowing.
At the same time I would add my expression of gratitude to
yourselves for numberless kindnesses shown me, for the co-
operation of the faithful, and'the patience which has borne with so
much wherein I feel that I have failed and come short. Let me
add also my appreciation of the kindly farewell accorded to me and
the generous acknowledgment of the services which I have been
enabled to render to you during a lengthened pastorate.
As I cannot review the past, I feel it would be impertinent to
add even a word of forecast and prevision. All that I can do is to
express my trust that God will lead the Church in all its future. I
pray that you may have wisdom, an ever renewed consecration to


the great work which lies before you, and that the Divine blessing
may ever rest upon a portion of the Church of Christ, which will
ever have in my heart a most sacred place of affection, and with
which some of the best memories of my life are connected.
I am quite convinced that the step I have taken is of God’s
ordering. It is well for you, it is well for myself, and I trust that
it will give to me a new opportunity of even higher value than the
regular pastorate, and to yourselves an obligation of carrying on
the work to which you are called still more devotedly, and of
extending that first service which you can render to your city and
the Kingdom of God.
Again thanking you for the happy past which you have enabled
me to enjoy, and commending you ever to the care and love of our
Lord and Saviour.
I remain,
Your affectionate friend
LLEWELYN D. BE VAN,
Pastor emeritus.


Deacons’ Report.
IN presenting their Annual Report with respect to the Church and
its various organisations, the Deacons have, in the first place, to
record the recent retirement of the Rev. Dr. Bevan from the
pastorate of the Church. Early in December, 1909, Dr. Bevan
verbally informed the Deacons and the Church that he had received
an invitation to become Principal of the Congregational College, at
Adelaide, connected with the Parkin Trust. At the Church
meeting held on 15th December, Dr. Sevan’s formal resignation
was submitted to the Church, and after full discussion, the
following resolution was carried: —
‘That whereas the Rev. Dr. Bevan, having received a cordial
and unanimous invitation to become the Principal of the
Adelaide Congregational College, and having intimated
his intention of accepting that position, has tendered his
resignation of the pastorate of the Collins Street Indepen-
dent Church, the Church regretfully resolves to accept the
resignation in the sincere conviction that the honourable
and influential position which Dr. Bevan has accepted
will offer a congenial sphere for the exercise of his
exceptional qualities of heart and mind, and will, under
the blessing of God. prove of inestimable value to the
Churches of the Congregational Order in the sister State.
The Church further resolves to place on record its warm
and grateful appreciation of the eminent services rendered
by Dr. Bevan, during a pastorate extending over twenty-
three (23) years, not only to the Church, but in the
Councils and the Institutional Work of the denomination,
and in the public life of the community.”
At a subsequent meeting, it was decided to ask Dr. Bevan to
accept the title of ‘‘Pastor emeritus ,” in recognition of his long
and honoured service to the Church. It was likewise resolved—
(a) To transfer to him the life insurance policy, which was
taken out by the Church at the commencement of his
ministry ;
(b) To continue his stipend until the end of April; and
(c) To subscribe £2OO to a testimonial to be raised by voluntary
contribution.
Particulars as to the subscriptions to the testimonial, which
amounted in all to more than £5OO, will he found on another page.
A farewell meeting was held in the Church on 15th February,
1910, when there was a large and representative gathering of


friends desirous of showing their regard for Dr. Bovan and their
high estimation of the services rendered by him to the Church and
to the Denomination.
During the period which must necessarily elapse before a new
Pastor settles amongst us, the Deacons earnestly appeal to the
members of the Church and congregation to maintain as far as
possible, regular attendance on the ordinances of public worship.
It has been very encouraging to find that our membership roll
has been added to during the year, notwithstanding that we have
lost a few by transfer. On the present roll there appears to be
about 250 members, but, judging by attendances at the com-
munion and Church meetings, interest has either been waning
or members are unable to attend. Many give as their address
places in the country or out of the State, and the question of a
revision of the roll, so as to include only those who can attend in
conformity with the rules of the Church, may be desirable in the
near future.
We ask your serious consideration of the finances of the Church.
A sub-committee of the Deacons in the early part of the year re-
ported that the probable revenue for this year would be some £6OO
less than the income, and this has been borne out by the results;
but as the full cost of the New Hall, £3870, has now been met, the
last instalment of £6OO having been paid in 1909, it was considered
that for 1910 the income would equal the expenditure, and may
possibly be about £lOO in excess, provided that the expenditure be
on the same lines as before. To do this it will be necessary that the
voluntary contributions shall be maintained. These have shown a
falling off for several years until for 1909 they only reached £602.
Should they fall any lower it will be impossible for us to maintain
the work of the Church and at the same time reduce the overdraft
at the bank. We therefore appeal to all members of the Church
and congregation to maintain their present contributions, and if
any are not giving regularly to apply to the Church Treasurer for
the necessary envelopes.
We have to thank the Ladies’ Committee for the good work
done in collecting donations, &c., for the various Missions of the
Church, and to the individual members who have subscribed
towards these Missions and the Sunday Schools.
The friends of the Collins Street Sunday School will observe
with regret that for the first time for many years its receipts were
not sufficient to meet the necessary expenditure.
With regard to the conduct of our Missions, the services of the
Rev. Jesse Mayo wore obtained for Queensberry Street for a short
time, and as regards Boundary Road, the period for which Mr.
Mahaffy was engaged having expired, he was re-appointed by the
Church, as Missionary until otherwise determined, and as Superin-
tendent of Boundary Road Mission until the end of the current
year. A most interesting report from that Mission will be found
in another part of the Manual.


The report of the Latrobe Street Mission shows under what
disadvantageous conditions its work is carried on through lack of a
proper building. A piece of land has for some time been generously
offered, on which to'erect a suitable hall, but the treasurer of the
Building Fund, Mr. Jas. Mcßean, has only the sum of about £3OO
in hand. In the hope that an early start with the building could
he made, Dr. Bevan and Mr. Mcßean were asked to obtain
subscriptions. Plans were also obtained for the new mission hall,
but up to the present, nothing further has been done with them.
This fund was started in 1906 by an allocation of the balance of the
Twentieth Century Fund, viz., £‘2B 13s. lid., added to in 1907 by
£9 Is. 3d. by Russell and Lockyeare bequests, augmented in 1908
by Russell and Earle bequests to the extent of £ll4 Is. 3d., and
for this year, a further sum of £45 from the Russell bequest. The
sum of £l9 2s. 6d. was also obtained through entertainments, and
subscriptions, as a result of the appeal previously referred to,
amount to £B3 19s. As a result of the bazaar held in December
last, towards this Building Fund and the Medhurst College,
Shanghai, one half of the proceeds, amounting to £5B ss. 7d., will
also be added to the fund, making a total of £359 3s. 6d.
One of our number, Mr. T. H. Thwaites, having completed
sixty-eight years of loyal and faithful service in the Church,
received the hearty congratulations of the Church and his brother
Deacons.
Six Deacons having retired through effluxion of time, five of
them were re-elected, viz., Messrs. Andrews, Barker, 11. Norman,
Pitts, and P. Tait, and the vacancy, caused by Mr. Mcßean having
been made an elder, was filled up by the election of Mr. W.
Warren Kerr.
The various statements of accounts are herewith appended.

Choir Report.
Organist and Choirmaster— Mr. George Peake; Secretary and
Treasurer —Mr. T. L. Scarborough , Members — SOPBANI —
Madame McClelland, Miss Wing, Mrs. Battley, Misses Scott,
McNabb, McGill, Dowdell, Wilde, Davey, Christiansen,
Reynolds; ALTl—Miss C. John, Mrs. Scarborough, Misses
Ada Clarke, Fitzgerald, Scott, Semple, TENORI —Messrs.
Floyd, Trathen, Waite, Cahill, Patterson; BASSl—Messrs.
T. E. Jones, T. L. Scarborough, F. 0. Battley, Pilgrim,
Carnegie, and Clarke (on leave).
IT is gratifying to state that the engagement of leaders has been
amply justified, although we regret to state that Madame
McClelland had to obtain leave of absence for six months and
Miss John was laid aside by serious illness for nearly the same
period.
The Saturday half-holiday has compelled us to change. our
rehearsal from Friday to Thursday. As people still go out on
Saturday evenings, and must do their shopping on Friday nights,
it follows that members of the choir have to be out four consecu-
tive nights of the week, and the choir attendance suffers seemingly
in consequence.
We hope the Church will be able to make the necessary altera-
tions in the choir and to the organ console, so that the organ
may be brought up to date, worthy of the Church and Denomina-
tion.

Delegates from Y.W.B.C. —Misses Norman and Pope.
The year 1909 has passed without producing much which calls for
comment. It commenced with 102 scholars on the roll and ter-
minated with 103. There was a s ight falling off amongst the
younger boys which was compensated for by the young men who
have joined the Institute. The average attendance has been 59 per
Sunday. The number of teacher's and officers is 16 with an average
attendance of 14 per Sunday.
Fourteen scholars and twelve teachers are members of the
Church.
The staff of teachers has been increased by the election of Mrs.
Boultbee, Miss Cooke and Mr. A. O. V. Tymms. As there seemed to
be a demand for a Women’s Bible Class, separate from the Young
Women’s Bible Class already existing, Mrs. Boultbee undertook to
lead it and did so with some success for a time, but at present it is in
abeyance, owing to her absence from Melbourne for the summer
months.
We regret having to record the resignation of Miss Davidson, who
left us in view of her approaching marriage, and of Miss Bevan,
owing to the removal of her parents to Adelaide. To both these
ladies we tender hearty thanks for their help in carrying on the
work here, and especially to Miss Bevan for her very valuable
assistance in connection with the musical department of our services.
The Men’s Institute, mentioned above, was the outcome of
an effort made early in the year to gather in a greater number of
young men than were then attending our school. It was hoped that
by giving them more latitude on Sunday afternoons than is possible
with the ordinary lesson scheme, and by providing games and
recreations on week nights, a considerable addition to our numbers
could be obtained and that much influence for good could be
exercised over them. Messrs. Eady and Burgess were appointed to
be leaders of it, and the measure of success they have achieved may
be judged from their separate report which is appended, as is also
that of our Young Ladies’ Bible Class.


The 70th Anniversary of our school was celebrated on Sunday,
25th April, 1909, when Rev. G. A. W. Legge preached in the morning,
and Rev. Dr. Bevan in the evening. Revs. J. Mayo and Willett
Bevan addressed the scholars and their friends in the'schoolroom in
the afternoon. At each service hymns selected from E. W. S.
Watson’s sth set were used and appeared to give much pleasure to
the congregations which gathered to worship with us.
The Annual Tea Meeting was held on Tuesday, 27th April in the
hall. Afterwards Rev. Dr. Bevan presided at our Annual Meeting in
the Church, when songs and recitations were performed by the
scholars, and Mr. W. F. Greenwood gave an address. The prizes
gained during the year were distributed by Mrs. W. Bevan, whom we
were very pleased to welcome amongst us once more. Her presence
with us recalled many pleasant memories of the time when she and
Mr. W. Bevan were associated with us in the work here. There was
also a display of bioscope pictures, some of which created much
amusement.
The Annual Picnic was held on 15th November, at Tooronga.
The scholars travelled by vans to the ground, and as the day was
fine, the outing proved a very enjoyable one. The prizes gained in
the sports were distributed on 29th November, at an entertainment
in the hall, when a programme of songs, recitations, and conjuring
was provided by the scholars. The hearty thanks of teachers and
scholars are given to the friends who by their gifts and assistance
gave us this opportunity of enjoyment.
The international lesson scheme for the year comprised the study
of the Acts of the Apostles, and the quarterly examinations have
shown that a good knowledge of this portion of God’s Word has been
gained by the scholars. The Free Church Catechism has also been
taught regularly as usual. One scholar, Edward Waite, passed in the
junior division of the Sunday School Union Annual Examination.
We have now 30 members of the International Bible Reading Union.
Near the end of the year it was thought that an effort should be
made to increase our numbers. A leaflet was prepared with photo-
graphs of the outside and inside of our hall, and with details of the
scope of our work, and the attractions we can offer to scholars.
With this an energetic canvass of the neighbourhood has been made,
but very little resulted from it. The juvenile population around us
does not appear to be a very large one, and the enquiries made seem
to show that most of the children are attending one or other of the
Sunday Schools in the neighbourhood.
It was with much regret that the school heard of Rev. Dr.
Bevan’s decision to resign his pastorate here. In his long connection
with us he has always shown his deep interest in the work, and his
willingness to do all in his power to help it forward. We shall
greatly miss him in every branch of the school work, and especially
the happy little addresses he gave us so regularly on the first Sunday
in each month. Our prayer is that he may be spared in health and
happiness for a continued career of usefulness, and that God’s
blessing may be with him in his new undertaking.


The Social Activities connected with us—the cricket, football, and
tennis clubs, and the calisthenic class, have prospered during the
year, and have proved sources of helpfulness to our work.
The Infant Class has been made much more attractive by the
introduction of kindergarten chairs instead of the old uncomfortable
gallery.
The Library has continued to be used by a considerable number
of readers, although very few new books have been added during the
year.
The weekly collections amounted to £lB Os. 2d., which is divided
between the London Missionary Society and the Home Mission of
Victoria. The New Year offering for the maintenance of the L.M.S.
ships obtained £5 11s. Ten collectors received the Society’s reward
book “The Martyr Isle.” The Hospital Sunday collection was
£2 15s. 9d., making a total of £24 6s. lid. collected for missionary
and charitable purposes.
The financial statement is appended. It will be observed that it
shows us to be in debt for the first time for many years.

The work of the class has been carried on successfully during the
past year under the leadership of Mrs. Hamer. There have been a
few changes, some having felt obliged through various reasons to
resign, while others have been gladly welcomed back to the class.
The S.S.U. International Lessons were the subjects of study, and
several of the members have helped in the work of the class by their
efforts in giving essays on one or niore of these lessons.
We regret that owing to the long illness and subsequent death
of her mother, Miss Maud Davy has been obliged to resign her
position as treasurer of the class, which office she has held for seven
years. The class deeply sympathise with her in her loss and trust
that God’s blessing may rest upon her in her sorrow.

Dr. Bevan has kindly continued to conduct the class on the first
Sunday of each month. We take this opportunity of thanking the
Doctor for the many helpful and interesting lessons that have been
given, and of expressing our regret that we Shall not have this
opportunity in the future.
The class has continued to support the orphan, Suker Yarnum, in
the Lois Cox Home, Salem, towards which the sum of £2 10s. was
subscribed.
During Mrs. Hamer’s absence in August, the class was conducted
by Mr. Tait, senr., Mr. W. W. Kerr, and Mr. H. Norman, to whom
the thanks of the class are due.
The Annual Social was held on 30th September. There was a
very good attendance, and the efforts of the members and friends,
who prepared an excellent programme, were amply repaid by the
evident pleasure of those present. The object of the social is to try
and get friends interested in the work and to endeavour to gather in
new members.
Our best thanks are due to Mrs. Hamer for her unselfish and
loving interest in each member of the class, and for the thorough
manner in which she is always willing to enlighten us on the
subjects under consideration.
We meet every Sunday afternoon in the Drawing-room, at 3.15.
and shall be very glad to welcome any young women who will join us,

During January, 1909, the Institute was formed with the idea of
bringing young men, from the age of 16, together on the Sunday
afternoons and certain evenings during the week.


The membership at commencement was about nine, and has now
increased to 25 members. The Deacons of the Church placed the
Young Men’s room at the Institute’s disposal, as the meeting place
on Sunday afternoons and week nights.
The government of the Institute rests with a committee consisting
of seven members, inclusive of the secretary and treasurer. The
committee is elected every six months.
At the Sunday afternoon meetings the International Bible
Lessons are considered. There is also an address given by one of
the leaders or a visitor. The aim of the addresses is to help to build
up young men’s characters.
The meetings held during the week are usually for the purpose of
some social gathering and games. During the winter months some
very enjoyable evenings were spent.
There are also cricket and football clubs in connection with the
Institute.
In order to extend the operations of the Institute, we are anxious
to increase our membership and cordially invite young men to join.

This year, the third since our formation, has proved highly success-
ful in point of membership and in the number of matches to
the credit of the club. The club entered the Congregational
Churches Cricket Association, and is now in a very strong position
and members are very confident of obtaining the premiership of the
season. The players, in working harmoniously together and showing a
true sporting spirit, have given our popular captain, Mr. L. Mitchell,
very little cause for anxiety. We acknowledge the good work done


by Mr. R. Robertson with the bat and by Messrs. C. Roberts and R.
Andrews with the ball. We would extend our grateful thanks to Mr.
Eady for his practical assistance and for the generosity of the deacons
and other Church members.
Calisthenic Classes.
During the winter months Calisthenic Classes were held for the
boys. The attendances were not as satisfactory as expected, mainly
owing to there not being any additions to the existing apparatus.
The only materials available were clubs, dumb-bells, and a vaulting
horse. These have now been used for three seasons and considera-
tion must be given to installing more gymnastic apparatus before
next season.
Taking all through, however, the 1909 season was appreciated by
the regular attendants, and many useful evenings were spent.

The Tennis Club has to report a successful year for 1909. Except
for a few weeks during the winter season the court has been in regular
use throughout the year, and has well tilled its purpose of providing
pleasant recreation and social meetings for the young people con-
nected with the Church.
During the year, a Gentlemen’s Singles and Mixed Doubles
tournaments were held, the various contests were keenly and closely
fought out, and helped materially to improve the standard of play.

Good work has been accomplished this year, the debates being
vigorous and interesting, but it is to be regretted that the meetings
were not well sustained towards the close of the latter session. If
the Society is to maintain its vitality, the individual members must
be more regular in attendance, and take a keener interest in its
welfare.
An effort has been made this year to improve the literary side of
the Society’s work, the various papers on Burns, Dickens, Carlyle,
and Shakespeare reflecting great credit on the members who took
part.

Meetings have been held regularly twice a month, and in November
each week the members were busily working for the bazaar to help
the Latrobe Street Mission and the Medhurst College, Shanghai.
There have been about 10(i articles made and given to the missions
connected with the Church, as also to other deserving cases known to
be in need.
It is regretted that several of our members were absent through
illness during part of the year, and it is hoped that they will be
in their usual places when next the party meets.
All friends are thanked, who at different times have helped in
various ways.
A cordial invitation is given to members of the Church and
congregation to join and help in the useful and practical work of the
working party.

Secretary —Mrs. F. A. Smalley.
The meetings during the past year have been held at the Pastor’s
residence, and have been fairly well attended. A large number of
garments has been distributed to those requiring help.
The meetings will be resumed shortly, on the second Friday in
every month, and a cordial invitation is given to all ladies of the
Church to join and assist in carrying on this good work. These
meetings also afford better opportunities for social intercourse and
becoming acquainted with members of the congregation than the
more formal and public meetings of the Church.

Abbott; Treasurer —Miss Kendall; Secretary and Librarian —Dr.
E. M. P. Stone.
The subjects for special reading by the members of the Society
during 1909, have been five great writers, viz.—Tennyson, for the
first quarter; Robert and E. B. Browning, for the second; Carlyle
for the third; and Dickens for the last. These authors and their
writings have formed the subject for essays at the quarterly meetings,
and selections from their works have been read at three of the
Monthly meetings. Part of “Friendship,” a sacred drama, written
by a friend of some of the members, was read at the November
Meeting.


Dr. Bevan has been good enough to continue his Shakespeare
lectures this year. The subjects have been: —1, “ Some of Shakes-
peare’s Women”; 2, “His Poems,” and 3, “Pericles, Prince of
Tyre.” The members of the Society highly appreciate these lectures,
and feel very grateful to Dr. Bevan for continuing to give them. The
thanks of the Society are also due to Dr. Springthorpe for acting as
chairman on these occasions.
The Society has been glad to welcome seven new members, but
has, unfortunately, to chronicle that five ladies have resigned.
Having a balance in hand of over £1 to begin the year, a donation
of £1 Is. was voted to the funds of the Victorian Neglected Children’s
Aid Society, the need for help experienced by this Society being very
great.
During the year there have been two changes in the Delegates to
the National Council of Women of Victoria. As Mrs. Hicks was
leaving for Western Australia she resigned, and Mrs. Andrews was
appointed in her place. Mrs. Andrews having since resigned, Miss
Kendall and the Hon. Secretary are now the delegates.
The Committee appointed to prepare next year’s syllabus, and
help to get it carried out, are Mrs. Stone, the Misses McMillan,
Gosman, and Barker. The members of the Committee who acted in
this capacity during 1908 were Mesdames Barker, Brownell and
Hicks, and Miss Sims.

The work of the Mission has been regularly maintained throughout
the year, and the attendances have been good in nearly all respects,
with the exception of the Sunday and Tuesday evening services,
which are not by any means as well attended as they should be.
Could we secure the attendance at these services of all, or even the
most, of those who receive the advantages of the Social and other
classes meeting during the week, our hall would not be large enough


to hold them; and it has become a matter for serious consideration
whether attendance at the religious services should not be made a
condition of membership in the various classes.
A special series of services, during a period of three months, was
conducted in the early part of the year by the Rev. Jesse Mayo, which
were much appreciated by the whole of the Mission folk ; Mr. Mayo’s
genial presence making his work of a very acceptable character. Some
four of our young men came out for Christ during the Mission, a
result gratifying alike to the Mission workers and to the parents and
friends of the young men, most of whom have grown up in the
Mission.
These services, conducted regularly by the same gentleman,
caused many of the Mission folk to express the wish that it could be
always thus, and to voice the hope that the day may not be far
distant when a resident missionary may be located amongst them,
going in and out among the people and linking their hearts to the
Mission and its work.
A new feature of work has been developed during the year, in the
establishment of a patrol of Boys’ Scouts, under the care of Scout
Master Mr. J. McLean, who has given a great deal of time and
energy to his work. Besides the regular evening meeting, the boys
have been taken out on many Saturdays for field and scouting
exercises. They have also been out to two camps for a day or two
at a time. Altogether the boys show a distinct appreciation of then-
duties and privileges as scouts, and wish to extend them if possible.
One desire they now have is to demonstrate in public, to a much
greater extent than now obtains, owing to not possessing all the
equipment of a patrol of Scouts. Mention may be made here of
them, so that any friends in the Church, who may be so minded,
may help us financially, to provide the equipment for them, viz.—a
flag or “Standard” to march under, a bugle, and a kettle-drum. It is
estimated these can be obtained at a cost of not exceeding £3. Suit-
able tents would also be of use for camp work, so there is ample
opportunity for the generosity of friends of the Mission.
Excellent success has attended the efforts of the Boys’ Club
Leaders, the attendances sometimes being almost more than the
available workers could adequately control, and opportunity is
certainly open for the assistance of friends who have a liking for
work among the boys.
The Girls’ Guild has done good work during the year, especially
in the latter portion, when Miss Stone kindly consented to become
their teacher in Calisthenic exercises. A successful session is
looked forward to this year; Miss Stone has consented to become
President, Miss Greig having intimated her inability to take up the
work this session. Miss Stone will be assisted as before by the
Misses S win born, Vance, and Pettit.
Mrs. Hamer’s Mothers’ Meeting on Wednesday afternoons, Mrs.
De Leon’s Women’s Class on Sunday afternoons, and Miss Menzies’
Men’s Class on Sunday afternoons, have been regularly maintained,
and are appreciated by those composing them.


A good word must be said of Miss Dickins’ efforts in connection
with our Young Men’s Bible Class. Her endeavour has been to focus
the result of the Boys’ Club in the formation of the Bible Class on
Sunday afternoons. Varying success has been met with, on some
afternoons the attendance being very good. Too much cannot be
said also, of the character of the addresses given to the young men,
which were of a very high order, from ministerial and lay gentlemen,
and we are very grateful to those gentlemen for their assistance in
helping to mould the character of these young men.
Our Annual Picnic was held this year at Glen Iris, this pleasant
resort being again visited after a series of years. There was a good
attendance of Mission folk, a good deal of hard work for the workers,
and plenty of enjoyment for the scholars and friends.
The average attendance at the Sunday School including the adult
classes, has been maintained at about the same as last year, viz., 75.
The Anniversary of the Mission was this year held in October, so
as to make the preparatory efforts concurrent with those for the
United Missions’ Anniversary, so that the serious interference with
the routine Sunday School work, usual in previous years in preparing
for the two separated Anniversaries, might be avoided. Three
services were held on Sunday the 17th, the Bev. Jesse Mayo taking
that of the morning, the Rev. Willett Bevan (who took the service for
Dr. Bevan) in the afternoon, and Mr. Russell Hurditch in the
evening. All the services were well attended and greatly appreciated.
The distribution of school prizes and entertainment took place
on the Tuesday following, and was presided over in the early part by
Dr. Bevan, and later by Mr. Russell Hurditch. A special and
pleasant feature of the meeting was an address from Mr. Spicer, of
London. Two gold medals, the gift of our late Secretary to the
Mission, Mr. C. E. Morrison, were also presented to their respective
winners in the Girls’ Guild.
One of Dr. Bevan’s last duties—and we are sure that to him it
was a satisfactory one—was to examine a number of new applicants
for admission as communicants. We desire by this means to link
these friends into closer association with us in our work, and to give
them a more active interest in the affairs of the Church and its
Missions, with which they are thus identified.
Much consideration has been given this year by the workers
of this and the sister Missions, to the drafting of a common basis of
work in connection with the various departments of the Missions, so
as, if possible, to secure better results from the religious standpoint
to the efforts put forth. After full consideration a “constitution,” or
basis of working was drafted, and is now receiving the attention of
the deacons with the view of being placed before the Church for
the consideration of the members.
Our staff of workers in the Mission will bear strengthening. We
are requiring a leader for the Men’s Club, and also some teachers for
the Sunday School. Mr. Jarman, who for so many years conducted
the singing with such excellent effect, early in the year intimated


that his official duties would prevent him continuing to assist as in
times past; this has been a great lack in our Mission work, as good
singing has been found at all times a great factor in drawing our
people together. We are, however, in hopes of an early change in
this direction, as Miss Cecilia John has now taken up the Singing
Class in connection with the Men’s Club, and we are in strong hopes
she will be able to extend her aid into the other spheres of our
Mission work, and one direction in which we hope to see this consum-
mated is in the formation of a Choral Society.

Queensberry Street Mothers’ Meeting.
President —Mrs. Hamer ; Secretary —Miss Barker.
THE average attendance at the meetings during this last year has
not been quite so high as usual, owing in most cases to sickness or
outside attractions.
Three of our number have passed away, one being Mrs. Carter,
one of the oldest members.
The Annual Tea was held on 18th November, when the
Young Women’s Bible Class again rendered their services in the
preparation of the tea and the arrangement of the evening pro-
gramme. Dr. and Mrs. Bevan were present, and addressed the
gathering. The entertainment, which consisted of musical items,
recitations, and a comedietta, was much appreciated.
The Christmas meeting was held on 22nd December, Dr. Bevan
presiding. Mrs. De Leon was present, and said a few words, and
songs and recitations were very kindly contributed by Miss McNabb,
Miss Twaddell, and Miss De Leon.
We take this opportunity of acknowledging, with thanks, parcels
received from Mesdames Barker, Evans, Hamer, Tait, and Messrs.
Hamer and Peterson, also from the Daughters of the Court, the
Young Ladies’ Sewing Meeting, as well as two anonymous parcels.
We again remind friends that such parcels of clothing, &c., are
much appreciated, and can be sent to the care of Mrs. Baker,
79 Barry Street, Carlton.

The work of the Mission still continues to maintain its efficiency,
despite the many drawbacks experienced. Owing to most unsuitable
quarters, great inconvenience exists in the overcrowded state of the
room with its bad atmosphere, which tends to repel, rather than draw
the people to its centre. Were it not for the devotion and love of the
people for the Mission, we fear the small comfort offered would not
be sufficient to invite them, though at times we seem to see in dim
vision the long promised new hall; but alas, up to the present, it
proves but a delusive mirage; yet withal, we have much to be
grateful for, in the Spirit of God, whose presence is manifested from
time to time, transforming the little room into a Holy Shrine. The
services on Sunday and Thursday evenings are well attended
and much appreciated, and have been maintained by Miss Menzies,
assisted also by the Superintendent.
We regret to report the loss of the valuable services rendered to
the Mission during the early part of the year by the Rev. S. Burrows,
who left to take the oversight of the Oxford Street Church. Upon
his leaving, the friends of the Mission presented him with a Bible to
mark their appreciation of his work among them. We also regret
the retirement of Mrs. and Miss Withers after so many years faithful
service in connection with the conduct of the Mothers’ Meetings, the
responsibility of which now falls upon our missionary, Miss Menzies.
The Band of Hope continues to thrive under the able direction of
its leader, Mr. P. Lane, whose devotion to the work is unfailing, and
claims the esteem of its members, which number some 80 boys and
girls.
The Girls’ Guild has still continued to manifest an interest in its
meetings from week to week, under the guidance of Miss Waite, who
has devoted the time in the menfal as well as physical training of its
members.
We look back with gratitude for all that has been done for us, the
help rendered by the parent Church, and by the Rev. Dr. Bevan,
the pleasure brought to the young people by the Christmas tea and
gifts by Mrs. Bevan and friends, and we look forward with hope into
the future; the harvest truly is great, and the labourers are few,
and we pray that there may be those willing to come and scatter
the good seed, and by-and-bye to gather in the sheaves with shouts
of rejoicing at the great Harvest Home.

Latrobe Street Women’s Meeting.
Leader —Miss Menzies.
During the year this meeting has sustained an irreparable loss in the
departure of Mrs. and Miss Withers from Victoria. Mrs. Withers
has been the leader of this meeting since its origin, and for several
years Miss Withers has ably assisted in the capacity of secretary and
pianiste, who also visited the homes in times of sickness and need.
It was a sad day we met to bid farewell to those so dearly loved, and
we emphasized our affection in the presentation of a leather hand-
bag and purse. By their unceasing devotion and untiring energy,
they won the hearts of the people for Christ and for themselves the
reflex blessing here, and the assurance of the Master’s “well done.”
The meetings have been carried on by Miss Menzies, with most
gratifying results, the membershtp roll of our mission being sub-
stantially strengthened by those who have entered the Kingdom
through the instrumentality of this meeting.
We are deeply grateful to the Collins Street Ladies’ Party and
others for their valuable assistance in providing garments for this
work, also Miss Decima Clarke, a junior member of “The Daughters
of the Court,” who has undertaken to assist in clothing one poor-
little girl in this mission; she is the 21st child of a poor mother,
who, during this year, has been led out of spiritual darkness into
the liberty of God’s children. At the closing meeting the little girl
was dressed in her first instalment of clothing, and was baptized
by Dr. Sevan, who also gave a helpful address to the mothers.
We are deeply grateful to Misses- Boyd and Lorna Wood, and Messrs.
Patterson and Anderson, for their musical assistance at the meeting.
Among the mothers, Mesdames Langor, McKenzie, and Butterley
have helped in providing tea and sugar for the weekly teas.

Lady Missioner’s Report.
In the work of visitation among our mission friends vve can raise our
“Ebenezer,” for truly the Lord hath done great things for us. The
Gospel has been carried weekly to those who never leave their little
domiciles, and in these hearts a real work of grace has been accom-
plished. Many dear mothers whose hearts were sad, and burdens
heavy, have been cheered and helped by a kindly word and practical
sympathy, many of whom have been won by His love into the
Kingdom. An individual knowledge is gained by constant visitation,
so that the deserving poor are helped to help themselves. Many
real empty cupboards have been supplied, shivering bodies clothed,
and bare feet shod in the Master’s name. Much has been done to
alleviate suffering and restore those who were convalescent to their
usual strength. Many spiritual meetings have been conducted in
connection with this part of the work, out of which there has been
an evident harvest of souls.
We have watched by the death-beds of some of the oldest
members of our mission until the portals opened and they had gone
to be forever with the Lord. Words are inadequate to express one’s
gratitude to those kind friends who, by their sympathy and generosity,
have made an otherwise almost impossible work easy and pleasant.

The Report of this Mission for 1909 must, of necessity, present some
encouraging aspects. The attendances at the public services have
improved, and numerous branches of work have been brought into


existence. These are all more or less healthy, and we have great
reason to thank Almighty God for the measure of prosperity He has
vouchsafed to us.
The year was strangely marked by the moving off to other spheres
of usefulness, and all within a few weeks, of such faithful workers as
Dr. Sybil Bevan, Miss Carroll, Messrs. S. Dickins and W. H.
Matthew, all of long service and most honorable record. At the
same time, newer workers in the person of Mr. J. J. Berry, who did
splendid service as choirmaster for twelve months, and Misses Tribe,
Skinner, Taylor, and Mace, also dropped out, thus leaving the
Mission with but three workers—Misses Venman, Wickham, and
Christiansen, tried and true pillars of our edifice. Equally remark-
able with this depletion, was the almost immediate incoming of a
little swarm of workers. These were Misses Soutter, Flatt, Wilson,
Mahaffy (3), M. Blackburn, Heywood, Neal, Jones, Hillman, Outhred,
and Crouch, Messrs. Coventon, Carter, Gent, Weir, and Penn.
The Sunday School has increased in efficiency, thanks to the
“Six Grade System of Sunday School Instruction,” which is leading
slowly up to a richer mental and spiritual equipment of the pupils.
The discipline has so improved as to leave little more to wish for.
The teachers have all shown great interest in the work of the
School, and their labours are beyond praise.
The various classes and societies have done well, notably the
Choral Society under Miss Myra Christiansen’s particularly skilled
lead.
The Men’s Social Institute has been a fortress of strength in its
capacity as a feeder to the societies. Its published balance-sheet
shows a sum of £33 raised for educative, social, and benevolent
objects.
The method of financing the General Fund is in the course of
being changed for a better one. The Annual Picnic, for example,
was paid for by a local effort, and left £1 Is. 2d. on hand. The
previous year there was a loss.of £l3 2s. Gd. In future all extra
expenses and improvements will be defrayed by local effort, leaving
but contingent expenses to be paid by the parent Church, that at
least is our goal. Our people are taking, with considerable readiness,
to the new principle of self help.
The Social Institute have decided to present a magic lantern to
the Mission, and before this report appears, the instrument will be in
use at the public services.
The year was rich in special events, and the right standard was
well maintained with regard to conduct, order, aim, and results.
The people are warmly appreciative of the goodness of the
Deacons to them, and the solicitude of that body for the well-being
and advancement of the Mission. The workers are especially grate-
ful for the kindly encouragement and help so freely given to them.
They intend to show their appreciation by more faithful and abun-
dant service in the cause of our Redeemer and Lord.


The pulpit supplies have been highly efficient and inspiring to the
people, and grateful thanks are here offered to those gentlemen, who
have regularly supplied for us. The chief of these are Eev. 0. T.
Evans, Messrs. C. N. Willis, T. W. McDonough, Geo. Brown, and
F. W. Clarey.
The outlook at the Mission is
hopeful.

Boundary Road Women’s Meeting.
Leader —Miss Menzies.
We report in connection with this meeting a very satisfactory year’s
work. The membership has greatly increased. Several of our
mothers during the year have enlisted under the banner of Love, and
the deep interest evinced in the weekly Bible study is a sure sign of
the deepening of their spiritual life.
We record with regret the death of Mrs. Williams, the oldest
member of our mission, who left us to join the angel band, and be
for ever with her Lord. We also regret the loss of a noble, self-
sacrificing worker in the departure of Mrs. Fletcher (our secretary)
from the mission. The presentation of a beautiful silver toilet set to
her from the mothers, was an evidence of their love and esteem.
Quarterly meetings have been held in conjunction with our
Wednesday Evening Bible Classes, which have proved helpful. Rev.
H. Joyce and Mr. Bush kindly assisted in making these meetings a
spiritual uplift. Our thanks are also due to the members of the
Queensberry Street Sunday Afternoon Bible Class, who assisted in
providing the programme.


The fine meetings during the year reached their zenith in the
closing meeting, when inspiriting addresses were given by Revs. Dr.
Sevan, H. Joyce, S. Burrows, and Mrs. Davies. Mr. Mahaffy moved
a resolution, which was unanimously carried, expressing the meeting’s
deep love for their pastor, and regret at his approaching departure.
Sacred songs were ably rendered by Mrs. Valentine, Miss Kerr, and
Mr. Anderson. During the meeting a lovely silver-mounted umbrella,
and several minor gifts were presented to Miss Menzies.
We are deeply grateful to the friends who have assisted in any
way in making these meetings a success, especially to the Collins
Street Ladies’ Party for their substantial assistance in providing
garments; to Mr. Peterson for a tin of tea; to Messrs. Griffiths Bros.,
a tin of tea, per Mrs. Fletcher.

Treat to the Mission Children.
The usual treat to the mission children was given by Dr. Bevan
in December. Fifty children came from Queensberry Street, 50
from Boundary Road, and 50 from Latrobe Street. The children
were very well behaved and fully enjoyed their tea, cake, and fruit.
The distribution of gifts was very successful. Mrs. Bevan had an
unusually large supply of dolls and toys, and not only did each child
receive a gift, but many were sent to children who had been pre-
vented coming by sickness or other causes. The children gave
several recitations and songs, and had a pleasant entertainment.
Mrs. Bevan begs to thank all the friends who gave help in money,
toys, work in dressing dolls, and the teachers and others who
accompanied the children, and is glad that the long series of treats
that Dr. Bevan has conducted for so many years had so successful a
final celebration.
The Watchers’ Band.
“ More things arc wrought by prayer than this world dreams of."
Strength lies not in spasmodic, but in quiet ceaseless effort. The
members of the Watchers’ Band bring in prayer before the Throne of
Grace each month the missionaries in China, India, Africa, and the
Islands, and in this quiet way endeavour to help on the evangelisation
of the world and the proclamation of the Gospel to those who are in
darkness. Our Band has lost members through removal to a distance,
but others have taken their place, and a cordial invitation is extended
to everyone to join this missionary prayer union.
The annual tea and after-meeting was held last year in May,
and both were well attended. Mrs. Williams (wife of the Rev. J. G.
Williams, who is co-agent of the L.M. S.) gave a bright stirring
address, and the roll call was well responded to.
The secretary was able to forward to the general secretary, Miss
Strongman, £1 ss. Bd. subscriptions from the 20 members for 1909.


The Missionary Chronicle.
The Chronicle of the London Missionary Society gives us the news of
the mission fields, letters from, or short articles by the missionaries,
with an account of their work, sometimes illustrated. The first part
is edited by the llev. J. King, and contains particulars of those who
have gone from our midst and whom most of us know personally.
We live in the rush of city life, doing our little work for our church,
while this great work is being done beyond. To us who live in
Australia, so far from the centre of the work, and can have few
chances of seeing and hearing the missionaries, the magazine is of
special value. The subscription to the Missionary Chronicle is 1/-
News from Afar, the children’s magazine, 6d. per annum.
The distributor, Miss Stone, will be pleased to receive names of
new subscribers.
The London Missionary Society.
Collins Street Independent Church Auxiliary.
President —Eev. Dr. Bevan ; Hon. Treasurer —Mr. John Iliffe ; Hon.
Secretary —Mr. J. N. Barker; Committee —Miss Lotherington,
Miss Wright, Mr. F. O. Battley and Mr. D. J. D. Bevan, together
with the Committee of the Ladies’ Auxiliary.
Three meetings of the Auxiliary were held during the year, the first
in the Hall, and the other two at the pastor’s residence. At the
meeting held in March the Rev. Willett Bevan was asked to deliver a
lecture on “China.” The lecture was given on 6th May, under the
presidency of the Chinese Consul. The attendance was large, in-
cluding over 400 Chinese, and the collection taken in aid of the funds
required for additional appliances and materials for Medhurst Col-
lege, Shanghai, amounted to more than £3l.
At the meeting held in June, addresses were given by Mrs. G. J.
Williams and Dr. Cowan, the former speaking of Hospital work at
Hong Kong, and the latter giving interesting details of his associa-
tion with Mr. Keith Falconer in his self-denying medical work near
Aden.
The speakers at the meeting in September were the Rev. Thos.
Lord, of Madagascar, and the Rev. Willett Bevan, of Shanghai, both
of whom, at the close of the meeting, answered questions relative to
the work in which they had been engaged.

Ladies’ Auxiliary London Missionary
Society.
President —Mrs. Bevan; Vice-Presidents —Mrs. Hamer, Mrs. Neild ;
Secretary and Treasurer —Mrs. Bennett; Committee and Collectors
—Mesdames Barker, Battley, Bennett, Bevan, Hamer, Hartnell,
Norman, Dr. Stone, Misses Eady, Lotherington, Thwaites, and
Yenman; Secretary Watchers' Band —Miss I). Stone.
The Society usually meets on the third Friday in March, June,
September and December.
The March meeting was held at our Pastor’s residence, East
Melbourne, at which Rev. Willett Bevan answered a number of
questions about his work at Medhurst College, Shanghai, thus giving
us a great deal of information about the aims and prospects of
bis students.
The June meeting was also held at Dr. Bevan’s residence. In
the absence of our Pastor, Rev. Joseph King occupied the chair, and
gave a very hearty welcome to Mrs. Williams, Rev. Willett and Mrs.
Bevan, also Dr. and Mrs. Cowan. Mrs. Williams gave a very
interesting address on Hospitals in Hong Kong; she considers the
medical work is the most effectual way of spreading the Gospel, as in
the healing of the body they can speak about Christ the Great
Healer of souls. Rev. W. Bevan spoke of educational work in
China. Mrs. W. Bevan also answered several questions relating to
woman’s work in China. Dr. - Cowan gave a brief account of the
work he had been engaged in at Aden.
The September meeting was also held at our Pastor’s residence.
We had with us at that meeting Rev. T. Lord, from Madagascar,
who quoted Malagasy proverbs, showing that many of them had
traces of a belief in a Supreme Being; many examples were given of
how witchcraft makes for cruelty among the natives. The Rev. W.
Bevan referred briefly to the difficulties met with by translators of
the Scriptures in selecting a suitable Chinese equivalent for our
word “ God.”
The December meeting lapsed because of the numerous meetings
in that month.
Early in the year the London Missionary Society originated the
plan of collecting “A Million Shillings” towards reducing their
deficiency. The plan was taken up by our auxiliary, and we
succeeded in obtaining 420 shillings for this object.

Testimonial to Dr. Bevan.
COMMITTEE —Mr. Henry Andrews and Mr, J. N. Barker (Joint
Hon. Treasurers) , Mr. E. P. Pilgrim, Dr. E. M. P. Stone, and
Mr. A. Norman [Hon. Secretary).
AT a Church meeting held on 26th January, it was decided to
invite subscriptions to a testimonial to Rev. Dr. Bevan, and the
above Committee was appointed. Circulars were posted to mem-
bers of the Church and congregation and other friends, with the
result that the sum of £521 15s. was collected. A cheque for £5OO
was handed to Dr. Bevan at the Valedictory Meeting held on 15th
February, 1910, and a further cheque for £l9 3s. was posted to
him at Adelaide.

Bazaar.
Held in December, on behalf of the New Hall for
Latrobe St. Mission,
and Medhurst College, Shanghai.
This bazaar was arranged by the united efforts of our own and other
Churches. A large committee and many others rendered valuable
assistance in getting up the various stalls and entertainments. We
desire to offer to all our most cordial thanks.
The Sale was opened on 2nd December by the Lady Mayoress,
Mrs. Burston. The hall was decorated by our Chinese fellow-
citizens, who, with their usual courtesy, lent us some beautiful
banners. We regret that some person was so wanting in politeness
and honesty as to cut off a portion of one of these. We have
apologized to the owners of the banners, but we feel much troubled
at the mischance.
Pressure of engagements prevents a detailed report of the three
days’ proceedings. We were unfortunate in having very wet weather
on the second day, and although the Flower Stall was beautiful, the
Fancy and Needlework Stalls rich in objects of use and charm, the
Provision and Kitchen Stalls full of necessary articles, the Toy Stall
a perfect paradise for the children, the Sweet Stall a delicious and
tempting retreat, the Ice Cream Cave a most successful and alluring
fairy refreshment-hall, and the Fish Pond, Cake Stall, and Refresh-
ments all one could desire, the sums realised did not reach what we
had hoped for. The Kindergarten display was very pretty and
interesting, the nigger minstrels comic and clever, the conjuring and
scientific displays full of merit and amusement, and we were thankful
and glad that all was carried out with perfect happiness and harmony.
The amount paid in to the bank was £ll6 11s. 3d. A few
further sums were afterwards paid in, which met the expenses. The
proceeds were equally divided between the two objects for which the
Bazaar was held.
The treasurer desires to thank with all heartiness everyone who
in any way assisted in the successful carrying out of this project.

Chapel for the use of the Religious Society known as the
Independents in conformity with the provisions of the
Acts in the said now recited Grant mentioned so far as the
same might apply to the trusts of the said Grant and for
no other purpose whatsoever: And whereas by a certain
other Grant from the Crown of the same date, certain
other lands therein described and being allotment number
two of the said section number ten were vested in the said
persons upon trust for the appropriation thereof as the site
of a dwelling house, garden, or other appurtenances for
the Minister duly appointed to officiate in the Chapel for
the use of the Religious Society known as the Independents

the Acts in the said now recited Grant mentioned so far as

number three of the said section number ten were vested
in the said persons upon trust for the erection thereon of a

requisition shall be in writing signed by the members promoting the
same, and shall specify the objects for which the meeting is to be
called, and shall be delivered to the pastor, or in his absence from

10. Every special Church meeting convened for the purpose of
dealing with the Church lands (or the revenue derived therefrom)

right of any member to bring forward business.

to the same day in the next week at the same time and place, and
so from week to week until a quorum be present.


14. The vote at any meeting shall be taken by ballot if desired by
four members present at such meeting.
15. Any of these rules may be suspended at any Church meeting

from) provided there is no dissenting voice or vote.
Miscellaneous.
16. The pastor shall be the president of all societies connected
with or promoted by the Church and, when present, chairman of all
meetings of the same. Provided always that full liberty of action is
preserved to the Church to appoint another chairman for any
particular meeting if, in the opinion of a majority of two-thirds
of those present, it be desirable.
17. The financial year shall close on the 31st December, and an
audit of the accounts shall be made by auditors appointed at any
previous Church meeting. The balance-sheet shall be printed and
be presented at a Church meeting called by the pastor and deacons
every year.
18. These rules shall be printed in all Manuals published by
the Church.
19. No alteration of these rules shall be made except at a special
meeting. Notice, written or printed, of the proposed alteration shall
be sent to every member at least one month before the date of such
meeting, and the sending of such notice by prepaid letter to every
member whose address appears on the Church roll shall be sufficient
evidence of his or her receipt thereof. A majority of two-thirds of the
votes of the members present entitled to vote shall be required to give
effect to any such alteration. No amendment, other than verbal, in
the alterations of which notice shall have been so given shall be
allowed, unless notice in writing of such amendment shall have been
given to the pastor, or in his absence from Melbourne or in case of a
vacancy, to one of the deacons at least three days before the date
