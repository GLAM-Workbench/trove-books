PREFACE.
In scanning this provincial souvenir
of the War, this remembrancer of
calamitous events, and of warriors
directly connected with horror and
carnage on a scale whose vastness has
no parallel in the world’s wide annals,
a trinity of thoughts and emotions will
dominate the minds and hearts of most
people, especial^ 7 the bereaved rela-
tives and friends of the men from the
Shire of Mansfield who, participating
in the dreadful drama, were fated to
make the supreme sacrifice, and also
the brothers-in-arms of the fallen
heroes, comrades who, having borne
the torment, the bitterness and the
agxmy of it all, yet happily survive.
This triune of feelings comprises
Grief, Gratitude and Pride. Each in
turn will sway the hearts and minds
of readers, while all three will to some
extent possess their souls. Relatives’
grief at the loss to them, the irre-
parable loss, of their beloved fallen
heroes, and the heavy grief of com-
rades must necessarily leave upon the
hearts of such kindred and comrades
its poignant, lasting impress. Each
in his own wa3 7 will
“ Assuage the feeling
He may not wholly stay ;
By silence sanctifying, not concealing,
The grief that must have way.”
If 011I3' for the nonce, gratitude must
hold sway over the readers who scan
the letterpress and the portraits in this
book. Gratitude, not only to the
gallant men who have fortunately
returned to our region, but particularly
to “the unreturning brave”: Deep
gratitude will stir us, not more for
those who fell in the tiring line than
for the many who fell on the way to
their objective. Pride, also, a pardon-
able pride, must make us exult :
Because conscientious, sturdj', healthy
men, sensitive and intellectual to a
degree, hastened at a nation’s call to
defend a righteous cause, and embark-
ing on perilous seas, haunted b3 7 death,
braved the fate that has cost too man3 T
of them their lives ; because their
morale, like their prowess, was splen-
did ; because, like their fortunately
. surviving comrades, the fallen ones
contributed their quota to the renown
at arms (to the fame which has few
parallels), won b3 r Australians in the
late Armageddon,—men to whom the
shedding of human blood was most
foul and repugnant; men who had


not to be taught that the slaughter of men was about the last and
worst of tasks which Duty and Justice could demand of them.
Yes, because of all this —their ready response to duty, their
exploits and their sacrifices —we feel a pride that is not incon-
sistent with gratitude and grief. This trinity of emotions, like
elemental forces, has swayed us, and must sway us again and
again. And now, in our subconsciousness, amidst a tempest of
gentle weeping, we hear clearl} r , as from a clarion voice, this
cheering assurance : That the deeds of our dead warriofs have
made them heroes ever}' one, and that our loss is their sempiternal
gain. Is not such assurance as reasonable as it is cheering ? Is
it not a mandate to banish the tears of grief, and to let an exuber-
ance of pride and of joy take possession of us ? Our manhood to
the number of over 300, at Duty’s call, flew from the office, the
school, the workshop and the mine : from the green valleys, the
fruitful uplands and the mountain fastnesses of this favored
region. Leaving the theatre of their hopes, joys and laudable
ambitions, they enlisted in the A.I.F. to engage in a deadly task.
What was the grim task that conscience impelled them to under-
take ? It was to help destroy a devil-suggested military Monster
of man’s creation which menaced the world, and to aid in the
enthronement of enduring Peace ! By enlisting, they made
manifest their readiness to run all risks, however horrible ; and,
putting forth on seas sown with mines, they demonstrated some
of their courage. Generally, their demeanour while training in
Victoria gave evidence of their altruism and of their love of
humanity and of justice. Indeed, like Virgiliali shepherds, they
yielded to Love, the triumphant. (Omnia vincit Amor: et nos
cedamus Amori). The lives of some of our dead young- heroes
before their embarkation are said to have been so eventful and
romantic that a record thereof would read strange as fiction. Had
we such a record, we could not use it here, although we should be
pleased to use it elsewhere. Limits of space necessitated the
curtailment and condensation of much of the matter obtained for
inclusion herein. Between fifty and sixty of the gallant, oppres-
sion-hating men, who embarked from our midst, were destined
neyer again to glad our e3'es, until the last trumpet is sounded,
and the doom of Death itself shall be revealed to us :
‘‘ On Fame’s eternal camping ground
Their silent tents are spread,
And Glory guards, with solemn round,
The bivouac of the dead.”
We do not think we can do better than conclude with an
address delivered on 4th November, 1918, by Monseigneur the
Bishop of Amiens, in the Church of Long (Somme), in memory of
the Australian Officers, N.C.O.’s and Men fallen on the battle
fields :
“My General, Officers, Non-Commissioned Officers and Men of the
First Australian Division, After the words that but a few moments ago
have fallen from the lips of one of your Chaplains in the pulpit, it behoves
me, knowing little of your beautiful language, to be silent, but if I give
no utterance to my thoughts as this impressive ceremony nears its conclu-
sion, 1 would fail in the fulfilment of a triple duty which my conscience
dictates to me : The duty of prayer for your numerous fallen, resting in


peace in my land of Picardy, and on the borders of the Somme. The duty
of gratefulness for the liberation of my Diocese from the enemy's yoke ;
and the dutv of admiration for your heroism, which has placed you in the
foremost ranks amongst the bravest in this unique war. Together we
have prayed for your fallen, and their immortal souls have appeared
before God, who has judged them. As our human praise expires on the
brink of their tomb, we are powerless to grant them the Glory to which
they have a right. For that reason we pray the Lord to grant them an
award worthy of their sacrifice. May He make them perfectly saintly and
beautiful ; that they may one and all, without delay, have a right to an
eternal crown, and a glorious immortality. As Bishop of Armiens, I owe
vou and your illustrious dead my heartfelt thanks, because the land of my
Diocese has been your held of battle, and you have delivered it by the
sacrifice of your blood. During the painful days of the invasion you made
a rampart of vour breasts, behind which you shielded and saved the last
shreds of my territory. Later, when victory at last began to smile upon
our arms, the Australian Army distinguished itself by the audacity of its
attacks, by its utter disregard of death, by its doggedness, and by the
rapidity of its advance. In the name of my Clergy and of my people 1
offer you my heartfelt gratitude and admiration.
“ Gentlemen, your dead were great men, and amongst the most
illustrious, because they obeyed the highest inspirations. Why did you
leave vour far-awav Australia? Because of your sentiments of loyalty
towards the British Empire, whose banner has protected the British
Empire and the development of y'our country, its existence, and its
economic future, and its civilisation, for these were in jeopardy' as well as
the destinies of France. It was necessary to save from German violence
the honor of the world ; for that reason you left your shores and
crossed oceans, for the honor of your country and its future. It takes
blood to cement the foundation of a country, and you could not refuse it
in the world war. To the cause of Christianity you have indeed lavished
it with a saintlv generosity, and in so doing have written a glorious page
in the history of Australia. On the field of battle, far away from your
homes, the love of your country became stronger in your hearts, and
children who, during the coining centuries grow up in your homes and
schools, will learn through y'our great deeds the lesson of Patriotism.
They' will not be able to pronounce your names without speaking of the
towns, villages, tablelands, ridges and valleys of the Somme, where you
have gathered the laurels of immortality. Indissoluble links unite our two
nations —a link of prayer because we. will piously keep the tombs of your
heroes ; a link of friendship, because the freedom of my Diocese has cost
you so much blood ; a link of mutual admiration, because the hearts of
our soldiers (Australian and French) beat with the same love and with the
same enthusiasm for the saintly cause whose final triumph assure the
future and development of our two countries under the eyes of God, who
has blessed our arms.”


FOREWORD.
BY GEN. SIB WILLIAM RIDDELL BIRD WOOD,
K.C.8., K.C.5.1., K.C.M.G., C. 8,! A.D.C., C.1.E., D.S.O.
Commanding 1 the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.
I feel sure that this Illustrated Volume, containing the
photographs of members of the A.I.F. from the Mansfield
District, will be welcomed and appreciated as a memorial of the
gallant and good services which they willingly rendered in the
cause of Right and Freedom. It is by means of such records
that their fine example of self-sacrifice and devotion to their
country will be handed down to future generations, in whose
hands the future of this great Commonwealth will lie, and who
will, I trust, maintain the magnificent traditions and spirit of the
A.I.F. in carrying out their duties of citizenship.
