By the ftudy of Geography, a man that hath not opportunity nor means of
travelling, may with as much benefit, but far lefs danger and expence, acquaint
himfelf with the particular defcriptions of Kingdoms, Provinces, Cities, Towns,
and Caftles, with all things confiderable in the fame, together with the cuftomes,
manners, and difpofitions of all Forrain Nations : and that too in as full a manner,
as if he had furvey’d the one, and obferved the other, by a perfonall vifit of the
places reprefented to him.
Peter Heylyn — Cosmographie, 1652.
.... And here, ere I am launched into such an interminable ocean, let me
say a word or two of comfort and encouragement to both “young” and “old.”
The theme to be touched is full of interest.
The Books which relate to Yoyages and Travels are among the most precious
in our Libraries. I speak, of course, of well authenticated Travels ; and not of such
stuff as the fictions of Psalmanazar, and the fabrications of Damberger. Within
the precincts of his Library, the Collector of Voyages and Travels makes himself
acquainted with all countries, climates, and characters. The sea always carries
him to his destined port in safety ; and the land is always secure from banditti.
He sits “ in his easy chair ” and associates with warriors, legislators, philosophers,
or savages ; he now scales the perilous height, and now traverses the plain with
equal impunity. To him, the wild beast of the forest, and the reptile of the
desert, is equally innocuous. Nor do physical causes present either harm or
impediment. The snows of the Alps or the Andes, and the fires of Vesuvius or
.Etna neither freeze his blood nor scorch his skin. He knows not hunger or thirst:
although hundreds of his fellow-creatures are perishing from both causes. If it be
the season of winter, he draws close his crimson curtain, stirs his wood-coal fire,
trims his lamp, sinks upon his couch —and throws himself into sunuy regions,
where the lime, and tamarind, and pomegranate, yield their refreshing juices. Or,
should the summer dart its heat upon his head, he seeks the northern arbour of
his garden ; and cool, beneath the mixed foliage of the holly, and ivy, and
clematis —over the whole of which the woodbine throws its sweet-scented tendrils
—he spreads his folio or his quarto upon the rustic table ; now gazes upon the
highly-wrought plates, and now buckles himself to the uninterrupted perusal of
the instructive text. In such a recess he is cooled by the fancied breezes of
Kamtschatka or Spitsbergen ; and thus, turning over the pages of Cook or Parry,
the hours steal away, and the sun is sinking low in the horizon. But, whether
winter or summer, the volumes of Hakluyt and of Purchas will never fail to
afford an inexhaustible fund of amusement.
Rev. T. F. Dibdin— Library Companion, 1824.

O Thou that after the impetuous rage of five bloody Inundations, and the
fucceeding Sword of inteftine Warre, foaking the Land in her owne gore, didft
pilty the fad and ceafles revohnion of our fvvift and thick-comming forrowes when
wee were quite breathleffe, of Thy free grace didft motion Peace, and termes of
Cov’nant with u<, and having firft welnigh freed us from Antichriftian thraldome,
didft build up this Britannick Empire to a glorious and enviable heighth with all
her Daughter Hands about her, ftay us in this felicite.
Milton, Of Reformation in England, 1641.
My hold of the Colonies is in the close affection which grows from common
names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges, and equal protection. These
are ties, which, though light as air, are strong as links of iron. Let the colonies
always keep the idea of their civil rights associated with your government ;
they will cling and grapple to you ; and no force under heaven will be of power
to tear them from their allegiance As long as you have the wisdom to
keep the sovereign authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty, the
sacred temple consecrated to our common faith, wherever the chosen race and
sons of England worship freedom, they will turn their faces towards you. The
more they multiply, the more friends you will have ; the more ardently they
love liberty, the more perfect will be their obedience.
Burke —Speech on Conciliation with America, 1775.
The colony trade is more advantageous to Great Britain than any other ; and
the monopoly, by forcing into that trade a greater proportion of the capital of
Great Britain than what would otherwise have gone to it, has turned that
capital into an employment more advantageous to the country than any other
which it could have found.
Adam Smith —The Wealth of Rations, 1775.
There need be no hesitation in affirming that Colonization, in the present
state of the world, is the very best affair of business, in which the capital of an
old and wealthy country can possibly engage.
John Stuart Mill —Political Economy, 1848.
Much of the power and influence of this country depends upon its having
large Colonial possessions in different parts of the world.
Earl Grey —Colonial Policy, 1852.


PREFACE.
The present Catalogue embraces the Geographical and
Colonial portions of a somewhat extensive miscellaneous
library, which I have gradually accumulated during the past
thirty years.
Although no traveller myself, 1 have always taken great
interest in the work of travellers; an interest which has
been kept up by the friendly personal relations, which it
has been my privilege to enjoy, with many of the most
illustrious explorers of our generation. To some of these I
am indebted lor presentation copies of their works and for
specimens of Natural History, Economic Botany, and
Ethnology, contributed to a private Museum of the products
of various countries which I have also been engaged in
forming.* It is natural, therefore, that I should have
desired to possess a library of geography and travel, and I
have endeavoured to make it as complete as the means
and opportunities at my disposal permitted.
The idea of publishing a Catalogue of this part of my
library originated in the want which I have often felt of
a book ot reference giving something more than brief titles
arranged in alphabetical order. The present Catalogue gives,
in order of their date and classified according to countries,
the full titles of geographical books, including the contents
of miscellaneous collections, such as those of Hakluyt,
Purchas, Churchill, Burney, and others. At first intended
to include the Australasian sections only, its scope has been
enlarged, and it now embraces Discovery and Travel as well as
* A separate Catalogue of this collection has been printed, under the
title of “Catalogue of the Nature and Art Collection/’ Letcombe Regis,
1876.


PREFACE.
3, York Gate, Regent’s Park, N.W.
August, 1882.
Colonization in all parts of the world. Believing in its utility,
as far as the extent of my own library goes, I now offer it
to collectors and students. While it in no section pretends
to be complete or exhaustive, the titles, being in chronological
order, are sufficient in several of the geographical sections to
mark the course of discovery and exploration, and, in the
colonial sections, to indicate the progress and history of
each dependency. It thus forms a useful index to a know-
ledge of the varied circumstances, physical and political, of
the countries and peoples of the world, and shows still more
clearly the vast extent and ever increasing importance of the
numerous possessions of our own unbounded empire. It may,
I hope, possibly draw attention to the prospects and resources of
our Colonies, a subject with urgent claims upon the study of the
politician and the statesman as well as the merchant and the
capitalist. And, not as mere dependencies, but as component
parts of the Empire which, at no distant future, must become
of greater importance in the world than the mother country
herself.
Eor assistance in collecting and the labour involved in
the compilation of the Catalogue I am much indebted to my
friend Mr. E. A. Petherick, E.E.G.S., a gentleman who has
made the history and bibliography of this branch of literature,
particularly as regards the British Colonies, his especial study.
He has devoted much care and time to the task, and spared no
pains to render it complete, adding to the Catalogue proper two
Alphabetical Indexes, one of countries and the other of authors,
which will greatly facilitate reference.
The plan of the Catalogue is one I should like to see
extended to much larger collections, or, indeed, to the whole
literature of geography; for by it a student, with very little
trouble, may learn what books, or what memoirs and articles
buried in miscellaneous collections, periodicals, and in Trans-
actions of Societies, have been published on any country
regarding which he may be in search of information.

This Newspaper may be said to have had its origin in S. TV. Silver A Co.'s
Emigration Guide, containing useful information for intending Colonists,
first issued in May, 1858. Numerous editions, revised and enlarged,
appeared during the next four years, and forty or fifty thousand copies
were circulated. This gave place to S. TV. Silver A Co. ’s Hand Books
to the Colonies, viz.:— Australia and Hew Zealand, [4154]; South
Africa, [3965] ; Canada, Ac., [3796] Supplemented by S. TV. Silver A
Co.’s Monthly Register, begun in 1864, altered to S. TV. Silver A Co.’s
Circular, in 1866. Required twice-a-month, in 1871, the “Circular” took
another form and addition to its title, becoming S. TV. Silver A Co.’s
A Circular and Colonial News. This title was again altered to The
Colonies: S. TV. Silver A Co. 's Circular, under which it appeared during
1872-74; and to The Colonies, during 1875-76, with illustrations.
Finally it assumed its present title, The Colonics and Lidia, in January,
1877, and since that time it has been issued weekly.

As yet “the finest production of the Australian Press.” Artist, Author,

of a place by the side of the best of its class issued in this country—
the “Picturesque Europe” of the Messrs. Cassell, or the “Picturesque
America,” published by the Messrs. Appleton of New York. The
illustrations are one hundred in number, including wood-engravings and
twelve full-page lithographs, showing forest, hill, river, and lake
scenery, Post Offices, Town Halls, Banks, Churches, State Schools,
Colleges, Hospitals, and other public buildings in Melbourne, Ballarat,
and many other towns, the sites of which but a few years ago were
untrodden wastes, or occupied only by the gum tree. “Altogether this
handsome volume is a worthy memorial of the Exhibition Year, a
satisfactory index of the progress of the colony, and a credit to all
concerned in its production.”

This is a most valuable and interesting work. Dr. Thomson had special
opportunities of collecting oral and written evidence during a lesidenco

privileges of using Unpublished and Official documents the Author was
thus “able to sketch the Natural History of the Country ; to Narrate
the Story of its People ; their Spiritual Conquest, and the advance of
Civilization among them ; to show how a few Anglo-Saxons planted and
managed a Colony in the midst of Cannibals, and to describe their by-
gone dangers and difficulties, their etiorts to render a theoretical con-
stitution practically useful, and the progress they have made in develop-
ing the resources of England’s most distant colony. (Preface.) The
work is divided into three parts : Part I. — The Country and its Native
Inhabitants : Geography and Natural History ; Climate ; Migration of
