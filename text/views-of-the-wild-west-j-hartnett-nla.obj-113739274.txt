MOUNT LYELL MINING AND RAILWAY CO.
MT. LYELL MINING AND RAILWAY CO. is the
largest and most important mine in Tasmania. What
Broken Hill is to New South Wales, and Mt. Morgan to
Queensland, so is Mt. Lyell to Tasmania.
For a Company to become successful in Mining on the
West Coast of Tasmania it has to build its own Railway system,
create a Township, and support an army of men. The Mt. Lyell
Co. has done all this in the last 5 or 6 years.
The Mt. Lyell Mining and Railway Co., Ltd., was suc-
cessfully floated, the Capital being £900,000, in 300,000
Shares of £3 each, of which 25,000 Shares remain to be
issued.
The Mine has already expended over £1,000,000 of Capital.
It is paying to the Shareholders dividends in the aggregate of
about £50,000 per quarter.
Its Smelting Plant is equal to any in the World, capable
of treating 1,400 tons of Ore per day.
The Smelting Works are situated about two miles
south of the Mine, and about one mile north of Queens-
town, where also the Company’s Offices and Sawmills are
situated.


There are six Furnaces in No. 1 Plant, and five in No. 2.
These Furnaces are the largest and best equipped in
Australia, and the most modern appliances are used for hand-
ling the Ore, Flux, Fuel, etc.
The Converting Plant is equally complete and up-to-date.
The Flux Quarries are situated near the Railway Station,
and the Flux, when excavated, is conveyed by a short Aerial
Ropeway to where it is crushed, and from there conveyed by
rail to the Smelters. Up till two years’ ago the only way to
convey the Ore from the Mine to the Smelters was by means
of a haulage line, 58 chains long, and having a gradient of one
in three, the steepest being one in two. The total rise from
the Mine to the summit is 440 ft., and the total descent from
the summit to the Junction, with the two-foot Railway at the
bottom, 710 ft. The first proposal was to tunnel through this
spur, but, owing to the enormous expense, the haulage system
was adopted. At the present time they also have an Aerial
Ropeway, which conveys Ore not only from the Blow but also
from some of the Mines at North Lyell.
The system'of working the Mine is chiefly by open cuts,
although tunnels and shafts have been put in to find the depth
and extent of the deposit.
“ Roughly speaking,” says one writer, '‘about £10,000,000
has yet to pass through the Smelters, independently of what
may be found below No. 5 Tunnel.”
The officials of the Mine deserve a word of praise.
Mr. R. C. Sticht, the General Manager, is one of the fore-
most Metallurgists south of the Line, and to his skill, energy,
and foresight, is largely due the success which has attended
the Company:
He is ably assisted by Mr. W. T. Batchelor, Mine Manager,
Mr. G, F. Beardsley, Metallurgist, Mr. E. C. Driffield, Super-
intending Engineer Railway Department. Mr. A. Macnicol,
Engineer-in-charge Smelter Department, Mr. H. Wesley,
Assistant-Metallurgist, and a large staff of competent officers.
Altogether, the Company employ about 2,500 men.
