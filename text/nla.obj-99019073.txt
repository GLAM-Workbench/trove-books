CULTIVATION OF COTTON IN AUSTRALIA.
We, the Undersigned, being desirous that an experiment should be made, on a limited but sufficiently
extensive scale, to ascertain the capabilities of the Soil and Climate of Cookslanu, in North Eastern
Australia, for the Growth of Cotton and other Tropical Produce, by means of European Free Labour,
as proposed and recommended by the Rev. Dr. Lang, Member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales ;
and understanding that a party of from fifty to one hundred families of Agriculturists could be engaged for
the purpose, and sent out to Australia, under the superintendence of an experienced Cotton Planter from the
United States, before the close of the present year, and that, in the event of their reaching their destination,
as it is probable they would, in the month of April next, they would be able to lay down a considerable extent
of land in Cotton during the months of May, June, and July, which are the winter months in the Southern
Hemisphere, so as to gather in next year’s crop in the months of November and December following; and
being given to understand, moreover, that such an experiment could be made and carried out for an outlay
of £5,000, we do hereby agree to contribute the sums herein-underspecified for making that experiment; the
same to be under the exclusive direction of Dr. Lang : on the understanding and condition that the said sums
shall be repaid with interest at five per cent., if the experiment should realise the expectations of Dr. Lang
and his coadjutors; but if not, that such an amount shall be repaid as may be realised from the under-
taking, with such facilities as the Government may adopt for carrying it out.
