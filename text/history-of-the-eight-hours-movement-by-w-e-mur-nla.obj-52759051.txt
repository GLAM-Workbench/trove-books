Ode in Liberty.
As after days of weather black with low’ring cloud,
Whose sullen gloom is only broke by thunder loud.
The sun shines forth with radiance bright,
Dispelling clouds and shedding light
On lowly worm and lordly man,
Part all of Nature’s God-like plan
So after years of Bigot’s zeal and Tyrant’s power,
Of Ignorance and Superstition’s cursed dower,
Of protests vainly made by Mind in darkest hour
Thou shinest—Heavenborn Liberty !
With noblest rays of Charity,
That gently soothe Adversity,
That pay the due to Honesty
That bind the bonds of Unity,
Making all men manly, free,
In the future yet to be.
We, sons of Australasia’s soil,
Her sons of labour and of toil,
Hail thee with Freemen’s true Australian cheer,
On this our Emblem Day of all the year.
" It is characteristic of much of the fugitive literature of our day,
that it emanates from pens specially associated with the inner life
of the various political and social movements demanding attention.
Carlyle, in one of his essays, declared that it was impossible for
anyone to produce a serviceable biography, unless keenly sym-
pathising with the aims and struggles of the hero of the narrative ;
and in like manner it may be said that a writer who takes part in
the work of an organisation is, if otherwise qualified, best fitted to
interest the public in the story of its development.”— The Age, 25th
October, 1887.

PREFACE.
The compiler of this volume, in order to save any
possible chance of misapprehension among his readers,
desires to state that the object of his book .is solely and
wholly to give for the first time—so far as he knows—
a consecutive narrative not only of the history of the
Eight Hours' Movement, but also its establishment as a
system.
The credit of the latter belongs, without doubt, to
Australia ; forgetfulness or ignorance of which point has
rendered previous publications on the subject unreliable
as a true and faithful record.
The compiler has been fortunate enough, through an
experience of some thirty years, to have known many
of the leaders and establishes of probably the greatest
movement of the century, as regards the social
amelioration of the working classes, and it is his present
hope that the publication of this narrative will act as a
stimulus to the daily increasing desire now being ex-
pressed all over the world, to extend the system of
abridged hours of labour in order to keep pace with the
rapidly growing system of production by machinery,
&c., which unfortunately too frequently produces over-
production, unholy competition, gluts in markets,
stagnation and its baneful result —misery to thousands
who are solely dependent on wages for a livelihood.
Finally, the compiler wishes to assert emphatically
that this work is not in any way a history of Trades
Unionism, nor does it affect to deal with conflicts
between Capital and Labour.
In this connection it may safely be affirmed that there
are thousands of the working classes who are now
reaping the blissful advantages of the Eight Hours’
system who have never been, and who may never be,
connected with labour organisations.


DEDICATION.
To the Pioneers of the Eight Hours’ System.
Gentlemen, —
I have been requested by the Eight Hours’
Anniversary Committee of 1896 to dedicate this little
work to the Pioneers of the Eight Hours’ System.
I do so with pleasure and with pride. No other
satisfaction, permanent or fleeting, which its publication
may afford myself can compare with the honour which I
feel has been conferred on me by that request, and the
acceptance by you of my humble efforts to comply with
the desire of your worthy successors. To you, gentle-
men, it must be obvious that the haze which a lapse of
forty years has shed around the details of your noble
achievement, almost chills the most sanguine desires to
chronicle more than a moiety of the justice which you
might expect should be yours on this world-wide ques-
tion.
It has been reserved, however, for its representa-
tives of 1896 to be in a great measure the herald of
your honoured names and fame in many lands. For
this posterity will thank them, while all good men of
the future, whether employers or workmen, will feel
that history has not produced a more exalted ideal for
emulation than those solemn engagements brought
about in 1856, by the operations of peace and wisdom,
and ratified by the seal of success through forty years
to-day. I am well aware that in the long head roll
of the pioneers there are many whose names should
be recorded, but my limits preclude for the present a
more extended appreciation of the men who have
assisted to bestow so great a blessing on humanity.
Permit me, Gentlemen, to remain, with great
respect,
Your faithful servant,
W. E. MURPHY.
Melbourne, 21st April, 1896.


Ode to the Eight Hours' Pioneers.
April 2ist, 1896.
This day, just forty years ago,
The well-fought fight was won
By true hearts set in steel-wrought frames,
Through whom bright Freedom shone.
All honour to their glorious names,
Which ne’er shall be forgot
While life blood thrills through grateful hearts
Enjoying their favoured lot.
In this Victoria, our dear land,
The first that dared be free,
To show the world what freedom meant
In new lands 'cross the sea.
And honour too to those who’ve held,
Through all the years since then,
Steadfastly to the Cause they won,
And proved themselves true men.
A tear for those who’ve passed away
From out this faithful band ;
Their fight being fought, they now take rest
In God’s own peaceful land.
HAMILTON MACKINNON.


NAMES AND OCCUPATIONS
OF THE
Officers and Members of the 40th Anniversary Committee
OF THE
EIGHT HOURS’ SYSTEM OF VICTORIA.
John Hyman (bootmaker), President. Born in London,
1857; arrived in Victoria, 1882. Mr. Hyman has
filled many responsible positions in connection with
labour movements. He is possessed of the excellent
quality of method in administration, while he is
always courteous and agreeable, and being gifted
with an easy fluency of speech the popularity he has
won is well deserved.
Samuel Harrison (cutter), Treasurer, is a native ot
Baltimore, U.S.A., where he first saw the light in
1856, and arrived in Melbourne ten years later. As
Treasurer, Mr. Harrison has secured the confidence
of the Eight Hours’ bodies, by a close and unosten-
tatious discharge of the onerous duties of his office.
Charles Harris (saddler), Secretary, and former
Treasurer of the Eight Hours’ Anniversary Com-
mittee, is the only Australian native among the
principal officers. Born in South Australia in the
year 1857, he in 1882 exchanged the scenes of his
youth for the Queen City of the South, on the banks
of the Yarra Yarra. The huge proportions which
the Eight Hours' fete has of late years obtained,
invests the duties of Secretary with grave responsi-
bilities. It is not to indulge in hyperbole to say
that there are times when he must be equal to the
duties of all officers, and the whole committee, of
whom he is necessarily the chief representative.
To be a success in this office a man must be
possessed of application, firmness, tact, and judg-
ment—such a man is Charles Harris.


Henry Belfrage (mariner), Vice President, member of
the Marine Board of Victoria. Born, 1841, at Edin-
burgh. Indentured to the sea at South Shields,
England. Arrived in Victoria from New York,
1864. Engaged in the coastal trade until 1867,
when he sailed for the west coast of New Zealand
on the breaking out of the gold rush. Remained
there four years, and returned to Melbourne, but
soon after left for the celebrated Gulgong and
Parkes gold fields, New South Wales, from whence
he returned in 1876 to this city, rejoining the coastal
trade for a few years, until his official connection
with the Seamen’s Union caused him to settle on
shore.
Ode to the Wanes.
DEDICATED TO HENRY BELFRAGE.
I.
The blue sea waves have been my home
For five and fifty years.
I loved their calm, and I loved their foam,
These five and fifty years.
In the fo'cs’le snug, when the rum sped round,
Mid ditties, and yarns, and cheers,
I toasted the waves on the “ Outward Bound,"
Listless of the rolling years.
11.
1 watched them sport in the moonlight sheen,
As phantoms of night appears,
And the weird winds sang to the mystic scene,
Songs of the waning years.
And when they roared, as I heard them roar,
Men quailed, and maids shed tears ;
But I laughed at their fright, as sea dogs of yore,
Dogs, of fivh and fifty years.
111.
Yet must I leave the waves for a bleak lee shore,
After five and fifty years,
For the sea-dog's s eep, where I'll never more
Count five and fifty years ?
When life's Captain above, who rules the waves,
The flag of Doom doth rear,
And call sea-dogs brave from nameless graves
To an everlasting year.

HISTORY
OF THE
Eight Hours' Movement.
CHAPTER I.—INTRODUCTION.
The Royal Baker and the Eight Hours—The System
in the 15th Century—The “Black Death”—
Dreams of Eight Hours by British Workmen—
The late Thos. Brassey and the Nine Hours'
Movement—The Chartists—Presbyterian Projec-
tors —Pioneers sail in the ships John Wickliffe and

Tradition, in these matter-of-fact days, frequently
begets scepticism, and although an ancient philosopher
of the Greeks has said that “ incredulity is the soul of
all wisdom,” it would nevertheless, in the compilation of
historical events, be obviously imprudent to reject
testimony which, in the natural order of things, is quite
consistent with surrounding facts, and yet cannot be
Proved by documentary evidence.


Patriotic Englishmen are naturally proud of the
celebrated Saxon monarch —the only one of our kings
who has borne the surname of “ Greatyet much of
the story of Alfred’s achievements rests upon no better
foundation than the acceptance of traditional elements
deduced from an estimate of his character and environ-
ments. It is not, therefore, much subject for wonder
that a person standing amongst the enormous crowds
that line the streets of an Australian city on an Eight
Hours’ Celebration Day, will hear some pedantic
individual gravely affirm that the system which called
forth the demonstration was “ in vogue in the time of
Alfred the Great.” It has been sufficiently established
that Alfred rebuilt London, and he introduced foreign
mechanics and artisans for such work ; that, in the
construction of several mansions, he copied examples of
the improved architecture which he observed while on
his travels through the Continent of Europe; and that
he was scrupulously exact, and even generous, in the
payment of his workmen. It is further beyond question
that Alfred’s code of laws was a merciful and just
innovation, superseding the tyrannical enactments of
the heptarchy. Slaves were declared to be free
after six years’ service, and stringent measures were
observed for the prevention of Sunday working. Slaves
were, before this, designated theow, thrael, esne, and
men —bless the mark—who were liable to be whipt,
branded, and worked in yokes as were horses and oxen,
until Alfred’s code recognised the first principles of
humanity, and heralded the dawn of a new and a better
life.
It is inconceivable, however, that in an epoch when
three-fourths of the people were in a semi-barbaric state,


and liable to be bought and sold as mere chattels, with
their wives and families, along with the land of which
they were appurtenances, and ruled over by a monarch
who, although endowed with great natural wisdom, was
destitute of the first elements of book-learning until he
attained maturity, that such a reform as the adoption of
an eight hours’ working day could be other than a
dream. Alfred’s visit to Rome in the earlier years of his
life must have imbued him with a desire for a knowledge
of the liberal arts which he subsequently practised with
a view to the improvement of his untutored subjects;
but it must be obvious that forced labour was almost as
common in Rome in the days of Alfred as it was at the
building of Solomon’s temple, and could not have
impressed him in favour of the civilising influences of
reasonable hours of labour to the proletariat of his time.
While the Saxon monarch was alternating his studies
in the pursuit of the Danes and technological skill, it is
related that he obtained one of his first lessons in the
latter from the wife of a cowherd dwelling on the
morasses of Athelney, in Somersetshire. Alfred (so
tradition affirms), while resting incognito at the humble
cot of the cowherd, was entrusted by the good woman
to watch carefully some loaves which were being baked
for the family meal; but through inadvertence and being
too busily engrossed with his bows and arrows, he per-
mitted the cakes to burn, and received a sound “ box o’
the ear” from'the herdsman’s wife, who rushed forward
exclaiming—
“ Ca’en thee mind the ke-aks, man, and doossen zee ’em burn ?
I’m boun’ thee’s eat ’em vast enough, or zoon as ’tiz the turn.”
Making all allowances for these literary pleasantries,
which act as seasoning to the drier measures of which


our early history is in general composed, we can still find
in the life of Alfred warrant for the suggestion that the
more enlightened policy which prevailed under the
gild-scipe, and approved by him, is consistent with the
theory that an abridgment of the hours of labour which
prevailed under the Anglo-Saxons was in Alfred’s reign
carried out.
To what extent that abridgment reached we have
no means of elucidating, further than by reference
to one of the early guild statutes, which prescribes that
“ no one shall work longer than from the beginning of
the day to curfew, nor at night by candle light.” The
mention of candle light in this statute may inferentially
account for its origin as having taken place during
Alfred’s reign, through the circumstance related by
Asser, the celebrated historian, and contemporary of the
monarch, who says, *“ He kept in his chapel a wax
taper continually burning before the relics of the saints
which was divided into equal portions of eight hours
each. . . . He also appointed a servant, whose duty it
was, as each of these portions was consumed and finished,
in a loud voice to warn the king of the portion about
to succeed, a wax taper being thus consumed each day.”
The reference, therefore, would appear to point to a
religious rather than a social origin, and its application
to the working hours of the labouring classes is not even
suggested by such writers as Dr. Pauli, Hughes, Aubrey,
nor Asser, who would undoubtedly have left some record
of such an important regulation if it existed, either by
guild statute or the exercise of royal favour.
Dr. Brentano and others have traced the birth of the
guilds to the Anglo-Saxons long before Alfred’s time,
♦Aubrey's History of England, Vol. I, (p. 73.)


although they were probably founded by the German
tribes on the Continent before any of our records showed
their existence in Britain ; but beyond the bare fact
that the guilds had the power of regulating, to some
extent, both the wage rate and the hours of working, no
evidence exists either before or during the reign of Alfred
the Great of an established Eight Hours' Day, and the
continued repetition of the fallacy is not a little repug-
nant to common sense.
Mr. George Howell, in his *“ Conflicts of Capital and
Labour ,” certainly supports the tradition, and relates
how “ there is a constant yearning amongst working
men for an Eight Hours’ Day,” and that at their social
and convivial gatherings one toast “at all times is
enthusiastically responded to,” namely —
"Eight hours to work, eight hours to play,
Eight hours to sleep, eight ‘ bob ’ a day.”
The couplet, however, is not of Australian origin, as
suggested by Messrs. Webb and Cox, the authors of
t“ The Eight Hours' Day." Indeed, throughout all the
agitation in Australasia for the acquisition of the Eight
Hours’ limit, workmen in these colonies would not have
considered it matter for glorification to sing aloud for a
reduced wage, which eight shillings a day would assur-
edly mean to them; as soon would we expect to hear
British workmen feel pride in the refrain—
" Over the hills to the poorhouse,
We’ll wander alone there—and die."
Equally difficult will it be to prove beyond the realms of
fancy, the existence of the boon in mediaeval times. The

plague, or “ Black Death” of 1349, swept away 50,000
of the population of Great Britain, and completely
prostrated the remainder in such frightful misery that
it is probable the villiens or handicraftsmen who survived
were enabled to dictate their own terms and conditions
of labour for some time subsequent to the disaster.
It would certainly be less surprising to an Australian
casuist if he discovered some expounder of moral deduc-
tions drawn from the chronicles of that period, to insist
that an inaugural procession of the Eight Hours’
System paraded the streets of London in 1349, than the
re-iteration of the Alfredian theory, or the more specious
one evolved in 1878 concerning the golden age, and
spoken of by the late Professor J. E. Thorold Rogers* in
his “ Work and Wages” in the following emphatic
manner:—“ The artisan who is demanding at this time
an Eight Hours’ Day in the building trade is simply
striving to recover what his ancestor worked by four or
five centuries ago.”
How far even this hypothetical statement has gained
credence in England may be gauged by some later
writers on the question. Robertson says,t “ Now, it is
not in any way conclusive as to the present day problem
whether or not the workers of the 14th and 15th cen-
turies had or had not during these centuries an ordinary
Eight Hours’ Day ; and it would be somewhat comfort-
ing to believe they had ; but on the simple question of fact
it is not easy to come to Rogers’ conclusion.” Nor are
Webb and Cox on much firmer ground in dealing with
the learned professor’s opinions ; they say “ Those • who
have' any experience of the length of time that traditions
* Six Centuries of Work and Wages, by J. E. Thorold Rogers,
i Eight Hours' Question. Robertson (p. 121.


linger among an illiterate class will not think it alto-
gether fanciful to suppose that the modern ideal of an
Eight Hours’ Day is the half-forgotten survival of a
long-cherished memory of a former shorter day.”
The genesis of Rogers’ assumption of the existence
of an Eight-Hours’ Day, is in the improved condition of
the people during the fifteenth century, rendering it
probable that the guilds obtained immunities by charter,
which, on the introduction of the Flemings and other
foreign workmen from the continent, laid the successful
foundation of our manufacturing arts.
All historians agree on this; but, if a reduction in
the hours of labour took place at that period, as Rogers
asserts, “It is plain that the day was one of Eight
Hours,”* then indeed we are forced to the conclusion
that slavery, which still existed in the fifteenth century,
had at least one advantage over freedom, viz., that
employers of that age were actuated by the same all-
sufficient motive in the preservation of the lives of their
bondsmen as of their cattle,selfishness.
It must be remembered that villiemge was still extant
in the reign of Henry VII., and the Statute of Labourers,
passed as late in the century as 1496 (2nd Henry VII.
c. 22), regulates the hours of work and meals by pro-
viding that “the hours of labour from March to Sep-
tember shall be from five o’clock in the morning till
seven in the evening; that one hour shall be allowed for
breakfast, an hour and a half for dinner, and half an
hour for noon-meate ; the hours of labour in winter are
from the “ springing of day ’’ to dark, and only one hour
is allowed for dinner, the extra half-hour at the meal
*Work and Wages, Rogers, p. 28.


being only allowed for sleeping, from the middle of May
to the middle of August.”*
In returning to the subject Rogers says, “ I stated in
a previous chapter that the day was one of eight hours’
work, and grounded my opinion on the fact that winter
wages were reckoned to be payable only in the months
of December and January, and from the fact that extra
hours, sometimes as many as forty-eight in the week,
are frequently paid for by the King’s agents when
hurried work was needed. These hours, of course, were
not continuous, being broken for nonschenes, dinner,
and supper in the summer, and for nonschenes and
dinner in the shorter days.”t
This is practically the sum of the writer's contention
as to the existence of an Eight-Hours’ Day during the
fifteenth century, of which, to say the least, it is am-
biguous ; and in the absence of some more convincing
proofs, I must strongly affirm my unbelief that British
workmen who have already obtained, or are still agit-
ating for the boon, are following in the wake of “ their
ancestors ”of the “ golden age.” That eight hours was
the measure of daily labour, which the toilers in labor-
ious occupations considered equitable at this or any
subsequent period of our history, few will with con-
fidence either affirm or deny. Doubtless some such
consideration, amongst others, was an incentive to handi-
craftsmen’s enrolment in those earlier organisations
which were the cradles of trades unions in the mother
land. The dream of the system by British workmen, if
such a happy illusion overshadowed them, must have had

its origin in the throbbings of the mediaeval guild-halls
before their decimation by the repressive enactments and
freebooting caprices of Henry VIII. The guilds for-
mulated many wise, provident, and philanthropic regula-
tions, such as limiting the number of apprentices in each
trade or mystery, provision for sick and mortuary
expenses of their deceased members, prices of mer-
chandise, fostering the polite arts, the dissemination of
religious principles, and protection against over-
production. They were, in fine, the safeguards against
feudalism, just as the Eight-Hours’ principle of to-day is
the citadel of modern industrial associations against
inroads which an age of invention and the perfection of
machinery is calculated to effect in the employment of
manual labour in the various processes of production and
manufacture.
To enumerate all the reforms which were initiated for
the benefit of mankind, and carried out by the guilds of
the middle ages—particularly those obtained during the
earlier portion of the fifteenth century—is not within the
province of this work ; but only the most superficial
treatment of history could have been resorted to in an
endeavour to inoculate that epoch with the germ of a
system, which ordinary analytical conclusion proves in-
contestably could have no existence in the body politic,
at least until human bondage was finally eradicated by
statute in the reign of Charles 11.
Leaving mediaeval for later times, we can trace with
tolerable accuracy the history of labour legislation, both
social and political, through storm and change. The
once powerful guilds became hotbeds of Conservatism;
the opulent oligarchy oppressed the poorer members and
elbowed them out into the mass of the brand-new demo


cracy which was growing up around them. Under the
changed conditions of these fraternities the workmen
could have no place. The natural consequences
followed. Trades unions were formed, in which the em-
ployers could have no place, and members were sworn
to secrecy. Penal enactments followed. The most
rigorous pains and penalties were connived at by the
waning guilds. Those guilds, once the pride of the
workmen, were now denounced ; overt acts of violence,
rattenings, burnings, and forcible intimidation were re-
sorted to. Then followed legal and illegal arrests, trials
by partisan judges, suborned witnesses, and packed
juries. Sentences the most odious were passed on
guilty and innocent alike ; the scaffold and the convict
ship claimed their victims; and all this in a country
from which the shadows of slavery had been dispelled,
and the sun of freedom had begun to warm the blood
of the regenerated British proletariat. There was no
Eight Hoars’ Day then —but the schoolmaster was
abroad.
We now come to the nineteenth century—the age of
reforms, adventure, enterprise, and boundless progress.
The minds and the aspirations of the people of Great
Britain are enveloped in a halo of ecstatic speculation.
Men may lift up their heads and propound doctrines for
which the pillory would at one time have been the reward
of their temerity. Thus we find Robert Owen, as early
as 1817, advertising Eight Hours as a just day’s labour
in the textile tra&e, in which he was a large manufacturer,
and although he did not live to see. the blessing light
upon the labourers of his country, he yet gave earnest of
his sincerity in that direction through being the first
employer in the trade to reduce the prevailing measure


of fourteen or fifteen hours’ labour to ten and a half,
thus preparing the way for that stupendous agitation
which the dream of an Eight Hours’ system has evoked
throughout the civilised world. In the struggle for the
nine hours’ limit, of which the late Mr. Thomas Brassey
(father of the present Governor of Victoria) was a warm
advocate, we have evidence of the awakening amongst
capitalists in England in 1853 °f that spirit of economic
foresight and even-handed justice which had already
taken root in a far-off land, as I shall presently explain.
A story is told of a conversation concerning the nine
hours’ movement between Mr. Brassey and another
large contractor in London, when the former, expressing
his opinions on the reasonableness of the demand, and
the prospective advantages that would accrue to em-
ployers by a general recognition of the nine-hours’ day,
drawn from his own experiences, where the conservation
rather than the enervation of workmen’s physical powers
was, with him, a subject of primary economic value, was
curtly replied to by an exclamation of his friend; “ Nine
hours, indeed! Only think of our yards and our
machinery standing still at four o’clock on a summer’s
afternoon !”
Meanwhile, the dream of Eight Hours drifts placidly
along.
It is now time, however, to treat of the true origin of
this great nineteenth-century reform. In the foregoing
pages I have endeavoured, syllogistically, to prove that
no evidence exists of an Eight Hours’ Day, pre-
vailing at any previous period of our history, and the
untenableness of Rogers’ contention; my premises being
that the state of the country and the divisions of society
under the various forms of government which prevailed


in Great Britain in Saxon and mediaeval epochs, were
incompatible with the conclusion of the possibility of
such a limitation.
Contemporary writers have said “ There is no magic
in the word ‘ eight,’ ” but that there is something signifi-
cant in the numeral as bearing upon the origin of the
movement, I am tempted to show.
Two circumstances of national importance occurring
simultaneously contributed in a large measure to the
realisation of the Eight Hours’ dream. One was the
disruption of the Established Church of Scotland ; the
other, the institution of the body known as “ The Chart-
ists of England.” The former embroglio was brought
about through the repugnance of the good people of
Aughterard, in Scotland, refusing to receive the nominee
pastor of their patron, Lord Kinnoul, in 1838, on which
occasion they declared their independence by resenting
the finding of eight judges, who insisted on the hereditary
right of their peer to nominate without question whom-
soever he chose, despite the will of the parishioners.
The latter, in the same year, promulgated “ the
people's charter” in the eighth month, and foremost
among the agitators are the names of eight men, viz ,
William Lovett, Daniel O’Connell, Joseph Hume, with
Bowring, Roebuck, Wakely, Thompson, and Crawford,
all of whom, with the exception of Lovett, were members
of the House of Commons.
Among the tenets of their gospel was the spectacle of
eight rotten boroughs with an aggregate population of
less than 24,000, returning sixteen members to the
House of Commons, while the great metropolis of Lon-
don, with 2,000,000 of freemen, had only the same repre-
sentation.


Lovett, who was a poor journeyman cabinet maker,
drafted the memorable “six points” which O’Connell
put into practical shape—universal suffrage, voting by
ballot, annual parliaments, equal electoral districts, no
property qualification of representatives, and payment of
members for their services.
The conspirators met and grumbled—they can grumble
in London—and they taught others to grumble, and
think, and act. The London Working Men’s Association
(which was established in 1836) produced a host of
grumblers between 1838-42. Meetings were held at the
“ Crown and Anchor ” in the Strand, at Finsbury
Square, and at the “ Bull Ring ” in Birmingham, and
stirring addresses deli vered by the leaders of the new move-
ment. Feargus O’Connor, John Collins, Wm. Lovett,
J. Bronteene O’Brien, Thomas Cooper, and the dashing
young orator, Henry Vincent, plied the people’s ear with
the interrogatory, “ Does the reformed House of Com-
mons represent the people of Great Britain and Ireland ? ”
While this question was being agitated in the modern
Babylon, the non-intrusionists of the Free Kirk in the
north had shaken the dust from their shoes on the
threshhold of the old Establishment and followed Drs.
Chalmers, Welsh, and Burns from the Presbytery of
Aughterard to the forum of public opinion, and demanded
an answer to another question, which, since that time,
has perplexed the plutocracy of many lands, viz.,
“ Whether the people are the legitimate source of all
power ? ” In these tw 7 o schools did the pioneers of the
Eight Hours’ movement graduate, and a few years later
resolved both problems to absolute practice under genial
skies lighted by the Southern Cross.
On the 12th May, 1839, the barque Tory spread her


white wings to the breeze and sailed from the port of
Plymouth with the first expedition destined for the colo-
nisation of New Zealand. The voyagers, who were
under the personal charge of Colonel E. G. Wake-
field, were empowered by the promoters (of whom Lord
Durham was chairman) to treat with the natives for
land, make all necessary surveys, and generally to carry
out a scheme of systematic settlement. * These pro-
moters subsequently obtained a charter from the Im-
perial Government, and were then consolidated under the
title of “ The New Zealand Company.”
The Aurora arrived on the 22nd January, 1840, with
the first batch of “ emigrants ” from Great Britain, and
seven days later, Captain Hobson landed and soon after
founded settlements at Wellington, Auckland in 1840,
and New Plymouth in 1841. The province of Otago
was not settled until 1848, and then by a company which
had its origin in the representations made by some of
the non-intrusionists who accompanied Wakefield's ex-
pedition, the new company being called “ The Otago
Association.’’
This latter body obtained by purchase from the New
Zealand Company an area of 400,000 acres as a special
settlement, the terms stipulating a system of payment
extending over a number of years.
The details of the experiment in the formation of the
Otago Association were entrusted to the Rev. Thomas
Burns and a committee of laymen belonging to, or
sympathising with, the Free Church of Scotland. An
attempt to organise a body of the reformers, under the
title of the Edinburgh Association for the Colonisation
* New Zealand, which had hitherto been nominally within the jurisdic-
tion of New South Wales, was on the 16th November, 1840, proclaimed an
independent colony under the British Crown.


Scheme, was made as early as 1843, but the proceedings
languished until the early part of 1847, when meetings
were called both in Edinburgh and Glasgow, at which
were formulated the rules and regulations for the pro-
posed settlement. At these meetings it was announced
that each property at the intended colony was to consist
of a quarter acre of town allotment, ten acres of
suburban land, and fifty rural acres, which were to cost
£llO ios., or £1 per acre. Priority of selection was
determined by priority of application. Three-eighths of
the money realised was to be spent in emigration, two-
eighths on roads, one-eighth on religion and education, and
two-eighths went to the New Zealand Company in pay-
ment of purchase money
Stringent provisions were made for the building of
churches and schools, as also against all forms of Sunday
labour, and finally the institution of an Eight Hours'
working day. It was found, however, that the latter
clause would be inoperative, as contracts to bind free
settlers to serve under any conditions of labour beyond
the seas was not provided for by any Imperial statute.
The clause, although tacitly agreed to by both parties
to the contract, was not therefore embodied in the
original documents.
The pioneer ship, John Wickliffe, with the first settlers for
Otago, sailed from Greenock on the 23rd November, 1847,
and arrived on the 23rd March the following year. Only
ninety emigrants came by this vessel, including Captain
William Cargill, late of the. 74th Regiment, an old
Peninsular veteran, as resident superintendent, and Mr.
C. Kettle as chief surveyor of the settlement.
The Philip Laing, with 326 emigrants, speedily
followed, arriving off Otago on the nth April, to which


Captain Cargill had already given the name- of “ Port
Chalmers,” in honour of the founder of the Free Kirk of
Scotland, and who also named the site selected for the
township “ Dunedin ” —the Celtic name of Edinburgh,
and denominated the settlers “ The Pilgrim Fathers.”
The Rev. Thomas Burns also arrived by the Philip
Laing, as the first pastor to the settlement, and on
landing caused a ship’s bell to be swung from a tree on
the headland overlooking the sight of the proposed town-
ship, and which since that time has borne the name of
Bell Hill. From this eminence, amidst the sound of the
axes of the woodmen and the swish of the break saws,
as they drove through the green forest trees, the measure
of Eight Hours as the toiler's limit in the New World
first reverberated through the dense New Zealand bush
—the harbinger of those brighter days which at last
dispelled with glorious realisation—the dream of ages.
On the Sabbath, too, the bell sent forth its welcome
notes to summon those non-intrusionists to their sylvan
devotions beneath the canopy of heaven, unfettered by
the presence of patronising dictators or the rigid
doctrines of Courts of Sessions. Free as the ocean that
washed their island home, and to encircle the minister
of their own calling, and while each son of the Gael
invoked a blessing on his sturdy efforts for prosperity
and liberty in the land of the Maori, the memory of
other days came back upon him, of those days when—
Leaning upon his spear,
The lyart* veteran heard the words of God
By Cameron thundered or by Renwick poured
In gentle stream.

Like the Otago settlers, I have, in the preceding
chapter, endeavoured to clear the ground and lay the
foundations ready to receive the superstructure of my
story, designed to be more or less interesting according
to the point of sight from which it is viewed. It would
be an error to suggest, as is frequently the case, that the
■corner stone of the fabric of Eight Hours was laid solely
by Trades’ Unions.
Neither in New Zealand, where it was first practised,
nor in Victoria, which colony has maintained it inviolate


since 1856, was it the result of independent Trades Union
action. In both colonies it was brought about by that
true elixir of economic science—the virtue of mutual con-
cession. That it has not been maintained and extended
until it embraced much larger ramifications is due to the
contrary vices of obstinacy and cupidity. Nor must it
be supposed that a monopoly of these latter qualities
which appears incidental to man’s nature is possessed by
either of the two forces on whom the issues of good or
evil in the body politic so largely depend.
Purblind principles are contagious, and require skilful
treatment. There are men alive to-day who are not
adverse to bask in the popular illumination which the
solid success of nearly half a century has shed around
the acquisition of the principle, who looked askance on
the idea in the days of its promulgation. It is even
difficult to believe that the promoters of the Otago
Association were serious in the implied agreement as to
the operation of the Eight Hours’ limit —but the settlers
were.
Towards the close of 1848, attempts to subvert the
principle were being made. Surveyors and their parties,
who were the servants of the Association, were called
upon to work nine and ten hours.
This demand the settlers resisted. Agitation ensued,
but to all representations Mr. Wm. Fox, the agent of the
Association, then residing in Wellington, proved inexor-
able. In vain was it represented that the settlers
regarded the demand as an act of gross repudiation.
Acting under instructions from Mr. Fox, Captain
Cargill, the Resident, and Mr. Kettle, the surveyor to the
Association, proceeded to enforce the behest of their
employers, and posted a notice on their office door setting


forth “ that according to good old Scotch rule, ten hours
were to constitute a legal day’s work.”
This document, which was intended to be the death
knell of the system, produced a spontaneous and warm
reprisal on the part of the settlers.
A mass meeting was immediately summoned by a
hardy settler, Mr. Samuel Shaw, at which resolutions
were passed, condemnatory of the breach of faith by the
Association, and unanimously agreed to that the men
should work eight hours only, and demand their full
rates of pay under the terms and conditions upon which
the settlement was founded. A crisis now appeared
inevitable; the Association had thrown down the chal-
lenge to resolute men. Mr. Shaw became a marked in-
dividual, but he was efficiently sustained by Mr. Arthur
J. Burns, the pastor’s son, and some few others of the
more prosperous settlers, who were gradually being en-
abled to absorb some of the labour dispensed with by the
Association.
Foremost among the settlers who took an active part
in fighting the men’s battles are remembered the names
of John MTndoe, Wm. Martin, and John Hill, a cabinet-
maker, who, with a sly vein of Gaelic humour, posted a
copy of the famous document which appeared on the
office door of the Resident on the inside of his tool chest,
as a memento of an episode which threatened to cul-
minate in the first lock-out in Australasia.
Here it will be observed that no Trades Unions existed
to initiate or direct the protest of the workers against
this barefaced breach of faith.
An insidious and cunningly devised attack was being
made upon a primary condition in an honourable com-
pact—a compact ratified under the sacred name of


religion, the parties to which were of a common nation-
ality, but on the governing side philanthropy appears to
have been strongly leavened with cupidity, regardless of
plighted promises, which were rendered
“ False as dicer’s oaths,
And sweet religion a rhapsody of words.”
Ihe Association’s notice was posted on the 24th Janu-
ary, 1849, and Captain Cargill at once pursued Mr. Shaw
and his confreres with relentless rigour. Plenary powers
being vested in the veteran soldier, he determined upon
reducing to obedience the recalcitrant employes, as he
would have done in days gone by should a mutinous out-
break develop among the tartaned rank and file of the
gallant 74th.
Fortune, however, proverbially fickle, veered round to
the more numerous battalion of the non-intrusionists,
led by Mr. Shaw, the first struggle to retain posses-
sion of the dearly-prized boon being carried by the work-
men through the fortuitous arrival of an English gentle-
man by the ship Ajax.
The new comer, a Mr. Valpey, had already acquired
an extensive tract of country in the new settlement, and
arriving just as the contretemps was at its height, he
heard the case stated at the meeting called by Mr. Shaw
on the 24th February, and immediately announced his
intention of absorbing all the available labour of the dis-
trict at advanced rates of wages, and further to maintain
in its integrity the Eight Hours’ Day.
We must now leave the Scottish settlers, who may
fairly claim to be the Australasian pioneers of the Eight
Hours’ Movement, in possession of their prize and a
“ Free Kirk,” the first public building raised in the


settlement, and which was opened on ist September,
1848, and return to the Chartists.
It has been my good fortune to have met on terms of
personal intimacy many of the old Chartists in London,
and while “on tramp” through the provinces of the
United Kingdom. Here in Australia I have enjoyed the
friendship of an excellent few who carried their old
principles well to the forefront in an honest endeavour
to solve the problem of how best to secure the greatest
good to the greatest number.
Their generous and self-sacrificing characteristics,
their unswerving devotion to the reforms they advanced,
their sufferings in dungeons, their poverty, partial
successes in the Old World and triumphs in the New,
build up the story of their lives ; while cold-hearted
neglect at their decease, nameless graves—oblivion, nay
even obloquy, over their ashes is, alas! too often the
only guerdon to their memory. Someone has said that
“ the power of oratory over illiterate persons is irresist-
ible;” “ but who,’’ quoth one of the old order, and who
afterwards became the founder of the Eight Hours’
system in Victoria, “ that has heard Henry Vincent and
would not be a Chartist ?”
It is only necessary to add a few words more on this
subject. Government vengeance was wreaked on the
leaders. O’Connor, O’Brien, Lovett, Cooper, and
Collins, and many others, suffered terms of imprison-
ment in loathsome prison cells for the advocacy of the
“ six points,” five of which some few of their disciples
took a leading part in implanting in the infant constitu-
tions of the Australian Legislatures, an example which
later events have proved has not been wholly lost on
British statesmen.


The collapse of the Chartist and Complete Suffragist
movements in England created a spirit of unrest among
the more active minds of the labouring population.
Many, smarting under the ban of Government espionage
and political and social ostracism, determined to throw
off the yoke which they could no longer endure with
patience and self-respect, and fly to other lands for that
toleration and refuge which was denied to them on their
native soil. Amongst those dashing young Chartists
who then bade farewell to Britain, were some of those
whose portraits are here presented to the public
for the first time, and whose share in organising
the free institutions of the country of their adoption I
will more particularly refer to as the narrative proceeds.
The great continent of Australia at the period of these
Old World agitations, was, in the geography of British
workmen, a terra incognita.
Little was known of its history beyond its association
with the ominously significant names of Botany Bay
and Van Dieman's Land. The trend of population from
the congested labour markets of Great Britain and
Ireland was in the main westward. America counted its
new comers by tens of thousands each month.
The inspiriting airs of freedom poured forth by Henry
Russell fell on responsive ears, and scattered them broad-
cast over the prairies of the north, or hurried them
onward to participate in the wild scenes then taking
place on the gold fields of California.
It was not until the discovery of the precious metal
by Edward Hammond Hargreaves on the 12th Feb-
ruary, 1851, at Lewis Pond Creek, New South Wales,
that the stream of emigration was diverted in the direc-
tion of the great South Land. The extreme southern


district of the continent, known as Port Phillip, and
which up to this period (1851) formed a portion of New
South Wales territory, was, on the Ist July of this year,
separated from the parent settlement, and erected into
an independent colony under the title of “ Victoria.” In
this connection a strange and propitious coincidence has
to be recorded. Almost at the same hour that legisla-
tive autonomy had been proclaimed in the new colony, a
returned Californian miner named Esmond succeeded in
proving for Victoria the possession of the yellow god at
Clunes in still more accessible and abundant volume
than Hargreaves developed at New South Wales.
Other rich finds speedily followed, and then set in the
enormous tide of emigration from the Old World to the
new El Dorado, where fortune beyond the dreams of
avarice awaited the sturdy adventurer, and where the
heart-burnings of social distinctions were all forgotten in
the race for the unspeakable glory of wealth. The gold
fields of Victoria were the chief magnetic power which
drew towards them the greatest stream of immigrants
from Great Britain, the continents of Europe and
America, as well as large numbers from the sister
colonies of Tasmania and New Zealand. Even the
metropolis of the favoured colony was abandoned by the
greater portion of its male population, while the rising
townships throughout the settled districts around the
Australian border contributed each its contingent.
While this vast tide of humanity is pouring in from the
four winds to swell the already excited though limited
population of Victoria, it will be necessary, in order to
be strictly just in the various phases which led up to the
Eight Hours’ movement in Australia, to anticipate the
arrival of the gold seekers by a few months to chronicle


an incident which had important bearings on the ques-
tion.
Great rejoicings took place in Melbourne on the nth
November, 1850, when the ship Lysander brought the
welcome tidings that Imperial sanction had been accorded
to the separation from New South Wales of the district
of Port Phillip, and which was henceforth to be recog-
nised as an independent colony.
Although some months must elapse before the proper
forms could be ratified by the New South Wales legis-
lature, the liberated colonists determined on keeping
high holiday.
On the 15th the new masonry bridge, the first per-
manent structure to span the River Yarra (although in-
complete) was declared open for public traffic by His
Honour Superintendent Latrobe.
Then followed a panorama of fetes, concerts, illumina-
tions, pastimes the most extravagant, and inconveniences,
amongst which the cessation of the issues of the daily
press and the stoppage of public conveyances, &c., which
at amy other time would be simply unendurable, were
unnoticed in the intoxicating pleasures of the festive
season.
Around a table which groaned under a menu that
would astonish a Lord Mayor of London were seated a
number of young robust British workmen. Their
bronzed and bearded faces bore evidence of exposure to
the glint of an Australian summer’s sun.
They appeared to revel with conscious pride in the
success they were celebrating, and in which they had
taken a part—that of nation-building.
The toast list is reached. “The Queen” (cheers). Her
Majesty had been pleased to accord her sanction to the


desire of the people that the infant colony should be
henceforth called by her name— Victoria.
The National Anthem is sung, Kennington Common
is forgotten; the charge of the cavalry at London
Bridge, and the bludgeoning of the people by the police
at the bull ring, under the pretence of law and order,
are buried in oblivion ; the Chartists and the Com-
plete Suffragists, with their charters and their sufferings,
are passed over; sufficient’s the day, &c. Send round
the wine. “ The Day we Celebrate." Cheers echo again
and again. The next toast —“ The Builder of Princes
Bridge,” Mr. David Lennox, one of Victoria’s first con-
tractors, and one of her best. Songs and speeches and
a final quaint toast proposed by a quaint-looking indivi-
dual, although in the prime of life—“ Success to Blue-
stone.” *
Ridiculous as the flippant vagary appeared, it was
seriously responded to by a man of muscular proportions
and an intelligent presence. The speaker, who evidently
was no mean authority upon the merits of building
material, prophesied the construction of Victoria’s new
Parliament Houses, railways, bonded and free stores,
mills, warehouses, and the thousand other purposes
which the native product would be made to serve in the
immediate future of the embryo colony, and from which
the horney-handed stonecutters of Victoria would draw
the reward of honest toil. The proposer was the late
Mr. Samuel Ramsden, the well-known miller, than
whom, in later years a more bitter opponent of the
Eight Hours did not live, and the response was delivered
* The material used in the construction of Princes Bridge, since removed
and replaced by the present structure.


by Mr. Thomas Smith, a foreman mason, and the
founder of the first regular Australian Trades’ Union.
This festivity, which was presided over by Mr. J.
Cowperthwaite, was a banquet of the operative stone
masons of Melbourne, in honour of the dual celebration
of the opening of Princes’ Bridge, and the glad tidings
brought by the Lysander, and was held at the Exchange
Hotel, in Collins-street, which then covered the site now
occupied by that ornate structure, the Bank of New
South Wales. The immediate result of the reunion was
the formation of the first Operative Masons’ Society in
Victoria, which was opened on the 16th November, 1850,
twenty-five members being enrolled, with Mr. Thomas
Smith as President; Joseph Healey,Treasurer; and Alec.
Campbell as Secretary. This Society, the precursor of
all the labour organisations of Australasia, holds also the
primary place of honour in the establishment of the
Eight Hours’ system in Victoria.*
The rush to the goldfields which set in towards the
close of 1851 threw all other schemes of industrial en-
terprise out of joint.
Colonists, however, who had already passed some
years in the building up of homes and had invested their
capital according to their means in various pursuits—
* I am aware that in making this statement I open up debatable ground.
A confusion of ideas seems to exist as to what may be termed the “ source of
a system.” In this contention I have always maintained that the fountain
head of any organisation is that nucleus which has itself grown and survived
sufficiently long to produce a continuity of similar elements to itself in the
plane of evolution. If this hypothesis be correct, then the Operative Masons’
Society of Victoria, which can produce an unbroken record of association
since 1850, and from which, on the establishment of the Eight Hours’ system
in 1856, all other Labour Unions have succeeded, may unequivocally claim to
be the parent of the Trades Unions of Australasia. It is equally absurd for
other bodies whose existence was ephemeral to claim precedence of the
Masons, as for some otherwise worthy individuals to call themselves “ Eight
Hours’ Pioneers,” whose only title to that distinction consists in the fact that
they happened to be alive at the time it was achieved without their aid. As
well might nineteenth century folk call themselves Roundheads because they
have seen Oliver Cromwell—in the waxworks.


some questionable, some estimable—which they calcu-
lated would return them a profit on their outlay, were at
first sceptical and loth to forego the reward of that virtue
which they called “thrift.” Mistaken monosyllable!
how many sophisms are connected with that indefinite
phrase ! Meantime ship after ship pour their thousands
a week from every clime on the golden shores. The
immigrants come prepared to “ rough it.” The miner’s
pick and shovel, a tin dish, a billy can, a couple of days’
supply of food, the almost inevitable pipe, tobacco, and
a good stock of lucifers, and the new chums immediately
present the back seams of their hose to the apostles of
“ thrift ” in Melbourne, and are soon lost to sight as they
plunge into the dense wilderness beyond on their way to
the interior.
The year 1852 opened and closed in the midst of the
wildest excitement. Lucky diggers began to return,
having made “ their pile,” and many immediately took
ship for the Old World. The gold fever had now irresist-
ibly set in. Mechanics in Melbourne dropped their
tools and fled to the diggings. The Burra Burra
copper mines of South Australia were abandoned;
Adelaide was fast becoming a deserted city. Our early
friends of the Free Kirk settlement in Dunedin heard
the knell of their prized Eight Hours from the vessel's
deck at Port Chalmers, as her prow was turned to breast
the foam of the Pacific on their way to the land within
whose bosom reposed the ore from which is forged—
“ The master-key of human hearts. ”
It will not, therefore, be matter for surprise that with
the exodus of all classes of workmen from Melbourne
that the pioneer Society of Operative Masons suffered a
temporary check, but although the greater number of its


members betook themselves to the goldfields, yet the
Society was not abandoned. Its meetings, through
diminished attendances, were adjourned sine die, and its
effects, books, and funds placed in charge of Mr. Thomas
Smith, who retained possession of the properties until
the resumption of the meetings of the members at a
later period.
It would be idle to assume that the Eight Hours’
movement, which had taken root in New Zealand three
years previously, was an unopened book among the
workingmen of Melbourne in 1852. There are some,
even amongst the survivors of the Victorian movement,
who appear to have forgotten the circumstances, and
whose memory will, I am sure, be refreshed by the
narrative of facts I here reproduce, all of which I have
verified on the most unimpeachable authority.
That no recorded movement for Eight Hours took
place in Victoria before 1856 was, I am convinced,
solely due to the unsettled state of society consequent on
the breaking out of the goldfields, and the inpouring of
population of diverse nationalities and susceptibilities,
rendering common action on any other question than gold-
getting temporarily futile. The Eight Hours’ move-
ment was therefore only in abeyance.
Ballarat is a native name, and defined by the aboriginals
of Victoria as “a resting place.” Whether for the quick
or dead scions of the dusky race is a point I fear must be
consigned to the atmosphere of tradition. Disturbed at
length from its primeval solitude by the intrusion of a
vast horde of toilers, the hills and valleys rung with the
clanging sounds of labour’s sway.
Thither journeyed during the years 1852-3-4, in a con-
fused and continuous cavalcade, a heterogeneous mass of


humanity—Britons, Americans, Teutons, Scandinavians,
Franks, Jews, Chinese and Turks, together with a host
of runaway sailors and a few of the soldiers “ wot
skipped.”
The resting place was soon dotted with innumerable
tents, and beyond these the surface was broken in a
thousand excavations, the rude bush windlass and bucket,
the rush to the creek to pan out, the manufacture of
“ cradles,” the construction of dams, erection of stoves,
the lucky find, and the daily arrivals of fresh contingents
to the charmed field, all produced a saturnalia of excite-
ment probably without a parallel in the world’s history.
The arrivals included a fair infusion of those agitators
who had already taken a part in some of those episodes
in the old land to which I have already alluded. They
carried their principles with them in their swags to the
new. To teach the people of England to be discontented
under any system of Government persecution was with
them a cardinal virtue. That the instincts of persecu-
tion should be hereditary under a modified form of ad-
ministration was to them intolerable. They fled from
it in the north, only to find the hideous monstrosity
incubating in the south. Alas ! bad advisers and mis-
taken principles, added to an insane reliance on the pos-
session of coercive power, have sent more than one of
our early administrators to premature graves. “Un-
happy is the man who chooses a nation for his antagonist.”
The first grievances which beset the early diggers’ life
on the gold fields was the imposition of extortionate
charges for a licence to break ground, accompanied by
a terrorising system of enforcement by Government
officials and police.
At first the ordinance was received with some sort of


good-humoured banter, but soon collisions occurred
between the officers of the law and the people. Arbitrary
arrests succeeded. Summary convictions, men chained
to trees, indignities the most brutal were practised under
the name of law, until the people were goaded into
insurrection. Fortunately for the country—unhappily
for the victims —the old organising elements were present
in good force. Not a few of the veterans who, in the
early “ thirties,” at Birmingham, sung “ The Gathering
of the Unions,”* and with uncovered heads registered,
as with one voice, amid a concourse of 300,000, the
Reform Oath—“ With unbroken faith, through every
peril and privation, we here devote ourselves and our
children to our country’s cause”—had come to Victoria,.
The discontented diggers, led by a brave, warmhearted,
Irish gentleman,! resolved on overt resistance. A mass
meeting was held beneath the constellation of the
Southern Cross on the evening of the 30th November,
1854, when the first Australian Reform League was
launched with terrible purpose. A huge fire threw a
lurid glare on the resolute faces of a large gathering of
determined men. An oath was administered, the
Government licences were tossed into the flames that
curled ominously upward against the midnight sky,
the standard of revolt was unfurled, the rebels
retired to their entrenched camp, which they called
the “ Eureka Stockade,” and three days later, on
the memorable Sunday morning (3rd December,

wards lived to occupy for some years the Speaker’s chair in the Legislative
Assembly of Victoria.

regular soldiery and the police, sealed with their
blood their devotion to the inalienable right of British
freemen to be governed only by laws made by the people
and for the people.
The charter which had been denied to the agitators
in England was soon after carried by them in Victoria,
and with it the acquisition of “The Eight Hours’
System.”

CARPENTER, PRESIDENT OF THE INAUGURAL COMMITTEE
OF THE EIGHT HOURS' SYSTEM IN VICTORIA, 1856.

sheep are immaturely shorn and then turned adrift into
the bush, where they are eaten by the natives, instead of
kangaroo, or else torn to pieces by the enormous hordes
of wild dogs which infest the inhospitable interior. For
the same reason whole hordes of cattle are frequently
slaughtered for their hides and tallow, while the parched
vegetation becomes veritable tinder, on which the sun’s
rays, through the medium of a piece of broken glass,
carelessly strewn upon the ground, will ignite and spread
devastation over the once smiling homesteads of the
settlers. Some such contingency took place north of
the River Murray in New South Wales, towards the
close of the “ forties,” and at a time when a rapid in-
crease in population was becoming hourly manifest,
inducing excessive speculation in imports, for which it
became imperative to find cash payment, in lieu of the
ordinary trade exchange, which was paralysed by the
unfortunate visitation known to the Australian pas-
toralist and merchant as—the drought.*
Coincident with the disaster the whaleing and sealing
industry in the Southern Ocean, which at one time
promised to be reckoned among our staple sources of
export, suffered an almost complete collapse, through
the competition of the New Zealand maritime rovers,
who, being located right in the very heart of the whaling
grounds, became formidable rivals in the trade, and
caused a falling-off of income to New South Wales from
£”224,000 a few years previous, to £”29,000 in 1849, from
* In 1849 the quantity of rain registered as having fallen in New South
Wales was only 21*485 inches for the whole year, or barely one-half of the
®*nirnum annual fall of the seven previous years ; while the district of Port
for the same year registered a total rainfall of inches. The amount
of live stock depending more or less upon pasture at this period in New South
Wales and Port Phillip being, in round numbers, 28,000,000 sheep, 1,500,000
head of horned cattle, and 30,006 horses.


this source alone. If anything were needed to intensify
the gloomy picture of this epoch, it was the commercial
crisis which had simultaneously taken place in the old
land; bills otherwise renewable were called up, and no
money to meet them. Squatters were unable to dis-
charge their responsibilities to the Crown in payment of
pastoral rents. Meanwhile the Colonial Treasurer was at
his wit’s end, with a depleted exchequer and the accruing
liabilities of the State, payment of public service,
salaries of the military and civil staff in the Imperial
service, which as a legacy had been continued to
remind us of a darker page in our history, and the
pressure of the London banking agencies for remittance
of interest on State bonds for which there was no avail-
able funds, unless by a sale of national debentures.
These were bad times. Bad, however, as they seemed,
they might have been worse but for the fortunate dis-
covery of a squatter in the Yass district, named O’Brien,
who realised the fact that sheep which would otherwise
be abandoned, or at best sold for one shilling each,
would, if boiled down, produce six shillings’ worth of
tallow, and in a country where sheep are counted by
the million, the sordid advantages of this discovery
were partially reassuring.
The principal occupations of the people at this time
were mainly in pastoral pursuits, together with those
engaged in the preparation of the staple products for
export, the importing and distributing community, and
the minor portion engaged in the few mechanical arts,
such as ship-building, brick-making, rope-making, and a
few woollen manufactures.
It is obvious that with such a state of utter prostration
in the national resources that all branches of internal


domestic trade suffered a corresponding fall; and at the
close of the year 1849, with a population of 187,000 in
New South Wales, exclusive of Port Phillip, there were
less than 5000 following occupations in the mechanical
arts.
Better times supervened, however, for New South
Wales in 1850, when, with the return of a good season,
the starting of her railways, and the intelligence being
bruited abroad that gold had been seen, even before
Hargreaves returned from California, and a prudent
decrease in imports consequent upon the glut which had
already swamped the market, enabled the infant
industries to revive and extend in a promising ratio.
In the following year the mother colony, like her now
divorced daughter Victoria, was in the throes of excite-
ment over their new-found treasure —gold.
All drawbacks were forgotten, and a new era opened
out which threw all other wealth-producing speculations
into comparative shadow.
It will, therefore, be easily conjectured that neither of
the two positions I have sketched, viz., excessive
depression, or the superlative chances of fortune, were
approved factors in the development of a social problem
of the character of the Eight Hours’ system. Indeed,
if it existed, the very appearance of such contingencies
would have been highly inimical,if not totally destructive
of its sustainment. *
Under these circumstances it may be safely asserted
that no Eight Hours’ Day existed in Australasia, except
* “ Three years later, on the discovery of our own gold, all classes of labour
abandoned the city for the goldfields. Closely following the influx of population
came immense consignments of goods; and with the exorbitant wages demanded
by workmen, manufactures in the face of these importations became impossible.”

N.S.W.).


in New Zealand, until the subsidence of the gold fever in
the year 1855, which, taken together with the increase of
population and the immense impetus given to the build-
ing trades consequent upon the raising of public edifices
in the cities of Sydney and Melbourne, reawakened the
idea in the minds of those who were destined to be its
pioneers in the great south land.
Notwithstandingtheeffortsput forthby Mr. Valpeyand
others in Otago, the settlement at Dunedin languished ;
very few emigrants being sent out after the first arrivals,
through the inability of the Association to dispose of the
land for which it was indebted under a four-years’ agree-
ment with the New Zealand Company. In the year 1851
Mr. Fox, the non-intrusionist agent, whose permanent
residence was in Wellington, the capital of the colony,
had also the mortification of beholding the seeds of the
Eight Hours’ exotic, like his native emblem—the thistle,
borne on the winds from Otago, and take root before his eyes
in the very seat of Government under the fostering care of
Mr. D.S. Parnell, who arrived in New Zealand as earlyas
1:839, probably with the first Wakefield Expedition.
By this time the New Zealand Company had met with
insurmountable difficulties, and being unable to meet its
engagements, was obliged to surrender its charter in
1852, which year also saw the close of the Otago Asso-
ciation, the rush to the Australian treasure fields, and,
as I have already indicated, the first blight on the
corporate efforts of the Presbyterian projectors to retain
as a system the Eight Hours’ Day.
Having now described the first actual steps taken of
which history is cognisant for the achievement of an
Eight Hours’ working day, and traced to Australasia
the successful, though apparently temporary, initiation of


the movement from 1848 to 1852, together with a resume
of the disturbing elements which beset its path by the
breaking out of the goldfields in New South Wales and
Victoria, we at once enter upon the new era of the rise
and progress of all classes of mechanical arts, which as
a natural corollary took place on the influx of popula-
tion. Not only the building trades, the wages in which
speedily rose to thirty-five shillings per day, but in all
the other branches of industry, a demand set in which
for a time baffles description. The magic of a digger’s
chance of instantaneous fortune attracted by far the
greatest proportion of arrivals from other countries to
the gold fields. There were, however, a speculative
minority who remained in the cities by the sea-board
and ministered to the necessities of the gold-seekers,
and to whom the prevailing high rates of wages and the
more rational conditions of centralisation were alike
congenial and profitable. Shipbuilders, coachbuilders,
jewellers, harness-makers, blacksmiths, coopers, brewers,
printers, butchers, brickmakers, and roadmakers were
at a premium. The market for the distribution of
clothing, boots and shoes, tools, preserved food stocks, &c.,
still remained in the hands of the merchants, who shared
with the shipping companies the rich harvest of the
period. Of the latter, the old Black Ball, the White
Star, and Green’s lines of clipper-built ships were the
principal competitors, while to and fro a fleet of
“tramp” ships, freighted with hardy adventurers,
studded the ocean, driving onward in the break-neck
race of Mammon. Amongst these “tramps,” arrived
at the port of Melbourne on the 17th of July, 1855, the
barque Elizabeth, bringing to Victoria James Stephens, a


working stonemason, the destined Founder of the
Eight Hours’ System.
In the following month, by the ship Calphurnia, arrived
Thomas Walter Vine, a carpenter, and in the month of
January, 1855, the good ship Shand, from Plymouth,
anchored in Portland Bay, Victoria, and from whose
deck two more of the future pioneers of the Eight
Hours’ Charter first set foot on Australian soil; these
being James Gilvray Galloway, a Scotch stonemason, and
Benjamin Douglass, a plasterer, who hailed from the
romantic “wealds of Kent.” It would be altogether
beyond the limit of the reader’s patience, or the neces-
sities of this work, to detail the names and circum-
stances under which numerous other “ agitators ” arrived
either in New South Wales or Victoria during the early
“ fifties.” It may, however, be interesting to point out
that, although the places of their nativities were scattered
over various parts of the United Kingdom, nearly every
man amongst them graduated in that university of overt
conspiracies and political ferment—London.
True to their instincts, no doubt need be entertained
that they endeavoured to emulate the hatchings of their
forerunners of the Free Kirk, while on the long three or
four months’ voyage from England to the antipodes.
Life on an emigrant ship in those days was an event
which neither time nor change can ever efface from the
memory.
A passenger list of from six hundred to a thousand
was not uncommon in these floating communities, which
was regulated by distinction of class and sympathies,
marked as in the purlieus of the shore aristocracy with
the bordering proletariat. The games, the speculations,
the uncertain future, the vanished hopes and vain regrets,


the dream of sudden prosperity and speedy return to the
dear ones left behind ; or the gloomy forebodings of one’s
bones whitening in the trackless Australian bush—Bah !
a song—A fair wind sprung up. “ Stand by the main
sheets there.” The sailors callout, “ Now. my hearties,
this is Melbourne rope.” Haul away, singing—
“ Away to the land of gold,
Away to the land of gold,
Crowd on all sail and bear away,
Away to the land of gold.”
The arrival in port soon dispelled whatever sentiment
idleness on shipboard may have engendered, and the
stern realities of life in a new country have now to be
encountered.
Thomas Walter Vine, with several of the emigrants
who had already decided on their struggle with destiny,
soon placed distance between themselves and the sand
hummocks of Port Phillip, and found themselves
amid the pandoric excitement and the Bacchanalian
debaucheries of a digger’s life. Here in many of the little
coteries that gathered by the camp fire at night-time, or
in the rude places of recreation, which, in those days,
the goldfields boasted of, were schemes formulated which
became more and more in antagonism with the embryo
form of government and administration then existing.
How many a prim London mechanic, a Scotch ship-
wright, a Welsh miner, and an Irish refugee grumbled
in chorus at these nocturnal conclaves ! And having now
eschewed all other forms of gaining a livelihood for the
abandon of the auriferous hills and gullies of the south,
they pledged unalterable fidelity to each other, as the grey
beards in the deep leads of old Ballarat and Bendigo can
tell. Verily a new diggings, not less than adversity,
brings about strange companionships.


We must now leave our Victorian gold-seekers to their
conspiracies, and their passage through their baptism of
fire at the Eureka Stockade, and take another glance at
the mother colony, who, being now disentangled from “her
undutiful daughter,” as the late Sir John Robertson
designated Victoria to the writer of these pages, and
pursue our quest of the Eight Hours’ movement, which
had up to the present been in Australia what it had
hitherto been in England—a dream.
More settled conditions prevailed in 1855, through the
better distribution of the population; wages became
easier, and a more intelligent application to the various
arts of production was everywhere to be observed.
A few trades’ organisations began to be formed, and
foremost amongst these, as appears their wont, was
that of the Operative Stonemasons’ Society of New
South Wales.
The lodge, as a meeting of the Society is technically
called, met at the Parramatta Hotel, Sydney, and in-
cluded on its roll some “ tramps ” from Victoria. One
of the first questions dealt with was the hours of labour,
which were then practically undefined by either code or
usage, ten hours per day, or from fifty-four to fifty-six
per week, being the prevailing measure in Sydney. The
time being opportune, the Eight Hours’ question was
debated in the lodge and on the works, building opera-
tions being rife in the capital and suburbs.
It was not, however, without some misgiving, even in
the prosperous state of trade, that a member named
Hugh Laundry proposed, at a meeting held on the 22nd
September, 1855, “ That in the opinion of this Society
Eight Hours should be the maximum of a day’s labour.”
The motion was seconded by Thomas Eaves, who subse


quently took a leading part as a representative of the
masons of Victoria in many another important move-
ment.
The motion was declared carried unanimously, and
thus the first blow against the old long-hour system had
been struck within the continent of Australia.* It was
further resolved to wait upon the employers in the
building trade and request their concurrence.
At this stage I have to express regret that a lax
system of organisation seems to have prevailed in the
colony, and in consequence of which the names and
records of those New South Wales employers and work-
men who were gifted with that prudent foresight to
perceive where a reform can be agreed upon without
loss of dignity or means to either, and act upon
that conviction, are not available to the chronicler of
these events. Amongst the latter, it would be unjust to
pass over the names of Mr. T. Barter, now, I believe, a
resident of Victoria, and Mr. W. Burgess.
Sufficient, however, that almost all the contractors in
the eastern metropolis at once conceded the boon, the
principal opposition to the measure coming from Messrs.
Tooths Bros., then engaged in the building of the
Parramatta-street Brewery.
From these works, therefore, the Masons’ Society with-
drew its members, the greater portion of whom were
immediately absorbed by Mr. Reynolds, the contractor
* For the information of our English and foreign readers I may be pardoned
for suggesting that “Australasia” includes New Zealand, Tasmania, and the
adjacent islands in the Southern Ocean, as contra-distinguished from “Aus-
tralia,” which is the continent proper. I should not have thought this
geographical note necessary, but having occasion to observe some years ago a
rare specimen of profound official ignorance of the sub-divisions of Australia, in

for the new Parramatta waterworks, and in less than a
fortnight all opposition was withdrawn by the employers
of Sydney, and the Eight Hours, as far as this branch
of industry is concerned, was won by the Operative
Stonemasons' Society of New South Wales.
On the sth of February of the same year (1855), their
brother craftsmen, the masons of Victoria, whose Society
it will be remembered adjourned indefinitely in 1851, on
the breaking out of the goldfields, renewed active oper-
ations, many of the former members returning dis-
appointed from the diggings, vigorously commenced the
work of resuscitation, the demand for labour in the
building trades at this time being animated and profit-
able.
Although in this treatise I do not intend to deviate from
the purpose of the work by describing the formation of
Trades’ Unions in Australasia, I find it necessary to tempor-
arily depart from that resolve in the case of the Masons’
Society of Victoria, because it bears primarily on the
origin of the Eight Hours’ system. In the solution of
the question, “ Who, or what body, deserves the credit
of the origin of the Eight Hours’ system ?” I shall
endeavour by the light of impartial, indeed the only
testimony, which over thirty years’ acquaintance with
the greater number of the actors in the scenes I describe
can effect, and such oral and documentary evidence
which they have placed at my disposal, and aided in a
large measure by the public press, to place the readers
in many lands in a position to judge for themselves. To
return to the Masons. Tom Smith, the first President, in
1850-1, on a requisition from the returned members
being presented to him, handed over the books, cash,
and other properties, which had remained during the


gold-fever interregnum in his possession, to Edward
Gallett and George Sparkes, the Society’s deputies.
As it is sometimes said that the history of a country
is read in the lives of its great men, so also is the
correction of internal abuses existing in communities a
reflex of the character of the men who launched the frail
barque of social reform on the vacillating and uncertain
tide of public opinion.
Innumerable pictures are every day presented of such
men, and a few portraits of these will be found in
this work.
James Stephens, the second son of an operative stone-
mason of the same name, was born at Chepstow, South
Wales, on the River Wye, in the year 1821, and at an
early age adopted his father’s trade, which he followed
ever after through life. In 1839, while slowly recovering
from a severe crushing, the effects of a fall from scaffolding
on which he was working (falling a distance of thirty
feet to the ground), he was induced to join the Masons’
Society in Newport, where he first heard the name of
Chartism associated with the glowing eulogy bestowed
on its brilliant young apostle Henry Vincent.
Returning convalescence enabled him to attend one of
these aggregate meetings, at which Vincent harangued
the hardy mountaineers. The mind of youth is
eminently receptive at the age of eighteen. Stephens
listened and was captivated ; he immediately added his
name to the roll of those who stood beneath the banner
of the “ six points,” and drank deep of the fountain
from which flowed the stream of political discontent.
The Newport riots succeeded, in which he got severely
handled, but narrowly escaping capture, he fled to
London, in order to be closer to the great heart of the


agitation. Here Stephens became acquainted with
Lovett, Cooper, O’Connor, O'Brien, and other leaders
who were at this time fevering the blood of the British
people from John o’Groats to Land’s End.
Pursuing his trade, he obtained work at Windsor
Castle, but was speedily obliged to leave the royal precincts
on its becoming known he was a Chartist. Returning to
London, we find him at the building of the new Houses
of Parliament at Westminster, where the irony of fate
chanced to roll together over two hundred masons, every
man of whom was a Chartist, and subsequently in their
company Stephens assisted to carry the great petition
and Charter, with its one million two hundred thousand
signatures, from Kennington to the tables of the House
of Commons. Stephens’ subsequent career in the
metropolis, as one of the leading agitators for the four
o’clock movement, and his organisation against its in-
fringement by Mr. Miers, the builder of some of the
principal ecclesiastical edifices in Great Britain, and
his management of the masons while still a youth, pre-
siding over 1200 experienced craftsmen, is sufficient to
indicate the character of the reforms which this pre-
cocious young Welshman charged himself to achieve in
after years beyond the seas.
Of the life of Thomas Walter Vine more might be
written than of any other of the pioneers whom it has
been my good fortune to meet, did space permit. Born
at Peerless-road, City-road, London, in the year 1796,
in those days of seething agitation in England, wdtich
had its origin in the scenes of blood which were enacted
on the other side of the channel, and while the trials
for “ constructive treason ” at home was the salad of


the political beanfeasts * with which the working classes
of England regaled themselves, and nourished the
intellects of their progeny.
These were the days of Horne Tooke, Thelwell,
Hardy, Kyd, Holcraft, and their champion, Erskine,
who battered down the intolerance of Government
interference with the liberty of free people to express
resentment against wrongs, and the publication of those
wrongs which, he convinced the people of England, was
the true safety valve of a well-regulated constitution.
. Young Vine, in due course, became a carpenter, and
at an early age entered the service of the Royal Navy,
in which capacity he saw some stirring events during
some years while engaged in the suppression of the
slave trade in the China Seas. His final experience in
the maintenance of Britain’s supremacy on the main,
was on board one of the guard ships stationed off the
coast of St. Helena during the period of Napoleon’s
captivity, until that martyr of soaring ambition to
universal empire looked out for the last time from the
heights of Longwood over those waters, across whose
surface he was ultimately borne to his tomb in La Belle
France.
In later years, on leaving the Navy, Vine became the
compatriot of John Cartwright, William Cobbett, Daniel
O’Connell, and the leaders in the Reform movement of
1832. The passage of this Bill he had the satisfaction
°f witnessing, and soon after joined the very men who

and to whom I am indebted for some of the interesting
reminiscences of the early movements of Eight Hours
in Dunedin and Melbourne, it is due to his father’s
memory to acknowledge the fidelity with which he
seconded the veteran’s efforts for a glorious inaugura-
tion, and under his instructions conducted the official
duties of Secretary to the first of these monster caval-
cades, which annually proclaim the success of the
system.
It is further due to himself to add that while he
remained in Victoria he watched over with anxious
solicitude the growth and expansion of the prize he had
helped to call into existence ; while, even now, as the
broad Pacific divides him from those halcyon days of
his youth, he still takes a deep interest in all that con-
cerns the story of the Eight Hours, as depicted by
various writers in many lands.
As I have already indicated, the resuscitated Masons’
Society began their usual fortnightly meetings for the
regulation of trade questions, the lodge being held at
Supreme Court Hotel, at the corner of Latrobe and
Russell-streets, Melbourne. A large roll was soon in
evidence, and amongst the first questions discussed was
that of sub-contracting, and the extension of the Society
by branch lodges being opened in the suburbs. In order
to give effect to this determination the office of Corres-
ponding Secretary was established, and to this was
appointed James Gilvray Galloway. On the 4th Feb-
ruary, 1856, a branch was opened at Clark's Hotel (now
Mac’s), Smith-street, Collingwood, James Stephens and
Galloway attending as representatives of the parent
lodge, for the purpose of inauguration, Andrew Brown
being elected Chairman and George Sparkes Secretary.


Here it was, and on this occasion, that the first
Victorian movement for the Eight Hours’ Day was
initiated by James Stephens. On the following meeting
night, 18th February, Stephens again attended, well
prepared with compendious notes and statistics, which
in the course of his address to the members of the new
lodge he freely used, particular reference being
made to Dr. Cummins’ lectures on the short-hour move-
ment, delivered at Crown Court, London, and at which
Stephens was a constant visitor.
The transplanted Chartist carried his point with the
new lodge, a committee being appointed, consisting of
the Chairman (Andrew Brown), Jephthah Freeman, and
John Gration, of the Collingwood branch ; with James
Stephens, James Galloway, and William Duncan as
the delegates from the Melbourne lodge. The news of
the contemplated movement spread rapidly, and the
other branches of the building trade were not slow to
emulate the example of the masons. On the ist March
the bricklayers held a meeting, and resolved to throw
in their lot with the masons in the agitation.
On the sth of the same month a conference of the
masons’ delegates was held at the St. Lawrence Hotel,
Gertrude-street, Fitzroy (since demolished), and subse-
quently at the Belvidere Hotel, on the Eastern Hill,
where the following resolutions were passed: —
ist. “ That it is the opinion of this meeting that a reduction of
the hours of labour would be greatly beneficial to the trade, and
also tend to improve our social and moral condition, and that this
meeting pledges itself to use every lawful endeavour to bring about
so desirable a result.”
2nd. " That it is the opinion of this meeting that, to carry the
foregoing resolution into effect, it is indispensably necessary that
we be in a perfectly organised condition.”
3rd. “That twelve members be elected to carryout the above
°hject.”


Agreeable to this latter the following were duly
elected:—James Stephens, James Galloway, William
Duncan, Eustace Farr, Jephthah Freeman, David
Halliday, Thomas Murray, Isaac Corben, James
Backhouse, Alexander Todd, Joseph Garrett, and
George Sparkes. To this list the names of John Gration,
Thomas Smith, and Alexander Kerr were added, and
thus was formed the first Executive of the Eight Hours’
system. Subsequently, and before the 21st April, 1856,
other sections of the building trade elected and sent
representatives to act on this Committee, and these
bodies took part in the proceedings of that memorable
day. Others followed at intervals after that date ;
but it must be evident that none other than those

ANY CLAIM TO THE TITLE OF PIONEERS OF THE EIGHT
Hours’ system.
On Wednesday, 12th March, the delegates met the
employers, who had been previously interviewed in an
informal manner by a triumvirate, consisting of Stephens,
Murray, and Farr. The meeting was held at Keely's Hotel,
corner of Spring and Lonsdale streets, Melbourne.
The employers who took principal part in the
discussion were Mr. David Mitchell, Mr. Walter Bell,
and Mr. Abraham Linacre, A lapse of forty years

reader, however interesting the recital might be to the
participants in these early, and as current history shows,
not unimportant events.
Setting out with the proposition that this reform was
the result of a just appreciation of its value by both
employer and employed, added to what might appear a
little mild intimidation on the part of the latter,

THE EIGHT HOURS' SYSTEM IN VICTORIA, 1856.

this chapter may be brought to a close by a description
of the equitable spirit in which both parties closed the
bargain within the walls of the old Queen’s Theatre, of
Melbourne, on the 26th March, 1856, and from which
dates the industrial harmony that has been ever since a
marked characteristic in the relations between em-
ployers and workmen in the building trades of Victoria.*
How few there are who look beyond to-day and
dream of a historic to-morrow! Yet, within that
classic old building in Queen-street, Melbourne,
now almost in ruins, the lyric and dramatic stars
of the British stage of earlier days were wont to delight
the heterogeneous elements of humanity which chance
had brought together, and which were gradually being
resolved into that composite whole known as “ society.”
From its stage was often heard the thrilling sweetness
of Catherine Hayes, the irresistible humour of Coppin,
and the majestic intonation of the voice of poor G. V.
Brooke, who, on that last fatal voyage with his sister,
was done to death in the Bay of Biscay, whose waters
closed over the ill-fated London and her hapless freight
of noble souls.
Who among the old veterans of the “ fifties ” does not
remember being moved to tears over the woes of
“ Elmore,” or holding their sides on the way to their lodg-
ings over the eccentricities of his inimitable O’Callaghan ?
But on this veritable 26th March, 1856, was to be
enacted a “ drama of real life,” which has since then
stood the test of public opinion and merited public
approbation in one continuous run of forty years, while
it has been reproduced in other parts of the world with
* It is even now common to see many of our foremost builders and con-
tractors seated in the four-in-hand drags which convey the Pioneers to the
festival on each recurring celebration.


some sort of chequered recognition no doubt, but still
with growing approval—the more so as the simple plot
comes to be understood. The chair was occupied by
Mr. Abraham Linacre, who stood well in the front rank
of the building contractors of our early days, and whose
presence that evening in the honourable position
assigned to him, has undoubtedly committed his name
to posterity with the proud title of one of the Pioneers of
the great social achievement of the Eight Hours’ system.
An immense concourse greeted him on rising to acknow-
ledge the honour the meeting had conveyed in their
selection of him as chairman. The class which he re-
presented (the employers) recognised the great import-
ance of the demands which labour had put forth, and
as a class had well considered the issues involved.
That some slight misgiving, arising from the fact that
there were few of them gifted with the faculty of pro-
phecy, was apparent, and that some division of opinion
therefore existed, it was only natural to expect. How-
ever the two forces might agree, there existed a third
which must be regarded as the final court of appeal, and
before whom both of the former now decided to lay the
case—public opinion.
The question, “ Shall the Eight Hours’ system of
labour from henceforth prevail in the building trades of
Victoria ? ” is now before that tribunal, and as the
operative stonemasons had taken the initiative in the
momentous problem, he would call upon their represen-
tative to open the discussion. While acclamations rang
throughout the densely packed building, forward strode
young James Galloway, the Scotch stonemason, and
Corresponding Secretary to his trade, and whose serious
aspect as he faced the ordeal would suggest the idea


that the masons had selected no tirailleur with which to
feel the ground, and yet he was only in his twenty-eighth
year.
He was well received, and it was soon evident to the
audience that a man of more than ordinary force of
character, intelligence, and a keen insight into the in-
tricacies of popular debate stood before them. With
excellent precision he recounted the arguments which
had been advanced by the workmen for improved con-
ditions of existence in a new country. Where the
enervating effects of exposure during the extreme
heat of summer rendered the day of ten hours of doubt-
ful economic value, and in building up new institutions
in their infant colony, he maintained that the principles
underlying the fate and fortune of producer and con-
sumer, the employer and the workman, for weal or woe,
were identical, and precisely what the community
determined upon -without reference to the vaunted, but
much misunderstood ethical absurdity, entitled the laws
of supply and demand.
Galloway concluded an excellent speech by a fervid
appeal to the public beyond those immediately interested
to exhibit a generous sympathy for the claims of the
breadwinners to a share in the delights which accrue
from reasonable opportunities of recreation, mental
culture, and rest, and with one accord, by the seal of
their votes, to lay the foundation of the charter of Aus-
tralian workmen’s freedom. The advocate retired before
a generous outburst of enthusiasm—the arrow had hit
the mark.
The first resolution was moved by “ Tom ” Smith, as
he is familiarly called, and whose response to the


humorous toast of “ Success to Bluestone,” in the year
1850, was bearing more abundant fruit than even he
expected. It was not, however, a post-prandial speech
he was now called on to deliver.
Before him were the public, the arbiters of the fate of
the all-important measure he was about to launch;
around him, on the curiously transformed stage, were the
anxious but resolute scions of capital and labour.
With measured accents he read the following ;
“ That this meeting is of opinion that the time has arrived when
the system of eight hours per day should be introduced into the
building trades, and that the laborious nature of the trade, and
continued exposure to the excessive heat of the climate, loudly call
for such a reform,”
The motion was seconded by the whilom Chartist and
propounder of the scheme, James Stephens, and
supported by a carpenter named Best, and other
members of the building trades, some of whom have
since joined the majority, but whose names, as well as
those who are still in the flesh, will be kindly remembered,
not only on this fortieth celebration, but on all successive
anniversaries, when their disciples in the movement toast
“ The Day we Celebrate.” Their names are Jephthah
Freeman (mason), Joseph Avery (bricklayer), J. Boyd
(sawyer), T. Laver (sawyer), and A. Forsyth, a timber
merchant, who vigorously replied to an individual bearing
the half-Dutch cognomen of “ Cox,” who whined for
“moretime.” Mr. Linacre declared the motion carried
unanimously, and the “guinea stamp” of public approval
was there and then burned in indelible characters on
the new standard of Australian workmen —Eight Hours’
Labour, Eight Hours’ Recreation, Eight Hours’
Rest.*
* The origin of this motto is almost unanimously ascribed to Dr. Embling,
who weaved the historic words at a subsequent public meeting held in the same
building.


The second resolution was confided to Galloway and
Tom Smith, which set forth—
" That the foregoing principle take effect from April 2istnext.”
On this an amendment was moved, with the object of
delaying the operation of the measure for three months
instead of one. This the chairman, as one of the largest
employers of labour in the building trades, opposed, as
he considered the conferences which had been held, and
the present exposition of the question, predetermined
its early application in the event of the substantive
motion being ratified at the bar of public opinion. The
response of the audience to the motion for the adoption
of the 2 ist of April following as the natal day of labour’s
emancipation from the thraldom of “ the good old
Scotch rule,” was also unanimous and enthusiastic.
Intense manifestations of joy followed cheers for the
chairman, hundreds press forward to grasp his hand,
employers and workmen exchange congratulations.
James Stephens beholds the first fruits of that organic
system, destined to make his own name historic, and
which he intuitively gathered on the bleak mountain
side in Wales from the lips of Henry Vincent—the Eight
Hours was won !
The names of the contractors who were either present
at this meeting or the conferences which preceded it, as
far as existing records furnish, are—Mr. Abraham
Linacre, Mr. John Holtom, Mr. Walter Bell, Mr. David
Mitchell, Mr. Samuel Amess, and Mr. George Cornwell.

It will now be apparent, as I stated at the outset, that
the acquisition of the Eight Hours in New Zealand,
New South Wales, and Victoria was generally the
result of a consensus of opinion on its own merits,
emanating from all the interests concerned—the public,
the contractors or middlemen, and the workmen; the
case of New Zealand perhaps proving an exception, as
far as one of the factors to the transaction was concerned,
i.e., there being no public to consult.
No Trades’ Unions existed in New Zealand; it is
improbable there could have been more than one in New
South Wales, and one only in Victoria, both of these


latter being masons’ lodges, and in both cases their
members, instead of formulating a demand, preferred
the case in an unofficial manner to the employers, relying
rather upon the reasonableness of their claim than upon
any latent power which as Unionists they might possess
to enforce their behest by any attempt at intimidation.
The employers, on the other hand, limited in number,
were all men who had risen from the ranks of labour,
and were equally anxious with the operatives to lay the
axe at the root of old-world prejudices and abuses, while
yet the demon of ruthless, blood-imbibing competition
had not begun to unfold its hideous and contaminating
visage in the sunny south.
The time and the men were equally suited to the
■circumstances ; ten years later and the problem would
have become Utopian. To give permanence in the
earlier stages of the movement, and to stimulate its
growth into a system, it now became necessary to
organise the various sections of the building trades in
accordance with the purpose expressed at the meeting of
the 26th March.
Up to this date the masons’ was the only associated
body, and it may, therefore, be allegorically said that it
was the Adam, and the Eight Hours’ movement th e Eve,
of all other industrial associations in Victoria, as the
following facts prove. Chronologically the matter
stands thus: —
1 st March.—Society of Operative Plasterers established.
Bricklayers hold a meeting at the Belvidere Hotel, John
Spracklyn in the chair, at which it was resolved to
support the resolutions carried at the Collingwood lodge
■of masons on 18th February. (Bricklayers’ Society not
yet formed.)


sth March.—Masons’ Central Lodge remove from the
Supreme Court Hotel to the Belvidere ; hold first
meeting of lodge there, and confirm the resolutions of the
Collingwood branch re Eight Hours, on the motion of
James Stephens.
12th and 19th March. —General meetings of masons
held at Central Lodge, Belvidere Hotel.
26th March.—Great public meeting held at Queen’s
Theatre.
2nd April.—Meeting of carpenters at the Belvidere;
resolutions passed to support the action of the Masons in
the Eight Hours’ movement. (No Society yet formed.)
7th April.—Meeting of Plasterers’ Society, Archibald
Fulton in the chair, at Belvidere Hotel. Freeman
Manuel moved, “ That the Operative Plasterers of Mel-
bourne consider that eight hours per day is sufficient
time for us to work, and we pledge ourselves to carry out
this design with the utmost vigour.” (Carried). Benjamin
Douglass moved, “ That this meeting pledge itself, both
as men and employers,"' on and after the 21st inst., to
carry out the Eight Hours’ system, and to co-operate
with the other mechanics in the building trade.” Carried
unanimously. Messrs. Washington, Price, and Manuel
were appointed a deputation to meet the other trades
in conference.
Bth April.—Meeting of bricklayers, held at the
Belvidere Hotel, John Spracklyn in the chair. John
Stanton moved, “ That this meeting, being fully sensible
of the benefits of a reduction in the hours of labour,
resolves to initiate a society of operative bricklayers to
facilitate the desired objectthe motion was declared
*By this it would appear employers were represented at the meeting—
another significant fact.


carried unanimously. Joseph Gillett moved, and
Joseph Barbour seconded, “ That the society shall con-
sist of operative bricklayers, to be managed by a com-
mittee to be elected by the members who now enrol
their names, such committee to be elected forthwith
this resolution was carried and committee elected.
Samuel Storey moved, and John Bishop Griggs seconded,
“ That the committee be empowered to frame a code of
rules and submit them for approval at a meeting to be
held 15th inst.” (Carried.) Meeting of Masons’ Society
at Belvidere, Thomas Smith in the chair. James
Galloway moved, and James Stephens seconded, “ That
in the opinion of this meeting it is indispensably neces-
sary that they (the building trades) should be in a
perfectly organised condition before the 21st inst., for
the purpose of acting in concert for bringing into oper-
ation the great movement.” (Carried.) Moved by James
Stephens, and seconded by John Gration, “ That the
winter months commence on the 21st April, and the
summer months on the 21st August.” (Carried.) James
Galloway and Alexander Todd were appointed to the
Delegate Conference of the building trades.
nth April.—Great public meeting at Queen’s Theatre,
the Mayor of Melbourne, John Thomas Smith, Esq.,
presiding, when resolutions in support of the movement
were submitted before a crowded audience, and carried
amidst the greatest enthusiasm, the speakers on this
occasion being Dr. Thomas Embling, J. G. Burt, Esq.,
M.L.A., and Messrs. Joseph Osborne, Win. Taylor,
Boyd, and Robert Miller. The same pessimistic
individual, rejoicing in the semi-foreign cognomen of
“ Cox,” who appeared at the meeting on 26th March,
was announced by the chairman, and endeavoured to


interpose his gloomy forebodings, but was obliged to
retire before the badinage incidental to unpopular
orators." At this meeting the mayor expressed his
intention of offering a prize of £lO for the best essay on
the Eight Hours.
14th April.—Meeting of master slaters held at the
Birmingham Hotel, Smith-street, Collingwood, when it
was unanimously resolved that on and after 21st inst.
“ both masters and men should only work eight hours
per day.”
16th April.—The Melbourne Progressive Society of
Carpenters and Joiners, established by Thomas Walter
Vine, Charles B. Vine, and Robert Miller.
19th April.—Meeting of masters and operative slaters
held at the Olive Branch Hotel, Latrobe-street, Mr.
Dunger in the chair, when it was moved by Mr. Nelson,
and seconded by Mr. Entwisle, that the Eight Hours’
system be adopted, the masters and men leaving off at the
same hour. (Carried.) The operative slaters then formed
their Society. The painters and plumbers, acting in concert,
met at the Cross Keys Hotel, Russell-street, and resolved
to support the movement. The Coachbuilders met at
the Temperance Hall and took similar action. The
following advertisement appeared this day in the daily
press:—
Public Notices.
“ The delegates appointed by the different committees
connected with the building trades, hereby give notice
that it has been unanimously resolved at their meetings
* It was at this meeting that Dr. Enabling, in speaking to the first resolution
used the following words, “ I wish it to be prominently before the public, em-
ployed and employers, how long a man could healthily labour, and he believed
the twenty-four hours should be divided into three equal portions—one for labour,
the other for recreation, and the third for rest," Hence the motto of the Eight
Hours’ trades.


to commence the Eight Hours’ system on Monday, 21st
inst., by beginning work at 7 a.m., and leaving of at
5 p.m., deducting two hours for meals, till 23rd August
in each year, and the remaining months from 6 till 4.
The hours of meals during the winter months to be—
breakfast, from 9to 10; dinner, from 1 to 2 ; and from 8
to 9 and 12 to 1 in the summer.”*
The representatives of the various trades thus formed
into an Executive Committee comprised the follow-
ing
Masons.— James Stephens, James G. Galloway,
Alexander Todd, Thomas Smith.
Bricklayers.—John B. Griggs, John Spracklyn, John
Stanton.
Carpenters and Joiners. —Thomas Walter Vine,
Charles B. Vine, Robert Miller.
Plasterers. — Washington, Price, Benjamin
Douglass, Freeman Manuel.
Painters.—Thomas Charge, Davis,
The above also formed a Demonstration Committee,
and on which it is probable there were others still
amongst us who served, but from the loss of almost every
record, all efforts to chronicle the complete list of
names have been unavailing. The officers of this Com-
mittee were —Thomas Walter Vine (President), A.
Forsyth (Treasurer), and Charles B. Vine (Secretary).
One of the resolutions of this committee provided—
“ That the proceeds of the inaugural fete, intended to be
* it may here be mentioned that a custom prevailed under the long ten-hour
system of providing a “ spell,” or cessation of work for a quarter of an hour, at
n o’clock in the forenoon, and again at three in the afternoon, which was called
“smoko.” It was on one of these occasions, in midsummer of 1855, when the
heat was intense, that James Stephens first spoke of the Eight Hours’ system,
and which opportunities he always took advantage of until he carried the first
resolution of the principle in the Collingwood Lodge of the Masons’ Society.


held in celebration of the acquisition of the Eight Hours,
shall be equally divided between the Melbourne Hos-
pital and the Benevolent Asylum.”
In view, therefore, of this resolution, it was further
decided to invite representatives from the two institu-
tions named, and which resulted in the addition to the
committee of the two Secretaries of these charities —
Mr. Grant for the Hospital and Mr. Haines for the
Benevolent Asylum, the latter also sending its Treasurer,
Mr, Tankard, of the well-known temperance hotel
bearing his name.
Enclosures for out-door amusements were few in those
days, the most accessible and popular, if indeed not the
only one, being “Cremorne ” Gardens, on the banks of
the Yarra. Here the Committee decided to hold the
opening celebration on the 21st April, but the gardens
being previously engaged for a benefit tendered to Mr.
Percival Scott, the lessee, “ under the patronage of
General M'Arthur,” that part of the programme had to
be altered. So we will leave the Committee to make
other arrangements.
The day itself has at last arrived, the glorious 21ST
APRIL, 1856.
" Vet still we love our April,
For it aids us to bequeath
A gift more fair than blossoms rare,
More sweet than budded wreath,
Our children’s tend’rest memories,
’Round Austral April grow ;
Twas the month we won our freedom, boys,
Just (fort)-) years ago.”
A prominent and brilliant young politician, in the
course of a speech at an Eight Hours’ banquet, once
said, “ The Eight Hours’ at its birth owed nothing to
Parliament, and still less to the press.” Yet the speaker


was a member of both institutions, while the writer of
that charming little measure I have quoted was also a
pressman, the lovable, warm-hearted, “ literary genius
of Australia,’’* the late Marcus Clarke. That the idyllic
sweetness of his poem (written for the Anniversary
Committee, 1876), should be a pungent sarcasm on some
pseudo prophet of his own order of a score of years
before it is probable he never dreamt —yet such it was.
At an early hour on the morning of the 21st, according to
arrangement, the now emancipated craftsmen mustered
in force, to the number of seven or eight hundred men,
at a rendezvous close to the works of the Melbourne
University, then in progress of erection.
A procession was formed, of which Thomas Glaister,
a mason, was appointed marshal. To the masons the
place of honour was assigned, and as the members of
that body who were engaged at the works of the
University, together with their spirited employer, Mr.
Linacre, formed what might be called the “key to the
historic position,” which the whole of the building
trades in common enjoyed that day, I will here chronicle
their names, as far as I have been able to learn from
amongst the survivors of that sterling body of unionists,
viz.:—William Beardall, foreman ; Glencross, time-
keeper; James Stephens, James Galloway, Jacob Ford,
Thomas Topping, Samuel Craven, George Sparkes,
David Halliday, Alexander Todd, John Yewdall, John
Stevenson, David Hughes, William Thompson, David
Clarke, and Joseph Sykes.

new Western Market buildings, had each persistently
declined to accede to the decision of their fellow-con-
tractors, the operatives, and the public, a deputation of
two from each trade was appointed to wait upon these
gentlemen on the morning of the 21st, before the pro-
cession should appear in front of their works, as an
evidence of the new order of things, and from which it
was not intended to recede. Neither contractor could be
found, so the last effort to bring the obtuse masters into
line failed. The procession, headed by the premier
society, flying a Union jack and borne by Jacob Ford,
with a small flag on which three “eights” were fashioned,
comprised all the banners and emblems displayed in this
memorable mid-day march.
The pioneers moved along Madeline and Elizabeth-
streets, calling at all buildings en route which were
observed in course of erection ; thence to the new
structure of De Graves’ Mills, of which Thomas Smith
was foreman, and continuing their course along Flinders-
street to the Western Market buildings, where the men
were discovered working, but on the sight of their
comrades in the procession they immediately threw down
their tools and joined the ranks.
Cheers were given as each new accession of strength
threw its weight into the movement. On and on the
ever-increasing pageant marched, through Little
Collins-street to the site of the new Parliament
Houses, where the augmented numbers received
their final contingent. All the men employed by

Belvidere Hotel, where the reports of the delegates, who
had failed to see Cornish and Holmes, were received, and
provision at once made for the sustainment of the
employes at these works, now idle through their inde-
pendent action. The achievement of the Eight Hours’
system to the working classes of Victoria was now com-
plete, requiring , only the indomitable spirit of the
pioneers, employers, operatives, and the public to gene-
rously recognise the true advantages of its consolidation,
undisturbed by false and fleeting ideas of economy, and
uninfluenced by cupidity and arrogance. How well these
ideas have been carried out, may the patriotic members
of the fortieth anniversary, whose names we are proud of
to-day, live long to tell.
The eventful proceedings of this inaugural day were
brought to a close by a banquet at the Belvidere, at
which Thomas Smith presided, and which was attended
by a goodly company of legislators, members of council,,
including His Worship the Mayor—since known to fame
as the Australian Whittington, in reference to the num-
ber of times he filled the civic chair of Melbourne— pro-
fessional gentlemen of all grades of society, employers,
and workmen. On the following morning the public
breakfast tables were supplied with the usual digestive
literature, amongst which a leading article in a Mel-
bourne morning newspaper was dished up hot. A few
slices will serve our appetite :
“ The Procession and Its Moral.” *
“ We dare say that in six or eight months' time we
shall read in the London papers a most exaggerated and
alarming account of the procession yesterday through the

streets of Melbourne. We are of sufficient consequence
now to have penny-a-liners stationed on the spot in the
shape of ‘ Special Correspondents,’ and we have no doubt
that they will consider the demonstration alluded to a
perfect godsend for their purpose.” . . .
“ Why, the procession must have been a scheme of
the contractors —a deep trick, intended to advertise to the
world that there is such a scarcity of workmen in Mel-
bourne that those who are here have it all their own
way; that the golden age has come at last, in which
nobody shall do more labour than amounts to pleasant
exercise ; and that we are about to establish here a
Utopian happiness, which all the strikes of Lancashire
and the bloody barricades of Paris could never con-
quer.” . . .
“ Wages were recovering themselves, provisions,
clothing, fuel, and rent were becoming cheaper, and the
working classes had a fair chance of getting on again
and keeping it all to themselves, when some stupid, mis-
chievous blockhead—the worst enemy they ever had in this
colony—set this agitation going, and the result will be that
the whole fabric of their prosperity will be blown to the
winds.”
Oh! illustrious prophet—A Daniel! The block-
heads have kept both the population and the Eight
Hours’ “ all to themselves,” and more—they assisted by
taxation for years after to enable others to come and
enjoy the fruits of their achievement, so that from a
quarter of a million of a population in 1856, we have since
increased to nearly a million and a quarter ; and yet
‘ their prosperity ” is “ blown ” by the testimony of the
press of to-day ; and amidst the waving of the newer

“ Thanks to the moderation of the contractors, and
perhaps the exigencies of the Government, the ‘ Eight
Hours’ system ’ has achieved a momentary triumph.
“ To treat the matter more seriously, we do sincerely
hope that, now the working classes have achieved their
object, they will not delude themselves with the idea
that they can long retain it, unless they can confine the

out the rest of the world from access to these shores.”

still persisting in his unholy crusade against the Eight

" How is the problem of the greatest possible amount of happi-
ness for the greatest number to be effected ?
" I will tell you. By regulating the number of hours a day a man
shall work in a day, sufficient to feed, clothe, and educate the
population, and with a due regard to the advantages in which we
should share by the introduction of labour-saving machines, we
should also prevent the pernicious tendency to over-production,

economy starts with the proposition, that labour is the source of
all wealth —that to labour we owe the food, clothes, and shelter
necessary to man Look around and see the mighty deeds that labour
has accomplished, from the time earth was a wilderness until now,
when the vine and myrtle have replaced the thistle and the briar.
" Look at the towns and cities of the earth, at the mercantile
navies breasting the billows of every sea; view the works that
labour has done, and I think you will agree with me that, after all,
the labourer is the only being worth caring about. If ever in
any country proofs existed of his value, it is in this one. Look !

“ Look at yonder city, illuminated by its magic lamps, its windows
glittering with wealth, a city with palaces worthy of kings, and
temples worthy of gods, which labour has placed there in the short
space of a quarter of a century. Twenty-five years ago, where now
the voices of the most accomplished vocalists resound, the wild howl
of the savage corrobboree or the wind in the wilderness was alone
heard, and by whom has this change been effected ? By the rich,
the wealthy, the kid-gloved, fine-handed gentry ? No; by the
horny-handed son of toil, and after all that he has done here, and
ready as he is to do more, would you have him work until his heart
breaks under the burning sun of this colony ? Yet the question upon
which depends the future happiness of these men was impugned ly some
editors of papers, who understood as much of the real merits of that
question as a sucking-calf does of Euclid’s elements.


“He trusted, however, that the time had passed away when such
men as these could come forward and dictate to them, and the voice
of the people should prevail as the voice of God.’
Although the auspicious 21st April closed amid re-
joicing, which might be considered sufficient to signalise
the event, the Demonstration Committee was not to be
baulked in the big show they had in contemplation, and
redoubled their efforts, finally resolving to hold the
inaugural fete on Whit Monday, 12th May, at the Cre-
morne Gardens. Arrangements were consequently made
with Mr. Percival Scott for the due fulfilment of the
programme which appears in another part of this work,
and which in those days was looked upon as a great
effort, the martial ardour of the race being stirred by
the mimic reproduction of the “ taking of the Malakoff ”
and the “ bombardment of Sebastopol.”
The several new societies were busily engaged making
their own arrangements, apart from the general Com-
mittee ; and one individual, possessing the most appro-
priate name of “Jack Craft,” * was driving a brisk
business.
The Belvidere at this time was an important
hostel. There were few of more striking architectural
pretensions in Melbourne, and it was scarcely finished
when, through the accident of their new combinations on
* Jack Craft was a well-known banner painter of the period- a sort of genius
in his way, and endowed with idiosyncracies, which at times caused no little
amusement. Being instructed during this year (1856) to design and execute the
decorations of the large new window of the “Albion Hotel,” Bourke-street, and
on which he was requested to embody the Australian crest, as a special feature,
he made a journey, occompanied by a friend, to the Zoological Gardens, to
sketch the kangaroo and the emu, as he had never before seen these important
factors in the Australian Arms. By the time Craft and his friend arrived at the
Gardens, conviviality had affected the artistic vision, the sketches subsequently
puzzling the artist himself. In due course the work was finished, and on the
screen, which had obscured the operator while working, being removed, it was
discovered that the proportions of the terminal appendages of the creatures had
been reversed—the emu being drawn with a graceful flowing tail of ample folds
and feathers, while the kangaroo was relegated to a stump.


the Eight Hours' question, the trades laid siege to its
capacious meeting rooms. The interval between the
21st April and the fete appointed to take place on Whit
Monday, witnessed the most enthusiastic scenes, as the
several trades carried out a generous rivalry in prepara-
tion. Nightly meetings —far into the night it is sus-
pected some sat —were held, disposing of the duties to be
allotted to each, selling tickets, preparing emblems and
banners, and the hundred and one matters which demand
attention to ensure the success of an outdoor parade.
It was late one night, all the societies had already
adjourned, when three persons were observed silently
transacting some business in the room allotted to the
Demonstration Committee. One who was seated at the
head of the large table in the centre of the room was
in appearance well past the mid-day of life ; but in the
lines of whose clean-shaven and strongly-marked face a
physiognomist would observe a firmness of character
depicted in the closely compressed lips and restless blue
eye —so frequently the index to an active mind. His
lithe but well-knit frame indicated endurance rather
than great physical strength. He was engaged append-
ing his signature to some papers, which he dashed oft
rapidly as if anxious to leave off for the night.
His companions were both young men, apparently not
more than half the age of the former. One of these, a
broad-shouldered, square-built man, with keen grey eyes
and brown hair and beard, and as far as appearances
justified the assumption, was the embodiment of mus-
cular strength. He had just risen from his seat, and
hurriedly depositing some papers in his pocket, took up
his hat and was about to retire when he was accosted by
the Secretary, whom the third party proved to be, as,


closing his portfolio, he too stood up to leave the room.
“ You might walk our way home, Jem ; it won’t be much
out of your road,” said the young scribe, “ and we could
talk over the sports programme.”
“ Eh ! what ?” said the elder one at the head of the
table ; “ you both going before we decide upon that last
resolution concerning the flag ? ” and the old man
shrugged his shoulders. “ Mind, we ll never be ready,
and a flag is not designed and made in a day.”
“Yes, but we’ve agreed to leave that matter to you,
and as I have no skill in heraldry I could be of no assist-
ance—rather in the way, I fancy.”
The accent of the speaker indicated his nationality. It
was James Galloway, the Scottish stonemason, and
Organising General Secretary of the movement.*
“ But,” he added, “ I don’t mind telling you the story
of the most historic trades banner extant, and which
might suggest something worth while copying—that is,
my dear Mr. President, if you don’t intend to sleep at
the Belvidere, which I certainly do not. You might
very well leave off now and walk along with C. B. and
myself, as they say in my country—
‘ A gaun fit is aye gettin ' ”f
“ Mr. President” was no other than Thomas Walter
Vine, the Chairman of the Demonstration Committee. He
smiled lightly as Galloway indulged in his native idiom,
and carefully placing the papers in a peculiar-looking
pocket-book, bound in white sheepskin, which he tied
with a small piece of tape for greater security, carelessly
* It is necessary to distinguish between the Organising Secretary of the
Eight Hours’ movement, James Galloway, and the Secretary of the Demonstration
Committee, C. B. Vine.
Me., a person continually walking (going) is always picking (getting)
something up.— Old Scottish Saying, t


remarked, “ This may be a memento of the past one
day. Oh, well, Jem, no matter if we are a bit late; it’s
in a good cause. I’m proud of being at its birth ; I can-
not hope to see its maturity.”
“ So far as that goes there’s no certainty for any of
us,” said Galloway.
“ Come, come,” said the younger Vine, “ no croaking.
Why, we are only bursting into a new life. Eight
Hours for ever, and a plague on the Herald ! The
miserable weed will wither and die, while the tree we
have planted will flourish in the sunshine of security.”
The three friends had now left the hotel, and were
quietly strolling, rather than hastening homewards.
Galloway had just lighted his pipe when the Chairman
addressed him:
“ And now, son of the Gael, we’ll have your story if
it’s not too long, as I’m getting tired. One reservation
only. If you expect me to adopt- your ideas of a flag,
I’m wedded to colours; I'll have nothing but nationa
colours in our glorious emblem.”
“ Thus far, and no farther, or I’ll not ‘pipe,’ as you
say on board of your British bull-dogs. You must hear
my story before you talk of design or colours,” said
Galloway, as he laid his brawny hand on the old man’s
shoulder. “Then,” he continued, “you can exercise
your own sweet will on your ‘ glorious emblem,’ as you
call it.”
“ A crown, father, it’s a Scotch yarn,” chimed in young
Vine.
“ And all the better at that,” said Galloway, and no
British standard that ever flew is fit to patch the ‘ blue
blanket of Edinburgh.’ ”


A loud laugh from his companions at this sally, in
which the speaker himself joined, had scarcely subsided
as he continued : “ An old mate of mine, named Willie
Ferguson, called on me some short time before I left
Edinburgh, and invited me to accompany him to the
Trades’ Maiden Hospital, in Argyle Square, as he had
obtained permission from the Convener of Trades to see
that old relic. He informed me it had only been once
unfurled within the last 20 years, as the remnants of the
old guilds are now scarce in the old country —the watch-
makers and jewellers, I think, being the only one sur-
viving, and as long as one guild holds together, it has
the exclusive privilege of bearing that banner to the
rallying point of the trades of Edinburgh. The flag was
originally presented to the Craft Guilds of Edinburgh
by James 111. of Scotland, in 1482, and was afterwards
renewed by his Queen —Margaret.
Some wuiters called the period “ the golden age,” but
I have never been able to tell why it was so called, for
banners in those days were not given to commemorate a
social achievement like ours, but to fight under; and
whenever that banner was unfurled, depend upon it, ’twas
not to celebrate an Eight Hours’ Day, but to bolster up
the feudal aristocracy, that kept three-fourths of the
country in serfdom.
However, it was the rallying standard of the guilds;
and under it the crafts mustered on the Borough Moor,
at the command of James IV., and from thence marched
to their destruction on the field of Flodden in 1513. The
flag, much damaged, however, was preserved by a faith-
ful few, and ultimately restored to the trades of Edin-
burgh, whose property in succession it has become, and
tradition holds to this day that it is the privilege, nay,


the imperative duty of the craftsmen of Edinburgh to
rally beneath this old flag, in the event of the liberties
of the city, the privileges of the trades, or the life of the
sovereign being in danger.”
It is uncomfortable in the last degree to tell a story
and smoke at the same time. One can't do it and give
satisfaction to one’s audience, and James Galloway was
no exception to the rule, so he allowed his pipe to go out
during the graphic recital of the foregoing, but suddenly
recollecting the forced abstinence he had observed —for
he loved his pipe—he struck another match and con-
cluded thus, “Now as to the colours of the “blue
blanket,” the name itself suggests the colours of the
“ field ” of the flag, and its “ quarterings ” are the white
saltere of St. Andrew in the upper staff corner, with a
royal crown above, and a thistle below the chevrons, and
two white scrolls or ribbons waving on its upper and
lower folds, setting forth the mandate of the craft guilds
in the quaint characters and spelling of the period, the
words being, “Fear God, honour the King with a long and
prosperous reigne,” “ and we that is tradds shall ever pray for
the defence of His sacred majestic’s royal persone till death.”
“ An historic relic truly,” said Charles Vine.
“ Ay ! but the colours, my dear Galloway,” queried the
old man, “ what did you say ? Was there no colour of
the rose anywhere about it? Blue and white only.”
“ Rose, indeed ! Ah ! ah ! ah ! Well, yes, there was
a wee bit, as far as the brush of the thistle goes ; there-
fore, my Saxon stickler, be happy, you have the colours
as you want them—red, white, and blue.”
“Oh, well,” observed Charles Vine, laughing, “ what
matter about colours ? Everybody knows you can no
more get a Scotchman away from the blue than you


could persuade a native of the Emerald Isle to abandon
the green ; so, father, you may make up your mind ; the
Caledonians will expect a blue field at least, for since
James I. of England and VI. of Scotland laid the Cross
of St. George over the saltere of St. Andrew, on the
azure field of Scotland, heraldic designers have always
kept a large pot of blue paint ready mixed in anticipa-
tion of orders from all sources whatsoever. Why, even
the ‘ heather belles ’ have sung for the last three hundred
years :
Oh, dear, what can the matter be ?
Johnnie's so long at the fair.
He promised to buy me a bunch o’ blue ribbons
To tie up my bonnie brown hair.
He promised to bring me a basket o’ posies,
A garland o’ lilies, a garland o’ roses,
And a little straw hat to set off the blue ribbons,
That tie up my bonnie brown hair.”
“ Yes, and by the piper of Ballochmyle, they’ll sing it
for three hundred years more,” said the Gallic mason.
“ But,” he continued, addressing the veteran chairman,
who appeared as if indulging in some abstract train of
thought, “ you said something last night about Peter
Lalor's flag at the Eureka Stockade. What was it like,
general ? ”
“ Strange,” replied Vine, senior, ‘‘ I was just thinking
of the coincidence as you asked me the question, It
bore some resemblance to your blue blanket, having a
blue field and a white cross, only minus the crown and
the thistle ; but it would never do, much as I revere the
first standard of Australian democracy, to copy too
closely the flag of revolt in the emblem of our joyful and
bloodless revolution.”
By this time the three men had arrived in front of Mr.
Vine’s residence.


“ However," he continued, “ I’m glad we had a talk
over the matter, as we may—nay, we shall bequeath this
flag to posterity with honour ; and now my mind is made
up, the colours shall be — Red, White, and Blue."
“ And the design and motto, father ?” enquired his
son, as if anxious to know the old man’s mind.”
“On that, I require no assistance ; one word will
best describe both—original."
“ Good,” said Galloway, laughing heartily at the
perspicuity of the President; “no doubt we’ll see the
capture of a slaver, or the sinking of a pirate, or
Napoleon and Lowe enjoying a game of crib, while a
certain young sailor on board of one of the guard ships
lying off the ‘ Helena ’ is rehearsing Nelson’s advice to
his midshipmen—‘Fear God, honour the King, and hate
a Frenchman as you hate the devil.’ ’’
“Jem, you are facetious to-night, but I’m not to be
drawn ; you’ll see my idea in good time ; so, until to-
morrow-adieu.”
At this the friends shook hands and parted, father and
son entering the house, and Galloway, who had just re-
plenished his pipe, struck another match, buttoned up
his coat, and strolled homeward.
Mr. Vine was the proud father of three interesting
daughters, Caroline, Elizabeth, and Isabella—interesting
they must have been—they are all married now ; but at
the time of which I am writing the Misses Vine gamboled
in the fine morning of life beneath the parental roof.
Forty years of gathering, however, by that old ravager,
Time, has bereft them of their honoured father, and a
thousand miles of ocean separates them from their
brother Charles, the companion of their childhood ; but
although the spectre has scattered his frosts over the


once fair forms of the makers of the Eight Hours’ flag, he
has not impaired their memory of the events of their
youth, nor robbed them of the pride which they inad-
vertently acquired, in the distinction bestowed on their
father’s household, and which is called “The Eight
Hours’ Family.”
The morning following the interview with Galloway,
Mr. Vine and his daughter Isabella met at breakfast,
the latter looking somewhat perplexed, as her eyes rested
on a large drawing still attached to the drawing-board
her father had just placed on a side table, but concerning
which he up to the present had maintained a
strict reserve. Isabella was the youngest of the three
daughters, and was looked upon by the rest of the family as
the prime confidant of her father. It was evident,
as she sat gazing on the pencilling, that Isabella
knew something beforehand about the drawing which
she now saw for the first time. Her brother had told
her, and her curiosity being now aroused she approached
the matter gently with the aged draughtsman, who was
engaged in the dual occupation of eating his breakfast
and scanning the morning Age.
“ Charley told me, father,” said Miss Vine, “ that you
were going to some of the large drapers this morning,
and he thought you might want me to assist you in your
purchases.”
“ Eh! what ? To buy bunting ?” and the old man
laughed.” “ What would you know about bunting ?
Fiddlesticks.”
Miss Vine inwardly agreed with her parent as to her
ignorance of the nautical material. She would assuredly
have understood all about moire, or sarsanet, or muslin,
or cashmere ; but —bunting—


“ Now look here, Isabel,” and the old man placed
the drawing-board in an upright position on the table.
“ This is a drawing I have made of the proposed Eight
Hours' banner—the banner of the Australian system of
Eight Hours’ labour—the details are simplicity itself; the
extreme length of the flag is 17 feet 2 inches, and the
depth is 9 feet, including the red border which frames
the blue field on each side of the square, by a width of
1 foot 6 inches ; the motto as you see, ‘ Eight Hours’
labour, Eight Hours’recreation, Eight Hours’rest,’ to be
12-inch white letters, sewn on in horizontal lines as here
shown. Now do you think you understand my plan, eh?”
“ Well, yes, father,” replied the young lady, with a
slight trepidity of voice and gesture, “ but I should have
thought you would surely have decided on silk as the
material for so important an emblem, to say nothing of
the emblazonry setting forth a muddle of fiery dragons,
lions rampant, or perhaps a lady with a fire brigade man's
helmet on her head, and in her hand .”
“ Tut, tut, nonsense, my girl; I intend this banner to
be handed down to those who shall maintain our glorious
principles, therefore it must be made of lasting material
and standing colours. Bunting, my child—bunting will
last when your silk is in dust. Red, white, and blue
won’t ‘ run,' and for the motto—well, while the English
language is spoken the humblest may read as much
of its true significance as the scholar.”
Here the veteran enthusiast put down his drawing
board, and putting on his coat and hat prepared to leave
home. He was anxious, however, for his daughter’s ap-
proval, as he consulted her on all matters that interested
him.
“ What do you think 01 my idea ?” he inquired.


“ It will certainly effect all you say, father,” said
Isabella; “ it will be durable, and I think it will look very
well.”
“ Ah ! good ; well I’ll send you home the bunting
from Buckley's, and some navy thread ; get Elizabeth
and Caroline to help you, as it must be ready before
Whit Monday, and who knows but you may make a
name for yourself as proud as Queen Eleanor, who, it
is said, worked the celebrated Bayeaux tapestry.”
These three ladies faithfully complied with their
father’s injunctions, the result being the Eight Hours’
banner of Victoria, of which the coloured frontispiece to
this work is an illustration.

“ Behold the little acorn, pushing up to the surface,

The phantom vessels of King Alfred and the “ Golden

beneath the horizon of solid facts ; and the Eight Hours

Wales, negotiated for a time but a hardy and unfruitful
existence in these colonies. It was reserved for the

the seedling, stimulate its vigorous growth, and
ultimately “ launch ” the full rigged-ship upon the “ boiling
surf." It must, however, be allowed that the circum-
stances surrounding the mother colony and New Zealand,
when they seized the opportunity to implant the germ
amongst them, and to warm it into life, were unfavourable,
and their pluck in the delicate and difficult task, as well
as their re-acquisition and protection of the movement
as a system in later years, deserves the highest com-
mendations from all who appreciate the blessing it has
proved to be to toiling humanity.
As much might probably be written of their local
achievements in connection with the movement in each
of these colonies as I am now writing in the form of a
souvenir of the fortieth anniversary of the system in
Victoria.
Following to a conclusion the story I have ventured
upon, it will be observed that the principal barriers on
and after the 21st April were Mr. Cornish, the builder of
the new Parliament Houses, and Mr. Holmes, the con-
tractor for the Western Market works.
Within the first fortnight, however, both of these
employers gave way ; in the case of the Parliament
House, the Government pressed Mr. Cornish to continue
the works (for which he tendered, while the agitation for
the Eight Hours was proceeding, while other tenderers
provided for the contingency) and subsequently indemni-
fying him in a sum of for his estimated loss
through the introduction of the Eight Hours’ system.
The bulk of evidence given before a board appointed by
the Government to deal with Cornish's case affirmed that,
under the new arrangements, viz., the surrender by the


workmen of an equivalent in wages to meet the difference
in time, they (the contractors) had sustained no loss.
E. G. Fitzgibbon, Esq., then Town Clerk of Mel-
bourne (now Chairman of the Metropolitan Board of
Works), certified that “ works now in hand (sth August,
1856) for the corporation are being done at prices lower
than those paid prior to the movement." So ended, for that
time at least, all opposition to the introduction of the
Eight Hours’ system into Victoria. A coincidence is
perhaps worth recording, i.e., the works of the building
of our new Legislative Chambers, which were summarily
stopped on the occasion of the midday march on 21st
April, 1856, were completed in due course, and seven
months later, viz., 21st November of the same year, the
first constitutional Parliament of Victoria assembled
within its walls.
Carlton “ Paddock ” was the designation by which
was most known in 1856 the magnificent reserve now
enclosing that huge pile of architectural eccentricities,
erected at enormous cost and maintained at an
annual loss to the taxpayers, in which to hold our Inter-
national Exhibitions and “ great world fairs.” The
paddock was then almost in a state of nature, and
although within the city boundaries, few habitations
were around it, where now some of the most approved
dwellings and terraces look down on its ornamental lakes,
mythological statuary, and ambrosial promenades.
The goldfish and the English songbirds have taken
the place of the laughing-jackass,* the snake, and the
’possum. It was within these grounds on Whit Monday,
12th May, 1856, that the young emancipated tradesmen
of Melbourne mustered to engage in the precursor of

THOMAS GAMON,
STONEMASON, PRESIDENT EIGHT HOURS' PIONEERS' ASSOCIATION.
BORN AT INCE COUNTY CHESHIRE 29TH JANUARY, 1820
(DAY KING GEORGE III DIED).
Served his apprenticeship in Liverpool; subsequently foreman mason
at the building of Birkenhead Docks, and inspector of works under
Joseph Cupitt, Esq., engineer-in-chief on the Great Northern Railways,
constructed by the late Mr. Thomas Brassey. Arrived in Melbourne by
the ship Chalmers , 1852, and immediately proceeded to the diggings at
Fryer’s Creek, Forest Creek, &c. Joined the Masons’ Society during
Eight Hoars’ Agitation, 1856. Afterwards foreman mason at the building
of St. Paul’s schools (site of present cathedral), and at the building of
the lighthouse on Wilson's Promontory.


those great processions which have since then been held
each year on the 21st April. The morning was propi-
tious, although somewhat cloudy, and at an early hour
the several crafts arrived in goodly numbers, with
banners, emblems, bands, and other paraphernalia
incidental to an outdoor demonstration. The accessories
of banners and emblems, depicting the various arts of
peace, are almost as venerable as those engaged in war,
and which were the standards of monarchs and their
feudal barons. In the illuminated copies of Froissart
may be seen several of these representations. One
showing a hammer, trowel, and plumb (masons and
bricklayers), on an azure field; on another an axe and
two pairs of compasses (carpenters); and on the painting
of the battle between Philip d’Artevland and the Flem-
ings and the King of France are illustrations of banners
charged with boots and shoes (shoemakers), drinking
vessels (tinsmiths and potters), while more ancient still
is the emblem of Gao, the blacksmith who overthrew the
dynasty of the tyrant Zohak, the first of the princes to
reign in Persia after the deluge, and for whose discom-
fiture the blacksmith of Khorassan raised as his
standard his old leather apron —hence the apron of the
Persians. Indeed, in all countries and at all times those
visible signs of discontent and reform have ever been
objects of the greatest interest and devotion. There is,
however, one contingency to be reckoned with in the
raising of a standard—one cardinal qualification to the
glory which must radiate from it as a centre —the quality
of success.
For this the star-spangled banner of America joined
issue with the royal flag of England, and like the tri-
colour of La Fayette in France, which replaced the flew


de-lis of the House of Valois, both were begotten in seas
of blood. If the movement for reform predicates a per-
manent success, and is ratified by a victory which places
assurance beyond doubt, the standard and its champions
are ennobled with the halo of glory and the title of
heroes. Reverse the picture (and an accident may blast
the best-designed operations) and we have—
Rebellion ! foul, dishonouring word.
Whose wrongful blight so oft has stained
The holiest cause that tongue or sword
Of mortal ever lost or gain’d.
How many a spirit, born to bless,
Hath sunk beneath its withering name,
Whom but a day’s, an hour's success
Had wafted to eternal fame!
MOORE'S Lalla Rookh.
Perhaps it was with mingled feelings akin to the fore-
going that the new Eight Hours’ banner of Victoria was
viewed upon this Whit Monday of 1856; but if there
were any misgiving in the minds of some in the large
crowd who watched the gathering of the new societies,
it was certainly not to be observed, either on the coun-
tenances or in the demeanour of the “ Demonstration
Committee.”
The Cremorne band struck up, and enlivened the
proceedings with some stirring music as the trades
exchanged congratulations, and the marshals—busy here,
there, and everywhere—caused much amusement while
getting their semi-disciplined companies into something
like order.
Scotland for ever ! A Highland piper in full costume,
assisted by a piccolo player and a drummer, essayed the
task of silencing, or producing a howling discord, among
the gentlemen of Teutonic nationality forming the band,
and whose faces and necks became distended and scarlet


as they laboured on with their brass instruments in com-
plete contempt for the pibroch-player and his satellites
as they made the welkins ring with “ The MacGregor’s
Gathering.”
Have you ever noticed, dear reader, that the most
delightful part of a great holiday is the start ? When
the energies are relaxed by the fresh morning air, and
the buoyancy of animal spirits is excited by the con-
tinuous arrival on the scene of old and valued friends,
and the introduction to new ones about to take part in
the gay scene. The holiday attire of our wives and
children and our sweethearts, who have for a few happy
hours left the environments of home, and now, wreathed
in smiles and dressed in their newest, are exulting in the
anticipated enjoyments of the brief season during which
“ dull care ” is turned adrift, and the charmed exuberance
of the hour is unsullied by a single reflection of what
the close of the day or the rise of to-morrow's sun may
bring forth.
Shortly after ten o’clock the procession, about 1200 or
1500 strong, preceded by the band, issued forth from the
“ paddock ” with the Eight Hours’ banner at the head of
the Demonstration Committee, supported by a Union
Jack, with a golden figure of Eight on the spear end of
the staff. In the van was the President and Chief
Marshal, Thomas Walter Vine, who was soon after
joined by the very popular Mayor of Melbourne, Cr. John
Thomas Smith, whose well-known white hat, and whiter
shirt frills, formed themes for satire and sonnet alike
among the precocious wags of the period.
Next came the masons, followed by the bricklayers,
carpenters and joiners, plumbers, painters, slaters,
quarrymen and coachbuilders, the whole forming the


nucleus of the fifty Eight Hours’ trades, which have
since then sprung into existence in Victoria, and whose
accumulated thousands in procession needs the retention
of a vantage site for over an hour, as did the citizens of
the ancient mistress of the world, who—
“ Climbed up the walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,
To see great Pompey pass through the streets of Rome.”
Thousands of people lined the streets on the occasion
of the inaugural show; many whose intellectual nourish-
ment was drawn from the poisoned source of the literary
snipe who bewailed that “ for thirty years at least, the
midnight hour has never seen the termination of our
daily toil,” and whose work “ begun as early in the
morning as that of the most penurious workman.”* The
“ wet blanket,” however, produced no visible effect, and
all went merry as a marriage bell.
Amongst the ensigns displayed on the occasion, and
which were necessarily limited, was an appropriate
banner with a representation of a beehive, and the in-
scription attached, “ Unity and Benevolence, ’ followed
by a flag bearing three half moons on a black ground.
What affinity existed between the Prophet Mahomet, or
the Caliphs of Persia (all of whom are symbolised in the
illustration) and the particular trade which rejoiced in
flaunting their emblem, is not explained, doubtless for the
all-sufficient reason that its significance was never
questioned, and the ancient standard of the “ night and
the shadow ” with the historic crescent, emblematic of
the prophet’s flight from Mecca to Medina, served a pur-
pose that those great ones of the east never dreamed of.
Next came a pretty flag, on which was emblazoned the
* Morning Herald , 23rd April, 1856,


rose and shamrock—but horror ! —“ Where’s the thistle,
Jim?” asked a bystander of Stephens, the Welsh
Chartist. “ Why don’t you ask me where’s the leek ? ”
suggested the burly mason, by way of reply; while roars
of laughter were produced as the omission was per-
ceived. Piquant banter followed, the fun being aug-
mented by witty suggestions and alternatives— “ Cut one
in the paddock, ‘ Jim’ and stick it on the top of the pole.”
“Where’s the Highlander ? Bring him along.” The semi-
nude is hurried up behind the incomplete emblem, and
soon the “ screech” of the bagpipes supplies the loss of
the prickly exotic, and on the procession moves again,
Ever increasing crowds greet the new movement at every
point. Along Nicholson-street, Bourke-street, Elizabeth-
street, and thence through Collins-streetto the Cremorne
Gardens. Here the sports and festivities were entered
upon with whole-hearted pleasure.
The family baskets were unpacked in green shady
nooks; the little ones—ever, ever hungry—ever im-
patient, guzzled until they rolled over helpless on the
sward; the elder branches who were at the period of
adolescence—so sweet, particularly with the gentler sex
—when one is just escaping out of those tedious “ teens,”
and rising the first score of years, and when “ love’s
young dream” is most fascinating, abandoned themselves
to the giddy swirl and mazy allurements of the dance,
undeterred by those moralists of which the “ Broadford
parson ”is one of the latest types. I have heard not a
few in later years, when by their firesides in the winter
of life, tell their children of some of the little frolics of the
Whit Monday of 1856, and seriously declare that “danc-
ing was dancing in those days.” At three o'clock the
men sat down to dinner in the pavilion, to the number


of six or seven hundred, with Mr. T. W. Vine in the
chair. The speeches were curtailed through the Mayor
being obliged to leave early to proceed to Sydney ; and
Dr. Embling, who had promised to give an address
on the Eight Hours, was unavoidably absent, and al-
though there was a good supply of speakers present,
ready to exhaust an ordinary toast list, it was found to
be useless to restrain the desire for the enjoyments of the
open air, with its side-splitting shows, the inevitable
Punch and Judy, the “marvellous Wielands,” and the
preparations for the warlike display which was to send
them all home to dream of thundering cannons belching
forth fire and smoke, scaling of parapets, the emblems of
Mahomet and La Fayette disappear in the chaos, and
the divided eagle of Russia floats on the crest of the
Malakoff, when lo ! the Union Jack, with a golden Eight
is descried advancing at the head of a motley group, in
which is represented every type of humanity, from the
cock-lane ghost to Cicero—and the illusion is dispelled as
the dreamer realises that—
“ Every flap of England’s flag
Proclaims that all around are free,
From farthest Ind. to each blue crag
That beetles o’er the western sea,”
The day and the night are past; the future of the
Eight Hours is henceforth the problem. Will it survive?
. . . Forty years after. How has it been maintained ?
Victorians of 1896, answer ! We have nourished it until
we saw it resuscitated in healthy growth in those
colonies where it had almost perished. We stimulated
its adoption in South Australia, Tasmania, Queensland,
and Western Australia ; we watched its development in
other lands until we observed it shake England to
its centre in later years ; we saw the Government of the


United States, by an Act of Congress in 1868, provide for
its transplantation throughout all the mechanical
branches of the Government service of the great
republic ; we read of our fruit extending to alien coun-
tries, and the National Federation of Belgium join with
the German miners in a demand for its provisions in the
auspicious month of April, 1891, and the following month
of the same year the electric current flashed the news of
one hundred thousand underground toilers of Illinois,
who came forth from the deep and gloomy mines to
struggle for a branch of that tree grown from the “little
acorn ” which was already bringing joy to millions of
human beings throughout the civilised world. Circum-
spice!
But I am travelling beyond the limits assigned to this
portion of my subject, and must retrace my steps some-
what to explain a few of the immediate effects which the
institution of the system had in Victoria.
One of the earliest complaints bandied about the
probable result of its operation was the common one
applied by ungenerous and uncharitable people, on the op-
portunities which the time snatched from toil would afford
workmen of indulging in the pleasures of the bottle, and
the questionable influences of the public-house, instead
of the attractions of mental culture and other pursuits of
a more elevating character.
The same luminous scribbler to whom I have already
adverted writes:—“ We did not happen to see the pro-
cession ourselves in all its sober solemnity; we only
obtained a glimpse of it when the magnanimous passing
of resolutions, the heroical imbibition of nobblers, and
the more glowing and dubious production of the tributary
half-crowns at the tavern meeting, only reminded us of


what we have very often witnessed and deplored in the
old country.”
Paltry libeller of his race ! It is more than probable
that “ ourselves ” was a “ deadhead ” at the “ tavern ”
meeting ; and how “we” can contrive to squeeze forty-
two pence into half-a-crown is a feat which must be
known only to ‘‘us. ’ A few general facts will suffice to
show what use the trades made of their opportunities
and their means.
The proceeds of the Cremorne jete, amounting to
were equally divided between the two principal
charities, viz., the Melbourne Hospital and the Mel-
bourne Benevolent Asylum to begin with, and the
“ blockhead who set the agitation going”—presumably
James Stephens—now set another agitation on foot, and
a Committee of the trades, with the “blockhead” as its
Chairman, in a short time raised the further sum of
£IOOO for the hospital, by holding meetings in the even-
ings in Melbourne and vicinity, and at a time when
their censor conceived they would have been indulging in
senseless and degrading conviviality. With this sum as a
nucleus the Hospital Committee decided to start a new
wing, and—unhappily the circumstance seems to be
forgotten—it was to be called the “ Tradesmen’s Wing.”
To commemorate the event a dinner (Englishmen must
have a dinner) was held at the Cross Keys Hotel,
Russell-street, with Mr. Stephens in the chair. The
report of the Hospital Committee of the 29th January,
1857, makes special reference to “ the working-men of
Melbourne and its vicinity,” and to whom it offers its
“congratulations.” It would be difficult to enumerate
the several sums extending over a number of years
raised for the same good purpose by the Eight Hours’


trades and through their agency, but a few items may
be of interest to show the use the Victorian workmen
made of their new-born leisure :
By Collections at Evening Meetings .. £l,OOO 0 0
~ Twenty-six Life Governors, appointed
by the Eight Hours' Anniversaries
Committees, at £2O each .. ~ 520 o o
~ Nine Life Governors, appointed by
Trade Societies, £2O each .. .. 180 o o
~ Melbourne Typographical Society, 1857 100 o o
~ Proceeds of Concert, organised by Eight
Hours' Anniversary Committee on
Ship James Baines .. .. .. 120 o o
~ Half Proceeds of Fete, 1856 .. .. 124 o o
£2.044 o o
Note.— The foregoing table is totally distinct from all other
contributions for the same purpose voted by individual trade
societies, and collected annually in other ways in the various hives
of industry—factories, foundries, workshops, buildings, railways,
wharves, and shipping, and which would total a very large sum.

It will be observed that not only did the Eight Hours’
trades start well in the cause of charity, but they have
steadily maintained the virtue in all its pristine designs.
The “ tavern ” meeting, as their ungenerous critic
called it, was early dispensed with, and a place of meet-
ing erected where the suspicion of the drinking custom
would not prevail; but here let it be asked, why should
the working classes (operative mechanics) be singled out
in this particular phase of life for animadversion ? It was
imperative, before they were in a position to build meet-
ing places themselves, that they should have accommo-
dation, which only houses of public resort could supply.
Hotels or “taverns” have, from all time, been the poor
man’s meeting house, where he might discuss his griev-
ances with his neighbours, and often find a sympathetic
and responsive chord awakened in his misery among
those of his own class. Let it be remembered that long
before the erection of special meeting halls, or the
churches had opened their doors to the proletariat on
Sunday afternoons for the discussion of social subjects
affecting the labouring classes, it was in public house and
“tavern” were formulated some of the greatest reforms
which have enabled the British workman to hold up his
head as becomes a free citizen in a free country, and to
qualify himself to take his place in life as a thinker,


reasoner, debater, representative on public conventions,
the magisterial bench, and finally even to the Senate House
of his country. In public house and “ tavern ’’ were
instituted the Anti-Corn Law League, the Reform Bill,
1832, and the Chartists’ gospel, to which, in a great
measure, we owe the freedom of our Australian institutions
to-day. Much more might be said, but space will not
permit me to follow farther this club-ridden scribe, this
victim of absynthe and benedictine, “ blasting his whole-
some brother,” and who, revelling in the mire of besotted
ignorance and perverted humanity, can see no parallel
between the Palace Yard Convention and the grog
shanties of the Eureka, nor between the Crown and
Anchor in the Strand and the Belvidere on the Eastern
Hill.
On the 25th April, immediately following the great
demonstration, the Eight Hours’ Labour League was
established, with the design of extending the blessing of
the new principle to all the labouring classes in the com-
munity. This league was presided over by Mr. John
Sinclair, M.L.A., with Mr. A. Forsyth as treasurer, and
Mr. Cattach as secretary, and included representatives
from the Early Closing Association. While the new
trades’ associations were engaged consolidating their laws,
the league was doing good work throughout the more
distant centres of population. Ballarat, Bendigo,
and Castlemaine were visited; meetings were held
and branches formed, an immense roll being made
up of those whose occupations and conditions
precluded their membership to trades’ unions. The
study of politics as a consequence soon began to occupy
the minds of the people. Leading public men discovered
the growth of an organisation which was capable of


effecting political equality, and reforming abuses which
were the natural outcome of the old conservative system
which had hitherto prevailed. The interminable land
problem, which no doubt had its origin in every country
under the sun in pre-historic times, was just then a burn-
ing question. Necessarily, the Eight Hours’ men early
learned that the landed interest retarded settlement and
agricultural prosperity in a primary degree, The
squatters' occupation licences, with perpetuity of tenure,
locked up nearly all the avenues which led to the intro-
duction of yeomanry homesteads, and were the
fertile source of inequitable taxation. On the other
hand, the large class whose living is solely drawn from a
free soil under cultivation, together with their advocates,
having observed the lesson in organisation set by the
craftsmen of the cities, conceived the idea of amalgama-
tion, in the hope that a general agitation would result in
useful legislation, and a fair share of the national burdens
would be drawn from that source which John Stuart
Mill aptly called “ the unearned increment.” Thus a
new agitation sprung up, led by John Wilson Gray,
Graham Berry, George Higlnbotham, J. J. Walsh, and
others, who formed another powerful organisation,
entitled “ The Convention Land and Reform League of
Victoria.”
My limits debar me from detailing the proceedings of
this League, and I should not have introduced it but for
the active part taken in it by the Eight Hours’ leaders,
who there obtained their first lessons in the perplexing
study of the land question. From reciprocal motives, as
I have pointed out, these leaders identified themselves
with the Eight Hours’ League, the President of the
Convention, Mr. Wilson Gray, being also a member of


the Executive of the former body. Of this latter gentle-
man no eulogy said or sung by anyone of the present
day could do justice to his memory.
In the terse and epigrammatic words of his learned and
eminent coadjutor in politics, the late Chief Justice
Higinbotham, “He never compromised a principle ”
I wish I could say the same for myself. The Eight
Hours’ League and the Convention had both to mourn
his loss. After years of struggle with the prejudices which
beset his path in founding a true Australian democratic
sentiment, and no longer able to withstand the strain on
his mental and physical energies, he passed away, proud
and penniless, from the scene, and finds an early grave
in New Zealand, forgotten and almost unknown. Of
him might it be written—
" You have worth, richly enamelled with modesty ;
And though your lofty merits might sit crown’d
On Caucasus or the Pyrenean mountains,
You chose the humble valley ;
And had rather grow a safe shrub below
Than tempt the winds, and be a cedar !”
The close of 1856 and the opening of 1857 were
signalised by the greatest excitement in Victoria. Every-
thing was new, and institutions of all classes were on
their trial. New Government, new constitution, new
democracy, new organisations, new grievances—every-
thing was new. New men (the new woman was yet
unborn) came by every ship and took their places on the
platform.
Old Paddy’s Market, the Belvidere, Carlton and Rich-
mond “ Paddocks,” each had their quota of agitators on
every conceivable subject, from the elements of the
British constitution to the operations of the newest bush-
ranger.


The 2 ist April, 1857, the first anniversary has
come round amid all the excitement, and with a brief
description of which I will draw this portion of my sub-
ject to a close. Although it is the “ anniversary,” it is also
the first time the trades assembled on the “ true day ” to
hold their fete, the inauguration through misadventure.it
will be remembered, being held on Whit Monday, 12th
May.
Of this anniversary Mr. Douglass was President, as he
was also one of the Vice-Presidents of the Eight Hours'
League. Benjamin Douglass first saw the light in the
Parish of Greenwich, County of Kent, on the 26th March,
1830, and while yet a youth he had an early experience
of the troublesome times of the Chartist agitation; when,
after one of those frays before alluded to in this story,
between the military and the people, he beheld his father
carried home wounded and bleeding, one of the victims
of the “ Fire low and lay them out ” ordinances of these
earlier agitations. Mr. Douglass’ association with
Wilson Gray, Don, Dewar, Strickland, Horseman, Vine,
and other leaders of the Eight Hours’ Extension Move-
ment in Victoria, is, and must ever be, inseparable from
the history of the system. The first anniversary pro-
cession, through the circumstances of having twelve
months in which to make preparations, was a decided
advance on the inaugural display.
New banners are objects of great interest with the
public, and certainly no such sight from an outdoor
artistic point of view had hitherto been seen in Aus-
tralia. The Eight Hours’ flag was again in advance,
followed by the masons, amongst whom were a number
of the “ craft ” of Free Masons, who wore their regalia
and emblems on the occasion. Their beautiful new


banner, showing three allegorical figures, emblematic of
Labour, Recreation, and Rest, was much admired. Fol-
lowing the masons came the bricklayers, with a hand-
some new standard depicting on the front an angel
stooping to raise the workingman, and on the reverse
the bricklayers’ arms. Alongside of the front ranks of
the leading trades marched the Demonstration Com-
mittee, bearing blue wands and rosettes. After the
bricklayers came the following trades, with banners and
other insignia of their several callings—labourers, quarry-
men, coachbuilders, printers, plasterers, carpenters and
joiners, and plumbers. A melancholy event, however,
caused a subdued effect on what might otherwise have
been' a gala of unrestrained enjoyment, both to the
sightseers and processionists. It was observed that all
the banner staves were draped with the sad garb of
mourning, while other manifestations of sorrow were
not wanting to evidence the fact that someone of more
than ordinary importance had passed away. It proved
to be the wife of Victoria’s highly respected Governor,
Sir Henry Barkley, whose remains were that morning
conveyed, with the universal regret of the whole people,
to a vault in the new Melbourne Cemetery.
It may here be observed that when the trades of
Melbourne pay any mark of deference to representa-
tive persons or memories of departed friends, it is whole-
hearted and sincere.
From the Sandridge Pier on the yth May, 1866,
their banners waved an adieu to the late hapless Sir
Charles Darling, as he took his seat in the pinnace that
ferried him over the water in tears to the homeward-
bound ship which bore him away for ever from the
country and the people he loved.


OFFICERS of the FORTIETH
EIGHT HOURS ANNIVERSARY COMMITTEE


On the 22nd February, 1879, the trades paid a similar
compliment to Sir George and Lady Bowen, and in the
address presented to that distinguished representative
of the Crown they express “ the confidence they have
always felt in the exercise of that true statesmanship
and impartiality for which your Excellency’s adminis-
tration has been conspicuous.”
Sir Henry and Lady Loch soon endeared themselves
to the whole people, but it must be admitted that they
had exceptional advantages, through being with us in
“the good times,” and when the Eight Hours’ anniver-
saries which occurred during their regime were in the
zenith of pageantry and prosperity.
His Excellency was the first Governor who honoured
the trades by taking part in their festivities, and when in
the year 1885 the President of the Demonstration Com-
mittee (Mr. Miller), in toasting His Excellency’s health at
the midday banquet, held on the field of sports, regretted
the absence of Lady Loch, he was gently reproved by
the Governor, who said the reason Lady Loch was not
present was because “she was not invited ” —an omission
which was atoned for the following year, when the dis-
tinguished visitors followed in their carriage the wake of
the procession from the Treasury, where they viewed the
pageant, to the Friendly Societies’ Gardens.
At the anniversary of 18S7, Sir William Robinson
(Acting-Governor) observed the passage of the gala from
the balcony of the Treasury, when the honour (which
doubtless he prized most) was paid him by the trades
halting, amid waving standards, banners, and ensigns,
while the massed bands played his beautiful composition,
“ Unfurl the Flag.”


In iBgo the Earl and Countess of Hopetoun were re-
ceived with genuine enthusiasm, and His Excellency was
presented with a beautifully illuminated address, embody-
ing a synopsis of the origin of the Eight Hours’ System,
and of which Elis Lordship continued a warm patron
during his tenure of office in Victoria.
The first anniversary was a great success, and realised
a substantial profit, which was applied, as have all
other revenues derived from the same source during these
forty long years, viz.:
The Best Means of Advancing the
EIGHT HOURS’ SYSTEM.

(This UJmtument
Is erected to the memory of the late

CONCLUSION.
PIONEERS PASSING AWAY—Galloway's Tomb—Death
of James Stephens.
Four decades of years have made sad havoc among
those scions of a brave old stock. The shadow of the
grizzly monarch has stolen often and at uncertain times
to the abodes of the once hardy pioneers. He has spared
some few to witness their fortieth annual cycle deposit its
April garland on the beloved prize ; while with others
his mandate has been inexorable.
Alas! poor James Galloway, all too early you had to
surrender your charge, and accompany the master to the
grave. The cold white marble entablature, that meets
the eye of the wanderer among the tombs, tells only in
the poverty of language the story of your young life.


In the Church of England compartment of the Mel-
bourne General Cemetery stands four Corinthian
columns, rising from a massive stone base and sur-
mounted by a moulded canopy of imposing proportions,
the whole crowned with an allegorical finial emblematic
of the Eight Hours’ System.
The quadrangle in which is reared this artistic pile is
enclosed by an iron railing, in character with the struc-
ture, which is wrought in Malmsbury stone, and exe-
cuted in the most finished style of the mason's art.
On the northern face of the monument may be read
the foregoing inscription ;
Beneath it in peace lies
JAMES GILVRAY GALLOWAY.
He has since been joined by Wilson Gray, Higin-
botham, Don, T. W. Vine, John Thomas Smith, the
brothers Henry and Thomas Topping, and the latest,
Alexander Todd.
On a sultry night, about the middle of November of
the year 1889, two men might be observed advancing
at a rapid pace along the thronged thoroughfare of
Lygon-street, Carlton. The heat of the day had left an
almost unbearable glow in the atmosphere, without the
slightest breath of wind to temper this early indication
of a torrid summer. Promenaders in the streets were
quietly sauntering; watching the adjusting of shutters
and the extinguishing of lights in the establishments of
that section of uncompromising shopkeepers whom no
early-closing petitions nor decrees of parliament can
compel to abandon “ business ” before 10 p.m.


The two pedestrians strode on rapidly in silence
until a sharp turn westward brought them to a narrow
street in the vicinity of the Melbourne University.
The men now slackened their pace as the narrow
footpath led them to a neat row of cottages, with
gardens in front, enclosed by a picket fence, abutting on
to the street. Opposite to one of these—the windows of
which were opened for the admission of air,
while a subdued light from a lamp within, fell
upon the front verandah and the shrubs and flowers
beneath, the companions stood for a moment.
“ This is the place,” said one. And they entered
the garden by the little white gate. A gentle
tap on the door, the knocker of which was muffled,
brought, in response, a young man apparently between
twenty-five and thirty years of age. A silent grasp of
his hand to each as they entered proved that the new-
comers were no strangers.
“ I think he is sleeping now,” said the young man,
whose face betrayed an anxious expression, in which
weariness and grief were blended.
“ Has the doctor seen him to-day ? ” enquired one of
the visitors.
“Yes,” whispered the young man ; “ but he gives me
no hope.”
By this time the three had entered the sick room,
where, with all the accessories of unostentatious comfort
around, the patient reposed on a mattrass laid upon the
carpeted floor, with his head gently elevated with pillows.
The form stretched there, and from which, for cool-
ness, the bed covering had been partly thrown back, and
the patient’s under garment been opened on the throat
and breast, revealed the wasted frame of a once powerful


man. A large, well formed head and intelligent face, on
which a full beard, now white and grizzled, appeared.
But a close observer would discern that the visage which
bore it, now contracted by physical collapse, yet displayed
the outlines of one of serious character and individuality,
while the muscular hands, bronzed and bruised, as they
lay prone by his side, told of the rough usage through
which they had passed in the battle of life.
“ Father,” said the young man, as, tenderly kneeling
by the side of the invalid, who had now opened his eyes,
and looking around he caught sight of the visitors, “your
friends have come to stay a while with you, and I am
going to leave you with them for a short time, as I
promised the doctor I would see him again to-night.
Shall I go, father ? I’ll not be long.”
The patient, by a motion, signified acquiescence ;
Another look of intense anxiety, and the young man
rose and hastily left the room to hide the tears which
started, uncontrolled.
The two friends knelt on either side of the dying man,
and took his hands in theirs.
“ I’m glad you’ve come,” murmured the patient in a
low voice, but in which the stilted Welsh pronunciation
of the English language was apparent. “ I’ve had a
good many warnings, but I feel my time has come at
last.”
The exertion to speak, and the close atmosphere of
the apartment, induced thick beads of sweat to well up
on the invalid's forehead, while a humid vapour over-
spread the great muscular neck and chest. Yet his
hands were cold—clammy cold. The little attentions
which were necessary were delicately applied, and once


more he essayed to speak. The effort was almost
beyond his fast fleeting strength.
“ Bill,” he feebly whispered to the one who was now
re-arranging his pillows ; “ You’ll not forget your
promise to me when I’m gone. You know they ” the
remainder of the sentence was inaudible.
The assurance was repeated in a low but emphatic
voice in the ear of the rapidly sinking sufferer.
There was a momentary pause, the breathing became
stertorious for a few minutes, and the chest heaved and
sunk as the end seemed nigh.
Another short period of repose supervened; the old
man opened his eyes again and made an almost
superhuman effort to speak. The breath came
and went between the words, while a slight smile
played on his features—
“ Bill ! the flag—air—air—l—l
The one he had called “ Bill” raised him up from the
pillows to receive any current which might be induced
between the half-open window and the door leading into
the passage.
A deep respiration, followed by a slight muscular con-
traction of the features, was visible as the disengaged
hand, with the last spasm, grasped the bed cover, and
the poor head fell back gently on the breast of his
supporter, telling too plainly that it would never rise
again.
“ He’s gone,” observed he who still knelt by his side.
A hand was laid over the region of the heart; it was
stilled for ever ; the spirit had passed into the presence
of Him who said Ego sum ressuyrectio et vita.


James Stephens was no more.
“ Dead oak thou liv’st, thy smitten hands,
The thunder of thy brow
Speak with strange tongues in many lands,
And tyrants hear thee now.”
The companions of his death-bed were friends of many
years; the one who felt the last pressure of his honest
hand is Mr. William Campbell, the Secretary of the
Melbourne branch of the Amalgamated Engineers’ So-
ciety ; the other from whom he extorted the last earthly
promise, and on whose breast the grand old veteran’s
head was pillowed while he breathed his last sigh, is the
author of this little work.

THE 30th
EIGHT HOURS’ ANNIVERSARY,
21st APRIL, 1886.
BY PERMISSION OF MRS. MARCUS CLARKE.
The English air is fresh and fair,
The Irish fields are green,
The brightlight gleams o’er Scotland’s
streams
And glows her hills between.
The hawthorn is in blossom,
And birds from every bough
Make musical the dewy spring,
In April England now.
Our April bears no blossoms,
No promises of spring,
Her gifts are rain and storm and
stain,
And surges lash and swing.
No budded wreath doth she be-
queath,
Her tempests toss the trees,
Nor balmy gales, but shivered sails,
And desolated seas.
Yet still we love our April,
For it aids us to bequeath
A gift more fair than blossoms rare,
More sweet than budded wreath.
Our children’s tend’rest memories
’Round Austral April grow;
Twas the month we won their freedom,
boys ?
just twenty years ago.
Though Scotland has her forests,
Though Erin has her vales,
Though plentiful the harvest
In England’s sunny dales;
Vet foul amidst the fairness,
The factory chimneys smoke,
And the murmurs of the many
In their burdened bosoms choke.
We hear the children’s voices,
’Mid the rattle of the looms,
Crying “ Wherefore shut God’s heaven
All your golden afternoons?’’
Though here the English April
Nor song nor sun imparts,
Its spring is on our children’s lips.
Us summer in their hearts.
We’ve left the land that bore us,
Its castles and its shrines,
We’ve changed the cornfields and the
rye
For the olives and the vines.
Yet still we have our castles,
Yet still we bow the knee ;
We each enshrine a saint divine,
And her name is Liberty.
Liberty ! name of warning !
Did ye feel your pulses beat ?
As ye marching, moved this morning
All adown the cheering street ?
In your federated freedom,
In your manliness allied,
While the badges of your labour
Were the banners of your pride—
Did your fancies speak prophetic
Of a larger league than this ?
With higher aims and nobler claims
To grasp the good we miss 1
When in freer federation
In a future yet to be,
Australia stands a nation
From the centre to the sea,
Cheer for Australia, comrades,
And cheer for England too 1
Who loves them both will not be loth
To give each land its due.
So cheer for England, comrades—
Our fathers loved the soil
And the grandeur of her greatness
Is the measure of their toil.
But never let our sous forget,
Tilll mem’ry’s self be dead,
If England gave us birth, my lads,
Australia gave us bread 1
Then cheer for Young Australia,
The Empire of the Free,
When yet a greater Britain
The Southern Cross shall see.
We’ll not forget, nor yet regret,
The land from whence we’ve flown
But Britain was our father’s land—
Australia is our own.
