“suc/i beautiful goods as those handled by the Jeweller.''


Foreword
of any sort is interesting. If you
happen to be fortunate enough to be selling
such beautiful goods as those handled by the
Jeweller you are doubly fortunate.
It is no new thought that the more you know about
the products you sell, the more successful you will
be. Customers soon realize that you know your
subject, and their confidence in you and your
business is doubled. So also is your own confidence,
and your own pleasure and satisfaction in con-
ducting every sale.
Silverware is one of the major items you handle,
and its background is unique. It does not depend
on the whims of fashion for its popularity, for its
place in the Home is traditional.
This booklet outlines the history and tradition of
Silverware, and describes how good quality Plate
is made today. It touches briefly on the cleaning of
Silverware, and brings forward some of the many
sales appeals available. At the conclusion we have
included for permanent reference a glossary of
commonly used trade terms, and illustrations of some
English Hall Marks, going back as far as 1736.
If this booklet helps you to consolidate your know-
ledge and experience of Silverware, its purpose
will be achieved.
Should it add, in a small way, to your pleasure and
success in handling Silverware, we shall be pleased
indeed.

The History of Silverware
is the Ageless Metal.
fascination for man from the
earliest dawn of historv.
Archaeologists trace back the art
of silversmithing to about 2,500
vears B.C. Homer, the Greek poet,
wrote of “gold and silver vessels,
and centuries later, in the glorv
that was Rome, Horace described
“Homes that gleamed with silver.’’
Up to the Eighteenth Century
only the very wealthy could afford
Silverware. In England at that
time Hollow-ware for the major-
ity was usually made of Pewter,
earthenware or wood, and in the
case of tankards, even of leather.
Then, in 1742, came a new devel-
opment. Sheffield Plate was in-

discovered how to amalgamate
together an ingot of Copper
with a sheet of Silver, which was
rolled down to the required thick-
ness, and used to make a wide
range of household silverware.

But Silverware was still beyond the
reach of the ordinarv man. The
small merchant, the farmer, the
tradesman, had to he satisfied
with Pewter. Then, shortly after
Queen Victoria came to the Throne,
Pewter salts and plates, made between 1630 and 1700.
Sheffield Plate, with its copper
base metal covered by a thin
“Skin” of silver, had the some
appearance as Sterling. Being less
costly to make, this type of
Silverware could be afforded by
a wider range of people than ever
before. For the next hundred
years it rightly enjoyed great
popularity, and as the standard of
design and craftsmanship of the
English Silversmith at that time
was very high, originals in Sheffield

an amazing discovery was made.
It was the method of depositing
Silver on to a base metal by
Electricity or Silver Plating
as we know* it today. The
inventor had no connection with
the Silverware trade—he was a
young medical student named
Wright. The process was patented
in 1840, and in this one step the
cost of producing Silverware was
so reduced that almost universal
ownership became possible for the
first time.


Three examples of Sheffield Plate—A C.offee Pot , a Teapot and a Chocolate
Pot. These ivere made between 1780 and 1795.
The manufacture of Sheffield Plate
ceased, but some reproductions of
the old designs are made today,
using modern plating methods.
Some of the better “Old Sheffield
Reproductions” still capture the
beauty and charm of the Eight-
eenth Century.
The fascination, the usefulness,
and the appeal of good Silverware
is as great today as ever before,
and it can be enjoyed by every
one of us. Probably no craft is so
rich in tradition or has such a well
preserved heritage of its trade as
the craft of the silversmith.
This craft was brought to Australia
from England by Thomas Stokes,
who founded the firm of Stokes
and Sons in Melbourne in 1856'
He and his sons, and their sons,
have carefully preserved the silver-
smith’s traditions.
They realise that good silverware,
regardless of mechanical advance-
ment, must alway s be the work of
master-craftsmen.

alphabetical letter, representing
the year in which it was made. By
changing the letter each year, and
periodically the type of lettering
and the shape of the shield, the
age of a Sterling piece can be
traced back for manv hundreds of
years. (At the back of this booklet
is a list of the Hall Marks of
London, Birmingham and Sheffield
which can be used to trace the
age and origin of old Silver as far
back as the eighteenth century).

ation mark. Records of the earliest
Silversmiths go back even further
than the Hall Marks. The first
London Silversmith recorded was
Otto the Elder in the year 1090.
A few vears later it appears that
his son followed him into the bus-
iness, as an Otto the Younger is
listed as a Silversmith in 1120.
As there are no Assay Offices in
Australia, manufacturers use their
own marks. The words “Stg.”
“Sterling," “Sterling Silver" or
“925 ' will be found on each piece,
together with the maker’s name.
SILVER PLATED WARE , or
F..P.1N.5., meaning Electro-plated
nickel-silver, is the other main type
of Silverware and owing to its
lower price, enjoys the greater
popularity. It is made in as many


qualities as then' arc mouths in
the vear. but essentially it consists
of a Nickel Silver base metal, on
lop of which is deposited a layer
of Pure Si h er.
Nickel Silver is an alloy of Copper.
Zinc and Nickel. It is a hard
white metal with excellent wearing
qualities, and if proeessed properly,
is ideal for household Silverware.
The first of the several stages in
production starts when a flat sheet
of Nickel Silver, usually sized 6 ft.
by 2 ft., and of the correct thick-
ness, is cut to the required outline.
This is called blanking. These
at each operation. (.Tanging the
shape of Nickel Silver hardens it.
and to avoid the metal cracking
or tearing, it must he annealed or
softened between each dralthu;.
This is done bv heating to a certain
temperature for a period, usually
in an electric or gas furnace.
Spinning is another method of
shaping Silverware. Say, for
instance, we wish to make a round
sugar basin body. A “Chuck is
made of Steel or Wood (Lignum
vitae, the hardest wood in the
world), to the shape of the sugar
basin. A round Nickel Silver

flat blanks are now ready for
Drafting or Spinning.
The Drafting operation gives the
article its shape. The Blank is fed
into a large Press, and under manv
tons pressure the Blank takes the
shape of the Die or Tooling in the
press. If the article is deep, it
must pass through the Press several
times, the depth being increased
Blank is revolved at speed on a
lathe, while pressing against the
chuek.
As it spins around, the blank is
forced against the chuck bv a hand
tool, and graduallv takes the shape
of the chuck. It takes great skill
to maintain the thickness of the
Nickel Silver throughout, as it
tends to “thicken” in some parts,

Assembling. At this stage, the
various component parts ol an
article, already shaped bv Drafting
or Spinning are collected together
for Assembly. In the case of a
simple Scone Tray, all that would
be involved would he the soldering
of an overhead handle at each end.
With a Teapot, the parts would
consist of a Body, a Foot, a Spout
and a Handle, the last two each

The l\pe ot Saltier is a \ilal point.
There is Haul Solder. which is an
allo\ of silver, copper and zinc.
This Ims a ver\ iiiuh inching point,
TOO dcg.L.. and is as strong as the
Nickel Silver itself. For instance,
a handle which is properly hard
soldered will never break off. Hard
Solder should he used for the
soldering of all major components.
It is approximately 10 times as
strong as Soft Solder.
Soft Solder. Is a mixture of Lead
and Tin. Its strength is limited,
and it melts at a low temperature,
200 deg.C. It should only he
used where no strength is re-
quired of it, sueh as for affixing
decoration. The Silversmith fits
the various components together

“ The Blank is forced against the Chuck by a hand-tool. "
by filing and hammering. Then
the Soldering takes place, the
Silversmith using a gas and air
hand-torch. He is careful to see
that the solder flows over the full
area required, but does not ‘Run’
beyond this point. Spouts and
“hollow " handles are stamped in
two halves in a press. The waste
metal around the stampings is
"‘clipped,” or remov ed, and the two
sides filed and fitted, and soldered
together, before being soldered to
the main body.
Decoration added hv the Silver-
smith to the edge of say a Salver,
or an Entree Dish, is called a
“Mount.” To save costs, this is
sometimes stamped into the article
with a die. The article is then
called “Self Mounted.” However
the best means of applying this
type of decoration is to solder a
separate piece of Nickel Silver
carrying the design, on to the
main piece. Much greater depth
and detail of the design is achieved,
and at the same time the edge is
strong!v reinforced against damages.
The mounting ot Silverware adds
to its production costs, but it adds
a great deal to its beauty and use-
fulness. There are two main types
ot mounts in common use. The
simpler is Nickel Silver “M ire.”
This wire carries various designs,
such as “Gadroon,” “Straight
Gadroon,” “Reed and Ribbon,”

rolled on to it by a Die in the shape
of a wheel. The wire is cut off to
the correct length, shaped to fit
the article, and soldered into
position.
The well known Grape Vine pattern
is an example of the other and
more involved type of mounting.
Firstly the pattern is cast in
nickel silver in lengths of about
4 inches. Each piece is then struck
with a Die to bring up every fine
detail. The waste metal around the
pattern is clipped off, and a
number of pieces soldered together
to the required diameter. In the
case of an Ice Bucket mounting,
the circle or ring of mounts are
hammered to take the shape of the
top of the Ice Bucket body, slid on
to the outside of the body, and
soldered to it. The top of the body
is trimmed to conform with the
intricate shape of the Grape Vine
design. As you can see, a great
deal of skilled hand work is in-
volved if a perfect mount is to
be achieved, which is the reason
why a Grape Vine mounted piece
costs more than an article mounted
with the simpler wire, or undecor-
ated.
Another of the Silversmith’s many
arts is Flat Hammering. It is
always difficult to achieve a per-
fectly flat surface of any large area
in Nickel Silver or Sterling. A
typical example is a round 14 in.
diameter Salver. After it is shaped
by Drafting or Spinning, the
bottom becomes warped, and if
polished and plated in this con-
dition the effect would be far from
pleasing. In addition the bottom
would tend to “spring” when
carrying a load. The heat caused
by Soldering a mount on to the
edge of the Salver adds to the
warping.
The Silversmith corrects this fault


h\ hammering the entire bottom

polished head. lie starts in the
centre, works out to the perimeter,
and back into the centre. This
operation relieves the metal ot
various stresses, tightens it like the
face of a drum, and gives a near
perfect flat surface.
Polishing . This vital operation
gives Silverware its beautiful finish.
About three-quarters of the polish-
ing is done before Plating. The
original Nickel Silver sheet has a
comparatively rough surface, and
the operations of Drafting, Spin-
ning, Hammering, Soldering, etc.,
do not improve it.
Polishing is broken up into three
separate stages. Firstly the article
is Emeryed. Fine Emery Powder,
a cutting compound, is glued on to
the face of a felt polishing wheel,

a sand almost as tine as powder, is
imported from the hed ot the River
Trent in England. A little oil is
mixed with the sand, and the
Polisher feeds the sand with one
hand between the article and a
leather polishing wheel. This
leather wheel, by the w ay, is usually
made of Rhinoceros hide. Trent
Sanding is the most important and
difficult stage in Polishing. Many
different sizes and shapes of polish-
ing wheels are used. For instance,
to “nick in beside a wire mount
where the ordinary wheel would
not reach, a wheel with a sharp
edge is employed. Trent Sand is
used by the leading manufacturers
in England, but is much less
common in Australia. ‘Stokes
Silverware’ is always polished by
this means. It is the best method
known of achieving a high and
lasting finish.
Mopping is the last Polishing stage
before Plating. Soft cloth mops or
wheels are used to give a final
bright finish to the surface.
Polishing is a lengthy' hand opera-
tion, and an expensive one. How-
ever there are no short cuts if a
faultless surface is required.
Plating follows Polishing. The

care, as the smallest trace of dirt

or grease will cause the plate to lift.
Plating is the operation wherebv
a skin or layer of Pure Silver is
deposited over the Nickel Silver
hase metal. The article is hung in
a bath of Silver Cyanide, a highly
poisonous solution, the colour of
weak milkless tea ! Adjacent
to the article, or Cathode, are thick
sheets or strips of Pure Silver.
These are called the Annodes. A
current of electricitv is passed
between the Annodes and the
article, which results in the Silver
in the solution being gradually
deposited on to the article. The
Silver thus taken from the solution
is replaced bv the Annodes.

Actually there is another factor in
addition to the weight of the
Deposit, and that is its hardness.
Hardness is influenced by the
grain size of the Silver —the finer
the grain deposited, the harder
the surface —but we are encroach-
ing too far into the Metallurgist’s
field.
The accepted thickness of the
silver deposit on high quality do-

heavy enough to last halt a life-
time. The reputation of the manu-
facturer is the best safeguard, and
of course the article’s price usually
gives a sound indication of its
general quality.
For a manufacturer to be com-
pletely confident of his Silver
Deposits, he should do these things.
Firstly he must adopt as his
standard a very heavy deposit ol

amount of Silver necessary for
each different article he makes.
(The calculations take into con-
sideration the outside and inside
areas of the piece, the duty it will
perform, etc.). And lastly, close
supervision is necessary to ensure
that the calculated deposit actually
goes on to each article. This is
checked by w eighing articles before
and after Plating —their gain in
weight being the amount of the
Silver deposited.
The last operation is called Finish-
ing—putting the final high finish
on the silver just deposited.
After Plating each article is cleaned
in hot and cold water swills and
dried in hot Saw dust. The Finisher
uses a polishing lathe similar to
the Polishers, but the polishing

In addition to these general points
you will find it helpful to have at
your fingertips a few easily remem-
bered points about the article
itself. Here are four you can use
—providing you are referring to a
high quality piece of Silverware :
1. The heavy weight and excel-

2. The very heavy deposit of
Pure Silver, ensuring many

3. The perfect Polish or finish

these four points, and as you do so,

To keep Silverware at itA SseAt
people believe that cleaning silverware is a real problem. It
need not be so. Many of your customers will appreciate your advice
on this point.
The best way to keep your silver-
ware bright may be summed up in
two simple words—USE IT. Con-
tinuous use avoids tarnishing.
When you hear a woman say ”1
love my silver but it’s so hard to
keep it clean,” you are almost sure
to find the trouble lies in the fact
that she uses it only on special
occasions.
It is Sulphur and its compounds
that usually cause a tarnished ap-
pearance in silverware. These
compounds are found in coal, gas,
a sooty atmosphere, rubber and
even the moisture from the hand.
If you use your silverware daily
and wash it afterwards in hot
soapy water, it will be kept at its
best. When washing up after a
meal, wash your silverware first,
then the glassware, and lastly the
plates, etc. By washing in this
order your silverware will not
come into contact with grease, and
the finish will be all the brighter.
Rinse in clean hot water before
drying with a soft dry cloth. The
rinsing is more important than
one might think, for silverware
dried out of soapy water will
tarnish quicker than silverware
that has been carefully rinsed in
hot water after washing.
Occasionally the silverware should
be cleaned with a reputable silver
polish to restore its natural lustre.
Use a discarded toothbrush to
remove the polish left in the
crevices of a heavily ornamented
piece.
Owing to its nature, some silver-
ware can only be used occasionally.
Most of your silverware however
has a daily use, so use it every day.
Its appearance will be all the better
when those special occasions come
along.


Cop light Selling
Every Salesman who is worth his
salt is constantly seeking new and
better ways to increase his sales.
One of the peculiar things about
people, whether they are salesmen
or not, is this; once they discover
a way to get by, they are all too
frequently content to follow the
course of least resistance.
A famous Scientist hit the nail on
the head when he said, “It is
extraordinary the lengths to which
a person will go to save himself
the trouble of thinking.”
But let’s be specific. Let’s observe
how in selling, the measure of
one’s thinking is also the measure
of one’s individual success.
Salesmanship
at its lowest I £eoel
Into a Jeweller’s shop comes a
customer. We’ll call her Mrs.
Williams. She is approached by
the nearest salesman—whom, for
convenience, we will call Sales-
man A.
Salesman A says Good morning.
Can I do anything for you ? Mrs.
Williams replies, Yes, thank you,
I want to buy a fountain pen. And
the sale begins . . .
Salesman A brings out several
fountain pens of different makes
. . . tells her, in response to a
query, that they are all pretty
much alike . . . stands by while the
customer eventually selects the
pen she wants.
Note that Salesman A makes no
effort to explain the advantages of
any particular pen ... no effort
to sell the customer top quality
at a higher price . . . and no effort
to interest the customer in other
lines of merchandise.
In other words, Salesman A has
merely waited on his customer and
in so doing has demonstrated
Salesmanship at its lowest level.
But let us continue with our
story . . .
Salesmanship
at the Second i £eoel
Mrs. Williams starts to leave the
shop, but pauses to examine several
articles attractively displayed in a
showcase. Salesman B now ap-
proaches, and asks the question,
Can I help in any way. Madam.
Mrs. Williams thinks not —she has
to buy a Wedding Present in the
near future, but has not yet made


up her mind.
Why not give a piece of silvenvare ?
asks Salesman B —whereupon he
quickly presents the reasons why
silverware is particularly desirable,
enquires if the b edding present is
for a particular friend, makes a
number of specific suggestions and
skilfully narrows the customer s
choice to a single piece. And he
makes the sale.
Salesman B has demonstrated
salesmanship of a much higher
order than that displayed by
Salesman A, but even this better
sale is of a sort that thousands of
salesmen are making every' day of
their lives . . .

Again Mrs. Williams starts to
leave, but before she reaches the
door she is met by Mr. Anderson,
the Proprietor.
Anderson ; Good morning, Mrs.
Williams. How are the children ?
Mrs. Williams : Splendid, thank
you.
A. : I saw Bill at golf on Saturday
—in fact he won the three guineas
trophy order. He said you are
moving into your house this tveek.
Mrs. W. : Yes —We are very thrilled
about it. We are having a house-
warming party next week to cele-
brate.
A. ; l\o wonder you are excited.
Talking about your party, we hare
just unpacked a very attractive cold
water jug. It is a Stokes Silverware
reproduction piece. Would you
care to see it ?
Mrs. \\ . : Yes thank you.
(Anderson leads the way to his
office. The jug is standing on his
desk).
A. : It came in this morning. It is
a beautiful example of Old Sheffield
Reproduction —and an exact match
with the Ice Bucket you bought
last year.
Mrs. W. : It is a nice jug.
(Anderson hands it to her. She
examines it critically).
A. : It occurred to me that you and
Bill might consider putting that
trophy order towards it—much better
than a cup. It would cost you only
an additional £7/2/- in that case.
Mrs. W. : It is rather tempting.
But the thought of the cleaning
worries me.
A. : It should not, Mrs. Williams.
When a customer tells me that her
cleaning is a problem, I always know
that she is not making full use of
her silverware. Good silverware, like
this, is made to be used daily. And
by using it frequently it will not
tarnish to any extent. After use,
wash it in hot soapy water, and
rinse under the hot tap, and dry
with a clean cloth. You will find


it will rub up beautifully, and will
only need a polish note and again.
An old tooth brush will get the polish
out of the decoration very easily.
Mrs. W. : I II remember that—it is
a charming jug, but much more
expensive than the usual type you
see in the shops.
A. : It is, but it is in rather a
different class. It is made by Stokes,
who made the wedding presents
Australia gave Princess Elizabeth in
1947. Technically speaking, the
quality is as high as you can get
anywhere, including England. No
money has been spared in its manu-
facture. For instance, the silver
deposit is such that you can use it
day in and day out for several
decades, and it will still look just
the same. It is not expensive—its
valuable. And it will long outlast
china and crystal.
There are many other points about
it—some more obvious to the naked
eye. Note the perfect finish, even
around the handle, and up to the
grape vine mount.
The grape vine itself is an excellent
example of good workmanship. You
will see how every minute detail is
faithfully reproduced.
Mrs. W. : Yes, it is. What period
reproduction is it ?
A. : George 111. The silversmith
ivas probably at his greatest height
at that time. The jug looks well
even in this office. It will be even
more striking in your new home.
Good silverware is the ideal back-
ground for entertaining. A piece
like this will certainly attract the
notice of your friends —and give
you and Bill great pleasure every
time you use it.
Mrs. W. : I can't resist it, Mr.
Anderson. Can I take it now ?

on customers —waits for the cus-
tomer to take all the initiative.
If, on the other hand, he chooses
to be on the second level, as
Salesman B, he will no longer
merely talk, but will say something.
Note that Salesman B turned a
potential sale for a Wedding
Present into an actual one. He
suggested Silverware as an ideal
Wedding Present, and after making
a number of specific suggestions,
narrowed the customer’s choice
down to a single piece—and a
satisfactory sale resulted.
None of us, however, is likely to be


satisfied with salesmanship which
is not on the highest level. Con-
sider some of the things that dis-
tinguish top-flight selling from
selling of the lower levels.
If you look hack on how Anderson
handles the sale, you will notice
that from the moment he greeted
Mrs. Williams by name, he. and
not the customer, directed the
interview from start to finish.
He made the opportunity for a
sale where apparently one did not
exist. He used the mention of a
house warming party as an initial
appeal, anil the tropin order as an
additional one.
Vi hen presenting the matter to Mrs.
Vi illiams. he did not limit tin-
appeal to the article itself, its
technical excellence.
Bv various means he brought for-
ward four major selling appeals
The Prestige of the article.
Its Beauty.
Its Usefulness.
Its Value.
Note each small point he used to
emphasize each main heading :
Antique Silver Coffee Pots and Juss, made in London between the years
1765 and 1790.


One of the four Sterling Silver wedding presents Stokes made in 1947 for
Princess Elizabeth, on behalf of the Government and People of Australia.
< ~Preatige
1. An Old Sheffield Reproduction piece.
2. By Stokes, who made Princess Elizabeth’s edding Presents.
3. The design was Geo. 11l period —one of the most famous silver-
ware periods of all.
4. The admiration of friends.
beauty
5. “ a beautiful example of Old Sheffield Reproduction."
6. The perfect finish throughout.
7. The magnificent detail of the grape vine mount.
8. The jug would look even more beautiful in the customer's home.
‘'litelulnedd
9. “ much better than a cup.”
10. Cleaning is very simple with regular use.
11. It was designed for dailv use.


9t<» c Ualue
12. The jug was the highest quality obtainable anywhere.
13. “ it’s not expensive—it’s valuable.”
14. It carried a very heavy deposit of silver.
15. It would outlast China and Crystal.
16. The permanent pleasure it would give whenever used.
During the interview, the customer
brought up two difficulties —the
cleaning of Silverware, and its
cost. Anderson handled these two
points briefly, practically, and
satisfyingly, and immediately
swung back into his main sales
plan.
Summing up, we have tried to
illustrate the contrast between
Top Flight selling and salesman-
ship at its lower levels. Which
category are you in ? You will
know the answer. If you are not
yet in the highest category, a well-
conducted plan as used by Ander-
son, the hypothetical Jeweller, will
be a big help to you in reaching
your target.
trooff/tucA


A.l.
The mark A.l is often found after ‘EPNS’ on an article,
intending to signify a certain standard of quality.
This particularly applies to the weight of the silver
deposit of flatware. A heavy deposit was marked
‘A.l’, a medium deposit ‘A’, etc. Today the mark has
little or no significance, as it may be found alike on
good and poor quality silverware. The reputation of
the maker is the best guide.
ALLOY.
A metal resulting from the mixture of two or more
metals.
APPLIED
BORDER.
A cast or rolled wire border or edge soldered on an
article. (See Mount).
ASSAYING.
The process of determining the fineness or the con-
stituents of a metal or alloy.
BRIGHT
FINISH.
The finish that imparts to Silverware a highly polished,
mirror-like surface.
BRITANNIA
METAL.
Britannia metal is made of a soft base metal, silver
plated. The base metal is an alloy of tin, antimony
and copper.
BUTLER
FINISH.
A softer finish than the bright finish. It is sometimes
known as Grey Finish or French Grey Finish. It
lends itself well to reproduction silverware, as it
simulates the lustre of old silver, hand polished by
generations of butlers. Butler Finish is very popular
on the Continent and in the U.S.A.
CAST BORDER.
An applied border. See Mount.
CASTING.
The process of pouring molten metal into moulds and
so reproducing the models from which the molds were
made. The reproductions are called castings.
Silverware


CHASING.
Decoration done by hand with small tools and punches
forced into the metal with tappings by a hammer.
When flowers, scrolls, etc., are simply impressed into
flat surfaces it is called Flat Chasing. When the
ornamentation is brought up in high relief by driving
out the metal from the inside and then modelled back
into detailed form it is called Repousse Chasing.
CHUCK.
See Spinning.
CUTLERY.
Knives with a cutting edge (e.g., table, dessert, carving
knives).
DIE CUTTING
OR SINKING.
The process by which a design or pattern is cut out of
a piece of steel to form a “die” from which a quantity
of similar articles can be stamped out or impressed.
DOUBLE
PLATED, ETC.
“Double” or “Triple plate” are, in themselves, mean-
ingless terms and have no more value than the Marking
“A.l” or “Best Quality” on an article. They are
merely catch phrases.
The terms do not mean that the piece has two or three
coatings of silver applied, for the simple reason that a
deposit of Silver can be of any desired thickness with
one immersion in the plating bath. It would in fact,
be extremely foolish to plate one thickness of silver
over another, as the risk of the second coat lifting is
always present, and there would be no conceivable
advantage to offset this risk.
Where the actual weight of Silver is not marked on
the article, or otherwise known, the safest guide is the
price. The lower the price the lighter the Silver
deposit, size for size.
ELECTRO-
PLATING.
This process was patented in 1840, and is used in
making silver plated wares. By this process a layer of
silver is electrolytically desposited on a base metal.
(See Silver Plate).
EMBOSSING.
The process of decorating by striking or impressing
the metal with a die.
ENGINE
TURNING.
The process of decorating through means of a cutting
tool controlled by a craftsman following the design
which is applied to the surface from a master pattern
or stencil. This type of decoration, generally speaking,
is confined to toiletware, cigarette cases, etc.


ENGRAVING.
A process of hand decoration produced by cutting
into the surface of the metal with engraving tools.
EPNS.
Electro-plated Nickel Silver, or Silver Plate. Pure
silver deposited on to a Nickel Silver base metal.
ETCHING.
A process of decoration produced by what might be
properly called “chemical engraving.” (The surface
is covered with a protective coating through which the
desired design is cut and the design is eaten into the
metal by acid).
FINE SILVER.
The Element Silver—Pure Silver—1000 Fine.
FINISHING.
The Final polishing operation, which brings up the
lustre of the silver.
FLAT
CHASING.
Chasing where the pattern is not raised above the level
of the metal’s surface. The elfect is similar to that of
engraving.
FLATWARE.
The trade name for Spoons, Forks, etc. It does not
include Knives, which come under the heading of
Cutlery.
GERMAN
SILVER.
A term used some years ago for Nickel Silver. See
Nickel Silver.
GILDING.
The process of Electro-plating a layer of pure gold
on another metal.
HALL MARK.
The official mark of the Goldsmith’s Company or other
Assay Office or “Hall” in England, stamped on articles
of gold or silver to indicate their purity.
HOLLOW
WARE.
The general term applied to silverware such as dishes,
plates, teasets, candlesticks, salvers, salt shakers, etc.,
as distinguished from Cutlery and Flatware.
MOTIF.
The dominant feature of a design or establishment.
MOUNTS.
Small pieces of metal soldered on to the article for
decorative or strengthening reasons, or both. They
may take the form of rolled wire, castings and or
stampings.


NICKEL
SILVER.
A hard white non-ferrous metal—an alloy of copper,
zinc and nickel. In the case of EPNS articles it is
the base metal.
OXIDIZING.
Method of accentuating and enhancing the beauty
of ornament by converting some of the silver to its
oxide, which darkens the metal wherever applied.
Some methods of cleaning silver will remove this oxide.
PATINA.
The finish or surface texture. As applied to silver
it refers to the soft lustrous finish the metal acquires
with years of usage.
PEWTER.
Pewter is a soft metal, usually an alloy of tin and
lead. It was much used for tableware up to the nine-
teenth century, and is still popular today for such
articles as tankards.
PIERCING.
A form of decoration produced by cutting away parts
of the metal with cutting dies, punching tools, or in
the case of hand piercing, with a thin steel blade with
fine teeth.
RAW EDGE.
Term applied to Hollow Ware pieces the edge of
which has not been turned over or mounted with a
border.
REPOUSSE.
See Chasing.
ROLLED EDGE. An article is said to have a rolled edge when the metal
has been rolled over the edge and spun under or over
to give the effect of a rounded edge. The edge is effec-
tively strengthened by this process.
SAW PIERCE.
See Piercing.
SHEFFIELD
PLATE.
The original substitute for Sterling Silver, now dis-
placed by Silver Plate. It was made by fusing sheet
silver on to copper, rolling and manufacturing into
hollow ware. The discovery of the electrolytic process
of depositing silver on a base metal made it possible
to produce articles of similar quality to Sheffield at
lower cost and so the Sheffield Plate process was
abandoned (circa 1840). To-day, most fine pieces of
“Old Sheffield” are found in museums and private
collections and little is available in the commercial
market.


SILVER
PLATE.
Silverware made of a base metal such as Nickel Silver,
on which is deposited pure silver bv the Electro-
plating process. (See Electro-plating).
SILVER
SMITHING.
It was originally the art of shaping Sterling Silver by
hand into various articles. Now it is the general term
applied to the various crafts included in making
silverware. With advancing specialization in the
manufacture of silverware, the term has narrowed down
to cover specifically the crafts involved in shaping,
fitting and assembling the various parts of an article
into a complete piece.
SPINNING.
A method of forming or shaping pieces of hollow ware
by revolving a flat disc of metal over a piece of wood
or steel (Chuck) which has been made in the shape the
metal is to assume. By means of a hand tool, the
metal is spread over the rotating form, finally achieving
the desired shape.
SPOT
HAMMERING.
A form of decoration resulting from repeated taps on
the surface of the metal with a light hammer. A
somewhat similar effect is sometimes achieved by
stamping the surface with a die.
STAINLESS
STEEL.
An alloy composed mainly of steel, nickel and chromium
having generally greater strength than ordinary steel
and possessing unusually high resistance to corrosion,
tarnish, or stain by air, water and most acids.
STERLING
SILVER.
Sometimes referred to as “Solid Silver.” It consists
of 92.5 per cent Pure Silver, the balance being Copper.
Copper is added to give increased hardness and better
wearing qualities. Sterling Silver is silverware in its
highest form, but owing to its greater initial cost, it
is not so universally popular as Silver Plate.

stall <: l7lcirlzA
Some of your customers may be
interested in old silver. They may
ask you the age of a piece which
has been in their family for several
generations, or they may have
recently purchased a piece in an
auction and would like to know its
origin. They will be both pleased
and impressed if you can assist
them.
For these reasons the Hall Marks
of England’s three main Assay
Offices, London, Birmingham and
Sheffield, are reproduced here. For
those of you who are not familiar
with English Hall Marks, these are
the steps to follow in checking the
age and origin of a piece of Sterling:
1. Do the marks include a
“Lion passant” —a lion in the
horizontal position ? If so, it is
English Sterling.
2. One of the marks will prob-
ably show a Leopard’s Head, full
face, an Anchor, or a Crown. This
signifies the place where the article
was assayed :
The Leopard’s Head London
The Anchor Birmingham
The Crown Sheffield
If you locate one of these three
marks, we’ll say the Crown, you
will know it was made in Sheffield.
Therefore consult the list of Shef-
field marks for the Date Letter.
3. Each year a different alpha-
betical letter is used for the Date
Letter. Sometimes to avoid
possible confusion the full alphabet
is not employed. Find the Date
Letter listed, exactly correspond-
ing to the mark on the article. The
type of letter must be the same,
and so also the shape of the panel
around the letter. This will give
you the year of manufacture. The
shape of the other panels also vary
from period to period.
Here are several simple ways of
dating an article within a certain
period of years. For instance the
Leopard’s Head had a crown on it
up to the year 1820. After that
the crown was left off.
An article bearing the Anchor or
Crown was not made before 1773,
the year the Birmingham and
Sheffield Assay Offices commenced.
Another indication is the extra
mark of a King or Queen’s Head.
From 1784 to 1837-39 George Ill’s
or George IV’s Head was used.
Queen Victoria’s Head then ap-
peared until 1890.
The last mark is usually that of the
maker. These, unfortunately, are
too numerous to show here. The
late Sir Charles J. Jackson’s book,
“English Goldsmiths and their
Marks,” gives extensive lists of
makers’ names and marks from the
year 1090.
Several other Assay Offices are in
existence, and there have been
many major and minor Guilds
over the last 500 years. However
the marks of the three main ones
listed, London, Birmingham and
Sheffield, are those with which
you are most likely to come in
contact.
