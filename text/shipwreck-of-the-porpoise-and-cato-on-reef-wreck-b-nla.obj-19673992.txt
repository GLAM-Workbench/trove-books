Shipwreck of the Porpoise and Cato on Reef-Wreck Bank,
Australasia.
[From Captain Funder’s Voyage to Terra Australis.]
(t r\N July 20, lieutenant Fowler
quitted the Investigator, with
the crew selected for him, and took
the command of his Majesty’s armed
vessel Porpoise; and on the following
day I went on board with the rest
of my officers and people, to go with
Iwm as passengers. Amongst other
preparations for the voyage, a green
house wa* set up on the quarter deck
of that ship ; and the plants collected
jo the Investigator from the south,
fhe east, and north coasts of Terra
Australis were deposited in it, to be
conveyed to his Majesty’s botanical
garden at Kew j and as we had had
the misfortune to lose the gardener of
the expedition, and Mr Brown, the
naturalist, remained behind, a man
from Port Jackson was engaged to
take care of the plants during the
passage.
** The examination of Torres’
Strait was one of the most im-
portant articles of my instructions
which had been executed only in
part j and though I could not pre-
tend to make any regular survey 'n
the Porpoise, it was yet desirable to
pass again through the strait, and
lay down as many of its dangers at
circumstances would admit; and this
being represented to governor King,
the following paragraph was made
-an article in lieutenant Fowler’s or-
ders, ' The objects which captain
* Flinders will have to finish in his
‘ rout through Torres’ Strait, requires
( that he should be assisted with
* boats, people, and have the entire
* direction of the sh>p as to the
‘ courses she is to steer, making and
' shortening sail, anchoring, and
‘ every other prompt attention to his
r directions as connected with his
‘ survey. You are therefore further
‘ required to comply with every di-
* rection he may give you, to enable
* him to execute the orders of my
* Lords Commissioners of the Ad-
* miralty j and as it will be ncces-
* sary that the most expeditious route
' should be followed, for the por-
' pew of ascertaining the length ef
‘ time


‘ time it will take to make the voy-
* age from hence to England, by
f Torres’ Strait, and to enable cap-
‘ tain Flinders to be in England as
‘ early as possible, you will take
‘ especial care to lose no time in
* getting to England by the route
e captain Flinders may indicate.’
“ In the beginning of August, the
Porpoise was nearly rfeady to sail;
and two ships then lying in Sydney
Cove, bound to Batavia, desired leave
to accompany us through the Strait.
These were, the Hon, East-India-
Company’s extra-ship Bridgewater,
of about 750 tons, commanded by
E. H. Palmer, Esq., and the ship
Cato of Eondon, of about 450 tons,
commanded by Mr. John Park.
The company of these ships gave
me pleasure; for if,we should be
able to make a safe and expeditious
passage through the strait with them,
of which 1 had but little doubt, it
would be a manifest proof of the
advantage of the route discovered in
the Investigator, and tend to bring
it into general use. On the xoth I
took leave of my respected friend
the governor of New South Wales,
and received his dispatches for Eng-
land ; and lieutenant Fowler having
given a small code of signals to the
Bridgewater and Cato, we sailed
out of Port Jackson together, at
eleven o’clock of the same 1 morn-
ing, and steered north-eastward for
Torres’ Strait.
“ Mr. Inman had re-delivered to
me the two time keepers, with a
table of their rates deduced from
equal altitudes, but the No. 543
had gone so very irregularly,-as not
to be entitled to any confidence; the
error of No. :io from mean Green-
wich tune at noon there on the 2d,
and its rate of going during the
twenty-five preceding days were as
yjndfr;
“ Earnshaw's No. 520, fast, o h
49' 54 ,r > 85 losing 33", 38 per
day.
“ The winds were light, and
mostly from the eastward daring the
first two days of our quitting Port
Jackson ; and not being able to get
far enough from the land to avoid
the southern current, it had retarded
us 35' on the lath at noon, when
the islands of Port Stephens were
in sight. On the following day the
wind became more steady in the
the south-western quarter, and as
our distance from the land increased,
the current abated ; and on the 15th,
when the latitude was 27 0 27', lon-
gitude 156° 22', and distance from
the coast about fifty leagues, the set
was something in our favour. The
Wind was then at south, and our
course steered was north for twenty-
four hours, then N. by W.; and
on the 17th at noon we were in la-
titude 23 0 22', longitude 155° 34',
and had the wind at S. E. by S.
“ Soon after two o’clock, the Cato
being some distance on our larbord
quarter made the sign al for seeing
land. This proved to be a dry sand
bank, which bore S- S. W. about
three leagues; and the Porpoise sail-
ing faster than the other ships, they
were directed to keep on their course
whilst we hauled up to take a nearer
view of the bank. At three o’clock,
when it bore S. by E. five or six
miles, we hove to and sounded, but
had no bottom at 80 fathoms. The
Cato's Bank, for. so it was named, is
small and seemed to be destitute of
vegetation ; there was an iftnume-
rable quantity of birds hovering
about, and it was surrounded with
breakers; but their extent seeitied
very little to exceed that of the bank,
nor could any other reef near it be
discovered. The situation was ascer-
tained to be nearly 23° 6 / scu-th, and


155° 23* fast; and we then made
sail after the Bridgewater and Cato,
to take our station a-head of them
as before.
<f Some apprehensions were ex-
cited for the following night by
meeting with this bank; but as it
was more than two degrees to the
eastward of the great Earner Reefs,
we thought it unconnected with any
other, like the two discovered by
captain Ball and Mr. Bampton, fur-
ther towards the north end of New
Caledonia. 1 bad, besides, steered
for Torres’ Strait in the Investigator,
from reefs severaldegreestothe west-
ward, , without meeting with any
other danger than what lay near the
Barrier or belonged to the Strait;
and by the time we had rejoined
the ships in the evening, the dis-
tance run from the bank was thirty-
five miles, and no other danger had
been descried. It did not therefore
seem necessary to lose a good night’s
run by heaving to; and I agreed
with lieutenant Fowler, that it would
be sufficient to make the-signal for
the ships to run under easy, work-
ing sail during the night,—to take
our usual station a-head, —and to
charge one of the Investigator's war-
rant officer’s with the look-out on
the fore castle. These precautions
being taken, and the top sails double
reefed, our course was pursued to
the N. by W., with a fresh breeze
and cloudy weather; and at eight
o’clock the lead was cast, but no
bottom found at 35 fathoms. The
Bridgewater was then about half a
mile on the starbord, and the Cato a
mile on the larbord quarter; and
their distance seeming to increase at
nine, when our rate of going was
eight knots, the foresail was hauled
up to keep them in sight: wind then
at S. E. by E.
ft In half an hour, and almost at
the same instant by the Investigator’s
carpenter on the forecastle, and the
master who had charge of the watch
on the quarter deck, —breakers were
seen a-head. The helm was imme-
diately put down, with the intentioa
of tacking from them ; but the Por-
poise havingon!) three double-reefed
top sails set, scarcely came up to the
wind. Lieutenant Fowler sprang
upon deck, on hearing the noise;
but supposing it to be occasioned by
-carrying away tiie tiller rope, a cir-
cumstance which had often occurred
in the Investigator, and having no
orders to give, I remained some mi-
nutes longer, conversing with the
gentlemen in the gun room. On
going up, 1 found the sails shaking
in the wind, and the ship in the aet
of paying off; at the same tims
there were very high breakers at not
a quarter of a cable’s length to
leeward. In about a minute, the
ship was carried amongst the break-
ers; and striking upon a coral reef,
took a fearful heel over on her lar-
bord beam ends, her head being
north-eastward. A gun was at-
tempted to be. fired,'to warn the
other vessels of the danger; but
owing to the violent motion and the
heavy surfs flying over, this could
not be done immediately; and be-
fore lights were brought up, the
Bridgewater and Cato had hauled to
the wind across each other.
“ Our fore mast was carried away
at the second or third shock; and
the bottom was presently reported to
be stove in, and the hold full of wa-
ter. When the surf permitted us to
look to windward,- the Bridgewater
and Cato were perceived at not more
than a cable’s length distance; and
approaching each other so closely,
that their running aboard seemed to
us inevitable. This was an awful
moment 3 the utmost silence pre-
vailed ;


vailed ; and when the bows of the
two ships went to meet, even respi-
ration seemed to be suspended. The
ships idvanced, and we expected to
hear ihe dreadtul crash; but pre-
sent’y they opened off from each
other, having parsed side by side
without touching; the Cato steer-
ing to the north-east, and the Bridg-
water to the southward. Our own
safety seemed to have no other de-
pendence than upon the two ships,
and the exultation we felt at seeing
this most imminent danger passed,
was great, but of short duration ;
the Cato struck upon the reef about
two cable* length from the Porpoise:
we saw her fall over on her broad
side, and the masts almost instantly
disappeared ; but the darkness of
the night did not admit of distin-
guishing, at that distance, what fur-
thermight have happened.
“ Turning our eyes toward the
Bridgewater, a light was perceived
at her mast bead, by which we
knew she bad cleared the reef; and
our first sensations were, that the
commander would Certainly tack,
and send boats to our assistance ;
but when a little reflexion Had ena-
bled us to put ourselves in his place.
It became evident that he would not
choose to come so near the reef in
the night, blowing fresh as it did ;
and still less to send his boats and.
people into the breakers, to their
certain destruction.
“ The Porpoise bad very fortu-
nately heeled towards the reef; so
that the surfs which struck against
her turned-up side, flew over with-
out washing off the decks ; and the
smooth appearance of the water
under the lee, afforded a prospect
oi being *ble. to get the boats ou't on
tbit side. The experiment was tried
with a small four-oared gig, and
succeeded; but a six-oared cutler
was jerked against the sheet anchor
by the violence of the shocks, and
being stove, was filled with water.
“ It was by no means certain how
long the ship, being slightly built,
and pot in a sbund state, might hold
together; it was therefore deemed
expedient to lighten her, that she
might drive, further up the coral
bank and lib more easily. On sound-
ing, the depth was found' to be 17
fathoms on the windward side;, but
no more than a few feet on the reef;
and Mr, Fowler ordered the main
and mizen masts, and the starbord
anchor to be cut away ; but on my
suggesting to him the possibility of
driving over the reef, with the rise
of tide, and sinking in deep water
as the Pandora had done, the light-
ening of the ship was not prosecuted
further.
, Beyond the smooth water close
under the lee, there was a line of
breakers, and further on the sea ap-
peared to be tranquil; it therefore
seemed probable that boats might
approach the ship on that side, and
if this information could be con-
veyed tocaptain Palmer ofthe Bridg-
water, that something might be
speedily clone towards saving the
crew ; and as it was likely that my
influence with him mightbegreatest,
and being a passenger in the
poise, no charge made my presence
on board immediately necessary, I
proposed to make the attempt in the
gig, to which Mr. Fowler assented.
The boat being obliged to lie at a
little di'tancetrom the ship, to pre-
vent being stove, I jumped over-
board and swam to her; and we
pushed through the breakers to the
smooth water, receiving t wo or three
surfs by the way, from which we
hardly escaped sinking On exa-
mining the condition of the boat, I
found nothing to bale out the water,
and


and only two oars which did not be-
long to it; and instead of the pro-
per crew of font - men, theie were
only three; but under the thwaits
were stoyved away three others, the
armourer, a cook, and a marine,
who.did not know how to handle an
oar. These last were set to baling
with their hats and shoes, and we
rowed towards the Bridgewater’s
light, keeping under the lee of the
breakers. That ship was standing
from us, and I saw that any attempt
to get nearer before she tacked would
be fruitless; and even afterwards, it
was much to be doubted whether,
with two awkward oars and an over-
loaded boat, we could make any
way against the sea on the windward
side of the reef; I therefore deter-
mined to remain under the lee of the
breakers until she should approach,
and to lie near the Porpoise; that
in case of her going in pieces before
morning, we might save some of the
the cutter, which the men in her,
having got the leak partly stopped,
bad pushed off without an officer,
and were going they scarcely knew
whither: they furnished us with a
third oar, and I desired them to
keep close, to thegig, near the wreck,
Utotil morning. We found the bot-
tom here to be coral rock, and the
water so shallow, that a man might
stand up in many places without
being over head.
*■* I wished to have got on board
the. ship, ,to let them know of the
boats being safe and what we had dis-
covered of the reef; but the break-
ers between us, and the darkness of
the night cut off all hope of com-
munication before morning. They
burned blue lights every half hour,
as a guide tcy the Bridgewater; but
her light was lost to us in the boats
at eleven o'clock, and after two in the
morning if was no longer seen from
the Porpohe At that time it appeared
to be low water, and the ship lay so
much more quiet than before, that
the apprehension of her seeing to
pieces before day light had much
subsided ; to be prepared, however,
for the next flood, Mr. Fowler em-
ployed his people during the night
in making a raft of the spare top
masts, yards, &c., with short ropes
all round it, by which the people
misht hold on ; and a.cask or water,
with a chest containing some pro-
visions, 'a sextant, and the Inves-
tigator’s log books, were secured
upon the raft.
“ Jn the small gig we were quite
drenched, the south-east wind blew
tfesh and cold, and the reflexions
excited by the great change so sud-
denly made in our situation, with
the uncertainty of what had befallen
the Cato and even the Bridgewater,
did not tend to make this long night
pass more agreeably. My thoughts
were principally occupied in devis-
ing plans for saving ourselves, under
the apprehension that we might see
no more of the Bridgewater; but
not to discourage the people, I spoke
of every body getting on board that
ship in the morning, and’ of con-
tinuing our voyage to England, as
not at all doubtful.
“ Of the poor Cato, wc could
neither see nor hear any thing. It
appeared that captain Park, when
meeting the Bridgewater on oppo-
site tacks, stopped setting his main-
sail and bore away to leeward ; had
he persevered, both ships must bav«
come upon the reef together; bKi
by his presence of mind on this oc-
casion, the Bridgewater weathered
the breakers and escaped the sie>
pending danger. Whm ihr, Cat*#
struck the reef, it was upon the
point of a rock, wider the htrbertl


chess tree 3 and she fell over to
windward, With her decks exposed
to the waves. In a short lime the
decks and holds were torn up, and
every thing washed away; and the
sole place left, where the unfortunate
people could hope to avoid the fury
of the sea, was in the larbord fore
channel, where they all crowded
together, the greater part with no
other covering than their shirts.
Every time the sea struck the Cato,
it twisted her about upon the rock
with such violent jerks, that th y
expected the stern, which was down
in the water, would part every
moment. In this situation, some
lashing themselves to the timber
heads, others clinging to the chain
plates and dead eyes, and to each
other, captain Park and his crew
passed the night; their hope being,
that the fore castle of the ship might
hold upon the rock till morning, and
that the Bridgewater,would then send
her boats to save them. From the
Porpoise they entertained no hope 3
and until the signal lights were seen,
they thought her gone to pieces.
“ At the first dawning of day, I
got on board the Porpoise by the help
of the fallen masts. Every body was
in good spirits at seeing the ship bold
together so well, and finding the
boats safe; for the gig, with all in
her, had been given up for lost, some
one haying thought he saw her sink
in the breakers. With the day-light
appeared a dry sand bank, not more
than half a mile distant, sufficiently
large to receive us all with what
provisions might be got out of the
ship; and the satisfaction arising
from this discovery was increased by
the Bridgewater being perceived
under sail, and though distant, that
she was standing towards the reef.
On the other side, the'appearance
of the poor Cato, with the people
waving to us from the bowsprit ant!
forecastle, the only parts above wa-
ter, was truly distressing.
“ The reef seemed to be a mile in
breadth, and it extended in an east
and west direction to a distance be-
yond what could be distinguished
from the Porpoise’s deck 3 but there
were in it several wide, and appa-
rently deep openings, by which the
Bridgewater might run to leeward,
and there anchor or lie to, whilst
sending her boats to our assistance.
Having made these remarks, I left
Mr. Fowler and his people getting
up water and provisions 3 and went
to the bank for the purpose cf being
ready to go off in the gig so soon as
that ship should be near enough, and
pointing out to captain Palmer the
means by which he might take on
board the two crews and whaf else
might be saved 3 but he went upon
the other tack soon afterward, and
no more was seen of him daring the
day.
(C A number of sea-birds eggs
scattered over the bank, showed that
it was above' high-water mark, and
I sent the gig back with this intel-
ligence to lieutenant Fowler. Seeing
that the Bridgewater did not ap-
proach, he ordered the boat to lie'
opposite to the Cato; and captain
Park and his men, throwing them-
selves into the water with any pieces
of spar or plank they could find,
swam to her through the breakers;
and were then taken to the Porpoise,
where they received food and some
clothing. Several wfcre bruised
against the coral rocks, and three
young lads were drowned. One of
these poor boys, who, in the three
or four voyages he had made to sea,
had been each time shipwrecked,
bad bewailed himself through the
night as the persecuted Jonas who
carried misfortune wherever he went.
He


He launched himself upon a broken
spar with 'his captain; but having
lost his, hold in the breakers, was
not seen afterwards.
i( At-low water, which happened
about two o’clock, the reef was dry
very near to the Porpoise, and both
officers and men were assiduously
employed in getting upon it pro-
visions and their clothes ; they were
brought from thence by the boats,
for the depth was several feet at a
distance round the bank. Before
dark, five half hogsheads of water,
some flour, salt, meat, rice, and spi-
rits were landed, with such of the
pigs and sheep as had escaped drown-
ing ; and every man from both ships
had got on shore. Some of the
Cato’s sailors appeared in officers
uniforms, given to them in the Por-
poise ; and I was pleased to see that
our situation was not thought so bad
by the people, a? to binder all plea-
santry upon these promotions. Those
who had saved great coats or blank-
ets shared with the less fortunate,
and we laid down to sleep'on the
sand in tolerable tranquillity, being
much oppressed with fatigue; and
except from those of the Cato’s men
who had been bruised or cut by the
rocks, there was not a complaining
voice heard on the bank.
“ The Porpoise’s two cutters and
the gig were hauled up to high-water
mark ; but the latter not having
been well secured, and the night
tide rising higher than was expected,
it was carried away, lo our great
■loss. In the morning, we had the
satisfaction to see the ship si ill entire,
and throwm higher up the reef; the
Cato had gone to pieces, and all
that remained was one of the quar-
ters, which had floated over the
front ledge of the reef, and lodged
near our bank. Of the Bridgewater
'nothing could be seen ; and many
fears were entertained for her safety.
ff For the better preservation of
discipline, and of that union be-
tween the crews of the Porpoise and
Cato, and passengers of the Inves-
tigator, so necessary in our circum-
stances, it was highly expedient that
they should be put on the same foot-
ing and united under one head.
The Porpoise was lost beyond a pos-
sibility of hope, and the situation of
the commander and cre.w thereby
rendered similar to that of their pas-
sengers ; I therefore considered my-
self authorised and called upon, as
the senior officer, to take the com-
mand of the whole; and my inten-
tion being communicated to lieu-
tenant Fowler, he assented, without
hesitation to its expediency and pro-
priety, and I owe to captain Park a
similar acknowledgement. The peo-
ple were then assembled upon the
top of the bank ; and 1 informed the
seamen of the Cato, one or two of
whom had shown signs of discontent
at being ordered to work, that as
they doubtless expected to be led
from our provisions, so they must
exert themselves to save as much as
possible ; and although they were
not in the king’s pay, yet as a ma-
gistrateacting within thejurisdiction
of the Admiralty, I would punish all
deviations from obedience and good
conduct in them, thesameas amongst
our own seamen. I ordered the
Cato’s'men, who had saved nothing,
to be quartered in the raesses of our
people, in the proportion of one to
three; and directed lieutenant' Fo-
wler, who had charge of the provi-
sions, to victual all alike. The sur-
geon of the Porpoise was ordered to
examine the wounded, and give in a
list of those really incapable of duty;
and a'large parly, consisting of as
many men as the two cutters could
contain, went off to the wreck under
the command of Mr. Fowler, to
disembark provisions and stores.
•’ A


" A top-sail yard was set up and
secured as a flag staff on the highest
part of the bank, and a large blue
ensign hoisted to it with the union
downward, as a signal to the Bridge-
waiter. We expected, if no acci-
dent bad happened, that she would
come to relieve ui from our critical
situation so soon as the wind should
be perfectly moderate; but I judged
it most prudent to act as if we had
bo such resource, and this was jus-
tified by the event. Captain Palmer
Bad even then abandoned us to our
fate, and was, at the moment,
steering away for Batavia, without
having made any effort to give us
assistance. He saw the wrecks, as
also the sand bank, on the morning
after our disaster, and most have
known that the reef was not at all con-
nected, since it is spoken of by him
as lying in patches: but he did not
seek to ascertain whether any of the
openings were passable for the
Bridgewater, and might enable him
to lake those on board who had
escaped drowning. He bore away
round all; and whilst the two-hap-
less vessels were still visible from
the mast head, passed the leeward
extremity of the reef, and hove to
for the night. The apprehension of
danger <0 himself must then have
ceased ; but he neither attempted to
work up in the smooth water, nor
sent any of his boats to see whether
some unfortunate individuals were
not clinging to the wrecks, whom
he might snatch from the sharks or
save from a more lingering death;
it was safer, in his estimation, to
continue on his voyage, and publish
that we were all lost, as he did not
fail to do on his arrival in India,
“ The wind blew fresh from the
south-eastward on the 18th and 19th,
b,»t on the two following days it was
Moderate with fine weather. We
worked hard on board the Porpoise*,
and by the 22nd had got most of the
water and provisions seemed in a
large tent made with spars and sails ;
each mess of officers and men had
also their private tent; and our man-
ner of living and working had as-
sumed the same regularity as before
the shipwreck. One of the men
whose liberty governor -King had
granted at my request, being guilty
of disorderly conduct, the articles
of war were publicly read, and the
man punished at the flag staff. This
example served to correct any evd
disposition, if such existed ; the men
worked cordially together, and in all
respects we preserved the same dis-
cipline and order as on board his
Majesty’s ships.
“ Our prospects of receiving suc-
cour from the Bridgewater having
become very feeble, after two days
of moderate weather had elapsed.,
I called a council of all the officers,
to deliberate upon the best means of
relieving ourselves from the preca-
rious situation in which our misfor-
tune, and captain Palmer’s want of
energy and humanity had left us
exposed ; and it was finally deter-
mined, that an officer and crew ia
the largest of the two six-o;.red cut-
ters, should endeavour to .get to
Sandy Cape, sixty-three leagues dis-
tant, and from thence along' she
coast to Port Jackson ■ and pray his
Excellency, the governor, to send
vessels to carry us either back to that
port or on towards England. But
as the safe arrival of the cutter at
that season of the year, when strong
winds usually prevail from the south-
ward, was a subject of much ap-
prehension; it was resolved (hat
two decked boats’, capable of trans-
porting every, person remaining on
the bank, except one officer and
boat's qrew, should be immediately


laid down by the carpenters, to be
built from what was already and
might be still further saved from the
wreck; and that, if the officer in the
cutter did not return with assistance
in two months, the boats should
then, or as soon after as they could
be ready to sail, proceed to Port
Jackson. The first and principal
means, however, through which our
deliverance was to be expected, be-
ing the safe arrival of the cutter, the
choice of an officer to conduct her
was next considered. Lieutenant
Fowler proposed, and it seemed to'
be the general wish, that 1 should
undertake the execution of the task ;
and being satisfied that the preser-
vation of order on the bank, and the
saving of the stores would be left in
good hands, the hope of being in-
strumental to the general safety in-
duced me readily to comply. But
to' provide against sickness and the
various accidents which might arise
from the natives of the coast or other-
wise, it was necessary that two offi-
cers should be in the boat; and cap-
tain Park of the Cato being desirous
of returning to Port Jackson, to
make the necessary statements rela-
tive to the loss of bis ship, he was
appointed my second with the gene-
ral approbation.
“ The smaller cutter with an offi-
cer, his second, and a boat’s crew,
I proposed should remain with the
stores, and in charge of my charts
and books for a few weeks longer
than the two months; and then go
to Port Jackson also, should no ves-
sel arrive before that time. This
precaution was necessary, lest any
unforeseen occurrence should delay
my return to the bank beyond two
months, though not prevent it al-
together; that the charts, journals,
and papers might still be found there,
to be taken on to England if wanted.
1914.
I designed my brother, lieutenant
Flinders, for this service; but Mr.
Fowler claiming it as the post of ho-
nour, I too much respected the
principle that influenced him not to
accede to his request; and there-
fore ordered; that the former officer
and Mr. John Aken, master of the
Investigator, should take charge of
the decked boats, with a master’s
mate in each capable of conducting
them to Port Jackson, should ill-
ness or any accident happen to either
of the officers.
“ By the evening of the 23d, the
Porpoise was well nigh emptied of
all the most essential things; and on
a survey being made, there was
found sufficient water and provisions
on the bank to serve ninety-four
men, which was our number, for
three months,' even at full allow-
ance; although ’many casks were
stove in the hold by the bulging of
the larbord side, and much dry pro-
visions spoiled by the salt water.
The principal contents of the war-
rant officers store rooms, as well as
the sails, rigging, and spars, were
also on shore. My books, charts,
and papers had suffered much'da-
mage, from the top of the cabin be-
ing displaced when the mizen mast
fell; all such papers as chanced to
be loose on the night of the ship-
wreck were then washed away by
the surfs, and amongst them a chart
of the west side of the Gulph of
Carpentaria and part of the North
Coast, upon which I had been oc-
cupied in the afternoon. Part of my
small library shared rhe same fate;
but the rest of the charts,with my log
and bearing books and astronomical
observations were all.saved, though
some of them in a wet and shattered
state. The rare plants collected on
different parts of the south, the east,
and north coasts of Terra Australis,
E for


for his Majesty’s botanic garden at
Kewj and which were in a flourish-
ing state before the shipwreck, were
totally destroyed by the salt water;
as were thedried specimens of plants.
Fortunately, the naturalist and na-
tural-history painter* who remained
at Port Jackson, had put on board
only a small part of their collection
of specimens; the great mass, with
the preserved birds, quadrupeds, and
insects being kept for a future op
portunity. Mr. Westall, the land-
scape painter, had his sketches and
drawings wetted and partly destroy-
ed in Lis cabin ; and my little col-
lection in mineralogy and concho-
logy was much defaced, and one-
half lost.
“ The carpenters were employed
until live evening of the 25th, in
preparing the cutter for her intended
expedition ; and the rest of the peo-
ple in adding to the stores on the
bank. As the Porpoi.se became
lighter, the sea threw her higher up
on the reef, and she was much
shaken; but we hoped the timber
and beams would together, at least
until the next spring tides, and that
every thing would be got out. Of
the Cato, nothing but a few scat-
tered fragments had remained for
several days before.
“ Before leaving Wreck Reef, it
will be proper to say something of
the sand bank to which we were all
indebted for our lives; and where
the greater part of the officers and
people were to remain in expecta-
tion of my return from Port Jackson.
In the annexed view of it, Mr.
Westall has represented the corals
above water, to give a better notion
of their forms and the way they are
seen on the reefs; but in reality, the
tide never leaves any considerable
part of them uncovered. The length
of the bank is about one hundred
and fifty fathoms, by fifty in breadth,
and the general elevation three or
four feet above the common level of
high water; it consists of sand and
pieces of coral, thrown up by .the
waves and eddy tides on a patch of
reef five or six miles in circuit; and
being nearly in the middle of the
patch, the sea does no more, even
in a gale, than send a light spray
over the bank, sufficient, however,
to prevent the growth of any other
than a few diminutive salt plants.
On its north and north west sides,
and at one or two cables length from
the reef, there is from 18 to 25 fa-
thoms on a bottom of coral sand;
where the Bridgewater might have
anchored in safety, so long as the
wind remained between S. W. and
E. S. E., and received every person
from the wrecks, with provisions for
their subsistence. The latitude of
the bank was found to be 22° iT
south, and longitude by the time
keeper No, 520, reduced up from
an observation on the afternoon .pre-
ceding the shipwreck, 155 0 3'.; but
this was afterwards found to require
correction. This excellent- time
keeper did not seem to have been
atfected by the violent motion of the
ship; but No. 543 stopped, and
Arnold’s watch No. 1736 was spoiled
by the salt water.
“ In searching for something
wherewith to make a fire on the
first night of our landing, a spar and
a piece of timber, worm eaten and
almost rotten, were found and burnt.
The timber was seen by the master
of the Porpoise, who judged it to
have been of the stern post pf
a ship of about four hundred tons;
and I have thought it might, not
improbably, have belonged to La
Boussole or L'Astrolabe. Monsieur
de la PerouSe, on quitting Botany
Bay, intended to visit the south-
west


west-coast of New Caledonia; and
he might have encountered in the
night, as we did, some one of the
several reefs which lie scattered in
this sea. Less fortunate than we
were, he probably had no friendly
sand bank near him, upon which his
people might be collected together,
and the means of existence saved
out of the ships ; or perhaps his two
vessels both took the unlucky di-
rection of the Cato after striking,
and the seas which broke into them
carried away all his boats and pro-
visions ; nor would La Perouse, his -
vessels, or crews be able, in such a
case, to resist the impetuosity of
the waves more than twenty-four
hours. If such were the end of the
regretted French navigator, as there
is now but too much reason to fear,
it is the counterpart of what would
have befallen all on board the Por-
poise and Cato, had the former ship,
like the Cato, fallen over towards the
sea instead of heeling .to the reef.
“ An opinion that La Perouse had
been lost in this neighbourhood, in-
duced me when examining the main
coast to seek carefully at every place,
anjongst the refuse thrown upon the
shores, for indications of shipwreck
to windward; and could the search
have been then prosecuted to the
15 th, or 12th degree of latitude, I
am persuaded it would not have been
in vain.* Besides the extensive reefs
which skirt the western side of New
Caledonia, and the Barrier Beefs on
the opposite coast of New South
Wales, we are now acquainted with
the six or eight following distinct
banks of coral in the sea between
them, exclusive of Wreck Beef and
the Cato’s Bank.
Two reefs discovered by Bou-
gainville,
Bature de Diane, by the same.
Two reefs further westward, by
the Investigator.
Booby Shoal, towards New Cale-
donia, by captain H. L. Ball.
Bellona’s Shoal, by the ship of
that name.
Bampton’s Shoal, an extensive
reef with two small islands.
There are also the islets and shoals
seen by the ship Sovereign, which are
probably a part of those that extend
so far from the north-west end of
New Caledonia; and all these, with
some others further northward, lie
in the space comprehended between
Louisiade and New Guinea on the
north, —New Caledonia to the east,
—Ne\V South Wales to the West,
•—and a line drawn from Sandy Cape
to the Isle of Pines on the south.
Tew ships have passed through this
sea without making the discovery of
some new bank of coral; and it is
probable that several other patches
of reef, yet unknown, will be found
in it, especially on the Caledonian
side. This space might be very ap-
propriately called the Corallian Sea”
M x Captain


Captain Flinders’s voyage in an open boat to Port-Jackson, and
RETURN TO RÈF-WRECK BANK,
[From the same.]
Cf On August 26, the largest cut-
ter being ready for her expedition,
was launched and named the Hope.
The morning was fine, and wind
light from the southward ; and not-
withstanding the day* which in the
seaman’s calendar is the most un-
fortunate of the whole week to com-
mence a voyage, I embarked for Port
Jackson with the commander of the
Gato. We had a double set of row-
ers, making in all fourteen persons,
with three weeks provisions and two
half hogsheads of water j so that
the Hope was loaded rather too
deeply- At eight in the morning,
we pushed off amidst the cheers and
good wishes of those for whom we
were going to seek relief ; an en-
sign with the union downward, had
hitherto been kept hoisted as a sig-
nal to captain Palmer of our distress j
but in this moment of enthusiasm a
seaman quitted the crowd, and hav-
ing obtained permission, ran to the
flag staff, hauled down the ensign,
and rehoisted it with the union in
the upper canton. This symbolical
expression of contempt for the
Bridgewater and of confidence in the
success of our voyage, I did not see
without lively emotions.
“ We made sail to the westward
under the iee of the reef, and passed
two openings in it of nearly a mile
wide. The second league brought
us abreast of a dry sand bank,
smaller than that quitted} and at
noon we came to a third,, lying ten
miles west of Wreck-Reef Bank.
Having then lost the breeze, we
stopped to cook our dinner on shore }
and in the mean time I shot as
many noddies as would give all the
boat’s crew a meal. On quitting
this third bank, which is near the
western extremity of Wreck Reef,
we crossed into the open sea } and a
breeze springing up at south east,
made sail towards Sandy Cape.
Many hump-backed whales were
playing about the boat during the
whole time we remained, under the
lee of the reef, but they did not
follow us further.
“ Nothing but clear water was
visible at sunset, nevertheless we ran
cautiously in the dark, looking out
for breakers} the night was fine,
and we madegood progress by means
of the oars, at which the twelve men
took watch and watch, as Mr. Park
and myself did at the helm : it was
for (his purpose, and to guard against
accidents, that I bad taken so many
men in the boat,
“ At day break the wind was
E, S. E. and no land in sight; the
boat was going four knots, and at
noon our latitude by log was 23 0 6'
and the distance made from Wreck-
Reef Bank, ninety miles. The wind
freshened in the afternoon, and a
cross sea rose which obliged us to
reef the sails, and made the boat
very wet. At four we close reefed
and hauled to the wind, but this was
not enough; the increased hollow-
ness


ness of the waves caused the boat to
labour so much, that every plunge
raised an apprehension that some of
the planks would start from the
timbers. Having no other resource,
*ve emptied one of the two casks of
water,threw over-board the stones of
our fire place and wood for cooking,
as also a bag of pease and whatever
else could be best spared ; the boat
was then somewhat more easy; and
before dark, the hollow swell had
so far subsided that we kept two
points from the wind, and again
' went along in tolerable tranquillity.
“ The hollow sea was probably
caused by a weather tide setting out
of some passage between the reefs
to the north-westward ; and the
succeeding smooth water by the tide
having turned to leeward, or other-
wise from the boat having passed
across the stream 5 it is at least cer-
tain, that the southern part of the
Barrier Reefs, seen by captain Swain
of the ship Eliza, was somewhere to
the north-west of our situation at
that time. To avoid all these reefs,
and to counteract the effect of a
north-western current, I kept a
S. S. W. course all the following
night.
“ We had fine weather next
morning, with a moderate breeze
at north-east ; and at noon, the dis-
tance run in the preceding twenty-
four hours was ninety-one miles by
the log, and the observed latitude
2 4° south : the lead was put
over-board, but no bottom found at
50 fathoms. Our situation being to
the south of Sandy Cape, we steered
a point more west, in the hope of
seeing the land before night; it be-
ing my intention to keep near the
coast from thence to Port Jackson,
that by landing, or running the boat
on shore, we might escape founder-
ing at sea should a gale of wind
come on. At sunset, the land was
visible to the westward at the dis-
tance of four or five leagues, and we
then hauled up south, parallel to the
coast; the night was fine, the wind
light and fair, and at daylight the
tops of the hills were seen in the
west, at the same distance as before.
Our latitude at noon was 26° 22',
and a high hummock upon the land,
somewhere between Double-island
Point and Glass house Bay, bore
W. |N.
tf Our favourable breeze died
away in the afternoon, and we took
to the oars; it however sprung up
a 6 ain from the northward, and
brought us within sight of Cape
Moretpn at sunset. Towards mid-
night the weather became squally
with heavy rain, and gave us all a
thorough drenching; but the wind
not being very strong in these squalls,
our course was still pursued to the
southward. After the rain ceased
the wind came at S. S. W,; and the
weather remaining unsettled, we
tacked at daylight to get close in
with the land, and at noon anchored
under Point Look-out. This was
only the fourth day of our departure
from Wreck Reef, and I considered
the voyage to be half accomplished,
since wehad gotfirra hold of the main
coast; for the probability of being
lost is greater in making three hun-
dred miles in an open boat at sea,
than in running even six hundred
along shore. It would have added
much to our satisfaction, could we
have conveyed the intelligence of
this fortunate progress to our ship-
mates bn the bank.
“ The necessity for a supply of
fresh water was becoming urgent,
for our remaining half hogshead
was much reduced. There were,
about twenty Indians upon the side
of a hill near the shore, who seemed
to
[69]
Captain Flinders's Voyage in an open hoat to Pari Jackson, &c.


to be peaceably disposed, amusing us
with dances in imitation.of the kan-
garoo ; we made signs of wanting
water, which they understood, and
pointed to a small rill falling into
the sea. Two of the sailors leaped
over-board, with some trifles for the
natives and one end of the lead line ;
with the other end we slung the
empty cask, which they hauled on
shore and filled without molestation,
A shark had followed them to the
beach ; and fearing they might be
attacked in returning, we got up
the anchor and went to a place where
the surf, though too much to allow
of the boat landing, permitted us to
lie closer. The cask of water, a
bundle of wood, and the two men
were received on board without ac-
cident ; the natives keeping aloof
daring the whole time, and even
retiring when our people approach-
ed, though they were without arms
and naked. It is probable that the
Indians were astonished at the com-
parison between the moderately
white skin of the sailors and their
own, and perhaps had heard of my
expedition to Glass-house Bay in
1799, in which I had been provoked
to make one of them feel the effect
of our arms; and had they attempt-
ed any thing against my two men,
we were prepared to have given them
a volley from the boat which would
probably have been a fearful confir-
mation of the truth of the report;
but happily for both parties, we
were not reduced to the necessity.
“ On rowing to Point' Look-out,
to continue the voyage, I found the
wind so fresh from the southward
that the greatest fatigue at the oars
could advance us little ; we there-
fore ran to leeward of two rocks,
lying a mile and a half north-west
from the extremity of the point;
and having anchored there, arranged
the boat so a? that ever; person*
might take. a better orvb'-i n\;; than
we had hitherto bee;: ;•> , ngy.
ce At daylight, the wind :.ng
light and variable, we pie ede-i
along the coast by using both sails
and oars. The weather was dull,
and prevented an observation at noon
for the latitude 5 but a sight of
Mount Warning at dusk showed that
our progress was equal to expec-
tation. We then had a gentle breeze
from the north-eastward , and at ten
o’clock, passed close to a projection
of land which I supposed to be Point
Danger, without seeing any break-
ers ; it is therefore probable, that
the reef laid down by captain Co6k
does not join to the land, for we
kept a good look out, and the night
was tolerably fine.
“ At five on the following morn-
ing we passed Cape Byron, with a
breeze at north-west, and at noon
had made a hundred miles by our
reckoning from Point Look-out;
the observed latitude was then 29 0
16', and the land near Shoal Bay
was three leagues distant. We con-
tinued steering to the southward, in
high spirits, at being so favoured by
the northern winds, which there
was so little reason to expect; and at
eight in the evening reached abreast'
ot the Solitary Isles. Smoky Cape
was in sight next morning ; but the
wind coming round to south, and
blowing fresh with thick weather,
we tacked towards the shore; and
at noon landed behind a small ledge
of rocks, about three leagues short
of the Cape. The distance run these
twenty-four hours was eighty five
miles, and the southwardly current
had moreover given its assistance.
“ This ledge of rocks lies on the
north side of a point upon which
there are some hummocks; and on
ascending the highest, I saw a lagoon
into
[70]
Captain Flinders's Voyage in an open Boat to Port Jackson,


into which the tide flowed by a nar-
row passage on the inner side of the
point. The pandanus grows here ;
and as it was a tree unknown to Bon-
garee, this latitude (about 30° 45')
is probably near its southern limit.
We took in a supply of fuel and
gathered some fine oysters, and the
wind dying away to a calm in the
afternoon, rowed out for Smoky
Cape; but on reaching abreast of
it the wind again rose a-head ; and
at one in the morning we anchored
in a small bight at the extremity of
the Cape, and remained until day-
light.
“ The wind was still contrary on
the 3d, nevertheless we stood out and
beat to the southward until four in
the afternoon ; when the sea having
become too high for the boat, we
anchored under the lee of a small
projecting point, eight or ten leagues
to the south of Smoky Cape; which
distance had been gained in about
ten hours, principally by means of
the currfent.
“ On the 4th, we again attempted
to beat to the southward ; but the
wind being light as well as foul, and
the sea running high, not much was
gained; at noon the weather threat-
ened so much, that it became ne-
cessary to look out for a place of
shelter, and we steered into a bight
with rocks in it, which I judge to
have beeti on the north side of Tack-
ing Point. At the head of the bight
is a lagoon ; but the entrance prov-
ing to be very shallow, and finding
no security, we continued on our
voyage; trusting that some place of
shelter would present itself, if
obliged to seek it by necessity. To-
wards evening the wind and weather
became more favourable; in the
mornings the Three Brothers were
insight; and at noon I observed the
latitude 3x° 57', when the middle-
roost of these hills bore N. N. W.
and our distance off shore was two
or three leagues,
“ At this time the wind blew a
moderate sea breeze at E, S. E,,
Cape Hawke was seen soon afte -
ward, and at eight in the evening
we steered between Sugar-loaf Point
and the two rocks lying from it three
or four miles to the south-east. At
four next morning, passed the is-
lands at the entrance of Port Ste-
phens, and at noon the Coal Island
in the mouth of Port Hunter bore
N. W. by N.; the wind then shifted
more to the southward, with squally
weather, and both prevented the
boat from lying along the coast and
made it unsafe to be at sea. After
struggling till four in the afternoon,
with little advantage, we bore up
to look for shelter behind some of
the small projecting points; and al-
most immediately found it in a shal-
low cove, exposed only to the north-
eastward, This was the eleventh
day of our departure from Wreck-
Reef, and the distance of Port Jack-
son did not now exceed fifty miles.
“ At this place we slept on shore
for the first time; but the weather
being squally, rainy, and cold, and
the boat’s sails our best shelter, it
was not with any greatshare of com-
fort; a good watch was kept during
the night, but no molestation was
received from the natives. Not-
withstanding our cramped-up posi-
tion in the boat, and exposure to all
kinds of weather, we enjoyed ex-
cellent health, one man excepted,
upon whom the dysentery, which
had made such ravages in the Inves-
tigator, now returned with some
violence.
“ A cask of water was filled on
the morning of the 7th, and our bis-
cuit being all expended or spoiled,
some cakes were baked in the ashes
for


for our future subsistence. At
eleven o’clock, the rain having
cleared away, we stood out to the
offing with light baffling winds,
and towards evening were enabled
to lie along the coast, but the breeze
at SQUth-east not giving much as-
sistance, we took to the oars and la-
boured hard all the following night,
being animated with the prospect of
a speedy termination to our voyage
The north head of Broken Bay was
in sight next morning, and at noon
the south head was abreast of the
boat; a sea breeze then setting in at
E. N. E., we crowded all sail for
Port Jackson, and soon after two
o’clock had the happiness to enter
between the heads.
The reader has perhaps never
gone 25® leagues at sea in an open
boat, or along a strange coast inha-
bited by savages; but if he recollect
the eighty officers and men upon
Wreck-Reef Bank, and how im-
portant was our arrival to their
safety, and to the saving of the
charts, journals, and papers of the
Investigator’s voyage, he may have
some idea of the pleasure we felt,
but particularly myself, at entering
our destined port.
“ I proceeded immediately to the
town of Sydney, and went with
captain Park to wait upon His Ex-
cellency governor King, whom we
found at dinner with his family. A
razor had not passed over our faces
from the time of the shipwreck, and
the surprise of the governor was not
little at seeing two persons thus ap-
pear whom he supposed to be many
hundred leagues on theii way to
England ; but so soon as he was con-
vinced of the truth of the vision be-
fore him, and learned the melan-
'choly cause, an involuntary tear
started from the eye of friendship
and compassion, and we were re-
ceived in the most a|Fectk n ;te man-
ner.
“ His Excellency lost no time in
engaging the ship Rolla, then lying
in port, bound to China, to go to
the rescue of the officers and crews
of the Porpoise and Cato; I accom-
panied the governor on board the
Rolla a day or two afterwards, and
articles were signed by which the
commander, Mr. Robert Camming,
engaged to call at Wreck Reef, take
every person on board and carry
them to Canton, upon terms which
showed him to take the interest in
our misfortune which might be ex-
pected from a British seaman. The
governor ordered two colonial schoon-
ers to accompany the Rolla, to bring
back those who preferred returning
to Port Jackson, with such stores of
the Porpoise as could be procured;
and every thing was done that an
anxious desire to forward his Ma-
jesty’s service and alleviate misfor-
tune could devise ; even private in-
dividuals put wine, live stock, and
vegetables, unasked, on board the
Rolla for the officers upon the reef,
“ My anxiety to get back to
Wreck Reef, and from thence to
England with the greatest dispatch,
induced the governor to offer me one
of the schooners to go through Tor-
res’ Strait and by the most expe-
ditious passage to Europe ; rather
than take the long route by China
in the Rolla. This schooner was
something less than a Gravesend
passage boat, being only of twenty-
nine tons burthen ; and therefore it
required some consideration before
acceding to the proposal. Her small
size, when compared with the dis-
tance from Port Jackson to England,'
was not my greatest objection to the
little Cumberland ; it was the quick-
ness of her motion and the want of
convenience,whichwould prevent the
charts


charts and journal of my voyage from
being prepared on the passage, and
render the whole so much time lost
to this imp rfam object. On the
other hano ne advantage of again
passing through, and collecting more
inforrfiatn n of Torres’ Strait, and of
arriving in England three or four
months sooner to commence the out-
lit of another ship, were important
considerations ; and joined to some
ambition of being the first to under-
take so long a voyage in such a small
vessel, and a desire to put an early
stop to the account which captain
Palmer would probably give of our
total, loss, they proved sufficient in-
ducements to accept the governor’s
offer, on finding his vessel had the
character of being a strong, good
little sea boat.
“ The Cumberland was ,at that
time absent up the river Havvkes-
bury, and the Francis, the other
schooner, was lying on shore and
could not be got off before the fol-
lowing spring tides; on these ac-
counts, and from the Holla not being
cjuite fitted, it was thirteen days
after my arrival in the boat before the
whole could be ready to sail-. This
‘delay caused me much uneasiness,
under the -apprehension that we
might not arrive before our friends
at the reef, despairing of assistance,
should have made some unsuccessful
attempt to save themselves; and
this idea pursued me so much* that
every day seemed to be a week until
I got But of the harbour with the
three vessels.
“ Governor King’s answer .to my
communication respecting the ship-
wreck ot the Porpoise and Cato, and
the orders under which I acted in
embarking in the Cumberland, are
contained in the following letter.
“ * Sydney, New South Wales,
Sept. 17, 1803.
“ { Sir,
“ ‘ In acknowledging the receipt
of yours with its enclosure of the
9th instant, whilst I lament the
misfortune that has befallen the
Porpoise and Cato, I am thankful
that no more lives have been lost
than the three you mention. I have
every reason to be assured that no
precaution was omitted by lieutenant
Fowler and yourself to avoid the ac-
cident, and I am equally satisfied
with your account of the exertions
of the officers and men after the loss
of the ships, both , for the preserva-
tion of the stores and maintaining
order in their present situation; nor
can I sufficiently commend your vo-
luntary services and those who came
with you, in undertaking a voyage'
of 700 miles in an open boat, to pro-
cure relief for our frifends now on
the bank ; and 1 hope, for the ho-
nour of humanity, that if the Bridge-
water be safe, the commander may
be able to give some possible reason
for his not ascertaining whether any
had survived the shipwreck, as there
appears too much reason to believe
he has persuaded himself all pe-
rished.
“ f No time has been lost in pre-
vailing upon the master of the Holla,
bound to China, to take on board
the officers and seamen now on the
reef belonging to the Porpoise and
Investigator, and carrying them to
Canton, whither he is bound ; on
the condition expressed in the agree-
ment entered into with him by me,
and which you have witnessed.
For that purpose I have caused a
proportion of all species of provisions
to be put on board at full allowance,
for seventy men for ten weeks from
thereof; I shall also give to lieu-
tenant Fowler the instructions . .
h.s


his conduct which I have commu-
nicated to you, and direct him to
consult with you on the measures to
be adopted by him forexecuting those
instructions as far as situation and
events may render them practicable.
“ ‘ And as you agree with me
that the Cumberland, colonial
schooner of twenty-nine tons, built
here, is capable of performing the
voyage to England by way of Torres’
Strait, and it being essential to the
furthering his Majesty’s service that
you should reach England by the
most prompt conveyance with your
charts and journals, I have directed
the commissary to make that vessel
over to you, with her present fur-
niture, sails, &C'. 3 and to complete
her from the stores of the Inves-
tigator with such other articles as
■you may require, together with a pro-
portion of provisions for six months,
for ten officers and men. And on
vour ai rival at Wreck Reef you will
select such officers and men as you
may judge necessary, lieutenant Fo-
wler having my orders on that head.
‘ After having given every as-
sistance to get the people and as
many stores as can be taken on board
the Rolla, and given the commander
©f the Francis schooner such orders
as circumstances may require, for
bringing those who may choose to
be discharged from the service and
as many stores as she can bring, yon
will then proceed to England by the
route you may think most advisable
and beneficial for his Majesty’s ser-
vice, On your arrival in London
you will deliver my letters to the Ad-
miralty and the principal secretary
of state for the colonies.
<e * In case any unforeseen cir-
cumstances should prevent the ac-
complishment of the voyage in the
Cumberland, you will take such
measures as may appear most con-
dacive to the interests of his Ma-
jesty’s service, either by selling the
vessel, or letting -her for freight at
the Cape or elsewhere, if any mer-
chants choose to send proper officers
or men to conduct her back ; and in
the event of your being obliged to
dispose of her, you will account with
his Majesty’s principal secretary of

“■ The small size of the Cumber-
land made it necessary to stop at
every convenient place on the way
to England, for water and refresh-
ment 3 and I proposed Coepang Bay
in Timor, Mauritius, the Cape of
Good Hope, St. Helena, and some
one of the Western Isles ; but go-
vernor King objected to Mauritius,
from not wishing to encourage any
communication between the French
colonies and Port Jackson 3 and also
because he had understood that hur-
ricanes often prevailed in the neigh-
bourhood of that island, about the
time of year when I should be pass-
ing 3 he left this matter, however, to
be decided by necessity and my
judgment, and gave me two letters
for the governor of‘Mauritius, to be
forwarded from the Cape, or by the
best opportunity. At those places
in the’ Indian seas where I might
stop, he requested me to make in-
quiries into the facility of obtaining
cattle for his colony, with the price
and the traffic with which, they
might be best procured 3 and to send
this information by any ship bound
to Port Jackson,
“ Every thing being prepared for
our departure, I sailed out of the
harbour in the Cumberland on the
2rst at daylight, with theßolla and
Francis in company. Mr. Inman,
the astronomer, had taken a passage
in the Holla with his instruments 3
of


of the thirteen persons who came
with me in the boat, captain Park
and his second mate were on board
that ship, and the boatswain of the
Investigator with the ten seamen
composed ray crew in the schooner.
We had a fresh breeze at south-east,
and the Cumberland appeared to
sail as -well as could be expected;
but the wind becoming stronger to-
wards night, she lay over so much
upon the broad side that little sail
could be carried ; and instead of be-
ing tight, as had been represented,
her upper works then admitted a
great deal of water. Next morning,
the wind having rather increased
than diminished, I found we should
soon be obliged to lie to altogether,
and that if we parsed Port Stephens
there was no place of shelter for a
long distance where the schooner
could be saved from dri(ting on shorej
the signal was therefore made to
tack, and at dusk the Holla and Frau-
ds ran into Port Stephens. Not be-
ing able to reach so far, I anchored
in a small bight under Point Ste-
phens, in very bad plight; the
pumps proving to he so nearly use-
less, that we could not prevent the
water from half filling the hold 3 and
two hours longer would have reduced
us to baling with buckets, and per-
haps have been fatal. This essay
did not lead me to think favourably
of the vessel, in which I had un-
dertaken a voyage half round the
globe.
“Next morning Ijoined the Holla
and Francis j and it being then calm,
we did not quit Port Stephens until
the afternoon. At night the wind
again blew strong from the south-
east ; but the desire to arrive at
Wreck Reef overcoming my appre-
hensions, the schooner was made
snug and we persevered. Our ina-
bility to carry sail was so much the
more provoking, that this wind
was as fair as could be wished ; but
whilst the Cumberland could scarcely
bear a close-reefed main sail and jib
without danger of oversetting, the
Holla went along under double-
reefed top sails in great tranquillity ;
and to avoid parting company was
obliged to keep her courses up, and
to back a top sail from time to
time.
“ The wind moderated next day,
and allowed us to make better pro-
gress. It afterwards veered round
to the north-cast, and prevented us
f"om fetching more than ten miles
to the east of the reef by Mr, In-
man’s time keeper, when we came
into the proper latitude. We bore
away for it, however, on October x.,
and ran more than a degree to the
west; when finding no reef or bank,
it appeared that we must have been
something to the west of Wreck-
Heef when the time keeper showed
ten miles to the eastward. This
obliged us to work back again, and
it was not till the 7th that we got
sight of the ensign upon the top of
the bank.
“ It was six weeks on this day
I had quitted the reef in the boat,
forthe purpose of seeking the means
to relieve my officers and people.
The bank was first seen from the
Holla’s roast head, and soon after-
ward two boats were perceived under
sail; and advancing nearer, we saw
one boat make for the Holla and the
other returning to the bank. The
Porpoise had not yet gone to pieces,
but was still lying on her beam ends,
high upon the reef, a frail, but im-
pressive monument of our misfor-
tune.
“ In the afternoon I anchored
under the lee of the bank, in 18 fa-
thoms coral sand, and a salute of
eleven guns from it was immediately
fired.


fired, the carronades of the Porpoise
having been transported from the
wreck. On landing, I was greeted
with three hearty cheers, and the
utmost joy by my officers and peo-
ple ; and the pleasure of rejoining
my companions so amply provided
with the means of relieving their
distress, made this one of the hap-
piest moments of my life.
The two boats we had seen,
were the Porpoise’s remaining cut-
ler and a new boat constructed dur-
ing my absence; it was just com-
pleted, and lieutenant Fowler had
this morning gone out to try its
sailing against the cutter. My safe
arrival at Port Jackson became a
subject of much doubt after the first
month ; and they had begun to re-
concile their minds to making the
best use of the means they possessed
to reach some frequented port. The
Holla's tup-gallant sail was first seen
in the horizon by a man in the new
boat, and was taken for a bird; but
regarding it more steadfastly, he
started up and exclaimed, d—n my
bl—d what’s that! It was soon re-
cognised to be a sail, and caused a
general acclamation of joy, for they
doubted not it was a ship coming
to their succour. Lieutenant Hin-
ders, then commanding officer on
the bank, was in his tent calculating
some lunar distances, when one of
the young gentlemen ran to him,
calling, 'f Sir, sir! a ship and two
schooners in sight!’ After a little
consideration, Mr, Flinders said he
supposed it was his brother come
back, and asked if the vessels were
near? He was answered, not yet;
upon which he desired to be informed
when they should reach the anchor-
age, and very calmly resumed his
calculations: such are the varied
effects produced by the same circum- ‘
stance upon different minds. When
the desired report was made, he or-
dered the salute to be fired, and took
part in the general satisfaction.
u My plan of proceeding at the
reef having been arranged on the
passage, I immediately began to
put it in execution. The people were
assembled on. the bank, and in-
formed that such as chose to be dis-
charged from the service might re-
turn to Port Jackson in the Francis
schooner; and that the rest would
be taken on board the Holla and
carried to China, with the exception
of ten officers and men whom I
named, to go to England with me
in the Cumberland, if they would
risk themselves in so small a vessel j
for notwithstanding what had been
discovered of the bad qualities of the
schooner, I determined to proceed,
at least so far as to reach some port
where a passage might be procured
in a better vessel without losing
time. The determinations of all
were required to be given on the
following day ; and in the mean time,
we began to take on board the few
stores necessary to complete the
Cumberland for our voyage, and
especially to fill the bolds with wa-
ter, of which there was yet a good
quantity remaining on the bank.
“ On the 10th, three days after
our arrival, the Holla had received
the ' people destined for her, with
part of the provisions and stores j
and the Cumberland was ready to
sail. All those whom I had named,
with the exception of my clerk, vo-
lunteered to go in the schooner;
viz., Mr. John Aken, master, and
Mr. Edward Charringtoh, boatswain
of the Investigator, my servant, and
seven chosen seamen. A cask con-
taining what had been saved of my
specimens of mineralogy and con-
chology was taken on board, as also
the charts, books, and papers of
every
[76]
Captain Flinders's Voyage in an open Boat to Port Jackson,


every kind, with the instruments
received from the Navy Board and
the sole time keeper which had not
stopped.
“ Mr. Denis Lacy, master’s mate
of. the Investigator, desiring to re-
turn to Port Jackson, he was charged
with my letter to his Excellency go-
vernor King; and I gave'him an
order to command the new boat. It
was about the size of the Cumber-
land, bad a deck, and was called
the Resource ; and we manned her
with a part of those people whose
choice led them back to Port Jack-
son. I ordered Mr. James Aikin,
commander of the Francis, and Mr.
Lacy, to take on board for the co-
lony as much of,the stores as they
should be able; and on their arrival,
to make a statement to the governor
of the condition in which they might
leave the Porpoise, and what re-
mained on the bank.
“ The officers journals, which
were to be sent to the Admiralty at
the conclusion of the voyage, had
not been 1 demanded at the time of
our shipwreck ; lieutenant Fowler
was therefore directed to take all that
were saved belonging to the officers
embarked with him in the Rolla;
and lest any accident should happen
to the Cumberland, I committed to
his charge a copy of four charts.
being all of the East and North
Coasts which there had been time
to get ready; with these he took a
short letter to the secretary of the
Admiralty, and one to the Victual-
ling Board, inclosing such vouchers
as had been saved from the wreck.
To Mr. Inman I gave the remaining
instruments belonging to the Board
of Longitude, reserving only a time
keeper and a telescope; the large
and most valuable instruments had
very fortunately been delivered to
him before we had sailed from Port
Jackson in the Porpoise.
“ These matters being arranged,
I pressed captain Camming to de-
part, fearing that a change of wind
might expose the Holla to danger ;
but finding him desirous to take off
more provisions and stores, I made
sail for a bank or rather islet seven
miles distant, at the eastern extre-
mity of Wreck Reef, for the pur-
pose of collecting sea-birds eggs,
and if possible taking a turtle. The
Rolla joined on the following day,
and I went on board to take leave
of Messrs. Fowler and Flinders and
the other officers and gentlemen ; at
noon we parted company with three
cheers,the Rolla steering north-east-
ward for China, whilst my course
was directed for Torres’ Strait,”
Captivity of Captain Flinders at the Mauritius,
[From the same.]
<e In the orders from governor
King, the ports to be touched at on
the way to England were left to
my own choice; but when Mau-
ritius had been mentioned amongst
others in conversation, the gpver-.
nor had objected to it, both on
account of the hurricanes in that
neighbourhood, and from not wish-
ing to encourage a communication
between


between a French colony and a
settlement composed as is that of
Port Jackson. It was these con-
siderations which had made me
hesitate to take the step, though, the
necessity for it was pressing; and
as, in the case of accident happen-
ing to the schooner, I might bb
called to answer before a court mar-
tial for going in opposition to the
wish of a superior officer, it seemed
proper to state in my journal all the
reasons which had any influence on
my decision. This journal is not
in my possession; but notes of
the statement were made whilst
the recollection of it was strong,
and the following was the sub-
stance and not far from the words.
“ 1. The necessity of caulking
the schooner and refitting the
pumps before attempting to double'
the Cape, were stated nearly as-
above; to which was added a hope
of obtaining a passage in a ship
where my defaced.charts and jour-
nals, which remained untouched from •
the time of the shipwreck, might
be put into a state to be laid before
the admiralty on arriving in Eng-
land. In the case of meeting with
such a passage, I intended to let the
Cumberland for freight back to
Port Jackson, or to sell her, agree-
ably to the authority given me in
governor King’s orders,
“ 2. Considering the proximity
of Mauritius to the western coasts
of Terra Australis, which remained
to be examined, I was desirous to
see in what stale it had been left by
the revolution, and to gain a prac-
tical knowledge of the port and
periodical winds; with a view to
its being used in the future part of
my voyage as a place of refitting
and-refreshment, for which Port
Jackson was at an inconvenient dis-
tance. Tt was also desirable to
know how far Mauritius, and its
dependencies in Madagascar which
I knew to abound in cattle, could
be useful to Port Jackon in supply-
ing it with breeding stock ; an ob-
ject concerning which the governor
had expressed anxiety for informa-
tion from any place on the east
side of the Cape of Good Hope.
“ 3. The two letters from gover-
nor King to general Magallon,-go-
vernor of Mauritius, instead of be-
ing forwarded from the Cape might
be delivered in person.
“ 4. I was a stranger to what
had passed in Europe for nearly
twelve months, and there was con-
sequently a possibility that war
might again have broken out; my
passport from the French govern-
ment would be good at Mauritius,
but in going to the Cape, it was
uncertain what attention the Dutch
governor might pay to the orders of
the first consul of France; and as
promoters andencouragers of science,
the character of the nation was not
so high as to give me great expec-
tation on that head. Mauritius was
therefore much more certain than
the Cape, since the necessary suc-
cour would be there-obtained even
in case of war; whereas at the Cape
there might be a risk of losing ray
charts and journals and of being
made a prisoner.
“ These reasons for stopping at
Mauritius as we passed by it, in ad-
dition to the necessity arising from,
the state of the schooner, were
written in my rough journal for re-
ference, without any idea of thek
being criticised, or even seen by
any other than myself; and I have
been particular in detailing them,
on account of the unexpected oc-
currences with which they became
connected.
“ On the evening of the pth, a
ship was seen to the northward, and
we sought to speak her for in-
formation ;


formation-; but night coming on
the sight of her was lost, and we
resumed our western course. I had
no chart of Mauritius, nor other de-
scription than what is contained in
the third edition of the Encyclope-
dia Britannica ; this informed me
that Port Louis was on the north-
west side of the island, but not of
the route usually taken to reach it;
and the prevailing wind being south
east, it seemed to b e a matter of in-
difference ; I therefore steered to
make the' middle of the island, in-
tending to go by the north or south
sides as the wind might happen to
favour most. On the 15th before
daylight, the land was seen, and
the wind being E. by S. we hauled
to the northward. When the day
broke the.island was seven or eight
miles off, and bore from S. 42° to N.
51° W.; but there was a distant
round lump, whether connected
with it did not appear, which bore
N. by W. ; and finding the
schooner could not clear it, from
the sea running high and current
setting to leeward, we veered round
and steered southward along the
edge of a reef which extends four
or five miles from this part of the
island. Sopn after eight o’clock we
passed three flat rocks within the
reef, lying, as I now suppose, at
the entrance, of Port Bourbon; the
extremes of the island then bore N.
1° to S. 69° W-j and a steep point
N. 3Q° W. five or six miles.
“ In steering westward along the
shore, looking out for boats or ves-
sels to gain information, a flag was
seen upon one of the hills; our co-
lours were then hoisted, and after-
wards a French jack at the fore top-
mast head, as a signal for a pilot.
At noon, the observed latitude was
20° 34' south, and the extremes of
the island bore N. 54'* E. to OT°W.
There was a small town bearing N.
by E. two or three miles, from
whence a schooner had come out,
and being a-head we made sail, to
speak her; but she hauled in to-
wards the shore until we had passed
and then stood after us. On our
heaving to, the schooner again
steered for a place where some ves-.
sels were seen at anchor, and I be-
gan to take her movements as an in-
timation that we should go in there
for a pilot; accordingly we followed
her through a narrow pass in the
reefs, and anchored in 2 i fathoms,
in a small reef harbour which I after-
wards understood was called the
Baye du Cap.
“ If the schooner’s actions were
strange before, those of the people
were now more so ; for no sooner
was their anchor dropped, than with-
out furling the sails they weint
hastily on shore in a canoe, and
made the best, of their way up a
sleep hill, one of them with a trunk
on his shoulder.. They were met
by a person who, from the plume
in his hat, appeared to be an officer,
and presently we saw several men
with muskets on the top of the hill;
this gave another view of the
schooner’s movements, and caused
me to apprehend that England and
France were either at war or very
near it. To induce some person to
come on board, I held up the let-
ters for general Magallon, the go-
vernor ; but this being to no pur-
pose, Mr. A ken went on shore in
our little Boat, taking with him the
letters and French passport; in a
short time he returned with the offi-
cer and two others, and I learned to
my great regret that war was ac-
tually declared.
“ The officer, whose name was
Dunienville, spoke a little English ;
he asked if I were tjie captain Flin-
ders mentioned in the passport,
whether we had been shipwrecked,
and


and to see my commission. Hav-
ing perused it, he' very politely
offered his services, inquired what
were our immediate wants, and in-
vited me to go on shore and dine
with him, it being then near three
o’clock. ' I explained my wish to
have a pilot for Port North West
(the name at that time for Port
Louis), since it appeared no repara-
tions could be done in the little bay,
and requested to have a cask or two
of water. The pildt was promised
for the next day, and Mons. Duni-
enville sent a canoe for our empty
casks and the master of -the French
schooner to moor the Cumberland
in a secure place.
My passport was in French,
and being a stranger to the language,
I had had its general purport ex-
plained on first receiving it from the
Admiralty; but from that time,
and more especially after the pre-
liminaries of peace had reached
Port Jackson, the passport had
scarcely been looked at, and my
knowledge of its contents was very
imperfect. When the officer was
gone, I set myself to consider, it at-
tentively ; and so far as I could
make out, it seemed to be solely for
the Investigator, and without pro-
vision for any other vessel in which
the less of the ship, or her incapa-
city to pursue the voyage might ob-
lige me to embark. The inten-
tion, no doubt, was to protect the
voyage generally, and not the In-
vestigator in particular; but it ap-
peared that if the governor of Mau-
ritius should adhere to the letter of
the passport and disregard the in-
tention, he might seize the Cum-
berland as a prize; and the idea of
being detained even a week more
than necessary was intolerable. I
inquired of the pilot whether the
'Cape of Good Hope belonged to the
Dutch or English ; almost deter-
mlhlng, should it not have been
given upbefore the war commenced,
to attempt the passage at all risks,
rather than incur the hazard of be-
ing stopped; but the Cape was in
the hands of the Dutch/
“ An hour after M. Dunienville
had been gone, we saw him return-
ing with another officer, who proved
to be his superior in rank; and
they had with them a gentleman
who spoke English irftelligibly. My
passport and commission were de-
manded in a rough manner, and
after the officer had examined them
with the assistance of his interpre-
ter, he observed that the passport
was not for the Cumberland, and
required an explanation; having re-
ceived it, he said it was necessary
that both commission and passport
should be sent to the governor, and
that I should remain with the ves-
sel till an answer was returned. To
this arrangement I objected, alleg-
ing that since war was declared,
these papers were my sole prelection
and could not be given up ; but if
copies would do they might be taken.
It was at length settled, -that I
should go overland to Port Louis with,
the passport and commission, and
that Mr. Aken should be furnished
with a pilot and bring the schooner-
round after me.
“T was conducted to the house
of M. Dunienville, about a mile dis-
tant, to be ready to set off on horse-
back early next morning. The gen-
tleman who interpreted informed
me on the way, that genera! Magal-
lon was at Bourbon, having been
lately superseded by general De
Caen, an officer of the French re-
volution. M. Dunienville had been
a lieutenant of the navy and knight
of St, Louis under the old govern-
ment, and was then major of the
district of La Savanne; but the
other officer, M. Etienne Bolger,
had


had lately been appointed command-
ant over his head, by the new go-
vernor,
“ My reception at the major’s
house was polite add hospitable;
and at dawn of day 1 rose to set off
•with ray host for Port Louis, ac-
cording to the plan settled over
night. It appeared, however, that
he first expected some orders from
the commandant; and at ten o’clock,
becoming impatient of the delay,
I requested to know whether it
were or were not intended to
go overland ? Major Dunienville
seemed to be hurt that the agree-
ment had not been kept; but the
direction was taken out of his hands,
and not having received final or-
ders he could do nothing. I then re-
turned to the Cumberland, with the
intention of sailing either with or
without a pilot; but a wind favour-
able for quitting the bay being not
expected before four o’clock, it in-
duced me to accept the major’s press-
ing invitation to dine at his house,
where four or five strangers were
assembled. Before dinner was over
an order came to him from the
commandant to permit the depar-
ture of the schooner he had stop-
ped ; and at five o’clock, the pilot
being on board, we stood out from
the reefs in one of those squalls
which come off the land at that
hbnr in the summer season.
This little Baye du Cap lies
•about four miles east from Cape
Brabant, a headland at the south-
west extremity of the island. The
shelter is formed by coral reefs,
through which a small river falling
into the bay has kept open a passage
of about a cable's length Wide, with
a depth of 3 fathoms close to the
Eastern breakers; within side there
appeared to be anchorage for six or
eight small vessels, in from 2 to 3
thorns; bat on account of the
1314.
flurries of wind which come down
the gullies and off the precipices, it"
is necessary to moor head and stern.
Mr. A ken found the latitude from
an indifferent observation to be 20°
20~' south.
“At seven in the evening we
passed round Cape Brabant, and the
pilot then kept north-eastward, close
along the reefs under the high land;
although by so doing we were fre-
quently becalmed, ahd sometimes
had strong flurries which made it
necessary to take in all sail; but it
appeared that he was afraid of being
driven off the island. At eight in
the morning, the mast heads of the
vessels in Port Louis were in sight,
and there was a large ship lying
without side which I hoped mightbe
Le Geographe. Major Dunienville
had informed me that this ship had
been sometime at Mauritius, and so
far as he knew, was still at the port,
though upon the eve of sailing for
Europe, Captain Baudin died soon
after his arrival, and Mons. Melius,
who had been first lieutenant of Le
Naturalis,te when at Port Jackson,
then commanded.
“ During this passage to Port
Louis, my mind was occupied in
turning over all the circumstances
of my situation, and the mode of
proceeding likely to be adopted by
the new governor. The breaking
out of the war, the neglect of pro-
viding in the passport for any such
case as that in which I stood, and
the ungracious conduct of the com-
mandant at the Baye du Cap, gave
me some apprehensions j but on the
other hand, the intention of the
passport to protect the persons em-
ployed in the expedition, with their
charts and journals, must be evident;
and the conduct of a governor ap-
pointed by the first consul Bona-
parte, who was a professed patron
of science, “would hardly be less
liberal


liberal than that of two preceding
French governments to captain
Cook in the American, and captain
Vancouver in the last war; for
both of whom protection and assist-
ance had been ordered, though nei-
ther carried passpoits_or had suffer-
ed shipwreck. These circum-
stances, with the testimony which
the commanders of the Geographe
and Naturaliste had doubtless given
of their treatment at Port Jackson,
seemed to insure for me the kindest
reception; and I.determined to rest
confident in this assurance, and to
banish all apprehension as deroga-
tory to the governor of Mauritius
and to the character of the French
nation.
“At four in the afternoon of
Dec. I", we got to an anchor at the
entrance of Port Louis, near the
ship which I had hoped might be
Le Geographe; but captain Melius
had sailed for France on the prece-
ding day, and this proved to be
T’Atalante frigate.
“ The peculiarity of my situa-
tion arising from the renewal of war
and neglect in the passport to pro-
vide for any accident happening 1 to
the Investigator, rendered great
precaution necessary in my proceed-
ings; and to as much as
possible, any doubts or misconcep-
tions, I determined to go imme-
diately with ray passport and com-
mission to the French governor, and
request his leave to get the neces-
sary reparations made to the
schooner; but learning from the
pilot that it was a regulation of the
port for no person to land before
the vessel had been visited by the
officer of health, it was complied
with. At five the boat came along
side; and having answered some
general questions proposed in good
English, I went into the boat in my
i reck uniform, and was conducted
to the government house by an
officer of the port and an interpre-
ter. These gentlemen, after speak-
ing with an aide-de-camp, told me
that the captain-general was at
dinner, and .we must return in an
hour or two; and they took me to
a shady place which seemed to be
the common lounge for the officers
connected with the port. There
were some who spoke English, and
by way of passing the time, they
asked if I had really come from
Botany Bay in that little vessel;
whether a corvette, sent out the
night before to observe my motions,
had been seen; and if 1 had not
sent a boat on shore in the night ?
Others asked questions of monsieur
Baudin’s conduct at Port Jacksoq,
and of the English colony there,
and also concerning the voyage of
monsieur Flindare, of which, to
their surprise, I knew nothing, but
afterward* found it to be my own
name which they so pronounced.
“ In two hours we reached the
government house, and the officers
entered to render their account, leav-
ing me at the door for half an honour
longer. At length the interpreter
desired me to follow him, and I was
shown into a room where two offi-
cers were standing at a table; the
one a shortish thick man in a laced
round jacket, the other a genteel
looking man whose blood seemed
to circulate more tranquifipf'- The
first, which was the captain*j|sneral
De .Caen, fixed his eyes. Sternly
upon me,, and without salutation or
preface tkmanded my passport, my
commis^h! Having glanced over
them, he asked in an impetuous
manner, the reason for coming to
the Isle of France in a small schoon-
er with a passport for the Investi-
gator ? I answered in a few words,
that the Investigator having become
rotten, the governor of New South
Wale#


Wales had given me the schooner
to return to England; and that I
fiad stopped at the island to repair
my vessel and -procure water and
refreshments. He then demanded
the order for embarking in the
schooner and coming to the isle of
France ; to which my answer was,
that for coming to the island I had
no order, necessity had obliged me
to stop in passing;—my order for
embarking in the Cumberland was
on board. At this answer, the
general lost the small share of pa-
tience of which he seemed to be
possessed, and said with much ges-
ture and an elevated voice—“ Yon
are imposing on me, sir! (Vous
m'en imposez, monsieur ) It is not
probable that the governor of New
South Wales should send away the
commander of an expedition on dis-
covery in so small a vessel!” —He
then gave back my passport and
commission, and I made a motion
to follow the interpreter out, but
was desired to stop a little. In a
few minutes the interpreter re-
turned with a military officer, to
whom some orders not explained to
me were given, and I was desired
to follow them; when going out
the captain-general said in a softer
tone something about ray being
well treated, which I could not com-
prehend.
“ In the way to the wharf, I in-
quired of the interpreter where they
were taking me ? He said, on board
the schooner, and that they had or-
ders to bring my books and papers
on shore; in effect, they took all
the charts, papers, and journals re-
lating to my voyage, as also the
Port Jackson letters and packets,
both public and private; and hav-
ing put them into a trunk which
was sealed by me at their desire,
made out a report (proces ver~
of their proceedings, and re-
quested me to sign it with them.
The preamble of this report set forth
something upon the suspicions ex-
cited by my appearance at. the Isle
of France, with the captain-general’s
opinion thereon ; I , therefore re-
fused to sign it, but certified at the
bottom, that all the charts, journals,
and papers of the voyage, together
with all the letters on board the
schooner had been taken.
“The conduct of these gentle-
men bemg polite, 1 expressed to
them my sentiments of general Do
Caen’s manner of receiving me, and
the injustice of taking away the pa-
pers of a voyage protected by a pass-
port from the French government ;
and added, that the captain-general’s
conduct must alter very much be-
fore I should pay him a second visit,
or even set my foot on shore again.
The interpreter hoped I would go
on shore with them, for the general
had ordered a lodging to be pro-
vided for me, and that, in fact, they
had orders to take me there. I
looked at him and at the officer,
who was one of the aides-de-camp,
—What! I exclaimed in the first
transports of surprise and indigna-
tion, —I am then a prisoner! They
acknowledged it to be true; but
said they hoped it would last only
a few days, until my papers were
examined; and that in the mean
time, directions had been given that
I should want for nothing.
“ Mr. Aken was also to go on
shore; , and whilst we put a few
clothes together in a trunk, several
black men, under the direction of
another pilot, were warping the
schooner up into the port. At one in
the morning the officers took us
into their boat, leaving the Cumber-
land, with Mr. Charrington and the
crew, under a gnard of soldiers,
“We were conducted to a large
house ia the middle of the town,
F 2 and


and through a long dark entry, up
a dirty stair case, ifitoffihe room des-
tined for us j the aide-de-camp and
interpreter then wished ns a good
night, and we afterwards heard no-
thing save the measured steps-ef a
sentinel, walking in the gallery be-
fore our door. The chamber con-
tained two truckle beds, a small
table and two rush-bottomed chairs;
and from the dirty appearance of
the room I judged the lodging pro-
vided for us by the general to be
one of the better apartments of a
common prison ; there were, how-
ever, no iron bars behind the lattice
windows, and the frame of a look-
ing-glass in the room had formerly
been gilt. It seemed to me a wiser
plan to leave "the circumstances to
develope themselves, rather than to
fatigue ourselves with uncertain con-'
jectures; therefore, telling Mr, Aken
we should probably know the truth
soon enough, I stripped and got into
bed j but between the musketoes
above and bugs below, and the no-
velty of our situation, it was near
daybreak before either of us dropped
asleep.
“ At six o’clock, I was awakened
by two armed grenadiers entering
the room. The one said some
words to the other, pointing to us
at the same time, and then went
out; and he that remained be-
gan walking backward and forward
between our beds, as a sentinel on
his post, without seeming to pay
great attention to us. Had there
been curtains, I should have tried to
regain my slumber; but not being
able to sleep in such company, I
rose and awoke my companion, who
seeing the grenadier, and not at first
recollecting our situation, answ’ered
in a manner that would have diverg-
ed me at any other time. The sen-
tinel did not prevent us speaking
together 3 and on looking out at the
window,.we found (hat it was in
reality a tavern where they had
placed though a very dirty one ;
it bore the name of Cafe Marengo.
A breakfast was brought at eight,
and dinner at twelve, and we eat
heartily ; good bread, fresh meat,
fruit, and vegetables being great
rarities.
“ At one o’clock, the aide-de-
camp, whom I learned to be Heat,
colonel Monistrol, came to the ta-
vern and desired me to accompany
him to the general: and being
shown into an office, a German
secretary, who spoke some English,
put various questions to roe from a
paper in substancen early as follows ;
How it was that I appeared at the
Isle of France in so small a vessel,
when my passport was tor the In-
vestigator? What was become of
the officers and men of science who
made part of the expedition? Whe-
ther I had any knowledge of the
war before arriving ? Wby cartel
colours had been hoisted, and a-
vessel chased in sight of'the is-
land? What were my objects for
putting into Port North-West, and
by what authority ? The orders
from governor King, relating to
the Cumberland, Were also do*,
mnnded, and carried to the cap-
tain-general with my answers to
the above questions; and soon
afterward to my surprise, an invi-
tation was brought rne to go to the
general’s table, his dinner being then
served up. This invitation was so
contrary to all that had hitherto
passed, and being unaccompanied
with any explanation, that I at
first thought it could not be seri-
ous, and answered that I had al-
ready dined; but on being pressed
to go at least to the table, my re-
ply was, that " under my present
situation and treatment it was im-
possible 3 when they should be
changed,,.


changed,—when I should be set at
liberty, if His .Excellency thought
proper to invite me, I should be
fl-tiered by it, and accept his invi-
tation with pleasure.” it had in-
deed the air of an experiment, to
ascertain whether I were really a
commander in the British navy;
and had the invitation been ac-
cepted without explanation or a
change of treatment, an inference
might have been drawn that the
charge ofimposture was well found-
ed ; but in any case, having been
grossly insulted both in my public
and private character, I could not
debase the situation I had the ho-
nour to hold by a tacit submission.
When the aide-de-camp returned
from carrying the above reply, he
said that the general vvould, invite
me when set at liberty ; but nothing
was offered in the way of expla-
nation,
** A paper qqntainrng the ques-
tions of the Germaq secretary with
my answers, was required to be
signed, but this being in French, I
objected as not understanding it: a
translation was therefore to be made,
and the letter of governor King re-
specting the Cumberland was to be
put into French for the captain-
general. Extracts from my journal,
showing the necessity of quitting
the Investigator, were moreover de-
sired,. and also my reasons at full
length for stopping at the Isle of
France, instead of going to the Cape
of Good Hope; it being necessary,
they said, for the general to trans-
mit these to the French government,
to justify himself for granting that
.assistance to the Cumberland -which
had been ordered for the Investiga-
tor. It was already night, and the
excessive heat, with being kept six
hours answering questions, was
very fatiguing; I therefore took
theahird volume of my rough log
book, which contained the whole
of what they desired to know, and
pointing out the parts in question
to the secretary, told him to make
such extracts as should be thought
requisite. I then requested to be
shown back to the tavern, also that
the sentinel might be taken out of
our room, and Mr. Aken be per-
mitted to return on board the
schooner to keep order; to which
the aide-de-camp brought for an-
swer, that it was then too late to
make new arrangements, but His
Excellency would see me in the
morning. All the books and papers,
the third volume of my rough Ipg
book excepted, were then returned
into the trunk and sealed as before j
and I was reconducted to my con-
finement between eight and nine
o’clock.
“ Next morning, the sentinel in
bur chamber was ordered to take
his station without side; and in
the afternoon M. Bonnefoy, the in-
terpreter, came to say that business
prevented the captain-general from
seeing me before the following day.
Mr. Aken had permission to go on
boai;d the schooner under the con-
duct of an officer; but not being
allowed to remain, he brought away
the time keeper, with my sextant
and artificial horizon; and we com-
menced a series of observations for
a new error and rate, ready against,
the day of bur departure.
“ Mr. Charrington came from
the schooner on the 20th to inform
me, that the seamen were commit-
ting many irregularities, taking
spirits out of my cabin, and going
on shore as they pleased; the
French guard seeming to take little
or no cognizance of their actions.
At one o’clock, the interpreter and
a military officer took me to the
government house, and I expected
to have an interview with the gene-
ral.


ral and a termination put to our
confinement. They shewed me into
the secretary's office, and requested
a copy of my passport and com-
mission ; and having made out one
myself'and signed them both, the
interpreter then said the general was
busy and could not see me that day ;
and I was taken back without learn-
ing when he would be at liberty, or
what was intended to be done.
“ As yet I was unable to compre-
hend any thing of the captain-gene-
ral’s conduct; but however great my
indignation at seeing my liberty and
time thus trifled with, it was to be
feared that in writing to him for an
explanation, before seeing what turn
the affair would take, might be pro-
ductive of more harm than good.
The disorders on board the schooner,
however, requiring immediate cor-
rection, I wrote a note to inform
him of them; requesting at the
same time, that Mr. A ken might
remain in the Cumberland, and that
the caulking of the vessel’s upper
works and fresh boring of the pumps
might be commenced, these being
the principal objects for which I had
stopped at the island. In the even-
ing the interpreter called to say, that
the corporal of the guard on board
the schooner had been punished for
neglecting his orders; that one of
the sailors, a Prussian, being found
on shore had been put into the
guard house, and that an aaswer
would be given to my note in the
morning. Jn effect, the interpre-
ter then came with lieutenant-
colonel Monistrol, and explained to
me a paper to the following purport.
“ That the captain-general being
Convinced from the examination of
rny journal, that I had absolutely
changed the nature of the mission
for which the First Consul bad
granted a passport, wherein I was
certainly not authorised to stop at
the Isle of France to make myself
acquainted with the periodical winds,
the port, present state of the colony,
&c. That such conduct being s
violation of neutrality, he ordered
colonel Monistrol to go on boatd
the Cumberland, and in my pre-
sence to collect into one or more
trunks ad other papers which might
add to the proofs already acquired ;
and after sealing the trunks, I was
to be taken back to the house where
my suspicious conduct had made
it necessary to confine me from the
instant of arriving in the port. It
was further ordered, that the crew
of the schooner should be kept on
board the prison ship; and that an
inventory should be taken of every
thing in the Cumberland, and the
stores put under seal and guarded
conformably to the regulations.
“ Such w'as the answer given to
my request for the repairs of the
schooner to be commenced. In
compliance with their order the
officers took me on board, and the
remaining books and papers, whe-
ther relating in any way lo the In-
vestigator’s voyage or not, even to
letters received from my family and
friends during several years, were
all taken away, locked up in a
trunk, and sealed, Mr. Aken and
myself were allowed to take ouy
clothes, but the officers dared not
venture to let me have any printed
books ; i must however do colonel
Monistrol and M. Bonnefoy the
justice to say, that they acted
throughout wdth much politeness,
apologizing for what they were ob-
liged by their orders to execute;
and the colonel said he would make
a representation to the captain-
general, who . doubtless Jay under
jsomc mistake.

prised.

Readily felt by every Englishman
who has been subjected, were it
only for a day, to French revolu-
tionary power. On returning to
»ny place of confinement, I imme-
diately wrote and sent tbe following
letter, addressed to His Excellency
the captain-general De Caen, go-
vernor in chief, &c. &c. &c. Isle of
France.
SIR,
From your order, 'which was ex-
plained to me this morning, I find
that the plea for detaining me is
not now that I do not appear with
the Investigator, according to the
letter of my passport fro id the first
consul of France; but that I have
violated the neutrality therein re-
quired by having given in myjournal,
as an additional reason for putting
into this port, that “ it would ena-
ble, me to acquire a knowledge of
the, periodical winds, and of the pre-
sent state of the French colony;
how far it or its dependencies in
Madagascar might be useful to Port
taekoa, and how tar if would be a
convenient place for me to touch at
in my future expected voyage:” I
quote from memory only, my jour-
nal being in your possession. How
this remark, made upon the suppo-
sition of our two nations being at
peace, can be d breach of neutralir
ty, I. acknowledge myself unable
to di' Cover. Nothing can, in my
opinion, add to the propriety of the
intentions with which 1 put intp
this port, but I shall justify it by
the example of your own nation; and
to do so, it is only necessary for me
to refer to the instructions which
preface the published voyage of the
unfortunate La Perous, by the judi-
cious Fleurieu. Your Excellency
will there see, that the much la-
mented navigator was ordered to
make particular observations upon
the trade, manufactures, strength,
situation, &rc. of every port where
he might touch; so that, if the ex-
ample of your own nation be taken
as a standard of propriety, the plea
for making me a prisoner is altoge-
ther untenable. Upon the suppo-
sition even of its being war, and
that I knew it and still intended to
make the observations expressed in
my journal; upon this incorrect and
worst supposition I have, I think,
an example of similar conduct in
your own nation; unless you -can
assure me that the captains Baudin
and Hamelin made no such remarks
upon Port Jackson, for it was a de-
clared war at the time they lay in
that port. But were they forbidden
to make such remarks and notes
upon the state of that English co-
lony? Upon its progress, its
strength, the possibility of its be-
ing attacked with advantage, and
the utility it might afford to the
French nation ? 1 tel] you, general
De Caen, No. The governor in
chief at Port Jackson knew too well
the dignity of his own nation,
cither


either to lay any prohibition upon
these or to demand to
see what their journals might con-
tain.
“ I shall next appeal to you as
being the Representative in this,
place of a great nation, which has
hither to shown itself forward to pro-
tect and encourage those sciences
by which the knowledge of man-
kind is extended or their condition
ameliorated. Understand then, Sir,
that I was chosen by that, patron of
science Sir Joseph Banks, president
of the Royal Society of London, and
one well known by all the literati
throughout the world, to retrace part
of the track of the immortal captain
Cook, —to complete what in New
Holland and its neighbourhood he
bad left unfinished, —and to perfect
the discovery of that extensive
country. This employment, Sir,
as it was congenial to my own in-
clinations, so I pursued it with
avidity; upon it, as from a convex
Jens, all the rays of knowledge and
Science which my opportunities
have enabled me to collect, were
thrown. I was unfortunate in that
ship decayed before the voyage
was qompleated; but the captain-
general at Port Jackson, who is
also the senior naval officer there,
was"so sensible of the importance of
the voyage and of the zeal with
which I had pursued it (for the
truth of which 1 appeal to hi? let-
ters now in your possession}, that
he gave me a colonial ship of war to
transport me with my officers,
charts, &c. to England, thgt I might
obtain another ship in which rhe
'voyage might be completed. In
this second ship I was a passenger ;
and in her, shipwreck and the loss
of charts which had cost me much
labour and many risks to m ike per-
fect, were addeJ to my first mis-
lorttine; but my zeal suffered no
abatement. 1 returned to Pert
son (734 miles) in an open boat,
and gol a merchant ship which was
bound to china, hired to carry my
officers and people to «-nt;!: , nd by
that Circuitous .route; bir - e sirous
of losing no time I took a small
schooner of twenty-nine 'ons, a mere
boat, in order to reach England by a
nearer passage, and thus gain two or
th e monthsof time in the outfit of
my future expected dup; making my
own ease and sifety to stand in no
competition with the great object of
forwarding my 'oynge. rcessity,
and not inclination, obliged me to
put in at Ihe Isle, of France in my
route.
“ Now, Sir, I would beg to ask
you whether it becomes the French
nation, independently of all pass-
port, to stop the progress of such a
voyage, and of which the whole
maritime world are to receive the
benefit r How contrary to this was
her conduct some years since to-
wards captain Cook ! But the world
highly applauded her conduct then ;
and possibly we may*sometime see
what the general sentiment will be
in the present case. *
“ I sought protection and assist-
ance in your port, and I have found
a prison; rneasa man, Sir,
—judge for me as a British officer
employed in a neutral occupation,
—judge for me as a zealous philan-
thropist, what I must feci at being
thus treated.
“ At present' I quit the subject
with the following rt quests : that I
may be permitted to have .my
printed books on shore ; and that
my servant may be allowed to attend
pie in my apartment.

my situation to the captain general,
I am

fi The lapse of several years has

actions of this period under different
views, to regard them wish almost
the coolness of an unitu rested ob

a dispassionate reader may accuse
me of taking too high a position, and
using too warm a style,—in rather
giving way to the dictates of feeling
than dwelling upon the proofs of
my innocence; perhaps also, he
may accuse me of vanity, in seek-
ing to enhance my own zeal and
claims. Without attempting to
controvert these censures, I beg him
to consider all the circumstances of
my situation : my voyage, ship-
wreck, and anxiety to pursue the
steps of our celebrated navigators.
Let him suppose himself to have
executed so much of the same task,
escaped the same dangers ; and un-

tives to reach England with expedi-

misfortunes either not heeded or
converted into proofs of deUnquencjg

various recollections crowding on

et On the day following the trans-
mission of the letter, my servant
was brought on shore from the pri-
son ship, where he left Mr. Char-
rington and the seamen closely con-
fined; but no answer was returned
either on the 2*2ud or 23rd, nor did
we hear any thing that cquld give
an insight into what further was in-
tended to be done. We suffered
much from the heat of the weather
and want of fresh air; for the town
of Port Louis is wholly exposed to
the rays of the sun, whilst the
mountains which form a semicircle
round it to the east and south, not
only prevent the trade wind from
reaching it, but reflect the heat in
such a mannpr, that from Novem-
ber to April it is almost insupport-
able. Dining this season, the in-
habitants whose affairs do not ob-
lige (hem to remain, fly to the high-
er and windward parts of the island;
and the others take the air and (heir
exercise very early in the morning
and late in the evening. We who
were shut up in the middle of the
town, and from having been three
months confined to a vessel of
twenty-nine tons were much need
of exercise, could not but f eel the
personal inconveniences of such a
situation in their full rigour; and the
perturbation of mind, excited by
such unworthy treatment, did not
tend to alleviate their effects on our
health. But the heat and want of
fresh air were not (he worst evils.
Our undefended pallet beds were
besieged by swarms of bugs and
musketoes, and the bites of these
noxious insects upon bodies ready
to break out with scurvy, produced
effects more than unu.aliy painful
and disagreeable. Being almost
covered with inflamed spots, some
of which had become ulcers on my
legs and feet. I wrote to the captain’
general, requesting the assistance of
a surgeon ; and also to know under
what limitations he would'allow me
to write to the Admira ty of Great
Britam, and to my family and
friends:- but the main subject was
left untouched, in expectation of an
answer to the former letter,
, f ‘ Ip the afternoon, one of thef
aides-de-camp


aides-de-camp said that His Excel-
lency did not prevent me from writ-
ing to whom I pleased; but that
my letters must be sent open to the
town major, who would forward
them to their address. The same
evening a surgeon, who did not
speak English, cartie to our room ;
next morning he returned with the
interpreter, and finding the ulcers to
be scorbutic, ordered me, in addition
to his dressings, to drink plentifully
of lemonade and live upon fruit and
vegetables. Their visit was re
peated on the following day: but
nothing transpired relative to the
general’s intentions, nor to any an-
swer proposed to be given to my
fetter of the 21st; and I therefore
wrote another in the following
terms.
SIR,
From whatever cause it may be
that I have received no answer to
my letter of the 21st last, I shall yet
continue to do my duty to my go-
vernment and the cause of discovery,
by pointing out every circumstance
that may have a probability of in-
ducing you to liberate my people,
my vessel, and myself.
“A former letter showed, that
upon the principles adopted in voy-
ages of discovery by your own na-
tion, the plea for detaining me a
prisoner was untenable; and also
that independently of any passport,
it ill became the French nation to
stop the prosecution of a voyage of
discovery, especially one carried on
with the zeal that mine has hither-
to been. In this letter I shall en-
deavour to point out another cir-
cumstance, at least as important as
the former, so far as regards the in-
justice of my detainer. In this
point of view then, Sir, I shall ad-
mit, that to make any remarks upon
q port which might enable either
myself or others to come into it
again with more facility, or which
might give information concerning
the refreshment and articles of com-
merce to be procured as it, is, al-
though made in the time of peace,
a crime ; and consequently, that if
La Perous executed his instructions,
he was no better than a spy at the
different ports where he put in. Let
this. Sir, for the moment be ad-
mitted; and I ask what proofs you
have that I have made such remarks?
You will probably say, I intended
to make them. True, but intention
is not action. I might have altered
my intentions on coming into the
port, and finding our two nations to
be at war : you cannot know what
alterations such a knowledge might
have made in my sentiments. Wedo
indeed judge much of the merit or
demerit of an action by the inten-
tion with which it is performed j
but in all cases there must be an
action performed to constitute any
certain merit or demerit amongst
men. Now in my case there ap-
pears to have been intention only j
and even this intention I have be-
fore shown to be consistent with the
practice of your own nation, and I
believe of all nations.
“ As it appears that Your Excel-
lency had formed a determination
to stop the Cumberland, previously
even to seeing me, if a specious pre-
text were wanting for it, it would
have been more like wisdom to have
let me alone until the eve of sailing,
and then to have seized ray journal;
where it is possible something bet-
ter than intention might have been
fixed upon as a cause for making
me a prisoner. This would have
been a mean action, and altogether
unworthy of you or your nation ;
but it might have answered your
purpose better than the step now
taken. I say there appears to have
been


been a previous determination to
stop the Cumberland, and from this
causq; thaf on the first evening of
my arrival, and before any exami-
nation was made into my papers
(my commission and passport ex-
cepted), you told me impetuously
that I was imposing upon you. Now
I cannot think that an officer of
your rank and judgment could act
either so ungentlemahlike, or so un-
guardedly, as to make such a decla-
ration without proof; unless his
reason had been blinded by passion
or a previous determination that it
should be so, nolens vo/ens. In your
order of the 21st last it is indeed
said, that the captain-general has
acquired conviction that I am the
person I pretend to be, and the
same for whom a passport was ob-
tained by the English government
from the First Consul; it follows
then, a* I am willing to explain it,
that I am not and was not an im-
postor. This plea was given up
when a more plausible one was
thought to be found; but I cannot
compliment Your Excellency upon
this alteration in your position, for
the first, although false, is the most
tenable post of the two.
f* Trusting that upon a due con-
sideration of all the circumstances,
you will be pleased to fulfil the in-
tention for which the passport was
given, I have the honour to be,
Your Excellency’s obedient
. servant,
Matthiw Flinders.
From my confinement,
Dec. 25, 1803.
“ In the evening, a letter was
brought me by a soldier from gene-
ral De Caen, and the haste with
which it had been sent inspired fa-
vourable hopes; 1 did not expect the
visit of the interpreter until the fol-
lowing day, and therefore attempted
to decipher the letter by the help of
a French dictionary, with a degree
of anxiety which its contents were
but little calculated to satisfy : it
was as follows.
“ I did not answer your letter of
the 21st December, Sir, because it
was useless to commence a debate
here between you and me, upon the
motives well or ill founded from
which I took upon myself to stop
the Cumberland until further orders.
On the other hand, I should have
had too much advantage in refuting
your assertions, notwithstanding
the reasonings and quotations with
which you have adorned them.
“ I was still willing to attribute
the unreserved tone you had used in
that letter, to the ill humour pro-
duced by your present situation, I
was far from thinking that after
having seriously reflected upon the
causes and circumstances, you should
take occasion from a silence so deli-
cate to go still further; but your
last letter no longer leaves me an
alternative.
“ Your undertaking, as extraordi-
nary as it was inconsiderate, todepart
from Port Jackson in the Cumber-
land, more to give proof of an offici-
ous zeal, more for the private inte-
rests of Great Britain than for what
had induced the French government
to give you a passport, which I shall
unfold at a proper opportunity, had
already given me an idea of your
character ; but this letter overstep-
ping all the bounds of civility, ob-
liges me to tell you, until the gene>-
ral opinion judges of your faults of
of mine, to cease all correspondence
tending to demonstrate the jus-
tice of your cause ; since you know
so little how to preserve the rules of
decorum.
“ The accusation of not preserv-
ing


sng she rules of decorum, seemed,
not a little extraordinary from one
who had kept me above two hours
in the street when I had gone to
wait upon him, and who had qua-
lified me with the title of impostor
without examination ; but it seemed
tiiat any act of aggression on the
part of the general was to meet only
with submission and respect. Em-
barrassment sheltering itself under
despotic power, was evident in this
letter; but it gave no further in-
sight into the reasons for making
me a prisoner, and consequently no
opportunity of vindicating my in-
nocence. it therefore seemed wisest,
seeing the kind of man with whom
I had to deal, to follow his direc-
tions and leave the main subject to
the operation of time; but to take
off my mind from dwelling too in-
tensely upon the circumstance of
being arrested at such a conjuncture
I determined to employ it in for-
warding my voyage, if an applica-
tion for the necessary papers should
be attended with success.
“ Having obtained a translation
of tire general’s letter from the in-
terpreter; who came next morning in
company with the surgeon, I wrote
to request,
“ is*. My printed books from
the schooner.
“ 2d. My private letters and pa-
pers out of the secretary’s office.
“ 3rd. To have two or three
charts and tlxree or four manuscript
books, for the purpose of finishing
the chart of the Gulph of Carpen-
taria : adding in explanation, that
the parts wanting were mostly lost
in the shipwreck, and I wished to
replace them from my memory
and remaining materials before it
were too late. For these a receipt
was offered, and my word (hat no-
thing in the books should be erased
or destroyed j but I fished to .make?
additioiisto one or two of the books
as well as to the charts, and would
afterwards be, ready to give up the
yvhole.
“ 4th. I represented a complaint
from my seamen, of being shut up
at night in a place where not a
breath of air could come to them j
which, in a climate like this, must
be not only uncomfortable in the
last degree, but very destructive to
European constitutions. Also, that
the people with whom they were
placed were affected with that dis-
agreeable and contagious disorder
the itch 3 and that their provisions
were too scanty, except in the arti-
cle of bread, the proportion of
which was large, but of a bad
quality. .
“ An answer was given on the
same day by one of the general’s
aides-de-camp, who said that orders
had been given for the delivery of
the books and papers ; that the
place where the seamen were kept
was very wholesome ; and as to the
provisions, that orders had been
given on my .arrival for the people
of the Cumberland to be treated as
French seamen in actual service;
that he would inquire whether any
thing contrary had been done, which
he did not think, but in that case it
should be set right.
“ At noon next day colonel Mo-
nistrol and M. Bonnetoy called, and
a trunk was brought from on board
the schooner, containing a part of
of my printed books. The colonel
seemed to be sorry that my letters,
to the general had been couched
in a style so far from humble, and
to think that they might rather
tend to protract than terminate my
confinement; on which I observed,
believing him to be in the general’s
confidence, that as my demand was
to obtain common justice, an adu-
latory style did not seem proper,
more


tnore especially when addressed to
a republican who must despise it:
niy rigliXs had been invaded, and I
used the language natural to a man
so circumstanced. Had favours been
wanted, or there had been any
thing to conceal, my language would
probably havo been different : but
of all things I desired that the
strictest scrutiny should be made
into my papers, and that it should
be confronted with any examina-
tion they might choose to make of
myself or people. The colonel and
interpreter, either from politeness
or conviction, did not .disagree with
these sentiments, bat repeated that
a different mode of-writing might
have answered better ; it appeared,
indeed, from their conversation,
that French republicanism involved
anything rather than liberty, jus-
tice, and equality, of which it had
so much boasted. ,
“ So soon as the two gentlemen
were gone, I took out ray naval
signal book from the trunk arid
fore it to pieces; the private sig-
nals had been lost in the shipwreck,
so that my mind was now' freed
from apprehensions which had given
me much inquietude.
“ On the 28th, M. Chnpotin,
the surgeon, called as usual with
the interpreter. He said that air
and exercise were necessary to the
re-establishment of my health, and
that so soon as I should be able to
walk our, it would be proper to ap-
ply to the general for a permission ;
and on my objecting to ask any
thing like a personal favour, he
promised with some degree of feel-
ing to take the application on
himself.
“ No mention was made this day
of lire books and papers, to be deli-
vered from the scaled trunks; but
next morning I was conducted to
the government house, and took
out nil my private letters and pa-
pers, the journals of bearings 'anc|
astronomical observations, two log
books, and guch charts as were ne-
cessary to completing the Gulph .of
Carpentaria ; tor which a receipt
was required, without any obliga-
tion to return them. The third log
book, containing transactions and
remarks in different vessels during
the preceding sis months, was im-
portant to me on many accounts,
and especially for the. observations it
contained upon Torres’ Strait and
the Gulph; but it was said to be
in the/ hands of the geneial, who
could not bo disturbed, and two
boxes of dispatches from governor
King and colonel Paterson had been
taken away. All the other books,
and papers, including ray passport,
commission, &c. with some accounts
from the commissary of New South
Wales, and many private letters
from individuals in that colony,
were locked up in a trunk and seal-
ed as before.
“ On the 31st I sent to the town-
major’s office an open ' letter ad-
dressed to the secretary of the Ad-
miralty, -giving a short account of
my embarkation ana shipwreck m
the Porpoise, voyage in the Cum-
berland, and situation in Mauritius ;
with two private letters, and a re-
quest that they might be forwarded
by the first opportunity. Next day
the receipt of them was acknow-
ledged, and a promise given to in-
form me of the means by which
the.y should be sent, and :t was dene
accordingly; biu _ not cue of the
letters, or of their duplicates, was
ever received,
“ Having calculated with Mr,
Aken the observations previously
taken for the rate of the. time keep-
er, I now worked earnestly upon the
chart


chart of the Gulph of Carpentaria ;
and this employment served to di-
vert my chagrin, and the indigna-
tion which, however useless it
might be, I could not but feel at
the author of our imprisonment.
The want of my log book, however,
was a great obstacle to laying down
the parts seen in the Cumberland ;
and nothing more having been said
of it, a short letter was written to ge-
neral De Caen on the sth, remind-
ing him that the log was necessary
to the constructioa of my charts,
and that only a small part of the
printed books had yet been deli-
vered. A verbal answer was brought
by the interpreter? and two days af-
terward the books came fiom the
schooner} but respecting the log
90 answer was made.
“The sentinel placed at the doors
of our chambers (fur we bad a few
days before obtained a second, with
musketo curtains to our beds), be-
came unusually strict at this time,
scarcely allowing the master of the
tavern, or even the interpreter or
surgeon to see us } and one day,
hearing me inquire the name of
some dish in French from the slave
who waited at dinner, the sentinel
burst into the room and drove away
the poor affrighted black, saying
that we were not to speak to any
person. Previously to this a Dutch,
a Swiss, a Norwegian, and two
American gentlemen had .called }
but except the Swiss, who found
means to bid us good day occa-
sionally without being noticed, not
one came a second time, for fear
of being held in a suspicious light
by the government} and now, the
surgeon and interpreter were not
admitted without a written order.
Two applications had been made by
the surgeon in my behalf, to walk
in the fields near the town} the
last was personally to the capfafff-
general, but although he might
have caused a sentinel to follow, or
a whole guard if thought necessary,
an unqualified refusal was given to
M, Chapotin’s humane request.
“ We were lodged and supplied
with meals in the tavern at the
public expense; but having lost
part of our clothes in the ship-
wreck, and distributed some to those
of our companions who had saved'
nothing, both Mr. Aken and myself
were much in want of linen and
other necessaries; and after the few
dollars I chanced to have about me
were gone, we knew not bow to
pay for our washing. All strangers
being refused admittance took away
the chance of negotiating bills, for
the surgeon spoke no English, and
the interpreter always avoided the
subject } one morning, however,
having previously ascertained that it
would not give umbrage, the inter-
preter offered to attempt the nego-i
tiatien of a bill drawn upon the
commissioners of the navy but the.
sentinel, seeing him take a paper,
gave information, and M. Bonnefoy
was scarcely out of the room when
a file of soldiers made him prisoner;
nor, although a public officer, was
he liberated until it was asceitained
that he acted with permission, and
had received no other paper than,
the bill. Jn the evening he brought
the full sum, at a time when bills
upon England could obtain cash
with difficulty at a discount of 30
per cent. It was the chevalier Pel-
grorn, who filled the offices of Da-
nish and Imperial consul, that had
acted thus liberally ; and he caused
me to be informed, that the fear of
incurring the general’s displeasure
bad alone prevented him from of-
fering his assistance sooner.
“ Although Mr, Aken and my-
self


self were strictly confined and close-
ly watched, my servant was left at
liberty to go upon my commis-
sions; and orlce a week I sent him
on board the_ prison ship, to. take
Mr. Charrington and the seamen a
basket of fruit and vegetables from
the market. They had, always
been permitted to walk upon deck
in the day time, and latterly been
sometimes allowed to go into the
town, accompanied by a soldier;
and since from all we could learn,
the final decisidn of the captain-ge-
neral was yet in suspense, I augured
favourably of the result from this'
relaxation towards the men. My
hopes became strengthened on the
14th by learning from M. Bonnefoy
that it was believed we should be
permitted to walk out, and perhaps
depart altogether, so soon as three
Dutch ships commanded by rear-
admiral Dekker should have sailed.
These ships were loaded with pep-
per for Batavia, and bound'to Eu-
rope; and it seemed possible that
one reason of our detention might
be to prevent English ships gaining
intelligence of them by our means ;
but this could be no excuse for close
imprisonment and taking away my
charts and journals, whatever it
might be made for delaying our de-
parture. .
“ Finding it impossible to ob-
tain the third volume of my log
book, the charts of Torres’ Strait
and the Gulph of Carpentaria were
finished without it; fortunately the
journal kept by Mr. Aken in the
Cumberland had not been taken
away, and it proved of great assist-
ance. Our time passed on in this
manner, hoping that the Dutch
ships would sail, and that general
De Caen would then suffer us to
depart, either in the Cumberland
of some other way; the surgeon
came'almost daily, on account of
my scorbutic sores, and the inter-
preter called frequently. I was care-
ful not to send out my servant of-
ten, for it appeared that he was
dogged by spies, and that people
weic afraid of speaking to him;
the surgeon and interpreter were
almost equally cautious with me,
so that although in the midst of a
town where news arrived continu-
ally from some part of the..world,
every thing to us was wrapped in
mystery; and M. Bonnefoy after-
wards acknowledged, in answer to
a direct question put to him, that
an order had been given to prevent
us receiving any intelligence.
“ On the 29th, admiral Dekkcf
sailed with his three ships; and whilst
anxiously expecting somecommu-
nication, the interpreter called to
inform me that an order had been
given for the schooner to be moved
up the harbour, and the stores to
be taken pst; and he wished to
know if Mr. Aken should be pre-
sent at making the inventory. L
asked what was to be done with
us, —with my books and papers?
To which he answered by a shrug
of the shoulders : he had come only
for the purpose of executing his
order. On each of the two follow-
ing days Mr. Aken was taken down
to the schooner; for he accepted
the proposition to accompany the
officers for the sake of the walk,
and in the hope of obtaining some
intelligence. He found the poor
Cumberland covered with blue
mold within side, and many of the
stores in a decaying state, no pre-
cautions having been taken to pre-
serve her from the heat or the
rains ; the French inventory was
afterwards brought to him to' be
signed.


signed, but he refused, it with my
approbation.
This new proceeding seemed
to bespeak the ra plain-general to
have finally taken his resolution to
keep us prisoners; and my disap-
pointment at seeing it, instead of
receiving back my books and pa-
pers and permission to depart, was
extreme. In the hope to obtain
some information I wrore a note
on the 3d, to solicit of His Excel-
lency the honour of an audience;
and five days having elapsed with-
out an answer, llm interpreter was
requested to deliver a message to
the same effect. He presently re-
turned-'with the concise answer,
Mo ; but afterwards told me in con-
versation that the general had said,
* captain Flinders might have
known that I did not wish to see
Men, by not giving an answer to
his note! . It is needless for me to
see him, for the conversation will
probably be such as to oblige me
to send Rim to the tower.’
** My intention in requesting
the audience was to have offered
certain proposals to the general’s
consideration, and if possible to ob-
tain some explanation of the rea-
sons for a detention so extraordi-
nary, and now protracted beyond
six weeks : and being disappointed
in this, a letter was written on the
1 eth, containing the following pro-
positions.
* f Ist. If your Excellency will
permit me to depart with my ves-
sel, papers, &c. I will pledge my
honour not to give any information
of the Isle of France or any thing
belonging to it, for a limited time,
if it be thought, that I can have
gained any information; or if
judged necessary, any other re-
strictions can be laid upon mo-, If
this will not be complied ■■with, I
request,
“ ad, to be sent to France.
“ 3rd. But if it be indispensa-
ble to detain me here, I request
that my officers and people may be
permitted to depart in the schooner j
as well for the purpose of informing
the British Admiralty where I am,
as to relieve our families and friends
from the report which will be
spread of the total loss of the Por-
poise and Cato, with all on board.
Mr. Aken can be laid under what
restrictions may be deemed requi-
site ; and my honour shall be a se-
curity that nothing shall be trans-
mitted by me, but what passes un-
der the inspection of the officer
who may be appointed for that
purpose.
“ In case of refusing to adopt
any of these modes, by which my
voyage might proceed without pos-
sibility of injury to the Isle of
France, 1 then reminded his Excel-
lency that since the shipwreck of
the Porpoise, six mouths before,
my people as well as myself had
been mostly confined either upon
a small sand bank in the open sea,
or in a boat, of otherwise on board
the Cumberland, where there was
no room to walk, or been kept
prisoners as at that time ; and that
I had not previously recovered
from a scorbutic and very debili-
tated state, arising from eleven
months’ exposure to great fatigue,
bad climate, and salt provisions.
After noticing my scorbutic sorct,
and his refusal of the surgeon’s ap-
plication for me to walk out, it was
added—The captain-general best
knpws, whether my conduct has
deserved, or the exigencies of his
government require, that I should
continue to he closely confined in
this


this sickly town and cutoff from
society ; but of no part of this let-
ter was any notice taken.
“ Two days before, I had been
favoured with a visit from captain
Bergeret of the French navy, who
had commanded La Virginie frigate
when taken by Sir Edward I’el-
lew, and of whose honourable con-
duct in the affair of Sir W. Sydney
Smith’s imprisonment, public men-
tion had been made in England.
This gentleman sat some time con-
versing upon my situation, which
he seemed desirous to ameliorate ;
he said that ‘ the general did not
consider me to be a prisoner of
war, and that my confinement did
not arise from any thing I had
done.’ Frum what then did it
arise ? At this question he was
silent. He regretted not to have
been in town on my arrival, be-
lieving it would have been in his
power to have turned the tide of
consequences 3 and obligingly of-
fered to supply me with money,
if in want.
<( During a fortnight from this
time, no incident occurred worth
notice. My scorbutic sores being
much better, the surgeon came but
seldom; and the visits of the in-
terpreter being less frequent than
before, our solitude was rarely in-
terrupted. The Gulph of Carpen-
taria and Torres’ Strait being finish-
ed, my time had since been em-
ployed in writing an explanatory
memoir upon the latter chart ; Mr.
Aken was occupied in copying the
journal of bearings for the Admi-
ralty, and my servant in transcrib-
ing the two first volumes of the log,
which had been torn and defaced
in the shipwreck; so that our time
did not pass wholly in vain. It was
the completion of the charts, how-
ever. that I had most at heart'; and
1814.
although the success of an appli-
cation for more materials werd very
doubtful, an essay to obtain them
was made on the 27th, in the fol-
lowing letter to the captain gene-
ral.
“ Sir,
“ The term of my imprison-
ment being lengthened out much
beyond my expectation, puts me
under the necessity of making an-
other application ’to Your Excel-
lency for more books and charts,
that I may still proceed in com-
pleting the account of my observa-
tions and discoveries. If the whole
were put into my possession it
would be ef much service to my
labour, and save Your Excellency
from being troubled with any fur-
ther application on this head; but
if this will not be complied with, I
beg to make a small selection from
them, which will principally con-
sist of a roll of charts. lam not
however to deceive your Excel-
lency ; this roll contains the
greater part of .my original fair
charts, and I am desirous to have
them principally for the purpose of
making an, abridgment of my dis-
coveries upon a single sheet. With
all due consideration, lam
Your Excellency’s prisoner,
Matthew Flinders.
“ This letter was no more fortunate
than the last, and it seemed that
general De Caen had determined
upon giving me no answer to any
tiling.
“The Admiral Aplin, an extra
Indiaman outward hound, on board
of which were several officers of
the at my and four ladies, had been
brought in as a prize 3 the ladies
with their husbands were suffered
to remain at a tavern in the town,
at the instance of captain Ikrgeret,
G fey


by whose privateer, La Psyche, they
hid been taken ; the others were
sent to a house at a little distance
in the country, where all the En-
glish officers had been a short time
confined. I ventured to send my
servant to the tavern, to inquire
after my countrymen and women ;
and they obligingly furnished me
with magazines, newspapers, and a
Steele’s List of the Navy, up to Au-
gust 1803, which in such a place,
and after so long an ignorance of
what was passing in England, were
highly acceptable.
“On March 1, the interpreter
made a personal application to ge-
neral De Caen concerning the books
and charts mentioned in my last
letter: to which he received for
answer, that so soon as the governor
was a little freed from business be
would attend to this request- I
asked M. Bonnefoy to give me his
©pinion of what was likely to be
< done with us? He replied that we
should probably be kept prisoners
*0 long as the war lasted, but might
perhaps have permissionjo live in
some part of the island,
and liberty to take exercise within
certain limits. This opinion sur-
prised me; but I considered it to
be that of a man unacquainted with
the nature of a voyage,of discovery,
and the interest it excites in every
nation of the civilised world, and
not the least in France. To be li-
berated in an honourable manner
by an order of the French govern-
ment, so soon as it should be in-
formed of my detention, appeared
to be certain ; for whatever colour
general De Caen might give to his
proceedings, it could not be dis-
guised that he had arrested the
commander of a voyage bearing a
French passport, and had taken
from him his charts,, journals, and
vessel j but as yet I could not be
persuaded that the general would
risk the displeasure of his govern-
ment, and particularly of the first
consul Bonaparte, by whose order
my passport had been given, and
who had professed himself to be a
patron of science. A voyage of dis-
covery undertaken upon liberal
principles, and carried on with zeal,
tempered with humanity towards
the inhabitants of the countries vi-
sited, seemed to me an object to
interest every person, of whatever
nation or profession. The philoso-
pher, or man of general science,
would see his knowledge of the
globe, and of man, its principal
inhabitant, so much the object of
such a voyage, that he might con-
sider it as undertaken for his grati-
fication } and he who professed a
particular branch, whether of natu-
ral philosophy or natural history,
would expect so many new obser-
vations and discoveries in his fa-
vourite pursuit, that the voyagers
could not fail to have his best
wishes for their success. A pro-
fessor of the fine arts might expect
new and striking subjects to be
brought to light, upon which to
exercise his genius and display bis
powers ; the merchant and manu-
facturer would anticipate fresh aids
to their industry, and new markets
for its produce; and the seaman,
from such a voyage, would expect
the discovery of new passages and
harbours, to which he might 1 have
recourse either for convenience or
safety j and he would also see in
it the adoption of the best means
for advancing his art to perfection!
The philanthropist and zealous
Christian would have delight in-
observing the blessings of civiliza-
tion thus continually extending-
themselves, and in seeing new fields'
opened


Opened in which',to sow the seeds
of righteousnessand even the man
without profession, science, or zeal,
—the perfectly idle, could not be
.without interest in a voyage of dis-
covery, 'since the gratification of
curiosty is an object qf at as
much concern with them as with
any other class of men. Consider-
ing, thus, a voyage for the investi-
gation of new countries as of ex-
tensive interest and importance, it
was with difficulty I could be con-
vinced that there were people who
/thought it of none; or of so little,
that the putting a stop to it, im-
prisoning the commander and seiz-
ing his charts and papers, required
no more consideration than if it
were ( a common voyage. Tobe kept
a prisoner so long as the war should
lasted not therefore enter into
.my cqnceptipn as within the bounds
,qf probability j but it is the failing
of men' of all professions to over-
rate the importance of that which
they have themselves adopted, and
into this error It will probably be
thought I had fallen with respect to
voyages of discovery.
.“-JiVe had a second visit pn the
6th ; from captain Bergeret, to
whom the passengers of the Aplin,
and particularly the married gen-
tlemen, .were indebted for much
attention and indulgence. He seem-
ed to think- ( that nothing could at
this,time be able, to procure our
release, but that we might perhaps
be permitted to live in the country j
and he promised to interest himself
in it, so soon as a proper time and
opportunity could be found for
speaking to the captain-general.
Cf The season was arrived in
which, should we be set at liberty,
it ,would be too late to attempt a
passage ,round the Cape of Good
Hope in the schooner, and before
the return of another year, the
stores, and perhaps the vessel itself,
might be rotten ; and having no
hope to obtain an answer to a tet-
ter, I requested Mr. Bonnefoy to
make an application to the general
for permission to sell the Cumber-
land. , Ten days afterward th»
interpreter informed me, that
general De Caen had spoken
to,him of my wish to live in the
country, which bad been made
known to him by captain Bergeret;
and he desired him to tell me, 1 to
have a little patience, he should
soon come to some determination
upon my affairbeing spoken to
upon the sale of the Cumberland,
his reply was, ' a little patience, it
is time enough yet $ and when the
qharts and books .for which I had
applied on Feb. 27, were mention-
ed, he still gave the same answer.
" My people were, brought on
shore on the 23d, with other Bri-
tish subjects from the prison ship,
in order to be sent to a district
called Flacq, on the east side of
the island; and this circumstance
confirmed my suspicion that it was
not intended to liberate us until
order? were received from France.
Mr. Charrington, the boatswain,
was permitted to speak to me in
the presence of an officer before
j and after learning
the condition of the poor prisoners,
I recommended him to’ keep our
people as clean in their persons and
regular in their conduct as circum-
stances would permit; and not to-
attempt any escape, since we must
be liberated in six or eight months
by order of the .French govern-
ment. One of them, the Prussian
who had behaved so ill, had gone
away in the Spanish rigatc Fama,
G 2 by


by permission of the French; the
others had' been 'kept strictly on
board the prison ship after the ‘de-
parture of the three Dutch men of
war. Although several prizes had
been brought in; the number of
English prisoners was inconsidera-
ble ; owing to some of the vessels
being manned with lasCars who
were not confined, and in part to the
sailors having been induced to en-
ter on board the French privateers,
for the sake of obtaining more pro-
visions and to avoid being kept in
irons.
“ I had hitherto forborne to
write any letters to England, -whe-
ther public or private, but what
passed open through the office of
the town major, that no plea, even
■what arbitrary power could construe
into such, might be taken for con-
tinuing our imprisonment; but the
arrival of letters thus sent being ex-
ceedingly problematical, and my
hope of liberation from general De
Caen having disappeared, the mo-
tive for this forbearance had ceased
to exist. An account was therefore
written to the secretary of the Ad-
miralty of my arrival, reception,
and treatment in Mauritius, inclos-
ing copies of all the letters written
or received, that my lords commis-
sioners might be enabled to fake
proper measmts for obtaining our
liberty and the restitution of my
charts and journals; especial care
was taken at the same time, to
avoid the,'mention of any thing
which could be thought to infringe
on the passport, as much as if it
had remained' inviolate on the part
of general Dtt Caen. This letter
-was inclosed to a friend in Lon-
don, and sent by the way of Ame-
rica ; and I afterwards learned
from the public papers that it
vyas received in the August fol-
lowing,
“ The end of March had ar-
rived, and nothing more was said
of our permission to reside in the
country; and being most heartily
wearyof close confinement, I re-
quested to be removed to the same
place with the British officers, pri-
soners of war; the house where
they were kept being described to
be large, and surrounded witli a
wall inclosing about two acres of
ground, within which the prisoners
were allowed to take exercise. On
the 30th Colonel Monistrol came to
confer on the subject, and next day
conducted me to the house for the
•purpose of choosing two rooms. He
said on the way that the house was
originally built by a surgeon named
Despeaux, and now hired by the
government at twenty-five dollars
per month to accommodate the
English gentlemen; that it was
very spacious, and had formerly
lodged the ambassadors sent by
Tippoo Sultaun to this island; I
found it to be situate about a mile
north-east from our tavern in the
middle of the town, and enjoying
a fresh air which, in comparison
with our place of confinement,
made me think it a paradise. After
the unpleasant task of selecting two
rooms, which colonel Monistrol
ordered to be vacated by the officers
who were in possession, he return-
ed with me to the town ; and pro-
mised at parting to speak again to
the captain-general concerning my
charts and books.
,<f This little walk of a mile
shewed how debilitating is the
want of exercise and fresh air; for
it Was not without the assistance of
colonel Monistrol’s arm, that I was
able tp get through it. Convey-
ances


ances sent in the evening for
our trunks, and v/e took possession
of our new prison with a consider-
able degree of pleasure ; this change
of situation and surrounding ob
jects producing an exhilaration
of spirits to which we had . long,
been strangers.
An Account of the Inhabitants or Westrobothnia.
[From Schioldebrand’s Tour to the North Cape.]
<c Westrobothnians are, in
general, tall and well-made.
Their figure is. noble, their coun-
tenance proud and confident; but
this haughtiness is tempered by a
marked expression of benevolence,
and their manners perfectly corres-
pond to their physiognomy. The
men |iave more mildness in their
character than their neighbours the
Ostrobothnians, and the beauty of
their women is much superior. This
honest, sober, and frugal, people
are alike distinguished for their
courage in War, the hunting of the
bear, and in ascending or descending
the falls, &c. Whilst more polished
nations content themselves by de-
fining the various gradations of vir-
tue, the Westrobothnians practise
them all, in a happy ignorance of
their opposite vices.
The Finnish language prevails
from the frontiers of Ostrobothnia,
which separate Finland from Swe-
den properly so called, to within
two or three miles to the west of
Tornea, where the Swedish is used,
and thence northward about twenty
miles; after which the colonists
only speak Finnish, and the natives
in the Lapland tongue. This is the
country through which we had
passed.and are now describing.
The dress of the men consists of a
bonnet of deep blue, in the shape of
a cap, with the of another
colour j a kind of tunic, or shirt, of
strong white serge, which comes
down to the calf of the kg; a lea-
ther belt 3 long breeches 3 boots, or
buskins, without heels, the soles be-
ing of the same piece, and the
seams above the foot, uniting near
the toe, which terminates in a re-
turning peak. These boots are so
well prepared as to resist moisture
a long time, and nothing can be
better adapted for walking in the
marches, which arc so frequent in
these countries.
The principal objects of industry
are agriculture* the preparation of
tar, breeding of cattle, the chase,
and fishing. The soil is fertile, and
the same fields are sown every year.
The corn ripens in seven or eight
weeks; but such is the rigour of
the climate that, during this short
period, the frosts frequently destroy
the hopes of the cultivator. Fortu-
nately, the inhabitants are accus-
tomed, during the most abundant
harvests, to mix with their bread
chopped straw, the roots of Certain
plants, or the bark of the pine-tree;
and this practice enables them to
support those famines which are
but too frequent.
The salmon fishery, of which we
have already spoken, is extensive.
Another species of salmon, called
Taimen, the flavour of which is de-
licious, is found here; but not in
sufficient plenty to be an article of
commerce. This fish, which is also
found


found in Ostrobothnia, is rather
smaller and more spotted than the
common salmon. Pike and trout,
dried i nt he sun, form pa r t of the food
of the inhabitants. The birds found
in this country have been enumerated
when describing the game in the
neighbourhood of Uleaborg, but
there are some others which will be
noticed hereafter. The most re-
markable wild beasts are bears,
wolves, common, black, white, or
blue, foxes, (the last are very rare,)
gluttons, beavers,seals, otters, hares,
squirrels, martins, ermines, wild
rein-deer, which are in every re-
ject like the tame, except in being
of deeper colour.
As to the birds and vegetable
kingdom, I shall speak of them as
they occur. In Lapland and on the
Siigh mountains, plants unknown in
other climates are more particu-
larly to be found.
On quitting Kirkomaki, near the
church of Hietanierai, and the in-
undated plain I have mentioned, we
continued to coast the river of Tor-
nea, until we got to Niemis, where
the road turns from it. The coun-
try, which is rather hilly, al-
most continually presented pleasing
views.
It. was the season of flowers. In
ame places the soil of the forests,
covered with anemonies, (neviorosa)
Appeared white as snow 5 in others
different anemonies (hcpaticaj gave
it an enamel of the deepest blue.
The marshy spots were gilded with
the calla pahistris, or silvered by
the rulus charntemorus. The first
of these plants, called in Swedish
missne, is of great service to the
inhabitants; in case of scarcity they
make bread of its roots, which are
taken up in the spring, before the
leaves begin to bud, and cut into
small pieces, and dried by the fire
previously to beipg ground. If the
meal is boiled before it is used, and
then a little common flour added to
it, the bread is very good and nou-
rishing. The other plant, called
hjortron , has a yellowish fruit, of a
faint taste, but it is a good preserve,
and is said to refresh and purify the
blood. It is administered to persons
ill of fevers, scurvy, or consumption.
Geraniums (myosotis scorpoides)
flourished on the banks of the rivu-
lets', and the lively verdure of the
meadows was relieved by numbers
ofotherflowers, as the cornus suesica
with white petals and black sta-
mens ; the trientalis Europtea , a
small star-like flower, which is
found no where but in the forests j
the rulus arcticus, a plant of the
size of the strawberry, and the
flower of which, of a deep rose-
colour, is as beautiful as its fruit is
delicious, &c.: red and black goose -
berries, as also raspberries, grow in
the woods.
The heavy clouds which had ob-
scured the sky, after the sudden
storm of the preceding evening,
dispersed by degrees 5 and an agree-
able warmth made us forget that
we were near the polar circle. On
the road to Niemis, the last post-
house, about a mile from Kirko-
miiki, we crossed the last bridge
over the little river of Armasjoki,
which discharges itself into that of
Tornea at no great distance. On
the left bank of this river, the rock
of Luppio, rising like the ruins of a
vast castle, is composed of horizon-
tal layers of granite and slate, which
are rarely found together.
The church of Ofver Tornea is a
mile and a quarter from Niemis, and
six and a half from the town of
Tornea. Here the road gradually
disappears, and at length becomes
nothing more than a foot-path lead-
ing to the curate’s house. It is
practicable to go from Tornea in
a boat.
