FOREWORD.
The celebration of the Golden Jubilee of the foundation of the Bureau
of Sugar Experiment Stations is an important event, not only in the annals
of the sugar industry but in those of Australian agriculture as well.
Perhaps only at this distance can we fully appreciate the foresight and
sagacity of those leaders who, before the turn of the last century, advocated
and planned an organisation which was to weld science and industry so
early and so effectively.
The activities of the Bureau fall naturally into two distinct periods of
about twenty-five years each. Beginning in what must now be regarded
as the early morning mists of scientific agriculture, the first period was
predominantly one of exploratory observation and recording, the assessment
of problems, and the development of facilities. The second period was
characterised by the recruitment of highly-trained staff, the initiation of
researches inspired by the knowledge previously gained, and the organisa-
tion of comprehensive extension services.
Technical progress in the sugar industry during the second period was
notable: Cultural and fertilizer practices were rationalised on the basis of
many field experiments; losses from the world's most serious aggregation of
sugar cane diseases were reduced to near-insignificance; the major insect
pests were brought under satisfactory control; cane-breeding was revived and
already more than half the crop is produced from Queensland-bred canes;
manufacturing processes were transformed from traditional to technically
devised and controlled practices. During this period, and in spite of the
serious disruption caused by the war, production and recovery of sugar per
acre increased by 50 per cent.
As is commonly the lot of successful organisations, the Bureau has
experienced the compliment and disabilities of becoming a training and
recruiting ground for other phases of endeavour. During the past 25 years
only four members of the staff have passed through the age of 50 in the
service of the Bureau, while throughout its history only one officer has retired
under the statutory age limit provisions!
The policies and direction of the Bureau and the Industry it serves have
always been closely integrated, and the continuance of relations on this high
plane will ensure future success. Much has been achieved but much remains
to be done. In the words of Sir William Whetham —
“ But beyond the bright searchlight of science,
Out of sight of the windows of sense.
Old riddles still bid us defiance,
Old questions of Why and of Whence.”
ARTHUR F. BELL,
Under Secretary.

The Foundation and Development of the Bureau
of Sugar Experiment Stations.
By NORMAN J. KING.
INTRODUCTION.
Considering the age of some of the
world’s cane- sugar industries Sugar
Experiment Stations are a relatively
recent development and Queensland was
not very far behind some of the earliest;
it was certainly much in advance of
others. The first Sugar Experiment
Stations created were those of Louisiana
and Java, both of which began activities
in 1885. Hawaii followed ten years later,
St. Kitts in 1899, and Queensland in 1900.
Argentine, Puerto 1 Rico, and Trinidad
inaugurated similar, institutions in 1907,
1910, and 1911 respectively, and in 1925
Cuba followed suit. Two years later both
Peru and Natal Experiment Stations
came into being, and Mauritius Sugar
Cane Research Station started up in
1930.
There is some degree of satisfaction in
the knowledge that a short thirty-seven
years after the start of the sugar indus-
try in Queensland both the industry and
the Government realized the benefits
which could accrue from scientific
research. The sugar producers of this
State can also, with justification, be
proud of the fact that theirs was the first
agricultural industry in Australia to
possess its own research organization.
From small beginnings the Bureau of
Sugar Experiment Stations has become a
powerful factor in the technical advance-
ment of the industry, and is, year by year,
making progressively greater contribu-
tions to the efficiency of both agricul-
tural and factory operations.
The Bureau, in 1950, completes its first
half century of service to the Queens-
land sugar industry and looks forward to
a further period of service to the pro-
ducers and manufacturers who have, by
their continued support, acknowledged
the advances made.
EARLY HISTORY.
Although the Bureau of Sugar Experi-
ment Stations began its official existence
with the assent to “The Sugar Expert-
ment Stations Act of 1900,” which was
.given on 14th December of that year,
many negotiations of historical and
industrial interest predated that event. As
early as 1885 the then Under Secretary
for Agriculture (Mr. Peter McLean)
investigated the necessity for establishing
experimental farms or test stations, and
as a result of his enquiries he advocated
two State Nurseries at The Lagoons,
Mackay, and Kamerunga, near Cairns,
to.be used for sugar cane and other tropi-
cal crops. By 1889 the Mackay Nursery
was established and that at Kamerunga
followed it two years later. These nur-
series functioned to the advantage of the
industry for several years, and both the
Cowley and Tryon cane collections were
grown at, and distributed from, those
centres. By 1894, however, the industry
was dissatisfied with the nurseries because
of the lack of scientific investigation into
soils and cane varieties, and an agitation
developed for sugar experiment stations
and laboratories along the lines of certain
overseas sugar cane producing countries.
Both Henry Tryon, Government Ento-
mologist and Pathologist, and J. C. Brun-
nich, Agricultural Chemist, were warm
supporters' of the scheme, and official
notice of the industry’s requirements was
indicated by a statement by the then
Minister for Agriculture, the Hon. A. J.
Thynne, M.L.C., that he proposed to add
a laboratory to the State Nursery at
Mackay. This was erected in 1898 in
accordance with plans drawn up by J. C.
Brunnich. A. A. Ramsay, later chemist
to the New South Wales Department of
Agriculture, was the first chemist in
charge.
This development appeased only tempo-
rarily the growers’ oft-repeated requests
for full scale sugar experiment stations,
and in the next year it was announced
that the State Nursery would be done
away with and the site used on a more
satisfactory basis as a Sugar Experiment
Station. At the same time sugar growers
approached the Government to invite Dr.


Mackay Sugar Experiment Station during developmental period.
Walter Maxwell, then Director of the
Sugar Experiment Station of the
Hawaiian Sugar Planters’ Association, to
visit Queensland to advise on the industry,
the initial steps being taken by the Bunda-
berg Planters’ and Farmers’ Association.
Dr. Maxwell was accordingly invited by
the Government to undertake an exami-
nation of the industry and he arrived in
Queensland on 9th December, 1899.
As a result of his report on the indus-
try and on the essentiality of establish-
ing sugar experiment stations, the Cabinet
in March, 1900, wrote to Dr. Maxwell
asking him to transfer his services to this
State and offering him the position of
Director at a salary of £3,000 per annum.
This offer was accepted and Dr. Max-
well arrived to take up his new appoint-
ment in November of that year. “The
Sugar Experiment Stations Act of 1900,”
which was passed in the following month,
provided, inter alia, for the establishment
and control of Sugar Experiment
Stations, the appointment of a Director,
and the creation of a Sugar Fund.
In his earlier report to the Government
Dr. Maxwell, in outlining a desirable
scheme, suggested that three experiment
stations should be established —one at
Mulgrave, one at Mackay, and the third
at Bundaberg—the last mentioned to be
the headquarters of the Director and of
the main laboratory and chemical staff. On
his appointment, the existing station and
laboratory at Mackay became one of the
planned units in the chain, and opera-
tions were put in hand immediately to
construct the main laboratory and head-
quarters at Bundaberg. This building,
which was opened in August, 1901, occu-
pied the site of what is now the Lands
Department building on the bank of the
Burnett River and remained as the
central laboratory of the Bureau until
1910. H. T. Easterby was Assistant
Director in charge of the Mackay Sugar
Experiment Station from the beginning
of operations, while the first chemists
engaged at the central laboratory were
Firman Thompson, who returned to the
United States in 1902, Dr. A. J. Gibson,


G. R. Patten, C. H. O’Brien, and A. E.
Anderssen. A. R. Henry, who later became
Secretary of the Central Cane Prices
Board, was the Secretary of the Bureau
at that time.
Between 1900 and 1909 this remained
the administrative headquarters and
laboratory of the Bureau while the
Maekay Station was used for the basic
investigational work on varietal testing,
manurial trials, cultivation experiments,
&c. A system of canegrowers’ substations
was inaugurated—stretching from Moss-
man to Nerang —and these served for the
conduct of experimental trials on a wide
range of subjects and under the varying
soil and climatic conditions of the State.
Dr. Maxwell severed, his connection with
the Bureau in March, 1909, and thus did
not see his original plan of a chain of
experiment stations come to fruition.
The Bureau of Sugar Experiment
Stations now came, for the first time,
into direct relationship with the Depart-
ment of Agriculture and Stock, the then
Under Secretary, E. G. Scriven, being
also Director of the Bureau. In the
following year, 1910, H. T. Easterby
resigned to take up a position in the
beet sugar industry in Victoria, and was
succeeded by A. J. Gibson, who served
for twenty-one months as General Super-
intendent. Easterby returned to the
Bureau at this time and remained until
his death in 1932. In 1921 he became
Director, and during his long period of
office saw the Bureau develop into a
potent factor in the scientific progress
of the sugar industry.
ENTOMOLOGICAL RESEARCH BEGINS.
In 1911 the initial steps were taken in
entomological research with the appoint-
ment of A. A. Girault as entomologist
at Nelson (now Gordonvale) in North
Queensland. The white grub of the grey-
back beetle was the worst scourge of the
industry in that locality and growers had
agitated for some time for the appoint-
ment of an entomologist to study the
pest and to evolve control measures. This
appointment was the modest beginning of
the entomological division of the Bureau,
which in 1917 moved to its present site
at Meringa and which by that time con-
sisted of Dr, J. F. Illingworth, E. Jarvis,
A. A. Girault, and A. P. Dodd.
The period since the inauguration of
this division has been marked by a vast
amount of investigational work into pest
control problems, but always with a heavy
emphasis on the “greyback” grub. Sub-
sequent upon Dr. Illingworth’s return to
America in 1921 E. Jarvis assumed con-
trol of the entomological activities and
continued to direct the work until 1934.
During those years his assistants included
R. W. Mungomery, J. H. Buzacott, W. A.
McDougall, W. Cottrell-Dormer, G.
Bates, A. N. Burns, and J. E. Murcott.
R. W. Mungomery took over from Jarvis
in 1934 and during the following year
visited Hawaii to study the habits and
economic importance of the giant Ameri-
can toad (Bufo marinus) prior to arrang-
ing the importation of a colony into
Queensland. He later became officer in
charge of the Division of Entomology
and Pathology. G. 'Wilson was appointed
an Entomologist in this Division when
J. H. Buzacott became Senior Cane
Breeder.
There is perhaps no more spectacular
example of industry progress as the direct
result of research than the control of the
“greyback” grub and wireworm pests in
Queensland. The remarkable success
achieved by the correct use of benzene
hexachloride will be remembered as a
major event in our agricultural history.
THE BUNDABERG EXPERIMENT STATION.
The year 1913 witnessed the acquire-
ment of a further property at Bunda-
berg for a Southern Sugar Experiment
Station and thus a further link was
welded in the chain originally planned.
This property was purchased as a going
concern, having previously been a cane
farm, and it was considered at that time
to be ideally situated for an experiment
station. In later years a laboratory and
office building was constructed and this
was followed by a glasshouse and neces-
sary seedling equipment, as well as an
irrigation plant and all essential farm
buildings. By reason of the fact that
the Bundaberg station was larger than

the original Mackay one and comprised
a fairly uniform area of an important
soil type, the major quantity of the
Bureau’s field investigational work was
centred there. Practically every phase of
fertilizer usage, liming, cultivation, green
manuring, and soil moisture relationships
have been enquired into and a host of
other subjects have been experimented
with to a greater or lesser degree. As
from August, 1912, Bundaberg was the
headquarters of the Bureau, but before
long the General Superintendent trans-
ferred his office to Brisbane, which has
since been the administrative head-
quarters. The first officer in charge at
Bundaberg was J. Pringle who had been
Assistant Chemist since 1908, and he was
followed in 1937 by the writer, and in
1948 by H. G. Knust, the present occu-
pant. As from 1926 an entomological
laboratory and insectary were established
on the Bundaberg station, with R. W.
Mungomery in charge, for the purpose of
studying and developing control measures
against the southern district cane pests.
SOUTH JOHNSTONE EXPERIMENT
STATION INAUGURATED.
In 1917 it was decided to complete the
original plan of three experiment stations
by establishing the third unit in the tropi-
cal north. A site at South Johnstone, at
the foot of the Basilisk was chosen and
consisted of average quality land of a
type common to many North Queensland
districts. Buildings, including labora-
tories and offices were erected, and the
first officer in charge was P. H. McWalters
who remained in that position until his
retirement in 1927. In 1934 the station,
then in charge of E. J. Barke, was trans-
ferred to Meringa, near Gordonvale,
which had since 1917 been the head-
quarters of the Bureau’s entomological
research. It was felt that the northern
operations of the Bureau could be
rendered more effective by co-ordinating
all services through one station and that
the cane-breeding, entomological, and
general agricultural work could be per-
formed efficiently at Meringa. Up-to-
date laboratories were constructed and
equipped for the performance of all
analytical work, a large glasshouse for
seedling production was erected, and land
cleared for the field experimental studies.
MACKAY EXPERIMENT STATION
IS MOVED.
At about the same time it was thought
that the Mackay station should be moved
to a more suitable site. The old station,
the starting point of the Bureau work,
was a difficult location for field experi-
ments due to irregularities in soil and to
restriction in acreage. Expansion of
activities demanded more room and even-
tually an area of land, part of thd Palms
Estate, was purchased —some 70 acres in
extent and typical of the average lands
of the Pioneer Valley. The buildings
were transferred to the new site, a glass-
house and other buildings added, an irri-
gation plant installed, and the land suit-
ably subdivided and graded for field
experiments. After H. T. Easterby left
the Mackay Station in 1910 the work at
that centre was successively in the charge
of L. C. McCready from 1910 to 1917,
J. L. Foran to 1919, P. Keogh to 1935,
D. L. Mcßryde to 1946, and C. G. Story
to date.
In 1928 an entomological laboratory
was established at this station to investi-
gate wire-worm and grub pests which
were causing serious losses. W. A.
MeDougall was appointed to the district
in 1931 as Assistant Entomologist, and
carried out studies and investigations into
control measures until his transfer to the
Department of Agriculture in 1948.
Between the years 1900 and 1931 the
Bureau therefore expanded its activities
from having one Sugar Experiment
Station and one soils laboratory to three
Experiment Stations, one entomological
station, two entomological laboratories, as
well as the administrative offices and
laboratories in Brisbane. Although the
original plan was now complete it was
felt that one further experiment station
was required in the Lower Burdekin
area. The area is extensively irrigated
and is climatically different from the rest
of the sugar belt. It was considered, with
justification, that its peculiar problems
could not be investigated effectively by


a single extension officer and that Experi-
ment Station research was necessary.
Accordingly, an area of land was pur-
chased in 1948 and during the past two
years developmental work has been pro-
ceeding. The first cane plantings were
made this year. With an area of 90
acres it is hoped that this station will
become an important one in the Bureau
network and that its contribution to
local cane production will be of value.

MILL TECHNOLOGY DIVISION IS CREATED.
In 1929 was established the Division
of Mill Technology with N. Bennett as
Sugar Technologist. Although originally
located at Mackay, with laboratories at
the Sugar Experiment Station, it was
found desirable, on the resignation of
Bennett in 1932, to transfer the Division
to Brisbane, where suitable headquarters
existed. Between this date and 1935 the
sugar technology work was carried on by
E. R. Behne and D. L. Mcßryde and in
the latter year Ir. J. Eigenhuis was
appointed for three years as Engineer
Technologist. At the same time N. Smith
joined the Division but resigned in 1937.
Successive appointments were those of
Gr. H. Jenkins, A. 11. Praeger, and J. L.
Clayton. Ir. Eigenhuis resigned in 1938
and he was succeeded as Mill Technolo-
gist by E. R. Behne. During and subse-
quent to the war years several staff
changes took place including the elevation
of Behne to the successive positions of
Assistant Director and Director ; in 1918
he resigned to join a sugar milling com-
pany. In 1945, J. PI. Nicklin was
appointed as Engineer to the Division
and subsequently J. L. Clayton was made
Senior Mill Technologist with six assist-
ants in the persons of C. B. Yenton,
D. L. Mcßryde, L. R. Brain, R. G.
Adkins, A. D. Doolan, and A. Claire. An
assistant engineer was added in 1950.
These nine members are the present
personnel of the Mill Technology Divi-
sion. The work of this Division was so
intimately connected with milling and
manufacturing problems that exceptional
interest was evinced by the milling side
of the industry in the details of opera-


tion and in the projects to be undertaken.
Accordingly, in 1936, an informal meet-
ing of milling representatives resulted in
the formation of a Mill Research Pro-
gramme Committee which would meet
annually and consider a programme of
research for the Bureau Mill Technology
Division in the ensuing season. This
committee, consisting of nominated
representatives from each mill, has since
that time met each year to discuss with
Bureau staff the desired mill research
work, and the programme laid down at
these meetings becomes the subject
matter for investigation.
SOILS LABORATORY.
Reference was made above to the trans-
fer of Bureau headquarters from Bunda-
berg to Brisbane. Until the approximate
date of this change the Bundaberg soils
laboratory had, in conjunction with the
Mackay laboratory, handled very large
numbers of soil and water analyses for
the Queensland canegrowers. In 1911,
however, it was decided to carry out this
important phase of the Bureau’s work in
Brisbane where better facilities existed,
and to allow the Mackay laboratory to
concentrate on sugar cane analyses.
Accordingly, G. R. Patten and J. Pringle
who had been on the chemical staff since
1902 were transferred to Brisbane where
they continued to carry on the work in
the laboratories of the Agricultural
Chemist. In 1914 C. R. von Stieglitz was
appointed to the staff but in the follow-
ing year G. R. Patten was transferred to
the Agricultural Chemist’s branch, while
J. Pringle returned to Bundaberg to take
charge of the Sugar Experiment Station.
From this time until 1930 the Bureau soils
work was carried out in the Agricultural
Laboratory, but in that year new adminis-
trative officers and laboratories were
built for the Bureau in the main Agricul-
ture and Stock building. C. R. von
Stieglitz was Analyst in charge and N. G.
Cassidy was appointed as Research Assist-
ant in 1930.
During the ensuing fifteen years soil
and plant nutrition studies formed the
major part of the work of this branch
and in the same period analytical labora-

tories were equipped at both Meringa and
Bundaberg stations. The work carried
out was closely associated with field
studies and emphasis was at all times
laid on correlation of laboratory results
with replicated field trials. In 1945 a
departmental reorganization resulted in
C. R. von Stieglitz transferring to the
Agricultural Chemist’s Branch and the
appointment of L. G. Yallance as Chemist
to take control of this section. At the
present time the staff comprises L. C
Home, K. C. Leverington, G. C. Bieske,
and J. R. Burge, the laboratory work
still being directed by Mr. Yallance, who
is now Assistant Director.
FIELD ADVISORY SERVICES,
As distinct from the development of
Sugar Experiment Stations with their
technical staffs, direct contact with the
canegrowers has been maintained by field
advisory staff since the early years of
the Bureau. During the period of Dr.
Walter Maxwell’s administration a
definite emphasis was placed on soil
analysis and the contacts with farmers
were, in the main, connected with soil
sampling and related advisory duties. It
was not until 1912 that a start was made


to appoint field instructors, but within
two years H. T. Harvey and H. G. Burn
were located in the north and south
respectively, their duty being to give
general advice to canegrowers on any
problem associated with sugar cane agri-
culture. Harvey died in 1915 and Avas
replaced by A. P. Gibson, and Burn, who
resigned in the same year was replaced
later by J. C. Murray. In 1921 E. H.
Osborn joined the field staff. A few
years later W. Cottrell-Dormer, the first
cadet pathologist, began field studies of
certain of the major cane diseases and
in the period 1925-1926 he was joined by
E. J. Ferguson Wood, N. L. Kelly, and
G. Wilson.
The establishment' of the Pathology
Division was followed by several staff
changes, and by 1934 none of the cadet
pathologists mentioned above remained
with the Bureau. C. G. Hughes was
appointed in 1934 and D. R. L. Steindl
in the following year, and at the present
time these two pathologists are respon-
sible for the disease control work. W. D.
Gibbons was appointed as cadet patholo-
gist in 1944 but was replaced three years
later by B. T. Egan.
11l 1929 when the reorganization of the
Bureau took place G. Bates was trans-
ferred from the Entomological to the
Agricultural Divison and assumed respon-
sibility for carrying out all field trials in
the far north. Between 1933 and 1936
G. A. Christie, C. G. Story, S. 0.
Skinner, and H. G. Knust joined the
field staff, and from 1939 to 1941 further
appointments included N. MeD. Smith,
J. T. Elliott, E. V. Humphry, R. A.
Abbott, and E. A. Pembroke.
This staff is responsible for the carry-
ing out of the field experimental pro-
gramme of work (as distinct from Sugar
Experiment Station work) and for hand-
ling the extension and advisory work of
the Bureau.
The outbreak of war witnessed the
enlistment of practically all of this staff.
Fortunately all returned. Certain staff
losses and promotions in later years
necessitated further recruitments and
within the past five years 0. W. D. Myatt,
J. H. Barrett, P. J. Cheetham, N. G.
Graff, W. Stern, J. Anderson and
A. A. Matthews have been added to the
Field day at Meringa Sugar Experiment Station. Visitors are listening to an address
by a member of the Bureau staff.


number. Barrett and Cheetham have
since been transferred to other branches
of the Department of Agriculture.
The geographical extent of the Queens-
land sugar industry makes necessary the
presence of resident field officers at
several centres not served by Experiment
Stations. The above-mentioned staff
members are accordingly stationed in the
Cairns, Ayr, Maekay and Bundaberg
districts where the Experiment Stations
are their headquarters, and also at Innis-
fail and Nambour, where district work is
sufficiently important to justify it. This
distribution, mil, do doubt, extend
further as the demand for services grows.
OVERSEAS TRAINING OF BUREAU
STAFF.
About the year 1922 the then Direc-
tor appreciated the necessity for further
highly trained personnel, particularly a
sugar cane pathologist. This position
was advertised in Australia and abroad
but no suitable applicant was forth-
coming. It was then realised that the
sugar industry would have to train its
own men and at that time the late Chief
Justice McCawley, who was a Senator of
the University, suggested to the Minister
for Agriculture that three 3-year scholar-
ships be awarded, the holders to under-
take to work in the Queensland sugar
industry for at least three years on com-
pletion of their courses. The Director,
to whom this recommendation was
referred, quickly recognised the advan-
tage that would accrue to the Bureau and
he therefore recommended that three
selected students who had graduated in
various branches of science should pro-
ceed abroad to study soils and agriculture,
plant pathology and mill technology
respectively. The recommendation was
approved by Cabinet and in 1924 H. W.
Kerr, A. F. Bell and N. Bennett were
selected for these studies. On their
return to this State, in 1928, all three
joined the Bureau of Sugar Experiment
Stations and in the following year took
charge of the Divisions of Soils and
Agriculture, Pathology and Sugar Mill
Technology which had been formed as the
result of a reorganisation.
ADVANCES IN AGRICULTURAL
RESEARCH.
It was not long before the recom-
mendation to train men overseas was vin-
dicated and the scientific work of the
Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations
proceeded at a new and increased tempo.
New staff was recruited and trained and
full use was made of the relatively new
methods of field experimental technique.
Field fertility trials —firstly of a quali-
tative and later of a quantitative type--
were laid down in all cane-growing dis-
tricts and these were made complement-
ary to a programme of soil survey and
soil analysis. For the first time a true
picture of the plant food deficiencies and
responses of the various soil types began
to be obtained and, as the years passed,,
fertilizer recommendations could be
made, with surety and with a high degree
of precision.
Such . associated subjects as green
manuring, trash conservation, molasses
as a soil amendment, soil acidity and
liming, cultivation methods, irrigation,
&c., were the subjects of extensive experi-
mentation, and growers in the industry
showed an increasing interest in the prac-
tical application of the results of this
work. Considerable increase took place
in the field staff personnel who were in
the main responsible for the planting
and harvesting of the trials and for the
extension service.
SPEEDY RESULTS FROM PATHOLOGY
RESEARCH.
Similar spectacular advances were
soon apparent in the pathology division.
At the time of formation of this divi-
sion Queensland was in the unenviable
position of having present a greater
number of major sugar-cane diseases than
any other cane-growing country.
Gumming, downy mildew, leaf scald, Fiji,
chlorotic streak, mosaic, red rot and red
stripe were all taking their toll and there
was a dearth of resistant varieties. A
vigorous policy of varietal introduction
from overseas countries was instituted
and this was combined with the division
of the State into quarantine areas, a
system of disease-resistance trials, a pro-

gressive cane breeding programme and
the establishment of control measures in
diseased crops. The combination of pre-
vention, eradication, cane breeding and
legislative control paid rapid dividends.
A miscellany of useless or below average
varieties ceased to be planted and an
approved variety list was issued for each
mill area. Cane plant selection with
simultaneous destruction of _ badly
diseased fields resulted in healthier and
better yielding crops. The introduction
of varieties resistant to the particular
disease and the establishment, under
Sugar Experiment Stations Acts of
Disease Control Boards which regularly
rogued all stools found affected with
certain diseases, all contributed to the
final result. To-day, gumming disease no
longer exists in the State, downy mildew
is apparently under complete control and
Fiji disease has been restricted to a
relatively small area. Cane breeding has
given a supply of varieties which are
mostly resistant to mosaic and the inci-
dence of other diseases is decreasing
annually.
Much of the credit for this improved
■state of affairs can be given to the excel-
lent legislative measures which have been
incorporated within “The Sugar Experi-
ment Stations Acts, 1900 to 1948.” The
1938 Amending Act introduced such
major changes as the approved variety
list, the various measures relating to
■destruction of diseased crops, and the
Cane Pest and Disease Control Boards.
These Boards have, through their super-
visors and inspectors, done invaluable
work in reducing the incidence of disease
and, in some cases, in completely
eliminating it.
THE SUGAR EXPERIMENT STATIONS
ADVISORY BOARD.
During 1933 industry interest in the
work of the Bureau attained such a high
pitch that, at the invitation of the then
Minister for Agriculture a Sugar Experi-
ment Stations Advisory Board was
formed. Two representatives from the
Queensland Cane Growers’ Council, one
from the Australian Sugar Producers’
Association, and one from the Queensland
Society of Sugar Cane Technologists,
together with the Director of Sugar
Experiment Stations and the Minister
for Agriculture and Stock (as Chair-
man) constituted the Board. The Minis-
ter and the Director act as permanent
members of the Board but the industry
representatives are elected each three
years. All matters of policy affecting
the workings of the Bureau are discussed
at meetings which are convened every
three or four months and the industry
nominees are enabled to advise on any
subjects and to report back to their
organisations. All sections of the indus-
try are thus able to assist in the framing
and implementation of Bureau policy and
to ensure that the Sugar Fund is
expended wisely and to the maximum
advantage of both millers and growers.
HOW THE BUREAU IS FINANCED.
The Act of 1900 provided for the
establishment at the Treasury of the
Sugar Fund out of which are paid all
expenses incurred by the Governor in
Council, the Minister or the Director in
the execution of the Act. Provision is
made for the levying of an assessment
for each year on every ton of sugar cane
received at a sugar works, the assessment
being paid and borne by the owner of
the sugar works and the grower of the
cane respectively in equal proportions.
These contributions were endowed by

1934 provided that the total endowment
should not exceed £7,000 in any one year.
The work of the Bureau of Sugar
Experiment Stations has eminently justi-
fied the intention of the prime movers
who were responsible for its creation,
and it can be confidently held that,
during the past half century, it has been
run economically, and the results of its
work have benefited the industry in no
small degree. The rates of assessment
have been low and have been fixed from
year to year in accordance with the
programme of work and having due
regard to the limitations of the Act.
The Bureau of Sugar Experiment
Stations in Queensland is an integral
part of the Department of Agriculture
and Stock and as such is a Government
instrumentality, although financed in


the main by industry monies. The
Government has been fully appreciative
of the benefits likely to accrue to the
industry as a result of overseas
experience, and during the past 26
years several members of the staff have
visited other sugar-cane producing
countries and passed on the knowledge
thus gained to the local growing and
milling interests. No less than ten mem-
bers of the Bureau staff have had the
benefits of such overseas experience and
the selection of the personnel was such
that each of the divisions of Soils and
Agriculture, Pathology, Entomology, Mill
Technology, and Cane Breeding were
adequately represented. Advantage has
also been taken of overseas experience
in another way since five members of the
staff were at different times recruited
from other countries.
PUBLICATIONS.
Under the Acts the Director is required
to submit to Parliament in each year a
report covering the activities of the
Bureau.' Such reports, to be readable,
must of necessity be limited as to detail
and it is essential that separate publica-
tions be issued on various subjects for
the dissemination of such knowledge as
mayjbe of value to the different sections
of the industry.
During the earlier years of the Bureau
a series of Farm Bulletins was the
principal avenue used for relaying to
canegrowers advice on cultivation
problems. Technical publications of the
same period concentrated principally on
entomological investigations. In the
twenties several pathology Bulletins were
issued to advise growers on means of
identification and methods of control of
cane diseases.
It was in the thirties, however, that
publications were placed on a more
regular basis. The increasing scale of
field investigational work made essential
some means of rapid dissemination of
advice on all phases of agricultural work,
and accordingly the Canegrowers’
Quarterly Bulletin was started. This
publication has been issued since 1933,
and contains, in readily understandable
form, all information gleaned from the
Bureau’s field and laboratory work. A
short time later the need was felt for a
research publication to deal with more
technical phases of the organization’s
work, and a start was made with the series
of Technical Communications which
have been issued since that time. These
cover the work of the Divisions of Mill
Technology, Entomology, Pathology and
Agriculture as well as laboratory, and
cane breeding studies. The Mill
Technology Division has also issued in
recent years a periodical News Letter to
keep mill executives informed on items
of interest.

The History of Sugar Soils Investigations and
Agricultural Research.
By L. G. VALLANCE.
Mr. L. G. VALLANCE, Asst. Director.
It is not often that the opportunity
arises to look back over half a century
of work, and it is of interest to recall
the statements made prior to its com-
mencement by Dr. Walter Maxwell, who
shortly after became the Bureau’s first
Director. Reporting on a survey of the
sugar industry’s needs in 1899, he said,
“evidence has been furnished that no
system of rational fertilisation has
existed; that the cane lands in the main,
have never received manures, and where
manures have been used, it has not been
by those methods which are known to
command results In the matter
of cultivation, it is made to appear . . .
that the modes of handling* the land have
been crude and superficial.” Coming
from an agriculturist who was familiar
with the major overseas sugar growing
areas, these statements paint rather a
dismal picture of the agricultural
efficiency of the Queensland industry at
the close of last century. He made no
secret of his opinion that this young
industry could profitably adopt the
methods of scientific research which were
being successfully utilised in the much
longer established industries in other
parts of the world. This lesson was
taken to heart and throughout the years
Queensland’s sugar industry has con-
sistently refused to isolate itself. It has
always shown a readiness to exchange
ideas and information with overseas and
to-day the efficiency of the production
on the agricultural side compares very
favourably with that of any other sugar
growing area having due regard to
natural advantages and limitations.
A first step to place cane land cultiva-
tion and management on a more scientific
basis was the appointment of Maxwell
as Director of the newly-formed Bureau
of Sugar Experiment Stations. In addi-
tion to the investigation of all phases
of the industry his intention was to
advise “in all matters of the field, such
as the selection of lands suitable, and
leaving out of lands unsuitable for cane;
the individual acts of cultivation; the
resting and rotating of the soils with
other crops; the introduction of other
economic crops and sources of profit, and
the instituting of new means for the
restoring and maintaining of the produc-
ing power of lands. To examine soils in
the field and take samples for analyses in
the laboratories, and to advise manures
according to the ascertained requirements
of each soil and location.” And so in
the first annual report of the Bureau of
Sugar Experiment Stations for the year
1901-1902 it is recorded that 573 soil
samples had been taken and that some
2,413 analyses had been carried out on
these and on samples of manure, irriga-
tion waters, sugar canes, &c. Truly a
spirited beginning.


The effect of overnight soaking of cane
plants in water. Plants on right not soaked.
The analytical work proceeded apace
and a large and increasing number of
soil samples from all sugar growing
districts was analysed during the next
few years. The last annual report issued
by Maxwell before he relinquished his
position in 1909 stated that some 13,000
analyses of soils, waters, manures, sugars,
&c., were carried out during the year
1908-1909 at the laboratory at Bunda-
berg.
THE COMMENCEMENT OF FIELD
EXPERIMENTATION.
Xo time was wasted in laying out all
manner of field trials. Cultivation
experiments, trials to determine plant
spaeings, and investigations to determine
the effect of lime and various fertilizers
were set down with a great deal of
enthusiasm and energy. Since only one
experiment station, that at Mackay, was
available, farmers were co-opted to
establish and maintain experimental
areas on their properties. In this way a
series of “sub-stations” was soon in
operation and in the annual report for
the year 1902-1903 it is recorded that
fourteen Avere already being conducted.
These were located in Mossman, Mul-
graA T e, Johnstone, Herbert River, Proser-
pine, Burdekin, Bundaberg, Isis, Pialba
and Logan districts. Because of the lack
of field staff and the not very rapid
means of transport, it seems that the
results of the trials Avere furnished in a
report to the Director by the farmer
concerned. This Avas apparently carried
out very conscientiously at the beginning,
since detailed statements of the cost of
the various operations and the yields
obtained were recorded.
INTERESTING RESULTS FROM
SUB-STATIONS.
As might be expected the data obtained
from these farm plots provided useful
information regarding cultivation
methods and farm management practices,
since, irrespective of their investigational
value, they represented the first systema-
tic attempts to record the prevailing
practices of representative growers.
The layout of the trials varied a little
throughout the various localities but in
the main emphasis was laid on the com-
parison of subsoiling, deep ploughing,
fertilizing and the use of lime, with the
procedure described as the farmers’
ordinary cultivation methods. This latter
treatment was apparently rather elastic,
and in the reports of some of the trials
it was remarked that unfortunately the
farmer had deviated somewhat from his
usual methods. Presumably when con-
fronted with advancing science the
enthusiastic “sub-station” experimenter
put his best foot foremost in no uncertain
fashion.
However, thanks to the zeal and energy
of all concerned, interesting results soon
became available and in the fourth
annual report (1903-1904) the following
table of trial figures was published.

General Results of Intensive and Ordinary Cultivation (1903-1904).
These were hailed as a resounding success
for the new methods, and it was said
that “if these farmers have done these
things, then other farmers can do them
if they will determine to follow the same
advices and adopt the same methods...”
It was pointed out that since the
average yield for the State for the past
five years (13.2 tons per acre) was
considerably below that of the experi-
mental plots “there was no reason why
the yield per acre of Queensland, which
is about the lowest in the world, should
not be doubled.”
Value and Cost of Crop Per Acre.
The necessity for the practical
approach to the problem of increasing
production was not lost sight of. In all
these trials a close watch was kept on
the economic angle and detailed costs of
production were submitted for each
treatment. As a typical example the
following figures from the crop harvested
in 1903 on the sub-station located on
Mr. R. Reid’s property, Mundoo, John-
stone R., are worth quoting. These
are given in the table below and there
seems little reason to doubt the recorded
statement that Mr. Reid was perfectly
satisfied with the results.
The detailed production costs make
interesting reading but unfortunately
space does not permit their reproduction.
It might be mentioned however that in
this year (1903) the cost of harvesting
2G tons of cane was £3 ss. By 1907 the
x’atoon crops of these sub-station trials
were completed and no further trials on
farmers’ properties were set out until
1912.


The permanent Trash Trial at Bundaberg
Sugar Experiment Station.
THE FIRST TRIALS ON THE EXPERIMENT
STATION.
With the taking over of the old State
Nursery at Mackay the Bureau acquired
its first piece of land on which to conduct
cultivation, fertiliser and green manurial
trials. It is interesting to note the
emphasis laid on the necessity for
thorough soil preparation from the very
inception of the investigational work.
The first trial in this respect compared
the results of growing cane on land
which had been ploughed to eight inches
with those on land which was ploughed
to one foot and then subsoiled to a
further six to eight inches. A difference
of 20 tons per acre in favour of the deep
cultivation provided the impetus for a
spate of subsoiling trials which were
persisted with for many years. It was
claimed that the results of this trial
showed that the cane produced by “deep,
thorough and subsoil cultivation had a
higher density, higher sucrose, lower
glucose, higher purity and a very notably
less content of fibre . . . .” In the face
of these remarkable results it was
possibly a matter of some disappoint-
ment that the early fertilizer trials gave
only relatively small increases due to
fertilizer. However these were the first
attempts and there was,much to be learnt
about the correct usage of these materials,
and some of the knowledge that to-day
is taken as a matter of. course, was yet to
be gained. For instance, although some
mixed fertilizers were used there was a
bias towards the use of single elements
to determine the respective values of
nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash.
This laudable ambition was negatived by
the application of one element at a time
since undoubtedly the absence of the
other two presented a limiting factor.
However, this was apparently soon
realised, and by the end of 1909 the
results of a number of fertilizer trials,
some extending into the third ratoon
crop, were available. It was recorded
that applications of manure consisting
of nitrate of soda, sulphate of ammonia,
sulphate of potash and superphosphate
had brought about increased yields of up
to 17 tons of cane per acre in the various
ratoon crops. Farmers were advised that
they could obtain a fertilizer formula
for their land by application to the
Experiment Station. Three formulae
were recommended. No. 1 was composed
of sulphate of ammonia, superphosphate
and sulphate of potash in the proportion

fertilizer.
of 7.7 per cent, nitrogen, 7.0 per cent,
water soluble phosphoric acid and 7.7 per
cent, potash. No. 3 was somewhat similar
but contained nitrate of soda in addition
to sulphate of ammonia, and the formula
appeared to be approximately 8 per cent,
nitrogen, 6 per cent, phosphoric acid
and 9 per cent, potash. It was con-
sidered that the increased nitrogen and
potash content Avould be more beneficial
to ratoon crops. For the Geraldton,
Cairns and Mossman areas, No. 2 mixture
was recommended containing 150 lb.
sulphate of ammonia, 300 lb. meatworks
fertilizer and 150 lb. of potash. It was
not explained why the meatworks
material was considered to give better
results in these particular districts.


The lime requirement of the various
soils also received considerable attention,
and amongst the early experiments
several lime trials were set out. The
beneficial results obtained encouraged the
Bureau to recommend strongly that one
ton of lime be applied to cane soils
every four or five years.
It is interesting to note also that, from
the very outset the value of green manur-
ing was recognised and at the first plant-
ings on the station the productivity of
various types was tested. Amongst these
were soya bean, lupins, cowpea, tares,
velvet beans, rape, and Black Mauritius
bean. The use of some of these is
standard practice throughout the indus-
try to-day.
OTHER EARLY TRIALS.
Apparently in these early days the
stripping of trash from the cane during
the growth was a fairly general farm
practice. This was looked upon with
some suspicion by the Bureau, par-
ticularly in view of investigations carried
out overseas about that time. Accordingly
therefore in 1910 it was decided to put
down a trial on Mackay Station to com-
pare early and late trashing versus no
trashing. However, in the following
year it was announced that the trial was
not proceeded with because farmers had,
by now, virtually abandoned the practice.
Whether this latter move was due to the
Bureau’s doubts regarding the value of
stripping or the farmer’s own experiences
is not mentioned. However, the land
which had been reserved for the trial was
planted to cane in order to conduct a
manurial trial. This experiment was
somewhat different from the previous
trials in that the block of land was
divided into two parts. On each portion
a similar fertilizer trial containing five
treatments was put down. In the eyes
of the experimenters the results obtained
were remarkable. They were faced with
the fact the two similarly treated halves
of the trial gave entirely different results.
The experiment was carried on to the
second ratoon crop, as a result of which
the figures apparently became even more
inconsistent and bewildering. It was

concluded that the “interpretation of
such experiments required the greatest
care.”
Whether it occurred by accident or
design, this was apparently the first real
trial on which the results obtained were
not based upon the yields of single plot
experiments. However, the day of statis-
tical analyses of agricultural experiments
had not yet dawned in Queensland, and
with an honest admission: “that many
factors, some known and some unknown,
play their part . . . .”, the Experiment
Station turned its attention to other
matters. One of these was an experiment
to determine whether cane setts from
arrowed cane were as good as setts from
non-arrowed cane. This was set out in
single plots on what was termed to be
an “absolutely” uniform piece of land.

It so happened that at the harvest of
the plant and first ratoon crops the cane
grown from the setts taken from arrowed
cane produced the greatest yield.
TRIAL PLOTS ON FARMERS' PROPERTIES
AGAIN ESTABLISHED.
As previously mentioned, the idea of
substations on farms throughout the
various districts was discontinued in
1907. However, in 1912 it was recorded
that some fourteen experimental plots
were established in the northern and
southern sugar districts. These had three
objectives in view—
(a) To test green manuring, sub-
soiling, use of lime and fer-
tilizers upon varying soils.
(5) To test approved varieties of
cane in different localities.
One of the contour drains in a soil erosion
control experiment at Childers. This
demonstration was put down by the Bureau.
(c) To provide for the distribution
of the approved varieties in
such districts, thus avoiding the
cost of carriage and time lost
between the time of cutting at
Mackay and the receipt of canes
by farmers in far away districts.
This policy was pursued vigorously
for a few years, and a considerable
amount of information was obtained.
Actually the plots functioned as very
useful demonstrational areas and were
visited as frequently as possible by the
field officers. However, with the coming
of World War I. and the subsequent loss
of field assistants, considerable difficulty
was experienced in maintaining the
fertility and cultivation experiments
attached to these plots. In 1916, there-
fore, it was decided to abandon this part
of the farm trial programme and retain
only the varietal testing and distribution
plots. These latter were of considerable
interest and usefulness to growers in the
various centres and were the forerunners
of the comprehensive series of varietal
trials and propagation plots which are
maintained in practically all sugar areas
at the present time. Moreover, since the
Bureau now had its recently acquired
experimental station at Bundaberg in
addition to the Mackay Station, it was
felt that the intricacies of quantitative
fertilizer and cultivation trials could be
more efficiently catered for if set out on
these properties under the full control of
Bureau staff.
GRADUAL IMPROVEMENT IN DESIGN
OF FIELD TRIALS,
As has been already mentioned, all
trials in the early years were of a very
simple form, in which a single plot only,
of each treatment, was used. Under these
circumstances what appeared to be a
clear-cut result was nearly always
obtained. The treatment given to the
plot which produced the highest yields
was considered to be the best. Although
the possibility of the existence of soil
heterogeneity and fertility gradients was
undoubtedly recognised, the experimental
staff unfortunately had no effective
counter, except to insist that an absolutely

uniform piece of land be selected as the
site of the experiment. However, the
records do not indicate how the conclusion
that the land was uniform was arrived at.
Of coui’se, in the first stages, when trials
comparing the use of fertilizer with no
fertilizer on soils which had been culti-
vated for many years without the addition
of N. P. or K. were carried out, the
results of the fertilizer applications were
so marked that thex-e was actually little
necessity for replicated experiments.
However as time went on and attempts
were made to define soil requirements
more closely, it soon became evident that
something was wrong with investigational
methods. The fertilizer trial already
referred to on Mackay Station which was
apparently unwittingly put down in
duplicate was the first which indicated
that there was room for improvement in
experimental technique.
It is of interest to note that in 1914
tlrree trials were set out on Bundaberg
Station to test the value of liming and
subsoiling, with and without manure.
Each trial consisted of two treatments
and was put down in duplicate. It must
have been a matter of some satisfaction
that, when the results were obtained, it
w r as possible to report that the duplicate
plots agreed exactly. The Bureau felt
reasonably secure in making the recom-
mendation that subsoiling and liming was
not a payable proposition on the red
volcanic Woongarra soils. However
those concerned were quick to appreciate
the vagaries of climatic conditions, and
the proviso was added that it would be
advisable to again test these treatments
when the soils were less influenced by
dry weather. Incidentally, these trials
have been repeated in many different
foxms over the years and no’ response to
liming or subsoiling has ever been
achieved on Bundaberg Station.
After this, although the various treat-
ments frequently occurred as single plots
it became a fairly general practice to put
down the check or “no treatment” plots
in duplicate. In 1919, the first manurial
trial which was planted out on the new
station at South Johnstone consisted of
seven treatments in single plots. These
were laid down side by side with a check
plot separating each treatment. The
results obtained from the seven check
plots provided food for thought. Not
only were they all different but the yields
increased as the sites receded from the
side of the hill (Basilisk) at the foot of
which the experimental area occurred.
Here, then, was a typical fertility
gradient, and it is pleasing to note that
its pi’esence was immediately recognised.
In order to assess the results of each
fertilizer treatment it was decided to com-
pare the yields with the mean of the two
check plots which were located on either
side. This was done until the experiment
concluded with the harvesting of the
third ratoon crop in 1923. By this time
however it was a frequent occurrence for

trials to be laid down in triplicate,
although there was as yet no attempt at
randomisation or to use the standard
methods of technique which were
beginning to be used in other parts of
the world. However, it must be remem-
bered that it was not until Fisher had
established the Statistical Laboratory at
Rothamsted in 1919 that the principles
of randomisation were propounded and
the analysis of variance devised.
Nevertheless, the Bureau was making
determined efforts to ensure the validity
of its trial results, and in the Annual
Report for 1926 attention was drawn to
the conclusion of experiments for testing
the uniformity of the soil. This referred
to work on Bundaberg Station, where
the yields from four unfertilised plots
were compared with those of four plots
which had been uniformly fertilized. The
Director in summing up the results stated
that “the disparity in results between
contiguous plots shows the necessity for
carrying out experiments in duplicate.”
It was not long after this that the
Bureau completely reorganised its experi-
mental methods. The return from over-
seas of the graduate scholarship holder
in Soils (Dr. Kerr)) provided the
necessary impetus. The newly formed
Division of Soils and Agriculture under
his direction in 1929 immediately planned
a scheme of farm experimentation
designed to test the fertilizer require-
ments of the widely varying soil types
that occurred throughout the sugar areas.
The experimental plan was generally a
5x5 Latin Square together with some
randomised block trials in which liming
was combined with fertiliser tests. In
this year it is recorded that 46 farms
with soil types of major importance were
selected and fertility trials set out in
order to obtain “information regarding’
response to plant food constituents, singly
and in combination.” The current trials
on the experiment station were allowed
to run their course, but as these reached
finality they were replaced by others

designed on sounder field experimenta-
tion principles. Varietal trials also were
laid down as Latin Squares or fully
randomised blocks and this made better
provision for the final testing of new
canes against the older varieties, as far as
yields and sugar per acre were concerned.
The large number of fertilizer trials
was built up around a uniform type of
tidal as far as possible. The treatments
were C (check), X., N.P., N.K. and
X.P.K. Field assistants rapidly became
familiar with this standarised type of
trial, and this was a factor which was
not unimportant insofar as the laying
out of a very large number was con-
cerned. However, about 1930 this was
replaced by the factorial layout (3 x 3 x
3) in which three levels of N.P. and K.
were used. Such trials have been
retained until the present day and proved
extremely useful for the routine testing
of fertilizer requirements, particularly
in conjunction with soil surveys. Today
the Department of Agriculture and Stock
maintains a very efficient Biometrics
Section, the services of which are freely
available to the Bureau. The designs
of all quantitative trials are submitted
to this section before the experiment is
laid down, and when the results are to
hand the complete trial data is again
passed to the biometrician for analysis.
SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF THE MANY
CULTIVATION AND FERTILIZER TRIALS.
It is of course impossible to enumerate
here the many and varied trials that have
been carried out over the fifty years
under review. For many years and
indeed up to quite recent times the value
of subsoiling was investigated in trials of
various forms. In general the results
have indicated that deep loosening of the
soil below normal plough depth is worth-
while, particularly on the heavier alluvials
and on soils with clayey subsoils. Xo
beneficial results were ever obtained on
red volcanic loams, and after a series of
very useful trials on Bundaberg Station,
the statement was made in 1938 that “it
must be concluded that the value of culti-
vation operations on red volcanic soils—
beyond that of weed control —is nil.”
A Queensland cutter-planter.
Methods of ratooning have also received
considerable attention. As early as 1910
at Mackay a trial was laid down to decide
which was the best practice for ratoon
cane. The treatments were briefly as
follows; —
(a) Volunteering with trash left on
ground.
(b) Burying trash in interspace.
(e) Relieving, trash placed in alter-
nate interrows, cleared rows
ploughed and subsoiled.
(d) Trash burnt, interrow ploughed
and subsoiled.
However dry weather interfered and
the experiment was repeated in 1912, the
second ratoon crop of the trial being
harvested in 1915. In the first ratoon
crop the best results were obtained from
the plot in which the trash had been burnt
and the interspace subsoiled. However
the results were almost completely
reversed in the second ratoons in which
the highest yields of sugar and cane per
acre were obtained from the volunteered
plots. The experimenters were possibly
somewhat nonplussed and ratooning
experiments remained tabu until 1919,
when a somewhat similar trial was laid
down on South Johnstone Station. This
was considered to be much more success-


ful in that both first and second ratoon
crops consistently indicated the benefits
of burning trash and deep cultivating
between each row. Amongst other ratoon-
ing trials mention is made of one carried
out at Mackay in 1930. In this case
each treatment was replicated five times.
The treatments were —
( a ) Three furrows ploughed 6 in.
deep and worked level with
harrows.
( b ) Ratooned with spring toothed
harrows.
The results show that no differences
due to treatment occurred.
In assessing the value of all these
cultivation and ratooning trials it is clear
that considerable difficulty was encoun-
tered in obtaining results to prove that
any particular method was superior to
all others. It is equally clear that the
Bureau fully recognised that this was due
to the influence of prevailing weather
conditions and varietal and soil charac-
teristics. Undoubtedly a great deal was
learnt that was of tremendous importance
to the advisory and extension work, and
it was repeatedly stressed that good farm
management went hand in hand with an
appreciation of the particular conditions
under which the crop was being grown.
On reading through the results of the
experimental work one cannot help being
impressed with the fact that the Bureau
staff throughout the years possessed the
fundamental outlook of the practical
farmer, around which they built up added
knowledge by means of the scientific tools
which they used to the best possible
advantage.
Little need be said of the many plant
and row spacing trials, the results of
which are reflected in the methods in
general use at the present day. In these
trials due cognisance was taken of varietal
requirements and district conditions as
Avas also done with trials to compare early
and late planting.
Undoubtedly the most successful trials,
exclusive of those associated with the
cane breeding programme, were those
Avhose purpose was to indicate the correct
usage of fertilizers. The earliest experi-
ments revealed the outstanding need for
replenishing the plant food content of
practically all soils of the sugar areas,
whilst the latter trials aimed at showing
the most efficient and economical way of
doing so. The marked refinement in
technique about 1929 by the adoption of
the statistical method has already been
mentioned. From this time onward there
is no gainsaying the fact that the fertiliz-
ing methods used in the industry have
been put on a sound and very satisfactory
basis.

TRIALS WITH MOLASSES AND MILL
MUDS.
Over the years a number of trials
designed to compare the fertilizer value
of mill by-products such as molasses and
mill muds have been set out. Replicated
experiments with molasses ran for some
time on South Johnstone, Mackay and
Bundaberg Experiment Stations. In all
three eases the value of molasses as a
direct supplier of plant foods was
demonstrated. Some interesting differences
were observed at the various stations, for
instance on the red volcanic soils at
Bundaberg there was little difference in
the increased yields due to molasses as
compared with those brought about by the
application of equivalent amounts of
X.P. and K. as fertilizer. Apparently,
on this highly ferruginous soil which has
maintained its excellent physical condi-
tion in spite of continuous cultivation,
molasses was beneficial only because of
its plant nutrient content. At South
Johnstone, the consistently better per-


formance of molasses in comparison with
fertilizer led to a remark in the 1934
Annual Report stressing - “the value of
molasses as a most suitable material for
rejuvenating old lands.” During recent
years a series of laboratory studies have
indicated the value of molasses in increas-
ing the percentage of water stable
aggregates of many sugar soils.
The results of trials to provide evidence
as to the value of mill muds have been
less convincing. It has not yet been
possible to show that this material has
any value beyond its actual plant nutrient
content. In addition, because of its
rather low and unbalanced proportion of
X.P. and K. it would appear that any
yield increases due to its application can
often be more efficiently and economically
reproduced by suitable mixed fertilizers.
SOME INTERESTING " PERMANENT "
TRIALS.
In 1934 a trial to investigate the value
of conserving trash was commenced on
the red volcanic soil at Bundaberg
Station. On the trash plots all cane is
cut green, the trash and tops are con-
served and eventually ploughed in after
the second ratoon crop. On the no trash
plots all plant residues are burnt. This
trial has been maintained continuously
and is now in its fifth cycle, each cycle
consisting normally of a plant and two
ratoon crops. It is interesting to note
that to date no increase in crop yields
have been obtained due to the conserva-
tion of the trash. There is no apparent
difference in the soil due to treatment
and repeated analyses have failed to
detect any increase in the carbon content
of the soils of the plots receiving trash.
It may be pointed out that the physical
condition of this red basaltic loam is
excellent and no deterioration has
occurred due to continuous cultivation.
On the same station two other long
term trials are established. One was
designed to investigate the effect of long
(18 months) and short (6 months) fallow
periods in conjunction with green manur-
ing while the other was set out to further

examine the effect of trash conservation,
with and without green manuring. These
trials have been carried on since 1938,
and no difference due to the various treat-
ments have yet been indicated. It would
appear that this stable-structured red soil
maintains its natural good physical condi-
tion ii’respective of management, a fact
which was foreshadowed by the very
early subsoiling and cultivation trials
laid down soon after the opening of the
Bundaberg Station.

A WIDE OUTLOOK,
Enough has been said in the foregoing
pages to exemplify the wide outlook
adopted by the Bureau since its incep-
tion, as far as all aspects of farm
management practices are concerned.
Poona Pea Crop, Bundaberg Sugar Experiment
Station.
However, there are many facets of the
half-century of experimental work to
which only passing reference can be
made. For instance, it is interesting to
note that the first trials for the control
of weeds by the use of various chemicals
(mainly arsenic) were laid down as early
as 1915. Although the results were
encouraging the costs were prohibitive.
This type of work lapsed until very
recent years, and at the present time an
intensive series of trials with hormone
weed killers and oil emulsions is in
progress.
When cane planting equipment began
to replace hand planting, a trial was
established to compare the results obtained
with this new method and those given by
the old. This was carried through into
the second ratoon crop just in case
ratooning was also unfavourably affected.
Specially imported stubble shavers and
mole drainers were also tried out under
varying conditions. At the beginning of
the century the Bureau showed a keen
interest in mechanical harvesters, and this
has been maintained throughout the
years. Literally dozens of new types of
Australian inventions have received
attention, and there are very few overseas
machines which Bureau officers have not
inspected and reported upon. In recent
years the Director is represented on a
Committee set up by the industry and
the Commonwealth Government for the
express purpose of encouraging l and
assisting - the development of harvesting*
and loading machinery. The working of
this Committee has been particularly
useful, since its inauguration coincided
with the development of several success-
ful harvesters which are at present in
commercial use.
The matter of soil erosion in sugar
areas has been a vexed one for many
years. At first sight it may seem strange
that more trouble is encountered in this
respect in the southern areas of lower
rainfall than in the wet belt of the far
North. However, experience has shown
that to cultivate topographically unsuit-
able land in the 100-180 inch rainfall
districts is suicidal. Erosion control is
impracticable and uneconomic and there-
fore sugar growing has naturally
restricted itself to flat areas, whereas in
the south, cane has encroached on hill-
side slopes which would not have been
brought into cultivation under the much
more obvious erosion potential existing*
in North Queensland.
Over the years the advisory and exten-
sion services of the Bureau have stressed
the desirability of top soil conservation
and much specific advice has been given
to growers in this report. It is only
recently however that more active steps
have been taken to combat this problem.

WORK OF THE LABORATORIES.
From the commencement of the
laboratory Avork in 1900, considerable
emphasis Avas placed on the value of soil
analyses and the laboratories at Bunda-
berg and Mackay were equipped to carry
out quantitative chemical Avork. A con-
siderable amount of painstaking work
Avas performed by the analysts stationed
at these centres, the object “being to
demonstrate in the first place the plant
food immediately available, the acid
soluble plant food which by process of
A\ r eathering, etc., is gradually becoming
aA r ailable, and finally the analyses of the
insoluble residue of the soils demonstrat-
ing the store of plant food locked up
in insoluble silicates, which may in course
of time, gradually be added to the acid
soluble plant foods.” This was indeed
a most comprehensive conception of
assessment of the fertility of the various
soils.
Initially one per cent, aspartic acid
Avas used as the extractant for available
plant foods. These values were at times
compared with those obtained by using
acetic, citric and hydrochloric acids of
the same concentration. In 1909 it was
stated that Maxwell’s aspartic acid
method was considered to be the most
useful, and the one which approximates
most closely in showing the amount of

premises upon which this assumption
was based appear to be available. In
this respect a table published by Patten
summarising the results of a large
number of analyses is of interest. This
is reproduced above.
HoAvever, by about 1914 the citric acid
method of determining available plant
food seems to have replaced the aspartic
acid analysis. For many years a large
number of analytical figures Avere
recorded Avhich Avere estimated by the so-
called “agricultural method.” This Avas

sugar soils was carried out by C. R. voa
Stieglitz in the laboratory of the Agricul-
tural Chemist in Brisbane, where H. W.
Kerr also carried out soil work prior to
his departure as a scholarship holder for
overseas training. The need for addi-
tional laboratory space was becoming a
pressing need, and in 1930 the oppor-
tunity arose with the additions to the
Agriculture and Stock building for the
Bureau to acquire its own Brisbane
laboratories. These were designed by the
staff not only to fulfil immediate require-
ments but also with an eye to future
expansion, and are in use at the present
time.
With the: return of Kerr, Bell and
Bennett from overseas, new ideas coin-
cided with the new facilities, and the
Bureau was off to a fresh start. It is
to the credit of the then Director, H. T.
Easterby, that he encouraged and used
to good advantage the new tools that he
had at his disposal. The old methods of
soil fertility assessment were suspended
and an intensive programme of labora-
tory research in conjunction Avith field
trials Avas instituted. The search began
for chemical methods Avhich Avould
indicate the plant food requirement of
the many and varied soil types of the
sugar areas. The opportunity for the
finally selected methods to prove them-
selves was provided by the large number
of quantitative N.P.K. field trials which

By 193 T it was possible to record that
“studies of the relationship between held
trials results and laboratory soil tests
have been completed.” These investiga-
tions were brought to a successful con-
clusion by Kerr and von Stieglitz, and
fertilizer advisory recommendations per
medium of soil analyses were placed on
a satisfactory and workable basis. The
methods are in constant use at the
present day and have repeatedly proved
their worth.
SOIL AND FERTILITY SURVEYS.
By 1930, the need was felt for the
carrying out of soil survey work to pro-
vide a closer link between field investiga-
tions and laboratory studies. Accordingly,
therefore, N. J. King, of the Agricul-
tural Chemist’s staff was seconded to
carry out a reconaissanee survey of the
major soil types in the more important
sugar districts. Subsequently this work
was extended and more detailed surveys
were made. The definition of the more
important types provided extremely use-
ful data and encouraged the training of
the various field advisory officers in the
recognition of soils in their districts.
This latter provided the facilities for
further work and to-day soil maps are
available in the Bureau records for most
of the sugar areas in so far as assigned
land is concerned. Although a consider-
able amount of information regarding
the characteristics of these soils has been
obtained and is used as a working basis
for many advisory and investigational
purposes, up to the present very little of
it has been published. However, the

The first soil fertility survey was com-
pleted in 1940 and although the work was
curtailed during World War 11., some
24 surveys have been completed to date.
This type of purvey was made possible by
the development of satisfactory labora-
tory methods for the determination of
phosphate, potash and lime requirement.
Briefly the method consists of sampling
certain blocks on each farm property in
the district selected for survey. The soil
samples are taken from plant cane blocks
at or about the period of maturity, of
the crop, the most convenient time being
just after harvesting. Wherever possible
a factorial fertilizer trial is set out in the
area concerned. The results have been
found to be of considerable value in pro-
viding a systematic evaluation of the
fertilizer requirements of the ara.
The soil and fertility survey work
showed up to advantage during the fer-
tilizer rationing imposed by shortages
during the recent war years. Not only
was it possible to allocate, with reason-
able accuracy, the correct type of fer-
tilizer for each particular farm but it was
practicable to determine the amounts
required to maintain efficient production.
OTHER IMPORTANT STUDIES.
With the opening of the new labora-
tories in 1930 in which von Stieglitz func-
tioned as Analyst and Cassidy as
Research Assistant, a large amount of
chemical investigation was begun. Sub-
sequently work was also carried out with
the co-operation of L. C. Home of the
Central Cane Prices Board, who was
ultimately transferred to the Bureau staff
in 1938. Reports on analytical methods
in factory control and the use of the
electrometric method for the determina-
tion of reducing sugars were published at
intervals by von Stieglitz and Home. In
addition investigations were carried out
on the estimation of fibre and the associ-
ated necessary sampling technique, as
well iis work on the composition and
clarifying properties of basic lead acetate.
Cassidy, working on the irrigation
waters of coastal Queensland and their
effects on various soils, adduced a con-
siderable amount of useful information in

this respect, particularly with regard to

properties. These studies were sub-
sequently published as Technical Com-
munications and also as contributions to
the Queensland Journal of Agricultural
Science.
In the present lines of investigation
emphasis is being placed upon the ques-
tion of deterioration of sugar soils which
have now been continuously cultivated to
cane for a large number of years. An
attempt is being made to determine the
effect of various organic materials high
in sugar, such as molasses and sorghum,
on soil physical condition, and measure-
ments made on the stability of structural
aggregates have already indicated the
beneficial effect of these materials. It is
considered that the encouragement of the

development of fungal mycelia is particu-
larly important in this respect. The rate
of decomposition of various materials
such as legume residues, molasses and
bagasse is also being studied.
Recent work has also shown that yield
responses due to the application of lime
are more closely linked with the calcium
status of the soil rather than with pH
values. This is possibly an indication
that, whereas in the past, the correction
of excessive soil acidity was an important
function of lime application, continuous
cropping and a high rate of leaching
under tropical and sub-tropical rainfall
conditions have now brought about a
marked decrease in calcium availability
as an essential plant food.
Acid soils react appreciably to liming. Lime was applied to the right hand side of this

A Review of Sugar Cane Entomological
Investigations.
By R. W. MUNGOMERY.
Mr. R. W. MUNGOMERY, O/C, Division of
Entomology and Pathology.
Although 1950 marks the fiftieth
anniversary of the establishment of the
Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations,
entomological investigations were not
incorporated in the original activities of
the Bureau and it was not until 1911
that the Division of Entomology first
came into being as an integral part of the
Bureau’s organisation. Consequently,
although the present year does not repre-
sent the fiftieth year since the forma-
tion of the Division of Entomology, it
does, however, constitute a convenient
time in the Division’s development to look
back over the various lines of investiga-
tion that have engaged the attention of
its entomologists from time to time, and
to assess what has been accomplished
in the interim.
That entomological and pathological
investigations were not commenced con-
currently with the establishment of the
Bureau of Sugar Experiment Stations
will be readily understood from the fact
that when W. Maxwell was appointed
first Director of the present organisation,
he was so forcibly impressed with the
extent to which soil deterioration
had apparently occurred that he
inclined strongly to the idea that
the ravages of pests and diseases were
closely linked with this decline in soil
fertility. After examining the occurrence
of white grubs and their attacks on cane
under different conditions he was led to
the following conclusion: “The examina-
tion leaves no doubt in the matter that
the continuous ratooning, for successive
years, and the dead condition and fouling
of the soil, which, after one or two crops
it involves, provides all the most favour-
able conditions for the propagation of
the grub and furnishes another powerful
reason for the introduction of a more
rational and thorough system of cultiva-
tion.” Later, while still on the subject
of diseases and pests he was prompted
to make the following remarks: “Quite
certainly, any remedial steps taken for
the rebuilding up of the producing power
of the soil, and of the vitality of the
cane, will also be actions begun for the
resistance and removal of pests and
diseases.” Hence the emphasis during
Maxwell’s regime was on experimental
work designed to restore soil fer-
tility and thus indirectly to affect the
different pests, rather than on any direct
investigations seeking to elucidate their
life histories and habits or to evolve con-
trol measures against those which were
then known to be responsible for such
huge annual losses. There can be no
doubt that the status of the various cane
pests was at that time fairly well under-
stood, for it was on record that white
grubs had been responsible for killing
cane in the Mackay area as early as the
1870’s, and in subsequent years damage
had been recorded in the Ingham, Innis-
fail and Cairns districts. Other parts of


the colony had also demanded attention
against a number of pests which were
causing trouble in localised areas, but
there was probably nothing that caused
more general anxiety amongst Queens-
land sugar growers than the annual threat
from grubs—the immature forms of
various cockchafer beetles. Right through-
out the entire period that was later to be
occupied by entomological investigations
attention was focussed mainly on these
pests.
In 1891 Keobele had visited Australia
from Hawaii and reported that the moth
borer pest differed from the destructive
species found in the West Indies,
Mauritius and elsewhere, whilst Olliff,
Government entomologist of New South
Wales, had surveyed sugar cane pests in
that colony. Probably the first authorita-
tive work on sugar cane entomology in
Queensland was written and presented by
Turner at an agricultural conference held
in Mackay in 1892. Turner —an entomo-
logist and eanegrower in the Mackay
district—detailed the identity of various
pests which were responsible for losses
in the industry, and he issued a note of
warning regarding the possible introduc-
tion of others whose establishment in
Queensland might be attended with more
serious results. Later Tryon, Queens-
land Government entomologist, paid some
attention to the greyback beetle and, inter
alia, suggested soil fumigation and collec-
tion of grubs and beetles as likely to
afford substantial relief. The latter
measure was the only one that seemed to
have been extensively adopted then, but
it subsequently proved of little value.
This briefly summarises what was
known up to that time regarding Queens-
land cane pests, and the extent of the
control measures that had been put into
operation when Maxwell took up duties
in Queensland. In the few years prior
to his arrival there had certainly been
no improvement in the general position
and he either had complete confidence that
the rehabilitation of the depleted soils
would prove an effective answer to the
various pests, or else the problem was
entirely ignored, for no further investiga-
tions on these pests were carried out
•during the next decade. During that

period there was still no abatement of
the damage and leading members of the
industry became determined that the posi-
tion should not remain static. Their
demands that further attention should be
given to the grub pest crystallised the
action which led to the appointment, in
1911, of A. A. Girault as first entomolo-
gist, and to the formation of the Divi-
sion of Entomology. At the request of
the Queensland Government Girault had
been specially selected by the American
Secretary for Agriculture to fill this posi-
tion, and his arrival in Queensland was
hailed with considerable satisfaction.
Girault, however, realised that a consider-
able amount of basic investigation was
necessary and accordingly he promised
no spectacular results. Instead he under-
took a vast amount of breeding work at
Gordonvale in an effort to relate various
grubs to the adult beetles, as well as to
ascertain the duration of their life cycles,
their habits and their relative economic
importance. Soon after commencing this
work he was joined by A. P. Dodd, and
these two entomologists were conjointly
responsible for the detailed technical data
that later was published in their
entomological bulletin, “The Cane Grubs
of Australia.”
Following the termination of Girault’s
engagement in 1914 he decided to return
to America, and while steps were being
taken to secure a successor, E. Jarvis, who
had been associated with Tryon, in Bris-
bane, on entomological investigations,
took over duties from Girault. Sub-
sequently J. E. Illingworth was appointed

entomologist in June, 1917. Before com-
ing to Australia Illingworth had been
connected with the College of Hawaii as
Professor of Entomology and he had also
carried out special investigations for the
Colonial Sugar Refining Company in Fiji.
On assuming control of entomological
investigations here he immediately
expanded held experiments and later he
collated much of the information that he
and previous workers had gathered
together. His comprehensive publica-
tion, “Australian Sugar Cane Beetles
and their Allies” is one of the finest
treatises on this subject, and his other
works were of an equally high standard.
Illingworth left in 1921 and Jarvis again
took over control. Jarvis completed some
of the investigations commenced by his
predecessor and in addition carried out
an extensive survey of the lesser known
sugar cane pests. He possessed no mean
ability as a delineator and one of his
bulletins, “Notes on Insects Damaging
Cane in Queensland,” which was well
illustrated by drawings and photographs,
served as a means of identifying most
insect pests associated with cane in
Queensland. His monthly notes on cane
pests were prominent for a number of
years in several of the publications that
circulated throughout the industry.
New acquisitions to the entomological
staff in the next few years included W.
Cottrell-Dormer and G. Bates. The
former turned his attention to sugar cane
pathology in 1924 and the latter to sugar
cane agriculture in 1930.
The expansion in entomological activi-
ties in the later 1920’s was in keeping
with the general extension of scientific
research throughout the Queensland sugar
industry, and because of the awakened
interest in entomological problems follow-
ing upsurges of pest activity in parts
of southern and central Queensland,
R. W. Mun gomery was appointed to the
staff in 1925. After a short period at
Meringa he subsequently took up duties
at Bundaherg, where he studied southern
cane pests —chiefly white grubs. Later
he also collaborated with A. F. Bell in
research on the transmission of various
diseases by insect vectors, and these
workers were eventually successful in
proving that Fiji disease was spread by
means of the sugar cane leaf hopper.
In 1927 J. H. Buzacott joined the staff
at Meringa and in the following year
W. A. McDougall received a similar
appointment. Subsequently, in 1931,
MciDougall took over duties at Mackay
from A. N. Burns, who had commenced
there some three years previously.
Because the wireworm pest had been par-
ticularly troublesome there for a number
of years McDougall devoted the greater
part of his time to a study of this pest.
His subsequent recommendations regard-
ing efficient drainage went a long way
towards lessening the losses caused by
wireworms and in more recent years,
when benzene hexachloride came on the
market, he worked out a satisfactory tech-
nique for preventing damage. In 1936
he commenced work on the rat problem
in Queensland canefields, and his
researches in connection with this pest
earned for him world-wide recognition.
In 1949 he was transferred to the Depart-
ment of Agriculture as Senior
Entomologist.
In order that the Divisions of Entomo-
logy and Pathology might function more
efficiently they were fused under the
control of A. F. Bell in 1934. This led


to considerable staff reorganization and
as a result Mungomery and Buzacott were
assigned further work on the borer and
grub problems, while McDougall later
concentrated on rat control. Bell was
responsible for calling the first confer-
ence of Cane Pest Boards in 1935 and
this was the forerunner of the annual
conferences of Cane Pest and Disease
Control Boards which have done much to
bring extension work up to date, and to
improve the efficiency and economy of
cane pest and disease control methods.
Buzacott worked on rind hardness as
a factor in borer prevention and tested
many of the newer insecticides against
white grubs. In this connection he carried
out most of the earlier tests with benzene
hexachloride in 1945, when Mungomery
was appointed to take charge of the Divi-
sion, and the successful control of the
greyback grub pest by means of this
chemical has been brought about largely
as a result of his initiative. In 1947
Buzacott transferred his activities to a
study of sugar cane genetics, when he was
appointed Senior Plant Breeder of this
Bureau, and in 1948 G. Wilson was
appointed in his stead to continue work
on some of the white grubs which had not
yielded so readily to treatment with
benzene hexachloride.
In reviewing the work that has been
accomplished over the years it is
apparent that results were not always
quickly forthcoming but nevertheless pro-
gress was sure, and with the means now
readily available for controlling most of
the major pests, newcomers to the indus-
try need never fear the catastrophic

losses from pest attack which often con-
fronted the earlier pioneers. Problems
still exist and no doubt with changing
systems additional problems will obtrude
themselves from time to time, but with
an organisation built up to meet such
emergencies these problems should not
prove incapable of ultimate solution.
Details in connection with control work
in some of the more important pests are
given hereunder: —
THE WHITE GRUB PEST.
Right from the earliest, following the
expansion of the sugar industry in
Queensland, reports featured very promi-
nently the difficulties that various
growers encountered in producing crops
because of the activities of various white
grub pests. With an incomplete know-
ledge of the different species that were
responsible for this damage it was inevit-
able that considerable confusion should
arise regarding their habits and life
histories. However, it eventually
became well established that the greyback
grub, with a life cycle of one year, was
the worst offender and that its distribu-
tion ranged from central Queensland to
the extreme north. Tn the same area there
were several other grubs whose period of
development differed substantially, whilst
other cane areas in the south were
troubled by similar pests capable of
causing heavy but localised damage.
Economic entomology had not advanced
far in those early days when grub damage
first became noticeable, and it seemed
natural that growers should look for


relief by instituting a system of beetle
and grub collecting. It was assumed that
every grub or beetle caught and destroyed
meant a reduction in the pest, and various
Divisional Boards (or what we now term
City or Shire Councils) were empowered
to impose a levy on certain properties in
order to finance the payment of a bonus
for the beetles or grubs so collected. It
can scarcely be claimed that such collect-
ing was responsible for any diminution of
the pest and from the outset Turner was
one of the first to doubt its value. Later
entomologists brought statistical evidence
to discredit this method, and they con-
demned the system as contributing very
little towards control. In view of this it
is a matter for some surprise to realise
that this system persisted with some Cane
Pest and Disease Control Boards until
comparatively recent years.
Girault realised that very little could be
accomplished in the way of control until
a complete knowledge of the life histories
and habits of the pests was obtained. He
concentrated on securing this informa-
tion and devoted very little of his time to
exploiting control measures. Illingworth
saw the need for more extensive field
experiments and he laid out several series
of plots in the Meringa and Greenhill
areas. He was of the opinion that much
of the damage could be obviated by stimu-
lating vigour in the plant so he attempted
to increase the humus content of the soil
and at the same time investigated the
influence of artificial fertilizers. None
of these was successful. lie also had
great confidence in the value of white
arsenic applied in the cane drills, but
although this gave some noticeable relief
when relatively few grubs were present,
even appreciable amounts of this chemical
proved an utter failure when large infes-
tations were involved. Jarvis also tried
the effect of dusting Paris Green on the
foliage of cowpeas and turning this crop
under when young grubs or eggs were
present in the soil. However, it proved
impracticable to perform this work or
any other fonn of deep cultivation in the
young cane. The use of repellents and
attractants was also investigated, but
this line of attack yielded nothing of any
value. This was not surprising in view of
French! grub damage at Figtree Creek.
the extensive range of food plants utilized
by the greyback beetle. The destruction
of feeding trees was also attempted, but
because of the inaccessibility of these
trees on many of the nearby mountains
and the fairly extensive flight range of
the pest this plan never achieved its
objective anywhere except perhaps in
parts of the flat Burdekin area where in
in recent years it has been used as a
means of restricting the pest to the outer
limits of some mill areas.
The value of late planting as a means
of obviating grub attack was recognised
by some of the earliest workers, while the
use of resistant varieties capable of
regenerating their root systems was fully
exploited by succeeding entomologists as
new varieties came to hand for testing.
Mungomery investigated three harmful
species of white grubs in South Queens-
land and condemned lengthy ratooning
practices. He recommended soil pre-
paration during the summer months and
developed the use of the high-speed rotary
hoe for seed-bed preparation as the least

costly means of keeping these pests
depressed at reasonably low population
levels throughout the complete crop
cycle.
Although various references to the
possibility of satisfactory biological
control were made by different entomo-
logists, they apparently held out little
hope of success in that direction because
of the large number of native parasites
and the equally imposing array of hyper-
parasites. Attempts, however, were made
by Jarvis, on different occasions, to
introduce wasp parasites from Java, but
these introductions progressed little
beyond the initial stages. In 1935 the
giant American toad was introduced for
the purpose of assisting in the control
of various cane beetles, but in none of
the areas in which it was liberated in
Queensland did it achieve the same suc-
cesses as were claimed for it from other
sugar producing countries.
Soil fumigation with carbon bisulphide
was attempted in the early 1900’s before
any entomologist had been assigned
exclusively to the investigation of sugar
cane pests. Results were erratic and this
control measure was not popular. This
is not surprising in view of the fact that
the injectors were the cause of frequent
trouble and constant attention or super-
vision was necessary to bring about
worthwhile results. Jarvis experimented
with paradichlorobenzene for some years
and later, Freeman, of the Colonial Sugar
Refining Company, used a mixture of
this and carbon bisulphide with consider-
able success on Greenhill plantation. As
a result soil fumigation received a great
fillip and this practice was extended
further with the formation of Cane Pest
and Disease Control Boards in several
of the larger mill areas in North Queens-
land. Well organised campaigns were
undertaken annually, but in no season did
the area treated exceed 2,000 acres, even
though in many, instances it was the only
effective means of guaranteeing a crop
fit for harvesting.
Grub damage therefore continued to
fluctuate in accordance with seasonal
conditions. In the meantime Mungomery

substitute for carbon bisulphide, explored
the action of various ucav insecticides as
they became available. One of the
chemicals tested in this way during 1945
was gamma benzene hexachloride, and it
immediately gave most spectacular and
promising results against greyback grubs.
Later experiments confirmed its value as
a dependable grub destroyer. In more
recent years Wilson continued research
with this insecticide and it was sub-
sequently determined that this chemical
was able to persist for some years in the
soil at a sufficiently high rate of concen-
tration to kill grubs. Present day control
measures, therefore, aim at applying suf-
ficient of this insecticide in the drills after
the young plant cane has germinated, to
ensure protection over the normal cycle
of three crops, and 150 lb. of 10 per
cent, dust per acre fulfils this require-
ment.
This insecticide A\ r on instant appeal
amongst cane growers because of its
efficacy, its ease of application and its low
treatment costs. Results secured on a
commercial basis since 1947 ha\ T e been
truly remarkable, and as a consequence
over 20,000 acres were treated last season.
Doubtless larger areas will be treated in
future years and losses will become pro-
gressively less. One thing, however, is
certain and that is growers now have at
hand a potent weapon whereby the grey-
back grub pest can be effectively con-
trolled. Although the road to success AA 7 as
comparatively long, its ultimate attain-
ment was none the less gratifying and not
the least cause for this satisfaction is the
knoAvledge that the savings effected by
last season’s B.H.C. treatments will alone
amount to many times the money
expended on all sugar cane entomological
investigations in Queensland since their
inception in 1911.
THE BORER PEST.
It is unfortunate that greater heed
was not taken of some of the earlier
warnings regarding the presence in New
Guinea of a number of borer and other
sugar cane pests whose accidental intro-
duction into Queensland could be followed
by disastrous consequences. In fact the
beetle or weevil borer pest was already
known to cause serious damage to cane
in other sugar-producing countries, yet
despite this knowledge large scale impor-
tations of borer-infested cane found their
way at various times into New South
Wales and southern Queensland. Fortu-
nately, however, the imported material
was usually in such bad shape and the
borer damage so conspicuous that the
canes were destroyed. The same
elementary precautions were not long
maintained, for it appears that later
importations from New Guinea in the
1890’s were responsible for the establish-
ment of the borer pest at both Cairns and
Mackay. Even after its establishment at
these points little attempt seems to have
been made to restrict its spread, and with
the distribution and interchange of
varieties it finally became established in
most of the soft, succulent, noble canes.

stage that it was considered as being
second in economic importance to the
greyback beetle.
Moir, an eminent entomologist who had
carried out investigations on this pest on
behalf of the Hawaiian Sugar Planters’
Association, had succeeded in locating a
Tachinid fly parasite of the same borer
in New Guinea and on some of the
adjacent islands. Intent on establishing
the fly in Hawaii he realised that it would
scarcely be practicable at that time to
introduce the fly direct from New Guinea,
so he used one of the borer-infested areas
of Queensland as an intermediate breed-
ing station. This was at Mossman, and
there, in 1910, at the request of the
Queensland Government, he liberated a
number of his surplus flies. This resulted
in the establishment of the Tachinid fly
in Queensland.
Some attempts were made to reduce
the borer pest by trapping and baiting,
but results were not encouraging, and
following the success of biological control
in Hawaii it was only natural that efforts
should be made to utilize the fly parasite
more extensively in Queensland. Thus
Illingworth introduced it into Babinda
and other centres, whilst Jarvis later
established fly breeding cages at Meringa
and flies were liberated in all areas
where borers were known to be present.
Special small areas of borer-infested
standover cane were left from time to
time to act as sanctuaries, but in most
instances the increase of the fly was slow
and erratic, and the degree of control
achieved never reached expectations.
This line of research was further inves-
tigated by Mungomory and Buzacott but
they quickly came to the conclusion that
the problem was in no way comparable
with that in Hawaii insofar that the
system of cropping in north Queensland
was entirely different. This local system
of cropping affected the host-parasite
relationship and presented an insuperable
difficulty, for whereas with the harvesting
of the 24-months-old crops in Hawaii the
fly was still able to find an ample supply
of borer larvae in the 12-months-old crops
and to maintain itself at a high popula-
tion level, the reverse was the ease in
north Queensland. There, with the
harvesting of twelve-fourteen months
crops, little or no cane was left above
ground after completion of crushing
operations and the flies were unable to
locate and parasitise any borer larvae.
Hence each year the fly populations were
decimated, whilst adult borers and their
larvae in the underground portion of the
stool were free to initiate fresh infesta-
tions. Thus it was abundantly clear that
the north Queensland system of harvest-
ing loaded the odds greatly against the
fly, and favoured the pest, so attempts
to improve biological control by means of
this fly parasite were quickly abandoned.
Instead, investigations were then con-
centrated on determining the conditions
which led to the heavy infestations
periodically encountered, and these
revealed that the unsatisfactory disposal
of crop residues was largely responsible
for this adverse state of affairs. In addi-
tion it became apparent that the high
incidence of top-rot greatly favoured
borer increase. Coupled with the use of
hard-rinded varieties to mitigate the evil,

a system of field sanitation and pre-
harvest burning was recommended,
and while this campaign was being insti-
tuted World War IT. broke out. The
resulting labour shortage made it impera-
tive to burn all crops prior to harvest and

burning had an immediate and profound
effect on the borer pest, and its numbers
were so reduced that in many fields it is
now difficult to find a single specimen.
This state of affairs has been maintained
over almost a decade, and it can be con-
fidently asserted that this borer, which
hitherto was of primary importance, has
now been relegated to the position of a
minor pest.
THE WIREWORM PEST.
For a number of years it was cus-
tomary for growers to ascribe any
damage to setts which prevented a normal
strike as being due to wireworms, and
since it is now known that a number of
pests and diseases are capable of caus-
ing plant failures, it seems inevitable that
there must have been much confusion in
some of the earlier references to wire-
worm injury. However vague these
earlier references may have been there
can be no doubt but that wireworms did
become pests of major importance in the
central distriicts in the 1920’s when large
areas of poorly drained clay-bottomed
soils were brought under cultivation fol-
lowing the expansion of the sugar
industry about that time. Accordingly,
in 1931, McDougall undertook the investi-
gation of the wireworrn pest at Mackay
where the scope for this work was not
limited in any way. He bred these pests
through their various stages and came to
the conclusion that one species chiefly
was involved, and that it had a life cycle
of one year. He investigated the use of
various chemicals and quick acting fer-
tilizers, hut without effect, and finally
recommended the permanent drainage of
low lying fields and the judicious selec-
tion of planting times. Later on, from
year to year, it was customary to issue
warnings to growers regarding the prob-
able intensity of wireworrn attack, but in
many cases these forecasts were ignored.
It was realised that something more posi-
tive in its action was needed against this
pest, and so, in 191(5, when supplies of
benzene hexaehloride became available,
opportunity was taken to test out this
new insecticide. Excellent results were
immediately secured and subsequently a
technique was evolved whereby 10 lb. of
20 per cent. B.H.C. was mixed with 3
cwt. of an appropriate fertilizer, and this
mixture, sufficient for one acre, was
applied in the drill with the setts at
planting time. In this way complete pro-
tection could be guaranteed at a cost of
14s. per acre for the insecticidal treat-
ment. So effective has control been in the
ensuing years that this treatment has
become routine practice in all the low-
lying areas of the central district and
several thousand acres are treated
annually. Thus another pest which defied
effective control for a number of years,
assumed an entirely different status.
THE RAT PEST.
Since 1910 rat damage in standing cane
has been recorded from time to time.
Infestations have been mostly scattered
and spasmodic, and until 1933 efforts to
combat the pest were local, empirical and
based on overseas experience. However,
a cause for wirespread alarm was an out-
break of Weil’s disease in some of the
northern cane districts during the rat
plague of 1933-34, and since the causal

organism of this disease is carried by rats,
this meant that the rat pest, in addition
to its damage to cane, had to be regarded
as a menace to the health of the cane
cutters and other field workers. This
prompted Gard, of the Colonial Sugar
Refining Company, to institute immedi-
ately an extensive poisoning campaign in
the Herbert River District, and the
Health Department required cane to be
burnt prior to harvesting. These actions
have since affected all northern mill areas
where rat control measures are now given
constant attention.
In 1935, McDougall was assigned the
task of investigating the rat problem in
canefields. Three native species, a bur-
rowing and two climbing rats, are mainly
responsible for damage to cane. The
ecology of two of these species has been
studied in detail, and a considerable mass
of information on the economics of the
rat problem, rat poisons, poisoning and
other methods of control is now available.
This is used by Pest Board officers in
formulating and carry out controls in the

who was then pathologist, interested him-
self in the transmission of both mosaic
and Fiji diseases of sugar cane, and as a
result of their researches they were able
to demonstrate that the sugar cane leaf-
hopper was the vector i-esponsible for the
spread of the latter disease.
Control measures, which have since
been applied with considerable success,
took cognisance of their findings in
respect of leafhopper incidence and the
period of the pest’s greatest increase,
whilst in other instances the liberation of
infective leafhoppers has been used as a
means of speeding up infection in field
trials established for the purpose of
determining the degree of susceptibility ox-

Insect transmission studies were also
undertaken in x-espect of dwarf and

positive nature has yet been obtained
from these experiments.

Sugar Cane Pathology and Disease Control
in Queensland.
By C. G. HUGHES.
Mr. C. G. HUGHES, Pathologist.
INTRODUCTION.
The recommendation of the Queensland
Secretary for Agriculture, in 1899, that
the services of a specialist be secured to
inspect and give advice upon the local
sugar industry did not mention the pos-
sible reasons why “the best results are
not obtained from the cane fields,” but
it is probable that losses due to disease
had had some influence in initiating the
step taken. In the press of the day
there were many references to poor yields
on once-fertile soils, and susceptibility to
diseases unspecified seemed to be a
feature of the failing crops. Apart from
these expressions of opinion it is known
definitely that during the nineties there
was a serious outbreak of gumming
disease in the Bundaberg district. Mr.
Henry Tryon —the same person who was
a little later to collect Badila from New
Guinea —was then Entomologist and
Vegetable Pathologist of the Department
cf Agriculture and was assigned to
investigate it. He visited the Wide Bay
and Burnett District during the crush-
ing in 1894 and reported losses over wide
areas; there is no doubt that the disease
was causing some concern. Another
disease, now realized to be red rot, was
at the same time causing losses in millable
cane in some of the northern districts,
particularly Mackay. There was no
general disease consciousness on the part
of the growers but there is no doubt that
loss due to disease was one of the impor-
tant obstacles to successful cane cultiva-
tion.
The specialist appointed, as mentioned
elsewhere, was Dr. Maxwell, of Hawaii,
who later became the first Director of
Sugar Experiment Stations. His report
includes a section, about one-tenth of the
whole, on pests and diseases and makes
several other references to diseases, but
his general attitude was that an
impoverished soil and a weak and
debilitated crop provided all the desider-
ata for the development of disease.
Despite the fact that Dr. Cobb, the
Pathologist to the New South Wales
Government, had recently found gumming
to be due to an organism, Dr. Maxwell
thought that the disease should be
attacked from the double standpoint of
the soil and the seed and he left no doubt
as to which he considered the most impor-
tant. The application of these principles
had an interesting result some years later
when he had established on the Mackay
Sugar Experiment Station a “hospital”
for cane varieties which were diseased.
They were planted in virgin soil, a little
apart from other cane and were to receive
the best possible conditions. The varieties
were from the Tryon collection of 1896
and other sources and, during growth
on the Station, had become so badly
infected with “apparent forms of disease
and debility” that it was impossible to


judge their agricultural worth. The
patients did not respond as expected, for
there was a good deal of gum in the
hospital plot in the plant crop; the first
ratoon was worse, and in the second
ratoons it was reported that the canes,
so far from recovering, had gone from
bad to worse. This experience was
unhappily repeated in commercial plant-
ings in many parts of Queensland before
the disease was brought under control by
modern resistant varieties.
EARLY DISEASE HISTORY.
There is mention of gumming disease
interfering with a Bureau cultivation-
cum-manurial trial on a farm in the
Herbert River district in 1902 and at the
same time a disease which was probably
downy mildew was causing some losses in
a variety known as Violet in the same
district. Trial and error substitution of
varieties appears to have exercised an
effective control over gumming disease
and it was not until 1920 that the disease
in commercial plantings led to a remark
in the Director’s Annual Report that
gumming was seen in many places on
the Herbert, notably in connection with
the variety known as Clark’s Seedling.
During the next few years increasing
losses due to gumming in various districts
led to a general increase in disease con-
sciousness, so that in the 1923-24 Bureau
Report there is the first appearance of
“Disease” in a sectional heading and, in
the same Report, an announcement of the
selection of a graduate of Queensland
University to go abroad to study “Plant
Pathology as applied to sugar cane.”
The graduate selected was A. F. Bell,
who spent some four years in study
abroad and returned to take charge of the
pathological work of the Bureau and
eventually became Director. In 1924, the
first comprehensive survey of disease and
cane pests in the different districts was
carried out by W. Cottrell-Dormer;
the survey was repeated in the following
two years. The results of the surveys are
of interest as representing the basic work
for the control of cane disease and also
for comparison with the position at
present, just 25 years later.
Typical Dwarf disease infection in P.O.J.2878
at Mackay.
In the far North a local infection of
gumming disease at Aloornba, in the Mul-
grave area, led to quarantine measures
and to a recommendation that resistant
varieties only be grown. This outbreak
did not spread at the time but apparently
was not eliminated because a decade later
it acted as a source of infection in the
widely grown, very susceptible 5.J.4. On
the Herbert, gumming was serious in
Clark's Seedling (H.Q.426) and the Goru
canes, but qontrol of plantings and the
elimination of susceptible varieties
brought the disease under control and
except for some infection on the Ingham
Line in the late thirties, it has not been
seen in the district since. There was some
gumming disease at Mackay at this time;
for instance it interfered with a varietal
trial on the Experiment Station by badly
affecting H.Q.285 and E.K.28, but the
disease reached its peak in the more
southerly districts, where the susceptible
D. 1135 had become such an important
cane. Losses were district-wide at Bunda-
berg, in the Isis and at Moreton, where a
farmers’ meeting was held to discuss it
and to establish a source of clean plants
as a control measure.
Leaf-scald disease had reached epidemic
proportions in North Queensland where
Badila was obviously less susceptible than
H.Q.426, Pompey or the Gorus; it was


also recorded for the first time on the
Maroochy River. Top rot was noticeable
from the Burdekin north and occurred in
small amounts elsewhere. Red rot was
serious in the Mackay district, particu-
larly in M. 19005. and M. 189. Mosaic was
widespread in South Queensland and
there were isolated occurrences in the
North. Downy mildew, which was then
generally called “leaf stripe,” occurred in
a number of centres and Cottrell-Dormer,
in 192-1, remarked prophetically that this
disease promised to be one of the most
difficult to control without the loss of
valuable varieties. It occurred at Moss-
man in nearly every field of 8.147; it was
damaging Pompey in the Hambledon
area, was present in the wetter Babinda-
Tully area and was to be found in most
fields of 8.208 on the Burdekin. At
Mackay and Proserpine it was showing
in P.0.J.2714 and several other varieties
and in the Bundaberg district occurred in
the Woongarra and at Bingera.
FIRST RECORD OF FIJI DISEASE IN
QUEENSLAND.
At the beginning of 1926 Fiji disease
was recorded by N. L. Kelly as being
present at Maryborough and Beenleigh.
It had apparently come from New South
Wales in importations of cane made by
farmers, but the extent of the outbreaks
and conversations with farmers led to the
conclusion that the disease may have been
present for several years before it was
found by a pathologist.
In 1927, some suggestions for the
control of cane diseases which were later
to form the basis of the legislative con-
trol work in Queensland, were put for-
ward by E. J. Ferguson Wood. He
suggested that the cane-growing areas of
the State should be divided into a number
of quarantine districts, that there should
be a practical field man stationed at each
mill to supervise planting material, dis-
tribution of varieties and eradication of
disease, that there should be established
variety plots under proper supervision at
each centre and that oidy a few proved
varieties should be permitted to be grown
in each district and the rest prohibited,
unless special permission were obtained.

BEGINNING OF PATHOLOGY DIVISION.
In 1928, A. F. Bell returned from over-
seas and was appointed to control the
newly constituted Division of Pathology.
The first report of the Division showed
that Fiji disease had spread to Bundaberg
and Moreton and that lists of disease-
free farms at Beenleigh and Mary-
borough had been published in order
that farmers might purchase plants from
reasonably safe sources. Similar steps
were initiated at Farleigh, near Mackay,
for mosaic disease, and at Bundaberg
and Nambour for gumming. As one of
the first measures against disease a large
number of varieties was imported from
overseas. Those from Java included
P.0.J.2878 and several other high num-
bered P.O.J. canes. The batch of 65
canes from Hawaii included varieties
which, from their breeding, could be
expected to be resistant to gumming, but
none ever became commercially impor-
tant.
The live years ending in the latter half
of 1933 saw a tremendous increase in the
activities of the Pathology Division, but
at the same time there were developments
in the field which made these imperative if
cane growing were to be continued as a
profitable industry in certain districts.
In South Queensland gumming disease
was easily the main pathological prob-
lem. The very dry spring of 1929 caused
severe losses over wide areas, particularly
in the drier localities about Bundaberg.
The damage caused then was probably as
serious as in any outbreak of the past


and it was fortunate indeed that suc-
ceeding favourable seasons prevented
undue losses while the new gumming
resistant canes were being multiplied to
the stage of commercial propagation. Fiji
disease continued to be a major problem in
the Maryborough district and had
extended at Bundaherg; the outbreaks at
Childers and at Bingera further justified
the importance attached to this disease.
The disease known first as “pseudo-scald”
but now called chlorotic streak was
recorded at Proserpine in 1929 and seen
subsequently in many varieties in the
North. A small trial in Brisbane indi-
cated that the disease caused serious losses
in Badila. Dwarf disease was found at
Mackay in 1930. It occurred chiefly in
P.0.J.2714, although P.0.J.213 was also
affected. This was a disease new to the
sugar-cane world and some alarm was felt
when it was found on several farms. For-
tunately, however, it has been fairly easily
controlled.
SEARCH FOR GUMMING RESISTANT
VARIETIES.
The staff of the Pathology Division
during this period consisted of A. F.
Bell, W. Cottrell-Dormer, E. J. Ferguson
Wood and N. L. Kelly, It was fully

occupied on field and investigational
work, the results of which were of benefit
to overseas workers as well as the cane
growers of Queensland. Importations of
canes continued, even though a suitable
insect-proof quarantine house had not yet
been built and the new canes had to be
propagated in open quarantine. The
urgency of the demand for gumming
resistant canes warranted the risk being
taken and, as far as it known, there was.
not a single case of a disease from over-
seas getting into the country per medium
of these introductions. By the end of
1933 the gum-resistant canes, C 0.281 r
C 0.290,.290, P.0.J.213, P.0.J.234, P.0.J.2725
and P.0.J.2878, as well as many others
which did not reach commercial promi-
nence, were ready for trial or use on
farms. It was realized that importations
would not always provide the most suit-
able canes, and seedling raising was com-
menced at each of the Experiment
Stations. Some success had already
attended seedling raising at South John-
stone and the S.J. series was to become
well-known. At the present day 5.J.4
is still an important cane in Mossman and
S.J. 10 is popular on the Burdekin. The
cane-hreeding was not then carried out by
the Pathology Division but was under its
direct supervision. In later years the
close association between pathology and
cane breeding was emphasized when
C. G. Hughes had charge of the crossing
work and took an active part in seedling
selection. At the present time a separate


breeding section has been established but
there is at all times close liaison between
the cane-breeders and the pathologists
and no new seedling is released until it
has been passed through disease resistance
trials.
DEVELOPMENT OF CLEAN SEED SCHEMES.
Many district surveys were carried out
during 1928 and 1929 in order to locate
disease-free farms as sources of clean
seed, and just prior to the widespread
planting of the gum-resistant canes more
than 6,000 tons of clean seed had been
provided in the Bundaberg area alone.
The clean-seed scheme naturally was not
needed when the major diseases were
brought under control by resistant
varieties but within 'recent years it has
been revived in a modified form, and of
course against different diseases, by the
supervisors of the Cane Pest and Disease
Control Boards. In the Mulgrave area,
for instance, close supervision of plants
beipg used in the leaf scald and chlorotic
streak danger spots has recently effected
a big improvement in the disease situa-
tion, and similar activities in the Mackay
and Moreton areas have been an integral
part of disease control.
An isolation plot in which small
amounts of a large number of varieties
could be grown under close observation
was established in 1930 on Stradbroke
Island in Moreton Bay. This disease-
free site acted both as a museum of
varieties and as a source of plants for
particular purposes such as export to
other countries, or for disease resistance
or investigational trials. Later, the
variety garden was transferred to the
mainland at Lawnton about 18 miles
north of Brisbane. It is now on the pro-
perty of the Queensland Acclimitization
Society at Redland Bay, a vegetable-
growing area of volcanic soil, on More-
ton Bay. There are at present 121
varieties in the plot.
LABORATORY RESEARCH.
The research work of the Division was
advanced by the establishment of well-
equipped laboratories at Brisbane in the

Agriculture and Stock. The advantage of
siting the laboratories in the capital city,
where scientists in other branches of the
Government service and the University
could be contacted are obvious, even
though the situation would not permit of
the establishment of an adjacent cane
paddock. This difficulty was removed by
the acquisition of a reserve of three acres,
less than half a mile from the Head
Office. The plot is not affected by frosts
and is served by city water. Not more
than an acre has ever been used but this
small plot has proved invaluable for
pathological research. It is planned to
build experimental glass houses on the
plot in the near future, when much of
the work formerly done there will have
been transferred to an area of cultiva-
tion at Moggill, some ten miles from the
city.

DISEASE RESISTANCE TRIALS.
The testing of varieties for resistance
to disease was one of the most urgent
jobs which the newly constituted Division
had to tackle. The technique had to be
worked put immediately for gumming
disease and soon afterwards for Fiji
disease. The problem was to test the
varieties as quickly as possible, often with
the minimum amount of planting
material, and to obtain results which
would allow an accurate forecast of
behaviour when the new canes were pro-
pagated on a field scale. The first pro-
perly planned gumming resistance trial
and the first for any disease in Queens-
land was planted on Bundaberg Sugar
Experiment Station in September, 1928.
It was designed chiefly to furnish infor-
mation on the size and complexity of
trial required but unfortunately was
destroyed by heavy frosts. The trial
planted in the following year gave excel-
lent results although much simpler in lay-
out. The first leaf-scald trial was planted
at South Johnstone in spring, 1930, fol-
lowed by a red-stripe trial at Mackay in
1932, a downy mildew trial at Ayr in
1933 and the first Fiji trial (which had
been delayed owing to lack of knowledge
of the vector) at Eagleby in the same
year.
Concurrently with the field work a con-
siderable amount of research was under-
taken and, apart from numerous items
in the ‘‘Queensland Agricultural Journal”
and Annual Reports, several papers were
published. The first and in many ways
the most important was bulletin No. 2 of
the Division —Bulletin No. 1 was a print-
ing of a report by H. Tryon on
work done on top rot in North
Queensland in 1903. This Bulletin
No. 2 was A. F. Bell’s “A Key for
the Field Identification of Sugar Cane
Diseases” compiled as a result of his
studies abroad. It was widely distributed
in Queensland and served to bring
diseases to the notice of farmers and mill
officials alike. Bulletin No. 3 was pub-
lished in 1932 and included an article on
dwarf disease, another on the cane-killing
weed and the first comprehensive account
of top-rot disease. The latter, which was
by W. Cottrell-Dormer, included field and
laboratory studies. Bulletin No. 4,
entitled “Fiji Disease of Sugar Cane and'
its Transmission,” by R. W. Mun-
gomery and A. F. Bell, appeared in 1933.
It marked an important addition to our
knowledge and was the basis for the
design adopted in the resistance trials for
this disease. Other important work, the
results of which were not always pub-
lished, included the establishment of the
fact that gumming disease could not be-
transmitted per medium of the soil, the
development of a medium for the cul-
tivation of the fastidious Xanthomona&
albilineam, a varietal identification scheme-
based on a simplified Jeswiet system, the

LEGISLATIVE MEASURES FOR DISEASE
CONTROL,
It was soon apparent that the measures
required for the control of disease on the
several thousand cane farms in the State
needed strong legislative backing if they
were to be effective. The first important
legislation enacted for the specific pur-
pose of controlling disease in cane was
the proclamation under “The Diseases in
Plants Aot of 1929,” whereby nine sugar-
cane quarantine districts were defined.
The aim of this was to prevent the free
movement of cane plants from one part
of to another. It meant that all
transfers, except of cane for milling pur-
poses, had to be channelled through the
Bureau and were therefore under strict
•control. These quarantine districts, with
the addition of another one formed by
the cutting off of the Mossman area from
the northernmost district, are still in
force although the proclamation operates
under a different Act. Farmers could
still, however, plant any variety they
fancied and many were a menace to their
neighbours by maintaining a miscel-
laneous collection of susceptible varieties.
The introduction of the approved variety
system was initiated by an amendment to
the Regulation of Sugar Cane Prices
Act in 1934. Under this the Director of
Sug’ar Experiment Stations issued a list
to the Local Cane Prices Board in each
mill district, which then designated any
or all varieties in the list to be approved
varieties. The Board could not approve
any varieties apart from those on the

Director’s list. The penalty for deliver-
ing a variety not approved to the mill was
a flat rate deduction of ten shillings per
ton of cane. This was the position until
the major amendment of the Sugar
Experiment Stations Acts in 1938 by
which the Director issued an annual list
of approved varieties under these Acts;
varieties not included in this list were
prohibited. The grower is now liable to
a heavy fine for growing, and the miller
for accepting, cane of a variety not on
the approved list. It is worth noting that
of the three features which the Director is
required to take cognisance of for the pur-
pose of deciding approval or not, the first
mentioned is resistance to disease; agri-
cultural qualities and milling characteris-
tics are the other two.
Apart from the establishment of the
approved variety list on a firm basis, the
1938 amendment, together with various
minor amendments incorporated in sub-
sequent years, strengthened the Acts con-
siderably as a means of controlling
disease. They were designed specifically
for sugar cane and the crop was removed
from the effects of any other Act or Acts.
Power was given to prevent the growing
of varieties for longer than the second
ratoons when disease was present; a list
of diseases against which action could be
taken was proclaimed; provision was
made for the destruction of sugar cane,
which, although not itself diseased, might
have assisted in further spread of a
disease; quarantine areas within portions
of a mill area could be enforced;
farmers were required to give notice of
the appearance of a disease on their pro-
perties, and, most importantly with
regard to the machinery of controlling
disease, the cane pest and disease control
board system was instituted. The
amended Act gave the Director, either
directly or indirectly by advice to the
responsible Minister, very wide powers,
and heavy penalties were provided for
breaches.
CANE PEST AND DISEASE CONTROL
BOARDS.
The Cane Pest and Disease Control
Boards were set up in each district where
the pest or disease position warranted it
and at present there are 21 boards in
existence. Each Board has five members,,
two of whom are elected by the mill-
owners and three by the cane growers.
There is no government nominee on the
Boards, although in practice there is very
close co-operation between Bureau officers
and the Board members and staffs. The
Boards have a large measure of auto-
nomy but are under the general super-
vision of the Bureau and their accounts
are subject to inspection by the Auditor-
General. The establishment of the Boards
as working units devolved upon the mem-
bers of the pathology and entomology
staff who trained Board employees in the
detection of disease and were always
available for consultation and help in any
emergency. In most areas it was not
possible to control disease merely by the
substitution of resistant varieties and
many somewhat susceptible varieties were
grown, which necessitated extensive
roguing campaigns in the commercial
crops. The Bundaberg district was, and
still is, an example of this. The variety

tant to gumming disease and that disease

that and other canes supplanted the older
varieties. However, P.0.J.2878 is sus-
ceptible to both Fiji and downy mildew
diseases and it was only the constant
inspection and rogidng by the Board
gangs which allowed these diseases to be
held in check until a new, more resistant
cane, C.P.29/116, was propagated. These
inspections are planned firstly to detect
any outbreaks of disease, and secondly to
control any outbreaks found. The scale
of operations is quite impressive in some
districts; at Mackay up to 45,000 acres
were inspected in one year, at Bundaberg
35,000, and in the much smaller Moreton
area 4,500 acres. The work is financed
entirely by local funds and the individual
contributing farmers and millers take an
interest in the Board’s work. The Boards
have a flexibility of management and
detailed knowledge of local conditions
which would be very difficult to achieve
in a Government department and as a
virtual extension service of the Bureau
are an important adjunct to its functions.
Subsidiary to the direct control of disease
are several other aspects of the Boards
work which are quite important; some,
for instance, conduct isolation plots for
the introduction of varieties supplied by
the Bureau; others have quite extensive
clean-seed schemes in operation and
others again take an interest in the pro-
pagation of new varieties in their
districts.
RECENT WORK OF DIVISION OF
PATHOLOGY.
At the time of the amending Act of
1938 the Bureau pathology staff con-
sisted of A. F. Bell, C. G. Hughes
and D. R. L. Steindl,, with C. W. Leeee
as technician in the laboratory. Field
work was combined with research and at
about this time was published a Technical
Communication on alternate hosts of
X. vasculorum by C. G. Hughes, one on
legume inoculation in Queensland cane-
fields by D. R. L. Steindl and “Downy
Mildew Disease of Sugar Cane and Other
Grasses/’ by C. W. Leece. The 1939-45
war put a stop to all pathological activi-
ties except those necessary to prevent
diseases causing or likely to cause serious
losses in production. At the end of the
war A. F. Bell relinquished his position
as officer in charge of the Division of
Entomology and Pathology (the two divi-
sions had been fused into the one in 1934)
and was succeeded by R. W. Mungomery.
Leeee had already resigned and Messrs.
Hughes and Steindl, later assisted by a
cadet, carried on the pathological work.
Recent developments in the pathology
field include the working out of a prac-
tical method for the control of pineapple
disease and research into the ratoon

streak disease.

always likely to cause serious trouble
when the plantings have to be made in the
cooler months, and has been particularly
severe in the Lower Burdekin area.
Treatment of the setts prior to planting
by dipping in a solution of mercurial
compound exercises a complete control
and in the worst affected areas the treat-
ment has become a general practice. A
Farm Bulletin has been published giv-
ing practical details. The research into
ratoon stunting disease has revealed
that the lack of vigour in the ratoon
crops, and to a lesser extent in the plant
cane, is due to a transmissible disease
probably caused by a virus. It is possible
that the studies on this disease will indi-
cate the true reason why many varieties
are notoriously poor yielders in the
ratoons and why some varieties have been
considered to run out; both are prob-
lems of general interest to cane sugar
producers throughout the world.

PRESENT DISEASE POSITION.
The history of the pathology section
would not be complete without some
account of the important diseases which
have had to be contended with in the
various districts during the years since
active control measures have been under-
taken. Commencing in the far North at
Mossman, leaf scald and chlorotic streak
are present, but downy mildew, which
had been recorded there for many years,,
appears to have been eradicated, whilst
gumming disease, although causing the
abandoning of the variety S.J.d in a large
part of the mill area, has been brought
under control.
At Hambledon, near Cairns, the sub-
stitution of the susceptible 5.J.4 and
H.Q.426 by more resistant varieties has
eliminated gumming disease but has.
brought a new degree of susceptibility
to downy mildew to the district. A
recent localized outbreak of this disease
did occur but a vigorous roguing cam-
paign prevented its spread. It is as yet
too early to say that the disease was
eradicated since the last diseased stool
was found only in April, 1949.
In the Mulgrave mill area gumming
caused the loss of S.J.d and H.Q.426, as
in the neighbouring Hambledon area, but
the disease has not been recorded for
some years now and steps have already
been taken to re-introduce these varieties.
Leaf scald and chlorotic streak, com-
panion diseases of the wetter lands
throughout the north, are being kept
under control at Mulgrave by strict con-
trol of the sources of plants.
From Babinda to the Herbert River,
leaf scald and chlorotic streak occur in
varying amounts depending on the
locality and variety; where active steps
have been taken these diseases are under
control. On the alluvial soils of the
Lower Burdekin where downy mildew was
so serious in 8.208 two decades ago, the
disease has been eradicated and this
variety together with the susceptible
5.J.16 are popular canes. Mosaic disease
is under control and the dipping of plants
in a mercurial solution has guaranteed
satisfactory strikes in fields subject to
pineapple disease.

the susceptible P.0.J.2878 to become
again a major cane. Dwarf disease
occurs only in small amounts. Mosaic
disease is present and ratoon stunting,
which can be controlled by supervision of
the sources of plants, is fairly wide-
spread. The new but already important
and popular cane, Q. 50, is susceptible to
red rot, which has been responsible for
the discarding of C 0.29 0; it remains to
be seen whether Q. 50 will also succumb
to the disease. The cane-killing weed
occurs sporadically at Mackay.
In the Bundaberg district the eclipse
of the gum-susceptible canes such as
D. 1135 and M. 19005. was followed by the
widespread planting of P.0.J.2878,
C 0.290 and other resistant varieties.
C 0.290 lost favour chiefly on account of
red rot, while downy mildew and Fiji
diseases were kept under control reason-
ably well in P.0.J.2878 until the advent
of C.P.29/116, which subsequently became
the major variety. Except for a moderate
degree of susceptibility to Fiji disease,
C.P.29/116 appears to be resistant to the
other diseases of South Queensland and
its continued cultivation on the present
extensive scale is very desirable from the

disease point of view. Rind disease which
is normally a disease of over-ripe cane is
likely to cause some damage in some of
the newer southern varieties. Ratoon
stunting disease is present but the elimi-
nation of Q. 28 should bring it under
control.
Maryborough, which was once the
scene of the most severe damage due to
Fiji disease ever seen in Queensland,
has been cleaned so thoroughly that the
susceptible variety M. 19005. is now
restored to the approved list. Chlorotic
streak has been recorded at Mary-
borough but is apparently not doing
any damage. In the Moreton mill area,
as at Bundaberg, gumming w r as brought
under control by the use of P.0.J.2878
and Co. 290. However, Fiji disease could
not be controlled by roguing in
P.0.J.2878 and the variety has gone out
of favour while Co. 290 suffered severely
from red rot. The newer canes such as
C.P.29/116, Q. 28 and Q. 47 are being
watched closely in respect of both Fiji
and chlorotic streak diseases. The small
area of Rocky Point, between Brisbane
and the New South Wales border, has
some Fiji and chlorotic streak disease.


A Short History of Bureau Cane Breeding.
By J. H. BUZACOTT.
Mr. J. H. BUZACOTT—Senior Cane Breeder.
Botanists and other scientists working
on sugar cane are agreed that the
probable centre of origin of the species
of Sacchamm which have given rise to
the commercial canes of the world, is in
the south-east corner of the Asian
continent and in the string of islands
extending through the East Indies and
out into the Pacific Ocean. It is remark-
able therefore that Australia, which is
only about 100 miles from New Guinea
across Torres Strait, has not a single
indigenous cane of any sort. There are
none of the wild canes found growing
in dense thickets in New Guinea and the
aboriginals have never cultivated any of
the canes found in the gardens of the
New Guinea natives. Perhaps the fire-
stick and the general improvidence of the
nomad natives have been responsible, but
whatever the cause the lack of ready-
made varieties has meant that all canes for
the establishment of the sugar industry
had to be brought from overseas. Aus-
tralia is of course not unique in this
respect, for sugar cane does not occur
naturally in either North or South
America and only a useless type occurs
naturally in Africa.
The pioneers of the sugar industry in
Queensland were very much alive to the
necessity for obtaining a range of
varieties and from 1863, when Captain
Louis Hope with a planting of 20 acres
near Brisbane, established the first
commercial plantation in Queensland,
until the turn of the century nearly
300 varieties were imported from
all parts of the world. The farmers,
plantation owners and government
officials alike were certainly variety
conscious; it is to be regretted that
the knowledge of cane diseases was not
sufficiently advanced for them to be
disease-conscious also, for with the new
varieties came disease and subsequent
serious losses in later years. Australian
growers drew upon the cultivated
varieties of many countries for their
importations and, in addition, collections
were made for the first time in New
Guinea. The canes brought back from
that island had been selected by the
natives over many centuries for chewing
and were, as a rule, fairly thick, sweet
and soft-rinded. The first search was
undertaken by Ebenezer Cowley, an
officer of the Queensland Department of
Agriculture, in 1893. He brought back
ten varieties none of which ever became
an important commercial cane. The
second expedition, in 1896, was led by
Henry Tryon. He collected 72 clones
including the famous Badila, as well
as such canes as Mahona and the
Gorus, which in certain places have
enjoyed some popularity. For many
years Badila provided more than half the
crop north of Townsville and has only
very recently been displaced from its
position as the variety yielding the
greatest proportion of the total Queens-
land crop.


Mr. J. MITCHELL, who collected seed and
raised seedlings for the Queensland Acclimi-
tisation Society.
The degree of improvement in pro-
duction which can be obtained by the
importation of varieties is limited when
there is no stream of new improved
varieties coming forward. Fortunately
it was soon found that a continual supply
of new varieties could be provided by
seedlings, although the fact that the
widely grown Creole cane was sterile had
led many to believe that sugar cane
would not set seed. The fertility of cane
flowers was demonstrated as early as
1858 and during the next few years seed-
lings were grown at centres as far apart
as the British West Indies and Mauritius.
However, the importance of the discovery
was not generally realized and it was
not until 1888 when Soltwedel in Java
and Harrison and Bovell in Barbados
produced cane seedlings, that modern
cane-breeding can be said to have com-
menced. In the same year W. Soutter,
Manager of the Gardens of the Queens-
land Acclimitization Society, then at
Bowen Bridge, Brisbane, raised four seed-
lings from the variety China. In the
following year seedlings from five
different varieties were raised.
The Society continued its cane-breeding
activities until 1908 and, considering the
limited facilities and the unfavourable
climatic conditions, was remarkably
successful. One of its seedlings, Q. 813,
was grown in many districts in Queens-
land and as recently as 1935 produced
more than 10 per cent, of the Mackay
crop. In the early years of the century
the Colonial Sugar Refining Company
also raised some seedlings at Hambledon,
near Cairns. Among the varieties which
became prominent were H.Q.285, H.Q.409
and H.Q.426; the last-named is still
grown in North Queensland, chiefly on
account of its early maturity. The
company has continued its seedling rais-
ing and now conducts a station at
Macknade, North Queensland.
Several attempts were made by the
Bureau to obtain seedlings from arrows
picked at Mackay Experiment Station but
without success. In 1918, however, a new
Station was acquired at South Johnstone,
near Innisfail in the tropical wet belt
in North Queensland, and the Chemist-
in-Charge, P. Me Walters, was quite suc-
cessful in 1921 in raising seedlings from
the local fuzz. In the first year some
736 seedlings were planted out into the
field. By 1928, when E. J. Barke was
appointed to succeed Me Walters, the
annual plantings had risen to several
thousand, the actual number depending
usually on the success of the crossing
season. During the first few years seed-
lings were obtained from arrows natur-
ally pollinated in the field. However, an
investigation into the fertility of sugar

cane flowers at South Johnstone by W.
Cottrell-Dormer led’ to the adoption of
a system of controlled pollination in
1926 and at the same time use was
made of a dilute solution of sulphurous
acid for the maintenance of male arrows
during the pollination.
As has happened so often in the
history of cane-breeding the first batch of
seedlings yielded some excellent com-
mercial canes. Arrows collected in the
field from Badila produced, among others,
seedlings which eventually became well
known as 5.J.2, S.J.I and 5.J.16. The
first, 5.J.2, is a moderate yielder with a
very high sugar content and in certain
parts of the Ingham, Burdekin and
Alackay areas has given very good
returns. It Avas eighth on the list of
important canes in Queensland in 1942.
5.J.4 became a very important variety in
North Queensland in some mill areas.
At Mossman it yielded over 70 per cent,
of the tonnage crushed in 1946; at
Hambledon in 1940 it yielded two-fifths
of the crop; at Mulgrave it was second
only to Badila for some years and

disease appeared in it but is still regarded
as a good cane and is being re-introduced
at Mulgrave now that gumming disease
has apparently been eradicated. 5.J.16
has been tried in various districts and
appears to have found an important
place in the crops of the Burdekin. In
1949 it yielded 17 per cent, of the cane
crushed there.
In 1929 attempts made to raise seed-
lings at Maekay and Bundaberg from
fuzz from South Johnstone were a failure.
In the following year, however, heating-
frames were provided and some reason-
ably satisfactory germinations obtained.
They were supplemented by some seed-
lings sent from South Johnstone and more
than 1,000 seedlings were set out at each
station. The extension of seedling rais-
ing to the other stations coincided with
the first use as parents of the newly-
introduced P.O.J. and Co. canes. Seed-
ling raising has, with a minor interrup-
tion at Bundaberg during the war, con-
tinued ever since as a major part of the
operations on both stations. Within the
last twelve months an experiment station
has been founded at Ayr and seedlings
will be raised there this year.
It was soon realised that the hazards
associated with the production of cane
seed at South Johnstone were too great
for that centre to become a permanent
breeding station, and in 1930 plantings
of parental canes were made on a farm
at Freshwater, to the north of Cairns.
Crosses made there in 1931 proved that
the new site was superior to the old>
especially with regard to the reliability
of the arrowing, and by 1935, when the
breeding station was transferred to the
Northern Experiment Station at Meringa r
near Gordonvale, all crossing was being*
undertaken at Freshwater. There was no
immediate attempt to build up a varietal
garden at Meringa and for the next few

years the crossing work remained con-
fined to the Freshwater plantings.
Before the transfer from South John-
stone, E. J. Barke visited Java to investi-
gate the cane breeding methods in use
there. In addition, an importation of
fuzz, the only one on record for Queens-
land, was made from Hawaii. The
resultant seedlings were not a commercial
success although one cane, the parentage
of which unfortunately was lost, became
Q. 27 and has proved a useful parent for
North Queensland.
The extension of seedling raising on a
fairly large scale to the three stations
meant that buildings and equipment had
to be provided at each centre. The

feet by 60 feet is the largest of the three
and was built in 1935. That at Bunda-
berg was finished in 1936 and the Mackay
one in 1938. Each house is equipped
with a hot water boiler and heating
pipes, benches mounted on castors for
easy shifting when loaded with seedling
flats, and provision for maintaining a
high humidity without excessive tempera-
tures on sunny days. Associated with
the glasshouses are steam flat sterilizers,
compost pits, soil-mixing sheds and
concrete benches for the young potted
seedlings. The new station at Ayr is
now in process of being equipped in a
similar fashion.
During the course of the next ten years
a considerable amount of research was
undertaken by the Committee on Seedling
Raising which consisted of the Assistant
Director (A. F. Bell), C. G. Hughes
(Pathologist), and the Officers in Charge
of the three Experiment Stations. This
work included investigation into methods
of cross pollination and at the same time
a satisfactory scheme of selection of the
seedlings was developed.
Arrows being transported to crossing field.
The results of the work have been
set out in a Technical Communication,
“ The Production and Testing of Sugar
Cane Seedlings,” by C. G. Hughes,
published in 1949.
It was obvious that the complete solu-
tion method, in which both males and
females are maintained in solution, had
many advantages over both open-pollina-
tion and the method in which the female

arrow sets and ripens seed whilst still
attached to the stool in the ground. The
all-solution technique allows the con-
centration of all crosses in a compara-
tively small area so that they can be
easily kept under close observation during
all stages from pollination to the picking
of the seed.
Experiments showed that the most
suitable solution was a mixture of .01
per cent, sulphur dioxide and .01 per
cent, phosphoric acid and, whilst some
losses did occur among the female arrows,
they were not unduly large and the
average solution cross produced as many
viable seeds as comparable crosses made
in the held at the same time. The use of
solution crosses allowed the transfer of the
crossing work from Freshwater to the
Experiment Station and a consequent
increase in the number of crosses which
could be handled. At the present time
practically all crosses are made in solu-
tion, the odd exception being made in the
field when an important female which
does not keep well in solution produces
only a few arrows.
The contamination of one cross by the
pollen from an adjacent one may be
prevented by an adequate spacing of the
crosses, but this considerably increases
the area needed and some other method
had to be developed. The crossing-
lanterns used at various stations over-
seas were not suitable for Queensland
conditions and a special type measuring
3 feet x 3 feet x 6 feet was evolved.
These are made of cotton voile on a
wooden frame and, when mounted on
battens on wooden scatfolding in a posi-
tion sheltered from boisterous winds,
allow a large number of solution crosses
to be made in a comparatively small
space.
The chief source of arrows for the
crossing in 1937 was the planting at
Freshwater, but over the succeeding
years the plantings made at Meringa
became the more important. The majority
of varieties arrow quite satisfactorily at
Meringa and an extensive crossing pro-
gramme can be carried out using arrows

ment of Agriculture, who led the expedition to

from the Station alone. HoAvever,
observations have shown that plantings
at Freshwater consistently produce more
arrows than those at Meringa, and that
they emerge at an earlier date. At the
present time the Freshwater plot is much
smaller than the Meringa plantings and
in general includes only shy arroAvers or
canes which have a very brief arrowing
period. At Meringa more than 300
varieties are in cultivation. The main-
tenance of such a nursery of canes of
widely divergent growth habits needs
constant attention; the weak ratooners,
for instance, have to be replanted every
year, Avhile certain Avild canes have to be
watched lest they take charge and croAvd
out the less hardy commercial varieties.
One of the difficulties frequently met
with in making crosses between different
canes is that the arroAving periods do not
overlap. Experiments to force canes to

was often of assistance, the most useful
results Avere obtained by the lopping of
the leaves during the summer months.
Such a practice could be applied only to
freely arrowing varieties but it definitely
delayed the arrowing or spread it over
a longer period.
Further results of the work in the
years following ]937 were the synthesizing
of a large number of parents and the
use of a much wider range of parents
than before. The cold-resistant spon-
taneum strain from Turkmenistan Avas
incorporated in a number of crosses and

It Aims agreed that sowing the fuzz as
soon as it was ready in late June, July
or August led to an undesirable late
planting of the seedlings in the field,

mercial planting dates. The planting of

selected in the following winter. The
most practical method of overcoming
this obstacle was to store the fuzz from
one season to the following year. Experi-
ments showed that fuzz stored very well
if dried, then packed in air-tight tins
containing a small amount of calcium
chloride, and kept at a temperature below
40°F. The stored fuzz retains its ger-
minating capacity and can be sown
during the summer. Seedlings are then
put out into the held by early winter and
thus enjoy a growing period somewhat
comparable with commercial plantings.
Fuzz from exploratory crosses or those
particularly desired can, of course, be
still sown soon after ripening and put
out into the held that year.
The methods of selection in the seed-
lings received considerable attention
during the ten years under review and
at present a workable scheme has been
evolved. It is in no sense, hnal and will
no doubt be modified considerably at
several points with further experience.

selection within such a small plot

different parts of the field and also
ensures that all seedlings are not taken

the best growth. Selection is usually
made on the ratoons at Meringa and it
is considered that if possible seedlings
at all Stations should be selected at that
stage. The percentage of seedlings
selected for further propagation is usu-
ally less than two per cent, but the
indications at present are that it would be
advisable to increase this, even if it meant
a reduction in the number of original
seedlings grown.
Some interesting information on a
statistical basis has been obtained with
regard to the selection of the original

seedlings. Comparisons of figures for
stooling and brix in these seedlings with
those obtained when the seedlings are
planted out into the 40-sett plot stage,,
show that selectors should not attach
much importance to difference between
original seedlings unless they are con-
siderable. Analysis showed for instance
that a difference of three sticks between
plant original seedling individuals —
that is, a difference of the order of 25
to 35 per cent. —has to be disregarded
when making the selections. Indications,
were that an even larger difference
was necessary in ratoon seedlings.
Differences in hand refractometer
average brixes of samples taken by trier
from the growing stalks similarly have
to be disregarded unless they are greater
than two units in plant seedlings;
ratoon figures have to exceed three units.
The first propagation planting of a
4 x 10-sett plot allows observations on
agricultural habits but it is impossible at
this stage, owing to the variability which
occurs between stools in the one clone, to
attach significance to differences in yield
between the various seedlings or between
seedlings and the plots of the standard
cane. Selection is from plant 40-sett plots
and some significance is attached to the
figures for sugar obtained from this
planting. All seedlings taken in the
40-sett plot selection are planted in yield
observation trials, followed after growth
in plant and first ratoons by a planting
of the advanced seedlings in some form of
replicated trial. These are propagated
on commercial farms away from the
Experiment Stations either before or
after the results have been obtained from
the replicated Station trials and are then
ready for assessment as commercial
varieties, providing the reactions to the
diseases against which they have been
tested have proved satisfactory.
Although a great deal of time during
the last few years has been devoted to
the long-range programme of building up
synthesized parents and special blood
lines, considerable success has already
been achieved in the production of com-
mercial varieties. They are designated
“Q” canes and some figure very
prominently in the varietal returns from


various districts. In the far north,
Q. 44 has yielded some excellent crops on
second-class land and, providing it can
be kept free from leaf-scald disease,
should continue its role of a useful,
although minor variety. Attempts to
produce a cane which would perform as
well as Badila on the better-class lands
of the northern areas and be more resis-
tant to diseases and pests have been

been tested as a parent in a wide range
of crosses. “Q” varieties have not proved
successful on the Burdekin, although as
mentioned previously, an earlier Bureau
seedling, 5.J.16, is an important variety
there. In the central districts about
Maekay the “Q” varieties have had their
greatest success to date. Q. 28, which was
bred in 1935, and went into farm trials
in 1941, had by 1945 become the leading

cultural characteristics and ability to
yield satisfactorily under adverse con-
ditions made it more generally useful than
any other variety. It yielded more than
half the tonnage of the Maekay crop in
1947 and 1948, but at present is being
eclipsed by the variety Q. 50. At the
moment it is difficult to prophesy which
variety will ultimately prove of the most
benefit to the district. Whichever one it
is, there is no doubt that both varieties
have yielded much heavier crops than the
varieties such as E.K.28, M. 19005. and
C 0.290,.290, which they have displaced.

It was recognized quite early in the
seedling work at the Experiment Stations
that a variety which proved successful
on a Station might not be so when tried
in another part of the same district. This
was overcome to some extent by propa-
gating advanced seedlings in commercial
plantings before any decision as to their
future was made, but it was thought that
the selection for a particular soil type or
for a locality climate should be made
from a number of original seedlings
grown on the spot. Accordingly, in
1946, plantings of original seedlings were
made at Babinda in the very wet tropical
area. In the following year plantings
were made at Mackay on a rich alluvial
soil quite different from that at the
Station but representative of a particular
class of cane-producing land. In the
south, seedlings from the Bundaberg
Experiment Station are transferred to a
plot at Beerwah for replanting and subse-
quent selection in the wet Moreton dis-
trict. The reason for making the move-
ment of seedlings through an isolation
plot is that downy mildew occurs at
Bundaberg and not in the Moreton
district.

The recent work has proceeded on the
lines laid down in the previous decade
although at present there is a fresh
emphasis on early maturity. It is
unfortunate that there is apparently a
high correlation between early maturity
and great dilution or absence of wild
blood. However, there are indications
that some satisfactory early maturing
canes may be produced in the near

The Work of the Division of Mill Technology.
By J. L. CLAYTON.
Mr. J. L. CLAYTON, Senior Mill
Technologist.
The Division of Mill Technology may
be regarded as the maturing offspring of
the Bureau organization, for on this
Jubilee occasion the Mill Technology
DiHsion may claim merely to have
attained its majority. Actually the first
steps towards the establishment of the
Division were taken in 1924 when
N. Bennett Avas selected by the Queens-
land Government to undergo a period of
training in sugar technology in overseas
countries. Bennett returned to Queens-
land in 1928 Avhieh marks the com-
mencement of the operation of the
Division.
The technical standards of the indus-
try at that time left much to be desired.
From the chemical point of Hew there
Avas a glaring lack of standardisation of
both equipment and methods. In the
manufacturing processes the mills oper-
ated for the most part as individual
units, dependent for advancement upon
their own initiative, and decidedly secre-
tive as to any features of equipment or
method which were considered to display
some superiority. Bennett’s early efforts
were directed mainly towards encourag-
ing co-operation between the mills and
co-ordination of nlethods. He urged the
standardisation of laboratory equipment
and procedure, uniformity of chemical
control data and the interchange of
results between mills. Two very signi-
ficant contributions to this policy were
made in 1929. In that year the Bureau
convened a meeting in Maekay at which
the decision was made to constitute the
Queensland Society of Sugar Cane Tech-
nologists. This organization did not
enjoy immediate popularity and was
regarded with considerable suspicion in
some quarters. However, thanks to the
solid support of its foundation members
and the inherent worth of the Society it
soon became firmly established in the
industry.
The other important event of 1929 was
the inauguration of the Mutual Control
Scheme —a scheme providing for the
interchange of factory operating data
between mills and based on practices in
several overseas countries. By 1930 the
scheme was operated on a fortnightly
basis, a practice which Avas maintained
until aetiAnties Avere temporarily aban-
doned during the war.
The Mutual Control Scheme has since
been revived and noAv circulates figures
on a weekly basis. The number of mills
contributing has increased to 26.
The first work of an experimental
nature was commenced in 1930 following
the appointment of E. R. Behne to
the staff, and the establishment of a
laboratory at Maekay. In addition to
considerable work on the standardisation
of glassware, Aveights and instruments,
Behne investigated many features of mill
operations and made a special study of
the manufacture of power alcohol from
B molasses.


The resignation of Bennett in 1932
represented a severe setback to the Divi-
sion in this early stage of its develop-
ment. The centre of activities was
transferred to Brisbane and the sole
technologist continued his investigations
under conditions which must have been
very trying.
The compilation of the Laboratory
Manual for Queensland Sugar Mills was
commenced in 1933, the first edition being
published in the following year. The
volume was well received and adopted as
the standard work of reference as to
analytical procedure in the industry.
No action was taken to increase the
staff of the Division until 1934 when D. L.
Mcßryde was appointed Assistant Mill
Technologist. In the following year he
was transferred to the field staff and N.
Smith was appointed in his stead. The
year 1935 also saw the appointment of Ir.
J. Eigenhuis as Engineer Technologist,
and the commencement of a period of
intense activity and fairly rapid expan-
sion. Under the direction of Eigenhuis
investigations were conducted into prac-
tically every section of mill operations,
the Technical Communications were
inaugurated and slack season research
projects undertaken. Smith resigned in
1937 and was replaced by G. H. Jenkins.
In 1938 Eigenhuis returned to Java and
A. H. Praeger and J. L. Clayton joined
the staff. Investigations were continued
both in the mills and in the laboratory.
The second edition of the Laboratory
Manual was published in 1939 and Tech-
nical Communications were issued fre-
rpiently during this period. When it began

to appear that the Technology Division
might at last have achieved some reason-
able degree of strength and stability the
outbreak of war disrupted the organiza-
tion. First, in 1941, Jenkins resigned,
and then in 1942 Praeger and Clayton
were made available to the Commonwealth
Government for service in the flax indus-
try. Once again, as in 1932, Behne
found himself the sole technologist
member of the Mill Technology staff.
Investigations into sugar manufacture
lapsed completely until 1945 when Clay-
ton returned from the south and J. H.
Nicklin was appointed Technologist
Engineer. The further appointments of
C. B. Yenton, in 1946, and L. R. Brain
and B. G. Adkins, in 1947, served to build
up the staff to record numbers.
Since the war the Division of Mill
Technology has undoubtedly occupied a
more prominent position in Bureau
affairs than previously. The visit of
Behne to Cuba, U.S.A. and Hawaii in
1945 represented the realization of an
ambition long cherished by the Division;
later, in 1948, when Behne resigned, Clay-
ton took charge of the mill operations
staff and in that year visited the terri-
tory of Hawaii.


Recently three further officers, A. D.
Doolan, K. Yore and A. G. Claire,
have been added to the staff, which now
comprises no less than nine. As might
be expected, in ' view of this rapid
expansion, the majority of the officers
lack experience, but all are equipped with
the necessary .technical background and
possess great potentialities.
It is of interest to review the most
obvious contributions which the Tech-
nology Division has made to sugar manu-
facture in Queensland.
THE QUEENSLAND SOCIETY OF SUGAR
CANE TECHNOLOGISTS.
This Society has enjoyed the full sup-
port of the Division since its incep-
tion and throughout the years a major
portion of the organization of .the
Society’s activities, particularly in
regard to the publication of the Pro-
ceedings, has been undertaken by the
Bureau. All the findings of the Division
which were of current local interest have
been communicated to the industry
through the Proceedings of the Society.
Whilst the Queensland Society of Sugar
Cane Technologists is a completely
independent body it has served as an
excellent liaison between the Bureau and
the industry.
THE WORK OF NORMAN SMITH.
Though he served only a brief period
with the Bureau, Smith’s investigations
yielded results of outstanding importance.
It is not generally known that Smith
practised and recommended fractional
liming during clarification tests in 1936,
and, whilst there is no certainty that this
discovery was made prior to that of
Davies, it was, at least, quite indepen-
dent. Later fractional liming proved to
be of immense benefit to the industry.
Smith also studied sugar boiling, par-
ticularly in relation to vacuum pan
design. His examination of the construc-
tion and performance of coil pans led to
the evolution of design standards which
subsequent experience has completely
vindicated. Recently developed types of
coil pan differ substantially from any
encountered by Smith, but his criteria of
performance are still applicable and
reliable.
Behne subsequently conducted a
parallel survey of calandria pans includ-
ing one of the Webre type. Although
his work yielded significant results the
natural circulation calandria pan has not
proved popular in Queensland, and it was
actually many years before the Webre
type enjoyed widespread favour.
SUGAR BOILING METHODS.
During the years up to about 193-f
sugar boiling in Queensland was-a mys-
terious art surrounded by secrecy and
revealed only to those who had served a
long apprenticeship in the work.
When the refiners commenced a cam-
paign for improvement in sugar quality
the Bureau appointed D. L. Mcßryde
to specialise in the subject. Later he
visited many mills instructing in the use
of the microscope for pan work and in
the regulation of boiling by conductivity.
Other investigators in the industry took
up the subject and by 1938 a new stan-
dard of boiling technique was established.
The Bureau constantly advocated the
adoption of the three massecuite system
and within a few years this became the
accepted practice at all but one or two-
mills.
Quite recently the boiling of final
massecuites has been made the subject of
exhaustive study and already it is clear
that there is a growing realization of the
benefits to be derived from an organized
study of the problem. There is still
room for a more scientific approach to
sugar boiling in the industry, but the
changes which have been brought about
in the past fifteen years are quite
spectacular.
THE SUGAR BUREAU pH METER.
The venture initiated by Eigenhuis into
the design,of a meter for the continuous
measurement of pH under factory con-
ditions was truly a pioneering effort.
Admittedly instruments had already been
proposed for this purpose, and Dr.
Khainovsky, in Java, had developed a


Part of pan stage—Tully Sugar Mill.
meter, but this was battery operated.
Eigenhuis set out to design a cheap
simple mains-operated pH meter suitable
for continuous use in the factory—and
was anxious to extend the work to pro-
vide for the automatic control of pH if
possible. The work was commenced in
1936 and successive models of pH meter
were produced until 1939, when the enter-
prise was handed over to the firm which
had co-operated in the work practically
from the beginning.
The Sugar Bureau pH meter is now
something of a back number, for continu-
ous operating pH meters are common-
place these days. Nevertheless, in its day,
the Bureau meter was a leader in the
field, and it is noteworthy that the prin-
ciples incorporated in its design are
easily recognizable in most of the more
modern units wdiich have since been
developed.
GENERAL.
The above items are only a few of
those which could be advanced. Since
1937, which really marks the beginning
of organized investigations, the following
aspects of mill operations have been
studied: Preparation of cane, milling,
maceration, boiler operation, clarifica-
tion, filtration, sugar boiling, crystalliza-
tion, fugalling, sugar conditioning, steam
economy and sampling and analytical
procedure.
Further important investigations were
undertaken in the Bureau laboratories
during the slack seasons from about 1936
onwards. A scheme was inaugurated
whereby chemists attached to various mill
companies performed the work under the
direction of the Bureau staff. Naturally,
the field of research during the slack
season is restricted, but at various times
bagasse, sugar and molasses have been
studied. The ultimate analysis of bagasse
and its calorific value, the physical
properties of raw sugar and molasses and
the conductometric determination of ash
were among the subjects selected.
The results of all major projects have
been published in the form of Technical
Communications; briefer or less impor-
tant findings have been recorded in
papers submitted to the Technologists’
Society; whilst notes of general interest
have been incorporated in the News
Letter, a periodical published by the
Bureau for local distribution.
Apart from research work the Division
has rendered considerable service to the
mills by way of investigations into par-
ticular local problems and reports on mill
operations. Of recent years the officers of
the Division have frequently been called
into consultation in plans for major
alteration or extension in various fac-
tories. Regular services include the test-
ing of all types of volumetric glassware
as well as brix hydrometers, polariseopes,
polariseope tubes and weights. Scientific
instruments of various types are over-
hauled and calibrated; indicators, buffers
and colorimetric pH standards are issued
regularly, and in general by way of
advice or assistance every effort has been
made to supply the requirements of the
mills.

FACTORY WORK.
In any attempt to analyse the per-
formances of the Queensland factories
since the formation of the Division of
Mill Technology one is confronted with
the results of the influence of a multi-
tude of uncontrollable factors, and it is
now quite apparent that the effects of
these variables overshadow any increases
in technical efficiency which may be
attributable directly to research.
Besides the part played by these factors,
the industry in Queensland has suffered
considerably from external influences,
and it is exceedingly difficult to estimate
real improvements in the operating
standards of the factories.
In Fig. 1 are illustrated the changes
iu production which have taken place in
the last 21 years. Although the produc-
tion figures for 3948 and 1949 were con-
siderably higher than any previously
recorded, it will be seen that the lowest
yield for the period occurred in 1943,
when the amounts of cane and sugar
produced were almost half the quantities
for 1948 and 1949. Under such condi-
tions it is difficult to maintain high
standards of performance.
Of course, in normal times, the most
important single factor influencing the
work of the factory is the quality of the
cane to be crushed, and obviously this is
affected by conditions which cannot be
controlled. However, in the period under
review the factories have been adversely
affected, in addition, by practices con-
sequent upon wartime conditions. The
influence of these factors is immediately
evident from a perusal of the graphs in
Figs. 2 and 3 where the values of various
criteria of performance have been
plotted. In Fig. 2, the quality of the
cane has been represented by the purity
of the first expressed juice.
It will be seen that except for com-
paratively minor variations, the purity
of the first expressed juice remained
reasonably constant at about 89.6 per
cent, until 1945. In subsequent seasons
the purity has been abnormally low, par-
ticularly in 1946, when a large portion of
the cane-growing districts suffered a
severe drought. It is apparent that until
1941 there was a general upward trend
in the pol recovery which provides a
clear indication of improved efficiency of
operation. It is seen from Fig. 2 that
when appreciable changes occur in the
purity of the first expressed juice the
pol recovery varied in the same direc-
tion. Similarly the amount of molasses
produced per ton of cane is directly
related to the quality of the cane crushed.
The values for the co-efficient of work
varied rather spectacularly prior to 1941
and the reasons for some of these are
not clear. However, the general decline
in the co-efficient of work from 1934 to
1938 coincided with a particularly large
increase in the crushing rate. The year
1939 marked the first signs of the general
improvement in factory work which
resulted from the extensive programme of
research commenced about 1937. At this
time the processes involved in milling,
clarification, sugar boiling and fugalling
were closely studied, and concurrently
several new types of equipment were
introduced into the Queensland factories-


No. 1 effet vessel at Inkerman Mill—

However, without a doubt, the most sig-
nificant improvement occurred in the
boiling house following the investigation
into both the boiling process and the
■design of the vacuum pans. The three
massecuite system was gradually being
accepted by the industry also, with the
result that conditions were being made
■easier on the pan stage.
The improvement in all phases of the
boiling house was undoubtedly respon-
sible for the sharp rise in co-efficient of
work. At the same time it Avas found
possible to increase the crushing rate
and maintain the standard of work.
In 1942 the full impact of wartime
•conditions was felt by the industry. For
this and the following three seasons, the
uncertain labour position, the enforced
restriction on crushing rate and the neces-
sity, in many mills, for two-shift opera-
tions caused a se\’ere slump in factory
efficiency. Although circumstances were
becoming more favourable by 1945, the
industry Avas destined to Avait until 1948
before production reached the 1941 level.
Very poor seasons in 1946 and 1947, due
mainly to drought conditions, were
responsible for the worst performance
figures of the period.
Although production has now returned
to normal standards, the factory efficiency
has not responded so quickly. In the
first place, owing to the inability of mills
to pursue the normal programme of
replacement of obsolete equipment dur-
ing the war, a rush to order new plant
occurred immediately afterwards and
long delay between the placing of an
order and the delivery of the plant has
resulted. The position was aggravated
seriously by the introduction of the 40-
hour week, and the necessity for still
higher rates has made efficiency a second-
ary consideration. Apart from this,
there are several features of the post-
war economy which have militated against
improved performance. Most of these
are associated with casual practices
adopted in the field during the war.
Thus, now most of the cane is delivered

burnt instead of green as it was previ-
ously ; carelessness in harvesting has
resulted in a sharp increase in the amount
of extraneous matter; and often long
delays occur between the burning of the
cane and its delivery to the mill.
It is considered that although the per-
formance figures for the last two seasons
are not outstanding, in most cases the
actual factory work has been of a high
standard, and the mills have done very
well to compete with past performances
under much less favourable circum-
stances.
At the present time important changes
are taking place in the industry and
many new types of equipment are being
installed. Once again probably the most
important advances made in factory
equipment have been in the boiling house
and fugal stations. Almost all factories
have installed or have taken delivery of
high-speed fugals for the treatment of
final massecuites. In addition the use of
Webre pans and pans of the flattened
coil type has led to considerable improve-
ment in the boiling of C massecuite. In
the design of coil pans Queensland
undoubtedly leads most other countries.
Power alcohol distillery at Sarina.
Social and economic conditions in
Queensland at present make it justi-
fiable to sacrifice efficiency in favour of
throughput, and this state of affairs is
likely to continue for at least another
three years.
By 1953 the mills should have com-
pleted the major portion of the expan-
sion programme now proceeding and it
should then be possible to demonstrate
properly the technical advances which
have been made since the Division of Mill
Technology commenced its work.

Cane and sugar production in Queensland for 22 years. The full effect of wartime shortages
of labour, fertilizer and machinery was felt in 1943.
Although the acreage harvested did not fall appreciably in the war years the effect of
fertilizer shortage on production was to almost halve the crop.


Illustrating the principal avenues of usage of molasses.
Contrasting sugar per acre production in the irrigated Burdekin district with that of
the whole State.


Curves illustrating trends in various key figures for 24 Queensland factories.
Crushing Rate and Pol Extraction curves for 24 Queensland factories.


Illusrating the trend of sugar values during the past fourteen years.


The improvement in cane and sugar production 'per acre over 48 years. During that period sugar per acre has increased
from 1.45 to 3.52 tons per acre.

Table Showing from 1910 to 1948 the Number of Mills North and South of
Townsville and the Sugar Produced.
Table showing Industry Income and Expenditure on Bureau Research since 1926.
* Prior to the Act of 1934 the Treasury endowed the assessment £ for £ ; subsequent to that
year the Government contribution was limited to £7,000. These amounts should therefore be
deducted from those shown above to arrive at industry expenditure. The percentage of income shown
includes the Government contribution.
