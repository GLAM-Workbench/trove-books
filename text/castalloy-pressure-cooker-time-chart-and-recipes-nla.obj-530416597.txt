CASTALLOY
The Safety Pressure Cooker
(PATENTS APPLIED FOE)
Your Castalloy Cooker is made from the highest quality
Hiduminium Alloy.
It has extra thickness to give a much greater safety
factor than other cookers. The machined thick bottom
makes it ideal for electric stoves as well as for any
other heating means.
The principal of the Castalloy Pressure Cooker is that
water within the cooker is heated to form steam, this
steam is maintained fit a pressure of 15 pounds per
square inch by means of a safety pressure release valve
This super-heated steam cooks the food very rapidly
and efficiently without waste of food juices.
There are many advantages of your Castalloy Pressure
Cooker over normal cooking means.
1. It is economical and much quicker as a result of
shorter cooking times.
2. Less heat and food odors are present in the kitchen
making more pleasant cooking.
3. Full food value is retained in all foods cooked in
your Castalloy Cooker due to this controlled cooking.
4. All foods will retain their natural flavours. They
are tastefully delicious and will please every member
of the family.
The Castalloy Cooker is very safe to operate and is
tested to several times its normal operating pressure
before being passed for service.
You can expect several years of trouble-free service
if you take reasonable and intelligent care of your
Castalloy Cooker.


THINGS NOT TO DO
NOT take cover off without first turning control
valve to open.
NOT attempt to force cover off as there may still
be pressure within cooker.
NOT pour cold water over rubber safety valve
when .cooling as this may cause cold water
to be sucked into food.
NOT use less water than recommended when cook-
ing. Always put water in before food.
NOT immerse over-heated cooker in ccld water if
cooker has been allowed to boil dry. Allow
to cool slowly as sudden chilling may crack
the metal. Replace sealing ring and
safety valve rubbers if damaged through over-
heating.
NOT fill cooker more than two-thirds full when
cooking soups, stews, etc.
NOT attempt to cook foods that extend to the
top of cooker. The food may block the
rubber safety valve and control valve open-
ing.
NOT damage rim of cooker or edge of cover and
make sure they are free from food particles,
salts or greases. This may otherwise prevent
proper sealing.
NOT damage control valve as it may be
thrown out of adjustment. It is recom-
mended to store cooker with cover upside
. down in cooker pan.
NOT be frightened of your Castalloy Cooker.
The steam is exhausted at relatively low
pressure and will not scald unless of course
hand is placed within one inch of exhaust
holes.


OPERATION
First add required amount of water then insert
rack or basket into Cooker Pan as required and
place in food. Ensure sealing ring is engaged in
its groove. Put cover on pan with handles apart
until notches engage, then close by bringing handles
together so that cover handle is directly above pan
handle.
Place cooker over heat and set steam control to
OPEN. Allow steam to flow from holes at base
of steam control to drive out all air from within
cooker. Then close valve and when steam again
flows from control holes, reduce heat under cooker
until steam will only just continue to flow from holes.
Your cooking period starts from this time. It is
important NOT to keep heat so high that a large
volume of steam comes from the holes. (Make
sure the control valve IS in the closed position.)
When heat has been maintained for the required
period of time remove cooker from heat. Do not
overcook. Cooking will continue without further
heat until the temperature and pressure within the
cooker is reduced. It will take 10 to 15 minutes
for the pressure to reduce on its own accord.
Many foods would be overcooked in this period in
which case they would require instant pressure
reduction.
To achieve instant pressure reduction set cooker in
cold water or allow cold tap water to run over
cooker. Another method is to gradually open the


control valve. This can be achieved by opening
and shutting the valve for very short periods until
the main pressure is exhausted, then leave valve
open. If pressure has been reduced on its own
accord, valve can be opened immediately.
It is important NOT to suddenly open control
valve until pressure is reduced and NOT to
attempt to remove cover from cooker pan until
control valve is in the release position and all
steam is exhausted from cooker. A too sudden
release of pressure may cause food to escape
through the control valve.
All meats should be thoroughly seared before
cooking to prevent escape of juices. For best
results heat your cooker well before adding the fat.
to ensure even distribution.
Stored vegetables take a longer time to cook than
fresh vegetables. If vegetables are overcooked
they may turn dark. Cut to uniform size before
cooking. Remember, it is better to under-cook
than to over-cook.
Always add sufficient water to last throughout
cooking period as damage could be caused to your
cooker through overheating.
Use less seasoning than in ordinary cooking. Ihe
natural juices are retained in the food and it does
not require much seasoning..
cleaning your cooker make sure the sealing
ring is properly in its groove. To ensure this run
a knife around between the edge of the sealing ring
and the groove.
To use as a Dutch oven. Heat cooker on stove
to medium heat about 10 minutes. First remov-
ing rubber seals and valve. Then turn low
Makes an excellent oven to heat pies, etc.


CEREAL RECIPES
Two methods for preparing cereals are suggested.
Cereals may be prepared in the bottom of the cooker
by stirring the cereal into soiling water until rapid
boiling begins and the cereal is very smooth. Then the
cover should be placed on the cooker and the cereal
cooked the time specified in the recipe. After cooking,
the cereal should again be stirred.
When cooking cereals, use medium heat, instead of
high heat to avoid boiling over of cereal.
The second method suggested is to cook the cereal in
a separate bowl. This bowl should be placed within
the cooker. Be sure to select a bowl which does not
set tightly in the cooker, so as to permit ample steam
circulation. The cereal should be stirred into boiling
wader in the bowl and then stirred again after it is
cooked in order to get rid of any lumpiness. If this
method is followed, be sure to place an additional pint
of water in the cooker before putting in rack on which
the bowl is placed. In cooking cereals the cooker
should never be filled more than one half full. When
cereal is cooked in the bottom of the cooker be certain
only the amount of water called for in the recipe is used.
Additional water is necessary only when cooking cereal
in a separate bowl.
While the time given in the recipes and time-tables will
cook the cereals thoroughly, a little longer cooking
improves the flavour of most cereals.

SOUP RECIPES
Whether served as the introduction to a dinner or as
the main dish of the luncheon, soups should form an
important part of the regular diet. They are not expen-
sive, but nourishing and wholesome, and with your
cooker you have an efficient, economical method of
preparing the very finest of soups.
The high heat in the cooker extracts the gelatin from the
bone, making the soup richer in flavour and clearer in
colour. There is no cloudiness due to long, constant
boiling used in old methods. Smaller amounts of meat
may be used in soups prepared in your cooker for it
develops a fuller, richer flavour.
After cooking time is completed in preparing soups
allow 10 to 15 minutes to elapse before turning control
to open position or attempting to remove cover. If
the cover does not come off easily, do not force it
off. If the cover sticks, it is an indication that the vent
pipe may be blocked and that the cooker still contains
steam. In such case, cool the cooker under cold water
tap until the cover turns easily.

VEGETABLES
Nature provides most of our foods in appetizing and
attractive colours. With your cooker, the method of
cooking vegetables in either the leafy or root variety
retains a miximum of this natural colour and the dis-
tinctive garden-fresh flavour. And, more important,
it retains the vitamin and mineral content.
If vegetables are badly wilted, the crispness may be
partially restored before cooking by soaking them a few
minutes in cold water. This restores most of the lost
moisture. In addition, be sure to first place a small
quantity of water in the bottom of the cooker oefore
cooking fresh vegetables. The amount of water neces-
sary is given in each recipe. Then place the rack over
the water and set the vegetables on the rack. Seasoning
may be added before or after cooking.
More than one vegetable may be cooked at the same
time in the cooker and each will retain its distinctive
flavour and colour. It is important when cooking more
than one vegetable that all vegetables selected have the
same cooking time. Check this carefully when planning
menus which include vegetables.
Remember that older, over-sized vegetables take longer
to cook than fresher, medium-sized vegetables.
DRIED VEGETABLES
No longer is it necessary to cook dried vegetables for
hours. With this cooker, dried or dehydrated vege-
tables may be prepared in a matter of minutes. When-
ever possible, dried vegetables should be soaked over
night, but if necessary, they may be cooked after a few
hours’ soaking.
In cooking dried vegetables, place in the cooker and
thoroughly cover with water. In most instances, you
will find that dried vegetables will regain almost their
original shape, freshness and colour, prepared in this
new way. AVith dried foods, do not fill cooker more
than half full as these foods expand.

MEAT RECIPES
Meats play such an important part in the everyday diet
that it is of vital and foremost importance in the plan-
ning of the day’s menu. This cooker is so excellently
suited for cooking meat that the housewife should plan
to use it daily. Tough meats, otherwise considered
undesirable from the standpoint of palatability, yet
inexpensive, can be cooked to perfection.
Many factors help to determine the length of cooking
time for meats. It depends on the amount and distri-
bution of fat on the Cone, toughness, size and thickness
cf cut and the manner in which the meat fits into the
cooker. Rolled roasts require a longer cooking time per
pound than roasts with the bone in them. Short,
chunky roasts take longer to cook than long flat roasts.
Because of the difference in thickness, a small, thick
roast requires a longer cooking time per pound than a
heavier, flat roast. Consequently, it is possible to give
only general rules for required cooking time of meats.
Average times are about 8 to 10 minutes per pound
for underdone meat and, at least 12 to 15. minutes per
pound for well-done meat. Pork should always be
cooked until well-done.
For best results in cooking fresh meats, heat your cooker
well before adding the fat (any kind of cooking fat may
be used . . . about a tablespoonful is required), needed
for browning the meat. Sear meat well on all sides.
Add water or liquid as directed. Meats to be cooked
without rack unless recipe calls for it. Place the cover
on the cooker. If the cover does not lock on the
cooker easily, leave it in position on the cooker for a
minute or two and it will then lock on without diffi-
culty. This is due to the expansion of the metal from
the heat.
Cured meats, such as tongue and corned beef require
more water than fresh meats, at least two cups of water
should be used. These meats are cooked with the
lean side down and in the water.


Remember, there should always (be water or some liquid
or juice in the bottom of the cooker to form the neces-
sary steam.
If additional crispness is desired in the meat, it may be
placed under the regular broiler of the stove for a few
minutes after cooking.

FISH RECIPES
There’s an abundance of food value in fish and sea food.
And theres’s a wealth of fine flavour too . . . espec-
ially when they are prepared in your cooker.
Whether your preference is for the hard-shelled sea foods
from the depths of the ocean or for tender pan fish from
a. fresh water stream or lake, you will discover a new
and improved flavour by using your cooker in their
preparation.
Two methods of cooking fish are suggested. In the
one, the fish is wrapped in clean cheesecloth before
cooking. This guards against the fish falling apart.
Or if a brown crustiness is preferred, the fish may be
seared in hot fat in the bottom of the cooker before
cooking. In this method, the fish is rolled in flour, corn
meal, or fish fry and seared in, the bottom of the cooker,
then cooked for the time specified.
As for shell sea foods, the cooker offers an ideal method
of thorough steaming to bring out the
finest
of flavours.

DESSERT RECIPES
<r •
Any meal takes on a more festive air with a delightful
dessert. And. during the meal, steamed breads give
an added touch which brings out the best in other foods.
Your cooker is an ideal steamer inasmuch as the heat
attained is constant, a uniform texture is produced in
cooked foods.
Any mould which will fit in the cooker may be used
in preparing breads and desserts. In the event a
mould without a cover is used, and this type is recom-
mended, wax paper or parchment paper should be tied
or fastened over the top of the container. Moulds
should be filled only 2/3 full, to allow for the rising
of the food. If covered mould is used, there must be
small holes in cover to release steam.
In cooking foods that must be steamed more water
must be placed in the cooker because considerable evap-
oration takes place. Desserts or breads which require
up to 20 minutes steaming should be cooked with at
least 5 cups of water in the cooker, while foods which
take longer steaming require more water.

FRUITS
There was a time when fruits were included in the
menus principally to give colour and variety. They have
long been considered an “extra food rather than a
substantial part of the diet.
Modern science has proven that fruits supply a great
many vitamins and minerals and are absolutely neces-
sary to a well-rounded and nutritious diet. So, no
longer are fruits just an added delicacy, they are a
mighty important part of our daily menus.
Cooked fruits are easy to prepare —they are delicious
and they are decorative. The recipes given here are
suggested as tasty desserts or sauces, or they may be
cooled and the fruit used later in salads or
garnishes for other dishes.
