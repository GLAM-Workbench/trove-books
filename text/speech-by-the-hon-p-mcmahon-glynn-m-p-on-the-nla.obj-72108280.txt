SPEECH
THE HON. F. McMAHON GLYNN, H.F..
ON THE
LAND TAX ASSESSMENT BILL
\From the ? Parliamentary Debates ,? 30t/i and 2> Ist August, 1910.J
joz 1 // August , /p/o. two. The honorable member mentioned
Mr GLYNN (Angas) [9.21].?1 reraem- that I had said the other day that the basis
, ? . j X J ot this Bill was taxation of freeholders, and
ber having read how that ?
As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
After a well-grac?d actor leaves the stage,
Are idly bent on him that enters next,
Thinking his prattle to be tedious.
So that one can understand that it is with
a certain feeling of trepidation that I at-
tempt to follow, at this hour of the night,
one who is remarkable for his elusiveness,
if not versatility, in debate, and who
sometimes may instruct, often astounds,
seldom convinces, but can always retain the
attention of the audience by amusing them.
I do not propose to follow the honorable
member in all his somewhat extended dis-
cursions; and, as a considerable number
were irrelevant, perhaps it may conduce on
my part to conciseness in reply if I do not.
One ought not to speak of any one who has
preceded him as having been irrelevant,
without offering some proof of the allega-
tion. I shall give honorable members only
F. 12781.
he immediately raised a cheer by passing
on to say that its true basis was the taxa-
tion of monopolies, and its object the put-
ting an end to monopolies. I never for
one moment dealt with the policy of the
Bill in saying that it was based, as a matter
of technical drafting, upon the freeholder.
I did it merely to elucidate the point that,
so far as the Attorney-General assumed, as
he did, that under this Bill he was taxing
Crown lessees, he was mistaken, because
the primary source of taxation is the free-
holder, and the secondary all those who de-
rive from the freeholder. As the Crown
cannot be a freeholder, notwithstanding that
the Attorney-General thinks the contrary,
there is absolutely no relevancy either in
his references to what I said upon that
point the other day, or in his arguments,
if they are arguments, on the point to-day,
by reference to some clauses in the Bill.


Mr. W. H. Irvine. ?Did the Attorney- gory prescribed by the Constitution within
General say the Crown was a freeholder?
Mr. GLYNN.?He referred to the fact
that I had called this a Bill to tax
freeholders. The point of my reference
was that it cannot' tax Crown lessees, be-
cause the basic declaration is that it is a
tax upon the freeholder, and as the lessees
are only taxed where take from free-
holders, the Attorney-General is wrong,
because the Crown is not a freeholder.
Honorable members will see the irrelevancy
of his reference to my remarks about the
freeholders, and of the arguments with
which he seeks to buttress up an opinion
that he still holds, that Crown lessees are
touched under the Bill. He mentioned
that, under clause 26 of the Bill, certain
lessees are touched, but said that Crown
lessees are touched under clauses 24 and
25. As a matter of fact, under clauses 24
and 25, it is still the freehold estate that
is talked of. If I understand anything at
all about our law, even in our land
tenure Acts, we declare, not that there
are allodial owners, but that there are
feudal owners. The feudal proprietor-
ship is the tenancy in fee-simple; and under
this Bill, we have the freeholder as the
proprietor for the purpose of the tax. The
freeholder cannot be the Crown, because he
is, in feudal theory, one who holds under
what was formerly called free services, not
by virtue of a base fee, but by the higher
fee under the Crown. He held under the
Crown to yield certain services of a high
character; and, as such, being free ser-
vices, they were called the services of the
freeholder. The Attorney-General was
not only irrelevant, but, I submit, wrong
in his reasoning on the terms of his own
Bill. What are we to say of his so-
called elucidation of its terms, if he sticks
to such palpable fallacies ?palpable to
any one capable as a lawyer of di-
gesting those terms ? The Attorney-
General seemed to think to-night that the
power sanctions the remedy?that all you
have to find out is that you have the power,
and the measure of the remedy rests with
yourself. Thus, if a man is guilty of im-
porting a pin against the ad valorem con-
ditions of the Tariff, we can, according
to the Attorney-General, prescribe as a
remedy that he shall be shot. I should
like to know what the High Court would
have to say to that. He submits that argu-
ment, in face of the decision in McCulloch
v. Maryland , that, although we can select
the remedy or the method, there is a cate-
which our selection must be kept; and that
we can only select from such means or
remedies as are necessary and appropriate
?the terms of the American Constitution,
similar to, though not identical with, ours.
Those terms being elucidated by the
American Courts, have been adopted here
as meaning conducive and plainly ancil-
lary to the end, and not going be-
yond the necessities of the case. What
are we to say to these forfeiture clauses,
the worth of which has been dis-
counted to-night by the amendments that
have been foreshadowed, when we find that
the South Australian Act. which has been
found effective, has no provision for for-
feiture, or even for compulsory purchase?
Yet, the Attorney-General of the Common
wealth tells us that, although the tax Is
not evaded in South Australia under the
ordinary provisions, which ought to apply,
and which are proportionate to the neces-
sity, the Government can put in a remedy
of this sort; so that, for the slightest
error which is held to be wilful, a man?s
whole property in land held from the State
may be forfeited to the Commonwealth and
on such terms as to compensation as are
deemed reasonable transferred to the State.
Notwithstanding the apparent cocksure
ness of the Law Department upon the point
of the constitutionality of the clause, it is
discounted to-night by the fact that an
amendment has been foreshadowed, to
render first the remedy optional?because
they do not want to back down altogether
and say it does not exist ?-and secondly, to
transfer the power from the Governor-
General to the Judge. It was a most
extraordinary judicial proceeding to arm the
Governor-General with power to declare a
forfeiture, although not declared by the
Court; but now it is only where the judge
declares the forfeiture that a proclamation
by the Governor-General, as a matter of
machinery, can issue. The Attorney-
General talked about people shaking their
heads. I generally try to restrain myself
when a speaker is preceding me, and to
put my views afterwards instead of inter-
rupting him; but, sometimes, like every
politician, I sin. I did not interject to-
night when the Attorney-General spoke, but
I was obliged to shake my head ; and he re-
ferred to the fact afterwards in that
parabolic peroration of his, the sweep
of which I could not follow, although
it may have been all right. It was
a perfect parabola, with no apparent


centre of interest in it, and of wide posing the measure, because he has de-
extension, like the orbits of those comets
whose eccentricities we are aware of,
and I certainly could not follow the
orbit throughout its diverting course.
I recognise the ability of the Attorney-
General, and to some extent admit his sin-
cerity, for we all, as politicians, have
sometimes to play to the gallery, none of
us being absolutely free from original poli-
tical sin. He said that the trial for
the purposes of sequestration or for-
feiture must be before a jury. I doubt
it. There is nothing to that effect in
the Bill. Perhaps he had in his mind the
constitutional requirement that indictable
offences must be tried before a jury. This
is not an indictable offence, though in some
cases it may be, not by virtue of the pro-
visions of the Bill or the Constitution, but
because the Judiciary Act leaves certain
offences to be tried by the laws of the
States, and, in some instances, where an
information has been laid, the trial will be
before a jury. Let me preface my remarks
on the main issue with a few observations
as to the criticisms of the Attorney-General
upon the speech of the honorable member
for Ballarat. The Attorney-General began
with a point which he thought so self-
evident as not to require buttressing with
reasons. He said that the amendment
could be applied to any land tax. Assum-
ing that there is only one Species of land
tax, there may be truth in that. The state-
ment reminded me of that of the prisoner
who pleaded, by way of answer to an in-
dictment, that, on a similar allegation, any
man guilty of geographical exploration in
strange pockets might be tried for larceny.
No doubt it is true that you might apply
the same amendment to any class of legisla-
tion possessing what the honorable member
for Ballarat showed to be the peculiarities
of this. Before proceeding by quota-
tions from former speeches to dis-
count the excellent speech of the hon-
orable member for Ballarat, the Attor-
ney-General admitted that- the Bill is
a measure to put an end to land monopoly,
though to avoid the declaration of the High
Court that it is unconstitutional it is based
on taxation. With an emphasis which al-
most shook my convictions on certain
points, he said that the Commonwealth is
in the grip of land monopoly. At once
we saw the object of the Bill. He passed
on to refer to the fact that the honorable
member for Ballarat is inconsistent in op-
clared in favour of the principle of land
taxation generally, and of a particular kind
of land tax, both as a member of the
Federal Parliament and as a member of the
Victorian Parliament. As regards the
meaning of an expression, lawyers will tell
you that everything depends upon the con-
text, and, one may add, the occasion on
which it was used. In the quotation from
the speech delivered by the honorable mem-
ber for Ballarat on Bth June, 1906, the
words ? when legitimate occasion arises ?
occur, though they were not emphasized
when quoted.
Mr. West. ? That seems like a quibble.
Mr. GLYNN.?It is not for us to put
all our powers into use at once, but to
exercise them when legitimate occasion
arises.
Mr. Thomas.? What is a legitimate
occasion is a matter of opinion.
Mr. GLYNN.?Yesj and will depend
upon the merits of each proposal.
Mr. Parker Moloney.? That is how the
State Parliaments have shuffled out of land
taxation.
Mr. GLYNN.?I shall not shuffle, and
I do not think that the honorable member
for Ballarat has done so. Although I
differ from my honorable friends as to
method, I share their aspirations, and be-
fore some of them had passed the peram-
bulator stage I had written a pamph-
let on the question of land taxa-
tion, and from the principles laid down
in it I do not depart one iota. The
honorable member for Ballarat was also
quoted as having said that there may be
twelve or thirteen different taxes. What
was the point of that observation? That
the citizens of Australia may determine
whether there shall be twelve or thirteen
different taxes. He was speaking of the
exercise of power sanctioned by the popular
voice. The people are the masters of the
situation. When their approval of a policy
is clear, honorable members have to give
effect to it. But to emphasize a point one
selects an extreme case. John Stuart Mill
says that principles are best tested by ex-
treme cases. I understood the honorable
member for Ballarat to say that when the
popular mandate has been given the
constitutional power exists, and the ex-
pediency may arise when the financial
necessities of the Commonwealth require its
use, that is, when the Customs revenue is in-
adequate. The speech was made in 1909,


before the arrangement with the States of should have been, say, 500 per cent., as
a grant for ten years, which may be can-
celled by an Act of this Parliament. That
arrangement adds this year to our revenue
something like more than was
thought possible two years ago. The hon-
orable member for Ballarat spoke while the
Eraddon section had effect, and the propor-
tions in which the total revenue would be
divided were uncertain, and when it was
thought that the revenue for the year would
not reach within about of the
revenue obtained last year. We cannot
divorce the text from the occasion on which
the speech was made. The Attorney-
General commenced and ended with the
suggestion that we are endeavouring to im-
pugn the constitutionality of the Bill. I
entertain no strong doubts regarding the
constitutionality of the main provisions of
the measure, although I believe it to be
an abuse of our constitutional power of
taxation. The Attorney-General ridiculed
the distinction of the honorable member for
Ballarat between a constitutional and a
legal power. What is understood in England
by a constitutional power is a power that
is absolute and real, but which expediency
does not permit to be used ? The preroga-
tives of the Crown are absolute, but they
are restrained by custom. Technically, the
Crown could do many things which would
limit popular liberty, but constitutionally
it could not. To prevent misapprehension,
the honorable member for Ballarat drew a
distinction between constitutionality and
legality, and said that, while he thought
that constitutionally we could not do this,
he considered that we might, possibly, do
it legally. The references by the Attorney-
General to the steel-rails case were not suffi-
cient! v apposite to any point in dispute for
me to spend time in dealing with them.
There was a reference to the people?s ver-
dict, which was challenged, and to the un-
earned increment of Melbourne properties.
I said at the beginning that certain state-
ments made by the honorable gentleman,
though clever ?and T yield to none in my
respect for his ability and versatility?were
irrelevant. In opposition to the state-
ment that, by reason of the bringing
forward of this measure land values
have decreased, what was the use of
showing that thirty or forty years ago there
was a certain value on the property, and
that recently it had been sold at an in-
crease. According to that logic, although
the rate of increase on the origins', value
long as an increase of 1 per cent, can
be shown, the answer is' complete. That
is the Attorney-General?s position. For
at least an hour he advanced argu-
ments of this class, which sometimes
elicited a faint and I do honorable
members the credit of saying that, at times,
it was only a faint?cheer from his party.
I shall not say more by way of immediate
reply to what has been said by the Attor-
ney-General, in relation to the speech of
the honorable member for Ballarat, but
shall come to the Bill itself. I shall re-
spect what is expected of one in speaking
to a motion for the second reading of a
Bill; but it may be necessary for me to
refer to one or two clauses of the Bill, in
order to elucidate certain points. There
are two points which at once strike one in
connexion with this measure. One is that
its remedial provisions?those intended to
make the collection of the tax effective ?
seem to disregard every consideration ex-
cept the receipt by the Commissioner of the
very last penny of the tax. The other is
that as regards the question of policy we
have brought home to us, for the first time
since the inauguration of the Common-
wealth, the effect, in operation, of the ap-
plication to the same subject-matter of two
similar, but independent and cumulative,
powers of taxation. As to the machinery
I shall be very brief. Any one honestly
examining this Bill, must see that it fairly
bristles with penalties, presumptions, and
forfeitures. It assumes that every land-
holder must naturally and wilfully deceive
as to the actual value of his land, and that
the Commissioner to be appointed will be
hopelessly at his mercy, unable himself
to make, with any approximation to accu-
racy, or to check when made by the owner,
a valuation for the purposes of the tax.
Let us see whether that is justified. There
is a provision in clause 14 and clause 16
that the taxpayer must send in a return
including a full and complete statement of
the improved and unimproved value of
every parcel of land held by him, together
with certain other particulars that are set
out. As honorable members have gathered
from the Attorney-General?s speech, there
are also provisions at the end of the Bill,
one in clause 44 and the other in clause 47,
for compulsory purchase and forfeiture.
Those provisions are, as I think has been
shown, particularly drastic. Under clause
44 compulsory purchase is to take place,


not if it is shown that there is a wilful have been in the meantime a serious altera-
deception, but unless the Justice is con-
vinced that there has not been wilful de-
ception. There is a vast difference be-
tween forcing a person, before a declara-
tion that compulsory purchase is to take
place, to prove that there has not been wil-
ful deception on the part of the valuer,
and assuming that there has been, because
the Justice feels that its existence has not
been disproved, although not shown. That
is a provision of the Bill which indicates the
sinister character of its drafting. Is this
penalty at all proportionate to the risk?
Let me refer to experience in South Aus-
tralia ?not because that happens to be the
State of which I am a representative, for
we ought to take national views and
national experience for our guides here ?
but because since 1884 we have had, in
South Australia a tax on the unimproved
value of land. For years it was not pro-
gressive, and, therefore, as I shall be able
to show, it was economically sound. It has
been made slightly progressive of late.
Mr. Richard Foster. ?Since 1893.
Mr. GLYNN.?That is so, and the fact
that it has been made slightly progressive
helps me to form an estimate or two as to
the possibilities of revenue under this mea-
sure. The first point I wish to make is that
in South Australia very big mistakes have
been made, not only by taxpayers in their
returns, but, according to the Court of Ap-
peal, by the Commissioner of Taxes, in the
assessments under the State Act. That
being so, we ought to see that a fair open-
ing for honest error is allowed in this Bill,
and that there is no necessity for these
penal provisions. Without attempting to
argue the matter closely, I shall give a few
figures in proof of my assertion. In 1885,
the unimproved valuation in South Aus-
tralia was �49,746,000. On appeal that
assessment by the Department was reduced
by �4,976,406. According to the Court,
therefore, an error amounting to over 10 per
cent, was made. That would be a sufficient
presumption, under this Bill, at least, to
bring about proceedings for .compulsory pur-
chase ; but not sufficient for the frirnd facie
assumption that the man who made it was a
swindler. There must be a mistake
amounting to at least 25 per cent, to war-
rant the latter assumption, and that as-
sumption would exist in many cases where,
in South Australia, an honest error had
been made. Three years later there was
another valuation, and there ought not to
tion in values. There may be errors in
new estimates, but not a serious difference
in land values. In 1888, however, the
assessment made by the Commissioner was
�32,828,568. That is a fairly large drop
from in 1884.
Mr. Richard Foster. ?But at the time
of the second assessment there was a severe
drought in existence.
Mr. GLYNN.?As a matter of fact, the
drought commenced about 1883. It was
in existence even at the time of the first
valuation.
Mr. Richard Foster. ?But the years
1887-8 were very bad ones.
Mr. GLYNN.?Yes. There had been
a cumulation of deficits, over five years,
to the tune of �1,100,000. In 1882 the
Treasurer of South Australia had a surplus
of �52,000, if I remember rightly, and
five years afterwards, owing to drought and
other causes, he had an accumulated deficit
of about �1,200,000. That brings us to the
year 1887, and two years later there was
a recurrence of good seasons. The point
that I wished to make when interrupted
was that the drop from �49,746,392 in
1884, to �32,828,568 m 1888, was a very
considerable one, and that, on appeal, in-
stead of there being a proportionate reduc-
tion, the reduction actually made amounted
to only �572,164. In 1894, after there
had been an intervention of two or three
good seasons, the Commissioners? assess-
ment, instead of going up, had again to
go down. His valuation for that year was
�29,370,652, and even that, on appeal,
was reduced by the Court to the extent of
�2,209,568. In 1905, the Commissioners?'
valuation was ,�34*313,270, and that was
reduced, on appeal, by .�873,804. I can-
not give the figures for this year, because
there has been no appeal as yet. I got
an assessment yesterday in order to ascer-
tain the probable leakage under the �5,000
exemption.
Mr. Poynton. ?lt will be 50 per cent,
higher this time.
Mr. GLYNN.?I think the xst January,
1910, is the date of the valuation, but, if
so, the leakage is not quite so high as hon-
orable members think. However, I do
not desire to be taken away from my line
of argument. I mention this matter for
the purpose of making some estimate of
the leakage under the �5,000 exemption,
showing how foolish the Bill is from the
taxation point of view.


Mr. Anstey. ?ln thirty years? experi- shown that every one absent in England is
ence, there has not been a variation of 10
per cent.
Mr. GLYNN.?Then why these drastic
provisions ? Why assume a man is dis-
honest unless he shows the contrary?
Mr. Fenton. ?This does not touch the
honest man.
Mr. GLYNN.?A man is liable to have
his property forfeited under the Bill if
he wilfully makes an error of J per cent.
There is no margin. What will the
ordinary taxpayer do under the circum-
stances ? He will seek to be on the
safe side, and, in cases by over-valua-
tion rob himself for fear injustice may
be done through the Court. And what
does the report show was possible in
Australia when the returns were made on
this principle on the first occasion? The
first report of the Commissioner in 1885
pointed out the difficulty of making an
accurate return, and stated that no assess-
ment, formed on accepted returns, could
have been made. I think that system
was afterwards abolished. The extra-
ordinary thing is that the case of the city
of Adelaide shows what big mistakes may
be made even by jpembers of Parliament,
whose honesty is beyond all doubt. The
valuation of the city of Adelaide was more
than one-third less than the latest parlia-
mentary estimate showed; in other words,
the valuation was 33 per cent. out. Yet
under this Bill, if a man makes a mis-
take of 25 per cent., he is to be frimd facie
presumed to be a swindler and a criminal,
and his estate is to be liable to be forfeited.
Sir John Forrest. ? Is a law like that
to be found anyw'here else in the world ?
Mr. GLYNN.?I do not know. Then
according to the Bill an absentee is not
merely, as the Attorney-General said, one
who has been out of the country six
months before the date of valuation, but
is one who is alleged to be absent from the
Commonwealth on the date on which the as-
sessment is made, unless he can prove the
contrary. In South Australia we started
by declaring that a man was an absentee
only if he had been not less than tw r o
years out of the country, but that was
thought too long a period, and it was sub-
sequently reduced to not less than twelve
months. The relevancy of this reference
is that in the case of companies under the
Bill every shareholder who is aw r ay is
an absentee, so that it will not be easy to
show that two-fifths of the shareholders are
not out of the country; it will have to be
not an absentee within the meaning of the
Bill; in other words, there will be a sort of
cumulative proof through the individuals.
But the point as regards absentees is that
under the South Australian Act in the case
of companies, with certain exceptions in
favour of mutual companies or companies
whose funds are disposed of for charitable
purposes within South Australia, the de-
termining point is three-fifths of the share-
holders, and the others are entitled to ex-
emption if they reside here. Neither in
the case of the Australian Notes Bill nor
this Bill have I sought any information
from any financial institution, but I have
heard it stated in the train that some of
the banking companies, who have sent
in dividends abroad, pay
a year in local salaries besides
other local outlays. These banks are bene-
ficial local instrumentalities to a very large
extent, seeing that they diffuse employment
and bring capital from abroad. I have never
shared the heresy that capital is neces-
sary to development, because I believe
that human labour applied to land will
create any capital. There was no capital
in the beginning, and capital is only created
by labour applied to land. But as we
are anxious to keep up with modern de-
velopment, we must anticipate or expedite
our development by borrowing judiciously
for a while. When it is not judicious to
borrow?, I would stop; and I think that
the States went beyond the limit of judi-
cious borrowing; and hence in this House,
up to the present whenever I have voted,
as a private member, at all events, I have
voted against borrowing.
Mr. Boynton. ?As a private member !
Mr. GLYNN.- ?I did vote against bor-
rowing, and otherwise, when a Min-
ister, I only acted under the compul-
sion of what seemed to be inevitable
necessity, which does not appear to
exist now. But by our borrowing policy
we ask these companies to come here. We
solicit their capital for investment, and
by our Tariff we ask them to come within
the ring fence of our protection, and estab-
lish' branches, as witness the case of
Nestles, Bell and Company, and others.
But the moment they come out, we, under
another Bill, if two-fifths of their share-
holders happen to be abroad, declare them
to be absentees, and penalize them for
adopting a policy which, under some other
of our measures, we hold to be of ad-
vantage to the Commonwealth. Ido not


believe that we have as yet received a I must say I did not quite understand the
single reliable statistical statement showing
the effect of the Bill. During the last
elections I heard statements to the effect
that on or in-
vested here the dividends went Home, but
we must not forget that, in any case, about
is represented by the interest
on our public stocks. I wrote to the
Department asking whether it was cor-
rect, as said by some candidates,
that official returns showed a certain
state of absenteeism, and the answer I
received from our Statistician was that
there were no such returns available for
the Commonwealth, but only in the case
of the South Australian Department, which
showed that out of a total of .�33,439,465
worth of unimproved land, only
�2,728,754 worth was held by absentees.
I believe that a tenth represents South
Australia?s proportion, so that if we
multiply that latter figure by, say, twelve,
we shall get approximately the total,
which the Attorney-General set down to-
night at �700,000,000, though I do not
know whether he meant the unimproved
values of properties held by the big men.
We are making, perhaps, too great a
noise about absenteeism in the Common-
wealth. My own opinion is that a fair
land tax could put a stop to that ab-
senteeism without any revolution, and on
a fair economic basis, to which I shall
refer later on. Absenteeism in South Aus-
tralia is declining under the effect of such
a tax, and a lighter tax than that which
was advocated in the Victorian Parliament
in 1893 by the honorable member for
Ballarat. The point is that a lighter
tax, according to the Commissioner of
Taxes in South Australia, has, especially
since 1894, when it w r as slightly increased,
brought about a considerable diminution
in absenteeism. So far as regards a few
preliminary references to the Bill; and,
now T , may I ask what is the object of the
measure? Is it taxation or land settle-
ment ?
Mr. West.? Both.
Mr. GLYNN.?I shall try both. I shall
examine it first from one point of view and
then from the other. I share a good many
of the aspirations so honestly held by hon-
orable members opposite, but I have to
differ from them as to the proper method
of applying principles. I am not a
revolutionist. I am not one of the
gentlemen referred to by the Attorney-
General as in need of a cold douche, though
relevancy of the remarks he made in that
connexion. But they brought to mind a
distinction between revolutionary and
socialistic reform made by Karl Bland.
He wanted to know whether the economic
transformation was to be brought about
by the dreary drizzle of radicalism or
by healthy socialistic effort. Evidently
the revolutionaries or healthy socialistic
reformers are those to whom the At-
torney-General was referring when he
talked about the cold douche. What
I say first of all is that if the object
of the measure is taxation, it should not,
as a matter of economic policy, be pro-
gressive. When you succeed by pro-
gression in accomplishing settlement you
defeat taxation. Therefore, as a matter of
policy, if taxation be the object, we
should not make it progressive, because
we can only succeed to the extent of our
desire by defeating the object of the Bill
itself, which is taxation. Besides, the High
Court will be guided by what is done. It
is not what we say that will influence the
Court. We may have fifty placards on our
Bill, and may declare what we like on the
floor of this House; the Court will not
look at our debates, our placards, or
motives, but will look at what the Bill
accomplishes. They will consider its
effect, its general operation, and if they
find that a necessary result of this tax must
be a change in the prescribed order of
land settlement, and in doing that to de-
feat it for revenue purposes, though they
may not declare the Bill to be unconstitu-
tional, they will hesitate before saying it is
constitutional.
Mr. Fenton. ?The people will declare
it constitutional. The best that could hap-
pen would be for the High Court to rule
it unconstitutional.
Mr. GLYNN. ?I do not say that they
will do so.
Mr. Fenton. ? If they do the people will
reply.
Mr. GLYNN.?The people, of course,
can direct anything they please.
Mr. Webster.? They are beginning to
learn how to direct, too.
Mr. GLYNN. ?I say that we can al-
ways trust the people to act rightly and
iustly so long as thev apprehend correctlv.
I say, as Burke said, though I forget his
exact words, that where an issue is between
the rulers and the people, the assumption
is at least on a par in favour of the people.


When they do wrong it is from error, not our power, or, as the honorable member for
from design, and not through their fault.
But Burke points out that that is not al-
ways the case with legislators.
Mr. Anstey. ?When did the people not
apprehend correctly ?
Mr. GLYNN. ?They did not apprehend
this matter correctly when they dealt with
it on the last occasion. How could they
have done so on a question of degree or
amount as distinguished from land taxa-
tion, when even Mr. Watson in 1906 talked
of a tax commencing at �d., and rising to
qd. in the pound. I think that at Ade-
laide that gentleman made some qualifi-
cation by saying that he could not, of
course, dictate what the Parliament would
do. Ido not think that the present Prime
Minister, at Gympie or anywhere else, in-
dicated the probability or possibility of the
Government proposing a rate beyond qd.,
which was his limit then, and rising up
to 6d., or beyond that. The people never
apprehended at the time that such a pro-
posal would be made. As to the substance
of the Bill, the Court, in The King v.
Barger , decided that?
In determining whether a particular law is or
is not within the power of the Commonwealth
Parliament, regard must be had to its substance
rather than its literary form.
Chief Justice Marshall, in his judgment in
the case McCulloch v. Maryland , says
that a tax for any purpose which would
be within the executive power of the States
would be held to be unconstitutional by the
Supreme Court of America. The drafts-
man of the measure appears to have been
conscious of this, because he, unnecessarily,
and only for the sake of appearance,
dropped the introduction to last year?s
Bill, which showed the hand of the Go-
vernment. He commits this great injustice
when, in connexion with the policy asserted
to-night by the Attorney-General of
putting an end to monopoly?which was
the exordium and peroration of the honor-
able gentleman?s speech?he disregards the
consideration of acreage in connexion with
value. You may have a man with
;�ioo,ooo worth of land, consisting of
25,000 acres, which is presumably agricul-
tural land and ought not to be held in
pasture. Upon that an economic land tax
properly falls. It would effect its sub-
division without a dislocation of society,
and by way of reform, and not revolution.
But for the sake of saving the face of this
Bill a proposal is made which goes beyond
Ballarat has put it, beyond the constitu-
tional right or general expediency of the
exercise of the power, into limits belonging
to the States. The Government have intro-
duced this injustice of taxing a man whose
property, valued at 100,000, may consist
of 200,000 acres, at the same rates as the
man whose property to the same value con-
sists of 25,000 acres, although the first may
be a pioneer on the outskirts of settlement,
holding land that is worth only ss. an acre,
and useful only for pastoral purposes.
Mr. Deakin. ?Who may be putting the
land to its best possible use at present.
Mr. GLYNN.?I say that the drafts-
man was driven to this injustice by the
necessity for saving, or the desire not to
endanger, the constitutionality of the Bill,
and so largely encroached upon the consti-
tutional sphere of the States.
Mr. Hughes. ?Each is taxed according
to value.
Mr. GLYNN. ?My point is that the Go-
vernment divorce the value from the acre-
age. As regards the object of this mea-
sure, I have quoted from Mr. Watson. On
the 24th March, 1906, he said?
It has to be remembered that the motive of
the Federal land tax is not revenue at all.
And the Worker, on the 21st June, 1906,
said?
The object of a graduated land tax is not to
raise revenue; it is frankly penal.
That is honest. This Bill is penal, but is
it honest? That is the question. I say
that progression is opposed to economic
policy. It is not based upon the principle
of equality. All the economists, from
Adam Smith to Ricardo, Mill, and
George, base land taxation on the prin-
ciple of equality, as being one of the means
they suggest to bring about equality of op-
portunity, which should underlie the legis-
lation of any well-regulated State. I say
that if we depart from the principle of pro-
portion in our taxation we are violating,
for an immediate advantage perhaps in
politics ?I shall not say in party warfare ?
a principle that may come against us here-
after when, to secure justice combined with
expediency, we attempt to apply such prin-
ciples. Now what is just? Let me take
one of the greatest writers, one of the most
extreme men from whom perhaps some of
us may differ on the ground that he went
too far, though honestly and according to
his lights. Let me test this by what Henry


George, that great reformer and splendid and you regard the other fellows as
nublic spirit, who, if he had lived would, criminals, even if you do not tax them
public spirit, who, if he had lived would,
through character, perhaps have trans-
formed politics, has said upon the ques-
tion. This measure is a departure from
Henry George?s test. He said ?
With every increase of population the value
of land rises; with every decrease it falls.
That is the principle. This is his conclu-
sion?
The tax falls, then, upon those who receive
from society a peculiar and valuable benefit,
and upon them, in proportion to the benefit they
receive.
The emphasis is on the words ? in propor-
tion.? Those benefits are not progressive.
And if that be so, what, first, is the justi-
fication for the exemption of
Secondly?except in order to display skill
in formulating mathematical puzzles?what
is the justification, in logic or on any other
principle, for running up every �1 with a
proportionate increase of taxation right up
to What grounds have been
urged in favour of it? There is no justi-
fication in economics. It is against the
Georgian principle, which is the strongest
principle upon which honorable members
opposite have relied. All that I can say
is this : If the idea of the � 5,000 exemp-
tion is that that is the ideal holding for
this Commonwealth, and, if that is the ob-
ject at which honorable members opposite
aim, why should they have progression at
all ? Why should they not put the same
tax on every sinner against their rule
to accomplish the result of bringing
about the ideal of holdings,
as being those upon which this country
should be built ? There may, per-
haps, however, be some logical principle
for this proposal. I want to be fair. Per-
haps honorable members opposite have not
conceived this reason themselves; but I
think it was Mr. Prendergast, the Leader
of the Labour party in the State Parlia-
ment who stated ?I have seen this in the
press, and I think the statement was made
in some debate in the Victorian Parliament
?that if a tax were to commence with
the large men, the exemption could
gradually be brought down until, at length,
the men with 50 acres were reached.
Eventually, then, it would be possible to
bring about holdings of about 10 acres each
in this country. If that be the ideal of
honorable members opposite, I can under-
stand this proposal, because, by means of
it, you force out the larger men af once,
forthwith. That may be the assumption
upon which this Bill rests; but there is no
principle in it at all, though there may be
a fine mathematical exercise in connexion
with this principle of progression along the
line of the �i. Let us see, also, from
the Prime Minister?s own speech, whether
we ought to disregard acreage in connexion
with values. He said that the area of the
alienated land in Australia was 99,693,000
acres; that is, leaving leaseholds out of ac-
count. He said, also, that there were
38,699,000 acres in process of alienation.
That gives about 137,000,000 acres. I do
not know how many acres are held under
general culture in this country. Ido not
believe that there are 25,000,000. Is that
because the other lands are agricultural, but
not split up, or because Australia very
largely consists of a splendid coastal fringe,
whilst the rest is either mineral or largely
pastoral country? If that be so, why on
earth should we bring in a system of taxa-
tion that treats alike all lands, absolutely
disregarding their character ? If honor-
able members look at Knibbs? Statistical
Register , they will find that only 1 acre in
193 in all the States is held under general
culture, or a little over 7 5 per cent, of the
total. Those figures alone show the abso-
lute injustice and folly of this Bill, in
bringing about a policy of land subdivision
under the guise of taxation. At this stage,
perhaps, I may ask leave to continue my
observations to-morrow.
Leave granted; debate adjourned
jist August , igio.
Mr. GLYNN (Angas) [10.40].? When
through the courtesy of the House, the
debate was adjourned last night, I had
mentioned that to apply the progressive
principle to taxation is economically un-
sound, and untrue to the intention of the
Government in exempting holdings not ex-
ceeding �5,000 in value; that it is bad
also- because consideration is not given
to area as well as to value, and therefore
serious injustice will be done to a large
class of settlers. The application of the
tax should have been limited to effective
areas ?that is, to land suitable for agri-
culture now held in pastoral occupation.
Such land might properly be subjected to a
land tax. not of a revolutionary character,


but sufficient to bring about subdivision,
and more productive use. The taxation
?of land values is generally sought to be
justified on the ground that the monopoly
which arises from the occupancy of land
by one class is, in its indirect effect, op-
posed to the equality of opportunity upon
which a well-constituted State must be
established. At this stage of our deve-
lopment it is impossible to give the equality
of opportunity at which we aim by adopt-
ing the principle of collective ownership.
Some other means of obtaining for the
State a fair return from its land without
doing injustice to interests created under
the present system must be sought for, and
a fair land tax has been regarded as the
best means of giving the State what is re-
garded as its due. An impost on land
has been described by some writers as not
a tax but the assertion of the public servi-
tude in land, the significance of which I
shall attempt to show a little later. Let
us see what the leading writers on the sub-
ject have said. I shall mention a few
authorities, without quoting extensively
from them, upon the justification and
rationale of land taxation. Adam Smith
states the principle that the rent of Crown
lands constituted for a long time the
greater part of the revenue of the ancient
sovereigns of European States, and points
out that every improvement in the circum-
stances of society tends either directly or
indirectly to raise the real rent of land;
that is, the rent due to the increase
of population, the application of labour,
or the competition of population for land.
He also says that plenty of good land and
liberty to manage their own affairs seem to
be the two great causes of the prosperity
of all new colonies. Coming to Mill and
modern times, to which, as I have said,
the collective principle of ownership is ut-
terly inapplicable, except in States of im-
perfect development or low political or-
ganization-some of which do exist at pre-
sent ?that writer says that the privilege or
monopoly is only defensible as a necessary
evil. Discussing this question, in one of
his greatest works, and recognising the jus-
tice of a land tax, Goethe says that it must
be in a suitable degree?in other words,
that it must not be confiscatory, or imposed
without considering the existing conditions
of society, to the creation of which we have
had every one?s consent through their repre-
sentatives, or the fact that the alleged evils
have grown up under circumstances for
which every class is responsible. So that we
cannot throw ourselves back on the absolute
principle advocated by Henry George and
others, and regard present day society
as one in relation to which we have an
absolutely clean sheet for the purposes
of our legislation. Goethe, in discussing
this matter, says that while the tax is
justified, it must be in a suitable degree,
and the matter of justification seems to be
clinched by Burke, when he says that in a
country of monopoly there can be no
patriotism. I state these propositions be-
cause they undoubtedly ought to appeal to
honorable members on the opposite side of
the House. They also very largely touch
the sympathies, as regards reforms, of a
good many honorable members on this side.
But there are two governing conditions
which ought not to be forgotten; first, that
it must be a tax and not an attempt at
confiscation, and second, that the tax,
as between owners, ought to be propor-
tioned to the privilege. Neither of
these conditions is, I hold, satisfied by
the proposals of the Government. Let us
now see what the departure from principle,
by allowing an exemption of ,�5,000 in
value, means. On this point it is exceed-
ingly difficult to get correct statistics. On
Monday last I put a few questions to some
officers in the South Australian Taxation
Department, and from the answers re-
ceived, I draw the inference that the total
unimproved value of land in that State on
the Ist January, 1910, was ,�35,201,000.
I do not think that that is the valuation
for the next five years, which has to be
made this year, and which, I believe, is
to date from the middle of the year. Pro-
bably it is the corrected valuation wdrich was
made on the last assessments for the pur-
poses of the present tax. Of that, the
unimproved value of land above
in value?there being two grades in the
State ?is ,�11,945,000, so that the ex-
emption of ,�5,000 means the release
from taxation of land to the value
of ,�23,225,000 out of a total of
,�35,201,000. I ask honorable mem-
bers on the other side how can they,
from the point of view of taxation, justify
that sweeping exemption throughout the
Commonwealth ? In other words, what is the
justification for such a class tax as would
place the burden, and necessarily a much
greater burden than otherwise would be
proposed, upon one-third and exempt two-
thirds of the land values right through the
Commonwealth ?


Sir John Quick. ?Is that the valuation acreage.
of freehold land in South Australia?
Mr. GLYNN.?It includes freeholds
and such leaseholds, which are compara-
tively few, as are subject to the tax. In
South Australia, we have Crown lessees
who have the right of purchase and per-
petual lessees, whose land is not subject, as
it ought to be, to revaluation every four-
teen years. The proper system of leasing,
and the one which we advocated right
through in South Australia, was, ? Stop
the sale of Crown lands, lease in per-
petuity on a rent based on the unimproved
value, and assess the rent periodically, ac-
cording to that unimproved value.? But,
unfortunately, even Some of our honorable
friends in the Labour party departed from
that principle. I was importuned quite as
much as they were, to give the right of pur-
chase to perpetual lessees. It is the same
old principle of human selfishness right
through the market, whether its advocates
be Labour men or not. Men who took up
workingmen?s blocks have importuned me in
Adelaide to impress upon the State Govern-
ment the necessity of giving them the right
of purchase. I refused, but the right of pur-
chase, I believe, has been given, and very
early, under the operation of this splendid
system of perpetual leasing,' we departed
from the true principle to be deduced from
the authorities I have mentioned of periodi-
cally assessing the. rent, according to the in-
crease or the diminution of the unimproved
value. Honorable members will see that,
from the point of view of taxation, as well
as equality, a great leakage is involved
in the exemption of �5,000. What must
it mean ? When the necessity of greater
revenue arises in the Commonwealth, it
will mean, if the principle is right, a
great increase of taxation upon lands
over .�5.000 in value. And it will mean,
�f course, the necessity, when a State has
to raise greater revenue, to plant it on land
under that value. So that really this is
not the sop which some persons think it is
to small holders. It is not in the long run
a very effective move, because it is merely
a shelving of the unpopularity of the tax
from this Parliament on to the State Legis-
lature. But there can be found an exemp-
tion which will be quite consistent with the
true theory of taxation, and it is one
which we did urge over twenty years ago
in the State Parliament. If you make
your exemption so that it will loe consis-
tent with the principle of a so-called un-
earned increment, then it ought to be per
You ought to exempt approxi-
mately the amount per acre w r hich was
originally paid to the State, and if you
do that it will mean, not an unfair ad-
vantage, but a great benefit to the agri-
culturist, the man whose land value
is largely represented by the applica-
tion to it of his capital, his la�our,
and his enterprise. It will be a very
great benefit to him. The unearned incre-
ment increases as you go along, until you
get to the very centre of your big cities,
when the exemption will be comparatively
small; your tax under the system I
suggest will fall upon the holder of
practically only the added value. Sup-
pose that your exemption is, say, �2
an acre ?it might be �l, but I suggest
�2 if you want to commence with a pretty
liberal exemption. According to the figures
dtf: the Prime Minister, the sold land
brought to the State Governments
�123,000,000. He stated that the Vic-
torian increase was about five times the
arriount of the value originally, as deter-
mined by the purchase money. If you
take then, five times the value of the land
when sold by the State ?and that was set
down at about �123,000,000 ?we get a
total unimproved value of �615,000,000.
That, if anything, may be under
the estimate, because the Attorney-General
yesterday made a rough estimate of. about
�714,000,000 as being the value of the
lands, the number of whose owners he
stated. Deducting your �2 an acre, that
would mean a deduction of �246,000,000,
and there would remain to be taxed
�370,000,000, which, at a tax of id.,
would yield about �1,451,000. In other
words, it would give the Commonwealth
what the Treasurer says he will get, about
�1,000,000 a year for Federal purposes;
and it would give the States, by an arrange-
ment which could easily be come to with
them, between �500,000 and �600,000,
being the amount, approximately, of their
present receipts from taxation of land.
There is no revolution involved in that.
It is a fair tax; it is not oppres-
sive, it avoids duplication, and it will
tend, as a somewhat similar tax has
tended in South Australia, to the diminu-
tion of large estates, which are purely agri-
cultural, and which are being run for pas-
toral purposes. The Treasurer stated that
the present land taxation in four States
yielded �599,000. He mentioned, I think,
a revenue of �351,000 for four States,
but, the tax being municipal in New South


Wales, the total taxation, whether it is
received by municipalities by permission
of the Government, or by the States, would
be about �600,000. Such a tax as I have
mentioned would practically give the States
what they have at present, and yield us,
without any confiscation or undue pressure,
a revenue such as the Treasurer estimates
from what I consider an unjust method of
taxation. Summed up, such a method
would be economic taxation. It would, as
I said, relieve the agriculturists. It would
get a return from the increased value
in proportion to it, and without con-
fiscation. It would induce subdivision,
and do so without gradually congest-
ing the market, which is a very serious
matter. Now, on that point, let me men-
tion that in about 1858, the British Par-
liament passed what was known as the
Encumbered Estates Court Act, for the
purpose of enabling mortgagees of Irish
land to sell out expeditiously, and give a
parliamentary title. In Ireland there is,
under this legislation, a Court called
the Landed Estates Court. It super-
vises the sale of landed properties,
and gives, on the title being cleared
up, a parliamentary title. The result of
the passing of that measure, and bring-
ing it into force at once throughout the
land, was that estates, whose true value
was twenty-four and twenty-five years? pur-
chase of the rental, were sold for six and
seven years? purchase of the rental. In
other words, men had, in cases, lost from
two-thirds to three-fourths of the true
value of their properties through the sud-
den congestion of the market, by a measure
similar in operation to this one. If you
do force ?and I do not believe that you
can, because men will have to bear this
tax?to the limits of your desire and your
policy, large estates on the market, it
will mean a serious declination in
prices? to an extent which no man could
honestly justify. We must be fair in this
matter. When vou have attained your
ideal of destroying all interest above
�5,000 in value, what then? Are you to
stop then ? Are you to come down, or de-
clare that to be a permanent ideal ? I
merely ask the question.
Mr. Bruce Smith. ? Senator Stewart
said that this was only the thin edge of a
wedge.
Mr. GLYNN.?-I think that that state-
ment was repeated during the last cam-
paign. I believe it is the policy of the
Victorian Labour party to adopt an exemp-
tion of �5OO, but in any case the amount
will come gradually down. I think that the
country is entitled to an express statement
on this point from the Government. If we
recognise their so-called mandate, and in-
dorse their policy, what will be the result
of its attainment ? A subdivision down to
areas worth �5,000. While it is our duty
to criticise according to our lights?l
hope, paying every deference to the mo-
tives which animate honorable members
opposite?some of us have been quite as
liberal on the point of taxation, and the
Federal taxation of land, as have honor-
able members supporting the Government.
When the question of Customs and Ex-
cise was discussed in the Federal Conven-
tion, and some delegates argued that the
Commonwealth should never exercise, while
some thought it should never have, the
power of taxation, I said in Adelaide, and
repeated in Sydney, that, if I thought
that the Commonwealth was never to have
the power of lightening the load of in-
direct taxation by the exercise of the
power of direct taxation, I should advise
the people to vote against the Constitu-
tion. It was understood that this power
should be given to us in reserve?that is
how it is understood in America, as I
shall show from decisions of the Supreme
Court?to be used, as was stated by the
Leader of the Opposition yesterday, when
the decline in the Customs and Excise re-
venue showed the necessity of imposing
a direct tax. At the Sydney sittings of the
Convention, it was thought that a very
liberal margin on the figures we had in
Adelaide would put the new expenditure
of the Commonwealth for many years at
,-�600,000 per annum. That estimate has
been exceeded, but I said then that if our
new expenditure were not to exceed that
amount, then, but for the fact that we were
merely framers of the Constitution, and had
no mandate as to policy from the people, I
should not object to make provision for
that expenditure by a fair land tax
throughout Australia. I said?
I certainly would go in for a direct tax as a
method of meeting the general expenditure in
preference to the system of Customs duties
which so unduly absorbs the earnings of the
people .... The value of the land which
would be taxed would be a perfect barometer of
the state of the industrial and commercial atmo-
sphere. The rise and fall of the wealth of the
State might be accurately gauged by the existing
condition of land values.
1 did not desire to abolish Customs duties,
because in a country like this we could not
do so; but 1 said that when it became a


question of apportioning taxation according
to necessities and earnings, amongst the
community, one had to consider the equity
of some measure of direct taxation, as
against what was very often the grinding
burden of our extreme indirect taxation.
Our aim should be to avoid duplication.
This Bill does not attempt anything of the
kind. On the contrary, it brings about
duplication, two imposts on one owner.
Our aim, further, should be to attain
simplicity. But there is no simplicity
in this measure. It does not provide
for a tax that will be uniform, even
with the South Australian tax, which is a
true tax upon land values; and its framers
have not remembered that what they ought
to propose is taxation, not confiscation.
When Mr. McPherson, the leader of the
Labour party in the South Australian Par-
liament, in 1895, tabled a motion to trans-
fer to direct taxation some of the burden
of indirect taxation upon the necessaries of
life, I supported him; but I pointed out
that we must not confiscate. I urged that
? to nationalize by confiscation all rental
values would be unjust and impolitic.? I
make that quotation, in order to prevent
any misapprehension of the scope of' my
proposals. The conditions, as I have said,
are such as at present involve, at all events,
relative duties. We cannot apply abstract
theories to the taxation of a society in which
millions of money are invested on behalf
of comparatively small men?men who have
only a meagre competence?through the
agency of various institutions. The Aus-
tralian Mutual Provident Society, for in-
stance. which is a verv beneficial institu-
tion, being based upon the mutual prin-
ciple, has something like 70,000 policy-
holders, and an investment of
or on mortgages of land.
Such investments must be recognised in any
scheme of taxation, and if we impose a
destructive land tax, we shall confiscate the
earnings gained by a very deserving class
from investments on land.
Mr. Bruce Smith. ?Even that comes
under the ? fat man ? theory of the La-
bour party.
Mr. GLYNN.?If we were to do that, it
would be, not true reform, but revolution
by legislation. Coming to the operation
of a moderate tax, let me point out that in
South Australia in 1895 the unimproved
land values tax, which, I think, had been
a halfpenny in the jQ I all round, was
raised, and it is now one penny in the
�1 on values over The
Commissioner of Taxes, in a report in
1906, stated that large holders of land
were realizing and disposing of their lands
as opportunities offered. Especially was
this being done by absentee owners, where
they could sell, and were untrammelled
by any trust instructions. Mr. Hall, an-
other land tax expert, as well as
Mr. Spiller, who was then, I think,
Deputy Commissioner of Taxes in South
Australia, also spoke of the effect of
the tax on country holdings. Thus, in
that State a moderate tax such as we sug-
gest has operated to bring about gradually,
and without any dislocation of interests, a
proper system of subdivision. If we could
make some arrangements with the States as
regards land taxation, so as to avoid dup-
lication, and have only one valuation for
all purposes throughout Australia
Sir William Lyne. ?But in New South
Wales, for instance, land in one district
is valued on one basis, and a valuation in
another district is made on a different
basis.
Mr. GLYNN.?The honorable member?s
interjection emphasizes the expediency of
bringing about some degree of uniformity.
It should be an easy matter to arrange with
the States to allow us, with their help, to
make a valuation throughout Australia, and
an arrangement could be arrived at for a
fair uniform tax, based upon that valua-
tion, and apportioned on equitable lines be-
tween the States and the Commonwealth.
If the States did require, for local pur-
poses, to add to that tax they could use
the valuation that had been made by us.
Under this Bill, however, there will be a
valuation for Commonwealth purposes in
South Australia, not to mention the other
States, every year, whilst there will be a
valuation for the purposes of the State
every five years. The valuations will be
made on different dates, and although
aiming at the same result ?the ascertain-
ment of the unimproved value ?they are to
be made in different ways. The South
Australian Act, as compared with this mea-
sure, is simplicity and efficiency itself. I
do not wish to dwell upon this point. I
desire only to endeavour to make a few
suggestions, recognising that it is our duty,
while criticising the Government scheme, to
show in what way our acknowledged neces-
sities can be faced, and fairly met, by some
other method. The Treasurer estimates
that this tax will yield �1, 000,000 per
annum, and it may be that we could charge
the defence expenditure up to that amount


to a tax levied on the lines I have out-
lined. As population increased, the
necessity for defence would increase,
but in like manner the proceeds of
the tax, being based on the unim-
proved value, would also increase. As
population goes ahead, so does the value of
land, and without even an increase of the
rates, we should thus be able to get what
was necessary for the purposes of defence.
I make the suggestion, because honorable
members opposite, in conceiving this tax,
do not seem to me to have gone thoroughly
to the bottom of the question. They did
not really exhaust all the alternatives that
were open ,to them while remaining consis-
tent to their ideas as to desirable reforms.
Why is this Bill cumbered with provisions
for the valuation of the lessee?s interest as
distinguished from that of the freeholder?
We have not only the provisions in the Bill
itself, but a suggestion of other provisions
which have been modified, while some
have been abandoned since the Bill was
introduced. Last night we had another
complex method ?perhaps mathematically
correct, but certainly most complex
from the ordinary point of view of com-
prehension?of assessing the total value
of the land that must be assigned to the
lessee as against the owner of the rever-
sion. In South Australia we disregard
the lessee. In the State Act. as passed in
1884, it was provided?because some pro-
vision must be made for existing leases ?
that?
The burden of the land tax
This is a very simple provision dealing
with the division of the valuation between
the leaseholder and the reversioner?
shall be distributed between the taxpayers in the
relative proportions of the value of their interests
in the land taxed.
That is all that is operative; but in this
Bill we have complex provisions?
And every taxpayer who shall have paid any
land tax shall be entitled to recover from every
other taxpayer in respect of the land tax of the
same land a proper proportion of the amount
paid.
It was provided that as regards existing
lessees the owner of an unexpired term ot
seven years should have to bear his pro-
portion of the tax, but, as regards future
lessees, it was a matter of bargaining be-
tween the landlord and the tenant. With
that we have nothing to do. That has
worked out well, and would be far more
easily comprehended than the elaborate
provisions of this Bill.
Mr. Carr. What about an existing
binding contract for a certain rental ? How
would the burden be shifted?
Mr. GLYNN. ?Provision is made for
that in the South Australian Act.
Mr. Carr. ?For abrogating the burden?
Mr. GLYNN. ?No. It is provided
that where there is an unexpired term of
seven years the lessee has such an interest
that it ought to be taken into account as
between the lessee and the landlord.
Mr. Carr. ?Ought to be?
Mr. GLYNN. ?Well, it is taken into
account, and that provision has worked
out equitably. We do not need, in
the case of future lessees, to pro-
vide for any arrangement as between the
lessee and the landlord. They can be
left to look after themselves. But there
is a provision against shifting the burden
on to the lessee, and the provision of this
Bill on that point also appears in the
South Australian Act. I believe, from
what the Attorney-General has said, that
he intends to abandon his idea of taxing
Crown lessees. I do not know' whether
he meant to convey the impression that he
had not decided whether or not Crown
lessees who have a right of purchase should
be released; but, at all events, from the
point of view of the Government, 'the
principle is a very dangerous one. If per-
severed in it may involve a question
of constitutionality. In referring briefly
to the question of constitutionality, I
should like to mention a principle which
hitherto has been overlooked when the
question of our power to directly tax land
has been considered. Is the tax a true tax,
or is it, as I mentioned before, merely a
servitude which is a part of the ownership
of the land ? If it is a servitude, then
the tax belongs to the party which is en-
titled to the reversion incident to the fee
simple, and here that is the State. It is the
Crown of the State, not the Crown of the
Commonwealth, assuming some of the con-
tinental theories, and some of the theories
that are held in the American States to be
sound, that is entitled to the tax as con-
nected with the reversion. The tax, in
such circumstances, would not be a true
tax, but merely a part of a servitude, or
of a Crown ownership which had never
been parted with, and there would be a
return of part of that ownership to the
Crown under the sanction of an Act of
Parliament. In the United States this


question has been considered. I do not
wish to elaborate it, but it has been held
that in some of the States the State is
entitled to some express charge upon the
rental value. A servitude is defined
under the Justinian laws as certain por-
tions or fragments of the right of owner-
ship separated from the rest and enjoyed
by persons other than the owner himself.
Under the Feudal system, which has
operated under >our land tenure here, it
is enjoyed by the Grown. As a
matter of fact, that servitude was
originally taken by the Crown direct.
When the old Feudal service was abolished
and converted into a money payment, the
money payment, which was called scutage,
or escutage, was levied directly by the
Crown, which was the reversioner or owner
of the rent which had been commuted into
a money payment. Parliament interfered
at about the time of Charles 1., and by an
Act which was passed took over the collec-
tion of that money payment; and that has
been described as the true basis of the
English land tax?which, in 1692, was
commuted into a payment of 4s. in the jQ I
upon the rental value of land. I suggest that
point to the consideration of the Crown Law
Department. Ido not think that it affects
the constitutionality of the proposed tax,
but it is a matter that has been mooted
in America in connexion with the power of
a State to tax land the ownership of which
was vested in the Federal Government. In
the United States, where the lands before
sale were Federal, in the case of Wither-
spoon v. Duncan , reported in 4, Wallace,
page 210, it was decided that ?
The power of a State to tax exists as soon as
the ownership is changed, and this is effected
when the entry is made on the terms and in the
modes allowed by law. Such lands are, under
the laws of the State, properly chargeable with
State taxes from the date of the first entry.
My opinion is that this principle is purely
academic. I do not think that it affects the
constitutionality of the proposed tax; but,
generally, the question has been considered
from the following points of view Is
there, under the Constitution, a rule of uni-
formity that has been broken, or is there
discrimination between States and parts of
States ? Is there a violation of the pro-
visions of section 99 of the Constitution,
which prevents us by our revenue laws from
giving a preference to one State or part
of a State over another State or part of a
State? Or is this under the guise of tax-
ation really a Bill in relation to land settle-
ment ?which brings us back to the dictum
of the High Court in The King v. Barger
that, as laid down by the Chief Justice ?
In determining whether a particular law is or
is not within the power of the Commonwealth
Parliament to enact, regard must be had to its
substance rather than its literal form.
The indirect effect and motive are irre-
levant. 1 here is on the point of uni-
formity no express provision in our
Constitution that a tax must be uniform.
There is a provision as regards discrimi-
nation, which I have mentioned. In the
United States, however, there is a provision
that a tax must be uniform. In the United
States taxation is divided into direct taxes,
duties, imposts, and excise. Thus there
are four classes of taxation. The rule
as regards direct taxation is that it must be
in proportion to population. Then there is
the rule of uniformity. Indirect taxation
must be uniform. The object of the pro-
vision as regards direct taxation being in
proportion to population is to prevent the
power of numbers being unduly oppressive
to accumulated property in particular States.
In the case of Pollock v. The Farmers'
Toan and Trust Company , Chief Justice
Fuller states the principle?
Nothing can be clearer than what the Consti-
tution intended to guard against was the exer-
cise by the general Government of the power of
directly taxing persons and properties within any
State through a majority made from the other
States. It is true that the effect of requiring
direct taxes to be apportioned among the States
in proportion to their population is necessarily
that the amount of taxes on the individual tax-
payer in a State having the taxable subject-mat-
ter to a larger extent in proportion to its popu-
lation than any other State/but this inequality
must be held to have been contemplated and was
manifestly designed to operate to restrain the
exercise of the power of direct taxation to ex-
traordinary emergencies, to prevent attack upon
accumulated property by the mere force of num-
bers.
The Supreme Court held that the law made
provision against confiscation; but really,
as regards basing the tax upon population,
as in the case of a good many imposts, the
rule would work injustice. If, say, an
income tax were declared to be valid, you
would have to apportion the tax on a popu-
lation basis between the States, whose popu-
lations might be such that the wealth of one
State might be by no means as great as
that of another, the result really being
that one State would have to pay about
as much income tax as another. I think
that there is no rule of uniformity here.
We have power to make exceptions. Par-
liament has, undoubtedly, the power to
select a class. It is only restrained in
doing that by the rule that it must not
encroach in its selection of a class upon


the reserve power .of the States. To do
so comes under the other principle that a
tax must be a tax, and not in substance
something else.
Mr. Joseph Cook. ?Does the honor-
able member say that we could impose
?differential telephone rates if we chose?
Mr. GLYNN. ?I think so; but not as
between States or parts of States. Ido not
want to be led off the track by dealing
with that point, but I think we could do
so. There is no rule to say that w r e can-
not differentiate. We can select a class.
Not only can we, according to Cooley,
whose work is the leading authority on the
subject, select a particular class for
taxation, but even we may differentiate
between the members of a class. The
point has really not been decided in
America. I am giving the views of par-
ticular authorities, but the terms of our
Constitution are not identical with those
of the United States Constitution.
Mr. Joseph Cook. ?If that be the true
constitutional doctrine, we could impose
differential postal and telegraphic rates.
Mr. GLYNN. ?I am putting what I
believe to be the correct interpretation of
the Constitution. After some pretty close
study of the competent authorities ?and
there is, under our Constitution, no rule
of uniformity similar to the American
rule ?I say that the American prin-
ciple of uniformity applies to only indi-
rect taxation. The other principle is that
of discrimination between States and parts
of States, and the High Court has held
that ? parts of States? does not neces-
sarily mean parts of different States, but
may mean differentiation between a part
of one State and another part of the same
State. It does not seem to me that there
is anv differentiation necessarily involved
in the tax proposed by this Bill. The
uniformity rule laid down by Mr. Justice
Field, in the United States, was as fol-
lows?
The uniformity thus required is the uniformity
throughout the United States of the duty, im-
post and the Excise levied. That is, the tax
levied cannot be one sum upon an article at one
place and a different sum upon the same article
at another place. The duty received must be the
same at all places throughout the United States
proportioned to the quantity of the article dis-
posed of or the extent of the business done.
In the Colonial Sugar Refining Company?s
case, which was decided by our High
Court, it was held that it was_ not a breach
of the rule against discrimination under our
Constitution to allow an exemption of a
tax paid under a State law as against an
impost levied by the Commonwealth upon
sugar. The company was allowed credit
for sums previously paid under the State
law, and it was held that that could be
done, although the company would gain a
large credit in some States, and in others,
none. That was not a breach of the rule as
regards discrimination contained in the Con-
stitution. The High Court said ?
The rule laid down by the Act is a general
one applicable to all States alike, and the fact
that it operates unequally in several States
arises, not from anything done by Parliament,
but from inequality in the duties imposed by the
States themselves.
The only point that appears to me to ren-
der the matter a little doubtful is this ?is
this in substance land legislation? Upon
that point the High Court will ask ?what
is the necessary effect of it ? Also, is a class
selected, or is it created, for the purpose
of the tax? Is this really a tax that has
been imposed for taxation purposes, or a
tax for another purpose? That considera-
tion may affect the constitutionality of the
measure. But there may be a distinction be-
tween a land tax on a class already found,
and the creation of a special class for the
purposes of a particular taxation Act. I
do not desire to trespass any further upon
the time of the House. The subject is,
however, an important one, and that is
perhaps a justification for entering with
some little detail into matters that might
otherwise have been brought forward in
Committee. I believe, as I have said, in
true reform upon this matter. I do not
believe in confiscation. I believe that we
ought to respect interests that have grown
up under the assumption that they would
not be suddenly disturbed ?interests not
pertaining to one or two persons, or to a
class, but which are diffused among those
who have competencies in Australia, people
of moderate means, represented by such
bodies as the Australian Mutual Brovident
Society and the numerous investment socie-
ties throughout the length and breadth of
the Commonwealth. By adhering to the
power to tax land values without any exemp-
tion, you would be observing the true
principles of political economy to which re-
ference has been made; such taxation would
involve no injustice, while it would create an
inducement ?a compulsory inducement, if
I may put it so?to large land-owners to
subdivide. In that way it would bring
about a reform without any undue oppres-
sion of a particular class.
