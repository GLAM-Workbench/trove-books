FOREWORD
As one who was intimately associated with the 2/4 Australian
Armoured Regimental Group from its inception and previously
with the Reconnaissance and Armoured Car Squadrons that were
amalgamated to form the Regiment in 1942, it has been to me
indeed a pleasure and a privilege to have this opportunity to
add the foreword to the Group’s history and Roll of Honour.
It is with the keenest anticipation that I have awaited the pub-
lication of this document for it is a record of achievement of
which every member of the Regiment and its ancillaries may
rightly be proud.
The story it tells is one of alert and patriotic acceptance of the
responsibilities cast upon us by war; of duty nobly done; of
gallant service rendered—even unto death. In fact, every line
records good service voluntarily rendered. This splendid work,
although I know it has been a labour of love, has been compiled
and edited with immense and continuous care spreading over a
lengthy period of time by a devoted band of willing and en-
thusiastic workers, to all of whom the gratitude of every one of
our comrades is due. It is issued with pride to preserve for
future generations the memory of men who, when the occasion
arose, voluntarily served their country and their regiment in the
greatest emergency.
Upon perusal of this History, it will be readily accepted and
agreed that the Regiment and all those connected with it have
worthily upheld and maintained that proud record of achieve-
ment, traditions and reputation established by their predeces-
sors in the 4th Australian Light Horse Regiment whose original
colours were so proudly worn throughout the campaigns in the
South West Pacific theatre in which the Regiment played its
prominent part. Without any doubt, the picture that is unfolded
reflects the greatest credit upon all members of the Group.
Despite the gloom that may sometimes come to us at hap-
penings in these present times, it is my firm conviction that, so


long as we can produce men of the quality of those whose names
and deeds are enshrined in this history, we can go forward joy-
fully and with every confidence into the unknown future and
may we all be inspired to carry out our present obligations and
duties cheerfully and patriotically and to live henceforth lives
worthy of the shining example of those members of the Regi-
ment who died for us that we, as free members of the great Com-
monwealth of Nations within the Empire, may live.

INTRODUCTION
This History has been written with a two-fold object; firstly,
to place on record the part played by the Regimental Group in
operations in the islands, and, secondly, to revive memories of
the highlights of its existence. Naturally, in a book of this size
it has not been possible to tell the whole story—many incidents
and names have not been recorded—but the following pages give
a faithful account of the main activities of the Unit. We trust
that readers will use their imaginations to fill in the gaps, and
revive for themselves the many little interludes in their army
life that may have been omitted.
The history of the 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt Gp is a story of splen-
did co-operation by all ranks. From the tank crews in the forward
areas right back to the lowliest trooper in the base camps every
man gave of his best in the task allotted to him. The tank crews
naturally shared the dangers and glory, but this was made
possible only by hundreds of men behind them who faithfully
carried out their daily jobs and so helped to keep the tanks
running. Sigs, Field Park and Workshops all played their part
with the result that the combined energies of the Group were
concentrated in making the forward tanks an armoured spear-
head that rivers, jungle, and Japs were unable to stop. The
“Tillies” rumbled on because every man in the Group was a
cog in the organisation that kept them going.
In the sections of this History devoted to operations there has
been a natural tendency to emphasise the part played by the
tanks. But although they did a grand job in difficult conditions
they would have been useless without the infantry, engineers,
artillery and other support troops. Perhaps we have not men-
tioned them sufficiently, but that is only because their magni-
ficent part will be told time and again elsewhere. None of the
tank crews will ever forget their efforts, and we take this oppor-
tunity of “dipping our lids” to them all.
Before leaving Southport Brig. D. Macarthur-Onslow had
instructed the Unit in his own inimitable fashion to “sell”
armour in the islands. That instruction was faithfully carried


out, and had the Jap resistance continued, the demand for
armour in jungle warfare might have exceeded the supply.
Towards the end of the war many infantry commanders had
become enthusiastic about the use of tanks in support of infantry
operations, as it had been proved conclusively that armour had
kept casualties down to a minimum and in addition had a
devastating effect on enemy morale.
The success of the Unit in operations was not achieved without
loss. In actual operations, 10 members were killed in action,
three died of wounds, and 31 wounded in action. In addition,
during the life of the Regt, nine men were accidentally killed,
two died from natural causes and one was posted missing. To
the relatives of deceased members we offer our deepest sympathy.
The task of compiling this history has not been easy, but we
will be amply rewarded if its pages enable our readers to recap-
ture the spirit of the Unit—the spirit of laughter, of steady deter-
mination, of comradeship, co-operation, and cool efficiency which
always seemed to produce the goods at the right moment.
To our old comrades scattered throughout the length and
breadth of the Commonwealth we send greetings. We hope that,
as they turn the pages, our readers will pause occasionally to
live over again in their memories some of the many incidents in
their army careers, to spare a thought for old cobbers, and to
resolve to carry into their civilian lives some of that splendid
spirit of cooperation which characterised the unit of which they
were once members.
Good luck to you all.

CHAPTER I
FORMATION
An air of suppressed excitement pervaded the gathering of
Armoured Division officers in the Narrabri Town Hall on the
beautiful spring morning of Sunday, 18th October 1942. On the
previous day Major-General (now Lieutenant-General) H. C.
H. Robertson had flashed an “about-turn” to his manoeuvring
troops and followed it by a call to conference for Brigade com-
manders and staffs, Unit commanders and adjutants. Obviously
something important was in the wind. With “Red Robbie’s”
aggressive arrival the hubbub of voices was hushed—certainly
The Old Man had nothing joyful to spring. On the contrary,
it was soon evident that he was presiding at the carving up of
his dream child, the First Australian Armoured Division, which
he had hoped to hurl at Rommel in the desert, and which he
had brought to a standard of training and discipline unsur-
passed in the Australian Army. Those present will long remem-
ber the delightful barbs of sarcasm which “Red Robbie” levelled
at certain quarters on that occasion.
During the course of the carving, the General advised that the
First and Second Reconnaissance Squadrons would lose their
identities and, with a squadron of 2/11 Australian Armoured
Car Regt, form the nucleus of a new armoured regiment—2/4
Australian Armoured Regt. The formation of the new unit was
to be the responsibility of 2 Australian Armoured Brigade and
Brigadier Ferguson wasted no time in getting on with the job.
A conference was called at Brigade Headquarters near Wee Waa
the next day, officers present being the Brigadier, the B.M.
(Major Macarthur), C.O. 2/11 Australian Armoured Car Regt
(Lt-Col. Rennick), O.C. 1 Australian Armoured Brigade Recce
Sqn (Major Chas. Lethbridge), O.C. 2 Australian Armoured
Brigade Recce Sqn (Major Ford Grieve), and Adjutant, 1 Aust.
Recce Sqn (Lieut. Mort Maiden). Appointments of adjutant,
Q.M., tech, officer, R.S.M., R.Q.M.S., and orderly room sgt were


discussed, together with arrangements for concentrating the three
squadrons.
This concentration took place at Myall Vale near Wee Waa
and was completed on 4th November, the date on which the
2/4 Australian Armoured Regt was officially established as a
unit. D Sqn 2/11 Australian Armoured Car Regt, under com-
mand of Major John Mackay, became A Sqadron of 2/4 Aus-
tralian Armoured Regt; 2/2 Australian Armoured Brigade
Recce Sqn under command of Major Ford Grieve became B
Squadron; 2/1 Australian Armoured Brigade Recce Sqn under
command of Major Chas. Lethbridge became C Sqn. Lt-Col.
Cameron was appointed Adm. Commander and Major Mackay,
the senior major, was appointed 2 I/C. Capt Mat. Robinson
had the unenviable task of forming a Headquarters squadron
from personnel provided by all three squadrons. Staff appoint-
ments were Captain John Young (Adjutant), Lieutenant Doug.
Green (Quartermaster), Lieutenant Des. Fagan (I.O.) and Lieu-
tenant Dan Truesdale (T. 0.). R.H.Q. Staff (better known as
“The Brains Trust”) consisted of W. O. Jack Thomson (R.S.M.),
S/Sgt George Bartlett, Sergeant John Speare and Sergeant
“Ran” Butler.
Although differing in many unimportant details, the three
squadrons concerned in this regimental nucleus were fired by
the same keenness to come to grips with the enemy, and every-
thing they did was to that end. Each had the same pride in its
own prowess and belief in its own superiority-in fact each con-
sidered itself the best sub-unit of the whole A.1.F.; each regretted
the passing of the reconnaissance life in which the whole North-
West was the training area and regimentation was non-existent.
Thus it was with unwilling grace that the three squadrons were
thrown together as a unit on 4th November 1942. There fol-
lowed a period of initial tank training on the Diesel Grants
inherited from 2/10 Australian Armoured Regiment, instruc-
tors being provided by the other units of 2 Australian Armoured
Brigade. The zest with which the boys attacked the training
was very gratifying to the Commander and somewhat amazing
to the instructors who were loud in their praise of the excellent
types who made up the rank and file of the Unit. Every man
seemingly had determined within his own heart to become
proficient in the new arm in the shortest possible time, for only
proficiency could put him on the boat. It was this determina-
tion and zest for work that eventually put the youngest armoured


regiment on top priority within the Armoured Corps—an
achievement which in itself stands as a tribute to all ranks.
But in November 1942 we were anything but top priority.
Although individually each squadron possessed the qualities
necessary for the welding of a good regimental team, collectively
we were an unhappy assortment resenting the whole set of cir-
cumstances that had brought us together; for who the hell
wanted to be “rotated” in a regiment after enjoying the cama-
raderie and freedom of an independent squadron where discip-
line was largely self-imposed because it was the right thing to
do? This insularity and isolationism constituted the greatest
barrier that lay between us and efficiency as a unit, and the
tank tracks were to clatter over many miles before it was finally
lowered.
Christmas 1942 ushered in happier prospects—we were soon
to be on the move north! Previously the unit had concentrated
a few miles north of Narrabri whence the bulk of the chaps had
enjoyed home leave. For the holding party there had followed
those memorable inter-squadron cricket matches sponsored by
Major Chas. Lethbridge, endearingly known to all ranks as
“Cold Tea Charlie”, a sobriquet he had earned himself in 1
Recce Sqn when on div. exercises—he never halted in one place
long enough for the boys to boil up; a “Middle-Easter”, the
Regiment can boast no finer soldier or man, and on not a few
occasions I have heard men say they’d like to think their sons
would grow up like “Cold Tea Charlie”. Well, with such a
sponsor cricket and other social activities made life a little
happier for that leave-hungry holding party. And then Xmas!
Xmas as provided by the generous people of the North-West.
Their hospitality and friendly nature were already known to us,
for map-making and reconnaissance assuredly require that a
landmark such as a station homestead should be investigated and
marked for future reference! It is fitting that this History should
record something of the gratitude we felt towards these kind
folk who that day opened their homes and their hearts that we
might experience something of the spirit of Xmas.
It was during this period, too, that we received the first boost
to our regimental strength—those fine lads from 7 Motor Regt
which had been disbanded. They were, for the most part, mere
youngsters, just of A.I.F. age, who soon absorbed the spirit of
the squadrons into which they were drafted and became efficient
tankmen, and an acquisition to the Unit. Those who came most


under the public eye were the D/Rs, who, under Dan Trues-
dale’s guidance, formed the basis of what must have been the
best D/R detachment of any regiment—“ Spud” Murphy, Dick
Jones, Claude Newell, Butch Parker, and Rusty Russell, all of
whom could be depended upon to get anywhere under any cir-
cumstances either per M.C. or jeep. Thus, with home leave still
in our thoughts, a good Xmas tucked under our belts and the
boost to our numbers, morale was on the up and up when the
move to Murgon began on 4th January 1943. And what a move!
The road was a quagmire after recent heavy rain and it was
necessary to tow the M.T. with tanks on many occasions. At
Goondiwindi the Regiment entrained for Cooyar where it har-
boured from 11th to 19th January. Meanwhile, two troops under
command of Lieuts. Geoff. Walpole and Mort Maiden had their
first experience of life on a tank transporter—and they HAD it
for a fortnight, during which time the transporters bogged in
the mud, slipped in the gravel, spun in the dust, jibbed on the
pinches and went damned well down hill. Through all this the
tank crews either wiped off mud, dodged the stones, spat out
dust, off-loaded tanks to tow the transporters or dodged over-
hanging limbs. By dint of all this activity, aided by a train trip
from Warwick, we caught up with the Unit at Cooyar the day
before it moved north to Manumbah.
On Bth January Lt-Col. Cameron had marched out to com-
mand the 20 Motor Regiment, leaving John Mackay as Adminis-
trative Commander. Though the Regiment can claim two com-
manding officers, three adjutants, four transport officers, two
intelligence officers, as many R.S.M.s and orderly room staff
sergeants, though each squadron “went through” at least two
O.C.s and 2 I/Cs; yet there remained firm to the last only two
of the original “Big Men”—John Mackay as 2 I/C and Doug
Green as Q.M. With a mania for detail, John was the ideal
2 I/C, to whom a C.O. could safely entrust the implementation
of his policy. In the whole A.I.F. there was not a more loyal
officer, for through his lips there never passed one word of
criticism against his C.O. or his decisions, even though these
decisions were often contrary to his opinion and had to be im-
plemented by him. In his ever-present desire to increase the
efficiency of the Unit, he did not let his sincerity of purpose
falter whether he be “rotating” working parties or commanding
a regimental “attack” at Wasp Creek.
To John Mackay, then, fell the task of commanding the Unit


on the last stage of its move to the new “home” at Manumbah
Creek. Residents of the Cooyar-Murgon Road must have felt a
little more secure against Jap attack as they watched the seem-
ingly endless line of tanks, armoured cars, scout cars and
M.T. that moved north on 20th January—2 Australian Armoured
Brigade on the move in full strength. By nightfall we had har-
boured in the new area—a good test for tanks and men—and
were wondering what the future held for 2/4 Aust. Armd
Regt.


CHAPTER II
MANUMBAH MEANDERINGS
It was a picturesque spot that might well have come straight
from one of Thwaites’ novels; bounded on the north and west
by Manumbah Creek which obligingly curved its clear, shallow
waters into the arc of a rudely drawn semi-circle, and on the
east and south by a gently rising wooded hill, the area seemed
designed by Nature as a dispersed tank harbour. Over its face in
ever diminishing numbers were gaunt but grand old gums whose
gnarled limbs hung menacingly earthward as though in protest
against this mechanised intrusion on their solitude. Such, on
reflection, was our new home, but to tired tank crews the Heysen-
like qualities of a gum-tree go unnoticed—it’s just another
bloody tree; why the hell are we here anyway and for how long?
Little wonder there were derisive bursts of “Beautiful, beautiful
Queensland” in the ears of the QX-ers.
Fortunately there was little time for musing over our fate; A
Squadron received its first consignment of Stuart tanks and with
its usual efficiency proceeded to master the new weapon; with
mixed feelings we transferred our armoured and scout cars to
12 Australian Armd Car Regt. With them went the last bond
with what had been—the roving life of reconnaissance and a
flavour of freedom; there remained—tanks! Yes, we had come to
like them now; there was something reassuring about their cold
strength, and day by day we learned more and more their capa-
bilities and limitations.
On Ist February Lt-Col. Jack Caddy marched in as the Unit’s
first C.O. (Lt-Col. Cameron was Adm. Comd. only). His arrival
gave an immediate boost to morale and was a symbol about
which regimental spirit could now grow, for surely a Com-
mander in his person represents the Regiment very much as
the King in his person represents the Empire; moreover the
Commanding Officer realised that unity was the Regiment’s
greatest need and directed his policy to that end. A Middle-


Easter, who had sailed with 6 Division Cavalry, John was a hard
but just disciplinarian who realised that a unit’s efficiency is
generally judged on matters of detail-dress and behaviour of
troops on leave; vigilance of sentries, tidiness of lines and the
like. He believed that efficiency in small things led to efficiency
in big things. Such was the theme—and, well, we looked smart on
leave, our sentries were always—or almost always—on the job and
we had tidy lines; or else!
Close on the heels of the Commanding Officer came our next
boost in numbers—another promising omen—this time from 6
Australian Armd Brigade which had been disbanded in Victoria.
Unfortunately, among them were N.C.O.s who had to be held
surplus to establishment for many months before finally being
marched out to Reinforcement Depots—another form of unneces-
sary “rotation” practised by the Army. However, apart from the
over-abundance of N.C.O.s the newcomers fitted admirably into
the pattern of the Unit and were soon as much a part of it as the
more seasoned members. Early in March, morale was high for
someone had it on good authority from the third seat on the left
that the Unit was to move. Then all the seats started to spread
their stories—only B Squadron would move, no! C Squadron, or
was it A? Finally, the Commanding Officer’s seat gave its verdict
—all squadrons would move, but only C Squadron and part of
A would take tanks—Yes! that was the “G.G.” Destination? Ah!
no seat would yield up that secret. This was to be a test of
security, and although all sorts of rumours were rife security
remained unbroken until the actual entraining at Murgon when
a junior porter or some such high official deemed it necessary
to show his importance and knowledge; such self-important ver-
bosity must have been a source of great comfort to enemy agents
in this country.
Such was the atmosphere of secrecy and rumour behind the
Unit's move to Toorbul Point for Combined Operational Train-
ing. The organisation of the move itself was an epic in the
annals of the Regiment, but tragedy attended it, for during the
process one of our trains was derailed on the night of 12th-13th
March, near Kilkivan. Casualties in personnel were:
Killed: Trooper Nankervis W. B.
Injured: Cpl. Kinneally K., Troopers Orford J. R., Wil-
liams J. D. and MacDonald G. W.
Casualties in vehicles were 3 tanks Y casualties; a 15 cwt. van
Z casualty; a 3 ton truck, a 30 cwt. truck and two motor cycles,


X casualties. All those who were associated with the smash in
any way agree that it was a miracle that the death roll was not
greater. Here is an account by Major Chas. Lethbridge who was
officer in charge of the train.
“Bound for Caboolture on the Murgon ‘Flyer’ to carry out
combined operational training, the greater part of C Squadron
had actually settled down more or less comfortably, after having
made sure that all tanks were securely lashed down. The squadron
pulled out of Kilkivan at midnight and Major John Mackay
remarked that he didn't like the speed at which the Queens-
land trains hurtled along; this was taken only as another piece
of interstate jealousy but proved something of an omen or a
piece of black magic. The same great onrush was said to have
been observed by a gentleman rejoicing under the name of
‘Dracula’ who was riding in one of the motor transport waggons.
However, these omens or evil words were followed by a loud
crash and by severe joltings and further crashes.
“Investigations revealed an unhappy sight; three of the
precious tanks were upset on the roadway and the following
motor transport waggons had piled up and upset most of their
contents-3 ton trucks with cook houses, mechanics’ gear and
canteen and worst of all, the personnel belonging to these trucks.
It seemed miraculous that out of all this chaos only one life
was lost, two other men were seriously hurt, and many bruised
and shaken. This did not prevent Corporal Mark Young of the
R.A.P. extricating himself in the darkness from the mass of
broken timber and twisted iron and hurrying to give assistance
to the injured men. Nor did it prevent those stalwarts, Joe
Knehr and Jim Hoskin, having a fire alight and the tea dixies
on within half-an-hour of the smash.
“Within a couple of hours all A.D.M.S., ambulances, medical
officers and Div. staffs below latitude 26° had arrived on the
scene—at least that is how it appeared, and many intelligent
questions were asked; the whole mess of trucks, wood, iron, can-
teen stores etc., was soon covered by officials of the most power-
ful type. The first question asked by one enthusiastic A.D.M.S.
was, ‘Have you dug slit-trench latrines?’ We had, of course,
one wit informed him and in addition had laid down a football
field, while hot and cold showers were under construction. With
daylight the Div. workshops demonstrated to an amazed railway
staff how to clear wreckage from a railway track; later in the
day, motor transport arrived and all went forward to Caboolture
as though the past nightmarish twelve hours were part of the


normal routine. QX-ers in stout defence of their State ex-
plained that the Queensland Railways were overworked and that
the accident was only one of the things that happen in war, but
other X-ers contended that it was just the sort of thing one
could expect in a place so remote from Sydney or Melbourne.
The Combined Operations training was an experience new
and enjoyable to all ranks; we became most adept at getting our
tanks on and off L.C.T.; we assumed the agility of the senior
service on ships’ ladders and landing nets; and we could secure
a “beachhead” with the same enthusiasm as the Marine Corps.
But apart from the valuable training received, we enjoyed the
“break”—salt air, a limitless expanse of ocean, oysters and all
that. To end a pleasant fortnight on a note of hilarity the boys
staged a very fine concert, made memorable by Barry Moore
putting over his somewhat doubtful story about a gunner who
became a cook; the crisis in the story came with the pseudo
cook shoving a sausage in the dog’s , slamming the oven door
and saying “No. 1 gun ready, sir”. To Barry’s dismay he noticed
on conclusion that he had a mixed audience—great embarrass-
ment!
Back at Murgon with the surf and sand of Toorbul Point but
a memory, toughening up was the order of the day—and night.
Mile by mile we increased our range; blister by blister, corn by
corn we hardened our feet. But during the process we did not
neglect the tanks—that aspect of our training went ever forward
so that our skill as a tank unit kept pace with our ability to
endure physical hardship. It was during this stage of the Regi-
ment’s history that we played a major part in winning for 3
Australian Armoured Division the Championship Sash at the
Queensland L. of C. Area Swimming Championships at Too-
woomba. Members who competed were Bill Howard, “Jerry”
Visscher, “Slim” Skinner, Alf Cooper, Harry Davenport, Alex
Cameron, Alex Evans and Peter Binnie. Although only a small
team, it was representative of all squadrons and its success helped
to mould the regimental spirit.
Swimming carnivals notwithstanding, the toughening up went
on apace—obviously there was something sinister in the mind of
the Commander for prior to our Combined Operations training
we had tucked under our belts a tough sixty miles in two and
a half days and here we were still “toughening”. Well it was
soon on; an “enemy” force was bearing down on Gympie and
2/4 Aust. Armd Regt was ordered to move directly across the
Manumbah Range and hold a vital crossing north of Gympie


until the rest of the Brigade could arrive. The task necessitated
an all-night march in single file over a rough cattle pad and
was a triumph in physical endurance for the whole unit and
incidentally a triumph in leadership and bushmanship for Chas.
Lethbridge who was Unit Commander for the exercise. Start-
ing at 1800 hours we halted only for ten minutes in each hour
until 0700 hours, when a two hour break brought welcome relief
to blistered feet and aching bodies. With two further halts, each
of an hour’s duration, the Unit bedded down at 1800 hours,
having covered some 43 miles in 24 hours, half that time having
been spent on a rough mountain track in darkness. Besides weary
bodies and blistered feet we had proud hearts and a sense of
achievement—personal achievement and more important, unit
achievement. Truly we earned that day’s leave in Gympie, but
I’m damned if I know why we had to walk there to have it—even
now, I don’t know. Fortunately, the return march was a more
leisurely one extending over two and a half days.
It is worthy of note that during the outward march that fine
old soldier, Brig. M. A. Ferguson, marched with the main
Brigade force throughout the night—a remarkable feat for a man
of his age, carrying severe wounds from both wars. Such acts as
this, coupled with his soldierly bearing and fine war record, won
for “Fergy” the respect of all ranks.


CHAPTER III
BROWNING OFF
At Easter 1943 the Unit moved without reluctance from its dis-
persed harbour to a compact, tented camp nearer Murgon—a
camp known with mixed feelings as “The Hill”. This was the
first time that we had slept other than under the open sky since
we left Singleton and Greta in August 1942. Here we were to
chill with the icy winds of a cold winter and steam with the
relentless rays of a hot summer sun; here we were to “brown
off” to the point of burning; here morale was to sink to its
lowest level; yet here we became a unit; here were forged friend-
ships which only death will break.
Command and staff appointments at this stage of the Unit’s
history were:—C.O., Lt-Col. A. J. Caddy; 2 I/C, Major J.
Mackay; adjutant, Capt. J. E. Young; quartermaster, Lieut. E.
D. B. Green; R.M.0., Capt. K. Krantz; Padre McKinnon and
later Padre Cahill; 1.0., Lieut. J. D. Fagan; T. 0., Lieut. D.
Truesdale; L. 0., Lieut. D. R. Roughton; O.C. Headquarters
Squadron, Capt. M. Robinson; O.C. A Squadron, Capt. F. Suff-
ren; O.C. B Squadron, Major F. Grieve; O.C. C Squadron,
Major C. R. Lethbridge. It is appropriate that this History
should record the “raw deal” which was handed out to many of
the Unit’s officers. By volunteering for service in the reconnais-
sance squadrons many had missed promotion—Jim Allard, Eddie
Durance, Joe Dent, Allan Hellicar, Bill Roughton, Kim
McMaster; and now, due to the insecure position of 3 Armoured
Division on the Australian battle order, these officers and others
could not get promotion commensurate with their appointments
-they were either squadron 2 I/Cs or captains rear link by
appointment and subalterns by rank. Mat Robinson commanded
a squadron from the inception of the Unit, but did not receive
his majority until March 1945. Doug Green was the Unit’s first
and only quartermaster but did not secure his captaincy until
May 1944; Dan Truesdale, tired of waiting for his three pips.


left the Unit to get them elsewhere; Frank Suffren was side-
tracked to Woodside as an instructor, Eddie Durance into Staff
work, and Allan Hellicar into Army Air Co-Op. Jim Allard
and Joe Dent finally received their “three” but Bill Roughton
and Kim McMaster finished the war as subalterns.
This reluctance to promote officers did not help the morale
of the Unit, for the men rightly regarded it as evidence of the
Unit’s low priority. This and other factors too lengthy to men-
tion here quickly convinced all ranks that we were merely a part
of Curtin's tourist army; unit feeling was typified by Tpr Robin-
son’s song, sung to the tune of the “Marines’ Hymn”:
From the hills of small Tasmania,
To the dumps of Kalgoorlie,
We have boozed and bludged in every State,
But we have never crossed the sea.
Taxation for the nation,
Protected still we live,
And we hide behind the title of,
THIRD AUSTRALIAN ARMOURED DIV.
Our tanks have all been maintenanced,
From dawn to setting sun,
Our work is mainly duties,
We seldom fire a gun.
Stuck in Queensland's rearward areas,
We dislike this L of C,
And you will always find us overlooked,
THIRD AUST. ARMOURED DEE-I-VEE.
Some people think we are useless,
But satisfied we feel,
We’re the men who saved this continent,
Mr Curtin’s “Ring of Steel”,
Brave talk of raiding Tokyo,
Or Nazi Germany,
Can never mean a thing to us,
THIRD AUST. ARMOURED DEE-I-VEE.
The A.I.F. were all sent home,
After service overseas,
Straight away they sent them right up north,
Ignoring all our pleas,


When the war is won and fighting's done,
Who shall drink to victory,
The only show that's still unharmed,
THIRD AUST. ARMOURED DEE-I-VEE.
This History will not dwell any further on the less agreeable
aspects of this era, but will indicate briefly the more savoury
phases for it was those that welded a group of squadrons into an
efficient fighting unit. Early in the Unit’s “Hill” history Major
Harry Cochrane marched in; a veteran of 1914-18 vintage he
deserves special mention for his harmonising influence in the
Regiment. He became O.C. Headquarters Squadron at an oppor-
tune time when many “old hands” were decrying the ever-in-
creasing numbers of reinforcements, and by his obvious efficiency
as a soldier and his sympathetic understanding as a man he
earned the admiration and loyalty of old and new alike and
thus welded them into a team. Second only to the Q.M. in his
ability to cloud an essential point with unnecessary bull-dust,
Harry was a born diplomat and equal to any occasion—with one
exception. At Mililat, “The Old Man” matted him for not
wearing his 1914-18 ribbons (Harry was scared someone would
think him too old) and the offending gentleman, not sure
whether “The Old Man” was fair dinkum or not remained
speechless, while Tommy Mills had a quiet chuckle over his
obvious discomfort.
The concentration of the Unit, too, had a unifying effect since
it gave the squadrons an opportunity to get to know one another;
it was good to see the coves of one squadron sipping a noggin at
another squadron canteen or having a brew at another kitchen.
The canteens, of course, were the social centres of the squadron
life where all the usual stories were dispensed with increasing
tempo as the night wore on, and where the S.Q.M.S. acted the
genial host in an effort to off-set some apparent stinginess of the
day. There was genuine regret when John Mackay closed them
down in favour of a regimental canteen—a master stroke which
drew the Unit together in a social atmosphere in which all men
mingled to swap stories and, more important, learn something
of the other fellow’s point of view. Many a good session was
had, each following a familiar pattern in which the seasoned
sozzler, in at the kill, saw the two-pot screamer swagger in and
stagger out, wore down the ordinary drinker, drank under the
casual and then wandered off to the kitchen for a snack as
though he’d just had an appetiser; doyen of these was perhaps


Frank Hevey for whom fifteen pints was an ordinary night’s
quota—little wonder the “Frank” became “Tank”!
Mine host of the unit canteen and keeper of the “Lady
Blarneys” was a changing personality. Clarrie Oates succeeded
Chuck Kinneally when the latter became “hors de combat” in
the train smash and he was followed by Ken Overton, Gib
Stupart and Frank Birtwell, the handy man of the Unit who
held the job for twelve months. However, the poison dispensed
by these Bacchanalian bartenders was milk in comparison with
the high explosive served up to the Blue Arc Club by Joe Knehr
and Butch Hoskin. “These two wily birds”, writes Bill Jacob
“became seasoned drinkers before anyone else was admitted to
this Holy Order whose inspiration was lemon essence. Aspirants
for membership had to survive a stiff test—quaff the prescribed
dose and return to lines under personal steam; for those who
failed there remained the degrading ride per wheelbarrow from
Club House to bed and many a night this one-wheel vehicle
rattled its tell-tale way over the stony ground. The club finally
lost its prestige when one Paul, a newcomer to the L.A.D., con-
sumed the measure without drawing breath and looked for more;
to an amazed audience he divulged that he had just come from
Darwin where for nine months he drank nothing else.
But the canteen was only one leg of the social tripod; by far
the most important was sport, by which the Regiment gained
prestige and learnt to barrack for itself as a unit. The unbeaten
Rugby League team ably coached by Jim Mclntyre, Ken Swan-
wick and Jack Thomson gained most distinction and almost
to a man represented 3 Australian Armoured Division in its
victory against Queensland L. of C. area and a narrow defeat by
the Toowoomba Cup Team. The three coaches were themselves
notable exponents of the game in their heydey; Jim was a club
mate of the international Paddy Maher when that grand player
led Maitland United, and could always be depended upon to
rally A Squadron in any sporting activity that was afoot. In this
he was ably assisted by Lew Webster, one of the most reliable
men in the whole Regiment, but, who, unfortunately, was con-
sidered too old by the Army to become an officer. Ken Swan-
wick, O.C. sport in C Squadron, played both football and cricket
with’the Queensland top-rankers-according to Jack Speare, who
continually chided him with his apparent fondness for sitting,
this must have been generations ago. Jack Thomson, R.S.M. and
2 I/C’s ganger, represented Riverina against the Englishmen.
Besides his football skill, Jack was also a noted footrunner with

squadrons and A Squadron, 1942.

creditable performances in all the professional races of the
Riverina. Although overshadowed by the success of the Rugby
enthusiasts, the followers of the Australian Code put up some
fine achievements and did their share in adding lustre to the
sporting name of the 2/4th. Confined almost entirely to B Squad-
ron, the organisation of this code was in the capable hands of
Jack Marmion and its most brilliant exponent was Lieut. Don
Budarick, an interstate representative.
Local leave, the third leg of the social tripod, was a pleasure
had at the expense of a twenty or thirty mile truck ride over
appalling roads to either Murgon or Nanango, with infrequent
visits to Kilkivan and Kingaroy. All these places had their
habitues, but perhaps the finest hospitality was dispensed by the
generous folk of Nanango where tennis and cricket matches,
boxing tournaments and socials were organised ad lib, the
socials by the untiring women's patriotic body and the sport
mainly through the kindly interest of Charlie Cook, a local
sporting identity whose hospitality was well known to men of
all regiments. It is worthy of note here that at one boxing tour-
nament Leo Lawrence exchanged creditable sparring blows with
Stumpy” Butwell, who later won the Australian Flyweight Belt.
It was during the Murgon days that the term “spinebashing”-
and the practice—gained common usage. There were those who
disappeared over the hill to spinebash in solitude; those who,
like Sandy Hodge, sought sanctuary from S.S.M.s in “Q” trucks
and the like; and those who confounded authority by indulging
the habit quite openly in the lines. Jim Mclntyre avers that
Horrie Crow was the greatest spinebasher of all time, his disser-
tations on and shining example of the art being always an
inspiration; to Horrie any time he wasn’t eating or sleeping was
leisure time and was best spent on the back. But life on “The
Hill” was far from being a round of pleasures. The first and
ultimate aim of the Commander was efficiency in the use of
armour and to that end we carried out an intensive course of
graduated training made realistic by a generous use of live
ammunition and the erection of tank attack “guns” and the like.
During this phase of training, too, the Unit carried out practice
in indirect fire from the tanks and obtained amazing accuracy
by using the indirect fire equipment evolved by Sergeants
“Middy” Midson and Keith Eddy, of B Squadron. In addition
there was a never-ending series of troop, squadron and regi-
mental exercises, culminating in the grandest of them all-the
“Dalby Dallies”.
c


In this scheme, conceived by Lt-Col. Jack Caddy as a boost to
morale as well as a stimulus to training, the Regiment, less a
small rear party, and with under command a squadron of 20
Motor Regiment, moved tactically to the Dalby area where a
series of regimental and social exercises was successfully con-
ducted over a period of three weeks. The social aspect of the
training consisted of capitalising on the liberal hospitality
lavished upon us by the whole Dalby-Jandowae district with a
spontaneity equalled only by that of the Narrabri-Moree resi-
dents. Jandowae was the home town of “Butch” Hoskin who,
with pardonable pride, introduced us to that prosperous town-
ship where we were feasted so royally; “Butch" had a flourishing
business there together with a charming wife and fine family.
Having sacrificed the profits of business and given up the
pleasures of home and family for six years it was tragic that his
return to these shores should have been so shortlived—he died of
natural causes in Toowoomba Hospital at Easter 1946. At the
conclusion of the manoeuvres the Unit displayed its armoured
might to the Dalby population and Bobby “Puncho” Brown of
B Squadron, thinking the demonstration lacking in realism,
fired a salute of one 37-mm. shell over the township into the
open fields beyond. Jack Young was a very relieved adjutant
when he and the “I", Des. Fagan, found it had landed in the
clear—a particularly good shot considering Bob only had the
shell depot for an aiming point.
The small rear party left on “The Hill" had the time of
their lives. S/Sgt George Bartlett and Tpr Freddie Bennett
played a leading role in the activities of the canteen which
seemed able to ladle out the amber fluid on a non-stop basis.
After a few of the parties, wheelbarrows were used to transport
some of the boys to their tents. The return of the Regiment
from Dalby did not arouse great enthusiasm among the mem-
bers of the rear party.
Back on “The Hill" with the “Dalby Dallies" a pleasant
memory, the Unit was rife with rumour which soon material-
ised into fact-2/4 Australian Armoured Regiment was on the
skids! So this was to be the end of all our striving, our hopes,
our ambitions! The future was too uncertain and too un-
pleasant to contemplate so for a few weeks we gave ourselves
up to the present. Meanwhile Brigadiers Ferguson and Mac-
arthur-Onslow were making representations on our behalf to
the Commander-in-Chief. “Fergy" is reputed to have told the
Commander-in-Chief that 2/4 was the best armoured regiment


in Australia and that in three months it could become the best
infantry regiment in Australia. In any event these two fine
soldiers evidently told a good tale; for presto! the skids were
removed and 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt was on a warning order to
move to Southport and come under command of 4 Aust. Armd
Bde, as a regimental group.
Xmas 1943 was indeed a merry one for the Show. On top of
the news of the Regiment's salvation from emasculation came
home leave for the majority; for the remainder, in addition to
the usual chores associated with a rear party, there were swim-
ming parades, local leave and the best Xmas parties in the
Unit’s history. The spirit of gay abandon of the Regiment may
well be illustrated by Padre Cahill’s entry in the officers’ leave
book on New Year’s Eve when, in the column “Time of Return”
he flippantly wrote “next year”, and sallied forth to test the
alertness of the provosts on the Kingaroy Road—and found them
alert! There was, however, one note of sadness amid this chorus
of cheer—Major Charles Lethbridge, who had been on extended
compassionate leave, received word of his discharge and spent
a brief twenty-four hours farewelling the men who had learned
to respect him as a man and admire him as a soldier. It was
regrettable that he never had the opportunity to fight with the
squadron he had moulded into such an efficient team; for-
tunately that pleasure fell to the lot of a very worthy successor
in Gos Cory. Early in the New Year the Regiment prepared for
its move to Southport. Reinforcements from 13 Aust. Armd Regt
marched in, amongst them Sergeant Royce Whatley who was
destined to be awarded the M.M. for distinguished service on
Bougainville. Shortly afterwards the Unit, with its sub-units
under command for the first time, made its way, per M.T. con-
voy, to 4 Aust. Armd Bde where it came under command of
Brigadier Denzil Macarthur-Onslow with whom many of us
had been associated in 1 Aust. Armd Bde. We had now parted
company with our medium and light tanks and the future for us
meant Matildas and full tropical scale.
It is fitting that this History should record that the rear party
under Lieut. Ray Hibbard made such a thorough job of cleaning
up “The Hill” area, even to the extent of loosening the soil on
which the tents and tanks had stood, that the Unit earned the
special commendation of Field Security and the sincere thanks of
the property owner, Mr. Stumm.


CHAPTER IV
GOLDEN SANDS AND
SUN-BURNT WENCHES
Surely no more pleasant centre has been selected for a camp
than Southport, the renowned watering place of Southern
Queensland where even during the war years, there was an un-
ending stream of holiday makers seeking the assured bodily
benefits of a warm sun and stimulating surf, and the mental
relaxation of the round of gaiety ever to be found there. Here
the Regiment worked hard and played hard for the remainder
of its time in Australia, achieving efficiency in the use of the
Matilda on the one hand, and enjoying the amenities of civilisa-
tion on the other. Although the conversion from medium and
light tanks to Matildas meant hard work and inconvenience to
tank crews, the task of the latter was trifling in comparison with
that of the Q.M. and his hard working staff who had the most
exacting and unenviable job in the Unit. One look at the
Unit War Equipment Table was sufficient to make the stoutest
heart quail before the task of accounting for Unit stores and
equipment, without the added annoyance of continually march-
ing in and marching out vehicles and equipment. Surely no
unit of the Australian Army can boast the same colossal
number of vehicles that passed through the “Q” records of the
2/4th—23o M.T., 35 armoured cars, 13 scout cars, 168 tanks and
30 miscellaneous (slave chargers, ammunition trailers, water
trucks etc.). These figures are fairly accurate estimates only, and
do not include sub-unit vehicles. The Regiment was indeed
fortunate in having for its Q.M., throughout its history, Doug.
Green, whose charm of personality never dimmed before any
situation and whose organising ability and attention to detail
were at all times a source of great comfort to the Commander.
But even a Q.M. of the calibre of Doug could not have evolved
the same smoothness and efficiency of “Q” machinery without


the invaluable help of the quiet and capable Frank Gosden,
R.Q.M.S., and his loyal henchmen.
In a remarkably short space of time individual training was
completed, thanks to the generous assistance of instructors from
3 Army Tank Battalion, and the Unit began to do troop, squad-
ron and regimental exercises. Within a few weeks of receiving
its last consignment of “Tillies" the Regiment successfully
staged a full-scale “attack" at Wasp Creek as a demonstration to
the L.H.Q. Tactical School. This was a triumph for Major
John Mackay who was Adm. Command after the departure of
Lt-Col. Caddy, and who insisted, against the advice of senior
Brigade officers, on the ability of the Regiment to carry out the
exercise despite its inexperience with the Matildas. The out-
standing success of the demonstration clearly vindicated his
expression of faith in the Unit. The demonstration was re-
peated with equal success some two months later. The staging
of squadron and regimental exercises involved the supply and
repair organisation of the whole Group which now consisted
of 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt, 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt Workshops
A.E.M.E., 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt Ordinance Field Park, 2/4 Aust.
Armd Regt Signal Troop, 245 L.A.D. and 2/34 Tank Trans-
porter Platoon A.A.S.C. Of the sub-units, Signals and 245 L.A.D.
had been attached at Murgon, while Workshops and Field Park
came under command just prior to the move from 2 Aust. Armd
Bde in which formation each had been an independent unit
servicing the Brigade. 2/34 Tank Transporter Platoon was raised
in Northern Territory and brought south by its 0.C., Lieut.
Don. Wallace, who made of it a grand little show, which, un-
fortunately, was destined to remain in Australia when the rest
of the Group sailed. Each of these sub-units was a separate in-
denting and accounting unit which dealt directly with For-
mation Service Chiefs on service matters. Henceforth each was
an integral part of the Group and contributed its full share
towards the ultimate success of the Group in operations.
In addition to tank training the Unit carried out intensive
weapon training and training in jungle warfare (infantry) both
in the camp area and at the Brigade Jungle Warfare School at
Upper Nerang. Such training gave to every officer and man
additional confidence to outwit the enemy whom he was to meet
under similar conditions, and at the same time raised the already
high standard of physical fitness of the Regiment. On top of this
was the cumulative effect of swimming and surf schools at the
P.T. School at Burleigh, stand-down days spent on the beach,


and keen sporting contests with other units. By July the whole
Group was fighting fit, with morale on the up and up as rumours
of movement north began to spread. Meanwhile everyone had
been enjoying the social life which abounded in and about
Southport. An army of wives descended on the township to
enjoy a seaside holiday and keep a wifely eye on husbands, and
it was indeed a great boon to the coves after a hard day’s tanking
to slip into town with the sure knowledge that a sympathetic
ear and consoling arms would make them forget for a short time
that there was a war on. To the wifeless ones, too, there was
always the lure of the chase with quarry to be sought on and
about every beach from Southport to the border—or alternatively
the consoling influence of the unit canteen.
During this period reinforcements marched in from 3 Army
Tank Battalion, which was disbanded, and Canungra Jungle
Warfare Training School. The latter were mere youngsters who
had just completed their training after enlistment, and having
suffered no rotation at the hands of the Army were keen soldiers
and proved a great asset to the Regiment. About this time too,
Staff/Sgt George Bartlett, who had been I/C R.H.Q. orderly
room, marched out to F.E.L.O. where he was commissioned. An
Englishman who had spent much time in the Dutch East Indies
prior to the war, George had put body and soul into his work
for the Regiment and his record of service and achievement is
indeed a proud one. In April, the C. 0., Lt-Col. John Caddy,
flew to New Guinea on a tour of inspection to get first-hand in-
formation on the operations of 1 Army Tank Battalion, and
being taken ill was evacuated from there back to Adelaide. He
did not again rejoin the Unit and Major John Mackay was
appointed to administer command pending the appointment of
another C.O. During his period of command Lt-Col. Caddy had
seen a group of squadrons become a unit, which he had brought
to a high standard of efficiency with a place high on the priority
list for a guernsey. Before he passes from this History, a reference
to his notorious driving might not be out of place. During the
Murgon days when he and the squadron leaders were driving
per staff car to Brisbane, John relieved the driver and, with the
speedo hovering about 70, turned to Chas Lethbridge and
remarked in all earnestness, “The car’s a bit sluggish this morn-
ing, Major Lethbridge.” The latter saw to it that his driver,
Roy Ezzy, never again yielded the wheel to the C.O.
Still another loss was in store for the show. In May, Major
Ford Grieve flew north to watch the Yanks take Biak. With


Capt. Graham Irwin of 2/9 Aust. Armd Regt and Lt Thompson
of Engineers he found himself the target for Jap mortars and
was seriously wounded, being saved from a worse fate by the
heroism of his two companions. Endearingly known to his squad-
ron as “Farmer Grieve”, Ford was perhaps the most companion-
able spirit of the Unit and his going a great loss. Like most senior
officers his methods of crew control were not always according
to Hoyle, the classic being his fire order to Lloyd Hardy at Wasp
Creek: “Now then, young Hardy, see that tree over there; see
if you can hit the b thing.” This bears comparison with John
Caddy’s instructions to driver: “Pull up under that tree over
there,” as he indicated the tree by pointing from the turret top.
Meanwhile, Major Gos Cory, of 6 Div. Cav. with whom he had
fought in the Middle East, marched in to command C Squadron
which, during the long period of Major Lethbridge’s leave and
since his discharge, had been commanded by Capt. Gerald
Beverley.
In May the newly appointed C.O. arrived in the person of Lt-
Col. Tom Mills, M.C. and Bar, one of the most distinguished
Australian soldiers of this war, who had been decorated in the
Middle East with 6 Div. Cav. and since his return to Australia
had been successively 2 I/C 2/11 Aust. Armd Car Regt and C.O.
2/5 Aust. Armd Regt. His prestige, soldierly bearing and un-
doubted ability were at all times an inspiration to the Unit;
he who had faltered not in the face of Italian and French
machine guns, feared not to assail red tape in high places in the
interests of the Unit, and in his never-ceasing demand for equip-
ment, thrust his stern chin before brigadiers and generals with
assured nonchalance. The strength of senior officers was further
increased just before the Unit sailed when Major Ken Arnott
arrived to take Ford Grieve’s place and relieve that diminutive
bundle of efficiency, Lieut. Jim Allard, as O.C. B Squadron.
A further change of personnel at this juncture is worthy of
note—the discharge on medical grounds of S/Sgt Bill Jacob, who
since the inception of the Unit had not only been “Q” in C
Squadron but also guide, philosopher and friend to the person-
nel of the squadron. Typical of the hospitable folk of the North-
West, Bill was a genial and unconventional soldier whose farewell
to the Unit was indeed a fitting one-a surprised officer was in-
specting Headquarters Squadron on the morning parade when
he was startled to meet Bill coming along the ranks in the
opposite direction, shaking hands with this one and that one
and not at all concerned about a mere inspection. A few minutes


later at R.H.Q. a C.O.’s conference was disturbed in like man-
ner by Bill who formally saluted “The Old Man” and said
“Excuse me, Sir, I’m going now,” then turning to the Q.M. and
Adjutant informally said “Cheerio Doug, old man, cheerio
Mort.” Indeed a “remarkable fellow” and a “very excellent”
one.
This brief survey must suffice to show the phases of life at
Southport with its hard work and its hard play, where we pre-
pared earnestly for tropical warfare in an environment made
pleasant by nature and inviting by the amenities of man. There
was, however, one note of sadness in this period—the tragic death
by drowning of Troopers N. P. Couch and B. F. Ferres of B
Squadron who were swept out to sea whilst fishing near the
mouth of the bay.
With a definite promise of action by Brigadier Macarthur-
Onslow, the experience of new forms of training, and persistent
and promising rumours, morale during this period knew no
“lows”. It was intended that the Regiment should join 1 Aust.
Corps on the Atherton Tableland, but before this was effected
the plot was changed and the Group found itself on a warning
order to embark for New Guinea.
Command and staff appointments at this juncture were:—
C. 0., Lt-Col. T. Mills, M.C. and Bar; 2 1/C Major J. Mackay;
Adjutant, Capt. M. J. Maiden; Q.M., Capt. E. D. B. Green;
T. 0., Capt. M. Gilbert; 1.0., Lt D. J. Fagan; L. 0., Lt H. R. M.
Ross; R.M.0., Capt. J. McKenzie; Padre Tuohy; O.C. Head-
quarters Squadron, Major H. Cochrane; O.C. A Squadron, Capt.
M. Robinson; O.C. B Squadron, Major K. Arnott; O.C. C.
Squadron, Major G. Cory; O.C. Workshops, Major N. Tude-
hope; O.C. Field Park, Capt. W. Lawson; O.C. 245 L.A.D.,
Capt. E. Humphries; O.C. Signals, Lt F. Fowler; Signals Main-
tenance Officer, Lt R. Wilmott; O.C. 2/34 Tank Transporter
Platoon, Lt D. Wallace. It is worthy of note that Lt Frank Fry
had worthily held the appointment of T.O. for some six months
but was unfortunate in missing promotion owing to the posting
of Captain Merv. Gilbert from the disbanded 3 Army Tank
Battalion. The warning order for movement to New Guinea was
followed by unusual bustle and activity accompanied by an air
of suppressed excitement quite foreign to the Unit, for here,
after four or five years of soldiering, was our big moment. Per-
sonal and unit equipment was checked and where necessary
replaced, tropic-proofed tentage and tarpaulins were marched
in, thanks to the energetic “Q” who worried every D.A.Q.M.G.


and A.D.O.S. of the whole Queensland L. of C. Area. Every
time the Q.M. and Adjutant were seen in a “huddle” the boys
would reckon it was on; but day after day, week after week went
by, with the ever-loving husbands saying many good-byes to their
camp-following wives and the fickle roues blazing a last glorious
trail along the hunting grounds of the South Coast.
To the personnel of a unit famed for its attention to main-
tenance the most disappointing feature of the movement order
was the instruction to move without vehicles; subsequently this
order was modified very slightly, and we took 26 tanks, 24 jeeps,
6 trailers Bcwt., 12 ammunition trailers, a mere fraction of our
complete W.E. It was well-nigh heartbreaking to hand over per-
fectly maintenanced vehicles with the sure knowledge that those
awaiting us on the Island—if any—would be almost useless. The
blow was perhaps worst for Field Park whose lads had fitted
their trucks with excellently made drawers and bins into which
they had stored their 70 odd tons of spare parts in a fool-proof
storage and index system; to them the order meant making hun-
dreds of crates, packing their stores en masse and sorting them
on the Island, if and when they could get suitable trucks for
storing. Representations to L.H.Q. on behalf of Field Park were
of no avail for evidently records disclosed that there were, some-
where in New Guinea, sufficient vehicles for 2/4 Aust. Armd
Regt Gp. Possibly there were, but, as we feared, it took some
three months of continual demanding to get a strange assortment
of almost useless veterans which had been belted from Buna to
Madang. Fortunately Harry Cochrane, the diplomat, who had
flown to the Island to inspect the vehicles and equipment of
1 Aust. Armd Regt had convinced the B.G.S. of New Guinea
Force that we should take some jeeps and trailers and that gentle-
man, in his wisdom, decided 24 was a nice-sounding number and
fixed it at that with 6 trailers to go with them. But for this
princely concession the Unit would have found itself in New
Guinea without one reliable jeep and with no trailers 8 cwt.—
there were 81 on the W.E. of the Group.
Several false alarms preceded the actual move from Southport.
The final one on 18th August looked the goods. Everyone was
convinced that at last the Unit was going, and tents and other
fixtures were pulled down with gusto. Lieut. Colin Salmon had
a most comfortable bed in his tent, but he wasted no time in
getting it dismantled. Just when the work was finished word was
received that the move had been delayed. The language of the
tent-less, bed-less ones had to be heard to be believed.


The Unit finally made the convoy north to Kalinga staging
camp whence it embarked on H.M.T. Duntroon at 0630 hours
on 25th August 1944. Previous to this the tanks with an escort
party under command of Lieut. Frank Fry had sailed per
Liberty ship.
Accompanying the Unit was a War Office Trials Detachment
from 4 Aust. Armd Bde under command of Major George Dennis.
This detachment was to carry out tests with the “Churchill"
and “Sherman" under tropical conditions and send their reports
to the War Office in London via the usual channels, of course;
it would be interesting to know where those reports are now
pigeon-holed. Our movement from Southport meant a severance
with 4 Aust. Armd Bde whose commander and staff at all times
evinced a sympathetic interest in our problems. To all ranks
Brigadier D. Macarthur-Onslow was a legendary figure whose
exploits in the desert in 1940-41 had won for him a D.S.O. and
the unstinted praise of British generals, one of whom went so
far as to say he was as good as a squadron of cavalry on his own.
In addition to his undisputed daring and skill as a leader in
battle, the Brigadier was admired by all ranks for his salesman-
ship of tanks—it was common talk, whether true or not, that all
armoured units would have been on the skids but for Brigadier
Onslow. Then too, he won widespread regard by his informality
and the ease with which the chaps “got on" with him. It was
natural enough that the Brigadier should gather about him a
staff which, besides being efficient in administration, took a
personal interest in the welfare of each unit. To none did this
apply more than to the 8.M., Major Fred Taylor, who im-
plemented the Brigadier’s policy wisely and sympathetically.
For Brigadier Onslow and his staff, then, the Unit held a high
regard and warm feelings as it passed from command in August
1944.


CHAPTER V
THE FIRST CHEVRON
Fortunately there were no great crowds to cheer us on our way
and disturb the even tenor of our thoughts and the tenderness
of our feelings; we saw not the wharves with their drabness and
heard not the intermittent shouts of the few slothful wharfies
lazing about as though anxious not to incur the displeasure of
their union; rather, we pictured vividly the familiar beauty of
home environs and heard distinctly from within the gentle and
kindly voices of loved ones far away. This sacred reverie was not
even broken to acknowledge the goodwill of those who waved
from trams and houses as we moved parallel to a busy Brisbane
thoroughfare and glided silently towards the open sea. Mid-
afternoon saw us well clear of land with the Duntvoon plough-
ing through a swell of sufficient dimensions to reveal the more
recalcitrant stomachs; by night-fall the sea had taken unto itself
many good lunches and was anticipating a harvest of teas; to
the less robust of us it was comforting to see brought low such
virile types as Bill Gately, Ken Swanwick and Claude Thame; the
latter provided a pitiable spectacle, deathly green in colour and
cheerless of voice—the sickest of us felt immeasurably better after
one look at Claude.
Life aboard ship was indeed a holiday; apart from boat drill
at 0930 hours daily and the mess parades, there was no set routine.
Many and varied were the occupations—cards, housie-housie,
reading, “doovering”, yarning, writing, watching the sea or the
land, fishing, spinebashing and so on ad infinitum; at night there
were concerts, quiz sessions and the like organised by Lt Ray
Hibbard of the golden voice who was untiring in his efforts to
make the voyage an enjoyable one for all ranks. Thus pleasantly
passed the days as we chugged along the Barrier Reef with its
kaleidoscopic beauty, paused at the well situated town of Cairns
with its background of rugged hills edging close to the sea, and
crossed the now famous Coral Sea to gain the south-eastern


shores of New Guinea; on past Milne Bay, historic scene of the
Jap’s first defeat, past Buna and Sanananda where 2/6 Aust.
Armd Regt wrote the first glorious chapters of Australian tanks
in the Pacific; beyond Finschhafen whence we could see Satel-
berg, scene of the memorable feat of arms that won Derrick his
V.C.; and thus to the quiet harbour of Madang. There we
dropped anchor and disembarked into L.C.M.s which took us
some eight miles north to Mililat Plantation which was to be our
home for the next phase of our existence.
The new camp site bordered on a quiet bay which was shelt-
ered from the open sea by Mai Mai Island and boasted a deep
water channel said to have been used by the Emden and Von
Luckner during the 1914-18 war. Thanks to Harry Cochrane and
a team of “boongs” the spot, though somewhat dispiriting at
first sight, was comparatively clean with well defined squadron
and sub-unit areas, complete with “street” signs. After the first
feverish unloading of stores and erection of tents there followed
the usual camp construction and maintenance of vehicles and
equipment taken over from 1 Aust. Armd Regt whose rear party
was still in the area. O.C. Camp Construction was, of course,
John Mackay who, with his co-rotater, Jack Thomson, had work-
ing parties of every description scattered over the face of the area.
Roads were built—sometimes two or three times; drains were
dug—after much technical discussion; latrines, showers, mess huts
and tank shelters were erected. In all this mad rush of building
a certain amount of squadron rivalry was evinced, particularly in
the matter of House Pek Peks, the doyen of which was that
“belonga” H.Q. Sqn. The scribe “Lakatoi” writing in Atebrin
Advocate summed up Sqn. feeling on the structure:—
Goodbye to diarrhoea, goodbye to all the flies
We've got a new House Pek Pek of very ample size,
But in the hearts of all of us we have such longing beats
For the luxury and comfort of those famous Southport seats.
We’re proud of our new building, it’s airy and it’s light,
Though we must admit it’s dark there at the falling of the night;
But despite its hygiene lessons, and its many other treats
Oh! please sir, Maj. Cochrane, get us back our Southport seats.
We know that it is flyproof, and keeps out all the rain,
The man who planned and built it possessed a super-brain ;


But we’re willing to dice its comforts, and dice them very neat
If we could only use once more that lovely Southport seat.
It’s not that we’re complaining, we hope that you’re not deaf;
We know the new convenience is the best in the the A.1.F.;
But in spite of all its virtues, and its freedom from the heat
It isn’t half as comfy as our splendid Southport seat.
The new buildings well constructed—that isn’t any crime,
It’s a first class place for bludgers to while away the time;
But as they sit and read in peace—gazing at their feet
They think of how much better was that famous Southport seat.
Attempts to talk pidgin to the boongs caused many amusing
incidents, notable among them being John Mackay’s careful but
lengthy instructions made with great thought and difficulty in
pidgin to a boong who was going to caulk the salvaged Jap
barge. At the conclusion of his worthy effort the boong remarked
in very good English—“ You want us to plug up those holes,
master” or words to that effect. On another occasion a boong
called at A Sqn Orderly Room looking for “Soldier three stripes
belonga arm—no grass belonga coconut”. Naturally Max Berry
sent him down to Jack Speare, but it transpired that Bill Sandry
was the man required. The preponderance of tinned food (with
little variety of contents) and the lack of good burning wood
threw the cooks on their mettle to preserve their reputation—
locally held, at least—of belonging to the best fed unit of the
A.I.F. Under the leadership of the W.O. Caterer, Joe Knehr,
they rose magnificently to the occasion and disguised bully beef,
M. and V. and goldfish in all sorts of ways. To add a bit of
variety to the menu Joe and Bill Sandry, complete with jeep
and a few boongs, became expert cattle duffers, leaving camp
before dawn in their quest for cattle in the jungle. An accurate
shot from a 303, a hurried cutting up of the carcase and in a
short time they would be speeding joyously back to camp with a
day’s fresh meat for the Unit. Another service job performed by
Joe was the “Knehr Coral Cooler”, a fairly big structure built
of timber with double walls of perforated tin; between the tin
walls, Joe chucked great quantities of coral and on top raised
a water tank with provision for the water to drip on the coral;
the general idea was that the air passing through the perfora-
tions and the wet coral, cooled the unit beer inside the chamber.
Such was the service rendered the Unit by the A.A.C.C. person


nel. Throughout the whole history of the Regiment I cannot
recall one complaint about the standard of meals in any squad-
ron mess—truly a fine tribute to an excellent job done under
very trying conditions.
Hand in hand with the domestic details of camp construction,
cooking and interpreting boongs, went the important task of
reorganising into armoured squadron groups in preparation for
the Unit’s several tasks in the Pacific. Orders for this reorganisa-
tion were awaiting the Group on its arrival and involved the in-
corporation of 245 L.A.D. in 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt Workshops
A.E.M.E., the expansion of 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt Ord. Field Park,
and the subsequent subdivision of Workshops, Field Park and
Sigs into A B and C sections for subsequent allocation to A, B
and C Squadrons respectively; each sub-unit of course was to
maintain a H.Q. Section for administrative purposes and to
maintenance and supply Regt H.Q. and H.Q. Squadron. This
reorganisation was completed in the order of priority of the
squadrons—C, B, A.
The new set-up created many A and Q problems for the Regi-
ment, the sub-units and the integral parts of the squadron
groups; for example there was the matter of normal A and Q
returns, replacement and replenishing of stores, reinforcements
and so on. With the prospect of squadron groups being scat-
tered about the Pacific, suitable administrative machinery had
to be evolved, and this task was accomplished after much sweat-
ing by A and Q staffs of the Group. Within each squadron
group, the Squadron Workshops Section and Field Park Sec-
tion each became a separate indenting and accounting unit,
while the Sigs Section of a corporal and three men became
attached to the squadron. Provision was made for each of the
three to make independent returns in normal A and Q matters,
with copies to come to respective H.Q. within the Regt Group.
From the surplus officers an A.Q. officer and a transport officer
were appointed to each squadron; these and their staffs were
schooled by Regimental A, Q and Transport staffs in preparation
for their independent roles. While the Regt Group remained
concentrated, the new organisation meant for Group H.Q. an
administrative task as complicated as any brigade set-up; with
three H.Q. within each sqn group, H.Q. Sqn, Reinforcement
Sqn, Workshops H.Q., Field Park H.Q., and Sigs H.Q., there
was a total of 14 orderly rooms for administrative purposes—
truly a large organisation which fortunately did not exist for


long, but simplified itself with the departure of C and B Sqn
Groups for Aitape and Bougainville respectively.
The smoothness with which the administrative machinery
functioned was a tribute to all orderly room staffs and in par-
ticular to the head of “The Brains Trust”, S/Sgt Jack Speare,
and his henchmen Mick Redman, Ken McCade and Dave Pether-
bridge. Within their H.Q. was always that companionable atmo-
sphere which makes for cheerful co-operation and efficiency and
which permeated beyond Group H.Q. until all orderly rooms
were linked in this network of cheerful and co-operative en-
deavour. A journalist in Brisbane in private life, Jack had a flair
for office organisation, and despite the allegation of advanced
senility from chiding cobbers, always remained one of the fittest
men in the Unit. His capacity for turning out “bumph” in
unlimited quantity, was a byword in the Unit and it’s a safe
bet that when Jack’s number goes up you’ll find him “roneoing
the heavenly R.O.s”. Although his keen sense of humour was
well known throughout the Unit he was a past master at dis-
guising his jokes; the classic example was his introduction of
time sheets to R.H.Q. staff including Pay Sgt and Corporal.
Throughout one whole day these temporarily dispirited soldiers
accurately recorded all their accomplishments and endeavours
each quarter of an hour period all the while passing derogatory
remarks about the adjectival Adjutant and 2 I/C, one of whom,
so they thought, must have conceived this unnecessary piece of
rotation. Not until 2000 hrs, when the time sheets were com-
pleted and “handed in” did Jack divulge his joke. The whole
Group appreciated and looked for Jack’s nightly news service
inaugurated at Southport, whereby he took down the items in
shorthand from the 1900 hrs A.B.C. news and typed sufficient
copies for the Group. Readers of Atebrin Advocate will doubt-
less remember the humorous write up of this service which
concluded: “We will cease at this stage from sheer decency to
describe the scene any further, but how the news sheet is ever
published is a mystery we have yet to solve. But bear with him,
chaps, and next time you see his frail form stumbling along the
path of duty, cheer him on, for you now have a slight inkling
of his nightly agony, endured in the performances of a great
profession.”
Of the sqn orderly rooms, the most complex in organisa-
tion was H.Q. Sqn, and this was very capably handled by the
ever reliable Vic Lloyd, a sporting identity from the N.S.W.
town of West Wyalong. Vic’s contagious good humour and


willingness to do a good turn were a power for good throughout
the whole of his squadron. Special mention must be made, too,
of the sub-unit orderly rooms which had to keep an adminis-
trative check on personnel scattered in four sections; of these
workshops with the most men had the hardest task, but with
Vic Arnell in charge of the orderly room everything went
smoothly. Allan Soper of Field Park also had everything at his
finger tips. The complex organisation involving some fourteen
orderly rooms naturally meant an increased strain on the tele-
phone system and hence on the Sigs who maintained it. Con-
sisting of only two officers and 18 O/Rs, this troop did a mighty
job throughout the whole course of the Group’s history. It had
to do second line repairs on all unit wireless sets as well as keep
open a switchboard well past the “worn” stage and, of course,
carry on normal unit administration in “A” and “Q” matters.
On top of all this, Sigs were ever ready to oblige with specials,
such as supplying light batteries, making battery lamps and
repairing private sets. O.C. technical work was Lt Roy Wilmot,
well known for his dry humour, while Lt Fred Fowler kept an
eagle eye on communications. To them and their band of efficient
workers, the Unit owed special thanks for well maintenanced
sets, a group of well-trained operators and a telephone system
that worked. One special service job of theirs requires mention
here—the installation of an emergency hand set at the rear of
the tank so that in the event of failure of the S.R.C. 536 (Walkie
Talkie), communication with the crew could be maintained by
means of power microphone. B Sqn tanks used this emergency
set to some purpose in directing fire at Slater's Knoll, Bougain-
ville.
Of great assistance to the Sigs was the Regt Sig. Sgt D. H.
Mitchell, who literally “lived” on the switchboard and lines.
“Mitch” it was who earned for himself the sobriquet “Pinhead
the Pirate” by scrounging a boat complete with motor and
dashing about the bay as a rival to The Old Man. Many will
recall the humorous incident when “Mitch” tied his boat to
a small wharf at Alexishafen while he went fishing; on his return
he was dismayed to learn that the rising tide had jammed the
boat under the wharf until the water gradually poured in and
sank it. “Mitch” walked home.
The C.O.’s great concern during this period was the deficiency
in vehicles and the poor mechanical state of those that were
dribbling in to make up that deficiency. Since the matter of
equipment became a subject of bitter political controversy, it

is appropriate that this History should record our worries in
that direction. The only serious shortage was in vehicles and for
some reason or other Formation Staff officers could not, or would
not, see the need for the War Establishment allocation. There
followed a series of official written requests for vehicles backed
up by the C.O.’s personal representations to Divisional staff
officers and to the G.O.C. himself. Finally, the flow began and
there arrived in increasing numbers the finest old warriors that
New Guinea could boast, minus windscreen, hoods, and tools,
some under their own power or part of it, some being towed;
some were trucks G.S. instead of trucks binned, but still they
were trucks. But there arrived no trailers \ ton—essential for
carting ammunition and P.O.L.—tractors DB, or Diamond T
wreckers. In fact the Unit was still asking for these when the
war ended. Here is an extract from the Unit A.F.V. User’s Report
on activities from 10th July 1945, to 10th August 1945: “The
need for D 8 tractors or similar recovery vehicles was again
proved when, after Commo Ridge operation, it was necessary
to leave a bogged tank in enemy territory for one night owing to
it being impossible to recover it immediately.”
Shortages, camp construction and reorganisation notwith-
standing, training went forward to a pre-conceived plan. Tanks
were tested under jungle conditions; ammunition was tried out
against jungle growth and typical Jap bunkers; sights were cali-
brated; movement along tracks and through coconut plantations
was practised; liaison was established with the infantry bat-
talions of the area and definite principles of infantry-tank co-
operation laid down and practised. An interchange of lectures
was arranged, the Armoured lectures being delivered by Capt.
Frank Suffren, who had rejoined the Unit at Southport and
was, at this time, O.C. Reinforcements. This programme of
training culminated in a series of “engagements” involving the
employment of tanks and infantry and the use of live ammuni-
tion. At the same time the Unit was kept physically fit; on the
one hand by sound anti-malarial administration, and on the
other by physical training, swimming and patrols into the hills.
Thanks to the sensible outlook of all ranks on anti-malarial
measures, discipline in this regard was of a very high standard,
there being only one case of malaria up to Xmas 1944. The
Unit’s greatest worry from the health point of view was the
prevalence of dermatitis in some form or other, the main cause
of which seemed to be lack of facilities for boiling clothes and
D


heating water for showers and lack of sunlight on bodies due to
anti-malarial precautions.
In spite of the seemingly endless activities already recounted
there was time for leisure which was spent in devious enjoyable
ways, the most popular of which were swimming, boating and
“doovering”. Springboards were erected in every squadron area
and at the barge landing point; even the boongs from the
A.N.G.A.U. compound-Markham Valley lads who were not very
proficient in the water—learnt to dive. Hand in hand with swim-
ming went the boating urge, if such a dignified term as “boat”
may be used in reference to the crazy assemblage of craft that
graced the shores of our bay. There were lakatois, rowing boats,
canoes, punts, skiffs, outboards, an indeterminate number of mis-
cellaneous craft, a Jap barge—in fact boats of as many colours,
shapes and sizes as there were rats in Hamelin city, and one
day, too, the Pied Piper called them out for a grand regatta
which will be long remembered for the fun and frolic had by
all. History does not record how far behind the field Bert Way’s
craft was-Bert had a fine vessel consisting of two 44 gal. drums
cut lengthwise and generating a speed of one knot—with the tide.
“Doovering” of course is the art of trinket and ornament mak-
ing which reached a crescendo just before the Xmas mails closed;
our lads had an advantage over most others in this art because
of their access to a good supply of tools and machinery. All
manner of “doovering” was carried on—model planes, neck-
laces, brooches, bracelets, smoker’s stands, ashtrays, leather
work and so on; and the materials used were as varied as the
articles made-shells of many beautiful and rare kinds, perspex,
aluminium, steel, ammunition shells, coin of the realm, etc.
Especially in A Squadron was this activity rampant, and Mat
“Robbie” found it necessary to establish a special doovering
annex to the mess hut. However, for individual output, Bill
McMurray’s colossal production would be difficult to beat and
his reputation called forth the following notice in the Xmas
number of Atebrin Advocate :
R.Q. STORES L.T.D.
“The above establishment will not be open for business
between the hours 3 p.m. Sat. 24th Dec. and 9 a.m. 27th Dec.
The management extends the Season’s Greetings to its many
satisfied clients.
“NOTE: Customers wishing to contact Manager of Trinket
Dept, do so at the back entrance in Wilmott Avenue.


Other leisure activities were card tournaments, softball (which
“caught on” very rapidly), fishing, reading, and of course letter
writing; which brings this History to record the fine job of work
done by the unit postal sergeant, Jack Evans, who was never
more pleased than when he had to work hardest, for then his
hard work in sorting parcels and mail meant pleasure for the
boys; it really hurt Jack to have to tell someone he had no mail
for him. Finally, among the spare time activities of the Unit
must be mentioned gardening. First off the mark here was Mat
Robinson and A Sqn with a fine display of tomatoes and vine
vegetables; however, John Mackay mustered the full strength of
H.Q. officers and soon boasted a fine farm. Last to take the field
were Claude Thame and Jack Speare who had a model tomato
plot behind Gp H.Q., Claude even gathered bumpers from
which he made tobacco spray for pest control. The output
promised to be extraordinary when tragedy intervened—the
Unit moved and Claude’s tomatoes were left for the boongs.
Bad luck for Claude whom readers will ever remember as a most
obliging and efficient pay sergeant; his popularity with the lads
has been evinced in post-war days by his unanimous election
as unit representative on the committee of the N.S.W. branch of
the Armd Corps Association.
Atebrin Advocate, which has been mentioned from time to
time in this chapter, held an important place in H.Q. Sqn life.
Edited by Dave Petherbridge, its weekly publication was eagerly
awaited from the first issue on 18th November 1944 until the
last on 12th May 1945 when the movement of H.Q. Sqn to
Bougainville caused a cessation. Its articles and poems covered
every phase of squadron life in humorous vein and included a
sporting summary. As a builder of squadron spirit and a booster
of morale the influence of this paper was immense and to its
editor and many correspondents the squadron and regiment
owed a great debt.
Major Mackay’s barge trips were a feature of the Madang
activities. The barge was one the Japs had left behind, and after
much hard toil by Workshops it was finally induced to go. Major
Mackay, accompanied by other officers and men, would dash
down Mililat Harbour toward the open sea. The thrill of the
trip was that one never knew where the barge would end up.
Sometimes the engine would keep going, and sometimes it
wouldn’t. “Rip” Murray, who had the high post of chief en-
gineer, must have frequently cursed that engine.
Such, then, were the main phases of life at Mililat as the sqn


groups, one by one, prepared for battle. November saw C Sqn,
chock full of confidence and eager to come to grips with the
Nip, embark at Madang, destination Aitape and the famous
6 Aust. Div. Command and staff appointments of the Sqn Group
were:—
O.C. Maj. Gos Cory; 2 I/C, Capt. Gerald Beverley; A/O
Officer, Lt Ross Hall; Recce Officer, Lt Kim McMaster; T. 0.,
Lt Frank Fry; S.Q.M.S., S/Sgt Mai Bracegirdle; Ord. Room Cpl,
Cpl Ken Swanwick; O.C. Workshops Section, Capt. Col. Broad-
bent; O.C. Field Pk Section, Lt W. Nealy.
Mid-December saw another fledgling leave the nest as B Sqn
Gp, with morale unsurpassed, sailed for Bougainville, their com-
mand and staff appointments being:—
0.C., Maj. Ken. Arnott; 2 I/C, Lt Jim Allard; Recce Officer,
Lt John Young; A/Q Officer, Lt Peter Nicholls; T. 0., Lt Eric
Taunton; S.Q.M.S., S/Sgt Dick Ford; Ord. Room Cpl, Clem
Wilmer; O.C. Workshops Section, Capt. Ted Humphries; O.C.
Field Pk Section, Lt J. T. Stone.
The remainder of the Regt Group was destined to cool its
heels at Mililat until May, while C Sqn plodded hopefully down
the coast towards Wewak, and B Sqn covered itself in glory in
Bougainville; their selling of tanks was so successful that in May,
Higher Command ordered the whole Group, less C Sqn Gp, to
Bougainville. Meanwhile there had been two changes in com-
mand and staff personnel; Maj. N. A. Tudehope relinquished
command of Workshops and was succeeded by Capt. Ted.
Humphries; and Mort Maiden was evacuated to the mainland,
the appointment of Adjutant going to Jim Allard who had
commanded B Sqn in the Slater’s Knoll battle.
Thus it was over a long and trying period that the Unit
prepared to do battle for Australia; in the following parts of
this History readers will learn that all ranks had been thoroughly
fitted for the task.


PART II
BISCUITS IN BOUGAINVILLE




CHAPTER VI
“J. STIRLING MORTON”
Soon after arriving at Madang, the Group heard many rumours
of Australian troops taking over from the Americans in the
Solomons. It was also said that Maj.-Gen. Bridgeford, G.O.C.
3 Aust. Div., wanted tanks for his campaign in Bougainville,
and wonderful stories of Coca-Cola factories, ice cream, seventy-
eight picture shows every night and similar attractions had the
Regiment very interested. It was, therefore, with high spirits that
on 16th December 1944, B Sqn Group under the command of
Major K. M. H. Arnott embarked with all necessary equipment
at Madang, on the U.S. Liberty ship /. Stirling Morton, bound
for Bougainville. The trip proved to be an interesting one as the
ship also carried troops and equipment for Emirau Island, north
of Kaviang, where U.S. troops were being replaced by Austra-
lians. Owing to shortage of unloading barges, the J. Stirling
Morton was held up for a period of ten days, during which time
the troops were able to see the sights—all military; the American
PX canteen stores were very popular. Christmas Day was spent
at anchor and the ship turned on a traditional Christmas din-
ner for all on board. This was a very welcome change from the
bully, goldfish and diced carrots which were the staple diet for
the rest of the trip.
On 31st December B Sqn climbed down the side of the ship
on rope nets, into landing craft which beached them at Torokina,
the U.S. perimeter. Although somewhat prepared after what
they had seen at Emirau, all were amazed at the extensive roads
and installations that comprised Torokina. It was a veritable
city hacked out of the jungle. The next three months for B Sqn
were busy ones. Building camp, felling forest giants with tanks,
picture shows, extensive training with 9, 25 and 61 Bns of 7
Aust. Inf. Bde and later with 24, 58/59 and 57/60 Bns of 15 Bde,
maintenance, morse, modifications to the tanks—all these mixed
up together resulted in a very strenuous period. By the end of


March the camp was very comfortable with hot and cold sliding
doors and all mod. cons; friendships had been established with
the infantry and engineer units, and the whole Sqn Group was
on its toes crying out for a chance to prove itself. An amusing
incident occurred during training when in a demonstration for
58/59 Bn, 8 Troop successfully destroyed a bunker with
2-pounder fire and then gave an unrehearsed and unexpected
demonstration of a 2-pounder hitting the turret of a tank.
Damage was nil.
On 23rd March General Bridgeford reviewed the sqn and in-
formed them that they would be required for operations in the
Puriata area. He said that from the Puriata onwards the tanks
would play a decisive part in the drive to Buin. Every man
present thoroughly agreed. March saw Torokina very “trigger
happy" owing to the presence of several large Jap raiding parties
around the perimeter. It was during the early hours of the
morning of 18th March that Tpr McPhail was killed by a stray
bullet fired by a neighbouring unit at a Jap prowler. He was
buried by Padre Primrose in the Torokina cemetery. Other
casualties during B Sqn’s stay at Torokina included Cpl Wilf
Prettijohn, who was badly injured when a tree fell on him, and
Tpr “Shorty" Pettigrew, who fell 16 feet on to his head from
the roof of the tank park. He later rejoined 9 Tp whilst in
operations.


CHAPTER VII
SOUTH BOUGAINVILLE
The last week of March was a busy one for B Sqn for, although
a move to Toko was expected, training with 15 Bde did not
cease until about the 20th and orders were issued for the move
to take place commencing on the 28th. All jeeps moved by
road—and what a road it was; mostly a drive along the beach.
They formed a small advanced party. The tanks were moved
by L.C.T. together with heavy workshop vehicles. All tanks were
waterproofed for a wet landing, but the only troubles encount-
ered were when the Diamond T wrecker was “drowned" during
loading operations at Torokina, and when “Butch" Parker’s
jeep was towed in through the surf at Toko.
Immediately Major Arnott arrived in the first barge with tanks
of 7 and 9 Tps, he was told of the plight of 25 Bn, who
had several companies on the Buin Rd cut off by a large Nip
force. 7 and 9 Troops took off the waterproofing materials and
moved forward along the new road which had been built to
McKenna's Bridge over the Puriata. Here it was necessary to
waterproof again before wading the 4 ft deep river. During the
crossing one 7 Troop tank, commanded by Cpl Bruce Denne
was drowned", and another of 9 Troop developed faults Both
were left at the Puriata for repairs. The remaining four tanks
pushed on through mud and slush to H.Q. 25 Bn which was
situated at Slater’s Knoll, where the escort party was collected
Ihis was in the morning of Saturday 31st March 1945.
At this stage two companies had been out of contact for three
days; Tac R aircraft were unable to find traces of one. The O C
took a composite troop commanded by Lt Laurie Forsvth /tank
commanders Cpl johnny Hamp, Cpl Jack Warren, Cpl Arthur
Risby) forward with infantry escort and after a nightmare jour-
ney of bogging and “unbogging” found the enemy astride the
rack west of composite A and B Coy position. At first, difficulty
was experienced in knowing where to fire, but eventually com


tact was made with the Company Commander who indicated
the area of the Nips. The Japs were preparing to make their
sixth attack for the day and the Company Commander was
expecting to be over-run owing to his shortage of ammunition
and the number of injured he had. However, when the tanks
opened up, the Japs fled in disorder across the infantry perimeter,
where they were engaged by the infantry; those who remained
in weapon pits were machine-gunned and blasted by the tank
fire. Enemy dead lying 3 yds to 35 yds in front of the company
perimeter numbered ninety-four; many others must have been
in the vicinity.
One tank, accompanied by infantry, then moved on to the
Hatai track where on 30th March B Coy had been over-run
and forced to abandon equipment, after killing sixteen Japs.
Heavy equipment was recovered, and when a party of Japs
appeared, eleven were promptly despatched by the tanks. Mean-
while, a jeep train had been assembled to move forward and
bring back wounded from these isolated companies, three jeeps
from our light workshops and sig. teams were included. Halfway
along they were ambushed by a Jap party and were forced to take
to the bush, one man being killed, another wounded. While the
tank and party were recovering B Coy’s equipment, the remain-
ing two tanks escorted the injured and emaciated infantry back
towards 25 Bn H.Q. Reaching the abandoned jeeps, they were
in doubt as to what had happened. However, seeing the dead
and wounded men on the ground, Major Arnott, O.C. B Sqn
rushed forward to help them. Cfn Oliver, who had been with the
jeep train, and who was hiding in the scrub, saw Major Arnott
rushing into the ambush and shouted a warning, thereby giving
his own position away. The Jap opened up with L.M Ground-
ing Major Arnott in the heel and badly wounding Cfn Oliver in
the groin. A party of Japs prepared to come in and finish off
with bayonets, but fortunately tank crew commander, Cpl
Tohnny Hamp, saw what was going on and quickly laid his
gunner on and cut the Nips to ribbons with Besa.
Nightfall came, and the weary party formed a close perimeter
around the tanks, jeeps and wounded and spent a sleepless night.
Next day they reached 25 Bn and rushed the wounded off for
medical treatment. The tanks had immediately become the
“fairy godmother’’ of the infantry. It is said that the beleagured
companies, making their last stand, cheered madly when the
tanks opened up and put the Nips to flight.
By this time the remainder of the squadron had landed a


Toko and established a camp on the beach. Over the next few
days while these fortunates mixed business with pleasure, 7 and
9 Troops and Advanced B Ech. at Galvin’s Crossing collected
the stragglers and prepared for further conquests. 8 Troop were
moved across the Puriata and came under command 7 Bde,
as were 7 and 9 Troops. At Galvin’s Crossing we suffered several
casualties from shelling, none very serious-jack Warren, and
J. S. Hunter, and Bob Clarke, who could not sit down for
several days.
It was at this stage that Sigs 3 Div. were requested to supply
a code name for the tank squadron. For obvious reasons, the
code name allotted was “Biscuit”, and the tanks quickly became
known as biscuit tins” or “Arnott’s biscuits”. Even when, some
months later, the code name was changed, “Biscuits” still crept
into telephone or wireless conversations. In the early hours of
sth April, Bn H.Q. and a company of 25 Bn which were in
position on Slater’s Knoll, were subjected to a very heavy attack
by the Jap. In spite of heavy fire from our positions and our
25-pounders, he attacked right up to the perimeter wire, which
was cut in many places. By dawn he had dug in on the edge of
the clearing outside the wire and was covering our positions.
Another attack was made during the morning but was quickly
beaten back. However, from the fire that was coming at our
infantry it was evident that there was a very large party of Japs
involved, and it was realised that if the wire were not repaired
by nightfall they would almost certainly over-run the position.
Attempts by our men to move out to repair the fence were met
by a fusillade of shots from about thirty yards away.
Knowing that additional ammunition would be required, and
fearing an ambush on the L. of C., Bde H.Q. asked for two tanks
to tow forward three trailers filled with ammunition. Tanks
commanded by Sgt Midson and Sgt Alan Squires from 7 and 9
Tps respectively moved up, with Lt Gordon Scott controlling
from the ground by Walkie Talkie. On arrival at the infantry
perimeter the much needed ammunition was distributed to the
infantry. But the C.O. 25 Bn, Lt-Col. McKenna, had another
idea. He asked for the tanks to move through the perimeter wire
and to fire across the front of the wire, where all the Japs were
dug in. When the tanks opened up with Besa and 2-pd H.E. they
blasted the jungle away, leaving no cover for the Jap. Then fol-
lowed a most amazing spectacle resembling a rabbit shoot in
warren country. The Jap, devoid of cover and within about
thirty yards of our nearest weapon pits, decided it was time to


make a break for cover behind him. As each man showed him-
self there would be a “tally-ho” from our infantry and dozens
of weapons—Brens, rifles, Owens—would open up on him, some
of the firers even standing up out of their weapon pits. All the
time tanks were searching the ground with fire, ferreting out
any survivors.
At the end of an hour there was no more sign of live Japs
and the infantry moved out to mop up and collect the weapons
and equipment that the fleeing Nip had thrown away in his
hurry. In all 307 Japs were buried on and below Slater’s Knoll
after the day’s operations, and no one knows how many crept
away and died in the jungle nor how many were wounded and
evacuated. In addition, 3 Juki M.M.G.s, 41 L.M.G.s, 219 rifles
and 22 swords were captured, together with great quantities of
ammunition and equipment.
During the action Loader Operator Cpl Ralph Hockey was
injured in the face by a Besa round while clearing a stoppage.
Realising that he would be evacuated, he insisted on changing
places with Gunner “Steady” Woodforde from which position
he proceeded to reap vengeance on the Nips who had caused his
inconvenience. It is also suggested that he was tired of loading
2-pdrs into the breech just for Woodforde to fire them away.
Later P. W. reports showed that some 1800 Japs were involved
in these attacks on 25 Bn, and approximately 1000 casualties
were inflicted on them-a remarkably successful turn of events,
for 25 Bn were facing annihilation until the tanks came up to
their assistance. However, all praise is due to the infantry, who
unflinchingly stood up to vastly superior numbers of the enemy
and did not give ground. Lt-Col. McKenna received an im-
mediate award of the D.S.O. for his personal courage and
example and for the job that was done by his unit in these
operations.


CHAPTER VIII
ADVANCE TO HONGORAI
After Slater’s Knoll 15 Inf. Bde relieved 7 Bde in the drive on
Buin. Extensive training had been carried out at Torokina with
the battalions of this brigade—24, 57/60 and 58/59—and a very
good mutual understanding existed before being committed to
action together. After the two actions with 25 Bn, the tanks
were very popular and the presence of a troop of tanks with
an infantry company raised the morale of the infantry con-
siderably. On 16th May, 7 and 9 Troops moved forward with
24 Bn to Dawes’ Creek and Anderson’s Junction. This was the
first day of the advance which, by the time of the Jap surrender,
had reached the Mivo River. The real game was on now, and
B Squadron found itself farmed out to battalions and companies
throughout the Brigade.
Preceded by an artillery barrage that lifted as the tanks
advanced, Cpl Bruce Denne, who commanded the point tank,
was suddenly startled to see our “long Tom” shells landing
on the track 30 yards ahead of him. However, the artillery F. 0.0.
knew the score and the advance proceeded without trouble.
At Dawes Creek 7 Troop successfully silenced a Nip position
to enable our infantry to force a crossing. It was here that the
infantry, following up 2-pdr, 3-in. howitzer and Besa fire, found
the Nip sitting in his fox-hole, shaking, with no sign of fight in
him. It was at Anderson’s Junction that the Jap’s 75's successfully
shelled the company perimeter, killing Jim Doherty, Major
Arnott’s batman, and so seriously wounding Norton Rowe, the
Intelligence corporal, that he died later in hospital. Also Lt Jim
Allard, the Squadron 2 I/C, was evacuated wounded, following
Maj. Arnott’s example. There were in addition, many infantry
wounded.
On 18th April a platoon moved over Dawes’ Creek and was
pinned down some hundred yards up the road. A tank was pushed
forward to extricate them; the fire from the tanks had to be
brought down very close to our infantry, and it was here that


Tpr Ralph Young W. R. (with his Besa) actually shot a Very
pistol from the hand of a forward scout. Thanks to the engineers,
a sound crossing was built across the creek, and the remaining
tanks crossed with the infantry company and continued the
advance about 400 yds, when a strong Jap position some 75 yds
off the road held them up. Tanks engaged with searching fire
were unable to force them out. However, heavy artillery fire
during the night produced the desired effect and next morning
patrols found two dead in a position that would accommodate
about 100 men. In addition thirty packs containing ammuni-
tion, new clothing and blankets, boots and hard rations were
left behind by the fleeing Nip. 7 Troop continued the advance
to Sindou Creek without opposition and on 25th April 8 Troop
relieved them.
At this stage 9 and 10 Troops moved up the Hatai track, but
the enemy was becoming wary of the tanks and except for
searching likely spots with fire, no contact was made with the
enemy.
Starting on 28th April with artillery and Corsair support,
8 Troop advanced a distance of 650 yards knocking out a pill-
box and strafing the jungle beside the road. In the evening
whilst the infantry were preparing the perimeter Cpl Harry
Teesdale-Smith’s tank was responsible for repelling a determined
attack by ten Japs armed with L.M.Gs. Shortly afterwards
tragedy befell the same crew when the tank received a direct hit
from a 3-inch smoke mortar bomb which, apparently, had dropped
short during ranging for a defensive task. The operator, Tom
Brown, was killed instantly and driver Keith Dahl died shortly
afterwards from severe wounds. The gunner A. D. Shaw and Cpl
Teesdale-Smith suffered severe burns from the phosphorus. Con-
siderable difficulty was experienced in handling the casualties
and later cleaning the tank, for contact with the glowing phos-
phorus caused bad burns.
On 24th April a Field Park jeep containing Padre Primrose,
Ptes George Foletta and Jim Wilson was fired on by three enemy
whilst moving along the main 3-ton road. Wilson was badly
wounded in both legs-one of which he lost-and it is said that
the Padre’s language about the Sons of Heaven in general was
hardly in accord with his calling. Two days later a jeep moving
up to a forward company was ambushed, the crews went to
around and Tprs “Happy” Cole and Claude Parker moved
forward with an infanteer to clear the ambush. Claude Parker
was badly wounded in the right thigh before Cole, after grenad


ing and shooting up the position, was able to get him back to
safety. They claimed they “got the Nip what done it”,—a small
consolation. The next advance of three-quarters of a mile was
gained, without opposition, but on 4th May 8 Troop with D
Coy 24 Bn encountered light opposition which was engaged
with Besa. A log across the track caused the point tank to halt
and search the neighbouring ground. The gunner Dick Allen
was looking at a large lily leaf when it swayed to one side dis-
closing the muzzle of a 75-mm. 20 yards away. The gun fired
immediately, missing the tank. Without more ado, Dick let fly
with Besa, then 2-pounder, disabling the gun and crew of three,
including a lieutenant. Behind the gun position there was
approximately a company of Nips, dug in and with heavy bunker
positions. 8 Troop played a merry tune on their Besas and 2-
pounders and the Nip very wisely “scrambled” leaving docu-
ments, equipment and ammunition. During this operation the
supporting infantry were a little loath to move into the enemy
position; however, W. 0.11 Roy Lockwood, the S.S.M., who was
on a souvenir hunt, took over an infantry section, and, using
typical ‘sar-major” expletives, led them into the gun position.
The 75-mm., the first of several knocked out by the tanks, was
towed back to B Sqn area with appropriate ceremony.
On the morrow, 8 Troop continued the advance, spraying
right and left. The Besa of Sgt Royce Whatley’s tank stopped
through having a case jammed in the breech. As the only way
to clear this type of stoppage is to push a rod down the barrel,
Cpl Frank Clarke removed it from its mount and proceeded to fix
it. However, a direct hit from a 75-mm. in the front of the tank
scattered shrap through the gun port and Frank received the
blast in his face. Unfortunately, a piece of shrap penetrated his
eye, which the medicos were unable to save. In spite of small
arms fire which was being directed at his tank, Sgt Whatley
opened up, and removed Clarke from the turret, whilst the
reserve tank gave supporting fire. A tank of 6 Troop, who were
in reserve, came forward and reinforcing 8 Troop took up the
lead. Continuing the advance, an L.M.G. was silenced and the
point tank discovered a road block across the road. The muzzle
of a 75-mm. was sighted by Gunner Bert Doyle who proceeded
to do it over. This kill brought the tally to two 75’s in two days.
6 Troop relieved 8 Troop and next day were shelled heavily
by about 140 rounds of 155-mm., the troop leader, Lt Bill
Roughton, being wounded in the shoulder; but, he remained on
duty for three days before being evacuated. This shelling was


apparently in preparation for a strong enemy attack, for as the
tanks and infantry were forming up on the track preparatory to
resuming the advance, the Nip let fly with some very heavy
automatic fire from just outside the perimeter. Some of the
tank crews were being briefed on the road when the Jap opened
up and there was a wild scramble for cover. However, crew
commander, Cpl Lindsay Mathieson, weighing every ounce of
15 J stone, in a death-defying leap gained the top of the turret
and, putting his hands above his head and completely ignoring
the possibilities of personal damage, jumped straight through
the hatch without touching a thing, thus disproving the theory
that you can’t put a square peg in a round hole. Crew com-
mander Cpl Jack Marmion also gained his tank without per-
sonal injury. The tanks moved out in front of the infantry and
engaged the enemy. However, all this time a Juki M.M.G. was
pounding the rear of the position. Lt Bill Roughton, oblivious
of the lead that was flying thick and fast, directed one of his
tanks to a position from which it could engage the Juki. A
Company of 24 Bn moved forward and counter-attacked the
enemy position, causing the latter to blow through. Enemy killed,
58; equipment captured, 2 L.M.G.s, 20 rifles, 2 pistols, 3 swords.
The advance continued to the Hongorai without further
opposition, but one of 6 Troop’s tanks fell into a shell-hole and
in the process of recovering it, both sponsons were wrenched
out—“a most unusual deed”. Cpl Bill Corr’s tank of F.H.Q.
Troop replaced it. During the advance down the Buin Road a
similar move had been taking place on the left flank. On 18th
April, when Anderson’s Junction had been secured, 9 Troop
started moving north-west with a company of 24 Bn, and over
the next few days cleared the road up as far as Hatai, contacting
companies of 58/59 Bn who were taking over from 9 Bn. The Jap
was active against the infantry patrols in this area but always
steered clear of the tanks. 10 Troop moved through 9, who
returned to Buin Road on 29th April and advanced with 57/60
Bn to reach the Hongorai in the foothills to the north. Much to
their disgust no contact was made with the Nip, and owing to
the bad nature of the country east of the Hongorai crossing they
were unable to continue with 57/60 Bn. On 20th May they
returned to the Buin Road after almost a month spent in looking
for a scrap and some twelve miles of track covered.
The line of the Hongorai was the first objective of Brig.
Hammer’s 15 Bde advance and was reached on 7th May-three
weeks after taking over from 7 Bde.

CHAPTER IX
HONGORAI AND PORORAI
The Hongorai River having been reached, the next operation
was to secure the two rivers Hongorai and Pororai, which
formed a junction some 1800 yards south of the main Buin
Road. Briefly the plot was for 24 Bn with 6, 9 and F.H.Q. Troops
to do a right hook and secure the road as far as the Pororai
River. 58/59 Bn with 7, 8 and 10 Troops were to make an even
wider flanking move to the south and secure the road for a
thousand yards east of Pororai River. After patrolling from Bth
to 14th May, the first move was made by 6 Troop (with a tank of
F.H.Q.) with infantry of 24 Bn, who crossed the Hongorai and
proceeded down the Buin Road. A few hundred yards forward
of the ford, enemy were contacted on high ground on the north
side of the road. A log obstacle was destroyed by 3-in. howitzer
fire. A little further on, the point tank bellied on a log. The
second tank gave support, and an infantry screen moved out
while the crew endeavoured to free the tank. When engine
trouble occurred W. 0.11 Jack Wakeling and his crew of mech-
anics were called forward. The crew of the F.H.Q. tank which
was in reserve some 70 yards back, dismounted for a breather.
At this stage the Jap made a determined attack on the for-
ward tanks at the road block. Infantry and tanks immediately
engaged the enemy. The crew of the third tank hastened to
mount. The last member of the crew, Tpr Harold Hole, was
lowering himself into the tank and Cpl Corr had manned the
rear phone, when a 150-mm. shell hit the tank at the base
of the turret. The driver Leigh Cusack, who was closing his flap
received a fractured skull, operator Charlie Whiteford who was
closing his flap suffered severe concussion and received shrap
wounds in his arm, and Harold Hole was killed instantly. Cpl
Bill Corr was hit by blast and sat down heavily.
The shelling continued and W.O. Wakeling was killed by a
shell-burst—a tremendous loss to the Sqn workshops. Tpr Freddie
Sherwell was cut in the head by shrap.
E


On 18th May all units were in position and next morning
the push forward commenced. F.H.Q. Troop with a platoon of
infantry created a diversion to the north of the crossing by
seemingly preparing a road to Martin’s Crossing and also firing
off everything they had, from 3-in. howitzer to small arms, pistols
and Very pistols. It was a great din and apparently deceived the
large Nip force at Martin’s Crossing. While this deception was
carried out, 9 Troop, with portion of 24 Bn, moved to the right
and crossed the Hongorai 1300 yards south of the Buin Road.
Later in the day F.H.Q. Troop moved down and joined them.
On 20th May 6 Troop and infantry moved down Buin Road
and engaged the strong enemy position on Egan’s Ridge. This
ridge dominated the road and was strongly held with an
elaborate trench system and M.G. posts. Tanks, infantry, air and
artillery hammered this position while 9 and F.H.Q. Troops
with 24 Bn carried out their right hook. The move was through
dense jungle, engineer dozer preparing the way. Heavy opposi-
tion including mines and shelling was encountered before the
road was reached, thus jamming the enemy force on Egan’s
Ridge between F.H.Q. and 6 Troops.
Next day F.H.Q. Troop turned left to clear the Nip off
Egan’s Ridge and ran into a great number of mines and booby
traps on the road. The engineers successfully deloused these,
although Cpl “Husky” Harant’s point tank’s track was broken
by a 75-mm. shell, and the crew had to mend it while covered by
the other tanks and infantry. Slight opposition was experienced,
but Egan’s Ridge was occupied without difficulty, the Nip having
departed. On reaching the road 9 Troop turned right and
moved towards the Pororai Ford. On approaching the ford, there
was a great scatter when 75-mm., M.M.G. and L.M.G. opened up
at point blank range from the high ground on the other side of
the river. The tanks engaged the position and the Nip added
some 150-mm. shells to the picture. Finally, when the tanks shut
down, the Nip also closed up and 9 Troop with D Company
settled in for the night. A Company, who had moved across the
river, also drew crabs from this position and in spite of tank
supporting fire, they had to withdraw for the night; they gained
their objective next morning. 3-in. howitzer fire by 9 Troop in
the evening of 21st May accounted for one 70-mm. gun and a
double-barrelled machine gun.
In the meantime 58/59 Bn with 7 and 8 Troops were carrying
out an even deeper right flank move. Crossing the Hongorai
below the junction of the two rivers on 21st May, they bashed


through some most difficult country before reaching the Aitara
Track, which they used for the advance to Buin Road. A few
hundred yards east of the river they were faced with an escarp-
ment which was an obstacle to both tanks and the bulldozer.
However, the workshops D 8 tractor was able to winch itself up
and it then towed the bulldozer up, the latter making a cutting
which the tanks were able to climb. A good example of team
work.
While this was being carried out, the infantry encountered a
strong enemy position containing about 100 Japs, a few hundred
yards ahead on the Aitara Track. 7 Troop pushed forward as
soon as they had climbed the escarpment and engaged the Nips
with Besa, 2-pdr and 3-inch howitzer. The Jap was completely
routed, leaving 12 dead, 4 L.M.G.s, one Juki M.M.G. and sundry
equipment and documents.
B Company 58/59 Bn then moved on up the Aitara Track
to the main Buin Road, thus completing the outflanking move.
They did not encounter any opposition, but when consolidating
at the junction they came under heavy artillery fire and Sgt
Royce Whatley and Tpr Stan Lyons were both slightly wounded.
Meanwhile, A and C Coys 58/59 Bn had established them-
selves astride the Buin Road between Pororai River crossing and
B Coy at the Aitara track junction. However, the Jap still had
positions on the road, so 7 Troop and a platoon of infantry
formed a fighting patrol and moved back towards the Pororai.
They encountered a strong position, and again Lt Scott moved
forward and located the positions, then brought his tanks forward
and engaged them. A 75-mm. and a Juki were destroyed by tank
fire.
Mines were encountered and destroyed by engineers or by
gun fire, and the patrol pushed on, opening the road back to
Pororai crossing where 7 Troop joined A Coy 24 Bn. This posi-
tion was shelled by Jap 150- and 75-mm. guns, and the troop was
most fortunate when, with about nine men sheltering under the
tank, a 150-mm. shell hit the track low down and did not explode.
The fact that the track was broken did not cause any alarm,
compared with what might have happened.
Incidentally, the action of 7 Troop 0.C., Lt Gordon Scott,
during this hectic day was referred to in the citation which
resulted in his being awarded an M.C. 10 Troop, who it will be
recalled, had been sitting waiting for a scrap for some weeks,
moved through and pushed north up Hammer Track (named
after Brig. H. H. Hammer, Comd. 15 Bde). Next day they moved


with a patrol which made contact with 57/60 Bn in the north.
Mines and booby traps were encountered; the troop leader put
his foot in the centre of three booby traps unknowingly, but did
not set them off. Otherwise no opposition was found. 10 Troop
couldn’t buy a fight.
On 22nd May the workshops D 8 tractor was moving back via
the Aitara Track, accompanied by an escort. Suddenly a 47-mm.
tank-attack gun opened up on it, putting a round through the
engine and the winch. The driver simply flew to the ground, the
escort, who were Squadron B Ech. men, immediately engaged
the gun crew, and infantry from a neighbouring perimeter came
to their rescue. The gun was destroyed, the crew departed and
the tractor struggled home under its own power, en route for
heavy repairs in workshops.
In recognition of the work done by the tanks, and particularly
by their squadron leader, Major Ken Arnott, the ford over the
Hongorai was named Arnott’s Crossing.


CHAPTER X
“H.Q.” AND “A” SQUADRONS
ARRIVE
At this stage A Sqn and H.Q. Sqn arrived from Madang. When
C Sqn left for 6 Div. at Aitape and B departed for Bougain-
ville, these two squadrons had remained at Madang with
Brig. Ferguson’s 8 Bde, who had a holding role at Hansa Bay.
Infantry-tank training was continued, a small percentage of
troops went on leave, and nearly every man spent a period in hos-
pital with dengue owing to an epidemic sweeping through the
area. With no fight in sight morale was very low, but once B Sqn
went into ops and the tempo indicated they could not continue
all the way to Buin, the C.O. arranged with H.Q. First Army that
these two squadrons should move to Bougainville to relieve B
Squadron, and, possibly, provide tanks in the north of the island,
near Buka.
Morale immediately jumped to a high level and early in May
they moved to Torokina by American L.S.T.; it was the first time
we had used these large landing craft and the voyage evoked
considerable interest.
The trip to Bougainville was enlivened by the spray from the
latrine situated right forward on the deck of the L.S.T. Water
from a hose flowed continually through the structure and was
carried over the side by a galvanised iron gutter. The scheme
worked excellently in port, but fell down badly as soon as the
voyage commenced. The wind caught the water as it left the
gutter and blew it back on board as a fine spray. Tents, beds,
and gear were soon drenched, and the howls of the victims
resulted in the latrine being moved to the opposite side of the
ship.
It operated better there, although a small quantity of spray
still blew back on board. But as Sgt-Major Dave Findlay was the
only one affected, no one worried but Dave himself, and he
couldn’t do much about it.


On arrival, three A Sqn troops immediately moved to Toko
area, the remaining troops staying in the perimeter pending a
decision whether they should go north or south. After Lt Hugh
Ross had done some good recce and liaison work in the north,
it was decided to send them south. A Sqn carried out training
with 29 Bde units, who were guarding the L. of C. behind 15 Bde,
modified their tanks, and generally put their house in order
preparatory to joining battle. A regimental tactical H.Q. was
established near A Squadron at Galvin’s Crossing, beside the
Puriata River. The heavy part of H.Q. Sqn, A Sqn Ordnance
sub-park and H.Q. Workshops remained at Torokina, where they
were able to receive a lot of new equipment and where they were
in touch with the big equipment and stores parks. They also
handled the Regiment’s reinforcements when they arrived from
the mainland and assisted in preparing the flame-throwing
tanks.


CHAPTER XI
PEPERU-HARI-OGORATA
Having successfully secured the Hongorai and Pororai, the next
move was to push forward to the Hari River which constituted
a major obstacle some four miles on. Early in June, after a week
of reorganisation, the advance commenced with 58/59 Bn sup-
ported by 9 Troop on the Buin Road, and 57/60 Bn with
F.H.Q. Troop in support moving parallel to them on the north-
ern axis. Preceded by Corsair dive bombing and artillery shelling,
9 Troop at first encountered little opposition. However tank
ditches, bomb craters and fallen trees delayed the advance and
required assistance from the engineers and the bulldozer. The
enemy had blown the light bridges that crossed several small
creeks and on 2nd June the Covenanter bridge-laying tank,
driven by Jack Rolfe (a veteran of the Royal Tank Corps of
1920) was first used. The bridge was laid in eleven minutes and
the tanks crossed; however, considerable difficulty was ex-
perienced in picking the bridge up again. Meanwhile the in-
fantry and 9 Troop moved on, clearing scattered resistance, and
striking obstacles and mines.
A heavier position was encountered, and when the tanks shot
up a native hut with Besa fire, they disclosed a 75-mm. gun set
up as a tank-attack gun. The infantry, supported by the tanks,
moved in, and captured the gun but found the crew gone. Besides
the 75-mm. gun, a machine gun, two bodies and a prisoner were
taken. That night the troop encountered the usual hostile shell-
ing. Meanwhile, Lt Peter Nicholl’s F.H.Q. Troop moved on with
57/60 Bn meeting very light opposition, through most difficult
terrain and accurate enemy artillery concentrations. Although
the Jap was able to observe the movement of this force and
direct mortar and artillery fire on to it, he made no serious
attempt to attack.
On the Buin Road 10 Troop took over from 9 Troop, and
pushed forward with 6 Troop close behind. Although they were


repeatedly shelled while halted in perimeters, no casualties were
incurred. An enemy position was encountered and Sgt Ted
Moyle’s tank engaged, while the Jap returned fire with tank-
attack rifle and small arms. The tank fire forced the enemy to
withdraw leaving a 22-mm. Breda Tk/A rifle, a Juki M.G.,
numerous rifles, one sword and two bodies. Late in the after-
noon of the same day contact was made with the enemy in
strength in two well-dug-in concealed positions on either side
of the road. After a plastering by the tanks the infantry moved
in, capturing numerous packs, rifles, equipment and a Juki. It
was too late to occupy the position that night, and they estab-
lished their perimeter forward of it, being shelled by 150-mm.
guns in the early hours of the morning. Next day they found a
small party of Nips back in the position. Tank and infantry
fire quickly silenced them and, on moving in, the infantry found
a sword and six more packs.
6 Troop moved through 10, and followed a creeping artillery
barrage to the Mamagota track junction, without encountering
opposition. 10 Troop swung north up the Taitai track, halting
short of the Peperu River crossing. The latter gets a special
mention for it was here that next day, without prior infantry
patrolling, the C.O. (Lt-Col. Mills), Major Arnott, the R.Q.M.,
(Capt Doug Green), troop leader (Lt Joe Dent), O.C. B Sqn
Workshops (Capt. Don Hill), C.O. 58/59 Bn, and all sorts of
other people stood watching engineers plucking mines from the
creek bed. Suddenly the Jap opened up on them from the
opposite bank with Juki, L.M.G.s and rifles. Irrespective of rank
all hit the ground very smartly and apparently caused so much
dust that the Jap missed all the tankers. Unfortunately, two
infantry scouts were caught.
The following day 10 Troop, with A Coy 58/59 Bn attempted
to hack a way through the jungle from the Mamagota junction
to the Buin Road crossing over the Hari. Moving off with a
dozen cutting a path they crossed the Peperu River and then
three other small creeks. The going was particularly slow, the
dozer working solidly. About 200 yards past the Peperu they
encountered a creek and then a thirty foot escarpment. The in-
fantry started to climb the escarpment to secure it prior to dozing
a crossing. About halfway up, they were fired on from well
concealed and dug-in positions on top of the escarpment, from
where the Jap was able to sweep the area below with fire. The
troop leader, Lt Dent, worked his tanks into position and engaged
the enemy with intense fire, allowing our infantry to withdraw


and reorganise, but leaving the dozer unattended in the centre
of the field of fire. It was decided to withdraw to enable artillery
to shell the position. The troop started to move back, but Cpl
Alf Cooper’s tank became stuck. Sgt Moyle’s tank was hooked
on and towed it out. It was then decided to recover the dozer
and, although in full view of the enemy some fifty yards away,
Lt Dent, and the engineer officer, Lt Dunstan, attached the tow
rope and covered by tank fire the dozer was towed out of the
danger area. Next day, following artillery and mortar “softening
up”, this position was taken and the force moved on until it was
halted by impossible country. The idea was abandoned, and the
force moved back to the Mamagota junction.
9 Troop supported B Coy 58/59 Bn across the main Peperu
Ford. Only after very heavy tank fire had been brought down on
the far side of the ford, was the infantry able to occupy the Jap
position there. Once this was occupied, the force pushed on up
the road, encountering many mines, one of which broke a tank
track, at the same time lifting the tank in the air and shaking the
crew up. Meanwhile F.H.Q. Troop with 57/60 Bn had encount-
ered several enemy positions which they were able to silence and
occupy. In addition 8 Troop carried out an armoured patrol
down Mamagota track to the coast. Except for a heavy attack
by sandflies and mosquitoes the patrol was uneventful. At this
stage patrols thoroughly probed the Hari River defences, and
the stage was set for another wide outflanking move to secure
the Hari and Ogorata Rivers. A Sqn came into the picture when,
as the first stage of relieving B Squadron, 1 (Lt Harry Holliday),'
3 (Lt Don Fraser) and 5 (Lt Don Humphreys) Troops came under
command B Squadron and 7, 8 and 9 Troops withdrew to the
Hongorai for a spell and re-fit.
6 Troop under Sgt Jack Knight moved out to the north with
a party from 57/60 Bn on a wide outflanking move of some
14,000 yards. The force was known as Scott Armoured Patrol.
They had a long and adventurous trip, carrying all their supplies
with them. They encountered numerous engineering problems
and frequently engaged the enemy in well prepared positions.
On one occasion whilst they were repairing a sig. cable, two
shells from a Nip 75-mm. landed close to the party but without
damage. Cpl Lindsay Mathieson saw the flash of the gun about
150 yds down the track and two tanks moved out and engaged
the area, forcing the gun crew to “blow through”. The gun was
captured and towed behind the tanks for some time, but


eventually it was too much nuisance and it was destroyed. On
the eighth day the troop reached Buin Road again.
Meanwhile 58/59 Bn with F.H.Q. and 10 Troops (B Sqn) and
3 and 5 Troops (A Sqn) forced a crossing over the Hari by a
“left hook” on the north side of the Buin Road. This was
preceded by a very noisy diversionary action south of the Buin
Road by 1 Troop and a platoon of A Coy 24 Bn. This was 1
Troop’s first assignment and if noise was required, they certainly
did their job; on this day 25 belts of Besa, 18 2-pdr, 21 3-in.
howitzers were fired, nearly all by 1 Troop on this job.
In addition, prior to the actual advance, the Hari defences
were subjected to an intense artillery, bombing and mortar
programme. This undoubtedly assisted in unbalancing the
enemy, for his resistance to the pressure of our ground troops was
not sufficient to hold them up.
5 and 10 Troops with 58/59 Bn’s Pike Force crossed the Hari
well north of the Buin Road ford, turned south and drove in on
the Buin Road approximately 2000 yards past the ford. During
the move there was no track and the dozer and tanks, sup-
ported by infantry, made their own track through the jungle.
No movement was sighted until the Buin Road was reached,
when an enemy L.M.G. opened up and was silenced by Besa
fire from 5 Troop tanks commanded by Sgt Ralph Berman and
Cpl Jack Derrin. F.H.Q. Troop supporting D Coy 58/59 Bn
moved south to cut the Buin Road between the Hari River ford
and Pike Force’s objective. The first day they struck opposition,
which was silenced; however they were held up by a bad creek
crossing. The following day after contacting enemy and brush-
ing them aside, the force reached the Buin Road and turned
west, coming in on the rear of the Jap positions covering the
ford. This the tanks engaged with heavy fire and next day 3
Troop were able to move along the Buin Road and cross the
ford.
On reaching the Buin Road, 5 and 10 Troops had parted.
5 Troop moved S.E. along Buin Road for about 600 yards, en-
countering intermittent fire from the enemy. Sgt Berman, crew
commander of the leading tank, thought he saw a mine on the
road and halted his driver just short of it. Searching the ground
to either side the driver asked whether he could see a wheel-like
object in a clearing to the right of the road—also some logs. Just
as the tank halted Sgt Berman had another look, and there was
a mighty flash in front of him; the tank shuddered and all the
periscopes blacked out from fumes and mud. Sgt Berman cleaned


his scope and was just in time to see another flash and the old
Tilly gave another shudder as a great explosion occurred outside.
Having no doubt in his mind that there was a heavy gun firing
from about 50 yards Sgt Berman swung his gunner on to the
target and did it over with Besa and 2-pdr. Suddenly there was
a great explosion in the gun position, followed by a cloud of
white smoke as the position blew up. On investigation it proved
to be a 150-mm. (6-inch) gun in a large gunpit and apparently
while the tank was engaging it some of the loose propellent
charges had gone up, killing several members of the crew, wreck-
ing the gunpit with its crew sleeping quarters and ammunition
bays, and making the gun unserviceable. The tank had a mangled
skirting over the tracks and many rivets were sprung. However
it was able to drive home under its own steam. During this action,
when the Besa had a stoppage, gunner George Flanigan found a
projectile stuck in the barrel. George pulled the projectile from
a good round, took his chewing gum from his mouth, plugged
the gum into the good cartridge, placed it in the chamber and
fired. This cleaned the bore, the Besa went on firing. Chewing
gum is also good for the teeth and gums.
10 Troop turned south-east down the Buin Road with A
Coy 58/59 Bn, striking light opposition and destroying two
small enemy positions. The road behind them was now open
right back to the Peperu. 3 Troop cleared the enemy position
covering the Hari River ford. Contact was established with
6 Troop and 57/60 Bn and 3 Troop relieved 6 Troop, 2 Troop
(Lt Spence Curley) moving up and taking over from B Squad-
ron’s F.H.Q. Troop. This left only 10 Troop of B Squadron.
After crossing the Ogorata, 10 Troop continued the advance on
their last day before being relieved; suddenly the point tank
was blown up by a very well camouflaged mine which had been
hidden in a culvert. The tank was badly damaged, the driver
Tim Dunstan was killed instantly, and crew commander Cpl
Alf Cooper, gunner Joe Starrs and operator Jack Arnold were
all badly wounded. Tpr Nangle, Lt Dent’s escort, was also in-
jured by the explosion. The nose of the tank was buried in the
side of the crater so that the gun was level with the ground.
3 Troop took over from 10, and only 50 yards beyond the
disabled tank, the supporting engineers removed a mine. After
advancing a further quarter-mile Cpl Flanagan’s tank, which was
leading, was engaged by a Jap 150-mm. gun at about 300 yards
over open sights. The shot hit the front of the tank, blowing in
the driver’s periscope and killing the driver, Tpr Len Dew. The


explosion jammed the crew commander’s hatch and flames leapt
feet from the tank. The tank had stopped, and a second shot
from the 150-mm. missed the tank, landing close to the sup-
porting tank. Lt Don Fraser, the troop leader, was rushing for-
ward to assist the disabled tank when the explosion threw him
high in the air and landed him on the side of the road; he was
injured and had to be evacuated. A third shot hit the point tank
again, opening the hatches and allowing crew commander Cpl
Flanagan to climb out, followed by Tpr Arkley-Smith. Both were
badly burnt and dazed; the gunner, Eric Herfort, followed close
behind, and all three with their troop leader were immediately
evacuated to medical services. Tpr Arkley-Smith died later from
his injuries. The enemy engaged a party who were trying to
recover the tank and it was necessary to withdraw slightly from
the fire of the 150-mm. gun, and the garrison which was sup-
porting it.
At this stage A Squadron took over completely from B, A
Squadron’s F.H.Q. Troop (Lt Colin Salmon) replacing 10 Troop,
who with 6 and B Squadron’s F.H.Q. Troop pulled back to a
rear area for a well earned rest. Capt. Mat. (later Major) Robin-
son, O.C. A Squadron, who had been up with B Squadron’s 0.C.,
Major Arnott, for some time, assumed command of the troops.
1 Troop moved through and took over from 3, facing the enemy
150-mm. gun position. Reconnaissance showed that there was a
well prepared enemy position supporting the gun and patrols
sent out to destroy it were unable to get in close. Heavy artillery
fire, a large mortar concentration, and an air-strike from N.Z.A.F.
Corsairs failed to dislodge the enemy, or to destroy the gun,
both being well dug in. Lt Harry Holliday, troop leader of
1 Troop, was very enthusiastic about engaging the gun with
indirect fire from the 3-in. howitzer tanks, fire control to be given
from an Auster aircraft which regularly flew around the enemy
positions passing back information. This did not take place, but
the troop leader did engage the gun with indirect howitzer fire
from one of his tanks, giving fire control by Walkie Talkie
from a forward position. After he had put across 24 rounds of
H.E. and 5 belts of Besa the Nip let fly with a “knee” mortar
at the spot from which he was observing—the tank was out of
sight. Fortunately, the round was a dud, and Harry made a very
rapid withdrawal, managing to dodge a round from the 150-mm.
which closely followed the “knee” mortar. The Nip, as was his
habit when he knew where our company areas were, then


proceeded to introduce 1 Troop to another aspect of the war
when he plastered their area for some time with shell fire.
It was a strange thing, but this troop appeared to have an
attraction for shell fire, for right up to the end, very few days
passed when they didn’t have to dive deep. They were not the
only troop to be shelled, but they certainly had their fair share.
No casualties were suffered by the troop.
As all efforts failed to destroy the gun which made further
tank movement down the Buin Road impossible, infantry, en-
gineers and 1 Troop carried out a small outflanking move to the
south, “scrub-bashing” their way through the jungle. On striking
back to the road behind the enemy position, the Nip pulled out,
destroying the gun before doing so.
While the troops on the road had been held up for three days,
A Company of 57/60 Bn had moved wide off the road, to a
position near the Buin Road ford over the Mobiai—some 2000
yards further on. 2 Troop under Lt Spence Curley was detailed
to “scrub-bash” through to them, to bolster up their perimeter.
2 Troop with infantry and engineer escort left first thing Mon-
day morning, reached their destination on the Thursday after-
noon—four days for a little over a mile—after building numerous
crossings and finding ways through bogs and all sorts of obstacles
—not forgetting positions recently vacated by the Nip. The going
was so slow that it was not possible to get from one company
perimeter in a day so the tanks and bulldozer would move out,
cut a track, make a crossing or so and then have to return to
the company position. Next morning the crossing would be
washed away and it would have to be repaired. The dozer’s
breaking down on one occasion did not assist matters.
On 23rd June 5 Troop moved through 1 Troop on the Buin
Road and late in the afternoon with a company of 57/60 Bn en-
gaged an enemy party of unknown strength. Next day, after
advancing only 100 yards their infantry-tank team encountered a
well prepared enemy position covering the road. A well-cut fire
lane suggested a heavy weapon. A large concentration of fire was
poured into the area and then Cpl Alex Brun’s tank was moved
up to the fire lane to execute the “coup de grace” with 2-pounder
fire. The Nip was still fighting however, and managed to hit the
tank four times with a 37-mm. Tk/A gun. Before the tank was
able to make cover, an artillery concentration was brought down
after which the tank moved in again, plastering the gun position
with 2-pounder and Besa. With the tanks giving supporting fire,
the infanteers attacked, and although twice forced back from the


objective by heavy opposition, the third time they were success-
ful and the greater portion of the position was cleared. The
Jap gun and crew were destroyed. This was the last major opposi-
tion encountered on Buin Road before the Mobiai River was
reached and 1 and 5 Troops were moved back almost to the
Ogorata as the first stage of a “left hook” which was to take
15 Inf. Bde forward to the next objective—the Mivo River.
Meanwhile, 4 Troop (Lt George Joss) was on the flank, some
five miles north of Buin Road, in an area called Kingori. The
troop had moved out on 17th June to join a force of 24 Bn who
had established a patrol base to cover the left flank of the Buin
Road operations. The force was commanded by Capt. Stuart
Graham, who was an old friend of A Squadron, having been
adjutant of 11 Armd Car Regt in the early days of 1 Armd Div.
During the week that it was with Graham Force several members
of the troop went out with the infantry recce patrols, including
the troop leader who, on 20th June, was with a patrol which was
ambushed by some thirty odd Japs; he escaped without hurt. The
track from the Buin Road to this company position was long and
lonely, and Cfn Tom Doak, of A Sqn Workshops, spent many
anxious hours on it. He went up and down twice, taking up
replenishment for the tanks, and on the first occasion bringing
a prisoner; on the second trip some of our wounded infanteers;
on all occasions he had an escort, but, as all who travelled by
jeep on those lonely jungle tracks know, slowly bumping along,
waiting for a Nip ambush to open up on you is not pleasant.


CHAPTER XII
MOBIAI-MIVO-KILLEN’S TRACK
The Mobiai having been reached, 15 Bde prepared for its next
leap, which had as its objective the line of the Mivo River, some
three miles ahead. The plot was somewhat similar to the Hongorai
and Hari operations in that one battalion held the enemy on
the main Buin Road while the remainder of the Brigade moved
round wide to a flank, came in behind the enemy positions and
then cleared back along the road. This time 57/60 Bn crossed
the Mobiai River some 2000 yards north of the Buin Road, moved
almost due east to Killen’s Track on the west bank of the Mivo
River, and turned south, reaching the Buin Road near the ford
over the Mivo. 24 Bn crossed the Mobiai at the same place as
57/60 Bn, then struck down to the Buin Road at a place
about halfway between the Mobiai and the Mivo. These two
battalions then cleared back to 58/59 Bn who forced the Buin
Road crossing over the Mobiai.
Five troops of A Squadron were involved in this operation.
1 and 5 Troops were allotted to 57/60 Bn and F.H.Q. Troop
(Lt Salmon), which was initially allotted to 24 Bn but which was
unable to move through the terrain allotted it, joined the Bn for
the drive south. 4 Troop was under command 24 Bn and 2 Troop
with 58/59 Bn on the Buin Road. Unfortunately considerable
rain fell during the later half of June and the movement of
these troops was very seriously troubled by the sodden ground.
Preparatory moves commenced on 25th June when 1, 5 and
F.H.Q. Troops, all packed high with their own and the support-
ing infantry’s stores, and in certain cases, dragging jeep trailers
behind the tanks, moved north and then across the Mobiai to
an assembly area. The next days were busy ones for 1 and 5
Troops, as the engineers and tank crews worked their way
across towards Killen’s Track. “Scrub-bashing” and corduroying
were the order of the day, in one place 200 yards of corduroy
being necessary to get the tanks across a swamp area. At 0545


hours on 29th June—“the” day—the tank crews packed in the
moonlight for the move off shortly after first light. Dumping the
trailers, the tanks, with engineers and infantry, “scrub-bashed”
the remaining distance to Killen’s Track and swung south, tanks
leading. Picking up the start line, which was marked by a bar-
rage put down by our artillery, they moved slowly down the
overgrown track, preceded by a creeping artillery barrage.
Although movement was seen on two occasions, no fire was
exchanged and the advance continued to the Buin Road unop-
posed.
Meanwhile, 4 Troop had moved down from Graham Force at
Kingori and joined F.H.Q. Troop and 24 Bn in the assembly
area east of the Mobiai. It was here that Cpl Bob Holcombe
caused some excitement when his foot became entangled in the
cable of a smoke discharger, laying a smoke screen on the east
bank of the Mobiai. The following day he amputated the little
finger of his left hand by dropping a tank louvre on it. On 27th
June, 4 and F.H.Q. Troops commenced their southward move
to the “forming up position”, for the drive to the Buin Road on
the 29th. Unfortunately, they found approximately 200 Japs in a
strong position covering the reconnoitred route; as our fofce
could not become embroiled at this juncture, a detour was neces-
sary, and this put the tanks into some very bad country. Our
artillery engaged the enemy position. After a day’s breather on
the 28th the tanks, with their companions, set off on the 29th
to “scrub-bash” through to the Buin Road. The heavy rain
during the last few days and nights had considerably altered the
texture of the ground. The tanks and bulldozers were con-
stantly bogged, and despite the efforts of the engineers and the
tank crews it became evident by the middle of the morning that,
if the objective was to be attained by the time stipulated, the
infantry would have to go on ahead without the tanks. This was
done, and leaving a small party of infantry with the tanks and
engineers, the company pushed on. In the case of F.H.Q. Troop,
after five minutes’ movement the dozer and two tanks were
bogged, and after three hours’ going they had covered 150 yards
and the ground was becoming worse. So the plan was changed,
and the troop moved across to 57/60 Bn on Killen’s Track.
However, 4 Troop struggled on and finally reached A Coy 24 Bn
on the Buin Road at 1400 hours on 29th June-approximately
one day behind time. It was a heartbreaking journey and the
tank crews and engineers worked magnificently to get the tanks
through when they did. It was a grim ending when, that after-

THE REGATTA AT MILILAT.


noon, the dozer crew who were moving back along the Buin
Road, were hit by a Nip 150-mm. sited for tank attack about 30
yards off the road. Four engineers were killed, and four wounded.
On 25th June 2 Troop with 58/59 Bn, moved forward to
the D Coy perimeter which was on the west bank of the Mobiai.
During the next few days they were shelled repeatedly by
accurate Jap fire, but were able to reciprocate to some degree
when a mortar platoon used the tank wireless to maintain com-
munications with an Auster aircraft for registration of fire.
On 28th June A Coy of 58/59 Bn crossed the river against heavy
opposition. The tanks were preparing to assist, but the company
eventually was able to get all its personnel across and consolidate
on the east bank, where the tanks joined them later in the day.
There were obviously large numbers of Japs on the east side of
the river and the tanks were shelled while fording and also in
the perimeter which was forward on the other side. The fact that
any foxholes or slit trenches quickly filled with water made it
most uncomfortable during the shelling.
The crossing having been effected, the next phase was for
58/59 Bn to push on down the Buin Road to link up with 24 Bn.
On 29th June, the day that the “left hook” was due to reach
the road, 2 Troop moved out from the company perimeter with
engineers and infantry to clear approximately 1000 yards of the
road forward to 24 Bn. They had moved only about 100 yards
when a large mine was blown a short distance in front by the
leading tank, the infantry at the same time being engaged by
machine gun and rifle fire. Troop leader Spence Curley, who
was on foot, found his Walkie Talkie wireless had gone dead on
him, and despite the enemy fire directed at the tanks, controlled
the fire of the first tank from a phone passed out of the turret
of the second. The tank supporting fire undoubtedly assisted our
infantry in extricating themselves from a most unsavoury posi-
tion and the party returned to the company perimeter to re-
organise. On arrival it was found that two men were missing,
both believed wounded. Lt Curley offered to take a tank out
to assist in recovering these men and a party was arranged
However, with the Walkie Talkie set out of action and the
internal communication of the tank faulty through the heavy
rain, he found it necessary to back the tank up the road (so that
the driver could see him) and control its movement by hand
signals from where he was standing in the gutter. The presence
of the old Tilly apparently kept the Nips quiet, for the party
were able to recover the two men from the undergrowth near
F


the road; one was wounded, the other dead. The party was re-
organised and pushed forward 300 yards to a small escarpment
which commanded the road both to the east and to the west.
The troops spent the night on the escarpment and next morning
returned to the positions near the river.
The road was heavily mined in this area and the bomb disposal
engineers, led by Lt Woodward, who was awarded a D.S.O. for
his work in Bougainville, were kept busy. These boys did a
remarkable job; briefly it consisted of walking down a track
through the jungle, in front of the tanks, with infantry creeping
through the undergrowth on their flanks, while they prodded an
old bayonet into the ground to feel if there were any mines
there. The fact that the first sight that the Jap would have of
the approach of our troops was that of a tank rolling down the
road with a man walking in front brandishing a bayonet and
frequently stopping while he deloused and pulled up a mine,
didn’t appear to worry these fellows. Towards the end we cap-
tured instructions that special Jap parties were to be detailed
to deal with the bomb disposal personnel preceding the tanks,
but the war finished before these were put into effect. We cer-
tainly dip our lids to Woodward and his mates, Who unearthed
many mines from in front of our tanks in this manner. On the
afternoon of 30th June it was found that the Jap had re-occupied
on the escarpment and ambushed one of our parties. Out went
2 Troop to their assistance and five Japs joined their ancestors.
According to a prisoner taken, they had been in heavy bunker
positions no more than five yards from the wire of our troop’s
previous night’s perimeter. When all was quiet the troop, with
its infantry escort, returned to the bottom of the escarpment.
Next day, Ist July, the troop participated in an armoured
patrol forward to 24 Bn and once again encountered Japs on the
escarpment. It was here that crew commander Cpl Bert Way,
already renowned throughout the troop and the infantry com-
pany as an inveterate Jap hunter, scored his first “solo”. From
his turret in the second tank he saw a Nip move in a foxhole by
the road, obviously passed over by our infantry escort. So, open-
ing up, he poked himself out of the turret and tossed in a
grenade, most expediently dealing with the situation, and becom-
ing very much the hero of the infanteers. On 2nd July, Brigadier
Simpson’s 29 Bde commenced the relief of 15 Bde, 15 Bn taking
over from 57/60 Bn in the Shishigatero area near the Mivo ford;
42 Bn moving into the area along the Buin Road between the


Mobiai and the Mivo, and 47 Bn being responsible for the left
flank.
Although our troops were as far forward as the Mivo River,
the Jap was still very active both to the north and south of the
road as far back as the Mobiai. The road itself, in bad condition
owing to the heavy rains, and repeatedly mined, was not open
to jeep traffic, nor was it possible to relieve the forward tank
troops who had been in contact for three weeks. From the time
1 Troop with C Coy 57/60 Bn established its perimeter near the
Buin Road-Killen’s Track junction on the afternoon of 29th
June till they were moved back to the squadron workshops area
on 6th July, they were regularly shelled two or three times daily
by Nip 75-mm. and 150-mm. guns. Jap parties were very evident
around the perimeter and several attempts to get in were made.
It was therefore with considerable pleasure that the troop set off
for the rear maintenance area where they could get clean dry
clothes, good food, and a reasonable night’s sleep.
F.H.Q. Troop, who were also in the Shishigatero area with
57/60 Bn, were awakened early in the morning of 2nd July by a
heavy explosion at the front of one of their tanks. When day-
light came it was found that an enterprising Nip had crept into
the perimeter and placed a mine on the tank, blowing away part
of the track gear, plus some armour plate. This was the only
time that an attack of this kind was successful, although at first
light our troops frequently found dead Japs with slabs of picric
acid or mines on the edge or inside the perimeter wire. D Coy
47 Bn, who had established their perimeter near the junction of
Killen’s Track and Lawn’s Track, were heavily attacked on 3rd
July and Col. Salmon and his merry boys of F.H.Q. Troop were
called upon to take an armoured patrol up to assist them. On
arrival at the company position, they found them to be in a
serious plight; they had been under continuous, heavy fire from
about eighty Japs armed with Juki, L.M.G. and mortar since
first light and were just then preparing to ward off another
attack. A Juki opened up, and heads were pulled in while hell
was let loose. The tanks were unable to move into the perimeter
to engage the Nips because of the number of our wounded who
were lying around. Eventually the Jap quietened down long
enough to enable a way to be cleared and the tanks poured
some lead into the jungle. A patrol went out and reported
twenty-eight Jap dead and large quantities of blood and band-
ages in the undergrowth. The tanks remained with the com-
pany overnight, and at first light assisted in warding off a further


heavy attack. The infanteers were very thankful for the arrival
of the troop as their ammunition was getting low and it ap-
peared they might be over-run. However, next day 3 Troop
moved in to replace F.H.Q. Troop, and brought with them large
quantities of supplies and ammunition for the company. The
Tillies were also able to establish communications with the out-
side world, for the company was out of touch, its phone lines
having been cut, its wireless ineffective, and its three pigeons had
already been sent to ask for help. The following day, the sth,
the Jap again attacked this company in force and 3 Troop (under
Lt Hughie Ross) were able to assist in beating it back. 1 Troop
went up during the afternoon taking more ammunition and
supplies. F.H.Q. Troop visited them on the 6th and on the way
struck some opposition which was repelled with the assistance
of the infantry escort.
On this day 1 and 5 Troops moved back for some well-earned
rest, joining 2 and 4 Troops who were already at the squadron
light workshop area. On the 9th, 2 Troop replaced F.H.Q.
Troop in the Shishigatero area.
During the early days of the month it had rained frequently
and the L. of C. was in bad condition. On 17th July it started
to rain in earnest and during the next thirty-six hours over eight
inches of rain fell. All bridges on the L. of C. between Toko and
the Mivo were washed out, and all rivers flooded; the Mivo ran
a 12 knot current and was impassable. Road traffic was completely
disrupted and the only means of supply was by air dropping.
Consequently, offensive action was temporarily abandoned and
our activities were confined to infantry security and reconnais-
sance patrols. During these floods the Covenanter bridge-laying
tank laid its bridge for the second time during the campaign,
and saved the engineers considerable work as, for them, it was
an extremely busy time. It should also be recorded, at this
juncture, that Regt H.Q., on the bank of the Puriata, were very
nearly washed away as the river rose at an alarming rate. How-
ever, by grand judgment on the part of the river it did not
overflow its banks and all R.H.Q.’s valuable documents were
saved—curse it.
The last two weeks of July saw A Squadron with two troops
forward of the Mobiai, the remaining four getting their vehicles
back into tiptop order at the squadron workshops area. Our
infantry and engineers were concentrating on getting the new
road pushed forward past the Mobiai. This road was one of the
major jobs done by the engineers in southern Bougainville. Cut


through virgin jungle by means of bulldozers, graders, native
labour and sappers, it was a two-way three-ton road which
eventually stretched from Torokina perimeter around the coast
to Toko and then inland parallel to the Buin Road, a distance of
about sixty miles. The road passed over swamps and dozens of
creeks and rivers, large and small, and despite almost daily rain
which caused the surface to wash away, it was possible to main-
tain a speed of thirty to forty miles over most of it in a jeep.
It was a great achievement by the sappers and was the lifeline
of the troops forward. The heavy rain and floods in July dis-
rupted this and a terrific amount of work was required to re-estab-
lish it.
The infantry also were kept busy by a large number of Jap
patrols which were working west of the Mivo River, as far back
as the Hongorai River. These patrols had a harassing task and
caused a considerable amount of annoyance right up to, and for
a week after, cessation of hostilities. We also had patrols out
east of the Mivo feeling the way for the next leap by 29 Bde.
However, this leap did not come about, for, by the time the
L. of C. was re-established, peace was on the verge of breaking
out. So the cessation of hostilities on 15th August found 29 Bde
poised at the Mivo ready for the next move forward. A Squad-
ron under their command rested somewhat, with their tanks
serviced and ready; R.H.Q. with H.Q. 3 Div. at the Peperu Creek
just west of the Hari; B Squadron some miles further back along
the newly built Buin Road at Kekro Creek, where they had been
resting and re-organising since they were relieved almost two
months previously, and were now ready to relieve A Squadron
again should the occasion arise. 15 Bde were responsible for the
L. of C. west of the Mobiai and portion of 7 Bde had moved
down from Torokina to assist in security measures. Difficulty was
experienced in advising the Jap patrols that their government
had surrendered and for a week after the date of surrender they
were still active, particularly around R.H.Q. at the Peperu, one
night blowing a nearby bridge. However, eventually things
quietened down and towards the end of August a slight trickle
of movement of troops back to Torokina started. By mid-Septem-
ber the Regiment was concentrated in the Torokina perimeter.
Shortly after the cessation of hostilities, a call was received for
two troops of tanks to go to Rabaul, in New Britain, to assist in
security duties with the 100,000 Jap troops which had surrend-
ered. Accordingly Dent Force was formed. This consisted of
4 Troop from A Squadron, and a troop from H.Q. Squadron,


together with workshops, field park, signals and administrative
detachments under command of Capt. “Jo” Dent. With this force
went a War Office Trials team with two M 24 light tanks. They
had been testing the tanks in Bougainville, and were to be used,
if necessary, in Rabaul. The force left Bougainville by L.C.T.
on 14th September and was later built up to squadron strength
by personnel from A, B and H.Q. Squadrons in Bougainville
and called B Squadron. The story of their activities is recorded in
another chapter.


CHAPTER XIII
NORTH BOUGAINVILLE-
SCOTT FORCE
It will be recalled that when A and H.Q. Squadrons arrived in
Bougainville from Madang during May, 1945, three troops of
A Squadron were organised in Torokina for operations with
11 Aust. Inf. Bde in North Bougainville. Also Lt Hugh Ross,
A Squadron’s recce officer, was despatched up there for liaison
purposes; however, it was decided not to send the troops up and
A Squadron went south, in toto. Towards the end of June the
Regiment received a call for four tanks to be despatched to the
11 Bde area, and on 4th, 6th and Bth July 1945, in three batches,
a party consisting of four tanks, thirty regimental personnel,
eleven workshops, two sigs and two men from the Regt Ord.
Field Park, were moved by A.L.C. 40's to Soraken Plantation.
Lt R. G. Scott, who had commanded 7 Troop when B Squadron
were in action in the south, was force commander, and in the
Regiment his force was referred to as 16 Troop, or alternatively,
“Scott Force”.
In this area during the past nine months the Australian troops
had pushed up the west coast of Bougainville from the Torokina
perimeter and had forced the Japs (mostly Navy and civilians)
back to the base around Buka on the Bonis Peninsula. The Jap
troops were delaying our advance and, in addition, harassing
our toops by laying mines and ambushing our L. of C. When
Scott Force arrived in the area, they immediately set about train-
ing with platoons from 27 and 8 Inf. Bns, both of which bat-
talions were engaged in operations with the Jap. One by one the
platoons were withdrawn for a day and put through their
hoops. A demonstration of fire power was given each day and
the local engineers were kept busy building bunkers for the
tanks to demolish. After eight days of this concentrated training,
the troop on 18th July moved by barge forward to Ratsua, a
matter of about four miles. The waterfront in this area was


mainly mangrove swamp and bottomless mud, and it was neces-
sary for the engineers to corduroy a landing point well out into
the water for the tanks to come in on. One tank had considerable
trouble when leaving Soraken. Driving along the beach it
snapped part of the idler wheel assembly. A replacement part
was sent back from Ratsua, and the trouble was fixed. The tank
moved off and after travelling a short distance it snapped again.
Again a hurried call was sent for a part and Lt Andrews, the
workshops officer, came back and helped put things right. It is
strange how troubles seem to come in bundles. In due course
the whole outfit reached its destination.
On 23rd July the troop made its debut. A party of Japs had
been located on a feature called Commo Ridge and two tanks
under Lt Don Callaghan were allotted to support an attack on
it by C Coy, 27 Bn. Owing to the swampy nature of the ground
forward of the feature the tanks were unable to move on to the
objective; however, they were able to give good fire support and
the objective was gained by the infantry. Enemy casualties in-
cluded twelve killed and the tanks destroyed a Juki, so it was
quite a satisfactory day’s work, in spite of one of the tanks
becoming bogged.
The enemy did not move right away, however, for next day
a party working round the bogged tank at Commo Ridge were
engaged by a Juki. The tank returned its fire with 2-pounder
and Besa and successfully silenced it. An investigating party later
found a newly dug grave and the abandoned Juki.
The following day Don Callaghan and his two tanks moved
out on a three-day patrol with two platoons of 27 Bn to the
Ruri Bay area, where a small Jap base was located. Contact was
made on the way out, and the tanks gave the infanteers some
supporting fire to drive the Jap off. Several mines were located
by the engineers and destroyed. On arrival in the Ruri Bay area
a firm base was established and, leaving the tanks, a recce patrol
including Lt Callaghan and Sgt Lloyd McDonald, set out to
have a look at the Jap base. This party was twice ambushed but
suffered no casualties. Like so much of the ground in the north
of Bougainville the approaches to the Jap base were found to be
too soggy to carry the tanks and the armoured patrol returned
to D Coy 27 Bn. On the way back four mines were discovered on
the track and destroyed. At one stage a mine was exploded for-
ward of the leading tank by a Jap hiding on the side of the road.
Apparently he lost his nerve when the infanteers came through
and he exploded the mine before the tank reached it.


During this patrol Cpl Crowe of the Sig. Troop did sterling
work locating mines and assisting with the delousing. On 2nd
August this party set out on another patrol in the general direc-
tion of Ruri Bay. Unfortunately, when moving into perimeter on
the first night out Sgt McDonald’s tank struck a large mine
which blew it right over on to its turret, destroyed the tank and
killed three members of the crew, Tprs A. R. Mitchell, L. J. West
and L. W. Hardy. Sgt McDonald was wounded as were seven
members of the infantry party. The patrol was called off and
returned to its base. The following day Lt John Adamson and
his two tanks moved out on a fighting patrol in the 8 Bn area.
Shortly after starting one of the tanks detonated a mine which
broke the track and damaged the tank. At this stage the heavy
rains had made the ground very waterlogged and all tank patrols
were suspended.
On 13th, 14th and 15th August 16 Troop H.Q. area was
repeatedly shelled, but without effect. It is interesting to note
that on the evening of 15th August when the troops were listen-
ing to a broadcast of peace celebrations on the mainland, they
had to take to their slit trenches on account of hostile shelling.
As in the south, the Jap didn’t know of the surrender. The troop
suffered another loss when Sgt Bill Parks was struck by the
falling limb of a tree and received injuries from which he later
died. After the surrender the troop moved back to the Soraken
Peninsula where they proceeded to relax and make themselves
comfortable pending return to Torokina. Fishing was very
popular and many big hauls were taken. Towards the end of
the month the troop started moving by barge to Torokina and
on Ist September the last of 16 Troop reached the perimeter,
and Scott Force ceased to exist as an entity.


CHAPTER XIV
TOROKINA AND HOME
Mention has already been made of the perimeter at Torokina.
This perimeter was established by the Americans when they
originally landed in Bougainville, and was held by them at con-
siderable cost. It was this perimeter that the Australians took
over in November 1944 and from which all operations in
Bougainville were based. It was here that B Squadron spent
three months at the beginning of 1945 prior to moving to Toko,
where part of A Squadron waited prior to moving south, and
where the heavy positions of H.Q. Squadron were located whilst
the squadrons were on the move in the south and in the north.
It was natural, therefore, that when hostilities ceased, the Aus-
tralian troops—including our regiment—should concentrate in
the comparative “luxury” of Torokina. The Regiment was par-
ticularly fortunate in taking over Bosley Field, formerly the
H.Q. of the U.S. Navy in the area, and adjacent to the open air
picture theatre of that name.
With prospects of a wait of several months before we could
expect to return to the mainland, a policy of encouragement in
educational and sporting activities was laid down by H.Q. 2
Corps. A “Bougainville University” was established a short dis-
tance from Bosley Field and many members of the Unit attended
courses there; several were appointed instructors. Afternoons
were devoted mainly to sport and teams from the group included
both footballs, soccer, softball, and hockey. Parties went to the
surf beaches frequently and “doovering” became popular once
again. The pictures were very popular and many pre-release
films were screened. As the weeks wore on, however, our num-
bers began to dwindle. Dent Force at Rabaul was built up to
full squadron strength by low priority personnel, several mem-
bers were returned to the mainland for discharge, further rein-
forcements were sent to Rabaul—and so on until mid-December


when on the 14th all that remained of the Regiment, some one
hundred strong, sailed for home.
On disembarkation at Townsville the majority of the lads were
handed over to the staging camp for movement to their home
States—and then “home to Mum”. A small cadre was retained
to wind up the Unit’s administrative affairs in Brisbane, and
later, in Sydney, where they met a similar “cadre” from C Squad-
ron, and late in February 1946 the Unit became defunct, leaving
B Squadron at Rabaul carrying the torch.




PART III
FIRST BLOOD IN N.G.




CHAPTER XV
FROM MADANG TO AITAPE
Like the rest of the Regiment, C Sqn's first impressions of
Mililat were anything but complimentary. The boys plus their
Scale 1511 staggered up from the barges through the mud only
to find that the area allotted to them consisted chiefly of more
mud, high kunai grass, and thousands of mouldy coconuts.
Even Grandad ’ Stupart and “Aunty” Irving were roused from
their customary calm. However, a few days’ hard work by all
soon had the area in fairly shipshape order, and once again Cpl
Ken Swanwick, who had recovered from his seasickness, was able
to take up the tangled skeins of the “A” side in reasonable
comfort. Rumours that the squadron was No. 1 priority for a
“show” kept the boys on their toes, especially when Workshops,
Field Park, and Sig. sections moved into the area making the
squadron self-contained with a total strength of 12 officers and
217 O/Rs. A great amount of work was done on the tanks and
vehicles, and the many things associated with a squadron pre-
paring for movement kept everyone busy and morale high. The
first official intimation of the squadron’s move came on 26th
September 1944 by signal from 5 Aust. Div. warning one squad-
ron 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt and detachments of 2/4 Aust. Armd
Regt Sig. Tp, Field Park, and Workshops, for movement from
Madang to Aitape to come under command 6 Aust. Div. on
arrival. This was followed on Ist November by the following
signal:

(sgd) D. Robertson Maj.
The squadron greeted the news with great enthusiasm when
the C.O. made the announcement at a parade on Ist November,
and the squadron was placed on 6 hours’ notice to move as from
0600 hrs the next day. It was a happy day for the boys especially
as the news coincided with an issue of two bottles of beer per
man. Some of the old diehards managed to scrounge much more
than two bottles.
The loading of the tanks commenced promptly at 0700 hrs on
2nd November. With the assistance of three L.C.M.s, twenty
tanks and the battery charger were taken out to the Francis Park-
man in Mililat Harbour. The job took eleven hours-not bad
work considering that each tank weighed over 30 tons. When the
news of the move came through 11 Troop were out in the hills
round Madang getting some experience in patrolling. Good
work by Lieut. “Kim” McMaster and Tpr Harry Crockford,
who managed to contact them at Kamba, resulted in their getting
back in time to take part in the general bustle. The squadron
struck their tents on the night of 2nd November, and prepared
to say goodbye to the coconuts at Madang. They moved too fast
however, for because of loading difficulties they did not embark
until 7th November.
So, for five nights, most of the squadron slept in the thatched
mess hut or billeted themselves on their mates in other squad-
rons. Lieut. McMaster and 29 O/Rs were the first to move. They
boarded the S.S. Anhui on 3rd November together with the jeeps
to form an advance party at Aitape. Finally, the rest of the boys
embarked on the Francis Parkman which sailed at 1100 hrs on
7th November. Maj. Gos Cory, the Sqn 0.C., was saddled with

the job of O.C. ship. Blackout restrictions and the discomforts of
a Liberty ship packed with vehicles did not lower the general
enthusiasm, and the vessel reached Aitape after an uneventful
trip at 1100 hrs the next day.
Then the real troubles started, and Maj. Cory summed up his
impressions as follows: “Unloading appeared to be in the lap
of the gods and the hands of the Yanks—the latter having the
most say. One was impressed by the complete lack of organisa-
tion.” The troops disembarked at 0800 hrs on 9th November,
being taken to the shore by L.C.T. thence by M.T. to the squad-
ron area at Vokau. The camp area was a good one with a beach
frontage, but work was hampered by the fact that equipment
was still on the boat. A half bottle of rum, however, worked
wonders with the Americans who supplied a bulldozer which was
used to clean up the tank park and level parts of the area. The
off-loading of equipment remained the chief worry. If it wasn’t
rough weather, it was barges out of action or a ship with a higher
priority. Unit equipment that came off was dumped in a big
jumble on the beach and was likely to finish up anywhere.
Ken Swanwick’s “A” work was severely hampered by the loss
of his typewriter which was recovered several weeks later from
2/11 A.G.H. They had found it in the sea, and Ken often wished
later they had left it there. It was a week after the squadron’s
arrival before the first three tanks reached the beach, but it was
not till 21st November that the last of the tanks were unloaded.
The tanks had to be left at 6 Div. Reception Camp area owing to
the Whittaker Bridge being under repair, but they finally lumb-
ered into the squadron area on 24th November. Meanwhile the
squadron area had taken shape and the boys were happy in the
service. Here is a thumbnail sketch of the site by Ken Swanwick:
“We have a bonzer possie here, sandy soil all the way and the
whole area is a similar situation to say Camp H.Q. of the Bur-
leigh P.T. area without the sandhills near the beach. Quite a
nice surf here too, and no coral to cut the feet about. No coconuts
to drop on the scone and stink the joint out with their rotting
either, though there are plenty around the place. The whole
joint reminds one of Queen St on a Saturday night except there
ain’t no neon signs. The traffic past us is terrific and seems to go
well into the night. The Yanks have been around, and their
price for beer is £1 a bottle when sober and £3 when drunk.
There are something like six different picture shows within a
mile radius of our area.”
The arrival of the Jubal Early on 26th November was very
G


welcome as the vessel had all the Field Park vehicles and spares
on board. But hopes of obtaining much needed spares for the
tanks were dashed; the personnel got ashore all right but the
vehicles remained on board. One of the guards left on the ship
was Sgt Cliff Rush, later to become known as the Ancient
Mariner. He remained true to his trust, even going to Hollandia
with the vessel when a voyage had to be made there for fresh
water. The vehicles also made the journey, and it was not until
7th January, about 42 days after the vessel first arrived at Aitape,
that Cliff and his vehicles finally reached dry land. The boys were
still tearing into camp construction, and a generator and lighting
equipment obtained from the Yanks made things very comfort-
able at night, permitting the old men of the squadron to read
in comfort in their stretchers.
On Bth December, 6 Aust. Div. found a new use for the old
Matildas. They had been put to many uses before this, but had
never been allotted the job of acting as anchors for L.S.T.s.
Apparently there were not sufficient tractors available to hold the
L.S.T.s on the beach, so, in spite of protests, 11 and 13 Troops
under Lieut. Keith Drayton were detailed for this unusual task.
It proved not only unusual, but most annoying. The tanks were
knocked about by the continual lugging to keep the barges on
the beach, and to make matters worse there were a multitude of
beach officials whose main delight appeared to be in counter-
manding each other’s orders. The tanks would be ordered to a
certain part of the beach, then shifted elsewhere, and frequently
when they got to the appointed place the barges would not be
there. The salt water and tough work was making a mess of the
Tillies, and Maj. Cory asked Division to relieve the tanks of the
job. 11 Troop were relieved on 10th December by Lieut. Ray
Hibbard who took a composite troop of three tanks up to con-
tinue the anchor work.


CHAPTER XVI
LUMBERING DOWN TO
MATAPAU
Division had previously notified the squadron to be prepared to
send two troops to Yakamul, 22 miles east along the beach, and
11 and 12 Troops with two reserve tanks, plus a light section of
mechanics, were on a warning order to move to Yakamul, with
the object of training with the 19 Bde. The day of the move
down, 12th December, opened with torrential tropical rain which
kept up all day. The Nigia River was considered to be a tank
obstacle, as the bridge was thought too weak to permit the tanks
to cross. Arrangements had been made to have an L.C.M. to get
the tanks over, but after waiting 1J hours for the L.C.M. to
arrive, Maj. Cory decided to risk the bridge. The tanks made it
all right, and the little force comprising 3 officers and 52 O/Rs
camped the night at Rat Creek, reaching Yakamul the next day.
The tanks then commenced training with companies of the
2/11 Inf. Bn. On 19th December it looked as if the tanks might
get a chance to fire their first shots of the war. Orders were
received to move to the Danmap to support 2/4 Inf. Bn at
Luain. The infantry had struck opposition on the east bank of
the Danmap—a pocket of Japs tucked in on a spur on the foot-
hills. It was thought possible that the tanks might assist in
clearing them out, but hopes for the tanks doing the job were
blasted by an air-strike on 22nd December which enabled our
infantry to occupy the position.
Meanwhile, back at Aitape the monotony had been relieved
by the washing up of a body on the beach on 12th December.
Leo Goldwater thought it important enough to mention in the
War Diary, and Ken Swanwick grew rhetorical about it in one of
his letters. His description will stand repetition.
“A very decomposed body somewhat marred things yesterday
by getting itself washed ashore on our portion of the beach. The
mob gathered round and viewed same, and arguments immedi


ately started as to whether it was the remains of a Jap, a Yank, an
Aussie, or a Yank nigger. Whilst the aforesaid argument was at
its height, a commando from next door (who, by the way, was
backing heavily on ‘Yank nigger’) noticed a ring on the body’s
finger, and in one fell swoop and with a cry of ‘Well, that’s going
to be mine’, whipped the ring off, washed it in the sea, and
placed it on his own finger. The somewhat gruesome argument
continued until Maj. Cory arrived on the scene, sent the self-
appointed racial experts about their business, and placed a
picket on the corpse. We rang Div. and notified them of the
arrival of the body, and they promised to send a couple of body
snatchers over. Before the arrival of Div.’s representatives, how-
ever, a Yank ambulance came along and took the remains away.
Then Div. arrived. Now it is one thing to notify Div. that there
is a body available, but it is an entirely different thing to have
their body snatchers arrive and then to have to tell them that
they’ve arrived too late. There is an old and famous saying that
‘hell hath no fury like a woman scorned’. Amend this now to
read ‘a woman scorned hath no fury like a 6 Aust. Div. body
snatcher done out of his body’. They hung around for a while
muttering to themselves, and I had visions of another b
Court of Inquiry ref. the theft of a body taking shape right in
front of me. However, everything settled down and this morning
nobody seems to give a damn where the body is or even what
nationality it is.”
The first taste of what the forward infantry had to put up with
came on 22nd December. Lieuts Kim McMaster, Keith Drayton
with Cpl Wally Mason and Tpr Carrigg accompanied a fighting
patrol which was to occupy the position held by the Japs who
evacuated after the air-strike. They spent a night in the jungle,
and their worst scare was when one of our own 3-inch mortars
got a tree burst about 10 yards from the platoon post. At 0630
hrs Christmas Eve the group left Luain and established a peri-
meter at Suain about 1J miles to the west. Christmas morning
found the boys standing to at 0445 hrs. Sgt Butch Hoskins did
his best to make it seem like Christmas, but the extra rations
did not turn up and bully beef and M. and V. figured largely on
the menu. A.C.F. hampers and one bottle of beer, however, helped
to add a touch of the festive season. The base wallahs at Aitape
had a much better Christmas, with poultry and ham to remind
them of home. With the squadron separated into two parts, Cpls
Nev Bowyer and Bill Bouffler, the wireless wizards, were in their


element in providing wireless communication. And they did an
excellent job, wireless contact between the forward troops and
base working exceptionally well.
The New Year opened with the tanks doing training with the
2/4 Inf. Bn west of Suain, and after a few initial difficulties,
proved quite successful. On the night of sth January a warning
order was received from 19 Bde for tanks to cross the Danmap
that night to assist 2/11 Inf. Bn in an attack on Niap in the
morning. Maj. Cory stressed the difficulties of a night crossing
and Brigade agreed to postpone the attempt till morning, the
tanks to be at Rocky Point at 0730 hrs 6th January. Rain had
been falling for hours and the tracks were very muddy. Maj.
Cory gave orders for the tanks to move next morning and they
departed from the training area at 0445 hrs. Maj. Cory and
Lieut. McMaster moved ahead and forded the Danmap River
which was running strongly and still too deep for the tanks.
They contacted the C.O. 2/11 Inf. Bn, Lt-Col. Binks, and made
a recce forward to Wakip Creek where the forward platoon was.
A recce of the old road showed it was too narrow for tanks, so
it was decided the tanks should proceed along the beach until
they could be moved up on to the road again. Capt. Beverley
crossed the Danmap with the tanks at 0645 hrs without trouble
and they trundled up to Matapau. 11 Troop and two tanks of
12 Troop came forward, the remaining three tanks staying at
Lazy Creek. After an air-strike on the high ground the attack
went in, D Coy of 2/11 Bn being supported by 11 Troop.
The tanks went line ahead along the beach controlled by Lieut.
McMaster. The tanks sprayed the general area of the targets
which were most indistinct.
After dozer assistance two tanks in charge of Cpls Wally Mason
and Ted Bundock reached the old road. Very little opposition
was encountered—only an odd rifleman. The tanks were requested
to neutralise various areas. A deep gully halted the two tanks on
the road about 200 yards from Niap Point, but Lieut. Drayton’s
tank on the beach moved up with the infantry on the beach and
the point was occupied at 1600 hrs. The tanks were released and
moved back to Lazy Creek for the night.
The first action had proved successful. Though no known
casualties were inflicted on the enemy, the fire of the tanks had
a big moral effect on the infantry and apparently a very bad
one on the Nips. For a first action things went smoothly, and
Lieut. McMaster and Sgt “Bull” Walker proved their ability to


handle the Tillies from the ground and direct their fire on to
given targets. The crews of the first three tanks to go into action
for the Regiment were: Lieut. Keith Drayton, Cpl Cyril Towns-
end, Tpr Ted Davis, Tpr Fred Bennett; Cpl Wal Mason, Tpr
“Broncho” Bertram, Tpr Murray Hillard, Tpr Les Lawrence;
Cpl Ted Bundock, Tpr Ron McDermott, Tpr Clive Donovan,
Tpr Col Brooks. All carried out their jobs in a sound, matter of
fact manner. The following morning, 7th January, 12 Troop
moved up to Matapau with the object of supporting C Coy of
2/11 Inf. Bn which was relieving D Coy on Niap. About
nine minutes before the attack Bde gave instructions that the
tanks were not to be used. No one apparently knew why. Just
to show there was no ill feeling, the tanks, before they left,
sprayed the general area where a Jap rifleman was. Next day the
tanks went up again to support another attack, but the plans
went slightly astray, and once more the tanks returned to their
harbour near Rocky Point without firing a shot. The next three
days were occupied with tank maintenance and recces.
On 11th January a troop of tanks was required to move with
the infantry as far as possible east along the old road. The tanks
left the camp area at 0830 hrs and moved with a platoon of
infantry on to the old German Road and thence east for some
300 yards until an impassable gully was encountered. No opposi-
tion was met. Apart from the gully that held up the tanks, reports
indicated that the track would have to be widened from the
gully up the hill. There was no alternative route for the tanks
as the hills came sheer down to the coast with no beach. Two
tanks of 12 Troop went out on the same job next day, and just
before reaching the gully an enemy L.M.G. opened up. The
tanks engaged and neutralised the L.M.G. killing one Nip. Arriv-
ing at the obstacle, the enemy were found to be on the east
bank, possibly two or three riflemen and one S.M.G. They were
well hidden and the tanks sprayed the area with Besa. The party
withdrew to permit artillery and mortar fire on the position.
Tanks and infantry moved forward in the afternoon without
meeting opposition. Kim McMaster took an engineer officer,
Lieut. Douglas, with him to have a look at the road, and while
poking his head round a corner Lieut. Douglas received a bullet
through the top of his hat. The two tanks then returned to a
new area at Matapau Clearing to which the remainder of the
tanks had moved up during the day. It was right on the beach,


and with the arrival of B Ech. personnel on 14th January, the
little group became self-contained again.
With prospects of a quiet period for a few days Maj. Cory
returned to Aitape where the Field Park vehicles had been un-
loaded at last, most of them damaged in some way or another.
Arrangements were made for Lieut. Nealy to fit out a 3-ton stores
binned truck as soon as possible and send it down forward, the
object being to cut out a lot of special trips for spares. The track
from the Danmap to Aitape was very rough, and a wrecker was
used on the Danmap to get them across. The wrecker lifted the
front of the jeeps out of the water to keep the engines dry.
Arriving back at Matapau Clearing on 17th January, Maj. Cory
was greeted with the news that one troop was to come under
command 2/11 Inf. Bn for an attack on Abau, and also that Ned
Berry, one of the cooks, had been evacuated to hospital with
possible malaria. During the morning Micky Lawrence had his
foot severely crushed by a tank and it was later amputated in
hospital. Micky showed great courage and spirit through it all,
and he was badly missed at forward H.Q. “Jeep" Bailey was the
next malaria victim, and in preparation for the “bowler hat",
Maj. Cory wirelessed the size of his head back to rear H.Q. For
the next three days engineers with assistance from the squadron
commenced to doze in gullies and widen the track to enable the
tanks to move forward. The high pressure on the D/R service
back to Aitape was relieved by the arrival of a 3-ton binned
truck manned by Cpl Bunny Parslow and “Wirra" Walmsley of
Field Park.
A word here for Tpr Noel Whittle, better known as “Wit",
who had the job of keeping the forward group supplied with
water. Over the rough jungle tracks “Wit" hauled his 80-gallon
jeep trailer to and from the water point. The only time he
became really annoyed was when somebody criticised Murwil-
lumbah. “Butch" Hoskins and “Darkie" Saunders did a great
job with the meagre rations, and fed the boys in excellent style.
Malaria now commenced in earnest; Frank Birtwell, Tony Cross-
man, George McKinnon, Bob Kelly, Wally Mason and “Bundy"
Lack being the victims, while a few days later Frank Midden-
way and Johnny Rossiter were packed off to hospital. The rest
were put on two atebrin per day. On 23rd January Maj. Cory
and Lieut. McMaster walked through to Abau which had been
captured quite easily by D Company 2/1 Inf. Bn. The fighting
along the coast consisted chiefly of small patrol clashes, and then


battles for dominating features in the high country. 16 Bde took
over from 19 Bde at Nimbum River with 2/1 Bn on the coast,
2/3 Bn inland, and 2/2 in reserve. Lieut. Frank Fry, Transport
Officer, joined Advance H.Q. in place of Bill Gately who went
back to his troop. At this stage of the game Adv. H.Q. consisted
of Major Cory, Lieuts McMaster and Fry, Leo Goldwater (I cpl),
Dave Smith (clerk), Frank Birtwell (canteen and Q), Ned Camp-
bell (medical orderly) and Nev Bowyer (rear link operator).


CHAPTER XVII
FAREWELL TO DOGRITO BAY
Orders were received from 16 Bde for a troop of tanks to move
to Niap 2 on 13th February. Lieut. Keith Drayton took his troop
to the area where it came under command 2/1 Bn with the
object of securing the general line Nambut Hill-Nimbum Creek.
The remainder of the Group were placed in support with 2/2 Bn
as reserve troops. 2/1 Bn cleared Nambut Ridge by attacking
from the east up Burrell's Spur, thus catching the Nip in the
rear. Although these actions were not spectacular, they were
slogging matches and each day the casualties mounted up. The
Japs did not like the tanks, and where possible moved away from
any ground that the Tillies could use. Captured documents
stressed the importance of destroying the tanks. At this stage it
was impossible to get the tanks past a feature known as “The
Pimple”, as Nambut Creek presented a tank obstacle. To get the
tanks across, a 30ft bridge was required. The boys were keen to
continue the advance and Lieut. Drayton and a work party com-
menced preparing the track as far as the creek. Meanwhile the
infantry advance continued without the tanks. Balam Creek was
occupied with minor resistance, and Selamin Creek was reached
on 24th February. The supply problem was now becoming acute,
both ammo and rations getting very low. Things looked grim for
the Sqn Group which was now 9000 yards behind the leading
elements. All forward tank recces had to be done on foot, the
tracks being impassable by jeep. Capt. Doug Green, who came up
from Madang on a visit, had a stiff initiation in the art of
footslogging when he covered 10 miles of heavy going on his
first forward recce with Major Cory.
Major Cory and George McKinnon began to think that walk-
ing was safer than driving after an experience they had on
22nd February. They were walking back from Niap to Matapau
when the squadron 6x6 driven by Tpr Kite with Dan Stewart
as offsider offered them a lift. When trying to get round a sharp


corner on the Bluff the old truck could not make it in one
sweep. Owing to the wet clay the truck ran over the side and
down the 40 foot bank. Fortunately it remained on its wheels
and came to rest unharmed at the bottom. It is doubtful if
trained parachutists could have baled out better than the pas-
sengers and crew. The workshops wrecker later pulled the truck
out, and it returned to camp under its own steam without a
scratch to show for its mishap.
16 Bde Operation Order of 27th February stated that the
Squadron Group became Brigade reserve and remained in its
present location. Very heavy rain had been falling for a week
and the tracks were in a very bad state—impassable even to jeeps
at times. Continual recces were carried out and every effort was
made to “sell” the tanks and find routes to get them up to the
infantry. 16 Bde almost had to put a picket on Major Cory to
keep him from pounding them about his beloved Tillies. Quite
a few of the boys developed into excellent footsloggers as a result
of the recces. The infantry were now so far in advance that it was
essential to have good walkers for these little jungle jaunts which
were never less than 10 miles and often up to 15 miles. In the
steaming humidity and mud they were no joke. The only bright
spot in the monotony of Niap 2 was the sea bathing.
With no job in sight for the tanks, Maj. Cory and Keith
Drayton returned to Aitape by barge on Bth March to see how
things were going there and, as Gos tersely stated in his report,
“to get stuck into a bit of grog—dry up forward”. His throat
certainly needed lubrication after his futile sales talk to Brigade
on the value of armour. Everything at Aitape was running
smoothly beyond the fact that skin trouble was fairly prevalent
in spite of the surfing. After the first bout of malaria, casualties
dropped to nil again. There was a spot of excitement on the
night of 9th March when a hydro burner exploded in the
kitchen, but beyond burning the tarpaulin roof no damage was
done.
While at Aitape Major Cory received wireless instructions to
report to 16 Bde H.Q. He arrived there on 13th March, and was
given orders to move the Squadron Group to the west bank of
the Anumb River on a date to be notified. After weeks of inac-
tivity the news was very welcome, and no time was lost in making
preparations to move. Tanks were to move overland as the bridge
over Nambut Creek was now complete, while the heavy “B”
vehicles were to be lifted by barge. Everything was ready to go
on the morning of the 14th, except one of 12 Troop tanks which


delayed the start. At 0930 hrs a message was received from
Brigade cancelling the move. What the boys said is unprintable.
Owing to the wet and muddy conditions at Niap 2, 11 Troop
were moved back to Matapau 2. The area here was much better.
Morale, however, was not the best, as the little group by now
were the oldest inhabitants of the Dogrito Bay area, and the front
line was daily getting further away. Even Brigade H.Q. were some
miles further ahead. The infantry advance had continued and
But had fallen. Major Cory and Lt Drayton walked through to
But a distance of 14 miles on 20th March and found good tank
going all the way. This feat of tropical footslogging proved too
much for Keith, who developed a swollen leg and had to return
by barge. Gos, however, who had done so much walking by this
time trying to sell armour, thought nothing of walking home.
But even he was not sorry to get a lift by jeep for half the
distance.
As nothing seemed likely to be doing for several days it was
decided to give 11 and 12 Troop crews a spell and replace them
with 13 and 14 Troops. The changeover was effected by 30th
March. The month ended with the tanks still anchored in the
same spot. The forward infantry at Dagua drome were 30 miles
in front, and the Tillies’ only hope of catching up with the
fighting depended on whether 16 Bde could make available
barges to shift them. At the beginning of April two crews from
F.H.Q. arrived at Advanced H.Q. to take over the reserve tanks,
the crews of which went back to the pleasures of Aitape. During
the waiting period the tanks received a complete check over and
were now ready for anything. Brighter news was received on
4th April when Major Cory visited But, and was informed by
A.Q. 6 Div. (Lt-Col. Murphy) that barges would be available on
the 7th or 9th to shift the Group forward. With things looking
up, Maj. Cory, Ray Hibbard, and Sid Mortensen recced a camp-
ing area approximately midway between But and Dagua. The
infantry advance went on and Dagua was occupied with little
resistance. The tank boys had plenty of evidence of how far they
were behind the war by the continual stream of natives moving
eastwards to occupy their former villages. 10th April was a day
of cursing for Lt Bill Gately and Sid Mortensen. Just when the
prospects were improving they were detailed to go to school at
Pucka. Both took an exceedingly dim view of the situation, but
being good soldiers packed up their traps and went.
At long last the Group saw the last of the damp and muddy
roads of Dogrito Bay. On 13th April an L.C.T. pulled in and


three IB Troop tanks, one reserve troop tank, and the O.C.’s
jeep went aboard. In addition a section of mechanics under
S/Sgt “Peg Leg” Garrett also embarked. Lieuts McMaster and
Fry were left cooling their heels at the bay with 14 Troop tanks
and the “B” vehicles until the arrival of the next barge. The
tanks and vehicles went ashore at But after a two and half
hour trip and moved along the beach to Suain and settled in.
One of IB Troop tanks put on a poor show during the move.
It developed rackham trouble and halted in the middle of the
road. The tank held up Brig. Martin, commander of 19th Brigade,
while the trouble was rectified. The Brigadier’s comments are
not available. By 17th April the rest of the vehicles had arrived
from Dogrito Bay. Four days later Advanced Sqn H.Q. moved
forward to Karawop where a perimeter was formed. The Group
was nicely protected all round by 2/3 and 2/1 Bns and the
artillery. On 24th April Major Cory got all his worries olf
his chest at a G.O.C.’s conference at But. It was agreed there that
seven more tanks would be brought down from Aitape and the
remainder of the squadron as soon as possible. Things were
brightening for the tanks, especially when orders were received
for one troop and one reserve tank to support the advance of
2/3 Bn on Boiken.
On the morning of 25th April the infantry resumed the
advance, but at 1450 hours enemy with H.M.G. was contacted
covering the road. 13 Troop were called up and moved along
the beach owing to the collapse of bridges on the road. A dozer
cut a track through from the beach to the road, but by the time
the tanks got through, the infantry had cleared the opposition.
A Coy continued the advance supported by 13 Troop and cleared
Boiken Plantation. Apparently the appearance of the tanks was
too much for the Nips who did not oppose the advance and
13 Troop spent the night with A Coy at Kurapia. One Indian
came in in bad shape with bayonet wounds through both
hands and one in the chest because he had waved to our air-
craft. His gratitude at medical attention and food was pathetic.
In the afternoon 14 Troop and F.H.Q. Troop were ordered to
move forward with C Company but struck nothing. The advance
continued the following morning. A Company encountered
enemy dug in on the side of the track. Point tank of 13 Troop
moved forward and wiped him out with Besa fire. Another Nip
on the side of the track was blown away with 2-pounder. At this
stage a Jap 37-mm. opened up from the left of the track some
150 yards in front, concealed in bushes. The first shot missed the


point tank, and just as tank fire was being brought to bear on the
gun, it apparently blew up or a charge was placed in the breech
block. An examination later showed that the breech block had
been blown off. Another 100 yards further on, the point tank's
2-pounder barrage silenced a Nip bunker position. A Company
reached its objective, Cholial, and consolidated. The tank boys
were very happy at the end of the day, and Ray Hibbard’s
report over the air that night was charged with excitement.
Kim McMaster controlled the tanks by Walkie Talkie in his
usual dashing style, and the targets were speedily picked out and
done over. During the day 14 Troop had also moved forward
with B Company up a long spur to Yungo. The move was very
slow, the tanks having to be guided through chest-high tangled
growth through the destroyed plantation. Frank Hevey's tank
broke a track and remained stranded on a coconut log. The other
tanks managed the climb but found no enemy on top. The fact
that the tanks were able to climb the spur and reach the village
rather astounded the critics. 14 Troop including Cpl Hevey’s
tank returned to Boiken Mission for the night, and 13 Troop
remained at Cholial. Lt Ross Hall, who had come up from
Madang, controlled the 14 Troop tanks. On 27th April 2/2 Bn
took over from 2/3, and 13 Troop continued the advance with
D Company to the Hawain. No opposition was met, so the tanks
pulled back to Welubi where 14 Troop and F.H.Q. joined them.
13 Troop covered the crossing of C Company over the Hawain by
spraying with Besa and shelling along the coast. It was quite
apparent that the Nips had no stomach for the tanks for there
was ample evidence where they had speedily evacuated as the
tanks approached. The advance along the coast for the last three
days was the fastest of the campaign—a further argument for
Major Cory in the use of tanks.
On 28th April the tanks moved east to Naugir which was a
better area for the Group to fit into. Next day Maj. Cory attended
a conference at 19 Brigade H.Q. when plans for the attack on
Wewak were outlined. 2/4 Bn was to make the drive to Worn
and Wewak with three troops of tanks. Two troops of tanks
were to be in reserve to assist 2/11 Bn who were working inland.
15 Troop under Lt Charlie Fitzroy arrived from Aitape as well
as another F.H.Q. tank. An area at Boiken was selected as the
camping site for Workshops, Field Park and Rear H.Q. The
engineers had constructed a girder bridge over the Hawain for
the tanks and requested they move across before any heavy rain
started.


The month ended with a big uplift to morale following the
minor shows in which the tanks took part. The light detachment
of mechanics with the forward troops did an excellent job in
keeping the Tillies and “B” vehicles going. The Field Park sec-
tion under Cpl Parslow also put up an excellent performance,
producing practically anything that was needed. The wireless
wizards, Nev Bowyer and Bill Bouffler, were responsible for
efficient communication over 80 miles, and even converted Major
Cory to the advantage of using the air.
Back at Rear H.Q. at Aitape the month passed off quietly.
Major Millikin arrived to become 2 I/C in place of Captain
Beverley who went to A Squadron later. Training and surfing
occupied most of the time. The supply position, however, was
grim. Here's what Ken Swanwick thought of it:
“We have not had any decent canteen goods for months now,
quite apart from other things. Such articles as cordials, tooth
paste and the like just don't exist. Cigarettes are very short and
sometimes unprocurable for a couple of weeks at a time, as also
is beer. Up to the end of March we had received five bottles
since Christmas Day, and you know what a serious shortage I
think that is. Clothing just isn’t, and most of the units are
getting along with only one sound shirt per man, and are lots
worse off than we are. You should see the poor b engineers
working with stuff the Romans gave away.”
Nobody at the rear was sorry when orders came to move for-
ward. On Ist May 13, 14 and 15 Troops crossed the Hawain and
leaguered with C Company 2/3 Bn and D Company 2/4 Bn.
The remainder of Workshops and Field Park, together with
11 Troop and one tank of F.H.Q. arrived from Aitape and
moved to Boiken. All that remained at Aitape was 12 Troop
plus one tank of F.H.Q. and the Squadron Q and orderly room.
With the additional tanks coming forward and the require-
ments for the attack on Wewak, it was essential that the Work-
shops team with machinery and Field Park should be brought
forward to service and keep the tanks in operation. The L. of C.
was now 80 miles, and had to rely on barges as jeeps could not
get through by road. The delay in getting parts forward was too
great and the one Field Park truck forward could not hope to
carry sufficient spares. The mech. team was also too small, and
was hampered by lack of machines, tools etc. in the servicing of
fifteen or more tanks. Lack of barges for transport was the main
trouble and the squadron requirements were considered lower
priority than that of other units.


CHAPTER XVIII
ON TO WOM AND WEWAK
The advance on Wewak began on 3rd May, D Company 2/4 Bn
with 13 Troop in support being in front. The battalion followed
the advance with the two remaining tank troops following in the
rear of H.Q. Company. The advance continued without opposi-
tion. There were plenty of fresh signs of Nips who had evacuated
in a hurry. The night was spent in the Cape Pus area after a
gruelling march of nearly six miles by the infantry. The next
morning did not open too well for the tanks. Frank Hevey was
so keen to dash his tank into action that he started backing it
without making sure everything was clear. As a result he ran
over a quantity of tools belonging to Sgt Gailey of the Sig.
Troop, who had been repairing a rear telephone. Some of the
tools weren’t worth much after 30 tons of steel had pounded
them into the mud. Just as the Hevey-Gailey rumpus was being
adjusted, Major Cory discovered his Walkie Talkie had walked.
Now an O.C. tanks without a Walkie Talkie is like a baby with-
out a rattle, and Gos burnt the air with Kim McMaster until
finally the missing instrument was found in one of 14 Troop’s
tanks and everybody was happy again. After these little interludes
the advance continued without opposition. The dozer which
followed the leading tanks had plenty of work clearing the track
of fallen trees and filling in bomb craters.
Cape Worn was reached and secured without a shot being fired.
The next two days were uneventful ones, but on 6th May
Advanced Sqn H.Q. moved to Cape Worn and settled in. Just on
tea time seven rounds of hostile shelling landed in the area and
stirred the boys up a bit. Slit trenches went down in record time.
13, 14 and 15 Troops crossed Urfip Creek on the evening of
6th May and spent the night east of Waringi Creek mouth in
rear of Battalion H.Q. On the afternoon of 7th May nine Light-
nings manned by U.S.A. Air Force bombed and strafed Cape
Worn area in mistake, killing eight and wounding nineteen. The


bombs landed among the Field Regiment and 19 Brigade area.
The squadron did not have any casualties, but was fated to have
its first that night.
At 2100 hrs Lieut. Ray Hibbard and Sgt Bill Parks left to
move out with a patrol for Minga Creek. The night was dark
and wet. The patrol consisted of an infantry section, an engineer
recce party and two armoured personnel. A holding force was
left forward of the leading platoon some 300 yards west of Minga
Creek. The patrol reached the creek and completed the recce.
On its return the leading scout did not answer the challenge of
the holding force correctly and was fired on. Both parties opened
fire and threw grenades. Apparently a small party of Nips also
joined in. In the mix-up Ray Hibbard was seriously wounded
in the stomach and an infantry N.C.O wounded in the leg. Sgt
Kirby of the engineers did a very fine job in assisting Ray and
bringing him and the N.C.O. back as far as possible. It was not
till 6 o’clock next morning that Ray Hibbard was able to get
medical attention, and he died of wounds on 10th May.
In view of the support for 2/11 Bn working inland along the
Big Road, Capt. Beverley, Sgt Bill Parks, and Tpr Arthur Brown
left for Waringi Creek with a company of 2/11 Bn to work
through to Big Road and report on possible tank going. They
rejoined the Sqn Group on the Wewak strip after a strenuous
time slugging with the infantry. All hope of getting tanks through
to Big Road by that route was abandoned on their report.
On Bth May 15 Troop stood by to assist B Company in forming
a bridgehead over Minga Creek. The point tank commanded by
Geoff Reid engaged three enemy on the east bank, killing one
and knocking out an L.M.G. Harry Davenport was the gunner
and was right on the target. The tank continued to give covering
fire on to the east bank and engaged a pillbox and H.M.G. on
Wewak at 700 yards range. This started a fire and a large quantity
of smoke in the remains of a hut where the enemy were seen to
be moving. As B Company crossed the creek in assault boats the
tanks kept up a covering fire. After seeing the company secure,
the tanks moved back to leaguer. Lt Charlie Fitzroy, who was in
charge of 15 Troop, was very pleased with the day’s effort. Harry
Davenport did some excellent shooting from the point tank.
The other occupants of this tank were Dave Pithie (loader
operator) and Tommy Wah (driver).
Orders for the final attack on Wewak were received on 9th
May and that night amid mounting excitement preparations
were made by the tank crews for their part in the assault.

AITAPE WEWAK CAMPAIGN
3 N OV. 1944 15 AUB. 1345 Tank Track


13 Troop were to marry up with D Company to secure the
approaches to Wewak, capture the first feature, and then to
secure the high ground; 14 Troop with B Company to follow
D Company, exploit to the left and secure the left flank and
caves area; 15 Troop and C Company to move in the rear
of D Company and secure the right flank and Five Docks area
while D Company captured the high ground. Kim McMaster and
Tpr Carrigg were given the job of controlling 13 Troop, while
Keith Drayton and Harry Davis together with “Bull” Walker
and Johnny Carlisle were chosen to guide the destinies of 14
and 15 Troops respectively.
And so, on the night of 9th May 1945, after years of waiting
and training, C Squadron was ready for its first big action of
the war. The crews of the three troops chosen for the assault on
Wewak were:

At 1620 hours that afternoon 13, 14, and 15 Troops moved
forward and married up with their respective infantry companies.
11 Troop and two reserve tanks moved from Worn and crossed
Urfip and Waringi Creeks and occupied the area vacated by the
other troops ready to support them if required. Heavy rain began
at 2200 hrs, but the tanks successfully crossed Minga Creek at
0140 hrs after a slow approach march through the companies in
the inky darkness. All three troops settled in behind B Company
in a very confined area. H Hour had been fixed for 0523 hrs.
After some confusion in the dark the companies reached their
positions and the two regiments of artillery opened up at H—2o,
3-in. mortars at H—ls and the M.M.G.s at H—ls. Heavy rain was
falling, and it was very dark. As H Hour approached Major
Cory informed the Battalion commander that it was still too
dark for the tanks to give effective support as the driving rain
blinded periscopes and telescopes. Brigade agreed to retard the
start time by 30 minutes and the artillery programme was
arranged accordingly.
It was still very dark when the attack started. Tracer fire from
the tanks and return fire from the enemy streamed through the
darkness and shell-bursts were plainly visible. A heavy con-
centration of fire was laid down on Wewak. As no prior recce
could be made, the tanks had to take the risk from mines, but
only a few 250-kg. bombs were discovered by the engineers.
D Company and 13 Troop secured the causeway leading to
Wewak. The tanks knocked out a H.M.G. in a pillbox covering
the approach. Then D Company and 13 Troop swung half right
and captured the first objective. B Company and 14 Troop fol-
lowing, moved left, secured the left flank and started to engage


the caves. C Company and 15 Troop secured the left flank while
D Company and 13 Troop moved up on to the high ground. The
tanks gave the infantry constant support, and the speed with
which Kim McMaster brought fire on targets was excellent.
Several L.M.G.s were knocked out and strong points destroyed.
The track up to the top of the feature was very steep and crat-
ered by bombs. Just near the top a bomb had completely
destroyed the road and prevented the tanks from moving for-
ward. Kim turned them right and headed them up the steep
bank with a prayer that the old girls would make it. They did—
and Gos Cory watching from below heaved a sigh of relief as
the Tillies lumbered over the top. D Company and 13 Troop
continued to advance and cleared the high ground. The tanks
gave splendid support fire, saving many casualties. They cer-
tainly proved their worth, and the infantry were loud in their
praises. Wewak was captured by 0800 hrs.
In the meantime 15 Troop controlled by Sgt Mac Walker
moved round to the right flank where they engaged and knocked
out a 20-mm. gun, one heavy machine gun, and one light machine
gun. Six Nips were killed, excluding those inside the caves which
the tanks also shot up. When his Walkie Talkie broke down Mac
used the rear telephone and when that failed he mounted the
tank and controlled it through the pistol port. Johnny Carlisle
gave him splendid assistance. On the left flank where B Company
was bogged down by fire from the caves 14 Troop conducted a
private war against the Japs holding the caves. Numerous rounds
of 3-inch howitzer, 2-pounder and Besa were fired into the caves
which had several openings. As one Nip was killed another would
take his place and snipe away. One cave went into the hill for
such a distance that it was thought the 3-inch howitzer had a
misfire until a muffled report came from far inside the cave.
Even in the midst of the action the Australian soldier had to
do something amusing. Rifle fire was coming from the vicinity
of a cave, but the enemy could not be located. Jock Webster,
driver of Lt Hall’s tank, picked up what he thought was the
Nip and passed the information on to the troop leader and
gunner. Frank Morrow, the gunner, thought he could see the
target, but that wasn’t good enough for Jock. “I’ll open the
driver’s hatch and poke my hat slowly up and if he fires it's him,’’
said Jock. He did so, and the Nip fired again for the last time,
as a burst of Besa from Frank’s gun cut him down.
All firing ceased, and it was found that in one cave four Nips


were killed at its mouth and more inside. A full count was not
made till several days later. The infantry casualties had been
light and the tanks were undoubtedly responsible for saving
many. The tanks had at last proved their worth in this class of
fighting, and their popularity with the infantry was great.
Further mopping up was carried out in all areas and Wewak
was secured. The tanks leaguered on the west side of Wewak at
Watson Point and maintenance was carried out. The whole
action at Wewak went very smoothly. The infantry-tank co-
operation was good, and splendid work was done by Kim
McMaster, Keith Drayton, and Mac Walker in controlling the
Tillies from the ground. The crews handled the tanks without
a fault. Carlton was the only tank to receive any damage, and
this was confined to numerous small arms bullets, a couple of
which pierced the tucker box and wrecked the M. and V., bully,
and jam. A smoke projector was damaged and two periscopes
shot out. The only crew casualty was "Blue” Wasley who had a
thumb nail ripped off while loading the 2-pounder. The tanks
were credited with killing twenty Nips, knocking out one 20-mm.,
two heavy machine guns, and three light machine guns. The
number of enemy killed was a very conservative estimate, as was
proved by a later count.
On 11th May 11 Troop and three F.H.Q. tanks arrived from
Worn, giving the squadron fifteen tanks in the area. Heavy rain
fell during the night. 14 Troop supported A Company in clear-
ing the track round the west coast of Wewak. No enemy was
seen, though the tanks were used to shoot up caves. 13 Troop
supported C Company and moved down along the road from
Wewak towards the airstrip, but saw nothing.
Two troops were ordered to make an attempt to link up with
2/11 Bn. They were to proceed via the west end of Wewak strip
and then use a track which linked up with Big Road below
Sauri. 11 Troop with one F.H.Q. and two reserve tanks were
given the job and were escorted by 15 Troop and B Company.
A start was made at midday, but trouble wasn’t long in coming.
The country after leaving the strip was waterlogged, and one
of 15 Troop tanks got badly bogged in a small creek. The others
tried to get it out, and at one stage three tanks were bogged.
Two were pulled out by other tanks, but the leading tank
remained firm in a special type of New Guinea mud. The other
tanks returned to Wewak, and next day the bogged tank was
extricated with the help of two H.D.7 tractors and some digging.

The proposed link up by tanks with 2/11 Bn via the track at
the north end of the Wewak strip to Big Road was a gamble. No
prior recce could be made and study of air photographs did not
give much hope. The two troops detailed for the job were made
self-supporting as far as possible, moving with full fuel tanks
and jettison tanks and trailing ammunition limbers. The tanks
however, found the going impossible, and were unable to get
through-


CHAPTER XIX
DOWN TO BORAM
The tanks were again in demand on 13th May when orders
were issued for an attack on Warui Mission the following day.
At 0745 hrs on 14th May F.H.Q. Troop moved off to the Warui
road junction where they married up with A Company 2/4 Bn.
The tanks then proceeded towards the foot of Warui Mission
Hill and engaged enemy positions and dug-in guns with both
2-pounder and 3-inch howitzer. Their shooting was first class.
11 Troop and 13 Troop followed the same route of approach
and waited till required near the beach under cover.
The attack, which was timed for 1330 hrs, was to be done in
three phases:
(a) C Company with 11 Troop to pass through A Company
and F.H.Q. and to secure the first feature.
(b) A Company to move through C Company with F.H.Q.
and capture Mission Hill.
(c) B Company to pass through C Company picking up
11 Troop and pass through A Company to secure the
feature to the west.
Preceded by the usual artillery concentration, C Company
and 11 Troop moved off and struck little opposition. Three Nips
waiting in the grass with 70-kg. aerial bombs as anti-tank mines
were killed by the infantry protecting the tanks. On securing the
first objective, it was found that the shooting by a F.H.Q. tank
before the show started had been most effective. One 20-mm. gun
and an L.M.G. had been knocked out and six Nips killed. Teddy
Lawlor, the boy from Dalby, was the 3-inch howitzer gunner,
and his aim was deadly.
A Company with F.H.Q. moving through C Company attacked
and took Mission Hill against light opposition—the tanks were
the first to reach the top of the feature. As opposition was still
light A Company continued on with F.H.Q. and secured the


western feature. Once again the old Tillies turned up trumps.
The casualties among the infantry were light, and the tanks
accounted for about thirty Japs and knocked out one 20-mm.,
one L.M.G. and one aircraft L.M.G.
When the tanks were moving back down the strip after the
action an enemy heavy machine gun opened up at approximately
700 yards from the west end of Mission Hill but the shooting
was poor. The tanks did not engage, as it was impossible to pin-
point the gun in the poor light. 14 Troop went out with a
platoon from D Company on 15th May to clear the plantation
below Mission Hill and the track leading to the Big Road. No
contact as made, but Captain Beverley, who was in charge of
the tanks, sprained his ankle so badly that he had to return to
Worn. Major Cory attended a conference at 2/8 Battalion which
took over from 2/4 Battalion. Three recce patrols were sent out
with 2/8 infantry. Mac Walker went with a patrol along
the coast towards the Kreer turn-off, but nothing was seen.
Keith Drayton accompanied another patrol on the inland
route. They located 500-lb. bombs set as mines, and also cap-
tured three Formosans, one of whom surrendered to Keith much
to his surprise. Lieut. Fitzroy went with another patrol towards
Kreer. At midday a call came from 2/4 Bn for a troop of tanks
to go to Mission Hill to shoot up a heavy machine gun that was
inflicting casualties. Up to that time 300 rounds of 25-pounders
had failed to silence the gun. 13 Troop went to Mission Hill and
the gun was pointed out about 400 yards away. “Wog” Mackay
completely wrecked the place with ten rounds of 2-pounder. A
white flag appeared and a patrol found two Nips still alive. One
surrendered, but the other preferred to blow his brains out with
a hand grenade. Four other dead Nips were counted. The gun
had been blown off its mount and the overhead cover destroyed.
Major Cory collected a good sword which he gave to “Wog” as
a tribute to his fine shooting. It was rather like a bit of gunnery
practice shooting the bunker up with infantry as interested
spectators cheering each shot. The Nip prisoner stated “We can
dodge the artillery and bombs, but not the tanks—they are too
accurate.” A nice tribute to the old Tillies.
The squadron’s operations with 2/4 Bn were most successful.
An excellent team spirit developed and co-operation was good.
C.O. 2/4 Bn, Lt-Col. Cox, was always most helpful and under-
standing. While working forward with 2/4 Bn, the Battalion
undertook to ration the tank troops and the organisation was
excellent. Special mention must be given to Capt. Martin, the


Q.M. The squadron provided a cook to assist, and B Ech.
worked with the Battalion. There was never a hitch with rations,
P.0.L., or ammunition, and time and again Capt. Martin helped
out with supplies of clothing and other goods.
That evening the squadron was notified to have three troops
ready by 0600 hrs the next morning to support 2/8 Bn’s advance
down the coast. As it would be high tide at that time, 14 and
15 Troops and F.H.Q. moved across Mission Creek that night
and settled in. The infantry did the job without tank support
on 16th May, but the following morning 13 and 14 Troops sup-
ported B Company in the capture of Boram Point and Boram
Creek. The attack was preceded by a spectacular air-strike and
artillery concentration. B Company and 14 Troop occupied
Boram Point without opposition and then turned down the
coast towards Boram Creek. The tanks sprayed the far bank of
the creek as cover for the infantry. Three Nips were located and
killed in a dug-out on the west bank. The infantry crossed the
creek, but struck trouble from dug-outs and trenches on the east
bank. 14 Troop then crossed and shot up dug-outs and defensive
positions. Fifteen enemy dead were buried by bulldozer, the
tanks getting at least half. One Jap was sent to his ancestors
with a 2-pounder through the chest. Gos Cory was lucky enough
to get a splendid silk flag—probably one advantage of being
O.C. The tanks returned to their area at the junction of Kreer
and coast road, the remaining tanks having moved up there
from Mission Point during the day.
After crossing Boram Creek and doing the initial clearing up,
15 Troop was sent down along the beach without infantry
protection. The troop moved line ahead to do over the various
dug-outs and trenches. As the tide was out, they had a good
open stretch of beach and a good field of fire and could be con-
trolled from the F.D.L. by Walkie Talkie.
A short way down the Kreer Road the Nip had a reception for
the tanks in the shape of two 70-kg. bombs buried full length
standing on their tail fins with contact primers and a 44-gallon
drum of petrol in between. The engineers deloused them and
started to remove them, but found further contraptions on the
bottom and decided to blow them. The result was a hole that
would easily have buried a tank. The Field Company Comman-
der was rather annoyed as he had to cart gravel for half a day to
fill the hole in.
On 18th May the tanks moved up to Boram Point and occupied
a good area on the north-west side. The next day orders were


received for three troops to take part in an attack on Boram
drome and hills to the south. The morning of the attack—
20th May—opened with very heavy rain. 15 Troop with a
platoon of B Company moved down the coast working two
tanks on the beach and one on the road. 11 Troop with two
platoons B Company worked down the Boram strip. 14 Troop
stood by to assist A Company, who were responsible for the high
ground on the south side of the strip. No opposition was en-
countered along the coast. 11 Troop drew fire from heavy
machine guns on the high ground and engaged. A and D Com-
panies found the going hard. The enemy were in good positions
on high ground to the south-east, and owing to the nature of
the ground it was impossible to get tank support to them. How-
ever, a concentration of artillery cleared the area and all objec-
tives were taken by the end of the day. The tanks returned to
Boram Point where the forward B Echelon had moved up and
once again the forward detachment was able to feed itself.
Prior to the attack on Boram strip recce patrols including
squadron personnel were sent out. Lieut. Hall and one O/R
went with a patrol from B Company 2/11 Bn to recce the
ground south of the strip. It proved quite exciting, even if the
amount of information gained for tank going was not great.
As the patrol was crossing the northern end of the strip and
approaching the ridges on the south, they came under enemy
L.M.G. and H.M.G. fire from the hills that were to be recon-
noitred for tank approaches. The patrol was unable to proceed
and had to get out without gaining information on passable
tank routes. This had a definite bearing on the attack, for though
tanks stood by during the attack they were not used by B Com-
pany in the centre sector. There the attack was held up from the
high ground until artillery fire eventually silenced the enemy.
The war was coming to an end as far as C Squadron were
concerned. One of the final operation orders received was for an

During this move one of the few Jap tanks in New Guinea
Wa ‘w°u Cated ' Here 1S what Gos Cor y had to sa y about it:
Where the swamp ran out to the sea at the base of Moem


there was a type of Jap tank stranded. How we wished she was
mobile. Of a type I have not seen before—obviously a tank with
recovery attachments. I took a couple of photos of it. Weight
6-8 tons. Crew probably three. Hand operated turret which once
fitted a heavy machine gun in ball mount. Turret well forward.
VI2 air-cooled Diesel engine. Front sprocket drive-large idlers
in rear (Stewart type)-hydraulically sprung. Two pair of bogies
and one single each side, torsion bar suspension, and the pairs
sprung with heavy leaf spring. Armour to f" thick, riveted
and seams welded. Asbestos lined inside. On the rear were two
big arms with pulleys and various hooks etc. The cable came
inside the hull and there were various power take-offs and gear
boxes, the workings of which I did not work out. The bogies
were rubber tyred with three rubber return rollers on top.
“I tried the 2-pounder A.P. out on it at approximately 30
yards. What it did was just a shame. One shot on the turret
plate went right through both sides and for good measure
through a 10" tree. The fragmentation was as if a grenade had
exploded inside in spite of the asbestos. The shot drilled nearly
halfway through the first side and then the other half broke
away. The exit on the other side was twice the diameter. A
second shot into the hull below the top of the track had the
same effect. I would definitely say that the one shot through the
turret would have put all the crew out of action. There was also
a Cardon Lloyd 2-man tank at Mission Point, also useless. It
was very light like a carrier with a turret.”
With the tanks at Boram Point and the Nips scuttling inland
things were dull as far as armour was concerned. The boys had
a spot of excitement on May 23rd. Major Cory with two others
and three infanteers were prowling about in the jungle when
they spotted two figures crouched in a hole. The party thought
they were Japs and immediately got busy, but the men yelled
out that they were Indians. Luckily they were not hurt. About
sixty Indians in all were picked up by other patrols. Despite
their privations at the hands of the Japs they were soldiers
through and through. Although ragged and half starved they
stood to attention and saluted when being addressed. Their
delight at being rescued was pathetic.
Maintenance on the tanks took up the rest of the month. The
Tillies had put up a wonderful show mechanically and there was
little wrong with them. The squadron had been notified that
tanks would be required in the campaign inland, but there
would be some delays before a track could be prepared for them


through the rugged country. There was nothing to do but wait
in patience.
The tanks had more than proved their worth during the long
advance from Aitape, and most of their critics were converted
to the need for armour in this type of warfare. The infantry
were loud in their praises, as the Tillies had saved them many
casualties. The tanks, admittedly, had only encountered light
opposition. Apart from a few stray 75-mm. shells, the biggest
Nip gun encountered was a 20-mm. and there was no definite
report of it ever having been fired at a tank. Heavy and light
machine gun and rifle fire had no effect on the armour. The
Japs set their mines crudely and there was little attempt at
camouflage. The engineers did a splendid job in clearing the
path of mines. The infantry also gave the tanks the fullest
support, and their co-operation was excellent in every way.
The tank controllers, particularly Kim McMaster, had plenty
of practice and were expert at getting tank fire on to a given
target at a moment’s notice. Keith Drayton, Mac Walker and
Bill Parks maintained a high standard of efficiency in this work.
Cpl Gailey, of the Sig. Section, worked night and day on the
sig. equipment, and kept it functioning perfectly in all weathers
-by no means an easy task. He was on the job the whole time
checking for faults and making repairs. As a result of his
efforts the Walkie Talkies operated splendidly and proved an
invaluable means of communication in action.
The light team of mechanics who kept the tanks going deserve
a word of praise for their efforts. They worked untiringly, some-
times all through the night, to have the Tillies ready for action,
and the way they did their job was demonstrated by the manner
in which the tanks ploughed their way through everything.
Wherever the tanks went a detachment of mechanics was
always available. During the whole advance a team of from
eight to eleven were always with Advanced H.Q., and it is to their
credit that the old tanks performed as well as they did.
The team of mechanics were:
W.O. W. Hardingham, S/Sgt J. Hicks, S/Sgt F. Middenway,
Cpl Huggins, Cpl E. Woods, L/Cpl F. Jamieson, Cfn R. Griffiths,
Cfn N. Strong, Cfn W. McGregor, Cfn R. Green, Cfn Parkhill.
Period with forward troops: From 13th December 1944 to
13th February 1945.
W.O. D. Rees, Cpl S. Hodge, Cpl L. Beasley, Cpl F. Brown,
Cpl G. Huggins, Cfn E. Hertzog, Cfn T. Verrall, Cfn R. Thomp-
son, Cfn R. Harrison, Cfn G. Proud.


Period with forward troops: From 14th February 1945 to 24th
May 1945.
S/Sgt A. Garrett, Cpl N. Tonetti, L/Cpl J. Williams, Cfn J.
Dillon, Cfn G. Fletcher, Cfn S. Hay, Cfn W. Goss, Cfn D.
George, Pte G. March.
Period with forward troops: 25th January 1945 to 14th March
1945.
This list is not complete, as the lapse of time makes it difficult
to include all the mechanics who carried out their duties so
well under such trying conditions.
Anyone who has had associations with the Matilda will realise
the full-time job the mechanics had, especially when hampered
by lack of spares and working such long distances from the heavy
equipment of the workshops. W.O.s Hardingham and Rees and
S/Sgt Alf Garrett, who were in charge of the various detachments
did a great job. Capt. Broadbent, O.C. Workshops, held the fort
for some time till the arrival of Lieut. Jim Hartman, who proved
a very capable 2 I/C. When Capt. Broadbent returned to the
mainland on compassionate leave, Jim carried on the complicated
workings of the workshops most efficiently. Cpl George Huggins,
welder etc., was a very popular member of the team and spent
long periods with the forward troops. He and his electrical and
gas welding equipment were constantly in demand, and George
later became famous for his casting and making of model planes
and plaques of New Guinea moulded from aluminium from
crashed Jap planes.
Field Park under Lieut. Nealy were always an efficient little
team and how they kept control of the storing, tabulating, and
issuing of the thousands of parts carried would mystify Man-
drake. W.O. Waugh and Cpl Bunny Parslow were very capable
N.C.O.s, and they did a very good job with the forward supplies
carried in a 3-ton binned truck.
By the end of the month the squadron became concentrated
again. Rear H.Q., comprising “A” staff, Workshops, and Field
Park were established at Cape Worn with Advanced H.Q. at
Boram. Ken Swanwick celebrated his arrival at Worn by losing
his orderly room tent. A plane landing on the drome just went
right through it, and according to reports by eye-witnesses the
pace at which Ken left the vicinity would have put a Stawell
Gift winner to shame. Despite the way the squadron were strung
out along the coast the administration work functioned smoothly.
Dave Smith looked after “A” matters with the forward detach-
ment, and Frank Birtwell attended to the “Q” requirements.

Notwithstanding the shortage of supplies Frank did a good job
—so good in fact that questions were never asked as to where he
obtained the goods and chattels. Towards the end of the month
Captain Beverley left to join A Squadron and Major Ewan
Millikin came up to replace him. He lost no time in getting a
thorough grip of the position.
While at Boram numerous recces were carried out to Brandi
Plantation where 2/6 Cav. Commando Regt had made a flank
landing. The inland track offered the usual amount of soft and
difficult going, but the beach route was good. The results of the
recces showed quite a large area workable by tanks, but the Nip
as usual quickly left the low ground and went back to the hills.
35 Bn took over from the Cav. and a troop of tanks was
requested for support. Lieut. Bill Watson took his troop down
to Bn H.Q. at the north end of Brandi Plantation. They
remained there for a possible counter-attack, but nothing hap-
pened and the troop made themselves familiar with the country,
going out on patrols with the infantry. It was while with the
Bn H.Q. that Tpr Chigwidden was acidentally shot by a fellow
member of the crew with a *3B revolver while on guard. “Chig”
quickly recovered from his wounds. Lieut. Keith Drayton
relieved Lieut. Watson and remained there till 11th August
when he rejoined the squadron at Worn.
While the squadron was camped on the Boram strip which
was an excellent area, construction started on the drome, and as
the engineers were short of equipment operators the squadron
offered some who were promptly snapped up. So various members
of the squadron operated dozers, graders and other equipment
and assisted in building the drome. During the slack periods
this lending of operators to the engineers continued—giving the
lads a chance to do something constructive, increase their know-
ledge of mechanical equipment, and help the engineers who had
proved good friends to the squadron.
For the last three months of the war, despite several promising
reports, the squadron took no further part in operations. Train-
ing and maintenance were continued just in case a fight turned
up, but it was not to be. During this period the Japs were on
the northern slopes of the coast range and the problem of getting
the Tillies through the rough terrain was a big one. However,
there is little doubt that had the war continued the tanks would
have got there somehow. Armour had proved its value in the
drive down the coast. Major Cory in one of his reports stated:
The infantry troops are definitely tank conscious now and just


worship the old girls. Even just to have a troop up with them
seems to bump the morale up terrifically.” Anyone who had the
nasty experience of patrolling through the thick jungle where a
Jap could practically touch you without being seen will realise
how true this is. During June the tank troops became concen-
trated again at the western end of Boram aerodrome—not a bad
spot.
A spot of excitement occurred on the night of 4th June when
three Japs infiltrated into the perimeter from the east and threw
a grenade. The only casualties were three tyres on a 6 x 6 truck.
A grenade hurled by a picket in reply failed to explode, but
the picket’s fiery language had the desired effect.
July was another dull month for the boys-most of the time
being taken up with recces and tank maintenance. A visit by
Brigadier D. Macarthur-Onslow was practically the only bright
spot. In his inimitable fashion he gave the boys the “G.G.” and
did his best to get his beloved armour into action again.
On 18th July Capt. Millikin, who had done a first-class job
as Squadron 2 I/C, was recalled to Regimental H.Q., and his
place was taken by Captain Frank Suffren. The month was
notable for the best handout of clothing for about nine months.
Mai Bracegirdle and Frank Birtwell, who had done their best
with no supplies, could hardly believe their eyes when the stuff
came in. There was a rush like a bargain sale, and everyone was
completely fitted out with new clothing. It was just as well, as
the boys were fast approaching the nude stage.


CHAPTER XX
BACK TO WOM AND HOME
V.P. Day— lsth August coincided with the concentration of the
entire squadron at Worn for the first time for nine months.
Despite the lack of grog, the boys let their heads go to celebrate
the end of the war which was announced on a muster parade at
1330 hrs. All thoughts were now turned to home and how soon
they could get there. Fortunately a Covenanter bridge-layer
arrived the day before the end of the war and gave the mechanics
something to play about with for a while. There was no V.O.L.
or any records with it, but it was not long before the mysteries
of its operation were solved and it was coaxed to do its job.
Early in July the squadron had a visit from Maj. Bill Lawson,
OC. Field Park. The visit paid dividends for Bill was instru-
mental in speeding up the arrival of track idler guards, rear
telephones, and the new Australian No. 19 wireless set. Work
commenced immediately on fitting these new components. Work-
shops fitted the track idler guards which required considerable
welding, and difficulty was encountered in getting sufficient
supplies of welding rod. The guards were a big improvement.
Another piece of equipment which arrived was mesh guards for
the engine louvres. These were also fitted and proved very effec-
tive. The Sig. section got to work on the new wireless sets and they
proved most satisfactory. It was a pity that the sets were not avail-
able a lot earlier, for the old sets were a constant headache owing
to their age and faulty tropic proofing. They required a great
amount of attention from the Sig. section and it is to their credit
that wireless communication was as effective as it was. The rear
telephones and armoured telephone box was fitted-not quite
according to blue print, as it was considered that a squadron modi-
fication was more practical. This component was very badly made,
and required considerable alteration and adaptation before it
fitted satisfactorily. Prior to its arrival, the squadron had operated


with a makeshift of its own design, using a power mike and head-
phones. The new equipment was much superior.
After securing the coast the war moved inland and the further
it went the less became the hopes of the squadron for further
action. Though every passable route was reconnoitred, and many
that were impassable, it became clear that if the tanks were to
be used they would have to wait till the engineers got the Big
Road through. Mt Shibarangu was eventually captured and the
advance continued in the direction of Hambouri. With each
advance the squadron made itself familiar with the new country
and never gave up hope of finding passable routes. Many weary
miles were slugged through the mud and slush and climbing
seemingly endless mountains. The engineers did marvellous work,
and the road they eventually made through Sauri Village and
over Shibarangu will be a monument to them for a long time.
During this period Division decided to send off personnel
who had not had leave for twenty months and the squadron
quota of twenty-four bodies eventually left with mixed feelings—
glad of the chance of getting home, but wondering if they were
going to miss out on further operations.
However, V.P. Day arrived before the squadron had a chance
to do anything. It was ironical that after V.P. Day further equip-
ment arrived in the shape of three flame-throwing tanks and a
stripped M 3 light tank for towing limbers etc. Prior to that,
the Covenanter bridge-layer had turned up. The war was over,
but equipment which had been badly needed for about a year
suddenly arrived. The flame-throwers made a bad landing. The
squadron was not notified of their arrival, and Docks Operating
had off-loaded them into deep water-one was drowned and the
other two took in large quantities of salt water. Maj. Cory refused
to take delivery and the tanks were left at 106 Vehicle Park, but
maintenance teams and mechanics were sent down to repair and
maintenance the tanks. The drowned tank was in a bad mess,
as all the electrical equipment was useless owing to the salt
water. The bridge-layer and M 3 light proved of interest and were
kept at the squadron. The M 3 light made a nice run around for
the O.C. Sqn. The flame-throwers were never tried out, as no
operators arrived with them, and none of the squadron were
conversant with this type.
After V.P. Day a natural reaction set in. The question in every-
one's mind was “How long till we go home?" Every effort was
made to provide amenities to while away the time. The squad-
ron acquired a billiard table and two ping pong tables and these


were most popular. Swimming took first place in outdoor sports,
and there were pictures twice a week within 400 yards of the
area. Sixty members of the squadron were selected to attend the
Surrender Parade on 13th September, and they made an excellent
showing. Dressed in jungle greens with scrubbed webbing in-
cluding belt, leg holster and gaiters, black berets with colour
patches, the party did credit to the squadron in appearance,
bearing, and smartness. The parade was held on the Worn strip
and representatives of all units attended. Maj.-Gen. Robertson
received the surrender of the Jap forces from Gen. Adachi at a
simple but impressive parade.
In October Maj. Cory flew to Bougainville to gather informa-
tion from the Regiment about disbanding. While there Lt-Col.
Mills arranged for him to go to Rabaul with the squadron going
there by boat. Gos spent a very interesting five days at Rabaul
before catching a plane back to Lae, where he was delayed for
fourteen days waiting for air transport back to Wewak. During
his absence a Div. parade was held for the C.-in-C. on Wewak
strip and the squadron provided 160 personnel. Once again their
appearance caused very favourable comment.
It soon became apparent that the policy would be to send per-
sonnel home on the points system, and that units would not go
back as a whole but would be broken up and lose unit identity.
This naturally resulted in a hunt for points, and Ken Swanwick
had many wordy battles with claimants for points. The break
up of the squadron commenced in earnest, low pointers being
shot to units all over the place. It was depressing to see the once
proud squadron scattered to the four winds. A cadre of three
officers and twelve O/Rs was retained, most of the O/Rs being
on low points, as it was thought that by being on the cadre they
would at least get home and stand a better chance of being
"f ed - Word was at last received to return the tanks to
106 Vehicle Park. All guns and equipment had to be proofed
and the old Tillies were moved to Dogrito Bay where they were
transported by forty Australian barges to Moem and thence to
the Vehicle Park. The two M 3 lights went round by road towing
the ammo limbers. “B” vehicles were also returned.
Amid great enthusiasm word was received that the squadron
cadre would move on 13th December by the aircraft carrier
Implacable. As a final gesture a work party of Jap prisoners had
n°ii pl n ir P Cam ? T* at W ° m - “ Bul1 ” Walker and Tpr
Bill Phillips saw to it that they did the job thoroughly.
At this stage Worn and the Div. area were deserted, as most
l


of the units had either left for the mainland or moved to Moem.
No one was sorry when the 13th arrived and the squadron cadre
with Workshops and Field Park cadres embussed and moved to
the Wewak strip where all those boarding the Implacable were
assembled. Landing craft took the enthusiastic soldiers to the
aircraft carrier, which sailed in the evening. As New Guinea
receded in the distance it looked rather pleasant in the evening
light and it was easy to forget all about the rain, mud, humidity,
and wogs that went to make up the Green Hell. The trip to
Sydney was one to be remembered for all time. The Royal Navy
did everything possible to make the trip pleasant and comfort-
able. Picture programmes were arranged, concerts and sports
held, and the food was excellent.
The Implacable steamed through Sydney Heads on the morn-
ing of 18th December, and the boys were whisked off to Wall-
grove Camp. There they got a rude awakening, as no arrange-
ments had been made for the reception of the large number of
troops and, to make matters worse, it was raining. A spot of
leave to those that could be spared helped matters until things
could be organised. The various depots requested that nothing
be done about handing over stores till after Christmas so the
festive season was spent by each man to his own taste. The small
matter of a stolen jeep in New Guinea held up things for some
time, but on February the 18th the final clearance was given
and C Sqn 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt ceased to exist.
Though its history was not so very spectacular C Sqn main-
tained its high reputation for efficiency throughout—in spite of
many disappointments. Years of monotonous camps on the main-
land were enough to dishearten any unit, but when it received
its chance the squadron proved its ability to the hilt. It is to be
regretted that greater use was not made of the squadron in New
Guinea, but conditions of the Aitape-Wewak campaign limited
the use of armour.


PART IV
RABAUL REFLECTIONS




RABAUL REFLECTIONS
While the Group was concentrated at Torokina after the cessa-
tion of hostilities, rumours began flying about that Rabaul would
be the destination for a number of low pointers, and for once
the rumours were correct. About the middle of September 1945
a small force known as “4 Troop Detachment" was organised
under command of Lieut. Joe Dent. It was made up of 4 Troop
from A Sqn plus three tanks from the former R.H.Q. Troop,
and two M24’s from the War Office Trials team. Elements from
Sigs, Field Park, and Workshops were also included. The trip
across to Rabaul was made in three L.C.T.s and one 300-ton
vessel, and fortunately for the boys the sea was calm. The first
impression of Rabaul was the accuracy of the Allied air bombing,
ample proof of which was afforded by the twisted hulks of ships
strewn along the foreshore of Simpson Harbour. The town itself
was just a heap of broken concrete, and the tangled undergrowth
stopped only at the roads. Maj. John Mackay and Lieut. Harry
Holliday, who had flown across, welcomed the detachment on
arrival, and later that day the convoy of vehicles made its way
over Tunnel Hill to the camp site at the junction of Coast
Road and Tunnel Hill Road. The site itself did nothing to make
the boys enthusiastic, especially as it was drenched with rain all
the afternoon. However, by hard work, sufficient ground was
cleared to enable the tanks to be parked and tents erected.
Natives from nearby villages were soon on the spot bringing
with them pineapples, papaws, and bananas. Anton, the boss
boy, organised a laundry system on a same day service which was
a godsend to troops who had washed their own clothes for many
weary years. The standard charge was one tin of tobacco a
week. One little chap, Herman, with his bright eyes and Kolynos
smile, became the most popular of the bunch. During the first
four months at Rabaul an abundance of fresh fruit and vege-
tables could be obtained from the natives in exchange for bully
beef and biscuits. Andy Clements was succeeded by Algie


Vaughan as chief trader, and the cooks were able to make fruit
salad the order of the day.
The highlight of the first two weeks was the taking over of
all the Japanese tanks in the area. This semi-ceremonial event
took place on the Rapopo airstrip about 30 miles out from
Rabaul. Maj. Mackay and Col. Yomehara were the central
figures, with personnel from the detachment clad in jungle
greens and black berets formed up opposite the Jap tanks, where
the Nips were at “crews front”. The ceremony was filmed by
newsreel cameras and everything went without a hitch. In two
convoys of forty, the tanks were driven back to the unit lines
by the Nips, with one man from the squadron in charge of each
vehicle. The boys in charge of the tanks will long remember
that drive. All along the route they were saluted by everyone
they passed—Chinese, Indians, natives, and Japs. Some of the
newly liberated Indians, by their wild gesticulations, seemed to
indicate that the Nips should have their teeth kicked in. The
automatic bowing of the natives showed how much they must
have been dominated during the occupation. However, it was
now the turn of the Japs to do the dirty work. Maj. Mackay soon
arranged for a hundred Nips to report to the camp daily for
duty. Lieut. George Joss, who was in charge of them, became
known as “Baron Kord”, and the Nips his “kordies”. The refer-
ence, of course, was to a newspaper strip of Mandrake, which
was popular at the time. The job of armed escort on these work-
ing parties was very popular, and was referred to in the ver-
nacular as “Nip bashing”. There was little need for bashing,
however, as the Japs were almost comical in their efforts to please
and most conscientious in their work. Their officers and inter-
preters kept close check on the way the men worked, and on any
sign of slackness would knock them down with open handed
blows to the face. In the absence of an interpreter, the boys were
able to handle the “kordies” by the use of signs and a limited
vocabulary. Ample evidence of how harmless the Nips were was
demonstrated to Tpr Brown, of War Office Trials, in rather
startling fashion one day. He had a party miles out in Jap ter-
ritory in search of bamboo. He was making his way through
the jungle with the Nips close on his heels carrying machetes
and axes. It suddenly occurred to him what an easy prey he
would be, so he undid the strap on his pistol holster. Soon after-
wards he heard one of the Japs come up behind him calling,
“Masta, Masta”. He ignored him for a while, but when the
man persisted he turned round. The Nip bowed low and


presented him with his pistol which had fallen from the holster.
To do the maintenance on the tanks, forty tank crews and
mechanics were allotted to the detachment. Most of them were
N.C.O.s and they did a good job. The thickness of the armour
on the Matildas was a constant source of amazement to the Nips,
who pronounced it “numba one”. Sgt Tod Prest was given the
job of preparing the medium tanks for use by crews of B
Squadron when they arrived.
During the early part of October B Squadron was being re-
organised at Torokina with the object of going to Rabaul to
take over the Jap tanks which were to be in readiness in case
of any emergency. B Squadron sailed from Torokina in the
River Burdekin on 17th October 1945, and among the equipment
were two motor boats which had been purchased by 7 and 9
Troops for use in Rabaul. The smell of sulphur from volcanoes
greeted the boys on their arrival on 18th October, and the same
afternoon they were taken to the camp by truck. Despite the
new arrivals ‘‘Lap-Lap Laundries Inc.” were able to meet the
demand for extra wash boys without increasing their charge.
4 Troop detachment was absorbed and the squadron re-organised
on 21st October when Maj. Mackay formally handed over com-
mand to Maj. Vernon on the squadron parade ground. At this
time the Unit was slightly over strength, maintaining six troops
of tanks. They comprised two Matilda troops and four Jap
medium troops, each of three 47-mm. tanks, with three 57-mm.
tanks in reserve. For the rest of the month the boys were busy
improving the area and seeing that the Nips did their job. Jap
electricians wired the tents for electric light, and the Nip tailor
did much more mending and altering clothes than Hyme Gold
ever did. Lieut. Frizell and Tpr Lucas of War Office Trials put
up a good show in the construction of a landscape garden in
front of the administration tents. Flagstone paths, bordered by
neat bamboo fences, were laid down to each tent, and shrubs
and cannas were planted in the gardens. A small area near the
entrance, bordered by moulded white concrete posts and hang-
ing chains, contained the sqn mascot-a tankette and a raised
concrete model of the regimental colour patch painted in the
two shades of blue. Heavy seas towards the end of the month
produced a striking effect as the waves struck Tomatikotop
Reef about one mile distant. At regular intervals a tower of
white spray at least 30 feet high rose from the reef.
During October Mackay and Lieuts. Ted M[arr and
Spence Curley went to New Ireland where they supervised


the destruction of twenty tanks. Major Mackay returned from
Rotabu and the other officers went on by barge to Kavieng. They
were met by Rear Admiral Tamira, who was wearing a British
D.S.C. with his other ribbons. Kavieng itself was a large, well-
defended base ringed by searchlights, ack-ack guns, and coastal
artillery. From there the two man party, feeling fairly important,
went by road 180 miles up the east coast to Namatania. The
trip was very well organised by the Nips. The road in places
was excellent, though most of the bridges over the numerous
small streams had been effectively bombed. It was learned that
M.T. boats had played havoc with transport along the road dur-
ing the war. They came in as close as 20 yards from the shore at
night to strafe convoys of trucks. The interpreter was a well
educated Jap, who subscribed to the London Times before the
war. It was a very sore point with him that his advance sub-
scription had not been remitted to him when the war broke out!
The tanks at Namatania were driven into the sea over a reef by
the Nips who then swam clear.
November opened with Major John doing more engineering
work when he supervised the lifting of a 2500 gallon sheet-iron
tank on to a 25 foot tower near the well for use in the showers
and ablution area. Several of the boys who tried out aquaplaning
behind 7 and 9 Troop boats didn’t need any showers that day—
they got enough water in the harbour. Much interest centred in
the trial of a Japanese amphibious tank on 3rd November. The
tank entered the water smoothly, the drive being transferred
from the tracks to the twin screws as it floated. Sitting low in the
water, it resembled a surfaced submarine. During the month
extensive recces were made of routes to the various compounds
in Nip territory, the object being to get the tanks there quickly
in case of an emergency. Much to everyone's relief the squadron
got out of doing guard at the compounds, and instead the tanks
were held in reserve in a state of readiness. Each day one troop
was on two minutes’ notice, and the next for duty on two hours.
During the trips to the Jap compounds it was surprising to see
the extent of the defence system for the area. The “sons of
heaven” certainly left nothing to chance. At various points
weapons and stores of all descriptions were being collected for
dumping. The sight of row upon row of artillery pieces and acres
of shells was ample reason to be thankful for the atomic bomb.
Sightseeing trips helped to relieve the monotony of camp life.
Lieut. John Adamson and a party from 7 Troop climbed Matupi,
the new volcano, and took photographs of the crater. Souvenir


hunters armed with torches explored some of the 40 miles of
tunnels in the area. However, all the more valuable equipment
was guarded, which somewhat limited the activities of potential
“scroungers”. Despite the fact that there were more captured
Jap swords than troops in the area Division allotted only one per
officer and one per two O/Rs. What happened to the others is
a mystery, but with every second man in possession of a sword
the bottom fell out of the market. In the early days of the war
the Yanks would give up to ,£IOO for a good sword.
Training courses in D and M and gunnery on the Jap medium
tanks were commenced, and all tank crews received instruction
in both wings. Credit for working out the mechanisms of the
Juki goes to Sgt Hec. Pearson and Tpr “Doc” Coble. These two
enthusiasts were never happier than when surrounded by return
springs, breech blocks, and firing pins. The M.G.s were fired on a
miniature range in the area and the tanks were driven up the
coast to an open range past the 118 A.G.H to fire the 47-mm.
and 57-mm. guns. The shots were fired out to sea at targets
dropped from a barge. Both guns were very accurate and the
47-mm. apparently packed a fair punch. The muzzle blast and
flash were considerable, and the recoil rocked the tank on its
tracks. When driving the mediums most of the drivers were
cramped and found “double shuffling” and driving from the
i ight hand side strange for a while, but they were soon able to
handle them efficiently. Batteries losing their charge was the main
source of trouble, but this was overcome to a large extent by
“tow starting”. “Shorty” Pettigrew tried his hand at driving one
of the tankettes. Even he had no room to spare and bumped his
head as the tank got under way. A Nip saw him do this and
raced over to the tank. Meekly bowing, he offered “Shorty” his
cap. The squadron at this time had tanks to burn. At one stage
there were 92 Jap tanks on the lines—mediums, lights, tankettes,
and amphibious tanks. Twenty-four mediums were kept in order
for use by crews and two of each type were prepared for the
War Museum and the M.G.O. Branch. Most of the lights had
the turrets removed and were converted for use as tractors out
on the compounds where they proved a great success. The turrets
were also taken out there and used as pillboxes by the infantrv
on guard 7
Lieut. Marr took over from Lieut. Joss as “Baron Kord" and
camp construction continued steadily until the squadron had one
ot the best and most comfortable camps in the area. 6 TrooD
received a scare on 27th November when one of their tanks ran


over an unexploded bomb. Two similar ones were found in the
vicinity, and a warning notice was promptly erected. Later, the
Bomb Disposal Unit found that the bombs were not alive, and
had been placed there and not dropped by plane. On the last
day of the month Maj. Ewan Millikin took over command of the
Sqn Group from Major Vernon, who returned to Torokina. His
appointment coincided with the dumping into the sea of thirty
37-mm. guns from light tanks and 3800 37-mm. shells on orders
from 11 Div. At this stage sqn appointments were: 2 I/C, Capt.
Les Beyer; L. 0., Capt. Joe Dent; A 8c Q, Lieut. Morgan Hawkes;
recce officer, Lieut. Bill Roughton; troop leaders, Lieuts Spence
Curley, George Joss, John Adamson, Ross Richards, Bill Gately,
Ted Marr. Lieut. Frizell was in charge of War Office Trials.
Sgt Hec Pearson had the job of S.S.M., and during the month
Cpl Ivo Corr was promoted to sgt, and Tprs McShane, Shaw,
Kev. Honan, Doug Hopkins, and Gordon Yabsley to corporals.
Things began to happen in December. During the month 106
personnel left for the mainland: the War Office Trials team, 70
on leave, and 24 with over 160 points. Gaps in the ranks were
partly filled by 50 reinforcements from A and H.Q. Sqns at Toro-
kina. During the month Major Millikin was appointed president
of the War Trials Committee in Rabaul, and some squadron
members took the opportunity to attend some of the sessions at
which Japanese war criminals were tried. In their ample spare
time all ranks were able to patronise the beach and take part in
various sports. The two speed boats bought in Torokina from the
“Kiwis” by 7 and 9 Troops were seldom idle—Alec Parry-Okeden
and Kev. Honan saw to that. Invariably they headed north to the
A.G.H., and from there—well, direction didn’t matter much. Two
tennis courts were built on the edge of the parade ground, but
were not used until 22nd December owing to the lack of racquets.
A few dilapidated racquets arrived from Torokina, and all the
budding Davis Cup stars got to work. Jim Mclntyre gave the
younger players the benefit of his experience and skill, and soon
the standard was quite reasonable. The squadron cricketers also
wielded the willow to good effect, Mark Schell being the star
performer.
Night life centred around the recreation hut, the pride of Kev.
Povey, caretaker and librarian. An education programme kept a
big proportion of the squadron occupied. Lieuts George Joss and
Ross Richards, aided and abetted by Gordon Yabsley, did their
best to remind the boys of their schooldays, and incidentally im-
parted much useful knowledge. The courses ranged from oral


Japanese, book-keeping, and maths to theory of music. The
Education Hut was available for an hour each day to those doing
private study on correspondence courses. Most of this activity
lapsed owing to increasing duties when large batches of high
pointers left for the mainland.
The chief feature of Christmas Day was an elaborate dinner.
In addition to excellent rations, delicacies, beer, and cigarettes
were bought from canteen profits. Officers and N.C.O.s carried
out the time-honoured custom of waiting on the men. A severe
earth tremor occurred early on 29th December; it was just as
well it did not take place three days earlier as everyone would
have put it down to a Christmas hangover. An interesting visitor
during the month was Lieut. Noel Schafer, an original member
of A Sqn, who left the Unit soon after its formation. Lieut. Colin
Salmon, A.D.C. to Maj.-Gen. Robertson, also called in to renew
old friendships. The New Year was ushered in in true style with
bells ringing, horns blowing, and singing. It was music in the
ears of all those with over 130 points, most of whom left for
the mainland for demobilisation during the month. Among those
to soldier on were S/Sgt Jim Mclntyre (S.Q.M.S.), Sgt Owen Prest
(S.S.M.), Cpl Smith (Transport) and Tpr Kev. Ford (Tech
Store) who were deferred. By the middle of January there were
only five officers and 67 other ranks remaining, but reinforce-
ments from the infantry later built up the strength again.
Jap carpenters assisted in laying down a dance floor in the
recreation hut, and the welfare committee decided to christen it
with a dance on 16th January. This was eagerly looked forward
to as arrangements had been made to invite a number of
A.A.M.W.S. The great day arrived and Tom Davies and a band
of helpers waxed the dance floor and put the finishing touches
to the hut. But all their efforts were in vain, as the A.A.M.W.S.
Commandant phoned to say that only six girls would be coming.
Deciding that the competition for half a dozen girls would be
altogether too keen, the committee cancelled the dance and
staged a bucks' party instead. Later, two small private parties
were held, but unfortunately for readers, they must have been
held in secret for no details are available from any source. Aus-
tralia Day was a gala day for all troops in the area. During the
morning the Rabaul Race Club held its inaugural meeting
which was a great success. The 5/- tote was very popular, and
most of the squadron had a winning day. This was largely due
to the tips given by the squadron trainer, Lex Sweaney, who
picked four winners and a second. It was just as well that the


boys did not plunge too heavily on the squadron horses, Three
Legger and The Hornet, which finished fourth in their respective
races. Craft of all shapes and sizes took part in the regatta on
Simpson Harbour during the afternoon, and the natives enter-
tained a big crowd at night with their dances and singing.
The afternoon of 27th January was memorable for the
language of one officer and 20 O/Rs, who were to proceed on
leave by the Georgetown Victory. They left camp in high spirits
to sail for home, but returned in half an hour, looking as if they
had just attended a funeral. And they had reason to be. 300
reinforcements from 9 Div. for Rabaul refused to leave the boat,
and so the leave draft could not get on. However, things were
smoothed out the following day, and the boys for the mainland
went aboard without further ado. A lot of infantrymen from
Borneo, including some from the Georgetown Victory, were
posted to the squadron and tales of the luxurious life in the
“Indies” and the campaigns of the Division became monotonous.
One night there was a particularly heavy war winning session,
and the next morning a notice was to be seen outside a certain
tent—“ Three Thousand Japs Buried Here”.
February was marked by a visit by Brig. D. Macarthur-Onslow
and torrential rain for most of the month. The heavy rain
resulted in the collapse of the Education Hut, and much damage
to the tennis courts and cricket pitch. Brig. Macarthur-Onslow's
visit was in the nature of a farewell to his long association with
the Armoured Corps—B Sqn at that time being the sole remain-
ing formation. In an informal address to the squadron on 19th
February he thanked the 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt Gp for the
splendid work they did against the Jap in New Guinea and the
Solomons. He congratulated all armoured troops on the part
they played in the war and on the excellent co-operation they
had given him throughout. He outlined the aims of the newly
formed Armoured Corps Association and emphasised that co-
operation by all would be the main factor in its success. The
Brig.’s visit was a gesture typical of him. All who had served
under his command had great admiration for him as a soldier and
a gentleman. As usual, the Brig, took the opportunity of finding
out how the Jap tanks worked, and even the Nip flame-thrower
tank was coaxed to hurl an effective spurt of flame 20 yards long.
He also took part in recces to several of the Jap compounds.
The strength of the squadron was gradually built up during
the month by reinforcements from infantry battalions until it
totalled five officers and 95 other ranks. Most of the new men


were given intensive training in tank D and M and gunnery.
War Artist Schur visited Workshops on several occasions to recon-
struct incidents concerning the A.E.M.E. during the action on
the Buin Road in Bougainville. Lieut. Bill Roughton, Cpl
Gordon Yabsley, and Tprs Wilkinson and Sprod acted as tech-
nical advisers.
There was some excitement on Ist March when explosions in
the ammunition dump on Talili Bay shook the earth and lit up
the sky. The explosions grew in intensity, and at 2130 hours a
tank was called for to help rescue some personnel in danger.
Lieut. Don Humphrys and Tpr Tom Ryan played the part of
the rescuers, but when their Tilly arrived at the scene the
danger had passed and the “fireworks” gradually died down.
4th March saw the last of the Matildas—the gallant old warriors
which had played such a prominent part in the history of the
regiment. The remaining six Tillies left in convoy for the
Ordnance Vehicle Park, and the boys who had worked with
them for so long stood and watched them with mixed feelings
as the old girls rumbled out of the camp and disappeared round
the bend. An order by Division which laid down that men with
18 months tropical service should be the first to get to the main-
land caused a flutter, as most of the twenty-six men involved
in the squadron were considered “key" personnel. Div., however,
insisted that they would have to be replaced so Maj. Millikin
conducted a tour of the infantry shows and managed to muster
thirty likely looking reinforcements. To keep things running
smoothly it was decided that eight of the boys due for the
delights of Australia would have to be temporarily deferred.
They were Sgt Gordon Yabsley, Cpls Sprod, Ryan, Wilkinson,
West, and Sullivan and Tprs McNamara and Grimston. What
they thought of the position is unprintable, but on 29th March
Tom Ryan had vanished. It is not known whether he had been
reading Wells’ Invisible Man, but it is known that his disap-
pearance coincided with the departure of the Canberra . On 18th
March Lieut. Ted Marr’s “houseboat”, alias the Jap amphibian
tank equipped with oriental awning, came to grief in the choppy
surf and was towed ashore by the DB.
To the great dismay of all hands “Lap-Lap Laundries Inc.”
shut down shop on sth April. It was not due to finance or
business troubles, but to an outbreak of cerebro-spinal menin-
gitis in the native villages, resulting in the banning of all natives
from Unit areas. It was tough on the boys having to do their
own washing after such a pleasant break, and the sales of soap


powders at the canteen increased greatly. Max Bell, who will be
remembered for his swimming prowess, was one who was not
affected by the closure of the native laundry service. The day
before he was instructing in the tank lines when told to move
to the airstrip immediately. Needless to say he broke all records
and managed to catch the plane just as the door was being
closed. There was no enthusiasm among the boys when applica-
tions were called on 13th April for volunteers to serve a further
two years in the army. They had had enough of it by then, and
there were no volunteers. And weren’t they glad they had not
acted hastily, for the next day Maj. Millikin was notified that
the Unit would be leaving by the middle of May. Morale im-
mediately rose to record heights. Maj. Millikin hit the head-
lines in Guinea Gold on 16th April, when as President of the
War Crimes Tribunal he passed the death sentence on seven
Formosans and four Japs found guilty of atrocities.
Most of the squadron attended the second and final meeting
of the Rabaul Army Race Club on Easter Saturday, 20th April.
About 7000 were present to urge on their fancies. Dan McKenna
rode his mount, Cedric, into second place in the first race, but
the squadron’s success finished there. The squadron’s horse, The
Smiler, by The Leer out of The Look, was able to leer and look
at all the horses to his heart’s content from his vantage point at
the rear of the field. Dan McKenna’s good oil was no good—the
O.C. lost £3 on it. The month ended with thoughts of home
uppermost. The long service men had developed sore eyes
scanning the horizon for boats. To get a splendid flow of
language from any of them it was only necessary to sing the old
song, “I’m waiting for ships that never come in” in their vicinity.
Even the Nips were getting as scarce as cigarette papers, as
thousands had been loaded on to Liberty ships at Kokopo for
repatriation. At Easter time there were far more new faces round
the lines than old ones. The only original members of the Regi-
ment left were Lieuts Bill Roughton and Ted Marr and S/Sgt
Jim Mclntyre. They had certainly soldiered on. Thirty-one men
who had joined the show at Murgon and Southport were still
holding the fort also. They were: Capt. Les Beyer, Lieut. Don
Humphrys, Sgt Gordon Yabsley, Cpls Sprod, West, Wilkinson,
Sullivan, Hawkins, Vaughan, and Tprs Arnott, Ballard, Barrett,
Brennan, Tom Brown, Davies, “Darky” Diggerson, Edgeworth,
Gosbell, Grimston, Harvey, Mulholland, Johnny Leigh, Dan
McKenna, McNamara, Kev. Povey, Turner, Bill Turner, R. N.
Walker and Jim Wright.


May saw the end of the Unit which was declared redundant.
Long service personnel finally got away, the rest were marched
out to Details Depot, and a cadre of two officers and 10 other
ranks remained. There was much fun in returning twenty-four
medium Jap tanks to Kokopo. Several broke down on the way
and one almost went over a cliff near Raluana Point. With the
assistance of a D 8 tractor they all got there eventually. There
were several earth tremors early in the month, the first being
felt at 0800 hrs on 4th May while the O.C. was inspecting the
squadron. For once there was much movement on parade but it
was in unison. Most of what was left of the squadron attended
the final parade of Australian troops in the area on 22nd May
when 11 Aust. Inf. Bde commanded by Brig. Monaghan paraded
oh the sports ground. Many native troops of the Pacific Island
regiments were also present. The parade was of a high standard
and was addressed and inspected by Maj.-Gen. Morris, G.O.C.
of 8 M.D. Cleaning up the camp site occupied the remainder of
the time, and in June the cadre said goodbye to Rabaul. The
affairs of the Unit were wound up in Sydney, and thus almost
four years after its formation the Regiment ceased to exist. The
honour of being last remaining member of the Unit went to
Ewan Millikin, who was discharged on 4th September 1946.

DECORATIONS, HONOURS AND AWARDS
DISTINGUISHED SERVICE ORDER (D. 5.0.)
NX70790 Major K. M. H. Arnott.
CITATION:
Major Arnott commanded B Squadron 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt during opera-
tions in South Bougainville. His tanks went into action for the first occasion
during the battle for Slater’s Knoll in April 1945 and were immediately
successful in inflicting tremendous losses on the enemy. 15 Aust. Inf Bde
resumed the advance along the Buin Road again supported by Major
Arnott’s squadron. During the attack at Anderson’s Junction he was wounded
while leading his tanks but rejoined the squadron after a brief absence.
Throughout the ensuing advance to the Hari River and the capture of that
objective, Major Arnott rendered outstanding service. His advice to infantry
commanders and his aggressive tactics succeeded on numerous occasions in
demoralising and disorganising the enemy and forcing him to abandon
strongly held positions. This allowed the tanks to occupy important objec-
tives with minimum casualties.
MILITARY CROSS (M.C.)
(Immediate Award)
5X11347 Lieut. R. G. Scott.
CITATION: For gallantry, initiative and outstanding leadership when in
contact with the enemy.
At 10 o’clock on morning of 21st May 1945 C Company 58/59 Aust. Inf.
Bn while advancing along the Aitara Track came under heavy fire from
a strong enemy position covering the road. Lieut. Scott’s Troop was sup-
porting the company. Lieut. Scott moved forward with the infantry on
foot and in spite of the enemy fire, made an accurate reconnaissance of the
enemy dispositions. He then moved his tanks forward and with complete
disregard for his own safety, directed fire on to the enemy position. The
position was annihilated and two Juki machine guns and five light machine
guns captured.
Lieut. Scott continued the advance with an infantry section to investigate
an enemy position on the Buin Road near the Pororai River. His party was
forced to take cover from machine gun fire. Lieut. Scott left his section and
crawled forward to a position from which he could observe the enemy.
From this position he called forward his tanks by wireless and directed
fire on to the enemy. The enemy position was silenced and one 70-mm. gun
and one twin barrelled machine gun were captured.


By his gallant actions and skilful handling of his tanks, Lieut. Scott was
responsible for the destruction of two strongly defended enemy positions and
for the capturing of enemy equipment. Throughout these engagements
Lieut. Scott’s courage, coolness and quick thinking whilst under enemy fire
had been an inspiration and an example to his troop and to the infantry
with which he worked.
5X8691 Lieut. L. E. Forsyth.
CITATION: OPERATIONS-SOUTH BOUGAINVILLE: For gallantry,
initiative and outstanding leadership when in contact with the enemy.
Lieut. Forsyth commanded a troop which supported B Company 58/59
Aust. Inf. Bn in their advance to the Hari River along Buin Road. At 9
o’clock on the morning of 6th June 1945 the force came under heavy fire
from high ground overlooking the approach to the river. The company
was forced to ground by the intense machine gun fire.
In the absence of the infantry company commander, who became a
casualty, Lieut. Forsyth took charge of the company, rallied the force and
led them on to capture the position. During the operation Lieut. Forsyth
moved on foot with the leading tank and directed fire on to the enemy
positions.
By his fine example, courage and initiative under most difficult condi-
tions Lieut. Forsyth completely overcame a most dangerous situation and
smashed an enemy position which threatened the advance.
MILITARY CROSS
(Periodical Award)
NX70805 Lieut. C. G. McMaster.
CITATION: For gallantry and distinguished service in action.
On 10th May 1945 during the battle for Wewak, Lieut. McMaster was tank
control officer, from the ground, of the leading troop tanks. His untiring
energy, ready initiative, and complete disregard for his own safety enabled
the troop of tanks to gain their first objective, knocking out machine gun
emplacements, thus ensuring, with the support of D Company, 2/4 Aust.
Inf. Bn, that the approaches to Wewak were secure. From there the troop
of tanks and D Company, 2/4 Aust. Inf. Bn attacked and captured the high
ground. Only through excellent control from the ground and decisive action
were the tanks negotiated up the steep bomb-cratered track, gaining the
high ground where their support saved casualties among the infantry and
fire directed by Lieut. McMaster quickly silenced any opposition. The
personal courage and inspiring leadership throughout the campaign of
Lieut. McMaster has given great confidence to tank crews.
Member of the Order of the British Empire (M.8.E.)
WX17099 Capt. D. B. Hill.
CITATION: OPERATIONS-SOUTH BOUGAINVILLE: For gallantry,
initiative and outstanding leadership when in contact with the enemy.
Capt. Hill, officer commanding B Squadron, 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt Work-
shops, was responsible for the maintenance and repair of the tanks during


operations in conjunction with 15 Aust. Infantry Brigade from April to
June 1945. The success of the tank operations has been due largely to his
skill and devotion to duty. He has made the repair of tanks and equipment
in forward areas his own personal responsibility, and he has shown great
courage in working under fire.
On 22nd May 1945 he moved forward with a small party and a D 8 tractor
to recover a tank on the Aitara Track. The party came under fire from an
enemy machine gun and 47-mm. gun. The D 8 was damaged and the
driver was pinned down by fire. Capt. Hill moved forward with an Owen
gun and covered the driver while he escaped. He later returned with a
small party and recovered the damaged tractor.
By his courage and example Capt. Hill has inspired his men, working
tirelessly under trying conditions and without regard to his own safety.
VX60587 T/Capt. J. D. Fagan.
CITATION: Dec. 44-Aug. 45, Bougainville.
In a letter of commendation from the A.O.C. Islands Area (Air Commo-
dore Roberts) the following is extracted: “I would particularly like to men-
tion Captain John Disney Fagan and I strongly recommend that for extreme
devotion to duty and for services far beyond the normal expectation he be
recommended for the highest award that is within your power. It has been
largely due to his effort in the briefing of pilots that the close support work
was so successful and devoid of many incidents that jeopardised the safety
of friendly forces. 7
This officer’s work with the R.N.Z.A.F. during the Bougainville Campaign
was of an exceptionally high order particularly as the R.N.Z.A.F had not
previously operated with Aust. A.L.O.’s. The close and friendly liaison
attained between 2 Aust. Corps and the R.N.Z.A.F. and the efficiency and
smoothness of all supporting Air Ops was due in no small degree to the
efficiency and untiring efforts of Capt. Fagan.
MILITARY MEDAL
(Immediate Award)
VX103648 Sgt. R. S. Whatley.
CITATION: OPERATIONS-SOUTH BOUGAINVILLE: For gallantry
initiative and outstanding leadership when in contact with the enemy.
On 5 May 1945, Sgt Whatley was crew commander of the tank leading the
advance down the Buin Road. At 11 o’clock in the morning his tank received
a direct hit from an enemy 75-mm. gun and his wireless operator was
seriously wounded. *
Sgt Whatley dressed his operator’s wounds. Then, although he was fully
aware that the enemy had his tank under observation, he opened the tank
turret and regardless of the danger to himself, carried his wounded com-
rade to safety. With his wounded comrade safe, Sgt. Whatley raced to his
tank through heavy enemy fire and again assumed command. With his tank
leading, the infantry were able to continue the advance and the objective
was captured. J

5X14615 Cpl. C. R. Hockey.
CITATION: OPERATIONS—SOUTH BOUGAINVILLE: For gallantry,
initiative and outstanding leadership when in contact with the enemy.
During the action at Slater’s Knoll on sth April 1945 Cpl Hockey com-
manded a tank in action. During the course of this action he was seriously
wounded. Although suffering intense pain, Cpl Hockey realised that all
available tank support was vital to the success of the action. He refused
to withdraw and continued to engage the enemy.
During this critical period Cpl Hockey’s tank, whose fire he directed
skilfully, inflicted heavy casualties on the enemy and undoubtedly avoided
heavy casualties to our own infantry. Only after the action was completed and
success achieved, and two hours after he had been wounded, did Cpl Hockey
permit his operator to inform the troop leader of his wound. He was then
evacuated to the medical dressing station.
Cpl Hockey’s bravery and self-sacrifice made it possible to keep a tank
in action, and materially assisted in routing the enemy.
NX92169 Cfn A. R. S. Oliver.
CITATION:
At 1400 hours on 31st March 1945 NX92169, Cfn Oliver of B Squadron
Wkshops A.E.M.E. 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt Wkshops was ordered to proceed
with a jeep train from Slater’s Knoll to Shinru River in order to evacuate
casualties from A and B Companies 25 Aust. Inf. Bn.
At approximately 1500 hours this jeep train was ambushed at 883272 and
most of the crews killed or wounded.
Cfn Oliver took cover and watched the enemy arrange a further ambush.
He remained in a position of observation and awaited an opportunity to
escape, however as he was lying within a few yards of the Jap ambush such
escape would not have been possible till dark.
At 1700 hours a patrol was sent forward to rescue the ambushed jeep train.
As they approached down the track it was obvious to Cfn Oliver that this
party would be caught in the enemy ambush. Although he was within a
few yards of the enemy, Cfn Oliver stood up and shouted a warning to the
approaching party.
Cfn Oliver was immediately fired on by an enemy machine gun and
seriously wounded. Cfn Oliver by his calm initiative and complete disregard
for his own safety in warning his comrades was responsible for saving them
from heavy casualties and enabled our troops to wipe out the enemy.

2/4 AUST. ARMD REGT
SPECIAL ORDER
by
LT-COL. T. MILLS
COMD 2/4 AUST. ARMD REGT
Officers, N.C.O’s and men of C Sqn,
On the occasion of the cessation of hostilities with Japan, I would offer
my congratulations and appreciation for the manner in which you have
carried out your role in the WEWAK campaign.
Your courage, determination, and untiring effort reflect great credit, and
your exploits have been watched with interest and pride by the remainder
of the regiment.
Ido not doubt that, however long we have to wait before discharge, you
will continue to uphold the high standards of discipline which you have
maintained in the past.

H.Q. 3 Aust. Div. (A.1.F.)
18 June 45
Lt-Col. T. MILLS M.C.
2/4 Aust. Armd Regt
The completion today of the relief of B Sqn of your Regiment has
prompted me to review the record of that Squadron since it has been under
my command.
Approximately ten weeks ago B Sqn first went into action as part of this
Division. On that occasion it played a deciding part in a memorable battle
which resulted in a victory of which every member of this Division will
always be proud; the victory at SLATER’S KNOLL. Since then it has been
in the forefront of an advance which has carried us forward from the
PURIATA to the MOBIAI. And not only has it been in the forefront; it
has made the advance possible and prevented heavy losses in valuable lives.
I would appreciate your action in passing this expression of my thanks


to Major ARNOTT and all ranks under his command, with the expression
also of my admiration for the courage, devotion to duty and skill in opera-
tions which he and all his officers and men have shown on all occasions.
W. BRIDGEFORD, Maj.-Gen.
G. 3 Aust. Div. (A.1.F.)
H. 3 AUST. DIV. (A.1.F.)
7 JUNE 45.
Dear Mills,
It is very pleasing indeed to note the splendid progress being achieved
in our operations.
This is primarily due to good planning by all Comds and Staffs, and by
the splendid fighting quality of all troops participating.
The support given by the Gunners, Engineers, Armd personnel, Sigs and
all those responsible for delivering supplies to the forward Infantry troops,
was also of the highest order and, without which, such good results would
not have been obtained.
Comd 2 Aust Corps has also asked me to convey to you and your Com-
mand, his congratulations to all concerned, on the fine performance of
units of this Div during recent operations.
W. BRIDGEFORD, Maj.-Gen.
Comd 3 Aust. Div.


UNIT HISTORIES
2/11 AUST. ARMD CAR REGT
The history of D Squadron is the history of the 2/11 Australian
Armoured Car Regiment itself which came into being at Cowra
in August 1941 with Lt-Col. Sheehan as Commanding Officer and
Lieut. S. C. Graham as Adjutant. The personnel were all from
New South Wales and had been carefully chosen by a special
interviewing officer stationed at the main recruiting depot. After
the formation of Headquarters and A Squadrons, the Regiment
moved to Greta where it was attached for training to 1 Austra-
lian Armoured Brigade. Here, the tempo of training was stepped
up under the guidance of Brigadier Hinton, and here, too, B and
C Squadrons were brought up to strength.
The G.0.C., Major-General J. Northcott, had gone to the
Middle East to choose a location for the final preparation of the
Division whose embarkation was projected for the early New
Year. This plan, of course, was cancelled with the entry of Japan
into the war, and there followed a reorganisation of Australian
forces. Shortly after this, the Regiment moved to Tamworth and
Lt-Col. Sheehan was recalled to Army Headquarters, the new C.O.
being Lt-Col. O. W. Rennick. The establishment of the Regiment
was increased to four fighting squadrons and D Squadron was
formed, the strength of the Unit being over 1200 officers and
other ranks. In the New Year the Regiment, with the units of
1 Australian Armoured Brigade, entrained for Singleton where
a tank battle range was in course of construction. Up to this
stage equipment was most inadequate. A.F.V.s ordered had been
diverted to other theatres, and all training had been done in a
miscellaneous assortment of trucks. However, some Australian
pattern armoured cars (Rovers) and scout cars came on strength.
The armoured cars, soon to be known from their shape as “slit
trenches”, were poorly armed and for war purposes useless
vehicles, but were, as it turned out, suitable for training and in
later training in long distance reconnaissance proved quite com-
fortable and cheery homes.


Another move, this time on foot to Dungog, where more camp
construction, slit trenches and wide dispersion were the order of
the day. Here Major T. Mills M.C., (2 I/C Regiment) and Capt.
F. C. Taylor (Adjutant) joined the Unit. Both these officers were
from the 6 Division Cav. Regiment. More armoured vehicles
became available and jeeps replaced the motor cycle combina-
tions of which there were two in each troop. Major-Gen. H. C.
H. Robertson had replaced Major-Gen. Northcott and prepara-
tions were made for divisional manoeuvres to take place on the
north-west plains of New South Wales. Hope was still entertained
that the authorities might still see fit to give the Division an over-
seas operational role. The divisional exercises commenced in the
latter half of the year and for three months the Division lived
under the most rigorous circumstances. At the conclusion of the
exercises, the armoured forces were reorganised and 2/11 Ar-
moured Car Regiment was put on a reduced establishment,
reverting to three fighting squadrons.
After due consideration it was decided that D Squadron and
certain key personnel from Headquarters Squadron and the Ist
Reinforcements would transfer to form, with the two Brigade
Reconnaissance squadrons, the 2/4 Armoured Regiment of the
3rd Armoured Division to be assembled in Queensland. On 2nd
November 1944 the 2/11 Armoured Car Regiment, less these
personnel, marched out en route to W.A.
In this State and under the command of Lt-Col. Rennick till
the Regiment was disbanded at Wallgrove in July 1944, and
enjoying the very personal interest of Major-Gen. H. C. H.
Robertson who with pride considered it as his “own”, the Regi-
ment continued to enhance its reputation. Well trained, highly
disciplined, its prestige unsurpassed, its reputation envied, it was
a great calamity that this grand body of men was not privileged,
as a unit, to see action.
B SQUADRON
B Squadron, formerly the 2/2nd Armoured Brigade Reconnais-
sance Squadron, and originally the 2/2nd Independent Light
Tank Squadron, was formed in December 1941, to man MK VI
light tanks in a belated attempt to assist the already doomed
Bth Division in Malaya. Personnel volunteered from units of
the 2nd Armoured Brigade representing New South Wales, Vic-
toria, Tasmania, South Australia and West Australia. The
squadron was granted a hectic four days’ final leave, and on


4th January 1942, reported back to the A.A.F.V. School, Pucka-
punyal. The following day, the C. 0., Major Wade, informed
the squadron that the proposed task in Malaya had been can-
celled. The next day, personnel returned to their original units,
until 27th January 1942, when the squadron re-formed to move
to the 7th Infantry Training Centre, Foster, Victoria. At Foster,
an Independent Training Centre, training was mainly dis-
mounted, the troops having their first opportunity of getting to
know one another.
From Foster, the squadron moved by road to Puckapunyal,
arriving on 21st February to become the 2/2nd Armoured Brigade
Reconnaissance Squadron. For approximately the next four and
a half months, the Unit continued with general vehicle training,
with emphasis on reconnaissance work. Equipment used by the
Unit during this period included: American M 3 light (General
Stuart) tanks, Australian armoured cars, Australian scout cars,
American scout cars, the 2-pr carrier, and the close support mortar
carrier which was tested for the Directorate of A.F.V.
In June 1942, Major Wade left to command the 2/10 Ar-
moured Regiment. The 2 I/C, then Captain Grieve, became
O.C. with the rank of major. On 9th July 1942, the squadron
including vehicles moved by rail to Greta, New South Wales,
arriving on 11th July.
While at Greta, the squadron carried on with wing training
and preparation for divisional manoeuvres, meanwhile being the
subject of numerous experimental changes in establishment.
On 19th August, the squadron moved from Greta at the head of
the 2nd Armoured Brigade, to an area at Boolcarrol approxi-
mately 14 miles from Wee Waa, on the north-western plains of
New South Wales. The area at Boolcarrol was in the nature of
a tactical laager, from which the squadron reconnoitred the sur-
rounding district. Training was intensive and the life Spartan,
but occasionally relieved by official (and/or unofficial) sanction
to accept some of the many hospitable invitations which were so
characteristic of the people of the district.
On October 24th the O.C. told personnel that the squadron
was to become B Squadron of the 2/4 Armoured Regiment.
Feeling among the troops was divided; the independent spirit
still being strong. One school of thought believed that incorpora-
tion into a regiment would mean the end of the comparatively
formal atmosphere and self-imposed discipline which had pre-
vailed in the Unit up till then. Another school of thought main


tained that, with tanks, the possibility of action was greatly
increased.
Early in November, the squadron moved to an area at Myall
Vale approximately 7 miles from Wee Waa, and there met the
prospective A and C Squadrons, with whom it was destined to
wait twenty-two months, as a regiment, before sailing for New
Guinea.
C SQUADRON
C Squadron, formerly 2/1 Australian Armoured Brigade Recon-
naissance Squadron, and originally 2/1 Independent Light Tank
Squadron, was formed at Tamworth in December 1941. It was
Xmas Eve when the glad tidings went abroad that a special light
tank squadron was to proceed immediately to Malaya to deal
with the menace of Jap tankettes. Though few men in the
Brigade had ever seen a tank, there was a big rush of volunteers
for the new squadron and finally some 200 were selected; 2/5, 2/6,
2/7 Armoured Regiments, 2/11 Armoured Car Regt and Brigade
Headquarters, all being represented. Maj. I. Murdoch, then
8.M., 1 Australian Armoured Brigade, was appointed to com-
mand, with Capt. A. Bennett as his 2 I/C. Following a hurried
36 hours' pre-embarkation leave, the squadron concentrated at
Narellan, near Sydney, on 31st December 1941, and the routine
bustle of a hurried embarkation fully occupied the next few
days. Hopes were at their highest when the blow fell. The
squadron was inspected by Major-Gen. Northcott, and in a brief
address he announced that the embarkation had been cancelled.
Intensive training on foot, with M.T. and small arms, together
with week-end leave to Sydney did much to heal the wounded
morale. Mobility was practised, with plenty of convoy work and
bivouacs as far south as Jervis Bay. Three old Vickers MK V
light tanks, which arrived in February, gave most of the squad-
ron their first view of a tank and “took a belting” from many
who were destined to become expert tankers. During this period
too, the squadron built up a spirit of camaraderie which never
dimmed—holding all ranks was a bond of sympathy and good
fellowship which formed the basis of lasting friendship and
understanding.
In March 1942 the squadron's name was changed to 2/1 Aus-
tralian Armoured Brigade Reconnaissance Squadron, and shortly
afterwards the Unit moved to Singleton and came under com-
mand 1 Australian Armoured Brigade. More equipment arrived,


including four General Stuart light tanks, armoured cars (slit
trenches), scout cars, and jeeps, which enabled the squadron to
train in its reconnaissance role. In June, Major Murdoch relin-
quished command to assume command of 2/5 Australian Ar-
moured Regiment and Major C. Lethbridge from 7 Division
Cav. Regiment became O.C.
Training with the new equipment continued until August
when the squadron spearheaded the “advance” of 1 Australian
Armoured Brigade to the Narrabri Plains; Squadron Head-
quarters was established near Edgeroi and operational training
commenced. Throughout the manoeuvres the squadron was
always in the van in its reconnaissance role, and reached a high
standard of efficiency in night convoys, map making and general
reconnaissance. Its operations covered a wide area—as far west
as Walgett and as far north as the Queensland border; it seldom
remained long in one area, and became so expert in moving
that the entire squadron could be ready to leave its harbour in
less than half an hour. On 18th October Major Lethbridge in-
formed the squadron that it was to form part of a new armoured
regiment, the 2/4th. Thus almost a year after its formation, the
Unit made its last convoy from Edgeroi to Myall Vale where it
became C Squadron, 2/4 Australian Armoured Regiment.
7 AUST. MOTOR REGT
This Unit was originally the Ist Australian Horse (not to be
confused with the Ist N.S.W. Lancers which later became the Ist
Light Horse Regiment) and was formed about 1899. In 1904 this
Unit was reorganised as the 3rd Light Horse Regiment and con-
tinued as such until 1912-13 when it was again changed to the
11th Light Horse Regiment. During the 1914-18 War the 11th
Regiment was used as a recruiting and training regiment for
the supply of reinforcements to the 7th Light Horse Regiment
then serving in Palestine.
A general reorganisation took place in 1919, and the 7th
Light Horse was raised in the area from Moss Vale in the north,
to the Victorian border, and from Young in the west to the
coast. Peacetime training in camps and local parades were carried
out till the outbreak of war when longer and more intensive
training camps were held. When Japan declared war the regi-
ment was called up for full-time duty, part of which was on the
south coast during the threat of invasion. At this location the
advent of mechanisation caused the 7th Light Horse Regiment


to become the 7th Motor Regiment. In August 1942, having the
required percentage of volunteers, it was declared A.I.F. and the
black and red, with a grey background, was the colour patch of
the 7th Australian Motor Regiment which was soon disbanded.
First draft to leave consisted of two officers and 58 O/Rs who
were posted to the 2/4 Australian Armoured Regiment. The
remainder of the 7th were first drafted to another motor brigade
and shortly afterwards to A.I.F. infantry divisions (chiefly the
7th Division with which they served in New Guinea and later
Island campaigns).
The guidon of the 7th Light Horse Regiment carried battle
honours for all the major engagements of the Palestine Cam-
paigns in the 1914-18 War and of certain battles of the Boer War.
Many of the ex-commanding officers of the 7th Light Horse Regt
later proved themselves capable and distinguished soldiers, such
as General Sir Granville Ryrie and Major-General Macarthur-
Onslow in the First World War, and Brigadier Broadbent who
was decorated for his work in the Malayan Campaign of the
Second World War.
6 AUST. ARMD BDE
In tracing the history of 6 Armoured Brigade it is necessary to
go back to pre-war days when, in South Australia, there existed
the 6 Cav. Brigade, a part of 2 Cav. Division with Headquarters
in Victoria; the regiments comprising the Brigade were 3 Light
Horse, 9/23 Light Horse and 18 M.G. Regiment. On the out-
break of war many of the members of the Brigade enlisted im-
mediately, and each of the regiments was placed on a war footing.
It is of interest here to note that Brigadier (then Lt-Col.) A. S.
Blackburn, V.C., who commanded 18 M.G. Regiment took with
him twelve officers from his Regiment when he formed the
famous 2/3 M.G. Battalion. It is of interest also to note that Lt-
Col. Caddy, who commanded the 2/4, was an officer in the 9/23
Light Horse before enlisting with 6 Division Cav.
In common with all other militia brigades the 6 Cav. Brigade
passed through many vicissitudes, with high hopes blasted again
and again till they were called up for full time duty in 1941.
Early in 1942 the brigade became 6 Motor Brigade with 3, 9 and
18 Motor Regiments. A little later, the 18th became 12 Armoured
Regiment, and with 3 and 9 Motor Regiments, A.S.C., 101 Lt
Fd Amb., 3 Reconnaissance Squadron and Brigade Headquarters
moved to Victoria to become 6 Armoured Brigade. Shortly after


arrival in Victoria the 3 Motor Regiment was disbanded. The
12, 13 and 14 Armoured Regiments (the two latter having for-
merly been the 13 and 14 Light Horse, Victorian Regiments)
were concentrated at Gherang with Brigade Headquarters at
Geelong. The 3 Reconnaissance Squadron and 9 Motor Regiment
were at Mount Martha.
In July 1942 when 2 Armoured Brigade moved to Singleton the
whole of 6 Armoured Brigade moved into Puckapunyal where
Col. R. F. Monaghan was in command. With the arrival of
Grant tanks in August, training was soon in full progress. Brigade
Headquarters, 3 Reconnaissance Squadron and 12 Armoured
Regiment had become A.I.F. units in July 1942, and the other
regiments had a very large percentage of A.I.F. volunteers. The
Brigade formed part of 2 Armoured Division which, because of
the changing situation and the fact that 1 Armoured Division
was left in Australia, was destined for disbandment. A high state
of efficiency in armoured training was reached as more and more
of the personnel passed through various courses at the A.F.V.
School.
Col. Monaghan was succeeded by Brigadier Wells in November
1942 and shortly after his arrival the order for disbandment
came. The Brigade Signal Squadron was transferred to the newly
formed 4 Armoured Brigade early in 1943. The 13 Armoured
Regiment was brought up to full A.I.F. strength by combining
it with the 14th and was transferred to 2 Armoured Brigade.
Many of the armoured personnel from the 12th went to 1 Ar-
moured Brigade while C Squadron went to 9 Armoured Regi-
ment. Members of 3 Reconnaissance Squadron and 9 Motor
Regiment were transferred to either 1 or 2 Armoured Brigade or
3 Army Tank Brigade. When 3 Armoured Tank Battalion was
disbanded in 1944, many of its members came to the 2/4, and
with those who had previously joined formed quite a fair propor-
tion of those who were to share the ups and downs of the Regt
from Murgon to Southport, Mililat, Aitape, Wewak, Bougain-
ville and Rabaul.
2/4 AUST. ARMD REGT SIG. TROOP
When orders came through to break up 2 Armd Bde in Novem-
ber ’43, it became necessary to bring 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt Sig.
Troop, which was greatly under strength, up to full W.E. in
officers and other ranks and as close as possible to war equipment.
Lieuts Willmott and Fowler were ordered to select 18 O/Rs


from the personnel of 2 Armd Bde Sig. Sqn including 13 Armd
Reg. Sig. Tp. Volunteers were numerous from the Sig. Sqn and
gradually the troop was compiled, numbering eighteen includ-
ing Sigs Mannix and Howlett who were absent at schools. Sgt
Hindhaugh was selected as Troop Sgt. Stores presented a more
difficult problem and non-W.E.T. pattern equipment had to
be taken in lieu of W.E.T. pending advice from 4 Aust. Armd
Bde. Some training of personnel was carried out, mainly in the
use of automatic weapons and small arms. Vehicles were fitted
up as instrument mechanics’ mobile workshops during the
latter part of November and by Ist December the troop was on
the move from Murgon to Southport with 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt.
Officer postings were Lieut. Fowler and Lieut. Willmott and
it was decided to operate with Lieut. Willmott in charge of
maintenance and Lieut. Fowler as Regt Sig. Officer. The 2/4
Sig. Troop with the 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt arrived at Southport
in December and came under command 4 Aust. Armd Bde.
2/4 ARMD REGT WKSP A.E.M.E.
This unit, which was to play such a large part in the successful
operations of the Regiment, was originally formed in Pucka-
punyal early in 1942 as 2 Armd Bde Wksp under the command
of Capt. J. J. (“Chaddy”) Chadwick. Many of the artificers had
already attended a six months’ technical course at the Caulfield
Technical School in Melbourne.
In those earlier days the Brigade was equipped with Bren
carriers in the absence of tanks, and it will be remembered to
their credit that they kept the Brigade mobile when the change
over to tanks took place, their service then ranging from motor
cycles to the heaviest fighting equipment at that stage used in
Australia.
The Workshops, although designed as a mobile unit, carried
out a static role while at Puckapunyal, except for the training
run to Yanakie on Wilson’s Promontory. Many of the boys still
talk about the time Transport Sergeant Phil Shappere was K.O.'d
by a tin helmet in the struggle for a seat in the 3-tonner whilst
on a map reading exercise run by Lieut. Jim Fletcher, and was
revived by means of grubby handkerchiefs soused in a most un-
savoury gutter at the rear of the Yarram Hotel.
When the Brigade moved to the Greta area in mid-1942, the
high sprits of the Workshops boys were soon well known in the
neighbouring towns of Singleton, Maitland and Cessnock. It


was here that the Adjutant( familiarly known as “The Old Grey
Mare”) lost his jeep whilst engaged on Town Picket duties. The
subsequent Court of Inquiry never seemed to get to the bottom
of that incident—perhaps the yarn may be told one day.
During this period, the Workshop, now under the command
of Capt. R. R. Sinclair, was closely linked with its opposite num-
ber, the Brigade Ordnance Field Park, which was then com-
manded by a Canadian, remembered for his red hair and ice
hockey.
The Workshop was really tested on the Narrabri Plains exer-
cises, where the Brigade was deployed and living under service
conditions for the first time. As well as doing actual repair and
recovery, sentries and ack-ack posts were manned, and many will
recall the stir when the G.O.C. Maj.-Gen. H. C. H. Robertson
(“Red Robbie”) visited the camp near Namoi River bridge and
seeing an ack-ack Bren unattended, purloined it and returned to
his H.Q. in high glee and a fast car. The gallant gun crew, which
included Cam Jones, Staff Hardingham and that “immortal”
D/R, Doug. Beckerleg, lost no time in commandeering the
nearest jeep and following the culprit at a discreet distance to
his H.Q., where, driving in unchallenged past the alert sentry,
he removed the gun from the Staff car and reported to the
G.O.C. that they had recaptured their weapon. Instead of cen-
sure, the Unit was congratulated on the exploit.
With the reorganisation of the Armoured Divisions in late
1942 the Workshop moved north with 2 Armd Bde to Murgon,
via Goondiwindi and Cooyar. Here Capt. J. J. Chadwick again
took command, Capt. Sinclair being appointed B.E.M.E. 2 Armd
Bde with the rank of major. With the movement to New Guinea
of 2/8 Armd Regt the Workshop had the privilege of preparing
their tanks for tropical service. They still tell at reunions of the
time Digger Pearson and Jack Connors, in Murgon on a Sunday
afternoon and endeavouring to keep out of trouble, joined up
with the Salvation Army Band and were last seen heading up
the main street with Jack beating like a veteran on the bass
drum.
Late in 1943, the Brigade and 3 Armd Div, of which it was
part, was removed from the Order of Battle, and 2/4 Armd Regt,
the only regiment not disbanded, prepared to join 4 Armd Bde
at Southport. As an independent armoured regiment it was to
have its own Workshop, Ordnance Field Park and Signals troop,
and it was both fortunate and natural that 2 Armd Bde Wksp
should be reformed as 2/4 Armd Regt Wksp. “Chaddy” was


destined not to see service with the boys and again handed over
command, this time to Maj. Neil Tudehope.
Of all the places where the units had trained, none was quite
like Southport. It was here that the boys knew they were at last
on the way, and therefore they worked hard, trained hard and
played hard. Jungle and surf each played their part in the
hardening-up process, and it was here that the 2/4 Armd Regt
Gp really got together, learned about itself and cemented re-
lationships between the Regiment and the Workshop. “Digger”
Pearson became famous here for his remarkable “Hotel Aus-
tralia”, with its public bar and saloon bar, where all ranks were
welcome. It has since been claimed that in the last month at
Southport 1450 gallons of beer were dispensed.
The long-awaited day came in August 1944, when the Work-
shop accompanied the Regiment to Madang for its first taste of
tropical service, jungle juice and battle-worn Matildas. The
latter had been used by 1 Army Tk Bn and had been in the
tropics already for over a year, and the next twelve months
brought a never-ending task as the boys sweated to keep tanks
and radio equipment in a servicable condition. It wasn’t all hard
work, however, and there are many memories happier than the
smell of decaying coconuts. Boating and sailing were excellent
relaxations and many ingenious craft saw good service, including
the homemade boat in which Jack Nelson won the “Madang
Regatta”.
The Regiment was not destined to function as a unit, however,
and each squadron saw service in separate areas. The Unit L.A.D.
under Capt. Ted Humphries was absorbed into the Workshop
and three separate self-contained squadron workshops were
formed—A Sqn Wksp under Lieut. Bob Richards, B Sqn Wskp
under Capt. Ted Humphries and later Capt. Don Hill, both went
with their respective squadrons to Bougainville, and C Sqn Wksp
under Capt. Col. Broadbent went with their squadron to Aitape
and Wewak. Troubles had only just started, and the boys were
tested to the utmost and not found wanting in carrying out
major modifications to the Matildas, as well as their normal
tasks of maintenance and repair and recovery. Equipment for
these tasks was always in short supply, and gave full scope for
initiative and ingenuity. American equipment was begged, bor-
rowed and swopped for grog. Jap equipment was converted and
used to good effect. C Sqn had a particular problem to over-
come in this way as its own equipment was not unloaded at
Aitape, but eventually finished on the beaches at Leyte in the


Philippines. Capt. Col. Broadbent used all his talents to make
good the deficiencies by these means.
In their respective areas of operations, the Squadron Work-
shops worked in complete unity and harmony with their respec-
tive squadrons, whose detailed stories, contained elsewhere in
this book, became at the same time the history of the 2/4 Armd
Regt Wksp. That their history was worth its place in the annals
of war in the S.W.P.A. is proved by the awards for gallantry and
meritorious service gained by individual members and given a
place of honour in this record of events.
2/4 AUST. ARMD REGT ORD. FD PK
The Unit was originally formed as 2 Aust. Armd Bde Ord. Fd
Pk at Puckapunyal, Victoria, between November 1941 and
March 1942 by Lieut. G. Johnson with a strength of one officer
and 40 O/Rs. It was not until March 1942 when command was
taken over by Capt. George Hewitt that the Unit functioned
technically.
Its first move was to Singleton, N.S.W., in June 1942, and it
later took part in the armoured manoeuvres at Narrabri. On the
breaking up of 1 Aust. Armd Div. in November 1942 the Unit
moved with 2 Aust. Armd Bde to Murgon, Queensland, and
under an experimental arrangement of A.E.M.E. came under
command of 2 Aust. Armd Bde Workshops as a stores section.
Members of the Unit became absorbed in the Workshops, and
it was not until Capt. W. N. Lawson was appointed to command
that the sub-unit was reformed with its original members.
When 3 Aust. Armd Div. ceased to exist the Unit went to
Wondai and functioned as a 3 Echelon Fd Pk to all troops in
the Murgon area. On 25th November 1943 its designation was
changed to 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt Ord. Fd Pk, and on 30th
January 1944 it came under command 2/4 Aust. Armd Regt
at Southport. From January to April there was endless work on
the conversion of stocks from M 3 mediums to Matildas and also
alterations to the War Establishment.
During this period Capt. Lawson acted as technical adviser
to Landops on the W.E. requirements of the Group’s higher
establishments. While preparing to leave for overseas the Unit
was planned and trained with the higher establishment so that
it could be implemented with the least disorganisation when
the authority came through.
Warning notice for movement was received in July, which


resulted in a rush to case and tropic proof 200 tons of stores,
some items weighing 2J tons. Splendid work by all resulted in
the job being completed ten days before the Unit sailed on
25th August. On arrival at Mililat, N.G., advice was received
that the authority for implementation of the higher establish-
ment had come through. This meant an increase in strength to
three officers and 45 O/Rs, but these reinforcements did not
arrive until December.
Three sub-parks had to be formed, and the first under com-
mand Lieut. Nealy left with C Sqn for Aitape in November
1944. The second, B Squadron sub-park with Lieut. Stone as
0.C., left with B Sqn in December for Bougainville. A squadron
sub-park in charge of Lieut. Beard left for Bougainville with
the squadron in May 1945. The H.Q. of the Unit also left for
Bougainville at the same time and was established at Torokina.
A small detachment was required to move with Scott Force to
Soraken, North Bougainville in June, and was capably handled
by Cpl Borlase as N.C.O. in charge. A further call was made for
a detachment to move with B Sqn to Rabaul to handle Jap tank
equipment. This detachment of six O/Rs with Sgt Queen in
charge was later transferred as an armoured section to 120 Ord.
Fd Pk when the squadron at Rabaul became redundant.
