HISTORY
Negotiations Anent Union
BETWEEN
THE SYNOD OE EASTERN AUSTRALIA
■AND THE
SYNOD OF AUSTRALIA IN CONNECTION WITH
THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH OF
SCOTLAND.
The negotiations anent between the Synod
of Australia in connection with the Established
Church of Scotland and this Church, appear, by the
discharge of the two Committees, to have now come
to a close; and yet we regret to say no union has
been formed, and no satisfactory result has followed
from these negotiations.
A union on a satisfactory basis was declared by
both parties to be exceedingly desirable. The
people generally hailed the movement with satis-
faction, and an earnest hope was entertained that
the end aimed at would be attained. The nego-
tiations, however, having ended in failure, disap-
pointment will naturally be felt, and blame imputed
to one or other by the parties concerned. That


there were difficulties in the way no one will deny,
but whether these difficulties were in themselves
absolutely insuperable, or whether they might not
have vanished before a really honest and anxious de-
sire to effect a union, and a sacrifice of all purely per-
sonal and party feelings and interests, may well be
made a question. But as no union has been formed,
nor any immediate prospect left that such will yet be
the case, the Presbyterian population of the colony
will naturally ask, How does this come about ?
What has led to this unsatisfactory result ? Is
there any blame attributable to any party, or has
the failure resulted entirely from the inherent and
insuperable difficulties of the case ? If there be
blame in the case, with whom does the blame lie ?
It is not for us to say dogmatically with whom the
blame lies. The facts of the case, the materials for
forming a judgment, we beg to lay before the Chris-
tian public in the following brief history of the whole
negotiations on this subject, leaving it with them to
judge for themselves at whose door the blame lies, if
there be blame at all, and to draw for themselves
whatever inferences they may think warranted by
the facts of the case.
The next subject which occupied the attention of
the court was the proposed union between this
Synod and the Synod of Australia, in connection
with the Established Church of Scotland. The
following is a narrative of all the steps that have
been taken in this matter


• Proposal of Union.
In February, 1854, a letter was received by the
Moderator of the Synod, intimating that the Synod
of Australia, in connection with the Established
Church of Scotland, had appointed a committee to
affect anent an union with this Synod, and request-
ing the Synod of Eastern Australia to appoint a
committee for this purpose. At the meeting of-this
Synod, in May, 1854, a committee was appointed to
confer with the committee of the other Synod as to
the practicability of an union between the two
bodies.
Conference on Union,
On Monday, the 29th May, 1854, the committees
by the Synod of Australia and by the
Synod of Eastern Australia respectively, to confer
on the subject of the union of the two Synods, met
in the Bible Depot, King-street, Sydney. There
were present on the part of the Synod of Australia,
the Rev. J. B. Laughton, Moderator, the Rev. Dr.
Fullerton, and the Rev. James Coutts, and on the
part of the Synod of Eastern Australia the Rev.
William Lumsdaine, Moderator, the Rev. A.
Salmon, the Rev. A. Paul, and D. L. Waugh, Esq.,
J.P., Elder.
Before proceeding to deliberate, the Rev. Dr.
Fullerton and the Rev. Mr. Salmon, senior minis-
ters present, engaged in prayer. The conference
continued in deliberation for several hours, and ad-
journed to the forenoon of Tuesday. The conference
was conducted throughout in an amicable and bro-


thcrly spirit; there seemed to be a sincere desire
on the part of both committees to accomplish the
object for which they were appointed by their re-
spective Synods, without any compromise of prin-
ciple on cither side. After very mature deliberation,
certain articles that might form the basis of the
proposed union were agreed upon; and these will
be submitted to the Synods at their first meeting.
Notwithstanding the obstacles that stood in the way
of the contemplated union, the spirit in which the
conference was conducted augurs well for the final
settlement of this most important question.
BASIS OF UNION,
The following are the articles of union which it
was unanimously resolved by the Committees in
conference to recommend to their respective
Synods :
1. The two Synods at present known by the
respective designations of the Synod of Australia
in connection with the Established Church of Scot-
land and the Synod of Eastern Australia shall be
united under the designation of—
2. The basis of union shall be —subscription to
the Westminster standards, in their integrity and
in their true and original import, viz.: The Confes-
sion of Faith, the Larger and Shorter Catechisms,
the directory for public worship, and the form of
Presbyterian government agreed upon by the As-
sembly of Divines at Westminster, and the Second
Book of Discipline ; and for the purpose of avoiding
all possible doubt and dispute as to the interpreta-
tion of the doctrine laid down in these standards,
concerning the spiritual independence of church


courts, and the rights of the Christian people to
elect their own pastors, the United Synod shall
hold and declare that there is only one tenable sense
in which the said doctrines can or ought to be re-
ceived, namely, that the civil power has no right,
on the ground of granting temporal support, or on
any plea or pretext whatsoever, to interfere with
the spiritual independence of the church on the
settlement of ministers, in the administration of
ordinances, or in the infliction and remission of
church censures.
3. The United Synod desires to cherish friendly
relationship with every faithful and evangelical
church throughout the world, adhering to the same
standards, and maintaining the same form of wor-
ship and discipline, that has no denominational con-
nection with any church now existing in the United
Kingdom.
4. Ministers, probationers, and students of any
communion holding the Westminster standards shall
be deemed eligible for admission into the United
Synod, on satisfactory evidence being produced as
to their character and qualifications, and on their
signing the articles of union.
5. Whereas the system of civil endowments ex-
isting in this colony is sinful on the part of the
State, and inexpedient on the part of the Church,
the Synod of Australia, in connection with the
Established Church of Scotland, before uniting with
the Synod of Eastern Australia, shall relinquish
those stipends which her ministers at present re-
ceive from the Colonial Government.
6. That if, at any future period, the United
Synod shall see fit to accept of temporal support
granted by the State on Scriptural grounds; and if
the civil power, on the pica of giving that support,


shall encroach on the rights of the people and the
independence of the Church as above declared; and
it a majority of the Synod shall submit to these en-
croachments, then the Church property of all kinds
vested in the Synod shall belong to the ministers
and people resisting such encroachments, and faith-
fully maintaining the Westminster standards, as ex-
plained in the Basis of Union.

Convener,
Committee of the Synod of Eastern Australia.

Convener,
Committee of the Synod of Australia.
The above Articles of Union were submitted by
both Committees to their respective Synods at their
next half-yearly meeting. The deliverance given
by each Synod will be found below. The Synod of
Australia met at Sydney on Wednesday, the 25th
of October, 1854, and the Synod of Eastern Aus-
tralia on Wednesday, the Ist of November, 1854,
and during the sitting of the latter body (before the
subject of the proposed union had been taken up),
the following communication was received :
Sydney, Ist November, 1854.
Rev. Sir—As convener of the committee on union of
our Synod, I write to ask if it would suit the convenience
of your committee to have conference with us to-mor-
row, at any hour before 12 o’clock noon. I shall be
obliged by an early reply.
I am, rev. sir, your obedient servant,
WILLIAM PURVES.
Rev. J. Lumsdaine, Convener, &c.


This proposal was assented to by Mr. Lumsdaine.
Bible Society Dep6t, King-street, Sydney, 2nd
November, 1854, which day a conference was held,
by desire of the Committee on Union, in connection
with the Synod of Australia, between said Com-
mittee and the Committee on Union of the Synod
of Eastern Australia. Present: On the part of the
Synod of Australia Committee—the Rev. William
Purves (Convener), and the Rev. James Coutts ;
and on the part of the Synod of Eastern Australia
Committee —the Rev. W. Lumsdaine (Convener),
the Rev. A. Salmon, Mr. D. L. Waugh, and Mr.
John Little. The Conference was opened with
prayer by the Rev. W. Purves, after which the
basis of union agreed upon by the respective com-
mittees at their last meeting was read by the Rev.
W. Lumsdaine. The Rev. W. Purves read the de-
liverance of the Synod of Australia on the report of
their committee, which was a material alteration of
the basis of union agreed upon at the last conference
by the two committees, to be recommended to then-
respective Synods. The Committee on behalf of the
Synod of Eastern Australia objected to the altera-
tion made in the said articles of union, but agreed
to submit to their synod the articles of union pre-
viously agreed upon, along with the modification of
these articles now submitted to the Conference by
the Committee on behalf of the Synod of Australia.
(Signed) WILLIAM LUMSDAINE,
Convener of Committee of the Synod
of Eastern Australia.
WILLIAM PURVES,
Convener of Committee on Union of
Synod of Australia.
The following is the deliverance of the Synod of
Australia, on the report of their committee :


Sydney, November ltd, 1854,
Before proceeding to a consideration of the report
of the committee on union, it was unanimously re-
solved that union of the two synods is highly de-
sirable, and that every legitimate effort be made
to effect that object.
The Synod then proceeded to consider the articles
of union, recommended in the Report generally, and
resolved—That whereas various matters connected
with former unhappy divisions are introduced into
the said articles—matters which it appears to this
Synod should, in view of a union, rather be buried
in oblivion—it is not expedient to consider the
said articles in detail, but that it be agreed to
proceed to draw up other articles, embodying
the principles on which it appears to this Synod
that a desirable and permanent union can be
effected.
The following articles were accordingly submitted
and approved:
I. The basis of union shall be subscription to the
Westminster Standards in their integrity, viz.—the
Confession of Faith, the Larger and Shorter Cate-
chisms, the directory for public worship, form of
presbyterial government agreed upon by the As-
sembly of Divines at Westminster, and the Second
Book of Discipline.
11. Whereas various opinions are conscientiously
entertained by members of the two Synods respect-
ing the present system of indiscriminately support-
ing ministers of religion in this colony, it is agreed
that liberty of conscience shall not be constrained
in this matter, but that each congregation adhering
to the United Synod shall be at liberty to accept or
refuse support from Government, as may seem to
them most advisable.


HI. That the United Synod shall hear the
designation of
The Synod further resolved that the union shall
not he consummated without the sanction of the
Established Church of Scotland.
Extracted from the Minutes of Synod of Aus-
tralia, hy
James Coutts,
Synod Clerk.
The following is the deliverance of the Synod of
Eastern Australia on the Report of their
Committee: —
The Rev. William Lumsdaine, Convener of the
Committee on Union with the Synod of Australia,
in connection with the Established Church of Scot-
land, gave in a report of the procedure and the con-
clusions arrived at up to this stage, by the joint
committees of the respective Synods; whereupon
the court came to the following deliverance: —
u The Synod unanimously expressed their approval
of the diligence of the committee, and of the whole
manner in which they have discharged the difficult
and delicate duty committed to them. They also
cordially approve of the articles of union, agreed to
by the committees of both Synods met in conference.
Although the Synod are deeply impressed with the
desirableness of an union formed on Scriptural
grounds, they do not see how any beneficial union
could be effected, except on the principles and
conditions contained in the articles of union
above referred to, and agreed upon by both
committees. The Synod observe, from the re-
port of their committee, that the Synod of Aus-
tralia have totally changed the basis of union


agreed to by their own committee. The Synod con-
sider that at this stage they might have concluded
any farther negotiation on this subject, but anxious
that nothing should be left undone to eifect an ob-
ject so desirable in itself, instruct their committee
to seek another conference with the committee of
the other Synod, and lay before them an extract of
this minute.”
After some correspondence between the conveners
of the two committees as to the time of meeting,
another Conference was held at the Bible Depot,
King-street, Sydney, on Wednesday, the 6th De-
cember, 1854, at 2 p.m. Present: On the part of
the Synod of Australia—the Rev. William Purves,
Convener, and the Rev. James Coutts; and on the
part of the Synod of Eastern Australia—the Rev.
William Lumsdaine, Convener, the Rev. A. Salmon,
and Mr. John Little. The Conference was opened
with prayer by the Rev. W. Lumsdaine, after which
he read an extract minute containing the deliverance
given by the Synod of Eastern Australia on the
report of their Committee on Union. After a
lengthened deliberation, the committees agreed to
leave this matter open until the next meeting of
their respective Synods.
(Signed) WILLIAM PURVES,
Convener.
WILLIAM LUMSDAINE,
Convener.
From all the procedure in this matter it is
manifest—
1. That the Synod of Eastern Australia responded
at once and quickly to the proposal for conference
anent a union from the Synod of Australia, in con-
nection with the Established Church of Scotland.


2. That it is fully admitted that the Conferences
were conducted in a friendly and brotherly spirit.
8. That after deliberation, both Committees
unanimously agreed to a basis of union, engaging to
recommend that basis to their respective Synods.
4. That the Synod of Eastern Australia unani-
mously approved of the basis of union thus recom-
mended, and thanked their Committee for then
diligence in the matter. That the Synod of Aus-
tralia, in connection with the Established Church,
of Scotland, disapproved of the basis of union re-
commended by their own Committee, and substi-
tuted another basis materially different from that
agreed upon by the two Committees.
The Rev. William Lumsdaine, Convener of the
Committee, gave in a report of the procedure ami
conclusions arrived at up to the stage by the first
committees of the respective Synods, calling the
attention of the Court to the following deliverance
given by the Synod of Australia, in connection with
the Established Church of Scotland, on the subject
of the proposed union, at their recent meeting.
At the half-yearly meeting of the Synod of Aus-
tralia, in connection with the Established Church
of Scotland (vide the official report in the Herald
of sth May, 1855), the subject of union was again
taken into consideration, when it was moved by Mr.
Laughton, and seconded by Mr. Carter, “ That the
Committee on Presbyterian Union be re-appointed,
and instructed to seek a further conference with the
Synod of Eastern Australia, for the purpose of en-
deavouring to accomplish the desired object.”


The following amendment was moved by Dr, Ful-
lerton, and seconded by Mr. Milne, “ That as this
Synod resolved at its last meeting to unite with the
brethren of the Free Church on the basis of sub-
scription to the Westminster standards in their in-
tegrity • it being agreed that each congregation
attached to the United Synod shall be at full,
liberty to accept or refuse Government support, as
may seem advisable, and understood that such union
should not be consummated without the consent and
formal sanction of the Church of Scotland; and
whereas these conditions were declined by the
Synod of Eastern Australia, it is at present inex-
pedient to do more than to re-appoint our com-
mittee, with instructions to receive any proposal on
union which may be made by the brethren of the
Free Church, but the committee is not to depart
from the former decisions of the Synod.”
The amendment was carried by the casting vote
of the Moderator,
The Synod, on a review of the whole case, and
taking into account the recent decision of the other
Synod, unanimously agreed to approve of the dili-
gence of the committee, and of their whole pro-
cedure in this matter, and although the prospect of
a Union is much diminished by the deliverance of
the Synod of Australia in connection with the
Established Church of Scotland, nevertheless the
Synod re-appoint their Committee, and instruct
them to receive, and to regard favourably, any pro-
posal for Union that may be made to them in ac-


cordancc with the Dasisof Union already submitted
to, and approved of by, the Synod.
The Rev. Mr. Lumsdaine, Convener of the Union
Committee, stated that no negotiations had been
held with the other Synod since the last report was
given in, and therefore that he had no formal report
to make. The Synod thereupon, on the motion of
Mr. Mackic, seconded by the Rev. Mr. M'Culloch,
adopted the following deliverance : “ That from the
attitude assumed by the Synod of Australia in con-
nection with the Established Church of Scotland,
in reference to union between that body and this
church, there is no present prospect of further nego-
tiations on the subject; the Synod, therefore, while
it still earnestly desires the union of Presbyterians
on a satisfactory basis, discharges the Committee on
Union, and in doing so feels called on to express the
conviction impressed on it by the terms in which the
Synod of Australia, in connection with the Esta-
blished Church of Scotland, rejected the basis of
union agreed upon by the two committees, that that
Synod did not and docs not really desire union.”
The Synod also appointed the following committee,
namely, the Moderator, and Messrs. Lumsdaine and
Mackic, to draw up a detailed account of the nego-
tiations with the other Synod as to union, from the
commencement down to the present date, for publi-
cation. This to be brought up before the rising
of the court/
The Rev. J. Cameron gave in a detailed report
regarding union, with a view of publication. The


report was approved of, and
for general circulation.
Such is the history of the
subject. It is to be regretted
not different from what it has been. But altho
the two bodies have been unable or unwilling
coalesce at present, the day, we trust, is not far dis-
tant when these negotiations will be resumed, under
happier auspices—when there will be a greater cen-
tripetal force within, and fewer obstacles without.
We do not despair of yet seeing the Presbyterians
scattered throughout these Australasian colonics all
united under one banner, and advancing in one un-
divided phalanx to assault the hosts of darkness.
The Lord hasten it in his own time.
In name and by authority of the Synod of East-
ern Australia.
