FOREWORD
IA/HEN Mr. William Scott consented to permit me
to prepare his reminiscences of the Port
Stephens Aborigines for publication, I felt that 1 had
been afforded the opportunity of contributing some-
thing of especial value to the scant store of
literature extant that deals with the lives and
customs of the earliest inhabitants of a little
known, but historic, part of New South Wales. It
is with the hope that the public will appreciate the
recording of facts that might otherwise have gone
unnoted that I present this booklet to the world.

“The Port Stephen’s Blacks"
Because so few of the aboriginal
inhabitants of coastal New South
Wales remain, and because so little
has been recorded of their habits and
customs, I have felt that, for the en-
lightenment of future generations,
it is a duty devolving on me to com-
mit to paper some of my early re-
collections of the Port Stephens
tribe, which ) when I knew it, had not
been greatly subjected to what un-
fortunately bas proved to be' the
degenerating influence of the white
race.
This was the Gringal tribe, a sub-
branch of numerous native people
that once inhabited the lower por-
tions of the Hunter and Karuah
River valleys.
So far as I am aware there is no
one extant to-day in a position to
describe the habits and customs of
the aborigines who lived their simple
lives on the shores of that mag-
nificent harbor. and my regret is
that, when I was among them, I did
not carefully record every single
thing connected with their manners,
however small and seemingly insig-
nificant it may have appeared at the
time. For even now, scientists and
humanitarians are awakening to the
value of precise descriptions of a
race that has become well-nigh ex
tlnct. Historians many years ago
realised the tragedy of permitting
facts concerning the blacks to be-
come lost and burled with the
passing pioneers, and are now com-
bining in a praiseworthy effort to
preserve whatever is possible from
the memories of the older generation
still alive.
I was born at Carrington, Port
Stephens, on September 19. 1844,
my father, John Scott, being employ-
ed in a secretarial capacity at Car-
rington by the Australian Agricul-
tural Company, a wealthy English
corporation, which had secured a
million acres of land in that part of
the country. Of matters relating to
the district and the activities carried
on thereabout I will have somewhat
to say at a later stage, but my pre-
liminary dissertations will deal al-
most exclusively with the blacks who
were there in large numbers in my
boyhood days.
It will be as well for me to state
at the outset that I am not depend-
ing entirely on memory for the facts
1 intend to present. Before I left
Port Stephens for Queensland, in
1873 I went to a good deal of
trouble to make a written record of
many Incidents and descriptions of
customs and ceremonies, besides pre-
paring a considerable vocabulary of
words and phrases common in the
tribe. These, I fortunately kept by
me through the years, and with
their aid I have been able to refresh
my recollection on some points. The
list of aboriginal words used by the
tribe is probably the only one in the
world, for none other, to my
knowledge, ever troubled to commit
a glossary to paper.
At the date of my birth. Carring-
ton was a considerable establishment,
although declining in importance, as
the Company by that time was trans-
ferring the main centre of Its activ-
ities elsewhere. But the blacks re-
mained, and many of my earliest
recollections are of them. The lads
of the tribe were my playfellows. I
learned to speak their language with
a certain degree of fluency as did my
sister to a greater extent —and we
mastered those difficult labials and
gutturals thftt few white men have
been able to catch correctly, as la
evidenced by the discordant eonmp


tion of many beautifully euphonious
native names.
From my sable playfellows X learn-
ed to appreciate the innate character
of the black, his simplicity, his
honesty, his hardihood, his resource-
fulness, his courage. And I was
taught much of his skill in bushoraft.
They were primitive people indeed,
those earliest inhabitants of the dis-
trict. Religion they had none, but
withal, there were certain rigid codes
of honesty and morals that were
seldom violated. It could hardly be
said that they had any conception of
a God, yet they feared, and feared
profoundly, some terrible invisible
being they named Cooen supposedly
capable of exercising a maleficent in.
fluence over their lives.
This mighty unknown was not in
any way associated with such natural
phenomena as thunder or lightning,
nor did he seem to have any particu-
lar dwelling place. But he was about
somewhere—intangible and dread-
conveying. The blacks would not, or
could not say anything definite of
him that one could advance as an ex-
planation of his whereabouts or his
potency, but clearly he had some in-
fluence On or associated with the
spirits of the departed.
I remember, on one occasion, a
young black-boy, who used to be
about our place a good deal, being
deeply grieved over the death of a
comrade to whom he had been great-
ly attached. After the burial cere-
mony, Billy, as the lad was named,
made it a practice to visit his
friend’s grave on frequent occasions
and deposit thereon small offerings
of food and tobacco, plainly as a
propitiary offering to the spirit of the
deceased. As time went on and
Billy’s grief abated, the time between
the visits lengthened, until eventual-
ly they ceased altogether. One night
however, Billy when passing the
grave of his forgotten friend, felt a
sudden pang of terrifying remorse.
What caused it cannot be explained,
perhaps, save to suggest that soma
sub-conscious cell in his brain be-
came suddenly active. But Billy,
with the speed of an arrow, made
for our house. Into the kitchen he
hurled himself quaking with the
most apparent terror. We asked him
what was wrong. “That feller bin
run-im me.” he answered.
We knew he referred to the spirit
of his departed friend, whose name
he would not mention, for the name
of a dead person was never spoken
after he has passed to the Great Un-
known. Billy did not recover from
his fright for many a 'day.
The belief in a spirit existence is
again exemplified in connection with
the burial customs of the Port
Stephens tribe. One of a small camp
of blacks about a quarter of a mile
from our house died of some sick-
ness. To dig his grave a spade was
borrowed from us, and the excava-
tion was made on the foreshores, a
few yards above high-water mark.
The time of burial was fixed for
flood-tide (killoongmundi) for they
believed that if the interment took
place at ebb-tide (wittung), the
spirit of the departed would be car-
ried out to sea (wombal) and lost in
the great waters.
The corpse was neatly encased in
a sheet of bark (paper-bark) strip-
ped from the giant tl-tree (Meleluca)
and bound with vines from the scrub.
About this again was an outer casing
of a freshly stripped sheet of
stringy-bark, also bound with vines.
When these preparations had been
made, the next thing was to find out
who was responsible for the man’s
death, it being believed that all
sickness wa s brought about by the
machinations of an enemy. "That
feller been puttem stone,” or else


“that feller been pattern bone,” they
would say
- The plan adopted to discover the
death dealer was as follows: —The
coffin was lifted upon the shoulders
of two men. A third, holding a green
branch, stood at the side calling out
the names of everyone of whom he
could apparently think, at the same
time lightly striking the coffin with
the wand. It was the belief that
when the name of the guilty person
was called the corpse would start.
My father’s name was called
first, followed by quite a number of
others, when suddenly, cn a certain
name being mentioned, the bearers
of the body lurched forward as
though the corpse had moved. Thus
was the culprit found. How he, or
she, wa s dealt with I was never
able to discover.
Without more ado the corpse was
lowered into the grave, which was
filled and carefully levelled. The
man’s widow then made her camp fire
by the grave-side, and every evening
as the sun was sinking, she began
her loud mournful wailing for the
dead. This continued until the grass
began to shoot on the grave, and
then one night the tribe suddenly
disappeared and we saw nothing of
them for several months. Never at
any time could we get them to men-
tion the name of anyone who had
died.
The mourning for the dead some-
times was extended to favorite
animals. We had a little black and
tan terrier, a splendid snake killer,
that like most dogs that pit their
cunning and skill against serpents,
was at last bitten beyond hope of
recovery. One of the gins “Old
Mammy,” discovering the body of
the faithful little animal in the yard,
sat down beside it and began a
mourning howl that she malnalned
for an interminable time. At last, to
our relief, she desisted. Coming up
to the house she demanded payment.
We naturally demanded to know
what the payment was for. “Oh,” she
exclaimed. “For crying for your
dog.” We explained that she had
not been asked to perform this sad
rite for the dead. “That doesn’t
matter,” she said. “I did it.” To get
rid of her we complied with her de-
mand for some “plour, chugar and
tea.”
If religion played no part in their
daily life, and If in some things only
they were oppressed by a dread of
the unknown spirit, it may he said
that many of their aetions were re-
gulated very definitely by super-
stition. This, no doubt, In common
with all primitive peoples, is an In-
heritance from primordial man, so
that it Is not surprising to discover its
influence among the Australian abor-
igines.
Some of these superstitions were
extraordinary. For instance, a party
of ua were preparing to go fishing in
Fame Cove under the guidance of
Billy Steward, a man who had once
been steward on a boat. I happened
to have a few emu feathers stuck in
the band of my hat as an ornament.
On perceiving these Billy flatly re-
fused to accompany us. “Bail catch
fish,” he said. “Take ’em feathers
out.” When the offending plume was
removed /Blilly was immediately
placated and was ready to start.
Another fishing superstition was In
connection with eating fruit. No
black would dream of going fishing
after having partaken of a feed of
fruit ) nor would he accompany any-
one who had been similarly guilty.
One of the most remarkable be-
liefs I remember, also concerns the
same piscatorial sport, and it in-
volved a peculiar rite worthy of de-
scription.
An aboriginal woman, Fanny, who
was a servant of our family for many
years, was in her girlhood days dedi-
cated to the art of fishing. When


quite young, a ligature was tied
about the first joint of her little
finger very tightly, and being left
there for a considerable time, the
top portion mortified and, in time,
fell off. This was carefully secured,
taken out into the bay, and, with
great solemnity, committed to the
deep. The belief wa a that the fish
would eat this part of the girl’s
finger and would ever, thereafter,
be attracted to the rest of the hand
from which it had come. Thus Fanny
would always have success at fish-
ing because of the peculiar lure in
her fingers. She wag Indeed a won-
derfully lucky fisher.
One woman of each small tribe
was usually dedicated this way, and
to her was entrusted the task ct
fashioning the fishing lines, the vir-
tues accruing from her innate
powers over fish being of course
communicated to the lines she made,
I am afraid that I cannot give any
very lengthy description of the
clothes that adorned the robust
frames of my early friends for the
very sufficient reason that they sel-
dom wore any. For the most part full
dress consisted of a possum-fur belt,
with narrow strips of skin pendant
therefrom both in front and at the
back. This was all their bodily pro.
tection against the elements, and
their fullest concession to the con-
ventions imposed by the white people
about. A complete outfit could al-
most be held in the hollow of the
hand, but we saw nothing unusual
In it.
Some of the women were more
adequately clad In any cast-off clothes
they could secure, or enfolded in an
old rug or blanket. Strangely enough
neither men nor women adorned
themselves with ornaments of any
description, being content to present
themselves to the world as Nature
so fashioned them.
The rugs they used were made of
animals’ skins, principally those of
opossums. They were very neatly
made and provided both warmth and
protection from rain when occasion
arose. Blankets they obtained from
the Government from time to time,
but they preferred their own home-
made coverlets usually.
The men invariably carried their
tomahawks In their belts, and a piece
of grass-tree gum, which latter seem-
ed to be an indispensible part of
their equipment Thi s exudation of
the pummirri had so many uses tha t
no blackfellow could be without diis
supply ready at hand.
The tribe had no special leader oi*
chief during my memory of them,
the older men acting as general
advisers, but by what authority I
never knew. It may have had some-
thing to do with the “mystery bags’’
that formed part of the equipment
of the adults.
My father had been admitted as
an honorary blood-brother of the
tribe and was regarded by them with
a sort of veneration. It was their
custom to seek his advice and
assistance in almost every emergency
that arose.
The mystery bags carried by the
men evidently held some significant
superstitious meaning, the pro-
foundity of Which I was never able
to fathom, despite careful inquiry
on the subject. Always my requests
to he Informed what they contained
or what they meant were met with
blank refusals. Indeed the men
would never discuss them at all.
These bags were attached to the
waist-belt when the men were in
ceremonial undress, some of them
being attractively made. My curiosity
as to their contents was gratified oU
one occasion In an unexpected man-
ner while 1 was still quite young.
We children were out for a walk
with our faithful servant Fanny,


when I, noticing a big mangrove tree
on the edge of the bay ( climbed to
its top-most branches. In a hollow
fork I discovered one of these
mystery bags and displayed my prize
excitedly to the group o n the ground.
Fanny, on seeing it, became greatly
agitated and ordered me to restore
it to its hiding place at once. Before
doing go, however, I peered into it
and saw only a piece of lock crystal.
Fanny implored us to maintain
silence about the find, her perturb-
ation being so intense and impressing
Us so strongly, that we never men-
tioned the matter afterwards.
Another superstition was in re-
gard to the treatment of a sufferer
from internal pains. Sometimes,
When a man was wracked with an
internal spasm, he would have his
Wife “pere-ally’’ for him, an opera-
tion carried out in the following
manner. The patient was seated or
placed in a reclining position on the
ground. A canoe-shaped vtessel of
bark a couple of feet long, was half
filled with water and placed near
him. A cord, made of ’possum hair,
was passed around his body a couple
of times, the ends being held by the
Woman who knelt on the ground,
leaning over the little canoe of
Water. She then passed the crossed
ends of the cords rapidly to and fro
between her closed lips until the
blood, drawn by the friction dropped
freely into the water, discoloring it
to a crimson fluid. It was confidently
believed that the pain would leave
the man’s body by way of the cord
ahd passing down with the blood
from the woman’s mouth, dissipate
Itself in the water.
I Was too young when observing
these practices to inquire deeply
Into their full significance, tout I
presume that suggestion played a
great part in the cure, even as it
doc s with the most approved medical
treatment in these modern days.
What subsequently became of the
Hood-tinted water I never learned.
Although I could never ascertain
definitely that a system of totemlsm,
on the complicated and intricate
basis common with some of the in-
land and Northern Territory tribes,
existed among our blacks at Port
Stephens nevertheless, I am con-
vinced that something of the kind
obtained. In some other tribes
there are series of sub-branches
identified distinctively with their
animal or bird totem, these groups
being subject to rigid rules as re-
gards inter-marriage, food taboos,
and other things. The animal or
bird representing the respective
totem is of course sacred to the par.
ticular person to whom it belongs,
and though he may not kill Or eat it,
those in other groups are free to do
so.
At Port Stephens, where the tribe
numbered in the vicinity of a hun-
dred persons, men, women and chil-
dren, two totems did duty for the
community. The men had as theirs
the tiny bat that flies about at dusk,
and this little winged sprite was re-
garded with deep veneration. He
was “gimbi,” the friend of the
males. With equal reverence the
gins looked upon the small wood-
pecker hailing his appearance with
delight a s presaging good fortune
while he lingered in the vicinity,
busy with his sharp strong bill seek-
ing grubs under the bark of the
trees.
The men took a mischievous
pleasure in killing the wood-pecker
which represented the totem of the
women. They would often knock
the feathered forager from a tree
trunk with a “purrahmlrre” (the
throwing-etick), or a stone, laughing
uproariously at the feat. But they
seldom did this In the presence of
the women. If a wanton slayer of


the gins’ sacred bird were detected
in his crime, the women would give
way to outbursts of furious passion
and direct savage attacks at the
offender, beating him with their
sticks until he was glad to fly m
precipitate confusion, offering no
retaliation or resistance.
I am inclined to believe that these
sacred totems had, In earlier times,
some bearing on intricate tribal
rites unknown to us and which pro-
bably had fallen into disuetude
owing to the Influence of the white
people. Whether such was the case
will never now be known.
No definite conception of an
existence after death appeared to
exist among the members 0 f the
tribe. In some vague fashion they
sensed a spirit existence, but in the
’fifties and ’sixties it was generally
accepted that a dead native would
“go down blackfellow, jump up
white-fellow.” This, obviously, could
have been no part of the creed of
the forefathers of the tribe who
must have had very fixed notions of
their own on this subject, as I have
been able to conclude from many in.
cidents that were seemingly unim-
portant. I have mentioned Billy’s
terror when he fancied he had been
pursued by the spirit of his deceas-
ed friend, which in Itself predicated
an instinctive belief in a super-
natural existence. Then there was
the fear of darkness, general among
all members of the tribe. There was
also a fear of certain localities for
no given reason; there was the dis-
inclination to do certain things at
certain times; there was the strange
refusal to speak of, or mention the
name of one that had passed away.
Probably the tribe when I knew It
was in the transitionary stag© be-
tween outright savagery and semi-
civilisation, Tor it must be remem-
bered that Carrington became a set.
tlement in 1824, and from that time
onward the natives had been in con-
stant contact with white people and
their ways. Three decade s is a long
period in the life of a black, and the
racial and conventional domination
of the whites have been most mark-
ed at all times in their influence on
uncivilised tribes.
The fear of darkness Is not com-
mon to savage peoples by any
moans. but at Port Stephens no
black would move from the camp
after dark, even on the shortest
journey, without providing himself
with a very large fire-stick that he
would whirl assiduously and keep
blazing all the time to ward off the
demons of the night.
Fame Cove was taboo after the
sun had fallen, and n© native would
linger in that vicinity when the
shadows lbega n to lengthen. X once
inquired the reason of this fear of
the place and was quaintly informed
that “too many shark” were there.
There was, I knew, another and
more pregnant reason that no one
would disclose.
I recall on one occasion the result
of a practical joke played by my
father ©n the tribe at their camp
Always ready for fun. and know-
ing the timidity of the natives, he
hollowed out a large pumpkin one
night, making holes in it to repre-
sent eyes, nose and mouth. Taking
this down to the vicinity of the
camp, he lit a candle and put it in-
side th e huge vegetable. Then strol-
ling to the camp-fires, he began to
converse with the men. Suddenly
stopping in th e middle of a sen-
tence. he stared fixedly at the spot
where the pumpkin glowed in the
darkness. The blacks turned to>,
and beheld what was certainly an
eerie spectacle, and something which,
to them, represented a very terrify-
ing object. In an instant there was


pandemonium. Men howled, women
shrieked children screamed in the
greatest excesses of fright. Hither
and thither the blacks rushed,
stumbling and scrambling about the
fires* all in a terrible turmoil. Peace
was not restored until my father re-
moved the illuminated pumpkin.
Another fear was always par.
amount in their minds, —one that
could be readily traced back to its
genesis,—and that "was dread of at-
tack by other tribes. The blacks
Were always fearful of a raid by the
Myall River natives, who were reput-
ed to be very warlike and aggressive.
They also feared other blacks who
came from farther north, and of
Whom they spoke in a vague way.
This fea r wa s undoubtedly bred in
their bones, and was probably there
tor very good reasons, as in the
earlier periods of history raids by
bloodthirsty marauders from other
districts may not have been uncom-
mon. It is likely that In some past
generation the Port Stephens tribe
had suffered bitterly by the spears
and waddles of other sable enemies.
In the matter of sickness and the
endurance of pain the blacks were
singularly fatalistic. as are most
savage tribes. Civilisation has sharp-
ened the sensibilities of white peo-
ple in the realisation of suffering,
but the aboriginal remained much as
his pristine relatives had been,
wholly resigned to whatever ills befel
him in the nature of accident or
malady.
I recollect a very terrible time in
my youth, when an outbreak of
measles decimated the tribe In a
most tragic manner. The conges-
tion, the Insanitary conditions that
obtained, and an entire lack of ap-
preciation of the necessity for isola-
tion caused the disease to spread
with disturbing rapidity. It wrought
great havoc, the mortality being ex-
ceedingly heavy.
The stricken sufferers Would make
no attempt to help themselves, ex-
hibiting a pitifully complete resigna-
tion as soon as the fira t symptoms
became manifest, being seemingly
content to sit and await the coming
of death. My mother proved an
angel of mercy to the unfortu-
nate people. Day after day she
would visit the camp, with a maid
bearing a bucket of gruel, and she
would feed the sustaining compound
to the listless patients. I verily be-
lieve that, but for her daily visit
atlons, the tribe would have been
practically wiped out. The blacks,
not understanding anything of the
treatment required, would at the
first signs of fever, rush to the water
and plunge into the bay. These sud-
den immersions were no doubt re-
sponsible for the majority of the
deaths.
Fortunately sickness troubled them
but little. Nature appeared to have
safeguarded them In her own In-
scrutable fashion against most of
the ailments that afflict civilised
man but she had not prepared them
against the diseases that the white
man brought in his train.
In th e endurance of pain the
blackfellow Invariably exhibited the
most surprising fortitude. Knocks
and bumps, cuts and scratches, sus-
tained in th® ordinary course of
daily life, troubled them not one
whit. Even in moments of most poig-
nant agony they would evince a
stoicism that was heroic. I can fur-
nish one Instance that will lllusi-
trate this trait In the aboriginal
character in striking fashion. An
elderly native, named “Fisherman,”
fell from a tree On the southern side
of the harbor, sustaining a com-
pound comminuted fracture of the
shin bone. His companions brought
him across the bay in a bark canoe,


carrying him to our house, as was
their custom when any trouble as-
sailed them.
My father, perceiving that the
fracture wa s a bad one dispatched a
messenger to Stroud, twenty-four
miles distant, to summon Dr, Harris
a capable medico who practiced in
the district at that time. In due
course th 0 doctor arrived at Car-
rington, and, after examining the
injury, laid out “Fisherman” on a
table in the garden. My youthful
curiosity properly aroused, I loitered
in the vicinity to watch every detail
of what followed, and what I saw
shook my n erves considerably,
young though I was.
The bone was protruding through
the flesh, and the dead portion of
which the doctor began to remove
with a saw. Such things as anaesthe-
tics wore unknown nor was any-
thing used to deaden the pain. Al-
though “Fisherman” must have suf-
fered excruciating agony, not a moan
or whimper ©scaped his tight shut
lips.
After the leg had been placed in
splints, my father, who was a clever
amateur carpenter, fashioned a
wooden frame, open at one side in
which the shattered limb was fixed
to keep everything in position. Prior
to taking his departure, Dr. Harris
strictly enjoined “Fisherman” to
rest the leg in the frame until he
paid him another visit later.
The very next morning, on my
father’s going to the camp to inquire
after the patient, he was astonished
to see “Fisherman” calmly squatted
before a Are with the frame off his
leg and actually leaning across the
point of the fracture. On being up
braided for his disobedience to medi-
cal orders, the old black grinned.
“Baal coolah, marser,” (don’t be
angry), he said. “Mary look out, an’
’spose see it docklter come, me put-
tem bookls long em leg d’recly.”
Marvellous to relate, within a few
weeks the old chap was quit© able
to go out fishing again. But the leg
was bent, as was to be expected, a
circumstance that, however, gave
him little concern. Afterwarfc we
used to tease him by telling him
that he had a leg like a “hurracaa"
(boomerang).
CHARACTER OF THE BRACKS.
As t 0 the behaviour and character of
ou r dusky friendg at Pont Stephens
I can only speak in the most glowing
terms. From earliest childhood I
was closely associated with them
under all manner of conditions and
In all sorts of circumstances. X
found them to be wonderfully cour-
teous, with a code of etiquette that
many white people, supposedly mor e
enlightened, might well copy to ad-
vantage. They had a fine sens© of
delicacy in the matter of behaviour
to whiteg and strangers of their
own color, and their tact and for-
bearance on occasions were truly re-
markable. They were honest in so far
as the greater things of life were
concerned, with a nalvetie of the
untutored savage who, while he
may envy most of your possessions,
will seldom purloin anything more
than food. They were kind to one
another, and to those with whom they
came in contact,' their generosity be-
ing proverbial. They were happy,
simple in their ways of living, and
more prone to laughter than to tears.
During my long experience with
them I always found that they treat-
ed those with whom they associated
with the greatest deference and con-
sideration. The members 0 f our fam-
ily could command any service from
any one of the tribe and It would
be cheerfully rendered, even at the
cost of great personal Inconvenience.
Their attitude towards visiting
blacks was also worthy of note. I
remember on one occasion convers


iag with, a group Of natives at their
camp when there was a sudden hiss-
ing whisper: “Cooree Cooree!”
(Blaokf allow! blacklellow!) Glanc-
ing about I saw a strange aboriginal
waging across a cleared space and
approaching the camp. He came
straight up to the group, and within
a dozen or so paces of us, threw on
the ground his spears and boomer-
angs. Then he came forward to the
fire no one speaking to him, nor
apparently looking at him. The
stranger produced a small pipe from
his belt, stooped down to the fire,
lit the tobacco with a coal, and took
a few puffs. A s the smoke swirled
and eddied about his curly head, the
silence was broken as though this
had bee n the signal for speech. The
new-comer announced hlg name and
business and within a few seconds
the whole crowd were jabbering ex-
citedly and happily. Thus their
visitor was put at hia ease, and in a
most tactful manner.
Among themselves there were
seldom any disputes or quarrels.
They seemed ‘always to regard life
as a huge joke to be enjoyed to the
utmost. With their children they
were patient, affectionate and mar-
vellously forbearing. Never once In
all my life at Carrington did I ever
see a picaninny slapped or chastised,
and the younger fry could be mis-
chievous and very trying on occas-
ions.
Children were not weaned until
six or seven years °f a S e > and it was
quite a common thing to see a boy
or girl of that age suddenly leave oft
playing about the camp to obtain
a little refreshment from Nature’s
fount, the mother’s breast.
They were fond, too, of pets, for
the place was alway s alive with par-
rots, bears, opossums, squirrels,
kangaroo rats and bandicoots that
had been caught in the bush and
tamed to the domesticity of camp
life. With these birds and animals,
usually well trained, they would
amus e themselves for hours, indulg-
ing in fits of mirth at the antics and
feats of their pets.
A people that could treat their
children and their pets in this fash-
ion could have little guile or evil in
their hearts. And so I always found
it.
But as Is so often th e case with the
human race all the world over,
jealousy sometimes caused serious
disputes in the camp, the inevit-
able woman being at the root of the
trouble. On one occasion the flirt-
atious inclinations Of a dusky belle
and an ardent swain were re-
sponsible for a duel, conducted ac-
cording t 0 the strict code of aborig-
inal chivalry _
The two men in the case were Big
Jimmie and Little Jimmie. The first-
named possessed a wife who was
coveted by his diminutive namesake,
and the ensuing complications pro-
voked a challenge from the incensed
husband. Little Jimmie had to ac-
cept or b e branded forever as a
coward, and so arrangements were
made for the affair of honor to be
decided.
The two principals took their
stand at positions some twenty
yards apart, Big Jimmie being equip-
ped with only a short stick, some
eighteen Inches long and of the
thickness of a broom-handle. His
opponent, at the other end of the
lists, was armed with a boomerang
and a fighting spear, and the usual
womerah to throw it.
Hostilities were opened by Little
Jimmie delivering a vehement haran-
gue about the Whole business, Inter-
rupting himself at a quite unexpected
moment t 0 throw the boomerang at
his enemy’s throat. The curved mis-
sile flew with terrific speed straight
at the mark, hut Btig Jimmie ducking
his head In time, H passed harmless


ly by.
Tbe covetous lover then commenc.
ed another loud and violent disserta-
tion on his wrongs, concluding by fit-
ting th e spear l n tlhe womerah and
hurling it at his antagonist’s breast.
Swift as a flash flew the deadly
lance, but Big Jimmie/never shift-
ing from his place, deftly turned it
aside with the short stick he held.
That was the end of the duel, for
honor apparently being satisfied, the
men went off to the camp on the
friendliest terms.
Although there was some kind of
communal ownership of everything
about the camp, there was a distinct
proprietary interest by individuals
in certain things, particularly
weapons. Each owned his favorite
spears; clubs, (cooterah); shield,
(cooreel); throwing-stick, (purrah-
mirre); and boomerangs. These were
sacred to the owner. Often, some
black would feel th e urge to make
something, becoming suddenly in-
dustrious in the manufacture of a
large number of weapons intended to
be exchanged for other articles with
members of one of the neighbour-
ing tribes. For weeks and weeks he
yvould labor, fashioning with the
crude tools at his command, such
things as he believed would bring
him the best return in his bartering.
When he had finished the required
number, he would cache them l n the
bush > either in a hollow log or cave,
until such time as opportunity arriv-
ed for their disposal. And, no matter
where he deposited his store, nor
how many knew of its existence, the
weapons were never touched again
until the owner removed them.
I never knew the 'blacks to steal
anything from our premises except
water-melons, of which they were
extremely fond. On one occasion rny
father, having caught several of the
youths in the act of purloining some
of these delectables, remonstrated
with them, and upbraided them
sternly for stealing. They were as-
tonished and indignant. “Bail" steal
’em, master’’ they protested vigor-
ously, “We only take it.” This naive
explanation wag their manner oifcdis-
criminatlng between something taken
with malicious intent, and something
taken merely to gratify a fancy.
There never was anything of per-
manency about a blackfellow’s home.
He did not plant his roots deep in
the soil as does a white man and his
house was not constructed to with-
stand the ravaging hand of time nor
L o defy the fury of the elements. A
few sheets of bark, leaning on a pole
pgalnst a tree, served him as shelter
fhrough days of sunshine or nights
of storm and rain. There was no
pretence at architecture or even or-
derly erection of the crude break-
wind. But tho summers (kurrawarn)
were temperate and the winters
(tuokerah) genial for th e most part,
so that constitutions inured through
centuries of experience to vagaries
Of the seasons took no hurt from
the changes bf temperature when
they did come.
Sanitation was unknown to the
tribe, with most unpleasant conse-
quences when a camp had been es-
tablished at one spot for some
length of time. Any danger that
might have arisen, through residence
in malodorous and unhygenic en-
vironment was avoided in a very
slmpl e and practical fashion. When
the camp became go noisome that
even the accustomed nose s of the
inhabitants revolted, the tribe would
gather up its lares and pehates and
move in a body to another site, dis-
tant beyond smell of the old homes.
N°r would they return to the original
spot for months.
Fires were always kept burning
about the camp. I n most seasons the
blacks slept between two small fires,
getting the warmth on both sides of


their bodies so that they could
slumber in a reasonable degree of
comfort. T 0 maintain the blaze the
simple expedient was adopted of
pushing a long pole into the flames,
and* shoving it forward from time to
time as the top wag consumed.
It needed but little to divert tbe
simple minds of the natives. As I
have said before, life wa s a joke,
and the more laughter they could
crowd into it th e merrier passed the
days. Good temper pervaded tbeir
whole conduct, and it was hard to
put any of them out of countenance.
Naturally there was someone or
other among them who had a strik-
ing physical peculiarity, either an
over-emphasised feature, a deform-
ity, a trick of gait or speech com-
pion t o himself. With their inimit-
able mimicry the deficiencies and
idlosyncracies of the others would
be copied and mocked by strutting
youths and old men, and even some-
times the women, their antics pro-
voking the immoderate mirth of the
whole tribe, including tbe very object
' of their humor. He more than any-
one, seemed to enjoy the joke best.
It has often been said that the
blacks had neither music nor melody
in the corroboree songs they so
often sang. Such is far from being
the case, for they had as keen an ea r
for melody as many of those that
to-day profess to be far advanced
in the beaux arts. That they under-
stood harmonisation I am able to
vouch for, and there were popular
melodies, som e quite catchy, in their
repertoire.
It is true that they had no musical
instruments nor did they make use
of any pipe or reed from which
melody could be extracted. This,
nevertheless, does not indicate that
they were devoid of a musical sense
or that they lacked an appreciation
of melody. What accompaniment was
played to their songs wa s contribut-
ed by means of the gentle clashing
together of boomerangs or spears,
the rhythmic beating making a not
unpleasant obligato to the lusty
chomse s they sang. Certainly they
liked noise, but then many of our
modern singers are as noisy as
musical.
Even at this far distant date X
can recall with vivid pleasure the
camp fire concerts of my early
friends. And they did roar out their
lusty choruses until the very echoes
trembled on far-away Yacaaba Head.
If fher© was really more enthusiasm
than melody in all their perform-
ances it was due t 0 excitability of
temperament, as thei r songs con-
sisted mostly of a few lines, repeat-
ed over and over again, with a
loudly shouted “wy-yahng” as a re-
frain. Each singer seemed to h®
trying t 0 outdo his neighbor in voci-
feration. and the only cessation was
when all burst into screams of
laughter.
There is one chorus that I well
remember, for it was sung nightly,
over and over again, by the whole
tribe. The words were: —
Pindi pindeingy pindreingl cou.
a-yana poon-maree wyv-
gneahu
Yangaronga gnaralonga cou-a-
yana poon-maree wy-
gneahn.
What it meant I could never dis-
cover; perhaps the singers did not
know themselves. But In it there
must have been some rare morsel of
humor that they relished immensely,
for at the end of the song they would
burst into shrieks of raucous merri-
ment.
It was no uncommon thing for
some wandering visitor from an-
other tribe to come along at certain
intervals to teach our blacks an-
other song, probably one of his own
composition. This nomadic minstrel
was a most important individual, re-
THE PORT STEPHENS BLACKS


garded as being specially gifted by
what stood for the aboriginal Muses.
Posturing, gesticulating and leap-
ing about the fitful flames of the
camp fire he would sing, over and
over again, his latest melody, which
usually had to do with some well
known incident. His audience would
listen intently until they had master-
ed the words, the tune and all the
business that went with it. Then they
would' begin on thel r own account.
And for many moons afte r th e musi-
cal bard had departed to his own
camping ground, his son g would be
roared and shouted with delight
along the picturesque shores of our
beautiful harbor, disturbing the
peace of nature but bringing great
joy to the happy singers.
The Port Stephens tribe had its
own bard, a maker of many songs
that probably did the rounds of many
a camp over the wide range of the
Gringai country. I remember particu.
larly one of hi s masterpieces, which,
in its way. was an achievement not
ftt all lacking in true artistic merit
The chant was a musical description
of all the animals a nd birds that had
been imported to the district and a
mimicry of their noises and move-
ments. It pourtrayed the horse, cow,
cat, dog, sheep, and even the fowls
of the barn-yard were brought into it.
As a piece of mimicry it was singu-
larly clever, and excited the great-
est mirth. Its popularity did not
wane for many years, and provided
the tribe with more pleasure than
the modern world gets nowadays
from the best of th e music hall hits.
And the bard wag not above in-
corporating in his choruses some sly
references to the characteristics of
some of the white folk of the dis-
trict, those of us that knew the
language being easily able to identify
the object of bis gentle ridicule.
I must give the singers the credit
for no, t having e ve r imported malice
or bitterness into their songs,
whether they related to white or
black people. Thel r minstrelsy was
to amuse, and they extracted from it
the maximum of pleasure.
The sports of the children were
the daily labors of thei r parents in
miniature. They played at warlike
games with spear and boomerang,
fashioned for their own youthful
and harmless purpose, acquiring in
their irresponsible sportiveness that
proficiency that was so needful to
them when the realities of lif e had
to be faced. They could swim al-
most as soon as they could walk.
They could throw their little spears
with deadly accuracy; they could
use a shield with the skill of their
fathers. They learned to track the
native animals, became wise in the
ways of fish and bird, and made a
game 0 f life generally. They were a
happy lot, the children, tumbling
about with little regard to cleanli*
ness as w e knew it, and as healthy
as could be.
They liked noise. One toy with
which they delighted to play was a
contrivance that gave out a deep
booming din lik e the “bull-roarers ’
th e elders used in the initiation
ceremonies. It was made of a flat
piece of wood, a few inches in
length, in which two holes were
bored. Through these holes tw o cord a
were threaded. By working the cords
the wood was made to revolve rapid-
ly, giving out the noise that gladden-
ed their young hearts.
Nevertheless they had strange
manners and ways. Incomprehensible
to the ordinary run of white folk.
There was old Mammy, for instance,
and her son Joey, of whom sh e was
passionately fond. This lad, a lively,
spirited boy was my particular play-
mate and trusty henchman. H e liked
horses better perhaps than anything
else, and nothing delighted him mor*
than te accompany me on my riding


excursions perched behind my saddle.
Mammy was terrified of horses, and
whenever Joey was about to set out
on a riding trip, would create >a
great fuss and endeavour to prevent
his departure, wailing loudly that
some day a horse would kill him.
On one occasion as we were
mounted, about to ride forth to fht>
hills, Mammy began her ueual out-
cries, b u t more lamentable than ever.
Joey was terribly incensed. “Wait
a bit, Marser Willie,” he said. “I’
soon stop that feller. ” And slipping
from the saddle he began to rain
kicks and blows on th e body of his
fond parent, soon bringing her to a
reasonable frame of mind. The old
woman did not flinch under the at-
tack, nor did she resent if o r appear
to see anything untoward In such a
happening.
I may mention that in the course
of a few years Joey grew to be a big
lad and a first-class horseman. He
found employment at Mr. Russell’s
station, on the Upper Myall, and
one day, when driving a cranky old
horse before him, the animal lashed
out and kicked him on the shin.
Lockjaw supervened, and Joey, as
his mother had predicted, died
through the instrumentality of a
horse.
FAMILY LIFE.
There did not appear to be any
particular set of tribal laws regard-
ing marriage during my years of
association with the Port Stephens
blacks. Probably marriages were ar-
ranged by the old men of the tribe,
as was the case In earlier times, and
as was general among the' Gringais, to
which general tribe our branch be-
longed. When the youthful swain
decided to take unto himself a wife,
he usually laid strong hands on the
object of his choice and dragged her
to his camp. If she showed any dis-
inclination to accompany him, as was
sometimes the case, hig effective per-
suasion took the form of some heavy
blows over the head with his coo-
teerah (club). Thi s always decided
the maiden.
Men sometimes took wives from
pther tribes, usually going in peace
about thei r matrimonial mission, and
meeting neither repulse nor inter-
ference from the relatives of the
yoman. No doubt if she proved coy,
she wag clubbed into submission in
the time-honoured fashion.
Once a couple became man and
wife they were singularly faithful to
each other, and appeared to have no
cares nor troubles in the world.
The man would hunt for meat and
honey, the woman gather yams and
d 0 what fell to her shar e of main-
taining life in the camp. Disputes
never arose about food, and all had
full and plenty.
An old woman of the camp, Mam-
my, was credited with being the
medium by which unwanted babies
were removed. Whether there was
any truth in rumor over this matter
We never bad any proof. My father,
however, told me of one singular in-
stance of infanticide that came under
his notice in earlie r years. Twin girls
were bor n to a S' n - and as th 0 task
of rearing two babie s was apparent-
ly to o great fo r the mother, it was
decided that one should die. Some
difficulty arose about deciding which
of the unfortunate babies was to be
the sacrifice, but this was surmount-
ed l n a novel fashion. Their brother,
a lad of seven or eight years of age,
was summoned from hi s play to de-
cide. He looked at th e two black
morsels of humanity as they lay on
the grass. One gave a querulous
whine as be gazed. That settled the
matter. He pointed to th e disturber,
and toddled back to bis game. And
the baby disappeared.
At Port Stephens the tribe was


happily situated in the matte r of
provender. The waters of the bay
teemed with fish of every descrip-
tion, easily taken at all times. The
foreshores were covered with oysters,
which formed a staple part of the
diet. The hush abounded with game
jn the form of kangaroos, wallabies i
'possums, emus, flying-foxes, wild
duck, swans, parrots, pigeons. There
(were edible roots In the gullies, wild-
fruits in the brushes. It required but
Jittle effort to keep the communal
larder filled to repletion.
The business of fishing was per-
haps the most important of all to
the natives. In the piscatorial art
they were highly proficient, using
both lines and spears. Fishing lines
were cleverly made from the inner
bark of young kurrajong trees, the
finished article being of extraordin-
ary strength and capable of landing
the heaviest of edible fish. I verily
believe that they would have held
a shark.
As previously stated, it was the
function of selected women special-
ly dedicated to the fishlng ; to pre.
pare the lines. The bark would be
stripped carefully from the tree and
soaked in wate r until the outer por-
tions could be readily scraped off
with a shell. This left a white, flax-
like fibre, very tough and strong.
The women twisted this fibre to the
required thickness and length by
rolling it on the front part of the
thigh with the hands. Where the
lin© was rolled the skin of the op-
erative was hardened by the appli-
cation of hot ashes, and in time be-
came calloused, smooth, and as hard
as dried leather. These fibre strings
were also used to make dllly-bags
in which piccaninies were carried as
well as articles of food, and puppies.
The fishing lin© was called “ylrra-
warn,” and the hook “plrrewuy.”
Soane of the hooks were fashioned
of bone after the primitive style, but
they usually preferred the hooks
that my fathe r was able to supply.
The other method of securing fish
was by spearing them. While the
women used the lines, the men
mostly fished with the spear, and
they were extraordinarily skilful.
The fish spear (tutti) > was .made In
three distinct parts. The main shaft
was the dried stem of the gigantic
lily (pooloongearn), and into this
was fitted a secondary portion, a
part of the dried flower stem of the
gras s tree (pummirri). The head
was of four prongs made of iron-bark
and hardened by fire. The weight
and strength of the whole spear was
regulated according to th© purpose
for which It was specifically intend-
ed, thus the heaviest of them were
utilised only for spearing the big
sea mullet which swarm into the
harbor in countless millions at cer-
tain seasons of th© year.
The fashioning of these prongs
was an important piece of work.
The section of the tree intended to
be used for the purpose was first
shaped in the rough and then put
In the sea water for a lengthy per-
iod until the sap had gone and the
tissue toughened. This also made
it easier for the maker to scrape th©
billet down to the required thick-
ness with the crude tools at his
command. A piece of glass bottle
was greatly prized for this work, its
superiority ov© r a broken shell
having soon been appreciated by the
blacks.
When the prongs wer© properly
fashioned and barbed, the head
would be fitted to the shaft with
fibre cord and gum from the grass
tree. The fitting was done so
cleverly that the whole would be as
solid as though in one piece. Other
spears, of smaller size, were made
for other fish and called “mooting.”
It was Interesting to watch the


onslaught on the sea mullet when
they came into the harbor. By some
uneering instinct the blacks knew to
within a day when the first of the
great shoals would appear through
the heads. The women would ha on
the look out for the shining, shim-
mering mass of fish to come round
some wooded headland, and when
their shrill outcries told of the ap-
proach of the finny prey, the men
would rush to the shore.
The fish always travelled from
west to east, and close inshore, on
the northern side of the harbor,
usually making their appearance off
Carrington about the time of “wo-
kercoopa,” or high-water. At the
given signal the men would dash
into the water until up to their mid.
dies and stand motionless, spear
poised on woomerah, ready to launch
the fatal dart. Tho leader, scan-
ning the water with eager eyes,
would watch until the shoal came
within striking distance. “Muh!”
(Now!) he would cry. Hissing into
the water would hurtle the heavy
spears, and next instant excited
natives would be tossing great,
gleaming fish to the beach.
What huge quantities of fish these
blacks could eat! They never seemed
to tir e of the diet, and the schools
of mullet yielded them more than
enough for their wants during the
period they would be in the harbor.
They were not over-particular about
the thoroughness with which the
delicacy was cooked. So long as it
wa s well warmed in the fire they
would eat it with avidity.
They had a clever and simple
method of cleaning any fish they
caught, and one that 1 have not seen
practiced elsewhere. They would
take a fish, thrust a finger through
the soft flesh just beneath a side
fin, and through that small orifice
withdraw all the entrails. The fish
after being cleaned appeared as
though, it had just come out of the
water. That this method was a good
one I can bear strong testimony, for
the natural juices were preserved
within the fish, and the flesh tasted
better than when treated any other
way. Removing the scales was, of
course, never thought of. The fire
got rid of those.
Oysters were to be had for the
gathering, and the blacks appreciat-
ed the succulent shell-fish mightily.
But very seldom did they eat them
raw. They would knock them, off
the rocks ( or carry the rocks away,
and roast the oysters over a fire.
Very often as a lad I would sit on the
foreshore opening the bivalves for
sny own refreshment, to be warned
on every occasion by some sable
friend that “bad eat too many raw.
You cook ’em.” I have often wonder-
ed since then just why they found
the oysters better roasted than au
natural.
The tribe did not by any means
confine their fishing to the vicinity
of Carrington, the whole waters of
the harbor being their grounds. At
fixed seasons they would set off to
tbe heads to catch lobsters, and this
indeed was a mighty task, when it
is considered that they had no eqiuip-
mens for the sport. The lobsters were
caught by the gins who, on the sea
front, dived down among the rocks
for them. Their men folk played a
somewhat important, if commendably
cautious, part in the business by
throwing stones into the water as the
gins dived, the purpose being to
scare away the sharks. It was a risky
game for the women j but I never
heard of one being tackled by the
ravenous monsters which were cer-
tainly plentiful on that part of the
coast.
The canoe was an essential part
of the fishing operations, and these
crude but effective craft were great


ly in evidence. I will later describe
the method of their manufacture, but
at this juncture I would mention
that the crazy vessels enabled many
a meal to be obtained by the fisher-
women when the great schools of fish
were not in evidence.
It was no uncommon sight to see
a dozen or so out on the waters of
the bay, a little fire, built on a heap
of clay in the centre, glowing and
smoking, and sable fishers plying
their calling for sheer necessity’s
sake.
There was a marvellous variety
of fish in the harbo r in those days,
and if might be interesting to record
the native names of the different
species. Fish, as a general term,
wa s “muckeroo.” Then came the
individual sorts as follows: Porpoise,
cooprar; shark, toorarcle; turtle,
coorahcumarn; snapper, kurrang-
cum; jew-fish, turrahwurrah; mullet,
peewah; bream, coopere; stingray,
billorn; torpedo-fish, kirrepoontoo;
eel, toonang; fiathead, tarrahwarng;
oysters, nonnung; cray-flsh, wirrah;
crab, beerah; shrimp, punnoong.
FLFSH FOODS.
When it became necessary to
change the fish diet, the blacks had
a wide expanse of bush whereover to
forage, a territory at that time
teeming with game of all descrip-
tions. Marsupials were in abund-
ance among the rldge s and on the
flat lands; there were birds In the
trees and on the swamps. It was real-
ly a land of plenty. Even the casual
white man, uninitiated Into the ways
of the chase, could have gleaned a
living with little difliculty in that
land of milk and honey.
The kangaroo, practically extinct
about Port Stephens now > was in the
middle decade of last century, the
favorite food of the blacks. The
marsupials ran in large mobs, easily
driven by the nimble natives to a
point where waiting groups could
spear them with ease. It was a very
simple process for the tribe to kill
all they needed. The men of the
tribe, armed with spears, boomerangs
and throwing-sticks, would seek out
a certain spot where it was known
the kangaroos could be found at a
particular period. A few would be de-
tailed as beaters, driving the mob
towards the armed hunters hidden
in the bushes. When the kangaroos
came hopping along, a cloud of
spears and purrahmirre would be
launched, wreaking deadly destruc-
tion in the ranks of the unsuspecting
prey.
It was no pleasant sight to witness
the banquet that invariably followed
a kangaroo hunt. The men, exultant
over the result of their prowess and
urged by that extraordinary instinct
that seems to impel an aboriginal to
feed when and where he can would
immediately proceed to make a fire.
Whatever number of animals were
required for the feast would be
selected and opened. Before tasting
the flesh there, were other parts that
furnished rare delicacies to the
primitive huntsmen. The paunch
would be ripped open and it s con-
tents of undigested grass devoured
with the greatest relish. If it chanced
the long white worms commonly
found in bush animals, these repul-
sive parasites would be swallowed
that the marsupial was infested with
with rare gusto as the greatest deli-
cacy of all.
After these singular appetisers,
the chief would throw the carcase on
the fire and leave the game to cook.
The appetising odors of the roasting
flesh would be too much for the
patience of the bright-eyed band
about the flre j and it was seldom they
waited until the viand was properly
done. Half raw, or burnt up to cind


ers they gobbled the dish down with
the greatest delight, and it was re-
markable how much each man could
stow away.
The kangaroos that were to be
taken back to the camp were usually
thrust into the fire and half roasted.
This stiffened the carcase fairly ef-
fectively, thus making it more con-
venient to carry over the shoulders,
a factor appreciated by the man
that hod to bear the burden for per-
haps many a weary mile. They al-
ways declared that it was far easier
to carry the rigid body than one that
was limp and flopping.
The opossum, with his pronounced
eucalyptus flavor, was also esteemed
a great delicacy, and these dainty
little arboreal citizens received scant
consideration when the tribe was on
a foraging expedition. The blacks
had an uneering instinct for “spot-
ting” a tree that harbored a
’possum. By scratches on the bark
and other signs not comprehensible
to a white person, they would select
the forest giant in which the little
animal had made his home. One
would he deputed to climb for the
quarry, and with his tomahawk
would set about making toe-holds In
the bark up the straight bole. It
was marvellous how swiftly the
blacks could climb by means of these
tiny notches > literally swarming up
the smooth tall trunk. The ’possum
was hauled from his hole in a rotted
limb or spout and tossed to the
ground. Sometimes a blow on the
head er e he fell would kill him, o r if
he were thrown down alive, those
beneath would perform the final
ceremony of dispatch. 1 have been
informed that in some tribes the
blacks use a vine to aid in climbing,
putting it round the tree and
working It upwards to form a con-
tinual support. The men at Port
Stephens did not employ this method
the toe-hold affording them all the
assistance necessary.
iSnakes were greatly esteemed
by our epicurean friends, their flesh,
when roasted, being beautifully
white and apparently very tasty. As
they were fairly plentiful in the bush
they were often on the menu.
In the matter of tree climbing, I
once saw a black named Charlie Dee
mount a huge turpentine tree, more
than 100-feet t 0 the first limb, by
simply using toe holds cut with his
ready tomahawk. As a feat of agility
it was more than ordinarily remark-
able.
Another favorite food was the
cobra found in decaying logs on the
banks of the tidal watercourses.
These were particular favorites, and
it was no uncommon sight to see a
group of excited blacks hacking at
a log and dragging out the long,
squirming worms ( which they would
swallow raw and wriggling. They
would eat them in th e manner of a
Mediterranean peasant with his
spaghetti; the head would be thrown
back, the mouth opened to receive
the end of the dainty, and then there
would be sucking sounds denoting a
fine gusto.
Birds were easily secured and
were an abundant part of the daily
meal. Little trouble was taken over
their preparation, it seeming to be
a point of practice to scorch feathers
and flesh into a delectable outer
covering, and no matter how re-
pugnant it may have appeared to
white folk, the blacks relished their
food when It had a sharp and acrid
flavor of burnt ashes.
One of the most fancied foods was
the flying-fox (kundewung), and
great was the excitement that pre-
vailed when these evil-smelling, re-
pulsive creatures were about. In
those days the flying-foxes were


plentiful around Port Stephens there
being a densely populated harborage
on Cabbage Tree Island, and on Low
Island, near the head of navigation
of the Karuah River. The blacks
would capture thel r prey by tugging
down vines and limbs to which the
huge bats clung, knocking them on
the head when they tumbled to the
ground.
The flying-foxes would be thrown
on a Are to cook, and strangely
enough when roasted properly in
aboriginal fashion, proved quite
tasty. The flesh was a delicate white
color, and I confess that I tasted it
ori one occasion only and found it
good.
Since those times the flying-fox
has changed his habits considerably
much to the loss of orchardists and
those that cultivate fruit. In* the
days of which I speak the great bats
subsisted entirely on gum blossoms
and what native fruits were avail-
able In the brushes. Cabbage Tree
Island was literally covered with
them then, and I recall dropping
fourteen in one discharge of my lit-
tle double-barrelled gun. The foxes
soon learned to raid fruit trees in
gardens ( and seemed to abandon
their original diet of gum-blossoms
when cultivated fruits became avail-
able.
The only occasion when I ever saw
food cooked in what might be des-
cribed as a blackfellow’s oven was
on the occasion of a whaling vessel to
the port. Oapt. Rogers was skipper
of the ship and his crew composed
largely of Kanakas, recruited from
some Island in the South Pacific
seas. These mien were not Australian
blacks and they used heated stones
for their cooking. I remember them
steaming a lot of cabbages my father
had given them from the garden.
They excavated a hole in which a
fire was lighted. Stones were heated,
and when everything was in readi-
ness the cabbages were placed in the
cavity and covered with the hot
stones. When they were done they
had a beautiful appearance, and I
recollect my father remarking that
he had never before tasted cabbage
so well cooked.
While the men procured meat
from the chase, it was the particular
function of the gins to provide what
represented the vegetables of the
dally dietetic regimen. Principal of
these was wombie, a species of yam,
the root of a slender vine that flour-
ished In the scrubby gullies, which
the gins dug up with their wombie
sticks ? pieces of round hardwood,
three feet long, pointed and toughen-
ed by fire. The tubers varied in
thickness from an inch to an Inch-
and-a-half, and were a few inches
in length. When baked in the ashes
these yams were very palatable;
and we, as children partook of them
on every occasion that offered.
The young, tender stalks of the
gigantic lily (ipooloongearn), was
another form of vegetable delicacy,
only procurable, however, at certain
seasons of the year. These stalks
were soaked in water for some time,
probably to remov©. any toxic pro-
perties that might be present and
then roasted in the coals.
Another bush dainty, easily pro-
curable in the right season, was the
curramali, a fruit that grew on a
little vine in the bush. These tasty
morsels were shaped like tiny pud-
dings, and when rip© would be eaten
raw. When green, if the camp need-
ed vegetables for the menu, they
were roasted and eaten In that
fashion.
The children, even from the ten-
derest years, appeared to have appe-
tites as voracious as their elders. It
was amazing th© quantity of food


the toddlers could consume, and It
was astonishing that It did them no
harm. The manner in which they
ate fish was always a marvel to me.
Whereas my parents were always
careful to remove bones from any
fish served to us at our table, the
aboriginal mothers tossed their imps
great slices of fish and let them
manage as best they could. The lit-
tle ones would cram into thei r cap-
acious mouths as much as could he
managed, bones and all, and I never
knew of one of them suffering in-
convenience or trouble. Probably
they had better digestion than us
white children, or perchance Nature
protected them otherwise in her
own inscrutable fashion.
The introduction of the English
honey bee proved an inestimable bjoon
to the blacks. Swamms escaping from
imported hives multiplied in the bush
with amazing rapidity until in all
the forest about Port Stephens there
were bees’ nests in abundance. Prior
to the advent of the whites the
natives took the honey of the native
bees, which, however, were not very
plentiful.
So numerous were the bees’ nests
about our harbor that when I left
Port Stephens for Queensland in
1873 that, I, myself, knew of over
a hundred locations, some of the
trees having two swarms In their
shelter.
The blacks seldom troubled to
cut down a tree for the honey it con-
tained, —the usual prodigal method
of the white man. Plying a toma-
hawk the seeker would chop his toe-
holds and climb straight up the
trunk of the tree in which the nest
was situated. Finding the sit© of the
busy colony, he would cut open a
hole large enough to enable him to
reach the comb. Then hauling out
great handfulls, he would drop it,
the women waiting expectantly un-
derneath catching it deftly In their
bark, canoe-shaped bowls.
The honey seekers never appear-
ed to trouble about the number of
the stings inflicted by the angry
swarm, and that they were stung
often and severely was a common-
place of the task. Probably their
epidermis was less susceptible to the
poison of the stings than ours, for
the tiny barbs caused them no ill
concern.
Strangely enough for a people
whose daily diet so lacked the sweet
things that white people seem to de-
mand, the aboriginals ate very
sparingly of the honey they robbed
from the nests. Th e young brood
combs were regarded as a great deli-
cacy, and these were eaten with
avidity. Bat the honey itself did not
greatly appeal to their taste.
Despite the fact that they did not
eat any great deal of the tasty com-
estible, they gathered huge quantities
in the season t 0 trade with the white
families of the district who were al-
ways eager to purchase it. The
paternal Government had given them
a stout boat in the early sixties, and
this they utilised to travel all over
the harbor to reach spots where bees
were plentiful. They would supply a
quarter cask of strained honey, with
the clarified wax from which it had
been extracted, tor the small sum
of £l.
In those early days the blacks
knew little of matches, and certainly
never used them for the purpose of
lighting their fires. They had a
simple and quick method of their
own, that used by their forefathers
through centuries of time, one in-
deed common to savage peoples all
over the world, —the creating of a
spark by th e friction of two pieces
of wood rubbed together.
The fire-making sticks they used
were usually parts of the dried stem


of the grass-tree (pummirri). The
principal piece would be about two
feet In length and about half-an-inch
In diameter, from the front of which
would be removed a narrow strip of
the outer shell exposing the hard-
ened Pith. The other piece would be
thinner, and rounded In a b lunt
point.
The fire-maker would squat him-
self on the ground, the soles of his
feet on the larger length of wood to
hold it firm, the thinner section be-
tween the palms of his hands, its
tapered point on the exposed pith of
the under piece. Rubbing the palms
together he would cause the upright
stick he held to revolve rapidly, the
point gradually -boring Its way
through the pith beneath. When
nearly through, smoke would begin
to rise, whereupon the efforts of the
operator would be re-doubled. Whirl-
ing the stick with amazing speed its
hardened point would emerge from
the pith, spilling a fiery dust that
dropped on a little heap of soft, fine
berk placed to catch it. The sparks
would be gently blown upon until
a flame appeared, when thereafter
it wag no trouble to build up a roar-
ing fire.
The operation took but very few
minutes when carried out by expert
natives, but although I tried on
many occasions to light a fire by
this method I never quite succeeded,
much to the, amusement of my
aboriginal, companions. When we
had to use the old flint and steel at
home, with indifferent success, I
often envied the blacks their facility
In making a fire with such crude and
apparently Ineffective means as they
had at command.
Naturally they avoided as much as
possible the necessity of going
through this process. Once a fire wa s
made it was kept burning as long
aa could be contrived, and even in
their bark canoes they maintained a
small blaze on a mound of clay so
that cooking operations could be be-
gun ashore whenever necessary. In
travelling from place to place a fire-
stick was always carried, the brand
being whirled and twisted so that
it would not go out.
As I have mentioned before the
natives never moved off camp at
night without carrying a fire-stick
to ward off attacks of evil spirits,
Ctoo-in the übiquitous “debbil-deb-
bll” whom, they seemed to imagine
was always on the alert to seize
them.
Fire-sticks had another virtue,
which, after all, was In the nature
of a superstition. In times of wet
weather when long continued rain
(Kueywon) made everyone and
everything miserable and gloomy,
the old men of the tribe would per-
form a remarkable ceremony to en-
sure a recurrence of fine weather.
Snatching fire-sticks from the camp
fire, they would hurl the blazing
brands in the air, presumably ajf
the clouds (yarreel), at the same
time puffing loudly with the mouth
(kurracar). No doubt th e Idea was
that the fire would dry up the teem-
ing heavens, and the artificial gusts
from their mouths blow the storms
away. I cannot say that thel r ef-
forts were always attended with
success.
Fire they called “wuttar”; the
flame of the fire was “kille”; smoke,
“poot-too”; heat “wlrrin-wirrln”;
cold, “kur-kur.”
Intoxicating drinks such as white
folk so often indulge in were un-
known to the blacks in their earlier
days. Contact with the white race
however, created in many a taste for
ardent waters, although at Port
Stephens they were seldom able to
obtain anything sufficiently potent to
provoke any evil alcoholic manifest.


ation. But they managed to achieve
a condition of exaltation in another
[manner.
Obtaining a freshly emptied sugar-
bag from my father, they would soak
it in water to make what they called
“bull” which, after all, was merely
sweetened water. A vessel would be
filled with the concoction and about
this the men of the tribe would squat,
A sponge j made of the pounded inner
bark of’ a stringy-bark (punnah)
tree would be utilised to dip out
each man’s share of the mixture.
The sponge would be soaked; then
the reveller would tilt back his
bead, open wide his mouth, and
squeeze hard until a stream of
liquid gushed down his throat. Then
th e next man in the circle would re-
peat the performance. After a few
rounds of the sponge the men would
reach a condition of extreme hilarity,
very closely resembling the cheerful
stages of liquor Intoxication.
CEREMONIES.
Throughout the entire length and
breadth of Australia aborginal
tribes have held mysterious ceremon-
ies In connection with the initiation
of youth into the state or condition
of manhood. Speaking generally the
same fundamental principles are ob-
served in the performance of these
ptrange rites, the significance and
inner meaning of which even the par-
ticipants have long ago forgotten.
How and when the ceremonies orig-
inated have not yet been discovered
by scientists, nor is it safe for the
ordinary observer to hazard a guess
as to when these things begun.
That they were founded on • a
strong basis of superstition is evi-
dent. The symbolic dances and rites
undoubtedly were designed to con-
vey some hidden truth and teach
some vital lesson to the initiate. That
they were designed to preserve dlsci-
pline( health and tribal integrity can-
not be disputed. But to proffer de-
finite reasons for each and every
thing done at the bora ceremonies is
beyond my ability. For in those days,
with the carelessness of youth, X did
not trouble to make any effort to
probe beneath the surface of things.
X am convinced that few white men
have ever seen the whole of the bora
ceremonies of any tribe of blacks,
despite frequent assertions by travel-
lers to the contrary. Many of the
corroborees were performed in the
presence of white spectators, but
the more secret and Intimate rites
were celebrated far beyond the gaze
of the idly curious or the inquisitive-
ly prying.
At Port Stephens it was the
custom, when some of the boys had
reached that stage of adolescence
that their admission to the full pri-
vileges and prerogatives of the adult
men of the tribe was deemed advis-
able by the older wiseacres, to segre.
gate them for preparation for the
ceremonies.
What this Initiatory preparation
was I never learned, for the boys
maintained a strict silence on the
subject. But there were ceremonies
in the bush, wherefrom the women
were rigidly excluded. The men
would decorate themselves with pipe-
clay and ochre, painting fantastic
patterns about their faces and bodies,
and they would wear head-dresses of
weird and wonderful designs. While
the ceremonies were in progress,
there would be an Incessant noise of
the bull-roarers ( flat notched sticks
whirled at the end of a cord to drive
off “debbll-debbils,” keep the women
at a distance, and Impart the correct
amount of terror to the trembling
lads who were soon to become men.
Of the ceremonies that they did
permit white people to see, I was
the fortunate spectator on one oc-
casion, when I was about eleven


years of age. At Port Stephens they
called it the “poombit” though gen-
erally it is spoken of as the “bora.”
Walking with my father a nd sister
to a scrubby flat, about two miles
distant from our home at Carring-
ton, We reached the poombit ground.
the men made it a hard
and fast rule to exclude the females
from most of their ceremonies > on
this occasion an exception was made
In favor of my sister, as a very spec-
ial favor. She was about seventeen
years of age at the time, and being
able to speak their language with
great fluency was a particular favor,
ite with one and all of the tribe,
put they laid down one condition, a
concession to their own conventions,
p,nd that was that she should wear
a thick black veil. This was swathed
about her face, but it had a con-
venient peep-hole through which
she was abl e to view the proceed-
ings. Whether the blacks were
aware of this I cannot say, but if
the y were they purposely overlooked
the infraction of their rules.
Probably no other white woman
has ever seen what my sister beheld
on that occasion. On the flat there
was an oval cleared space with a
banked-up margin, and in the centre
of it a heaped-up conical shaped fire.
The gins, who played a part in this
ceremony were made to lie down
around the edge of the oval, al-
though whether within or outside
the defined ring I am not able to
say with certainty. As soon as they
had prostrated themselves they were
covered up with blankets and ’pos-
sum skin rugs by an old black who
kept guard over them, with a heavy
waddy in his hand, ready to knock
any of the women on the head if
they evinced signs 0 f restlessness or
undue curiosity In the proceedings.
There was a good deal of make-
believe in the business that follow-
ed, probably carried on for the bene-
fit of the women. A troop of painted
savages would bound into the magic
circle, and prancing about and clash,
ing thelir spears, would announce in
hoarse tones that they could not
find the poomblts, (the 'boys who
were being initiated). This ap-
peared to cause great confusion
among the women, who probably be-
lieved that their off-spring had been
captured by the evil spirit.
After a great deal of fuss the men
announced that they would make an-
other attempt to find th e; poomblts,
and to the accompaniment of clash-
ing spears and hoarse shoutings,
dashed out into the screen of bushes
again. There followed a quiet space
for a little time when suddenly the
men returned ( with loud triumphal
cries, having in their midst the boys
they had supposedly sought. Holding
the lads firmly, the men then began
a mad, wild dance, about the fire,
working themselves up to a pitch of
terrific excitement until they sud-
denly sprang on the 'blazing coals and
began to stamp them out. Amid dust,
sparks and smoke this wild revel
went on until the fire was com-
pletely obliterated. At this stage the
coverings were removed from the
women, all of whom were covered
in perspiration, as much the sweat
of fear probably as of the heat of
the day. But one and all appeared
greatly relieved to see the boys safe
and sound in th e midst of the men.
The boys then went through a
strange and most symbolic ceremony.
Each lad approached his mother, or
in default, his nearest female rela-
tive, and kneeling before her simu-
lated the act of suckling nourishment
from her breasts; this it being ex-
plained to u s later, signifying the
putting aside for ever of all childish
things. That, so far as I can recol


lect, concluded that particular cere-
mony.
On another occasion, at a much
later date, X came across another in-
itiation ceremony when proceeding
through the bush. I had been riding
over the hills after kangaroos, and
at a spot about a mlile from where
the ceremony previously described
took place > I saw that a number of
blacks were camped at the foot of a
hill, the camp being in the form of
a half circle, round an oval cleared
space some 30 or 40 square feet in
area. The edges of the space were
raised about nine inches. This clear-
ed space was connected with the top
of a hill and another cleared space
by a narrow path. The women were
not allowed to go up this path nor
approach the top of the hill at all.
When going to th e creek for water
they were careful to look in some
other direction. When riding past the
camp I heard the most extraordinary
noises proceeding from the top of
the hill, —a bellowttng, or booming
sound, continuing for a long time,
then diminishing in volume to a
low humming monotone, from which
it would gradually swell again into
a terrifying crescendo of dissonance.
As some of the blacks to whom I
addressed questions as to the cause
of the noise refused to furnish me
with an y satisfactory explanation, I
made up my mind to Investigate for
myself. Turning my horse > I rode
quietly around the hill and up its
side opposite from the camp. From
m y point of observation I beheld a
conical fire burning in the midst of
a cleared space, very similar to the
one I have described as being at the
foot of the hill. About this fire, and
in lines radiating from the centre
like spokes of a wheel, were a num-
ber of naked blacks, their heads
bowed to the earth. Their bodies were
painted in grotesque patterns so that
they resembled weird and wonderful
skeletons.
Within the cleared space, and on
one side of it was a crude wooden
effigy, colored vividly with some red
pigment, having a cross-piece for
arms, and a striking head-dress of
grass and bark similar to the pattern
used by the blacks when stalking
kangaroos. So absorbed were the
men in the ceremonies 'in which they
were participating that my presence
passed unnoticed for some consider-
able time, a circumstance that afford-
ed m e a splendid opportunity of
observing all that went on.
I was discovered at last. When the
sharp eyes of a devotee espied me
there was a sudden bush. The men
remained as though they had sud-
denly been turned into stone. But
presently there were angr y murmurs
and I realised that my intrusion was
deeply resented.
One of our own blacks came over
to me and explained that he did not
mind m y presence, because I was his
•‘glmbl” (friend), but that the visit-
ing blacks, who were, strangers to
me, refused to proceed with the
ceremony so long as I remained in
the neighbourhood. In deference to
the very evident wish of my friend
that I should depart, I rode away.
A few days later, this same black
approached me j and apparently as
some reward for my acquiescence to
his wishes on th e former occasion,
extended an Invitation to me to wit-
ness the great finishing ceremony.
Naturally I was eager to see this
Interesting spectacle, and rode once
more to the camp at the foot of the
hill some days later. There I saw a
large fir© burning in the centre of
a cleared oval space. The booming
noise from the top of the hill was
again to be heard, and It seemed to
become louder and louder. As it
reached a terrific climax it ceased


suddenly, to be succeeded by great
shouting and yelling from the men.
This appeared to be a signal for
the next part of the proceedings, for
soon after some two hundred leaping
blackfellows appeared over the brow
of the hill. They were painted
grotesquely, and armed with boomer-
angs, shields and spears > which they
clashed together in a barbaric
rhythm as they ran. They were form-
ed in two divisions, and kept cross-
ing and re-crosslng the path, inter-
lacing as the y met at the run, and
descending the hill rapidly, all the
time yelling at the top of their voices.
The effect was both singular and
startling, so much so in fact that
my horse took fright and could only
be controlled with difficulty.
Arriving at the foot of the hill the
men threw down their weapons on
the ground, and springing on to the
cleared space, danced on the fire with
their bare feet until it was exting-
uished. In their midst, throughout
the duration of this fantastic dance,
remained the youths who were being
made “poombit.” The women were
covered as in the other ceremony be-
fore mentioned. They were always so
covered while the fire dancing was
on.
When the last spark of the Are
had been extinguished and the last
wreath of smoke had eddied into
nothingness, the women were un-
covered and the Port Stephens
blacks, accompanied by the “poom-
bits,” ran up the near j by trees like
so many monkeys and began break-
ing small branches off the limbs.
These they shrew down to the ground
among the women who scrambled
and struggled for themi with a great
eagerness, each gin on securing a
piece placing it In he r woven dilly-
bag. The up-countr y blacks took no
part In this part of the ceremony, one
of them informing me that the
branch breaking was never done in
his part of the district at the
“poombit” making.
Thlg seemed to conclude one de-
finite part of the ceremonies, for the
women were not permitted to wit-
ness what followed. They were made
to lie prostrate on the ground, ahd
were covered with rugs and blankets,
an old man guarding them, waddy
in hand, as I had seen many years
before. Just as preparations were
being made fo r a continuation of the
rites, some of the strange blacks
raised an objection to my being pre-
sent with a gun, for I had with me
a small sixteen-bore fowling piece I
Invariably carried on my excursions
in the bush. One of our blacks asked
me to give it up j but rather than
part with It I decided to let them
finish their celebrations in peace and
so took niy departure. I have since
often regretted that I did not wait
to see the conclusion of what would
no doubt liav e been a most inter-
esting event, for It was probably the
last of the “poomblts” ever
held at Port Stephens. When I passed
the place an hour or so later the
camp was quite deserted.
When I was about to leave Port
Stephens In the early seventies the
bora ceremonies had practically died
out. The tribe did not multiply as
it must have done In earlier times.
There were few y oung boys growing
into adolescence, and the attenuated
“poombits’’ attempted on a few oc-
casions were poor affairs. The boys
initiated were very young; the pomp
and ceremony of former occasions
had disappeared. Such was the in-
fluence of civilisation.
But when I was a lad such was
not the case, and the initiation of
the novices was a memorable and
important event. Th e young boys on
whom the mantle of manhood was
to be bestowed were carefully in-
structed by the elders of the tribe
for long periods before the actual


ceremonies began. What was the
nature of this preliminary induction
I was never able to learn, as I have
before mentioned for the lads, close-
ly attached to me though the y were,
would lapse Into stolid silence when-
ever X tried to probe their myster-
ies. But their period of probation
must have been a trying one indeed.
When they would emerge from the
ordeal eventually, they would be
haggard, thin and worn. Their hair
would be closely cropped; they
would be covered with grease and
charcoal, and their whole appearance
would be as though they had indeed
undergone some tremendous mental
and physical strain. Perchance they
had in all truth.
I have been told that circumcision
was practiced among the coastal
blacks in the early days, but during
my time at Port Stephens this was
never part of the ceremonies, nor was
it ever the custom to knock out
one of the front teeth of the initiates,
although this was done in the early
twenties when the A. A. Company
first established itself on the shores
of the harbor. Mutilation of the
arms and chest was not practised at
the “poombit” ceremonies, although
men and women usually had repel-
lent cicatrices on arms and torso,
caused by gashing with shells or
knives. These disflgurments were
regarded as personal adornment
more than anything else and seemed
to have no particular significance In
any other respect.
WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT.
Considering the crude tools they
had at their disposal to perform
work requiring any degree of skill
whatever, it Is marvellous What the
blacks were able to fashion in the
wa y of weapons and equipment of
various kinds. With no knowledge of
science to aid them, with only the
most primitive ideas of handicraft
as white men comprehend it, they
could do a vast quantity of very ex-
cellent work in a very brief space
of time. Instinct and necessity no
doubt guided their deft hands, for
the art of fashioning their weapons
was inherited from countless gen-
erations who had to pit their wits
against Nature in the battle for
survival.
Like the aboriginals all over Aus-
tralia they used what tools they
found ready at hand, or which were
adaptable from the material Nature
had strewn so liberally about. And
because on the reliability of their
weapons they had to depend for their
very livelihood, necessity compelled
them to achieve a sort of crude per-
fection that even to-da y is the ad-
miration and envy of our more en-
lightened people.
The spears were really wonder-
ful weapons; long, slender and grace-
ful, and fashioned with a balance
that was amazingly perfect. I have
already described how the fishing
spears were made, and have told
something of the skill with which
they were used. There were other
types of spears, of course, for hunt-
ing purposes, and perhaps war.
These were called “cumiml,” and
varied considerably in size and con-
struction according to the purpose
for which they were designed. Some
had straight, long shafts tipped with
pointed bone, either of fish or
animal; others were pointed and
barbed. I have seen small nails used
for tipping spears, lances made in
this fashion being particularly dead-
ly.
The shafts of the spears were
made of various hardwood, scraped
carefully to the required thickness
with shells or pieces of broken bot-
tles. The ironbark (teekurah), was
mostly favored for making them. A


straight young sapling would be
chosen, cut to the required length,
and set to soak in water for some
three or four weeks. This would tak e
out the sap and render the wood
reasonably soft for application of the
tools used as scrapers. The harden-
ing was, of course, done by fire later
on.
The end piece, comprising the
barb, or pointed tip, was affixed to
the main shaft very skilfully, con-
sidering that the hole for its recep-
tion had to be bored with a piece of
hard-wood, twirled between the
hands, the best substitute for an
auger procurable. The top, fitted into
this slot, would be made firm and
■olid with cords of animal sinews or
flbre ( and coated oyer with gum from
the grass-tree.
I have mentioned that the blacks
were ver y accurate in the use of the
spear, being able to hurl this weapon
for remarkably long distances. It
would be no exaggeration to say
that their aim was very accurate up to
a hundred yards, and it was possible
for them to throw the lance farther
than this. With a woomterah to aid
the cast, the y could hit a mark at
almost every throw up to a dis-
tance of 50 to T 5 yards.
The boomerang, a weapon univer-
sal throughout Australia among
aboriginal tribes, naturally held a
prominent place In the communal
arsenal. At Port Stephens there were
two varieties in general use. the
slightly curved weapon, utilised for
striking down game of all descrip-
tions, and the sharply curved var-
iety which would return to the
thrower. These weapons were usually
mad© of wood from th© wild myrtle,
hardened, like all their other wooden
implements, by fire. The throwers
had marvellous command over them,
and could actually direct and con-
trol their flight in any direction.
It was no light task to make a
boomerang, for a good deal of skill
and more than an ordinary amount
of patience was necessary. A piece
of suitable wood invariably myrtle
had to be found, curved as
much as possible in the rough
shape to be assumed by the
finished article. This would be chip-
ped and shaved with extreme care
until the desired curve had been ob-
tained, when the finishing touches
would be put on it with scrapers
made of shells or glass. How they
worked out the mathematics of the
curve and balance was ever a puzzle
to me, as it has been to anthropol-
ogists all over the world, but
though they always seemed to be
making boomerangs, one never heard
of any being spoiled or made in
such fashion as to prove useless
when put to the crucial test.
The womerah, also common M
most aboriginal tribes, was used to
give further Impetus to the flight of
a spear. It was a well-balanced flat
or round piece of hardwood, 24-in.
to 30-In. long, having at the narrow
end another piece of hardwood,
about three inches In length affixed
at a slight angle to receive the
slightly hollowed end of the spear
shaft. This smaller section was held
in place by a binding of fibre and
grass-tree gum. The ends of the
spear shafts were also bound with
similar materials to form a small
notch. The added leverage launch-*
ed the lance with Incredible swift-
ness. Most of these womerahs were
highly polished by fat and ashes
rubbed into them.
The waddies. or "wattles” as the
blacks at Port Stephens called them,
wer e very neatly fashioned and per-
fectly balanced. They ranged in
length from three-feet to three-feet
six-inches, being shaped like a club
and having a slightly tapering end .


Som e of them were notched at inter-
vals along their whole length, or
else carved in fantastic patterns.
These weapons were said to be very
effective in a fight. Their appearance
certainly gave every indication
of the justice of this claim for them.
Th e nullah nullah was another
weapon in the same category as the
“wattle,” but of different shape. It
usually had a head of some descrip-
tlon at one end, shaped either like
a hammer or a hall. Ironbark was
used in their manufacture, and the
bulging knob was capable of putting
an enemy out of action with little
trouble. I remember one old black
discoursing on the merits of the
nullah a s against the “wattle” in a
fight. H e explained that he never felt
a hit from a nullah, and only realis-
ed he had been struck when he
noticed the blood streaming down
his countenance. The “wattie,” how-
ever, was deadly in its execution,
and there was never any doubt about
it when it fell.
Clubs (cootarah) wer e also used,
roughly fashioned from any suitable
piece of timber.
The shield (cooreel), was an im-
portant article of warlike equipment
to the warriors. It was an oval-
shaped piece of hardwood some two
feet wide having a hand-grip on the
back made of a length of vine
affixed In holes made for the
purpose. With this seemingly in-
effective guard, they could ward of
with extraordinary dexterity spears
and stones hurled at them from any
angle. Indeed it seemed almost im-
possible to hit a black with lance or
missile if he had his cooreel in his
hand. Of course they were endowed
by Nature with eyesight far keener
than white men can boast. They
could discern objects at a distance
that I could never detect, and often
would roar with laughter when I
was unable to see some animal or
bird to wlnert they would point.
Even the children were adepts with
the shield, one of their favorite
sports being to pelt .each other with
stones and ward off the flying mis-
siles with a tiny piece of hoard or
bark. I often tried to hit one of
my young black playmates when at
this game, and swift and accurate
though I was, I never remember
having succeeded.
In fashioning their canoes the
blacks showed a skill and craftsman-
ship that was surprising, consider-
ing that any form of building was
to them practically an unknown art.
Living as they did on the shores cf
a spacious harbor from the waters
of which they gleaned so much of
their daily diet, It was Imperative,
for necessity’s sake, that they
should hav e some means of convey-
ing themselves from bay to bay, or
from one side of the port to the
other. Thus, Nature, in some far off
century, taught their ancestors how
to construct a craft that would bear
them upon the face of the waters.
The method adopted to make a
canoe was crude but very clever in
its way. The hull of the little vessel
was made of a single sheet of bark
of the stringy-bark (punnah) tree,
obtained from a tall, straight clean
bole. Great care was exercised in
selecting the right tree for the pur-
pose as any fault, caused by a knot
or protuberance, would spoil the
value of the sheet when stripped.
The stripping operation was carried
out with an e xa °t judgment, lines
being cut cross-wise with a toma-
hawk around and across the tree so
that the section removed would be
of the required size and shape. Very
carefully was the length of bark
separated from its hold so that not
a crack appeared in Its tough sur-
face.
As soon as it was taken off, the


blacks would pass it back and forth
across the flames of a fire to turn up
the ends, which would be tied into
position with sections of ring and
fibre. The rough, outside bark, the
exterior of the canoe > would be care-
fully trimmed away with the blade
of a tomahawk until the surface was
smooth and clean. Th e inner part,
the inside of the craft, would of
course be the naturally smooth sappy
portion.
The gaps between the ties of the
vines at stem and stern would be
plugged with clay, so skilfully in-
troduced that the whole craft would
be absolutely watertight. To give th e
canoe rigidity so that It could bear
Its passengers safely, stretchers
were ingeniously fitted at intervals
along its length somewhat after the
manner one sees In an ordinary
clinker-built boat. Nothing in the
nature of an outrigger was ever used
or I believe ever heard of by our
blacks.
On the floor of the canoe, usually
at the stern, there would be the in-
evitable mound of clay, the floating
fireplace. on which a few embers
were always burning. I never re-
member any black starting out on a
voyage, however short, without this
fire burning.
It was amazing th e speed at which
these seemingly cumbersome craft
could be driven through the water by
their owners, thei r lightness and
shallow draught having a good deal
to do with this. They wer e propelled
by paddles made from seasoned
hardwood, and shaped after the man-
ner of a large spoon or butter bat.
Kneeling in th e middle of his canoe,
the sable mariner would dip deeply
on one side and then, swinging with
rhythmic grace and perfect poise,
half turn and dip on the other side.
I do not recall ever having seen a
double-ended paddle used at any
time.
There were a large number of
canoes in use about Carrington In
my youthful days. They were not
over comfortable to be sure, and
although generally 15 feet long, and
with a fair beam, required some
handling by an amateur. The blacks
avoided rough water and always
chose a calm day for crossing the
harbour. They objected to anyone
other than their own people enter-
ing their canoes at all, nor can I
recall them allowing me to do so.
The canoes were greatly prized by
them and were so fragile that they
would not stand rough usage.
There were, of course, capsizes,
and sometimes a fatality, but these
occurrences were rare. I recollect on
an occasion that fate overtook one
daring fisherman who had ventured
out in bad weather. I cannot recall
the man’s name j but he was singular
in that he had one eye and was al-
ways followed by a one-eyed dog.
Th e pair were inseparable, and on
this tragic day were together in a
canoe on the south side of the har-
bor.
Setting out for Carrington, in the
teeth of a howling nor’-easter, the
black attempted to make a passage
across the narrowest part, just be-
low Middle Island. A particularly
heavy sea swamped the craft, tossing
its two passengers Into the water.
Man and dog set out to swim for the
shore, —not a very difficult task for
either,- —but fate interposed in the
shape of a ravenous shark.
The darting scavenger of the seas
dashed at he unfortunate blackfel-
low and tore one of his legs clean
off. What followed thereafter was
never known, but presumably h e was
aided by his canine friend in his


struggle for safety, as he was found
later on a sandbank, —the stump of
his leg burled in the sand. What ter-
rible agonies he endured iu that fight
against the waters and the snapping
demon of th e deep can be conjectur-
ed, but he did reach the sands, drag-
ged himself ashore, only to die from
loss of blood. And when his body wa s
discovered the faithful hound stood
guarding it.
Sharks were about the only thing
the blacks feared in the water. The
fury of the elements seldom dis-
turbed them. As an Instance of their
attitude to the weather, I might men-
tion a voyage I took with a number
of sable companions from Carring-
ton to Cabbage Tree Island on one
occasion for the purpose of gather-
ing a few baskets-full of wild Cape
Gooseberries which grew there
abundantly in those days and which
were useful for jam making. We were
in our own boat on this occasion and
not in a canoe.
As we were returning, a fierce
southerly struck up, the wind howl-
ing a® it whipped the tops off the
rising waves, and bringing with it
heavy scuds of rain and flashes of
lightning. Although I did not like
the look of the weather by any
means, the blacks were quite uncon-
cerned, and only exhibited signs of
perturbation when there appeared
some danger of the fruit we had
gathered at so much pains becoming
sodden and ruined.
THE TOMAHAWK.
An implement greatly In use
among all the members of the tribe,
or at least most of the men folk, was
the tomahawk. In my days they had
progressed beyond the stage when
they used the old stone tool, the most
primitive form of this Implement
the world knows. The advent of the
white man, with his ready made iron
axes, relieved them of dependence on
their cruder article.
The tomahawk of the early days
was a good deal different from the
one in common use now. It was
longer and narrower, shaped more
like a wedge than the axe of to-
day. As soon as a black got hold of
a white man’s tomahawk, he would
remove the handle to substitute it
with one of his own fashioning.
It would be made of a long, flat
piece of hardwood, pointed at one
end, fitted loosely Into the ey e and
made firm with a wooden wedge
driven along the side. There was a
good reason fo r this, as the longer
handle gave more weight to the head
when it was wielded, and its flat
form enabled it to be thrust easily
and firmly under the owner’s possum
fur belt, thus leaving his hands
free when climbing a tree or carry-
ing a burden.
They would never accept the
broad bladed implement when they
became common, as those with the
narrow blades enabled them to cut
out a possum, bandicoot or kangaroo
rat from a tree or log with far
greater facility than the other sort.
MESSAGES AND SIGNALS.
I have mentioned that our tribe
was frequently visited by strangers
from other districts, some of them
wandering minstrels, and others who
came either l n connection with the
“poombit” ceremonies or for the
purpose of hearing and telling news.
I believe that in earlier times strange
blacks coming to Port Stephens car-
ried message sticks that guaranteed
them immunity from attack during
their travels. These passports had
gone out of use by the time I was
able to note their customs, for the
presence of so many white people In
the district had undoubtedly remov


ed all cause of fear from the abor-
iginal mind in this regard. They had
a wholesome respect for the laws of
the superior race.
But if they carried no message
sticks, they could certainly com-
municate with each other at long dis-
tances, and impart tidings, by means
of smoke signals, the inner meaning
of which I was never able to dis-
cover. They evidently had a code of
some sort. Intelligible to their own
race, for by this form of telegraphy
they could summon each other all
over th e harbor.
The signals were made in simple
fashion. A fire was lighted at a
prominent coign of vantage j probab-
ly a recognised spot for the purpose
and one looked to regularly by mem-
bers of the tribe far afield. When the
blaze was glowing merrily green
branches would be piled on the
flames which would soon disappear in
a cloud of smoke. Across the billow-
ing cloud of blackish-grey smoke
another heavy leafy branch would
bo Interposed at definite intervals,
so that there ascended a series of
eddying puffs, visible at great dis-
tances. That a regular dot-dash sys-
tem was used was clear, but I was
neve r told the secret of the code.
MISCELLANEOUS REMINISCENCES
I have mentioned that the aborig-
inals (possessed a keen sense of
humor and were marvellously clever
mimics. Their good temper and
childish relish of fun -was never more
exemplified than when someone
made a present to a stalwart black
of an old hat, coat, or other discard-
ed garment. The recipient would
don the gift, usually after a fashion
never originally Intended, and would
strut proudly about the camp dis-
playing himself and his adornment.
Afte r the owner had spent some
time in exhibiting his prize, a corn-
rade would calmly approach him
and secure possession of it to go
through the same performance.
Then_ quickly it would pass from
one to another, and each man in
turn would extract a maximum of
merriment from Its possession. After-
wards the gift, whatever it was,
never seemed to have any particular
owner, for it would be fre e for all
the tribe. The first recipient never
troubled about being deprived of pos-
session, and enjoyed more the uses
to which It was put by his friends.
Tobacco was greatly prized by
the men and women of the tribe
when I knew it. They smoked the
fragrant weed whenever they could
get it > generally in pipes they made
themselves. They were great mendi-
cants where tobacco was concerned
and would make veritable nuisances
of themselves at times to obtain a
small supply. The gins were very
persistent. With wheedling tones
they would approach my father, and
waving a cold and empty pipe, would
exclaim in tragic tones: “Pipe very
hungry, marsa.”
Very rarely did an aboriginal
stoop down to pick up any article
from the ground. Having long, pre-
hensile toes they would use them as
a white man does his fingers to
grasp the object needed and thus
would ris, e it to within reach of the
hands. When riding the men never
put their feet right through the
stirrups, as we did. but would grasp
the outer side between the great and
second toes. This gave them all the
support needed, and many of them
were first-rate horsemen.
Ther e was one old aboriginal of
the tribe, whose name I cannot now
recall, who apparently resented the
intrusion of white people and the
adoption of their customs by his
tribe. Religiously he followed the old
order of things that had obtained


on the peaceful shores of the harbor
before the advent of the invaders,
refusing steadfastly to participate in
anything that savored of an in-
fringement of the old tribal laws
and observances.
He was a tragic and at the same
time a pitiable figure, the relic of a
decaying race making a lone-handed
fight against the catastrophe his
Ignorant mind but dimly sensed and
which h e vaguely knew would ulti-
mately cause the extinction of all
his people. His singular attitude was
not understood by the rest of the
aboriginals and consequently he
lived a solitary life, but seldom
mixing with the others.
When I departed from Fort Steph.
ens in 1873 to go to Queensland the
tribe had dwindled to about fifty
members. Perhaps there were fewer
than that. I often wonder nowadays
whether there are any surviving of
that once happy, care-free compan-
ionship of the woods.
During th e year 1922 I paid a visit
to Forster and there found a full-
working at the hotel. He belonged to
the Myall Lakes tribe and knew the
aboriginal names of most of the
fishes and birds and seemed delight-
ed that I was able to pronounce them
In his half-forgotten language.
At the same time I was taken to
Visit an old gin named Old Mary,
who was nearly ninety years of age.
She had Maori blood In het veins
and had lived at Port Stephens
when I was a lad. She remembered
me perfectly and was delighted to
talk over old times.
I often wonder if any of the carved
trees still remain that were about
the old “bora” rings near (Btulga
Creek on the crown of the ridge
some half a mile from Bundabah
station. I can recall many such trees
in my time, their huge boles scored
with crude representations of snakes
and mystic curves that evidently had
a particular significance in connec-
tion with the man-making cere-
monies of the older times. Perhaps
a search by some interested histor-
ian would locate these trees if the
ax e of the timber cutter has not been
busy or bush Area have destroyed
these mute evidences of a race that
has passed away.
My father was made a member of
the Port Stephens tribe before I was
born, probably somewhere about the
beginning of the ’4o’s. His tribal
name was “Murritan,” but I never
heard the meaning of it.
Before leaving Port Stephens It
occurred to me that it would be well
to compile a list of native words and
ordinary phrases. To make it as re-
liable as possible I wrote lit as I got
the words from the lips of the two
most Intelligent aboriginals I knew,
Fanny and Billy Steward. The first-
named was laundress at our home
for over fifteen years.
It is very difficult to convey the
correct pronunciation of many of the
words by means of our alphabet, but
my acquaintance with the language
was of great assistance in enabling
me to get as near as possible to the
exact sound. Following is the vocabu-
lary I compiled in 1873:
