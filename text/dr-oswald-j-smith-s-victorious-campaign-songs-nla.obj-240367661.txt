I. RESCUE THE PERISHING.
Crosby. Doane.
Rescue the perishing, care for the
dying,
Snatch them in pity from sin and
the grave;
Weep o’er the erring one, lift up the
fallen,
Tell them of Jesus the mighty to
save.
Chorus:
Rescue the perishing, care for the
dying;
Jesus is merciful, Jesus will save.
Tho’ they are slighting Him, still He
is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to re-
ceive ;
Plead with them earnestly, plead with
them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.
Repeat Chorus.
Down in the human heart, crushed by
the tempter,
Feelings lie buried that grace can
restore;
Touched by a loving heart, wakened
by kindness,
Chords that are broken will vibrate
once more.
Repeat Chorus.
Rescue the perishing, duty demands it;
Strength for thy labour the Lord
will provide;
Back to the narrow way patiently
win them;
Tell the poor wand’rer a Saviour
has died
Repeat Chorus.
2. ALONE WITH THEE.
O.J.S. Smith.
Alone with Thee, 0 blessed, blissful
moment!
When earth recedes and Thou art
all my plea—
I hear, dear Lord, amid the mystic
stillness,
Thy gentle voice while all alone
with Thee.
Chorus:
Alone, dear Lord, ah, yes! alone with
Thee!
My aching heart at rest, my spirit
free;
My sorrow gone, my burdens all for-
gotten,
When far away I soar alone with
Thee.
Alone with Thee, mid all earth’s toil
and labour—
It matters not whate’er my destiny;
Though all around is bustle, strife and
worry,
Yet still, dear Lord, I walk alone
with Thee.
Repeat Chorus.
Alone with Thee when others have,
forsaken,
And naught is left save solitude to
me,
My weary heart turns throbbing with
emotion
To find itself at last alone with
Thee.
Repeat Chorus.
Alone with Thee beyond the vale of
sorrow.
When heaven dawns and all ..garth’s
shadows flee—
O come, dear Lord, for I am waiting,
longing,
To dwell for ever more alone with
Thee.
Repeat Chorus.

cross,
The emblem of suff’ring and shame;
And I love that old cross where the
dearest and best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.
Chorus:
So I’ll cherish the old rugged cross,
Till my trophies at last I laydown;
I will cling to the old rugged cross.
And exchange it some day for a
crown.
Oh, that old rugged cross; so despised
by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His
glory above
To bear it to dark Calvary,
Repeat Chorus.
I
In the old rugged cross, stained with
blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see;
For ’twas on that old cross Jesus suf-
fered and died
To pardon and sanctify me.
Reneat Chorus.
To the old rugged cross I will ever
be true,
It’s shame and reproach gladly bear;
Then He’ll call me some day to my
home far away,
Where His glory for ever I’ll share.

8. SINCE JESUS CAME INTO MY
HEART.
McDaniel. Gabriel.
What a wonderful change in my life
has been wrought
Since Jesus came into my heart;
I have light in my soul for which long
I had sought,
Since Jesus came into my heart.
Chorus:
Since Jesus came into my heart,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
Floods of joy o’er my soul like the
sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart.
I have ceased from my wand’ring and
going astray,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And my sins, which were many, are
all washed away,
Since Jesus came into my heart.
Repeat Chorus.
I’m possessed of a hope that is stead-
fast and sure,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And no dark clouds of doubt now my
pathway obscure,
Since Jesus came into my heart.
Repeat Chorus.

now for me,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
,And the gates of the city beyond I
can see,
Since Jesus came into my heart.

I know,
Since Jesus came into my heart;
And I’m happy, so happy, as onward
I go,
Since Jesus came into my heart.
Repeat Chorus.
9. DEEPER AND DEEPER.
O.J.S. Smith.
Into the heart of Jesus deeper and
deeper I go,
Seeking to know the reason why He
should love me so.
Why He should stoop to lift me up
from the miry clay,
Saving my soul, making me whole,
though I had wandered away.
Into the will of Jesus deeper and
deeper I go,
Praying for grace to follow, seeking
His way to know;
Bowing in full surrender low at His
blessed feet,
Bidding Him take, break me and
make, till I am moulded and meet.
Into the cross of Jesus deeper and
deeper I go,
Following through the garden, facing
the dreaded foe—
Drinking the cup of sorrow, sobbing
with broken heart;
“Oh, Saviour, help! dear Saviour
help! Grace for my weakness im-
part.”
Into the joy of Jesus deeper and
deeper I go,
Rising with soul enraptured far from
the world below;
Joy in the s place of sorrow, peace in
the midst of pain,
Jesus will give, Jesus will give, He
will uphold and sustain.
Into the love of Jesus deeper and
deeper I go,
Praising the One who brought me out
of my sin and woe;
And through eternal ages gratefully
I shall sing:
“Oh, how He loved! Oh, how he
loved! Jesus! My Lord and
my King.”

voice of cheer,
And just the time I need Him—He’s
always near.

to-day!
He walks with me and talks with me
along life’s narrow way.

part!

He lives within my heart.
In all the world around me, I see
His loving care,
And tho’ my heart grows weary I
never will despair;
I know that He is leading, thro’ all
the stormy blast,
The day of His appearing will come
at last.

None other is so loving, so good and
kind.

And yet in that calm, peaceful slum-
ber.

In days of the long, long ago.

And there I shall anchor for ever,

When to the Lord we restore our
talents,
Will He answer thee—Well done?

To the Cross where Thou hast died;
Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer,
blessed Lord,
To Thy precious bleeding side.
Consecrate me now to Thy service,
Lord,
By the pow’r of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a steadfast
hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.
Repeat Chorus.
0 the pure delight of a single hour
That before Thy throne I spend.
When I kneel in prayer, and with
Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend.

not know
Till I cross the narrow sea;
There are heights of joy that I may
not reach,
Till I rest in peace with Thee,

Cleanse my heart from ev’ry sin.
Chorus:
O my Saviour, come, I pray Thee,
As I at Thine altar bow;
Hear, O hear my heart’s confession,

Is ray message unavailing?
Give Him back at any cost!

Having lost the pow’r to win,
Since Thy Spirit, grieved, forsook me,
When I let the tempter in?

Yielding all I have to Thee,
Making now a full surrender,
Thine for ever would I be.

To tell the old, old story,
Of Jesus and His Love.
I love to tell the story;
More wonderful it seems
Than all the golden fancies
Of all our golden dreams.
I love to tell the story,
It did so much for me;
And that is just the reason
I tell it now to thee.
Repeat Chorus.
I love to tell the story;
’Tis pleasant to repeat
What seems each time I tell it,
More wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the story;
For some have never heard
The message of salvation
From God’s Own Holy Word.
Repeat Chorus.
I love to tell the story;
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory,
I sing the new, new song,
’Twill benthe old, old story,
That I have loved so long.

30. HIGHER GROUND.
Oatman. Gabriel.
I’m pressing on the upward way.
New heights I’m gaining ev’ry day;
Still praying, as I, onward bound,
“Lord, plant my feet on higher
ground.”
Chorus:
Lord, lift me up and let me stand,
By faith, on heaven’s tableland,
A higher plane than I have found,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.
My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Tho’ some may dwell where these
abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.
Repeat Chorus.
I want to live above the world,
Tho’ Satan’s darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground.
Repeat Chorus.
I want to scale the utmost height,
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I’ll pray till heav’n I’ve
found,
“Lord, lead me on to higher ground.”
Repeat Chorus.
31. JESUS SHALL REIGN.
Watts. Hatton.
Jesus shall reign where’er the sun
Does his successive journeys run;
His kingdom spread from shore to
shore, ,
Till moons shall wax and wane no
more.
From north to south the princes meet
To pay their homage at His feet;
While western empires own their Lord,
And savage tribes attend His word.
To Him shall endless pray’er be made,
And endless praises crown His head;
His name like sweet perfume shall
rise
With ev’ry morning sacrifice.
People and realms of ev’ry tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song,
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their earthly blessings on His name.
32. MY HOPE IS BUILT.
Mote. Bradbury.
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus’ blood and righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name.
Chorus:
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.
When darkness veils His lovely face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In ev’ry high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.
Repeat Chorus.
His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.
Repeat Chorus.

When He shall come with trumpet
sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.
Repeat Chorus.
33. IT IS WELL WITH MY SOUL.
Spafford. Bliss.
When peace, like a river, attendeth
my way.
When sorrows like sea billows roll,
Whatever my lot, Thou has taught
me to say,
It is well, it is well with my soul.
Chorus:
It is well with my soul,
It is well, it is well with my soul.
Though Satan should buffet, tho’
trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ has regarded my helpless
estate,
And hath shed His own blood for
my soul.
Repeat Chorus.
My sin—oh, the bliss of this glorious
thought;
My sin—not in part, but the whole,
Is nailed to the Cross and I bear it
no more,
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
O my soul!
Repeat Chorus.
And, Lord, haste the day when the
faith shall be sight,
The clouds be rolled back as a scroll,
The trump shall resound and the Lord
shall descend,
“Even so,” it is well with my soul.
Repeat Chorus.
34. MY ONLY PLEA.
Smith. Ackley.
My only plea,
He died for me!
Died because He loved me long ago;
He took away my sin,
Cleansed my heart within,
That is why I love my Saviour so.
35. HIS LOVE IS ALL MY PLEA.
Smith. Ackley.
The love that triumphed over death
Was born anew within my heart,
When face to face with Christ I stood.
And knew I could not live from
Him, from Him apart.
Chorus:
His love is mine for evermore,
He makes the darkest hour seem
light to me;
He walks beside me night and day,
The love of Christ is all my plea.
That love is mine for evermore,
’Twas born when first I saw His
face;
I willingly became His slave,
And now I own His sov’reign grace.
His sov’reign grace.
Repeat Chorus.

He drew me with the cords of love,
And bade me His disciple be;
I could not tear myself away
When once His love laid hold on me,
laid hold on me.
Repeat Chorus.
36. WHEN THE AUTUMN LEAVES
HAVE TURNED TO GOLD.
Smith. Ackley.
When the sun is setting in the West,
And my heart is yearning for its rest,
I will feel God’s presence near
And His words of comfort hear,
When the sun is setting in the West.
Chorus:
When the autumn leaves have turned
to gold,
And I’m safely sheltered in the fold,
I shall see my Saviour’s face,
And extol His wondrous grace,
When the autumn leaves have turned
to gold.
When the flow’rs have withered and
decayed,
And my soul with glory is arrayed,
God will welcome me, I know,
And my heart will overflow,
When the flow’rs have withered and
decayed.
Repeat Chorus.
When the birds have sung their final
song,
And I turn from all I’ve loved so long,
I shall find eternal rest,
In the mansions of the blest,
When the birds have sung their final
song.
Repeat Chorus.
