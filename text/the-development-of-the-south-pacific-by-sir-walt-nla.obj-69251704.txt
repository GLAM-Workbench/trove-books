DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOUTH PACIFIC.
By Sir Walter L. Buller, K.C.M.G., F.R.S.
[Contributed by special request .]
If the healthy ? Imperialism ? of to-day had existed forty
or fifty years ago, a thousand beautiful islands in the
southern hemisphere would now have belonged to the
British Crown. Like the swing of a pendulum, national
feeling goes from one extreme to the other. At that time
the desire to get rid of remote Dependencies was as strong
as is now the determination to extend the outposts of our
Empire. A great history-maker has said that about the
middle of the century ? the movement for throwing off the
Colonies was rising as an active force in England. They
had come into being almost unbidden ; they were regarded
with cold interest. The notion that it would be a good
thing to lop them off altogether was being accepted among
English statesmen. You could feel the heresy in the air?
gusts that brushed your face like a chill,?
As far back as 1841 that great pro-consul, Sir George
Grey (a pioneer Governor in every sense of the term), urged


the extension of our ?sphere of influence?? by bringing
under active British rule several important groups of islands
in the South Pacific. He had, even then, cast his eyes on
An archipelago of sunlit isles
Set in a trackless waste of shining sea,
and his prophetic vision told of future Empire. But the
Colonial department of that day was difficult to move. In
1853 (being then Governor of New Zealand), accompanied
by Bishop Selwyn, he made a tour of the islands and
actually visited New Caledonia three days after a French
man-of-war had hoisted the tricolour there in the name of
France. Sir George Grey contended that it practically
belonged to Great Britain, and using his great arts of
persuasion, he induced the French commander to delay
the proclamation till the matter could be referred to their
respective Governments. But, for seme inscrutable reason,
the Colonial Office was unsympathetic and New Caledonia
was lost to us for ever. As his biographer neatly puts it:
? Sir George Grey dipped for a grand Pacific Isles pro-
tectorate and a red noose from Downing Street strangled
it. He afterwards dipped for a Federated South Africa
and the red noose caught himself; that is, he was recalled
from his Cape Governorship on account of his projects.? In
blue-book phraseology, he was accounted a ?dangerous
man??indeed, that very term was applied to him by Sir
J. S. Pakington, at one time Secretary of State for the
Colonies. Sir George Grey records in his simple way a
probable explanation : ? This was about the time of the
agreement between ourselves and Louis Napoleon in reference
to the invasion of the Crimea, It is conceivable that the
French Emperor took advantage of the opportunity to lay
hands on New Caledonia ! Anyhow, I was instructed that
the French were to be left in possession.? History repeats
itself, and one is apt to draw a parallel between this event
and the national surrender recently to Germany of the
Islands of Samoa ?that sunny group in the great pathway


of the Pacific where it is perpetual summer?just as our
Government was plunging into the South African war!
Probably there were cogent reasons of State why the cession
should be made at that particular juncture ; but, even so,
it involved a loss to our Empire that will always be
deplored in the southern hemisphere.
At a later date (1874) a far-seeing Colonial statesman
and Premier, Sir Julius Vogel, formulated a scheme of
political federation for the Pacific, with the special object
of developing the commercial capabilities of the several
island-groups. The main feature of this scheme was the
formation in New Zealand of a huge Joint Stock Company
subsidised by the Government ; and in explaining the
project to the Colonial Office, Sir James Fergusson, the
then Governor, said that the establishment and operations
of such a company would, in the opinion of his Ministers,
tend to the strengthening of British influence in the
numerous communities of the Pacific Ocean, to the
acquisition by New Zealand of a leading position as
representing the Mother Country, and ultimately to her
being the head of a new ?Dominion.? (See letter to
Earl of Kimberley, 11th March, 1874.) - Sir Julius Vogel?s
scheme, however, which was rather in advance of the
times, did not meet with sufficient encouragement to induce
the local Government to proceed with it.
Again, in 1884-5, a strenuous effort was made by New
Zealand to extend British dominion by means of confedera-
tion and annexation. The little kingdom of Tonga had
shown a strong desire to come into federal union ; and the
Parliament of Samoa had actually passed an Act annexing
the islands of that group to New Zealand. The Stout-Vogel
Government, promptly responding to the call, decided
forthwith to accept this important charge, being quite
ready to defray the cost and to undertake the full responsi-
bility of managing the last-named group. A considerable
trade already existed between those islands and New


Zealand and, on Imperial grounds also, the annexation
appeared to the local Government to be of vital importance.
Accordingly the Government steamer Hinemoa was put
under orders to proceed to Samoa with the Colonial Secre-
tary, for the purpose of taking possession in the name of
Great Britain, and the steamer was on the point of leaving
Auckland on that mission when peremptory instructions
came from Downing Street to the Governor forbidding the
proposed annexation. Had that masterly move on the part
of the Colonial Government been allowed to take effect, the
German flag would not now be flying at Apia. But Lord
Derby objected on the ground that German interests might
be involved. Governor Jervois, in his despatch to the
Colonial Office, put the Colonial view briefly thus: ?My
Ministers consider that if Germany keeps New Guinea and
the adjacent islands, Samoa and Tonga should become
British ? ; and Sir Robert Stout, the Premier, in his digni-
fied letter of protest, said : ? We cannot here believe that the
British nation is not to annex any territory unless its so
doing receives the sanction of the great statesman who
rules the destinies of Germany.? So strongly, indeed, did
Sir Robert Stout (the present Chief Justice) feel on the sub-
ject that for years after quitting political office he continued
to write to the Secretary of State for the Colonies urging
his views.
The last phase of this question of island-annexation is
presented by the recent action of the New Zealand Govern-
ment and Parliament in regard to certain islands of the
South Pacific. The idea of keeping clear of the Australian
Commonwealth and aiming instead at a great Island-
Federation in the Pacific originated, about the year 1891,
with the late John Ballance, at that time Premier of New
Zealand and one of the most unselfish and far-seeing of
Colonial statesmen. The present Premier has now taken
the matter up with his accustomed strength of purpose,
and, with the assistance of his able colleague, the Hon.


J. G. Ward, has propounded a scheme for building up a
new Commonwealth, with the seat of the Federal Govern-
ment in New Zealand. The Cook group (consisting of
Rarotonga and six other islands), with Penrhyn and five
other islands further north, have been formally annexed
and incorporated with New Zealand by the Governor?s
proclamation, in pursuance of a resolution of the local
Parliament passed by an overwhelming majority. Mr.
Seddon (who visited the group) had obtained the consent
of Fiji to federate with the self-governing Colony on terms
mutually advantageous and equitable, and application was
accordingly made through the Governor for the sanction
of the Imperial Government. The Colonial Office, how-
ever, put in a veto, and His Excellency was informed that
? Her Majesty?s Government are not prepared at present to
consider any proposal for changing the political position of
Fiji,? Mr. Seddon is reported by the newspapers to have
said, ?We have not yet disposed of the subject by a long
way ! ? That he will persist in his endeavours goes with-
out saying; and it is not too much to hope that ere long
this new departure in Empire-consolidation will be allowed
to proceed.
There is of course much to be said in favour of the pro-
posed annexation of Fiji. These fertile tropical islands of
the South Pacific, once brought into union with a pro-
gressive Colony like New Zealand, would have a considerable
impetus given to their material development. Railways
wffiere practicable, a system of roads and bridges, and a
regular steam service, both inter-colonial and inter-insular,
would effect a rapid change everywhere. These warm
islands would be New Zealand?s geographical and com-
mercial complement; they would import largely from the
older Colony what they could not themselves produce ; and,
in return, the island produce would find a ready market.
Thus trade and commerce would be encouraged and fostered
in every direction. There is practically no limit to the


productiveness of these fair islands, but the inhabitants
need stimulus and assistance. At present the staple pro-
ducts are copra and raw sugar. The cocoanut palm and
its products (copra, sinnet, etc.), no doubt constitute the
most important local industry. The value of the Govern-
ment-grown copra (or dried nut) is somewhat variable,
averaging last year �lO 15s. a ton. The output might be
increased almost indefinitely, finding employment for tens
of thousands of the inhabitants; and these are products
for which the foreign demand will always keep pace with
the supply. The sugar-cane industry, as yet in its infancy,
would expand, under the new rigime, to proportions of
which we at present, perhaps, have no conception. During
a trip to Fiji in 1897, the writer visited the extensive
cane-plantation at Labassi, where the output is 45 tons
daily ; and at Nausori the output of the mill is 80 tons
daily. Another source of permanent and increasing
profit is the growing of bananas and other tropical
fruits, for which there is always a ready market in New
Zealand, The present importation of bananas into that
Colony from Fiji averages 20,000 bunches a fortnight, but
this would be greatly increased if steam communication
were more frequent. Pineapples, oranges, limes, citrons,
mangoes, and tropical fruits of every kind are produced
on all the islands, requiring little or no cultivation, owing
to the richness of the soil and the salubrity of the climate.
Rice, tea, coffee, tobacco, spices, vanilla, cocoa, and raw
rubber are all marketable products which would largely
follow the more systematic development of this group.
At present most of this potential wealth is lost to the
southern world, and the native inhabitants, who might be
made so happy and contented by a minimum of expenditure
in time and labour, continue to subsist from hand to mouth
and to dwindle away as a race. Even now Fiji has a
considerable export trade with New Zealand, the value of
her exports to that Colony, in 1899, amounting to


�310,113, the next largest consumer being New South
Wales.
In the petition of the Fijian Colonists praying for in-
corporation with New Zealand, the deplorable condition of
the native race is made use of as a powerful argument in
favour of that course. The petition states that the Fijian
population has shown a decrease of 25,000 in fifteen years,
adding: ? The decrease is directly attributable to the
specially oppressive system of government applied to them
and to the excessive burden of taxation to which, under
that system, they are subjected.? On the other hand, the
objection urged against the annexation of Fiji in certain
influential quarters is that the interest of 100,000 aborigi-
nees and 15,000 introduced Indians ought not to be sub-
ordinated to the requirements of the white population,
numbering altogether only 4,000 souls. The question
after all, then, resolves itself into this : Would the native
inhabitants fare better or worse under the New Zealand
Government than under Crown Colony rule ? and on this
point opinion will naturally be divided. In a recent dis-
cussion at the Royal Colonial Institute that sagacious
administrator, Sir W. MacGregor, who spent in Fiji the
first thirteen years of its existence as a Colony, expressed
his opinion that the proposed union with New Zealand was
?most undesirable?; and Dr. Finucane, whose paper on
? The Islands and the People of Fiji ? had led to the dis-
cussion, while admitting that ? the Fijians had progressed
little since annexation by the Crown either socially or
domestically,? thought that there existed ?well nigh
insuperable difficulties to annexation with New Zealand
and eventual incorporation with the Australian Common-
wealth, owing largely to the fact of the main question
being a ?native one.? ? Both of these gentlemen, speaking
with authority, appear to consider the condition of the
Fijians under the existing Crown rule satisfactory, and Sir
George O?Brien?s sway beneficent in every way; but there


are generally two sides to a story, and one is good till the
other is told. In a paper on the subject presented to the
New Zealand Parliament, the Eev. W. Slade, a missionary
of considerable standing in Fiji, asserts with emphasis that
?the Fijian Government has made itself an object of hatred
and dread to the natives ; it rules by fear. ... If the
test of successful government is found in the wealth and
happiness it places within reach of its subjects, the Fiji
Government has miserably failed.? He concludes, therefore,
? that the Fijian natives have nothing to lose but a great
deal to gain by Federation.?
This question must of course be left to the final decision
of the Colonial Office, with whom the responsibility rests.
But it may be fairly asked; What better fortune could
come to the Fijians than to be placed under the paternal
rule of New Zealand, and to enjoy a modified system of
self-government ? That evidently was the view taken at
the celebrated meeting of Colonists at Levuka (on 14th
June), when the annexation resolutions were carried by
acclamation. The chairman stated it plainly thus: ? The
New Zealand Government have shown themselves capable
of looking after native races,?
To come to the practical part of it, what would be the
real gain to New Zealand of the proposed annexation ?
Commercially, it would no doubt be of advantage to the
Colony to have reciprocal free trade with Fiji, and in the
not-distant future a considerable trade would probably
develop itself ; but, on the other hand, to admit into political
partnership, under whatever restrictive conditions, 100,000
people of a different race is a very serious matter. To add
that number of coloured people to the franchise-roll straight
away would undoubtedly dislocate the political machinery
of the Colony and might cause great embarrassment.
Political amalgamation of that kind is, for the present at
any rate, out of the question. That the greater advantage,
therefore, would be on the side of the South Sea Islanders


cannot be denied. The material benefits themselves are
not of such consequence to New Zealand as to account for
the burst of enthusiasm with which Mr. Seddon?s proposals
appear to have been received by both Houses of the Legis-
lature. The universal desire among Englishmen at this
moment to extend the power and influence of the Empire will
explain it to some extent ; but there is another and a
deeper impulse to be taken into account. The South
Pacific Islanders are so nearly related to the Maori race
inhabiting New Zealand, with whom the Colonists have
cemented close social and political ties, that there is a very
real and genuine desire to extend the benefits of civilisa-
tion to them also. As far back as 1852, when Sir George
Grey urged upon the Colonial Office to accede to the
prayer of the Sandwich Islanders (now under the American
flag) to be annexed, one of his strongest arguments was
founded on this consanguinity of race; and a year later,
when he successfully pressed for the acquisition of Norfolk
Island, he pointed out the paramount importance of a just
and liberal line of policy towards the natives of ? the South
Pacific, emphasising his conviction that ?no project would
yield greater advantages to the Empire.? So bent was he
on this scheme of racial annexation that, in the early days
of the Colony, he caused large reserves to be made in
various parts of New Zealand for the express purpose of
educating the youth of the Pacific, and these endowments
(some of them now very valuable) exist intact to the present
day.
The manner in which the Maori race has been treated
by successive New Zealand Governments, and brought in
the end into political amalgamation with the British
Colonists, should be an object lesson to the whole world.
Of course the high-spirited character of the people and the
chivalry of their chiefs had to be taken into account
to start with, for it is generally admitted that at the time
of the first colonisation of the country a finer race of


so-called savages did not exist on the face of the
earth.* Such a people?warlike by nature, proud of
their descent, and extremely jealous of their lands?
could not be expected to submit to the new order of
things without a struggle; and to this struggle a hundred
circumstances, trivial in themselves, soon led up. A trial of
strength was inevitable, and when it came it was a real
struggle for the mastery. We had an almost continuous
ten years? war, with an expenditure of many millions
sterling, before the issue was finally settled. Fifteen
thousand British bayonets at one time were employed in a
series of attempts to beat the Maoris and to reduce their
formidable pas. The Imperial troops were then withdrawn
and the Colonists took the business in hand themselves ;
and, with the loyal aid of a splendid native contingent,
under the leadership of the brave and faithful Major Kemp,
the fighting was speedily brought to a close. But the war
was not an inglorious one; and to this day the Maori
braves are spoken of with respect by every officer of the
Imperial army who served in New Zealand. When the
great contest was over, and the white man?s ? mana?
established, the Maori tribes accepted their defeat like men.
No vindictiveness remained?there was no revengeful or
sullen spirit?but like true philosophers they joined hands
with the conquerors and worked together (to use their own
expressive language) ?like elder and younger brothers? to
promote the welfare of the country. Scarcely more than
half a century ago the Maoris were a barbarous people
and addicted, more or less, to cannibalism; and what
do we see to-day ? A law-abiding, Christian people?
well educated in the ordinary sense, rich in lands and
live stock?emulating the European settlers in all Colonial
avocations; enjoying the franchise, men and women
* ?Ah, they were fine fellows, those old Maori chieftains! You
required to understand them, but they were worth every study;
nobles of a noble race! ? ?Sir George Grey.


alike, and taking an intelligent part in the management of
public affairs. They have a special representation under
which they send four members to Parliament; a member of
the race (a half-caste gentleman of exceptional ability) sits
in the executive as Native Minister, and there are two
native chiefs in the Legislative Council. Many of them
are engaged in mercantile pursuits, and are owners of
small coasting vessels; over twenty of the young' chiefs
are ordained clergymen of the Church of England; at least
one has taken his degree in the New Zealand University;
whilst another has been admitted to the bar of the Supreme
Court. A race that, long before the advent ot the
whites and for many years after, was in rapid decline?
originally from wars and infanticide, and afterwards from
causes induced by the change in their environment ?has
been for some years past stationary, and is now probably
slightly on the increase. This has been brought about by
the improvement in the general condition of the people
and their adoption of sanitary laws and regulations.
During the earlier history of the Colony the Maoris were
the more powerful race; and their strength had in con-
sequence to be reckoned with, and their prejudices consulted
in almost everything. For many years past, however, the
Colonists have been the dominant people; and how has
this affected the Maoris ? Look at their present condition.
They enjoy a full share in the representation of the country,
and they are allowed, under proper administrative control,
the management of their own lands. They have had ex-
tended to them all the benefits of a free, secular education;
they enjoy all the rights of British citizens ; and no door,
social, political, or professional, is closed to them. They
ought to be and they are, without doubt, a happy, contented,
and prosperous people.
This is a subject upon which the writer claims the right
to speak with some authority. The most active part of his
life?a period of twenty-five years ?was largely spent


among them ; first as a Commissioner and Stipendiary
Magistrate, then as a Judge of the Native Land Court, and
afterwards as a barrister enjoying an extensive Native
practice?so much so that he was once described from the
Supreme Court Bench as ?the Attorney-General for the
Maori race.? Practically he is known to the whole Maori
population of 40,000, whilst he enjoys the personal
confidence of most of the leading chiefs. Under these cir-
cumstances, he does not hesitate to characterise as a gross
libel on the Government and people of New Zealand the
language reported to have been recently used by the
Governor of Fiji in an address to the natives of those
Islands. So far from the Maori people being ? landless,?
they have retained for their own use, in the North Island,
no less than 5,000,000 acres of the cream of it. They were
found by the whites in possession of a great country abso-
lutely valueless to them except for patches of cultivation,
here and there, for digging fern-root in the open, snaring
birds and rats in the woods, and catching eels in the
swamps; to-day they are the possessors of an inheritance
of enormous value, the result of an unearned increment
brought about by European colonisation. Take the case of
the South Island. Here was a population of scarcely 2,000,
and they sold to the British Government 36,000,000
acres, that they could not occupy, for �6,000. But the
utmost care was taken by Mr. Commissioner Mantell
(acting for the Crown) to make adequate reserves for them
all over the country, and, with the progress of settlement
and the consequent evolution of towns and cities, these
reserves have grown into estates of enormous value; so that
it is no exaggeration to say that the Maoris of the South
Island have become rich beyond the dreams of avarice, and
through no effort of their own. A reserve of less than
2,000 acres at Kaiapoi, near Christchurch, was partitioned
and individualised by the writer in 1862, and, even at that
date, it represented an aggregate value not far short of


�IOO,OOO, belonging to a mere handful of the Ngaitahu
tribe. And so on, more or less, all over the country.
Then, again, the allegation of Sir George O?Brien (as
reported) that the aim of the Government has been to dis-
possess the Maori owners of the soil ?that the ? coloured
people ? are ? cooped up in the fragment of land that is
left to them whilst many have no land at all ? ?is absolutely
and entirely contrary to fact. There is nothing about
which successive Governments in New Zealand have been
more jealous than in conserving the rights of the Maoris,
so as to prevent their possible pauperism in the future.
Like most partially civilised races, the Maoris have in the
past been improvident, and but for the protective action of
Parliament there would no doubt have been at the present
day many landless individuals. As a matter of fact, how-
ever, it would be extremely difficult to find a single Maori
who does not own land somewhere or other. For many
years past it has been made impossible by law to obtain an
alienation of land from the Maoris till the authorities
(formerly represented by a Native Frauds Commissioner and
now by the Native Land Court) are satisfied that the alie-
nators have enough land left for their future requirements
?the minimum being fixed at fifty acres per head. It
would be interesting to hear the evidence on this point of
His Honour Alexander Mackay, a very able Judge of the
Native Land Court, who has passed many thousands of
titles in the Wellington district alone, and whose one care
has always been to protect the interests of the Maoris.
This fact is as notorious to the public as that he sits on the
Native Bench.
No wonder, then, that Mr. Seddon repels with warmth
and indignation this libel on the Colony of which he is
Premier. Whatever may be thought of Mr. Seddon?s
party politics, no one will deny that during his ten years?
tenure of office he has laid himself out to win the confidence
of the Maori people and that their condition has sensibly


improved under his sway. The same desire to conciliate
and win the approval of the native chiefs appears to have
characterised his negotiations with the South Sea Islanders.
We must give him credit, therefore, for sincerity when he
promised the ? Arikis ? that under annexation their customs,
their prejudices, and their local laws would be respected
and safe-guarded, whilst the privilege of self-government,
under properly constituted authority, would be extended to
them. The chiefs themselves in agreeing to annexation
laid down certain conditions vesting in the people the
ownership of the land, the establishment of native land
courts, and the exercise of certain powers with regard to
Crown lands ; and it may be taken for granted that all
promises made by Mr. Beddon in the name of the Colony
would have been faithfully observed and performed.
The incorporation with New Zealand of the Karo tonga
group, which is now an accomplished fact, is a step forward,
the importance of which, in this connection, cannot be
overrated. Here the racial identity already spoken of is
especially pronounced. As a talented writer has remarked :
? The annexation of the smaller settlements of the
wandering Sawaiori stock by a government in which the
Maoris have no small share is neither more nor less than a
reunion of blood relations who have been parted by
barriers of time and space. . . . The gravitation of
those few ? asteroids of the deep ? towards the brilliant
and powerful star of New Zealand?s sovereignty is only the
beginning of the development of a ?greater? New Zealand.?
In a private letter received by the writer from the Hon.
J. G. Ward, that gentleman says : ? The Government has
been negotiating for the inclusion of Tonga, and I am hope-
ful that something practical may be done in this direction
before very long. I know that Vavau is in the group and
that it possesses a very fine harbour. Such a place would,
as you say, be invaluable to us as a refitting station for the
British Navy,?


A great service would be rendered to the Empire if the
little kingdom of Tonga? important on account of its
strategic position?could be brought into the proposed con-
federation?say on the basis of retaining its political
autonomy and its flag. The accomplishment of this
seems not improbable. Already, with the consent of King
George, there is a British Protectorate over the group ; and
during his recent tour of annexation, Lord Ranfurly, the
Governor of New Zealand, was received by the King in
high state and with the utmost cordiality.
It is not, perhaps, too much to expect that ere long some
international arrangement may be come to by which
France may be induced to relinquish to us the New
Hebrides, receiving Gambia (which is hemmed in by
French territory) or some other equivalent in exchange,
the consolidation of her possessions in the Pacific being of
manifest importance to Great Britain. There was some
proposal to transfer this little Colony to France, in
1870, but it did not get beyond a lengthy diplomatic
correspondence.
After all, these are questions the final determination
of which rests with the Imperial Government. The rival
claim of New South Wales to a share of the trade and
commerce of the South Sea Islands will have to be adjudi-
cated on by the Colonial Office sooner or later; and there
are important political considerations to be weighed and
considered. That the ultimate decision is in safe hands,
and that, consistently with Imperial interests, nothing will
be done to obstruct the legitimate aspirations of the people
in regard to Federation is the general feeling in New
Zealand. The Colonists are willing to wait. They fully
recognise that no living statesman has done more to
promote the unity of the Empire than the present
Secretary of State for the Colonies ; and (to adopt his own
felicitous language) they will hold themselves ready, when
the time comes, to do their share in ? carrying to unknown
heights the sceptre of dominion.?
