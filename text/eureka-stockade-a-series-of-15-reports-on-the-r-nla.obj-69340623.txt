RETIRING ALLOWANCE TO MR. J. L. FOSTER.
Ordered by the Council to he printed, 20th February, 1855.
CHAS. HOTHAM, Message No. 47.
Lieutenant Governor.
The Lieutenant Governor desires to lay before the Council the circumstances under
which Mr. John L. Foster resigned the office of Colonial Secretary.
Believing that public opinion was unfavorable, and that his retirement might be
beneficial to the Colony, he voluntarily tendered his resignation.
Mr. Foster stated that his resignation would involve a heavy pecuniary sacrifice in the
loss of the pension to which he would have become entitled under the New Constitution.
Withholding the expression of any opinion as to the policy pursued previous to his
assumption of the Government, the Lieutenant Governor willingly bears testimony to the
assiduity and zeal with which the late Colonial Secretary discharged the duties of his
office, and having consulted the Executive Council as to the amount, he now recommends
the appropriation of a sum equivalent to two years’ salary, as compensation.
