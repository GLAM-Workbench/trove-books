T REFACE.
Having delivered three lectures before
the Y.M.C.A., Melbourne, I have
determined, after mature considera-
tion, to publish them in condensed
form. Ido so —
First —Because several who heard
them have professed to receive light
and encouragement, and therefore
desired me to re-deliver them, or pub-
lish them in pamphlet form for the
service of others.
Second —Because the youth of Aus-
tralia are, as a whole, living life too


fast. This is a time when warning,
philanthropic and medical, is specially
necessary.
Third —Because parents in training
their children, and tutors in fitting
their scholars for the battle of life, feel
a diffidence in giving advice calculated
to fortify youth about to mingle in the
great social economy. To assist these
persons this pamphlet is compiled, so
as to strengthen, without alarming,
innocence and virtue; and so as to
instruct all readers in the philosophy
of existence and laws of physical life.

DO THYSELF NO HARM,
A LECTURE TO MEN ONLY,
Delivered in the Interests of Social Purity before
the Y.M.C.A., Melbourne ,
BY DR. T. P. LUCAS.
Man has two natures —the spiritual
and the animal. This dual nature
has a dual mind. The animal mind
sees in the gratification of instincts
pleasure to the full, and so exercises,
again and again, the instinctive pas-
sions. The spiritual mind, influenced
by the moral law as illumined by
conscience, aspires after a righteous
restraint. The drunkard looks on the
cup with the animal mind, and rejoices
in view of the exhilarating draught.
He sees it with the spiritual eye, and
loathes his sottish self. Thus in man


there is ever a battle waging. It may
be one of the grosser passions, or it
may be one of the more intellectual,
which provides the battlefield. No
man, however high and wise—no
man, however good and holy —but
has to wage this fight. Man’s career
is determined by the issue of the
conflict. His life exhibits him at its
close the conqueror or the conquered.
With each individual the question
presses forcefully, Which shall it be ?
Shall it be the spiritual nature, rising
onward and upward for ever ; or shall
it be the animal selfishness—sinking,
sinking, sinking ever ?
Man, as a spiritual and rational
being, must be under moral law.
As a rational being he is instinctively
supplied with knowledge ; by practice,
observation, and education, he in-
creases knowledge ; and thus supplied
with stores of knowledge he has to
think, judge, and act for himself.
He is responsible for his actions.
They are his own, as a free-will
agent.


In living the acts of life, man is
responsible to his Creator, to himself,
and to his fellow-man. He is respon-
sible to God for the use he makes of
the talents entrusted to his keeping,
and for'the rendering obedience and
worship. He is responsible to himself
for the keeping of his body, and the
educating his intellect. He is respon-
sible to his fellow-man —in national
life as a subject and patriot, in social
life as a citizen, in domestic life as a
member of the family, wronging no one,
and benefiting whenever in his power.
Every man must decide his own
destiny. We are met together to
speak of our daily life and interests.
What is physical life ? It is
different to spirit life. Physical life
dies with the body existence ; spirit
life is immortal.
The Creator of the human race has
designed, that engraven fiat or instinct
shall guide the life energies to building
up, preserving, and conserving the
body life economy. So far, this rule
holds good throughout the animal
B 2


kingdom. The mere animal life is
purely instinctive, and there is no
creature responsibility where the
instincts alone automatically play.
But in His wisdom and purpose the
Creator has created new instincts in
man. He has endowed him with the
faculty of reason, and with the power
of speech. Reason is an instinct.
Man must think. He receives know-
ledge, and instinctively thinks. He
does not commence arguing—the very
argument would be thought Shall I
think about this ? shall Ibe profited ?
would it not be better to be an irre-
sponsible, simply instinctive creature ?
He cannot help thinking. He cannot,
excepting through violence, be an
irrational creature. He must think.
As a thinker he needs to communicate
his thoughts to others; hence the
instinctive power of speech. He
instinctively speaks. Instinctively, did
I say ? Yes. As I address you, if I
endeavour to reason what words I
shall use, I should simply break down
in my discourse —the thread lost, for-


gotten in the new field of thought,
“ reasoning out words.”
I believe in free-thought. Responsi-
bility of action would be unjust if
thought were fettered. But by free-
thought'l do not mean self-arrogance.
In thinking, man as a philosopher must
remember that he is only simple self.
He is only a finite something, and
that something very small. He must
bear in mind that his intelligence
is most limited, and that thus he
cannot always take in the whole field
of mental vision. He cannot therefore
fully understand. But if he will look
around on the landscape of nature, he
must see everywhere the stamp of
goodness and truth. Let man from
this learn the lesson, “ Ever trust God
where He cannot be understood.”
Observing this rule of philosophy, go
on through the realms of free-
thought. Gentlemen, remember your
high calling ; remember your lofty
endowments, and — think.
Man has to protect his physical
life. It is not for me to enter here


into an elaborate discussion on physi-
cal life. Let it suffice to say that the
instincts guide the life-energy to the
performing life work. Life is energy
in action. This energy we will call
electro-vital nerve energy. It behaves
somewhat like electricity; hence the
term electro-vital. It acts through a
vast cordon of batteries and wires.
The batteries are the nerve ganglia,
and the wires are the nerve fibres.
The energy is derived from chemi-
cal and physical sources. The food
we eat is by chemical and physiological
changes converted into blood. Ihe
air we breathe acts chemically in and
through the blood. ,
LlllUUgll f
This blood consists of a water
vehicle, holding in suspension millions
of small bodies called corpuscles.
These corpuscles are ever in circula-
tion in the blood current. In the
respiratory or smaller circulation they
absorb oxygen from the air and give
off carbonic acid. In the greater or
general body circulation they give off
oxygen and absorb carbonic acid ; and


so the blood is continuously under-
going chemical change. Such change
produces electricity and furnishes
energy. The hydrocarbon foods —as
the fats, starches, and sugars—unite
with oxygen, and by their combustion
elaborate heat and electricity. The
nitrogenous foods —as the gluten of
bread, casein of cheese, kreatin and
kreatinin of meat—by their decompo-
sition and chemical and physiological
changes, elaborate electricity and heat;
and thus the food, by its disintegration
and elaboration, is a continuous source
of life energy.
The inspired air, by its action on
the blood in the lungs and by its own
innate energy, is another source
whence energy is drawn for life
purpose. But further, in the blood
flow, the millions of corpuscles are
continuously subjected to friction, and
the blood current itself must also obey
the laws of friction. Friction elaborates
electricity, and thus another possible
source of energy is secured by the
blood circuit itself.


In the world of physics increased
electric or magnetic force is secured
by multiple electric cells or magne-
tised plates, or by stored-y vp energy in
secondary batteries, as in Faure’s.
Nature is one; and in all experi-
ments and discoveries man is simply
examining laws, or the fiat enunciated
by an Infinite Intelligence in the
eternal past.
In the animal, the nerve ganglia or
batteries continuously distribute the
energies of life; but they are too
delicate to draw from physical materials
and to evolve instantaneously excess
of physical energy. The mechanism
designed and the frail physical en-
durance of organic nerve matter would
not allow a sufficient multiplication of
generating cells ; and so we find that
the life energy is stored in secondary
ganglia or batteries. This is proved
by the fact that severe strains on the
strength can be overcome by the
power of strength or stored-up energy,
but repeated strains draw forth weaker
and weaker manifestations, until at


last a period of rest has to be provided
to recuperate the secondary store
ganglia.
Again, the life economy itself
affords proof. The night of rest is
necessafy to charge the batteries with
energy sufficient to discharge the
duties of the coming day. The blood
in its continuous circuit becomes the
vehicle of energy. As it flows
through the nerve centres it charges
those centres with renewed energy ;
and in batteries, whence that energy
is not continuously distributed, it
becomes stored.
A further proof is seen in the
response of the nerves to electric
shock for some time after death.
The shock discharges stored energy.
Life energy is limited. Like the
energy carried in the steam working
a steam engine, it can only do work
commensurate with the supply.
Life energy is divided into two
parts. The one, the larger portion, is
within the province of instinct,< and
independent of the reason individual.


It provides for the fundamental es-
sentials of life existence. The other,
the smaller part, is laid at the feet of
reason and for the working of in-
telligent acts.
The functions for which energy
must be provided are seven. Three
absolutely necessary to life existence,
two to life economy, and two to life
intelligence.
i. The Circulatory. —The right
heart must beat and force the blood
which it receives from the body
through the lungs. The left heart
must beat and force the blood which
it receives from the lungs through
the whole body. The arteries and
arterioles must carry on the flow to
the capillaries, those smallest vessels
where the greatest chemical changes
go on; and, lastly, the veins must
receive and return the blood to the
heart. All this needs continued
energy; and so Nature instinctively
makes this the first call.
2. The Respiratory. The dia-
phragm, together with the muscles


of the chest and thorax, continuously
draw in and expel air from the lungs.
By elaborate and delicately designed
mechanism that air is brought in
contact with the blood, and so the
blood is'revitalised. All this is de-
pendent upon continuous supplied
energy, and the economy is placed as
second to be imperatively supplied
before all comers.
3. The Electro-radiatory and Ra-
diatory Thermal. —Vital energy cannot
act physiologically on a dead body.
To make the animal economy a
success the whole body must be kept
alive. It needs to be continuously
charged with electro vitality and to be
kept at a heat temperature of 99 deg.
Fahr. The Atlantic cable is kept
charged with electricity, and thus
messages are more certainly and
rapidly passed over its wires; and the
animal nerve fibres need to be con-
tinuously charged with electro vitality,
so as the more instantaneously and
effectively to receive and coijvey
messages.


And so, while the heart and systemic
circulation are essential, while the
lungs and respiration are essential,
body life is also an essential, and is
ranked by Nature third in the im-
perative order of supply.
4. The Digestive. —In this we in-
clude the various and elaborate
mechanisms for receiving, digesting,
and assimilating the food, and those
designed to separate and carry off the
refuse and wastes. A machine is
inert, however clever its design and
structure, until supplied with the
acting energy ; and so the animal body
is simply dependent for its vitality, or
vital distributions of energy, on con-
tinuous supply of foods giving energy.
And food, as a strength-giver, is inert
unless its energy be drawn off and
appropriated by the organism. Diges-
tion and assimilation are imperative to
life economy, and so are placed fourth
among all applicants.
5. The Balancing. —A special organ
is created to secure an even and
continuous distribution of balancing:


powers, and perhaps of all motor
power. The cerebellum enables the
body to stand upright. This organ
and the ganglia in connection secure
locomotion and doubtless contractile
and extensor action in all muscles. I
once shot a bird in the Riverina, and
only wounded it in the cerebellum.
It could not fly. When it attempted
to run it quickly fell—it had not power
to flap its wings ; when it got up and
raised itself from the ground it as
rapidly fell. Yet, though its vitality
seemed normal, it presented the
phenomenon of a living life without
the power of practical application.
Soon after it was shot it fell into a
puddle of water and was drowned.
Balancing and muscular motor power
of every shade is an essential to life
economy.
6. The Senses. Five special
senses are essential to intelligent
existence. General sensory nerves of
the system receive impression of in-
fluences which, acting, lead to definite
results These are factors in the


working of the life instincts. The
special senses are necessary to make
the life intelligence a success.
7. Reason —This function is not an
essential to animal life, but it is an
essential to increased intelligence and
to spiritual vitality.
Two other functions are a part of
life economy first, the formative,
providing in childhood and youth for
the growth and development; second,
the generative, providing in matured
individuals for the continuance of the
race.
Two illustrations, or series of illus-
trations, prove the respective sequence
in order of prominence of the seven
essential life, economic, and intelli-
gent functions. When life energy is
largely and continuously drawn upon,
the functions give in inverse order to
their essential need. When a creature
is narcotised the first function to yield
abeyance is power overthe intelligence.
In man reason becomes dethroned.
The instinct is first crippled and then
collapses.


The next functions to begin to give
are the senses, and almost in a parallel
the balancing powers. The legs are lost
to self-control, as seen in the walking
of a drunken man, and power rapidly
decreases, until the arms are inert;
but meantime the powers of digestion
have been failing. This is evident by
the vomiting so often induced. Food
which to the vital acting stomach
stimulates action, in a weakened
stomach becomes a poison, or a source
of irritation as a mere foreign body,
and so, if there be energy enough to
hand, induces vomiting.
Lastly, the three functions abso-
lutely essential to life, minute by
minute, are now defended by instinct’s
greatest power, sleep. Nevertheless,
if the agency, as alcohol, still be forced
to abstract the life energy to an
exhaustive degree, even these func-
tions collapse, and death ends the
struggle.
When the body is exhausted by six-
teen or seventeen hours’ active life,
sleep naturally allows a restoration of


energy and repair of nerve-tissue.
Reason must first give up the helm,
before the senses, the limbs, and the
muscles become passive. But during
sleep the three foremost and essential
life functions are instinctively kept
acting.
In nature it is provided that after
sufficient energy has been elaborated
for the instinctive acts, a further supply
shall be afforded for the purposes of
intelligent w iH action,
O , ,
For the employment of this energy
man is responsible. The supply is
limited.
For the sake of argument we will
consider the potential energy of the
human body as 2050 points per twenty-
four hours, the point being an unknown
value. We will broadly assume 1550
as absolutely necessary to the instinc-
tive life powers; 500 is thus left to
the disposal of the rational intelligence.
2050 of energy is elaborated and
appropriated by the animal economy
every twenty-four hours. Apportion
1200 of this (speaking comparatively


and broadly) in uninterrupted expen-
diture through the whole twenty-four
hours to the sustaining circulation,
respiration, and body vitality, functions
essential to life. Cessation for a few
moments "would mean damage, and if
the moments run into minutes, ex-
treme danger, and too often death, and
so the supply has to be continuous.
350 is thus left for the energy requisite
to digestion, balancing power, and the
special senses.
It is well known that the circulation
is less powerful during sleep than
during waking. But the difference is
not great. To take, then, an average
of energy elaborated and energy ex-
pended we have two different sums. ■
If 2050 points of energy be elabo-
rated in twenty-four hours, 683.3 will
be elaborated during sleep, allowing
eight hours as a maximum for sleep.
We apportioned 1200 points of
energy to the sustaining for twenty-
four hours the circulation, respiration,
and body life. This divided by three
gives us 400 points, the essential


energy expended by these functions
during sleep.
But during sleep the digestive
powers act sparingly, and chiefly in the
elaboration of wastes ; allow, then, 50
points of energy as utilised by these
functions during sleep.
Take, then, the 683.3 points of
energy as the amount elaborated
during sleep, and 400 points essential
outflow, plus 50, digestive outflow, and
we have (avoiding decimals) 683 points
of energy evolved, and 450 points ex-
pended during sleep. This leaves a
surplus of 233 points of energy to be
stored in secondary batteries for the
active service of the coming day.
In the sixteen hours of day, man has
500 points of energy at his intelligent
disposal. He can utilise, say, 450 in
the mental and physical duties of his
calling, reserving 50 for private advan-
tageous outlay—as reading, walking,
listening to oratory or music, or other-
wise, as he pleases.
And while he thus lives, provided
no outside accident befall, or sanitary


condition interfere, and provided his
constitution is healthy, then he should
live a healthy life, and enjoy the physi-
cal pleasure ensuing therefrom. But
if he infringe beyond this 450 for
official duties of his calling and this
50 allowed for healthy pleasure and
pursuits, then he interferes with
nature, and wrongs the life instincts ;
and proportionately as he wrongs so
he suffers.
In commercial transactions a man
sometimes obtains goods without pay-
ing for them. In physical life no
result can be achieved, no pleasure
can be obtained, excepting by pay-
ment, and that in the coin of the
physical realm, potential energy.
How, then, can energy be thrown
away ?
In the steam-engine the easiest way
to throw away the energy is to open
the escape-valves and let off steam.
In physical life idleness opens the
valves and disperses energy. N o
act of life is performed without,pro-
portionate expenditure of energy.
c 2


Where those acts are foolish, energy
is wasted, because expended without
a satisfactory return for the outlay.
We have given 450 as the outlay
justifiable for the day s duties popu-
larly speaking, the days work. If a
man go beyond this he draws on his
50 healthy recreation, and so, more or
less, curtails the item. If he go still
further, then he by violence appro-
priates more or less of the 350 appor-
tioned to the digestive, balancing, and
sensory functions, blow often the
furred tongue shows the deficient
vitality of the stomach, bde must
cease such folly, or soon he will under-
mine his health beyond repair. But
man cannot lay hands, except by
violence, on all the 350 Irom this
source, inasmuch as sleep, in the
interests of instinct, dethrones the
reason, and lays the man on his back
to rest. And beyond this 350 man
cannot interfere, by exces-
sive and direct violence. This philo-
sophy shows the serious responsibility
of masters to servants. To demand


more than the 450 intelligent daily
duty service from an employe, is to rob
the individual of so much physical
life. To prolong such robbery to
shortening the period of physical
life is, morally speaking, murder. A
man so robbing himself becomes a
suicide. And, on the other hand, a
servant is responsible to the employer
for the 450 day-duty energy. He
may waste largely in idleness, or he
may appropriate a portion for his own
selfish pursuits. We apportioned 50
as the energy point to be expended
during a single day in pleasures or
healthy relaxations from business. A
man may smoke, expending 2 to 5 point
energy in each pipe or cigar. He may
be such an inveterate smoker as to
use all his relaxation energy in puffing
and swallowing tobacco fumes. But
such self-indulgers rarely transgress
in one selfish indulgence alone.
Hence the smoking off 50 life energy
does not simply represent a righteous
using 50 recreative energy, but neces-
sitates, with other indulgences, ab-


straction from the energy of daily
duty, and even from digestive energy.
What a tale the beefy tongue or the
brown dry tongue of smokers so often
tells of lowered digestive power.
Responsibility preaches temperance
all round. A man, by the power of
will, draws 80 or 90 for recreative
excitement, and 500 for duty work;
590 cannot be taken from a possible
500 ; 90 must therefore be abstracted
from digestive energy. In a
the life economy capital must be in-
vaded. It must be forced to increase
the supplies. But man is not nature s
lord, and so increased play has to sub-
mit to the fiat, increased rest ; And if
proportionate rest be not given, dis-
ease and premature death must follow.
Overstrained powers must flag, and
hence the healthy vigour vanishes, the
intellectual powers wane, and the
digestive functions become diseased.
Intemperance of any kind wastes and
curtails life energies. Alcohol is an
active and rapid exhauster of life
energy. We computed 300 (35°‘5 C )


as the equivalent payment for the day s
activity for the digestive, sensory, and
motor results. We allotted 50 to
digestion during sleep ; and we left
500 for the intellectual life duties.
Thus weJiave 800— that is, 233 stored
from the night period, and 567
generated in the day for the day s
life economy and active life in-
telligence. A man sits down to
drink alcohol. Four to six glasses
or half-pints of beer ordinarily
will intoxicate. Two to three pints,
20 ozs. to the pint, come to 40 to
60 ozs. Beers vary, and so 4.0 to
60 ozs. may contain any quantity be-
tween 4to 10 ozs. of alcohol. Allow
6 oz. of alcohol on the average to in-
toxicate, and what does it mean ?
Practically that the 6 ozs. expend or
render inert a large proportion of the
800 life energy. The life energy of
a whole day, that of the life economy
and that of the active intelligence,
is practically wasted because spent
through the physiological stimulus and
in the burning off the alcohol. And


nature has to induce sleep to recuperate
and to save. Where is the practical
gain ? The exhilarating elysium and
the temporary cessation from activity
of life are surely not worth the loss,
to say nothing of the objectionable
after-consequences, both physical and
moral.
A day’s passive vitality and active
work utilise a day’s whole and a
night’s stored energy, and in the
economy of life nature rests and recu-
perates by sleep. A drunken spree
practically expends an equal amount
of energy, and so nature instinctively
seeks to give rest and to recuperate
the exhausted body and brain by a
drunken sleep.
Supposing the 6 ozs. of alcohol to
appropriate 500 out of the 850 brain
and life economy energy, reckoning a
glass of whisky or brandy at 1 oz.
of alcohol, then each glass virtually
expends 83.3 of energy. What
a loss, and for what ? Because a
friend calls to see you ! Because a
traveller wishes to make you buy i


Because the doctor orders it! Or be-
cause you like it !
A glass of wine contains about
2 ozs. Reckoning the wine at 25 per
cent, alcohol, you lose 41.6, or more
than four-fifths your day’s recreation
energy —for what ? For the sake of
custom! Because of its upper-class
luxuriousness! For the sensation of
warmth ! Or because you know not
why !
But you answer, Medical men tell
us that alcohol increases vital energy.
It does increase the speed of elaborat-
ing agency. It does run the pulse up
from 72 to 120 or 140 per minute.
But the accession of speed means a
sequence of fall; and increased pres-
sure on the works always means
increased wear and tear ; and increased
wear and tear mean, until recupe-
rated, a lowered vitality. Where,
then, is the wisdom of expending, say,
three glasses of port a day—l 23
energy —in a weakened vitality!
Spending it for what ? To increase,the
speed of vital action and consequent


outflow of vital energy ? Certainly.
But at the expense of the life capital
and of the nerve batteries generally!
One can understand that such practice
would be philosophical in a sudden
emergency —to tide over a river, or to
buoy over a temporary difficulty ; but
since alcohol wastes energy, how it
-can be wise to administer it, excepting
for a temporary difficulty, is certainly a
marvel!
Physiologically, alcohol is a stimu-
lant. It drives the circulation with
increased speed. Increased speed is
sometimes of temporary advantage.
The driver of the locomotive sees
ahead of the train a pair of gates
closed across the line, obstructing the
permanent way. He turns on full
steam ; and with increased energy the
engine smashes the gates to shreds,
while the train scarcely feels the
shock.
But after a frost, or from some other
cause, a land-slip takes place. A
portion of the embankment falls on to
the line. The engine-driver sees it


ahead. Does he turn on full steam ?
Certainly not. To do so would be
madness and certain destruction. No ;
he reverses steam, and seeks to stay
or back his engine.
In fever and pneumonia we get the
fallen embankment. Where is the
philosophy of urging increased speed
against the congested (loaded)
vessels ? It is only wasting energy
by violence. A wise physician, as a
wise engineer, would most assuredly
signal : Lower the speed —reduce the
circulation, and then by local action,
as the navvies in the railway cutting
with pick and shovel, remove the
obstruction.
But, says the savant , alcohol gives
strength. How ? It contains no
nitrogen, the great builder-up of
muscle, the great constituent of
blood. By stimulation ? Does the
thrashing which speeds the jaded
horse up to eight or ten miles an hour
mean increased strength ? If so, then
thrash your horses, and dram your
sick for ever!


Alas! the fatuity of habit and
superstition! I was called to see a
poor man. He had had typhoid
fever, and for nearly three months was
drugged with brandy. Afterwards
he had had pneumonia, and again for
nine weeks was fed on brandy and
e gg. The stimulation caused chronic
disease. The man became a dipso-
maniac, and I was called in, only to
see him die of sheer exhaustion.
Such is the strength —strength of
body, strength of manhood, wrecked !
The nerve ganglia are the invested
capital of manhood. The nerve
energy is the interest on which the
individual has to live. As long as
the man rationally and economically
lives within his means —the interest of
his capital—he may expect a healthy,
vigorous life proportionate to his
capacities. But when he goes beyond
this, he interferes with the capital
invested. And interference, exten-
sive and prolonged, sooner or later
brings physical bankruptcy.
But, answers the student of physio-


l°gy and physics, the alcohol, by its
combustion within the body, supplies
energy, and so becomes a food.
Anstie argued in this wise, and
demonstrated air as a food. But, in
the correct and popular sense, is air a
food ? Can a man live on air ? It
may be a food, in an abstract sense,
as supplying an agent largely used in
the physiological and chemical labora-
tories of vitality. And in this sense
alcohol may be called a food. Like
other hydrocarbons, it burns in the
system, and in burning supplies heat
and energy. But as the supply of
oxygen is limited by the respiratory
capacities, so we cannot have alcohol
combustion in the body, excepting at
the expense of the natural fat and
sugar combustions. As may be seen
by taking a spirit lamp and an oil
lamp, alcohol has a greater affinity
than oil for oxygen, and so lights more
easily. Thus it is in the body that
alcohol takes the preference, burning
in the presence of fats and starches ;
and hence it is that in the habitual


toper, where ease and plenty and drink
combine to drive away dull care —as in
so many publicans and their wives
nature has to store up the naturally
provided fats until they may again be
wanted. These fats are stored up
about the muscles, in the liver, and
around the heart, and eventually
become sources of disease. So much
for alcohol as a food.
Many have to direct the duty-
energy to mental work. Here special
care is necessary.
Mental anxiety and worry rapidly
exhaust the life energy. The brain
and the stomach are intimately con-
nected, and act and re-act propor-
tionately on each other. Every
anxious thought means a loss of
energy. An old proverb says that
every sigh shortens life. At all
events, it discharges energy. Worry
and trouble specially undermine the
health. They lower the vital powers
of the brain; they weaken those of
the stomach. Worry soon preys upon
the vitals. It destroys the energy


creative power of the capital; it
dulls the life centres; it slowly
but surely saps the existence.
The stomach is largely under the
guidance of man’s intelligence. He
O , o
can steal energy belonging to it and
apply to other purposes, and in conse-
quence the food is not well digested
and the body is not perfectly nourished.
Again, he can introduce foods which
constitutional weakness orloweredvital
energies cannot digest, and so, both
directly and indirectly, he brings on
himself much suffering, and wastes
much energy because of his weak-
nesses and his appetites. The tongue
is the indicator of the condition of the
stomach. How few people who do
not transgress in this direction ! What
sufferings dyspepsia entails. What a
host of diseases follow impaired diges-
tion ; and how the brain and the
stomach act and re-act on each other ;
and how the vital energies are
minimised, because the inflow is so
weighted. Mind and body both suffer
largely from an unhealthy stomach.


In Australia the large amount of
animal food used causes an exalted
stimulation to the mucous lining of the
alimentary canal. Hence too often
piles and summer diarrhoea are the
result. One of our reasons for a too-
forward youth is the three times a day
indulgence in meats. I was witness
to an incident showing the relation
existing between the balancing powers
and stomach energies. In honour of
Christmas Day, the sailors of the ship
“ Essex” were regaled with a goodly
portion of roast pork and plum dough
(duff). Immediately after dinner the
sports began. Five sailors in friendly
competition ascended to the mast-
head. With power of will, they put
energy into their muscles for clinging
and climbing. They had consequently
to withdraw energy from the stomach.
The abundance of rich food thus acted
as a poison irritant, and so nature came
to the rescue, in enabling three sailors
from the mast-head and two from the
vessel deck to disgorge their dinner
into the sea.


Games and recreation are right;
but reason must hold the reins, or even
these become destroyers of life energy.
The rower, by the power of his will,
stimulates the heart to increased
speed. He puts on every strain so
as to produce greater power. If this
be often repeated and continuously
beyond a wise exercise, the heart
power breaks down and the organ
becomes crippled—diseased. I have
seen several instances in the colonies
of heart disease induced by rowing.
Football and cricket are healthy
games, but, carried to extremes, they
often cause expenditure of more energy
than is wise. The return, too often, is
not commensurate with the outlay.
Gymnastics may be made a healthy
exercise, but reason should here always
dictate wisdom. Gymnastics offer
temptation for severe straining.
Where man has an amount to expend
in a healthy game, he is warranted in
such expenditure, provided he secure
an equal complement of health to. his
outlay. But if he lose time and


strength, with no other return than
mere physical excitement, then his
outlay is worse than useless—it is
destructive to self and self-interests.
We now come to the great question
of the day.
The passions are the expressions,
the demonstrations, of individual self.
The passions declare the character,
the composition, the mould of the
man. They speak the man himself.
The passions are a righteous
creation. Without passions man
would be an inert automaton. Pas-
sions are the fire of the soul. They
are the consummations of intelligence.
Power of passions means force of
character.
The passions are instinctive. They
are illustrative forces of life intel-
ligence. They are the self of the
intelligence. In man we see a
phenomenon, an unsolvable mystery.
We see a spirit ego imprisoned in an
animal cage and subjected to an
economy of animal passions.
We see no solution of the question


in nature or in wisdom left to us by
the ancients. We turn to the Bible,
which holds the records of communi-
cation from Infinite Intelligence, and
we are shortly told that Christ Jesus,
in His person of the Godhead, sub-
jected us to vanity—to this animalism
—not willingly, but in hope. And
we are taught throughout the sacred
volume that that hope is the restora-
tion of the fallen spirit to life, and a
progressive development in wisdom,
holiness, and happiness for ever.
It would take too long to go into
the philosophy of the mystery. Suffice
it to say that by means of the passions,
man, as a free-will agent, has to be
educated so as to know himself and
know his duty and position in the
intelligent universe.
While the passions ever tend to
exhibition, that tendency is defined
and is limited proportionately to the
inciting causes present. Thus it is
within the power of reason to curtail
and restrain, or to encourage and call
forth, the passions.


The behaviour of the passions
under the tutorship of reason is like
the behaviour of a particular species
of tree under the influences of the
weather. If the tree be continuously
watered by rain showers, if the weather
be warm and genial, and if the soil be
rich and deep, then the tree will send
down its roots deep and be a power in
the vegetable world. But if the at-
mosphere be dry, if no rain descend,
if the weather be cold and ungenial,
and if the soil be poor and shallow,
then the tree will be aborted and will
with difficulty hold its own.
The passions are like trees planted
in the soul, the intelligent existence
of the individual. They are there,
and must grow. Let reason nurture
their growth, and they increase; prune
them, and they will become fruit-
bearing trees, a power for good.
Unpruned and unrestrained, they run
wild beyond control. Let reason
cultivate any particular passion, and it
becomes a strong factor for good or
for ill in the life economy.


It is by a wise study in this realm
of duty—the training and restraining
the passions—that the spirit is able to
rise triumphant over self.
But here another axiom forces itself
on our notice. Man is the very verity
of weakness. How can the spirit
thus rise triumphant over the animal
and so walk in the narrow path lead-
ing to heaven ? Of itself it cannot;
but when it learns to know its own
weakness, then, by trusting to the
Almighty, and walking in strength by
His grace supplied, it will rise-
triumphant, and, rising higher and
yet higher, will at length be fitted to
be with the Eternal, and unceasingly
to be increasingly wise, holy, and
happy for ever.
In early manhood the fiercest pas-
sions are the sexual.
Instinct keeps childhood and youth
innocent, like as it did Adam and
Eve in Paradise ; but sensational
books, filthy conversation, and evil
example are powers from without
which, like the serpent’s message,


open to the mind’s eye the pathways
of good and evil.
Youth dwells on these revelations ;
thought arouses the passions into
activity; lawful means for indulging
them are wanting, and reason invents
artificial devices for exercising the
desire.
In the human social economy it is
wisely decreed that man who cannot
restrain his passions shall marry. One
man is to have one wife, and they
twain are to be one flesh. Under
this provision, reason can hold the
sexual passion to the righteous
economy of human life —the raising
and training up a family in virtue and
innocence.
But when youth, cruelly awakened
to knowledge, puts forth its hand to
eat of the fruit, it saps vitality in the
eating thereof.
The social economy wisely needs
all the energy of youth to carve out
the individual life purpose. It does
not, therefore, provide for children
marriage; but it allows time for inno-


cence to shield the individual until
the strength is matured, and then it
provides freedom and means for
honourable marriage.
In the present day, society, as a
sum individuality, lives too fast. The
people are too severely absorbed in
animal selfish pursuits. The pursuits
of the mind are largely forgotten in
the craze for commercial gain; and
where the pursuits of the mind follow
luxuriously accumulated commercial
gains, it is too often only the ball-
room, the theatre, the racecourse, or
the gambling saloon that captivate
the intelligence.
The atmosphere of a too fast society
is not healthy for youth. Evil con-
versation and coarse jokes are the
fruits of unrefined intelligence; and
so youth is led on to vicious thoughts,
and from thought to habit.
Numbers of youths throughout
Australia have too early tapped the
life springs by the indulgence in secret
of evil habits. Every such indulgence
means loss of vital energy ; continued


and repeated indulgence means damage
to the capital, the central nerve
ganglia. This leads to severe demon-
strations of nerve weakness. The
most severe are epileptic fits, but
fortunately, under a merciful Provi-
dence, these are generally averted by
a revelation of wisdom. Nevertheless,
the symptoms are so alarming that
many unprincipled impostors trade
upon such slavish fears to their own
selfish gluttony. These impostors
magnify the evil; many of them oftener
do more harm than good, and all of
them feed sumptuously at the expense
of their too-confiding victims.
It would be waste of energy and a
pandering to vice to describe the evils
associated with evil practices. No
doubt 999 out of every thousand can
he cured. If the reader is innocent,
let him be thankful and wisely remain
in that innocence until the intelligence
and the circumstances of position are
powerful enough to receive the revela-
tion. But if he suffer from nervous
debility, then let him wisely consult a


medical man whose personal upright-
ness and professional skill shall be
beyond suspicion. I do not say
that every man holding a medical
diploma is such a practitioner in point.
Some—*alas ! but there are black sheep
in every fold —consider such cases law-
ful game for experiment and plunder.
How, then, shall the public know ?
Three rules can be laid down upon
which to found a judgment:—First,
the reputation of the practitioner.
Second, the advice given. If it be
immoral, such as the guiding to one
vice to escape another, go elsewhere.
If it be endeavours to frighten, then
give no confidence. Third, the lees.
If a lump sum be immediately
demanded, trust not, but go elsewhere.
If fees paid over a length of time
amount in the aggregate to a lump
sum too large according to judgment
for the benefits received, then go else-
where, Never trust to chemists
or unqualified practitioners. To any
suffering under bondage and fear, I
fearlessly urge, fear not. Listen not


to the exaggerations and be not allured
by the conundrum machinations of
quacks. Conquer yourself, and the
victory is more than half won ! Do
you reply, you cannot ? You must.
Doctors cannot do it for you. Some
people like to lie in the gutter of
despair, crying, Woe is me ! Rise out
of this loathsome humiliation and play
the man. If you will not rise, no skill
can save you. If you will grovel in
the dust, in the dust you must perish.
You are weak; make the effort, and
strength shall come. Make the effort
with your eyes to heaven, and victory
lies before you.
The temptations are great; true,
but largely through your own act.
The mind must sink and become
vitiated before the life issues suffer.
Let the mind be renewed and the
temptations must dwarf. Human
weakness is so great that safety from
an evil often only lies in flight. You
cannot fly from yourself, but the mind
can flee from brooding over evil.
Reason, while seeking agencies to


renewed body health, should also seek
healthy mental employment, so as to
allow the mind no time to look on the
forbidden fruit, and no time to breathe
a gutter atmosphere—the brooding
over ills-come o’er.
Marriage is honourable to all men,
and the bed undefiled. Woman was
destined to be moral and virtuous.
Throughout the whole animal crea-
tion, humanity excepted, at stated
periods the female is prepared for
generation. Instinct at all other
times keeps the intelligence in ignor-
ance.
Nature is one, and laws apply
generallyto the whole animal kingdom.
In accordance with this law woman at
stated periods would be prepared for
ofeneration. And so she is. If, how-
ever, the fact were made known to her
intelligence as it is to the lower
animals, no woman could be virtuous ;
and humanity would sink into animal-
ism, and collapse socially ; and so the
law is added to, and woman is specially
defended when she is weakest.


Since, then, the Creator defends
woman by this special safeguard, and
always by modesty and a fear of
shame, how abominable mast be that
selfishness in man which would break
into the citadel of womanly virtue
and innocence! And how low and
degraded is that character which de-
lights in debased prostitution! Nature
utterly loathes such career, and
brandishes it with adjuncts of foul
disease. Nay, further, the offspring
of such people too often are tainted;
and continuous repetition of these evils
in families leads to scrofula and con-
sumption, until the families die out,
and Nature, as in the case with the
savages, destroys the breakers of the
moral law, and provides for the sur-
vival of the fittest.
There is a proverb, “ While there
is life there is hope.” Have you
seen your folly, and repented of
your wickedness ? Have you made
restitution as far as possible to those
you have wronged ? Is your mind
now healthy ? Are you prepared to


do right at all costs ? . If not, where
is your manhood ? Continue in your
ways, and the issue will be death.
Forsake them, and go in the paths of
virtue and life. Are you sick, op-
pressed by nature’s retributive justice?
—there is mercy and healing. Here,
as in weaknesses before noticed, the
victim needs special warning to avoid
worse evils. Too often mercurial
drugs are poured into the system
until the remedy is worse than
the disease. In addition to advice
already tendered, I say to all
sufferers, on no account subject your
bodies to be dosed with heavy and
increasing accumulative doses of mer-
cury. If you suspect such treatment,
any respectable practitioner or chemist
will tell you the quantities from the
prescription. Mercurials produce, in
large doses, sores, wounds, skin erup •
tions, &c., most difficult to control and
hard to cure.
Finally, gentlemen, play the man.
Philanthropy is the most glorious
occupation for creature intelligence.


Earth is the platform of tremendous
struggle. Every man, woman, and
child is living onwards and upwards,
or dying and sinking downwards.
Every rational individuality must rise
into the Life of God, or sink into the
grave of self. Will you join in the
work of philanthropy, and employ all
your energies in benefiting and raising
yourself and others?—or, will you
become a pestilence to yourself and a
curse to others ? Will you shine in
raising the world toward God and
heaven ?—or will you be lost In the
darkness of self and despair ? If you
have been drifting down the current,
turn the tide now. If you have
suffered, never lose hope, but let the
sufferings, as ten thousand warnings,
set your feet upon a rock and guide
your heart after wisdom. Life is
drawing in ; our career on earth must
soon close. Up, then, and be doing.
Act on your birthright, and in the
strength of manhood crucify self,
and pour out your life energies in the
interests of righteousness, purity, and


love, and yours shall be a crown of
life and immortality for ever.
Lost in self and Nature’s night,
Look ahead and see the light;
Never listen to despair,
Hope is beaming everywhere.
Gird your manhood, face the foe;
In the strength of Heaven you go;
Then unfailing truth assures
That the victory shall be yours.
