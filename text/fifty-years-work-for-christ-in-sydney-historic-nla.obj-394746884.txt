FIFTY YEARS’ STORK FOR CHRIST IN
SYDNEY.
Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall
prosper that love thee.
Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity
within thy palaces.
For my brethren and companions’ sakes, I
will now say, Peace be within thee.
Because of the house of the Lord our God I
will seek thy good.
—Psalm cxxii, 6-9.
><?o
origin of our Congregation was on this
Jr wise. In the year 1842 a number of
families seceded from Scots Church, Sydney,
and formed themselves into a separate spiritual
society. They found a home first in Macquarie
Place, then in Castlereagh Street, but eventually
settled down in an old Wesleyan chapel, opposite
the Royal Mint.
There they remained with varying fortunes
for two years (1844-1846), and then it had to be
determined whether the Presbyterians in Sydney
were to adhere to the Established Church of Scot-
land or to come out on the side of the Free Church


of Scotland, which for the sake of the principle of
spiritual independence had made surrender of so
great a temporal heritage. The majority of the
Rev. George Mackie.
people worshipping in Macquarie Street declared
for the Free Church, and secured for their use
a church in Pitt Street, then just vacated by
the Independents, on the site on which the


Sydney School of Arts now stands —the original
church being part of the present structure.
They sent to Scotland, to the Colonial Com-
mittee of the Free Church, for a minister,
but had to wait till the year 1849, when
the Rev. George Mackie came to this colony.
He was sent out by the Free Church, but
not to the Sydney congregation. He was
a man of such vigour, however, and his coming
seemed so opportune, that they eagerly con-
strained him to ftirry with them till the minister
designated for the city should arrive. Forthwith
Mr. Mackie proceeded to organize the congrega-
tion, forming a communion roll, and getting
a Session and Deacons’ Court duly elected.
All this was done by the end of July, 1849,
from which date we count our Jubilee —from the
time when the congregation *was fully organized,
and recognized as a charge in communion with
the Free Church of Scotland.
In October of the same year the Rev.
Alexander Salmon was inducted to the pastoral
oversight of the Free Church congregation, and
Mr. Mackie went to the South Coast, carrying
with him the warm love of the people to whom
he had so consistently ministered for six months.


He was indeed a man of great energy, eminently
gifted in intellect and spirit.
Mr. Salmon found himself at the head of a

vigorous spiritual community. He addressed
himself to his work in Sydney with splendid
courage. The Church was overcrowded. The
enlargement of the building failed to meet the


demand for sittings. When the congregation
was formed there were less than 30,000 persons
in Sydney; but the discovery of gold in 1851
made a vast change. Population rushed into
city and country by thousands and thousands.
The Deacons’ Court of the Free Church, with
the concurrence of the congregation, determined
to send to Scotland for an iron church to seat
800 people. This course was adopted because
skilled labour in Sydney was costly as well as
scarce owing to the gold fever then raging. The
venture turned out a very expensive one. A
choice allotment, “ beautiful for situation,” was
secured in Macquarie Street at a cost of
on which, in due time, the iron church was
erected. The complete establishment involved
the outlay of over
The congregation left Pitt Street in 1855 “ to
meet”—so the report of the Deacons’ Court puts
it—“for the worship and service of the Great King
and Head of the Church in the large and beau-
tiful temple which He has so graciously provided
as a new resting place for His people.” The
Rev. Dr, Cairns, of Melbourne, conducted the
opening services. The sale of the Pitt Street
building for reduced the liabilities of the
Court to a little over

first minister was the Rev. Hugh Darling, and
the second the Rev. Adam Thomson. Both
were faithful and able ministers of the Word
as well as devoted pastors. In 1856 St.


George’s Free Church was formed. Provision
was also made in the same year for the spiritual
needs of the Free Church people living in the
neighbourhood of the Cleveland Paddocks. Each
new congregation meant a drain upon the mother
church in Macquarie Street. No complaint was
made. The progress of Christ’s cause was the
main interest, so minister and office-bearers held
on their way strongly and hopefully.
In 1859 Mr. Salmon’s health gave way.
He went to the Old Country for a holiday,
with instructions to select a colleague for him-
self. He never came back ; within the year he
had resigned. All of those now among us who
had fellowship with Mr. Salmon, speak of him
in terms of unqualified praise, as an eminently
gifted man, zealous and God-fearing, who did
noble service for his Master in Sydney. The
records give ample support to this. The con-
gregation began forthwith to look about for a
new pastor. The first minister asked was the
Rev. Dr. Adam Cairns, of Chalmers Church,
Melbourne; but the Doctor would not come to
Sydney. Two other Victorian ministers were
approached. Neither would come.
Then it happened that Professor Smith of
Sydney University, a devoted member of this


-church, and Mr. John S. Adam, one of the
elders, went to Great Britain on a holiday trip.
******
Rev. Dr. .Steel.
They were commissioned to select a minister.
Their choice fell on the Rev. Dr. Robert Steel


of Cheltenham who arrived in Sydney in 1862,.
and was duly inducted to the pastorate of the
Free Church, Macquarie Street. Dr. Steel
came to a living church, to a people full of
evangelical fervour, loving the truth in its
purity. He came to a church possessed by
the missionary spirit, and to a community of
believers led by men who feared nothing save
unfaithfulness to God.
When I read the records of the years 1859,.
iB6O, 1861, I cannot but admire the pertinacity
and courage of the office-bearers, for during
those years they had many hard hours of
wrestling with grievous difficulties. But they
never ceased to wrestle unto success.
Of the elders who watched over the infancy
of the congregation, William Buyers, John Mac-
donald, and Peter Stewart had gone to St. George’s,
James Henry was dead, John Little, because of ill
health, had retired from the Session, and James G.
Wilson was for some years absent from the city.
All these were highly gifted men, devoted to the
cause of Christ. The burden, of the anxious
years fell upon John S. Adam, Henry L.
Black, and Edward A. Rennie, who exerted
themselves in the interests of the church with a
persistent faith and hopefulness beyond all praise.


They were full of a great purpose, to exalt the
Kingdom of God in the heart of the city of
Sydney, and that, too, in the name of the Free
Church of Scotland in Australia. From this
purpose they would not be turned by difficulties ;
no, not by any kind of difficulty. And they had
their reward. With these were associated eight
•deacons, men of kindred spirit, as zealous and
as strong.
Supported by such strenuous, wholesome
■counsellors, Dr. Steel began his ministry. His
career as pastor of this church is well known to
all. It belongs to the history of the colony as
well as to the story of the church. How accom-
plished, noble, and faithful, how generous and
true Dr. Steel was as a man and a minister,
the records of the Church do most distinctly
declare. Also that he preached the Word in its
fulness, and served you right faithfully and well.
For thirty-one years he was minister of St.
Stephen’s, and during all these years the well-
being of the cause was amply cared for. Besides,
he was among the foremost Churchmen of
Australia.
Dr. Steel’s ministry was not by any means
an uneventful one. When he came to Macquarie
Street there was a debt of upon the


congregation, not to speak of £6OO law expenses
incurred by Mr. W. A. (now Sir William) Ogg,
in defending a claim against the congregation
on the freight of the Iron Church, which sum
that worthy friend most generously wiped off the
slate. In 1869 the treasurer, Mr. Alexander
Dean, who for thirty years had charge of the
exchequer, was able to tell the annual meeting
that there was not a penny debt against the
congregation.
Another matter of intimate importance to the
prosperity of the congregation was Psalmody.
The precentor who led the singing in 1863 was
our venerable friend Mr. P. D. McCormick, who
still lives, and is aye flourishing in his devotion
to the claims of congregational singing. After
him came a prince among precentors, a man
beloved by the congregation, William Smith.
During his precentorship the request for leave to
form a choir was first made to the Session. The
petition was granted, but the Session dared not
call the members of the singing band a choir.
They were named the precentor’s assistants.
Next it was asked that the front gallery be set
apart for the accommodation of the choir. The
Deacons’ Court consented to this; but the end
of the innovations was not yet. In 1875 it was


fifty years’ WorJ{ for Christ.
proposed that the congregation should stand
during the singing. The session yielded, and so
the people stood up to sing, and sat down or
knelt to pray. There was also a loud call for
the use of the authorised hymn book. There was
searching of heart over this, but the response was
favourable. At the same time a well-supported
petition was handed in, begging for the intro-
duction of instrumental music into the worship of
the sanctuary. The proposed innovation was too
great, too serious a matter, to be granted right
away. Neither hymn book nor organ was ever
used in the Macquarie Street Church,
Turning for a moment to affairs less
domestic, minister and people were deeply con-
cerned in the Union of the different branches of
the Presbyterian order represented in the colony
under separate governing bodies, and working
for the same high ends in an unhealthy rivalry.
The Union was happily consummated in 1865,
when the Presbyterian Church of New South
Wales came into corporate and prosperous being.
Immediately after the Union, our church with
the consent of Presbytery got the name St.
Stephen’s ; the choice of this name being deter-
mined by the immediate proximity of the church
to the Houses of Parliament.


In 1868 a movement was set on foot for
establishing a college within the University of
Sydney under Presbyterian auspices. The out-
come of this movement was that noble institution,
St. Andrew’s College, toward the founding of
which members of this congregation helped most
handsomely.
The Rev. Adam Thomson was chosen first
Principal of St. Andrew’s College. He was
minister of Phillip Street congregation, whose
beginning in King Street we have already
mentioned. The church in which we now
worship was built by them in 1857. A debt
of £I2OO rested upon it; and the attendance of
members and adherents was only moderate.
The distinctive character of the congregation
had been destroyed by the Union. No sooner
was the question of the Principalship settled
than it was suggested that the Phillip S.reet
people should join the congregation of St.
Stephen’s. Well-considered action was taken,
and as the result, the Deacons’ Court of St.
Stephen’s took over the Phillip' Street property,
paid off the debt, put in these substantial
galleries, and built the graceful steeple. The
expenditure, over swallowed up all the
subscriptions, and the got by the sale


of the building and site near Parliament House.
In March, 1875, the additions and altera-
tions having been completed, the congregation
moved from the Iron Church to their present
sanctuary. The occasion was celebrated by
special services, conducted by the Rev. Andrew
Cameron, D.D., of Melbourne. The communion
roll showed 321 members. The average at-
tendance at the Lord’s table was 220, And the
ordinary income of the Deacons’ Court,
For ten or twelve years the prosperity of
the congregation was very hearty. Instrumental
music was introduced, memorial window's were
erected, and the House of God otherwise
adorned. But about 1888 a very grave difficulty
began to shew itself. The vigour of the cause
w'as not what it used to be : the finances were
not so lusty; the attendance at Sunday School
was shrinking. The inevitable migration of
families to the suburbs had set in, and the
office-bearers were face to face with the most
serious problem of all their experience in
ecclesiastical affairs. Was St. Stephen’s to be
left high and dry—sharing the familiar fate of
city churches? True, the families were leaving
their old quarters; but the boarding - houses


were increasing in number, and great hotels
were springing up. Thousands of young men
and young women still lived in the city. So
the office-bearers, having thoroughly considered
the situation, resolved to go forward. In this
heroic undertaking they were led by James
Anderson, their session-clerk, so recently taken
from us, —most sagacious, dauntless and devoted
of men. “ No,” said they, “ St. Stephen’s shall
live and prosper. If we cannot fill the church
with families, we can serve such population as
we have round about us.” They wrestled for
victory, and in the end they gained it. So
brave, so noble-hearted, and strenuous were the
office-bearers, and the members in sympathy
with them, that they refused to think of defeat;
refused to be deterred by the ugly promise of
the morrow; refused to do aught save trust in
God, and strive to provide spiritual privileges
for the people in the neighbourhood. We can
now look back upon fifty years of work for
Christ in Sydney, and say that their efforts
were not unworthy of the best traditions of this
church.
The communion roll, which began with
35 names, has now 456 —a figure never reached
before. The average attendance which the


treasurer in 1850 set down at 300 adults for
each Lord’s Day, our present treasurer puts at
1000. The ordinary income of the Deacons’
Court, which at first was slightly over £ 6OO,
is now We are, therefore, encouraged
in our belief that the problem has, in large
part, been solved. We must thank God for
this and take courage.
ET us glance, however, at the characteristic
I* i features of the work of this congregation
during all these years. And first we think of
Home Missions. On the formation of the
church, one of the earliest things done was to
take up a collection for the Colonial Committee
of the Free Church of Scotland. “ They have
been kind to us,” said the Deacons, “in sending
us a minister and a school-master; we must
return their goodness in such fashion as we
can.” When the goldfields were discovered,
and the population had vastly increased, there
was a great demand for ministers. Our con-
gregation, then in Pitt Street, though under a
heavy burden of debt, freely and promptly
subscribed to bring out fresh men from
the Old Country. At the same time the Session
had a city missionary and two divinity students


assisting Mr. Salmon. There were meeting
places for prayer and instruction in Balmain,
Pyrmont, Paddington, Chippendale, and Woolloo-
Free Church, Pitt Street.
mooloo ; in Sussex Street also, and Kent Street,
where the godly John Macdonald did noble
work among Scottish seamen. Chalmers Church
sprang out of Pitt Street Free Church ;


Pyrmont came of the same stock ; Phillip Street
U. P. Church was an offshoot; so, too, was
St. George’s; and when Glebe Church was
formed, 52 members took their certificates from
St. Stephen’s. Indeed, there is hardly a Presby-
terian Church in the metropolitan area of Sydney
which has not got substantial advantage from
ours, which may well be called a Mother of
Churches.
Further, our church has ever taken a
decided interest in Foreign Missions. The con-
gregation was not more than a year old when
the Sunday School subscribed, and sent to
Scotland, money in aid of the Foreign Mission
Fund of the Free Church. Two years later
money was sent to India to support a teacher
there. Polynesian, Chinese, and Aboriginal
Missions have all, through long years, been
cherished and nourished by our people. If
there was a home any where for the missionary
cause, it was here.
As to work among The Young. When
the first minister came, he found in the Pitt
Street Free Church a Sunday School with no
pupils and 14 teachers. In a few months there
was another in Pyrmont, one in Balmain, and
one in Paddington ; by-and-bye, a school at


Dobroyde, another in North Sydney; another in
Darlington, and one in West Street, Darling-
hurst. All these were in connection with the
Free Church (St. Stephen’s), flacquarie Street.
Free Church in the earlier years. With the
rise of new congregations and the coming of the
Union, the branch Sunday Schools were taken
away. Yet it is a very happy reflection that


our church, which has now but one modest
school, was once the guardian of so extensive a
brood of little ones learning the way to God.
Bible Classes have been a feature of
our work. Such men as James G. Wilson, Dr.
Moon, and Professor Smith, and that noble-
hearted lady, Mrs. Talbot, were famed for their
work among the young men, and the young
women of the congregation. Our Bible Class for
South Sea Islanders is a unique institution, in
which we take much pride.
In the early days of our history, the
burden of maintaining day schools fell upon the
Church. Our first teacher, sent out by the
Free Church in 1849, was Mr. J. Ewan, an
able man, whose work among the young met
with the most encouraging success. His school
grew into an influential Normal Seminary. The
Session also formed and supported a day school
in Pyrmont, which had a useful career. It
received State aid as a recognised elementary
school.
Besides these agencies for the advantage
of the young, there was the Young Men’s
Institute, founded in 1862, which has all
through the years, under different names,
fulfilled a serviceable course. It is on the minutes


that in 1864, when the present Premier of
New South Wales, a member of the Institute,
St. Stephen’s Church, Phillip Street, Sydney.
offered a paper on Manhood Suffrage, the


executive could not see their way to accept
Mr. Reid’s offer, because the subject was too
revolutionary. Times and opinions have
changed in thirty-five years.
But I must now speak of the giving of
our people and the Voluntary Spirit which
has ever been characteristic of it. With
truth, it can be said of us as a congregation,
that we have never recived a penny of State
aid or of outside assistance in the maintainance
of the things of the Gospel in all the fifty
years of our being.
We have never had a bazaar, nor adopted
any unusual means of raising revenue for the
cause we cherish. Our record is clean. We
have always put our hands into our own
pockets and taken out our own money and
given it directly for God. We have put into
the plate at the church door, £ 21,000; we have
given as pew rents, £T 6,000 ; for church build-
ing, £"8ooo; Sustentation Fund, £"12,250; Foreign
Missions, £'4250; Home Missions, £"3000; and
miscellaneous purposes, chiefly charities, £"2500.
In all we have given fully £"67,000 right o\it of
our pockets, into the hands of the treasurer
of the Deacons’ Court, for Christ and His
work. And these sums do not include the


giving of the people who built this edifice,
and maintained religious ordinances for eighteen
years before they cast in their lot with St.
Stephen’s, nor the generous gifts of our people
to philanthropic schemes outside of our Church
institutions. All this has been done in the clear
conviction that every congregation should strive
to be self-supporting—-if possible, more than self-
supporting, and especially never to depend
upon the State. There is no boasting here.
Vastly more might have been done.
This church has always maintained a lively
interest in the social welfare of the community.
Nothing in church life is more beautiful than
devotion to the Civic Duty of faith, a duty
which is an essential part of Christian sincerity.
From the founding of the Sydney City Mission,
this congregation has been its fast friend. Our
Session for a time supported and directed the
work of two city missionaries, and also conducted
special mission enterprises in Woolloomooloo, and
in Rowe Street, where the Hotel Australia now
stands. This ancient spirit finds expression to-
day in our work in Harrington Street. The
Dorcas Society, the Temperance Society, the
Penny Savings Bank all bear witness to our care
for the social needs of the poor by our door.


And now I must not fail to note that not
the least distinguishing feature of our story is
the faithfulness of our Office-bearers. Such
steadfast, earnest, brave men ! Ever seeking
the highest ends of believing endeavour, they
have been a strength to the congregation, and
an inspiration to the ministers. All our workers
have been eminent for their zeal, their devotion,
and unselfish care for the prosperity of the
interests dear to us.
But I come to the last and chiefest
characteristic of our witness-bearing in this
city, namely, the preaching of Evangelical
Doctrine.
Not by anything but the Gospel has this
church flourished. We have never gone in for
elaborate music, nor for brass bands, nor for
sensational preaching. Our pulpit has been
devoted to Christ and Him 'crucified, to the
love of God for man unto salvation, to the
deep needs of the hearts of men, to the
gracious work of the Holy Spirit. By the
Gospel in fulness and purity, and by the Gospel
alone, has prosperity come to us, and kept
with us.
Therefore, at the close of fifty years,
we can look back and say that although we


have seen many changes, and passed through
severe crises, and lost gifted workers, whose
places it has not always been easy to fill,
we stand here before the Living God and
declare that from His kind and loving hand
we have enjoyed rich and abundant blessing—
all of it from Him. And as we turn our faces
to the work which lies before us, we find our-
selves at the dawn and not at the evening
time. We look forward to a long, good,
prosperous day in the service of Christ our
Lord. — Amen.
