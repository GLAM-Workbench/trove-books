"what might you be here for in your

"To see the King," said Tuppenny
"Well, well," said the Policeman,
"and do you know the way?"
"Til

And
she
did!
The gates of the King's Palace
stood open, but there were two soldiers
in red coats guarding them.
"Oh my!" said Tuppenny
And




she went up to one of the red
coated soldiers
"Excuse me," she said, "Eve come
to see the King.
Can

"CERTAINLY NOT!!!!!" roared
the soldier.

And

"Oh! won't they just be after me!"
cried Tuppenny.




So she got to her feet and looked
inside the brown bag to see if her
mackintosh was still there
And
was.

And it wasn't.
