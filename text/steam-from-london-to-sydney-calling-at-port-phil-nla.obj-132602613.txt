This superb Steam Ship was built only eight months since, with every modern improvement to ensure speed, and her
remarkable passages on her two voyages to India, viz.—to Bombay 26 days, from Bombay 25 days, to Calcutta 36 days
(including four days detention at Port Said), and from Calcutta 32 days (from Suez, she made the unprecedented
passage of 13½ days, including all stoppages)—prove that the confidence of her owners as to her capability to perform the
voyage to Australia in 45 days, will not be misplaced.
She has a full poop, with spacious Saloon and State-rooms, Ladies’ Saloon, Bath-rooms, Smoking-room, Ice-house,
furnished with every comfort and luxury.
