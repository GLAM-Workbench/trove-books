THE NORTONS OF SUSSEX AND
NEW SOUTH WALES.
The Nortons have been seated in Sussex from a
very early period and there possessed consider-
able landed property from the time of Elizabeth,
and, perhaps, earlier, to the end of the 18th century,
they bore the rank of gentry, sealing with a coat of
arms (three swords ending in a point).
James Norton, of Hurstpierpoint, Sussex, England,
was born in th© early part of the 18th century, and.
resided at Northend, one of his estates. He mar-
ried in 1762 Rebecca Steel, of Newtimber, and had
issue—two sons and three daughters.

presently)
(5) Amy, Bp. 30th April, 1762. Married and
died young.
/The estate was .so involved that it was sold before
John (born 1759) came of age. He lived at Leather-
head and afterwards at Ore Place near Hastings,
Sussex. Having tried farming and failed, he was
granted a post “controlling the sale of some kind of
stamp” which was only givmpto a few gentlemen.
In 1819 he followed his ©West son out to Australia
where he acquired property at Mulgoa, on the Nepean
River, near Penrith, N. S. W., which he called Fair-
light .
On the 11th June, 1782 he married Mary Masters
Bradford, and had issue—four sons and six daugh-
ters. (She died in 1828. He died on the 31st Janu-
ary, 1829, and was buried at in Australia.)

Nathaniel, horn at Leatherhead in July,
11785, died at Mulgoa, N.S.W., 17th A*ml,
1851. He entered the Royal Navy on the 6th
January, 1798, on board the “Busy,” 18, in
which vessel he assisted, in August 1799, in
taking possession of a fleet of merchantmen
under the convoy of a Swedish Frigate off
th© Island of Goree.
He afterwards joined the expedition against
the Holder •' and contributed to the capture
of the French lugger privateer, “L© Dragon,”
16, on the 16th September, 1799.
In July, 1800 he removed to the “Unite”
frigate, and in March, 1801, was present
as midshipman at the reduction of the Dan-
ish and Swedish Islands.
He was afterwards employed at Harwich
and on the Irish station from June r lBo3, to
October, 1807, in the “Romulus,” 16, and
“Helma-/ 5 18, in which latter ship he aided in
effecting the capture on th© sth June, 1805,
of “Santa Leocadia,” a Spanish privateer.
After serving nearly three months as acting
Lieutenant in the “Dryad” 36, he was nom-
inated in January, 1808, master’s mate of
the “La Virginie,” 46 guns and 281 men,
and on the 19th of May. following, he shared
in that ship and was mentioned for, his con-
duct in an obstinate conflict of an hour and
a half, which terminated in the surrender of
the Dutch frigate “Guelderland,” of 36 guns
and 253 men, 25 of whom were killed and 50
wounded, whilst of the British not more than
one man was killed and two wounded.
Mr. Norton as a reward for his conduct
was appointed Ist Lieutenant in the “Brisk”
sloop, which promotion was sanctioned by
the Admiralty on the 29th July ensuing.
Having obtained an appointment to the
“Illustrious”' 74, he witnessed, in April, 1809,
the famous attack' made by Lord Cochrane
on the enemy’s shipping in “Basque Roads,’-’
and subsequently sailed for the. East Indies,
where he assisted at the conquest of the
“Mauritius” and of the Islands of Java.
He was appointed to the command of the
“Proeris” ship, 6th February. 1812..


His last appointment was on the 30th May,
1815, to the “Tigre” in which he cruised in
the Channel. He ultimately accepted the
rank of retired commander and came out to
Australia and settled at Fairlight, Mulgoa,
N. S . W., where he married on the 3rd
March, 1841, Miss Ellen Barber, and lived
there until liis death, on the 17th August,

The third son, James Norton, born on the 27th July
1795, at Ore Place, Hastings, England, went to the
Temple and .studied for the Bar and was admitted a
solicitor in the Courts of England. Through Lord
Guildford, in 1818, he obtained the post of “Captain’s
Clerk,” on the ship “Maria” (C’apt. Williams) bound
for Australia, and left England on the 18th May,
1818, arriving in Sydney on the 15th September of
the same year, having paid £l5O for his passage
and bringing with him £BOO to the C'olony,
He became a Notary Public; under a grant from the
Archbishop of Canterbury, and carried on business in
3


a cottage in Elizabeth Street until 1832 when he
moved his office to a quaint looking building in the
same street which had just been erected.
At the same time he moved his household from a
house at the corner of King and Elizabeth Street (af-
terwards known as the “Three Tuns .Tavern”) to a
cottage at the back of his office and facing Castle-
reagh Street.
In August, 1834, he went to. live at Elswick, Leich-
hardt, and added to th© house which was originally
built by a Mr. Foster. Here he had an immense gar-
den of which he was devotedly fond. The house still
stands, although the surrounding garden and grounds
have long since been cut up and built on. The
ground sloped down from the drive in front of the
house, and you went through a little gate into the
sweetest old garden that ever was—beautiful trees
and lovely groups of tall bamboos, and a long path
with hedges of dark red Lady Brisbane roses on'one
side, and white Gardenias on the other, at the bot-
tom of which was a pond full of eels. There were
peacocks wandering all about the place, and an orchard
full of lovely fruit,, and a kitchen garden, surrounded
by Hawthorne hedges.
The house was surrounded by a park with an avenue
of Norfolk Island Pines to the house, and the drive
went on to the flagged stable yard at the back, which
was built in, with high stone walls, and contained a
nice row of brick cottages for the convict servants
and had an old well and pump in the centre.
His name first appears in a published list of the
attorneys of the colony in the New South Wales
Pocket Almanac for 1819, in conjunction with four
others. The list is.as follows: —Thomas Wylde, Esq.;
W. H. Moore, Esq.;. Frederic Garling, Esq.; T. S.
Amos, Esq. ; and James Norton, Esq.
For many years, and until the order was made by
the Supreme Court for the division of the profession
into its two branches of ‘ barristers and attorneys,
Mr. Norton practised most successfully as an advo-
cate, for which his clear perception of facts, and his
intimate knowledge of law eminently qualified him.
To his profession he gave the whole of his time and
attention; and though pressed upon more than one
occasion to come forward as a candidate for legisla-
torial honours, he invariably refused. At the same
time, upon great occasions, and when the interests of
the colony appeared to him to demand the sacrifice of
some portion of his time, he never for a moment he-
sitated in bestowing it. Thus, in the great Anti-
Transportation movement, the late gentleman was a


leading member of the League then formed, and gave
his most strenuous' exertions to the object for which
that League was formed.
He was a member of the first Legislative Council
under the new Constitution, having been appointed
to a Seat in that House by Mr. Cowper, soon after his
taking office, on the resignation of the Donaldson
Ministry. He was also Registrar of the diocese of
Sydney for many years, having been appointed Regis-
trar to Archdeacon Scott, and holding the same office
under the successive Bishops of Sydney.
While still practising as a barrister, Mr. Norton
appeared for the defendant in the famous case of
Shortt v. Berry and Wollstonecraft, in which a
feigned issue had been directed in order to try the
question of a partnership between Shortt and Berry.
The plaintiff’s case appeared to be fully made out
by a document which was known to. be a forgery, but
which was sworn to so positively that the defendant’s
ruin seemed inevitable. This important document
was written on a quarter of a sheet of foolscap, and.
after a futile cross-examination, Mr. Norton sat down
in Court at th© close of a long and weary day with
the paper in his hand. As he held the paper me-
chanically up to the light, a solitary ray from the
setting sun falling upon it revealed the fact that the
water mark, which the scrap of paper fortunately
bore, was many years later than the date of the do-
cument written upon it! The jury, thereupon, re-
turned a verdict for the defendant without leaving
the box.
He had a rough, bluff manner that some-
what repelled those who . first made his. acquaintance,
and his habit of open speaking still further added to
this impression; but, on intimate acquaintance, his
kindness of heart, his goodness of disposition, and his
affectionate nature made him generally beloved by
all who were brought closely and intimately into
contact with him. His charities, though unostentati-
ous, were many.
He died on August the 31st, 1862. at his residence
of Elswick, near Petersham, in the sixty-seventh
year of his age, and was buried on the 2nd Septem-
ber, 1862, in the family vault, Devonshire Street
Cemetery.
He married first, on her sixteenth birthday, Jane,
daughter of Alexander Kenneth Mackenzie, Esq.,
manager of the Bank of N.S.W,, Sydney, and by her
(who was born on the 10th January, 1808, at South-
gate, County Middlesex, Etngland, and died 23rd
March 1840, at Elswick, aforesaid) • had issue.


James; born sth December. 1824, in a house
at the corner of King and Elizabeth Streets.
Died on the 18th July, 1906, at “Eccles-
bourne, Double Bay.
His first school was one kept by a Miss
Williams, or Williamson, in Macquarie Street
and among the boys was George' Allen, after-
wards of Toxteth Park. From there he went
to old Mr. Capes, in O’Connell Street, and
from it passed on to his (Mr. Cape’s) son’s
School in King Street.
Shortly after the family went to Elswick,
Mr. Cape was appointed headmaster of the
Sydney College and there the young James
stayed from 1835 to the end of 1839. In the
beginning of the next year a tutor was en-
gaged for the six brothers —a Mr. Walpole, a
clergyman, who used to preach at Ashfield.
In May or June, 1841, James and John
were sent to Mm Forrest’s School, at Camp-
belltown, where the only other boys at the
time were the two Oxleys (cousins), James
Hassell and George Macarthur. In Decem-
ber he left Mr. Forrest’s and on the 27th
January of the year following was approved
by the Judges of the Supreme Court (Dowl-
ing, Burton, and Stephen) and was articled
to"his father for 5 years.
He was admitted as an attorney of the
Supreme Court in 1848 and became a mem-
ber of the firm of Norton and Son afterwards
Norton, Son, and Barker, and later on senior
partner of the firm Norton. Smith and Co.,
and he was regarded as one of the ablest of
the old school of lawyers. On 16th April,
1860, he was sworn in as a Notary Public.
For many years he was a Director of the Aus-
tralian Gas Light Co., and of the North
Shore Gas Company. In 1869 he was elected
Fellow of St. Paul’s College within the Uni-
versity of Sydney. ■
In August, 1874, he was made Trustee of
the Australian Museum and held the post for
32 years.

lic Library and was elected President of the

deceased, and continued to hold that office
until the parks were handed over to the Syd-
ney Municipal Council, in 1904.
1879 ; Appointed member of the Legislative
Council, and from May, 1884, to October,
1885, was Postmaster General in the twen-
tieth Ministry, which was led by Sir Alexander
Stuart. Although, not a frequent speaker
in the Legislative Council, he was always in-
cisive and logical in his utterances, and his
remarks were always, followed with close at-
tention .
1886: Appointed University Solicitor.
In 1890 the degree of L. L. D. was con-
ferred upon him by St. Andrew’s University,
Scotland, in recognition for his services.
He was elected a member of the Royal Geo-
graphical Society in 1891 and for many years
was closely connected with the Linean So-
ciety .
Prom about 1857, and until his death, he
lived at Ecclesbourne, near Sydney, where he
gave a great deal of his time and attention
to the beautiful garden in which all the
trees with one exception, he had planted
himself. He was an enthusiastic botanist and
amongst other hobbies had a fine collection of
Australian books.
He married, first, on Ist June, 1854, Har-
riett Mary Walker (who died 12th Septem-
ber, 1860), and had issue, one son and three
daughters. 2nd, on 31st December, 1862,

John Oxley, born Bth March, 1827, at Syd-
ney. Died at Dubho, N.S.W., 26th Decem-
ber, 1880. Educated by the Rev. —. For-
rest . ,
After leaving school, he, for a. time. work-
ed in his father’s office, but, preferring a
country life, he went on to a station on the
Richmond River.
The hope of making a fortune allured him
to the gold fiields when they were first dis-
covered, but missing the fortune he settled
down at Kanimbla, near Hartley. N.S.W.
In 1862, when the new Police Act passed,
and the force was thoroughly reorganised by


Sir Charles. Gowper, Mr. Norton was ap-
pointed a sub-inspector. In 1862, when the
Gardiner gang of bushrangers held the wes-
tern districts in .terrorism —sticking up mails,
robbing escorts, and shooting policemen—
Mr. INorton was sent to Forbes, and he there
saw some hard service. On one occasion,
when out on duty near Wheogo, accompanied
by a black tracker, O’Meally, Daley, and two
others of the bushrangers surrounded him.
The tracker, after the first shot had been
fired, disappeared, and, after firing all his
ammunition, Mr. Norton was compelled to
surrrender. 'While in the hands of the ras-
cals they tried his courage but he did not
blanch. They placed him against a large box
tree, and fired three shots at him. Two of
the bullets struck the tree about a foot above
his head, and another hit it within a few
inches of his left arm. His capture created
terrible excitement in Forbes, then peopled by
from 30,000 to 40,000 diggers. A public
meeting was held on the camp reserve, and
500 stalwart men volunteered to go to the
rescue. Captain Venn, an adventurous Hun-
garian, who had seen service in 1848. headed
the party, but just as they were about to
start, Mr. Norton arrived in Forbes, having-
been released by the bushrangers. The Go-
vernment then gave him "carte blanche” to
go where he liked in search of the bush-
rangers. He afterwards saw rough sevice on
the gold-field; and was out with Sir Freder-
ick Pottinger on the night when Gardiner, on
his celebrated white horse, escaped from Mrs.
Brown’s house. Sir Frederick and his men
were at the back and Mr. Norton and his
party at the front of the house. Gardiner
passed within ten yards of Sir Frederick,
who had him covered, but as he pulled the
trigger the p’ece missed fire. After leavmg
Forbes, Mr. Norton was for a time in the
Maitland district, under superintendent Mor-
risset, and subsequently he was stationed at
Hartley, where he did good work among the
lawless gangs who infested the Fish River
and Abercrombie. , In ,1866, he was transfer-
fered to Dubbo, and had charge of the force
here till 1872, when he was appointed Police
Magistrate, an office he held up to the time
of his death. He married Emma Newton and
had issue—four sons and five daughters.

brother John with whom he went to try his
luck at the diggings.

and went to the University and then studied

risters in Sydney. Having passed his exam-
inations- well, he was appointed on a Com-
mission to the Islands, and on his return
