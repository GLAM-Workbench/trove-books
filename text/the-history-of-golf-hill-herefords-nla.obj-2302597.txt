To the Hereford Breed Australia,
I dedicate this History.


/fUJfp^ A
It has always been Mrs. Bid die combe's wish that the rr Golf Hill"
Hereford Stud should be bred with a view to improving the Here fords in
Australia, and this brochure has been compiled for the purpose of giving
the Breeders of the future, as near as possible, a true description of past sires
used in the Stud, and the faults and virtues of all families which have done
so much to help build up many Hereford Studs in this country.
It has been my pleasure to have classed and to have been in very close
touch with the "Golf Hill" Stud for the past thirty-five years. During that
time I have paid two visits to England, being commissioned by Mrs. Biddle-
combe to add to "Golf Hill" Stud, females from the best English Hereford
families, and what I considered the most suitable sires to keep the
constitution, thickness of flesh, and general standard, as high as possible.
The Herdsman for the past tivelve years, Mr. Cyril Bolton, has greatly
assisted with the work of producing this brochure, having supplied much of
the data from the records of the Stud.
Since 1943, the breeding herd has been kept down to about fifty head',
consequently only the absolute top four or five females of the various
families have been retained; the pick of the balance are submitted to auction
annually, thus giving breeders the opportunity of securing "Golf Hill" heifers
and cast-for-age cows from all families at market value.

A GREAT HEREFORD STUD
Nearly 50 years ago, at Shelford, 2 5 miles from Geelong (Vic.), in a
picturesque English-like countryside remindful of the meadows of Hereford-
shire, the foundation was laid of a herd of pure white-faced Hereford cattle.
The stud at Golf Hill was the outcome of 30 years' successful breeding of
commercial Hereford cattle, which had descended from some of the earliest
Herefords to come to Victoria.
Over the early years, the breeders of the Golf Hill Stud gathered together
females of some of the elite families of the breed—from Treverder, Mount
Aitken, and Tocal, in Australia, and from Free Town in the English home
County of the breed.

In 1926, when the famous Tocal Stud of Charles Reynolds went to dispersal,
Mr. A. J. Tanner was commissioned by Mrs. Janet Biddlecombe to buy the
pick of the catalogue for Golf Hill.
As Tocal faded out after a history resplendent with outstanding achieve-
ment, Golf Hill Stud in time assumed the mantle of leadership, invigorating,
with its elite Hereford families, the leading herds of the new generations of
Herefords that have multiplied through the six States of the Commonwealth,
and advancing the Hereford breed to the proud position it holds to-day
amongst the beef breeds of the nation.
Perhaps the extent of this influence can best be measured by an analysis of
the records of the 1951 Brisbane Royal Show catalogue. This reveals that the
Champion, Junior Champion, and Reserve Junior Champion bulls, and the
Champion, Reserve Champion, and Reserves Junior Champion females; the
winners of 29 class awards in the Hereford section; the Champion, Junior
Champion, and Reserve Junior Champion bulls, and the winners of eight
class awards in the Poll Hereford section, were either sons, grandsons,
daughters, or granddaughters of a Golf Hill bull or cow. Golf Hill did not
exhibit a single animal at Brisbane —all these animals were bred and exhibited
by leading studs of Queensland, N.S.W., and Victoria.
But this brochure was not written to advertise the Golf Hill Herefords. Its
aim is to place on record, simply and factually, the history of a great Aus-
tralian Hereford Stud, that has left its mark indelibly on the beef herds, and
which to-day is at the apex of its fame and achievement.
Golf Hill heifers.


V
EARLY HISTORY
It was in September, 1837, that the first cattle were bought as the founda-
tion of a commercial herd at Golf Hill. They comprised 100 head, mostly
cows, which had been overlanded from New South Wales by Mr. John
Gardiner.
That they were of outstanding beef type is revealed in early station records,
typical of which were a fat bullock and a fat cow slaughtered for rations in
1838 with dressed weights of 1,300 lb. and 960 lb. respectively. A year or
so later the first large draft of 600 fat cattle were driven to Adelaide, where
they widened the reputation of Golf Hill beef, and set the station firmly on
the road to a destiny as a leader of Hereford stud breeding in Australia, with
an influence more dominant than any herd of its day.
It was during the early 1870's that the first pure Herefords came to Golf
Hill. They were mainly of the old Ercildoune strain, descended from some
of the first Herefords to reach Australia, and with which only high-class
herd and pedigreed bulls had been mated.
STUD FOUNDED
It was not, however, until 1906 that the Golf Hill registered stud was estab-
lished by the purchase of females from Mr. W. H. Yelland, of Treverder,
Newlyn, Victoria. The Marshall Lass family, so widely known as one of
Australia's greatest Hereford families, with representatives in many of the
leading studs, had its origin in this purchase.

About the same time the bull "Monogram" (920) was purchased from Mr.
Frank Reynolds of Tocal. In the same year, the dispersal of the Mount
Aitken stud of the late Mr. H. Beattie provided the opportunity for Golf
Hill to secure several cows and heifers, which to-day have their descendants
in the well-known families of Winifred, Juliet, Novelty, and Silver Queen.
In 1918 six heifers were selected at Tocal for Golf Hill by Mr. Frank
Reynolds. In 1920 Mrs. Biddlecombe purchased for 800 gns. the Tocal first-
prize calf, "Advocate," at the Sydney Royal Show, and prevailed on Mr.
Darcy Reynolds to sell her six heifers to mate with "Advocate," from the
40 heifers which had been retained for the Tocal stud.
While on a visit to England in 1921, Commander and Mrs. Biddlecombe per-
sonally selected the bull "Free Town Commander," and the heifers, "Cora"
and "Pigeon" from the well-known stud of Mr. Percy Bradstock, of Free
Town, Herefordshire. The Cora family is still strongly represented at Golf
Hill, and although there are no longer any descendants of the original
"Pigeon" on Golf Hill, they may still be found breeding outstandingly at
several Victorian studs.
GOLF HILL RESOLUTE
First Champion, United Stud Breeders'
Show (Sydney), 1942.
Sire: Hobartville Wonderlute.
Dam: Oyster Girl 76th (imp.).
Purchased by Messrs. Wilson & McDonald
at a high figure, and the sire of many
Royal Champions, both polled and
horned. Considered the best breeders'
bull in Queensland for many years.


HEIFERS FROM TOCAL
It was in 1926 that Mr. A. J. Tanner selected a number of females on behalf
of Mrs. Biddlecombe, at the Tocal dispersal sale. These cows, in company
with the Tocal heifers previously purchased, founded the Virginia, Lively,
Minerva, Marinda, Best Girl, Harmony, Corisande, Princess Christian, and
Pearly Gates families, all of which have contributed to Golf Hill fame. The
first three families are no longer represented at Golf Hill, but the others are
still consistent breeders of high-class stock.
The nomenclature of new stud families calls for constructive reasoning. It
may not be out of place, therefore, to digress for a moment, to explore the
train of thought that led to the naming of the "Pearly Gates" family. A
heifer calf, delivered by Tocal Last Day 310 th, was full of promise, and was
destined to be the matriarch of a new distinguished family. Captain Biddle-
combe had the inspiration—what could come after "Last Day" for such a
little beauty but "Pearly Gates"? Several generations of her female progeny
have justified the appropriate choice of name.
At the 1928 Sydney Royal Show sales, Mrs. Biddlecombe bought Canning
Chance 2nd, a granddaughter of Broadward Eclipse (imp.), and Main
Chance (imp.). She had won the Brisbane reserve champion ribbon in 1925,
when under two years old. Bulls of this family have proved themselves as
breeders in many studs.
Another Sydney purchase was Myall Doreen 2nd. Though she has no des-
cendants on Golf Hill to-day, her influence was felt over a wide field. When
mated with Hobartville Royal Ringer, she produced the dam of Golf Hill
Diplomat, used for several years at Canning Downs Stud before going to
Bexley Stud, where he sired Bexley Demonstrator, champion bull of Brisbane,
1946-47; reserve champion in Sydney, 1947; and champion in 1948.
OYSTER GIRL IMPORTED
During a visit to England in 1937, Mr. A. J. Tanner selected for Mrs.
Biddlecombe the heifers Oyster Girl 76th, and Orange 14th, from Mr.
Newman, of Lower Wickton. He also purchased the bull Town Observer,
bred by Mr. W. E. Lock, The Town, Ledbury, which at the time of pur-
chase was in use as a stock bull at the Free Town Stud.
The Orange family to-day ranks high in the Golf Hill Stud, from which a
granddaughter of the original cow sold in 1951 for 1,025 gns., while there
is a fine bunch of her females in the stud.
In performance, Oyster Girl 76th overshadowed Orange. She produced re-
markable bulls, which bred-on, to proclaim Oyster Girl 76th as the most

outstanding breeding cow in Australia. Mated to Wonderlute four times, she
produced Golf Hill Resolute (champion in Sydney, 1942, and sold to Wilson
and McDouall, for whom he produced numerous polled and horned cham-
pions and top-price sale animals) ; Golf Hill Beaulute, who, before leaving
Golf Hill, sired five bulls, which sold for an average of 890 gns. These in-
cluded Golf Hill Beta (champion bull at Melbourne, 1946 —sold for 1,500
gns.); Golf Hill Bounder (first under three years, Sydney, 1948 —sold for
1,675 gns.) ; Golf Hill Resolution (unfortunately lost at six months) ; and
Golf Hill Oyster Girl 3rd, whose second calf made the highest price of all
breeds at the Sydney sales in 1949.
The two matings of Oyster Girl 76th with Town Observer (imp.) were not
as productive as her Wonderlute matings, but they resulted in Golf Hill
Oyster Girl, who was not a top bull-breeder, but the dam of very good
females by Wonderlute and Astwood Nascent; and of Golf Hill Bucephalus,
Reserve Junior Champion in Sydney in 1947, sold to Mr. J. Laurie for 2,3 50
gns., and in whose herd he made a great improvement.
To Golf Hill Analyst, Oyster Girl 76th produced Golf Hill Dispenser, First,
Junior, and Reserve Champion bull at Sydney in 1948, where he was sold to
Mr. J. Barber, of Coliban Park, for 2,500 gns. In May, 1951, Mr. Barber held
a sale of surplus stock, and offered the whole 1950 drop of bull calves by Golf
Hill Dispenser. They had been paddock-reared and recently weaned, aged
from 8 to 12 months, and sold to 600 gns. for an average of nearly 300 gns.

The remarkable old cow had her last calf on May 3, 1950. It was a grand
young bull, Golf Hill Goshawk, by Coliban Acklam, and when exhibited at
the Melbourne Royal Show in 1951 he maintained the family tradition by
carrying off the first prize in the 18 months class and the Junior and Male
Championships. He went on to the Sydney Royal Show, 1952, where he again
won the Supreme Championship, and sold for 1,800 gns., the highest price of
the sale. In March, 1951, as the grand old breeder was becoming decrepit,
she was destroyed and buried in the graveyard at Golf Hill, in
company with such famous Herefords of their day as Free Town Director
(imp.), Pertonlute (imp.), Hobartville Starlight, Town Observer (imp.),
and Golf Hill Marinda 29th.
Four females were purchased at the Me Mel dispersal in N.S.W. in 1938,
and two of these cows are still represented in the Treasure and Sunflower
families. A Town Observer daughter of one of these purchases, sold to Mr.
A. E. Cobcroft, of Herbert Park, produced for him the 1947 Sydney
Champion female.

STUD REDUCED IN 1943
The intrusion of the wartime manpower shortage in 1943 necessitated the
reduction of the Golf Hill stud by half, and, on May 14 of that year, the
offering of 48 females at auction proved of great benefit to many breeders,
and widely expanded the influence of Golf Hill blood. Included in the offer-
ings was Golf Hill Marshall Lass 80th, sold to Mr. J. R. Allen, of South
Boorook. Marshall Lass 80th was in calf to Town Observer (imp.), and pro-
duced South Boorook Marshall Lass 3rd, sold by Mr. Allen to Mr. H. R.
Spencer at a high figure, for whom she bred Bon Spiel Royal Highness,
Junior and Reserve Champion bull in Melbourne, and a first prize winner
in Sydney. Joined with Hobartville Fairboy, Golf Hill Marshall Lass 80th
then bred South Boorook Dynamic, Champion bull at Melbourne in 1946.
Mated with Vern Milton (imp. in dam), she produced South Boorook Buck-
ingham, first prize calf and Reserve Junior Champion at Sydney in 1949,
when he was sold for 1,100 gns.

Mrs. N. P. Wright bought her foundation females for the Blandford stud
at this sale. One of her purchases was Golf Hill Marinda 65th, and she pro-
duced Blandford Better Luck, who opened the credit account of the Bland-
ford stud by winning the novice and open classes under 12 months and the
Junior Championship at Sydney, and the first and Junior Championship at
Brisbane the same year. All Mrs. Wright's purchases were good breeders, the
most outstanding being Golf Hill Cora 3 sth. When sold for 210 gns. she
had a young bull calf at foot, and had been mated again to Town Observer
(imp.). The calf, Golf Hill Adventurer, won his class in Brisbane in 1944,
and, maintaining the record of his sire's progeny, topped the sales at 1,000 gns.
A daughter of Golf Hill Cora 35 th produced Blandford Beau, Champion
Poll Hereford bull in Sydney and Brisbane in 1951, when he was sold for
the highest price ever paid for a bull of any breed in Queensland. Another
son of Blandford Cora (H) won the calf class, and, after purchase by Mr.
Williamson, went on to win the Poll Hereford Championship in Melbourne
the same year.
At the dispersal sale under review, Mr. L. J. Weatherly bought Golf Hill
Corisande 37th, a Town Observer (imp.) cow, with a lovely heifer by Wick-
ton Pearl Diver at foot. The calf was Golf Hill Corisande 58th, later the
dam of Colly Creek Volcano, which was the favourite for the Sydney male
championship in 1951, but he picked up a stone on his way to the judging
ring, and paraded lame. Two days later, at the auctions, he was bought by the
Metropolitan Board of Works, Melbourne, for 2,600 gns.

ANNUAL DRAFT SALES
Since the 1943 reducing sale the number of breeders at Golf Hill has been
kept strictly to 50 head, and each year the surplus cows and heifers are dis-
posed of privately. But the consistently successful achievements of breeders
who had previously purchased surplus stock became so great, and the list of
prospective buyers so big, that in 195 0 Mrs. Biddlecombe decided to offer
the surplus females at an annual sale, to be held in Melbourne during Royal
Show week in September, and thus to provide an equal opportunity to all
breeders to buy.
The 1950 sale, which was held on September 25th, was attended by breeders
from all States, and the 11 heifers and 13 cows (including one 16 years old)
went to breeders as distant as Central Queensland and West Australia, at
prices to 1,000 gns., for an Australian record Hereford average of 55 5 gns.
In 1951 the demand for the catalogue of 12 heifers at the annual (Septem-
ber) draft sale was even stronger, when the offerings sold to 1,025 gns., for
a new record average for the breed of 641 gns. The heifers went to Queens-
land, N.S.W., and Victorian breeders. Mr. J. de Little, of Caramut (Vic.),
secured the nucleus of a very high-class stud by taking five of these heifers at
an average of 750 gns.
At the request of the Hereford Society that breeders should contribute to a
draft of heifers for exhibition and sale at the 1951 Perth Royal Show, Golf
Hill sent as its representative Golf Hill Marinda 104 th, which, notwith-
standing the long and arduous train journey, won her class, and the Reserve
Championship, and sold for the West Australian record price at the auctions
at 8 5 0 gns. She met the strong competition of a very outstanding local team
from the Dirk Brook stud of Mr. and Mrs. Fletcher, all sired by a son of
Hobartville Fair Boy and Golf Hill Marinda 77th, which was bred in the
South Boorook stud.

MORE HEIFERS FROM ENGLAND
The most recent infusion of new imported blood was made in 1949, when Mr.
A. J. Tanner selected for Golf Hill, while in England, the bull Tarrington
Jollyman, and four heifers: —
Billingsley Queenie, wonderfully sprung, was sired by Marlow Bandit, a son
of the noted Tarrington Debonair. Her dam was Billingsley Marie, by Free
Town Marquis. Before leaving England she was mated with Tarrington
Meteor, and produced the bull calf Billingsley Shooting Star, which it is
intended to use at Golf Hill with the Town Observer cows.
Town Betty 59th, bred by Exors. W. E. Lock, The Town, Ledbury, was
sired by Town Yeoman, a son of Tarrington Vintage. Her dam, Betty 32nd,
was sired by Pershore Layman, the sire of Town Observer (imp.). She also
produced a bull calf, which was sired by Hartleton Timothy in England.
Her second calf, a very good heifer by Astwood Nascent (imp.), has begun
another Golf Hill family, of which more may be heard some day.
Curly 36th was sired by the great Vern Robert, and bred at The Vern by
Captain R. S. de Quincey. Her dam was Curly 13th, by Vern Nonsuch.
She is a full sister of Vern Boxer, unbeaten in England, where he was first
and champion at Kingston as a calf, and first and champion at the Royal,
and was sold for the second highest price ever paid for a Hereford bull in
England.
Leen Manilla was Junior Champion at Kingston Show in Herefordshire.
Curly 36th was mated in England with Shelderton Airfall, a Tarrington
Debonair bull that topped the sales in Argentina in 1950 at 95,000 pesos
(approximately £6,000 sterling). The result of this mating was a bull calf,
born November 25, 1950. Combining the inheritance of both Vern Robert
and Tarrington Debonair, he is regarded as the future herd sire of Golf Hill.
He has a good head, is evenly fleshed, well sprung in the ribs, and has very


ra
ill ' ftttji
deep hindquarters with a twist almost down to the hocks. He has a fault
that is not objected to by many English breeders, viz., very little white on
one front leg, and one brown hoof. Golf Hill females have been remark-
ably free of this fault, and should be able to overcome it in this case.
At Golf Hill, Curly 36th was joined with Coliban Acklam, whose sire, Vern
Leonardo, was out of Gained Curly 2nd, the foundation cow of the Curly
family at The Vern, and fifth dam in the pedigree of Curly 36th. It was
hoped that this mating would have resulted in a heifer calf, with Curly,
Pertonlute, and Free Town Director from both sire and dam. However, the
calf was a very nicely marked bull, with the hair and skin so typical of all
Acklam progeny.
BILLINSSLEY QUEENIE
Purchased in England for Golf Hill Sfud in 1949.


EARLY SIRES
The first bull used in the Golf Hill stud was Monogram (920), calved
22/8/05. Sire, Mnevis (imp. N.Z.) ; dam, Minerva 3 50th, by Knight
Errant (imp.). Monogram was bred by Mr. F. Reynolds, Tocal, N.S.W.
He was followed by Admiralty (1068), calved 18/9/06. Sire, The Admiral;
dam, Amethyst 288 th, by Colonist (imp.). Admiralty was bred by Mr. H.
Yelland, Newlyn, Victoria.
The third sire was Majestic 3rd (919), calved 27/10/11. He was sired by
Imperial 3rd; dam, Jessamine 2nd, by Figaro 2nd. Majestic was bred by
Mr. J. A. Beattie, Gisborne Park, Victoria.
The first imported sire followed. He was Sheepcote Gladiator (922) (imp.),
calved 8/1/12. Sire, Milton; dam, Ladybird 2nd, by Endale. Sheepcote
Gladiator was bred by Mr. P. Coates, Herefordshire, England. He was a
winner at the Royal Show of England before being purchased for Golf Hill.
Mr. A. J. Tanner recalls that, although he did not see Gladiator, every
female carrying his blood and retained in the stud after the first classing
proved an excellent breeder. He rated him as one of the best breeding bulls
used in the stud. The Sheepcote Hereford at the time was regarded as one
of the leading herds of England, where the sire of Gladiator (Endale) was
first and champion at the Royal Show of England.
In 1919, Tocal Gladiator (918), calved 20/8/17, was purchased from his
breeder, Mr. F. Reynolds, of Tocal. He was a son of Prime Minister (imp.),
from Maritana 128 th, by Wonder (imp.).
The next stock bull at Golf Hill was Advocate (924), calved 25/3/19.
Sire, Broadward Waterloo (imp.); dam, Matchless, by Wonder (imp.). He
was purchased from the Trustees late F. Reynolds privately for 800 gns.
Advocate was shown only once, when he was quite the outstanding bull in
a class of 36 calves. He was a long, level calf, lengthy in the hindquarter,
with a strong head and muzzle, nice coat and colour, good bone, and good
set of legs. Judged on present-day specifications he was a little open in the
boss, and could have been a little closer to the ground. He was very like his
sire, but had a clean nose, whereas his sire had two rather large black
blotches as blemish. None of his stock was ever exhibited, but his females
were excellent breeders.
He was followed by Beresford (921) (imp. N.Z.), calved 5/8/18. Beres-
ford was sired by Mansel Jack Tar (imp.), from Park Amethyst 12th, by


Park Royal, and was bred by Mr. F. Moore, at Bushey Park, New Zealand.
He was a round-barrelled, good-topped bull, with a grand head, nice tail
setting, and strong bone. His coat, however, was rather dark and strong, and
he stood a little high on the leg. His sire, Mansell Jack Tar, was a son of
Starlight, the greatest Hereford breeding bull of his day, and his dam was
one of the best breeders on Bushey Park, and certainly the best breeding
family in New Zealand at the time. None of his stock was exhibited, but his
females bred consistently.
Free Town Commander (imp.), 40965, calved 7/2/21, was the next sire. He
was sired by Aldersend Napier, from Charity 2nd, by Test Time, and was
bred by Mr. P. E. Bradstock, of Free Town, Herefordshire. Free Town
Commander was selected in England by the late Commander Biddlecombe,
and was exhibited only once in Melbourne, where he won the champion-
ship in 1924, and once in Sydney, when he secured first prize in the aged
bull class. He was a very big, long bull, with a good head and muzzle, very
deep in his twist, and well marked. He was a bull of great substance and
constitution, but had straight hair, rather coarse in his fleshing, and lacked
quality. His sire was first and champion at the R.A.S., England, and was
regarded as one of the best breeding bulls of that time.
The next sire was Tocal Tewkesbury (1357), calved 4/3/24, sired by
Prince Richard, ex Constance 90th, by Harmonist, and bred by the Estate
late F. Reynolds. He was first in a very strong class under 12 months in
Sydney, and first and champion in Melbourne in 1925 and 1926. A very
thick-fleshed, good quality bull, with a nice quality coat and good head, he
nevertheless lacked character, and was a difficult bull to breed, as his calves
showed a lot of white. He was rather small, and light-boned, and a better
show bull than a breeder.

HOBARTVILLE ROYAL RINGER
INFLUENCE OF ROYAL RINGER
The next sire, Hobartville Royal Ringer (1413), calved 22/10/24,
was a son of Eyton Meddler (imp.), from Wakeful 2nd, by Eaton Con-
queror (imp.). Mr. Tanner, in his memoirs, describes him as not only one
of the best breeding bulls that ever went to Golf Hill, but as one of the best
breeders ever produced at Hobartville. He was a very outstanding bull when
he won the Sydney championship, from the under-18-months class, in 1926,
and the first and championship at Melbourne the following year.
Hobartville Royal Ringer had character, vitality, constitution, beautiful
fleshing, and was smooth, well marked, and very thick through the heart and
over the chine. He had a strong head and muzzle, which, however, could
have been a little shorter, a grand hindquarter, with plenty of length, and
was well-filled in the lower thighs and twist.
Hobartville Royal Ringer was purchased by Mrs. Biddlecombe for 1,050
gns. after winning the Sydney Royal championship in 1926. He was ex-
hibited by Mrs. Biddlecombe at Melbourne Royal in 1927, when he again
won first and champion honours. From 1929 to 193 5 his breeding record
proclaimed him one of the best sires ever bred in Australia.
He sired no less than four champions, and his stock realised more than
10,000 gns., while some of the best breeding families started by him are
still prominent in the stud.


He was a good sire of bulls, but the big, wide, roomy females which he left
at Golf Hill were to a great extent the factor that gave Free Town Direc-
tor the opportunity to prove himself the outstanding sire of Australia, and
to give Golf Hill the biggest impetus in its history.
The sire of Hobartville Royal Ringer, Eyton Meddler (imp.), was rated by
many English breeders as the best bull to come to Australia. Eyton Meddler
won the junior championship at the English Royal, where his grand head,
fleshing, faultless ribbing, and deep hindquarters made a remarkable im-
pression. As a breeder he was, however, inclined to get some black, which
he no doubt inherited from his dam, Eyton Satire. Royal Ringer's dam,
Wakeful 2nd, was reserve champion in Sydney, and the outstanding breed-
ing cow at Hobartville, where she died at 17 years old, after producing
many winners.
The most serious criticism that could be levelled at Royal Ringer was a
strain of temperament, which was inherited by some of his females. At 12
years old, he was sold to Mr. P. A. Wright, of Wallamumbi, in fulfilment of
a promise made that he could have first offer of him if ever he should be sold.
ARRIVAL OF FREE TOWN DIRECTOR
It was at this point that the great sire, Free Town Director, came into the
limelight, to exert the greatest influence on the Herefords in Australia. To-
day, long after his death, his fame persists as leading studs continue to line-
breed to him, and to add stature to his prestige. At Ennisview, in Queens-
land, many of the animals have up to six crosses of Free Town Director in
their pedigrees. In one year, bulls sired by him won the championships in
every Royal Show in Australia.
Free Town Director (imp.), 49237, was sired by Crossways Saphlute,
from Barbara 2nd, by Aldersend Napier, and was bred by Mr. P. E.
Bradstock, of Free Town. He was selected for Mrs. Biddlecombe by the
late E. Craig Tanner, of Eyton-on Severn. He was not a big bull, but was
full of quality, with his legs well outside him. His wide forehead, clean
muzzle, nice quality, curly coat, wide, white mane, gave him a gay appear-
ance. He was well filled in the twist and lower thighs; a lovely claret-red,
with the silkiest coat that proclaimed exceptional quality. On the contra
side, he was a little light over his chine, and could have been better at the
back of the shoulder; in addition, he was inclined to be pigeon-toed. He
even transmitted some of these faults to some of his stock, but mated with

the wide, good-legged Royal Ringer females, the faults were counteracted,
and the progeny invariably outstanding.
During his career, from 1933 to 1940, he sired no less than 14 champions,
6 reserve champions, and 44 first prize winners. Bulls by him sold to 760
gns., and females to 460 gns. at public auction, and high prices were often
refused for many of his stock privately.
Wickton President 2nd (imp.), 52674, then joined the stud. He was sired
by Crossways Emeralute, from Pink Pansy. He was a twin to a brother sold
to Argentina, where he proved a very successful sire. Wickton President
2nd was twice a first prize winner at the R.A.S., England, and got a number
of winners before leaving. He was selected by the late E. Craig Tanner, but
unfortunately was not made the best use of at Golf Hill. He had a grand
head and eye, strong back, and was deep, with a good underline, a nice
colour, well marked, and good on his legs. He was inclined to be tempera-
mental, and his calves were difficult to handle, but he left some very good
breeders. He was ultimately sold to Mr. J. H. White, of Timor, for whom
he got a number of winners at Sydney Royal, and some grand breeders.

Hobartville Wonderlute (3145), calved 26/11/35, sired by Westhide
Cameronian (imp.), from Shraden Rarity 10th (imp.), by Pertonlute,
followed Wickton President 2nd. His dam was junior champion at the
R.A.S. of England, and champion female at Sydney in 1936. Wonderlute was
selected by Mr. A. J. Tanner as a calf when six months old, and delivery
taken at nine months. He was a bull of great scale, and got very big, strong,
stock. His females were particularly good breeders, and no less than 15
breeders in the stud to-day were sired by him. His head was good, with a nice
neck, though he could have been a little broader in the muzzle. He had plenty
of length, was good in the thigh and legs, carried a rich quality curly coat of
the ideal colour. On the contra side he was lacking somewhat in flesh on the
back, was rather round in the horn, and a little light in the gaskin.
He produced many winners at the Royal Shows and the United Stud Beef
Cattle Breeders' Association Shows. His sons were consistently among the
best sellers—many head some of the best studs in New South Wales. At the
1944 Sydney Exhibition, only one of his sons was exhibited, and sold for 880
guineas, whilst at the 1945 Sydney Exhibition, another son, Golf Hill Beau-
lute, although unable to go before the judge owing to a leg injury, was sold
privately to "Colly Creek" Stud for 2,000 guineas. Another son, Golf Hill
Resolute, was the sire of the junior champion at the 1946 Brisbane Show,
whilst the male and female champions of the poll section were also sired by
him. At the Melbourne Royal, 1946, a daughter was champion female, and
at the Sydney Royal, 1947, his son, Golf Hill Brigadier (first under 21

months), was sold for 1,8 50 guineas, second top price of the Sales for all
breeds. At the 1947 Melbourne Royal, a daughter was champion female.
Golf Hill Centaur was second in the under two years old class at the 1948
Sydney Show, and sold at auction for 470 guineas.
Wonderlute—at 13 years old—ended his days at the Bexley stud in N.S.W.
During his career at Golf Hill he sired 120 bulls, sold for an average of
£194, and 103 females sold for an average of £125, and an aggregate return
of more than £36,000.
His dam was one of the most attractive cows ever sent to Australia, thick,
level, wide and deep; with a beautiful head, hindquarters set low to the
ground, and nicely marked.

Golf Hill Vulcan and Golf Hill Ringleader were twins. Sire, Hobartville Starlight; dam, Golf Hill
Winifred 33rd. They were one month old when this picture was taken. Vulcan was Champion in
Sydney fh 1938 and 1939, and when shown in 1938, his twin brother was second to him in the class.
Hobartville Starlight, the five times (1930-1-2-3-5) Sydney champion son
of Eaton Conqueror (imp.), was also lightly used at Golf Hill as an aged bull.
His stock, also, were rather on the leg, and required too much time to de-
velop, rather like himself in this respect. His outstanding sons were the
twin brothers Vulcan and Ringleader, which were first and second in the
same class in Sydney in 193 8. Vulcan was twice champion at Sydney, where
he was sold at a high figure to Mr. E. E. D. White, of Woodlands, Q., in which
herd his sons and daughters made a high reputation for the stud.
Pertonlute (imp.) was also lightly used at Golf Hill as an aged bull, and got
17 calves. He was one of the best quality-fleshed bulls to come to Australia,
and got females of high order. His bulls, though well-fleshed, were a little
light in the bone, and weak in the head, while, as calves, his stock appeared
leggy, and light in the gaskin, though they invariably came down with age.

Golf Hill Absolute (3872), calved 14/8/3 8, sired by Pertonlute, from Golf
Hill Cora 22nd, by Free Town Director (imp.), was lightly used in the Golf
Hill stud before being sold to Mr. Frank Snow, of Cuppacumbalong. Two
of his sons, Golf Hill Envoy and Sentinel 2nd, sired many Royal winners,
including the Sydney champion Timor Lively 7th. Golf Hill Absolute was
considered the best son of Pertonlute (imp.) calved in Australia. He was very
smooth and deeply fleshed, a good breeder's head and eye, nice turned-down
natural horns, very thick in his twist and lower thighs, but had a slight
droop in his rump. He left some grand females at Golf Hill.

GOLF HILL BUCEPHALUS—23/12/45. First under 15 months, R.A.S., Sydney, 1947. Sire, Town
Observer (imp.); dam, Oyster Girl 76th (imp.). Sold for 2,350 gns. to Mr. J. N. Laurie.
TOWN OBSERVER COMES TO GOLF HILL
In 1937 Mr. A. J. Tanner visited England, with the object of selecting a
suitable sire to follow Free Town Director and Wonderlute at Golf Hill.

The selection was Town Observer (imp.), 62367, sired by Pershore Lay-
man, from Begonia 6th, whose sire was Democrat of Pitsford. He was bred
by Mr. W. E. Lock, of The Town, Ledbury, Herefordshire, where Mr.
Tanner saw his sire, also his dam and grand-dam, which he considered the
two best females in the stud. Pershore Layman, in spite of being an old


bull, impressed for his great length, grand head, and stylish parade. Town
Observer, who was purchased from Mr. Percy Bradstock, was a deep, rich
red in colour, with a long, curly coat, just a little on the strong side. He was
very good over the chine and fore flanks, and had a strong top and under-
line, with a good hindquarter. He was coupled up very short from the last
rib to the hip, a little shallow in the underjaw, and a shade light in the
bone.
Town Observer was selected particularly for his great width over the chine,
to strengthen factors for which both Director and Wonderlute were not
outstanding. All his stock were very good-topped cattle, though a few
lacked width of muzzle and jaw, and some could have been heavier in the
bone. They were all rich-coloured, well-marked individuals. They not only
secured high show honours, top averages and individual sales, but produced
sons and daughters in other studs that repeated their successes. The 23
breeders by Town Observer still in the Golf Hill stud have been described
by overseas and Australian Hereford breeders, visiting Golf Hill, as prob-
ably the best lot of females by one sire they had ever seen. In his ten years'
service at Golf Hill, Town Observer produced sons and daughters that sold
for an aggregate of £43,000.
At the Sydney Exhibition, 1942, a son of Town Observer, Golf Hill Call Boy,
gained first prize under 12 months and junior champion, beating Golf Hill
Resolute, first under 18 months and champion bull. At the 1943 Sydney
Exhibition the only three bulls exhibited by Town Observer in the class
under 12 months gained second, third and fourth, and sold at 450 guineas,
300 guineas, and 225 guineas.
In Sydney, 1944, another son of this bull, Golf Hill Coronach, gained first
prize in the calf class, and sold for the record price of 1,300 guineas for a
bull under 12 months. Another of his sons sold for 950 guineas, and four of
them averaged 747 guineas at auction.
At the Brisbane Royal National, 1944, Golf Hill Adventurer, by Town
Observer, was second in a very strong class of 42 head, and was sold for
1,000 guineas at auction to Mr. Jas. Sparkes. One of his daughters, Golf
Hill Best Girl 43rd, was first in her class and reserve junior champion at
Sydney Exhibition, 1945. At the 1945 Sydney Sales, five bulls by Town
Observer were sold at an average of 322 guineas, selling to 550 guineas. A
daughter, Golf Hill Silver Queen 47th, was second to the champion in the
under 18 months class, Sydney Exhibition, 1946, and at the Sales six bulls by
him averaged over £271, whilst two daughters averaged 260 guineas.


At the Melbourne Royal, 1946, a son, Golf Hill Adventurous, was first
under two years and reserve champion, and secured top price for the breed
at auction. Another son was third in the calf class, whilst a daughter, Golf
Hill Corisande 66th, was first under 15 months.
At the 1947 Sydney Royal his progeny were again to the fore: Golf Hill
Bystander, fourth under 21 months; Golf Hill Belligerent, fifth under 18
months (sold for 375 guineas) in a class of 52 entries; Golf Hill Bucephalus,
first under 15 months (topping the Sales for all breeds, being sold for 2,3 50
guineas to Mr. J. N. Laurie, Rawdon Vale) ; and Golf Hill Best Girl 43rd
was second under three years, whilst two daughters, Golf Hill Treasure 9th
and Golf Hill Harmony 21st, sold for 330 guineas and 310 guineas
respectively.
At Melbourne Royal, 1947, two sons, Colossus and Castaway, were first in
the under 15 months and under 12 months classes, respectively. In 1948
three sons of Town Observer (imp.) were the sires of the junior champion
and highest priced bull of all breeds at Brisbane, junior and reserve
champion and highest priced bull of all breeds, Sydney; champion bull
and highest priced bull of all breeds, Melbourne. The junior champion bull
at Melbourne was from a daughter of Town Observer.
At Sydney, in 1949, Golf Hill Derwent, a son, won first prize for bull under
15 months, and three daughters won second prize in the under two years, 21
months and 18 months classes. Town Observer (imp.), headed the averages
for bulls by one sire sold at the 1949 Sydney Sales, when three of his sons
sold for an average of 1,086 guineas, Golf Hill Deputy selling for the
highest price of all breeds, viz., 1,775 guineas. At the Golf Hill Sale, held in
Dalgety's Yards, in Melbourne, eight females by Town Observer averaged
577 guineas (mostly heifers), and one 18-months-old made 950 guineas.


Coliban Acklam (6963), calved August, 1945, was the next sire at Golf
Hill. He was sired by Vern Leonardo (imp.), from Eyton Princess 3rd
(imp.), and was purchased at 9 months old from his breeder, Mr. J.
Barber, of Coliban Park. He was not a big bull, but one of the deepest fleshed
and smoothest used at Golf Hill. His stock could be readily identified by their
low setting, quality skins, and mellow fleshing. Some of his stock are
inclined, however, to fall away a little at the pin bones and tail-head,
although he himself is very well set-up in the hindquarters. He has not
been heavily used, but is already the sire of one champion, one reserve
champion, four junior champions, and two reserve junior champions. His
bull calves have sold to 1,400 gns., and heifers to 850 gns. In addition to
the 33 head sired by him which have been sold, for an average of 508 gns.,
there are 14 females by him retained in the stud.
His dam was the pick of the Eyton heifers of her year. All his calves are
excellent doers.
Coliban Acklam's first three calves sold averaged
806 guineas at Sydney, 1949. At Melbourne,
two of his sons won prizes—Golf Hill Enchanter,
first under 15 months and junior champion, and
Golf Hill Embassy, first under 12 months. A
daughter by him, Golf Hill Novelty, was first
under 18 months and junior champion; and Golf
Hill Pearly Gates won first prize for heifer in
the 6 to 12 months old class. At Sydney, 1950,
three of his sons again won prizes, and at the
Golf Hill Sale, held in Dalgety's Sale Yards,
Melbourne, three females by him averaged 55 8
guineas, top price being 750 guineas. At the 1952
R.A.S. Show, Sydney, two of his sons won the
Championship and Junior Championship, Golf

Astwood Nascent (imp.), 75398, calved August, 1945, arrived at Golf Hill
about the same time as the last-mentioned bull. He was sired by Astwood
Kismet, from Astwood Perfecta 2nd, by Astwood Dandy, and was bred by
Edward Webb and Sons Ltd., of Stourbridge, Worcs. He was selected in
England by Mr. Raymond Reynolds, of Hobartville, after winning the
championship at the Shropshire and West Midland Show. He has a very
good head, well-turned flat horn, short legs of very heavy bone, and is
exceptionally good in the lower thighs and twist. He is perhaps a little high
in the shoulders, and could have his pin-bones set a little higher and wider.
His heifer calves have been particularly outstanding, but the first two crops
of bull calves were a little flat in the rib, and narrow over the shoulder. The
calves in feed and now dropping do not show this fault, and one, Ardno
Royal Ascent, purchased in utero, and shown by Mr. R. L. McEachern, won
the reserve championship at the 1951 Melbourne Royal Show. The demand
for his heifers has been very strong, two reaching the 1,000 gns. bid. Ten
heifers by him already sold have made the remarkable average of 795 gns.,
while his 15 bulls have averaged 683 gns.
The first three bulls sired by this bull, shown at Sydney Royal Show, 1950,
averaged £954, and one of them was awarded first prize in the under 21
months old class, while another was fourth in under 15 months class. A
daughter won third prize under 12 months. At the R.A.S. Show, Sydney,
1952, two of his daughters were first in their classes, and one was second.
A son, a very young bull calf, giving away a lot of age, was third in a strong
class and sold for 1,400 guineas. At a sale of Golf Hill females in Dalgety's
Sale Yards, Melbourne, three heifers by him averaged 892 guineas, Golf Hill
Harmony 24th sold for 800 guineas to Fairymead Sugar Co. Ltd., Golf Hill
Oyster Girl 7th sold for 1,000 guineas to Clark Fairview Estate, and Golf
Hill Winifred 49th went to S. J. Field Pty. Ltd., for 875 guineas.
Two imported-in-utero bulls by Astwood Nascent have been sold for over
1,000 gns., each from Hobartville and South Boorook studs, respectively.
There are some exceptionally good young cows and heifers retained in the
Golf Hill stud, that show great promise.

TARRINGTON JOLLYMAN
Latest arrival at Golf Hill was
Tarrington Jollyman (imp.), calved
23/8/48, sired by Vern Talisman (a
son of Vern Robert), from Jewel, by
Tarrington Broadside. He was bred by
the late Mr. H. R. Griffiths, of Little
Tarrington, Hereford, and was selected
by Mr. A. J. Tanner for Mrs. Biddle-
combe when in England in 1949.
Mr. A. J. Tanner and Tarrington Jollyman in
the apple orchard at Tarrington.
After visiting all the Hereford studs, inspecting all the bulls on offer at the
Royal Show, and at Kington and Bosbury Shows, Mr. Tanner rated
Tarrington Jollyman the most suitable bull he had seen. He was reared
entirely on his mother, a cow which Mr. Tanner considered the best cow he
saw in England. Her calf, Jollyman, was calved ten days too early for her
to be exhibited in the cow and calf class at the Royal. Mr. Tanner, who
judged at the 1949 Royal, said that had she paraded, he certainly would have
placed her on top. She was a grand-headed cow, with a wide muzzle, a
grand back rib, very smooth, with a leg at each corner, a great milker, a
tremendous depth of flesh, and of ideal colour.
Tarrington Jollyman is shown with his dam at
Tarrington. In the background is his breeder,
the late Mr. Harry Griffiths.
Vern Talisman, the sire of Jollyman,
was considered the best son of Vern
Robert. He is a very gay bull, with a
lot of style, and a great outlook. He is
beautifully fleshed all over, with plenty
of bone, and is the best lower-thighed
bull ever used on Golf Hill. He is well
marked, has a good white mane, with a
small white outcrop in the middle of
his back, but no other broken mark-
ings. He could be a little deeper in the
flanks, but has one of those round barrels inclined to give that impression
His first crop of calves are all very good-headed, and are letting down at an
early age. One or two have a little too much white, but as they are
descended from Director cows with white backs, the influence may not be

from Jollyman. As the oldest of his stock were calved at the end of April,

c. 30/9/03, by Figaro 2nd; dam, Countess 9th, by Figaro (imp.); purchased at the Mt.
Aitken dispersal sale in 1906. The females have never been shown extensively, but the
bulls have turned out to be breeders of prize-winning stock, two notable examples being
Vulcan as a sire in Queensland, and Artist in the Ardno stud of McEachern Bros., in
Victoria, for whom he has sired many prize-winners and a wonderful even lot of females.
The few females that have been shown are:—

The JULIET family was founded on another of the original purchases at the Mt. Aitken
dispersal sale in 1906. This cow was Juliet, c. 14/7/03. Sire, Figaro (imp.); dam, Ugena.
They have not been top breeders, and there is only one cow of the family now in the
stud. This is Golf Hill Juliet 62nd, by Hobartville Wonderlute. She is a half sister to Golf
Hill Juliet 61st, the Golf Hill Absolute cow that has bred so well in the South Boorook
stud, being the dam of South Boorook Bradford, and grand dam of South Boorook
Stafford, sold for 1,150 gns.
A few heifers were shown and won:—

The SILVER QUEENS are also descended from one of the original Beattie sale purchases,
Silver Queen 2nd. Sire, Royal Windsor; dam, Beatrix 2nd, by Figaro (imp.). They have
never been strongly represented, but the present two members are well deserving of their
place in the stud. They are Golf Hill Silver Queen 43rd, by Hobartville Wonderlute,
who has at foot a very good bull calf by Astwood Nascent. This calf is a full brother to
Golf Hill Financier, fourth under 18 months, Sydney, and sold for 1,150 gns. The cow is
also the dam of:—Silver Queen 47th, second, Sydney, 1946, and after sale to Mr. D.
Andrews won for him first prize at Melbourne; Baron, third, Melbourne, 1947; Silver
Queen 48th, sold to Mr. R. L. McEachern for 250 gns.; and the other present member
of the family, Golf Hill Silver Queen 49th, by Coliban Acklam.


The CORISANDE family was founded on fwo full sisters, Tocal Corisande 14th, purchased
at the Sydney Royal, where she had won her class; and Tocal Corisande 16th, bought at
the dispersal of the Tocal stud in 1926. These cows were sired by Lord Palmerston (imp.),
out of Tocal Corisande 9th, by Broadward Waterloo (imp.). They have both bred equally
well, and there are descendants of the two cows in about equal proportions in this, the
most numerous and probably the best breeding family in the stud. Although of more
recent origin than some of the other families, they have been very prolific, the females
now having almost reached the century, Corisande 98th being registered in November,
1951. In addition to winning many prizes, the bulls have proved very prepotent sires of
winners at several Royal Shows.

With 15 breeding cows, three in-calf heifers, and eight younger heifers, the family comprises about a
quarter of the total strength of the stud, and as they seem to nick equally well with almost any bull,
the Corisandes look like holding their position for some time. The present cows and heifers are: —
