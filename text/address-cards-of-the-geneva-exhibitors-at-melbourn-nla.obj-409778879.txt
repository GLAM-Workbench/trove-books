GENEVA WATCHES.
The manufacture of watches was de-
finitively established at Geneva about
the year 1587.
Until the end of the 17th century the
greater number of watchmakers made
both the movements and the cases. All
the work was done by hand with a few
very simple tools. In the 18th and 19th
centuries, the work became more and more
divided amongst special workmen, and
the tools, which were being brought to
great perfection, became special machines
for executing more or less completely the
required work.
In 1839, consequently much before the
method was known and adopted in any
Atziss j/f/OgO&Q


other country , the making by machinery
of all the parts of a watch was introduced
into Geneva by two Genevese watchma-
kers. Some years later, a house in Geneva
introduced the making by machinery of
keyless, or selfwinding watches, which
opened a new era in our national industry.
This progress has continued without the
least abatement, and every day has brought
some new invention or improvement
which made the Geneva watchmaking
take such an important place in the
commercial world.
Among watchmakers, a Geneva watch
means one that a clever and conscientious
maker can warrant in every respect: this
is the distinctive character of Geneva
watchmaking. Another character of our
watch manufacture, is its universality.
By employing machinery whenever it
can perform the work better and cheaper


than the hand, they make at Geneva
(from the raw metal up to completion)
fine watches of all kinds and all prices,
from the simplest to the most complicated
time piece.
All the various parts which compose
our movements are constructed upon
strictly uniform patterns and measures,
so that any one of these parts may be
taken from one watch and readjusted to
another of the same description 5 this
system has lately received the name of
“ interchangeability. ”
At all the exhibitions that have been
held, every one has admired the fine
execution of the movements in the rough
and trainworks made in the workshops
of Geneva, and it is well known that a
considerable number of these movements
entirely finished and regulated, are ex-
ported to foreign countries and more


especially to the United States. In this
latter country, the watch dealers keep a
complete assortment of our movements
without cases, which they mount, when
required, according to the price, taste, or
fancy of the purchaser. By this plan,
they economise the import duty on the
whole value of the watch-cases.
When there is a question of cases that
cannot be made in that country on
sufficiently advantageous conditions, the
dealers, without being obliged to keep a
costly assortment of our watches already
cased, have a small number in stock, and
they transport from one case to another
the required movement, according to the
taste of the customer. This change is
effected without the least difficulty for
our cases are generally mounted on fixed
types (blocks of steel or brass), and
according to uniform diameters and


heights adopted by each manufacturer.
The case-maker can thus do his work
even without having seen the movement
for which he is commissioned to make
the case.
The Genevese manufacture of watch-
cases enjoys a justly merited reputation;
it supplies not only the requirements of
our manufacturers, hut also those of
other watchmaking localities.
From the Geneva workshops of en-
graving, chasing, enamelling, painting,
and jewelling, emanate those exquisite
decorations which give an inimitable
stamp to the Geneva watches. European
and American watchmakers apply to
these workshops every time they desire
elegant decorations executed on advan-
tageous conditions, both as regards work-
manship and price.
The regulating of watches has always


been an object of particular attention in
Geneva; numerous chronometers are de-
posited every year at the Astronomical
Observatory, and leave that establishment
with certificates stating the fate of these
watches, and showing constant improve-
ment in this branch of our manufacture.
JEWELRY.
Geneva Jewelry has enjoyed for the
last three centuries a merited reputation
for beauty of design and excellence of
workmanship. Painting on enamel and
fine jewelry have contributed largely to
this reputation. The manufacture of gold
watch-chains, which was introduced into
our country comparatively recently, has
lately become an important branch of
industry at Geneva. Our manufacturers
make a considerable use of mechanical


processes, and have brought their
establishments to a point of perfection
which enables them to compete success-
fully with other countries, and to export
their articles to all parts of the world.
The Geneva jewels and chains are ap-
preciated for their fine workmanship,
their elegant designs, their rich appear-
ance and the genuineness of their gold
standard and it may be asserted without
fear of contradiction, that the Genevese
manufacturer has always upheld his
ancient reputation for honesty. A number
of large firms in Geneva, employing many
workmen, are especially occupied in the
making of watch-chains.
There are at present in this city 72
manufacturers of Jewelry, employing
600 men and women.
Among the industries connected with
the manufacture of jewelry, there are


more than 200 workshops for engraving,
painting, enamelling, &c.; two establish-
ments for cutting diamonds, four for the
founding and sale of gold, and one for
the preparation of gold dust. These va-
rious workshops employ about 800 per-
sons.
The yearly production of jewelry in
Geneva for exportation amounts to
twenty millions of francs.
To give an idea of the importance of
the Genevese industry connected with
precious metals, we furnish below the
delivery, of a single firm engaged in the
founding and sale of gold and silver,
during the last eighteen months:
10,020 kilogrammes of gold.
13,815 kilogrammes of silver.
236,385 gold plates.
9,002 metres of gold frames for watch-oases.
26,081 metres of gold rims for watch-cases.


MUSICAL BOXES.
Undoubtedly the cradle of Musical
Boxes is Geneva, which for more than a
century, has held the first place for this
fabrication.
It is there that the musical box has
undergone a thousand transformations
and improvements, and where now instru-
ments are made that give all varieties
cf tone and expression, and reproduce
music in a manner that composers would
have wished given to their works.
This progress is most striking in the
different instruments called Mandoline,
Mandoline hasse Picolo, Quatuor, Piano
Forte, Eolian Harp , Harp Picolo, Harp
Tremolo, Concerto, Harmonophoneor Flute,
&c.


Simultaneously with the improvement
in the character of the music, the inventive
genius of Gleneva Manufacturers pro-
duced a number of accessories, which add
greatly to the etfect and grace of the
music. To mention only a few of them:
Bells with Drums and Castanet accom-
paniment well complete this class of
boxes; this action combined with Flute
accompaniment {or Celestial Voices ) has
given rise to the name of Orchestre, an
instrument which can be clearly heard
in a spacious hall, and which produces
the same brilliant effect as a musical
band. The Zither gives a great variety
of sound. It can be adjusted to any other
musical instrument, and so sensibly
modifies the tone, that it appears to give
the sound of two instruments in one.
The Zither has been an auxiliary for the
production of several new kinds of musical


boxes, which are remarkable for the low
price at which they may be bought.
The mechanical part did not remain in
the rear. After having succeeded in adjust-
ing 36 airs to one cylinder, the keen re-
searches of the manufacturers discovered
a system which permits of a change of
cylinder, and by this means, they can
produce an unlimited number of airs.
Their efforts were also directed to other
points, and always with success. For
instance, to perform a whole operatic
overture without making any stop what-
ever; to obtain a constant movement for
an hour and a half, without the necessity
of winding up the spring during that
time; to perform any air wished for and
to indicate the same, without going
through the whole rotation, &c.
Independently of all these improve-
ments (which are the production of serious


study) the manufacture of musical fancy
articles has greatly developed, and has
led to the production of a thousand useful
and fancy articles, with musical adjust-
ment, which are an unfailing source of
surprise and amusement to those who
seek them.
In conclusion, Geneva has acquired in
the manufacture of musical boxes, as
well as of good watches and jewelry, a
well merited reputation. Everybody
likes music, but everybody is not a
musician; therefore all honour is due to
the musical box, which is not only a com-
pensation to those who cannot perform
themselves, but also, owing to con-
stant improvements, is able to keep
itself up to the level of the most difficult
and delicate musical taste.
