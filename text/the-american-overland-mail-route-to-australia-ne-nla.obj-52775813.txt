SPECIAL NOTICE.
Tne information given in the following pages in
regard to the Rates, Conditions, Times of Departure, &e.,
of travel by Railway and Steamship Lines, connecting
with or forming part of the American Overland Route,
has been carefully compiled from the official publi-
cations of the several Companies; but the Agents are
not responsible for delay, detention, loss or injury,
which may result from any inaccuracy in this
compilation.


THE American Overland Eoute—completed by the opening of
the Union and Central Pacific Eailways in 1869—connects
the Steamship lines of the Atlantic with those of the Pacific
Ocean, and forms the most direct thoroughfare between Great
Britain and her colonies in Australia and New Zealand.
On the Atlantic, twenty-eight different lines of Steamers afford
a choice of as many weekly departures from Great Britain and
the Continent of Europe to the United States and Canada.
On the American Continent there are daily express trains on
the various Eailway lines from New York, Boston, Philadelphia,
Baltimore, and Quebec, converging at Omaha, and there con-
necting with the Union Pacific and Central Pacific Eailways to
San Francisco.
A Postal Contract has been entered into by the Pacific Mail
Steamship Company of New York for the conveyance of Her
Majesty’s mails between San Francisco and the colonies of New
South Wales and New Zealand for a period of eight years from
November, 1875.
The route of the Mail service, and the times appointed for the
departure and arrival of the Mails, are shown in the accompanying
map and time tables.
The vessels to be employed have been built specially for this
service. They range from 3,000 to 3,500 tons register, and are
of unusual strength and power. The passenger accommodation
is of the highest order—spacious, well ventilated, and fitted with
every appliance for safety and comfort.
Under arrangement with the principal Atlantic Steamship Lines
and American Eailways, through tickets at a reduced rate are
issued by the London Agents to all Australian and New Zealand
ports, as well as to Honolulu, Fiji, and New Caledonia.
First-class passengers holding these tickets have the privilege
of chosing their own route by Eailway from New York to San
Francisco, and of breaking and resuming the journey at pleasure
at any station on the route, for a period of six months from the
date of issue.
They are also entitled to an extra allowance of luggage, and to
a priority in choice of berths on the Trans-Pacific steamships
from San Francisco.
Passengers by the New York Central and Erie Eailways go in
full view of Niagara Falls and other points of great interest,
stopping, if they wish to do so.

United States and Canasian Connections.
From the Handbook of the Union and Centeal Pacific Railways.
rTTHE choice of routes from the Atlantic seaport cities to Omaha, the Eastern
terminus of the Pacific Railway, will be determined usually by considerations
of economy of time, or of opportunities afforded to visit particular points by the
way. The difference in fares by the numerous lines is inconsiderable. For
ordinary purposes, the railway maps will furnish sufficient indications as to the
course of the principal lines. There are, however, various combinations in
running arrangements between a number of the companies, which enable the
leisurely traveller to vary his course and visit many points of interest without
incurring greater expense than by taking a direct through route. The following
list includes the main routes connecting with the Pacific Railway from Atlantic
ports, and shows also the time and distance between principal points. It is to be
understood, of course, that “through” drawing-room and sleeping cars are
provided on these lines on payment of the additional fare.
