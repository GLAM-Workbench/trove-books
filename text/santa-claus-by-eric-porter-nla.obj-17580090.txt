Far away, up in the sky, lives Santa Claus. His
castle is built on the biggest, white fluffy cloud
there is. High above it the sun always shines,
even in the depth of winter, for Old Father Sun
loves to smile at Santa as he prepares surprises for
boys and girls all over the world.
Santa's home is built of rich brown stone; from
the tall chimneys smoke curls upward, for ail the
year round there are bright, glowing fires burn-
ing inside the castle walls.

Inside the castle Santa is always busy. The
postman brings him a huge mail every day, and his
first job, when he has had his breakfast, is to read
the letters written to him from millions of boys
and girls.
Some letters he loves to read. They are from
children who think of others as well as themselves.
In the picture you see him chuckling over one of
these. This is what it says:—•
"Dear Santa Claus. I love you very much.
Mummy has just bought us a new baby, so we don't
expect much more for Christmas, as this is the
nicest present we've ever had. But I know Dick
would like a train, although he says it would be
greedy to ask now, and Molly was hoping to get a
doll's house. Any little thing you have left over
would do for me, perhaps just a tiny little doily,
and would you bring Baby a rattle?
With love and kisses.
JOAN."

Santa Claus does not live alone. With him in
the castle are dozens of little workmen, who make
the toys. More than half of the rooms in the build-
ing are workshops. They are jolly little men, who
have great fun, cutting and carving and painting.
One of their favorite jobs is making rocking-horses.
First they plane the trunk of a tree until it is per-
fectly round and smooth. Then they slide this
along a bench where it is sawn into pieces for the
horses' bodies. Then, while one little man saws,
another is busy boring holes, and a third stands
ready with Neddy's head to slip into position.
There is a very large room where books are
printed and bound with bright covers. it is one
little workman's job to sit all day and find out from
children's letters the kinds of stories they like
best. He sees that there are always plenty of
adventure ones for the boys, and fairy stories for
little girls. When he wants a really extra special
new fairy story, he telephones the Queen of the
Fairies and she tells him all the latest happenings.

In another room, games of all kinds are made.
Here the workers have a very busy time manufac-
turing darts, and ludo boards, snakes and ladders,
and Chinese Chequers, table tennis sets and quoits.
Every little man has his own job. One spends his
time cutting out counters, another making cups in
which to shake dice, and a third, only a very little
fellow, mixes paints of every colour. He is very
good at making the check paint, which is used for
draught boards. He must not waste time, for there
is always someone waiting for more paint.
When a new game is made for the very first time,
all the workers have a holiday, so that they may
play it. Santa Claus comes in and joins in the tun,
too. What laughter and noise there is then! Each
worker is very eager to invent new games so that
there may be more of such holidays. Next time,
when you see a brand new game that you've never
seen before, you'll know that up in Santa s castle
in the clouds a very jolly party was held the day
it first was made.


There is a lovely store-room in the castle, where
all the toys and books and games are put when
they are finished.
And now I am going to let you into a secret.
Because these gifts are going to bring so much joy
to so many children, all the toy animals and people
are brought to life for a whole day, just one week
before Christmas. Santa Claus gathers them all
together and his little men go round amongst
them and tell each one what their new owner will be
like. Some are warned that they might be treated
carelessly, and others are told how dearly they will
be loved. But all of them know that if they try
hard to please, they will return again to the castle
in the clouds when they are worn out and thrown
away. Here they will be changed into the little
men who help Santa Claus.
No work is done on this day, one week before
Christmas, for this is the toys 7 day, their special
party. They play all sorts of games, just like you
do, and have the most delicious things to eat.
Fluff-cloud ice-cream and Sun-smile jelly are their
favourite dishes.

After the party the toys once more become
silent, and can no longer move about, but, all the
same, they know what is happening to them, and
can hear what is being said.
Working all day and all night, Santa's helpers
pack sacks full of the treasures they have made.
Here are all the things that can be imagined to
delight the hearts of boys and girls.
It is hard work lifting the sacks, and it takes
all the strength of three little men to move one.
The toys think it is great fun. Those at the top
look over the sides to watch where they are going.
Sammy Snake can uncoil to look round corners.
Sometimes the dolls are frightened they will fall
out, but the soldiers, policemen and horses have
no such fears, and feel very brave and strong as
they are carried along.
When the little men return after carrying out
a sack, each is given a long, cool ice-cream soda,
because, although it is so cold in the clouds, they
are very hot from their hard work. They drink
their soda quickly, for they are anxious to be back
at their work again.


When everybody is ready, dear old Santa Claus
appears. He waves to his men and they gather
round him.
#/ Before you leave, Santa Claus/ 7 says one, /7 tell
us about the first home you are visiting. 77
Now that is just what Santa wants to do. You
see, he always visits first the home of the very best
behaved children in the whole world for the year.
77 My dear helpers, 77 he begins, 77 t0-night I shall
call first at the home of Billy and Tommy White.
You remember that just a year ago their father
became very ill, and their mother had to take a
job to keep them. Every day since then, the two
boys have been up at six in the morning. They
have made their own beds and tidied their room,
they have set the table tor breakfast and washed
up afterwards; they have come home at lunch time
and prepared their fathers meal, and after school
they have done the shopping. And always, when
their mother has come home tired in the evening,
they have had tea ready tor her, and have worn
bright smiles to welcome her/ 7

"Three cheers for Billy and Tommy White,"
calls one little man, and the others all cheer lustily.
"But that is not the end of my story," says dear
old Santa. "I have good news for you. The boys'
father is now so much better that next year he will
be quite well again and able to work so that their
mother can stay at home. But now I must leave."
Quickly Santa Claus climbs into his sledge while
his workmen stand around watching.
The reindeer are harnessed ready and are eager
to be off. This is the night to which they look for-
ward all through the year. The rest of the time
they spend chasing each other across the clouds,
leaping from one to another. Sometimes they
miss a jump and then you see what you call a fall-
ing star shoot across the sky. Then they have to
call for Santa Claus to come and lasso the lost rein-
der and bring him back. Santa pretends to be very
cross when this happens, but he always has a laugh
about it with his little men afterwards.


At last Santa Claus is off on his journey. With
bounds of joy the reindeer leap forward, pulling
the heavy sledge across the snow clouds. Old Man
Moon laughs to see them coming, and the stars
twinkle all around.
The journey is not very easy across the clouds,
for the sledge sinks deep into their softness, but
soon the clouds are left behind. Then it is that the
reindeer speed through the open sky, and the
sledge flies behind them like an aeroplane.
Santa Claus leans back and sings with happi-
ness. He cracks his whip in the clear night air to
hear the sharp snap-snap it makes.
"Happy Christmas to you, Santa," calls out the
moon.
"Happy Christmas to you," twinkle the stars.
"Happy Christmas to you all, and thank you
for your light," shouts back Santa Claus.
The hobby-horse tries to neigh with pleasure,
but finds he cannot.
"Never mind," he thinks, "Tm going to be a
present for the two best boys in the world, and I
know Til have a good time."

They reach another cloud and slide gently across
to its edge. Here the reindeer come to a stand, and
Santa Claus lets down a ladder, for this is his first
stopping place. The ladder reaches right to a
chimney top.
Taking a sack on his back, Santa Claus climbs
down slowly. He smiles as he thinks of the
pleasure he is about to bring Willy and Tommy.
The chimney seems such a narrow one and the
sack so large, that for a while he almost wonders if
he will be able to go down it.
"It would be funny if I was stuck half-way and
they found me there in the morning," he laughs
to himself. "But that would never do," he adds;
"for then none of the other boys and girls would
get their presents."
So down Santa Claus goes, and very pleased he
is to find that the chimney has been all ready
swept tor him, so that his red clothes with their
white fur trimmings, and his long white beard do
not become dirty.
"They are all very good people," he mutters,
"I am glad I chose to visit them first."


The chimney leads into the fire-place of the
living room. On the mantelpiece a clock chimes
one as Santa climbs into the room. All is very
spic and span everywhere, no toys or books lying
about, but all stacked away neatly in the cupboard.
Santa Claus takes care to be very quiet as he
creeps into the room. A little kitten is curled up
in a basket in the corner. It opens one eye and
yawns. When it sees Santa, it purrs loudly and
rubs itself round his legs.
"Go back to sleep, little one," says the old man.
He tip-toes along the passage and opens a door
to peep inside. Here he sees Mr. and Mrs. White
sleeping peacefully. There is a healthy color in
Mr. White's cheeks and Santa smiles happily.
Without making a sound, he closes the door, and
moves softly down the passage.
Silently he turns the handle of the door of the
room where the boys are sleeping. All is quiet and
peaceful. Outside the window a bird twitters in
the tree, awakened by the rattling of the rein-
deer's harness above in the clouds.

Santa creeps to the top of the bed and looks at
the sleeping children. Two heads, one dark and
one fair, lie side by side.
"I wish you pleasant dreams," whispers Santa
Claus.
A smile spreads over the boys' faces as the wish
is granted.
Willy dreams that he is a full-grown man, and
that he has just been given an aeroplane all of his
very own. He takes it up into the sky and flies
from one end of Australia to the other. That is
what he has always wanted to do, and he feels the
the sweet cool air sweep past his face.
Tommy, too, is having an adventure. He is
exploring a jungle in the heart of Africa. With
him are his loyal band of black servants, who hack
a path tor him through th e trees and undergrowth.
Suddenly he enters a clearing where he finds an
old white man who, running forward and seizing
his hands, says:
"Ah, at last someone has come to rescue me.
When we return to Australia you will be rewarded
with a half share in the buried treasure I have
found here."


Santa Claus chuckles to himself, for he knows
what the boys are dreaming.
"Now for the stockings," he says.
Down at the foot of the bed hang four boys 1
socks. Quietly Santa stuffs them full of all the
things boys like. A hobby-horse, a trumpet, a
monkey on a stick, a ball, a game of quoits, a
cricket bat, and then, for both of them, a lovely
green motor car. This will not go in the socks, so
Santa stands it at the bedside.
With a last look round at the boys, he steals
away, up the chimney, up the ladder, and back to
his sledge.
Onward speed the reindeer.
"And now, /# says Santa, "Til visit little Joan,
who wrote me such a lovely letter."
The chimney is reached and down he climbs.
Soon he is in the room which seven-year-old Joan
shares with her younger sister, Mollie. Both little
girls lie snuggled in bed asleep. A soft breeze
blows through the window, gently rustling the
curtains.

Santa leans over the sleeping children and
smiles down at the two little heads with their curls
spread over the pillows.
Quietly he takes from his sack a large baby doll,
with eyes that open and close. She is dressed in
a pale pink silk frock and coat, with bonnet to
match. When she is hugged very tightly, she says
"Mamma" in a little squeaky voice. Her eyes are
blue, her cheeks rosy, and her hair short and curly.
On her feet are dainty white kid shoes with pink
pom-poms. She is very lovely. Gently Santa lays
her beside Joan and kisses the sleeping child.
He creeps over to Mollie's bed, and struggles
for a while with his sack before he pulls out the
jolliest doll's house that ever was made. It is two-
storied, and furnished from top to bottom. The
roof is painted red, and two chimneys stand one on
each end. All the paint-work is green, and the
walls white. He stands it by the bed and creeps
away.


In a few moments Santa is in Dick's room. Into
his stocking he stuffs a toy engine, carriages and
railway lines.
"Dear me," says he, as the end of one of the
lines goes through the toe of the sock. "Now
look what I've done! And I haven't brought a
needle with me, so I can't darn it."
in the room of the children's parents he finds
the baby, a cuddlesome little darling, lying in the
cradle with his eyes open. He gurgles at Santa,
as the old man drops a woolly ball and a bright blue
rattle beside him.
"Goo-goo," he says.
"And the same to you," replies Santa, "but I
can't stop to play with you. I have exactly nine
hundred million, one hundred and twenty-three
thousand, two hundred and sixty-six homes more
to visit, so I must be going."
And so Santa travels on, until all his presents
are delivered. Then once more he returns to his
castle in the clouds to start preparing for the next
Christmas.
