THE GOVERNOR’S MESSAGE.
“ It Is only a very small percentage of mankind who
leave behind them footprints on the sands of time, but the
men and women who gave their lives for freedom’s
cause in the great War have by their devotion, their
courage, their unselfishness, and their loyalty earned a
nation’s gratitude. Their grand example should prove
a stimulant to generations yet unborn, and, though they
have passed away, their memory will ever be kept
green in the hearts of their countrymen.

General Sir John Monash
MONASH’S MESSAGE.
“We are proud to have held our place and to have
fulfilled our part in the great work. We rejoice to
share in the glorious end of the struggle.”
[General Sir John Monash succeeded General Birdwood in
command of the Australian troops on the Western front. Sir
John is one of the most brilliant military men the Common-
wealth has produced, and is the first civilian to rise to the
tank of Lieutenant-General. He commanded the Third Division
of Australians which barred the road to Amiens, and completely
frustrated the enemy’s drive in that region. General Monash
was on Gallipoli continuously from the landing until the evacua-
tion. “ Monash Valley,” at Anzac, was named after him.] ,

General Sir Edmund Allenby
General Sir Edmund Henry Allenby is 58 years of age ; has
seen fighting service since he was 23 ; fought with Inniskilling
Dragoons in Bechuanaland Expedition 1884-5 ; Zululand, 1888 :
and in South African campaign, where he was a dashing and
successful Column Commander. When war broke out in 1914 he
was given the Cavalry Division, and fought through the retreat from
Mons and battle of the Marne. In May, 1915, he commanded
the Infantry Corps, and subsequently led the new Third Army on
the Somme, but in Spring of 1916 and succeeding Winter, there
was no action beyond brilliant trench raids on the Third Army
front. In Easter, 1917, Sir Edmund commanded the British
right wing in the great battle of Arras. The following June
he was transferred to command of British forces in Egypt, and
conducted the magnificent campaign, in which the Australian
Light Horse participated so gloriously, and which resulted in
jthe conquest of Palestine and overthrow of the Turks. I /

Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig
In his despatch to the British Government on the con-
clusion of the War, Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig thus
refers to the Australians: —
“ The First Australian Division, by a boldly conceived
operation, captured Merris on 28th July. With regard to
the turning battle of Amiens on Bth August, the brilliant
part taken by the Australians in this battle is worthy of the
highest commendation. The skill and determination of these
troops proved irresistible at all points, and met with rapid
and complete success. The part played by Australia both
on the battlefield and at home will live gloriously for all time.

Australian and has • long and meri-
torious service with the A.I.F. to his

ENLISTMENTS.
Owing to the formation of new battalions abroad
the frequent transfers from one unit to another, and
the introduction in 1917 of the general service rein-
forcements, it is impossible to obtain any idea of the
total enlistments and casualties in any one battalion.
HONORS.
No record has been kept of Honors classified into
Battalions or States, and until the Commanding
Officers’ Official Battalion War Diaries are available
no idea can be obtained of the honors won by any
particular Battalion.

on the Ascanius on 20th October, 1914, under the
command of Colonel S. Price AA'eir, D. 5.0., AM).
Three men (Inwood, Blackburn, and Davey) obtained
the V.C.
"The Glorious 10th” received its baptism of fire
at "The Landing” on 25th April, 1915, being the
first South Australian unit to actively enter battle.
They, with portion of the 11th Battalion (AA'.A.)
and the 9th Battalion (Queensland), formed the
covering party, making the first onslaught on the
Anzac foreshore, which they took at the point of
the bayonet—with empty magazines. They left
on 20th November, 1915, about 14 days before the
actual evacuation. In Prance they fought through
the great struggle on the Somme. As part of the
Ist Division, they took a prominent part in the
famous battle of Pozieros. It was the Ist Division
that actually captured the town. Later big stunts
were Bapaume, Bullecourt, and Polygon AA’ood. It
is said that the lOth’s record in victories, decorations
and promotions will compare favorably with any
other British regiment.
ENLISTMENTS.
Owing to the formation of new battalions
abroad, the frequent transfers from one unit to
another, and the introduction in 1917 of the
general service reinforcements, it is impossible
to obtain any idea of the total enlistments and
casualties in any one battalion.

and covered the evacuation, being the last
to leave that tragic country that in the
previous seven months had witnessed
deeds of sacrifice and heroism equal to any
in the annals of the British race. They
were in the thick of things in t rance, and

took the cemetery portion of the objective,
and came nobly through some of the
hottest of the fighting, suffering great
losses.

12th Battalion
3rd Brigade
Ist Division
There were originally only three com-
panies o£ South Australians in this Bat-
talion, and two of these, comprising 6 of-
ficers and 232 other ranks, left Adelaide for
Melbourne on 21st September, 1914. They
embarked with four companies from Tas-
mania and one from Western Australia,
which completed the formation of the
Battalion, under the command of lieut.-
Colonel Clark, a Tasmanian, who was killed
in action at “The l anding” (25/4/15).
The 12th are a sister battalion to the
52nd. They formed portion of the cover-
ing party at “The Landing.” They also
took a prominent part in the Lone Pine
stunt and remained on Gallipoli for seven
months, during which time they went
through much heavy fighting. They left
at the evacuation, and after reorganisation
in Egypt proceeded to France, where they
put up a glorious record. The Somme,
Pozieres, Moquet Farm, Bapaume, Bulle-
court, and Polygon Wood are some of
their stunts.

The 32nd, under the command of Lieut.-
Colone) D. M. it. Coghill, V.D., left on the
Oeelong on 18th November, 1915, Its total
strength being 29 officers and 956 other ranks.
They took their first reinforcements of 1 officer
and 100 men with them. They were garrisoned
for a while at Israadia, on the Canal banks, but
received their first “try-out” under General
McKay at Eleuer Bay, in the North of Trance.
Here this now battalion of South Australians,
who had never previously been under fire,
went over the top and crossed No Man’s Land
wave upon wave like veterans—every man a
hero. The German gunners had the range to
an inch and played fearful havoc in our ranks,
but the gaps filled as fast as they were made
and the objective was gained, though the
British, failing to come up on the right as
arranged, left our men without support. At
nightfall the Germans flooded the trenches,
causing further great losses. The 27th later
distinguished itself in the long struggle on the
Somme, and their record ranks among the
highest.

The Pioneers
The sth Pioneer Battalion was part of the
sth Division formed in Egypt after the evacua-
tion out of picked men. They are really
“fighting engineers” who, in addition to carry-
ing the full equipment of a soldier, carry also
their tools of trade. The Pioneers are a new
development of modern warfare. Their work
is always in the front, and our Pioneers have
done splendid work in France. There is an old
wall of the “digger” that runs—
The Bombers never bomb,
And the Snipers never snipe ;
The Engineers ne* er engineer,
For the poor old Digger does the lot.
All ranks, however, admit that the Pioneers do
really pioneer.

43rd Battalion
3rd Division
11th Brigade
(One V.C.: Corporal Wethers.)
The 43rd consisted ot 30 officers and 991 other ranks,
and was originally commanded by Lieut.-Colonel D.
D. Gorden, who was soon succeeded by l.ieut.-
Colonel C. P. Butler, D. 5.0., one of the most popular
battalion commanders in the A.I.F. They left on
the Arne on 9th June, 1916. Their first stunt in
France was the famous battle of Messines, where,
after nearly two years’ of preparation under General
Plumer, the British blew up the whole ridge, this
being the greatest explosion of the war, being regis-
tered as an earthquake in many of the observatories
of Europe. The subsequent assault, in which the
43rd distinguished themselves, is numbered amongst
the most successful operations ot the whole war.
From Messines the 43rd proceeded to Kemmel Hill,
and later into the front line at Warneton on 31st
July, 1917, where, in the fierce fighting that ensued,
they had 288 casualties in the first 24 hours. They
took and maintained all objectives. In the great
assault in front of Ypres, in the vicinity of the Pas-
chendaele Kidge, the 43rd were in the front wave of
16 waves. The total number of troops in this great
stunt is said to approach 1,090,000. In this opera-
tion the 43rd lost most of its officers, either killed or
wounded. Later stunts were Villers Bretoneau (on
the Somme), Bray, Peronne, and Koyselle.

The 50th was formed during the reorgani-

after the evacuation. The original com-
manding officer was Lleut.-Colonei Hur-
combe, who, like most of the officers as well
as other ranks, came from the 10th Bat-
talion. The officers and men of the 50th,
therefore, wore part of the 10th during all
the Gallipoli campaign, and share in its
glories. In France, as part of the 4th
Division, they earned the proud title of
“The Saviours of France” by blocking the
German rush on Paris in 1917. Among
their numerous battles, Moquet Farm,
Bullecourt, and Villers Bretoneau are most
worthy of note.
No record has been kept' of honors classified

to leave South Australia for the front.
Both these officers were Brigadiers. The
No. 2 Section of the 3rd Field Artillery,
consisting of 24 men, left Adelaide for
Melbourne on 14th September, 1914, and
the 3rd Field Artillery Brigade Ammunition

that the efficiency and keenness of our
Artillery Unit was equal to anything on

Nineteen officers, 363 other ranks, with 460
horses, left Adelaide for Melbourne on 23rd
November, 1914. They were under the com-
mand of Lieut.-Colonel A. Miell, V.D. After a
few months in Egypt they were dismounted and
sent to Gallipoli, arriving there early in May,
where they suffered heavy casualties, losing
among many other gallant officers their popular
commander, Colonel Miell. They took part in
the Suvla Bay and other stunts on Gallipoli, and
after the evacuation again became a mounted
brigade, were sent to Palestine, and operated
there under our present State Commandant Brig.-
General Antill. The Palestine campaign was
perhaps the most picturesque of the whole war,
and the spectacle of this, the oldest country on
earth, being subjugated by horsemen from the
newest (15,000 miles distant) is not the least
interesting feature of it. The 3rd Light Horse
took a prominent part in most of the important
operations in the Palestine campaign.

Just as the 50th came out of the 10th, so the
52nd Battalion was formed mostly out of the
32nd during the reorganisation of our forces in
Egypt after the evacuation. The original com-
mand was given to Lieut.-Colonel M. P. Beevor,
who came from the 10th Battalion. As part of
the 4th Division, the 52nd fought side by side
with the 50th, and share with them the proud
distinction of staying the great German rush on
Baris, which almost succeeded. They also fought
at Moquet Farm, Bullecourt, and Villers Bret-
oneau. In 1918, however, owing to the heavy
losses in the Australian forces and the shortage
of reinforcements, this Battalion was split up
to reinforce others and thus lost its identity.

The 11th, “0” Squadron, comprising 6 officers

1915. They were joined by two squadrons
from Queensland. The original commanding
officer was a Queenslander, Lieut.-Coionel
Grant, but later he was succeeded by a South
Australian, Lieut.-Coionel J. W. Parsons.
They were dismounted in Egypt, and in May,
1915, went on to Gallipoli as an infantry regi-
ment, and did good work on the Peninsula.
After the evacuation they were again mounted
and sent to Palestine, where they had greater
scope for the dash for which they are noted.
Throughout the whole Palestine campaign they
were with the other Australian Light Horse at
the head of the advance, and there are few not-
able victories in that most successful campaign
in which they did not play an important part.

Machine Guns
Under the original organisation there
were Machine Gunners with every unit,
and this system was continued right through
the Gallipoli campaign ; but by the time of
the reorganisation in Egypt the new de-
velopments in warfare had demanded the
formation of Machine Gun Sections. The
A.I.P. Machine Gun Sections have reached
a stage of efficiency that is equal to any-
thing in Europe. At Pozieres, where they
received their first great try-out, they came
through it with wonderful success. In all
the other stunts in which the Australians
took part the Machine Gun Sections par-
ticipated with distinction.

The Flying Corps
There is no distinct South Australian Flying
Unit. Many South Australians, however, won
great distinction as aviators in Kgypt and
France. Among these was Flight Captain
Ross Smith, who won the Military Cross with
bar and the Distinguished Flying Cross with
two bars. Captain Smith, whose wife resides
at Walkerville, left South Australia as a private
in the 3rd Light Horse, and later transferred to
the Flying Corps, Another South Australian
who distinguished himself in aviation was Major
W. R. Snow, D. 5.0., M.C., of the Royal Flying
Corps, who recently returned to his home at
Aldgate.
At the outset of the war Great Britain had
only six squadrons of aeroplanes, but at the
Armistice she had 200 squadrons, and was
building 4,000 ’planes a month. During hos-
tilities the British aviators brought down 8,000
enemy machines, and 3,800 of outs were lost.

Field Ambulance
The 11th Field Ambulance, consisting of
7 officers and 170 other ranks, left here on
the Suevic on 31st May, 1916. Many rein-
forcements left later from time to time.
Throughout the whole Gallipoli campaign,
from the first day of “The Landing” they
“did wonders.” These brave men, who
moved quietly and determinedly about
their work —often being struck but never
being able to strike back—performed deeds
of heroism that could not be surpassed.
Wherever our boys went, with bomb or
bayonet, wherever the fight was thickest,
there the faithful Field Ambulance followed
him and ministered to him in the hour of
his need. No man can estimate the lives
they saved or the suffering they eased, but
this every “digger” knows: that the boys
of the A.I.P. Field Ambulance have done
their duty nobly.
ENLISTMENTS.
Owing to the formation of new battalions abroad,
the frequent transfers from one unit to another, and
the introduction in 1917 of the general service rein-
forcements, it is impossible to obtain any idea of the
total enlistments and casualties in any one battalion.

Kuhnel’s Pianos

The Estey
The delight of playing upon an Estey Piano
is an experience to remember. An Estey is
to the pianist what a STRADIVARIUS is to
the violinist. An instrument of glorious
power and tone, which is alive under the fingers
and which responds to every shade of the
artist’s feeling—that is the INCOMPARABLE
ESTEY, used by the world’s greatest musicians.

The refinement of tone and quality of these
Pianos have made them favorite all over the
world.
The Laffargue
Is essentially a drawing-room Piano. Chaste
in design and perfect in finish.
The Faust
Has a rich tone that is full and pure, stands
well in tune, and by reason of its soundness
of construction withstands all climatic changes.

48th Battalion
4th Division
12th Brigade
The 48th was formed in England after the
evacuation, and was composed mostly of officers
and men from the 16th Battalion. The 48th
stands in the same relation to the 16th as the
50th does to the 10th. It shared in all the
glories of the 16th in those hard days on Galli-
poli. Lieut.-Colonel Leane, D. 5.0., M.C., was
given command, and led his battalion gloriously
through many a hard-fought battle in France.
They were in the thick of the fray at Pozieres,
the first Australian victory worthy of note in
France that thrilled their countrymen with
pride when the reports came through. At
Fleurbaix, and later at Bullecourt, they per-
formed conspicuously. They were one of the
first battalions to dash through the breach at
Messincs after the explosion, and out of that
famous mix-up they came with flying colors.
They suffered very heavy losses in France.

The No. 5 Tunnelling Company, consisting ot 7b
men, loft Adelaide for Melbourne on 28th February,
1918 and they took their first reinforcements of «

out of miners, and most of our contribution came
from Broken Hill. “Tunnelling” is a.new formi of

this our unit has achieved great success.

16th Battalion
4th Division
4th Brigade
Only three companies of the original 16th
were South Australians; the other five com-
panies were from Western Australia. The
battalion was under the command of Colonel
H Pope C. 8., a Westralian. Our men left
here for Melbourne on the 22nd November, 1914.
Although the 16th had not the honor of being
in the actual “Landing,” they acted as a decoy
to deceive the enemy into believing that we
intended landing higher up. They set foot on
Anzac Cove only about eight or ton hours alter
the covering party, and from the start to finish
on Gallipoli they were in the thickest of the
fighting. The 16th was for months stationed
at “Quinn’s Post,” which was the pivot of the
whole Anzac position, their trenches being only
ton yards away from those of the Turks, and
raids' were exchanged almost every night and
bombing proceeded every day. The position
being on the crest of a ridge, there was hourly
danger of under-mining. The mental and
physical strain on the boys was terrible. During
all these long months their losses were heavy,
steady and continuous. It was just to the right
of this spot where Jacka won the first Australian
V.C. Their wonderful fighting qualities showed
up with equal brilliance in Franco, where they
shared the successes of the •Ith D ivisl °n at
Moquet Farm, Bullecourt, and \ filers Bret-
onean.

On the 11th November, 1914, Captain
Ogilvy left Adelaide for Liverpool, N.S.W.,
with 50 picked men, 38 of whom wore
decorations from previous campaigns.
They left Sydney for “parts unknown” on
the 28th of the same month. They took
with them from Adelaide their famous little
mascot, the liver and white English water
spaniel, presented by Mrs. L. E. Colley,
which went safely through the campaign.
To our tropical force belongs the honor of
the first definite success of the war, for with

dream of supremacy in the Pacific was gone
for ever.

Although this arm ol the service never gets much

Nanoleon said that an army marches on its stomach,

J l'tierc is no section of the community so easily stirred as
ats children. With their ready imagination, natural
impulsiveness, and simple generosity, their enthusiasm
is quickly kindled, and follows glowingly in the wake of
that kindred spirit which has evoked it. Thus the pulse
of the school speaks loudly in the works of its children.
And since the Interest of the child soon becomes the
interest of the family, the school may be made the means
of stirring to activity a whole district, and isolatea
homes, without other opportunity, may be thus brought
into service.
Steadily, week in, week out, with little flare or flag-flap to
give publicity to their work, thousands of young loyalists
f Sre working, earning, collecting, on behalf of those
brothers whose deeds are rightly their pride and boast.
In September, 1915, came into being the “ South Aus-
tralian Children's Patriotic Fund ” —a fund which re-
ceives willing support from every corner of the State.
A FEW FACTS.
How the activities of the Children’s Patriotic Fund have
•grown is best evidenced by the figures for 1917.
During the first three months of the year £728 found its
way to the Treasurer. The next term showed a slight
falling off in figures, but much energy in the way oi
gathering forces, for in the third quarter of the /ear
rose in a steady stream from £6Ol to
'j£4 113 This full tide was maintained throughout tne
remainder of the year, so that during the last three
months £B,OOO reached the Treasurer, making a total of
£13,858 to pass through her books m 1917, as
-against the total of £IO,OOO during the two preceding
years. In addition calls in money and kind made upon
schools by local societies were recorded at about tiz.uuu,
thus bringina the totals for 1917 well oyer £20,000.
About 10,000 children have joined the War service
Army ” each member of which undertakes to earn ten
■shillings by personal elfort and donate it toward our
Soldiers’ Funds. The badge of membership is the war
Service Medal, with it? bars for additional service, in-
trinsic in value, yet rich in so far as it symbolises pat-
riotism expressed in deed rather than word —self-denial,
self-effort, service.
This armv of young workers has already contributed
■earnings to the extent of over £6,000 to the Children s
Patriotic Fund, the greater part of this being represented
by the slow accumulation of pennies and halfpennies.
During 1917, in addition to £12,000 which found its way
to various societies through local channels, the scnoois
donated £2,590 to Red Cross, £845 to Wounded Soldiers,
£3,730 to Trench Comforts, £2,000 to the Y.M.C.A.
Army Department, £720 to the Navy League, £l5O to
Repatriation, and £4OO for maintenance of KeswicK
(Recreation Hall. Smaller amounts also found their
way to other funds.
SUMMARY OF C. P. FUND’S WORK.
During the period September, 1915-December, 1917, no
complete record was kept, as schools contributed to local
societies as well as their own fund. From January, 1918,
all moneys passed into the one channel. As far as tne
records go, the results are as follows (to end of February,


1919); —British Bed Cross, £23,225 16/6 and numerous
garments; French Bed Cross, £1,215 17/6; Australia
Day Fund, £2,758 6/7 ; Australian Comforts, Fund,
£6,879 14/7 and numerous Xmas boxes and thousand*,
of socks and comforts ; Keswick Recreation Hut (equip-
ment and upkeep), £1,668 10/11 ; Y.M.C.A. Army De-
partment, £3,152 1/7; Navy League, £1,733 9/10;
Returned Sailors and Soldiers’ Imperial League, £1,038-
8/2 ; Repatriation Committee, £5,484 12/1 ; wool for
socks, £1,866 12/4; Belgian Relief Fund, £l3O 16/5-
and numerous bales of clothing ; Overseas Tobacco Fund,
£4OB 5/-; Cheer-Up Society, £lO9 11/6 ; Torrens Park.
Hospital, £293 15/11 ; Myrtle Bank Soldiers’ Home,
£257 19/« ; Bedford Park Sanatorium, £SOO ; Soldiers'
Hostel, £6O ; Emergency Corps for Fallen Soldiers’ Chil-
dren, £l5O ; Child Welfare, £IOO ; Keswick Rest Room,
£I,OOO. To this must be added £36,000 War Savings
toward the War Loan, thus making a cash output in>
patriotic effort of about £IOO,OOO.

is so vast, its component parts so widely separated by

a danger of disunion from within, but while we each do
our best to “inspire personal and active interest in the

the differences of color, race, and customs that mark the-
individual parts of that whole.

TRENCH COMFORTS FUND
THE SOUTH AUSTRALIAN DIVISION OF THE AUSTRALIAN
COMPORTS FUND.
Co nforts Fund work in South Australia practically dates
fro u Septemoer, 191. j, when, at the request of the
Defence Department, the League of Loyal Women
undertook the packing and despatch of Christmas gifts
to South Australian soldiers on active service abroad.
Approximately 12,000 Christmas billycans were packed
and forwarded : as soon as the work was completed the
small committee that had been responsible for it was<
enlarged and re-appointed, and on Ist December of that
year toe Central Trench Comforts Fund of the League
ea ue into existence, and the seneme for sending regular
supplies of ‘ Co iforts " to South Australian combatant
train was definitely launched. Meanwhile similar
work vis iciif dole in tne ot.uer States, and when it
Vis did Li t to f ilente toe si< State organisations in
(i ■, TU i, t ii s Co u iitt.ee Hicame the Executive of the
ii it, i diitriliku ill idol of tie A.C.F., with Mr. B.
J. la v,{rt; as it. im irue it dive at the A.C.T. head-
quarters in Sydney.
Pro i the o itset tne Central Committee was supported
hr unit Co a.air,tees, e ui.i one of which caters for the(
nej Is of its particular unit; tnere are also forty nine (
co litre inic ies, wnile many country centres do excel-
led work for tile Fund without being re gistered as
defiiite oranenes. A Men’s i’o.iaeco Auxiliary, formed
in March, 1917, has collected £3.000 for the purchase of
Australian tobicco and cigarettes for the troops ; and a
Men’s Committee, formed in June, 1918, of which his
Worship the Mayor is Chairman, has given valuable
assistance to the Central Committee in many ways.
By the courtesy of the South Australian Government
the Fund has been allowed, rent free, the basement of
the Bxhioition Building as a depot ever since its incep-
tion. Here goods have (including newspapers, etc.) j
been received, packed, and despatched, while workers,
under the leadership of Mrs. Lungley, have met dally to (
make shirrs and other supplemental articles of clothing.
In March, 1917, at the suggestion of Mrs. London, and
under her leadership, a Trench Comforts Shop was opened
in Bowman’s Arcade ; to December, 1918, the profits
from this source alone totalled £7,404.
The following figures speak tor themselves of the magni-
tude of the Fund’s workAt the Depot 22 miles of
flannel have been made into shirts, and 35,027 pairs of
socks (exclusive of other woollens) have been packed and
despatched. In all 15,239 cases of goods have been
shipped from the Depot, at an approximate value of
, £48,782 ; and in three years (1916,1917 and 1918) nearly
62,000 Christmas boxes were sent to South Australian i
soldiers abroad. i
Since its inception the Central Fund has received £41,378
(apart from the amounts collected by Unit Committees
and the Unit Committees’ share of special appeals), while
£6 351 has been spent locally on comforts by the Central
Committee, £32,907 has been forwarded by them to the
Commissioners in London, and £11,710 by Unit Com-
mittees for special units.
During the same period approximately £30,845 has been
collected by the Unit Committee, bringing the grand
total up to £72,223.
As the whole of the work, both in South Australia and
abroad, is voluntary (except for a small sustenance
allowance that was paid for a time to one of the Assistant
Commissioners), the administrative expenses are very
small, amounting only to 1J per cent, in South Aus-
tralia and Id. in every £1 overseas.
It is noteworthy that, until about eighteen months ago,
the whole of the work in connection with the Fund,


including even packing, nailing, hooping and branding
