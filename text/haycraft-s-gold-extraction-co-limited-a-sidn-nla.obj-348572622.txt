HAYCRAFTS GOLD EXTRACTION
LIMITED.
DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS
HAYCRAFT’S process of Gold Extraction is a combination of certain well-known
operations, viz., Electrolytic Chlorination and Electro Amalgamation, carried on in
one vessel at a boiling temperature.
The vessel in which the extraction is carried on is an iron pan, as shown in plan ;
the bottom of the pan slopes towards a shallow well in the centre; a wooden frame
nade to slide up and down on two upright guides carries a vertical shaft over the
centre of trepan; to the bottom of this shaft are attached four or more arms, reach-
ing down nearly to the bottom of the pan, and to these arms are affixed carbon shoes;
the under surfaces of these shoes when adjusted, are about one inch abuve the
bottom of the pan, but do not cover the well in centre of pan.
The pan itself is mounted on brickwork, and can be heated either by a fire
underneath or it can be made with a steam chamber underneath; the latter plan is
found to be most convenient
A dynamo is provided, the positive pole of which is connected with the shaft of
the stirrers, so that the electric current may pass to the carbon shoes; and the negative
pole is connected with the iron pan, and through the pan to the quicksilver.
As the presence of slimes is not detrimental to the working of the process, and as
it is impossible to recover the finer particles of gold, without fine crushing, it is
recommended that the stone should be ground fine enough to pass through a 60 x 60
sieve, i.e ., with 3,600 holes to the square inch. This can be done by any effective mill
that the mine owner may prefer, but it may be pointed out that when the stone is not
crushed so fine the Haycraft process will still save a larger percentage of the gold than
can be obtained by any ordinary amalgamation.
The stone having been crushed, the operation of treating a ton charge is as
follows: —
Mercury is placed in the pan—this fills the centre well and forms the cathode ; 100
galls, water is next run in, together with common salt if the water is fresh ; should the
water contain sodium chloride to the extent of 2 per cent., no salt need be added;
where the ore is heavily charged with pyrites, chloride of lime is more efficacious than
common salt; heat is then applied, and the shaft carrying the carbon shoes is caused
to revolve, and as soon as the water boils the charge of ore is fed in; the current of
electricity generated by the dynamo now- passes down the arms into the carbon shoes,
through the salt water and sand into the mercury and the iron pan, and thence back
to the dynamo.
The electric current in its passage through the salt water decomposes the salt
(chloride of sodium); sodium is deposited at the cathode, viz., the mercury, and forms
sodium amalgam, whilst chlorine is set free on the anode, viz., the carbon shoes 5
chlorine, being a gas, must rise towards the surface of the liquor in the pan, and in
passing through the mass of sand comes into contact with the gold ; the coarse particles
of gold are only slightly acted upon—just surface-cleaned—and by the combined action
of their own specific w eight and the agitation of the sand produced by the revolving
arms and the boiling, gradually sink until they reach the mercury at the bottom of the
pan, where they are amalgamated at once. The fine particles of gold are also attacked
by the chlorine, and ow ing to the strong chemical action, intensified by the boiling
temperature of the liquor, are almost instantly dissolved, and formed into chloride
of gold; the circulation in the pan soons brings this chloride of gold within the
influence of the electric current, which at once causes its electrolysis ; the chlorine is
again set free on the anodes, and the gold is deposited at the cathode, viz., the mercury.
Thus in one operation, and in the same vessel, both the coarse and fine gold are saved.
The boiling is continued for about one hour, the heat is then cut off, and as soon as
ebullition has ceased a plug in the side of the pan is removed, and while the arms are
still revolving the exhausted charge is run out, the mercury remaining in the pan. A
fresh charge of hot water and salt is now run into the pan, and, when boiling, a fresh
charge of ore is fed in, and the operation is repeated.
The time occupied in treating a charge, emptying and refilling, is about two hours;
so that with two pans 24 tons can be treated in twenty-four hours, or about 140 tons
a week. The mercury remains in the pan until sufficiently charged with gold, when
the arms are raised out of the pan and the mercury lifted, squeezed, and replaced
again, while the amalgam is put aside for retorting in the usual manner. Although
the pan takes about 100 gallons of water with a ton of ore, the greater part of this
quantity can be used again after a short settling, and it will be found that, with care,
50 gallons per ton will cover the actual consumption, exclusive of the water required
for the engine, where steam power is used.
The cost of working the patent process in South Australia, including crushing and
all subsequent treatment, on a mine fairly equipped with plant and appliances is
estimated at not over 7s. per ton; and the Company will issue licences for the use of
Haycraft’s patent process at a royalty of 2s. per ounce on the gold recovered.
The engine power required tor the electric part of a plant of two pans is about
5 1.H.P., and a man and boy for each shift can attend to the two pans easily.
THE Extraction Plant erected at East Adelaide is for the purpose of showing on a
practical scale the advantages of the Haycraft Process of Gold Extraction. Parcels of
from 5 to 20 tons of gold stone are crushed and treated on the premises at a moderate
charge. Dry crushing is preferred, and this is efficiently done by an Otis Ball Mill,
which reduces the stone fine enough to pass a sieve with 60 x 60 holes per square inch.
About 250 tons have already been treated.
ADVANTAGES OF THE PROCESS:
It saves both the coarse and fine grold in one
operation.
It requires hut a small quantity of IVater.
The Cost of the Plant is very moderate, and the
weight much less than that of a Battery
Plant.
The time required for treating a charge is only
two hours.
