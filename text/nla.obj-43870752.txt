PREFACE .
SHE Drama is admittedly a great public instructor. It has
before now been used effectively to correct abuses. Can it not
be turned to account in Victoria to purge political life ? “ Polling
Day” has been written with that object. There is one especial pest
—the professional election tout —which in the interests of True
Liberalism requires rooting out of our political system. It is said
that no sooner does a camel stumble in the desert than the sky,
which was bright and clear before, becomes flecked with a thousand
black objects—the vigilant birds of the desert flocking their
prey. Almost an equal rapacity marks the whole tribe of election
touts. A political contest is scented from afar off ; and then every
entity of the genus political bloodsucker is on the qui vive. The
first great object with these gentry is to secure wealthy candidates,
and the next is to bleed them. The pictures painted in,the drama
on this subject have been drawn from the life.
The higher object sought to be attained by the drama of
“ Polling Day ” —but which has been very feebly and imperfectly
carried out —is the presentation of a lofty type of politician, who,
while not without his defects, might perhaps be found worthy of
study by those destined to be the future electors and elected of
Victoria. The character of Wentworth has not been so fully
developed as was desirable ; and this feature has fallen far short
of the author’s intention. But it may possibly possess a germ
which abler and more leisured pens may mature.

ACT I.
SCENE I.—Melbourne. Private parlor in a hotel.
Longlands, Major, and seven capitalists in meeting assembled. Longlands
presiding.
Long. Well, gentlemen, let us to business. We want to pass that Laud
Titles Bill. Can it be done ?
Ist & 2nd Cap. That’s the question.
Major. There must be no question.
Long. But there is, though.
Maj. Why, there’s a matter of two or three millions sterling at stake
on that Bill I
Long. True, but that fact won’t pass the Bill.
Maj. Money can do anything. That Bill must be passed.
Long. That’s very well said ; but how are the ropes to be worked ?
All. Yes, how shall wo do it, Major?
Maj. We must work that out. Are you good for £20,000 amongst ye ?
Long. The sum is large.
Maj. So is the prize.
Long. Quite true. I suppose we must throw the sprat to catch the
mackerel. The cash will be posted.
Maj. Very well. You may as well hand in your cheques, to be passed
in to the general fund. [ They each write a cheque and giveit to Collins.']
Thanks. You see it’s much better to deal with each other like business
men. I think you would rather not take receipts. They might tell tales.
All. No receipts are wanted.
Maj. Very good. So far—well. The Ministry are squared. They
will support the Bill, but they won’t take the responsibility of introducing
it. We want a good man to engineer it.
Long. Well—your means ?
Maj. You see wo can get the requisite votes in the House— some one
way, some another; —but we want a sponsor for the Bill—a man who will
whitewash it, fight for it, defend it, praise it, push it through. You see ?
Long. Yes; —well ?
Maj. Well, such a man is Flux. He must win the Goalong election.
I have tested him, weighed him, secured him. He will do his work and
ask no questions. He will bold that Bill up in the House as a piece of
immaculate purity.
Long. Then that man should be secured.
Maj. Very good. The labourer is worthy of his hire. So there’s
Scripture warrant for buying a politician. [ All the capitalists laugh, except
Longlands, who frowns severely .]
Long. (With affected virtue.) Not buying, sir. We must buy no man;
— we may persuade him.
Maj. Well,yes; persuade him (laughs) —persuade him with 600 hard
round facts. Ha 1 ha Iha 1
Long. ( Having risen and walked up and down the stage.) I do not like
this business.
Maj. No? Then back out of it.
Ist Cap. But then this property 1 Are we to lose a hundred thousand
pounds apiece for a mere scruple ?


Maj. Why then does he hesitate ?
Long. Because—because—it almost looks like bribery.
Maj. I prefer to call things by pleasanter names.
Long. What can you call it ?
Maj. I should say—diplomacy, which always wants secret service
money.
All Cap. Hear, hear.
Long. Well, I suppose I must do my duty with the rest.
Maj. So, then, Flux must get into Parliament if half the voters in
Goalong have to be convinced by other means than logic. You understand?
Long. Well, yes—partly.
Maj. Wentworth must be kept out at all hazards.
Long. How will you keep down such a man ?
Maj. My dear sir, the “Almighty Dollar” is omnipotent. Leave it
to me.
All. Tell us your plans.
Maj. Well, Wentworth is clever, proud, ambitious, and poor. People
say he’s in love. So much the better. I would show such a man a readier
road to happiness than the thorny one of politics.
Long; That is prudent. You said Flux understood your wishes ?
Maj. I did. He will be here in a few minutes to know yours.
Long. I would rather not have been seen in this business.
Maj. Fear nothing, and trust to me.
[Knocking at door. Enter waiter. ]
Waiter, Gentleman sends up his card, sir.
Maj. ( Reading card and handing it to Longlands.) Show him up.
Enter Flux.
Flux. Ah, Major! Good day. [ Bows to Longlands and capitalists, who
return it.]
Maj. Gentlemen, this is Mr. Flux, the new candidate for Goalong, one
who I think would serve his country well in Parliament. Mr. Flux, these
gentlemen have weighty political influence. I hope they may become
your supporters. [All the gentlemen bow again.']
Flux. I am honoured, gentlemen, by your acquaintance. I trust the
obligation may be doubled by your support.
Long. In these matters a sacred duty makes us cautious, you know, Mr.
Flux. I may say, however, that Major Collins has prepossessed us in your
favour. But patriotism is a grave responsibility.
Flux. The sentiment, sir, does you honour. In these days, when men’s
souls' so rarely rise above sordid selfishness, it is more than over incumbent
upon the patriot to strive after a lofty ideal. I shall hope, sir, even from
your high-souled scrupulosity to find the means to your favour. (Aside.)
That ought to fetch him. (To company.) I fain, gentlemen, would make the
world a debtor to my life, and poorer for the loss of it.
Long. Your aspirations, sir, arc noble.
Chorus of Cap. They do you credit, sir.
Flux. Nay, gentlemen, I claim no credit but that of honesty—no merit
save a strong desire for the general weal. I honour, I love the noble people;
and I seek to serve’ the cause of labour by first promoting the growth of
capital upon which labour thrives. (Aside.) That hook is well baited, I
think.
Maj. (Aside.) How well can Satan play the saint 1
Long. I think, sir, I may promise you my support.
Ist and 2nd Cap. You have ours also.
All. And ours.


Fldx. Thanks, gentlemen, veiy much. I regard my cause as half won
by that avowal. I wilt not further trespass on your kindness, gentlemen.
I have many calls to make ; I will wish you good morning.
All. Good morning 1 Success I [Exit Fldx.
Maj. I think, gentlemen, you will admit that fellow to be a most
discreet scoundrel. He will play the lamb to your “ mint sauce ” with
unsmirched propriety.
Long. I think, sir, that his principles are sound, and such as should be
encouraged. You have my cheque towards assisting a patriot into
Parliament.
Maj. And towards keeping Wentworth out. You don’t think the
business looks like bribery now—eh ?
Lomq. Oh no. I couldn’t take part in any bribery business, you know.
Maj. Of course not (laughs mockingly). None of you could,
gentlemen! Adieu! [Exit Major.
Long. Do you know, gentlemen, I think the Major very presuming.
Ist Cap. So he is; but we can’t afford to quarrel with him.
2nd Cap. Mustn’t expect to have clean tools for a dirty job, you know.
3rd Cap. Come away, and crack a bottle to the success of our scheme.
[Exeunt omnes.
SCENE II.—Goalong. A hotel parlor.
Enter Sharkie Slope and Billy Bounce. Both seat themselves at table
with papers. Bounce calls for drinks.
Bon. Out of luck, Sharkie ?
Sl. Quite.
Bod. Not even a guinea engagement. Where are the candidates’
consciences, I wonder?
Sl. Consciences! Don’t talk rot, Billy. No sensible candidate carries
such a thing about him.
Bod. They say Flux has engaged all his men.
Sl. Yes; he’s flush of the rhino ; but it’s all bespoke ; so there’s no use
our looking in that quarter. Then there’s Wentworth ; but there’s little or
no “ sugar ” there. His follows are working for love. That’s a coin of the
realm I don’t understand. Still—an election must never take place in
Goalong without my assistance. I should lose my reputation if it did; and
that—(laughs cynically) —l couldn’t survive. Take my life, my health, my
wealth—but spare my reputation (laughs).
Bod. (Laughing.) No accounting for tastes. But, I say, you’d be a
gainer if you dropped the old reputation and gotia new ’un.
Sl. Perhaps so, but old chums don’t like to part so easily. And that
reputation, if it has no other merit, is at least faithful—it won’t leave me.
Bod. Well, have we any chance for a good thing?
Sl. Genius creates it’s own opportunities. I haven’t lived upon my wits
for half a century, and worn my cherished reputation ragged to be beaten
at this pass.
Bod. What’s to be done ?
Sl. We must first reckon up the situation. Flux stands well. He’s to
spend plenty of money. This ouys him plenty of support. And then, what’s
most in his favour, he’s not hampered with any confounded principles or
convictions.
Bod. That’s all in bis favour.
Sl. Of eowrse. Wentworth, with all his wisdom, is a fool. He’s
trusting to conscience rather than cash; ecxpects men to prefer his


principles to their own pockets ; thinks to win with love rather than
money, and is handicapped with prudish notions about integrity. That
sort of nonsense may suit a Sunday-school, but it won’t “gee” on the
hustings.
Bou. He’s as green as
Sl. Green, yes I He believes honesty to be good policy, even in elections.
That sort of ballast would sink a better craft than his.
Bou. Yes; whatever he may know about Parliament, he doesn’t
know how to get there.
Sl. That’s it, Billy. You’ve hit it, my boy. Once in Parliament, he
might talk like a statesman ; but here he’s a political numskull. He hasn’t
learned his electioneering alphabet—how to kiss the dirty-faced little
darlings before their admiring mothers; how to go around the whisky
shops treating the horny-handed sons of toil with outstretched hands, and a
Howdy—howdy—howdy do ?
How’s your wife ? and how are you ?
Ah, it fits my fist as no other can,
Does this horny hand of the working man.
Bou. Ah, Slope, you are up to the tricks of the trade; but that won't
find us the mopusses for this time.
Sl. Perhaps it may.
Bou. How ?
Sl. What do you think of bringing old Leonard out?
Bou. I don’t think that dog will fight.
Sl. Won’t he? He’s got lots of money, and only wants to be asked to
spend it, I fancy.
Bou. Think so ?
Sl. Yes.
Bou. Why ? ,
Sl. Well, you see he subscribed last year to five or six football clubs ;
he sent a donation to the “Australian Natives he joined a Conservative
Association ; and sent a subscription to a Liberal League. A man doesn’t
do these things for love 1
Bou. You’re right there, Slope : but what then ?
Sl. We’ll trot him out. He’ll bleed like a buck.
Bou. Perhaps you're the Wizard of the South, then—sort of Fakir of
Ooloo—got to say, “ Ho, Presto 1” and the thing’s done.
Sl. That’s so, Billy. I’ll show you how I conjure. You shall be my
Sprightly. [ Takes pen and paper, and writes .]
Bou. Going to call him like the old lady called her ducks at Christmas
time—“ Dilly, dilly. dilly—come and be killed ?”
Sl. Right again, Billy. And he’ll come, too. But we won’t kill him—
merely bleed him well. You’ll see. ( Keeps on writing.')
Bou. Yes, we’ll see what we shall see. (Sings) —
I dusted the tables and I scrubbed the floor,
And I polished tip the handle of the big front door.
I polished that handle so carefullee,
That now I’m the ruler of the Queen’s navee.
Sl. Well, Billy, listen to this—
“ Requisition to Lewis Leonard, Esq.
“ We, the undersigned electors of Goalong, having marked your
honourable career as a citizen, and noted the liberality, zeal, earnest-
ness of purpose, and admirable sagacity, which you have brought to
bear upon all movements for the public good, earnestly desire to set
such talents and qualities as you develop in a wider field of action/


and we request that you will permit yourself to he nominated for a
seat in Parliament to fill the present vacancy in this constituency.
Should you, by agreeing to this requisition, add to the obligations you
have conferred upon us, your fellow citizens, w>e will do all in our
power to place you in a posit ion where you may have extended oppor-
tunities of usefulness.
“We are, dear sir," dc., &c., dc.
[Here follow 500 signatures .]
There, Billy! That’s the magic wand. You and I can get the signatures
in a day. The tradesmen will sign it to get old Leonard’s custom. There’s
Imsinqss in it, you see. The thing’s as good as done. What say you ?
Bod. Say I why, that you’re a born genius. You have brass enough for
a Prime Minister, and you can lie well enough for one.
j Si. At any rate, that qualification would come with practice. Being well
paid, I could be ah apt pupil.
Bod. Past practice should make you perfect. But when shall we com-
mence this job ?
Si. In the morning. In the meantime I’ll get a paragraph inserted in
the National Lyre. This will do (writes) —
“ We understand that a requisitionis in course of signature to Mr.
Lewis Leonard, asking him to become a candidate in the present
political contest for Goalong. Mr. Leonard is so highly esteemed as
a citizen that he will command a wide support should he consent to
the prayer of the truthful hut Jlattering requisition."
There (holding up the paragraph) that will put the thing nicely in train.
So now for business. J] Exeunt omnes.
SCENE III.—A beach promenade at Goalong.
Enter Wentworth, with a book.
Went. It hath been written that the power of kings
Is hedged around with a divinity.
But that’s a coinage Of the poet’s brain.
Tis true all power flows from primal sources
In the vast founts around th’ Omniscient Throne
But justifies not regal roguery.
For heaven most blesses that which is most just.
Nor king, nor czar, nor sultan, prelate, pope,
Nor president, nor people’s parliament,
Can find a right divine to wreak a wrong.
No doubt all forms of human government
Must smack of imperfection and defect;
But when I seek where evils grow least rank,
And Freedom’s spreading tree strikes deepest root,
I find it in a pure Democracy. (Traverses the stage in meditation.')
Alas, alas! This, too, is bpt a dream. (Pauses and reads.)
, Though Mill was here a dreamer of that sort.
Earth never knew a pure Democracy,
Nor ever can ’midst ignorance and vice.
. ( Walks down to front, and then with animation.)
Even here, ’neath Austral skies, where heaven looks down
On earth in flush of her virginity—
Even here, the blighting canker of corruption
Preys on the wholesome body of the State,


And taints the commonwealth with fell disease.
Be tills my charge ! Be this my sacred care,
To cauterise the mortifying spot,
Lay bare the wound, and wash the gangrene out.
Let me but gain this people’s suffrages ;
But make this first, this primal footing good,
And I will thunder in the halls of State
In such a sort to scare the robber crew [comes
From their expected prize. [Enter Major b.] But soft! Here
One of the keenest of the nation’s leeches.
He would have speech with me.
Maj. ( Aside ) Now to attack this paragon of virtue. I’ll test his mettle.
(To Wentworth .) Good day, Mr. Wentworth.
Went. Good day, sir.
Maj. I see you wander by the pebbly strand. Do you play the part of
another Demosthenes ?
Went. I am solving a problem.
Maj. CM what nature ?
Went. As to the best mode of despatch for the octopus—the clinging,
strangling, many-suckered devilfish.
Maj. 'Tie a strange study, and out of keeping with a politician’s aims.
Went. Not so. It is a very part of my purpose.
Maj. How so ?
Went. There is a hideous monster of deformity, that has it’s griping,
clinging suckers out —a kind of moral devilfish—that seeks to draw the
nation’s patrimony within the grasp of its most foul embrace. I know it’s
haunts, it’s # ways. I purpose it’s destruction. Does Major Collins under-
stand me ?
Maj. Scarcely ! Yon reason in the clouds — a flight too high for me.
Went. I hope so.
Maj. What do you mean ?
Went. That I am a flight too high for you.
Maj. Your wit is keen.
Went. It has so good a whetstone.
Maj. You mean you sharpen it on me ?
Went. {Bowing.) You are an excellent interpreter. But change the
theme. You sought me ?
Maj. I did.
Went. To what purpose?
Maj. I am the friend of Flux, your opponent,
Went. Well?
Maj. I would desire to be your friend also.
Went. You honour me.
Maj. Nay, it is no conventional compliment. We are both fighting the
same battle; we fly the Liberal flag and strike for public purity. Flux and
yourself have views almost identical. Both of you are brilliant; both are
worthy Parliament; but both cannot sit for Goalong.
Went. I still fail to catch your purpose.
Maj. Well, you see Flux is bound to win this seat; but you make it very
costly to us.
Went. Well, sir, what follows from this?
Maj. Why waste your strength and ours to no purpose 2 Retire, and
the cash we save in fighting out this strife—a thousand pounds—shall be
yours. Were you not one with us in principle, I would not make the offer.
Please understand it so.


Went. Enough ! I have nothing in common with Mr. Flux or hi*
friends. lam not in the market.
Maj. Pardon me. You mistake
Went. I mistake nothing.
Maj. You misjudge a friendly offer. I would not keep you from a seat
in Parliament. I would assist you in the future. Now you cannot win.
Take my present offer, and you save a fruitless contest, much expense, and
ultimate defeat; while you lose nothing.
Went. Except my honor.
Maj. I do not see it so.
Went. I do. Farewell!
Maj. Give me at least a reason for your refusal.
Went. I would have spared you, man ; but you will have it. You are
like the silly bird of the desert: you bury your head in the sand, and think
you are hidden.
Maj. Thanks! Politeness itself!
Went. Why, man, I can read you through and through like a trans-
parency. 1 know the prize for which you play the plunderer. I know the
tools employed to gain that prize. I know the means by which I hope to
check you. Your hopes, your aims, your means, are all to me but as an
ugly blot upon the fair page of democratic government. We have nothing
in common but the form of man—let us part, then.
Maj. I shall not answer harsh words harshly. I will simply say you do
me wrong.
Went. ’Tis then a wrong that does my country right.
Maj. {Aside.) lie has big brave words; so has Flux. I have bought one.
Why not the other ? I’ll try him. {Turning to Wentworth.) Were there
time I could disabuse your hurtful prejudices.
Went. There will not be time from this till doomsday.
Maj. Bethink you well. You cannot win—will you take two thousand
pounds and retire ?
Went. This, sir, is insult. Begone lor {Raises his walkingstick
threateningly, when the Major draws a sword from his cane. Wentworth
strikes it from his hands, forces him out L., and throws his weapon after him.)
And this is public life! This is political purity 1 To be a mark for sordid
souls like this—a butt for venal tempters. Well, well 1 They play for a
high prize. They can bribe high—to carve almost a princedom from the
State, and then secure a quiet title to it. But please the Fates, we’ll
foil them. \_Exit.
Enter Jessie Murray/rom R.
Jessie. {Looking after him, and laughing.) Well now, he did that hand-
somely. But he docs everything handsomely. Oh, I could love him if he’d
let me. But he’s got no eyes for me. He can only dream and talk and
think of May Mercer. I’m sure I like his impudence 1 Talking to me about
her. And yet I like to hear him ; he talks so nicely, so conlidentially. And
yet he hasn’t seen her since he was a boy. 1 thought boys’ love didn’t last
so long. Oh, here he comes!
Re-enter Wentworth.
Went. What, Jessie, you here!
Jes. Yes. Are you afraid of me?
Went. Not so, Jessie. We are well met. I have to tell you news. I
am going to Mr. Mercer’s ball on Friday. 1 shall meet May—l mean Miss
Mercer—for the first time these four years. We were boy and girl when
1 saw her last. 1 was then a student. She was the embodiment of my
boyish dreams. lam afraid I was the subject of her girlhood’s laughter.


JEB. Why don’t you give up thinking of her ?
Went. Can one see the sun and forget the day?
Jes. There are other girls
Went. Other girls! (Observes Jessie's indignation.) I beg your
pardon, my dear Jessie. I mean—l mean —(Approaches her coaxingly.)
Jes. (Sidling up to him.) Well, what do you mean now ?
Went. I mean—that I can't think of any one as I think of her, you
know, Jessie.
Jes. (Starting angrily away.) Well, I’m sure! Then why don’t you
tell her so f Don’t tell me.
Went. I thought you were my dear little friend, Jessie.
Jes. (Mollified.) Well, so I am.
Went. I always loved you, you know, Jessie—like my little sister; but
May is different.
Jes. Why don’t you love May as your little sister, too ?
Went. Because I love her as something else, Jessie.
Jes. And she loves Mr. Foodleton, I think.—Come, take me home; I
want an escort. [Exeunt.
SCENE IV.
May Mercer and Jessie Murray discovered.
May. The cards, Jessie, have all been issued for Friday. Pa intends
the ball to be grand ; but I fear it will be very stupid.
Jus. Why so, my dear May ?
May. Well, you see it’s to be a political ball.
Jus. Well?
May. One r an easily guess what that means.
Jus. What?
May. Why, a host of elderly gentlemen will come to drink wine and
n«iko prosy speeches ; ami not being able to enjoy things themselves, will
be determined to spoil other people’s fun.
Jus. But they will leave Miss Mercer to her favorite Foodleton.
May. So, escaping Scylla, I encounter Charybdis.
Jes. An encounter that generally pleases you.
May. Not a bit, dear Jessie.
Jes. You will have a new admirer in Mr. Wentworth.
May. That were from the frying-pan into the fire.
Jes. I shouldn’t be so hard to please myself. A girl might be very happy
with either were t’other dear charmer away.
May. They say Mr. Wentworth is as handsome as a marble Apollo, and
about as cold—a musty bookworm, a lifeless dreamer.
Jes. Well, if he dreams, he does it wide awake. I think you’ll like him.
May. 1 shall neither like nor dislike him. I shall not allow our ac-
quaintance to extend beyond a bow.
Jes. Why, pray?
May. I can’t endure these prosy speech-makers. Who could take to a
walking book-case?
Jes. (Laughing.') Or an animated encyclopedia ?
May (Laughing.) Whenever I marry, I shall marry a man, and not the
Public Library. (Both laugh.)
Jes. You ( m’t like learning?
May. Not that, and nothing else. Just fancy his highness tete-d-tete.
His talk would be too ravishing. After we had both duly coughed, looked


stupid, and settled the quality of the weather—that of to-day, yesterday,
and the day before, he would delicately enquire if I did not think Adam
Smith perfect in his definition of the relative liabilities of the landlord and
tenant to the State. (Laughs.)
Jes. (Laughing.) Very droll 1 What would you answer?
May. I might explain that I had not quite determined on the merits of
that writer, when he would proceed with the gravest earnestness to assure
me that the analysis of his taxation proposals, tested by the doctrines of
Bastiat and Mill, had quite triumphed over Toryism and Protection. (Both
laugh heartily.) When he had got so far I should politely laugh in his
face, and declare that the price of American consols had been greatly dis-
turbed by the comet, which had captured the great sea serpent, and stolen
its tail. This would entirely settle him, and we should separate with
mutual bows to, and mutual contempt for, each other. [ Knocking.
Jes. Do you expect visitors ?
May. (Hesitating.) Well
Jes. (Slyly.) I see.
Enter servant.
See. Mr. Adolphus Foodlcton, Miss.
May. Show him in. (Exit servant.
Enter Foodleton.
Food. (Bowing with very (esthetic grace.) Ah—my—good fortune is too
distinctly pweeious. I—l—have called, Miss Mercer, about that —social
—nosegay, the tableaux vivants. In fact—l—a—am superbly delighted.
May. (Affectedly.) Really! Is that an ineffable fact? Miss Murray will
share our labours.
Food. Ah, now, that is quite too utterly delightful. Thank you consuracdly.
Quite the—a—thing, you know.
May. (Mimicking.) Certainly ; quite the thing, you know.
Food. Ah, Miss Mercer—ha! hal ha I—you arose cleverly clever—so
delightfully delightful—so—a—so—a—yes! Don’t you think you are ?
May. (Archly.) Oh, yes, weally—so preciously precious—so tooty too,
you know.
Food. (To Jessie.) Do you know, Miss Muwway, I think Miss Mercer is a
—a —a genius ?
Jes. What is that?
Food. Well, —a —it’s—a—don’t you think sheis agenius, though, weally?
May. (Mimics again.) Yea, don’t you, you know, Jessie?
Jes.' But Mr. Foodleton hasn’t told me what a genius is.
May. Oh, I will tell you. A genius is a man too good for this world, and
too great a nuisance for the next ; one who passes Ids life in showing how
much he could have improved things had he been consulted at the Creation
—a clever man, who writes books that no wise man can comprehend ; who
can do everything well except what is useful, and say everything well
except what is wise.
Jes. And is that a genius, Mr. Foodleton ?
Food. I—a—a suppose so. I’m sure Miss Mercer’s a genius, because—
because —I don’t mean to say—to say—she’s unwise ; but I’m a little—
mixed—a—sometimes.
May. (Archly.) Oh, it’s not noticeable in you, Mr. Foodleton.
Food. Ah, that is divinely kind of you; vewy flattewing to the entwanced
heart, you know. Thank you vewy much ; lam superbly delighted.
May. ( With pretended feeling.) Oh!
Food. Your soul, dear Miss Mercer, is too intense. (Aside.) I am afwaid
this—a—is another conquest. I—l—am a sad fellow with the girls. Ha 1


hu! The dear cwcaturos can’t wesist the influence; — (strokes his whiskers
admiringly ) —it’s the style that does it.
May. ( Going to table and taking a packet.) Tills, Mr. Foodleton, contains
the list of the ladies in our piece. ( With n.tteele.) How fortunate you are
to have so many ladies in your keeping !
Food. (Aside.) The poor girl’s jealous. She’s like the west; they can’t
wesist the influence. (Strokes his whiskers pproringly. Then to May) —Yes,
I—l—am fortunate, Miss Mercer ; hut here, you know, I have only their
names, not their.hearts.
May. So you make light, then, of ladies’ names, Mr. Foodleton. Oh, you
naughty, naughty man. Take care you do not tamper with their hearts.
Ueigho ! Think of the power of your —} r our—your (laughing) whiskaw !
Food. Ah, that is—is—is superbly delightful (still caressing his whiskers.)
May. What is ? (Looks at his whiskers and then strokes her own chin) —Oh,
yea, I see. This is delightfully superb.
Food. Quite too divinely wavishing.
May. Ineffably sweet! Ah, sir, such rare conversation as yours, you
know; and such—such— (archly) such whiskaws combined!—What can
poor girls do '!
Food. Well—a—l—l—weally don’t know, you know. It’s—it’s—wather,
bad for the girls, isn’t it ? But a fellow must be agwceable, you know.
May. Oh, yes. A fellow must be agreeable.
Food. (Aside,.) I’d better go before she hooks me. (Looks at his watch.)
I—l—find—Time’s wosy pinion has weached 4.30. Bog pardon, ladies, I
have an engagement at 5.
May. Ah, must you go f
Jes. Yes, must you ?
Food. (Aside.) I knew she meant to capture me. (To ladies.) Well, weally,
it is hard ; but I must. Excuse me, ladies. Ta-ta! (Bows and exit.
May & Jes. (Bowing.) Au revoir, Mr. Foodleton.
Jes. (Laughing heartily.) Oh, May, how could you?
May. (Laughing.) What are fools meant for, Jessie, save for merry girls
to laugh at ? Thai’s what Providence designed them for. And yet he’s not
such a bore as your pedants—your Wentworths—your—your
Jes. You think one a bear, and the other abutterfly. You find the most
attraction in the butterfly.
May. I have small choice between the monster and the insect. (Goes
to piano and sings.) Now, Jessie, let us study our parts in the tableaux. I
question whither any of us study our real characters as much as we do our
assumed ones. [ Exeunt.
SCENE V.—A street in Goalong. Time—Night.
Enter Major.
Major. Wentworth’s drunken brother lives hereabouts. Perhaps I may
reach the politician through the toper. I have a plan which, if it answers,
why, then {Enter Terry O’Toole.] I say, my good man, can you tell
me whereabouts Mr. Wentworth lives ?
Terry. Is it “ Honest Wingy ” ye mane ?
Maj. {Aside.) Curse his “ Honest Wingy.” Even this fellow has caughl
the Wentworth fever. (To Terry.) No, I want f ir. Frederick Wentworth.
Ter. Och, thin, it’s himsilf’s not worth looking for. What the divi.
business would ye have wid a fella like that?
Maj. Do you know where he lives?
Ter. I do.


Maj. Where?
Tkr. The seeond house round the corner (points).
Maj. Thank you. Good night. [Exit.
Ter. (Solus.) Now, what the divil does that fella want wid the masther's
brother? There’s mischief brewing—Terry, hould yer whist! (Scratches
his head.) What does it mane ? That fella’s Flux’s best man. Mick
Doolan did be seeing the masther send him off this morning wid a flea in
his ear. Now he wants the masther’s brother. Terry, ye divil! kape y&r
eyes wide open, and thry if an Irish boy can’t outskame the skamer. [Exit.
SCENE VI—Fred. Wentworth's sitting-room.
Papers lying about. Glasses , bottles and books in confusion. Fred, discovered
contentedly smoking.
Fred. Confound fiis impudence. Wants his bill paid. Scarcely £2O,
and not six months due. 11a ! ha! ha! I think a tailor should feel lucky
if he gets his money in twelve months, or even at all, for that matter.
(Prinks.') Why, no tailor with a well regulated mind would demand cash
from me. He gives mo credit, and Ido credit to his skill, so we are quits.
That man must be mercenary to want both cash and credit. Now it would
do violence to my conscience to encourage mercenary qualities in a man.
For that reason, I cannot pay my tailor. If I pull oif the big double
[.Knocking heard at door.] Come in.
Enter Major.
Major. Good evening, my dear Wentworth.
Fr. What, Major Collins! Here at this time? Then there’s some new
game afoot.
Maj. There is.
Fr. What is it ?
Maj. I think a profitable one.
Fr. (Pushing across bottle.) I drink to that prediction. Be seated. But
I would rather you came with a profit than as a prophet.
Maj. As it happens I come in both capacities.
Fr. Speak, then, 0 profitable seer.
Maj. Well, then—your brother cannot possibly win the seat he is going
for. That is the prophecy ; now for the profit from it. You see, though
he can’t win, he can put us to much trouble and expense. I want him to
retire ; but he’s stubborn. I have come to show yon how yon can serve
him, yourself, and us, all by one meritorious action.
Fli. Explain, 0 mighty prophet. (Drinks.) Help yourself.
Maj. Thanks. (Drinks.) Well then, there’s no doubt that Wingfield is a
splendid fellow.
Fr. There needs no ghost, my lord, to tell us that.
Maj. True, that’s the preface. He is generous to a fault : high notions
of honor, ami all that. I would like to serve him ; but he is very self-
willed.
Fr. More matter, and less art.—Hamlet.
Maj. Well, he has pledged himself to this contest, and he’ll go through
and lose his money to no purpose rather than yield to circumstances. You
can save him.
Fr. Drop conundrums, and explain.
Maj. A little ruse. It is merely a pious fraud to turn his own good heart to
Ids own advantage. You must ace him; tell him you nr.: in trouble—that you
have discounted a forged bill for one thousand pounds, trusting to a turf
transaction to square things ; that the horses went wrong on the Derby ; and


that on Friday next, when the bill matures, you will be exposed, your billot
lost, yourself in prison, and he disgraced. Tell him your greatest trouble
is the stain it puts upon him.
Fb. This is very like asking me to play the scoundrel to your villain.
Perhaps lam fitted for the part; I’m sure you are. But how will this help
things? Wingfield has no money.
Maj. Just so j but I will offer him a £IOOO to withdraw. He’ll get the
money to save you, and will really save himself, you see. Now, is not the
scheme benevolent as well as wise ?
Fb. It is certainly as wise as a sepent; but not quite as harmless as a
dove. (Pause* and drinks.) It’s a fraud on poor Wingy.
Maj. True ; but it is a fraud that will serve and not injure him; it
will save him useless expense and an unpleasant defeat. I’ll give you £2OO
down for your part of it.
Fb. Is my brother bound to lose ?
Maj. Undoubtedly.
Fb. Then I’ll do it; but you must pay me £SOO for the job—£2oo down.
Maj. It’s too much.
Fb. Is it ? Am I to play the scoundrel for a song ? lam for sale—
perhaps all men are; —but I fix my own price.
Maj. Well, well! (Takes out cheque-book and writes.) Judas sold his
master for thirty pieces of silver; you for selling your brother will get
fifteen hundred pieces of gold.
Fb. True. I shall have no reason to hang myself in disgust over the
transaction.
Maj. Certainly not You merely save your worthy brother. Good night 1
Let me hear from you to-morrow. [Exit.
Fb. Well, now, this is a windfall—better than when Shadow landed me
the big double which just saved me last year. [Knocking.] Who’s this?
Come in 1
Enter Tebby.
Terry. (Aside.) I must sound this fellah ! (To Fred.) Good avenin’ to
ye, Misther Fred I
Fb. Well, Teny, what have you come to say ?
Ter. (Aside.) How will I get at him ? (To Fred.) What am I come for,
is it? Not much, sir ; on’y I’m throubled—l think the masther’s goin’ to
withdraw—to send in his resignation.
Fr. (Starting hurriedly.) You don’t mean that, Terry? That’ll spoil my
game. (Looks confused.)
Ter. ( Very innocently.) What game, sir ?
Fr. Ah—a—a —nothing—only—I bet a tenner that he’d beat Flux.
(Pauses.) Why, Major Collins said he would not withdraw on any account.
Ter. I)id the Major tell you that, sir ? How could he know ?
Fr. My brother told him.
Ter. (Aside.) I shmell a mouse. (To Fred.) So the Major wants him
out of the field, sir ?
Fb. If your master has determined to withdraw, don’t let the Major
know of it. '
Teb. No, sir. But why, if ye plaze ?
Fr. Well—a—I—a—the Major would give a good sum to get him to with-
draw. I’d like to secure that money before your master’s intention is known.
Ter. Just so, sir; you are a ’cute bhoy I Good night, sir 1
Fr. Good night. Tell your master I am in trouble, and am coming
to see him.
Ter. Yes, sir. • [Exit.


Fr. Now Fortune’s in her smiling mood. Now is the time to woo her,
before she chahges. ;; So, then, to play the knave 1 [Exit.
SCENE VII.—A room in Wentworth’s house.
Wentworth discovered pacing the room.
Went. 0, what a timorous being is this love !
I, that can meet the worst despite of man
Without a tremor ; face hard fate with boldness ;
And, smiling, look upon the world’s fierce frown—
Grow lily-livered dreaming of a woman.
Aye! ’tis this course of dreaming that unmans me.
I’ve compassed years in doating on her name.
Her memory has been a sanctuary,
Where my devoted heart retired to worship.
My' every step in life—the midnight hours
Spent over musty tomes ; the thankless toil ;
The slow preferment, and the tardy prize ;
Were brightened with the sunbeam of my love.
The star of hope illumed life’s dimmest path,
Till even drudgery became sublime.
I thought of her dear face, and heaviest toils
Grew lightsome; dreaming that she smiled, earth laughed.
And now I am to meet her in the flush
And majesty of more than regal beauty.
Why marvel at the riot in my pulse?
Mine is a noble game—the stakes are high—
The prizes, Rosy Love and Shining Honor—
A lady’s heart the one—a people’s choice the other.
I ne’er have fawned upon this sovereign people,
Nbr bowed me to their weakness or their pride.
And yet I’d love to gain their honest loves—
Perchance a step to her far dearer love.
But I’ll not work a wrong to win them o’er,
’Tis true to-day, as the old Roman found—
Great men full oft will praise the madding crowd
Who never loved them. Coriolanus spoke
The naked truth, but said it all too haughtily,
'' When he declared about the people’s suffrage—
lie that depends
Upon your favors swims with fins of lead,
And hews down oaks with rushes.
With every minute yon do change your mind,
And call him noble that was now your hate,
Him vile that was your garland.
What matter! Right is right! My guiding star
Is Justice. [Knocking ; enter Fred.
What! Fred! You have another grief, 1 hear.
Unfold it. Is another wager lost ?
Fr. Oh, lam come to take your curse. lam ruined with a ruin that must
drag you down, my dearest brother.
Went. Why, Fred, what mean these wild words ?
Fr. 0! Tis a horrid tale—a Wentworth’s infamy. And yet 1 could have
borne it, but for the stain it fixes upon you.
Went. If this is not the damned babbling of the wine-cup, apeak, man !


Fb. Dear brother, do not crush me yet, though I must bear your curse
for evermore.
Went. Death and Hades !—will you explain ?
Fb. lam a forger—on the eve of detection. This is the last night the
world will know me for on honest man. Some months since, grown
desperate with my losses, and needing cash for further chances to recoup
myself, I forged an honored name to a bill and discounted it. The cash I
risked on the last Derby. It was my last chance ; —I lost.
West. Great heavens ! Can this be ?
Fr. I cannot tell you of my whole despair —of friends, repute, and
hope—all staked and squandered. I left the course and reached the town
a wreck. I ask no pity—l deserve none. Dear brother, I will not even ask
your pardon. (Winks.) I come to say farewell! I cannot face the
damning blot!—Farewell!
Went. (In agony.) 0 God! This is terrible! At one stroke from the
pinnacle of hope to the deep black gulf of despair. (Pauses, and then with
passion.) 0 wretch! No brother thou! Could brother murder thus a
I brother’s life ? No ; thou art not of kin with me! Though nourished at the
self-same breast, and fondled by one mother, thou art a cursed alien to ray
blood. (Pauses again.) Oh !—oh I—brother !—brother ! Yes—yet he
is a brother.
Fb. I’ll not be long so.
Went. What, coward, would’st thou do ? Self-destruction ? Pshaw !
’Tis the last refuge of the currish spirit. The manly heart that dares do evil
will brave the consequences ; but the poltroon, stooping to crime, shrinks
from it’s penalty, and hides his craven carcase in the river’s slime —a fitting
sepulchre. At least, man, if you be a villain, face it like a villain—boldly.
(Pauses.) Ah, me! Thy crime hath struck most deeply on the innocent.
Like a sirocco’s blast, it has withered all the green hopes of my life.
Fr. ’Tis true, my brother. Your reproach is just. (Aside.) Poor devil!
I’m not quite fitted yet to play the villain.
Went. 0, malice of Fortune ! What have I done to bo encompassed
thus ? 0 Fred! my brother! my child’s playmate! You have
crushed—not my life ; that were nothing ; —but—you have crushed out
honor, truth, and —and—love—my boyhood’s dream—my manhood’s hope!
Oh—oh ! (Buries his face in his hands in agony.) Still, I must save you.
It must be done. The sacrifice must bo made. Go to your home!—There,
speak not a word 1 To-morrow you will have the money to redeem that
evidence of your crime.
Fb. How, brother ? Tell me.
Went. Say not a word ; but go! [Exit Fred.
Oh, this is the very top of Fortune’s spite!
Hemmed in—cut off—and girt around by Fate—
I have no path to walk in save Dishonor’s.
Foulness coops mo round. (Goes to table, writes, and then rings.)
Enter Terry.
Take this to Major Collins. See it safe.
Teb. I will, sir. [Exit.
Went. That letter stamps the seal on my despair.
Farewell to all my budding hopes of fame !
Farewell the noble strife, th’ exalted aims,
The fair-won laurel, and the patriot’s crown.
And, oh ! with these—adieu to that bright dream
Of golden texture that enriched my life
With Love’s delicious glory. [JSletf.


ACT 11.
SCENE I. —A tavern parlor.
Terry and Fred. discovered drinking. .
Tan. That’s thrue for ye, sir. The masther’s moighty lamed ; but he
can’t coax the people like that fellah, Flux.
Fit. ( Hiccoughs.) And you think ho can’t win the seat, Terry ?
Tun. Win, is it, sir? He can win when the four queens beat the four
aces. His friends, sir, ought to advise him.
Fit. You’re a sons’ble man, Terry.
Teu. {With naive dignity.) You’re a very disarniu’gintleman, sir.
Fit. {hiccoughs.) You think I am Terry ?
Teh. Sure of it, sir. {Winks.)
Fit. Well, yes, 1 agree with you, Terry.
Ter. That shows you're a sensible man, sir.
Kit. H’m ! All right! So you think I’d be right, Terry, in getting
Wingy—l mean your master—out of the field.
Teu. I do, sir.
Fr. So do I; — {hiccoughs) —and I’ve done it.
Ter. How, sir ?
Fr. Never you mind.
Teu. Begorra, you’re clever, sir. I didn’t belave the ould bhoy himsilf
con M move the masther.
Fr. He could’nt either. But I did. I beat the devil with the scheme
I had.
Ter. Faith 1 Ye must have been the devil’s own shkamer. Ye ought
to he in Parliament, sir. Sorra the sowl there would bate ye.
Fred. {Complacently.) Well, Terry, I don’t think they would be more
difficult to manage than my creditors. {Drinks.)
Ter. But—glory to ye, sir—how did ye get over the masther? Ye must
have had a droll plan;
Fred. I don’t know about the drollery. It was deuced clever. Few
fellows could have done it. The Major planned it; but {proudly) J’m
the artist.
Ter. {Aside.) Be jabers ! it’s coming. Just as I thought. {To Fred.J
I understand, sir. He gave you the rough sketch, and you filled in the
picture. Anybody can form a plan, but it takes talent to carry it out.
Fred. {Drinks. Aside.) This Terry is a smart fellow.
Ter. The Major thinks himself a great bhoy ; but he couldn’t have done
much without you, sir.
Fred. That’s true, Terry. But it was pretty rough work. (Drinks.) I
toid poor Wing. I was a forger. It almost choked him. I knew he could
get the money to save me. The Major had offered him a “ thou.” to with-
draw. I was sure he’d do it; and I was right. (Drinks.) What he
wouldn’t take for himself, he took for mo.
Ter. It was a capital plan, sir. It was very ’cute of the major, and very
clever of you, sir ; but wasn’t it good of the masther ?
Fred. So it was, Terry. Wingy always was a splendid fellow. {Sottishly.)
I’m half sorry I deceived him, though it’s for his own good.
Ter. Yes, sir! Ye’re right, sir ! It’s a pity to desave a brother that’s so
kind. He must be very fond of ye, sir.


Fred. So he is, Terry. He is—a— (maudlin). I feel like a confounded
scoundrel. i
Teh. I wouldn’t say that, sir. But ye're a little aisy-like—good natured,
you know.
Fked. Yes; that’s your Irish way of describing a fraud. (Drinks.)
Tek. But ye neiet meant to wrong the masther, ye know, sir. And if
ye tould him all about it, he’d never say a cross word to ye.
, Fred. ( Sottishly .) I’ve a mind to make a clean breast of the whole thing.
Ter. God bless ye, sir. Av ye do, it’ll aise the masther’s heart to know
ye haven’t done the bad thing ye said, sir. He’s greatly throubled. He’d
give his eyes for ye, sir.
Fred. I can’t cheat Wingy. (Maudlin.) Poor Wingy! Good old
Wingy ! Yes, I’ll go and tell him.
Ter. (Aside.) I’ve got him right now. (Aloud.) Come away, sir. [Exeunt.
SCENE II.—A room in Francis Murray’s house.
Enter Murray and Wentworth.
' Went. Yes, it may be weak. It lacks a Spartan spirit;—l grant it. But
I could never rear a head dishonored. A brother’s fraud reflects upon a
brother.
Mur. But why take such a course ?
Went. It seemed my only one. What a future for Fred ! A convict
in prison 1 The danger was imminent—the means of escape were at hand.
I seized them. The Major has my letter accepting his terms.
Mdr. ’Twas very rash. And a rush act will be punished bitterly. Men
will judge you very harshly. You retire in a great emergency. The
explanation is “family reasons.” “Family reasons” will have a very
suspicious sound. My poor Wentworth ! You have struck yourself more
deeply than you know.
Went. 1 feel it all. My reasons can’t be known ;
And mystery will always seem suspicious. (Pauses.)
0 ! at the best, we are but airy bubbles,
Floating awhile upon Life’s heaving ocean,’
Till driving winds or rising waves shall break us.
My fate was of the shortest. My life’s bubble—
A fleeting foam-flake—sinks again from sight,
Absorbed into the level human ocean.
And yet there travails in me what can move
Millions of human bubbles like to me—
A power that, working out the ends of Destiny,
Might plant its milestones on the course of thought.
Perchance I act too little—think too much.
Haply I am a dreamer ; but those dreams
May startle yet the world with their realities,
[Knockin//.'] Enter Terry.
Ter. Here’s a bhoy, sir, wid a budget of good news. I’ve brought him
to tell it himself.
Went. Who is it, Terry ?
Enter Fred., very unsteadily.
Fr. It’s I, Wing, my boy. I’m going to make a clean breast of it to you.
(Seeing Mr. Murray about to retire ) —No, sir, don’t go. You’re Wingfield’s
friend. That’s more than I am—eh, Terry ?
Ter. Tell your story, man. We’ll talk about the plot afther.


■ Fr. Yes, the plot! It was a plot, Wing. It was a bit clever, but deuced
mean, you know. I feel it—l do, by Jove! I don’t like acting shabbily
by you, and I’ve done it. Though, upon my soul, I did it for your good as
well as my own.
Went, Come to the point. What have you done, Fred?
Fr. Played the rogue !
Went. Of that you told me before. »
• Fr. I did. You see there were a lot of us—all wanting something which
we couldn’t get. You wanted to get into Parliament, and I knew you
couldn’t. The Major wanted to get you out of the field, and he couldn’t.
I wanted to get cash, and I couldn’t.
Went. & Mur. Well, well!
Fr. Well; we were all checkmated.
Went. What then ?
Fr. Why, then the Major showed me how two of us might get what we
wanted, without harming the other.
Went. Yes ! What did he tell you ?
Fr. That he could find mo cash, while I could free Flux from his rival.
Went. & Mur. Ah 1
Fr. Yes. I’d only got to toll a fib, and the thing was done. A good
round lie did the whole business. Pity we can’t get on, you know,
without lying ; but we can’t. A lie sometimes comes in deuced handy.
It did with me.
Went. What have you done or said ?
Fr. I told you I had forged a man’s name for a thousand, and that only
the money could save me. I knew you had been offered and had refused that
money. But I knew you were real grit, and would get it for me. So you
did. v You simply sold out of a losing business. The Major paid the money.
I got it. You lost nothing; Collins gained his point; and I collared the
“ sugar.” [Murray and Terry convene.
1 Went. (Pace* the stage in great agitation. Then he suddenly stops before
Fred.) Look you,—l am dangerous ! As you live, speak truly. Have you
told mo all ?
• Fr. {With a tremor). Yes—yes—my dear Wing.—everything. {Aside.)
I begin to wish I hadn’t told him anything.
Went. 0, this from a brother! {Paces the stage again, and again stops
before. Fred.) 0, what a tiling to claim my kinship—infamous! A sot, a
tool, a drivelling liar—a foul and filthy patch for man’s contempt.
Mur. Tis a cruel blow! Now bring forth all your best philosophy.
Ward Fortune’s shafts of spite with stoic shield. Fred, tell us what induced
this confession. .. , i. ..
Fred. I—l—don’t know. I think Terry did it. He talked the matter
over with me, and I felt mean in selling Wingfield. So—so I thought I'd
let it all.out. .u .
Went. How came you, Terry, to know about this villainy?
Ter. Well, sir, I got it a bit at a time, as the divil gets the lawyers. I
suspected that fellow Collins for a scamp, so I did.
Went. Why, Terry ?
Ter. Why, is it, sir ? Well, afther the snub ye gave him on the beach,
I knew there was a good bit of the divil in him.
Went. How did you know that, Terry?
Ter. I knew it was in, because it didn’t come out, sir. Ye see, a proper
sort of a gintleman would have kicked up a bit of diversion, and had his
satisfaction put o’ ye.. But he took it quietly, like all the wicked ones.
Went. Is that your theory, Terry ?


Ter. Yes, sir, and when I seed him aftherwards prowling about Misther
Fred’s place, I said to myself—Terry, said I, what’s that mane ? Have
your eyes open for mischief, said I. Ye see, sir, I’m in thraining for the
detective foorce. So I foileyed it up, and found it was tempting Misther
Fred to some villainy he was. And so —(winks) —and so—and so I watched
and shpoiled his fun, the blackguard.
Went. Ah, Murray, how blind I was. With all my knowledge, I saw
less than this honest fellow. Terry woul;l have saved me, but I made him
the means of my own undoing. He carried to Collins my letter of resigna-
tion. But for that letter this damnable conspiracy would have been foiled.
Ter. Begor, then sir, it is foiled and shpoiled entirely ; for here’s your
letter that’s niver left my hands.
Went. (Eagerly takes letter.) What, you retained it, Terry ?
Ter. Yes, sir. Ye see, sir, I’m your retainer.
Mur. Bravo, Terry ! (Slaps his shoulders.) You’ll make a model detec-
tive.
Ter. Thank ye, sir. I had an inkling of the game, and I thought it
betther to hould back my thrump card till the last thrick, ye see, sir.
W ENT. (Handing letter to Murray.) lam saved—by a miracle.
Ter. (Naively) Beg pardon, sir, I’m not exactly a murracle.
Went. (Smiling.) I didn’t moan you, Terry.
Ter. Didn’t ye, sir ? Well, then, ye have a short memory.
Went. You are right, my good Terry. So I had. I was saved, not by a
miracle, but by a keen Irish wit, linked to a faithful Irish heart.
Ter. (Slyly.) Ah, ye’re practising for Parliament, sir.
Mur. No, my good fellow. This gentleman was betrayed by the very
goodness of his own heart. Your shrewd wit and tact have saved him for
his country’s good. I shall not fail to remember your services in the proper
time, believe me.
Went. Nor I, Terry.
Ter. Thank ye, gintlemen. Then I’m as good as in the detective foorce.
[.Exeunt Wentworth and Murray.
And then, Terry, my boy, you must trust to your own cuteness. I’ll just
keep my hand in practice by watching these political dodgers. (To Fred.)
Come on, sir. [ Exeunt omnes.
SCENE III.-A conservatory at Mercer’s house.
Enter Mercer and Foodleton.
Mer. They say Wentworth’s popularity is growing.
Food. lam vewy glad of it, sir. Politics are not beautiful; but such
men as he invest them with woiinoment.
Mer. Yes. He’ll be here to-night.
Food. What! Mr. Wentworth at a ball! I—a—a—thought ho was too
—a —a —superbly pwaotical to —a —a —

“ A little nonsense now and then
Is relished by the wisest men.”
The bow cannot be always bent.
Food. Yjust so! Your illustwations are —are —a —a supwemely
superb. Inaukyou vewy much. [ Enter May.] Ah, lam unspeakably
delighted, Miss Mercer. Celestially aesthetic as over.
May. ( Affecting an diathetic style.) Thanks for your too sweet enquiry.
(To her papa.) Mr. Murray and Jessie have just arrived, papa.
Mer. Very well, my dear. I’ll bring them to you directly. (Exit.


Food. ( [Aside .) Sweet cweature! That was a superbly clever move of
hers to get wid of the old gentleman. Her vewy soul has gone out to
mine. She adores me. When girls are fond of a fellah, they—a—a—got
vewy—a —a—cawessingly soft. (To May.) Don’t—a—you—a—think-
dies Mercer—that—a—that —a—a —it was a vewy fine morning ?
Mat. Yes—a—it is not so warm now as wh en the weather was hotter,
yon know, Mr. Foodleton.
Food. Vewy twue. Vewy twue. Thank yau—thank you vewy ranch.
I—a—am —a —a —superbly delighted. Have ywu seen the gweat genius,
Mr. Wentworth, Miss Mercer ?
May. Not yet had that honor, sir.
Food. Ah. they say he is vewy handsome, but a wegular bore, you know.
No style—no conversation suited to ladies.
Mat. (Archly.) We should not expect him to be so brilliant as Mr.
Foodleton is ; but then you know few can he.
Food. Ah, thanks —thanks—thank you vewy much. I am afwaid you
make fun of my earnest yearning style, you know.
Mat. Ah, can you think so?
Food. Well—a—a —
May. Yes—a —a —oh (Enter Jessie Murray.] My darling Jessie!
gtisses her.) You look, as Mr. Foodleton would say, msthetically delight-
- 1; transcendentally beautiful, ineffably lovely—quite too—too intensely
utter.
Jes. Ah, dear, May, you tease me (looking at Foodleton) because I dis-
turbed your tete-d-tete.
Mat. I assure you, Jessie, my darling, you rescued us from quite an
embarrassment. Mr. Foodleton and I did not l«iow what to say to each
other.
Food. Thank you, Miss Muwway. Thank you vewy much. I am—a—
superbly delighted to meet you. Ah—we were—a—saying—a—a—ha Iha 1
ha 1 Stwange 1 I forget what we were saying—weally I
Mat. (Laughing.) You hear, Jessie, how little this gentleman thinks of
his conversation with me that he forgets it a moment after. Now isn’t
that too distinctly pwecious 1
Enter Mdbbay and Wentwobth, announced.
Murray. Ah, Miss Mercer, I needn’t ask if you are quite well. Your
looks speak for you. Pray let me make known to you my friend, Mr.
Wentworth. He tells me you have met before.
[They how, and Wentworth crosses over and speaks with Jessie.
Mat. I am afraid, Mr. Murray, your friend will be an ogre to frivolous
beings like me. Is he very frigid ?
Mub. Just the reverse, Miss Mercer. He has one of the warmest souls
in the world. But he has the worst fault a man can have in the eyes of a
lady.
Mat. Pray, what is that ?
Mdb. He is rather shy.
Mat. You are quite right, Mr. Murray. Few girls will own il candidly
But it’s true. A bashful man is a monster.
Food. Ha 1 ha 1 ha! I’m vewy delighted that I’m not bashful. (Laughs
daintUy.) [Exit Wentwobth and Jessie.
Mat. No, Mr- Foodleton is too conscious of his extreme fasckiating
power. (Looks slyly at Murray.) He is too clever to be bashful. Cons-
cious merit, yon know —a—a — (Music heard.) But I think the dancing is
about commencing, I see Mr. Wentworth has carried oflf Jessie.


Mur. Perhaps, my dear young lady, you will permit me to carry you off.
[They how and exit Murray and May.
Food. Ha! ha! ha I They’ve all left me. I—l—suppose I must cawwy
off myself. I'm superbly delighted that no girl has yet cawwied me off.
By Jove I (Laughs in a self-satisfied way.) They all twy it; but I’m too
pwudent to commit myself. The dear cweatures all bait their hooks for me ;
but! only nibble, I—l—never bite. I yearn forthe Elysian fields of love—
not for the fleshly ties of mawwiage. I’m afwaid Miss Mercer is getting too
fond of me altogether. [Exit.
Enter Terry, mimicking Foodleton.
Terry. Phafs that? Is it alive? (Mimics.) I hope it’s tame, and
won’t bite. , Begor, perhaps it’s got away from its keepers. Well, now, I
must go and help the'girls to a bit cf a frolic in the kitchen. The masther
saysivery man’s aquil. Faith, some’s more than aquil. So we must have our
own share of the frolic. [Exit.
SCENE IV.—A garden landscape view at Mercer’s
house.
Enter May, from L.
• t May. It’s very singular that to others Mr. Wentworth grows quite
affable, while to me he is distant politeness itself. At least he might re-
member that I am! his host’s daughter, b I «iwe not a pin for his attentions;
but I like proper respect.' That is my duo. if he acted thus to vex me, I
wouldn’t mind ; but he seems scarcely to recognise my existence. To be
quietly ignored is to me a new sensation. Of - 'course, when he meets me,
he Aas to be a gentleman; but he always has some polite excuse for
leaving me directly. He must be a milk and watery character. And as
fori his; looks, that they all praise so much, I fail to perceive the Adonis in
them-,/Of course he’s fine, and T expect he knows it. He has a sort of
air that makes you look at him a second time. When he was narrating that
amusing anecdote of the Bishop and the cat to Miss Swiedells, his face
seemed quite ifluihined with a sort Why, here he comes. ( Steps aside.)
Enter Wentworth from R., smoking.
Went. The night is lovely 1 ,’Tis such a night as''Byron sung of, when
“ Lads on shore may sigh and maids believe.” Egad, if T sigh at all, just
now,’it's 'for a ■ quiet ■'cigar. (I‘ufi's.) There is an incense floating on the
breath of might that sheds new perfume on the fragrant zephyrs. (Seats
himself.) And yet that one fair face makes a fool of my philosophy. She
avoids me; that’s'clear. And. I’m not the man to thrust myself on the
daughter of a millionaire. lam too poor to be anything but proud ; and
heiresses find better game than poverty. Once she was not all selfish.
She had a shining soul ; and for her body, I would not have it fairer lest
the angels might be jealous of earth’s treasure, and snatch it hence. (Looks
mil.sees May, grows confused , and ceases to smoke.) I would ask your pardon
for this intrusion, but that my trespass is quite accidental. I trust you
y.vill acquit me of what were else an impertinence.
May. lam sure, Mr. Wentworth, papa expects you to make yourself quite
at home. I pray you will resume your cigar. I suppose the night tempted
on, as it did me ? And well it might 1
Went.. You ar* but just, while you are generous, Miss Mercer. You have
guessed aright >


May. You prefer your own company to that of the ladies.
Went. The human mind is a strange-study. . Even in things beautiful,
it is still not content, but seeks variety. I left the glowing beauty of the
ball-room to look awhile upon a colder, calmer, but not less glittering
beauty. (Points to the sky.)
May. That is not a gallant sentiment, sir.
Went. No, perhaps.
May. You love not gallantry.
Went. Yes, but I reverence Truth more.
May. Then you must be a marvel for a man.
Went. I am sorry for your acquaintances
May. Why?
Went. That you regard truth in them as a miracle.
May. Yet so it is.
Went. The indictment is a heavy one.
May. I am afraid it is borne very lightly by your fellow lords of creation,
Mr. Wentworth.
Went. Perhaps because unfairness ceases to be harsh in so fair an accuser.
May. Now you play the courtier.
Went. Without violating truth, then.
May. Better and better, or worse and worse.
Went. Do not wittingly choose “ worse” when there is a “ better.”
May. I’ll take your advice, and if I err you’ll be “ abettor” of my error.
I will believe you sincere.
Went. I’ll not deceive a trusting maid.
May. And so is your fame by your own report made fair.
Went. As report makes your own fame, fair maid.
May. I cannot match you in a war of words. I was a little venturesome
to try.
Went. If, lady, you will match me in the coming waltz as mettlesome as
you have matched my speech, I shall be richly mated.
May. I thank you very much, but there I am mated already.
Went. And so you cry me checkmate, and I lose my game.
Mat. (Laughing.) Nay, your knight shall carry off a fairer queen. Come,
I’ll introduce you.
Went. Thank you, I will not dance.
May. Nay, do. There is a regal waltzer in the room.
Went. But if she is royal, I should not be loyal, find so the pairing would
be bad. Would it be rude to ask who is your partner ?
May. Mr. Foodleton is.
Went. Badly coupled also.
May. Why?
Went. The waltz is the poetry of motion. Your partner being merely
limbs and whiskers, knows nothing of poetry. You will dance with soul—
he merely with body. Therefore you are ill-matched.
May. One soul and one body—surely that is a match through fill human
nature. Your own illustration condemns you.
Went. Pardon mo. It is no match when the body understands not the
soul. In such unions they wear out each other. I have seen spirits dialing
in their bodies as in a prison. They were joined, but not mated. So are
you find your partner.
May. You are a Daniel come to judgment.
Went. Then should I have judgment enough not to detain you from the
music and the dance. Will you permit me to escort you into the ball-room ?
May. Thank you. [ Exeunt.


SCENE V.—A street in Goalong.
The walls well placarded. Enter Terry.
Ter. Well, thedivil’s having a field day wid lyin’; for the walls of the
town are all covered wid his villainy. Here’s a concoction about the
mas tlier—
“ Sing a song of Wentworth, with pockets full of tin.
Four and twenty landsharhs hacking him to win.
W/ten the ballot's opened another tune he'll sing,
For he is not the dainty dish the voters think the thing,
lie fawns on kings of counting-houses counting up their money ;
He cringes in bank parlours with words as sweet as homy.
But for men who work in corduroys, or sweat in fustian clothes,
He's quite too fine a gentleman, and turns up his nose.”
Now that’s a great big dirty black lie, so it is. That’s the doings of that
fella Shlope. And the father of lies ought to bo proud of his son. There’s
sorra a bit of villainy that’s to be done for a dirty five-pun’-note, but what
that fella’s got a pen ready for the work. He’s a bit of a newspaper man,
too. Begor, if the Press isn’t ashamed of itself, it ought to be ashamed of
some of its tools. Now, here’s a chap, this Shlope, bad luck to him, with not
enough reputation to get him credit for a noggin of whisky—a fella that’s
tried everything, and failed at everything but villainy—at everything,
from floating bogus companies to makin’ a shillin’ book on the races—turns
his hand at last to running rich candidates and blackguarding their op-
opponents for money. And he finds a printing press to back him. The
big bugs make fine speeches about the liberty of the press, and all that.
That means the liberty to print a single lie ten thousand times, and make
it travel half round the counthry before the truth can as much as put its
boots on to folley it. That’s what Mr. Shlope does at election times, and
that’s what the National Lyre does every day. I wish the people wouldn’t
be mindin’ either of ’em. [Exit.
SCENE Vl.-Interior of Goalong Town Hall.
Wiggins (Ret. Off.) discovered on dais, with Wentworth. Flux, Leonard,
and a number of electors on either side of him. Stage full of electors.
Wiggins. Gentlemen. It—um—becomes my dooty to —a —infonn you
—um —that—um—that there are three candidates—ura—nominated—that
is—a nominated for a—a —a single vacancy—um —in this constitooency.
{Cheers.)
Ist Cit. Let’s have’em all. {Laughter.)
2nd Cit. No fear ; one rogue’s too many.
Wig. Order, gentlemen ! I shall—um—take a poll on Tuesday next.
The—a—names of the—ura—candidates are {taking up nomination jmpers)
—are —a —Verbose Flux, general agent; Lewis Leonard, gentleman; Wing-
field Wentworth, journalist. I shall now—um—invite—um—the candidates
to address you in—um—their alphabetical order —um —as stated. {Cheers.)
3rd Cit. Begor, the fust shall he last. We have the Scripture for that.
{Laughter.)
Flux. {Stepping forward.) Gentlemen
Ist Cit. Oe lang wid your flummery. We’re no gintlemin.
2nd Cit. Speak for yourself, and you’re right.
Fldx. Electors and free burgesses of Goalong. Were this a period of
political calm—[lst Cit. So it is.] —a time of peace, progress, and pros


perity—l should scarcely care to throw myself into the turmoil of this
contest. [Cheers, and 3rd Cit. Nobody axes you.] But I venture to say
we are almost face to face with a great crisis. [lst Cit. Where is it f 2nd
Cjt. He’s got it in his pocket .] The enemies of the people have been
gathering to a head —[lst Cit. That's an ould tale. ( Laughter .)] —and they
have mustered all their strength on this occasion to defeat the cause
of patriotism in my overthrow. [Cheers.] I might almost declare, in the
words of the great Pitt—England’s most splendid modern patriot—that
“ this is a perilous and tremendous moment.” The foul forces of corrup-
tion are leagued together. The citadel of the State is in danger. The rich
monopolist stands ready with raised heel to plant his foot upon the neck of
honest labour. Shall the crime be consummated ? [lst Cit. No, no. 2nd
Cit. Never I never! NEVER!] Then help me to defeat the criminals.
[Cries of “We will, we will."] If ye have the freeborn blood of the sturdy
Britons coursing in your veins, you will all—with one tremendous ciy that
shall rise in Qoalong and echo through all Victoria—shout an indignant
denial of the right of the purse-proud slaves of mammon to tamper with one
tittle of your glorious privileges—with one iota of your claims to perfect
human equality. [Loud and prolonged cheering.] I, gentlemen, represent
you in that proud boast. I care not if the man has piled up hie gold in
heaps as high as Egypt’s pyramids—( looking meaningly at Leonara). He
is but a man after all ; and as a man no whit better, or more respectable,
or more honorable, than the lowliest man in this free community. [Tre-
mendous cheering.] And I care not, if in the pride of knowledge, a man
has pored over books—( looking meaningly at Wentworth) —till he has
grown drunk with the conceit of his own cleverness—with the conviction
that he is the sole embodiment of wisdom—he, in his haughty pride and
self-sufficiency, is even less respectable than the unpretending poor but
honest man, of whom it has been said, in language that is immortal —“ An
honest man’s the noblest work of God.” Gentlemen, these are the senti-
ments of my heart. Will you enable me to speak those sentiments in
Parliament, as your true servant ? [Deafening cheers.]
Ist Cit. Oily gammon !
3rd Cit. It’s soft-sawder he’s giving yez.
Wig. Mr. Leonard, gentlemen.
Leo. Gentlemen—l—er—
-2nd Cit. Speak up.
Leo. I—er—er-r—er-r-r—l do not on this occasion—[2nd Cit. Who
S’-id you did? {Laughter.)] —that is— l —er —cannot pretend—[2ndCit.
We don't want pretenders.] —l cannot claim to —er —on this occasion—to
speak—with—er—that is—to be—a—good speaker. [Hear, hear.]
2nd Cit. 0, yes you are. [Laughter.]
Wig. Order, Gentlemen!
Leo. But—er—er-r—er-r-r—on this account — [Laughter] —I—a—h’m —
know my way about. [Hear, hear. 2nd Cit. And how the land lies.] l—
er- -have looked after my own—er —affairs, and—er—er-r—er-r-r—l have
made money, and—er—l know how to keep it. [Laughter.] Ne—er —I
—er —mean I know how to spend it. [Cheers. 2nd Cit. Til help you.]
Gentlemen —er —er-r —er-r-r —on this occasion I have proved that—a—l
know how to mind my own business. [lst Cit. Look after No. I, eh .*]
That—er —would show I can mind yours. [Cheers.]
3rd Cit. We want a man—not a money-bag. [Laughter.]
Wh. Mr. Wentworth will now address you, gentlemen. [ Cheers.]
Went. Mr. Returning Officer and gentlemen—
There was one of old who said, in words still new,


“ If I glorify myself my glory
Is nothing.” So say I now to you.
What if I laud my virtue, and proclaim
Myself,the friend of this man, or of that—
Freedom’s lover—champion of the poor?
What will it prove, but that I am a boaster? [ Much applause .]
Will you appraise me as I rate myself,
And take me simply for my virtuous seeming ? [ Much applause .]
Brave words should not pass current for high deeds.
The devil can quote Scripture, and the rogue
Can plume himself in garb of honesty. [ More applause.']
This note, I pray you, when the fawner’s voice
In sleek and oily words shall cozen you. [More applause.] j
The flatterer flatters only to betray. '*
For when did Truth assume the courtier’s dress,
And teach poor man that he is like to God ?
1 could not teach ray tongue such foul dishonor.
Nor wrong your better senses. [More applause.] Perhaps you ask,
How can we tell a flatterer from a friend.*
Why, here’s a sure and ready recipe—
The patriot pleads wistful for the people :
The demagogue ( looking meaningly at Flux) pleads wistful to
the people. [Deafening cheers.]
Apply this test, good friends, and you may oft
Save the abused State from harpies’ claws
That clutch her very vitals. lon this
Will touch more nearly at another time,
When I will tear the mask from Robbery’s face,
Unveil Corruption to the eye of day,
And show the hideous plot that’s ripening (
To trick the public treasure from the State. [Cheers. j •
Oh, there be fawning knaves with velvet tongues,
Who babble of the dignity of manhood,
Who, had they but a window in their breasts,
Would stand revealed—the nation’s cut-purses.
The game’s afoot, and I have marked the quarry. [ Cheers .]
I’d put a whip in every honest hand
To lash the rascals naked round the world.
[Cheers and waving of hats in great glee.]
Ist Cit. I want to ax Mr. Flux a question.
Fl. I shall be happy to reply.
Ist Cit. Ar’n’t you paid by a landshark? [Another elector rises and
knocks down the questioner from behind.]
Wig. Does any other gentleman want to “ ax” a question ?
Scene closes amidst laughter.
SCENE VII.—A hotel parlor in Goalong.
Enter Slope, who commences writing.
Slope. (Looking up after a pause.) This Wentworth must be checked,
'i ,ie people begin to throw their caps for him. I’ll fire a shot that’ll bring
him clown. ( Writes again.)
Enter Bounce.
Bou. Eh, Sharkie 1 I was looking for you.
Sl. And, finding me, for what am I worth the finding?


Boc. Are you good for a rattling squib against Wentworth ?
Sl. Cash can command, and I obey.
Bou. Leonard will be ready with a fiver if you hit Wentworth between
wind and water.
Sl. A fiver be—blest 1 I don’t work for fivers at election times. My
squib will cost him £2O, and be cheap at the money. Here it is. {Reads.)
“A Slanderer of the People 1
“ Insulting the Electors to their Faces 1
“ Mr. Wentworth’s Nomination Speech !
“Arethe Electors of Goalong slaves that they are openly flouted bj 1
a nominee of wealth? Does Mr. Wentworth think there is no man-
hood but in money-bags, that he dared to give a slap to the faces of
the poor by such words as these—
“ I would not proclaim myself the friend of this man nor of that ;
nor Freedom’s lover, nor champion of the poor. /am no fawner on
the vulgar fry. Nor sleekly cozen the poor and ignorant; nor
teach the poor man to he like his betters. I'd rather pul a whip in
every rich man's hand to lash the ragged rascals round the world.
“Electors of Goalong! Are ye freemen? Will ye tolerate this
impertinent coxcomb? Let us drown his insulting voice in our
indignation I Let him be met and hooted down from every platform.
(Signed) “ A Poor Man who heard him.’’
Bou. This would be prime, only it isn’t true.
Sl. So much the better. Ha! ha! ha! 1 wouldn't degrade my vocation
by telling the truth at election times.
Bou. Except when truth happens to pay best.
Sl. Of course. See I Here’s another choice little bit—
Question —What should a poor man’s wages bo ?
(See the following extract from Mr. Wentworth’s speech, as reported in the
National Lyre.)
“He thought that any working man might live in a tent, and keep
himself on ss. a week."
“ Let such a man have the votes of the bloated capitalists ; but the poor
man’s vote — Never, Never, NEVER!”
There, Billy, I think that ought to fetch ’em.
Bou. Yes, it’s the best kind of lie. It looks like the truth.
Sl. Leonard ought to come down handsome.
Bou. So he will! So he will!
Sl. Here! (Givespaper.) Tell him I’ll have a copy of this published
in the National Lyre :—
“ We understand that Mr. Wentworth's impudent declaration that a poor
man should live in a tent on ss. per week, or be whipped as a ragged
rascal around the toim, has much pleased the wealthy lower orders. If
the rich man's vote can put him in he will be the member for Goalong;
but toe very much question if the manhood of that constituency will
bs thus grossly ins. died by an upstart whose unlimited pretensions are
bached only by his ability to make a bad translation of a Greek ode ”
Bou. Capital I Ci pital! That’ll work him.
Sl. I think so. Taey’ll roar him down.
Bou. Why, you’re a patent gagger.
Sl. It’s the only way to settle him. Let’s away to the printer. [Exeunt.


SCENE VIII.—A garden walk at Mercer’s house.
Enter MAY.
Mat. I would roundly laugh at myself, but that my laugh fades int®
a sigh. And why do I sigh ? lam very sure lam not in love; and ye t
I’m not the reckless May of old. I don’t know why I find myself thinking
so much of Mr. Wentworth. (Laughs.) If my case were that of another,
I’d declare it was love ; but I know it isn’t. I suppose I may say that,for
the first time I have been really interested. I could not be less —and
I would not be more. He never sought my favor, and I am not likely to
give it unasked. Still, 1 think of him. He talks well, and he says things
one can remember. lam afraid that perhaps I think more of him than he
does of me. (Laughs.) And yet he praised me. But he did it with the air
of a connoiseur bestowing judgment—unlike the general compliments of
men—the more to be remembered. But, withal, he holds aloof from me.
He was impatient to end even our first interview, when I wished to linger
and listen to the sparkle of his tongue. Bah ! I am not wise to waste a
thought upon him, but cannot choose; for thoughts will come unbid. I
would certainly rather have his good word than the homage of twenty
meaner men. But ’tis not love ; ’tis merely admiration. If ever he loves
his love will be ambition. And I—heigho! I think I never shall love
at all. r Exit.
SCENE IX.—A market place.
Slope and Bcdnce discovered amongst a crowd of citizens.
Sl. This Wentworth is as haughty as the devil. I felt my anger growing
as I heard him.
Ist Cit. You heard him then ?
Sl. 1 heard him say the very words. He spoke of us with such contempt
as if he were a god and we but foulest carrion.
2nd Cit. He’d better look out.
3rd Cit. We’ll show him something.
4th Cit. Perhaps there’s some mistake. It would be fair to hear what
he has to say before we condemn him.
3rd Cit. Did he show us fair play when he called us ragged rascals ?
2nd Cit. Or when he said we should all live in a tent?
Ist Cit. Yes, an’ on five bob a week ?
4th Cit. Perhaps he’ll deny it. Fair play’s a jewel.
Ist Cit. But he said he’d whip us round the world.
2nd Cit. Whip us, indeed! Let him look out for himself.
Sl. ( Aside to Bounce.) It works like a charm.
Bod. It does so.
3rd Cit. We’ll hoot him off the platform. 4
4th Cit. But first question him why he spoke so foully of us, and hear
his answer. Then judge him.
Ist Cit. What can he answer?
4th Cit. That we have to learn.
2nd Cit. We’ll hoot him down without a word.
All. So wo will.
4th Cit. But should he not have said it ?
Ist Cit. Here are men who heard him.
2nd Cit. Besides, it’s printed in the National Lyre.
Sl. & Bod. It’s true.


Ist Cit. He’s the rich man’s friend.
3rd Cit. He’s the poor man’s enemy.
Enter Wentworth.
All. (Groaning.) Shame!
Wentworth stands surprised, then hows, and exit while the crowd hoot and
groan him as he retires.
ACT III.
SCENE I.—Mr. Mercer’s parlour.
Enter May.
Mat. They say the fickle crowd have turned against him.
May Fortune, then, desert them in their need ;
For he is just the goodliest man withal
That Nature ever moulded as their friend.
He bears the stamp and mint-mark of a gentleman.
If ever I resigned my maiden fancy
Into the keeping of a son of Adam,
Twonld be to such a one, if that there bo
On this bare earth another like to him.
Here comes his most ridiculous opposite. [Enter Foodlbton.
Most fairly welcome, Mr. Foodleton.
Food. Good evening, Miss Mercer. Thanks! Thanks, vewy much. I
I am superb
Mat. Tea, I know. As usual you are superbly delighted. You must
enjoy life very mneh.
Food. Snpwemely so I Likeadweam! But why?
Mat. Because you are in a state of permanent ccstacy and superb delight.
Food. Ha! ha! ha! Vewy clevaw! Just so! Yes! By the bye,
ah—you—ah—have heard of Sir.—Wentworth’s misfortune ?
Mat ( 'Eagerly .) Misfortune! What ?
Food. O, the people all set against him. Old Spindlecrank alone has got
all his hands—lso of ’em—to desert Wentworth.
May. Why is this ?
Food. Well—a —you see—l—a—don’t understand politics. They say
he insulted the soveweign people.
May. And well he might, but that I know he did not.
Food. Beg pardon, Miss Mercer! Yon—a—know?
May, Yes, for papa brought home the true report of the very speech that
they have falsified.
Food, Ah 1 So they—a—pwevawicated, eh ?
Max (Eagerly.) No! They basely slandered him to lie him down. (Turns
away exeiletlly , and then, recollecting herself, returns, assuming an easy
manner.) Ha! ha! ha ! I have a mind to try and baffle them just for
aninsement. Will you help me? It would be great fun to play at politics ?
Food, Ye-e-s! But how?
Mat. Well, let us think. Invention aid me. (Pauses) Can’t we com-
mence with Mr. Spindlecrank ?


Food. Yes—yes—delighted? But what is the plot?
May. Well, we must gain back Mr. Spindlecrank.
Food. Yes, that’s sweetly delicious 1 But how is it to be done?
May. You must leave that to me. In the meantime, tell him about jtho
vile conspiracy that has been formed to lie Mr. Wentworth down.
Food. Oh yes ; that’s supwemely simple.
May. Yes, but Mr. Spindlecrank is an honest credulous man. He has been
deceived. He will be glad to be undeceived. Show him this true report of
Mr. Wentworth’s speech. That is your part in the first act of the play. I
will show you the second act to-morrow.
Food. Now, that is justintensly utterly superb.
May. See Mr. Spindlecrank at once.
Food. Yes; thank you—thank you vewy much. I am twanscendantly
gwatified. My part doesn’t want much study. (Laughs.) I only appear
in one scene.
May. That is all. Don’t miss your cue. *
Food. My cue I Ah—my cue is Chpid. That's vewy good!
May. No, your cue is Spindlecrank. Good-bye 1
Food. Ha!—eh?
May. Good-bye 1
Food, What! Commence the play now 1
May. (Nodding.) Good-bye. [Exit Food.] Now I’ll drop a letter to
poor dear old Mr. Spindlecrank. (Writes and folds letter and rings.) John,
take this letter to Mr. Spindlecrank. - [Exit.
SCENE II.—A Street.
Enter Lokolands, Major Collins and Flux.
Maj. I think I’ve done the trick at last.
Flux. How?
Maj. We wanted just another hundred votes to make us safe.
Long. Well?
Maj. We couldn’t get ’em. So I’ve just put away a hundred and thirty
of Wentworth’s men
Flux. “ Put away !’’ That’s a suspicious term. If you’ve killed the foe
before the fight why that’s prudence ; but don’t make us accessories after
the fact.
Long. 11a I ha! ha! How have you managed it, Collins ?
Maj. 0, very simply Fverything is simple to genius. I first tried ’em.
They wouldn’t come over to us at any price The villains were poor, but
stuhhorh. Hut there are more ways than one of killing a cat. I got a
labor agent to engage ’em for a month to work on your station fifty miles
away He told 'em the work was urgent —must be done before shearing.
He gave ’em double pay. Hut the fellows smelt a rat, and wouldn't go
without the money being paid down in advance. 1 consented, and the

Maj. Yes ; but buying ’em off is the next best thing to buying ’em over.
We can now tot up a majority.
Flux. Good 1 You won the fort. Mind you hoid it.
Maj. Trust me for that. Come along! [Exeunt.
Enter Tkrry.
Teh. Will ye, thin. Faith, we’ll see. (Shaking his fist.) You’re the
divil’s own smart bhoys entirely. (Stands watching them.) I think


Ould Nick would be puzzled to tell which of ye should have the first dip

a contest some day, down below. (Points down.) And it s Prime Minister
ye ought to be whin ye get there. But ye’re just a little out of yeer
reckoning here, my bould bhoy, and so we’ll thry and show yez. \Exit.
SCENE III:—A parlor in Mercer’s house.
Enter Spindlecrank, shown in by servant.
Spin. And bo I’m to come to tea, eh? It was just the prettiest little
note in the world. (Meads.) “ Come early, and then we can have a little chat,
like old times." Now, that’s very cordial. She knows I’m fond of her
still. Who knows I Perhaps she has thought better of me since her last
refusal. Any way, she’s a fine frank girl ; and I’m not the man to disap-
point her.
Enter May.
May. (Cordially) Good day, Mr. Spindlecrank. I am very glad to see
you. It was very kind of you to come.
Spin. No, Miss Mercer. It was very kind of you to think of me.
May, I always think of my real friends. Pa was asking a couple of
friends, so I thought yon would like to meet them.
Spin. Any friends of yours, dear Miss Mercer, always.
May. Thank you. There’s only one of them whom I can call a friend of
mine—Mr. Murray. The other is Mr. Wentworth, whom I have only seen
once since he was a boy But he is a friend of pa’s and Mr. Murray’s. So
you will be all friends, I suppose.
Spin. (Uneasily.) Well, 1 don’t know, I have been opposing Mr.
Wentworth.
May So they said. But pa thought you had been deceived ; and I
thought you had since been undeceived. Do you know, Mr. Spindlecrank,
1 feel quite interested about this Mr.—Mr.—Mr.—Went—Wenthouse.
Spin Mr Went worth
May 1 beg pardon. Yes, Mr. WentwortA.
Spin What is the cause of this interest, Miss Mercer?
May Well, you know, they’ve told such wicked stories about him. So
pa says. Have you not heard of them ?
Spin. Well, yes ; but
May. So, you know, 1 hope he’ll get in just to vex story-tellers. Truth
ought to win, you know
Spin Yes, but
May Yes, and falsehood ought to be punished, yon were going to say.
So it does You'll help pa, won’t you, Mr. Spindlecrank (cnaxmgly.)
Spin (Aside.) I'm in a fix. I've committed myself on the other side.
No doubt Wentworth lias been belied, and be is the true man. Still I’ll be
railed at right and left if I changed now (To May.) Well, Miss Mercer
May Ah, Mr, Spindlecrank, it’s the first thing 1 ever asked of you ; and
I wouldn’t ask this, but that I know you are good, and you like to serve
the true cause
Spin. (Aside.) Who the deuce could resist that? /couldn’t. (To May.)
My dear Miss Mercer, you shall not ask me in vain to do that which is right.
May. Ah, thank you. sir. You are always safe in following vour own
good heart
Spin. I would rather follow yours


"Mat. (A tide .) In following Mr. Wentworth, I think he does so.
[Bell rings.'] Enter Merger, Wentworth, and Murray.
Mer. Ah, Mr. Spindlecrank. I am pleased to see you I Let me present
you. ( Introduces all the gentlemen, who shake hands all round. Then to
May, taking her aside.) This is well managed, my darling May. Is the
honest old fellow friendly yet ?
May. Yes, pa. But can he recall his friends?
Mer. Most of them. They were loth to believe the falsehood, 'fhey
are glad to learn the truth. But how comes it that my child is so much
interested in politics ?
Mat. To baffle falsehood, papa.
Mer. And on behalf of a handsome young fellow—eh ?
May. ( Roguishly.) Well, you know, papa, good looks go a long way—
with girls.
r Mer. I fear not that they will ever go too far with my darling child.
( Tams to company.) Gentlemen, we will go in to tea. Mr. Wentworth, I
learn that you have got a new canvasser in Miss Mercer.
Spin, An 4 a successful one, I assure you, sir.
[Exeunt Mercer, Spindlecrank, and Murray.
Went. (Bowing to May.) lam much beholden. Canvassing is a tedious
labour, Miss Mercer.
May. Very tedious—tiresome, indeed.
Went. To what then am I indebted for the pains of my fair canvasser.
May. (Archly.) We must endure much at election times, you know, Mr.
Wentworth.
Went. Voluntary martyrdom, I should hope.
May. Oh, yes. I had an old friend, Mr. Spindlecrank, who had been
embittered against you by a falsehood. I undeceived him ; that is all.
Went. And that is much—very much.
May. (Pertly.) But I did not do it for you. I did it because I hats
trickery.
Went. The motive is still more honorable to you. Well, at least if I
have tough enemies, I have also warm and dear friends; and it is very
much to me that I rank Miss Mercer amongst the number.
May. Perhaps you are premature in that conclusion.
Went. You know the proverb—“ Actions speak louder than words.” I
will gladly take your friendly deeds against your half-unfriendly words,
and count the balance much in my favour.
May. You are sanguine.
Went. I am, and you give me a new motive to be so.
May. Then, as the poet hath it—“ What great events from trivial causes
spring."
Went. I was not aware that Mies Mercer studied Homer.
May. Nor do I. I have but few of learning’s wares; but like some of
your literary men, I keep them all in the window for display.
Went. Then instead of burying your talent, you turn it to compound
interest.
May. Does Mr. Wentworth stoop to flattery ?
Went. Believe me, dear lady, fewer evils spring from praise than from
excessive cavil. Truth suffers more from the Cynic than from the Syco-
phant. It was Lavater who said—“ Trust him little who praises all, him
less who censures all." If I must err, I'd rather err in charity than envy.
Mat. Well answered, Mr, Political Philosopher 1 I have a woman's
interest in your conflict I wish you victory, yet know not why.


Went. You give me a new motive for success. But I would hope that
in your kind regard the politician does not quite eclipse the man.
May. A philosopher should divine the answer to such a question.
Went, /cannot. •
Mat. Then I must doubt your philosophy.
Went. Be it so, fair sceptic. But tell me what a true philosopher should
be able to divine.
May. That to a lady the man makes the politician, and not the politician
the man.
Went. I bless my lucky dulness that hath evoked such a bright ex-
pounder.
Mat. Fie! Mr. Wentworth, the brilliant politician, charmed with his
own dulness 1 You prefer to be the cloud rathqr than the sun I
Went. Say, rather, lady—content to follow in the orbit of a brighter
sun (bowing).
Re-enter Murray.
Mdb. I have just received a note that hurries our departure, Miss Mercer.
My dear Wentworth, wo must go. You have to “woo the sweet voices,”
lest they croak a harsh tune to you on polling day. You mutt have a talk
with Mr. Stout, of the Licensed Victuallers, and that before your meeting
this evening. It is equally necessary that you should spend a few minutes
with Messrs. Dewdrop and Cordial, of the Good Templars.
Went. lam at your service and theirs. .
Mur. Miss Mercer, I regret this hurried leave-taking.
Went. Believe me, dear Miss Mercer, I am much strengthened by your
cordial •sympathy. Adieu! (Exeunt Wentworth and Murray.
May. (Walks up stage, returns, and then looks after Wentworth.) He is
gone, and the room seems empty to me. Can it be that he carries my heart
with him ? Is this love ? I know not. Am I a captive ? I, who have
lightly laughed off all the curled darlings of society—am I to strike my
triumphant colors to the despised bookworm ? And strike them unasked ?
And yet—and yet —Oh, I seem to glory in my weakness. There is a tell-
tale rapture in my bosom as I recall his words, his looks, that is not born to
die. Though but of yesterday, it seems a spark immortal as the soul.
(Traverses the stage, and stops as before.) Till now, I never knew life’s
loveliest joy. A new existence beams upon me. I cannot misconstrue this
lesson of my heart. (Pauses in agitation.) 0, 1 love him! I love him!
I love him with a rapture worthy even him, who is worthy of all things.
And should he never know, or seek to know, my love itself will all suffice
itself. [ Knocking .
Enter Terry.
Terry. Beg pardon, Miss, I came to ax if you knew where Mr. Went-
worth had gone from here ?
May. No, my good man. Are you his friend ?
Ter. I’m his retainer, Miss.
May. Then you are an honest man. Here, spend this gold in your
master’s cause.
Ter. Faith, I will, Miss. God bless your good heart for the masther.
I’m sure he’s in love. I wish it was wid you, Miss, axing your pardon for
the bouldness.
May (Startled). Do not tell him I gave you the money.
Ter. Never fear. Good bye, Miss. [Exit.
May (Solus). And so this man—this prince of manhood —loves another!
And she ? 0, she must doat upon him! And ypt she cannot feel—can
never feel—such love as mine, 0, but to love himithus and lose him ! To


think of him going, with all his great wealth of soul, to another! It. is,
torture! Rapture and torture! Is love then made of such a compound i
Why is lihis rapture dashed with this torture ? How quickly am I unde-
ceived in thinking love can satisfy itself! (Pauses.) And yet he spoke
to me kindly, almost tenderly. Sweet, sweet love! 0,1 will think sweet
things, ahd dream dear dreams of elysium. [Goes to piano and sings first
verse of “ Scenes that are brightest." Then rises and exit.
SCENE IV.—A street.
Enter Slope and Bounce.
v ßounqe. Leonard’s up a tree. (Laughs.}
Slope. Of course. Just as we expected, eh? (Laughs.}
Bou. Still he has answered well.
Sl. Yes, answered our calls on his breeches pocket. They say that
Wentworth comes up smiling after my shot. .
Bou I dunno! Flux’s oily gammon goes a long way. Why, one of
Wentworth’s men told me that he went to hear Flux last night, and was
almost-talked, over before he left.
Sl. Yes, Billy, at election times the proverb is reversed. Speech is
golden—silence silvern.
Bou. Silver! ’Tain’t worth a copper!
Sl. Speech is brass; and that’s the genuine metal.
Bou. How shall we let down Leonard easy ?
Sl. Oh, it doesn’t matter about him now. He’s dry. He has had his fun
for his money ; we’ve been paid, and nobody’s a bit the worse, while the
country will gain his .£5O deposit. So in bringing him out we’ve “ done
the State some service.”
Bou. But he takes his lickin’ like a bird.
Sl. Yes, just like a plucked pigeon. (Both laugh.)
Bou. You seem to make a good crow over it. (Laughs.)
Sl. Not so. My trade is a hawker’s. I note my game, and trust to my
talons to win it. [ Exeunt , laughing.
SCENE V.—A country place.
Enter Terry and Jacob, hooted and spurred,
Terry. Yes, but are the bhoys all on the way, Jacob?
Jabob. I dinks so.
Ter. ’Tisn’t “ thinks ” I want from yez. Will they be here in time ?

SCENE VI.—Interior of Goalong Town Hall.
A crowd of citizens discovered. Enter Wiggins, Wentworth, Flox, and
Leonard.
Wig. Gentlemen—[ cheers ] —attention, please. [Criesof“ Order I" " Shut

I Went. (Rising.) [Cheers renewed .] Gentlemen. In this my hour of
splendid triumph, I cannot trust myself to give full expression to the
tumultuous feelings of my overcharged heart. [Cheers.] But my every
pulse throbs its thanks to the majority, who have this day made me
'member for Goalong. [Cheers.] But from this day lam the servant of
you all—of those who worked for me and those who worked against me.
[Cheers?] I will know no undue favours, even to friends; but I will
know justice to all. [Cheers.] My time, ray poor talents, my best efforts,
my most active energies, are now the property of my country. I will
'strive to be a true political friend, a consistent opponent, a vigilant servant
of the State, a self-forgetful patriot—but a determined uncompromising foe
Ito chicane. [Cheers.] In Parliament, gentlemen, I shall make some
■ enemies. In the country I shall make some enemies. This I know and
foresee. But I will not make an enemy of any man who is not first an
enemy of the nation. [Cheers.] I will not promise great achievements.
I will make no brilliant forecasts. The future is not in my keeping. But
'this with a free full heart I gladly say—Every opportunity shall be
' improved, and I will always account my best endeavours but a poor return
for what you have done for me. I ask you to thank the Returning Officer.
[Tremendous cheering.]
Ist Cit. Listen to Misther Flux.
Flox. I am defeated ; but the country’s defeated with me.
Ist Cit. The shquatters, ye mane.
Flux. To me, gentlemen, it is a small matter—a trivial thing. But I
grieve with my country that trickery has triumphed. [Cheers.] My sole
regret is for the people. For myself I rejoice, /shall have rest instead
of wearing out my iron frame in harrassing nights and laborious days.
But if the time shall ever come when the tyranny of wealth shall arouse
the people to madness—if the last resort is to be broken heads and flaming
houses—remember, that when I would have trampled down wealth under
the heel of authority, when I would have laid my hand upon the
throat of capital, you were foolish and faithless to your cause, and you
! would not. Farewell! My heart will ever beat responsive to the great
heart of the people. [6 beers.]


Ist Cit. Your’e beat now by the great heart of the people. ( Laughter.)
W lO. Mr. Leonard will—urn—return thanks.
Leon. No, sir, I won’t! [ Laughter .] I—a—have nothing—er—to—

SCENE VII. —A street in Goalong.
Enter Wentworth and Terry.
Ter. Yes, it was great fun, sir. We just let the Major into his own
thrap.
Went. How was that, Terry?
Ter. Ye see sir, we knew he was full of shkames, and we had to watch
him. It took us all our time, and it got tiring loike to do nothing else than
watch a chap like him.
Went. I should think so, Terry.
Ter. When wo heard he was going to hire the men to go up the couuthry,
we fell in with the plan, and got the men quickly .ll to hire on double pay,
paid down. When the Major had got rid of them he was aisy wid hie
shkaming, and that gave us a rest, ye see. When he thought he had ’em
all safe he didn’t need watching.
Went. You are quite a tactician, Terry.
Ter. That’s a gintleman’s name for a shkamer, isn’t it, sir ?
Went. (Laughing.') I am afraid it is, Terry.
Ter. Well, sir, set a shkamer to catch ashkamef. We knew how to get
the men back right enough.
Went. Very good, Terry! But as this matter was your doing, I am
anxious to know where you got the money to pay for it.
Ter. That’s a sacret, sir.
Went. Surely not from me, Terry.
Ter. Yes, sir. Ye see whin the colleen gave me the money
wistful like, and said, “ Don't tell your matther I gave it." Av coorse I said,
“ No, Miss Mercer." And so my honor’s at stake, and I couldn’t tell ye, sir.
Went. (Laughing.) Very well, Terry, keep your secret. I won’t press
you. Now go and release Widow Maloney’s cow.
Ter. Yes, sir. And the baste’ll be obliged to ye. (Exit.
Went. So May Mercer spends money secretly to promote my return.
That at least argues delicacy. It cannot be that she is the frivolous being

SCENE VIII.—A parlour in Mercer's house.
May and Foodleton seated in front ; Wentworth and Mercer in earnest
converse at rear. ‘ •
Food. I—a—assure you—a —Miss Mercer—a—it’s quite twue. A
bachelor’s life is gay, but—but—it’s—it’s not vewy delightful.
May. If that be the rule, Mr. Foodleton must be the exception.
Food. (Aside.) The dear cweature loves me. It’s the style that kills.
(Strokes his ichislcers caressingly. Then to May) —Why, Miss Mercer, do
you think I am the exception ?
May. The goddess Fortune smiles on you, and all other ladies do the
same.
Food. (A side.) She’s a little jealous. But—but—that’s all the better. It’s
my wule to make all the ladies jealous. But, weally, she is charming. She
knows how to appweciate a fellah. If—if—a—l was a mawwying man
I’d take her. But it’s too absurd, weally, to think of Adolphus Foodleton
descen—descending fwom his pwoper spheah—a spheah of lovely ladies—
and—and languid poetwy —to have—a—a wife—and—babies—and pwaps
wheel a pewambulator. (To May.) Ah, you know, Miss Mercer, somebody
has said—a—a—All that—a—that —a —is gold—a—something about—a
—a —glitters. I forget the—a—the words.
May. “ All that glitters is not gold !”
Food. Ye-s. Ye-s. That’s a happy thought. It’s my case, you know.
(Aside.) She’s a fine girl 1 Im half tempted to mawwy her. I would
only for the sacwifice.
May. (With mimic sympathy.) Ah poor fellow! Is your.poor heart
seared by some secret grief ?
Food. (Aside.) Now isn’t that smpwemely superb. (To May.) Why
—a —no—not exactly, Miss Mercer. The fact is—a—a (Aside.) She’s
almost worth the sacwifice.
May (Very tenderly.) Yes, Mr. Foodleton, the fact is
Food. (Aside.) By Jove I think I’ll make her happy. (To May.) Yes
—Yes, Miss Mercer, I’m—l’m about tired of single life.
May. (Shyly.) Then why not make some poor girl happy.
Food. (Aside.) There it is! She will have me! Well, she is worthy
of me. I’ll do—do—it. I shouldn’t wonder if she faints with
joy—or—or—some confounded thing of the sort. Girls are so vewy
gwateful. (To May.) Make some poor girl happy, you say, Miss Mercer.
Yes—that’s it. I—a—a —want—don’t be fluwwied—l want to —a —make
you happy, you know. (Beams on her.)
Mat. (Roguishly.) Really, you confuse me, Mr Foodleton.
Food. Yes, I—a—thought I did. A little pleasant surpwise for you, you
know. A little sudden, of course! Sudden—a—joy makes one feel—a
stwange, does’nt it ? But you’ll soon—you’ll soon —get used to it.
May. (Simulating coyness.) Ah, think of the sacrifice you are making,
Mr. Foodleton.
Food. Yes 1 I thought of that ! But a — a — man — a man must sacwifice
something! Oh yes, I’ll do it. Don’t mind me! Besides, it’s not so
much, you know. You’re—you’re wich, and vewy pwetty, weally!
May. Ah you are too generous. I could not impose on good nature.
You are too, too, utterly intensely too.
Food Yes, hut then I shall have to—a—mawwy someone some day, I
suppose.
May. This is what I have never even hoped for. i
Food. So I suppose. But Ido not consider the sacwifice too gweat.


May. Can you consider me worthy of such an honour ?
Food. Thank you. I shall be superbly delighted, weally, quite as much
so as yourself. It is twue I did not intend to mawwy; but on the whole
I don’t think I can do better.
Mat. But stay, I cannot accept this sacrifice. You are reckless in your
good nature. You do not rate yourself as I rate you, Mr. Foodleton, or you
would not have made such a proposal to me.
Food. (Aside.) She doats on me. Sweet cweachaw I {To May.) Ah,
you—a —think too—a much of me, Miss Mercer, and too little of yourself.
May. Ido not think so. I know you better than you know yourself.
Food. But you—a —are too sweetly partial—a—to me.
Mat. No, 1 thoroughly understand what your merits are; but I cannot
accept your offer.
Food But can you weally wefuse me ?
May Really I can. Such is my self-denial.
Food. I didn’t think it possible. (Aside.) She thinks herself unworthy
of me. But that—a—makes her more worthy. I’ll still make the deah
cweachaw happy ! (To Mercer.) Could you a—a —spare me—a —a —few
minutes, Mr. Mercer ?
Meb. (Coming down stage.) Certainly.
Went. (Coming over to May.) Will you take a turn in the garden,
Miss Mercer?
Mat. With pleasure. [Exeunt May and Wentworth.
Food. I—l—have pwoposed to your daughter!
Meb. Proposed what?
Food. Mawwiage!
Meb. Indeed I
Food. Ye-es!
Meb. Well?
Food. She —a —she—a didn’t take me !
Meb. No! Well?
Food. But—a—weally—a—you don’t seem astonished !
Meb. Not much! You see ladies can’t recognise real merit.
Food. 0 yes, they can. She wecognises it too much. Miss Mercer thinks
me too good. She won’t let me sacwifice myself.
Meb. (Aside.) I see I May has been fooling the fool. I might as well
play it out (To Foodleton.) I think my daughter has properly estimated
your merits, Mr. Foodleton. Come I will explain to you as we go down
the street [ Exeunt Meeceb and Foodleton.
SCENE IX.—A garden at Mercer’s.
Enter Wentworth aw? May.
Went. What you have said will make me live anew.
Ah, dearest May, there is an empire in
Your love, and you have given me sovereignty.
Mat. Then love is like to mercy—doubly blest
It blesses her that gives, and him that takes.
So speaks my happy heart.
words, dear May, will quicken in my soul,
And stir me to all possibilities.
Beaconsfield spoke wisdom when he said—
“A man may have ambition to be great,
But only woman’s help can make him so.”


The bright illumination of your love
Makes humdrum earth a cheerful world to'me. (Embraces her.)
May (Clasps his neck.) 0, this is rapture 1 I—l—speech is drowned—
Drowned in a flood of joy 1 I love—and am—beloved!
Went. 0, yes, beloved love 1 Seraphic painter!
That lends rose-tinted dreams of hope to life,
And blends Romance with hard reality—
Thou teachest more than my philosophy—
That man alone is stunted in his nature.
His holier founts of being dry their springs,
And ’midst his mental treasures, pile on pile,
His soul is but a desert.
But tell me, dearest Alay, by what blest chance
The treasured casket of your love hath kept
Its seal unbroken thro’ Life’s gaudy scenes,
To open out its bliss to poor, poor me,
Who never knew the way to ladies’ favors ?
May. Ah, who can trace the workings of the heart ?
Who can unfold the subtle course of Fate ?
It seems to me a dream—a bright, bright dream,
But that my happy heart proclaims it real.
You ask me why I love you, dearest love ?
.Love himself would rightly stamp me loveless
If, knowing thee, I failed to worship thee.
The butterflies of fashion—what are they?
They have amused me, made me smile full oft;
But never yet they made me think or feel.
And till a woman feels, she cannot love.
Went. Thank Destiny, that turned your soul to me.
May. I heard your name, and with it came aversion.
I linked it with an image unlike yours.
I saw you—heard you. First, you startled me ;
Next, gained my interest. Then you slighted me,
Or so I deemed. It piqued me to resentment
Yet still you chained my thoughts for good or ill.
Dhconsciously you’caused and cured my pique.
1 heard the world had basely slandered you.
I pitied you. How near to Love is Pity 1
Went, if Pity lead to may Love still lead to Pity.
May. Before I knew, my heart flew out to yours,
And yet methojight I craved no like return.
Went. Why, dearest? Tell me why.
May. Nay, I know not, save that in the first
Full rapturous spring-flood of the virgin heart,
Just as the mother gushes o’er her babe,.
Nor seeks return, so the rapt soul of love
Cap live upon itself, nor crave external nurture.
Went. That seems cold comfort for a human lover.
May. And so I found. You taught me how to love.
Your servant made ml?crave return of love.
Went. Wnat! Terry?
Mjiy Yes.
WEnt. Terry served me well.
n But I dreamed not his talents went so far.
May. 1 Yet so it is.


Went. And how did Teny spur your growing love ?
May. lie roused my jealousy.
Went. Ah ! Tell me how.
May, lie hinted that some lady Claimed your heart,
And then with the naivete* of his race
He wished my fate were her’s, and her’s were mine.
The wish chimed with my voiceless doating thoughts
It startled me ; and then, when he was gone,
I realised what loss it was to lose you.
I saw you happy in another’s arms,
Without one thought for me ; and bitter tears \
Of jealous anguish sprang up-in my soul,
And overflowed my eyes with Love’s first sorrow,
Believe me, Love has no philosophy
That e’er could relish this.
Went. My darling May! ( Tenderly embraces Tier.)
May. I could have watched you battling with the world,
Have seen you mount with Fortune’s rosy smile
Or sink beneath the terror of her frown,
And still lived on in silent adoration ;
Nor sought fora return. This had been joy.
But oh! ’Tie not in any woman’s heart
To see her prize of love given to another.
That thought marred all the beauty in Love’s heaven ;
Robbed all my wealth in love, and made me poor;
Threw murky shadows on my stream of being;
Poisoned the wholesome honey of my life ;
And changed all roseate hues to sickly green.
0 ! Then I learned the misery of vain love.
Twas a dark night of bitter, racking torture,
But herald to my too delightful day. >
Went. Sweet May 1 My cup of bliss flows to the brim.
Heaven has no further favour I would ask.
Enter Foodlet'on, discovering lovers.
Food. 0, yes! Thank you — thank you vewy much. I — am superbly
delighted. Pway don’t let me disturb you 1 A—pardon me, Miss Mercer.
Excuse me—a —Wentworth—a—l didn’t—a—know—a—how things stood,
you know.
Went. Well, sir! (angrily.)
May. (Recovering herself, and laughing at the situation.) No—a—a—Mr.
Foodleton didn’t know, you know.
Food. You see, I told your father about your wefusing me. I—a—
couldn’t make it out, you know. So stwange 1 Wasn’t it, now ?
May. (Laughing.) Vewy stwange, you know.
Food. Thanks! Thanks, vewy much. This is vewy supwemely
intensely delightful. I—a—will tell you something too utterly superbly
funny. I—I—a know you’ll laugh. Ha! ha! ha! Your father said that
pwaps you liked somebody else better than me. Ha! ha Iha I That was
quite too etherially absurd—wasn’t it ?
May. Super —superlative stupidity 1 v
Went. (Smiling.) Pure unadulterated nonsensical nonsence !
Food. Ye-es—ye-es. Some people can’t understand these things, you
know ! Nevah mind ! I—a—a—can see it—see it all now. Genewoua
girl! Wouldn’t let me sacwifice myself ! Took Mr. Wentworth out of
pity ! Tl.iew yourself away on him out of wegard for me. ’Pon my


word ! A lily-sweet young lady. Weally, Miss Mercer, I shouldn’t have—
a—wegwetted the sacwifice. You’re worthy of me ! There!
May. ( Very ironically.) Ah. you are very kind. But I should always
have felt the disparity between us.
Went. {Continuing the joke.) Yes, she’ll feel more on a level with me,
Mr. Foodleton.
Food. Thanks—thank you vewy much. lam superbly delighted I Still
—a —the match would have been more cowwect with me. A woman,
you see, should—a—a—be able to look up to a man—not down to him.
Went. Bravo ! Foodleton. The truth leapeth from the mouths of babes
and you know the Scriptures, and you verify them in your person.
Food. Thanks—thank you vewy much. lam superbly flattered !
Enter Jessie, Murray, and Mercer.
Mer. Wentworth, my boy, a double congratulation on your double
wooing. You have won two constituencies in a week. (To May.) May,
my dear child, I believe you have elected your candidate.
Went. (Shaking hands.) Thanks, my dear sir. It is quite true. I have
wooed and won the “ sweet voices.” This is indeed a memorable “ Polling
Day.”
May. But it has not been all by manhood suffrage.
Jkh. No, you sly one. You arranged for lady voting in this election.
Mur. Yes, Jessie, with herself as Returning Officer.
Mer. (Coming between and joining their hands.) And with a very approv-
ing Scrutineer.
Food. Well—a—this is supwemely uttah—quite intensely superb. l—
l—a—l am a wejectcd candidate, you know. But I’m weady to make—a
—a —a —sacwifice for another constituency —(bowing to Jessie). I ask—
all—a—your suffrages for a successful “ Polling Day.”
Went. It’s quite clear that you have secured the principal voter (looks
at Jessie , who looks confused). And now, ladies and gentlemen, it becomes
my duty to move a vote of thanks to my own Returning Officer—
(saluting May) —and to the Scrutineer (bowing to Mercer). I acknowledge
the good feeling of the opposition candidate (turning to Foodleton). I
understand that in the domestic Parliament the lady is the perpetual
Speaker of the House; that her rulings are absolute ; and that she brings in
all the bills, which must be passed without debate. lam very happy ta say
that in my case the decisions will tie all according to “ May.” I anticipate
free discussions, but very few divisions. I shall try to study well these
standing orders, and hope you approve of the mutual regard between
me and my beloved constituency (embracing May.).
Curtain goes down amid cheers from all.
