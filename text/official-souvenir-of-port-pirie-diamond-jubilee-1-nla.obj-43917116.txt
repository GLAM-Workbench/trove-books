1876 PORT PIRIE DIAMOND JUBILEE 1936
HENRY WARREN, ESQ.
First Mayor of Port Pirie, 1876.
The Corporation of the Town of Port Pirie
celebrates its Diamond Jubilee in September, 1936,
having been proclaimed a municipality on Septem-
ber 28, 1876, just 40 years after the birth of the
State of South Australia.
Over 30 years before, however, the creek
which now provides berths for deep-sea ships, was
used for shipping sheep and wool from surrounding
sheep stations, and the town derived its name from
the first vessel to enter the creek for this purpose
—the John Pirie (Captain Thompson). The John
Pirie was a schooner of 120 tons and was the third
vessel to arrive at Kangaroo Island under charter
to the South Australian Company. She was
formerly owned by Mr. John Pirie, an alderman
of the London Corporation, afterwards Sir John,
who was a member of the original board of directors
to the South Australian Company, which did so
much to colonize South Australia. Pressure of
work compelled him to resign his seat when he was
elected Lord Mayor of London. The schooner,
John Pirie, left England on February 22nd, 1836,
having on board besides the officers and crew, 28
laboring men, a few head of livestock, and general
stores and provisions. She did not arrive in South
Australian waters until the middle of the following
August, and some years later ran ashore three miles
from Victor Harbor.
It is thus fitting that the town should com-
bine the commemoration of its own Diamond
Juibilee with the Centenary Celebrations of the
State.
The original site of the township is now called
Solcmontown. Section 2of 85 acres was sold to
Matthew Smith & Emanuel Solomon in 1848 for
£B5, and in the same year was cut up and offered
at auction in Hindley Street, Adelaide, by
Nathaniel Hales, beginning at 7 o'clock in the
evening—"an unusual hour"—says the advertise-
ment—"but auctioneer provides a plain but sub-
stantial banquet."
The Government Township of Port Pirie was
surveyed in December, 1871 by the late Chas. Hops
Harris on a novel design—curved streets. The
nomenclature of the principal streets refer to the
family of the late Mr. G. W. Goyder, Surveyor-
General. Some, years before Section 2 was sur-
veyed, a wopfshed had been erected there and was
used by Mr. Peter Ferguson, of Nelshaby, and
Bowman Bros., of Crystal Brook, as a shipping port
for their wool.
Section 1 was Mount Ferguson.
To-day, Port Pirie is a shipping port known
the world over. Its situation in the northern por-
tion of that fine extension of the Southern Ocean
—Spencer's Gulf, extending some 300 miles into
the interior of Australia, and thus becoming the
natural port for all the Broken Hill exports and
imports has ensured its progress during the 60
years of its history. It now becomes a break of
gauge station on the East to West Transcontinental
line by the completion of the Red Hill—Port
Augusta section so that we may look for further
progress in the future.

Like most country centres, the public hall in
Port Pirie was built, portion at a time as the town
grew, under the administration of the Institute
Committee, and until 4 years ago the buildings
remained the property of that body, although the
Town Council administered the building fund as
trustees of same and occupied a room as a com-
bined office and council chamber.
After some years of negotiation,, agreement
was reached in 1932 when the whole block was
purchased by the Corporation, and after extensive
improvement and renovation was re-opened as the
Town Hall Municipal Offices. The Institute
Library, which had previously occupied a large por-
tion of the building, was housed next door in a
fine new building on land procured from the Har-
bors Board for the purpose, at a cost of over
£5,000.
, -
*
The purchase money provided by the Council
(approximately £lO,OOO cash) was obtained from a
fund built up from the profits of the Council's
Electricity Works in the form of a sinking fund
which was thus used to repay to the ratepayers of
the town former lighting rates used as capital in
the trading concern.

The store is built away from the main shopping centre, but nevertheless commands the interest and enthu-
siasm of those desirous of combining economy and service. The ten departments carry a most comprehensive stock,
and all prices are based on the very lowest percentage necessary to cover expenses entailed. These two facts have
combined to make the popularly known "Co-op. Store" one of the outstanding and most beneficial enterprises in
the history of Port Pirie..

SOME FEATURES IN THE HISTORY OF
PORT PIRIE.
From about the year 1846 Port Pirie was
shown on official maps as "Samuels' Creek," in
compliment to its discoverer, Samuel Germein,
master of the Government schooner Waterwitch,
who sailed from Port Adelaide on the 28th June,
1840, to convey stores to Explorer Eyre, and
returned with despatches from Eyre from the head
of Spencer's Gulf on the sth August, 1 840.
The native name of the place was "Tarparrie,"
which means "muddy creek." The first vessel to
navigate what was then but a creek was the
schooner John Pirie, of 120 tons (Captain
Thomson). That was towards the close of 1845.
The object of the schooner's visit was to take sheep
from Bowman's Crystal Brook run to Lipson's Cove,
near Port Lincoln, and Governor Robe signalised the

event by cancelling Samuel Germein's rightful
place in the nomenclature of the locality, and re-
christening it Port Pirie.
For many years after its discovery the place
remained one of the most primitive spots on the
South Australian coast, and its present status was
achieved only by the big expenditure of public
money in dredging the harbor and reclaiming the
land abutting on the creek. So troublesome was
the tidal inundation in the early days that the
original buildings were constructed on piles, and
residents were frequently compelled to boat from
place to place.
The first dwelling was a hut occupied by a
man who acted as caretaker of three wool stores
erected by pioneer pastoralists:—The Bowman
Bros. (Crystal Brook run), Mr. H. B. Hughes
(Booyoolee Station, near Gladstone), and the Reid
Bros. (Beetaloo Station). The wool was lightered
to sailing vessels lying eight miles outside the
creek by a ten-ton cutter (Captain Denman) from
a primitive three-plank jetty.
The first steamer to enter the creek was the
little Euro, which was afterwards wrecked, and
which must not be confounded with the tug Euro
which did duty in the port at a later date. At times
the jetty referred to was completely submerged by
exceptionally high tides, and the late Mrs. G. W.
Cameron, of Murraytown, told how she and others
had to be carried ashore by sailors when she visited
Port Pirie in 1852 in the Lady Harvey.
The late Mr. Nicholas Simons was one of the
earliest pioneers, and when he went there to build

a store, and a boatman showed him the site for the
building by jabbing an oar down at a spot covered
by 2 ft. of water he was bewildered.
The natural features of the place were so
discouraging that when, in 1873, the Railway Bill
was before Parliament, the terminus of the line was
ieft an open question, and the measure was
entitled: "A line of railway to Port Pirie or Mount
Ferguson." A Select Committee investigated the
questioh and among those who gave evidence were
PORT PIRIE HARBOR AND ELLEN STRE ET FROM EAST SIDE OF RIVER, 1876.
Messrs. Henry Warren (Pirie's first Mayor) and
Oliver Horner (a prominent business man of the
day). The elmination of Mount Ferguson from
the title of the Bill was secured on its third reading
in the Legislative Council. Gladstone was decided
upon as the connecting link. The difficulty of
procuring the passage of the Bill in its altered form
was no doubt due to the fact that the land about
Mount Ferguson had been eagerly bought up by
speculators in anticipation of the railway going
there.

s
The original site of the township of Port Pirie
is where Solomontown now stands. Before Messrs.
Bowman Bros, purchased the Crystal Brook sheep
station it was owned by William Younghusband and
Peter Ferguson, after whom, it is understood,
Mount Ferguson was named. In 1848 they sold 85
acres of their run in the neighbourhood of the Pirie
Creek to Messrs. Matthew Smith, S.M., and
Emmanuel Solomon, for £B5. That was Section 2,
and it was surveyed by Mr. J. Young on May 23,
1848. In the same year, on November 6,
Nathaniel Hailes sold a big slice of the new town-
ship at his auction mart, Adelaide, the price paid
being an average of £lO per acre. Solomontown
was named after Emmanuel Solomon, who came to
Adelaide from Sydney in 1 837, and was one of the
former's most successful merchants. He reserved
a piece of land in the centre of Solomontown—it
is now owned by the Methodist Church, and is
known as the "Church Circle"—for the erection of
a Jewish synagogue, but it was never claimed by
that sect, and on his death it was found that his
will offered the land to the first religious body
which desired to erect a church on it. Advantage
was taken of the provision by the Bible Christians,
who had an old church of theirs removed from
another country centre to the site. Later, with the
fusion of the denominations, it became the pro-
perty of the Methodist Church.
In 18/3 Mr. H. M. Addison re-surveyed
Solomontown into allotments which were offered
by auction on the 18th June, 1873.

The Government Survey.
The Government town of Port Pirie was sur-
veyed in December, 1871, and gazetted in 1872,
the first land sale being held in August of that
year. It was laid out on a novel design—curved
streets—by Charles Hope Harris, and the main
thoroughfares were named after the family of Mr.
G. W. Goyder, Surveyor-General.

whole of the store has been modernised both inside and out. Prests' have also found
it necessary to add extensive storerooms for their warehouse which feeds their chain of
stores.
Most of the goods are shipped or railed to their warehouse at Port Pirie, broken
up, and sent out to the various branches.
They are large buyers of all goods usually stocked by a general store, such as
Grocery, Hardware, Crockery, Fancy Goods, Men's and Boys' Clothing, Manchester
Goods, Hosiery, Gloves, and General Haberdashery Lines, Dress Materials, Ladies'
Frocks, Hats, Lingerie, Etc., and would be pleased to get into touch with any factories
who are desirous of doing business direct with retailers who buy in large quantities.
Their system of trading at their stores is cash or credit. Credit accounts can
be arranged for one month or longer.
Their block of buildings also embraces, in addition to the general Storekeepers'
Lines, a Ladies' Hardresser, Dining Rooms, Saddlery Manufacturing Section, and a
Ladies Waiting Room, is provided especially for the use of their country clients.

The town was incorporated September 28th,
1876, and, as before stated, Mr. Henry Warren
(who came to Port Pirie to manage Magarey's mill,
corner Ellen and George Streets) was the town's
first Mayor.
Successive Mayors.
Mr. Warren held the position of Chief Magis-
trate until 1879, and was followed by Mr. William
Wood (1880-1). The succeeding Mayors, up till
the present time (1936) have been:—Messrs.
William Goode (1882-3), J. L. Coombe (1883-4),
Fred Grey (1885), J. C. Harris (1886), Thomas
Magor (1887), J. Gordon (June, 1888), T. C.
Simpson (1888-9-90), A. A. Pearce (1891-2),

Degenhardt (1913-14), J. S. Geddes (1915-16),
A. B. Forgan (1917-18, up to April, 1919), M. E.

The municipality, when first established, consisted
of two Wards, with two councillors for each Ward.
The personnel of the first Council was Messrs. R.
Cell, J. McDonald, T. U. Scrutton, and William
Wood. Mr. Richard Prentice was appointed Town
Clerk in January, 1877, but he died in 1879, and
Mr. Edwin Goodall was appointed in his place. In
1884 the late Mr. W. G. Wilson took over the
duties, and continued to occupy the position up till
the appointment in 1915 of Mr. E. E. Garrett, who
at present holds the office.
A circumstance unique in the life of the town
is the fact that one of the occupants of the
mayoral chair (Mr. J. C. Fitzgerald, M.P.), who,
with his parents and other members of the family,
came to Port Pirie from Wallaroo over half a
century ago, was engaged on the original construc-
ton of Ellen Street, now the principal business
thoroughfare of the town, and it is probable that
there are few, if any, provincial centres in the State
where a resident has simultaneously held the dual
positions of Chief Magistrate and district repre-
sentative in the House of Assembly. Mr. Fitz-
gerald, however, enjoyed that distinction for 5
years.

WEEROONA CAMP.
As a sequel to the provision made by the Broken
Hill Associated Smelters for the children
of Port Pirie, by the creation of the children's
playground, the company built a splendidly equip-
ped holiday camp at a small bay on the western
side of the Gulf, adjacent to Point Lowly Light-
house, for the use of the Company's employees,
for holiday purposes.
After some years of service in this position, the
whole of the buildings and equipment were given
by the Company to the Town Council, together
with £2,000 cash to cover the cost of removal and
re-erection at Mt. Ferguson.
The Council accepted the Company's generous
gift for the benefit of the citizens of Port Pirie,
and transferred the whole of the plant across the
Gulf by barge, and re-established the camp on the
northern slope of Mt. Ferguson, which is situated
on the eastern side of the Port Pirie River, near
the entrance of the channel, about 10 miles distant
from the town by road.
The tents originally used have been replaced by
pine slab huts, which, together with kitchen, dining
room,, store, large dance hall, residence, and much
other equipment, makes a very fine holiday resort
for the townspeople at a very low cost. For some
years the Council administered the affairs of the
camp, but at present it is leased to Mrs. A. H.
Nolan, who provides a most excellent service for
visiting patrons.

MEMORABLE INCIDENTS.
In 1876 the first Sunday School was opened
by the late Mr. D. B. Baldock, and the first weekly
newspaper, the "Port Pirie Gazette and Areas'
News," was published.
The first vestry book shows that the Rev. Hartley
Williams took his first services at Port Pirie on
June 27, 1875, and that there were eleven com-
municants. The Rev. gentleman was known as the
"Areas' Missionary," and visited the town once
every three months. His residence was at Melrose.
By advertisement in the local Gazette of April
14, 1876, it was announced that service would be
conducted at the "usual place" on the following
Sunday (April 16, 1876), and Mr. Baldock stated
that the "usual place" referred to was the bottling
department of a wine store. A beer barrel, covered
with a cloth, served as a table, and gin cases were

The first annual Easter Vestry meeting of St.
Paul's Church was held on Sunday, April 16, 1876.
The Ven. Archdeacon F. T. Whitington, of Hobart,
was rector of St. Paul's from 1 877 to 1 880. He
stated that at that time, owing to tidal inundations,
dengue fever was a frequent visitant, and recalled
an occasion when the Magistrate of the town, the
doctor, and the parsons were laid aside with the
malady.
The population of the town on April 1, 1876,
was 947, made up as follows:—Port Pirie proper,
605; Port Pirie West, 210; Solomontown, 132.
To-day the population is 12,000.

THE FIRST WHITE CHILD.
There have been many claims to the distinc-
tion of being the first white child born in the
town, but the late Mr. Robert Alfred French, who
died at his home, Solomontown, in April, 1924,
always contended that the honor was his, and his
mother (who subsequently married Captain Den-
man) supported the claim. If it was as stated then
Mr. French had lived in the port the longest of
any resident. He was aged 66 years at the time
of his death, so that would make the year of his
birth 1858. It was a matter of keen controversy
between Mr. Fred Grey and Mr. French as to which
could claim the honor of being the oldest resident,
but in view of the fact that Mr. French was born
at Port Pirie in 1858, Mr, Grey's claim must be
discounted.

by Mr. William Goode, Mr. B. P. Goode following
later. Although never closely connected with the
Port Pirie business, Mr. H. A. Goode retained his
interest as senior partner in the firm, and did most
of the buying at the city end. With the passing
of the old principals the name of the business was
altered to Goode Brothers, but is now again known

carried on in premises south of the site of the

with Mr. Charles Geddes, took over Messrs.

CHAMPIONS OF THE PORT.
The fight for the Barrier trade was a strenuous
one for Port Pirie, or at any rate those who cham-
pioned its cause encountered much opposition.
Among those who worked hard in the town's behalf
at that time were its representatives in the State
Assembly (James Henderson Howe and Alfred
Catt), William and Benjamin Goode, Fred Grey,
W. K. Mallyon, M. L. Warren, H. C. Warren, Wm.

OLD TIME PILOTS
The life of the Spencer's Gulf pilot to-day is
vastly different to what it was thirty or forty years
ago. From the list of these old "sea dogs" of other
days we can recall such names as Tom Cheesman,
McCarthy, Tom Chandler, Peter Murdoch, Jock
Dalziel, Archie Paul, Whitmore, Hughes, and
others. Their business for the most part consisted
in piloting sailing ships into port, as the era of
overseas steamer trade, so far as Port Pirie was
concerned, had only recently dawned. Then each
of the pilots had a cutter of his own, and as the
present pooling system had not then come into
vogue, it was, so to speak, every man for himself.
The pilots cruised about the Gulf, and the first to
come up with a vessel inward bound, invariably had
the privilege of bringing her into port. And rough
and hazardous work it was boarding the sailing
vessels in bad weather. Matters are conducted
differently to-day: each pilot takes his turn, and
a roomy motor launch, well found in every detail,
takes the place of the sailing cutter of those times.
It is related that in the remote past the pilots
were wont to foregather at the Pilot Boat Hotel
(now the West Suburban Hotel) in Port Pirie West,
where from the roof they could discern the masts
of a vessel proceeding up the Gulf.

The Corporation was not happy in its relations
with electric lighting during the early stages of the
innovation. The plant first installed was found to
be incapable of successfully coping with the burden
placed upon it. That was twenty-six years ago.
Pirie's first electrical engineer was Mr. Burt. Then
the power plant was supervised for a time by a local
firm (Messrs. Turner and Robertson). At the ex-
piration of their term Mr. A. H. Rieschiek was ap-
pointed, and under his practical supervision the
public demand for current, has grown from 593
consumers in 1918 (when an agreement
was entered into with the Broken Hill
Associated Smelters Company for the supply
of current) to approximately 2,800 con-
sumers at the present time. The supply of
electric current has been a prolific source of
revenue to the Town Council, an inestimable boon
to the townspeople, and a credit to the department
which exercises supervision over the work of dis-
tribution.
SANITATION OF THE TOWN
LIGHT AND POWER.
S.S. EURO, FIRST STEAMER.
THE TOWN'S WATER SUPPLY.
The history of the town would be incomplete
and an injustice done the memory of one of its
oldest residents, were the source of its water supply
omitted, and praise withheld from the late Mr.
Nicholas Simons, who did so much in directing the
attention of successive Governments to the facili-
ties afforded by the Baroota catchment area for
water conservation. Port Pirie's first water supply,
when the town had attained any magnitude, was
drawn from the Nelshaby Reservoir, situated about
nine miles from Pirie, at the foot of the Flinders
Range, from whence the water was carted into the
town. Then followed a mild form of reticulation.
In 1888, contemporary with the establishment of
smelting operations and the accompanying increase
of population, the Beetaloo Reservoir was con-
structed. For some years the resources of Beetaloo
sufficed until the advent of drought conditions
throughout the North, and during which the resi-
dents of Port Pirie were vitally affected. It was at
this time (1890), largely due to the representa-
tions of Mr. Simons, that a four-inch main was put
in from Baroota Springs to Port Pirie. As time
went on, however, this supplementary supply was
found to be insufficient, and the town was con-
nected up with Bundaleer Springs. But from many
standpoints the supply was not then satisfactory,
and under the Barwell administration the construc-
tion of the Baroota Reservoir was undertaken, and
carried to completion subsequently.
There is no class of infectious disease that can
be said to be endemic to the town, but with the
sudden increase of population and the primitive
sanitary service during the eighties and nineties,
the comirnunity was subject to attacks of typhoid
fever of more or less virulence, and the cases were
numerous. Excepting for two or three months of
the year, during which the thermometer is spas-
modic in its vagaries, residents enjoy a bracing and
invigorating climate. The winter is short and not
severe, while the spring weather is delightful.
When the double-pan and septic tank systems re-
placed those of the single pan and cesspit there
was immediately a remarkable decrease in the cases
of infectious disease, if we omit the year 1919,
when influenza raged here in common with other
centres throughout the State. The keen super-
vision, on behalf of the local board of health, by
the Sanitary Inspector (Lieut.-CoK A. R. D.
Leonard, V.D.) is largely responsible for the pre-
sent exceedingly pleasing state of things.

THE Y.M.C.A. AND ITS WORK.
A branch of the Y.M.C.A. was established and
the present building in Gertrude St. erected in
1918. The building was provided by the Army
and Navy Department of the Association. Pri-
marily the object was to provide recreation for
men who assembled at Port Pirie for the purpose
of enlisting during the Great War. There are fif-
teen members on the Board of Directors, three of
whom are nominated by the Broken Hill Asstd.
Smelters Pty., Ltd., and the others by the Associa-
tion. The B.H.A.S. Company has always been
generous in its donations, which have been largely
responsible for the splendid results attained,
especially in connection with the Boys' work. Its
recreations include football, cricket, basket ball,
volley ball, tennis, and other out-door games. In
addition, the building is equipped with two first-
class billiard tables. The first Board of Directors
was Messrs. W. E. Hamp (President), H. A. Chester

EASTERN SIDE OF ELLEN STREET.
During the early nineties the eastern side of
Ellen Street could claim no pretension to architec-
tural beauty. From the site of the present Barrier
Hotel (in 1889 the "Standard" office occupied the
place) to W. L. Scott's Motor Garage there
existed a few scattered wood-and-iron houses.
Mr. A. J. Usher was the first licensee of the Barrier
Hotel, and the quickening of the commercial life
of that side of the street dates from its erection
(about 1892). About the only other important
building on that side of the street at that time from
the Alexander Street intersection to the Mary-Ellie
Street crossing were Mr. Fred Grey's auction mart
and offices. To-day we have a splendid addition
in Mr. M. Rasheed's Alhambra Thearte Building,
with its suites of offices and shops now known as
the Ozone Theatre, owned by the Waterman
family.

PIRIE'S PART IN THE GREAT WAR
Any history of the town would be incomplete
were mention omitted of the splendid part the
community played in the Great War—her ladies
in Red Cross work, Comforts Fund, and other acti-
vities; her sons (2,500 of the enlistments were at
Port Pirie) on the battlefields of the various coun-
tries. Her sacrifices were great, her losses heavy;
230 of her brave boys laid down their lives for their
country. One of our oldest and most respected
residents (Lieut.-Col. A. A. Pearce, V.D.) lost
three of his sons—Max, Sid, and Alec. Again, in
regard to munitions manufacture, it is to the infi-
nite credit of the town's industrial section that not
for one hour during those dark days did the em-
ployees of yonder Smelting Works relax effort day
or night so that the Empire and its Allies might be
amply provided with munitions. And when the
French Mission visited Port Pirie in 1918, General

THE FATHERS' ASSOCIATION
Port Pirie can claim to have established the first
Fathers of Sailors and Soldiers' Association in the
State. It was the second in the Commonwealth,
that of Melbourne slightly preceding it. The idea
was originated by Mr. C. A. Degenhardt and the
first secretary was Mr. W E. Scanlan, who holds the
position at present. The local organisation was
formed in 1918, its first president being a very old
resident (Mr. Charles Edwards), whose six sons saw
active service in the Great War. One of the sons
(Charles) was killed in action, two others (Wal-
ter and Albert) of Mr. Edwards' sons have since
passed to the Great Beyond. Since the formation of
the Association it has done good work on behalf
of returned men, and in other ways has made for
the advancement of the States' interests.
Pau, the leader of the Mission, in an eloquent
address, complimented the men of Port Pirie on
the manner in which they had worked, and on the
quantity of metals they had produced for the use
of the armies in the field, and he thanked them on
behalf of his Government for their efforts. And
in memory of those who fell monuments have been
reared; the substantial and prepossessing structure
at the entrance to the Memorial Oval is one, which
'together with the Memorial Grandstand makes a
very fine memorial indeed. Another is that placed
in the Memorial Park by the local Foresters' Lodge;
while yet a third is that wreath-crowned obelisk
erected to the memory of the fallen by the women
of Port Pirie. The Local Board of the Returned
Soldiers' Association has used the Memorial Grand-
stand for its monthly meetings since 1927, but has
now acquired a lease of suitable rooms at the Town
Hall as headquarters.

VIEW FROM GRANDSTAND.
A GIGANTIC ENTERPRISE.
On Saturday, August 17, 1918, during the
term of the late Mr. A. B. Forgan as Mayor, 2,000
of the town residents —male and female—gave
their labor voluntarily in constructing a Children's
Playground immediately west of the Soldiers'
Memorial Oval. A site, covering an area of ten
acres, had been granted by the Town Council for
the purpose. The scheme originated with Mr.
Gerald Mussen, of the Broken Hill Associated
THE GRANDSTAND.
Smelters Company, who during his visits to the
town had always manifested a keen interest in the
welfare of the children. He was supported in his
enterprise by the Company he represented, and it
is largely due to its munificence that the under-
taking was such a success. Artisans from the
Works were busily engaged in the erection of a
pavi'ion, kiosk, and other buildings. Parson and
plebeian worked side by side making excavations to
receive the 20-ft. palms. They graded the land,
prepared flower beds, planted shrubs, erected
equipment, and in countless ways assisted in the
enterprise. The event marked a distinct epoch in
the history of Port Pirie, and the public's appre-
ciation of the privileges for amusement thus
afforded is as keen to-day as on the day of opening.
On the day following the construction —Sunday—
the Playground was formally handed over to the
Mayor by Mr. Mussen for the benefit of the town.
It is a splendid monument to the spirit of co-opera-
tion and a tribute to the generosity of the Broken
Hill Associated Smelters' Company, in the absence
of which the work would have been impossible.
Mr. T. H. Golding is entrusted with the super-
vision of the Playground in the capacity of care-
taker. It is controlled conjointly by a Committee
composed of representatives of the B.H.A.S.
Company and of the Town Council.
MAN-MADE BEACH.
Although Port Pirie has a seafront to the ex-
tent that deep sea ships can berth at its many fine
wharves, yet no suitable beach for bathing purposes
has been provided by nature in close proximity to
the town.
This deficiency has now been largely remedied
by the wonderful improvements made to a section
of the river bank and mud flat adjoining Solomon-
town by the united effort of the residents.
The Town Council placed the control of this
section of the river frontage in the hands of a
special Beach Improvement Committee, who have
worked hard for a number of years in raising
funds and judiciously expending the amount in
shelter sheds, kiosk, band stand, and other build-
ings as well as covering large areas with shell sand
carted many miles for the purpose.
A very fine building has recently been added
at a cost of over £l,lOO for the purpose of a bath-
ing shed and kiosk as well as shelter underneath
the structure. In this as in many other ways the
B.H.A. Smelters Company has been a great assis-
tance in providing the greater part of the money
required.
The Council has expended money (including
Government grants for the purpose) in providing
relief work for unemployed and thus has reclaimed
a considerable portion of the frontage from tidal
influence as well as effectively lighting the whole
bathing area.
The result has proved to be a valuable im-
provement to the town and is patronised- by
thousands of its citizens during the summer season.
Mr. R. L. Forgan is the secretary of the Committee
and has every reason to be proud of the splendid
achievement resultant from his organising ability
and the fine support of the Committee and citizens
generally.

THE BROKEN HILL PROPRIETARY AND THE
ASSOCIATED SMELTERS COMPANIES.
A smelting plant was erected here in 1888, and
the Broken Hill Proprietary Company built a re-
finery in 1889. The first consignments of ore
from Broken Hill were conveyed to Port Pirie by
horse wagons, although at this period the railway
line was opened from Peterborough to Port Pirie.
The starting of smelting operations was the initial
step towards Port Pirie's subseguent prosperity.
The smelting industry, and thereafter the estab-
lishment of other treatment plants were responsi-
ble for the sudden influx of population, to cope
with which the town was in a position of perplexity
at the time. The problem of house accommoda-
tion, however, was solved by the erection of a large
number of canvas, calico, and hessian houses, called
tents, on the banks of Dead Horse Creek, and im-
mediately north of the residence of Captain R. B.
Williams, the then harbormaster. The house
stands to-day. In addition to the one at Dead
Horse Creek there was also a community of these
canvas structures on the flats west of the Pirie
South railway station —not an enviable locality in
winter time, certainly, but the exigencies of the
day demanded sacrifices in regard to comfort, and
some of the structures were rendered very com-
fortable indeed. For the privilege of living in
these structures the occupants paid a rental of
1/- per week (ground rent) to the Corporation,
and the amounts were regularly collected by the
then sanitary inspector (Mr. Thomas Hawke) . The
site of the Dead Horse Creek ''Canvas Town," as
it was then called, was not a desirable one, for the
reason that it was low-lying and subject to tidal
inundations.
A oreat number of the occupants of the
"tents" at the northern end of the town were em-
ployees of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company,
but occupation was not exclusive to them. With
its augmented industrial activity a new era opened
for Port Pirie. Contemporary with the establish-
ment of the Smelting Works the town's import
trade was largely increased by the cargoes of Oregon
brought here for despatch to Broken Hill for min-
ing purposes, while its exports assumed large pro-
portions in bullion, portion of which was exported
as it came from the moulds, while the remainder
was retained for treatment at the Company's Re-
finery adjacent.
Until the war broke out in 1914, only a portion
of the silver-lead concentrates from Broken Hill
was treated at Port Pirie, the remainder being sold
mainly for export to Europe, where its metallic
contents were extracted. The outbreak of the
war, however, stopped this export trade, and led
to the formation of the Broken Hill Associated
Smelters Proprietary, Ltd., by the leading Broken
Hill Companies, viz., the Broken Hill Proprietary
Company, the Broken Hill North, and Broken Hill
South Companies, and the Zinc Corportion. On
June 2, 1915, the new Company took over the
works at Port Pirie, consisting of two sections, viz.,
the Lead Smeltery and the Zinc Distillation Plant.
The latter was closed down in 1921, but the Lead
Smeltery has since been extended considerably,
and brought up to date by the introduction of the
latest methods, until the Works are now the largest
and most complete Lead Smeltery within the Brit-
ish Empire, ranking with the best of those in other
parts of the world.

Chief among the improvements installed have
been a telpher handling plant for the delivery of
charge materials to the blast furnaces, and a com-
pletely new refinery employing a unique continuous
process developed at Port Pirie by the Company's
staff. More recently the provision of modern
suites of offices and concrete roads, and the exten-
sive use of paint in attractive colours, give evidence
of the Company's progressive policy. In place of
the Zinc Distillation Plant, the recovery of zinc
from the Broken Hill ores is now carried out elec-
trolytically by the Electrolytic Zinc Company, at
Risdon, Tasmania, but the ore before being shipped
there receives a preliminary treatment at Port Pine.
The ores treated in these plants are derived
from the Broken Hill Mines, and consist of lead
concentrates averaging about 75% lead, 35 ounces
of silver, and 12 grains of gold per ton, and 15%
sulphur, and zinc concentrates averaging about
52% zinc and 30% sulphur. Approximately
4.000 tons of lead concentrates are treated in the
lead smeltery per week, while 1,200 tons of zinc
concentrates are roasted weekly prior to being
shipped to Tasmania, this process of yielding
sulphuric acid which is used for the production of
superphosphate. The residue from the electrolytic
zinc process is shipped back to Port Pirie for the
recovery of its lead content.
The lead smeltery embraces roast sintering,
blast furnace and refining sections, and is capable
of producing 200,000 tons of market lead per
annum. The annual production is around 160,000
to 170,000 tons of lead (approximately one-ninth
of the world's output), 8,000,000 ounces of silver,
and 5,000 ounces of gold. Since the inception of
operations at Port Pirie, treatment up to the end
of 1935 has resulted in a total production of
3.900.000 tons of lead, 245,000,000 ounces of
silver, and 1 98,000 ounces of gold, of a total mone-
tary value considerably exceeding £100,000,000.
The natural fluxes used in the lead smeltery
are silicious sand and limesand, the silicious sand
being obtained from an old river bed near Port
Pirie, and the lime sand from Wardang Island in
Spencer's Gulf.
At the present time, the Works 'strength, in-
clusive of staff, is around 1,400, and the annual
payment for wages and salaries about £375,000,
while the value of stores used (including fuels and
fluxes) is in the region of £350,000 per annum.

The Port Pirie Hospital is a very fine institu-
tion, situated in the very heart of the town, with a
history covering 45 years, commencing under the
superintendency of Dr. Stewart in 1891. Although
the various buildings have been added from time to
time according to requirements without any pre-
vious layout, the whole group together with up-to-
date equipment provides excellent accommodation
for both patients and nursing staff. Dr. L. G.
Tassie is the present superintendent and has held
the position for many years.
MEMORIAL GATES.
Port Pirie had a most unique and unenviable
experience in August, 1934, when a large section
of the town became flooded by a tidal wave that
overflowed the protecting embankments and did
an immense amount of damage to property, leav-
ing many families homeless. Unfortunately, the
lives of 2 children were lost as a result of hurried
exit from the flooded homes in the darkness.
It was a terrible experience for all concerned,
but the circumstances were greatly relieved by the
wonderful response to 'the appeal made for assis-
tance for the unfortunate families. The whole of
the State and many from outside the State
responded nobly and provided a fund of over
£20,000 which was paid to those affected to assist
in restoring their homes. In addition, the Federal
and State Governments provided £6,000, which has
enabled the Council to rebuild and enlarge the em-
bankments and thus prevent a recurrence of such a
disaster.

PROMINENT LABOR ORGANISATIONS.
From point of membership the Australian
Workers' Union and the Waterside Workers'
Federation are the most important industrial
organisations of the town. Of the former, which
is supervised by Mr. C. L. Davis, there are 600
members locally, and of this number the majority
are employed at the Broken Hill Associated
Smelters. The Union succeeded the A.M.A. here,
when the latter became defunct. It comprises
within its membership such industrial sections as
the Municipal Employees, and the horse-drivers.
Each of these sections holds its own meetings. The
local A.W.A. is a branch of the Waterside Workers'
Federation, and was inaugurated as the A.W.A. on
June 8, 1901. Its first President was the late Mr.
A. L. Munro, and the first Secretary, Mr. Joseph
Norton. The Presidents have been:—Messrs. J.
Groves, H. Rasmussen, J. Ryan, J. C. Fitzgerald, G.
Bushel, S. Cockburn, T. O'Loughlin, J. Murphy, W.
Cox, W. P. Coffey, A. E. Turley, J. Ramsay, H.
McGlaughlin, S. Fitzgerald, T. M. Nolan, W. H.
Taylor, S. H. Botheras, and A. H. Wilson. The Sec-
retaries who have held office are: —Messrs. J.
Norton, J. Groves, A. L. Munro, B. Harrison, L. J.
O'Malley, T. Cocks, T. Nolan, W. H. Taylor, who
at present holds the office.
Mr. Turley; after holding office as President
for eight years, became General President of the
Waterside Workers' Federation for the Common-
wealth, and is at present the General Secretary of
the Federation. The local branch now numbers
420 members, but up to the Great War period it
wrs over 800.
THE GENESIS OF WATERFRONT UNIONISM.
The organisation to which workers of the
waterfront owed allegiance during the eighties was
the Working Men's Association, which held its
meetings in the building adjoining the present
International Hotel. The Hall was then known as
Howe's Assembly Rooms, from the fact that the
late Hon. J. H. Howe was at one time the presiding
boniface and also the owner of the premises. To-
wards the close of the eighties Mr. Peter Quinn was
the presiding genius at the meetings of the Asso-
ciation. The agenda paper usually contained a
variety of subjects for consideration, from the
perennial question of a rise in wages to the best
steps to be resorted to in order that the lumpers
might resolve themselves into a sort of combine
and contract for the loading and discharging of
vessels by the members themselves, without having
recourse to the stevedoring firms for employment.
Such a scheme was actually put into operation, but,
as is usual with similar ventures, there were too
many bosses, and the bosses were of divergent
views on essential matters, the project fell through,
and the old-established order of things was revived.
It was found that the communistic spirit in steve-
doring work "wouldn't act." It is hardly to be
wondered at that there is a scarcity of employment
along the waterfront to-day, when both the loading
and discharging of vessels is undertaken by
mechanical means. In the days to which we have

referred coal and coke cargoes were handled with
the aid of baskets, which in the case of the latter
were carried on the lumpers' shoulders and tipped
at a stack on the wharf frontage. Old residents
familiar with such operations in the early days w-ill
recall the names of stevedores such as Harrold
Bros., Joe Donnelly, Harry Schultze, the late Fred
Leverington, and the later Howard Smith (C. A. M.
Woodroffe, Manager) and Adelaide Steamship
Companies (J. R. Strang, Manager), while to-day

Company and the South Australian Stevedoring
Company, as well as the firm Treleaven £r Brown,
the activities of which are respectively supervised
by Captain Williams and Mr. J. W. P. Oates, and
J, McConnachy.
The Port Pirie Trades and Labor Council,
which, after functioning for many years went into
recess for some time, was reformed about 2\ years
ago and has been very active during the last 12
months, dealing with a number of disputes between
employers and employees, including the recent
agreement between the A.W.U. and the B.H. Asso-
ciated Smelters Co. This body is comprised of
delegates from affiliated organisations, including
all those operating at the B.H.A. Smelters as well
