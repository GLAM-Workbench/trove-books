AN OPEN LETTER
?TO THE
Electors of MaftHaS;.
FELLOW ELECTORS,
You will be called upon on the 20th
June next, in response to the Enabling Act
or Referendum, to record your vote either
for or against the Amended or Secret Con-
ference Bill that was drafted in Melbourne
in January last by the Premiers of the six
respective colonies. Mark well how your
irtherent rights aftd liberties, under this
Secret Conference or Star Chamber business,
have been ignored if not trifled with, and
the manner in which you have been snubbed
by having the Bill drafted or amended with
closed doors and to the exclusion of the Press
from reporting their proceedings, and which
you and generations unborn (should the Bill
be accepted) will have to endure for all time
to come. A Cabal or Freemason kind of
Constitution-making that is foreign to all
modern notions of freedom and liberal demo-
cratic government. It might have suited
bygone dark ages where might was right, but
surely a free people of the enlightened age of
the Nineteenth Century will not tolerate
such things 1
I regret my inability, owing to late severe
illness, to visit and address you at the differ-
ent centres on so all important a matter,
and thus my reason for addressing an ? Open
Letter ? to you on the present occasion, in
order that you may at your leisure have an
Opportunity of reading and studying the
reasons I have set forth for ?opposing and
voting against this unworkable, cast-iron,
expensive and iniquitous Bill.
It was alleged at the last Referendum,
which took place on the 3rd June, 1898, that
the Bill was the best that could be obtained,
liberal in the extreme (?), and an out and out
democratic measure. The intelligent por-
tion of the electors, however, thought (and
be it to their credit) otherwise, for the
measure, fortunately for the colony, fell
short of the minimum number of votes by
at least 5000. The bill of 1898 consequently
was defeated?the majority of 5000 being
made up wholly by the Riverina district vote,
it has not surely come to this, that the future
destiny of N.S.W. is to be under the rule and
control of Riverina and border districts!
In round numbers 75,000 voted for the Bill,
and 60,000 against. The colonies ?of Vic-
toria, South Australia, Tasmania and West
Australia each and all carried the Bill of
1898 by overwhelming majorities. N.S.W.
was the only colony to oppose the t �ill. The
fact of the four colonies having accepted the
Bill was nothing remarkable, because they
had all to gain by so doing while N.S.W. had
everything to lose. If the other colonies are
so anxious fOr Union, why in the
name of common sense, having accepted the
Bill in 1898, not have federated there and
then without waiting for N.S.W. to come in ?
if the Bill in the eyes of the four colonies
was perfect in ?9B, what need was there for
backing down and accepting an amendment
Or Secret Conference Bill framed in 1899,
and which the electors of N.S.W. on the 20th
June next are asked to swallow at any price,
forsooth to ?please the fanatic \ whims and
caprice of other colonies. Yes, why ! Simply
because the Bargain or Bill, framed from its
very inception, was a one-sided rotten affair,
one that allowed the small or minor colonies
to send ten delegates each tc the Conven
tion for the purpose of drafting a Federal
Bill to only ten delegates from N.S.W. with a
population of over 1J millions. Here at the
very threshold of this Federal movement
N.S.W. was handicapped and outvoted be-
cause the four colonies had 40 delegates at
the Convention to only 10 from this colony.
What chance had the people of N.S.W. of
?obtaining a fair, reasonable or equitable Bill
When she had 4 votes to 1 against her?-in
fcther words the smaller States or minority
ruling the larger States or majority ? The
delegates to the Convention, I contend,
should have been elected on a population
basis. The smaller States had as much
right to trust the larger States, as the larger
had to trust the smaller. It is here where
the original bungling and blundering first
took place, and for this ode reason alone it
behoves every honest and unbiassed minded
Elector to vote agatns* and reject a Bill
that in years to come will bring ruin and
misery upon the people of N.S.W. if ever
they accept so iniquitous a Bill and thus
Come under the clutches of the other colo-
nies with a Senate consisted of six senators
to each, in place of representation on a popu-
lation basis. It is upon this principle alone
that the true essence and soundness of good
constitutional government rests hot the
voice or rule of the few but the voice of the
many ? the true vox populi, or democracy
and majority rule. As I proceed I will en-
deavor to advance other grounds equally as
fatal and detrimental to the best interests
and prosperity of N.S.W., and reasons that
every elector should seriously consider be-
fore recording his vote in favour of a Bill
that will rob him and his children, &c., of
their rights and freedom for all time to come.
The very word ? indissoluble,? in the Pre-
amble of the Bill, is enough to cause every
thinking honourable person to condemn it.
Once the Bill or bond and constitutional bar-
gain is accepted by the electors at the ballot
box there it must remain for ever unless it is
intended to have it repealed at the point of
the bayonet, bloodshed and the sacrifice by
civil war of valuable life. It is an insult to
ask an intelligent public to swallow a bill of
so inelastic and drastic a character, and there-
fore it is the bounden duty of every peace-
maker and Godfearing man to vote against
the Bill at all hazards. It is degrading and
the height of bombastic insolence to say that
if the Bill is rejected that we will never get
another or better. Is this not the language
of worse than lunacy to say so ? There are
plenty of able and intelligent men to be
found in the colony ready and willing to
draft a better and more equitable Bill, and
one more in consonance with the interest of
N.S.W. Take for instance the Federal
Capital. If the question is so immaterial,
why was Victoria so anxious to have it fixed
in Melbourne, and until Parliament otherwise
provided ? Once in Melbourne, there it will
remain for an indefinite period, as happened
in Canada and the States of America.
What chance has N.S.W., far less Sydney,
of being the seat of the Federal capital with
a 4 to 1 majority against us ? Buckley?s
chance, I guess. If the other colonies can,
with their voting power, run the gauntlet so
easily against New South Wales in the
Secret Conference Bill and quasi compro-
mises or concessions, what chance has she
(in the event of the Bill being accepted) of
ever being able to get any practical alterations
made when the machinery of the Bill comes
into operation. If New South Wales is out-
voted at the drafting of the Federal Constitu-
tion that we are asked to accept at any price
in what better position will she be placed with
the other colonies should the Bill come into
operation? She will then have the same
difficulties to confront and overcome in re-
gard to voting that she has now. That is to
say, in granting to the Senate the principle
of minority rule, or equal representation, she
will be outvoted. This is an excrescence in
the Bill that New South Wales ought not to
tolerate. Equal representation don?t exist
in the Senate in Canada, and why insert any
such a ridiculous provision in the bill for
Australia? Equal representation is totally
at variance with the fundamental principles
of democracy and majority rule, and one, if
allowed to continue, that must be naught
with an everlasting injustice to the interest
and prosperity of this colony. In the Senate
N.S.W. will have only six votes to 24 of the
other colonies. What chance will she have,
in the face of such odds, of redressing wrongs
or obtaining justice? A poor show, I
imagine. We are told to trust them, but
why� not ;they trust us! and not ask us to
swallow a Bill so unfair and lobsided. For
this reason I unhesitatingly say the Bill in
its present form should be voted down as it
was in 1898. It is all rubbish to say if the
Bill is rejected that we will never get a
better. In fact as the Bill stands we could
hot get a much Worse one. New South
Wales is the richest and most prosperous
colony in the whole group, but which, under
the provisions of this Bill, would simply


f\j
become a milch cow for the other colonies tu ?
make use of as they thought proper. 14 is
impossible to keep up two Parliaments?a
State and a Federal Parliament?without in-
curring an extra amount of expenditure. It
follows, therefore, that increased taxation
must be needed in some shape or form. The
bare expenses of the Federal Parliament,
with its two Houses, is computed to cost at
the rate of 3s 6d per head man, woman and
child, and the extra taxation or revenue
needed is put down at another 20s per head.
Taking it at 22s 6d per head, a family of six
will have to pay at the rate of �6 lOfc annhally
to keep up this federal extravagance. The
Hon. Dr. McLaurin, M.L.C. in his able,'
masterly and logical financial address on the
Bill has placed the matter before the people
in a nut-shell, and in- language and figures
that cannot be mistaken, far less refuted ;
yes, and the accuracy of which has been con-
firmed in the report of the expert financial
committee that was appointed to enquire into
the matter, and also by Mr. Nash of the
? Daily Telegraph ? ?financial and political
pills that are of course a bit too nauseous for
Billites to swallow, without attempting to
abuse the other side, lawyer fashion* bad
case. It is a moral certainty that to raise a
revenue of six, seven or eight millions a year
the Federal tariff in all probability will bfe a
stiff one, ranging from 25 to 30 pfer cent, to
?indemnify the other colonies for the loss of
their intercolonial trade and revenue. TWe
freetraders howled enough over the Dibbs
10 per cent, tariff that brought in a revenue
of �Boo',ooo yearly, and which to get rid of
'and make our ports free, Reid & Co. had to
"substitute a land and income tax and re-
duced the wages of civil servants besides to
the tune of �350,000 to make good the boasted
tax that was to abolish the unemployed and 1
other difficulties.
Freetraders when the Dibbs tariff was In
vogue did not then think it would help to
develop-and give an impetus to the expan-
sion of our coal, iron and other industries,
including the undeniable value and quality
of the Molong marble. Oh, no ! Bat now
they turn round political acrobatic fashion
and ask us in this Bill, without shame or
blush on their face, to padlock and close our
ports With a sweeping protective tariff
against the outer world, in order, we are
told, to foster our local industries and to give
employment to the people. Can political
clownish buffonery and somersaulting go
further ? It was right to condemn the
Dibbs tariff?a tariff for revenue purposes?
but oh no, nothing wrong about this jump
Jim Crow wheelabout policy when freetraders
adbpt a sweeping protective principle when
applied to this Federal Bill. Can artful
political shuffling and manoeuvring be ex-
celled in any part of the known world ?
wrong to-day and to-morrow. What
about American ? boodlers ? after this ?
Say that the leopard won?t change his spots
or the Ethiopian his color, after startling
facts like these. Furthermore, fancy out of
T� millions of people that only ten in the
whole colony can be found possessed of a
sufficient amount of brains to frame a Com-
monwealth Bill. Very coraplimentnry lan-
guage is it not ? Is it not as gross a libel
upon the people of N.S. Wales as ever was
uttered ? Nay, is it not enough to cause
someone to burn down our schools, colleges
and universities to have such odious and
contemptible language flouted in our face ?
Where are our historians, commercial men,
constitutional authorities, our erudite scho-
lars, our D. A?s, M.A?s, L.L.B. D.D. gradu-
ates to be found, <fec., and what have they to 1
say against the use of such insulting lan-
guage ?? Birth stains are as nothing com-
pared with such rubbish. Do as these
would-be-considered sapient, loyal, godlike
leaders tell you. Make no faces, ask no
questions, but go like dumb animals to the
ballot box and swallow the Bill at any price.
Then all the known magical nostrums will
never afterwards rid you of the political
slime and constitutional birth stains?
branded as if by an incurable political lep-
rosy and slavish bondage from which you
can never afterwards expect to ba relieved
or again obtain your liberty and freedom
behind the barred doors of worse than the
Bastilles of Bourbon notoriety and barbarity.
Admitting that the Bill is accepted by the
people, have we any guarantee that the Land
and Income Tax will be repealed ? No, no-
thing of the sort. The probability is that
these Taxes will be increased, and to which
will be added a uniform 2d postage rate in
place (as in some districts) of only Id. In
addition to* this there will be a heavy tariff
needed to raise a revenue of �7,500,000. So
that with a land and income tax, increased
postage, and a prohibitive tariff (and God
knows what other taxes will be needed), the
people then will be better able to judge from'
practical experience the value and blessing
likely to accrue from this so-called infallible
Secret Conference Bill, when they come to-
put their hands in their pockets by way of
antying up this extra and increased taxation.
The wages of the working classes were re-
duced 20 per cent at the advent of the land
and income taxes, and what will it be, I
wonder, when the machinery of this cursed
Federal Bill comes into operation ? Reduced
probably Ho starvation and beggary point.
And is this the so-called liberal and demo-
cratic Bill that the people on the 20th June
next are asked to swallow ? The answer*
electors, is in your hands, and it is for yon
to say ? Yes ?or ? No.? If you are against
a Bill so iniquitous, go like men to the ballot
box and strike out the word ? Yes,? and so
reject with scorn a measure which seeks to
lower your rights and freedom to the level of
the slave. Pass the Bill as it is, and up
goes taxation and down goes wages. Instead
of old age delusive pensions, the lazaret and
poor-house is the more probable issue. Blink
and quibble over the matter as one may, the
facts are too self evident to be ignored by
rational minds. It is upon you the people
that the burden of increased taxation will
fall. It is for you to resist placing cast-iron
and indissoluble fetters on the rights and
liberties you now enjoy under a free and re-
sponsible constitution. Beware of anything
approaching the hollow glitter and glare of
sham patriotism that may for the time being
dazzle the eye and obscure the mind but
which in the future (should the Bill be ac-
cepted) can only end in dire disappointment,
ruin and misery, when too late to be recalled.
We are told it is a better Bill than the one
rejected in 1893, but in what form the so-
called improvement consists it is hard to say.
In a few minor details a few alterations have
been made, but not in the interests of NSW.,
otherwise why was the capital not fixed in
Sydney in place of being within a 100 miles
radius ? Why fix the first Federal Parlia-
ment to be in Melbourne? Why was the
Braddon Blot hot removed instead of allow-
ing it to remain for ten years ? Why is the
public kept in ignorance and darkness con-
cerning the true financial aspect of the
question, and why is the Govt. Statistician
gagged and muzzled ? Why is the River
Question not more clearly and definitely
settled and defined in the interests of our
people ? Why ignore the principle of Ma-
jority Rule ? These are questions to answer
at the ballot box, and if the answers are un-
satisfactory or not forthcoming, then it is the
elector?s clear duty to vote by scratching out
the word ? Yes.? The absolute majority as
a substitute against deadlocks is but a
makeshift without any beneficial or practical
effect.
I am as firm a believer in the principles of
Protection to-day as I was 20 years ago, but
if we are to have Protection or a prohibitive - >
tariff against the outer world, whynub,, m
retaining the land and income tax in the face
of the dire and disastrous droughts from
which the colony of late years has suffered ?
Taxing people from the cradle to the grave,
aye and even beyond in the shape of probate
duties. Dog tax, noxious animals tax, &c.,
and as things are going on at present man
will soon be taxed off the face of the earth to
keep up a lot of rotten extravagant govern-
ments. We are only a mere handful of
people, about millions, and yet it takes
�10.000,003 a year to keep us, or living at
the rate of �28,000 every 24 hours. Will
this Secret Conference measure ease us of
any of the burdens of taxation ? Will it
ensure the grazier Id per lb more for his
wool, or the toiling industrious farmer Id
extra per bushel for his oats, barley, wheat
or corn, or a 61 extra per ton on his hay,
chaff and produce, or a Id per ton on his


have to pay extra for everything even to art
increased load of taxes, extravagant expenses
under Federal Parliament for a huge stand-
ing army, and wholesale outlay of borrowed
money expended in the construction of ne-
cessary defences and fortifications the cost
of which must be borne mostly by N.S.W.
Instead of the colony benefiting by the
Secret Conference measure (if accepted), it
the people will be saddled with extra taxa-
tion on the flimsy pretext that it must tend
to bring capital, &0., into the colony td
develope our local or colonial industries.
.Was this not the objedt sdilght to be obtained
by the Dibbs tariff, but which freetraders
strangled almost at its very infancy. And
these rabid freetraders and Billites are thosd
who now preach the loudest in favour of the
Secret Conference Bill that will, on its ac-
complishment, bring; about the very prin-
ciples of protection Against the outer world
that they have over and over condemned irt
no unmeasured terms. Oh! glorious prin-
ciples of freetrade and consistency. One day
A freetrader, the next a rabid advocate of
the principles of protection, that they only
a few short years back condemned in the
Bibbs tariff! Wherein does the political
honor and consistency of our rulers and pub-
lic men come in after this lamentable wrig-
gling; or is the motto to hold office the
Sacrifice of political principles for the sake of
the loaves and fishes, artd to the devil with
hOrtOr add political consistency and principles.
Electors, you are the jurors, the unfettered
guardians of our public rights and liberties;
It is for yOu as honest Godfearing men to
vote down such a damnably disgraceful
political trimming, wriggling and twisting.
If we are to have laws enacted for the wel-
fare of our fellowmen, then let men be
selected (not of the Yes-No type) in whom
the public can place implicit trust] and con-
fidence as the embodiment Of political
honesty, sadred truth, honor and jdstice, and
not those seeking to betray, delude or sell
Our liberties and freedom for the sake of
retaining the high offices of State and its
emoluments. In the past there has been tod
much public money frittered away orl
trumpery jim-crack undertakings, and will
the people be any better protected under this
measure ? I trow not! More probably the
Contrary. I?d sweep away State Governors,
Executives, and local Parliaments, and have
only one Federal Parliament for a United
Australia such as the Imperial Parliament
in England?Unification if you choose to
term it. Rigid economy and retrenchment
in the management of public business is the
sine qua non to our future progress and pros-
perity. Political dry-rot and over borrowing
is what pur local Parliaments suffer from
most. They have borrowed to the tune of
�65,d00,000, and sold besides 60,000,000 acres
of the people?s birthright or heritage, viz.,
our public lands, and how a new machine is
wanted in the shape of Federation to heap
on the agony and enable them to borrow
some millions extra under a new name and
fresh conditions, so that they can squander
it broadcast in the shape of fortifications and
for defence purposes, that might easily have
been dealt with had the colonies agreed td
work harmoniously together (under Executive
power) under the now almost obsolete
Federal Council measure that came into
operation in 1886. England, Ireland and
Scotland, with a population of over 40,000,000
and a huge navy and army to maintain, has
an expenditure Of about �100,000,000 a year,
Whereas here in these colonies, with a mere
handful of people?not quite 4,ooo,ood?it
requires something like �30,000,000 or
�40,000,000 yearly to govern us ! Is this not
a scandalous state of public affairs ? And
�et by this Secret Conference Bill we are
Asked to iricrease the evils and burdens ort
an already overburdened and overtaxed
community. It is shameful for so young
a Colony trying to ape its more wealthy and
independent seniors, and what willK.be when
we become clothed in rich luxuriant tinsel
and extravagant garments of a full-fledged
Australian nation ? Let this measure pass,
and who can tell what extra expenses the
people will have to endure or the additional
interest on borrowed money that will have to
be paid for the erection of a palacious federal
city and its magnificent surroundings. Yes,
and who will have to pay the piper?those
who are clamouring, till hoarse in the voice,
to have the measure passed and another
fetter of debt artd taxation cast round the
necks of the working classes like a millstone.
The recent Cuban war cost America
�64,000,000. Let this measure pass and it
is a certainty that millions of money must be
borrowed for the erection of the Federal City,
fortifications and defence purposes, to say
nothing of extra expenses in the event of
some imaginary invasion or war (more like
civil) occurring. Are the people prepared for
these grave contingencies ? If so, then
federate by all means, and rivet to the neck
of generations to come a load of public debt
(like England with her �800,000,000) and
from which the people will never be able to
recover. And this system of heaping oil
taxation is simply for the questionable honor
and glory Of being recognised as an Austra-
lian Nation at any price, like unto the
mongrel Bill. The late Dr. Lang (one of our
best and purest colonial patriots) uttered the
truest words when he insisted that we should
? declare our independence.? No, this would
never wash, for it would preclude us from be-
coming the recipients of so many Imperial
empty titles that is as fdreigrt to an Austra-
lian democracy as it is to America. Let us
have Federation, but where is the money or
sinews of war to come from, and who in the
end will have to pay the piper only the work-
ing classes, as in England and other countries
that are under the regime of spendthrift
rulers, with a plethora of worse than rotten
laws?to wit, our own rotten and worthless
land laWk, that are a disgrace to the colony.
Let the working man, the struggling, in-
dustrious, toiling and slaving farmer, the
miner, the artisan, the mechanic, the land
and stock owner, the merchant, the store-
keeper, the butcher, the baker, the fruit
grower, the schoolmaster, nay the unem-
ployed and the swagrrtan, &c., answer these
plain and simple questions at the ballot box
tin the 20th June next. If he don?t have to
pay by the sweat of the brow, labor and toil,
&c., it will have by hook or crook to be found
somewhere, either out of his pocket or his
wages to the suffering and loss of his inno-
cent family that will have to toil sweat and
slave to keep up a flood of unnecessary taxa-
tion and expenditure with a bribe or bone
thrown in occasionally for the idler to pick
up. An ? Australian Nation,? forsooth under
this secret-made Bill, that is alleged will
have the effect of ridding the colony irt
future of droughts, stagnation in trade, bank
failures, lowprice for produce, ticks, rabbits
and all and sundry blights, pests, starvation
and misery from off the face of the land, and
make it blossom as a rose ?a perfect paradise.
Gan any sane person has carefully read
the Bill believe in such arrant rubbish or
Allow himself or his family to be gulled and
humbugged by such silly foolish clap-trap,
spread out eagle fashion to catch the votes
of the ignorant and then afterwards
turn round and laugh at their innocence and
child-like simplicity for having accepted the
Bill. Pass along to your comrades in this
detestable game of bluff and worse than
spoliation and political traitorism the Pass-
word, viz., to ? Beware, beware in time,? and
not sell and sacrifice your rights and liberties
under a Bill so unfair, unjust and iniquitous.
In conclusion let me ask yon one and all to
read the Bill. Do not vote in ignorance or
darkness, but insist on the fullest inform i-
fcion being furnished ort the finance clauses
of the Bill and made as noon-day before you
vote in favor of the Bill or before you will
sign the bond or constitutional bargain that
is to bind you and generations to come for
ever. Insist also on the removal of the
Draddon Blot, and that the Water and
Rivers Question in your own territory shall
be made secure for the benefit of your own
people and settlers. Insist that the Capital
shall not only be in N.S.W., but m Sydney.
Insist also on Majority Hula, and the elec-
tion of the Senate on a population basis as
in Canada. Insist on having something
more definite and reliable at the hands of
our Government Statistician and what the
amount of taxation per head is likely to be.
Insist on Federation on fair just and equit-
able lines, manhood suffrage, one man one
Vote and majority rule?not one man two
billets. Are you prepared to swallow the
Bill at any price, containing as u does so
many fatal blots that will for ever encumber
