This is an interior view of the “MAX-MINTS” Factory, showing the processes of spinning, cutting, wrapping, and packing.
Ideal conditions for an ideal Sweet!
(A special conveying system, not shown in this picture, now carries the “MAX-MIN fS” through air-conditioned channels where the sweets
are cooled ready for packing.)


Here is a story that will interest you.
It reads like a fairy tale , but it is true!
A BRIEF HISTORY OF
In the year 1880, a young, lad of eighteen years
decided to commence business as a Confectionery
Manufacturer.
He had no money to buy expensive machinery and
was only able to afford the purchase of a few pounds
of su&ar, an old sixpenny nail-can (which he used as a
stove), a tin pannikin (in which the sug,ar syrups were
boiled), and the “factory” was a bathroom in a modest
dwelling-place in Kerr Street, Fitzroy, Melbourne.
He made his Sweets on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wed-
nesdays and Thursdays, and carried them from shop to
shop on Fridays and Saturdays.
From this humble beg,innin&, this Confectionery busi-
ness has developed into the colossal institution of to-day,
occupying 17 immense factories, employing 2,600
operatives, and paying in wag,es over half-a-million
pounds sterling annually.
The romance of this organisation —the greatest
Confectionery establishment in Australia, and one of
the largest in the world —ranks amon& the most fasci-
nating stories of human achievement.


Here is shown the founder and proprietor of looking
down on models of the Factories where 1,000 kinds of Chocolates and
Confectionery —including “Max-Mints,” “Columbine Caramels” and “Old
Gold” Chocolates —are made.
