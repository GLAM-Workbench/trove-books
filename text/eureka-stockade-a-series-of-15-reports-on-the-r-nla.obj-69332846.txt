MINUTE of His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor authorizing a
Board of Enquiry , dated 30 th October, 1854.
Whereas it has been represented to the Lieutenant Governor that, on or
about the night of the 6th October instant, James Scobie was found murdered
on the Gold Field of Ballaarat, that after an investigation of all the circum-
stances of the case by the constituted authorities a riot was created, and a
building called the u Eureka ? Hotel was maliciously set fire to and burned:
The Lieutenant Governor, deeming it advisable to make further e. p. .s.sturt. F* q .
0 W. McCrea, M.D.
enquiry into this matter, has resolved to nominate a Board of Officers, named ? nacUtt ? Esq
in the margin, to investigate into and report upon all the circumstances
connected with the riot.
They will, therefore, proceed to Ballaarat, and having formed them-
selves into a Board, they will call before them all spell witnesses as they may
deem necessary, and examine them on oath, as far as may be legal, together
with any other persons who may present themselves for the purpose.
The enquiry should be directed to elucidate the following points :
1. Is there any ground for supposing that improper motives influenced
the Bench of Magistrates in their decision on the matter of the
murder ?
2. Was the conduct of the Police on the 17th day of October, on the
before-mentioned occasion, marked with that judgment and
firmness which it is the duty of Officers in the Public Service to
evince ?
3. Has the conduct of the Officers generally in the Camp at Ballaarat,
either during the execution of their duty or at other times, been
such as to inspire respect and confidence amongst the population
in general ?
4. Charges of corruption having been publicly advanced against the
Officers of the Ballaarat Camp, it will be the duty of the Board
p
in


narrowly to search and enquire whether there is any foundation
for such serious accusation, and they will specify the individuals
(if any) who they believe to be guilty.
5. They will also examine the Coroner, and investigate the evidence
upon which the verdict of the Inquest was given, and make a
general report thereon.
6. They will consider it their duty not to limit their enquiry to the
foregoing questions, but to obtain such information as may bring
to His Excellency?s cognizance the real foundation which led to
an outbreak on the part of the population, hitherto so well
behaved.

Melbourne,
Ylth November , 1854.
Sir,
I have the honor of forwarding you the Report of the Board of
Enquiry appointed by His Excellency to investigate into the late proceedings
at Ballaarat.
I have also forwarded the evidence taken on the occasion, together
with a letter from the Committee of a Diggers? League Association, setting
forth certain grievances, and which they earnestly requested the Board to lay
before His Excellency.
The Board having concluded their Enquiry, I beg to return you the
enclosed deposition which came from your office.
I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
E. P. S. STURT,
Chairman .
The Honorable the Colonial Secretary,

REPORT.
The Board of Enquiry , appointed by His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor for the purpose
of investigating the circumstances connected with the murder of James iScobie , at
Ballaarat , and the burning of the Eureka Hotel , and all other circumstances more parti-
cularly set forth in the letter of instructions, have the honor to submit the following Report
of their proceedings :
In accordance with the instructions received on the 20th October, the officers com-
posing the Board proceeded to Ballaarat, and, as a preliminary step, and with the view of
giving full publicity to the measures His Excellency had been pleased to take, in order to
be made thoroughly acquainted with the circumstances connected with and which occasioned
the late disturbances on the Gold Fields, your Board caused placards to be printed and
posted throughout the diggings, calling the attention of the public to His Excellency?s
proclamation, naming the hour and place at which the Board would hold their daily sittings,
and generally inviting all persons having any information to give to attend.
The Editor of the local newspaper was also requested to call attention to the notice;
and every means was taken to make known that His Excellency confidently trusted that
advantage would be taken of the opportunity thus offered of affording information to the
Government, and of representing any grievance which may have occasioned, or in any way
led to, the late outbreak.
The Editor of the paper above alluded to, the Ballaarat Times , took no notice of the
request made by the Board, a marked omission, tending to shew little disposition on the part
of this public journalist to support authority and good order.
The Board is, however, bound to bear testimony that through the instrumentality of
this gentleman some very important information was obtained.
The Committee of the Diggers? League, during their first interview, expressed a
doubt that many grievances would be withheld by persons having (as they stated) a want of
confidence in the Board as constituted.
The motive which actuated the Lieutenant Governor in the course he had pursued,
was pointed out by the Board, and that an alleged grievance must be supported by evidence.
Your Board feel bound to acknowledge that the disposition evinced by the gentlemen forming
this Committee (especially Mr. Humphrey, the Secretary), was in every way to meet the
enquiry with a fair and ready spirit; and they admitted that those who now refrained from
coming forward and supporting their complaints, might justly be deemed unworthy of credit
and future consideration.
A list of grievances was then handed in by the Secretary of the League, and the
Board proceeded with the examination of witnesses.
In reporting seriatim on the various subjects to which the Board have to direct their
attention, they are guided by the evidence bearing upon the point and most deserving of
attention.
Ist. The motives of the Bench in their decision on the matter of the murder .
After a searching enquiry, the Board have been unable to arrive at any decisive Vide Evidence ?
0 x * 7 Mr. Ximenes, No. 3.
conclusion upon the subject. Mr * Lynn> ? 5f


The only direct evidence in the matter worthy of consideration is that of Mr.
Ximenes, Sub-Inspector of Police, who brought up the witnesses for the prosecution, and
Mr. Lynn, attorney, employed by the friends of the deceased.
The evidence of either of these gentlemen does not reveal any motive, but tends to
shew there was an undue interruption by the police magistrate of the examination of the
witnesses. This may account, to some extent, for the prevailing feeling on the part of the
public, that a leaning existed in favor of the prisoner Bentley, which Mr. Dewes? (the police
magistrate?s) explanation does not entirely remove.
*l� * 6. With regard to the evidence of the constables, that an interview took place between the
\\ B*. prisoner and police magistrate during the adjournment of the Court, the Board cannot attach
much weight to it, and consider Mr. Dewes? explanation on this point worthy of credence;
the evidence of the constables did not wear a lucid or truthful aspect.
Messrs. Rede and Johnstone, the other presiding justices, do not appear to have taken
a leading part in the hearing of the case. The latter gentleman, Mr. Johnstone, expressed to
his brother magistrates his dissent to the decision, and Mr. Rede, the Board are satisfied, was
influenced by no feeling of partiality, but simply from an unwillingness to commit where the
evidence was apparently presumptive and against the voice of the chairman; a view of the
case much to be regretted, as the Board cannot but consider that the decision arrived at was
opposed to the evidence and facts elicited.
2nd. As to the conduct of the Magistrates and Police at the burning of the Eureka Hotel.
j! rrase?, UiSt ? X ,�* 12'. It is to be regretted that the magistracy should not have acted with greater
J. Emery, ? 23. promptitude in endeavouring to suppress the riot; but the evidence on this subject is very
j. Green, j.p., ? ss. conflicting. That which bears upon the matter is numbered in the margin for reference.
That a very general opinion prevailed to the effect that the discharge of Bentley was
opposed to the evidence and facts elicited, and a perversion of justice, resulting from
partiality or venal motives, there cannot be a doubt. This, added to the circumstance that
the Eureka Hotel, conducted by the prisoner, was of general bad repute, and deemed a focus of
crime, connived at by the authorities, created a unanimity in the popular feeling which might
have rendered more stringent measures, in attempting to suppress the riot, a hazardous
experiment; and there are many intelligent witnesses examined who are of opinion that
the course pursued by the magistrates at the riot was judicious, and dictated by a due regard
to the public interests.
c. r Dyt? eneS ? Your Board, however, cannot but concur in the opinion expressed by other witnesses,
e.?undemood ? 28.* in whom much confidence may be placed, that if at an early stage of the riot the Riot
Act had been read, the ringleaders arrested, and a determination shewn to enforce the law,
the well-disposed in the crowd would have dispersed, and the disaffected would have been
comparatively few and unwilling to expose themselves unsupported. Unfortunately, the
Resident Commissioner, not anticipating any serious disturbance, had merely sent Mr.
Green, J.P., the gold receiving officer, to watch the proceedings of the public meeting, and
was not present himself until the riot was at its height, and the passions of the people were
inflamed by drink. The Board are of opinion that, even after the Resident Commissioner
arrived on the ground, the riot might still have been suppressed, but certainly not without
sacrificing life to such an extent as the circumstances of the case would scarcely have
justified.
Your Board cannot but express their high sense of the steadiness, good conduct, and
untiring patience both of the military and police, the latter especially, who, assailed
by missiles and abuse, did not in a single instance lose the steadiness which should charac-
terize a well-governed force, or give vent to an impatience which the provocation might
reasonably have excited.


3rd. Has the conduct of the officers generally in the Camp at Ballaarat been such as to inspire
respect and confidence amongst the population in general ?
It is with extreme regret that the Board, in dealing with this subject, have to exclude
the name of two officers whose official conduct will be especially reported in the reply to the
fourth subject of enquiry. The evidence contains several charges and complaints against
the officers, a list of which was handed in by the Secretary of the League, together with
other charges preferred against the authorities, and stated to be some of the most prominent
grievances complained of; and it is desirable a statement of these grievances, together with
the result of the enquiries thereon, should be set forth.
List of grievances handed in to the Board by the Secretary of the Diggers ? League Association ,
with the result of the enquiries on each particular case.
COMPLAINTS.
No. 1.
Mr. Frederick Vern states that his mate, a person
named Monteith, was charged by Mr. Commissioner
Johnstone with not having his license. They were
working in Dalton?s Flat. Deposited �5 bail with
Mr. J ohnstone. Appeared next morning to answer
the charge, and waited from half-past nine till
twelve o?clock. The case was not called on ; and,
on speaking to Mr. Johnstone, was told the bail
was forfeited for non-appearance. This took place
in July last.
No. 2.
Mr. Frederick Yern states that in the beginning
of August last Mr. Commissioner Webster decided
a dispute, in Canadian Cully, against a party of
Americans, refused to hear their witnesses, and
gave their claim to the other party. Frederick Yern
declared that he heard one of the party, a man
named Littlejohn, in whose favor the claim was
given, assert that Mr. Webster was to have a ninth
share in the profits of the claim, and that the in-
justice of this decision caused great excitement in
the gully.
No. 3.
Mr. Frederick Yern also stated that he was
informed that an agreement had been seen between
Mr. Brandt and Mr. Commissioner Johnstone, by
which the latter was to receive a tenth share in
the profits of the Victoria Hotel.
No. 4.
James Brown. ?Complains against Mr. Johnstone
for refusing evidence, and causing him to be fined
170 ounces of gold.
No. 5.
John Toopy. ?Complaint against Mr. Johnstone.
No. 6.
Thomas Llewellyn.?Complaint against the police
at Madman?s Flat, that on the 2nd inst. a thief was
apprehended in his tent, and was taken up to Mr.
Webster?s camp, and was given in charge to the
police, who handcuffed him ; that the police knew
the prisoner was a notorious bad character; that
�2 6s. 6d. was taken from him by the police ;
that next morning the policeman informed him that
the man had escaped. Llewellyn reported this to
the commissioner, but no further notice has been
taken of the matter; nor has the conduct of the
policeman been enquired into.
A.?No. 27, c.
EXPLANATIONS.
No. 1.
In reply to this complaint, the Police Cause
Sheet and Record Book was referred to, but no
entry of such a case was to be found. Mr. Johnstone
stated his disbelief of such an occurrence, proving
that Dalton?s Flat was not within that section of
the diggings to which his duty extended during the
month alluded to, and denied the charge. Mr.
Yern promised to bring forward his mate to sub-
stantiate the charge, which was not, however, done,
though ample time was afforded by the Board for
this purpose.
No. 2.
Mr. Webster called for this person, John Martin,
alias Littlejohn, whom Mr. Yern promised to pro-
duce, but did not do so, subsequently stating by
letter that he, Littlejohn, had suddenly left the
locality where he was working, leaving his tent,
tools, and other things, and broadly insinuating by
the influence or agency of Mr. Webster, which,
however, the Board proved to have been impossible.
This accusation stands unsupported.
No. 3.
In answer to this, Mr. Brandt was summoned,
and, on oath, denied any agreement having ever
existed between himself and any official, and that
directly or indirectly no interest or share in his
business had been promised or alluded to by Mr.
Johnstone or any other officer. ? Vide Evidence,
No. 35.
No. 4.
This was a case of encroachment heard by the
Bench, of which Mr. Hackett, the acting stipendiary
magistrate, was the chairman.
No. 5.
The complainant did not appear to prosecute a
charge.
No. 6.
Mr. Webster received this report, and informed
the Inspector of Police of the circumstance, which
he deemed all that was necessary for him to do.
The Board called the attention of the Inspector of
Police to this complaint, as there appeared most
culpable neglect on the part of the police constable
It appeared that the sergeant of police had reported
the escape of the prisoner from the custody of con-

amount to a general attack upon all the authorities.
Evidence of Mr, see- He complained of the Resident Commissioner acting in opposition to the orders of

the Lieutenant Governor respecting the licenses to storekeepers within a certain distance of
the township. This Mr. Rede disproved by his letter of instructions from the Colonial
Secretary. He complains of streets deviating from the lines laid down in the original
survey, to the detriment of the purchasers of land, ?a matter clearly for remonstrance to
the Government, not of complaint against the local authorities. He deprecates Mr. Johnstone?s
manner when presiding as a magistrate, and finally alludes to anonymous and other commu-
nications he has received accusing individuals of the camp, from policemen to commissioners,
of being influenced in their public duties by bribes and personal interest. He owns no
personal knowledge of these matters, but fervently believes in their truth.


John Manning, Reporter to the Ballaarat Times , also gave evidence, contradicted
by that of Mr. Green, and discarded from the consideration of the Board as unworthy J * 6reen ' N0,57 *
of belief.
Having thus gone through the complaints, your Board feel that they need hardly
comment on the very frivolous and, in most instances, unfounded and malevolent nature of
the charges.
Your Board consider that the Commissioners have evinced untiring patience in the
performance of their duties, involving questions requiring most intricate enquiries in the
settlement of disputed claims and encroachments, especially in the deep sinking; the officer is
then subject to the dishonest and unjust aspersions of the disappointed disputant. And it is
the opinion of the Board that, with the exceptions before noted, the conduct of the officers
generally on the Camp at Ballaarat has been such as to merit the respect and confidence of
the people; in support of which the evidence taken during the enquiry may be referred to.
4th. Charges of corruption having been publicly advanced against officers of the Ballaarat
Camp , to enquire narrowly into the foundation of such accusation , Spc,
It is a subject of deep regret to your Board that they have to comment strongly on the
conduct of the police magistrate, Mr. Dewes.
The facts elicited shew that Mr. Dewes laid himself under obligations to a class of
persons whose conduct in their capacity of licensed victuallers brought them under the
scrutiny and supervision of the Bench of which he was chairman, thereby subjecting himself
to influences unbecoming his position as police magistrate and a public officer.
The evidence which bears upon this subject is noted in the margin. That of Dr. James Stewart, No,
ll*
Stewart adverts to bills offered to him for discount, drawn by certain publicans in favor of
Mr. Dewes.
The evidence of Messrs. Marshall and Underwood, licensed victuallers, who, being James Marshall, xo.
sworn, stated on oath that they had severally advanced Mr. Dewes sums of money on his R - 28 Underwood ? no.
note of hand, which they then held ; that they advanced the money as an act of friendship
to Mr. Dewes, Mr. Marshall having been intimate with him in London, that the loan was
for the purchase of land, Mr. Dewes being in poor circumstances, and that no favor or con-
sideration directly or indirectly had been asked from or promised by Mr. Dewes to either
of them in his official capacity.
The evidence of Mr. Evan Watkins shews a somewhat similar transaction, Mr. Evan Watkins, no. ss
Dewes having borrowed the sum of �lOO, giving his note of hand for the same. A remark
of Mr. Dewes in borrowing the money is stated as in allusion to Mr. Watkins?s license,
the application for which was then filed in the Police Office, that u one good turn deserved
another; ? but it is due to Mr. Dewes to observe that this witness contradicted himself,
and shewed much hesitation when under examination.
Such acts your Board cannot too severely animadvert upon, as tending to subvert
public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the Bench.
Mr. William Tait, examined on oath, directly accused Sergeant Major Milne of w - Tait > No ? 24 -
receiving ten pounds ? hush ? money.
He stated that for two years he was a storekeeper; that the first six months his
business did not pay; that he then followed the example of others, and sold grog on the
sly; that it ? cost him for eighteen months five pounds per week as 4 hush ? money to the
police;? that Sergeant Major Milne had charge of the foot police at that time, and on one
occasion he gave him (Sergeant Major Milne) ten pounds.
This evidence your Board feel bound to give credence to, and to observe that the
Sergeant seems to have made himself generally unpopular, an ill-feeling, it is to be feared,
not unmerited.


sth. The Coroner and the investigation of the evidence upon which the verdict was given.
Your Board examined the foreman of the jury and most of the jurors.

grounds for supposing this gentleman was influenced by partiality. He had never seen
Bentley before, and courted a cross-examination of the witnesses by the jurors.
A more experienced officer might have led to a different verdict.
In conclusion to the enquiries,
Your Board would observe, that amongst the numerous complaints brought before them,
there were few that presented greater difficulties to consider than the settling of disputed
claims. The evidence before the Board demonstrated in the strongest manner the intri-
cacy of this subject, and the almost impossibility of giving satisfaction to the claimants
on opposite sides, even when both parties were honest and reasonable people, the compli-
cated nature of the disputes involving at times a degree of nicety that no person who is
not conversant with digging can have any idea of. The immense amount of property
often depending on the decision, and the great labor and expense which is frequently
incurred on a claim, all tend to cause a degree of dissatisfaction with the most equitable
judgment; but when one or both of the claimants are dishonest, as is often the case,
and when the most gross falsehoods are resorted to, and the most cunning schemes devised to
pervert justice, the decision of a claim requires the exercise of the greatest coolness, discrimi-
nation, and judgment; and after all one of the parties is sure to be dissatisfied with the
decision. Charges of corruption are frequently made against the Gold Commissioners.
several of these were brought before the Board, but in no instance was there a shadow' of
proof made out in support of the charge ; whilst too often the complaints bore on the face
of them the marks of disappointed dishonesty. These charges are easily made, and being
strongly asserted by interested persons amongst the body of the diggers, who have neither
the time nor means to ascertain their correctness, they are too readily believed ; thus putting
the officer who decides the claims in a false and antagonistic position with those whose con-
fidence he ought to enjoy.
A decS l of OI com! To reme( ty this state of things, your Board would suggest that a law be passed giving
08 jury P�wer to the Resident Commissioner, in cases of appeal from the judgment of the officer who
first investigates disputed claims, to appoint a jury of three (or such number as may be deemed
advisable) assessors, selected by him from Jury Lists of respectable diggers previously
prepared and revised in the manner Jury Lists usually are, giving a power of objection to the
disputants. These assessors to be sworn, formed into a Court, and every facility afforded
them for minute enquiry into the disputes. The disputants to deposit each a sum sufficient
to pay the expenses of the enquiry, out of which the assessors to be paid such sum as may be
deemed a liberal equivalent for their time. The decision of the assessors to be final.
Distribution of Police. After the district becomes thoroughly quiet and settled, your Board are of opinion
that an arrangement of the police force better adapted to the wants of the mining community
might be made than that which now exists. There is a strong feeling amongst the diggers
that the efficiency of the police is too much sacrificed to a military display and parade, which
is most offensive to them ; and that if the police, instead of being centralised into one or two
spots as they are now, were distributed more generally in smaller parties under trustworthy non-
commissioned officers, they would become better acquainted with the diggers, would be better
able to discriminate between the well and ill-disposed, and would be more readily available for the
protection of property and the support of law and order. Your Board are of opinion that a
number of constables should always be on duty parading the places where the diggers are
most congregated in the day time, and where the tents are thickest at night; that, in short,


the crowded spots should never be without one or two policemen within hail in any part of
them.
Your Board are of opinion the police are much crippled in the performance of their
more legitimate duty, viz., the protection of life and property and the preservation of peace
and order, by having their energies expended in hunting sly grog sellers and taking up
unlicensed miners. The police in both of these duties have made themselves very obnoxious
to the diggers, and it has had a most pernicious effect on the morals of the police force ?
on one hand holding out inducements to the police, by giving them shares of fines, to pay
an undue amount of attention to this lucrative branch of their duty, and in some cases to
commit perjury for the gain in prospect; on the other hand exposing them to bribery by the
sly grog sellers, for winking at the practices of such delinquents.
Your Board would suggest that this duty be performed by a detective police, who
never appear in uniform ; that this class be selected with the greatest care, and commanded
by a most trustworthy officer; and the general police would not then be subjected to that
unpopularity which prosecutions of this nature are sure to entail. With regard to the employ-
ment of the police in arresting unlicensed miners, your Board believe that no duty in which
the police are employed is so calculated to render them hateful to the population as this, not
only as to the direct effect of arresting miners who have no license, but indirectly, by calling
on those who have licenses to produce them, sometimes so frequently as to cause the greatest
irritation. Your Board are therefore of opinion, that were the license fee abolished, and the
police released from the false position in which they are placed by being made collectors of
revenue, their efficiency would be greatly increased, their moral influence with the community
would be raised, and, as a consequence, the extent of force which is now hardly adequate to
the duties required would then be no longer necessary. In making this reference to the
license question, which, without shutting their eyes to one of the greatest causes of discon-
tent, they could not avoid, your Board are aware that they are verging upon a complicated
and difficult question; but there cannot be a doubt that the present system is the great
source of irritation; that disturbances are sought as a medium through which to give vent
to the discontent occasioned by it; and thus the Commissioners and Police are brought into
anatgonism with the people, between whom confidence and respect should exist. To point out
the origin and latent cause of the recent outbreak and disturbances, your Board deem their
duty extends, but conceive it beyond their province to enter on the subject of a substitute
for this unpopular law. Whilst your Board would suggest that no just grounds of complaint
on the part of the diggers should be disregarded, at the same time they would urge the abso-
lute necessity of suppressing by all means (even the most stringent, if required) every
attempt on the part of the populace to take the law into their own hands. For this pur-
pose, your Board would suggest that an Act of Council be passed, empowering the Executive
to levy a rate on any particular district which may, by unlawful proceedings, either destroy
property or disturb the peace of the community; and that this rate be levied to such an
extent as to pay for all property so destroyed, or to cover all expenses incurred by sending
an extra force to quell the disturbance, and every other charge connected with it whatever.
Your Board, at the earnest request of the Members of the Committee of the Diggers?
League Association, have forwarded with the evidence taken a representation of the
grievances of the Gold Fields drawn up by themselves.

MINUTE of His Excellency the Lieutenant Governor upon the Report
of the Board of Enquiry .
The Lieutenant Governor having had under his consideration the Report of
the Board of Enquiry appointed to investigate the circumstances connected
with the murder of James Scohie, at Ballaarat, and the burning of the
Eureka Hotel, has found, under the fourth head of the Report, the following
observations;?
? It is a subject of deep regret to your Board that they have to comment strongly on the
conduct of the police magistrate, Mr. Dewes. The facts elicited shew that Mr.
Dewes laid himself under obligations to a class of persons whose conduct in their
capacity of licensed victuallers brought them under the scrutiny and supervision of
the Bench of which he was chairman, thereby subjecting himself to influences unbe-
coming his position as police magistrate and a public officer.?
The Lieutenant Governor entirely concurs with the Board in the sen-
timents expressed in their last paragraph, and directs that the name of Mr.
Dewes he erased from the Commission of the Peace, and that he be
informed that the Lieutenant Governor has no further occasion for his
services.
As the Report of the Board, under the same head, moreover, directly
criminates Sergeant Major Milne, the Lieutenant Governor desires that the
Attorney General be called upon to be so good as to state whether it is
advisable to prosecute the Sergeant Major for the breach of any of the
existing statutes.

disreputable one, frequented by very disorderly characters. The landlord encouraged these

No. 2.?Mr. George Webster examined.
. 1 am Assistant Civil Commissary, stationed at Ballaarat. lam a magistrate. I never con- Mr. g. Webster
ceivecl any conupt motive could be attributed to any member of the Bench of Magistrates in their 2nd November, 1
decision on the charge preferred against Bentley for the murder of James Scobie. I have heard of 1854,
diggers having attributed improper motives to the magistrates on that occasion, to the Bench gene-
rally, and to Mr. Dewes in particular. A system prevailed a little time ago with respect to the granting
ot licenses, entertaining applications at ordinary meetings of the Bench; but in consequence o"f
complaints as to the unfair dealing in such decisions, it was agreed to by the Bench that all appli-
catmns for licenses should in future be entertained at a special meeting of the Bench, called on the
uesday of every month. With the exception of this I know of no irregularity at the Bench
�_ i agistrates. No undue influence was ever, to my knowledge, exercised by any magistrate in
the granting of The conduct of the officers of the camp at Ballaarat has always been
such as is likely to conciliate and gain the confidence of the diggers generally. My opinion is that
the iclatrves, mates, and friends of the deceased, excited by his death, and deeming the landlord of
the Bui eka Hotel guilty of the murder, were the principal movers in the riot j that the vast majority
of the crowd on that occasion were mere spectators, and that the burning of the hotel was not
premeditated. I was not on the spot when the meeting took place, but when the military was sent
toi I went to the place. The object of the police seemed to be to protect the property of the
Euicka Hotel, which was being destroyed by the mob. I think the police might have taken a
better stand on the occasion. I asked Mr. Evans why the Riot Act had not been read, and he
said it was deemed by the other magistrates present inexpedient to read the Riot Act. Both


Mrt G. Webster, Mr. Rede and Mr. Amos endeavoured strenuously to appease the riot, as also did every officer
2nd�November, present; but there was no effort made to take the rioters into custody. It was deemed that many
1854 ? of the people were merely spectators, and that if the Riot Act had been read, and the crowd fired
upon, the innocent would have suffered; and then, if the crowd had become infuriate, that there
was not sufficient force to defeat any attack they might have made. I think that if the police
had been more determined at first, the riot might have been stopped, and the property saved } but
I was not there at the very first. The magistrates were certainly not acting from intimidation or
a jiy fear of the mob. I think the Riot Act ought to have been read, and that ii this had been
done before the mob collected round the house the property might have been saved. I never
conceived that the mob intended to burn the house, and I know that many of the violent speakers
at the meeting were conspicuously active in saving the property from the fire; I may mention
Mclntyre more especially on this head. This man was afterwards convicted, on clear evidence, of
setting fire to the hotel. Immediately after the riot was over two of the rioters who were known
to be active in it were arrested, and on their way to the camp were rescued by the diggers. The
two policemen in charge of the prisoners were the only force present when this rescue was made, to
my knowledge.
FRIDAY, 3rd NOVEMBER, 1854.
No. B.?Mr. Ximenes examined
Mr. Ximenes, lam Sub-Inspector of Police at Ballaarat. I was present during the examination of the
3rd November, w^nesseg on the c h ar g e preferred against Mr. Bentley on the 12th October, 1854, before Messrs.
Rede, Dewes, and Johnson. The witnesses for the prosecution were cross-examined by Mr.
Dewes in such a manner as to induce the counsel for the prosecution to complain of the frequent
interruption, and to state he would be obliged to throw up the case if such an interruption
continued. I was present on the 17th October, at the destruction of the Eureka Hotel. At ten
o?clock on that morning I was sent for by Captain Evans, to proceed to the Eureka Hotel with a
party of police, to protect the property of Mr. Bentley. The mob having shewn a considerable
feeling upon the dismissal of the charge against Bentley, the magistrates having been hissed in
court when the decision was given ; a meeting took place, at which some thousand people attended,
near the Eureka Hotel, near the spot where the body of the murdered man was found. I was
told by Mr. Evans that the police were not to go armed otherwise than with their staves. I
concealed the men in the house, in order to avoid any display. I went to the meeting to hear
what was going on. I saw no disposition on the part of the speakers to incite a breach of the
peace. Subsequently to the meeting a crowd collected in the front of the house, and a demand
was made for Bentley. Showers of stones were thrown, and the windows smashed. Mr. Evans,
Mr. Green, J.P., and Mr. Carter, Sub-Inspector of Police, were on the spot at this time. A
man named Yorkey struck the house with his fist, and said, ? I propose that this house belong to
the diggers.? I kept my men, who were unarmed, in the house, with the view of preventing a
forcible entry. At this time there were about thirty foot police and eighteen mounted men on the
ground, but none of the foot police were armed. The cries of the mob were for Bentley. I
desired him to mount my horse, shew himself to the mob, and then proceed to the camp, with a
view of drawing the mob from the scene of riot. This, however, he did not do, but galloped
away as fast as he could. I endeavoured to clear a space to give Mr. Rede an opportunity of
addressing the crowd, but did not succeed. Missiles were thrown, and shortly after the back of
the premises were fired. The military then came up. I asked Mr. Taylor, who was in charge of
the mounted police, why he did not clear the space in front. He replied that he could not
act effectually until the Riot Act was read. The mob were very excited. They were appealed
to by Mr. Rede and Mr. Amos; but so general was the excitement, that I cannot express an
opinion what would have been the result had the Riot Act been read and arms resorted to. I
never heard the magistrates appealed to to read the Riot Act. There must have been about five
thousand people collected. I believe that the general conduct of the officials on the Ballaarat
camp has been guided by civility and an earnest desire to perform their duty. I have heard
charges of corruption made against one official. Tdo not speak from my own knowledge, but I
heard it openly stated that Mr. Dewes was a part owner in the Eureka Hotel. I have since
heard the same repeated. In my opinion the real cause of the outbreak originated in the idea
that Bentley was the murderer, and that they were doing an act of retributive justice in burning
down his house. Mr. Evans and Mr. Carter made every endeavour to check the mob in their
violence by persuasion.
No. 4. Robert Milne examined.
I a J? Sergeant Major of Police at Ballaarat. I remember tlie circumstance of Bentley, the
1854. ' landlord of the Eureka Hotel, having been arrested on a charge of the murder of James Scobie.
lam aware that he was lemanded on bail. I know a man named Farrell, who had been residing
at the Eureka Hotel for six weeks or two months previous to the murder of James Scobie; in
what capacity Ido not know. Farrell was formerly chief constable at Gastlcmaine. lam aware
that Fan ell has had, on various occasions, communication with the police magistrate, Mr. Dewes,
between the time of Bentley s arrest and examination, also on the day of Bentley?s examination.
These inteiviews generally took place outside the Court House?on one occasion in Mr. Dewes?s
private room attached to the court. There was no one present at the interviews outside. I can-


not say whether there was any person present in the private room when the interview took place*
This interview took place after the dismissal of the charge against Bentley. I cannot say 3rd November,
whether any person was sufficiently near at the interviews that took place outside the Court House
to hear what was said, hut several persons were walking about. It appeared to be an open
conversation.
No. s.?Adam Loftus Lynn examined.
I am a solicitor, residing at Ballaarat. I have been practising at the Police Court, Adam Loftus
Ballaarat, since it was opened. I was engaged by the relatives of the deceased James Scobie for
the prosecution of Bentley. As to the motives of the Bench I can say nothing ) but I must 1854 *
observe that, in conducting the examination, I was so far interrupted by Mr. Dewes, the police
magistrate, that I remonstrated, and, on a repetition of a similar interruption, I said that I would
sit down if it were persisted in, and leave the case to the Bench. The interruption I complain of
was questions being put by Mr. Dewes to the witness Bernard Walsh, before he had time to reply
to the question upon which I was examining him, the point of which was obvious. I remarked
that I was opposed by a barrister and a solicitor on the other side, and that I looked to protection
from the Bench, and not interruption. In reply to question No. 8, I consider that within the last
twelve months there has been great improvement in the intercourse existing between the officials
and the public. The manner and mode of conducting public business have been more satisfactory,
particularly since the arrival at Ballaarat of Messrs. Bede and Dewes, and until the last unfortu-
nate outbreak an excellent feeling seemed to exist. I should attribute the real cause of the riot
at the Eureka to a feeling that justice had not been done in the decision which the Bench had
arrived at. I have never known any partiality exercised by the magistrates in the granting of
licenses or in their decisions.
No. 6. ? Michael Costelloe examined.
lam a police constable at Ballaarat. I was present at the first examination of Bentley. Michael Costelloe,
I know that when the Court adjourned the prisoner Bentley went into the police magistrate?s 3rd November,
room. I was speaking to another policeman about Bentley going into the room, when Farrell
said, ? You need not be uneasy, as he has leave to go in to speak to his lawyer.? He remained
about ten minutes in the room.
No. 7.?William Scharlach examined.
lam a police constable at Ballaarat. I was present at the examination of Bentley. Mr. November?
Dewes, the police magistrate, was on the Bench. I went into Mr. Dewes?s room. I saw Mr. 1354.
Dewes, Bentley, and another gentleman there. The latter was writing. Bentley was sitting on
the table. This was when the Court was adjourned.
No. B.?John Dougherty examined.
lam a police constable at Ballaarat. I remember the day Bentley was examined for the John
murder of James Scobie. I remember the Court being adjourned on that day. The prisoner 1 issl?
Bentley went into the police magistrate?s room during the time the Court was adjourned. He
remained there five or ten minutes.
No. 9.?Maurice Linquist examined.
lam an auctioneer, residing near the Eureka Hotel, Ballaarat. My premises were con- Mr. m. Linquist,
sumed by the fire which burned the hotel. I was present the whole time. The police were moving 3rd *�? mber �
backwards and forwards to keep the crowd back. They always gave way to the police. It is my
belief had the police taken prompt steps to disperse the mob it might have been effected ) but
later in the day, when the soldiers arrived, it would have been impossible. lam of opinion had
the Biot Act been read, and the people been ordered to disperse, the greater number would have
gone , but had the remaining riotous portion of the people been fired upon, the riot would have
become general over the whole diggings. In answer to question No. 3, for my part, I have
always been treated in a gentlemanly way by the officers on the camp. 1 have never heard any
person complain of having received different treatment; and I have never heard any officer spoken
ill of, with the exception of Sergeant Major Milne, who is said to be vindictive in his prosecutions,
and generally spoken ill of. I have heard no charge of corruption against any officer on the
camp, either on the bench or in licensing public houses, that I could give credence to.
No. 10.?Doctor Alfred Carr examined.
I have heard the motives of one member of the Bench questioned, but I speak merely from D *-
rumour. I allude to Mr. Dewes, on the occasion of the examination of Bentley. 1 have pre- 1 ei *
viously heard rumours that Mr. Dewes had a share in public houses which had been licensed by
him. I was present at the meeting held on the 17th of October. The speeches at that meeting
were not calculated to excite disorder further than they were calculated to produce the impression
that Bentley was Scobie?s murderer. lam of opinion that had the mounted police, when they


De 'cmtintJd m ? came on the g round ? acted promptly, the mob would have been dispersed. I was standing at the
3rd November, door of my own tent, close to the Eureka Hotel. The impression in the crowd round where I
IB � 4, was appeared to he, that the troopers had come to disperse the mob; and several, myself among
the number, went away. When the building caught fire I returned. The mob were, in my
opinion, encouraged to continue their violence in consequence of an impression on their minds
that the police were irresolute and inactive. The motives that actuated a part of the mob were
that justice had not been done, and that they ought to take the matter into their own hands.
My impression is that scarcely one respectable person was engaged in the destruction of the house.
There seemed to be an impression that the house, which was a badly-conducted one, was shewn
undue favor by being allowed to be kept open till one o?clock in the morning. lam of opinion
that had the Riot Act been read, and some of the rioters arrested, and the force present ordered to
disperse the mob, that force was quite sufficient to have done so, with very slight effusion of blood,
if any. But latterly the riot assumed a more serious aspect. The passions of the mob became
excited, and it would then have been a dangerous experiment to have used force; but even then,
I think, the mob might have been dispersed, but with greater effusion of blood. No force was
stationed to protect the property saved from the fire till the attention of the Inspector of Police
was called to the fact by a girl after a great part of the force had gone, when he proceeded to the
spot, and did his utmost to protect it. The number of people engaged in setting fire to the
building was small ; and though the buildings covered half an acre of ground, I believe the force
on the spot was sufficient in the first place, if properly stationed, to protect the property. With
reference to the inquest, I think a more experienced Coroner might have put more searching
questions; but my impression is that he conducted the inquest in an impartial manner. As far
as I could see, there was no leaning on the part of the Coroner to either side. The jury were
repeatedly urged by the Coroner to put such questions as might satisfy themselves. In reply to
question No. 8, I consider that during the whole of the last twelve months there has been a very
great improvement in the tone and manner of the officers and men belonging to the Ballaarat
gold field. At the present moment there is comparatively slight cause for complaint. The only
ground for complaint that I have heaid of was regarding the conduct of a constable towards the
servant of the Roman Catholic clergyman.
SATURDAY, 4th NOVEMBER, 1854.
No. 11.?James Stewart examined.
SS , * am , a ? edical Petitioner on the Ballaarat diggings. About six months ago a person
1854. named Burchell, who has now left the diggings, brought me two promissory notes, which he
requested me to cash. One of the notes was drawn in favor of Mr. Dewes/ by Mr. Marshall
who was then building an hotel of which he is now landlord. The other was drawn I believe
by Mr. Underwood, a wine and spirit merchant on the township. On learning That the notes
were drawn in favor of a person on the camp, I refused to have anything to do with them.
Burchell then told me that he would allow a large discount if I would cash the notes, and that
I was certain of their being paid, as they were compensation money, by which I understood that
the money was for some favors bestowed by Mr. Dewes on those gentlemen. Some time after
this Mr. Burchell came to me again, asking mo to advance about three hundred pounds to enable
Mr. Phillips to pay for some land, and that Mr. Dewes would give his I 0 U for the money. I
declined to do so. 1 have had business transactions on the camp, and I consider the conduct of
the officials at the camp was generally calculated to inspire confidence. I think the General
impression was, that the evidence was sufficient to commit Bentley. The decision arrived it bv
the dismissal of the case was, I believe, the solo origin of the outbreak. y
No. 12.? John Eraser examined.
I T am a B' old di , T La 7 e bccn on tho Ballaarat gold fields for the last two
1854. yeais. I was present at the burning of the Eureka Hotel. There seemed so general an indmna-
tion, both among the spectators and those more actively engaged in tho riot, against the proprietor
ot the hotel, that 1 do not believe a more active interference of tho authorities would have dis-
persed the crowd lam not of opinion that tho reading of the Riot Act would have been of any
seiviee. Ido not think the well-disposed spectators would have dispersed had the Riot Act been
read, and they been called upon to assist the authorities in supporting the law. As far as my
knowledge the duty of the officials at Ballaarat camp is conducted in a courteous and proper
manner. I have heard rumours as to corrupt means having been employed to influence the
Bench in Bentley s case. I have taken a letter from Mr. Bush, of Eureka, to Mr. Bowes. Tho
tenor of the letter was introducing me to Mr. Dewes as a partner of Mr. Bush?s in an inn which
was to bo erected about seven miles from hence. The object was to come to an arrangement with
Mr. Dewes about obtaining a license for the inn. The letter also contained a proposition from
Mr. Bush, Sutherland, and myself, to the effect that if licenses were granted for two houses one
of which was to bo erected on his own (Mr. Dewes?s) land, near Lake Learmonth, he was to have
one-fourth of the profits arising from one house. We understood from Mr. Bush that there was
no chance ot getting a license for our own public house unless wo consented to erect one on Mr
Dewes s land, and give him one-fourth of the profits of the latter, as well as to leave him all tho
improvements on the promises when we loft. The one-fourth of the profits alluded to I under-
stood to be a bonus for granting tho license, and not for the rent of tho land


No. 13.? Samuel Butler examined.
lam a gold digger. I passed Sergeant Major Milne in the camp yard on the morning of
4th November,
the 26th October. He made some remarks at my looking at him. I listened to the business in 1554,
the court, and in coming out I was arrested by him, without any charge being preferred against
me, and confined in the watch-house, and not allowed to see any of my friends. I was arraigned
the next morning on a charge of burning the Eureka Hotel. The case was heard, and immediately
dismissed. They would not allow me to have my breakfast, which was brought me by my friends.
I have never had any cause of complaint against any of the officials of the camp, with this excep-
tion. Since I have been on Ballaarat gold fields the conduct of the officials has been such as to
inspire confidence amongst the diggers.
No. 14.? John Butler examined.
lam a gold digger. I was apprehended last night in Hitchcock?s Gully for having no 4 � h � o � u ?|; r e ? r _
license. We were marched about six miles to the watch-house. We were confined all night. 1854.
We were remanded till this day. I have not been brought up at all. The watch-house is swarming
with vermin. There were only three blankets for nine men who were confined last night. The
magistrate remanded us last night till this morning; but I was never charged. I was glad to
borrow �5 to deposit with the watch-house keeper for my fine. The water we were given to
drink had been used for washing a dog; it was quite soapy. There is a young man confined now
in the watch-house who has inflammation of the foot. It is in a dreadful state. The watch-house
keeper refused to give him water to bathe his foot, though the doctor who visited him ordered it.
No. 15.? Charles Dyte examined.
I was present at the burning of the Eureka Hotel. I went to the meeting previously, at the November,
request of Mr. Bentley, with whom I was intimate. I came back to Mr. Bentley, and told him 1854.
my impression was that there would be no disturbance. I thought the crowd would have groaned
and passed on, as is usual with English crowds. I remained in the hotel till after Bentley left,
and was about it until it was fired. I believe that the stones first thrown were by boys, and that
in consequence of the inactivity of the authorities the crowd went on from one act to another till
the hotel was burned. When the military came up, had the magistrates read the Riot Act, the
hotel would have been saved. Ido not think it would have been necessary to resort to force to
disperse the mob. I think the reading of the Riot Act would have been sufficient. Ido not
think there were fifty evil-disposed persons there. As the riot increased, and success crowned the
efforts of the evil-disposed, their number increased. I believe that on that occasion, if it had been
necessary to resort to force, and even shed blood, for the purpose of dispersing the rioters, the effect
would have been good. I most decidedly attribute the destruction of property which took place
on that day to the indecision exhibited by the authorities. I look forward with fear to the effect
of the apathy shewn by the authorities on that day; and I believe that had the riot been promptly
suppressed on that day, even if blood had been shed, the effect on the future prospect of the
digo-ino-s generally would be most salutary. When the bowling-alley was set on fire on that
occasion, I heard some of the foot soldiers of the 40th Regiment ordered by an officer to pull down
the end of the bowling-alley, which was not yet fired, for the purpose of stopping the fire. I heard
the soldiers distinctly refuse to obey the order, saying it was no part of their duty to do so. I
had property in a store connected with the hotel, and I was a creditor of Bentley?s to some amount
for goods supplied. I have been a storekeeper for about twelve months on the diggings. I have
never had cause to believe that a charge of corruption could be substantiated against any of the
officers on the camp. I saw Mr. Dewes twice at Bentley?s Hotel?once before and once after the
house was licensed. My impression was that one of these was a duty visit.
No. 16. ?Francis Oxley examined.
I received a message from Scobie?s brother, objecting to any inmate of Bentley?s Hotel
sitting on the jury. I have been in the habit of summoning juries. With the assistance of the i 864.
police 3 1 summoned the jury on this occasion. I knew Green, Gillot, and Anderson. I saw
these people accidentally near the hotel. I took the first men I met. I was not aware whether
Green was an inmate of Bentley?s Hotel. I received no directions from any one, with the
exception of the objection to any inmate of Bentley?s Hotel, as to the summoning of the jury.
They were sworn in the usual manner. I did not state to the Coroner the message concerning
the objection to any of the inmates of the hotel sitting on the jury.
No. 17.? John Campbell examined.
I was a juryman on the inquest held on the 7th October, on the body of James Scobie. I l
consider that the conduct of the Coroner on that occasion was not what it ought to be. My name 4th November,
is attached to the statement contained in the Ballaarat Times of the 14th October. The first 1854 *
instance in which I found fault with the conduct of the Coroner was on viewing the body. In
answer to a desire of a juryman that medical evidence might be sent for, the Coroner said ? that
the duty of the jury was to see the body, a post mortem examination would then be performed, *


J j�R?[hammn, and . after that he ??g ll * S� to Heaven.? I consider this a loose remark. In the evidence of
continued, ? William Duncan, the barman, he said he opened the door and saw two men, when the Coroner
4 JV ]Bs4 mber ? interrupted him, and said, ? You heard two men.? The barman stated he opened the door, when
the Coroner corrected him, and said, ?It was not the outer door.? The witness said ?No but
the door of the supporting room.? Our impression was that the mode of the Coroner?s examina-
tion of the witnesses tended to lead to the exculpation of Bentley. The Coroner afforded us every
facility of examining the evidence and asking as many questions as we chose. The impression on
my mind is that the Coroner had some motive for exculpating Bentley, but we are not aware of
any circumstances which could actuate him.
No. 18.? William Corkhill examined.
lam a gold digger, residing at Ballaarat. I took a message from George Scobie to the
1854. Coroner?s constable, objecting to any of the inmates of Bentley?s Hotel sitting on the jury. I
subsequently saw a man named Green, who had been for some time an inmate of the hotel, on the
jury. There was no objection that lam aware of raised by any person to Green?s sitting on the
jury till after the jury was sworn.
No. 19.? Peter Lalor examined.
4th November, was present at the inquest held on the body of James Scobie. During the evidence of
1854. the boy Walsh, Bentley was sent for. He sat between two jurors; and I saw him whispering to
one of them, whose name was Green. This was not taken notice of by the Coroner, nor was his
attention directed to it. While the jury were retired to consult on the verdict I saw the Coroner
speaking to Bentley in a distant part of the room. Bentley had left the room before the jury
returned. When they gave their verdict he was sent for, and the verdict read to him. The
Coroner then said, ? Gentlemen of the jury, you could find no other verdict.? Mr. Bentley asked
whether the jury did not exonerate himself and the character of his house from all suspicion.
The Coroner replied, without appealing to the jury, that with the two witnesses in his favor,
there could be no suspicion against him.
No. 20.?Walter Anderson examined.
I was foreman of the jury on the inquest held on the body of James Scobie. I have read
1854. the advertisement in the Ballaarat Times of 14th October, containing insinuations against the
Coroner. I believe the only part of the statement in that paper which was correct was the
paragraph relating to one of the jurors, named Henry Green, being objected to by the friends of
the deceased. Green was objected to because he was an inmate of the hotel on the night of the
occurrence. The Coroner overruled the objection. I believe that on that occasion the Coroner
his best to elicit the truth without partiality. The Coroner did not either directly or
indirectly influence the witnesses or the jury on the inquest. The jury retired for about ten
minutes, and were unanimous in their verdict.
No. 21.?John Edward Broadhurst examined.
Li B^oadhu/st, E * lam a Lieutenant in the 40th Regiment, stationed at Ballaarat. I was ordered on the
4th November, 17th October, on the requisition of the Resident Commissioner, to proceed to the Eureka Hotel
with the force under my command. I did so. On arrival I formed my men on the right side of
the building for a quarter of an hour, and then received orders from the Resident Commissioner
to occupy the building. There was a crowd there when I arrived, some of whom were throwing
stones at the building. There was a disposition on the part of the crowd to destroy the building.
The commissioners and magistrates seemed to be trying to dissuade the people from destroying
the building. I have not been accustomed to mobs ; but had I been in command on the occasion,
I would have read the Riot Act, and ordered them to disperse. This generally has the effect of
dispersing all but the evil-disposed. The effect of not reading the Riot Act usually has the
effect of leading people to believe the place would not be resolutely protected; but what the effect
would have been in this instance I cannot say, for I saw a number of determined-lookino* fellows
who did not seem to care whether the Riot Act was read or not. We turned some people who
were in the building out of it, and the fire immediately broke out. I then withdrew my men
from the house. I did not at any part of the time order my men to assist in extinguishing the
fire, and, under the circumstances, I would not have done so.
MONDAY, 6th NOVEMBER, 1854.
No. 22.? Ralph Gray examined.
oti T las one of the first P ersons who applied for a license, but did not succeed in getting one.
1854. ' I applied for the ground near the present house occupied by Underwood; I applied to Mr. Dewes.
He told me, ?If you were to give me �lOOO you could not get it there; but I will let you a piece
on my own land for the purpose.? He promised to go with me the next day to the land, near
4 Learmonth Lake, and shew it me. Mr. I)ewes proposed that I should build the house and stock


it; my partner, William Bowington, and myself were to conduct the business of the house, and Ralph Gray,
Mr. Dewes was to have a one-third share in profits. I thought it would not answer: there were
sixteen acres of land, at �8 per acre, and the house, &c., would cost about a thousand pounds. 1854,
When I refused this offer, Mr. Dewes said I might go anywhere about the Canadian Gully, so I
put in an application. When I was getting the timber I found that several other houses were in
course of erection near where I wished to go before, though I was the first applicant. Mr. Dewes
replied, it was not his fault that Underwood and McCrae had got their license; but that he should
not let Patterson have it, at least with his consent. He also said, ? There are two places on the
Buninyong and Ballan Roads which are suited for sites for public houses. You may have either,
if you like to erect one. I took neither of these offers; nor did Igo on with the house in
Canadian Gully. I have been three years at Ballaarat. I was not at the fire at the Eureka
Hotel. I have seen a good deal of the officers of the camp in the course of business. The general
conduct of the officers has been, to my own knowledge, such as to inspire confidence and respect
amongst the diggers, with the exception of Sergeant Milne, who appears to have gained the ill-
will of everybody. The commissioners and the police, with the above exception, have performed
their duties with uprightness and courtesy. My impression, collected from the general opinion
abroad, is, that had the police not shewn at the hotel, it would not have been consumed. I
believe that if the authorities had acted with more firmness, had arrested the ringleaders, and
fired on the people, that there would have been a general attack. I believe it was from a feeling
that a gross wrong and injustice had been committed in discharging Bentley that the riot origi-
nated, that this feeling was general, and had the authorities resorted to force it would have been
generally resisted; consequently I think the authorities-were right in not shedding blood on the
occasion. I do not think there would have been such unanimity of purpose and feeling in any
other case or question of a dissimilar kind. On refusing my first application, Mr. Dewes stated
it was too near the camp. He said he could not help Underwood and McCrae getting their
licenses, but Patterson, who was applying still nearer the camp, should not succeed with his
consent.
No. 23.? John W. Emery examined.
I am a gold digger, residing at Ballaarat. I am an American citizen. I came from John w. Emery
Boston. I was part proprietor in the bowling-alley attached to the Eureka Hotel, which was Gth November �
burned. I was standing at Dr. Carr?s tent when the mob came from the meeting to the hotel, on
the 17th October last. Mr, Evans and some others came up with the mounted police to the house,
and the mob followed them ; the mob surrounded the house. The mob groaned, and some boys
threw stones. Afterwards the men threw stones. The mob then tried to get the lamp post down,
and not succeeding, they pushed the top off with a pole. A man with a spade then commenced
breaking the sashes in. They then pushed poles through the windows, and shortly after shouted
that the alley was on fire. The mob were throwing missiles at the police. I went towards the
alley, when the mob called me back, and I thought it best to come back. They then set fire to
the alley, next to the dinner hall, next to the stables, and at length the hotel. The head of the
police was present at the first. When the mob commenced smashing the windows, Mr. Rede, the
Resident Commissioner, attempted to address them out of one of the broken windows. The mob
would not listen to him, and then Mr. Amos addressed them. They listened to him for a few
minutes, and then re-commenced the work of destruction. The police attempted to check the
mob, but did not arrest any one. My belief is that had the police and military acted with promp-
titude the mob would have been scattered. Bome powder in a flask went off in the hotel, the
effect of which alarmed the mob, who ran in all directions. I feel sure that had force been used
by the authorities the mob would have been dispersed. My belief is that had neither police nor
military gone to the hotel the mob would not have then destroyed it; but there had been frequent
threats, and I believe they would ultimately have done so. I blame the military and police for not
trying to stop the riot by capturing some of the ringleaders or charging the mob. The police and
military rode round, but did nothing. The mob threatened that if any of the rioters were captured
they would rescue them ; they also said that the military might fire on them once, but before
they could fire again they, the mob, would rush in and disarm them. My own opinion is that
they would have done no such thing, but would have fled on the first discharge. The mob had no
firearms or weapons by which they might execute their threat. If the military had fired upon the
mob, and scattered them, I think the effect would have been better than it is now, and that they,
the mob, would not take so much liberties as they take at present. I have no doubt bloodshed
would irritate the diggers and give them a desire to rise, but I do not believe they had the pluck
to do so, and that a firm line of conduct on the part of the authorities would have given a whole-
some check to the riots. In my opinion there was a decided want of the firmness necessary for
the occasion. My opinion is free and uninfluenced by the loss I have sustained, or any hope that
the Government will repay that loss. I was present at the examination of Bentley for the murder
of Scobie, and, according to the evidence there, I consider he ought to have been committed. I
did not see anything on the examination to induce me to imagine that the Bench was actuated
by any motives in favor of Bentley. I believe they acted from conviction, although their con-
viction is opposed to mine. The head men on the camp, as far as I can say, have always done
their duty uprightly and courteously. I can say the same of the Commissioners deciding claims.
In regard to the privates of police, I have frequently seen them drunk, but I have not observed
any harshness or want of propriety in the execution of their duty. Mr. Evans, the Inspector of
Police, is in bad odour with many persons, principally sly grog sellers, and those who loaf round


John w. Emery, them. He is not in disrepute with the well-behaved and high-principled portion of the com-
ath Notemtr, munity. I have never heard of any well-authenticated instance of hardship or injustice against
1R54. ? E an( j IJo no t believe that he can be jusdy accused of any. The general conduct of the
officials at the camp is such as to inspire confidence in the well-disposed diggers; it is only the
rowdy ones that are dissatisfied. I think there is a general feeling amongst the majority of the
diggers against Sergeant Major Milne; he has been accused of perjury and bribery, but I have no
personal knowledge of the matter. I have heard no charge of corruption against any official
except the charges against Sergeant Milne. I have also heard frequently that Mr. Dewes had an
interest in Bentley?s house. I often heard this previous to the murder of Scobie. I have seen
him sometimes at the hotel. I have heard that Mr. Dewes advanced money to carry on the
business of Bentley?s Hotel.
No. 24.? William Tait examined on Oath.
William Tait, I am proprietor of the Turf Inn, near Ballaarat. I have been located near Ballaarat for
sth November, y ears an( j a h a ]f. I followed the calling of storekeeper for the first two years. I
did not sell any spirits the first six months. Finding I could not carry on business without
selling spirits, I commenced doing so. For the last eighteen months of my business as store-
keeper it has cost me on an average five pounds a week for ? hush ? money, to prevent
information being given; this was principally given in goods, not in cash. I have been ordered
at twelve o?clock at night out of my bed to supply a party of ten or twelve police with spirits,
for which I was never paid. It was well understood that if I asked for payment an information
would be laid. I gave ten pounds at one time to Sergeant Major Milne. This occurrence
took place at his (the Sergeant Major?s) private tent. I was receiving a bail deposit of fifty pounds
for a prisoner whom I bailed the day before. I took forty pounds from oft the table where Milne
had placed it. I left ten pounds on the table. He called my attention to it. I did not like
absolutely offering it to him, but I nodded, and he took the money up. No observation was made.
I found the business of storekeeper ruinous. I purchased land and built a house, intending to
apply for a license. I sent in an application for a publican?s license, signed by five respectable
persons, householders. A person named Pearson called on me : he is a traveller for a wine and spirit
merchant, named Allen, at Buninyong. He asked me if I had made it right for my license. I
replied, ?No, that I saw no occasion for doing so.? He said, ? Very well, you will see.? When
the house was nearly completed I made application to Mr. Dewes to inspect it. He said he would
come in three days. He did not come. Some days after I had a visit again from Pearson. He
asked had I got my license. I replied, ?No ; Mr. Dewes promised to come on Saturday, but did
not do so.? On the first occasion that Pearson called upon me he said to me, ?If you will give
me the title deeds of your house, I will give you three hundred pounds? worth of spirits on the
deeds, and insure you a license.? I refused. On the second occasion Mr. Pearson asked me to
give him an order for spirits, and he would insure Mr. Dewes would come out and inspect the
house. I refused. A week after my first application I made a second one for the house to be
inspected to Mr. Dewes personally. He promised to call next day. He did not come. About
four or five days afterwards I had a third visit from Pearson. He enquired whether Mr. Dewes
had yet inspected the house. I said, ? No.? He said, ? Well, my boy, give me a small order, and
I will insure Mr. Dewes will come out next day with Mr. Allen.? I replied that I would not
give him an order then, but that if Mr. Allen brought Mr. Dewes out I would give an order. Two
days after that Mr. Allen and Mr. Dewes came out. The house was inspected, and found fit, and
two days after I obtained a license. I know of no instance of corruption other than what I have
named that can be alleged against any official on the camp at Ballaarat. I gave a small order to
Mr. Allen, simply to keep my word.
TUESDAY, 7th NOVEMBER, 1854.
No. 25.? Peter Patterson examined on Oath.
Peter Patterson, lam a storekeeper, residing at Ballaarat. I have been on the Ballaarat Diggings in the
7th mber ? capacity of digger and storekeeper for near four years. I have never on any occasion been
required to give a bribe to any one on these gold fields, and I have never on any occasion given
money, drink, or goods to any of the detectives or police. I do not, from my own knowledge,
think that there is any truth in the charges of corruption made against some of the officials. I
have been both juror and assessor. From my knowledge of the officials of the camp, their public
duties have been performed so as to merit the confidence of the well-disposed. On my oath, I
have never directly or indirectly been expected to give any consideration for the promise of my
license.
No. 26.? James Marshall examined on Oath.
James Marshall, I have been on Ballaarat since last Christmas. I came up in November, 1858, and pur-
7th ? N iBs4 mber ? c^ some land at the land sale. I built a house on the land I bought, and when nearly com-
pleted, I applied for a license, which I obtained on the 26th of June. I have been engaged
superintending the building of the house since Christmas. About May last I advanced Mr.
Dewes two sums ?one of one hundred and fifty, and the other of one hundred and seventy-one


pounds, either in bills or promissory notes ?one was payable at three, and the other at four
months. He stated he wanted to buy some land, and I lent him the money. I have since paid 7th November,
both bills, and Mr. Dewes owes me the money. Mr. Dewes was a personal friend of mine in
England, and it was on this account I lent him the money. I solemnly swear that my accommo-
dating Mr. Dewes with this money had nothing whatever to do with any benefit past or contingent
which I had received, or was to receive from Mr. Dewes, and it had nothing whatever to do with
the license for my house. I was at the Police Court when Bentley was examined. I heard part
of the evidence, which tended strongly to criminate Bentley.
No. 27.?William Carroll examined.
A mare belonging to me was stolen two months ago. lat once reported the circumstance
to the police, and gave a description of the brands to the Sergeant Major. I offered a reward of ' *1854.
�2O on conviction of the thief, and �5 if strayed. 1 then went to the office of Linquist, the
auctioneer, with my brother, and in his presence I entered the description of the mare myself very
accurately, in what Mr. Linquist?s clerk called ? a stolen horse book.? The next morning I
started for the Avoca, and was three or four days before I returned. About twenty minutes after
my leaving Ballaarat to go to the Avoca, my brother and my wife saw the mare passing tbe door
of my hut, going to Linquist?s auction yard. My brother went after her, saw the mare in Linquist?s
shed, claimed her, and sent for a policeman. Lie did the latter in consequence of Mr. Linquist
denying that the mare was mine. The mare was entered on Mr. Linquist?s book for sale, with an
alteration in every brand, the description in the entry being entirely false, even to the color, the
mare being entered as a chesnut, though her color was a light bay. Mr. Linquist refused at first
to give her up, but did so when the police came, stating that it was a mistake of the clerk. When
I returned I took out a summons for Mr. Linquist for having a mare in his possession known to
be stolen. When the case came before Mr. Lewes, the police magistrate, I requested that the
clerk and the books might be produced, but they were not done so. The case was dismissed by Mr.
Lewes, who remarked that he had no power to do anything in it, other than to report the
circumstance to the Colonial Secretary, and recommend Linquist?s license to be suspended.
Linquist is, however, still selling, and there is scarcely a day but what some stolen horse is taken
from his sale yards. The same day that my mare was taken out of the yards, two prisoners were
taken by the policy together with the horses they had placed in Linquist?s hands. These horses
were stolen, and the prisoners convicted and sentenced, one of them remarking to the auctioneer,
? that were there not such horse dealers as him, there would be no horse stealers.? I have been
three years on Ballaarat, digging and store keeping. As a storekeeper or otherwise, I have
never been asked for a bribe, or would I offer one. I have heard that the hearing by the
magistrates of Bentley?s case was a partial one. Mr. Rede and Mr. Lewes were blamed for
it. � I never heard a word against Mr. Rede as an upright, conscientious officer. I cannot
say the same of Mr. Lewes; I believe him to have shewn partiality It was generally remarked
that it was a wonder Bentley did not lose his license; the house was of infamous repute. As
one of the oldest residents in the Colony, I can say I never knew so shamefully conducted a
house. The worst characters lived about his place 3 midnight robberies were frequent, and life
and property were not safe. So exasperated are the respectable portion of the people at the
impunity with which these offences were committed, that I believe were a man caught in the
act of a theft, the people would hang him themselves. When Mr. Foster McKenzie
were here, there were night patrols, and quiet and order prevailed; the best feeling existed
towards the police. Had Mr. Foster not been removed, we were willing to enrol ourselves
as a force for the assistance and co-operation of the police. I never now see a night patrol
or police on duty at night. We all regret Mr. Foster leaving. I was at the meeting on
the 17th October, before the burning of the Eureka Hotel. I was there till Bentley got
away. I believe the mob went down to the hotel without any intention of burning it. The
impression on the minds of the people was, that justice was utterly denied; and had Bentley
been arrested that day, I do not believe the hotel would have been burned. I think
that if the police had arrested the rioters, and attempted to put the riot down by force,
it would have made matters worse; the mob would have resisted, and blood would have
been shed. The mob were not armed on that day, and Ido not think there was any intention
of a riot. If the Riot Act had been read, no doubt many would have dispersed. If the
authorities had acted promptly, and dispersed the remainder, even by force, I have no doubt
the hotel would have been saved. It is my opinion that the hotel was burned by the black-
guards, and that, had the riot been suppressed even by the shedding of blood, the well-disposed
people would have assisted the authorities, if the authorities had shewn themselves worthy of it.
By this I mean that had the authorities shewn, by arresting Bentley, that they were disposed to
do the people justice, all the well-disposed would have aided the authorities in suppressing the
riot and saving the hotel. It was the conviction that justice had been denied which prevented
the well-disposed acting with the authorities; but the fact is, that the people have no confidence
in the police; the general idea is, that the police are only employed in hunting unlicensed
diners, not in the suppression of crime. The blame is not attributed to the men of the police,
butto the officers. The late riots have been occasioned, in the first place, by a general feeling
on the part of the diggers that their lives and property were not properly protected by the police.
This feeling rose to a culminating point when the charge against Bentley was dismissed ; but I am


Wi cin7mS? oll, certa^n had t^ie P�^ ce been efficient, that meeting would never have been called, and no
7th November, riot would have taken place, I have never seen any uncourteous conduct on the part of the
jsm. Commissioners since Mr. Fenwick and Mr. Cockburn left this place; but there is a general
feeling against the treatment received by the servant of the Roman Catholic clergyman from
Mr. Johnstone and trooper Lord. With the exception of Mr. Bentley?s affair, there is not, that I
am aware of, any feeling against Mr. Rede. Mr. Amos, who has been long amongst us, is much
and generally respected. There is an entire and general want of confidence in Mr. Dewes ? every
one complains of him. To Mr. Dewes we attribute the want of justice complained of. The want
of police protection we attribute to Captain Mac Mahon. lam confident a better system
might have been adopted by which the police might have been rendered more efficient. The
police are too much crowded in one place. The detectives we had here, who were extremely
useful, were removed by Captain Mac Mahon. The promises made us by Mr. Foster the
Colonial Secretary, both here and in town, have not been performed. He promised that
police should be stationed up and down the diggings. This has not been sufficiently
done. The police should be scattered in smaller parties, and mix among the diggers in
plain clothes, by which means they would obtain information where all the bad characters
lived. It is the clear interest of the diggers to give this information, and they would readily
do it if the police were amongst them; for instance, if a depredator, driven from some other
diggings, arrived on this gold field, where the population is stationary, and the people well
known to each other, a new comer is at once remarked, and would readily be brought under
the notice of police moving about in plain clothes. I mean, if the police moved about the diggings
there would be mutual confidence established between them and the well-disposed portion of the
people.
No. 28.?Robert Underwood examined on Oath.
Vxovembet . 1 h ave keen two years � n the Ballaarat township. Before obtaining a publican?s
1854. license I conducted a wholesale wine and spirit merchant?s business. I was on intimate terms
with Mr. Dewes : he wished to purchase some land. I lent him one hundred pounds for the
purpose; he gave me an IoUas an acknowledgment, to be repaid upon the sale of the allotment
of land purchased. This I 0 U I never allowed to go out of my own hands. My intimacy with
Mr. Dewes commenced soon alter he came to Ballaarat. I thought Mr. Dewes an upright man, and
on that belief I lent him one hundred pounds. It is about three or four months since I lent him
the money. I asked Mr. Dewes if I could be certain of getting a license, provided I built a good
house. He said I could. This was before I lent him the money. I have never interfered with
Mr. Dewes or any other magistrate, either directly or indirectly, in order to obtain a license for
any one. The money I lent Mr. Dewes had nothing whatever to do with my obtaining a license.
If I had been refused a license I would have lent Mr. Dewes the money the same. I was at
the burning of the Eureka Hotel. I spoke to Mr. Evans, inspector of police, and advised him to
stop the riot, and read toe Riot Act. Mr. Evans and myselt went to Mr. Green, and requested
him to read the Riot Act. He said he would, and was proceeding to do so, when Mr. Seekamp,
the editor of the Ballacu'at 1 imes , came up, and said it was useless, as they were determined to
burn down the place. I said it was a shame to look on and see property destroyed. It was Mr.
Seekamp?s interference that stopped Mr. Green from reading the Riot Act. This was before Mr.
Rede came on the ground. lam confident that had the Riot Act been read, it would have put a
stop to it. I have often been at the Court, and within my knowledge I consider that the conduct
of the officers has been upright and just. In deciding claims and disputes, many disappointed
parties make unreasonable complaints. I have heard persons state that decisions would be given
from corrupt motives, but I know of no instance of the kind, nor have I ever attempted such an
influence myself. 1 believe that latterly, the diggings not being so productive, a number of per-
sons having been ill-off* for money, idle characters, ready to join in any row that might turn up,
and to take advantage of any circumstances that might occasion a riot. I think the riot was
caused by people of this description. I know many men who will not work : the discontent
originates with them, and they are glad to get up a disturbance to suit their own ends. I con-
scientiously disbelieve the report that Mr. Dewes had any interest in the Eureka Hotel.
WEDNESDAY, Bth NOVEMBER, 1854.
iNo. 29.? John C. Wilkes examined.
November* , ?,, I f m / ? d ?gg er , residihg on the Eureka. I got a refreshment license, and set up a tent in
1854. ? nl last. On Monday I commenced selling refreshments. On Tuesday I ordered a case of brandy
ior my own use, and bought a porter cask, containing about ten gallons of sour porter. The cask
was a ogs ead, and I bought it for holding water ; I had it filled with water, and used it for the
purpose of laying the dust; there was a cock in it. On Wednesday morning I was taken up by
the police, under Sergeant Milne, for grog selling; the same day I was fined �5O, on the evidence
o two policemen, who swore they had purchased two nobblers of brandy in my tent on the Mon-
day evening previous. The mixture in the cask was alleged to be porter. Sergeant Milne said
was not fit to keep a tent of that kind, as I was not able to roll a man over and shake him.


No. 30.?Thomas Llewellyn examined.
On Thursday evening, 2nd November, my mate Jones came up to my tent; it was the Thos. Llewellyn
second night he was on the diggings. He was sleeping in my tent alongside of me; that night Bth T iss4 mber ?
a robber came into the tent; I was awake and called to my mate and asked for a pistol; the robber
ran out; I pursued, as also did my mate; he attempted to escape, but I saw him captured by a
Mr. Bell; he confessed his fault, pleaded his necessities, asking pardon, and to let him go; he
was a well-known bad character. We took him towards the camp. When passing some tents, he
called out, and some of his mates came up. We expected they would rescue him, and I ran to the
camp to get the police. One of the police came down with me, and immediately recognised the
prisoner, and said he knew the whole gang to which he belonged, and would apprehend them next
morning. His mates all ran away when they saw the policeman coming. My mate went up with
the policeman and prisoner to the camp, where he saw him handcuffed and secured. We were to
appear the following morning against him. Instead of our going to the camp, the policeman
came down to our tent about seven in the morning, and told us that the prisoner had made his
escape about half an hour ago. He asked us to keep it quiet, and he would see that he should not
trouble us any more. Jones saw the prisoner searched the night before, and about �2 6s. 6d.
was taken, and I believe two half-crowns, which the policeman threw on the bed. He entered a
note of the �2 65., but not of the ss. The camp lam alluding to in this complaint is Mr.
Webster?s, at Madman?s Flat. I went up in the morning to the camp, and saw a trooper shaving.
I asked him about the prisoner. He said he had escaped. I then saw Mr. Webster, who -said,
? Well, I will see about it, and report it at head quarters.? The policeman who had the prisoner
in charge was out; his name is Nugent. I believe he is the sergeant. I have never heard more
of either prisoner or the policeman. We are all of opinion that it is better to have an upright,
conscientious officer appointed by the Government to settle our claims, than to have it left to any
jury of diggers.
No. 31.? Joseph Wright examined.
I was going home to dinner about a month ago. About seventy yards away I saw Joseph weight
a policeman going up to the tent. I had a dog chained against the tent, I saw him strike Bth mber
the dog with a constable?s staff. I went up and asked him why he struck my dog He said the
dog?s chain was too long. I said I would report it to the Commissioner. He said I might do so.
The chain that the dog was tied with is a regular dog?s chain, about five or six feet long. I next
day went to Mr. Johnstone and told him of it. He said that the policeman was right if the dog
was going to bite him. I can?t say whether he struck the dog more than once. I never saw any
incivility in the police before.
No. 32.?Edward Williamson examined.

lam a storekeeper and digger. I took out a storekeeper?s license last January for three e. wmiamson,
months. At the end of the time I took out a six months? license. After getting it I tore up the Bth ]S iB54
first license; and when I looked at the six months? license, some time afterwards, I found that it
expired in August, instead of September. I went to the clerk and complained of the mistake,
but was told he could not remedy it. On the Monday after Sir Charles Hotham left these
diggings my store was cut into, two valuable dogs poisoned, and a trunk, containing wearing
apparel belonging to my daughter, and a cheque book, with my name in several parts of it, stolen.
I went to the camp and informed Mr. Taylor, a sub-inspector of the police, of the robbery, telling
him that my wife could give him a good deal of information about the marks on the clothes. He
said he would be over at ten o?clock; but neither he nor any of the police ever came. I kept the
bodies of the dogs two days, expecting the police, and shewed them to the sappers surveying about
the place. They promised to report it; but I never heard that they did report it. At the last
Government land sale, out by Mr. Waldie?s, a lot of land was fairly knocked down to me at
�6 10s. per acre. I went to pay the deposit, when Mr. Webster disputed it. Several voices cried
out that the land was fairly knocked down. Mr. Dewes desired me to go back. The lot was put
up again; Mr. Webster bid �8 55.; I bid �8 10s. per acre, and it was knocked down to me at
that price. I was at the riot at the Eureka Hotel. Speaking for myself, and I believe many
other respectable people hold a similar opinion, I would, had the authorities called upon us to
disperse, and read the Riot Act, have gone away in obedience to the law. I have been three
years on these diggings. Of my own knowledge I have not known any instance of corruption on
the part of any officers of the camp

lam a gold digger at present. In July last my mate, Robert Monteith, and myself were Frederick Vern,
working in a hole 132 feet deep, in Dalton?s Flat, when a license-hunting party, headed by Mr. ism.
Johnstone, came to the spot. I had a license, but my mate had not his license with him; it had
been left in his tent, a mile and a half off. He could not go for it, and I lent him �5 to deposit
as bail in the hands of Mr. Johnstone. The next morning we went to the Police Court at half-past
nine, and remained till twelve o?clock. Our case was not called on. We asked the clerk, who
told us no license cases had been called on that day at all. We saw Mr. Johnstone outside the
Court. We asked him how it was. He replied that he had nothing to do with us, that we were

past nine o?clock. He walked away, and said he had nothing more to say to us, but that the bail
1854 - was forfeited. In the beginning of August last a party of Americans were working in a hole above
us in Canadian Gully. One day in the afternoon they ceased working for want of slabs; they had
been working in the forenoon. The next morning their hole was taken possession of by another
party shortly after six o?clock. The Americans and Mr. Webster came to settle the
dispute The Americans offered to produce a number of witnesses to prove that they had been
working the hole the previous forenoon. Mr. Webster refused to call on the witnesses. He said
that according to their own statement their hole had been neglected the previous afternoon, and
he gave the hole to the party that had taken possession of it. The injustice of this decision was
the talk of the whole gully, and caused great excitement. There were eight persons in the party
that got the hole. I heard one of them state that Mr. Webster was to have a ninth of the profits
of the hole for his decision. I can swear I heard this. I saw Mr. Webster almost every afternoon
about four weeks after this decision, riding from the camp to his station, go to the place where
this party was washing the stuff from the hole, and examine the amount of gold in the tin
panican, and I heard him conversing with them. A man named Littlejohn was one of the party;
he was a sailor on board the Aurora Bor?ealis about two years and a half ago. I was chief mate
of this ship. In the beginning of September this man told me, in confidence, that Mr. Webster
was to have a ninth share in the profits of the hole. We had been talking of the amount we
expected out of our respective holes. He said their shares would not yield so well, because there
were nine in the party. I knew the party consisted of only eight persons, and on my enquiring
he told me Mr. Webster was to be the ninth ; he afterwards seemed to have told a great secret,
and was sorry for doing so. There is a law, that if a party are not working a hole, nor present
at it from two till four o?clock in the afternoon, the hole may be jumped. The Americans were not
working the hole in the hours alluded to, but they were present. In my opinion the cause of the
late disturbance was the long pent-up indignation felt by the diggers, caused by the repeated acts
of injustice they suffered at the hands of the authorities for the last twelve months. The burning
of the Eureka was the mere explosion of this indignation, and any other circumstance of excite-
ment, equally strong, would have caused it as well. I was at the meeting previous to the
burning of the Eureka. There was no intention on the part of the people at the meeting to burn
the hotel. The people were attracted to the hotel by the police being there. lam fully prepared
to state that if the Riot Act had been read, and force been used to suppress the riot, there were
more than one thousand revolvers on the ground, and the public force of police and military would
have been decimated in half an hour. The people were determined to execute vengeance on
Mr. Bentley, as a demonstration against Mr. Bentley and the officials of the camp, because they
thought the officials favored Mr Bentley. Many of the diggers were inclined to proceed to burn
the camp; but the more influential amongst them represented that there was much private pro-
perty in the camp, and dissuaded the more violent from doing so. On last Saturday fortnight,
when a deputation of the diggers proceeded to the camp to obtain the release of the prisoners taken
up for the riot, Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Mclntyre, the more influential had the greatest difficulty in
restraining the rest of the people from rushing up and storming the camp. If a large force were
sent up by the Government to enforce law and order, there is not a single individual on the
Ballaarat gold fields who would assist them under the present administration of the law. We are
not opposed to the law, but to the present administration of it by the authorities at the Ballaarat
camp, which is a perfect Augean stable, smelling most offensively. If this administration is con-
tinued, the people would prefer riot and disorder to the present administration of law and order.
If the law was administered with justice the diggers would support it; but not as it is. There
are many hot-headed men who would prefer to use the bowie knife and the pistol to the slower
process of petition ; but the greater number prefer to petition first before having recourse to phy-
sical force. The complaints handed in by Mr. Humphreys are the most prominent of those that
were handed in by the diggers; but there are many others who would complain had they
confidence that the present Board are entirely unconnected with the authorities at the Ballaarat
camp. They regard this Board as the nomination of Mr. Foster, who, with the Chief Commissioner
of the Gold Fields, the Surveyor General, and the Attorney General, they look on as the greatest
enemies of the gold diggers; they, the officers above named, having called the diggers a parcel of
wandering vagabonds. I believe the Governor has taken a very wise step in appointing this
Board; and we consider the people who take the above view of the matter to be misguided men ;
but I cannot blame them ?that is, I am not astonished that they have lost all confidence in the
Government. After this Board has been appointed Ido not think that those who do not bring
their complaints before it deserve any more consideration. The ?Diggers? Reform League,? of
which I am a member, is formed for the purpose of corresponding with the other diggings, and
adopting every constitutional means for securing to the diggers their social and political rights.

e. h. Levison, lam a surgeon, living on Golden Point I have heard from the persons who are conduct-
-1 iBs4 m ei ? ing the following four public houses, viz., the Victoria, Freemasons?, Albion, and Free Trade,
that all these houses belong to Mr. Krohan. The Freemasons? is not conducted by the person
whose name is over the door : neither is the Albion. I have seen Mr. Krohan and Mr. Dewes
frequently together, and thought it looked suspicious, but I have no other grounds to believe that
any influence was used by Mr. Krohan for obtaining licenses. lam aware that Mr. Bush and
Mr. Wiesenhavern had frequent interviews. Mr. Bush told the other that the regulations would


allow him to build a public house, and went out with him and pointed out a site for the house
that he might apply for. Mr. W. went up to the camp and saw Mr. Dewes, who told him he Bth November,
might commence to build. Mr. Wiesenhayern and his brother, who are both intimate with me, ,
have since told me that after the house was completed, and the expenses which had been incurred
were paid, Mr. Bush was to have a third of the profits as a consideration for getting the license.
Mr. Bush never advanced any money to complete the building. The share of the latter was for
inducing Mr. Dewes to grant the license. Mr. Dewes came down at least once whilst the house
was building, and stopped them; but Mr. Bush went immediately to the camp, and then Mr. Dewes
returned and told them to build away.

answered, ? Not very well.? He said, ? There are new regulations, and you can get a public house.?
My mate then went to the camp, and got permission to build one if he liked, and we began to build.
I swear that the Commissioner never spoke a word about a share for him. I swear that no Com-
missioner, neither Mr. Johnstone nor any one else in the Government camp, were to have a share,
or proposed such a thing, and that no written agreement to that effect ever existed. The state-
ment said by Mr. Humphreys to be made by Mr. Yern, that there was a written agreement
between me and Mr. Johnstone, that he was to have a share in my house if I got a license, is a lie.
Nobody has or is to have a share in our house but ourselves, and Mr. Johnstone has no profit
directly or indirectly in our business.

About six weeks ago Mr. Commissioner Johnstone came to my tent and asked to see licenses, e-

No. 37. ? John Sutherland examined.
I put in my application for a license for a public house on land of my own in Dowling
Forest. I never wrote any letter. I was present at a meeting with Mr. Bush and Mr. Fraser. i 854.
Mr. Bush proposed that we should take land of Mr Dewes, near Lake Learmonth, and build a
public house. Mr. Bush had then or was about to give up his commission. I never had any
interview with Mr. Dewes. I believe Mr. Fraser took a letter from Mr. Bush to Mr. Dewes to
treat for the land. The offer was, that if Mr Dewes would let us have the land he was to have a
third or fourth share in the profits of the house. We had not money to buy the land. I never
heard anything in reply or further on the subject. Fraser went to town. I never had any
interview with Mr. Dewes. The party were to put in an application for two licenses?one for
the house in Dowling Forest and one on Mr. Dewes?s land, near Lake Learmonth. There was,
however, only one application put in, for the one I have mentioned in Dowling Forest. The
agreement proposed by Fraser was, that he should offer Mr. Dewes a share in the house to be
erected on Mr. Dewes?s land, if he would allow them to have the land. I do not myself know
what reply was made. Fraser told me he had handed the proposition to Mr. Dewes, and that Mr.
Dewes had agreed to our having the land on the terms proposed, viz., Mr. Dewes having a one-
fourth share in the profits. Mr. Bush left for town, and nothing was done in the matter. .
THURSDAY, 9th NOVEMBER, 1854.
No. 88.? John Green examined.
lam Gold Receiver at Ballaarat. I was in the court during the examination of Bentley.
John Green,
From what I heard of the evidence, I formed a very decided opinion of the case. I was greatly 9th mber ?
surprised that the decision of the Court was otherwise than to commit. I remarked, on the part
of the police magistrate, much interruption in the examination of witnesses by the prosecuting
counsel, who threatened to throw up the case if repeated. I was at the meeting on the 17th
of October. I went from the meeting to Bentley?s. I arrived at the same time the mob did
I went to the ground as a magistrate, being instructed to do so by Mr. Rede. I was there when
the riot commenced. Mr. Rede arrived shortly before the burning of the hotel. I con-
sidered my duty as a magistrate ceased when he arrived. I placed myself in his immediate
neighbourhood, so as to be under his orders. Before Mr. Rede arrived the mob had broken the
windows, and had demolished the side of the house to a considerable When they were
destroying the sides of the house, the Inspector of Police asked me whether it was necessary to
call in the assistance of the military. I advised him by all means to do so. I did not order
any person to be arrested, or order the police to stop the riot. I repeatedly told the Inspector
of Police that it was a pity to see the building destroyed, but that the force he had with him
was too small to interfere. Without this impression I would certainly have read the Riot Act,
and interfered actively to stop the riot. I heard several persons alluding to the Riot Act, but


3 aMm'Zl? bave no distinct recollection of any person asking me to read it. I was at one time advancing
9th November, to read the Act; this was before the military arrived. I was stopped by the conviction
on my own mind that the force at our disposal was too small to enforce the measures necessarv
to be pursued afterwards. I think when the military had arrived the multitude had increased
to such an extent that it would have been a doubtful experiment to read the Riot Act. When
the military were sent for the numbers were not so great. I considered the display of force on
the ground that day useless. I was influenced in my judgment by the consideration of the unpro-
tected state in which the camp was left in case of a collision, when the force was at a distance
from the camp. It is my clear opinion that the authorities would not have been justified in
coming to a collision with the people on that day. I have never seen or heard anything that
would lead me to believe that corrupt motives could be attributed to any of the officials on the
Ballaarat camp. I consider the primary cause of the outbreak to have arisen from the
discharge of Bentley. It appeared to me that the destruction of the house was an impulse of
the moment. Ido not think the intention of the crowd was to overawe the authorities by the
display of physical force. A few missiles were thrown at the authorities. J

In about an hour they came, took me into custody, and took me to the camp. That afternoon I was
taken before the Bench. Sergeant Milne swore I was an idle and disorderly person, without visible
means of support. That I had been a bad character all the time I had been on the diggings *
that I came iip to the camp as a stall, pretending that I had lost some gold, but that I had been
connected with robbery at the time. I brought two evidences up, who disproved what the sergeant
said, yet I was fined five pounds. I was asked for my license in court, but I had not one. Ido
not know whether I was fined for this or not. The police were sent for on that day in conse-
quence of one of my mates striking one of the party we jumped.
No. 40.? Edmund Jones examined.
I November, 5 , Ab � ut four or five months ago I was lodging in a boarding house called ? The Old Spot ?
1854. near the theatre. About midnight I was aroused by two troopers coming into the tent and
demanding supper. They were supplied with it. They then asked for some grog, which' they
were also supplied with. One of the troopers, who has since left the service, said, ? The diggers
might joe the foot police, but the first trooper they joed they would be cut down.? At this speech
several persons who were inmates of the lodging house were enraged, and but for me would have
assaulted them. I stopped them, and told the police they were public servants, and that the first
person who cut down a digger for joeing the police should suffer; that I myself would not rest till
the camp was burned over their heads, and they punished. The policemen then left. The next
morning a sergeant called down, enquired into the circumstances, and said the man would be
dismissed. We did not wish the matter stirred up. The man has since been dismissed, but for
what cause Ido not know. I have been pressed to make this complaint by the committee of the
Diggers? League. Last year I joined in an agitation got up for political rights, which involved me
in debt. Since then I have refrained from political agitation.

No. 44.?Gordon Evans examined.
1 am 1 Ins P ector of Police at Ballaarat. I went with the disposable force of police under Gordon Evans,
y command to a meeting held on the 17th of October, by order of Mr. Bede. I did not 9th Js^l! mber �
anticipate any disturbance. Had I anticipated any serious disturbance I would have sent the
men armed with their firelocks. I asked Mr. Green twice to read the Biot Act; and lam con-
vinced it fie had done so on the first occasion, the mob would have been dispersed, and the building
saved tor the time; but I believe the mob were so determined on having Bentley, that directly the
police turned their backs the mob would have re-assembled to destroy the building. Their cry
was to give them Bentley or Dewes, and they would be satisfied. The second time I begged Mr.
Green to read the Biot Act, I think the people had become so excited with liquor that it would
ave been impossible to have saved the building. The building was then on fire, but I think we
could still have dispersed the mob, though with loss of life. I think if the Biot Act had been read,
and the mob dispersed by force, with the loss of life, the effect would have been very bad. The
ciggers conceived an injustice had been done; and had a riot caused by this injustice been quelled
by torce, the effect would have been to exasperate the whole mining community. The cause was
a bad one; and I think if the riot had arisen from any other cause, it might have been quelled
without resorting to force. Mr. Green was told by Mr. Bede, in my hearing, to read the Biot
Act it necessary. I understood I was to place myself at his disposal. At every station there is
always a nightly patrol independent of the men who are employed on detective duty.

No. 47.?Charles Wiesenhayern examined on Oath.
I have been on the diggings seven months; six months a storekeeper. lam building an c. Wiesenhavem,
hotel. A license for this hotel was promised me by Mr. Dewes about three months ago, if the 9th November,?
hotel was built in the spot it now is. About this time I was sitting in mj tent at the Eureka,
when Mr. Bush, then a commissioner, came in. He asked me how my business was getting on.
I said, u Not well.? He then advised me to build an hotel, with the probability of getting a
license. I went to Mr. Dewes several times in order to obtain a license, but was refused. Some
time after this, Mr. Bush called again, and asked about the license. I told him I had been
refused. He laughed, and said it was necessary to try again very hard. I went back to Mr.
Dewes, who told me there was one isolated spot in which if I built an hotel I should have a license.
I consulted my brother, and we agreed to build a house on the spot named by Mr. Dewes. When
the house was half built, I went to Mr. Dewes again, and gave in my application for the license.
He said I should have it when it was finished. I asked Mr. Bush, when he gave up his situation
as commissioner, if he intended leaving the Colony. He said he did. I told him if he returned,
and wished to enter into business as a publican, I would give him a share in our hotel. Mr. Bush
made an agreement with me that if he returned to the Colony he was to have the first
preference in a partnership of the hotel, after all the expenses were paid. Mr. Bush paid
me five pounds as an earnest of the bargain. My brother has a copy of the agreement.
Mr. Bush was to give nothing for the partnership. I swear this share in the hotel was not
to be given to Mr. Bush in consideration of his either directly or indirectly getting the
license. From the trouble I had in getting the license, I am sure Mr. Bush had nothing
to do in the matter; and Mr. Bush was not aware, at the time I was promised the license by
Mr. Dewes, that he was to have a share in the hotel. This was a subsequent free offer of
mine to him, because he was my friend, and for no other consideration. Mr. Brandt has lent us
some money, for which he was to live free at the hotel until the money was paid. He is not a
partner in the hotel. lam sure that no agreement exists between Mr. Brandt and Mr. Johnstone
to give Mr. Johnstone a tenth part of the profits of the Prince Albert Hotel. I know Mr. Brandt
well; and if this agreement had existed I must have known it. I know Doctor Levison. He

No. 48. ? William Hurst examined on Oath.
NCemb'er? lam a digger, residing at Dalton?s Elat. I had a conversation yesterday with Frederick
1854. ? y ern ne ar his tent. He was at the time boasting of the evidence he had given before the Board
of Enquiry, and the number of sheets he had filled with his opinions. He stated that he had
brought a charge of bribery against Mr. Webster, and embezzlement of public money against Mr.
Johnstone. On my telling him I thought he could not bring sufficient evidence to prove these
charges against the commissioners, and that it was foolish bringing them : this brought on a
conversation regarding Mr. Smith, who had some time previously decided a claim against me. I
mentioned that this case of mine would look as suspicious as the others he had mentioned, but
that no proof could be adduced to shew that there was bribery or anything of the sort. I observed
it was quite common when parties had a dispute decided against them, that they should suspect
the commissioner of bribery or of acting partially. This is all the cause Frederick Yern has
to say that I ever stated that Mr. Smith ever took a bribe for settling a claim against me. I have
not the least cause to suspect Mr. Smith of injustice or partiality. He took the evidence on both
sides with great patience, and I believe his decision was just and impartial. I was at the burning
of the Eureka Hotel. Ido not think it would have been prudent for the magistrates and police
on that occasion to have read the Biot Act, and quelled the riot by force. Ido not think any
exercise of force on the part of the military would have quelled the riot. So far as I have seen,
which is very trifling, the officials of the camp are entitled,, from their general conduct, to the
respect and confidence of the diggers.
FBIDAY, 10th NOYEMBEB, 1854.
No. 49.? John Webster examined.
ioth November About eight months ago I applied to Mr. Webster to settle a disputed claim. He refused
1854. ?to examine my witnesses, and decided the claim against me in what I believe to be a partial
manner. The opposite party was Yorkey?s, the man who was taken up for burning the Eureka
Hotel. The commissioner seemed acquainted with him, which appeared suspicious.
No. 50.?Mr. Seekamp, Editor of the Ballaarat Times , examined.
iuth November Licenses have been issued to storekeepers, and to any one requiring them, within a quarter
1854. of a mile of the boundary of the township of Ballaarat, after the Governor, through the Colonial
Secretary, had assured us, the residents in the township, that no more licenses should be issued.
We, the residents of the township, complain that Mr. Bede acts in opposition to the orders of the
Governor, as issued through the Colonial Secretary, thereby injuring the interests of those who
have purchased Crown lands in this township. About two months ago a number of storekeepers
began to erect stores, and to mark out ground for the purpose, at a distance from the road. Whilst
they were doing this Mr. Bede ordered them to go back further from the road, which they did,
making a street frontage of their tents. Other parties came afterwards, and were permitted by
Mr. Bede to erect stores in a line nearer the road, but not exactly in front of them; in fact,
occupying the place that they had been previously ordered by Mr. Bede to vacate. The pur-
chasers of land in the township bought their land on the understanding that the road from
Bakery Hill was to come in a different direction to what it now does. This deviation was caused
by the house of the District Surgeon being built on the proposed line of road, thereby depreciating
the value of the property of those whose premises were nearer the original line of road. When
the land was sold Lydiard-street was marked on the plan as one and a half chains wide, but the
street now is only a chain wide, the buildings on the camp encroaching on the other half chain.
I complain of Mr. Johnstone sitting on the bench as a magistrate, then going down and prosecuting
and giving evidence, and getting upon the bench again at the same sittings. I have received a
number of statements, some with signatures and some without, from time to time, accusing
individuals on the camp, within the last three months, from policemen to commissioners, of being
influenced in their public duties by bribes and private interest. I have no personal knowledge of
the truth of these matters, but I have heard reports brought to myself, also communications to
the same effect, which, not directly interesting me, I have not made public; and as Ido not preserve
any correspondence after having been published or refused, I have no direct proofs of what I now
state, but distinctly assert that I have received such communications, and firmly believe that
bribery, corruption, and private influence have been employed towards the authorities on the
camp, and successfully.
No. 51.? John Manning examined.
John Manning, About last Tuesday, William Thomas, occupying a piece of ground on the roadside, and
i� th November, paying a license, placarded his place for sale. A storekeeper, wanting a site for his store, applied
to William Thomas to know what he would take for his place. Thomas replied, ? Thirty-five


pounds.? The storekeeper thinking the figure too high, came to Commissioner Johnstone and told ,Tr,hn ?^"^ n ??
him of the circumstance of the place being for sale. Commissioner Johnstone, in Company with 10t,h November
the storekeeper, proceeded to the place, and asked Thomas, ? Did he want to sell Government 1854 ?
ground ?? Thomas replied, ? No, Ido not, but I wish to sell the tent.? On which Commis-
sioner Johnstone pegged out his occupancy, and gave it to the storekeeper, saying to Thomas, that
he would give him forty-eight hours to shift. Next day Commissioner Johnstone went down to see
see whether he was shifting, and found he was not, and Thomas said, as he could not dispose of the
tent, he would live in it himself. Commissioner Johnstone said, ? You are now too late, as I
have given my decision.? The man refused to leave; upon which Mr. Johnstone
summoned him before the Bench. Mr. Evans and Mr. Green were sitting. The defendant
said the reason why he did not leave was, because he held a license, and was in possession of
the ground for three weeks before. The Bench, On hearing the evidence in full, not only con-
firmed Mr. Johnstone?s decision in the case, but fined Thomas in the sum of five pounds for
refusing to comply with said decision.
No. *sl.? John Manning examined on Oath.
lam reporter of the Ballaarat Times. I reported the case heard before Messrs. John Manning,
Johnstone and Green, published in the Ballaarat Times of the 4th of November. That report 10th^ mber-
is substantially correct. That involves all the complaints I have against Mr. Johnstone.
Another complaint, that Mr. Johnstone ordered a man that was brought before him for having
no license, the apprehending constable was not there to prosecute, and Mr. Johnstone ordered
the man to be sent to the lock-up and detained. The case is mentioned in the same paper as
the above.
No. 52.? Walter Pearson examined on Oath.
lam managing business for Mr. Allen, wine and spirit merchant, at Buninyong. I know waiter Pearson,
Mr. Tait, of the Turf Inn, on the road to Creswick?s Creek. I have called in there occasionally 10th^^ mber >
previous to his obtaining a license. I have asked him if he thought he was sure of getting his
license. He said he saw no reason why he should not get it. He asked me to request Mr.
Allen to vouch for his respectability to the Bench of Magistrates. I said I would do so. I w3s
going frequently to Creswick?s Creek, and I often called there on my way. I swear I never
offered to Mr. Tait that, if he would give me an order, I would ensure Mr. Bewes visiting his
house ; but I told him that, in gratitude to Mr. Allen for vouching for his respectability, I
thought he ought to give me an order, as I could supply him as cheap as other people. I never
promised Mr. Allen should give, and I am sure Mr. Allen never gave, any consideration what-
soever to induce Mr. Bewes to license Mr. Tait?s house. Mr. Tait gave me a small order. He
fetched the goods from Buninyong himself. I did not understand that this order was given in
order that Mr. Allen might use his influence to get Mr. Bewes to visit the house. lam certain
it was not. I have never known Mr. Allen use any influence with Mr. Bewes about licensing
public houses, beyond vouching for the respectability of parties he knew. About the first time
I asked him for an order, Mr. Tait said he could not afford to pay ready money, and asked if I
would be content to wait some time for the money, if I supplied him, I told him, if he would
put the title deeds of his house in the hands of Mr. Allen he would take his bills. I could not
in any way insure him his license, otherwise than by saying Mr. Allen would vouch for his
respectability. I never led him to think I could.

pounds, and was to give him a hundred pounds for my license. When I lent him the money
there was no allusion to, or comment made about the license for my house. I look upon it as a
bona fide business transaction, and expect to get the money from Mr Bewes when it is due, or I
will sue him for it. I have never, either directly or indirectly, given any bribe or consideration
to Mr. Bewes to induce him to grant my license. I fitted up two tents on the Government camp
on Mr. Bewes?s order, for which I have not been paid. As Mr. Bewes is going away, I may ]ose
this. He promised to bring me the requisition for the work from Capt. Mac Mahon, but Re did
not do so. This may be what Mrs. Bath alluded to. When Mr. Bewes borrowed the money of
me, he said, ? One good turn deserves another.? The one good turn was lending the money,
and I understand the license was to be another, though there was no direct allusion made to the
license.
No. 54.? Arthur Pursell Akehurst examined.
I am clerk of Ballaarat Bench. About a month or five weeks ago I understood the a. p. Akewt,
Bench of Magistrates to come to an understanding, about the 18th of October, that in future 10th *^ mber �
licensing days would be held on the first Tuesday of each month. Previous to this date the
applications for licenses were heard as applied for by two or more magistrates. It was considered
desirable by the magistrates that a day should be fixed for entertaining applications, in order that


A ?wn4S, rst ? ma gis trat e might attend who wished to do so. This regulation has been adhered to. The Court
ioih November, is now opened at ten o?clock, it having been represented that nine o?clock was too early for diggers
and witnesses to attend. The Court is kept open until four o?clock, when it adjourns. This
course has been deemed inconvenient by many, as cases may be heard and disposed of after the
original charge-sheet has been gone through, without the reporters or public being aware of it.
No. 55,? William Jackson examined.
About four months ago, one of my mates in a party of four sold me his share for ten
1854. pounds. I paid him nine pounds then, and was to pay him the remaining pound the same night.
I did not pay him that night. In the afternoon of the next day I offered him the pound ? he
refused, and tendered the nine pounds (which I declined), demanding to return to the party. I
complained to Mr. Webster, when he investigated the complaint. My mates all turned
against me, upon which I offered to buy out their shares for thirty pounds each, or to sell my
share for thirty pounds. They refused both offers, and Mr. Webster compelled me to sell my
share for fifteen pounds. The shares were worth thirty. I believe Mr. Webster was not sober.
[Mr. Webster states, in answer to this charge, that he was requested to arbitrate between
these disputants; that he did so, and Jackson was at first satisfied with the result of
the arbitration, but subsequently was not satisfied. Jackson?s own statement shews?
first, he was trying to induce his mate to sell a share worth �3O for �lO 5 second,
he did not complete the bargain ; and third, all his mates were against him.]
No. 56.? Robert Milne examined.
Robert Miine. lam Sergeant Major of Police at Ballaarat. Mr. Taylor spoke to me upon the subject of
111 i854, m robbery reported by Mr. Williamson. I sent two policemen in plain clothes?constables Young
and Harrison?to enquire into the affair. They reported to me that they had been there and kept
watch until five o?clock in the morning, but saw nothing suspicious.
No. 57. Mr. John Green, Gold Receiver, examined.
10th November,
I was sitting on the Bench on Thursday last, with Mr. Johnstone, when a charge of assault
was ioug t by a man named Bowden against Michael Griffin. The offence was quite clearly
prove . I entirely concurred with Mr. Johnstone in his decision. I have read the report of the
case mt ie hallaarat limes of the 4th November. That report is grossly incorrect: there was
no the slightest difference in Mr. Johnstone?s manner when giving the decision. The complaint
was patiently and thoroughly investigated. It was a brutal assault, the man Bowden having been
Jacked in the face whilst standing up to his neck in a hole.
No. 58.?Mr. Dewes, P.M., examined.
. statem ent by Dr. Stewart is substantially correct, in so far that Mr. Marshall,
1854. wom formerly knew in London, and with whom I have been acquainted some time in this
Loony, gave me his acceptance of two bills, one for one hundred and fifty, and the other
ior one hunared and seventy pounds. These bills were for the purchase of some land. I gave
them to Mr. Burchell to get discounted for me. Mr. Marshall holds these bills, with an under-
standing from me that they would be taken up upon the land being sold. I paid Mr. Burchell
ten pounds for getting the bills discounted. Ido not know who discounted them. I sold some
land to Mr, Phillips for two hundred and eighty pounds. Mr. Burchell offered to give me the
money for an order on Mr. Phillips. I gave him the order, and received the money, Mr. Bur-
chell getting five pounds for his trouble. Mr. Phillips honored the order. Mr. Burchell
was a monied man, proposing and professing to do business of this kind. I never had any
other transaction of any sort or character with him. It was generally believed that the purchase
ot land at this time was a good speculation, and it was this that induced me to raise the money

room on that occasion: I was asked if the prisoner might be allowed some refreshment;
I said ? Yes,? and proceeded to lunch in my own tent. When I returned, I saw a bottle
on the table, and I was told it had been sent to the counsel for the prisoner. Whether
the prisoner?s counsel saw Bentley in my room during my absence I cannot say. I distinctly state
that I never saw or spoke to Mr. Bentley on the occasion. Ido not remember the circumstance
of Mr. Linquist having been brought before me on a charge of having a horse in his possession
knowing it to have been stolen, but I have stated in open court that I would recommend the
Colonial Secretary to suspend his license. I spoke to Mr. Wrixon, the Chairman of Quarter
Sessions, on the subject, who told me there was no power to take his license from him. I never
heard any official complaint that Bentley?s house was a disreputable one. I considered him to be a
respectable man, the recommendation for his license, which I now produce, being signed by two
Members of the Legislative Council, the Manager of the Bank of New South Wales, and two other
respectable persons. The circumstance of my having to borrow money to purchase land is
corroborative proof that I was not deriving any profit from Bentley?s house. I am desirous that
Bentley?s banking account and mine be both examined, for which purpose I am desirous of placing
my banking account before the Board. The banking accounts shall be placed at the disposal of the
Board at any time they may be required. I produce them now for your inspection, if necessary.

APPENDIX B.
To ihe Board of Enquiry now sitting at Bath?s Hotel to investigate the causes of the present
unsettled state of the Gold Fields.
Ballaarat, 10th November, 1854.
Gentlemen,
With regard to the cause or causes, whether remote or immediate, of the late demon-
stration of public indignation, which resulted in the burning down of Bentley?s Hotel, and keeps
up the present agitation, we submit that the remote cause of that demonstration was in conse-
quence of a general belief that there had been not only a daily maladministration of the law,
but the most flagrant acts of cruelty and injustice practised upon the people of Ballaarat, and
that the camp was a kind of legal store where justice was bought and sold, bribery being the
governing element of success, and perjury the base instrument of baser minds to victimize
honest and honorable men, and thus defeating the ends of justice.
We forbear going into detail, but would rather deal with general facts, referring in part
for confirmation to the report of the Board of Enquiry, and appealing to the inhabitants ot
Ballaarat for the rest.
We, however, will cite one or two recent cases which we consider amongst the main causes
of the excitement and agitation which has, does, and will prevail, unless some extensive changes
are made in the management of the gold fields and government of this Colony.
First.?We would mention that the diggers? license fee, and more especially the mode of
collecting it, has been a source of great annoyance, and has tended much to irritate
the minds of the digging community against the camp officials.
The license fee is objected to because it is partial and unjust, inasmuch as it
confounds the lucky digger with the unlucky one, and taxes both alike. A more
equitable tax, if really needed, should be substituted.
That its mode of collection is not only frequently cruel, but degrading to the
digger. Honest men are hunted by the police like kangaroos, and if they do not


possess a license (too often from the want of the means of paying for one, as
poverty is the lot of many a digger), they are paraded through the diggings by the
commissioners and police, and then marched up to the camp, and if unable to pay
the fine, are rudely locked up, in company with any thief or thieves who may be in the
camp cells at the time?in short, treated in every way as if they were felons. This
has been the prolific source of much disaffection, and has created much bitter feeling
Second. The case of Mr. Frank Carey, who was sentenced to six months? imprisonment
on a charge of sly grog selling, upon very questionable evidence, by two police officers,
employed, as alleged, by Sergeant Major Milne for purposes of private revenge.
Milne himself stated, on most unwarrantable grounds, that Carey kept a most disre-
putable house and the resort of gamblers j thereby libelling a great number of most
respectable Americans j and this caused much excitement, and the just indignation
of the American population of Ballaarat.
Third.-?The next case that has tended to feed the flame of indignation was the cruelty and
injustice practised by the trooper Lord and Mr. Commissioner Johnstone upon Gregory,
the servant of the Rev. Smith. This case has produced much excitement, amongst
the whole Roman Catholic body, which numbers many thousands at Ballaarat.
Fourth. The murder of Scobie called forth the active sympathy of the Scotch, and the
manner in which the investigation was conducted excited the just indignation of men
of every nation that resided on Ballaarat, as life and the impartial administration of
the law are dear to all men. And here we would appeal, through the Board, to the
good sense and justice of the Lieutenant Governor as to whether the conduct of the
magistrates in this matter, more especially that of Messrs. Dewes and Rede, does
not merit the severest censure, and prove them to be totally unfit for the important
office of magistrates, involving as it does the lives, properties, and liberties of the
people. As the merest tyro in criminal jurisprudence must have seen that there
was ample evidence relative to the murder of poor Scobie to have not only justified
the magistrates in committing the parties charged for trial, but they were compelled,
in the full exercise of their oath of office, to have done so, and their not having done
so justified the charge of incompetency or corruption.
We are fully aware that we cannot justify the burning down of Bentley?s Hotel according
to dictum of law; but we submit, with all due deference to the Executive Council, that
there is a power and a right vested by God in the people that stand above all political law.
But even if it were not so, we contend that it is unjust for Government to concentrate its ven-
geance upon the heads of two or three men singled out from the mass ; as one thing is certain?
the destruction of Bentley?s Hotel was not confined to the few, but thousands of men and women
too were in the work of destruction. We do not forget that, according to the theory of
law, all are principals in a crime; but there are peculiar circumstances in this case that justify
a peculiar opinion, and therefore we respectfully suggest that His Excellency will instruct the
Attorney General not to prefer any bills of indictment against the few who have been committed
for trial. We think, rather, that if any are to be punished for the destruction of the hotel in
question, it should be those who, by their wilful perversion of the functions of their office,
provoked the people beyond the bounds of human endurance, and utterly destroyed all confidence
in the integrity and impartiality of the Ballaarat Bench.
addition to the causes already assigned for the great dissatisfaction which now prevails on
t e gold fields, and especially at Ballaarat, we must not omit to mention the strong conviction in the
minds of the diggers that they never will have justice until they are fully and fairly represented
m the Legislative Council, and there is a complete change in the management of the gold fields ;
and we would respectfully suggest, for the serious consideration of His Excellency, the justice of
at once giving full and fair representation to the people, immediately abolishing the license fee and
disbanding the Gold Commission, and throwing open the lands, as the natural and political rights
ot the people. On the satisfactory settlement of these all-important questions depend, in our
humble judgment, the peace and prosperity not only of Ballaarat, but of the Colony at large.
In conclusion, we would remark that, but for the menacing conduct of the police autho-
rities at the meeting held to petition the Lieutenant Governor for the re-investigation into the
cause of Scobie s death, we doubt much whether the hotel would have been burned down at that
time, notwithstanding the excited state of the public mind. For even after the demolition of the
windows, Mr. Commissioner Rede was told that, if he would only secure Bentley for the ends of
? t ? 1 y. -
cease. We would further remark that, owing to the
manner in which you, as a Board of Enquiry, have been appointed, we believe that much valuable
evidence will be withheld, as the people have no confidence in Boards which are not responsible
to themselves. r
We remain,
Gentlemen,
Your obedient servants,

APPENDIX C.
Letter from the Resident Commissioner respecting the riot at the Eureka.
Government Camp,
g iR Ballaarat, 10th November, 1854.
I havei the honor to lay before you a statement of facts relating to Bentley?s Hotel being
destroyed, as far as came under my own observation.
m j On Saturday, 14th October, bills were posted calling for a meeting to take place on the
k Tuesday following, on the spot where one Scobie had been found dead.
I was assured on all sides that this meeting would pass over with perfect order and quiet
but on the morning of the 17th (the day of the meeting), having been shewn a letter from
.Bentley to the police magistrate, in which he stated he had reason to suppose his house would be
attacked, I wrote to the officer commanding the detachment of the 40th in camp, to hold his men
ready, and to the Inspector of Police, to have all his disposable force in the neighbourhood of the
meeting. I also required Mr. Green to be present, as magistrate, and provided him with the Riot
Act. 1 took these precautions, not that I for a moment expected any outbreak of popular feeling
but merely as a precaution. L
I rode to within a hundred yards of the meeting with the Inspector of Police ? there were
some few hundreds only, and they very orderly. I then went to the Eureka station, which is
about five minutes? ride from the hotel. After I had been there about half an hour I received a
message from the Inspector of Police, requesting me to come to him as soon as possible, the people
having attacked the hotel. Accompanied by Mr. Commissioner Amos I was on the spot in less
than five minutes. The mob were then pulling out the weather boarding of the house ? the
windows in the front and sides were all broken in. I jumped off my horse and rushed into the
crowd. I mounted on the sill of a broken window, and tried to make myself heard. I was pelted
with stones, and those immediately under me prevented me being heard, but called on Mr. Amos
. who addressed them. I thought it would have effect, but some one on horseback drew their
attention from Mr. I then found they were at the back of the house, breaking and
destroying. I then called in the military, and ordered them to occupy the house ; this they did.
I then discovered that the bowling-alley was on fire; there was no hope of saving the premises,
from the light materials of which they were built, and a very strong wind blowing at the time. I
then ordered the police to save the property in the bouse, and the soldiers to guard what was
taken out.
I have made a similar statement to this in my reports.
I have the honor to be,
Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
ROBERT REDE,
Resident Commissioner.
To the President of the Commission of Investigation,
Bath?s Hotel, Ballaarat
APPENDIX D.
STATEMENT OF JOHN DEWES, ESQUIRE.
About twelve months ago the firm of Messrs Bentley and Mack ay, storekeepers, Ballaarat,
were accused before me, on the sworn information of two policemen, of sly grog selling, and con-
victed in the penalty of fifty pounds. Upon subsequent investigation it was discovered that both
these policemen, either by accident or design, had sworn falsely as to the persons and firm of
the accused. I represented the matter to the Government, obtained restitution of the penalty,
and the dismissal of the policemen in question, with a recommendation from myself to Mr. Forster,
the Inspector of Police, that they should be prosecuted for perjury.
Sometime the beginning of the present year a slanderous article appeared in the Geelong
Advertiser, reflecting on the character and actions of Capt. Evans, Inspector of Police here, and
myself, and quoting against me my having convicted the firm in question of sly grog selling, but
omitting the subsequent transactions. Hearing, I suppose, that 1 was about to bring an action
against the editor of the paper, Mr. Bentley came to me, and handed to me a written statement,
that he considered the justice done to him, as well as the restitution of his property, entirely
owing to myself, and bearing general testimony to the proper manner I had acted towards him on
the occasion.


Sometime in the month of June last I met Mr, Bentley in Melbourne, in Mr. Hodges?s
hotel (the Union), and he signified to me his desire to build an hotel at Ballaarat in accordance
with the regulations of the new Act extending that privilege to the gold fields; that he pcould
produce the highest recommendations, and intended to erect a first-rate hotel.
I told him I had no doubt, under these circumstances, that upon his presenting himself
before the Bench he would obtain his license.
The hotel (the Eureka) was decidedly the largest and most commodious on the Ballaarat
gold fields. The proprietor had all the appearance and manner of a highly respectable man. No
complaints in particular were ever made to me about the house; and during the few visits I paid
to it I saw no improper proceedings.
I swear that on no one occasion of my life did any money pass between Mr. Bentley and
myself; or that from the time of its building to the period of its destruction had I the slightest
benefit from or interest in it. In fact nothing would so easily prove this fact, and give the lie to
such infamous calumnies as have been spread, as Mr. Bentley?s and my own banking books.
I swear that when Mr. Bentley appeared before the Bench, on a charge of being accessory
to the death of James Scobie, I was actuated, together with Mr. Bede, in my view of the case,
solely from a sense of justice, and from no bias whatever of any kind. Ido not presume to say that
there might not be an error in judgment; but the view we took of the case has been confirmed by
the opinions of Mr. Dawson, barrister-at-law, and several other legal authorities.
I repudiate, with the utmost indignation, as far as I am concerned, the lying insinuations
of corruption, &c, conveyed by the press against the. officers of the camp; and hope that my
character and actions during a sixteen months? residence as police magistrate at this place will be
a sufficient testimony in my favor.
