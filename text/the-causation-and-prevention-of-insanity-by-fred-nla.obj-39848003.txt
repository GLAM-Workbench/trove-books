The Causation and Prevention of Insanity.
BY F. N ORTON MANNING, M.D., &c., &c
[ tit ad before the Medical Section of the Royal Society of iy.S.lf r .,
10 September, 1880. J
It is one of the glories of our profession that its members have
not only been foremost in recognising the importance—but have
been the chief workers in the field—of preventive medicine, that
they have discerned that prophylaxis has a higher aim than the-
rapeutics, and that “ there is a larger and loftier success in pre-
venting the diseases of communities than in curing the diseases of
individuals.” In mental, as in physical disease, there is more
scope for the physician in prevention than in cure, and it is in this
direction I would ask your attention this evening. The causation
and prevention of insanity is a subject of such importance that I
need not apologise for its introduction.
As a text for my observations, I place before you two tables
which have been prepared with some care, and concerning which
some explanatory remarks are necessary. The first of these shows
the assigned causes of insanity m 3,o77patients admitted into the
Hospital for the Insane at Gladesville, frofn’January Ist, 1869, to
December 31st, 1878, a period of ten years. This table has been
prepared from the case books of thAßaspital, and I have to thank
my friend Dr. Beattie for placing it in its present shape. The
causes assigned in the papers forwarded with the patients, often
conjectural, and sometimes absurd, have been supplemented by
inquiries from relatives and from the patients themselves, and
corrected by the light thrown on the cases by their subsequent
history and progress. The second table is more elaborate and
more important, not only as embracing larger numbers, but as
based on an improved-classification. It sets forth the assigned
causes of insanity in 13,309 patients admitted into English
asylums of all classes during the year 1878, and is the first
attempt in this direction on the part of the English Commissioners
in Lunacy, who acknowledge their indebtedness to the Medical
Superintendents of Institutions for the Insane throughout the
Kingdom. The percentages for both tables have been calculated
in my office.
It will be seen that in the Gladesville table there is no distinc-
tion between predisposing and exciting causes, whilst in the Eng-
lish table these are distinguished, and are both tabulated where
both are found to exist, with a result that the aggregate of the
total causes, including those unknown, exceeds the whole number
of patients by exactly 30 per cent. In comparing the percentages
4o 32—80


in the Gladesyille and English tables, it should therefore be
remembered that the latter are greater than the former by 30
per cent, or -j from this cause. With this in mind, and with
some corrections necessary, owing to the somewhat different
method of classification, it will be seen that though some causes
are more potent in this than in the mother country, in others
there is a singular agreement in the percentages. Taking the
main divisions moral and physical, it appears that in New South
Wales 16'9 per cent, of the insanity was due to moral, and 57'6
per cent, to physical causes; an addition of 30 per cent, to
each of these brings the figures very near the English percentages.
It is not my intention to analyse minutely these epitomes of
human misery, or to take up seriatim each of the causes of mental
disturbance here set forth ; still less is it my desire to dogmatise
on a subject so intricate. Deep set hereditary predisposition,
morbid susceptibilities to disease, and the marvellous ingrained
weakness of human nature, go with numerous depressing influences,
moral and physical, to make up that complex concurrence of con-
ditions which results in insanity. The causes lie too deep to be
gathered by mere surface investigation, and can seldom be packed
into a word or a sentence. A patient accumulation of an
extensive series of data is required for the proper elucidation
of this question. The tables I have placed before you are a
step in this direction, and such evidence as can be deduced from
them must be regarded as a small contribution towards a large
subject. I shall pass over at once the majority of the so-called
moral causes of insanity, because these come but little within
our province as physicians, because I believe that in the majority
of cases it is only when there is physical predisposition that these
causes become operative, and because it is certain that with
increasing knowledge the number classified under these headings
is diminishing. “ Domestic trouble” is no uncommon experience,
“ mental anxiety” falls to the lot of most men and women, and
“ adverse circumstances” to not a few. The strain falls on almost
all—the weak give way, and it is this weakness which, in reality,
constitutes the chief cause of the insanity.
The first causes to which I would direct your attention appear
in the Gladesville but not in the English table. They are isola-
tion and nostalgia, to which, conjointly, 3'9 of the cases are
attributed. I mention the two together because they have some-
thing in common. The cases of pure nostalgia have been few
and have occurred entirely among other than English-speaking
people, Swiss, Danes, Italians, and Chinese. All spoke English
most imperfectly, and were isolated in this respect, as well as in
being far from home and in a strange country. The cases due to
isolation included shepherds whose occupation some years ago was
of the most lonely character in all, and is still so in some


districts of the Colony. Happily, however, with the increase of
fencing, and with increasing population, this form of isolation,
which was formerly a fruitful cause of insanity, is rapidly decreas-
ing. Isolation in another form was first brought under my notice
by observing that a large proportion of the patients admitted had
no relatives or friends nearer than the old country. By a return,
which I have had prepared during the last few weeks, I find that
more than one half—l,o3B out of 2,036 —of the inmates of our
institutions for the insane on June 30 last were, so far as is
known, absolutely friendless ; that upwards of 200, or 10 per cent.,
are foreigners; and that only about 900 are known to have friends
or relatives in this Colony. This isolation, which is something
terrible to a new emigrant, and which lasts often for years, is
kept up by the disparity of the sexes, which at the close of 1879
stood at 409,665 males and 324,617 females, and to some extent
prevents marriage ; and it is fostered by the peculiar mode of life
both of the miner and the bushman, by the shifting from place to
place with the seasons in search of work, and by the restlessness
which seems an inherent feature of colonial existence at present.
The absence of all near home ties and all active sympathy,
together with the constant change of associates, leads on the one
hand to a dwarfing of all those better feelings which are fostered
and flourish in home life, and on the other to the development of
a miserable selfishness, to a concentration of all thought in one
unwholesome direction, to a suspicion and distrust of ever-chang-
ing comrades, and at last to evil habits, to introspection, to
hypochondriasis, and to the development of delusions of suspicion
and fear, which are prominent symptoms in this class of cases.
Isolation is most potent as a cause of insanity, as might be ex-
pected among men, but it is found among women also, many cf
whom have landed in this country quite friendless, and a large
number of whom, in an after stage of life, live in terrible isolation .
surrounded by some real and some imaginary dangers, in home-
steads in the distant bush, from which their husbands arc-
frequently absent as shearers, teamsters, &c., for long periods.
A system of family, instead of isolated, emigration, would io
much to prevent this cause of insanity, and the present system of
assisted immigration, by which persons come out to the charge
and partly at the expense of friends, is decidedly better in this
regard than one which lands on our shores a number of friendless
strangers. With increasing population, with less disparity in
numbers between the sexes, with more settled modes of life, and
with the growth of a native-born population, this cause of insanity
will no doubt lessen and in time disappear.
Intemperance in drink appears in the English statistics as
causing a percentage of 14-6, and in the Gladesville the per-
centage stands at 8 - 3. It must be remembered that 30 per cent


must be subtracted from the former to make these proportions of
equal value in the two tables. This will give nearly 10 per cent,
as the English rate, and represents, I believe, fairly the proportion
of insanity due directly or indirectly to this cause. I attach the
more value to these statistics because they have been collected by
a number of. independent observers, and are therefore free from
the chance of error due to individual and unconscious bias which
besets all statistics drawn up by one person. For some years past
I have read everything I could find to read on this subject,
have now no small personal experience bearing on this question,
and have come to the conclusion that the. effect of intemperance
as a cause of insanity has been largely exaggerated. I put aside
at once all that intemperance of statement which seems to be
inseparable from the habitual denunciation of intemperance in
drink. There is in this nothing but vague and sensational
declamation unsupported by any attempt at proof. To a certain
class of mind drunkenness is the root of all evil, and some of our
professional brethren have not been free from an unconscious
exaggeration of statement on this subject. The earlier statistics,
which set down at least 25 per cent, of all insanity as caused by
intemperance in drink, have been proved to be erroneous by
statistics taken over a wider field, and by many unprejudiced
observers, and the startling statements of Dr. Howe, that almost all
cases of idiocy were due to drunkenness in the parents, which to
some extent shifted the ground and upheld the idea that drink
was an enormous indirect factor of insanity, have been disproved
by the researches of Dr. Grabhan, of the Earlswood Asylum, Dr.
Bucknill, and other writers. To quote the words of an asylum
physician in a neighbouring Colony, “intemperance is a cause so
readily seized, so easily packed into a word, comes so easily under
the notice of a patient’s family, his friends, or the public, that a
few striking instances engross the mind, and unconsciously count
for many a dozen others, which without obvious cause enter
unnoticed into the asylum.” In not a few instances in my
experience, the intemperance stated to be a cause was really
a symptom—one of the evidences of a loss of self-control—due
to brain disease manifestly existent at an antecedent date to the
outbreak.
The strongest argument next to that derived from such statistics
as I lay before you, that intemperance is not so potent a cause of
insanity as is generally supposed, is to be derived from pathology.
I would ask what is your experience as medical practitioners as to
the pathological condition of the habitual drunkard, and I think
you will answer that such cases die of liver and kidney disease,
of apoplexy or of delirium tremens (a very different thing to
insanity), but that they do not in any considerable proportion go
mad. The proliferation of connective tissue is one of the


prominent pathological changes produced by alcohol in the struc-
ture of numerous organs where its effects have been carefully
studied. The brain and nerve structure of lunatics should present
a corresponding condition if the cause of insanity were drink.
The post-mortem rooms of hospitals for the insane afford little or no
evidence of this except in one or two special forms of disease, and
it is rare in my experience to find in patients dying in these
institutions the peculiar changes in liver and kidney which are
known to be due to alcoholism, and which should be abundantly
frequent if these patients had been drunkards. The quality of
the drink and the mode in which it is taken has perhaps a larger
share in the production of insanity, at all events in this Colony,
than the quantity. The quality of the beverages supplied in
roadside and up-country public-houses, and even in Sydney and
the larger towns is, as I need hardly remind you, abominably bad.
Apart from fusel oil and other products of recent and imperfect
distillation, direct adulteration is largely practised. Kerosene,
tobacco, cocculus indicus, and other deleterious substances, are
freely used, and there can be no doubt thgt these poisons, to use
the language of the Laureate :
‘ ‘ Confuse the chemic labour of the blood,
And tickling the brute brain within the man’s,
Make havock among those tender cells.”
The system of drinking which is almost unknown in older countries
has also not a little to answer for. Short and reckless outbursts of
drinking, alternate with prolonged and often compulsory periods
of abstinence. These horrible orgies on bad liquor may, and no
doubt not unfrequently do, result in insanity.
Though I believe that the amount of insanity caused by drink
has been exaggerated, still the amount given in these statistics
calls for earnest consideration. In round numbers 10 per cent, is
set down as due to this cause, and 200 out of the 2,000 persons
now under care must be considered to have become insane from
intemperance in drink. Calculating the cost of construction in
our hospitals for the insane at from XISO to £2OO per bed, and
with the high price of labour it has not been much less, we have a
primary outlay for these 200 cases of from £30,000 to £40,000,
and an annual maintenance rate of upwards of £6,000 a-year.
The prevention of insanity due to drink becomes in this aspect
a vast social as well as a medical problem—the solution of which
is, I think, to be largely found—•
Ist. In the reduction of the number of public-houses, so as to
lessen unwholesome competition;
2nd. In the thorough and frequent inspection of all liquors
sold;
3rd. In the introduction into common use of sound light wines,
the many forms of effervescent drinks, and more than


all of ice. The common use of iced water in America,
where it can be obtained in every railway carriage' and
in every village, has done more I believe to reduce intern-
peranoe than anything else ;
4th. In better and more wholesome modes of preparing food,
which even in our hotels is often so uninviting and
monotonous as to disgust and lead, not only to drinking
habits, but to dyspepsia and chronic ill health, of which
I shall have something to say further on.
Sexual intemperance appears in the English table as responsible
or about 1 per cent, of the cases, and though it is not perhaps a
very frequent cause of insanity itself, it is worth the consideration of
medical practitioners as the cause of various nervous affections which
may conduce to insanity, either in the individual or his offspring.
In my position as Medical Superintendent of Gladesville I was not
unfrequently consulted by persons suffering from hypochondriasis
and other forms of nervous affection, and in a considerable proportion
I ascertained that there was sexual intemperance. In some cases of
insanity admitted into the Hospital, and especially in elderly men
with young wives, I have with good reason attributed recovery to
the temporary and enforced continence.
Lallemand was the first to point out the influence of seminal
discharges on certain forms of vesania, and though like almost all
specialists he no doubt exaggerated their influence, he did good
service in showing that hypochondria, moral prostration, and true
melancholy were sometimes due to this cause. The effects of
sexual intemperance in lawful or unlawful channels must be
differentiated from masturbation, because to the latter is added a
secret, shameful, and moral cause of degradation, and the form of
insanity due to this cause differs in some respects from that due
to sexual intemperance only. You will perceive that masturba-
tion is credited with 1-7 per cent, in the Gladesville and 1 - 2 per
cent, in the English tables, and these rates will doubtless seem
small to all who have read a certain kind of sensational literature,
which itself by the way has done more to cause insanity than the
practices which it denounces. There is little doubt but that
masturbation has been too frequently cited as a cause of insanity
by observers who are without the breadth of view which can only
be gathered by a complete scientific and medical education. It is
frequently seen in the course of insanity as a symptom, especially
in acute mania, since with the evanescence of reason and its con-
trolling power comes a temporary subservience to animal pro-
pensities and (iswdrml habits. But the practice ceases with the re-
enthronement of the controlling power. I have repeatedly known
it to exist in the course of attacks of mental aberration, and ascer-
tained that it was not only discarded but regarded with due
abhorrence after recovery.


A reference to the tables will show you the small amount of
insanity said to be due to venereal disease—G 4 per cent, in one and
0-6 per cent, in the other. It has been to me a frequent wonder that
more cases of insanity were not due to syphilis, and it is certainly
curious that in 4,000 admissions primary syphilis was only seen
in three cases.
Sunstroke, as might be supposed, is a cause of insanity in a much
greater degree in New South Wales than in England. It appears
in the English table as causing 1 - 3 per cent., but it should be
remembered that this includes numerous cases where the attack
has occurred abroad : soldiers sent from India to the wards for the
Army Department at Grove House, Bow; sailors invalided from
foreign stations, and admitted to the Hospital for the Insane at
Yarmouth; besides isolated cases sent from hot countries under
medical advice. Practically sunstroke, as a cause of insanity, in
England, is almost unknown. It is far otherwise in this Colony.
Five per cent, of the total number of cases are accredited to it, and
1 think with good reason. The effect of sun- or heat-stroke in the
production of disease is not sufficiently appreciated. Many slight
attacks of illness assigned to other causes are I believe due to the
effect of heat and glare on the cerebral circulation. The enormous
power of the sun’s rays is well shown by the observation of Mr.
Bussell, the Government Astronomer. The thermometer with a
black bulb placed in black cotton wool not infrequently in the
summer-time reaches the boiling point, and on one occasion a ther-
mometer graduated to 234 burst under these conditions. It is in
the power of physicians to prevent much mischief by inculcating
greater care in avoiding exposure, by insisting on a more rational
head covering for the summer months than a black stove-pipe hat,
and by pointing out that after an attack of sunstroke alcohol is an
absolute poison, and cannot be taken with impunity in even small
quantities. A person who has once suffered from sunstroke must
be either a teetotaller or a lunatic. There is, I believe, no middle
standpoint.
Accident or injury to the head is mentioned in both tables as a
cause of insanity. In some cases it is a direct, but it is more often
a predisposing, cause. It is in cases predisposed by injury that
sunstroke, intemperance, excitement, and other causes light the
fire which has been already laid. Where injury to the skull exists
a caution as to the avoidance of exciting causes may not infre-
quently save from further danger. During the year 1872 I took
some trouble to examine every patient admitted, and found marks
of injury to the head more or less severe in 30 per cent.
I do not propose to dwell on the puerperal state—pregnancy,
parturition, and lactation—as a cause of insanity, but I think it
may be well to put on record my opinion that lactation prolonged
beyond the ordinary time, or continued by delicate women even up


to the ordinary period, is more frequently a cause of insanity in this
country than in England. In the English table it is set down
as causing less than 1 per cent. Unfortunately in the Gladesville
tables the causation is not so fully differentiated. Lactation is
Included under the general heading of the puerperal state, and I
have not found time to re-examine the case books with a view of
ascertaining the exact proportion attributed to this cause alone.
I feel sure, however, from the prominence which it has assumed
in my mind as a cause of insanity, that the proportion is greater
here than in England. Probably the enervating climate and the
want of milk and good digestible food in the up-country districts
help to render lactation more depressing than in England, and
suggest a shortening of the period and greater attention to diet as
necessary.
From this point the tables having been prepared on a somewhat
different plan become more difficult to compare, though on close
examination and on grouping the causes, there is seen to be a close
agreement in some of the percentages. For instance, fevers, pri-
vation, uterine and ovarian disease, and other bodily disorders, in
the English table, give together a percentage of 13-7, whilst fever,
chronic ill health, want, phthisis, and epilepsy, in the Gladesville
tables, give together exactly the same figures.
It is only during comparatively late years that progress has
been made in the idea of an intimate correlation, of a relation of
cause and effect between affections of organs far removed from
the encephalon and disorders of the mind. The influence of uterine
and ovarian affections, disorders of the digestive functions, lesions
of the stomach and intestinal canal, affections of the liver, heart
disease, pulmonary phthisis, are now among the best recognised
causes of mental aberration; and we know to-day that there is
not a single part of the economy, lesions of which may not bring
about psychical disorder in predisposed subjects. The ascending
course of some diseases of the spinal cord towards the brain by
which ataxic and paraplegic subjects become in time dements
is also almost universally recognised, and, to use the language
of a distinguished French professor of mental medicine—“ Clinical
observers have, so to speak, shifted the axis of mental medicine,
and we no longer gravitate round psychology. The diseases of
the body and brain, and not merely the perturbations of the under-
standing, command our attention and treatment.”
I have been greatly struck with the number of cases admitted
into Gladesville with symptoms of dyspepsia, and with what for
want of a better term is designated in the table “ Chronic ill-
health,” and I cannot but attribute a considerable proportion of
these to the want of varied and properly cooked meals. I doubt
if there is any country in the world where with abundance of
food there is less variety or less evidence of civilization in its


preparation. Salt meat and damper are still a frequent if not the
continuous dietary of large numbers. Fresh meat is cooked in a
manner glaringly monotonous ; milk is untasted by a large pro-
portion of the up-country population for months together, and
vegetables except potatoes are an infrequent luxury for which
numbers have to thank the itinerant Chinaman ; whilst tea, black,
milkless, and often sugarless, is drunk at every meal and in
quantities which take away appetite for the more solid and too
often unappetising viands.
It is no wonder that women, especially during lactation, break
down under such a regimen, that men feel a crying, physical, or
physiological want which drives them to bursts of hard drinking,
or that the digestive powers fail, and with them the nourishment
of the brain as well as other organs.
A bountiful, a varied, and a nutritious diet is in many cases of
service in warding off threatened attacks of insanity, or arresting
in its early stages, and this with attention to special symptoms
denoting bodily ailment is the main agent in the recovery in not a
few advanced cases. With better modes of carriage and with
denser population we shall in time no doubt get a more varied
dietary, and it is to be hoped that cookery will be taught as a
special and compulsory subject in the projected High Schools for
Girls, and in the higher classes of our public schools.
In the Gladesville table epilepsy is given as a factor to the extent
of 5 - 9 per cent., but in the English table this cause is grouped, as
it seems to me unwisely, among other bodily diseases or disorders.
I find, however, from some statistics given by the English Com-
missioners in 1876, that epilepsy is credited with 6 - 5 per cent., so
that probably the potency of this affection in the production of
insanity is about the same in both countries. An interesting
point in connection with this affection is its strong hereditary
character, and its tendency to run off in offspring into kindred
neuroses or even into idiocy or insanity. In the January num-
ber of “ Brain” for 1880 is an elaborate article by Mr. Henry
Clarke, surgeon to the Wakefield Prison, on heredity in epileptic
criminals, and though possibly the hereditary nature of the malady
may be more marked in criminal than in other classes, this paper
shows its extreme character and potency. In 119 epileptics, par-
ticulars of whose cases were inquired into with the most pains-
taking diligence, 54, or 45 per cent, showed hereditary influence
direct or collateral, and these 54 epileptics were proved to have no
less than 124 epileptic relatives, one having as many as eleven, and
several four or five each. Dr. Gowers, in his Gulstonian lectures,
published in the Lancet during the current year, states that
out of 1,250 epileptics who came under his care at the National
Hospital for Epilepsy and Paralysis, he found distinct hereditary
influence in 452, or 36 per cent. Mr. Clarke’s researches at


Wakefield further showed that the number of direct hereditary
epileptics is much greater among women than men, and that the
epileptic strain is transmitted more strongly by the female sex,
thus bearing out the statements of Trousseau on this subject.
With regard to the connection between epilepsy and insanity, no
less than 24 per cent, of Mr. Clarke’s non-insane epileptics had
insane relatives, whilst 41 per cent, of the whole and 66 per cent,
of the women were descended from insane parents. Out of Dr.
Gowers’ 1,250 cases 157 were known to have insane relations.
The question of the marriage of epileptics is sometimes submitted
to medical practitioners, and in my opinion should be invariably
answered in the negative.
The hereditary transmission of insanity is a subject of the
most profound interest, both from a medical and social stand-
point, and to a medical superintendent of a hospital for the
insane it is a duty increasing in interest with each year’s ex-
perience to trace out the relationships of present and former
patients. I have had under my care at various times five sons of
a mother who died at Gladesville under my predecessor; a brother
and sister, two children of the former, and one of the latter have
passed through my wards ; three sisters ; two sisters, and a child of
one of them; a mother and two children have at different times been
under treatment. And the instances in which two of a family have
been under care are innumerable. Even the relatives who come to
visit patients frequently display marked forms of neurosis and are
in this respect an interesting study to the medico-psychologist. The
Gladesville statistics are however, as might be expected, much less
complete in this particular than the English ones, and give only
7 - 2 per cent, as due to hereditary influence. The reason of
this is not far to seek. In a former part of this paper I have
stated that nothing whatever is known of the relatives of upwards
of 1,000 out of 2,000 patients now under care, and, as might
be expected, in a very large proportion of those who have friends,
such friends have little or no knowledge of the family history or
of relatives in far-away lands. - In many cases husbands know
nothing whatever of the families of their wives, and in not a few
cases I have found that neither patients nor their friends could
tell me even the nationality of the grand-parents. The statistics
obtained in England, where the family history of almost every
patient can be traced, afford much more complete and conclusive
evidence as to the hereditary character of the malady. In the
English tables now before you hereditary influence was ascertained
in 17 - 5 of the cases admitted, andsome medical superintendents who
have specially inquired into and studied this subject place the per-
centage as much higher. Dr. Savage, of Bethlehem, shows a per-
centage of 34 per cent., or 375 out of 1,072 patients admitted
under his care. Dr. Needham, of York, gives 31 per cent, or


334 out of 1,029 admissions; whilst in Dr. Thumam’s well-
known statistics of the “Retreat,” 153 cases were known to be due
to heredity out of 469, or nearly one-third. Similar statistics
have been published in Scotland, and the Inspectors of Lunatic
Asylums in Ireland, in their 27 th Report, call attention to and
give statistics on this subject. This intense hereditary influence
has been noticed abroad as well as in Great Britain and Ireland.
Esquirol observes, that of all diseases insanity is the most heredi-
tary, and gives figures showing that in one-fourth of the total
number of cases coming under his care this influence was ascer-
tained. Guislain estimates it at one-fourth in Belgium, and
Damerou in Holland traced it in 187 cases out of 773 admissions,
or about one-fourth. There is reason to fear that the pro-
portion of insanity due to hereditary influence is steadily in-
creasing. Dr. Ball, Professor of Mental Medicine at the Univer-
sity of Paris, in a lecture recently published in the Lancet, speaks
confidently of “ the greater and greater preponderance of heredity
in mental aberration,” and so Jong ago as 1872 the Inspectors of
Lunatic Asylums in Ireland, in an elaborate report, after pointing
out that there was then as large if not larger aggregate of insanity
among a population of little more than five millions as there
was in 1864, when the population numbered six millions, go on to
say, “it is idle to disguise the fact that it is an affection of
hereditary and progressive tendency, and to no inconsiderable ex-
tent through imbecile females, particularly in the humbler classes
of society.” It is a sad and striking fact that insanity itself, or
a condition of brain strongly predisposing to it, is a legacy left
to hundreds by their progenitors, and it is no small part of the
benefit which institutions for the insane confer upon the com-
munity that they check in a very large degree the propagation of
a malady so hereditary in its character. A diffusion of a knowledge
of the terrible hereditary character of insanity may do something
to prevent imprudent marriages, but unfortunately it is not with
the prudent and thoughtful that we have to deal. It is with the
wayward, the impulsive, and the improvident, with brains bearing
subtle mischief in their recesses, and but little likely to look
beyond selfish gratification. The time has not yet arrived for legisla-
tive interference. In time to come however, when the liberty of
the subject is made more subordinate to the welfare of the com-
munity, it will perhaps be found expedient in the interest of
future generations to insist on prolonged isolation or operative
interference in the case of all persons who have been afflicted with
mental disease. In the meantime, to quote the words of Dr.
Blandford, “it behoves a physician before whom the terrible
results of imprudence in this direction are paraded day by day to
hold out a warning and to point out the evils which result from
imprudent union, and the immense amount of insanity'itself, as


well as epilepsy, chorea, neuralgia, and other nerve disorders,
transmitted from parent to offspring.” It is, in my opinion, not
too much to say that any person who marries, except under very
special circumstances, after such a marked and prolonged attack
of mental derangement as required hospital treatment, commits a
crime against posterity.
Five per cent, of the cases in the Gladesville and 4-8 per cent, in
the English table are stated to be congenital in origin. Among the
causes of congenital mischief are said to be a condition of intoxi-
cation or epilepsy on the part of parents during coition or concep-
tion ; the marriage of near kin; ill health, injuries, persistent
sickness, emotional excitement, anxiety and fright on the part of
the mother during pregnancy ; injurious compression of the cranial
bones and brain from contracted passage or protracted labour; the
misuse of forceps ; and suspended animation after birth, the latter
considered by Dr. Langdon Down to be a frequent cause. As to
drunkenness or epilepsy during coition or conception as a cause of
congenital mental defect, I must confess that I am sceptical, and
the truth must be difficult to prove.
The effect of the marriage of near kin has been debated at very
considerable length. Huth, whose elaborate work on this subject
is well known, and whose opinions have been widely adopted out-
side our profession, scouts the idea that consanguineous marriages
are harmful, and answers the question whether consanguineous
marriages give a greater proportion of unhealthy children than non-
consanguineous marriages with a decided negative, stating that even
where the marriages of blood relations are habitual, deterioration
even through the chance accumulation of an idiosyncrasy, practi-
cally does not occur oftener than in other marriages. Other
observers have, however, come to a different conclusion, and I
would commend to your attention a thoughtful paper on the inter-
marriage of relations, full of statistics and arguments, by Dr.
Nathan Allen, and originally published in the Quarterly Journal
of Psychological Medicine for April, 1869, which to my mind
affords conclusive evidence that such marriages do result in idiocy,
epilepsy, deafmutism, and other forms of neurotic disease. Dr.
Mitchell, one of the Commissioners in Lunacy for Scotland, who
is perhaps as well qualified to form an opinion on this subject as
any one in Great Britain, estimates 10 per cent, of the idiocy in
Scotland to consanguineous marriage. My own experience on the
subject is limited ; but in the few cases in which two imbecile
children in one family have come under my observation the
parents have been always nearly related, and in the only instance
in which I have known three children in one family idiotic I
obtained evidence that they were the offspring of the incestuous
union of brother and sister. The conclusions I have arrived at,
and in ' which I think you will agree, are that consanguineous


marriages have a tendency to strengthen and develop in the
offspring individual peculiarities of the parents, both mental and
physical, whether morbid or otherwise, and therefore in practice
they do often induce degeneration ; and also that by means of a
proper regard to known facts relating to hereditary transmission,
a physician may predict with accuracy the probable result, as
regards the health of the offspring, of a marriage of blood relations
in any particular case, if he be only sufficiently acquainted with
the hygienic history of the family. It is to be much regretted
that medical advice on this subject is not more often sought and
more often acted on. It would be well in many cases if the
family physician could forbid the banns.
On the other causes of congenital defect which I have men-
tioned it is not my intention to enlarge.
The influence of modern civilization in the production of insanity
is an interesting question. There is little doubt, though insanity is
of all times and all ages, that savage races are comparatively little
liable to it, and that their mode of life, in which the survival of the
fittest obtains to its fullest extent, prevents anything like hereditary
transmission, or the increase of insanity or idiocy by accumulation.
In the idyllic calm of life in Madagascar, and where, by the way,
it appears that insane persons are not destroyed as among some
savage races, there is no need for a lunatic asylum among a popu-
lation estimated at upwards of 5,000,000. In the days of American
slavery—when all the physical wants of the slave were attended
to; when there was no outlet for mental activity, or need for mental
anxiety; when, indeed, the lives of these people were those of
children—coloured inmates of asylums in the Southern States were
few in number. In the States of Georgia and Virginia the
number of insane among the coloured population was, it is stated
by competent witnesses, at no time prior to emancipation, more
than eighty out of a population of 800,000; whilst it appears
from recent asylum reports that there are now more than 800
insane persons of this race in these two States. It has been well
said that it is better to be civilized and free with even a large
chance of becoming insane than to be a savage or a slave without
this; but the question remains whether the amount of insanity
due to our modem civilization is not excessive, and to a large
extent preventible. Insanity certainly was well known in all
past epochs of civilization, and ancient literature, sacred and
profane, teems with mention of it and illustration of its phases ;
but there is good reason to think that our civilization, in its varied
and higher developments as well as in its manufacture of pauper
and struggling classes, and especially in its many expedients for
rendering possible, and prolonging the existence of those least
fitted to survive and multiply, has caused and is still causing a
higher percentage of insanity than was known in former times.


In no epoch has, what for want of a better expression, I will
term “ mental excess,” been more prevalent than in this. News-
papers, medical and lay, have frequently of late pointed out the
evils of our present system of stuffing our youth and making all
boyhood and girlhood one long period of cramming for examina-
tion. The examinations at the London and other Universities
and for professions have become almost encyclopedic in their
range. The whole system tends to confuse and distract the mind,
to unfit it for the work of the world, to stunt originality,
and to induce what has not inaptly been termed “ brain-fog.”
Where there is no absolute break-down at the time, and instances
of this are much more frequent than is commonly supposed, seeds
are planted for the growth of mental disorder later in life, and
many a brain is upset which had it been subjected to more moderate
pressure would have escaped unharmed. I know no stronger
evidence as to the evil done by overwork at schools and competitive
examinations than that of Dr. Andrew Clarke, who states that he
has discovered temporary albuminuria in 10 per cent, of the can-
didates sent to him for examination as to physical health after
passing the Civil Service examination for India.
. Next comes the high pressure, the fever and fret of professional
and business life, the haste, competition, and all-pervading dis-
quiet, which has had no parallel in other times. The over-work
connected with business, the severe mental labour of the profes-
sions, the anxiety, excitement, and harass of the mercantile world,
all these are tangible factors of mental disease, though in most
instances it is difficult to tabulate the cause. It behoves us, I
think, as physicians, to inculcate some pause and leisure in life, and
to encourage the tendency which happily exists in this Colony to
indulge in out-door sports and amusements of every kind.
In the English table 22’8 per cent., and in the Gladesville table
25 - 9 per cent, of the causes are set down as “unascertained.” The
greater percentage in the Gladesville table is due to the defective
means we have for obtaining trustworthy information by ques-
tioning relatives and friends, and to causes which I have already
indicated. The large proportion in both is, I apprehend, due to
the fact that the development of insanity generally requires a
concurrence of several adverse incidents, and that many cases can-
not be attributed to any one special event. . It is better, I think,
to be seeking for a solution of the problem than to set forth a
fancied knowledge, and it need disturb our complacency but little
to find that the solution of some of the most difficult questions in
morbid psychology is, as yet, beyond us.

* With reference to the above distinction between “ predisposing” and “ exciting” causes, it must be understood that no cause is enumerated more
than once in the case of any individual patient.
t These totals represent the entire number of instances in which the several causes, either alone or in combination with others, were stated to have
produced the mental disorder. The aggregate of these totals including “ unknown” will of course exceed the whole number of patients admitted. The
excess is owing to the combinations.
