CHAPTER ONE
MRS. MURPHY TRIUMPHS
" I don?t like the idea at all Evelyn,? said Wendy?s
father stubbornly. " Furthermore, Ido not think
Wendy would be happy there. Winterton is the school
chosen by all the society people for their daughters, and
Wendy Murphy, as the daughter of a butcher, would
have nothing in common with such girls.?
"And I agree with you Dad,? supported Wendy
emphatically. ? I?m quite happy at the local school
and I get a good education there, so why bother to waste
your money sending me to Winterton? ?
" But Winterton would not be Waste of money! ?
protested Mrs. Murphy with a patient sigh.
"It would Mummy! ? argued Wendy again. ?It
would, because, as I have just said, I get a good educa-
tion at the High School! ?
" Of course! ? boomed Mr. Murphy with a proud note
in his voice. ? Why Evelyn, Wendy was top in Latin
last year and top in French and . . . . ?
" And ?she speaks, dresses and acts like a tomboy and
her religious knowledge is practically nil! ? finished
his wife dryly.
" Oh Mummy! ? protested Wendy in a very injured
voice indeed.
Surely Evelyn,? broke in Mr. Murphy more quietly,
" those things are the concern of the parents more than
of the school ? ?
"Oh yes. That is true enough,? agreed his wife with
a sigh. ? But the point is Robert, we have not con-
cerned ourselves with those things. We have spoilt


Wendy atrociously. She didn?t like Sunday School
so we never made her go, and we didn?t trouble to fill
that gap by teaching her ourselves. At a boarding
school, religion will be part of the daily routine, and
she will have to attend Church whether she likes it or
not.?
" It sounds pretty ghastly! ? announced Wendy, who
was used to getting her own way in most things.
Mrs. Murphy ignored the interruption however.
" In addition, I think Winterton will give Wendy
" polish ? Robert.?
"I don?t want to be polished!? asserted Wendy
rebelliously.
? But will Winterton teach her all these things? ? asked
Robert Murphy sceptically.
" I think so,? answered his wife gently. "At least it
should give her some knowledge of religion, and so
far as I am concerned that is the main advantage.?
"M-m!? said Mr. Murphy and cleared his throat.
? M-m! ? He glanced sideways at his daughter.
Wendy looked sulky. She knew the signs. When-
ever Dad said " m-m ? like that it meant capitulation.
Anyway he could never refuse Alummy anything she
asked.
Mrs. Afurphy turned to her daughter.
" Come Wendy, be sensible dear! There is nothing
to look so glum about. You are really a very lucky
girl if you would only realise it. If it were Alary I
am sure she would be delighted to have the chance of
going to Winterton.?
''Who is taking my name in vain?? called a merry
voice at this juncture.


Wendy?s face cleared instantly and she cascaded herself
enthusiastically at the slim girl who had entered the
shop.
? Mary! Come in and support me for goodness? sake!
Mummy is agitating to send me to school at Winterton
and I?m telling her I?d much rather go back to the High
with you.?
" Winterton! ? echoed Mary enviously. ? Winterton!
Oh how lucky you are Wendy. I wish I could go
with you.?
"Why? What?s wrong with the High School??
asked Wendy, nettled by her friend?s complete lack of
support.
Mary coloured.
"Oh! Nothing of course, but ?well ?Winterton!
I?ve always longed to go there ever since I was brides-
maid to my cousin when she was married at the
Winterton chapel. Moira, lucky thing, was an old
Winterton girl.?
" Well, why don?t you persuade your mother to let you
come too! ? suggested Wendy enthusiastically.
But Mary shook her head sadly.
" I?m afraid that is quite out of the question now.
Since dad was killed in this beastly old war, mother
and I have only his pension upon which to exist. I
doubt if I will be able to go back to the High School
next year, let alone Winterton! ?
" Oh! ? Wendy?s voice was apologetic. In her excite-
ment she had forgotten about Mary?s father. " I?m
sorry Mary, I forgot.?
" That?s all right! ? Mary smiled bravely. " But you
are a lucky Wendy. Winterton is a lovely place.


I?ve read about it a lot. It used to be the home of an
old pioneer family long ago when the colony was first
founded. It stands right on top of a hill ?just as
Harrow does in England you know ?an enormous place
with a verandah all the way round, and little balconies
from the top storey, and Virginia creeper has climbed
right up the colonnades to the roof. There are acres
and acres of playing fields too and ... . ? Mary
drew a breath. " And the dearest little Chapel! Just
think of starting the day with prayers in your own
School Chapel Wendy! ?
" Rubbish! ? exploded Wendy scoffingly. " It?s pro-
bably not a bit better than the High if the truth?s known.
What has Winterton besides beautiful buildings ?
answer me that Mary Mornington! ?
" For one thing,? answered Mary, her eyes still dreamy,
? Winterton has tradition and that?s a thing not many
Australian schools can claim yet. The country is still
a bit young for tradition.?
" And of what good, young lady is tradition? ? boomed
Mr. Murphy taking up the cudgels once more. He
had been listening intently to Mary?s little speech, but
it was, after all, his wife who answered his question.
" A good tradition is the best gift our forefathers could
give us,? she said pensively. "Of course, like every-
thing else, tradition can be carried to extremes.? She
looked at Mary anxiously. "Do you think they carry
tradition to extremes at Winterton Mary? ?
?Be Moderate. That is the Winterton motto,?
supplied Mary quickly and conclusively.
*' Better if it were ' Be Modern ? ? muttered Wendy to


herself, but Mary caught her words and she smilingly
ruffled her friend?s brown curls.
" Winterton is modern, Wendy! You just wait until
you see their lovely laboratory and the stream-lined
swimming pool. Oh yes, Winterton keeps up with the
times.?
Mr. Murphy said, " M-m! ? again and looked at his
wife. His gaze fell before the pleading in her eyes.
"Well! Well! Perhaps you could try it Wendy,?
he suggested.
Wendy struggled with her objections. If it was a
fact that Robert Murphy could not resist his wife,
Wendy likewise, adored her father. If he thought she
should try this " posh ? school she?d give it a " go.
" All right dad,? she consented reluctantly. ? I?ll go.
But . . . .? quickly. ?If I find that it is just a
" snob ? place composed of a lot of stupid socialites ?
I ?won?t stay. I?ll run away! ?
Amid the laughter which greeted this sally, Mrs.
Murphy?s voice came mildly.
" If Winterton proves to be what you call a ' snob ?
place Wendy, I will be pleased to remove you.?
So that was how Mrs. Murphy triumphed over the
objections of her husband and daughter and that was
how Wendy Murphy went to Winterton, the leading
girls? school in Australia.


CHAPTER TWO
FELICITY
The day upon which Wendy was to commence her
career as a boarder at Winterton School dawned bright
and clear. It was with some trepidation that she
sprang out of bed that sunny morning and surveyed
her new school uniform hanging ready for her to wear.
Not that it was an ugly uniform ?quite the contrary.
The dark brown tunic and powder blue blouse were a
pretty combination and should go well with Wendy?s
brown hair and eyes. But Wendy, as her mother had
remarked, did not pay much attention to dress. At
the High School, her navy frock invariably had the
hem down or a tear somewhere despite her mother?s
careful supervision.
But as she put on her Winterton clothes Wendy
grudgingly admitted that it did look attractive. She
carried the blue and brown school tie along to her
mother to be knotted.
" Watch how I do it Wendy,? advised Mrs. Murphy,
" for you will have to tie it yourself in future and I
believe they are very particular at Winterton about
general neatness, despite the War and the clothes?
rationing.?
Wendy suppressed a sigh.
" I suppose I?ll be a simpering fashion-plate before
long.?
In a tunic? ? laughed her mother. " Now put your
hat on sweetheart and see that the badge is straight.?
Wendy rammed it on her head.
It won t go straight! ? she grumbled as she surveved
in the mirror, the blue and silver crest depicting the


Cross, the kangaroo and an open book, half-way round
the side.
Mrs. Murphy smilingly adjusted the matter.
" What a baby you are! There! Now look at your-
self in the long mirror. Don?t you feel proud of your
school uniform? ?
" No,? replied Wendy honestly. " It?s nice I?ll admit,
but I don?t feel proud of it yet! ?
" You will,? surmised Mrs. Murphy tranquilly. " Now
here is the newspaper. Sit down quietly and read the
news while vou wait for dad to come back.?
j
" Perhaps he?ll be late and I?ll miss the train! ? opined
Wendy hopefully as she opened the paper and scanned
the head-lines.
" Not much in the way of news here. It?s all war or
social stuff. The Americans are doing well in the
Pacific. Good for the Yanks! Mrs. Walter Wain-
wright gave a garden party ?humbug! ? She gave a
snort of disdain. " And, Miss Felicity . . ,
Wendy sat up with a jerk. " Mum! Just listen to
this! I told you it was a stupid place! ?
Mrs. Murphy looked up enquiringly.
" Which is a stupid place Wendy? ?
" Winterton! ? expostulated her daughter in a disgusted
voice. " Just listen to this tripe! ?
She read aloud: ?
" Miss Felicity Filmore-Danvers, eldest daughter of Sir
John and Lady Filmore-Danvers, has returned from her
holiday by the sea and will return to Winterton School
today.?
Wendy threw the paper down scornfully.
"Did you ever read such tripe? In war-time, too!


And that is what you want to turn me into Mum! ?
" What do I want to turn you into Wendy? ? asked
Mrs. Murphy with a smile.
Wendy gave another snort.
"What? Why Winterton will turn me into a
person like this this Felicity Filmore-Danvers
creature! ?
"You know then, what type of girl Felicity Danvers
is? ? queried Wendy?s mother quietly.
"Of course not! ?? retorted Wendy hotly. " But I can
guess. She?ll be a horrid little snob! ?
" What makes you think that? ?
'Well . . . .! ? Wendy spread her hands out in
a gesture of exasperation. " What else can you expect
from a girl who has these footling paragraphs written
about her? ?
" I think it might be as well for you to wait a little
longer before you so drastically condemn one of your
future school-fellows,? advised Mrs. Murphy gently.
"You are too apt to judge people . . . . ? She
broke off as a step was heard in the shop. " But never
mind now dear. Here?s your father.?
" Felicity Filmore-Danvers! ? scoffed Wendy as she rose
to say goodbye. " The name is enough for me! ?
Mrs. Murphy?s face relaxed as she looked into her
daughter?s flushed countenance. She suddenly gave
way to baurst of laughter, and so infectious was her
merriment that Wendy?s face soon crinkled also, and
it was thus that the first parting with her mother was
rendered more easy.
Mr. Murphy bade his daughter farewell at the station
and hurried away, for his life was a busy one. Therr


were no other Winterton girls in the compartment and
so it was that when the train drew up at the junction
near to the School, Wendy had to find her way alone.
She knew her way of course, as she had visited the
school during the holidays to be enrolled.
She was struggling up the hill with her big portmanteau,
puffing and blowing because it was a stiff climb and her
luggage was heavy, when a big car drew up level with
her and a pleasant voice called from the back window
of it.
? Are you going to Winterton? ?
Wendy, looking up, saw a girl wearing the school hat,
looking enquiringly at her.
"Yes,? replied Wendy shyly, putting down her case
with a bump.
The girl opened the door invitingly.
"Soaml, so hop in! ? Jim will put your case on the
carrier.?
Wendy sank thoughtfully into the luxurious cushions
of the car as the driver obeyed the girl?s order.
" Gosh! That was heavy. Thanks a lot.?
" That?s all right,? responded the elder girl easily.
"You should have left the case at the station though.
All the girls do who come by train and then the railways
deliver them together.?
Wendy nodded, eyeing her companion curiously, as
the car started forward once more. She was a tall
girl, as was indicated by the way she was forced to
double her legs in the car, tall and slender. Her
uniform was immaculate in every detail and it suited
her fair colouring and the grey eyes set irr a pale, aristo-
cratic face. On the lapel of her blazer she wore a


small reproduction of the school badge in silver, which
was surmounted by the letter " P ? in blue.
Wendy knew what that meant. This girl was a
Prefect of Winterton.
"You are new of course. Have you been to boarding
school before? ?
Wendy shook her head mournfully.
" No. And I know I?m going to hate it! ?
"Oh what a pessimist! ? The girl laughed softly.
" Why are you so sure that you will hate Winterton? ?
"It?s it?s such a 'posh? place,? replied Wendy,
scowling a little. "It will be so different from the
High School.?
The girl laughed again.
" I shouldn?t worry about what you call it?s ' poshness. ?
Winterton is wonderful of course ?the best school ever
?and you?ll love it too, once you have settled in. But
shouldn?t we introduce ourselves ? I . , . .??with
a note of pride ?" lam Winterton?s Head Prefect at
present so I?ll have to know your name sooner or later.
Mine, by the way, is Felicity Felicity Filmore-
Danvers! ?
Wendy gave a start. She looked with an expression
approaching horror at her companion.
" Did you say ?Felicity Filmore-Danvers ? ?
Winterton?s Head Prefect raised her brows slightly at
the new girl?s tone.
" Why yes, that is my name. You sound surprised.?
" Oh! ? Wendy flopped back on the cushions whilst
an expression of disgust settled on her face. " Oh! ?
Felicity stared a little and gave a shrug. Her voice
was just a little abrupt when she asked: ?


' What is your name? ?
' Oh,? said Wendy with the suspicion of a sneer,
" That wouldn?t interest you! ?
" Why? ? asked Felicity, staring harder and wondering
if this new girl was not a little stupid. " Why ? Don?t
be silly. I?ve got to know your name.?
"Wendy Murphy!? supplied Wendy defiantly.
" Wendy Murphy. And ?my father has a butcher?s
shop! ?
Felicity looked bewildered.
" What has your father and his shop got to do with
it?? She laughed chaffingly. "He?s not coming to
school is he? ?
Felicity was amazed at the blaze of anger this last
remark, meant teasingly, evoked in her companion.
"You can laugh! ? shouted Wendy, so loudly that the
middle-aged driver jumped perceptibly in his seat. He
was a returned soldier and his nerves were not in the
best condition.
" You can laugh! ? shouted Wendy again. " But let
me tell you this Felicity ?whatever-Danvers you are ?
my father would probably make two of your titled,
hyphenated parent! ?
Felicity flushed. Her lips tightened. Her voice how-
ever was as quiet as ever.
" Aren?t you being rather personal Wendy? I haven?t
any idea what your father is like, but at least there is
no need for you to cast aspersions on mine. You see ?
I happen to think that he is the highest type of gentle-
man one could meet! ?
The remark was a spark to Wendy?s fury.
" Butchers are gentlemen too! ?


Of course! ? agreed Felicity promptly. " I never
said they weren?t, but . . . . ?
"Oh, you needn?t bother to apologise!? flung back
Wendy scornfully. " It?s only what I expected at
Winterton. This is Winterton I suppose? ?as they
drew up before a big two-storeyed colonial building
set on the very crest of the hill.
This is the Main School,? nodded Felicity proudly,
forgetting her companion?s curious manner as she
surveyed the lovely place she loved so dearly. " Dear
old Winterton! ?
She put a gentle hand on Wendy ?s arm. " Uphold it?s
good name Wendy. Don?t let it down! ?
Her reverie was broken by the sudden slamming of the
car door as Wendy stepped out muttering angrily to
herself.
Afraid, I suppose, that I?ll let it down because my
name is Murphy ? and not ' Filmore-Danvers ?!
Pah! Snob! ?


CHAPTER THREE
SETTLING IN
The boarders of Winterton were lining up, under the
direction of their Captains in order of House.
Everyone had arrived and the First General Assembly
had taken place in Main Hall. At this ceremony, Miss
Lethbridge, the Head-Mistress had delivered her open-
ing speech and welcomed the new boarders, allotted
them to their Houses and dismissed the school to settle
in.
Wendy was to join " The Gums,? the House captained
by Betsy Liddicombe.
As they all crowded out into the quadrangle, Felicity
Filmore-Danvers, Head-Prefect of the whole School,
Captain of ? Waratah ? House and a great personage
indeed at Winterton, gave the order: ?
? House-Captains, attention please! You will line up
your girls in order of House! Waratah over here
please. Come on all Waratah girls! ?
The Waratahs, doing everything first because their
Captain was Head of the School, arranged themselves
in orderly lines, seniors leading.
Then the ? Wattles ? sprang to attention at the rather
stentorian cry of their captain, the Senior School Prefect,
Margaret Wainwright. Margaret liked things done
smartly. She was sporting and popular but she stood
no nonsense.
Followed " Banksia ? rallying perhaps not quite so
promptly to the order of Helen Nicholson. Helen s
air was not quite as authoritative as that of Felicity or
Margaret.


' The Gums ? should have been in some sort of order
by this time. They were the last House and had had
tons of time to be ready, but Betsy Liddicombe was a
dreamer. Crazy about music, she found herself com-
posing at the most inconvenient moments ?moments
such as this ?when, instead of marshalling her forty
or so girls into line to march House-wards ?she would
conceive a tune in her brain and allow herself to drift
off into a world of fantasy.
" Betsy! ? shouted Felicity impatiently, as she observed
the disorder amongst the " Gums.? "Betsy! Wake
up! We?re waiting! ?
Betsy turned a dreamy eye to the Head-Girl.
" It?s a lovely tune! Just what I need to complete
that composition Felicity! ?
A ripple of laughter ran through the ranks. Margaret
lifted her eyes Heaven-wards in a gesture of resignation.
" She?s off again! ??
Felicity strode forward.
" Really Betsy! You might choose a better time than
this to compose. Look at the state of your lines! ?
At her irritable tone Betsy jerked herself back to
realities.
Oh yes, the House! lam sorry Felicity. Are all
the other Houses ready? ?
All except " The Gums,? as usual,? commented
Felicity drily.
Betsy flushed.
" I?m sorry,? she began again. "I . . . . ? Betsy
broke off as a small figure ranged itself at her side.
"Does she boss you too?? asked Wendy Murphy,
stormily. " She tried it on me but then I?m new! ?


Betsy turned in bewilderment to stare at the new-comer.
Felicity, flushed, stood quietly by.
" Who are you? ? asked Betsy in amazement.
" Wendy Murphy. New girl for ' The Gums ?
House!? supplied that young lady promptly.
Betsy?s lips tightened. Her expression now was far
from dreamy.
?' i se e. Well, new girls do not as a rule criticise their
seniors! ? she snubbed. "Go back to your lines
immediately ?no, wait! A member of my House, new
or otherwise will not say rude things about the Head of
the School without an apology.?
" You want me to apologise to ?to Felicity? echoed
Wendy indignantly. " Why? ?
" Fve told you why now apologise!? ordered the
House-Captain sternly.
" But I was championing you! ? protested Wendy in an
injured voice.
? Apologise! ? insisted Betsy.
Wendy?s defences fell before that firm voice.
" Fm sorry,? she mumbled sulkily to Felicity.
" In future,? went on Betsy icily, ? I?ll thank you if
you mind your own business. Felicity has every right
to boss me, as you call it, and I don t need your
championship! ?
With which remark Betsy ignored the presumptuous
junior and turned to her superior.
" I?ll get them together in two minutes Felicity.?
Felicity nodded absently. Her grey eyes, wondering,
and puzzled followed as she returned to her
" Queer kid. Not used to school ways of course.?


In two minutes the Gum-ites were assembled. Betsy
Liddicombe?s voice was sharp as she gave the order:
"Gums! Form ?lines!"
Soon the lines of her House rivalled even those of the
redoubtable Margaret Wainwright and way down,
amongst the Form known as "Remove? Marjorie
Millward tugged Wendy Murphy alongside of her.
You have got a cheek! ?? she remarked as they marched
smartly House-wards. Whatever made you barge
in on the prefects like that? ?
New girls generally lie low during the first few
days! ? chimed in the voice of Betty Babbington from
behind. Betsy Liddicombe may be a bit of a dreamer
at times but it doesn?t do to cross her when she is in a
paddy."
" Whatever made you do such a crazy thing though? ?
asked Betty?s marching partner, Mary Annandale.
I thought that Head-Prefect person was bullying your
House-Captain," explained the new girl grumpily. She
felt a bit foolish now.
" Bullying? ? echoed Marjorie and smiled. " I should
hardly call it bullying. You see, Wendy, Felicity is
Head of the School.?
" You all seem to think a jolly lot of her,? said Wendy.
We do!" agreed Betty enthusiastically. "Felicity
is the goods, isn?t she, girls? ?
The very best! ? nodded Marjorie and Mary in unison.
Well, I think she is a snob! ? announced Wendy
decidedly.
A snob! Oh, no. Felicity is far from earning the
title of a snob. Why she?s a perfect dear! " Betty?s
voice was incredulous.


The three girls eyed the new-comer with puzzled eyes.
She looked a decent sort of kid, but she apparently had
some queer ideas.
"Anyway, here we are at the dear old House!?
Marjorie broke the strained silence. " Wait for Betsy
to dismiss us before you break rank Wendy! ?
Sharp on her words came the House-Captain?s order:
" House ?dis-miss! ?
They broke rank and Wendy surveyed the House that
was to be her home for the next three months. It was
well-named she decided. Low, and of the bungalow
type it was surrounded by beautiful old gum trees. An
avenue of them led up to the front entrance, interlacing
overhead. The House itself was delightful and truly
Australian. Built on the one level, it never-the-less
provided ample room for its forty girls, its House-
Mistress (Miss Durham), three other resident teachers
and its sketchy war-time domestic staff.
There were five attractive dormitories. The youngest
members of the House ?the First and Second Formers
?slept in the Fairy-Tale Dorm, so named for its frieze
of fairyland characters on the walls. The Thirds
occupied " Peter Pan and Wendy ? just opposite.
The Fourths took pride in " Robin Hood.? The
Remove, old enough to disdain such myths and legends,
loved the Floral Dorm, with its blue-bells and roses and
daffodils on the walls, harmonising delightfully with
the apple-green furnishings. The Fifth went all high-
brow with the nicest of the Shakespearean characters
depicted in their dormitory against a back-ground of
deep cream. The Sixth, of course, had their own
bed-sitting rooms two to a room, except Betsy
Liddicombe who lived alone in solitary state.


Marjorie, Mary and Betty escorted Wendy to the Floral
Dorm, and were gratified at her gasp of sheer delight.
" What a pretty room. I never expected anything as
lovely as this. Who else sleeps here? ?
" Four other girls ? said Mary showing Wendy her
cubicle with its cream furniture and green bedspread.
" The twins ?Pat and Pam Greenwood ?Joan Dansing
and Jennifer Peters. They?ll be up directly. Gay
Hillman is Dormitory Prefect. She?s in the Sixth.?
Gay put her nose in the door at that instant.
"Hallo kids! Good hols??
" Scrummy Gay! ? Gay was popular, even Wendy
liked her bright sunny face and breezy manner.
The prefect looked at Wendy quizzically. She too
had witnessed the little scene outside Main School and
was wondering just what sort of girl it was who was
brave enough to cheek the prefects on her first day.
" Wendy Murphy? ?
" Yes.? Wendy?s smile was winning and Gay drew
a breath of relief. She seemed all right now.
" Miss Durham would like to see all the new girls.
You?re the only one from this Dorm, so you had better
come down now.?
Wendy followed Gay to the House-Mistress? Study.
Gay tapped gently and a pleasant voice bade them enter.
" The new girl, Wendy Murphy, from the Floral Dorm.
Miss Durham.?
" Thank you Gay. Come in Wendy.? Miss Durham
was seated at her desk. She smiled pleasantly. Wendy
liked her immediately.
"Your first experience of boarding-school Wendy??


' Yes Miss Durham.?
" You?ll soon settle down. You have some nice com-
panions in the Floral Dorm. Have you met them yet? ?
" Three of them. Marjorie, Betty and Mary.?
" Oh yes, well the others will be there by now,? said
the Flouse-Mistress rising. " Remember you can
always come to me in any difficulty Wendy. A House-
Mistress tries to take the place of a mother at boarding
school, so never be afraid to confide in me will you? ?
" I should like to confide in you,? responded Wendy
shyly, and then the interview was over, but Wendy went
back to her Dorm, feeling that she had found a friend.
The other four girls were there when she arrived. The
twins, Pat and Pam, looked imps. Joan seemed quiet
but nice and Jennifer talked games all the time.
? I do hope you can play cricket Wendy, because we
are short of good cricketers in the ' Gums,? and we
want to have a go for the ' Inter-House Shield ? this
term.?
? Waratah?s sure to win that. Felicity?s a wizard at
cricket,? observed Marjorie.
At the mention of Felicity, Wendy turned away.
? That girl seems to run everything,? she said sourly
to herself.
And away in Waratah House, Felicity, who was rather
sensitive, pondered on the strange behaviour of the
new girl, to whom she had tried to be kind.
" Must be a temperamental sort of kid to fly out like
that over nothing. I?ll have to keep an eye on her.
She may find things a bit tough at first. Pity she is
not in Waratah. Betsy?s too dreamy really to indulge
in psycho-analysing new girls! ?


CHAPTER FOUR
A WEEK LATER
Winterton School.
Dear Mary,
I promised you I would write all about Winterton so
soon as I had settled down, so here goes.
I agree with you that the surroundings here are lovely,
and the buildings come up to your enthusiastic descrip-
tions. The Main School where we have all our lessons
and assemblies is very picturesque. I love that early
colonial style of place. The beauty of it is added to
by the creeper climbing right up to the roof.
Marjorie, the captain of my form, told me that the
main building was originally the home of an early
pioneer family who came to Australia in the early days
of the colony. This family, whose name was
"Winter? (hence Winterton), lost all their money
about twenty years after and it was then that the House
was turned into a school. Since then, of course, they
have built the four boarding houses which lie to the
west of the Main School and are all quite modern.
The playing-fields lie to the east and at the end of the
long drive near the big gates, is the Chapel. You
know all about that of course as you attended that
wedding there, but do you remember just how lovely
it is ?
I think the altar is exquisite and the stained glass
windows have an attraction for me as there is a little
story attached to each one. It appears that if a girl
adds lustre in any way to the name of Winterton, a
window is dedicated to her in the Chapel. At present


there are ten stained windows, but the most beautiful
of all of them is dedicated to a girl named Erica Winter
who apparently attended here many years ago. I?d love
to know what she did to deserve such a beautiful
window. Marjorie is going to tell me her story one
day ar i I'll let you know all about it.
Map ar* is very nice and so are most of the girls here,
but the lead Prefect comes up to my w r orst expectations.
She is a snob and very bossy. Unfortunately
all the other girls play up to her, especially the big ones.
I can only think that it is because she is the daughter of
Sir John Filmore-Danvers. He is a professor at the
University, and as most of the big girls are going on
there next year I suppose they feel it is wise to keep
in with Felicity (the H.P.). As for the younger girls,
they are led by Felicity?s younger sister, who is captain
of the Fourth.
If it wasn?t for this girl Felicity, I would admit to you
that I like Winterton very much, but it seems a pity
that such a grand school can be spoilt by the patronising
daughters of titled people.
Must write to Mummy now, so will say cheerio.
Lots of hugs,
from your friend,
WENDY MURPHY.
P.S. ?How are things at the High?
Wendy looked up from her letter as Marjorie came into
the room.
" Finished your letter Wendy? ?
? Yes, but I must write one to Mummy now.?
Marjorie fingered her racquet longingly.


? Must you write it now? Pat and Pam have bagged
the lawn court and we wanted you to make up a four.?
' Well . . . . ? Wendy looked undecided, " I suppose
I could leave it until tomorrow. I?ve only been here
a week and I?ve written one to Dad and one to Mummy,
so I suppose that?s pretty good.?
" More than I write in a month,? opined Marjorie with
a grin. '' Come on, get your racquet now and then
tomorrow you?ll be able to write and tell your mother
how you fare at tennis.?
" That?s a good idea,? nodded Wendy, putting her
writing case away in the cupboard with alacrity. "And
perhaps before I write tomorrow you will tell me the
story of Erica Winter and I can tell Mummy that.?
"Erica Winter? Oh the stained window in the
Chapel. 0.K.? said Marjorie good-naturedly. " I?ll
tell you tonight, but let?s go down to the courts now or
Pat and Pam will have found another couple.?
The twins were just on the point of inviting Betty and
Mary to play when Marjorie and Wendy arrived.
" Just in the nick of time! ? cried Pam as they hailed
her. " Pat was getting impatient.?
" I was not! It was you! ? retorted Pat indignantly.
"You called out to Mary to play! ?
"You called Betty first! ? said Pam.
" You suggested getting another couple! ? insisted Pat.
" But you were the first to get restless and say that
Marj. and Wendy were too jolly slow for words,? Pam
reminded her twin.
" Well, you
" Are you kids going to play on this court or argue
on it? ? demanded a lilting voice suddenly.


Pam turned quickly to see Felicity standing near, racquet
in hand.
" Because if it?s only to argue ?Margaret and I will
play on it whilst you argue elsewhere! ?
For answer Pat tossed for sides.
" We?re just going to start Felicity! ?
Felicity turned to Wendy with a smile.
" Are you playing too, Wendy? ?
*' Yes,? replied Wendy not very graciously.
" Then I?ll stay and watch your style,? decided the
elder girl.
To her amazement the astounding new girl threw her
racquet down.
"Then Til not play!? she announced, looking at
Felicity with an expression of unmistakable dislike.
Felicity stared unbelievingly.
" Whyever not? Not nervous are you? ?
" You see Wendy,? explained Marjorie hastily, ? Felicity
is tennis captain and she likes to watch the play of all
new girls, so there?s nothing to be nervous about.?
" Oh, I?m not nervous! ? Wendy picked up her racquet
reluctantly. " But I thought she just wanted a chance
to sneer at me! ?
" Sneer at you! ? Poor Felicity looked more bewildered
than ever. " Why should I want to do that? ?
Because you are Felicity Filmore-Danvers and I m
only plain Wendy Murphy I suppose! ? snapped Wendy
defensively.
"The kid is crazy! She?s ?she?s bats Felicity! Don t
worry about her! ? exclaimed Margaret Wainwright
breaking the stunned silence that followed Wendy?s
silly remark.


Felicity dimpled at Margaret?s downright exclamation
but her eyes as they surveyed Wendy showed a faint
glimmer of comprehension. The child seemed to have
a " snob ? complex if there was such a thing.
"Of course she?s not bats Margaret. She?s probably
a very good little tennis player. Let?s see what you
can do Wendy. Who are you playing with? ?
" Pat,? replied Wendy sulkily.
Well that should be a combination. Nip over to
the other side Marjorie and Wendy can serve to you.?
That first service evoked a whistle of admiration from
Margaret.
I say Felicity! You?ve got something there! That
kid can serve! ?
And as the game proceeded Felicity agreed enthusiasti-
cally. As the girls came off the court she smiled at
Wendy.
" It?s a long time since Fve seen tennis like that from a
junior. I must let your House-Captain know what a
find she has. If you practise there might be a possibility
of you playing for your House at the end of the term.?
Wendy was pleased despite herself and for the moment
she forgot that the praise was coming from the hated
Felicity.
Thanks. I love tennis. I played for the High for
the Departmental Cup last year.?
Felicity?s eyes opened wide.
Did you really? Then your standard must be high.
But you must practise hard if you wish to play for a
Winterton House Cup you know! ?
Somehow the last words nettled Wendy. Imbued as
she was with the idea that anything Felicity said was


intended patronisingly, her mouth assumed its, by now,
familiar tight expression.
" Oh, so you think the standard of a High School girl
cannot possibly be good enough for Winterton? ? she
asked aggressively.
"Not at all!? replied Felicity promptly. "But we
have some quite ' crack ? tennis players here and good as
you obviously are, you?ll need practice to compete
successfully against such people as Briony Marlowe and
Dot. McGay! ?
" Very sure of yourself aren?t you? ? impudently replied
Wendy, working herself into a frenzy. " Well let me
tell you . . . . ?
"Why Wendy!? broke in Felicity with a troubled
tremor, " you misunderstand me! ?
" I don?t think so,? replied Wendy, and, followed
reluctantly by her bewildered form-mates, she tramped
off the court.
Felicity looked at Margaret in despair.
" What do you make of her Margs? She worries me.?
Margaret was furious.
" I shouldn?t let a fourteen-year-old worry you Felicity.
She?s nothing but a cheeky little goat. How dare she
speak to you in that fashion! ?
Unfortunately Margaret?s words reached Wendy & Co.,
as they changed their shoes by the side of the court.
"There!? said Wendy to Marjorie as they walked
away. "There! That?s what they?re like those
those ?snobs! They think just because I?m Wendy
Murphy that I should mind my p?s and q?s even when
I speak to them! ?
" You know Wendy,? replied Marjorie thoughtfully,


" I think you?ve got the wrong idea.?
"Well don?t you think they are patronising? ? demanded
Wendy.
\ es, but it?s not because they are snobs. It?s only
because?well-after all they are prefects! Felicity
is Head Prefect and Margaret, Senior Prefect, so they
have every right to order us around a bit.?
Wendy digested this is silence for a moment.
"Who proposed Felicity for Head-Prefect? ? she wanted
to know.
The Head ?Miss Lethbridge! ? said Pat.
Why did she particularly propose Felicity? ?
Pam answered that.
' Why ? Oh because she was the most suitable person
I suppose.?
Wendy?s lip curled.
Suitable ?why? ? She held up her hand. " No,
don t answer, 111 tell you. She?s suitable because her
parents have plenty of money and influence!
Oh I say, that s a bit hot Wendy! ? protested Marjorie
quickly.
" Why??
' Well?that?s practically saying Miss Lethbridge is a
snob! ?
' Well?perhaps she is! ? returned Wendy defiantly.
The other three looked uncomfortable. Pat kicked a
stone viciously from the path.
" I don?t think you ought to say things like that Wendy.
After all you don?t know the Head very well yet ?and
well I?ve been here three years and I?ve always thought
she was an awfully decent sort.?
" She?s strict of course,? qualified Marjorie.


" And,? said Pam, slowly,? she is very fond of Felicity.
Has her to tea a lot. But then Felicity is H.P. and we
middles don?t see a lot of her.?
" Then,? said Wendy, "you can?t say whether she is a
snoh or not.?
" Can you? After only having spoken to her once in
a week! ? asked Marjorie with a touch of sarcasm.
Wendy flushed. She liked Marjorie and did not want
to lose her friendship. So, although her convictions
were as strong as ever, she, for once, kept her counsel.
"Oh well! I?m sorry if I?ve said the wrong thing.?
Marjorie squeezed her arm impulsively. She too, was
growing fond of Wendy despite that girl?s queer ideas.
Marjorie you see, had seen Wendy, when, away from
Felicity she was her own natural self. And that was
the Wendy Marjorie thought she would like for a
friend.
So at this evidence of Wendy?s temporary capitulation,
she squeezed her arm.
? Forget it old thing. We all get rattled at times.
You wait until you see me in a tear! ?
" I couldn?t imagine it Marj.! ? laughed Wendy. "You
seem too sane and sensible.?
" We are all pretty mild in the Remove,? reflected Pat
laughingly. " Pam and I have hitherto been the only
law-breakers, but I should say our reputation is going
to seem a tame one if you keep on as you have started
Wendy! ?


CHAPTER FIVE
THE STORY OF ERICA WINTER
After tea that day, the Remove settled down in their
sitting-room for a lazy evening. Being Saturday, there
was not any prep, to be done.
Marjorie and Wendy claimed the window seat.
"Tell me the story of Erica Winter and the window
in the Chapel,?? Wendy begged her companion.
Marjorie closed her book.
"Righto! I promised, didn?t I? Well now, let?s
see, where shall I start? ?
Wendy waited silently and Marjorie at last told her
the story of the window that had intrigued her ever
since she had come to the school.
" Erica Winter was a grand-daughter of the original
owners of Winterton. She came here when she was
about twelve years old. At that time Winterton School
had not the great reputation it has now ?rather the
reverse. I don?t know what was the cause of this
decline, but I acquired all my information from the
' Records of Winterton School,? that big book in the
Senior section of the library, and they merely state that
the school was at a very low ebb. Its numbers had
decreased to about thirty pupils and compared with our
attendance of four hundred that seems pretty ghastly.
According to the Records also, the Governors tried in
every way to rectify this state of affairs, by appointing
a succession of Principals, lowering the fees, etc., but
still people were not attracted to send their daughters
here. In my own words Wendy . . . . ? Marjorie


paused. "In my own words ?dry rot seemed to have
set in with a vengeance.?
Wendy nodded comprehendingly and Marjorie, leaning
her head back against the window, continued in her
low, clear young voice to tell the story of Erica Winter.
" Then Erica Winter came to Winterton. She came
for a sentimental reason ?because her father wished
his daughter to live in the old home of his pioneering
parents. From the very first day of her entry here
there seemed to be a better spirit in the school. The
little girl shared her father?s love of the home of her
ancestors and gradually her enthusiasm became infec-
tious. The other girls, instead of taking the old house
for granted, became proud of it too and it was due to
this early enthusiasm that Winterton has such lovely
gardens at the present time.
Previously to Erica?s arrival the grounds had become
a mass of weeds and neglect was apparent everywhere.
You see, the school could not afford a gardener
expenses were cut to the minimum. But under Erica?s
rallying the girls stirred themselves to lay out beds
of flowers and establish lawns in their spare time.
But despite all this, at the end of Erica?s four years
here, the attendance had fallen to a mere hand-ful and
one day, the Head-Mistress of that time, announced
that, due to lack of funds, the school would be closed
at the end of the term. The old House had been sold
to the wealthy owner of the daily newspaper (Mr.
Edgar Maine).
Erica was inconsolable. She had come to Winterton
prepared to love it as the home of her ancestors, but in
four years she had learned to love it as her school also.


During the last days of the term, she watched with
dismay, the belongings of Mr. Edgar Maine being
brought to the House. And on the last day of all,
Mr. Maine himself arrived accompanied by his two-
year-old grand-daughter. Erica saw them coming up
the drive and acting, probably on impulse, she inter-
cepted the new owner of Winterton and begged him
not to buy the school, explaining how she loved the
place for its associations as a home and school.
Of course it was not likely that Mr. Maine would agree
to the entreaties of a sixteen-year-old schoolgirl, and,
though he was probably quite kind to her, he disregarded
Erica?s request entirely.
The most poignant moment of all was when the girls
assembled for the last time in the grounds for an end-
of-term Service. This Service was held, by the way,
on that patch of ground where our Chapel now stands.
It was held in the open-air, probably because the house
itself was in the throes of removal.
By this time, Erica was the eldest girl in the School and
in the absence of the Head-Mistress, it is recorded that
she herself, arranged the Service. She erected a tiny
wooden altar amongst the trees and led the prayers.
It is also recorded that she prayed long and sincerely
that Winterton may, by some miracle, remain a school.
It must have seemed a forlorn hope at that time, for
shortly after the Service the girls were scattered far and
wide on their journeys home.
Erica travelled by train. As she took her seat in one
of the long compartments she was rather disgruntled
to find that her fellow occupants were none other than
the new owner of Winterton ?the redoubtable Mr.


Edgar Maine and his small grand-daughter. The child,
to all intents and purposes, was the light oï¿½ the old
man?s life.
As the train started, the little girl?s attention was
focussed on a small fox-terrier pup which had wandered
into the compartment. She fondled it rapturously,
watched by the doting eye of her grandfather. The
dog apparently put up with these overtures for a time
and then, tiring of so much attention, he wandered out
of the compartment to a small outside platform under-
neath which were the wheels of the train. The
carriages were joined together, as they are now, by two
parallel bars running at right angles to the wheels with
cross bars.
The little girl followed the dog to the platform and
swaying unsteadily and ignoring the calls of her grand-
father she resumed her fondling of the pup, who, tired
of it all, suddenly gave a terrific shake and moved
backwards. His hind legs slipped and to the horror
of Erica and Mr. Maine, he disappeared between the
two carriages dragging the baby with him!
Erica was the first to rush forward. She gave a shout
of relief to see both the child and the dog, not crushed
beneath the wheels but caught upon the parallel bars
above them. Mercifully, the child?s frock had caught
on a nail, thus hindering her fall, and the dog, with
the sure-footedness of animals, was swinging between
the two carriages with his front paws on the bar.
But there was no time to waste. At any moment the
child?s frock might tear away from the nail which
secured it for the present. Mr. Maine started forward,
but before he, in his agitation, could decide what action


to take, Erica was lowering herself nimbly from the
platform to the bar below!
There she balanced for a moment as the train swayed
and thundered over the rails. Slowly, precariously,
then, she bent over and made a grab at the child?s frock,
but a sudden lurch of the train almost sent her crashing
below to where the wheels assumed the appearance of
iron monsters waiting to grind her beneath them. With
a white face, and watched breathlessly by Mr. Maine
above, she straightened once more and regained her
balance. Then she did a dangerous thing. She gave
a jump (much like the one we do from the parallel
bars in the gym.) and grasped the place where her feet
had been before! She swung there for a moment, her
legs dangling and actually scraping against those awful
whirring wheels. Then she took a further risk.
Releasing one hand, she grabbed the child; there was
a rending as the frock tore from the nail and then
gradually, her muscles strained and taut, with one hand
Erica raised the heavy body out and upwards. It must
have been a tremendous strain ?like raising a two-stone
weight above your head with one hand ?but at last
Erica accomplished it and Mr. Maine was able to grasp
the little girl safely. He hurried her to the compart-
ment and then came back to endeavour to help Erica
up. She was still swinging on the bar but she took
no heed of his outstretched arms. Her attention was
concentrated now upon the terrified puppy.
The dog?s rescue was even more difficult to effect than
that of the child, for Erica?s hand slipped as she grasped
his collar and slowly, slowly, he too was raised upwards
and grasped by Mr. Maine.


Then, half fainting, Erica steeled herself for the effort
of raising herself within reach of Mr. Maine?s out-
stretched arms. With almost super-human strength,
she swung her legs upwards and with a dangerous
spring landed upright again upon the bar. Raising
her arms above her head she made a desperate grasp
at Mr. Maine?s hands, gripped them and was pulled,
her arms nearly stretching from their sockets to safety
at last!
Then she must have lost consciousness, for when she
next opened her eyes she was lying on the couch of
the station-master at the next station, where she
remained until she could be moved home.
Three days later Erica Winter had a visit from three
prominent people. They were Mr. Maine, of the
daily newspaper, a representative of the Society for the
Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the secretary of
the Royal Humane Society. These last two were later
instrumental in Erica being awarded silver medals for
bravery?and?Mr. Maine? Mr. Maine came to offer
Erica the freehold of ?yes ?the freehold of " Winter-
ton ? in return for the life of his little grand-daughter!
You see, he had remembered Erica?s plea on the last
day of the school term, that Winterton should remain
a school and this he guessed rightly, would be the best
way to show his gratitude. But he didn?t stop there.
He also endowed the school with a large sum of money,
and advertised it so well in his newspaper that when
the next year commenced, Winterton had quite a large
gathering of new students.
From that day the school never looked back. Year by
year the attendance increased and the finances flourished.


When an old scholar died and left money for the
building of a Chapel it was Erica (now an old scholar
herself) who begged that it should be built on the site
of the ground where, when the school had seemed
doomed, they had prayed for its restoration.
You see, Erica never believed that she had been respon-
sible for the restoration of the school. She always
vowed that the accident and its consequences was the
direct answer to her prayer offered up so anxiously at
that open-air, end-of-term Sendee.?
" So,? concluded Marjorie, her voice hoarse, " that,
Wendy, is the story of the stained glass window in
honour of Erica Winter. What are the words ? Eve
forgotten them for the moment.?
" I remember them,? replied Wendy quickly, her eyes
shining: ?
" In honour of Erica Winter, old scholar, who,
by her faith in God, and at extreme risk of her
life, recreated Winterton School.?
" That?s it,? nodded Marjorie, disentangling herself
from the window seat.
" What a pity,? remarked Wendy sombrely, " what a
pity Erica died.?
Marjorie paused in her descent from the window sill.
" Died! She did not die! ?
" But I thought . . . . ? began Wendy in surprise.
"Then you thought wrong!? retorted Marjorie.
" Erica Winter is still alive so far as we know!?
" Then where is she? How I?d love to meet her!
cried Wendy enthusiastically.
Marjorie shook her head.
*' No-one seems to know where Erica is now. The


records only say that she went to England after the
Chapel was built to study at Oxford, but beyond that
we don?t know what happened to her. But I?ve never
heard that she is dead.?
? Wouldn?t it be wonderful,? reflected Wendy, " if she
came back to Winterton in our time.?
Marjory agreed but looked doubtful.
? It would be marvellous of course, but I don?t suppose
that will happen.?
" It might! ? was Wendy?s optimistic answer as they
obeyed the summons of the bell for supper.


CHAPTER SIX
THE AMBULANCE FUND
At the time of Wendy Murphy?s entry to Winterton
School the Second World War had been in progress
for over three years. Despite the war talk on the radio,
in the newspapers, and on every hand however,
Australia, when compared with her own Mother
Country and the other nations, was really quite remote
from the larger exigencies of the strife. True, the
greater number of her sons and daughters had fought
and were fighting, had lost and Were losing, had won
and were winning in the the various war zones, but
still, Australia?s suffering could in no wise compare
with the suffering of say, captive Poland or even
England, who had seen the terror and destruction of
the Blitz. Rationing was in force in a small way ?
Australian people had lately been forced to curtail their
consumption of petrol, clothes and some food com-
modities, but when one considered that England had
had much more severe rationing for three long weary
years, and people in the occupied countries were actually
starving, these restrictions could be considered very
light.
Certainly Australian families had suffered heavily the
loss of many thousands of the flower of their manhood;
but except in the case of the farthermost northern
places their country itself had been left whole.
And at Winterton School, situated midst the sheltering
peacefulness of the hills, the War seemed a long way
off. The girls were reminded of the conflict and
suffering of the world in broadcasts, by the newspapers,


and by the fact that they spent a good deal of their
time knitting and collecting for the various Red Cross
functions, and in many of the forms there were girls
who waited anxiously for news of brothers or fathers
i i the Forces. Each morning in Chapel their chaplain
? who was also chaplain for four other Church Schools
besides attending to his own special parish) offered
up prayers for those serving on land, sea and in the air.
The " Amen ? was always loud and fervent in response
to this prayer. And once a month, this chaplain read
out, to a solemn, awed young congregation, the names
of the fathers, brothers and friends of Winterton School
who had paid the supreme sacrifice. At these times,
the Winterton girls forgot the petty squabbles of school-
life as they remembered the greater squabble that was
being fought with the blood-shed of Australian and
Allied men.
But out in the grounds with the sun shining brilliantly
overhead and the bush ablaze with the colours of
hovea, leschenaultia and golden wattle, the War was
hard to realise. Winterton girls had ample food,
comfortable beds at night, pretty uniforms to wear and
very little difference in their mode of living to pre-war
days, so it could not be wondered at that they took
their grand, free country and beautiful, spacious School
very much for granted.
Of course, there were some in the School who could
never forget. The form-mistress of the Remove was
one. Engaged to a successful, young architect at the
outbreak of war, her marriage had been postponed by
his enlistment six months later and twelve months after
that he had been reported killed in the Middle East.


Miss Carrington, bereft of that which she had held
most dear could never forget the misery and desolation
of war. Mademoiselle, the French mistress was
another. She never knew what became of her father
and brothers and sisters after France fell.
Herr Brendt was affected in quite a different manner.
Many parents refused to allow their daughters to study
his language these days, and the gentle little German
tutor who had spent three-quarters of his life in Austra-
lia, hardly made enough to exist and was viewed with
suspicion and distrust by almost everyone.
And then there was Miss Lethbridge, the Head-Mistress.
No one quite knew the facts of her case. All the girls
knew was that at the usual monthly service the name
of one, Hugh Lethbridge, had been read out amongst
those who had died for King and Country. They
didn t know who Hugh Lethbridge was, but everyone
assumed that it had been the Head?s brother, as her
father would have been too old for VCar Service.
Anyway it must have been someone very dear, surmised
the School, for that week Miss Lethbridge had been
absent from school and had returned looking for some
time, like a pale ghost.
A lot of the girls also had cause to remember that
outside of the peace and quietness of Winterton a
devastating destruction of mankind was in progress.
Ainslie Carruthers, a sweet-faced member of the Sixth,
lost her adored father?her only relation in the world.
Briony Marlowe, bright, breezy and cheerful became
introspective and listless after the report that her only
brother was killed in a raid over Berlin. Peter Marlowe
had been the mainstay of his mother and young sister


and now Briony must work hard to fit herself to help
support their delicate parent.
So these members of the School could never forget, but
mercifully, they were in the minority. A large number
of the girls, though anxious for relatives, had not yet
had the war so close to them, and life went on very
serenely on the whole.
When Marjorie told Wendy one day about Hugh
Lethbridge whose name had been read out last term,
Wendy was curious.
" Was it her brother? ?
" Must have been,? said Marjorie. "It could not have
been her father for he would be too old for service.?
" Didn?t she ever say who it was? ? persisted Wendy.
" Course not,? said Marjorie scornfully. " She
wouldn?t mention it. Why should she? Miss Leth-
bridge is not the sort to go round enlisting people?s
sympathy by telling them all about her private life.?
" No,? said Wendy half to herself, "she is a cold sort
of person.?
Marjorie looked annoyed.
" She?s not demonstrative if that is what you mean.
And thank goodness she?s not. I hate sob-stuff, but
she can be very kind. Ainslie Carruthers told her
best friend Helen Nicholson, who told her young sister
Denise, who told Dorothy McGay, who told me, that
when her father was killed Miss Lethbridge was just
marvellous! ?
? M-m,? said Wendy absently to this vast speech.
?M-m! Well I would like to know who Hugh
Lethbridge was.?


"Well you never will,? retorted Marjorie impatiently,
" so you had better forget it.?
Wendy did forget it in due course, but at that moment
she was rash enough to make a vow.
" I?ll find out before I leave Winterton who Hugh
Lethbridge was! ?
And although Marjorie scoffed at the time, she was to
remember those words in the future.
Meanwhile the feud between Wendy and Felicity
(which was entirely of Wendy?s own making) con-
tinued. Wendy had taken a strong dislike to the
Head-Prefect and nothing poor Felicity could say or do
would she condone. On every possible occasion,
whether in school or in the grounds she defied her and
not only defied her herself but, being the strongest
character in a form of rather mild girls, she led the
Remove to do likewise, until one day Felicity was forced
to use firmer methods than persuasion. It happened
like this: ?
Each term since the war began the Winterton girls had
set themselves the task of contributing some necessary
item in cash or commodity to the Red Cross. The
first term they had contributed four hundred pairs of
knitted socks. The next time it had been an enormous
parcel of pyjamas made by the girls themselves, and
every Christmas they sent a parcel of foodstuffs to as
many soldiers as there were girls in the school. In
addition they held a series of Paddy?s Markets, etc., to
raise funds to endeavour to provide an ambulance for
the Red Cross. Towards this last objective, they had
already made a very fair start this year and this term
they were hoping to add to it considerably.


One day therefore, somewhere around half-term, Felicity
called the girls together at recess-time to discuss ways
and means of raising more money.
" We have only seven more weeks to end of term,?
she announced, standing on the dais in Assembly Hall
and addressing the majority of the school.
" So far we have done very little this term, so if we
want to reach the total we have set ourselves we?ll
have to pull our socks up!?
" For the benefit of new girls, I will tell you again our
method of arranging these money-raising affairs. Any
girl who has an idea that may prove useful in assisting
us to raise money for the objective, is to come to my
study between the hours of five and six p.m. any night
and trot it out. So set your brains working girls, and
if your ideas are at all feasible they will be considered.?
The meeting broke up amongst much babble and
Marjorie turned to Wendy with a smile.
"Any ideas, Wendy? It?s about time the Remove
offered what Felicity calls a feasible suggestion, for
up to date, our form hasn?t been able to think of a
single thing. All we have done is to carry out the
ideas of other forms. But since you are new, perhaps
you can think of something fresh.?
Wendy pondered.
" I don?t know I?m sure. At the High School we
belonged to the Schools? Patriotic Fund of course, and
we used to collect papers and rubbish to be used for
cartridge containers and so forth.?
"And a jolly good job the S.P.F. have done, too!?
said Pat Greenwood approvingly.
" Still,? said Marjorie with a grin, " I can?t imagine


Miss Lethbridge allowing the boarders to go from house
to house collecting rubbish.?'
" Why not? ? said Wendy sharply.
" Well,? said Marjorie doubtfully, " I don?t exactly
know why, but I?m sure she wouldn^t.?
" Well she should,? announced Wendy. " She should
let us do whatever we can to help the war effort.?
" Still,? said Pam pacifically, for she recognised danger
signals in Wendy?s voice, ? That wouldn?t help us with
our ambulance. Rubbish goes to the factories to make
shell containers and things doesn?t it??
"Yes. But we could sell it to the factories,? said
Wendy, ? and give the money to the Ambulance Fund.?
" But would they buy it when they get it free from the
S.P.F.? ?
" They might.?
" You could present the idea to Felicity of course,?
said Marjorie doubtfully. " But I don?t think it would
be accepted.?
" As you say,? nodded Wendy, " I can present it to
Felicity and I will. It?s an idea that has worked all
right at the High School so why not at Winterton? ?
" But still, you didn?t sell the rubbish at the High
School,? persisted Pam. " Personally, I think it is a
stupid idea and . . . . ?
" Pam! Shut up! ? hissed her twin, as she and Marjorie
observed the danger signals in Wendy?s defiant face
once more. "Go ahead Wendy. Felicity may like
your idea.?
"I don?t think the Head will though!? murmured
Marjorie as the bell rang for lessons.
Wendy " went ahead ? that very evening.


At 5 p.m. she presented herself in the Head-Girl?s
study in Waratah House.
" I?ve come to present an idea for raising funds for the
Ambulance Fund! ? she announced without pre-amble,
when, in answer to her knock, Felicity bade her enter.
Felicity pulled a chair forward and smiled in a friendly
manner.
" Good. Take a pew and let?s hear it Wendy. You
are certainly quick off the mark. No one else has
come forward with anything yet.?
" I like to get things done,? observed Wendy doggedly
on the defensive with this girl she had decided to dis-
like so much.
?So do I,? nodded her enemy cheerfully. " And there
is every necessity for getting things done in this case.
We have only seven weeks of the term left in which
to achieve our total. We?ve set our hearts on present-
ing that ambulance this year. But let me hear your
suggestion.?
" Collecting rubbish,? said Wendy briefly.
Felicity raised her brows enquiringly.
" Collecting ?rubbish! ?
" Like the S.P.F. do,? added Wendy.
" But ?how will that raise money for the ambulance? ?
" The rubbish can be sold to the munition factories.?
*' But ?the S.P.F. don?t sell it do they? ?
" No?but Winterton could.?
"Oh . . . . ? Felicity hesitated. She was going
to say " Isn?t that rather silly? Selling something to
the Government and then using their money to buy them
something else? ? but the dogged defensiveness of the


new girl, who seemed to dislike her so, halted her.
Instead she inquired evenly:
" How do you propose collecting the rubbish Wendy? ?
" By house-to-house collection like the High School
girls do.?
Felicity shook her head slowly. Her voice was gentle.
" I?m afraid that would be impossible. I?m sorry
but
" Why is it impossible? ? burst out Wendy indignantly.
" Miss Lethbridge would never allow it,? explained
Felicity quietly.
" But why? ? Wendy thumped her fist down angrily
on the Head-Girl?s desk. " The High School girls do
it. Why can?t we??
" The High School girls are day-girls. It is a different
matter. As boarders we are under the Head?s super-
vision and I don?t think she would allow it.?
Wendy was seething.
? Pure snobbery that?s what it is! ? she shouted. " Just
because we are Winterton girls you and the precious
Head think it is below us to even help the war effort! ?
She rose. " Well see here Felicity Filmore-Danvers ?
the Remove aren?t snobs if the rest of the school are
and the Remove will collect rubbish from door-to-door
whatever you say! ?
Felicity?s grey eyes flashed at this piece of rudeness
from a very new girl.
' I forbid the Remove to do anything of the sort until
I have consulted Miss Lethbridge. If she thinks the
idea is all right you may go ahead. But understand
Wendy, you are not to instigate any house-to-house
collecting until the Head returns.?


" But Miss Lethbridge is away for the week-end! We
can?t waste all that time! ?
Felicity sighed but her voice was firm.
"I?m afraid you must.?
Wendy gave her one glance ?a glance full of dislike
and angry defiance. Then she turned on her heel
and without answering left the room slamming the
door behind her.
Felicity, alone, smiled wryly to herself.
" What a queer kid. I wonder why she dislikes me
so? It?s funny, but I?m sure I would like her ever so
much if only she would let me see her real self. She
must be a sport really or a decent kid like Marjorie
Millward would not have palled up with her so
quickly.?
After leaving Felicity?s room so precipitately Wendy
strode angrily through the already darkening grounds
to her own House. The members of the Floral Dorm,
were just changing their frocks for tea when she entered
and without hesitation announced firmly;
"I am going house-to-house collecting for rubbish
tomorrow! ?
Marjorie, after a short amazed silence danced a jig of
delight.
" Then Felicity accepted the idea Wendy? But of
course she must have or you wouldn?t be going! ?
" I say! What a jolly wheeze! ? cried the twins in
unison. "May we all come? Did Felicity say all
of us? ?
" She didn?t say,? confessed Wendy honestly. " But
. . . . ? defiantly. " I suppose you can if you want
to. I?m going! ?


" Let?s all go! ? exclaimed Marjorie jubilantly. " All
of us in this dorm, anyway! ?
"Go where?? Jennifer, Joan and Betty looked
puzzled.
Pat and Pam told them of Wendy?s plan amidst inter-
ruptions from the enthusiastic Marjorie. Only Wendy
remained silent wondering already if she ought to drag
these girls into the affair.
" Do you really mean we are allowed to go though? ?
asked Jennifer in amazement.
" I shouldn?t have thought Miss Lethbridge would
consider such an idea for a moment,? murmured quiet
Joan Dansing thoughtfully.
"You have been to Felicity I suppose? ? said Betty with
a frown.
" I?ve been to Felicity all right,? answered Wendy with
a wry smile as she remembered what her reception had
been.
"Oh well!? Betty grinned. "That?s O.K. If
Felicity says it?s all right it is. I?d love to come! ?
" Me too! ? enthused Jennifer gaily.
" What about you Joan? ? asked Marjorie.
Joan seemed to hesitate a bit, but at last she agreed, if
a little doubtfully. " I suppose I will. If you are
sure it?s all right.?
" Course it?s all right,? scoffed Pat impatiently. "If
Wendy has got Felicity?s permission.?
" Joan never breaks rules,? explained Pam in an aside
to Wendy. " She?s here on a scholarship you know
and feels she oughtn?t to or something.?
Wendy felt troubled. She was about to confess there
and then that she had not obtained the required per-


mission for her plan from the H.P. She had no desire
to get Joan or any of these nice girls into trouble really
but already Marjorie was making plans and the moment
for confession passed.
" Let?s keep it an absolute secret from the others,?
Marjorie Was saying gleefully. " They never tell us
their plans and they?ll be green with envy when we
present a bumping cheque to the Fund.?
" They?ll be green with envy,? echoed Pat, " when they
find out what fun we?ve had getting the cheque! ?
" When do you propose to start? ? Joan asked.
" Tomorrow! ? said Marjorie. " It?s Saturday. We
can start straight after brekker.?
"We can start at the nearest houses and work on
towards the town,? added Pat.
Wendy turned sharply.
"No, let?s start right away from the School!
"Why??
"Oh . . . . ? Wendy shuffled. " Oh ?so that
the others don?t realise what we are doing. If we
all start so near Winterton some of them are sure to
see us and our secret will be known.?
" That?s true,? agreed Marjorie. "We want to keep
it a secret so long as possible.?
" Won?t Felicity let the cat out of the bag though? ?
asked Jennifer.
" Oh, she?ll be too absorbed in the other plans to worry
about us,? surmised Pam blithely.
" What shall we collect the rubbish in? ? asked Betty.
" I don?t know. What did you use to collect it in for
the S.P.F. Wendy? ? asked Marjorie.
" Wheel-barrows.? Wendy was feeling very guilty


as the plans went ahead apace. Slowly her courage to
confess that she had not got permission for her plan
was ebbing from her.
"We can use the gardener?s barrow then,? said Pat.
" I bags to wheel! ?
" We?ll take turns! ?
" Wendy can knock at the doors ?cause she?s done it
before! ?
" And the rest of us can help collect it all together.?
They were all very enthusiastic except Wendy. She
listened glumly to their chatter wondering how it would
all end.


CHAPTER SEVEN
THE RAG AND BONE MERCHANTS
The next morning, Saturday, the members of the Floral
Dormitory were very hasty in their bed-making after
breakfast. Everyone, including Wendy, who had
suppressed her conscience somewhat, and Joan, who
had decided in the general excitement that she had been
unduly pessimistic, were eager to complete their daily
tasks in the dorm., and start on the unusual adventure
of house-to-house collection.
The " Rag and Bone ? merchants they styled themselves,
and to the accompaniment of gay chatter the beds were
pulled up unceremoniously, and mattresses left unturned
showed such disgraceful bulges that even Gay Hillman
the Dorm. Prefect, easy-going though she invariably
was, protested forcibly.
"What a disgraceful dormitory! I really can?t let
you kids get away with this. Whatever would Matron
say? ? Gay walked briskly round the room re-stripping
the eight beds systematically.
" Now, set to work at once and remake them! ?
' But Gay! ? protested Pam in an injured voice.
" We are in a terrible hurry! ? said her twin.
" Then you?d better start remaking your beds imme-
diately! ? said Gay imperturbably slipping the last sheet
from Jennifer?s bed. " Good heavens Jennifer! What-
ever is this in your bed? ?
"A tennis ball! ? said Jennifer humbly.
"I?m not blind!? snapped the prefect sarcastically.
" No wonder Felicity is always wondering where the


balls disappear to. I suppose it is school property
Jennifer? ?
" Yes,? said Jennifer sheepishly. " I meant to return
it last Wednesday morning and then I lost it. It must
have got caught up in the bed-clothes when I made my
bed.?
" When you made your bed ?when? ?
" On Wednesday,? said Jennifer.
Gay?s mouth twitched but her voice was stern.
? Do you mean to say that you have not stripped your
bed since Wednesday? ?
Jennifer looked startled. Pam rushed to the rescue,
after a quick interrogating glance from the other girls.
" It?s not only Jennifer, Gay. None of us have made
our beds properly since Wednesday. We all make them
Wednesdays and Sundays because those are the clean-
linen days ?but the other days we just pull them up
and they are quite comfortable! ?
" I?m glad they?re comfortable! ? observed Gay trying
hard to keep a grave face. " But I hardly think you
would all feel comfortable if I reported this to Matron! ?
" O, but you won?t Gay! ? implored eight anxious
voices.
" I will! ? said Gay, "if it occurs again. In future I
shall inspect your beds very closely each morning.?
" Oh! ? groaned eight resigned voices as they set about
making the beds now. Gay stood over them grimly
until each bed was made to her satisfaction.
At last the Dormitory was finished. Gay departed with
a jolly smile and by ten o?clock the girls of the Floral
Dorm, were ready for business.
The twins, after much cajoling, obtained the loan of the


gardener?s wheel-barrow and as pre-arranged, the other
six met them and their vehicle at the small, un-used
gate in a deserted corner of the grounds. Wendy
especially, had been anxious to ensure that they were
unobserved as they left the school.
Jennifer clamoured to start their collection at the very
first house, but Wendy and Marjorie, after a slight
argument persuaded her to have patience until they
reached the opposite side of the town.
Many curious glances were cast at them as they trundled
through the main street. The townspeople were not in
the habit of seeing girls clad in the Winterton uniform
pushing a wheel-barrow along.
But at last the very last house of all was reached and
the girls looked expectantly at Wendy.
"Go on Wendy. In you go! ?
Wendy seemed a bit doubtful so Marjorie stepped
forward.
Come on old thing. 111 come with you. The others
can wait here with the barrow.?
" No, we?d better come too,? said Jennifer, taking charge
of the barrow. Come on you kids. Give me a hand
with this thing across the lawn.?
Wendy and Marjorie went ahead across the smooth
turf to the back of the house while the twins, with Betty,
Mary, Jennifer and Joan followed with the rattling
barrow. It took a bit of pushing across that lawn. The
wheels seemed to stick much more than they had on
the road. And after all there was no need for Wendy
to knock. The rattling of the barrow brought the
mistress of the house to the door.


She disregarded Wendy?s tentative: " Have you any
rubbish to help the war effort . . . .?? The lady?s
eyes were riveted on the barrow-pushing coterie.
? What are you doing to my lawn ? How dare you push
that great thing across it! Just look at the way the
wheels have broken down my border! ?
She strode forward indignantly.
" Winterton girls too! Upon my word I?ll notify your
Head-Mistress of this ?this ? vandalism! ?
"We are collecting rubbish for the war effort
began Wendy again, only to be stopped by a further
tirade from the woman.
"Take that barrow off my lawn!? She advanced
threateningly towards the twins who backed hurriedly
away.
"I think we had better go!? said Joan nervously
retreating too.
" Yes you had! ? stormed the woman angrily. " But
not before I have your names.?
Marjorie stepped forward.
"We are from Winterton School!? she explained
pacifically. " And we are collecting rubbish for the war
effort! ?
For the first time the owner of the house removed her
eyes from her desecrated lawn. She stared at Marjorie.
"Well you?ll get no rubbish here after this ?war effort
or no war effort! Now ?get off my premises imme-
diately! What is your name? ?
" Marjorie Millward.?
" I?ll remember that. Miss Lethbridge shall hear of
this I warn you! ?
Wendy paled.


" Let us pay for the damage! ? she entreated. ? But
please don?t report us to Miss Lethbridge.?
The other girls looked at her curiously.
" But, although the Head will probably row us for the
damage to the lawn it won?t be too bad Wendy, because
after all we have got permission to collect rubbish.?
" Yes. Yes, I know! ? Wendy hastened to agree.
" But the Head will be wild over the lawn! ?
" I should hope she would! ? agreed the owner of the
lawn grimly. " I can?t understand the Principal of
Winterton allowing you to collect rubbish at all as a
matter of fact! She knows that the State School children
have that monopoly here, and at least they have the sense
to leave the barrow outside instead of damaging people?s
property as you Winterton girls have done! ?
" But . . . . ? began Mary Annandale soothingly.
"No buts at all! I shall report you all! ? vowed the
indignant woman giving the barrow a vicious push out
the gate and ushering the girls out after it. " Now be
off with you! ? And after a final regretful glance at
her beloved lawn she disappeared into the house.
The girls surveyed each other gloomily.
' What a rotten start to our collection campaign! ?
? I think we had better go back to school,? said Wendy
nervously.
"And confess to Felicity that we have failed to collect
a single thing! ? scoffed Marjorie. "I should have
thought that was the last thing you would want to do
Wendy! ?
But Wendy was feeling conscience stricken.
" I still think we?d better give it up! ? she reiterated
dismally.


Joan would have agreed but the others scoffed whole-
heartedly.
" You two can if you like,? said Pat, " but wer?e nort so
easily put off. I?m going to every house in this street
and if I don?t fill this barrow before lunch I?ll ?
? Eat my hat! ? finished her twin.
" Hear! Hear! ? said Jennifer and Marjorie. Mary
and Betty followed suit.
Wendy and Joan followed nervously as the twins put
their plan into execution. After the first catastrophe,
they took care to leave the barrow in the road as they
went from house to house. And after that first bad
beginning, they were, on the whole, received fairly well
by the house-holders. Some, it is true, refrained from
adding their quota of rubbish, giving the reason that
they always kept it for the State School children, but
nevertheless when they reached the small gate once
more, the twins had realised their objective. The barrow
was full of a miscellaneous collection of old rags, old
saucepans, old books, etc.
" That?s about all we can manage I think,? announced
Mary as she stuffed a bundle of rags down the side.
" We?d better be getting back to school.?
" Jiminy, yes!? exclaimed Jennifer, glancing at her
watch. " It?s twelve o?clock. Only an half an hour to
lunch.?
" We?ve done pretty well I think . . . . ? began Pam
gleefully, when a loud voice sounded from behind them.
" Exactly what have you done well you kids? ?
Margaret Wainwright, the Senior Prefect, strode up to
them.


Wendy gasped! The twins turned cheerfully.
" Hallo Margaret! Look at all the rubbish we have
collected for the Ambulance Fund! ?
Margaret looked at the loaded barrow with a puzzled
frown.
" Where did you get all this junk? ?
" By house-to-house collection,? replied Mary proudly.
" Don?t you think we have done Well for a first effort? ?
But Margaret disregarded the question.
" Who gave you permission to do this? ? Her voice was
its very sternest and her dark eyes looked serious.
" Felicity gave Wendy permission and we all joined
in,? said Marjorie, feeling comfortably aware that for
once they were not breaking rules.
Wendy remained in the background silently nibbling
her finger-nails, until Margaret swung round fixing her
compelling gaze upon her.
" When did Felicity give you permission to go round
collecting rubbish Wendy? ?
Wendy hesitated.
" I ?l went to her with the idea ?to help the Ambulance
Fund.?
Margaret raised her brows still higher.
"And Felicity agreed? ? she asked incredulously.
No answer. Wendy stared uncomfortably at her toes
while her form-mates waited for her answer.
Margaret looked impatient.
" Well. Just when did Felicity agree to this campaign
Wendy? lam curious because you see she told me only
last night of your plan and her refusal of it until Miss
Lethbridge returned. It seAns queer that she should
have changed her mind so quickly.?


No answer. Wendy still examined the tips of her brown
brogues and the colour slowly mounted in her cheeks.
Marjorie, after one puzzled look at her friend answered
for her.
" Felicity gave Wendy permission last night Margaret.
I know, because we were all rather amazed about it.?
" But it?s been good fun,? chimed in Pat enthusiastically.
" Except for the first part,? added Pam, but broke off
with an exclamation ?" Wow! , . . . ?as her twin
trod heavily on her foot.
" Shut up Pam! That?ll come out soon enough! ?
Margaret was still waiting for Wendy to speak and
fortunately did not hear these asides.
" Did Felicity give you permission Wendy? ?
In face of such a straight-forward question Wendy had
to reply.
" No.?
Her form-mates surveyed her with alarm.
" But Wendy! ? cried Joan Dansing nervously, "you
said . . . . ?
'' I didn?t. You all thought I said I had permission.?
"And you didn?t. And you let us break rules without
knowing it? ? cried Marjorie askance.
" It?s half-past twelve. We?ll be late for lunch,? said
Margaret then. Grimly she took one handle of the
wheel-barrow. " Take the other side please Jennifer.
We?ll dump all this just inside the grounds.?
Jennifer obeyed dumbly and then the sad little pro-
cession followed the Senior Prefect towards the School.
Wendy avoided the accusing and rather scornful glances
of her companions. She was feeling bitterly ashamed
of having drawn them into this row.


Marjorie was puzzled and at the moment a little dis-
appointed in her friend.
Pat and Pam, impulsive always, were raging. It was
all very well to go into scrapes willingly but to be landed
into a mess like this .... well!
Mary, Betty and Jennifer were quite bewildered and
Joan ?Wendy could not look at Joan ?Joan, who never
broke rules and who took very seriously the fact that
she was at Winterton on a scholarship and was expected
to behave.
Arrived at the gate of Wattle House of which Margaret
was captain, the Senior Prefect addressed them.
" You?ll be late for lunch. You can tell your House-
Mistress I detained you. After lunch you will report to
the Prefects? Room in the Main School. Be there at
2.30 sharp! ?
The crestfallen 'Tag and bone? merchants hurried
towards their House and belated lunch. There was no
time before the meal or during it for anything but
accusing, puzzled or angry glances in Wendy?s direction,
but when the meal was over the storm broke.
" I think it was beastly of you . . . . ! ? began Pat.
" To let us think you had permission . . . . ! ? raged
Pam.
" When all the time it was only spite against Felicity
....!? continued Pat.
" Whom you happen to dislike .... ! ? remarked
Jennifer angrily.
" And now we are all in a beastly row ... . ! ? went
on Pam.
"And we?ll be reported to the Head ....!? stamped
her twin.


"We would have been reported to the Head in any
case,?? Marjorie reminded them quietly. " That woman
at the first house said she would report us about the mess
we made of her lawn.?
? Do you think there will be much of a row? ? asked
Joan nervously.
Wendy spoke for the first time in this tirade.
" No. You won?t Joan, so don?t worry! I will probably
be expelled or something but the rest of you may as
well calm yourselves because as you have not done any-
thing wrong you can?t be blamed! ? Her lip curled a
little.
" But we were all in it! ? objected Betty quickly.
" Unwittingly. You thought you had permission. Oh
never fear . . . . ? Wendy gave a hard laugh. " I?ll do
the right thing and own up to the fact that it was all
my doing.?
' What will you say? ? asked Marjorie curiously, her
expression softening,
"Say?? Wendy laughed again. "Why, I?ll say that
I was furious at Felicity Filmore-Danvers being so auto-
cratic and I determined not to obey her! ?
" Why do you dislike Felicity so Wendy? ? asked Mary
wonderingly. She, herself was a staunch admirer of the
Head-Prefect.
" Because she?s a patronising snob! ? flared Wendy.
" Another thing. I?ll tell you all, I?ll do the same thing
again, but next time, I?ll do it on my own. But I will
not be dictated to by Felicity Filmore-Danvers! ?
Silence greeted this outburst. A few seconds later
Marjorie remarked non-committally: ?
" It?s time we went over to the P.R. Let?s get it over.?


CHAPTER EIGHT
AN INTERVIEW WITH MISS LETHBRIDGE
Marjorie knocked softly on the door marked in white
letters ?PREFECTS? ROOM. Felicity Filmore-Danvers?
low voice bade them enter.
" Come in.
They stood in a group just inside the door; Marjorie
and Wendy to the fore; the smooth black heads of the
twins bobbing out on either side; Jennifer and Mary
and Betty in a bunch; and Joan, pale and nervous in
the rear.
Three of the school prefects surveyed them from the
farther side of the wide polished table; Felicity the
Head-Prefect, immaculate, poised and calm in the
centre; Margaret, Senior Prefect, dark eyes framed by
long black shining hair, looking grim; Betsy Liddi-
combe, Captain of the " Gums House,? rueful and
accusing.
Felicity motioned the culprits forward.
" Margaret reports that, despite my express refusal of
your plan to aid the Ambulance Fund, all eight of you
this morning flagrantly disobeyed the injunction and
went from house-to-house collecting rubbish in the town
this morning.?
Wendy stepped forward immediately, head high,
defiant.
" I was the only one who disobeyed your order Felicity.
The others were under the impression that you had given
me permission.?
'And you let them accompany you Wendy, without so


much as warning them that they were breaking rules? ?
asked Betsy in astonishment.
Well . . . . I couldn?t do the job on my own! ?
retorted Wendy defensively.
"Why go at all ? It seems so silly to deliberately disobey.
Surely you realised that you must be found out when
you brought the rubbish back? ? Felicity?s voice was as
quiet as ever.
That quietness irritated Wendy. If Felicity had stormed
as Margaret often did, it wouldn?t have been so bad,
but the Head Prefect?s very composure stirred Wendy
up to boiling point.
Yes, I realised all that. If you want to know Felicity
Filmore-Danvers, I?ll tell you! I went, for the simple
reason that you told me not to! And I?ll act in the same
manner every time you give me an order! I?ll not be
dictated to by?a?a?self-opinionated snob like you ?
so ?so ?there! ?
She broke off breathlessly, the two angry spots of colour
in her cheeks, gradually fading, leaving them deathly-
pale as she encountered the still quiet, but now pene-
trating gaze of Felicity?s grey eyes. Her own eyes
dropped before them.
There was a stunned silence after this outburst. The
seven junior girls looked startled and quite horrified.
As Winterton prefects were looked up to nearly as much
as mistresses. Never before had they heard such a
tirade.
Betsy Liddicombe looked fearfully and half apologeti-
cally at Felicity. Was it her fault that these eight girls
were so rebellious? Had she failed again in her duties
as House Captain ? She knew she wasn?t so good at her


job as Felicity or Margaret or even Helen Nicholson of
the Banksias, but when she wasn?t dreaming of rapturous
music she did try. Betsy sighed.
Margaret looked menacing. It was she who broke the
silence.
" How dare you Wendy Murphy! How dare you insult
Felicity like that. You ?you . . . . ! ?
Margaret?s voice faded away as Felicity put a restrain-
ing hand on her arm.
" Just a moment Margaret.? She scribbled busily on a
slip of paper. Then fixing those penetrating grey eyes
upon Wendy once more she spoke quietly and decisively.
" I take it then, that you assume all the blame for this
affair Wendy? ?
" Yes.? Wendy shrugged her shoulders.
" Then,? Felicity nodded to the other juniors. " The
rest of you may go.?
"I?m willing to take my share Felicity!? gulped
Marjorie.
" You haven?t got a share Marjorie,? smiled Felicity
gently. " Please go all of you. You, Wendy, will take
this Report Slip to Miss Lethbridge. She has returned
to school sooner than we expected. As you refuse to
recognise my authority, my only alternative is to pass
the matter into higher hands! ?
She rose ?majestically dignified. Her face was pale as
she handed the folded slip to Wendy who received it
automatically.
" Thank you. I think that is all! ?
Almost unconsciously Wendy found herself obeying the
order of dismissal that the Captain?s last words held
and she found herself outside the Prefects? door,


"Oh but
" And, what is more I am not going to take this bit
of
paper to Miss Lethbridge! ?
You 11 have to! ? gasped Betty, her eyes goggling.
' It?s Felicity?s orders! ? ejaculated Mary.
Yes, nodded Wendy, her lips tightening. " That
is
why I .... ? (tear . . ) "am (tear .
?)
" tearing (tear . tear . . ) "this scrap
of
surrounded by the scandalised, but now commiserating
eyes of her form-mates.
" W-Whew! You poor kid! A report to the Head is no
joke at Winterton . . , . ? began Pat.
Marjorie gave a warning gesture.
" Don?t talk about it here Pat! The pres, will be coming
out soon. Let?s go over to the House.?
Wendy followed them dazedly into the open air?the
report slip clutched tightly in one hand. Out in the
quadrangle Marjorie touched her arm.
' You?ll have to go you know Wendy. Best get it over.?
' Whatever made you go off the deep end like that? ?
asked Pam, who could hardly believe even now that she
had actually heard a junior tell off the Head-Prefect of
Winterton so thoroughly.
" Shut up Pam! ? said Marjorie brusquely. " Wendy
lost her temper but she?s sorry now and it?s no use
rubbing it in.?
Wendy?s head came up with a jerk from the perusal of
Felicity s report slip and this time it was Marjorie who
received the full glare of her once more smouldering
eyes.
" I?m not sorry! ?
Marjorie blinked.


paper into shreds! ? The report slip lay in small pieces
at her feet.
"Oh . . . !? Jennifer looked aghast .... "Oh!
Wendy! ?
"You idiot Wendy!" cried Marjorie in distress.
" There?ll be a worse row for you now! ?
Wendy disregarded their angry amazed ejaculations.
" I said I wouldn?t obey Felicity Filmore-Danvers and I
won?t! That?s what I think of her report slip and I will
do the same with her verbal orders. I won?t report to
Miss Lethbridge
"I think you will Wendy Murphy right at this
instant! ?
Eight heads turned swiftly at the sound of that icy voice
and looking upwards their horror-stricken eyes en-
countered the grey head of their Head-Mistress
protruding from one of the windows.
" I will be with you in a few minutes Wendy and we
will cross over to my study. The rest of you may
disperse! ?
Marjorie & Co. relaxed somewhat as the Principal shut
the window.
"Gosh! Let?s bunk!? said Jennifer in alarm. "The
Plead does look grim! ?
Marjorie gave Wendy?s arm a parting squeeze of
sympathy.
" Bad luck old girl. But do keep your temper this time."
She half expected another tirade then but Wendy?s
temper had been thoroughly douched by the iciness of
Miss Lethbridge?s voice and she smiled wryly.
" I?ll try Marj. And ?and thanks."


At that moment the figure of the Head-Mistress
appeared in the quadrangle and Marjorie sped away.
" Come me Wendy! ? Miss Lethbridge swept
majestically forward. Wendy followed in trepidation.
What would happen now?
In the big study with its thick carpet and diamond-paned
windows the Head-Mistress of Winterton seated herself
at the wide polished desk and commenced to enter some
notes in the big School Register.
Wendy stood first on one foot then on the other, her
eyes fixed anxiously on the bent grey head, which, after
five agonising minutes was raised. Two grey eyes seemed
to bore straight through her own brown ones.
I was standing in the library just now when I over-
heard you, Wendy Murphy, a junior and a new girl
this term, make some alarming statements. Did my ears
deceive me or did I hear you say that you refused to
recognise at any time the authority of the Head-Prefect
of this School ? ?
I did say that! admitted Wendy staring now at the
floor. Never would she forget the pattern of the carpet
in the Head?s room.
' Did you mean it? ? persisted the icy voice.
" Yes ?at the time.?
' Why? ? sharply.
" I ?l don?t know! ? lamely.
" Come ?you must have a reason.? Miss Lethbridge
spoke impatiently, but as Wendy did not volunteer any
further explanation she spoke again.
"We will leave that aspect of the matter for the
moment. Am I to understand that Felicity issued you
with a report slip for me? ?


Wendy gulped.
" Yes.?
" Yes ?Miss Lethbridge ?if you please Wendy! ? "Am
I also to understand that you destroyed that missive? ?
" Yes ?Miss Lethbridge.?
? Why??
" I ?l said I wouldn?t take ?any orders ?from Felicity.
That is why I tore it up.? Wendy was almost in tears.
? I see.? Miss Lethbridge?s long, white fingers beat a
thoughtful tattoo on the desk. Her next question was
unexpected.
"Are you aware Wendy, that it is a crime to destroy
other people?s correspondence? ?
Wendy looked startled.
? But ?it wasn?t a letter Miss Lethbridge! ?
" It was in the nature of one,? replied the Head.
"And you Wendy, were in the nature of a postman.
What would be the state of the country if the postmen
opened any letters they were interested in and destroyed
some of them? ?
Wendy did not answer. She was feeling rather ashamed.
? It was not an honourable thing to do was it Wendy? ?
" No, Miss Lethbridge. I never thought of it that way.?
Miss Lethtbridge softened as she looked at the tear-
filled brown eyes.
" You must learn to think of these things Wendy,? she
said gently. " Draw that armchair up child and sit down.
I want to talk to you.?
Wendy sank into the proffered chair and then her tears
broke loose. The Head waited patiently until the sobs
ceased somewhat.


" Wendy I wish to know the contents of that report
slip please! ?
Haltingly Wendy told her. How she had disobeyed
Felicity?s order about the rubbish collection and had
not only disobeyed herself but caused her seven com-
panions to disobey also. How Margaret had caught
them and reported the matter to the Head-Girl and of
Felicity?s ultimatum.
" So you were the girl responsible for a certain Mrs.
Brown ringing me this afternoon to complain that some
girls in Winterton uniform had damaged her lawn with
a wheel-barrow? ?
Yes Miss Lethbridge ?the others were not to blame.?
"So I realise now. I am glad that at least you are
willing to take the full responsibility. But ?tell me ?
don?t you think it was rather a mean thing to do in the
first place to allow seven of your companions to
unknowingly join in what was a punishable escapade? ?
" Yes Miss Lethbridge.?
" But you were bent on flouting Felicity?s orders? ?
Wendy nodded miserably.
"Why?? Surely you realise that the prefects are
appointed to act as a sort of government in a school?
Again let me make a comparison. If the Prime Minister
(who by the consent of the King is the head of our
Government in Australia) issued an order and the
people disregarded his order as worthless ?what do
you think Would be the state of our Commonwealth? ?
" Chaos! ? replied Wendy intelligently enough. " But,
Miss Lethbridge, the people of Australia vote for the
Prime Minister. True the King agrees to the choice ?
but the people by their votes choose him! ?


Miss Lethbridge?s lips twitched. She saw the insinua-
tion.
" All people over 21 are entitled to a vote Wendy.
Minors are exempt as not possessing the necdssary
knowledge of who is best for them.?
' But we are all under 21 at Winterton! ? protested
Wendy.
The Head smiled again.
" Granted. But then, Winterton is only a miniature
Australia isn?t it? ?
" I suppose so.?
? The lowest age you can vote at Winterton is fifteen.
Also, you must have attended the school for three terms
before you are entitled to vote for the Head-Prefect.?
" Then the H.P. is elected by vote? ? asked Wendy in
surprise.
The Head nodded.
" Yes. When, for instance, Felicity leaves the School,
every girl of fifteen and over who has attended Winter-
ton for three terms or more, will present a vote to me
for the new Head-Girl. If I approve of the choice (and
I usually do) the girl with the highest percentage
becomes Captain of the School. Incidentally, her House
becomes the leading House.?
" It?s just like a real poll! ? enthused Wendy in delight.
Then her face fell.
*' Then Felicity was elected by vote? ?
" Felicity won the poll by forty votes out of ninety.
Margaret Wainwright Was the second choice with thirty
votes so she became Senior Prefect.?
A thought intruded itself into Wendy?s mind. Her
brow darkened ominously.


' Why is Felicity so popular? ?
The Principal looked surprised.
" Why ? It is hard to define why a girl is popular Wendy
but .... ? r 7 ?
But,? interposed Wendy sarcastically and rather
rudely, but after all, she is Felicity Filmore-Danvers
and her father is the eminent Sir John ?and
She paused when, at this juncture, the Head rapped
sharply on her desk.
" Stop! What are you insinuating you silly little girl?
Are you trying to tell me that my school? my school
mind you ?is composed of nothing but that loathsome
section of society known as snobs? ?
" Well ? ? ? ? ? Vaguely Wendy wondered why Miss
Lethbridge had laid such stress on the fact that it was
her school. After all, she was only the Principal
appointed by the Governors. " Well
" Are you in fact intimating that I myself, who finally
decides upon the Head-Prefect am a snob? ?
"Well
Because if it is so you are the most disloyal member
of Winterton I have ever had to deal with. Understand
Wendy, mis-comprehension I can realise; insubordina-
tion such as you have shown today often occurs; but I
will not contend with dis-loyalty! ?
" But, Miss Lethbridge . . . . ! ?
You know of course the name given to people who
are disloyal to their country? ?
Traitors, murmured Wendy, shame-faced.
In this war we call them ?Quislings or Fifth Column-
ists.?


" But I?m not that Miss Lethbridge! ? Wendy looked
so horrified that the Head?s anger subsided.
"There! I never said you were my dear. But you must
see the comparison in this little World oï¿½ School.?
Wendy gulped.
"I I think I do Miss Lethbridge and and I?m
sorry.
The Head-Mistress, leaning forward patted her pupil?s
hand consolingly.
" Now run away child and forget all your ... . ? she
laughed quite merrily ?"your 'bolshie? ideas.?
Wendy smiled ruefully as she rose.
" I suppose I do sound like a 'bolshie?.?
The Head smiled again and Wendy, looking at her
hardly recognised in that merry face, the usually stern
and sometimes rather sad-looking Head of Winterton.
" I?ll try to improve Miss Lethbridge.?
"Of course,? laughed the Head. " Now run away. I
will let you off a punishment. I think perhaps my lecture
will do you more good than all the lines or other
punishments I might evolve. But . . . .? her face grew
stern ?"don?t let it occur again Wendy! ?
" I?ll try Miss Lethbridge,? promised Wendy again as
she took her dismissal.


CHAPTER NINE
AN ADVENTURE FOR WENDY
The next week-end was a boarders? exeat at Winterton
and Mr. and Mrs. Murphy travelled to the city for the
occasion so that Wendy could spend the holiday with
them at one of the hotels.
She was rather a quiet Wendy since her interview with
Miss Lethbridge, and both her parents perceived a
difference in her to the girl of six weeks before.
" Subdued,?? Mr. Murphy announced, not sure whether
to be pleased or sorry.
" More thoughtful,? corrected his wife, delighted at the
effect upon her daughter of half a term at Winterton.
And as usual, it was Wendy?s mother who was the
nearest to being correct. Wendy was more thoughtful,
but only since that interview with Miss Lethbridge. She
had begun in this last week to see her school in an here-
tofore unknown light ?as a miniature nation with its
own little government of prefects and staff, and its
standards of honour and loyalty to be learnt and later
applied in the bigger sphere of the Commonwealth of
Australia itself. Miss Lethbridge, in fact, had sown the
first seeds of true patriotism into Wendy?s thoughts.
But, despite this, Wendy had not yet succeeded in
uprooting her instinctive dislike of the Head-Girl and
could not bring herself to swear loyalty to her.
She enjoyed the exeat with her parents in a quiet way,
but for perhaps the first time in her life her father?s
jokes did not evoke quite the same merriment. She
seemed more drawn to her quiet little mother that
week-end and but for an inexplicable feeling of new


reserve she would have confided in her. Several times
she was at the point of doing so but Monday afternoon,
the day for her return to school came and she bade Mrs.
Murphy good-bye without having done so.
Tnere were no other Winterton girls in the carriage
going .jack and alone, except for the presence of two
nuns in the opposite seat, she gave herself up to her
thoughts.
Why had she taken such an intense dislike to Felicity ?
Probably she was the only girl at Winterton who felt
that way towards the universally popular head-girl.
And after all she had no grounds to think differently to
the rest. Felicity was strict it is true, but she was fair
and just also. Perhaps it was that voice of hers ?affected
Wendy had pronounced it ?but Marjorie called it soft
and cultured. Pat Greenwood who had an amazing
vocabulary of slang herself, openly envied Felicity?s
perfect diction. Wendy liked the sound of good English
too. She hated voices that grated like those of these
nuns opposite for instance.
She looked up idly as a strident and rather excited
jabber reached her ears. The nuns, must be arguing.
Funny, she wouldn?t have thought nuns would jabber
like that. Surely that was not English they were speak-
ing? Perhaps they were of some foreign order.
Wendy looked curiously at the black-robed figures
opposite. She couldn?t see their faces half-hidden
beneath the wide hoods of their habits. Her thoughts
travelled idly on on the subject of nuns and her eyes
travelled curiously over their attire. Those bulky
dresses and starched wimples! How hot they must be!
And what big thick boots they wore ?good gracious!


Wendy sat forward slightly, her eyes caught by those
boots. Surely they were brown boots ?surely?why?
Wendy?s eyes dilated ?surely they were men?s military
boots! Now why in the world would nuns wear military
boots ?
And then those discordant voices jarred on her ears
again and she sat back fearfully in her seat, her heart,
as those voices became lower, thumping and heaving in
her chest. A sudden wild knowledge came to her ?
instinctive knowledge, for Wendy had never heard that
language before the knowledge that the "nuns?
opposite were speaking ?Japanese! And Australia was
at war with Japan! Military boots ?Japanese language
?what could it mean but that, sitting opposite Wendy
Murphy in a hills train, were none other than two Jap
spies disguised as nuns!
Even as the realisation came to her, Wendy felt revolted.
To use the holy habit of a nun as a disguise! She felt
disgusted, sick and frightened at the one moment and
wondered wildly what she should do.
The train drew into a wayside station for water and
the "nuns?? rose. Trembling, with wide eyes, Wendy
watched them step on to the platform and walk swiftly
away. Still trembling she felt the train jolt forward
once more. The jolt galvanised her to action. Despite
the cries of the annoyed guard she suddenly leapt from
the moving train and landed on all fours on the stone
platform.
Hi! What are you doing? ? called an angry voice and
the form of the station-master loomed menacingly up
as she scrambled to her feet.


"Jumping off a moving train like that! You might have
been killed! ?
"The nuns!? gasped Wendy frenziedly. "Go after
them quickly! They?re spies! ?
"Nuns! Spies!? The station-master looked nettled.
" Here! None of your jokes with me.?
"But they are!? Wendy stamped her foot. "They
were talking Japanese and they wore military boots! I
saw the toe of them peeping out from beneath their
habits! ?
"Rubbish! Spies!? scoffed the official. "Now come
missie?your name and address please. You can?t be
allowed to jump off moving trains like that ?
" Oh! You fool\ ? cried Wendy. Then tearing herself
from his grasp she fled in the direction she had seen the
"nuns? go.
The station-master shook his head with some annoyance
and watched her receding figure.
" These young people . . . . ! ?
This particular young person was tearing out of the
station yard so fast as her legs would go. Out on the
road she espied her quarry. Two black figures, uncon-
scious of their small pursuer, were walking quickly up
the white country road. Wendy ran faster. In two short
minutes she overtook them. With no definite plan in
mind she confronted them, her eyes blazing as they had
never blazed at the hated Felicity.
" Spies! Japs! ? she hissed undiplomatically. She
grasped frantically at their flowing robes. Then ?as a
sharp pull tore the hoods from two shaven heads she
saw their faces ?yellow faces, shrewd and brutal with
the slanting eyes of their race ?and at the moment,


contorted in a mixture of fury and fear. The tall one
gave an exclamation in a strange language and the short
one caught Wendy?s arm suddenly and thrust his enraged
face into hers.
"Australian pig-child! ?? His fingers were like a vice
on her arm. "Australian pig-child mind her own busi-
I *ï¿½
ness!
Wendy stared into that horrible face, stunned with fear
and then she gave a piercing scream as something black
was thrown over her head and her body was lifted from
the ground.
From the depths of the material she struggled and
screamed again, kicking and tearing at the arms that
encircled her. And then came the sound of quick running
steps. Suddenly she found herself thrown to the ground
and pushing away the enveloping folds of cloth, she
looked out to see the two Japs fleeing along the road
with her friend the station-master in full pursuit.
Wendy made up her mind in a second. Scrambling to
her feet she fled on winged feet back in the direction of
the deserted station. Straight into the ticket office she
went and lifted the receiver of the telephone.
"Police Station! Quick!? she gasped to the tele-
phonist?s quiet " Number please.?
The Hills Police Superintendent took her garbled
message.
Two Jap spies on the Hills Road ?disguised ?were
disguised?as nuns ?being pursued by the Redwood
Station-master ? Thank you wait there until we
come! ? He rang off and only then did Wendy give way
to her dizzy, nauseating feeling of sickness. Replacing


the receiver she staggered and fell unconscious on to the
floor of the ticket office.
And it was here that they found her nearly an hour later
after the two rascally "yellow devils?? had been captured
and passed over to the military authorities.
The station-master, with a black eye and bruised limbs
disclaimed all credit for their capture.
" It?s this young lady here who acted so promptly.??
And he told the superintendent of police and the uni-
formed military officer how he had watched Wendy
fleeing after the Japs and their consequent attack upon
her.
" You are a brave and very observant little girl,?? said
the policeman tenderly.
"Aaid you have served your country well,? added the
military man approvingly.
"And please ?may I have a drink of water and go back
to Winterton? ? pleaded Wendy wearily as once more,
she lost consciousness.


CHAPTER TEN
FELICITY AGAIN
The School buzzed with excitement over Wendy
Murphy?s encounter with the Jap spies and she, con-
fined for two or three days to the sick room, was indeed
the heroine of the hour. As she recovered from the shock
of her adventure she was the recipient of a stream of
admiring visitors. These did not only include the
members of her own form, but ranged from wide-eyed
little First Form babes to lordly young members of the
Sixth.
Girls who before had hardly known her name brought
gifts of flowers or fruit or chocolates. Little Denise
Markham of the Second shyly brought her pet doll "to
keep Wendy company after her fright with the Zaffanese
Horribles.?? Marion Walker, a lively Third Form girl
endeavoured to smuggle in the school cat as her gift,
but was sharply vetoed in this deed by a horrified
Matron. Leonie Filmore-Danvers, sister to Felicity, full
of admiration breathlessly staggered up the stairs one
lunch hour with an enormous pile of the latest magazines
from the combined members of the Fourth, and then,
one day Felicity herself walked a little diffidently in?
not too sure of her reception.
" I hope you are feeling fit again Wendy.?
Wendy took her outstretched hand with some embarrass-
ment. Her tone was rather abrupt.
" Perfectly, thanks.?
'lt was very plucky of you ?to go after those Japs.?
" It was nothing.?
"Rubbish! It was very plucky indeed. Miss Lethbridge


said so at prayers the other morning and we all agree.
The School is proud of you.?
Wendy did not answer. To be fair, she didn?t know
what to say. What did one say to things like that any-
way? There was an awkward silence.
Then: ?
" Wendy, why do you dislike me so? ?
At the words Wendy raised surprised and startled eyes
to the quivering face of the Head-Prefect. She gave
another Wriggle of embarrassment.
" I don?t know,? came her faint answer at last, and,
unable to meet the pleading of those grey eyes, she
dropped her own to the bed. Her nervous hands pleated
and unpleated the edge of the coverlet.
Felicity?s voice came again troubled and equally
nervous.
"You must have some reason surely. You don?t take
such passionate dislikes to people without some reason
?and ?well I have felt your enmity since the very first
day of the term. Wendy ?can?t you tell me? ?
" I have told you ?I don?t know! ? Wendy replied
irritably.
" You mean, you won?t tell me! ? Felicity gave a sigh
and rose. ? Oh well ?I?m sorry! I hoped to know you
better. I like to understand all the girls ?an H.P. should
try to do that I think ?and you seem such good material
for the school. However, if you won?t tell me . . . . ?
Wendy stopped her furious pleating as the other made
a move towards the door. She caught Felicity?s arm
timidly.
" Don?t go Felicity. Ill ?I?ll try to explain. It?s ?it?s


just that ?well I hardly know where to start.? She gave
a tremulous little laugh.
" It all seemed to start when I told you my name,?
suggested Felicity hopefully.
Wendy nodded.
"Yes that was nearly the beginning. But . . .
hesitantly and honestly ?" I really think that rather
than dislike you I have disliked all you stand for.?
" Supposing you explain.? Felicity was puzzled. "What
do I stand for Wendy? ?
" Wealth, position ?all that,? said Wendy with a vague
wave of her hand. "You see, before I came to Winter-
ton I attended the Government High School at Karrinup
Plains where dad has the butchery. I was quite happy
there. My friends were the daughters of farmers or
small shop-keepers and we often used to read the social
pages of the newspaper and ?well ?I suppose you?d
say ?sneer ?at the names we saw there. Your name ?
Filmore-Danvers was featured a lot in the Social
Column and we used to make up rhymes about it ... ?
" Tell me some of them,? begged Felicity dimpling.
" Do, Wendy.?
"You might be annoyed.?
? I won?t. Go on.?
" Let?s think then.? Wendy wrinkled her brow. " One
ran something like this I think: ?
' There was a young lady named Danvers
To whom all Society panders,
But she turns up her nose
And refuses to pose
If they don?t add the Filmore to Danvers.
Felicity laughed appreciatively.


" Jolly good. Know any more? ?
Wendy grinned ruefully.
" I never thought I?d recite them to Felicity Filmore-
Danvers herself. But there is another one I remember.
It went like this: ?
' There is a great family called Danvers
Whose greatness is measured in Dandys
Now a Dandy may be
A fop?or you see
A mixture of ice-cream and candies ?
Which? ? ?
Felicity laughed again.
" Rather feeble that one. Still, go on with your tale.
You Were telling me the story of your life when you
broke into verse.? Her voice was flippant but her grey
eyes were searching.
Wendy continued.
" Well, as I was saying, we used to ' throw off ? a lot at
your name and the others that were featured frequently
in the social page. And then, one day mum told me she
wanted to send me to Winterton. I was horrified and I
tried my hardest to get out of coming here.?
" But why? ? puzzled Felicity. "After all, Winterton
has the reputation of being one of the best schools in
the Commonwealth.?
Wendy nodded.
" Exactly. That is why I didn?t want to come. All the
girls at the High School said you were a fearfully snobby
lot here ?all, that is except Mary, my best pal ?she
would give anything for the chance ?but all the others
rather looked down on Winterton.?


" Looked down on Winterton!? echoed Felicity indig-
nantly and incredulously.
" Because they said all Winterton girls were snobs! ?
explained Wendy hurriedly. " That is why I was so set
against coming here. But mum thought differently. She
persuaded dad, and I had to come.?
" I think I see.? Felicity nodded gently. " Then the first
person you met here was the prize snob Felicity
Filmore-Danvers ?hyphen and all (which, by the way,
we can?t help any more than you can help having
Murphy for your surname) and you got on the defen-
sive immediately . . . .?
? I thought you would look down on me because my
father was a butcher . . . . ? interrupted Wendy.
? Whyever should I, People ?decent people ?don?t
think like that in Australia.? Felicity?s eyes opened wide
in genuine amazement.
" Well your father is Sir John
" He merited the title! ? said Felicity proudly. " Dad
did some marvellous research work in the last war and
was knighted in recognition of his services to the
nation.?
"And he?s a university professor ... . ?
"And his grandfather like yours Wendy, was a butcher
in England! ?
Wendy did stare at that!
"Was he? Then how ....??
" Dad has worked his way up by scholarships ?first to
Haileybury and then to Cambridge! ?
" Oh!?
"So you see ?my social status ?a horrible phrase ?is
actually not a whit higher than yours.?


" Oh!?
Felicity dimpled again.
? You?ve been rather silly haven?t you, Wendy? ?
" Y-yes.? Wendy hesitated, shamefaced at these frank
evelations. ? I?l?m sorry, Felicity. I?ve been a rotter
?and really rather ?well ?common, I?m afraid. Miss
Lethbridge called me a ?bolshie! ?
" Miss Lethbridge ? what? ?
" She said I was a little bolshie. She meant it kindly
though.?
I m sure she did. Miss Lethbridge is never unkind.
She is often stern ?but never unkind. I owe her a lot.?
" Why? Why do you owe her a lot? ? asked Wendy
curiously.
Felicity shook herself suddenly, as though aware that
she had said too much.
? Oh ?nothing. Forget it, Wendy! ?


CHAPTER ELEVEN
THE GYMKHANA
But Wendy did not forget Felicity?s words completely.
Her nature was naturally a curious one and she thought
a lot about what she privately termed " The mystery
of the Head-Mistress? private life? during the rest of
her stay in the sickroom. Once back in school, however,
the matter was pushed to the inner recesses of her mind.
Now that half-term was over there were lots of other
things to think of. A series of fetes, Paddy?s markets
and concerts had been arranged to assist the growth of
the ambulance fund ?original ideas seemed to be lacking
that term ?but nevertheless the school looked as though
it would raise quite a creditable sum with these more
stereotyped functions. The outside attendance at the
concert was very satisfying and a lot of girls proclaimed
that Wendy had been the attraction, because her photo-
graph and a paragraph dealing with her capture of the
Jap spies had appeared in the daily paper.
In addition to these war-time activities, half-term
brought the terminal examinations looming into view
and Wendy, anxious to present her parents with a good
report of her first term?s work at Winterton, worked
hard and was forced to put all other problems to the
back of her mind.
And then, last but not least, there was the gymkhana,
held annually at Winterton to aid the cot supported by
the school at the Children?s Hospital and to show off
the proficiency or otherwise of the members of the
Riding Class.
Wendy was not a member of the Riding Class of course


?her parents could not afford to give her extras ?but
the twins, Pat and Pam Greenwood were and a few other
members of the Gums House.
Upon the points gained during the events a House
Riding Shield was always awarded, for which there was
much keen competition and speculation.
Only about twenty girls comprised the Riding Class at
Winterton, but it was nevertheless a very active club.
To their delight the twins had been chosen to represent
their House for the Shield and urged on by their house-
mates they spent much time practising on their grey
ponies, Dilly and Dally. And at these practices the girls
were able to watch the progress of the competitors from
the other houses.
Waratah felt quite confident as they saw their entrants
Felicity Danvers and Karen Leigh ride round the oval
with skill and ease, mounting and dismounting calmly
and quickly in musical chairs or guiding their horses
skilfully in and out of the obstacles in the obstacle race.
Felicity and Karen, who had ridden from babyhood,
seemed certain of full marks for style and good seats.
In Wattle House there was a tiny favourite called Ashley
Melrose, a pretty child of perhaps ten, whose habit
always looked faultless and who seemed destined to
win the hearts of the judges when they saw her mounted
on her little white pony, " Creamy.? Ashley?s partner
?w as a Fifth-form girl, a good rider whose name was
Heath Winser.
Banksia placed its hopes upon their intrepid Scotch,
Anne Mcï¿½eanie, who, it was said, could ride anything
from a bucking broncho to her own big black mare,


"Jeanie.? For reserve, Banksia looked with lesser hopes
at Barbie Vernon on " Dew-Drop.?
But the Gum-ites -were quite content with their fearless
twins and their mounts. Pat and Pam were horse-women
to the core. They loved their horses like children and
brushed and combed them with loving care until their
grey coats shone like silver. Added to which, on this
occasion at least, they paid special attention to their own
appearance ?or rather, their friends and supporters did.
On the morning of the gymkhana the twins? riding boots
were polished and polished by members of the Gums
Remove until it was thought the leather would wear
through with so much cleaning.
Marjorie, the careful, was detailed to press and clean
their brown trousers and she made a marvellous job of
them.
The horses themselves had new blue saddle-cloths em-
broidered with the school badge and their saddles and
bridles winked in the sun with the brilliance of their
polish.
It was Wendy who procured the two lengths of red
ribbon (the House colour) to go round the horses?
necks.
And to Wendy?s delight her mother accepted Miss
Lethbridge?s invitation to the gymkhana. Now she
would be able to introduce mummy to Marjorie and her
friends and she smiled ?to Felicity. Wendy no
longer hated Felicity. How could she after their talk in
the sick-room? No, Wendy like most of the other girls
revered and looked up to the Head-Girl now.
Mrs. Murphy arrived immediately after lunch. She was
a mother to be proud of the girls told Wendy. Tall and


fair, with a look of dainty fragility, she was simply dad
in a well-cut frock of navy-blue. She was obviously
delighted with everything, Winterton, Wendy and
Wendy?s friends. Her enthusiasm was quite infectious.
To Felicity, whom Wendy introduced her with obvious
pride and some awe, she cast an appraising eye. Like
Wendy, she too had read the social columns in the past
and the name of Filmore-Danvers was well known to
her. But if she expected a supercilious air, she did not
get it from the Head-Prefect of Winterton. Girls of
such ilk had no chance of prefect-ship with Miss Leth-
bridge as Principal. Felicity?s slightly shy, but obviously
genuine welcome dispelled all Mrs. Murphy?s qualms
immediately.
If Wendy at Winterton, took Felicity as her model, her
mother would not be disappointed.
The events started shortly after 2 p.m. The girls and
their parents established themselves in good or bad
positions around the oval according to their luck. Wendy
and Marjorie considered themselves amongst the un-
lucky ones, although their respective parents considered
the position excellent, for, at the last moment, who
should stroll over and establish herself in their midst,
but the Head herself, charming, poised and leading by
the hand a tiny girl of perhaps four years of age. The
child was prettily dressed in a dainty smocked frock of
the palest blue which blended perfectly with her fair
curls and blue eyes.
Wendy and Marjorie rose simultaneously to offer their
seats to Miss Lethbridge but the Head shook her head
smilingly.


" Sit down girls. There is a spare chair here and Faerlie
can sit on the grass at my feet.?
? How are you Mrs. Millward and Mrs. Murphy? ?
The Head seated herself between the two mothers and
proceeded to discuss school and other matters with them.
The little girl sat down at her feet for perhaps two
minutes and then wandered away on a tour of her own
inspection.
" Don?t go far Faerlie! ? warned Miss Lethbridge.
" I won?t Ricky,? promised the mite and wandered on.
Marjorie pulled her deck-chair closer to Wendy?s.
" What rotten luck! Now we won?t be able to let our-
selves go or anything and the Head?ll monopolise the
parents.?
" I shall shout if I want to! ? asserted Wendy. " She
can?t mind us barracking for our House. But I say Marj.!
Who is the kid? And why does she call the Head
'Ricky???
" What kid? Oh ?Faerlie! She?s the Head?s niece or
something. Faerlie Lethbridge is her name. She lives
in the township with a nurse to look after her until she
is old enough for Winterton. She always calls Miss
Leth. ' Ricky? ?I suppose instead of auntie. Sweet, isn?t
she??
" Lovely! ? agreed Wendy, who loved all small children.
"But . . . .?
Wendy broke off as a chorus of clapping proclaimed the
first event ?the walk, trot and canter and with Marjorie
she forgot the presence of the Head or her niece as she
eagerly watched the competitors enter the ring.
Points for this event would go to good all-round riding
and the general appearance of horse and rider. Each


entrant had to walk her steed once around the ring, trot
once without breaking and canter once.
Felicity led on her raking chestnut, "Michael of Devon,"
and as she went round the oval, trim and neat, perfection
in seat and posture, a cheer went up on all sides ?for
the Head-Girl seemed representative of the whole
school, irrespective of all House loyalties and was very
popular into the bargain. But she rode for Waratah this
afternoon; her horse wore the Waratah green ribbon
on its glossy neck and the Waratah girls did perhaps
give the louder cheers and continued them vociferously
for their other candidate, Karen. Karen, poised and sure
on her pie-bald, " Spotty,? rode on and then came the
turn of the Wattles. The Wattle-ites waved their yellow
ribbons in delight as little Ashley Melrose, ten years old
and very sweet, rode proudly by on her cream pony.
' What a sweet child! ? exclaimed the parents enthusias-
tically and in their admiration almost forgot to watch
the excellent riding of the Wattles? second competitor,
Heath Winser.
And then Pat and Pam rode round. Marjorie and Wendy
bobbed up and down with excitement, quite forgetting
the near presence of their Head-Mistress as they shouted
their encouragement of the " Gums ? favourites.
Pat and Pam really did ride well. They sat their dapple-
grey ponies with ease and confidence, toes just right in
the stirrups, hands well down at the right angle and
backs straight without a hint of stiffness. Dilly and
Dally behaved splendidly. They walked proudly, necks
arched gracefully; trotted without breaking and cantered
like well-made rocking horses. A delightful perform-
ance.


Anne Mcï¿½eanie, the hope of Banksia, looked just a bit
ungainly after the twins? perfect performance, but she
was to gain points for her House in the more intrepid
events and her partner, Barbie Vernon on "Dew-Drop,?
put up a fairly good show for Banksia as she entered the
field.
After all the walking and trotting and cantering was
over, the horses and their riders lined up for the judging
and the awarding of points. Imagine the delight of the
Gum-ites when Pat and Pam won by a small margin
from the superb Felicity and the sweet Ashley.
" The Gums House ?10 points! ? announced the judge
through his megaphone. " Gums ?10 points, Waratah
9, Wattle 8 and Banksia 5! ?
" Good old Gums! ? shouted Marjorie and Wendy and
all their House-mates as Pat and Pam rode proudly out
of the ring to get ready for Musical Chairs.
This was exciting. There were four competitors, one
from each house. Pat rode for the Gums, Felicity for
Waratah, Heath for the Wattles and Barbie for Banksia.
Three chairs were arranged in the centre of the ring
and someone started the gramophone as the horses
re-entered. The music of " There were ten pretty girls?
roared out through the loud speaker and the spectators
took up the chorus as the competitors trotted round and
round, only altering the words in most cases to " There
were four pretty girls.?
Suddenly the music stopped. The riders dismounted in
a trice and dragging their unwilling horses they made
a rush to secure a chair. Barbie was left chairless, her
horse jibbing obstinately. A chair was removed from
the circle. The music started again and this time the cry


went up joyfully from at least the three sides of the
oval where the Waratahs, Wattles and Gums congre-
gated: ?" There were three pretty girls! ?
Round and round they went, then again the music
stopped. Another scuffle and the Wattles sent up a
groan as Heath rode resignedly from the field. Another
chair was removed.
" There were two pretty girls! ? shouted the Gums and
the Wattles together. Round again rode Felicity and
Pat and stop! Two figures rushed for the one chair.
Felicity? No, Pat! No cheers from Waratah
Felicity was seated triumphantly and Pat, the van-
quished, rode briskly away. Ten points to Waratah!
There was united clapping from all sides now. Good
old Felicity! Wendy?s voice was shrill.
The events followed quickly one upon the other. The
relay race to the Wattles ?that tiny Ashley easily clear-
ing the field. Intrepid Anne Mcï¿½eanie only tipped in
the hurdles once and brought in eight points for Banksia.
She followed up this success by scoring another eight
points in the Obstacle Race.
' We are six down on Banksia,? mourned Marjorie at
the interval.
'' Yes, but Pam is riding in the next ?the Hurdles again
isn t it ? And Pam and her Dally know how to jump.?
" Those brushwood hurdles are a good idea,? came the
voice of a parent behind speaking to Miss Lethbridge.
' They are so light that if the horse does tip them there
is little chance of his coming down.?
' Yes, and they are hollow, which adds to their safety,?
added the Head with a pause. Sitting forward she called
sharply.


" Faerlie! Come out from beneath that hurdle at once! ?
The little girl emerged, to the amusement of the girls,
from beneath the brushwood hurdle which was placed
ready for the next event.
" Yes, Ricky,? she said obediently and stood to one side
eyeing Miss Lethbridge warily.
Marjorie laughed softly.
" Even she obeys when the Head speaks like that! ?
Wendy nodded.
" Here they come! ? she said as the competitors entered
for the hurdles and Faerlie was forgotten as they lined
up.
" They?re off! ?
Anne Mcï¿½eanie to the fore tore round the farther side
of the ring at a rattling pace. Two minutes and she
would jump the hurdle directly in front of where Wendy
& Co., were sitting.
Wendy fixed her eye on the little mound of brushwood.
And then her eyes dilated! She gave a gasp of horror!
There was the child Faerlie, crouched in underneath
the hurdle again! If Anne?s horse tipped it his hoof
must surely strike the child?s head!
Wendy rushed forward full in the path of the on-
coming horse.
? Wendy! What are you doing? Come back! ? called
the Head-Mistress agitatedly.
But Wendy paid no heed. The Head had not seen what
she had seen and as Anne?s big black "Jeanie? was
almost upon the hurdle she gave the pile of brushwood
and its human contents an enormous thrust. The hurdle
rolled to one side.
Anne tried indignantly and in vain, to pull up Jeanie


sharply. The horse rose in the air prepared for the
jump that was no longer there. Wendy had a vision
of a large black, rearing body and then she shut her
eyes as two hoofs came hurtling down striking her
unconscious to the ground.
Anne fell with the impact, unhurt but sobbing con-
vulsively. Jeanie, terrified, bolted from the field and
parents and girls rushed to the spot where Wendy lay,
still and white except for the two streams of dark blood
coming from both temples. And then all saw the
frightened little figure of Faerlie Lethbridge emerge
from the overturned hurdle.
Miss Lethbridge cast one look at the child to see that
she Was unhurt. Then her voice rang out sharp and
clear a firm command. It was instantly obeyed.
" Stand clear everybody, please! ?
" Is there a doctor present? ?
'lama doctor,? said a quiet voice and a tall man pushed
his way through the crown to Wendy?s side. He ran his
hands competently over her body.
" No bones broken ?but a bad head injury! A stretcher
please! ?
Already Matron and Nurse were there with a stretcher
and they lifted Wendy?s unconscious form on to it.
Slowly she was borne to the sick room, Miss Lethbridge
following, frowning with anxiety. Just one word to
Felicity,
" See to Anne, Felicity. She has had a bad shock and
keep an eye on my naughty Faerlie if you will.?


CHAPTER TWELVE
DARK DAYS
They were dark days that followed. Wendy did not
regain consciousness all through that night or the next
day or the next night, and the rumour flew around that
the doctors feared that she never would regain it.
Mrs. Murphy stayed at the school of course and her
husband was sent for. Wendy was their only child and
their agony of mind must have been very great.
Miss Lethbridge, though you would never have known
it from her calm, efficient manner, was also suffering
exceedingly.
" You see I feel so responsible,? she confessed brokenly
to Mr. Murphy late that first night. " It was all due
to Faerlie?s disobedience.?
" Rubbish! ? said Wendy?s father, who had heard the
whole story. " So far as I can see, no one is responsible.
One can?t blame a child of four years.?
But his voice had quivered. Strong man though he was,
this was his only child who lay there so still and white
and he loved her very dearly.
? Your daughter saved Faerlie?s life,? were Miss Leth-
bridge?s next words. ?It is a debt I can never repay
Mr. Murphy. All I can offer is gratitude and of what
use is gratitude if ?if . . . . ? She broke off unable
to voice the thought uppermost in their minds.
" If it is so,? Mr. Murphy continued for her. " If God
does see fit to take our ?our ?daughter Miss Lethbridge
?we will know that she has died ?as many in these
troublous times are dying ?she will have laid down her
life for another. What more glorious death ?if death
it must be?could she have? ?


Miss Lethbridge could think of no reply. She merely
laid her hand gently on the sleeve of the big man and
stole away. She knew he would wish to be alone in his
anxiety.
And in the school the girls went around dejectedly with
soft movements and anxious brows. They all knew that
the Angel of Death hovered uncertainly over their
school ?their school which had always been to them,
if they could have expressed it thus ?the very symboli-
sation of surging life leaping out of strong vigorous
young bodies.
Anne Mcï¿½eanie, whose horse Jeanie, had done the
actual damage was in such a state of nerves that Matron
insisted on her removal to a quiet part of the House.
And there she lay torturing herself with thoughts that
perhaps she was in part responsible. It was Felicity who
brought her comfort. She had guessed at the reason for
Anne?s breakdown and she obtained permission to visit
her on the second day. To Felicity, Anne confided her
fears.
" I thought I was a good rider but I couldn?t pull Jeanie
up quickly enough.?
" Of course not,? consoled Felicity stroking her hot
forehead gently. "And no one blames you Anne.?
" Not even Mr. and Mrs. Murphy? ?
" Of course not,? replied Felicity again with conviction.
" Wendy?s parents realise that no one is directly respon-
sible. The only person who can be blamed is young
Faerlie ?and you can?t blame a baby! ?
"No of course not.? Anne shuddered. " It might have
been worse ?for me I mean ?if Wendy had not acted


so promptly. Jeanie would most certainly have killed
Faerlie if she had stumbled over the hurdle.?
' Wendy certainly saved Faerlie?s life,? nodded Felicity.
" It was an awfully brave thing to do wasn?t it? ? said
Anne. " It must have taken pluck to rush out straight
in front of a galloping horse as she did.?
" The bravest thing I ever saw,? agreed Felicity. " If ?
if ?she does recover Anne . . . . ? Felicity?s voice
wavered. " If she does recover Anne, I should think her
deed would be worthy of the highest recognition Winter-
ton can give.?
" You mean? ?
"A stained glass window in Chapel,? said Felicity and
her eyes filled with tears as she went on. " Marjorie
Millward ?she?s terribly upset ?Wendy was her pal
you know ?Marjorie told me today how Wendy had
always admired the one in memory of Erica Winter ?
and how she was never tired of hearing her story.?
" Perhaps,? said Anne, " the future Winterton girls will
look at a window in honour of Wendy Murphy and
revere her story.?
" I should think they will,? assented Felicity. " For
whether Wendy ?lives ?or ?dies . . . . ? Her voice
trembled again, "whatever happens I should be surprised
if she did not get her window.? She broke off. "Oh
Anne! Isn?t the suspense terrible? And just imagine
that every hour of every day there are people going
through this agony.?
' You mean people with sons and husbands and friends
at the war? ? asked Anne.
Felicity nodded.
"Yes. I never realised it like this before. It just shows


that you have to experience suffering yourself to really
understand it in others.?
" Miss Lethbridge often says that doesn?t she ? ? reflected
Anne. Anne was a prefect and like Felicity, she saw a
good deal more of the Head of Winterton than the
juniors.
" Yes,? answered Felicity now. And then almost to
herself she added. " But then Miss Lethbridge herself
has suffered a great loss.?
" Has she? ? Anne?s voice was curious. " How do you
know? ?
" Eh? ? Felicity?s answer was startled. " I must have
been thinking aloud.?
" But has Miss Lethbridge lost someone very dear? ?
persisted Anne, her own troubles forgotten for the time.
? Well,? explained Felicity, "we all know that Hugh
Lethbridge was killed in action. It was read out at
prayers last year.?
"Oh yes.? Anne ruminated. " Who was Hugh Leth-
bridge Felicity? We?ve all wondered about that. Was
it, as we all suppose, her brother? ?
" No.? Felicity rose abruptly in the manner of one who
has said too much. " No, Anne, it wasn?t her brother.?
? Then who . . . . ? ? began Anne. But Felicity was
taking her departure and the question remained un-
answered.
" I must go now Anne. It?s nearly time for lunch and
I want to get the latest bulletin about Wendy.?
" Let me know so soon as poss.? urged Anne anxiously.
Felicity gave her promise and beat a hasty retreat at the
sound of the luncheon bell.
While Felicity was with Anne, Marjorie was another


person whose nerves that day demanded consolation
from another. Marjorie sought it from Miss Lethbridge
herself. She went to the Principal?s study timidly, after
a sleepless night, worrying over her friend and tortured
by thoughts of what might happen.
" May I speak to you, Miss Lethbridge? ?
" Of course, Marjorie. Come and sit down child.? Miss
Lethbridge noted the pallor and worried countenance of
her pupil. Poor child, she was suffering too.
Marjorie sank into a low chair.
It is about Wendy Miss Lethbridge. Will ?will she
die? ? Her voice was awed.
Miss Lethbridge hesitated at the outright question.
What to say? But the child, all the school, must be
prepared for what they all felt certain must come to
pass.
"It is very likely I am afraid Marjorie,? she replied
gravely.
It is all so final ?and . . . . ? Marjorie shuddered ?
? So horrible Miss Lethbridge.?
" Death??
" Yes ?death.?
? That is quite the wrong way to look at it Marjorie.?
" How else can one look at it? ? cried Marjorie with a
gu!p.
Miss Lethbridge did not answer for a moment and
Marjorie looking at her, surprised a look of what seemed
to be conflict ?as though pain was fighting with some-
thing bigger.
The Head?s voice, when it came, trembled a little.
" There is only one way to look at it if one is to carry
on in this world when one has lost another Marjorie.


I must tell you, for we all have to face up to this kind
of suffering sometime in our lives.?
"Yes, Miss Lethbridge??
"We must believe that people do not die ?it is only
their bodies that die. The real part of people ?their
spirit ?the part we call character ?is born again when
they leave this earth. That is the teaching of our Lord.
We say it in the Creed every Sunday ?' I believe in the
resurrection and the life everlasting?.?
"Yes, but I can?t understand it Miss Lethbridge! ? pro-
tested Marjorie. " I never can and I never say those
things in Chapel, because I don?t feel I do believe them.?
" But you must believe them Marjorie,? urged the Head.
" But there?s no reason in it. How do we know we will
be born again? ?
" Christ told us.?
" Yes, but . . . .
"And we must believe whether we undersand or not.
That, Marjorie is what we call faith. If you have not
faith in the mercy and goodness and Plan of the
Creator ?then ?well then you may as well go to any
heathen land you can name and worship idols. For
Faith is the basis of Christianity. Child-like trust and
faith that God, whatever he does, is working always for
our good.?
Marjorie was impressed, but like all school-girls, the
subject embarrassed her. It went too deeply. She did
voice one question, however.
' Would you say the war was for our good, Miss Leth-
bridge? ?
" Yes ?ultimately.?
" But all the suffering ?innocent men


Miss Lethbridge?s face worked painfully.
" Marjorie, you know the story of the Crucifixion?
" Yes.?
" Christ was the most innocent man of all and he
suffered.?
Marjorie nodded slowly.
? I never thought about that.?
" Those are the things my dear you must think about
if you wish to make a real success of your life. Christ
is the Pattern you know. We may not be able to follow
it as closely as we should ?but we can try to cut our-
selves out as near the Pattern as possible.?
? Yes, Miss Lethbridge.? Marjorie agreed soberly.
Perhaps the subject was a bit beyond her reflected the
Head, but Marjorie was fifteen and it was time the seeds
of Higher Thoughts were sown. She rose and put a
hand kindly on her pupil?s shoulder.
*' I am afraid we have wandered a little from our
original subject, Marjorie, but think about what I have
said. Those thoughts have helped me over many a
stony path and some day they may be of some comfort
to you.?
" They will be Miss Lethbridge,? said Marjorie then.
Her face was red and white with embarrassment but
she kept doggedly on. " I?ll pray hard for Wendy
tonight.?
"And may God see fit to answer your prayers my dear,?
replied the Head-Mistress with a sigh. She stood looking
out of her study window long after Marjorie had gone
to lunch and the tears filled her eyes.
Those days, when Wendy Murphy, lay hovering between
Life and Death, were indeed dark days at Winterton.


CHAPTER THIRTEEN
WONDERFUL NEWS
Silence reigned supreme over Winterton. The school,
after the hurry and bustle of the day had gradually sunk
to rest. A great golden moon hovering over the big
Main School cast its rays gently over the four Houses
where the girls and the mistresses slept and gently over
the deserted gardens, making them seem like a scene
from some old-world fairy-tale.
It was the hour of midnight and suddenly, out of the
stillness the big clock in Main School boomed out the
chimes: ? one ! two ! three ! four ! ?At the
fourth stroke the small still form in the School Sick-
room stirred slightly.
"eleven! ?twelve!? boomed the clock and the
long eye-lashes flickered open.
" Miss Lethbridge! ? called the voice of Wendy Murphy
faintly. "Miss Lethbridge! Are you there??
The night-sister hurried into the room at the sound.
She bent quickly over the bed, her face triumphant.
" Wendy, my dear! Are you awake at last? ?
Wendy looked in puzzlement at the dim figure and
gradually out of the maze her clouded eyes registered
the snowy white veil and uniform of Sister Beard.
The effort seemed too much and she closed her eyes
wearily, but the pale lips moved restlessly.
" Miss Lethbridge! ?
Sister, bending low, caught the faint whisper, and, her
face alight with hope, she hurried from the room.
Miss Lethbridge was not asleep. It was three nights
since she had done anything but doze at night and she


sat up quickly as, after a sharp, preliminary knock Sister
Beard entered the room.
" Sister! Wendy? She is not ?not . . . The Head?s
voice faltered.
But Sister?s face told its own tale as she switched on
the small, bed-side lamp.
" Miss Lethbridge, Wendy is conscious?or she was two
minutes ago and she is calling for you.?
Before she had finished speaking Miss Lethbridge was
tying the girdle of her dressing-gown and taking up her
torch she followed the nurse along the corridors to the
Sick-Room.
" Miss Lethbridge! ? called a slightly stronger voice as
they entered. '' Miss Lethbridge ? please! ?
" I am here Wendy my dear. Did you want me? ? The
Head?s voice was gentle. Her eyes glittered with the
relief of hearing that little voice after three days of
silence.
Wendy?s small brown hand grasped the white one of
her Principal convulsively, and her lips smiled apolo-
getically.
"Miss Lethbridge, who was Hugh Lethbridge? Was
he ?your brother? ?
Miss Lethbridge took a long time to reply, but as
Wendy?s voice persisted, she glanced slowly at the
watching nurse and perceived her nod.
" No ?not my brother, Wendy.?
" Then ?who? ?
" My .... my husband,? said Miss Lethbridge faintly.
Wendy?s eyes flew open.
" Your ? husband? ?
' Yes. Faerlie is our daughter.?


" Oh! ? Wendy?s eyes closed a moment and then sprang
open again, and to the anxiety of her watchers, she
started wildly up.
" There! There! Wendy, you must lie still little girl! ?
commanded the Sister anxiously. But her patient
struggled.
" Did ?did ?Faerlie Lethbridge die, too? ?
" No, Wendy. Faerlie is all right ?thanks to you.
" I saved her? ?
" Yes.?
" Oh! ? Wendy sank back thankfully and smiled.
" I am so glad. It would have been terrible if you had
lost her, too.?
" Too terrible for words,? agreed Faerlie?s mother
gravely. But Wendy did not hear her. Her eyes were
closed and Sister, watching, whispered exultantly.
" She is asleep. Properly asleep now for the first time
in these dark days.?
" You think she will be all right, Sister? ?
" I am certain of it ?now. While that stupor lasted I
held no hopes. But ?this ?this is the beginning of her
recovery. She has passed the crisis.?
" Let us thank God,? was Miss Lethbridge?s reply and
reverently, the two ?the hardened hospital nurse who
had witnessed many such a scene ?and the wise, kind
teacher knelt side by side.
" Thank you, God, for the mercy Thou has shown to
us this night. Keep us all in Thy Faith. Teach us always
to trust in the wisdom of Thy Will. Guide us in the
days and years ahead and walk Thou by our side ?
AMEN.?


" Wendy Murphy regained consciousness last night and
the doctors hold every hope that before this term comes
to its conclusion she will be well enough to travel
home! ? announced the Head at Assembly next morning.
The school could hardly contain itself. Cheer after
cheer shook the rafters of the Hall and on every face
relief was paramount. Marjorie Millward burst into
tears. So did Anne Mcï¿½eanie. But they were tears of
joy. And Felicity Danvers voiced the thoughts of them
all.
" Oh Miss Lethbridge ?how wonderful! ?
It was wonderful. The best news the Head could have
given them, and as the days flew by it was more wonder-
ful still for Wendy progressed rapidly. Her parents,
after one delightful week of assuring themselves that
their daughter was practically her old self, departed for
their country home, and a few days later she had her
first real visitor in the person of Miss Lethbridge herself.
She brought her needlework one afternoon when every-
one else was at lessons, and dismissing Sister, she
announced her intention of staying for the whole after-
noon.
Wendy Was rather shy at first but the Head, talking on
all the subjects dear to the heart of a school-girl, soon
dispelled it. And later the conversation turned to school
matters and from that to the new nursery school Winter-
ton \was contemplating opening in the new term.
" It is really for the benefit of mothers who, being busy
with war-time activities, wish to leave their children
with us in the mornings,? explained the Head.
" At what age will the children be eligible to enter? ?
questioned Wendy with interest.


"At about three years. From three to six we think. At
six we will expect them to enter the Kindergarten.?
"Shall you enter Faerlie then Miss Lethbridge??
Wendy?s voice was slow and hesitant.
It was some minutes before Miss Lethbridge answered.
Then, snapping off a cotton, she answered briskly.
" Yes, Wendy. Faerlie starts at Winterton next term
and I hope school makes her a little more obedient to
9 9
me.
" I should think it will,? said Wendy shyly, " for then
you will be her Head-Mistress as well as ?her mother.?
The Head?s grey eyes looked searchingly at the face on
the pillows.
" Then ?you remember ?what I told you that wonder-
ful night of your recovery? ?
"Yes, Miss Lethbridge. Do you mind? ?
The Head considered.
" No, I don?t think so. The school would have had to
know in due course.?
" I shall not say a word to anybody until you give me
permission Miss Lethbridge.?
Miss Lethbridge smiled.
' Thank you, Wendy. I knew of course that I could
trust you. But, as I have said, the school must know
eventually and as Faerlie will be a member of it next
term, you may have that permission now. First however,
you must know the whole story, otherwise you will be in
a quandary answering all the questions the girls will
ask you and that story, my dear, I am not going to tell
you myself! ?
Who will tell it then? ? asked Wendy in surprise.


have already arranged for her to do so. After your
persistent questions the other night . .
. .? Wendy
blushed.
"After those questions and my answers
I knew that it
may be necessary for you to know some
: of my private
history ... . ? Wendy blushed again, but the Head?s
" Felicity Danvers,? replied the Head with a smile. " I
eyes were twinkling as she continued.
"And, as Ido not feel quite up to telling you myself, I
have delegated Felicity to do it for me as she is the only
person, other than the senior mistresses and Sister who
knows it.?
Wendy gaped.
" Why?Felicity? ?
" That is part of the story,? smiled the Head gaily. And
not another word could Wendy extract from her until
she rose to go.
"Felicity will sit with you tomorrow afternoon Wendy
since it is a half-holiday.?
With that Wendy had to be content. But twenty-four
hours seemed such a long time to wait.


CHAPTER FOURTEEN
THE STORY OF MISS LETHBRIDGE
But at last the time came. Felicity entered gaily, sharp
on the stroke of two. Wendy greeted her enthusiasti-
cally. She was up now and sitting in a low basket chair
by the sick-room window.
" How is the head, Wendy? ?
" Quite up to hearing all about what Miss Lethbridge
calls her private history,? replied Wendy impishly.
"You inquisitive little beggar! ? exclaimed Felicity,
laughing.
" I love mysteries,? confessed Wendy, "and I have
always been curious to know all about Hugh Lethbridge.
Now do tell me Felicity why Airs. Lethbridge is called
Alzss Lethbridge and why she has kept Faerlie?s identity
from the school ?and why . . . . ?
" Here! Wait a minute! ? protested Felicity as she
pulled her chair close. " The story starts long before
Faerlie?s or Hugh Lethbridge?s advent, but first I must
tell you why the Head is allowing you the privilege of
being the first to hear what, next term, will be common
knowledge.?
" Yes, I?ve wondered that,? said Wendy thoughtfully.
It is not as though I am a prefect or even a very old
girl . . . . ?
"It is because you saved her daughter?s life,? said
Felicity gravely. "Aunt Erica thinks such a lot of her
little Faerlie and . . . . ?
" aunt erica! ? exclaimed Wendy, staring. " Why do
you call her that? ?
" I always do out of school hours,? said Felicity


hurriedly. " I forgot for the moment. But let me tell
you the facts or it will be tea-time before I?ve finished.?
Settling herself comfortably, Felicity told her tale.
" Marjorie has often told you the story of Erica Winter
and the stained glass window in Chapel. How she saved
the life of the grand-daughter of the benefactor of
Winterton ?Edgar Maine? ?
" Yes, Felicity.?
" That child,? said Felicity slowly and with some
emotion, "was Felicity Filmore-Danvers.?
" you!?
" Yes. My maternal grandfather is Edgar Maine and
Erica Winter, to whom I owe my life and Winterton
its very existence, is?or rather was ?Miss ?or rather
Mrs. Lethbridge ?the Head! ?
" Erica Winter is Erica Lethbridge! ? cried Wendy in
amazement. " Oh! Felicity ?how marvellous! ?
" I think she is marvellous! ? said Felicity with feeling.
" But to continue. As you know, the last Winterton
heard of her was when she went to England to study at
Oxford. My ?my grandfather helped her to do that.
He is very fond of me and he felt he could never repay
Aunt Erica for what she did for me.?
"At Oxford she gained her B.A. degree and grand-
father then wanted her to come back here and become
Head-Mistress of Winterton for he knew that that was
her dearest wish. However, Aunt Erica thought other-
wise. She knew herself to be too young and inex-
perienced to be in charge of a school then, so she refused
grandfather?s offer and took positions teaching in several
big English girls? schools.?


" Twelve months before war broke out she met Hugh
Lethbridge and married him almost immediately. On
the day war was declared Faerlie was born. Two days
later, Hugh was ordered abroad with the R.A.F. It was
then that Aunt Erica, left with her young baby, decided
to return to Australia because of the danger of bombing
in England.?
" She arrived in Australia early in 1940. Grandfather
met her at the port and Was shocked at her state of
nerves. She was worrying a lot over her husband as not
a word, not a letter or card, had reached her since his
departure, and he had been reported 'amongst those
missing?.?
" Poor Miss Lethbridge! ? said Wendy.
" Yes, it was rather ghastly for her,? nodded Felicity.
" Of course she realised that she was probably not any
worse off than thousands of other women, but all the
same she knew that if she was to keep her sanity she
must have her mind occupied. It was at that time,
fortunately, that the Head-Ship of Winterton fell vacant,
and the board of governors, urged by grandfather Maine
and daddy, offered it to Aunt Erica. She accepted
eagerly. It had, as I have said before, always been her
wish to return to her old School, so she found a reliable
baby nurse for Faerlie, established them in the cottage
down the road here, and took over her new duties.?
" It did wonders for her and she in return, did wonders
for Winterton. The School had got a bit slack under
Miss Grey, our former Head, who had been ill for over
twelve months, but Aunt Erica soon put it back on its
old basis as the leading girls? school in Australia. And,
immersed in her work, she soon got a grip on her nerves


and was able to keep an eye on Faerlie at the same
time.?
" But why ?? broke in Wendy, " did she call herself
Aliss Lethbridge? ?
" Well, the Governors thought and Aunt Erica thought
that it would sound better if the Head-Mistress was a
' Miss? and also ?? Felicity smiled. "Also, Aunt Erica
was modest. She knew that the stained glass window
was in Chapel and she knew that her story was written
in the ' Records of Winterton? and she thought that if
she called herself Mrs. Lethbridge some curious spirits
who knew her name was Erica ?like yourself for in-
stance, Wendy ?may possibly put two and two together
and find out that she was the former Erica Winter.?
" Well what of it? ? asked Wendy bluntly. "It is a
story to be proud of.?
"Yes, but Aunt Erica said she wanted to make the name
of Erica Lethbridge pull its own weight, independent of
her fame as Erica Winter. As it was, no one connected
Aliss Erica Lethbridge with her maiden name.?
"Anyway . . . . ? as Wendy seemed about to interrupt
again. "Anyway that was her idea and the governors
approved of it.?
" The rest you can guess. Hugh Lethbridge was reported
killed in action last year. Aunt Erica suffered greatly ?
I doubt if she will ever quite get over it ?she loved him
dearly and she had so little time with him, but she finds
great consolation in the growth of her little daughter
and will be happier when, next year she is at school
and right under her eye.?
" How glad I am that she didn?t lose Faerlie too! ? said
Wendy fervently.


" Yes,? said Felicity, " the Head will always be deeply
grateful to you Wendy for your brave act, just as my
people are to her for what she did for me over seventeen
years ago.?
" Rubbish! ? said Wendy. " There?s no comparison.?
" Miss Lethbridge thinks your deed was the greater,?
said Felicity.
"And what do you think, Felicity? ?
"I? I think I feel deeply grateful to you both Wendy.
I am grateful to and I love Aunt Erica very dearly. For
her sake, because I love her and wish only the best for
her ?I am grateful to you for saving Faerlie! ?
Wendy blushed with pleasure and embarrassment but
she hastily brought the subject back from herself.
" I think it is a wonderful story but a sad one and I
I think Miss Lethbridge is?is just marvellous. The
other girls will, too, when they know her story.?
" They do now. I think everyone at Winterton admires
the Head without knowing her as Erica Winter. But of
course, now that Faerlie is to enter the new nursery
school they would soon have found out all about it.?
" Why,? asked Wendy, "does Faerlie call her mother
'Ricky???
Felicity laughed.
" She always has, the young monkey. She says she likes
it better, and Aunt Erica has never persuaded her other-
wise because of the danger of the girls overhearing her
if she said ' mummy? on her visits to the school.?
" What will she call her at school? ?
" Miss Lethbridge I should think. The Head can?t see
any reason to change her name on the prospectus now
that her husband is dead, and she says that in school


hours Faerlie is to be treated exactly as any other girl.?
" In that case I can see squalls ahead for Miss Faerlie
Lethbridge when she is a little older,? grinned Wendy.
" She is not particularly obedient at present, is she? ?
? No,? agreed Felicity grimly, "as the Head found the
other day to her cost ?or rather your cost. However,
Winterton will alter all that. Winterton brings out the
best in most girls.?
"At times,? said Wendy soberly, " it brings out the
worst.?
" What do you mean? ? asked Felicity sharply on the
defensive for her school.
" Well ?I?ve shown my worst side pretty often.?
Felicity?s drawn brows straightened. She laid a hand on
the younger girl?s shoulder as she rose to go.
" You have also shown your best side,? she replied
gently. "And I know that with such a wonderful school
to work for, you will go on giving your best to her.?
" I will,? promised Wendy with shining eyes as she took
Felicity?s capable hand. ? I will Felicity, for like you ?
and ?Erica Winter ?I love Winterton now.?
? Good for you kiddie! ? said Felicity warmly as she left
the room.


CHAPTER FIFTEEN
TO THE MEMORY OF WENDY MURPHY
Wendy recovered sufficiently to return home for the
Easter holidays but the doctors forbade her return to
school for the next term. Although she seemed quite like
her old self, they were not inclined to allow her to take
any risks after such severe head injuries. So, at the time
when all her school-mates were returning to Winterton
for the autumn term, Wendy with her mother, was
embarking on a trip to Tasmania.
It was a lovely holiday. The comfortable ship crossed
from the mainland in two days and they had three lazy
weeks in Hobart after which they travelled by service-car
to Launceston, Burnie and Lindisfarne. Wendy loved
Tasmania. The little isle had such a dreamy air about
it despite the nearness of the war and the fresh English-
looking countryside had a special appeal for her.
She returned home towards the middle of August,
greatly revived and ready to return to Winterton for the
last term of the year.
On a sunny September day, she once more put on her
blue and brown uniform. She felt proud of it now and
there was never any doubt that it suited her. On the
whole, bronzed by long hours in the sun, her brown curls
shining she looked an attractive figure.
There was an air of mystery in the Floral Dormitory
when she arrived there after the Re-Assembling. Pat
and Pam were obviously bubbling over and Marjorie
and Joan seemed to be at their wits? end to keep the
twins from blurting out some secret. Jennifer, Betty and
Mary were also to be seen whispering in their corner of
the room.


Wendy smiled tolerantly. Apparently something was
afoot and she supposed she?d hear about it due course.
The girls had all greeted her effusively on her return
and she was feeling very happy to be back. As she
remarked to Marjorie. " Holidays can get a bit tiring
after a while.?
As she unpacked she chatted away to her friend telling
her all about Tasmania and receiving bits of school news
in return.
"And just fancy Miss Lethbridge turning out to be Erica
Winter,? chimed in Pat, whereupon her twin got a fit
of giggles and was ushered out of the cubicle.
"Whatever is the matter with you all!? demanded
Wendy. " There is a feeling as though you are all
bubbling over with some secret. If you hadn?t had a
whole term to get over it, I would think from Pam?s
giggles that you were still marvelling at the story of
Erica Lethbridge.?
"We are!? laughed Pat. "And it is connected with
that ?our secret I mean,? she hinted darkly, but received
such a kick from Jennifer that she finished her sentence
with a loud. "Wow! . . . . ?
Wendy shrugged.
" Beginning-of-term fever I think. But you might tell
me your secret. Everyone seems to be in the know but
poor little me! ?
"We?ll tell you tomorrow!? promised Marjorie
soothingly.
" Why ?tomorrow? ?
" Because we have promised to keep it a secret until
then.?


" Oh ?alright! ? replied Wendy, a bit nettled. " Keep
your silly old secret if you like.?
Betty looked anxious at her tone and diplomatically
changed the subject.
" We?ve got twenty little girls in the nursery school
Wendy,? she volunteered.
Wendy looked interested.
" Yes. How is it going? ? she asked eagerly. " Marj.
told me in her letter that it had a full complement of
pupils.?
" I?m sure Marj. said nothing of the sort,? put in Pat
wickedly and her eyes danced as Wendy swung round
indignantly.
" She did ?so there! Didn?t you Marj.? ?
Marjorie laughed merrily.
" Pat?s only teasing, Wendy old thing. She means that
I am not capable of using such high-faluting phrases as
'complement of pupils? you know.?
" Oh,? Wendy laughed. "Anyway, to use simple
language, since Pat Greenwood seems incapable of
understanding anything else ?how is the imp scratching
along? ?
" The imp? ?
" Faerlie Lethbridge of course. She looks an imp.?
" She is one! ? quoth Mary grimly. " She?s up to all the
mischief ever created.?
" Why? What does she do? ? asked Wendy curiously.
" Well one morning,? laughed Mary reminiscently,
"She somehow contrived to give the N.S. Mistress the
slip and the next thing we knew she was hiding in the
stationery cupboard in our class-room.?
" Whatever was she doing there? ?


" That?s what Miss Leth. wanted to know,? grinned
Jennifer, taking up the tale. " The Head was taking us
for English that morning and she couldn?t make out
what the noises were coming from the corner of the
room.?
" The cupboard is just near my seat,? put in Marjorie
ruefully, "and three times the Head told me to stop
shuffling my feet. I said that I hadn?t shuffled them ??
"And if Faerlie hadn?t at that moment upset a bottle of
ink over herself the Head would have frankly dis-
believed Marj.,? chimed in Pam appreciatively. " For-
tunately, for Marj., Faerlie decided then that things were
a bit uncomfortable in the cupboard and she emerged
" Covered in blue-black ink from head to foot,?
chuckled Pat.
? What did the Head say? ? cried Wendy, laughing
merrily at the prospect.
? Say? She didn?t have a chance to say anything,?
giggled the twins. " For Faerlie just threw herself, ink
and all at her mother. Result ?two inky figures repair-
ing to the bathroom at top speed! ?
" She?s an imp all right,? said Marjorie as the laughter
subsided. " One day she painted all the other nursery
school kids with red sol-pah. You never saw such a mess.
It was in their hair and ears and everywhere.?
"And then at prayers one day she stole in quietly while
we were all on our knees, and jumped on the Head?s
back as she knelt and pretended she was riding her horse.
While the chaplain was praying for the sick and suffer-
ing, Faerlie was calling out ' Gee up!
Wendy gasped.


" Heavens! What an infant! I can foresee some fun
with Faerlie Lethbridge at Winterton.?
"We?ve seen some already! ? chorused the others as
they went down to tea.
At tea, Wendy encountered more mystery. As she
entered the room every eye seemed turned upon her and
to her astonishment, Betsy Liddicombe the House-
Captain, came up to her with a smile.
" I?ve saved a seat for you at the prefects? table tonight
Wendy. We?d like to have you sitting with us if you
don?t mind.?
" Why? ? asked Wendy bluntly, staring. Prefects didn?t
usually request Middle School girls to dine with them.
" Oh,? said Betsy, "we?d think it an honour! ?
"An honour! ? Wendy stared again. Could serious
Betsy Liddicombe be ragging her ? But at that moment,
Tessa Malcolm, another House Prefect joined her.
" Come on Wendy. You are to sit next to me. I?ll
remember it always! ?
" Remember what? ?
" That you sat next to me tonight,? said Tessa beaming.
Wendy followed the prefects dumbly. Whatever was
the matter with everyone ? She had to obey the prefects
she supposed, but it seemed daft to her and she did wish
the girls wouldn?t stare so. She examined herself sus-
piciously in the long mirror as she passed. Her uniform
seemed to be all right. What were they staring at?
She felt most uncomfortable all through the evening,
and at breakfast the next morning. Wherever she went
the girls stared. It was most annoying and she was glad
to reach the sanctuary of Chapel. Surely they wouldn?t
stare here? But they did. Necks were craned. Even


girls from other Houses were staring. To take her mind
off herself Wendy looked up at the row of stained glass
window's. Her eyes rested affectionately on the one to
Erica Winter and roved along the others ?
"To the memory of Margaret Yeoman? ?Margaret ?
Maggie Yeoman had been a maid at Winterton ?no, it
wasn?t only pupils who Were eligible for these honours
?Maggie had held the fort in the domestic quarters
when every other maid had gone on strike, and had then
had to leave Winterton because those were the only
terms upon which the domestics would take up their
duties again?Maggie died of consumption because she
was unable to get another job in that year of depression
?and inadequate food and ill-ventilated rooms had
helped her to contract the disease. The authorities at
Winterton never knew of her plight until too late!
Wendy?s eyes roved on as the organ played softly ?
"Eleanor Ashton? Eleanor had saved a girl from
drowning ....
" Denise McCullum? ?an old scholar and nurse ?who
had been killed in a far-away mission station in Japan ?
killed ruthlessly because she, in her own words, would
not forego the religion and ethics that her old school had
taught her ....
And so they went on ?all had directly or indirectly
added lustre to their school ?right up to 1940 ?Sandra
Catt ?who in many small ways upheld so brightly the
flaming honour of the school.
But what was that last one? Wendy sat forward in her
seat to examine the last window of all ?shrouded by
the folds of the Australian flag. That hadn?t been there
before.


Suddenly she felt a nudge and rose hastily as the choir,
followed by the chaplain and Miss Lethbridge entered
from the vestry.
" We love the place O God,? began the choir.
" Wherein thine honour dwells;? joined the school.
" The joy of thine abode
" All earthly joy excels.?
This hymn with which they always began any service at
Winterton drew to a close and they then sang the special
one for beginning-of-term: ?
" Lord behold us with Thy blessing
Once again assembled here;
Onward be our footsteps pressing
In Thy love and faith and fear .
The school knelt to pray and then with the minimum of
noise possible to so many girls, they all seated them-
selves as the Head-Mistress, contrary to the usual custom,
established herself in the pulpit.
" Girls, I know that you are all, with the exception of
one, awaiting anxiously my announcement this morn-
ing.?
She paused and Wendy listening with a sense of
bewilderment (what was Miss Lethbridge talking
about?) ?was still bewildered and not a little em-
barrassed and annoyed to find her immediate neighbours
and almost everyone else besides, craning their necks to
stare again! She looked fixedly at the Head, standing
way up there in the pulpit and tried to forget that she
seemed to be the cynosure of all eyes.
The Head was smiling.
"You all know ?except the girl concerned ?that today
I have the honour and privilege of unveiling yet another


stained glass window to the memory of a girl who has
added lustre to the noble name of Winterton School.?
A wave of excitement ran along the pews of girls at her
words and Wendy gasped loudly and with delight. She
only just restrained herself from remarking loudly to
Marjorie:
" I say what a thrill! I never thought to see an unveiling
in my time. Who can it be? ?
She was soon to receive the answer to her unuttered
question. That answer dumbfounded her.
" In accordance with our custon,? the Head was saying
in her clear voice, " I will ask the Head-Prefect of
Winterton to take her place at the front of the flag-
draped window. She will represent Winterton! ?
Felicity as she obeyed, looked the very symbolisation of
the school she represented. Erect and neat, her physique
moulded and shaped by years of school games and
physical culture, her skin browned by the Australian
sun, her uniform smart and flawless to the last detail,
she stood, head slightly thrown back ?looking the sum
total of all the ideals of Australian girl-hood.
Already on one side of the flag stood the school chaplain,
white-haired and rather like a venerable angel in his
white surplice ?the ordained minister of God.
And on the other side stood somebody?s brother, re-
splendent in the blue uniform of the R.A.A.F. ?the
representative of Empire.
They stood waiting ?the representative of Winterton
linked by the representatives of God and Country for
the unveiling of the stained glass window in memory
of ... .
" Wendy Murphy! ? announced the Head triumphantly.


" In recognition of her two acts of great courage in the
first term of this year. First, the act of her capture of
Japanese spies whereby she put her country before her-
self. And secondly ? ? Miss Lethbridge?s voice shook
slightly "And secondly the act whereby at risk of her
own life she saved that of Faerlie Lethbridge. Wendy
Murphy come forward! Come forward so that all may
see in full view the girl who has thus so honoured her
School! ?
Wendy did not move. Her hands gripped the hard
wood of the seat convulsively and tears of wonder and
bewilderment stood in her eyes. It couldn?t be Wendy
Murphy Miss Lethbridge was calling for once more!
" Wendy ?come along dear! Up here with me! ?
Marjorie?s shaking hands propelled her upright.
" Go on Wendy dear! ?
Wendy walked forward in a dream that made her forget
her usual self-consciousness. The Head?s hand helping
her up the stairs of the pulpit steadied her somewhat.
Only then, as she stood in full view of her school, side
by side with she, who had been Erica Winter, did she
realise that she was not in a dream.
Miss Lethbridge was speaking again, one hand resting
proudly on Wendy?s shoulder.
" Girls, I present to you in this House of God at Winter-
ton School, one whom we wish to commemorate by the
unveiling of a stained glass window. Girls ? WENDY
murphy!?
The girls rose to their feet as with a triumphant rattle
the Australian flag was drawn from the far window.
A gasp went round. There, glittering with the colours
of brilliant red, white and blue was exposed to view


the stained glass window in memory of wendy
murphy!
" You will observe the design of the window,? came the
Head?s voice once more. "At the top ?the Figure of
Christ surrounded by the little children and the text:
' Suffer little children to come unto Me.? This is meant
to represent the brave act that Wendy performed when
she saved the life of ?my small daughter.?
Miss Lethbridge winked the tears from her eyes and
looked with the School towards the window again.
"At the bottom ?the figures of St. George and the
Dragon ?representing Wendy?s service to the Empire
by her capture of the Japanese spies.?
To Wendy?s astonishment and annoyance she found
tears of joy surging down her cheeks as the girls broke
into the hymn for St. George?s Day: ?
"Jesus, Lord of our salvation
For thy warrior, bold and true,
Now accept our thankful praises
And our strength do Thou renew,
That, like George, with courage dauntless
We may all our foes subdue.?
The tears were still there as Miss Lethbridge gently led
her down to gaze with wondering eyes at that beautiful
window upon which her name was inscribed in gold.
'' For the future generations of Winterton girls to
remember you by Wendy. Your story will go down in
the ' Records of Winterton?.?
"But I don?t deserve it do I?? whispered Wendy
shakily.
" I think you do Wendy! ? answered Erica Lethbridge
nee Winter as she squeezed her pupil?s arm re-assuringly.


CHAPTER SIXTEEN
" THEY ALSO SERVE
Assembly followed in Main School. You couldn?t cheer
in Chapel and Miss Lethbridge knew the girls must
cheer. So Assembly followed after the unveiling.
Wendy stood with the prefects on the dais and with a
swimming head heard again that she was the heroine of
Winterton. Cheer upon cheer rent the air in Main Hall
and the loudest of them all came from Felicity Filmore-
Danvers beside whom Wendy stood.
The School Song was sung over and over again.
" There?s a School in Australia
Land of the free ?
Where young girls of Australia
All learn the decree: ?
That God?s Love is the highest
Of gifts on this plane,
Much higher than any
Material gain.
"It is here that they learn
To be moderate too,
And to do what is honourable
Gracious and true.
To love next to God
Australia their own
In conjunction with Britain ?
Little grey island Home! ??


" And the name of this School
Will ring down the years;
Tales of past girls and present
As the future appears.
Out of the mist we will hear the proud cry
Of ?' WINTERTON FOR EVER! ? ?
Soaring up to the sky.?
Up to the sky indeed soared the voices of Winterton
that morning, but it might have been ?" Wendy for
ever! ? just at that time, for every eye was turned to the
little brown-haired figure standing so diffidently on the
platform.
At its conclusion, Miss Lethbridge held up her hand and
the young voices gradually subsided.
" Girls,? said the Head gently. " For half an hour in
Chapel and here you have paid homage to Wendy
Murphy. Wendy has deserved that homage for she has
added lustre to the name of her School. Now, I am
going to ask you to pay homage to another girl who is
leaving Winterton at the end of this term.?
She paused and as she paused, she noted gravely the
bewilderment upon the upturned faces of her pupils.
" Before I name that girl for whom I solicit your homage
I would like to say a few words on the subject of ?
greatness.?
'' Greatness for me is divided into two categories. In
the first category I place ?Recognised Greatness ?which
all the world sees clearly and acknowledges by a fanfare
of trumpets. Under the heading of recognised greatness
we list the names of our brave winners of the Victoria
Cross and other medals. In the little world of Winter-


ton we list the names of the girls who, like Wendy today,
receive acknowledgement by stained glass windows ?
we list these girls under the heading of recognised great-
ness. To these people, the V.C. winners of the world
and the Wendy Murphy?s of Winterton, all honour and
glory be given certainly ?they have done their duty
nobly, but now, what of the second category of great-
?> >
" For you know there is a second category and I am
quite convinced that it is perhaps, more wonderful than
the first. I refer to the people who serve their God or
their Country or their School in dull, very often unrecog-
nised ways. Under the heading of unrecognised
greatness then, I list a much bigger number of people
who, by their very strength and unobstrusiveness keep
our country or our school together.?
" I refer to the people who day by day work to keep
the wheels of civilisation going and the wheels of school
running?the domestic who washes our cups and plates
?the farmer who tills our soil ?the soldier, sailor or
airman who fights in the slush and slime of foreign
lands, seas or skies for small wages and little recognition
?and in school, the girls who by honourable hard work
keep places like Winterton together.?
Miss Lethbridge paused and the girls waited expectantly
for her next words: ?
" They also serve, who only stand and wait. Remember
that, girls. Those people serve all the time ?as ?Felicity
Filmore-Danvers has served Winterton ever since she
first came as a child of barely six years of age until this
term when she stands before you all as Head-Girl of


Winterton. Girls, I call now for three cheers for Felicity
Filmore-Danvers! ?
The cheers broke out afresh ?louder perhaps, and more
enthusiastic, for Felicity was indeed tried and true to
most of her school-mates.
And Wendy Murphy, she who had doubted and at times
even hated the Head-Girl, cheered at the very top of
her voice.
For once, in the World of School at least, unrecognised
greatness was receiving its fanfare in the silver
trumpets of the voices of the Girls of Winterton!
And she, who for so long had been listed under
recognised greatness Erica Winter Lethbridge
smiled across at Felicity Filmore-Danvers and their
eyes met over the brown head of Wendy Murphy in
a look of complete understanding.
