THE
HISTORY
OF
BERNARD REILLY.
NEAR this Town I was born and bred,
My Father was a Carpeter by Trade,
1 .was sent to school and educated well.
As many in this town can tell,
At sixteen years of age I ran away,
And with my parents did no longer stay,
For I had staid at home from school that morn,
And home in the evening I dare not return,
I went without delay then thro’ the town,
Where company enough I shortly found,
And to my misfortune, being easy led,
With wicked thoughts they tilled my head,
A handsome Female, but of broken fame,
Did first delude me till I was lost to shame ;
Strong liquor they did largely give to me.
So that the bolder I might growing be,
Next by a well known snib to rob I learned.
And had to give him half of what I earned.
By day we went about in close disguise,
And in each quarter had our secret spies.
Some drest likejockies some like countrymen
And some like sailors just come from the main
Thus we our plans did lay in broad daylight,
Then went to make our deaths at dead of night
We had our places to conceal our store,
And.brought them out when all was o’er, ,


To markets and to fairs, we went likewise,—
We robbed the farmers there before their eyes
Sometimes played cards, and sometimes dice,
And purchased pleasure then at any price,
But short and dangerous was my wide career,
As shortly will to all your eyes appear.
Three of us did agree to take the road,
Our pistols we with double balls did load.
A wealthy cattledrover to waylay,
Whom we had set upon that very day.
We dogged him on the night so dark came on,
When we attacked the drover one by one,
His pocket book we forced him to give.
And fifty pounds beside to let him live,
We then proceeded in to town quick as thought
But soon were found and unto justice brought,
Unto the Jail they took us then,
And shut us up in that most dismal d en,
Where we deplored our fate for 3 mo n ths long,
Cnufinedin dismal walls both high an d strong,
Before old Judge M’Lelljand we wer e tried,
And two of us were soon identified.
The other two by false swearing got away,
But we, our companions would not betray,
Had we been sentenced on the tree to die,
We would have kept it dark most faithfully,
At length Judge address’d ns in a solemn strain.
Saying, you are 2 young but very wicked men,
And for thecrirne of which yon guilty stand,
I’m forced to send you from your native land,
For fourteen years to climes beyond lbe s eas,
VWbere you may soomamend if you please*)


<on-carts the straight way chained n« an-! ®,
''With convicts clothes we were a niotlv new,
<Onr fathers and mothers flocked around—
Their tears in torrents fell upon the ground.
To see their children a tearing,from t heir home,
To distant lands unhappy slaves to roam,
1 thought my heart that day with crief would break,,
When tiiey came tome their last farewell to take,
Wc were then shipped on hoard the hulk at Cork,
And used far worse than any Jew <>r Turk,
Then in the transport fettered all in pairs,
loir seven long months the chains we had to wear
'Under the hatches wc were closely pent,
W here we our wicked lives (lid sore repent,
Our food was bad and scanty too hesfde—
The sick men’s soup and biscuit we’d divide.
On one-half pint of water in the day,
•Qur burning thurst at noon for to allay,
We could not stand upstrait nor lie at ease,
So we took ciantps in both ourarms and knees,
At last the seamen did the laud descry,
J!tn then 1 thought on old Ireland with a sigh,
A ; Mohan town we got on shore at last,
Anil in a tail that night we were confined fast—
• Onr heads were shaved our clothes then changed ,
Then in rows along the halls then-ranged,
Until the Governor did u, review.
And ’till onr several names and trades he knew,
When lids was douche hiu ns all prepare,
i-'ur business next day let it be foul or fair,
The prisoners in the cells of the same jail,
-Onr clothes that night did come and steal,
'Like horses they examined wind and limb,
U hen a gentleman said I was the man lor him.,
Then straightway in a Waggon I was taken,
'i o the estate where I had to remain,
The rest were sent to different parts to toil,
><mie at their trades and some to till the soil,
il'rojn sunrise in the morning we are hound,
To labour.like negroes till the sun goes dmvu,


’Our fares all were blistered with the sun,
And the field-flies our helpless bodies stung:,
And yet we dare not ask leave to rest,
Tho’ with labour are sore distressed,
The overseer with watchfulness stood by,
Kept us to our task both low and high,
At night when from the fields did return.
We had to grind the master’s corn,
Watermills are scarce and far away,
Which makes our weary carcases to pay,
I ill eleven o’clock we had to turn the meal,
r i hen when in our beds our sores we feel,
ust sis hours sleep we are allowed,
The hell at sunrise rings their notes so loud,
Let those foolish young men at home beware,
They little know what the poorconvits bear,
Wheti from our native land are exiled,
To slave in countries where the men run wild,
Like beasts of burden must bear the load,
Or by the lash our master will us goad,
Some of ray old acquaintances here I met,
Whose cheeks in tears for their young days is wet,
They told me if they got at home once more.
Their former dreadful course they’d give o'er.
Lamenting that they brought their parents down,
With grief to their graves their deeds to crown.
And brought themselves to slavery and shame,
Wlifti they mijht have acquired an honest tame,
iVndinight have lived in honesty and peace,
Instead of running to sin and disgrace,
There’s some to the gallows sacrifice their lives,
And send to beggary their children and wives,
Some to Van Dieman’s Laud (or lile are sent,
Where they their wicked lives do sore repent,
Some for seven and som; tor fourteen years,
To bemoan their fate in misery and tears,
When they’re there their fortune they may curse*
I or if in jail they could not be worse,
dl to the mountains they run and hide,
They must then ,go without house or guide,


iii danger of wild beasts and men as wild, —
From friends and country doubly then exiled,
'1 bese hapless,men then take to rob and steal.
And vengeance on the helpless setilers deal.
They hum their housesand their goods away
i n hiding places in the Woods convey,
Then one hundred pounds the governor gives,
To those who capture them dead or alive,
And fifty more tor leaders of the gang,
Whose bodies on the shore ia chains they hang,
A w arning to be to all convicts sent there,
Of such a punishment for to beware,
I f we commit a fault they are severe ;
For disobedience we are confined one year,
And 2 for petty theft it is ordained,
For those that cannot he reclaimed.
And if their theivery they do repeat.
Their liberty for life they then forfeit,
And when this sentence on a convict passed,
All favour here from his master is lost,
Three men from Cavan end one from Leitrim town.
One morning in the Black Wood by chance was found.
Their bodies putrifying in the sun,
As part of life remained in only one,
Their frames by hunger reduced to hone and skin,
Like skeletons they seemed so lank and thin,
For they had lived three weeks on little meat,
And for five days they nothing had to cat.
They laid them down beneath a tree to die,
Lamenting that they to the Woods did fly ;
One of them did recover and they told him soon,
That life’s long slavery is to be his doom.
My master was a wealthy Gentleman,
Mr. Luke Dillon a transport from Dublin,
One hundred crown slaves are on bis estate.
And those of good behaviour he did treat,
With kindness and attention. Wages good he gave,
And told us carefully our store to save,
Solthatthcy might return home free,
And of our muster independent be,


Fftr Government our passage liame don't pay* ,
Then We must save to get ourselves away,,
For 20 pounds they have to lender down,
in any vessel home for England bound,
There’s some spend all their money on the shore,-
And by the time is out they then deplore,
For they are compelled to Work or starve.
And that is just what such bad men deserve,
If We do get lazy, or they do suspect,
We’ll.run off, or catch ns in the act,
They’ll chain usseperately to several logs,
As they at home chain mastiffs and hull-dogs ;
To keep us to our Work they guard us close,
And if they muraier of the lash they get a dose.
Thank God my fourteen years are gone and past.
And I'm on Irish ground arrived at last,
1 hope my exile to me good sense to learn,
in honesty my daily bread to earn.
I have soinemouev saveji that will support,
My aged mother, whose days are short,
When 1 came home my friends all leaped for joy, .
To see once more returned their convict boy,
1 am happy blown by their Southen Gales,
From that land of Heathen called South Wales,
Let this to all young men a caution be,
To avoid night rambling and bad company,
Lest they should meet the same unlrappy fate,
And rue like me when it might be too late.


THE HORRORS OF
TRANSPORTATION.
The Picture the Rev. W. Ullathorne, D.D. Vicar-General
of New Holland and Van Deiman’s Land; give-; of the suf-
ferings of the Convicts, at the Penal settletne«t.Sv Norfolk
Island, Moreton Bay, and Port Arthur, is truly horrifying.
The Convicts Work in chain gangs, and are subject to the
application of the lash, at the will of the overseer. And at
night and on Sundays are locked in square portable boxes,
sixteen being Granted together in a space considerably le*s-
than two feet square for each person—the food on Norfolk
Island ia salt meat and maize bread : and mark the reckless-
ness of life induced by the dreadful suffering:—“ 80 indif-
ferent even has life become, that murders are committed in
cold blood : the murderer afterwards dec taring that he hail
no had feeling against his victim, hut that his sole object was
to obtain his own release. Lots are cast; the man on whom
it fell committed thodeecl, his comrades being w itnesses for
the sole view of being taken for a time from the scene of
their daily misseries to appear at a Court in Sidney, although
after the execution of their comrade, they knew they should
he remanded to their former haunts of Wretchedness.” —
And the Rev. Mr. M'Everal declares, that of seventy-four
he seen executed in four years, “ Many declared on the
Scaffold that they preferred death to being sent to Norfolk.
