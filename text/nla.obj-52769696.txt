COSTUMES.
MEN.
1. The Warden is a mature man, between fifty and
sixty. He should be of stalwart proportions, has been a
soldier accustomed to command and to be obeyed. He
speaks brusquely and imperiously. Undress officer’s
uniform.
2. Lord Glendargle is a handsome manly “Johnnie,”
slender and of middle height, distinguished by a certain air
of distinction though without an atom of “side.” He is
a man of thirty-five, light brown hair and moustache.
Ist Dress. —A light tweed suit, rather soiled, a soiled lawn
tennis shirt, yellow boots, and brown felt hat. 2nd Dress.
—Act V. Frock coat, white vest, light trousers, white hat,
and wedding favour.
3. Yon Swop, a German speculator. A man of sixty,
with pronounced features. Ist Dress.' —A vest of opal
velvet is festooned with huge chains, and there is a great
diamond stud in his shirt front. A pickle cabbage necktie,
white hat with a broad black band. A flaming crimson silk
handkerchief continually in evidence. When he is not
smoking a cigar he is taking snuff. His hands are covered
with rings. He carries a pocket-book full of bank notes,
attached to a chain in his pocket. 2nd Dress. —Change for
wedding—equally loud toned, a crimson vest, etc.
4. Big Ben. —A handsome, stalwart, broad-chested, finely
proportioned man of forty, bronzed and bearded. His
hair has been a golden brown, and though streaked with
grey here and there, catches the sun, and retains traces of
its former beauty. When he makes his first appearance his
hair and beard are matted, his eyes bloodshot and inflamed.
His whole appearance indicates that he has been drinking,
and is under the influence of liquor. His manner though
brusque, abrupt, and taciturn has a certain air of dis-
tinction, and he is at all times a gentleman. He is sobered
the instant Sybil appears; from that time to the end of the
play he “casts his nighted colour off,” and is himself again.
Whenever he appears he dominates the Scene. Ist Dress.
—That of an ordinary digger. Leather hunting jacket,


grey flannel garibaldi, heather-brown knickers, old riding-
boots, all travel-worn and soiled. Black silk handkerchief
loosely tied round neck, soft brown felt hat. Digger’s rug
and impedimenta for Ist Scene.
5. Sailor Jack. —Tall handsome fellow of five or six and
twenty, fair and bearded. Pfank, open, sailor-like manners,
but a little rough and hot-tempered. Dress —That of a
man-of-war’s, very soiled and worn. Trousers tucked into
a pair of tanned leather leggings which reach up to the knee.
This dress is worn throughout the play—except in Act Y.,
when he changes to light suit for wedding.
6. Yorkshire Dick, a genuine Tyke. Golden hair,
whiskers, and moustache. A sturdily built fellow of five-
and-thirty. He speaks with the accent of the West Riding.
“ Tho’ rugged as his native North, he is as modest as
he is manly, as tender as he is true.” Dress. —Brown
leather jacket and trousers, tucked into leggings of tanned
leather. A garibaldi of dark blue flannel. Act V. In
deep mourning.

8. The Captain. —Tall, handsome, well-preserved man of
five-and-thirty; dark hair, dark military moustache, the
bearing of an indolent soldier—a masher and a lady-killer.
A man who has been a gentleman, and who still maintains the
manners of one. He wears an eyeglass and ■ smokes
cigarettes. He is continually adjusting the one and smoking
the other. Ordinarily he has a languid, insolent manner,
but when roused to wrath he is terribly in earnest. His
insolence and brutality are real, his love-making (notably
Act III.) is false, but earnestly and admirably simulated.

sash round waist. Yellow handkerchief for neck. Brown
knickers. Yellow knee boots. Drab bowler hat. All kept
much more smartly than those of any other man in the field.

a manner brutal and bullying. Dress. Dark woollen
jacket and trousers. Tanned leather leggings. Yellow
garibaldi, striped with black. Black cowboy’s hat.

one of the criminal classes. A beardless young ruffian.

love-locks on either side. Dress. —Brown corduroy jacket
and trousers. Red and black jersey outside trousers.
Yellow and black cap. Trousers and jacket, cut like our
own costers’, and profusely decorated with mother-of-pearl
buttons. 2nd Dress. —In Last Act a grotesquely-cut dress
suit, ever so much too big for him.
11. Wallakoo. —Aboriginal Australian. A proper de-

Scene 1.
The Bar Saloon of Kathleen O’Mam’s Hotel at Coolgardie,
the “ Erin Co Bragh”—a rough log shanty fitted up
with rude furniture. Tables and seats are arranged down
the stage on both sides to accommodate geests. A Bar
is at the R. H. side of the Scene; this is fitted up with the
usual small spirit barrels, decanters, tumblers, glasses,
etc., used during the action ; they are secured to counter
by wires, so that nothing can be upset during change.
Cigar boxes, fusees, and large jug for water are ranged
an the counter for use. The general door of entrance
from the street is placed c. Another door leading to inner
apartments is situated at i.b.e. adjoining the Bar. A
third door is 1.b.1.h.
(When the curtain rises, Jerky, Bendigo Bill, and a
Group of Rough Miners, of all nationalities, are discovered
drinking and smoking, playing at cards and dominoes, noisily
calling for drinks, etc., hammering on the table.)
Music.
Miners. (Give orders together.) Ago of Irish. One of
Scotch for me. Mine’s rum shrub. Gin and bitters. Same
as afore. Stout and bitter, Missis ! Look sharp! Bustle
now ! Stir your stumps !
Kaih. (At counter.) Aist boys, aisy! Remember I have
only one pair of hands. (They all go up to bar for their
glasses, and pay during dialogue.)
Enter Yorkshire Dick l.c.
Dick, (c.) You want somebody to help you, Katty.
Miners. She do ! She do !
Kath. Oh, I shall soon have somebody. My new lady-
help is due to-day.
Omnes. A new lady-help ?


Kath. Yes, she’s coming by train from Albany. See,
this is her photo. {Hands it to Dick.)
Dick. (Coming down o.) My yeyes, mates ! bub she’s a
clipper. ( Showing photo to Miners.)
Miners. {Crowding round to look.) A clipper! A
stunner ! A bloomin’ beaooty ! (All exclaim in admira-
tion.)
Dick. A reg’lar Queen o’ Sheba! ( Returns photo to
Kath.)
Enter Glendargle l.c.
Glen. Hornin’, Dick !
Dick. Morning, my lord ! (r.c.)
Bill. {With a sneer.) My lord ! What’s the good of a
lord at the Gold Fields ! (1.c.)
Glen, (c.) Not much. But, after all, a lord is a man, and
I suppose there’s no harm in that man being a gentleman ?
Jerry, (l. — Impudently intruding—to Glen.) Oh, toast
me for a herring ! I s’pose you call yourself a gentleman ?
Dick. Naa, he doant, but he is one all the same—every
square inch of him.
Bill, (1.c.) Ha ! ha ! gentleman? Pooty gen’leman to
come here and take the bread out o’ the mouths of honest
men.
Jebry. (l.) Ah ! Coves with appetites—twists on ’em all.
Bill. Look y’ere. If so be as you is a lord and a sojer to
boot, why don’t you stick to your trade—mount a red coat,
put a helmet on your nut, a sabre by your side, and “ go
where glory waits you ? ”
Glen. Because I mean to make my pile on this field, even
if I have to make it at the point of the pick-axe.
Bill. You ply a pick-axe ? You—with them fingers ?
Glen. And with these fists, at your service, Mr. ? I
haven’t the pleasure of knowing your name.
Bill. My name is Bendigo Bill. {Xes to r.)
Enter Sailor Jack l.c.
Jack. Bendigo Bill ? Bendigo Bully you mean.
Bill. What—what ? Do you see this ? {Showing fist,
and turning with a roar of rage.)
Jack. And do you feel that ? {Giving him a crack in ihe
face.)
(Bill lets out a roar of rage.)
(All start up and form a circle.)


(Ben enters at c. door. He is a picturesque and striking
figure, his get-up and appearance are a novel feature in the
scene. He carries on hack a prospector's rug, hilly, hammer,
etc. His manner and hearing are brusque to the last degree.
Hair and heard rough and unkempt. All the signs of an
habitual drunkard, but the breeding of a gentleman shines
through it all. At sight of Ben, Bill and Jerry retire l.)
Jack, (1.c.) Hullo ! Old Bruin ! There you are !
Ben. ( Brusquely .) Yes, here I am—Bruin the bear.
(All laugh.)
Jewry. I say, Bill, look out, Bruin bites.
Bill. Then we’d better bunk.
Jerry. Bunked it is.
\Exeunt b.u.e.
Dick, (r.c.) Tight as usual, Ben, eh ?
Ben. Only more so. Began early this morning with a
bottle of whisky.
Dick. Whisky ?
Bex. Well, you see, we were out of water, and as I was
thirsty
Jack. Good old Ben !
Dick. (c. H Iping Ben off with his pack and flinging it off
stage r.h.) What luck, lad?
Ben. Same as usual. Look at this ! ( Takes out lump
of ore.)
Dick. Up to nowt.
Hath. (At bar r.) And what have you done with Myles
Hooligan, Ben ?
Ben. Left him fossicking about a beastly iron blow, but
deuce a smell of gold could I see. (Abruptly.) Give me a
brandy and soda, Katty. It’s dry as a lime kiln I am.
Hath. We’ve neither soda nor water, Ben.
Ben. Then dilute the brandy with whisky. It will go
down the easier. (All laugh.)
Hath. And so would you. Ah, man alive, is it afther
killing you I’d be ?
Ben. (With a hard laugh.) What’s it matter, wench?
I’m no good living. (Bitterly.) The sooner I’m dead the
better.
Kath. Arrah, don’t talk nonsense. A live boy like you
is betther than a dozen dead men. Sure, it’s a bottle of fiz
you’re wantin’, and there it is.
Ben. But I can’t pay you.
Kath. Never mind, pay me when you can —and if you
can’t, sure I’ll never ax you.
Ben. You’re a brick, Kattie.


Glen. (l. Aside.) Dick, a word with you ! (Aside.) Who’s
jour friend yonder ?
Dick. (1.0. Aside.) Why, Big Ben, to be sure.
Glen. (Aside.) Big Ben 1 He used to be Lionel Leigh
in London.
Dick. (Aside.) Lionel Leigh?
Glen. (Aside.) Yes ; one of the best-known men in town,
a great swell at the Bar, a good man gone wrong through a
drunken wife.
Dick. (Aside.) No !
Glen. (Aside.) He disappeared under a cloud; only think
of his turning up here.
Dick. (Aside.) Ah, lad, t’ world is only a little plaace after
all. (They turn aside.)
pp. Music.
(As Ben is standing drinking, swaying by the counter.)
Kath. Ben, here’s a letter for you.
Ben. For me !
Kath. It’s from home.
Ben. Home ?
Kath. (Sympathetically.) Yes, lad, but sure it’s in mourn-
ing, so it is.
Ben. In mourning? (Takes letter, mechanically eyeing the
black border, then looks at post-mark and starts into c. , opens
letter eagerly and reads, gives a sigh of relief. )
(Silence — Every eye fixed on Ben during this business.)
pp. Music ends.
Dick. (l. Noting action.) No bad news, old man ?
Ben. (Suddenly changing manner.) Bad news? No, no !
Blessed news ; the best I’ve had for many a long day !
Dick. I’m glad to hear that. We are all glad to hear
it. Who’s gone under ?
Ben. (c.) One whose death gives me life !
Glen. (Aside to Dick.) He means the drunken wife.
Dick. Hush !
Ben. I was bound to a corpse—a pestilence which
poisoned the springs of life. It has rotted away. The
chains which fettered body and soul are broken. I breathe
—I live—l am a man once more —free ! free ! free ! (Xes
to l. and back to c.)
Jack, (e.) Glad to hear it! Have a drink, old man !
Ben. Aye, aye ! (Goes back to counter.) Here’s “The
Future ! ”
Omnes. Aye, aye ! The future ! (They all drink. Coach
horn is sounded outside.)


Kath. There’s the coach from Southern Cross. Look out,
boys, for my lady-help. (She runs to meet her 1.c.)
Ben. I’m off to-morrow by that same coach.
Jack. Where to, man ?
Ben. To Melbourne.
Jack. To Melbourne ! What to do ?
Ben. To turn a fable into a fact—solve the enigma that
has baffled mankind ever since the world began. I go to
seek—a paradox.
Jack. A para ! What’s that ?
Ben. A constant woman. [Xes down to R. radiant with
hope.)
Jack. (l. laughing.) Ho, ho, ho ! That’s a wild goose
chase, and one a chap had better get screwed to start on !
So take another drink.
Ben. (b. Beekless.) Another? A dozen ! I could drink a
cellar dry to-day, so fill up. Bumpers !
(Lines. Aye, aye ! (They_/iW theik glasses.)
Ben. (r.c.) Here’s luck, lads, luck ! (They are all about

Ben. She ! she ! J Simultaneously.
(At sight of Sybil he is instantly sobered. Up to this
moment he has been more or less slouching about. He now
stands erect, and is radiant with delight.)
Ben. (Sotto voce.) Heaven has taken compassion on my
misery, and sent her to me ! lam the happiest man on the
face of God’s earth. Sybil — l (Approaching her.)
She turns eagerly and delightedly to him when Kathleen
quickly re-enters (1.c.) hearing a child of twelve months in her
arms.)

(Ben stands gloomily ruminating.)
Ben. (l.) My God ! what does it all mean ?
Dick. (c. Who has watched the scene eagerly, Xes to Ben
surprised.) Ben, what’s dreaming abaght ? Thou hast spilt
thy liquor.
Ben. (l.) Damn the liquor !
Dick. Naa, lad, it’s bad to damn good stuff. Have
another glass. (Banding filled glass.)

man, and let us drink “To the Duchess of Coolgardie ! ”

Ben. (Pocketing crown.) You are complimentary.
Capt. Comple— (his rage getting the better of him.) As
for you, you black cuss.
Wall. (Defiantly.) What! what!
Capt. Look out, for I’ll have the crown out of your hide
the next time I come across you. [Exit door R.o.
Wall. ( Goes up to c. vehemently gesticulating and shaking
his fist after Capt.) Ungar gwaba nuhalla —warra —Gangaree

Ben. (1.c.) Better not, lad. The law prefers to do its
own killing ; leave him to Jack Ketch.
Wall. Iss, Massa Ben, so long as Massa Jack Ketch ketch
him and kill him.
Ben. If he catches him he’s sure to kill.
Wall. Yohi! Mundang garoo ! Kill him eber so much
—kill him twice ober.
Ben. That’s a large order. Once will be enough.
Wall. {Gomes down R. 0.) Yohi ! So long as Massa Ketch

Wall. Yaas, sah ! Eber so much, sah !
Ben. Well, then, you shall. {Gives his hand — Wall.
hisses it and starts up in a transport of ddight.)
Wall. Yakhar! Yakhar, likit, likit! {Begins to sing
and dance—pauses exhausted.) Wallaroo’s heart so full, him

Ben. I see—hungry?
Wall. Yohi! Warra baba gangaroo !
Ben. Kangaroo! ( Turns laughing.) A mutton chop
will do you more good, lad. Here, take this ! ( Gives him
a shilling.) Now be off and get outside that chop.
Wall. ( Runs up c. bach down c.) Ah ! silver —queen.
Yaga—yaga ! Gurroo gwaba danugga ! Wallaroo fight for

Fill turn turn, den back quick, less den no time.
[Exit c.r.
Ben. {Solus.) He here ! He of all men. In the old time
he was always buzzing about her, and now—what brings
them together in this remote corner of the earth ? Can it
be that —no, no ! I’ll not believe that, and yet—the child !
the child !
Re-enter Sybil door n. She has removed her outer gar-
ments and is now dressed as barmaid — apron, etc. As she is
going behind counter she sees Ben l.h. and comes forward
R.O.
Sybil, (e.c.) Mr Leigh ! {Cordially offering her hand.)
Ben. {Coldly declining it, 1.c.) Yes, that is my name ;
and yours, madam—yours ?
Sybil. Still Sybil Grey.
Ben. You are not a widow, then ?


Sybil. (Smiling.) One cannot be a widow when one has
never been a wife.
Ben. (Amazed.) Never! Yet that child
Sybil. (Indignantly. ) Sir !
Ben. Enough ! enough 1 the world is wide enough for
you and me. ( Xes to R. and up c.)
Sybil, (1.c.) Wide enough indeed, if this be the measure
of your confidence.
Ben. (c.) Confidence 1 (Bitterly.) I gave you hope—
faith—a life’s devotion ! And you in return have given
me ( Starting up o.) Oh, woman, woman ! God
forgive you !
[Exit hurriedly R.
Sybil. I — l (Angrily.) Yet, what else can he
think ? Well, well, I must bear it as best I may. (Recover-
ing serenity. Xes to L.) But I have no time to waste in
vain regrets, so let me to my work. (She turns up her
sheves and moves towards counter.) Ah ! the water jug is
empty ! I must find the well.
[ Exit l.h. door with jug.
Capt. Oh, shut up ! shut up ! (Without.)
Nell. (Without.) But, Jack
Capt. That’ll do ! that’ll do !
Re-enter the Captain at door R.c. Followed timidly hy
Nellie.
Capt. (r.c.) It’s no use badgering me, my good woman.
Nell, (1.c.) Good woman !
Capt. H’m ! ’Twould be impolite to call you a bad one.
Nell. (Angered.) A bad one ! (Restraining herself.) I
won’t be angry, dear, only tell me where you have been
and what you’ve been doing. For the past three days and
nights I have never even seen or heard of you. All that
time I’ve been alone in those squalid lodgings, penniless
and destitute.
Capt. There —there, that’ll do ! Since we can’t agree,
the best thing we can do is to part.
Nell. What ! what!
Capt. Let’s see how we stand. Assets—ahem! A
budget of lovers’ vows —pretty evenly balanced. On the
one side—a barbarous ruffian, that’s me—on the other—a
frail fair one, that’s you.
Nell. (Weeping.) Oh Jack! Jack! You’ve broken my
heart. (Falls in chair 1.c.)


Capt. (Cynically.) Ah ! Broken hearts are easier mended
than broken teacups, dear.
Nell. (Crying bitterly.) Not mine ! Not mine !
Capt. Don’t snivel, ma’mie. It makes your eyes red,
your nose blue. (Nell ceases to weep.) Ah ! I thought
that would wake you up. Now revenons ! ( Examining
Sold.) Five golden James’s. As I like to be generous I’ll
give you two. ( Puts sovereigns in her hand.) And keep
the balance myself.
Nell. (Dazed.) Money — money! Forme? Forme?
Capt. Oui, pour vois, ma chere ! You are still young
and pretty, and can find heaps of admirers, so go your way,
cherie, and leave me to go mine.
Nell. What do you mean ?
Capt. I mean— l’m tired of you. (Xes down to R.)
Nell. Tired ! (Starts up.)
Capt. Yes, you bore me. So adieu, ma chere ! Bon
voyage !
Nell. (Starting to her feet — indignantly, c.) Take back
your money ! I wouldn’t soil my hands with it to keep me
from starvation. Take it! Take it, I say! (Puts money on
table r. )
Capt. Even in this new El Dorado we don’t pick up golden
Jemmies ready coined in the streets, so by your leave.
(Picks up gold and pockets it.)
(At this moment the backs of both Nell and Capt.
are to Sybil.)
Re-enter Sybil 1.d., returning with jug, which she places
on table l.c.
Sybil (l.h. Turning down her sleeves and wiping her arms
with apron.) Not a drop of water anywhere ! ( Sees the two
pigures.) Ah—customers! What can Ido for
Nell, (c.) That voice ! ( Turning at sound of her voice.)
Sybil!.
Sybil. Nellie! Alive! Alive! Sister! (With a scream
of excitement they rush into each other’s arms, embracing in c.
Sybil puts Nellie to 1., standing between her and Capt.)
Capt. (e, c. Her sister! The devil ! (Aside.) I shall
bave two on my back now instead of one ! I’m off!
(Turns up r.)
Sybil, (c. to Capt. ) Stay ! So, sir, we meet at last !
Capt. Delightful, isn’t it ? Parole d’honneur—you are
more charming than ever.
Sybil, (c.) You presume to speak to me after
Capt. (r.c.) I ought to have spoken to you before — I wish
I had, for you are just the sort of girl I could adore! Milk-


sops are not much in my way. I like ’em spicy, peppery,
fetching—like—like you!
Sybil. How dare you 2
Cbpt. Run away with this young lady 2 Hid I? Well,
after all there’s no great harm done ; so take your soiled
dove back to the family ark—a little damaged, perhaps, but
not in bad condition for a second-hand article.
Bell. (Hushing over strikes him in the face.) Devil —
devil! (He shrugs his shoulders.)
Sybil. (Takesrmuback.) Nelly, for shame. This creature
is beneath your resentment —beneath your contempt!
Capt. Deuced glad to hear it! At your feet, ladies — at
your feet. (Aside.) By Jove ! a splendid get off!
[Exit door B.C.
Sybil, (r.c.) Oh, Nellie! Nellie! For this creature you
have brought yourself to this pass—but you know him now !
Nell, (1.c.) I do. The glamour which blinded me has
vanished, and I loathe where once I loved.
Sybil. Thank God for that, for your emancipation has
already begun. Now for your child !
Nell. Child 2 My child 2 Alas, I have none. When I
awoke from my long fever my darling was dead.
Sybil. Who told you so 2
Nell. He did.
Sybil. The villain lied !
Nell. Lied 2
Sybil. Yes—lied ! He sent the boy to me with news of
your death !
Nell. Mine ! Mine ! (Astonished.)
Sybil. Yes, yotirs. But take heart, for your child lives !
Nell. Lives! (Amazed.)
Sybil. Lives, and is here !
Nell. Here 2 (Still more amazed.)
Sybil. Yes, here, in this very house.
Nell. (With a burst of maternal emotion.) Take, oh, take
me to him! Let me clasp him to his mother’s heart!
Sybil. Come, then, darling, come !

weight.
Dick, (1.c.) Yea, lad, and nearly all pure stuff.
Jack, (r.c.) Well, this takes the biscuit!
Glen, (1.c.) It’s wonderful!
Myles, (c.) I thought it would wipe the cobwebs out of
your eyelashes.
Jerry, (r.) Well, it does, and no flies !
Myles. And there’s lashens more where this comes from.
Omnes. You don’t say so !
Myles. But Ido ! Sure it comes croppin’ up in ridges
like rows of pitaties.
Ben. Of course you secured the claim, Myles? (Abruptly.)
Myles. Av course! Didn’t I find it ?


Ben. Yes, but did you peg it out ?
Myles. Ah, sure—l had no time to stop for thrifles like
pegs.
Ben. Don’t you know that anyone who pegs out before us
can “ jump ” it 1
Myles. The divil they can ! (Alarmed.)
Caet. ( Quickly , aside to Bill and Jerry.) Rather! And
we’re the boys to do it! ( Takes his gang up and bundles
them off K. c.)
Ben. (Quickly.) While you pack up the tools I’ll be off
and hire Bennett’s team and a couple of camels to follow

claim, we haven’t a moment to lose.
[Exit e.c.

Myles. Quarts I Sure it’s gallons, kilderkins, hogsheads.
Kath. (Beckoning on Sybil.) Luk at that jewel—smell it,
(Goes up behind counter.)
Sybil. (Takes it.) And so this is real gold, sir 1
Myles. Faix, you may say that wid your own purty
mouth, Miss.
(Sybil smiles and drops a curtsey as she returns nugget
and goes up to Katty.)
(Aside.) Who is that gorgeous creature, Jack 1
Jack, (1.c.) The Duchess of Coolgardie!
Myles. Begorra ! she luks like a queen, she's that regal.
But who is she at all, at all ?
Jack. (Aside.) Katty’s new lady-help.

shilling cigars.

End oe Scene 1.
(Change to Set in the Wilderness.)
TABLEAU lI.—THE EIGHT FOR THE GREAT
NUGGET.
Scene 2.
The wilderness. This scene, which occupies the whole stage,
should indicate the wild shrub, dense foliage of the
eucalypti and indigenous gum trees of the Australian
regions. Practicable rushes should be set at back to enable
the Capt., Jerry, and Bendigo Bill to hide behind.
The scene begins with characteristic Music which shoidd
suggest the chirping of birds and murmuring of insects
awakening from the- repose and silence of night. The
graduation of light conveys the impression that the day is
breaking in the forest, and the passage of time from one
day to the beginning of another is indicated by skilful
manipulation of mediums, floats, borders, and limelights.
The flaming red sun slowly rises from the horizon.
Music seque to Myles Music.


(Myles descends from eminence 0., plurlcs aside the
rushes, comes forward and “ Gooeys.” Ben, Jack, and
Dick reply from without, and then enter severally, carrying
miner’s sivag. Ben. down c. platform. Jack down plat-
form R. Dick down platform L. They are followed
cautiously hy the Capt., Bendigo Bill, and Jerry. Captain
down c. Bill down l. Jerry downs..—he comes a cropper,
and slides down behind rushes. Captain and Bill hide behind
rushes. )
The Music, which has alternately been pp. andff., now ceases.
Myles, (r.c.) We are near the spot, boys. Begorra,
here it is !
Omnes. Where I
Myles. Here ! no, it isn't. But sure it’s mighty like it
—as like as two paase in one pod.
Ben. That doesn’t help us much. Have you no clue of
any kind ?
Myles. Bedad, but I have ! Sure, I left my pick stickin’
in the ground on the very spot where I found the stuff.
Ben. Well, that’s better than nothing.
Myles. Anyhow it’s better than a pulthogue on the side
o’ the head.
Jack. We’d better crowd all sail or we shall have the
girls here with the waggon before we begin.
Myles. To be sure. For Katty has got the tame, and
the tint, and the grub, and a case of “ boy,” and beside
that a keg of raal John Jameson,
Ben. Let us each take a separate path and the first who
comes upon Myles’ pick will give the signal.
[Exit Big Ben r. 1 e.
Dick. Reet you are, Ben. Here goes !
[Exit Dick l. 2 e.
Jack. I’m off this way. [Exit Jack r. 3 e.
Myles. And I this. And when we mate agin maybe
we’ll join sharp, like the diviTs toe-nails.
[Exit Myles l. 1 E.
The Capt. , Bendigo Bill, Jerry, emerge from rushes and
beckon down platform four great bearded ruffians, all tracked
by Wallaroo who comes down c. and hides behind rushes.
The Music begins.
Capt. After ’em ! Sharp’s the word !
Bill. And quick’s the action !
[Exit Bill l. 1 e. and two ruffians.


Capt. Now, Master Ben, for you 1
[Exit after Ben with two other ruffians e. 1 e.
Jerry. The chippin’s a-goin’ to begin, so I’ll retire and
see fair play in the rear.
{Exit Jehrt l. 2 e.
(The face of Wallaroo is now seen through the bushes
behind. He crawls fonmrd like a snake on the ground,
then springs erect, and rushes over to 1 e.e.h. Looks after
Capt. with a savage chuckle.)
Wall. Last now, Oap’n ! First byme-bye !
(He is moving off cautiously after Captain e. 1 e.)
Music ff. of harness hells. Wall., springing to his feet,
looks off l. 2 E.
Wall. {Clapping his hands with delight.) Big gee-gee !
lubly white queen and liliie pickalilly ! {Runs off 1.5. e.)
Glen. {Without 1.5. e.) See to the child, boy, while I
disembark the ladies.
Music now ends.
(Glen, assists in handing out Kath., l. 2 e., who looks
around with surprise.)
Kath. (c.) Why, where are we at all, at all, Glendargle ?
Glen, (e.c.) This is the rendezvous, Katty, so, for the
present, suppose we call it home ?
Kath. Home % G’long with you ! Am Ito begin
business wid the wombats and the kangaroos ? {Xes to e.)

Nell. Sybil, what have you done with the child 1
Sybil. Left him with the little black fellow yonder.
Nell. {Alarmed.) With that savage ?
Kath. Oh, the crayture’s not a cannibal!
Nell. {Aside.) Lost so long—so newly found—l dare not
trust my darling out of sight—not even for a moment.
Where, oh, where is he ?
Wall. {Runs on from l. 2 b. with baby in his arms.)
Come along, liliie pickalilly. {Runs off r. 2 e.)
Nell. Harry! Harry! {Runs off after Wall.)
Kath. Ah, thim three’ll be as thick as thieves in two


minutes. Meanwhile we want wood for a fire, so while I
gather some sticks you had betther look after the waggon,
Duchess, and make yourself at home.
[Exit Kath. l.u.e.
pp. Music.
Sybil. {Solus.) Home ! Home here ! In this wilderness 1
{Down c.) Yet while he is here —it is a Paradise and not a
wilderness ! For three years—three long years —it has been
ray hope by day, ray dream by night, that I should find him.
Yet now—now that the hour has come, we are as far apart
as the poles. (Goes up 1.c.) But ’twill not be for ever.
No, no ! for when he looks into my eyes he will read the
truth there. Heaven send it may be soon.
[Exit l. 2 e.
(A pause.)
Be-enter the Captain r.h. 1 e.
Capt. Missed ! Curse him ! If only I can get at him,
I’ll wipe out old scores with this ! (Knife.)

The ship that goes,
And the lass that loves a sailor.”
(At sound of Jack’s voice, Capt. darts up and hides behind
the rushes at back 1.c.)
Re-enter jACK/rom eminence at back b. and down c. platform.
Jack. I’ve found nothing and lost my latitude in this
God-forgotten place. Well, this is a rum look-out! I’ve

can my mates have got to 1 (Sees wagon off stage.)
Christopher Columbus ! Bless my yeyes if the gals haven’t
been, and come, and gone, without a welcome. Hear, my
dears. (Singing.) “ Here stands a post! ” Not a soger,
but a sailor, with his tiddy iddy riddy widdy—rum turn
turn !
(Hurrying up c. stumbles over piece of rock in centre.)
Deuce take it, I’ve nearly broken my shin over that
infernal snag—beastly rotten old stump !
(In his anger he gives it a bash with his pick, knocking
off the moss which covers it, revealing to his astonished gaze a
monster nugget of gold.)
Stump ! It’s no stump ! It’s gold, gold, pure gold !


(Cam. eagerly beckons on Bill and Jerry who enter
from back 1.u.b.)
Our fortune’s made !
Capt. (r.) No, ours !

{The fight for the nugget begins. The Captain rushes on
Jack, who strikes at him with spade. He recoils u. Jerry
now jumps in, clasping Jack’s waist. Bill closes behind

sprawling to R.H., and gives Bill a terrific facer which sends

struggle —the Capt. seizes Sybil, placing hand upon her
mouth, Bill clasping her waist, the Larr. holding her

ACT 11.
“THE GOLDEN HOLE.”
Exactly the same as Scene 2, Act 1., save that the ground
is now opened out. The middle cut doth is removed,
a crane is placed c. Behind at 1.0. a tent. Great
lumps of white quartz are lying about. Trees
are dotted about the wild landscape. L. 1 E. Bank
and rough canopy held tip by two sticks, under which
Sailor Jack is soundly sleeping. Wall, also sleeping
beside Jack. On R. H. 2E.is a large tent improvised
as an Hotel by Kathleen O’Mara. Green flag with
“Erin Go Braegh" on it. In c. of the stage up at
the hack is the opening of the mine, known as “ The
Golden Hole.” Heaps of earth. Excavations of the
mine about the mouth of the shaft showing, by glitter-
ing panicles, the rich nature of the ore. In front of
“ The Golden Hole ” is a box or packing-case of rough
timber, about 2 feet by 3. The box is padlocked and filled
with large nuggets and covered with apiece of dirty matting.
Two wheelbarrows, 10 pick-axes, 10 shovels.
Music introduces the Scene, which is an animated one.
(Myles and Yorkshire Dick and a Crowd of Miners are
variously engaged in washing, sifting, wheeling, and winding
up soil from the mine. Ben directing everything.)
Enter Kath. from tent R. She has her sleeves turned up
and an apron on. She rings a bell. At the sound Every
Man knocks off work, and one wheelbarrow is placed a. of stage
by Dick. Myles runs the other barrow behind a great
hulking fAlow, who falls into it, and Myles runs him off l. in
barrow.
\_All exeunt in various directions except Dick, Myles,
and Ben.
Kath. Dinner’s ready, boys.
Dick. And, by gosh, I’se ready for dinner ; I can put
away enow’ for haef a dozen.

Kath. (b.c.) Cabbage and bacon, toad in the hole, and
Norfolk dumplings.
[Exit into tent.
Myles. Begorra ! I pity them dumplings ; they’ll never
see Norfolk again.
[Exit into tent E. with a laugh.
Ben. (Now entirely metamorphosed, though still brwsrpie
and gloomy. He looks at Jack.) Poor lad, he has had an
awfully long spell of it, but the crisis is past, the fever is
over, and he sleeps soundly as a child. (Sits c. on barroio
and lights his pipe.) Doctor Wallaroo—Doctor Wallaroo,
how did you manage it ?

give all I have in the world to see his face—to hear his voice.
Ben. Would you ?
Jack. Would I ? Ah, you don’t know! How should
you ? I’m a precious bad lot—ran away, went to sea and
broke poor mother’s heart. Leo's sure to be down on me,
yet he was fond of me once. And could I only hear him
say—“ Jack, I forgive you ! ”
Ben. Jack, I forgive you !
Jack. What—what—you don’t mean—you are not!

Jerry, (r.c.) Does he look as if he’d kid yer? Not
exactly ; he couldn’t do it if he wor to try.
Ward. But Ben and Myles are in possession.
Myles, (1.c.) Ay, be jabers, and that’s nine points of
the law.
Ben. Besides, we have already extracted some five and
twenty thousand pounds’ worth of ore. The bulk of it you
have already seen in the bank at Coolgardie. Show them
our latest find, Myles. (Warden gets up c.)
(Myles rapidly opens boxes, showing the specimens
of golden ore. )
Ward. {Astonished.) By the living Jingo, this is the
wonder of the world. I’ve been twenty years at the gold
fields, and damme ik I ever saw anything like it. You
value this and the stuff at the bank at five-and-twenty
thousand pounds, you say 1
Ben. (Up v.) Yes, but as we want ready money, if we can
do a deal, we’ll sell at £20,000.
Glen, (l.) I’ll give it—and look here! I’ve brought a

astonishment.)

W 7 ard. Where’s your evidence 2
Capt. Evidence. Ha, ha ! ( Laughing derisively. ) Only

Ward. Very well, then, produce them, and I’ll give a
final decision a week hence in my Court at Coolgardie.

Omnes. Of course —of course.
Bill. (c. ) The Capting’s all square !
Jerry, (1.c.) M’yaas—square all raand ! {Aside.) But

(Aside.) Toby, I shall stick to them corners like
cobbler’s wax !
Myles. (Giving him a hick which lands him l.) Stick to
that, ye dirty blackguard !
Jerry. (With a roar.) What! behind my back—oh,
shabby—shabby. Tie him up—no, tie him daawn, I mean'
(Myles’ leg is secured by 2nd Ecitian. )
I’ll talk to you, my bold bog-trotter, byme bye—
m’yaas—in the sweet byme bye !
Re-enter Kath. from tent with tray bearing seven pannikins

Myles. {lndignantly. Aside.) Whisky for them villyana £
Whist, Katty !

Myles. (Aside.) Mum’s the word! I’m dumb as an
oyster.
(Kath. returning c. ; serves Cart. r. ; serves 2nd, 3rd, and
Jfth Eufeians, and finally serves Bill.)
Bill. (c. Taking whisky.) So you’ve changed your mind.
Missis Brimstone ?
Kath. Yes. {Mimicking him.) I’ve changed my mind,
Misther Blackguard ! And as you’re the biggest bla’guard,
here’s the biggest dose for you. (Giving him large panni-
kin.) You bad son of an ugly father !
Bill. Oh, cum I say—my father was a handsome chap t
It’s easy seein’ that, cos I take arter him !
Kath. Then he must have been a beauty !
Myles. She had you there, Misther Bendigo Bully!
Bill. You shut up, Misther Paddy from Cork.
Kath. (At door of tent.) Well, now you’ve got my last
drop. It’s afther doin’ you good I hope it’ll be, you set of
drunken swine !
[Exit into tent-
Bill. It’s only her pleasant little way ! But she likes me,
or she wouldn’t have brought me this dolloping lot !


(All the Ruffians come well foru'ard, drinking and
lighting their pipes.)
Re-enter Sybil e. 2e. Unseen by the Ruffians, she glides
rapidly behind them to back of tree e.c.
Ben. (Aside.) Jack, try to keep up !
Jack. (Aside.) I can’t, old man. They’ve done for me
this time.
Ben. God forbid ! Keep a good heart, old chap ! (Aside.)
Is there no hope—no escape ?
Sybil. (Hek face appearing above them in opening of the
tree. Aside.) Yes—both! Hist! a moment—one little
moment. I will unloose your bonds and set you free !
Ben. I
Myles. J- (Together.) Free!
Jack. J
Sybil. And list! yonder ruffians are drugged !
Ben. J
Myles. > Drugged !
Jack. J
Sybil. Hush ! Look ! look !
(The narcotic now speedily begins to take effect in a more
or less grotesque manner.)
Bill. ( Eagerly drinking.) Never tasted such stuff in my
life! It’s rumbo! Hie! Why, Jerry, blowed if I ain’t
tight already!
Jeeey. (1.c.) You are—you are! Tight as a drum !
Bill. And only one glass done it !
Jeeey. A pailful, you mean ! Why, it’s as big as a bucket!
Bill. So it is—l—hie! (Yawns — others follow suit)
Jeeey. (To Ist Ruffian who has bolted his whisky.)
Stunning! (He sips his whisky.) Goes down like a torch-
light procession.
(Ist Ruffian, who is seated l. starts up, puts his hand
on his stomach.)
Jeeey. Here, I say, Toby— what’s up ?
(Ist Ruffian falls with a crash.)
He’s daawn—that’s what’s up ! Why, Capting.
(Xes to R.) They’re all mops and brooms. (Capt. laughs
heartily. ) It is funny, ain’t it ? (To 2nd Ruffian.) Tommy,
did you see Toby ? (2nd Ruffian falls.) Naaw he’s gawn.
Well, this is a rum rig!
(The 3rd and 4th Ruffians, who occupy the c. of background,
start up as if they had been shot, then, being about to collapse,


slew round , plant themselves back to hack, supporting each
other.)
Jerry. [Xes over to them.) Here, I say, Hezekiah!
What’s wrong with your applecart ?
(2nd and 3rd Ruffians slew round so that they meet chest
to chest, their heads resting upon each other’s shoulders, their
features fixed, rigid, and immovable, with an expression of
idiotic drunken gravity. Being unable to use their arms, they
only maintain their perpendicular position bg leaning against
each other. They swerve slightly and fall with a crash long-
ways, but in opposite directions, across the stage c. Bach Man
lies with his head level with the other’s heels.)
Naaw they’re daawn ! It’s all along o’ the whisky !
It was bloomin’ strong, and no mistake! (Stretches arms
and sways to and fro.)
Bill. (Vainly trying to keep the drop on Prisoners.) Booty
is dooty. Mind, Mr Paddy from Cork, I’ve got —hie—
the drop on you ! (Fires pistol in the air and falls.)
Jerry. (With a yell of terror, placing his hands behind
him.) He’s blown my brains out!
(Falls beside Bill, their heads pillowed on 3rd and 4th
Ruffians —feet to the Audience. )
Oapt. ( Laughing heartily. ) Evidently a little whisky goes
a long way with these louts ! (Aside.) Happy thought!
While they are sleeping off their booze I’ll mizzle with the
thousand quid.' But before I go I’ll settle accounts here !
(r. Aloud to Ben, Myles, and Jack.) So — l’ve got you ! I’ve
half a mind to make a good riddance of the lot of you !
Anyhow, I’ll make sure of you, Mr Lionel Leigh ! You,
who half an hour ago talked of killing me like a dog—but
—{drawing his knife) —it’s my turn now ! (Advancing 'upon
Ben to kill him.)
Sybil. (Springs forward c. interrupting him.) Stand back,
I say, stand back !
Capt. (Recoiling r.c.) Ha ! I’m glad you are here, for
you’re just in time to see me kill your man !
Simidtaneously.
Sybil. No, no 1

Sybil. Kill me first.

Out of the way.

Captain. Psha! Out of

Jack. Scrumptious !
Wall. {Aside-Licking his finger.) Golophous, num-num !
(He squats domi (k. ) dips his fingers in the pot and licks them.)
Sybil, Now, as you have taken your physic like a good
boy, you may take a little walk before the sun goes down.
Wall. Nicey, nicey ! {Delighted with jam.)

Wall. Iss, Wally hear.
Sybil. Why don’t you give it then ?

Albany wid a consignment of dry goots and I came to lay

Von Swop. Of course, mein fraulein, for civilisation goes
hand in hand wid de dry goods of Shermany.
Sybil. (Calling Nelly on.) Nelly, Nelly, here’s our friend
Yon Swop just returned from Albany.
Nell runs on from hotel.
Nell. Welcome back" Mr Von Swop, (c.)

Sybil, (r.c.) And yours is too, sweet Nellie.
Von Swop, (o.) Bonner and blitzen, nodings cannot be too
sweet for you, mein frauleins. Ach Himmell, but you are
just two lofely roses on one stalk. When I look at you,

Von Swop. Dis ish a splendid line ; doubly wove toes

Von Swop. De best made in Shermany. Take zem, and

Re-enter Wall, from hotel. He is clad in Child’s coat

Von Swop, (1.c.) Potztauzand, only look at ze monkey

Jack, (r.) He only wants a tail to make him complete.
Kath. (l.) I’ll complait him! How dar you, you
impudent lump o’ biled mahogany ? How dar you ?


Music.

through the window. Crash, and screaming of a child.)
Murther alive, but the barbarian has smashed the
cradle and squashed the baby ! ( Buns into house calling out )
Here, Duchess I —Nellie I Where are yez, at all, at all ?
Sure, there’s murther goin’ on—that’s what there is I
(Wall. is seen inside to be throwing the baby up and down in
his arms, pacifying it.)
Wall. Catchee ! catchee ! yandee, yarrah !
(Sybil and Nell, enter behind, snatch up Child, pluck off
outer dress, and disappear. Wall., who remains clad in the
Child’s chemise, leaps out of window—runs R. 1 E. —is
stopped by Jack— turns and bolts 1., spilling Yon Swop
amidst the bandboxes, etc., pursued by Ja6k, and exits l. 2 e.)
(Yon Swop and Jack laugh heartily.)
Jack, (1.c.) Well, that Wally is a cure.
Yon Swop, (r.c.) Ya ! he ish dot! Hein! Mister Sailor;

Jack. That is real good of you, Mynherr.
Yon Swop. And I have anozer for your brother, the Herr
Ben, but I have oder business wid him. My syndicate
in Berlin authorise me to buy ze Golden Hole.
Jack. You’re too late, Glendargle has the call.
Von Swop. Donnerwetter ! Dot it ish to be a lord !
Jack. No, that it is to be a man—and that’s just what
Glendargle is. Then blood is thicker than water, and, you
know, although an Irishman, he comes from England.
Yon Swop. Bah! England cannot stand against Sherraany.
Jack (r.c.) Rot, sir, rot! England can stand against the
world ! She leads the commerce of the universe, and will
do so as long as her flag floats over the sea.
Yon Swop. (r.c.) Bosh ! bosh ! with big, big B! The
conquering Sherman rules everywhere. Ye outvits you—
ve undersell you—and lam here to do it now. (Chuckles.)
Remember, mein lieben friend, I vas made in Sherraany—
ha, ha !
Jack, (1.c.) Ah, we are used to things made there, and
don’t think much of them, or of Sherraany either.
Von Swop. You vill vhen ve vipes you out ! Wait, mein
young sailor, till you see our fleet.
Jack. I will, and when we do see it we will wipe that
out.
Von Swop. You vill need a mighty big dish clout for dat
job.


Jack. It is ready now, and has been ready ever since we
swept the Spaniard out of the sea in the days of Queen
Bess; We call it “The Union Jack,” and so long as that
flies at the fore of a British ship, manned by British tars,
so long will Britannia rule the waves, and hold her own
not only against your precious Germany, but against th§
world. Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Mr “Coots
Made In Shermany! ”
[Exit l. 2 e.
Von Swop. Dose English sailors are right down coot
fellows, but dey are so conceited. We never can teach dem
“ Dot dem dot fights and runs away,
Will live to fight anoder dey.”
No; de fools prefer to stay and be killed. Ah! we knows
a dam sight better dan dot in Shermany!
[Exit into Court e.
Music.
Enter Sybil from the hotel, followed by Nell. Sybil is
knitting. She sits c.
Nell. (k.c. in hysterical excitement). Oh' Sybilla,
Sybilla, he’s going home.
Sybil, (c.) He ! Whom ?
Nell. Why, Dick !
Sybil. Dick !
Nell. My Dick !
Sybil. {Archly). Oh! your Dick. (Sits c.)
Nell. Yes ! He told me so a moment ago. Told me,
too, that he wished to speak to me —alone.
Sybil. Well, there is nothing so terrible in that. {Her
sang froid contrasts strongly ivith Nell.’s hysteria.)
Nell. But it is terrible. Very terrible. For he must
know all.
Sybil. He must.
Nell. When he does know it. {Going down e., returning
c.) When he does
Sybil. {Archly.) He will know something else.
Nell. And that is 1
Sybil. He will know that the woman he loves trusts him
with all her heart, with all her soul.
Nell. Yes 1 yes !
Sybil. And if he loves her, he will trust her.
Nell. Yes ! yes !
Sybil. (Gravely.) But if he does not?
Nell. Don’t, Sybil! don’t, I can’t bear it. Death were
better than that. {Xes to l. and bach up c.)


Sybil. (Pausing in her v:ork, and with great sympathy.)
Poor child Do you then love this rough diamond of yours
so much 1
Nell. Much I More than life itself, (1.c.)
Sybil. (Half reproachfully.) Yet it seems but yesterday
since—since
Nell. Since I was foolish—mad. True, true, but that
was not love. ’Twas but the infatuation of a froward,
thoughtless girl, who took a piece of pinchbeck for stealing
gold. Love ! I knew not then the meaning of the word.
Sybil. You know it now ( smiling ) though.
Nell. Ah ! yes. Those six months out in the bush
yonder revealed to me a heaven on earth of which I had
never dreamt before, even in my wildest dreams.
Sybil. And so this Yorkshire paladin has led you to the
gates of Paradise. (Still smiling.)
Nell. (Dropping upon her knees beside Sybil.) You don’t
know him. Though rugged as his native North, he is as
modest as he is manly—as tender as he is true.
Sybil. (Decidedly) The more reason, then, that you
should trust him. ,
Nell. (Starting up.) I dare not! I dare not! were he to
despise me
Sybil. He will not despise you. •
Nell. He might. He might! And then where could I
look for hope—for consolation 1
Sybil. (Dropping her knitting and rising with ardour.)
Here, in these arms ; here in this heart. (Embrace.)
Nell. You teach me my duty, dear, and with God’s help
I’ll do it.
Sybil. That’s right, dear ! (Goes rapidly up to door.)
Nell. (Following Sybil.) Yes, my Dick shall know the
truth, even if the telling it breaks roy heart.
Sybil. That’s my own darling ! Come, dear, come.
[Exeunt into hotel.
Music— Lively.
(A shout from within, “Hurray!” Enter himultuously a
Crowd of Miners. Glen, and Myles from Court
House R. All very quick and with animation.)
Myles, (c.) Owld Ireland and Victory for ever.
Omnes. Hurray !
Glen. (r.c.) You’ve won the battle, Myles.
Myles. Battle ? Sure it was not a battle but a rout—a
regular slaughter of the enemy. Begorra, we drove ’em out
of the field wid a rush, because they daren’t show their faces
in it. (Goes 1.c.)


Enter Yon Swop/rom Gowrt House k.

Von Swop, (l.) Ya, and all de golden stuff in it.

Ireland.
Myles. A bottle? A dozen bottles ! {All go up towards
door of hotel.)
Ben. Hold hard, Miles ! Business first, pleasure next.
You are still of the same mind, Glendargle ?
Glen. Of course, I am.
Von Swop. But, Herr Ben, I am prepared to make a bid.
Ben. Too late, Mynherr.
Von Swop. But see here*; I’ll give five thousand more.
Ben. Not if you were to give fifty thousand. I’ve given
my word to Glendargle, and he has the call.
[Exit Ben. into hotel.
Von Swop. Potz Tansand !
Glen. Come and have a drink, Von Swop.
[Exit Glen, into hotel.
Von Swop. Donnerwetter ! Donner and blitzen !
Myles. An’ don’t stand swearin’ there, but go in like a
daoent owld man, and wish the boys luck.
Von Swop. Potz Tansand. Eivos?
Myles. Of coorse ye wur. Away ye go, now.
[Pushes Von Swop into home.
(Kath. appearing at window, cleaning glasses, etc.)
Kath. {Looking admiringly at Myles.) So you’ve won the
day, Myles ? Ye were always proud of your country. Now
your country will be proud of you. I could jump out of my
skin wid joy.
Myles. Do, darlin’, do—jump into my arms, and taste
peace and plenty. Oh, it’s the proud boy lam this day.
(Triumphantly.) Be jabers, I’ll not spake a sober word
for a month, unless I am drunk.
Kath. Then divil a drink ye’ll get from me this blessed
■night out. ( Disappears .)
Myles. Oh, listen to that! The barbarous crayture, to


deprive a poor boy of his mother’s milk. I that was waned
on it.

ah sud be t’ ’appiest chap i’t’ wide world. Thear ; it’s aht

pp. Music ends.
(Nell, sits trembling, turns away silently, weeping.)
Dick. Greetin’ ! why ma pretty ? What have ah said or
dun to mek thee greet 1
Nell. Nothing, I am only cryin’ because
Dick. Well—because ?
Nell. Because I am not worthy of you.
Dick. Naa ; ah’ll none believe that.
Nell. ’Tis truth—gospel truth. (Pause.) Turn away your
face. Don’t look at me, or I shall die of shame. Don’t look
at me, I say.
Dick. Ah’m not lookin’, lass !
pp. Music— Nellie’s.
Nell. (In a low, trembling tone.) While yet almost a
child—an innocent, ignorant child—l fell a victim to the
arts of a villain. Deceived, betrayed, I—who have never
been a wife—became a mother.
Dick. A muther 1
Nell. Yes, the mother of yonder child! (Falls upon her
knees. He starts.)
To spare me exposure and disgrace, my sister, my
noble-hearted sister, took upon herself the burden of my
shame. But she is innocent, innocent as the hapless child
of whom lam the unfortunate but guiltless mother. Yes,
guiltless, for as God is my judge, I erred in ignorance but
not in guilt.
But there, there! protestations are idle—words,
mere wasted breath; and tears (even were I to shed an
ocean!) can never blot out the past, which flows ’twixt you
and me, like a lake of fire in which all my hopes lie con-
sumed by unavailing regrets for that which might have
been once, but never can be now—no never —never!
(Falls into a great passion of grief, sobbing as if her heart
were fit to break. He remains perturbed but silent.)
(Dashing aside her tears in desperation and spring-
ing to her feet, speaks quickly and decidedly.) I knew it must
come to this sooner or later, but I hoped it wouldn’t come
quite so soon. Your kindness, however, wrings the truth
from me. (Xes in front of Dick to e., then up the stage.)
And, now that all is over between us, forget—forgive.
(.Turning away.)


Dick. Ah’ve nowt to forgive, lass.
Nell. But you have something to forget—yes—forget
that we have ever met —and now—good-bye ! (Moves towards
door of hotel.)
DicK. Naa, naa. Doan’t leave me, Nellie.
Nell. I must —I must. Your honest name shall never he
sullied by my shame.
Dick. Nay, lass, there’s no shame where there’s no sin.
Only gi’e me t’ rate to protect thee, and ah’d like to see t’
man or t’ woman who’d look askance at Dick Garth’s wife.
Cum, lass, cum, and my muther s’al be thy muther thy
child, my child.
Nell. God bless you, Dick. (They embrace.)
Dick. He has blessed me already in thee—in thee, my
hope, my pride. (Leads her tenderly up R.) Doan’t
greet, lass, doan’t greet.
Nell. They are tears of joy.
Dick. Let me kiss ’em away, my own bonnie dearie.
Cum, lass, cum. [Dick and Nell, exeunt r.u.b.

Capt. comes forward with a cynical grin on his face, followed
by the Lake, and Wallaroo from l.u.e.
Capt. Quite idyllic, isn’t it ? Ha, ha, ha ! (Laughs
sardonically.)
Jerry. Idyllic—hydraulic, you mean ; too hydraulic for
me. ( Boohooing.) I’m too tender ’arted.
Capt. You are too tender to live. (Laughs.)
Jerry. Well, you swells are rum uns ; I shouldn’t chuckle
that way if I saw another bloke a-huggin my Sail.
Capt. Shouldn’t you ?
Jerry. No, I shouldn’t. Remember what Handel says in
his himmortal hanthem —“ Never hintroduce your donah
to a pal. ” But there—there—they all do it; in fact, I
done it myself.
Capt. (Seeing Ben and Glen, returning.) Oh, shut up !
Jerry. Shut up it is! (They retire and hide 1.u.e.,
preceded by Wall.)
Re-enter Ben and Glen, from inn, very quick.
Ben. You understand the price ?
Glen. Perfectly ’ £150,000 cash and shares, and £50,000
working capital.
Ben. And a deposit of £2OOO for six months’ option.
Glen. Right you are. I’m off to the bank to get the
needful. Back in five minutes. [Exit l.u.e.

Be-enter Jack l. 2 e.
Jack, (l.) Ben.
Ben. (c.) Hello ! there your are.
Jack. Yes, here I am. What’s left of me. {Sits down
L.c. fanning himself.)
Ben. That won’t be much if you take to loafing about in
this way.
Jack. It’s the first walk I’ve had since we left “ The
Golden Hole.” The fact is “ She ” won’t let me stir out.
Ben. She ? Whom ?
Jack. “ She ” who must be obeyed—the Duchess.
Ben. H’m ! The Duchess ! {lmpatiently.)
Jack. She will have her own way. It’s “Mr Sailor this
and Mr Sailor that! Time to get up, time to go to roost,
time for soup and slops, time for tea and toast; above all,
time for physic ! ” Oh, that beastly physio, I can taste it
now ; o-o-o-h ! But, bless her dear heart, for all that she’s
an angel.
Ben. A fallen one, I tear.
Jack. She fallen ! Can you look on her face and say
so ?
Ben. I have seen a face as fair as hers mask the heart of
a devil.
Jack. A devil!
Ben. Yes ; the devil who wrecked my life and sent me
forth an outcast and a wanderer ruined, disgraced,
degraded.
Jack. My poor brother.
Ben. Abandoned both by God and man, on my way to
banishment, I met your friend the Duchess, as you call
her. To look upon her was to love her.
Jack. I can well believe that.
Ben. The voyage out passed like one long happy dream
till we reached Melbourne. Then came the awaking.
Jack. The awaking !
Ben. Yes; for it was then that I realised that I had no
right to cast the shadow of my shame upon the brightness
of her life, so I turned, and without a word or look, fled
into the wilderness. For three years —three long, dreary
years—l wearied God with tears and prayers that the time


might come when I should be free to meet her once more.
The time came, and when it did, she whom I adored, stood
before me unabashed, with the evidence of her shame in her
arras—on her breast.
Jack. You mean the child ?
Ben. I mean the child.
Jack. Pshaw ! She is not married and never has been.
{Rising.)
Ben. I know it, for she told me so herself.
Jack. Herself ?
Ben. Herself ! Worse even than that, barely a week
ago, I saw with these eyes, heard with these ears, that
scoundrel Wantley claim the child for his own.
Jack. Impossible !
Ben. I tell you it’s true. These were the words—“So
this is the child —our child ! ”
Jack. Incredible !
Ben. I was about to strike the ruffian to my feet, to
trample his detested features out of all semblance to
humanity, when a sudden revulsion came. The love that
had sanctified my life was stricken dead, and my heart was
turned to stone ! {Dropping down R.c.)
Jack, (1.c.) Turned to butter you mean. Why, it’s
melting at this moment.
Ben. (Savagely.) Don’t jest with me ! (Facing Jack.)
Jack. I’m not jesting ; I’m soberly, seriously in earnest.
Now, just you tell me one thing. When that blackguard
spoke about the child, was there anyone else present ?
Ben. Certainly ; little Nell was there.
Jack. I thought so. Now, I'll bet my share of “ The
Golden Hole ” to an empty ’baccy box, that Nell is the
mother of that child.
Ben. You don’t mean ?
Jack. I do. While I’ve been lying on my back these
six months half awake, half asleep, I’ve seen and heard
strange things.
Ben. No ?
Jack. Yes ! Many a time and oft at nightfall “ She ”
—that’s the Duchess —gets me into a corner and begins to
cross-question me about you, and mighty artful she is about
it. W hen I tell her what a pickle you were when a boy her
bosom rises and sinks like a lake in a storm, her eyes grow
bigger and bigger, her breath comes and goes in little gasps,
her voice trembles into music, until the stars stand still to
listen. Then, my dear eyes! it’s a caution to see her turn
pale as death one minute, and at the next kindle into flanlte
at the very sound of your voice.


Ben. If this were true !
Jack. It’s gospel truth. Why, man alive, with all her
beauty and all her pride, she adores the very ground you
walk on !
Ben. Do you think so ?
Jack. Think ? I know it ; I’m sure of it.
Ben. It is; it must be so ! God ! what a brute beast I’ve
been ! But I’ll kneel at her feet and never rise till she for-
gives me ! Oh, how changed it all is. A moment ago ’twas
dark as night, now ’tis bright as the living day. A moment
ago I doubted the Eternal Justice, now I know God reigns
in heaven, while Love, his first-born, is lord of all on earth,
and the heart which I thought dead, is beating, bounding
here, till well nigh fit to burst with joy. And I owe it all
to you, Jack—to you ! God bless you, old man, God bless
you 1 {He falls on Jack’s shoulder overcome.)

Brothers separate.)

Ben. Oh, the two thousand, you mean?
Note. — From this moment Ben is radiant with hope and
happiness.
Glen. Yes ; here you are ; twenty notes for a hundred

Ben. (e.c.) A moment, and I’ll give you a receipt. (Takes
out pocket-hook and pencil, and writes a receipt.)

Kath. Now, Misther O’Hooligan, make yourself useful.
Myles. Born for your Use ! I live but to oblige ye,

hands out of window tea tray to Kath. , who places it on table
while business is going on.)

Von Swop. (o. to Glen.) I thay, look here, my lord,

Jack. A dozen, old man. [Exeunt l. 2b.
Myles. (To Kath.) There ye are, jewel! But is the
catlap ready, darlin’ ?
Kath. Catlap, indeed ! Sure, it’s the finest Bohea that
ever came out of China. Look alive and get me a chair, sir,
or I’ll have nothing to sit down on.


Myles. Oh yes, you will ; and something mighty sub-
stantial and convaynient.

Katty. What’s become of Nelly, Duchess ?
Sybil. I—l don’t know.
Myles. But Ido ! Sure I saw Yorkshire Dick makin’
sheep’s eyes at her a while ago, as big as a duck’s egg, and
then they strolled out quite promiscuously and purposely,
by accident. Katty, darlin’, it’s near pairin’ time, and if
you’d only be afther makin’ up your mind ; and if the
Duchess would only follow suit, and give one o’ the boys
that’s dyin’ to make a doormat of himself for her to wipe her
purty feet on, the chance of a look-in, we might all be
spliced at onst.

happiness r.u.e.
Glen. Splendid idea, Myles. I’ll be the best man.
Yon Swop. And I’ll be de “ fader of she,” and give de
whole family away.
Dick, (k.c.) There’s many a true word spoken i’ jest.
Nellie and ah are goin’ to get wed, good people.
Omnes. ( Astonished .) No !
Nell. Yes ! and I invite you all to the wedding.
Glen. All right—we’ll be there.
Von Swop. Ya ! All dere, Mees Nellie.
Myles. Katty, your sowl, come on! Sure the same
weddin’ breakfast will do for the whole boilin’ of us.

his hand , and he starts away.)


Kath. Be off wid yez out o' that.
(Sybil goes rapidly down l.c. to Nell, and Dick.)
Sybil (To Nell, aside.) You have told him?
Nell. (Aside.) All.
Sybil. ( Tenderly embracing her.) That’s my own sister.
(Anxiously, putting Nell, round l.) And you, Mr Garth ?
Dick. (Aside.) Ah’ve told her — “ My mother sal he her
mother, and her child my child. ”
Sybil. Then her sister shall be your sister, Richard.
Dick. No ?
Sybil. Yes. There’s my hand ! (Gives her hand to Dick.
She then joins their hands. Dick puts Nell, tenderly round
to E. so that he stands between them. )
Dick. Eh, Duchess, wi’ such a wife and such a sister ah’m
that proud.
Myles. (Coming dotm 1.c.) Ye are —ye are—ye’re as proud
as a dog wid two tails.
Dick. (Laughing.) Ah’ve niver seed one, but if he’s a
happier dog this day than ah’m, ah sud like to know where
to find him. (He places the arms of the Two Gikls in his.)
Myles. Begorra, when I see you standin’ there wid
beauty on one arm and ilegance on the other, I’m mortal
sure there isn’t a boy in Coolgardie but will say, “ How
happy could I be with either.’’
Dick. But thear’s where ah’ve gotten the pull, for ah’m
happy wi’ both.
Myles. Well, if you aren’t you ought to be, for by jabers
the three of yez make a purty fine couple.

Re-enter Jack 2 e. l.
Jack. I always turn up in time for tea, for your brew is
tip-top, Duchess.
Dick. It is that, Jack.
Jack. And as for your jam, Kitty—it almost reconciles
me to my physic. Thank you; don’t mind if I do! (About
to take jam pot.)
Myles. No you don’t—l’ll do it myself.
Yon Swop. Meestress Katty, I have taken ze liberty of
bringing my leetle contribution to ze feast. (Xes behind to
table l. and produces from box a huge sausage.) Dis sausage
made in Shermany !
(All laugh.)


Sybil. (Laughing.) Good gracious ! What a big one !
Dick. A regular whopper !
Myles. Arrah ! How many pigs did it take to make
that monsther ?
Jack. Hand it over, old man, and I’ll sample it.
(Snatches it and runs doivn to bottom of table, chased by Yon
Swop, who tries to regain it, but is forced into his seat by
Dick and Glen. )
Jack. Give us a knife, Nell.
Nell. Here you are. (Giving one.)
(Jack standing with back to audience, cuts slices from the
sausage. N.B.—This is a trick sausage. Case at top contains
the slices which Jack is supposed to cut.)
Jack. (Fills his plate with slices and goes to his place at
table.) There you are ! You couldn’t be better served in a
sausage shop.
Kath. Sausage shop ! Misther Jack, I’d have ye to
know the “ Erin Go Bragh ” is the first hotel in Coolgardie!
Jack. Oh, of course —of course—that goes without
saying.
Myles. And the sausage is going without saying too.
I’ll trouble you for another slice, Nellie.
Jack. Well, Myn Herr, if all the goods made in Germany
were half as good as this, I wouldn’t mind turning German
myself.
Myles. Begorra! I’m half German already—it’s delicious.

When silence is restored Ben. re-enters l.u.e.
Ben. How beautiful she looks ! She has smiles for
everybody—everybody but me! (Drops down l.)
Nell. Ah! Mr Ben, I think I must scold you for being
so late. Tea for Mr Ben, Sybil. (She runs up and brings
tea and bread and butter down to Ben.)
Ben. Thanks. (Takes tea from Nell, who resumes heb
seat.)
Ben. (Aside.) She won’t even look at me ! But she shall.
I’ll know my'fate—now—this very hour. (Averts ms gaze.)
Sybil. (Aside, stealing a look at Ben.) Colder and sterner
than ever. I detest him !
Myles. So it’s after goin’ home ye are, Dick ?
Dick, (k.) Aye, please God.
Sybil. Home ! Oh ! little word that means so much.
Ben. Much 1 It means everything ! It reminds the
exile of his native land with its stately minsters, and its


trophied towers ; its peaceful hamlets, and its crowded
cities ; its flowing rivers ; its fertile valleys, and its smiling
plains. It recalls the lost, the distant, and the dead ! Oh,
blessed sound that conjures up the dear loved faces, the
sweet familiar voices, and all the thousand happy memories
of old ! Nell, sing us the sweet old song you sang the other
night.
Nell. I fear my heart’s too full, but if you’ll bear with
me i’ll try !
Song — Nell. —“ Home , Sweet Home.”

book.) It is too late to pay it into the bank.

Sybil. I’ve heard too much already ! From the very
moment of my arrival you’ve insulted me !
Ben. Insulted !
Sybil. For the past six months your every word—every
look—has been an outrage. (Xes to ». and up r.c.)
Ben. (1.c.) An outrage !
Sybil, (r.c.) I said an outrage—and now you
Ben. Now, I come to ask your forgiveness.
Sybil. (Obdurately.) Before I can forgive, I must forget.
Ben. “ Forget ! ” Forget what ? Forget that he who
out of the depth of his love, the agony of his despair—
wronged you, loved you then— loves you now, beyond all
hope of happiness in this world, or salvation in the next !
Nay, more, that he would gladly lay down the burthen of
of his wretched life to spare yours one single pang. Think
of that—and then—“ forget ” me—if you can !
(Exit Ben. l. 2 b.
Sybil. (Solus.) “Forget!” Forget his manliness—his
devotion—above all —his great love. And forgive ? Ah
dear! though my proud heart would never let me speak the
words, I forgave you long ago. But I will take it all back !
(Runs over to l. calling) Lionel! Lionel! Too late.
He's gone ! Is it not strange that I who can see so clearly
for others am blind as a mole in my own light ? When a
moment ago my heart prompted my tongue to say, “ I love
you, dear—l love you ! ” the recollection of his unjust
suspicions stirred my hot blood and my wayward temper
into fire—and now we are further apart than ever. But it
shall be our last misunderstanding, for to-morrow —yes,
to-morrow—l will bare my heart before him—and then,
Lionel—my Lionel—

Nell. I am sorry.
Capt. Sorrow can’t help me, but you can.
N ell. I ? Can you ask me after ?
Capt. I know all you would say ; but I was drunk—mad.
You will forgive me, if only for the child’s sake, won’t you ?
And you won't leave me to die of cold and hunger ; you
haven’t the heart to do it.
Nell. How can I help you ?

Nell. I have only a few shillings.
Capt. Well —they will suffice for food and shelter.
Nell. You don’t deserve it ; but I’ll see what I can do.

Sybil, (e.c.) The child whom you abandoned, while you
left his mother to the tender mercies of the streets. Go,
whilst you are safe ! Within hail there are men—men who
will know how to deal with a scoundrel like you.

Sybil. Unless you wish me to summon the police to

broke.
Sybil. How much do you require ?
Capt. Thirty pounds.
Sybil. If I give it, will you go ?
Capt. Upon my honour.
Sybil. Your honour ?
Capt. Well, the security’s shaky, but it's the best I’ve got.
Sybil. (Contemptuously.) Bad is the best —but needs
must
Capt. When the devil drives. [With a sneer.)
Sybil. Just so ; one moment. (Goes up to hotel door, is
seen to cross behind window from R. to L.)
Capt. (Solus.) Well—l’ve landed that thirty quid, any-
how—l feel as if I had it already.
Be-enter Sybil crossing rapidly from l. to r. behind tvindow,
and entering from hotel door.
(Sybil takes out purse, and handing three Bank of
England notes to Capt.—)
Sybil. ’Tis nearly all I have in the world, but take it—take
it and begone.
Capt. I’m off. A fond, a last farewell to Nellie ; and a
blessing, a broken-hearted father’s blessing, to the boy.
Farewell, be happy as you are virtuous—ta, ta— so long—
ta, ta 1
[.Bows, laughs, and exits l. 2 b., followed by Wall.
Sybil, (c.) I have saved my darling. She will never look
upon his odious face, or hear his hateful voice again.
Sheltered by the strong arras and the faithful heart of the


man who loves her, and whom she loves, her happiness is
secure. ( Approaches door.) And I—yes, I shall be happy
too, for he will know the truth at last.

Front wood. A large log of fallen tree c. Feeds and rushes in
the foreground.
Music.— Capt.’s Music.
Enter Capt. l. Ib., hurriedly, looking round. He throws
himself breathless and exhausted on the log.
Capt. {Opens pocket-book and takes out notes.) Twenty of
’em—two thousand quid—enough to make a fresh start
with. Found on me here they mean death. Yet to
lose ’em involves privation and misery worse than death.
Death ! Self preservation is the first law of Nature, and
’twas a lucky inspiration to put the job on that lout of a
sailor. Yes; I’d rather he should swing for it than I.
While he is laid by the heels I can bolt and reach ’Frisco.
Once there, I can change these into coin; meanwhile where
can I hide ’em! Where, where? (Vises, looks off r.h.,
during which action —)

Poor Nell poor little Nell. (Sits. Takes flask from
pocket and drinks.) So—that’s better—as for these, on
second thoughts I’ll keep ’em and chance it. (Putting
pocket-book in breast pocket.)
Enter Jerky, l. 1 e.
Jerry, (l.c ) Well, you are a nice ’un, you are, to mop
the drop on a pal. The idea of leavin’ a cove in the street
on such a beastly night. And you call yourself Jonnuck ?
Capt. I was in the street myself.
Jerry. No ?
Capt. Yes !
Fe-enter Wall. r. Ib. He hides behind log and overhears
the subsequent conversation.


Jerry, (1.c.) Oh ! that alters the case. (He sits down
beside Cart.) You didn’t nobble that two thousand quid
then, arter all? ( Eyes him suspiciously.)
Capt. How could I, when someone else had been there
before me ?
Jerry The ruinous effect of competition in business. {Pause,
then significantly.) I say, this is a hawful fakement, this is.
Capt. What is ?
Jerry. Why, the cookin’ o’ that yere pore little donah’s
goose !
Capt. {With a shudder.) It is awful.
Jerry. H’ra, I believe yer. {Pause.) Do you think it
was the sailor wot put the peas in the pot ?
Capt. Looks like it. (They eye each other doubtfully.)
Jerry. H’m—M’yes—but the darbies ain’t allays on the
right wristesses, you know. Did you raally see him put it
through ?
Capt. Of course I did.
Jerry. Well, it’s a big plug to chaw !
Capt. {Rises — annoyed.) Big or little, it has to be
swallowed. {Abruptly.) By the by, we may both be
wanted about that job at the Golden Hole.
Jerry. [Alarmed.) Ginger beer!
Capt. So you’d better bunk at once. Train starts in
half an hour. Take the rail to Albany, catch the boat, and
in a few days you’ll be safe in Sydney !
Jerry. {Rises.) It’s all very fine to say “ Take the rail and
catch the boat ” —but who’s to do it without a blessed mag ?
Capt. H’m—l nobbled a bit last night.
Jerry. A bit—who did you do ?
Capt. Never mind, so long as it was done. Here’s a
fiver and a golden Jimmy. {Gives flash note and gold.)
Jerry. Oh! roast me quick and do me tender!
(Delighted.) Well, you are a oner to stand by a pal in a
hole, you is. But I say—( Suspiciously ) —look here, as
we’re both in it, why don’t you bunk too 1
Capt. Because I have to wait till to-night for more oof !
Jerry. Oh, got summut else on, eh ? {Suspiciously.)
Capt. ( Annoyed at his distrust.) Yes, damn you, yea!
Jerry. ’Nuff said—l’m off. {Going t.ii., stops.) By the
by, hand over my chivy.
Capt. (r.c.) Your chivy?
Jerry. Yes, my knife —the knife I lent you last night.
Capt. Oh, the knife—l remember—of course.
Jerry, In course you does, so weigh out.
Capt. {Pretends to search his pockets.) Where can it be?
I suppose I must have dropped it.


Jerry. The doose, you have? But look here, it was a
love token from my donah, and if I go back without it
Sally’ll play up “Dicky round the orchard.”
Capt. Better that than be coppered here.
Jerry. {Alarmed.) Right you are, my oracle. I takes
your tip and slings my hook—sudden! ( Moves L. ) When
you race with the bobbies it’s no use beatin’ ’em by a head,
you’ve got to leave ’em at the start. You can stay for the
finish, but I means to come in fust, flags down, so here goes.

Ward. And in that way she died ?
Dick. Aye ! She never spoke again.
Ward. You knew deceased well ?
Dick. Aye, for su —ur.
Ward. It is reported you were engaged to each other 2
Dick. Aye, aye, we were, and suld ha’ been wed if it hadna
bin—if it hadna bin—poor wench—poor wench.
Ward. You know the prisoner at the bar 1
Dick Know Sailor Jack, aye ! We’ve worked side by
aide ever sin he cum to Coolgardie !
Myles, (l.) Ave coorse he did, and so did a hape of us
on the same side —all round him, ye know.
Ward. Silence in Court!
Kath. (l.) But sure it is the truth my boy’s spakin’ !
Myles. Of coorse it is ; divil a lie in it.
Mac. Silence !
Kath. Don’t ye want the truth 2
Mac. Oh, shut up, woman ! {Xes over to Kath.)


Kath. Arrah ! who are you callin’ a woman, I'd like to
know, Misther Mac ?
Ward. Remove them both.
Mac. Come on now ! (Mac. seizes Myles— they struggle
behind warders’ bench down to ». H. ’ Kathleen follotvs them
in front. By one clean and dexterous movement Mac. swings
Myles into arms of Police. The following dialogue up to
and inclusive of Kathleen’s exit speech accompanies the
above action .)
Myles. Divil a peg I’ll stir out o’ this.
Kath. That’s right, Myles.
Mac. Come along !
Kath. Take your hands from my boy, or I’ll be afther
laying my ten commandments on your ugly face.
Mac. Out you go.
Myles. Hands off! I’ll not be chucked.
(Excitement in Court. Myles is thrust off's.. le. by Police.)
Kath. Don’t hurt my boy. {Shrieks.) Och, murdher,
,there goes his coat. ( Follows Them off r. le. expostulating.)
Ward. Really, these interruptions are scandalous. Let
us get on with the case. H’m ! I believe prisoner was also
attached to deceased. Was he not ?
Dick. Well, if he wur, ah never heerd on it.
Ward. Then I presume there had been no quarrel
between them on your account ?
Dick. None as ah know of.
Ward. Were you present when deceased took charge of
the bank notes for £2OOO that are missing ?
Dick. I wur.
Ward. Was the prisoner there ?
Dick. Aye, for sure.
Ward. Are the numbers of the notes known ? (To Glen.)
Glen. (r. of table.) Oh yes. And I have just been to
the bank to atop them.
Ward. In that case the crime won’t be of much service
to the criminal.
Glen. Not much. In fact, the notes may lead to his
detection.
Ward. Let us hope they may. {To Dick.) When did
you last see deceased prior to—to the murder ?
Dick. Abawt hafe-past eleven last neet.
Ward. Was there anything peculiar in her demeanour
at that time 1
Dick. Well, there was summat peculiar.
Ward. Something remarkable ?
Dick. Aye, vaary remarkable.


Ward. What did she say ?
Dick. Not much, but she did a lot.
Ward. What did she do ?
Dick. That’s ma business.
Ward. What did she do?
Dick. Mun ah tell him, Ben ?
Ben. (l. of table.) Yes, certainly.
Dick. Well, she put her arms round my neck and kissed
me, and whispered, “Ah love you, Dick! Ah love you ! ”
And so she did, God bless her ! So she did ! ( Overcome
with emotion , he breaks down.)
Ward. {With sympathy.) Mr. Garth, I have no further
questions to ask.
Ben. And I have none. Stand down, Dick.

Dick. Ma poor lass, ma poor lass. {Exit Dick r. 1 e.

Myles. Ah, ha ! ye want me back after kicking me out ?
Well, ye’ve got me fresh from the gutter wid the bloom
upon me. Look here, now, at one of the daisies ! ( Shows
stains of mud.)
Kath. Myles, behave yourself now.
Myles. Divil a fear o’ that, darling. Well, I bear no
malice, so shake hands all round. {Eagerly shakes hands
with Jack, Ward., Policemen, All within reach.) How
are yez, owld Mac? How are yez, Jack ? How are yez, Ben?
How are yez, Mr Warden ? How are yez, everybody ?
{Leaps on table.)
Ward. Get off the table, sir.
Myles. What’s wrong wid the table ? (Ben remonstrates
with Myles.) Sure, it’s only the chair that’s wantin’ !
Hand one up and I’ll sit down, as we do at Clonakilty.
Mac. Come off that and come into the box !
Kath. Ah, don’t, Myles, don’t!
Myles. I won’t. Divil a hinge ye’ll put on me. There !

Bad luck to yez ; lave go the scruff of me neck.
{Leaps among the Crowd l. Mac. pursues him.
he leaps out at top , runs over to R. , and leaps
again among Crowd. Mac. pursues him and pulls
him out R. and lands him in the witness box.)
Mac. {Thrusting him in witness box.) Get into the
box, sir.


Myles. Arrah, do ye call this thing a box ? Look at
it, Katty.
Kath. (Standing on chair and looking into box.) I do, and
sure it’s a pew widout a sate, so it is.
Mac. Take the Book and take the oath. “ The evidence
you shall give the Court shall be the truth, the whole
truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you ”
Myles. Aisy wid yez, sure I know the rest. ( Kisses Book
with a loud smack.) But I must say ye have the quarest
way
Ward. Hold your tongue, sir ! Now answer me.
Kath. Arrah, how can the poor boy answer your Honour
if he howlds his tongue ?
(Murmur of voices.)
Mao. Silence!
Wakd. You know the prisoner at the bar ?
Myles. Know Sailor Jack ? Av course I do. Many’s
the drink he has stood me.
Ward. That’s immaterial now.
Myles. But it was might convaynient then, wasn’t
it, Katty ?
Kath. Thrue for ye ; for many’s the score he paid for you
in bad times.
Ward. When did you see him last ?
Myles. This minute, when I looked at him.
Ward. Yes, yes, but we are referring to yesterday.
Myles. Ye may be referring to yesterday, but you are
spakin’ to-day, your Honour.
Kath. Av coorse ye are.
(Laughter in Court.)
Mao. Silence!
Ward. You knew deceased?
Myles. Troth did I, and the brightest little blue-eyed
colleen she was that ever stepped in shoe leather; while, as
for her feet
Ward. Never mind her feet, we can get on without them.
Myles. But she couldn’t. How the divil could she, I’d
like to know 1
(Laughter.)
Mao. Silence !
Ward. Were she and the prisoner on terms of
intimacy ?
Myles. They were as thick as thieves.
Ward. Did they ever fall out ?
Myles. Divil a bit; sure no one could fall out with
Sailor Jack.


Ward. Why not 2
Myles. Bekase it takes two to make a quarrel, and that
fellow there hasn’t the heart to kill a fly or a flea, let alone
a woman. /
Ward. Were you present at the scene of the murder 2
Myles. I was, to my sorrow.
Ward. How came you there 2
My'LES. Oh ! aisy enough ! on my feet 1 Te see I’d just
had a taste of a scrimmage—enough to give me an appetite
—when I heerd cries of ‘‘Murder,” and thinking there was
another bit of a fight on I tuk my shillelagh wid me, by
way av bein’ social.
Ward. When you arrived in the Square, what did you see 2
Myles. A sight I’ll never forget. The poor darlin’ lyin’
in the street in her nightgown, all over blood.
Ward. What did she say 2
Myles. Say, arrah! What does a pig say when his throat’s
cut 2
Ward. What did she say, sir 2
Myles. Notin’ at all ! And them’s the very words she
uttered. Weren’t they, Katty, darlin’ 2
Kath. Iss, indeed, for I heerd them myself.
Ward. I can do nothing with you, my good man.
Myles. And, begorra, I can do less wid you, my good man.
Kath. Ah ! whist, Myles.
Myles. Oh ! I am spaiohless, honey.
Ben. I have no questions to ask this witness, your
Honour.
Myles. Then you are answered in full, wid fluency.
Long life to you, Ben. (Myles stands down.)
Kath. Well, Myles, ye gave the Warden as good as he
brought.
Myles. Divil a fear, but owld Finn got thirty shillings
for his one pound ten. (A roar of laughter. He hows and
she curtsies to Warden as they cross over to l. They shake
hands with Jack and sit under dock. )
Mac. Order ! order !
Glen. (To Ward.) Rum idea of order. I wonder how
they would deal with these chappies at Bow Street 2
Ward. With our rough-and-ready community, strict rule
is impossible. But they get justice, and that is all we want
in Ooolgardie. Call the next witness.
Mac. John Wantley.
Yoicb. (Without r.) John Wantley.
Enter Captain Jack. He is sworn.
Ward. Now, sir, you knew deceased!


Want. Yes.
Ward. She was your wife ?
Capt. Not exactly.
Wakd. Well, I suppose she ought to have been ?
Capt. If you like to put it that way.
Ben. {lndignantly interrupting.) You were the father
of her child anyhow !
Capt. She told me so. ( With a sneer.)
Kath. (l. Indignantly.) Arrah, do you hear that, Myles ?
{Angrily.)
Myles, (l.) Oh ! the dirty blackguard ; let me get at him.
(Myles tries to strip off his coat to get at Capt., but is restrained
by Kath. )
Mac. Order ! order !
Ward. {Severely.) Really, Mr Leigh, these interruptions
are intolerable.
Ben. I beg your Honour’s pardon.
Ward. H’m ! Did you see deceased last night 1
Capt. Yes.
Ward. Where ?
Capt. At the door of the “ Erin Go Bragh.”
Ward. Did you have any conversation with her 1
Capt. Yes.
Ward. What took place ?
Capt. I asked her to come home.
Ward. And she 1
Capt. Well, her sister interrupted us—
Ward. And the result ?
Capt. She refused.
Ward. And ?
Capt. I went one way ; they went another.
Ward. H’m ! Did you see her again before the murder ?
Capt. No.
Ward. Did you see her afterwards ?
Capt. Yes.
Ward. State precisely what occurred.
Capt. Passing by the Bank of Australasia I heard cries
-of “Help—murder.”
Ward. Yes.
Capt. As I came up I saw deceased struggling with the
prisoner.
Ward. You are sure it was the prisoner ?
Capt. Quite sure.
Myles. {Aside.) Oh, the monumental Ananias ! (l.)
Kath, {Aside.) Aisy, Myles, aisy. (l.)
Ward. Well, what followed ?
Capt. A knife flashed in the air, and with a cry, she fell


to the earth. I accused prisoner of the murder and gave
him in charge.
Myles. Ye did 1 ye lyin’ vagabone ! ye did !
Mac. Silence !
Ward. Mr. Leigh, have you any questions to ask the
witness ?
Ben. A great many, your Honour. (Ben. rises to cross-
examine Wantley.) Now, sir, attend to me. Were you
not formerly in Her Majesty’s service ?
Cart. I was.
Ben. An officer, I believe ?
Capt. I was, and proud of my regiment.
Ben. Was your regiment proud of you ?
Capt. ( Angrily .) Sir !
Ben. Were you not called upon to send in your papers?
Capt. That has nothing to do with this inquiry.
Ben. But it has a great deal to do with the credence to
be attached to your evidence. Did you send in your papers
in consequence of having been detected cheating at cards ?
Yes or no.
Capt. I decline to answer.
Ben. Yery good. Your Honour can draw your own
inference. H’ra ! You know the prisoner at the bar ?
Capt. Yes.
Ben. When did you last see him prior to —to—the
murder ?
Capt. A week ago.
Ben. Where ?
Capt. At “The Golden Hole.”
Ben. Was that on the occasion when you robbed me of a
thousand pounds ?
Capt. I don’t know about robbery.
Ben. But I do ; and if needs be I shall prove it.
Ward. Mr Leigh, Mr Leigh, you really must proceed by
the rules of evidence.
Ben. Rules ! Rules that shelter subterfuge and false-
hood. Good God, sir, can’t you see I’m battling for my
brother’s life, and yet you seek to fetter me by rotten
“rules of evidence.”
Ward. Yery well, sir, go on ; conduct your case in your
own way.
Ben. I will, sir.
Myles. More power to ye, Ben.
Mac. Silence !
Ben. When did you last see the prisoner prim' to the
robbery at “The Golden Hole ? ”
Capt. I forget.


Ben. Try to remember. Was it not six months ago,
when you attempted to steal the great nugget; and, failing
that, you and your mates tried to murder him ?
Capt. Murder ! Rubbish ! We fought, and he had the
best of it through you.
Myles. As he will now, plase God.
Kath. Amin !
Mac. Silence ! (Xes to r.)
Ben. Is it a fact that I got back the thousand pounds
you robbed me of ?
Capt. It is a fact that you drugged and hocussed us, and
left us to die out there in the bush.
Ward. Obviously you didn’t die.
Kath. Of course not. Them that are born to be hanged
may be drugged, but they’ll never be drowned.
Myles. Thrue for yez, darlin’ ! {Hoar of laughter.)
Mac. Silence !
Ben. Will you swear that your object in coming to the
“ Erin Go Bragh ” last night was not to rob me again of that
£lOOO ?
Capt. I will.
Ben. Take care. Did this unhappy woman not endeavour
to prevent the robbery 2
Capt. How should I know 1
Ben. I will tell you by and by. Meanwhile, with your
Honour’s permission, I’ll postpone the further examination
of this witness.
Ward. Certainly. Stand down, sir.
(Capt. is about to go n.)
Ben. But don’t leave the Court.
(Mac. prevents his leaving.)
Mob. Yah !
Mac. Order, order !
( Capt. sits down in front of witness box.)
Ward. Really, if this goes on, I shall order the Court to
be cleared.
Myles. Aisy, boys, aisy, unless you want to get the
order of “ the chuck.” ( Roars of laughter.)
Ben. I shall not waste your Honour’s time by making
any preliminary observations for the defence, but shall
proceed at once, not only to prove the prisoner’s innocence
of any complicity in this atrocious crime, but to bring it
home to the real murderer. ( Sensation in Court.) Call
Sybil Grey.
Mac. Sybil Grey. (He stands in front of Captain so that
Sybil does not see him when she enters.)
Music.


Enter Sybil. Silence and sympathy the moment she
appears. Glendakgle approaches and. assists her into
witness box. She is sworn by Mac.
Ben. Miss Grey —the deceased Nelly Grey —was your
sister ?
Sybil. My only one.
Ben. Look at the prisoner at the bar. (She does so.}
Do you know him ?
Sybil. Certainly.
Ben. Did your sister know him ?
Sybil. Up to yesterday he was one of her most intimate
friends.
Ben. Did anything occur in the course of the day to
interrupt their friendship 1
Sybil. Not that I am aware of.
Ben. When did you last see your sister prior to the—
the murder 1
Sybil. About half-past eleven last night.
Ben. Where ?
Sybil. Just outside the door of the “Erin Go Bragh.”
Ben. Was she alone ?
Sybil. No.
Ben. Who was with her ?
Sybil. A—a—man.
Ben. If you were to see that man again, would you—
remember him
Sybil. {Bitterly.) Remember 1 I shall never forget him.
Ben. Is he in Court ?
Sybil. I don’t know.
Ben. Step down and look round.
Music.
(Sybil slowly descends , assisted by Glen. Ben. Xes to k.c.
while she Xes to 1., scans the Spectators as she faces round
to b. She catches sight of Capt.)
Sybil. {Pointing to Capt. ) That is the man !
(Capt. starts up.)
(A Tableau of general excitement.)
{After a momentary pause.)
Ben. (b.) You are sure of that 1
Sybil, (l.) Quite sure.
Capt. Just so ! We met last night. I little thought we
should meet again so soon, and on so sad an occasion ; but
we can mingle our tears together, can’t we, Duchess ?
Sybil. Wretch ! don’t speak—don’t look at me ! The


sight of your face—the sound of your voice—sets my blood
on fire.
Oapt. Dear me ! I’d no idea you were so combustible !
Sybil. Don’t dare to mock my misery. You may baffle
human justice, but you can’t escape Divine vengeance. It
may not be to-day or to-morrow —next week or next year—
but it will come as surely as I stand here ; and when it does
come, God grant I may be there to see.
Ben. Amen ! amen ! Now tell the Court what took place
during your interview with this gentleman.
Sybil, (1.c.) Must I—must I ?
Ben. The life of an innocent man is at stake.
Sybil. I — l (A pause.)
Ward. The Court is already aware, Mias Grey, of the
unfortunate relations between your sister and yonder person,
and the truth cannot shame you.
(Sybil looks appealingly at Ben.)
Sybil. Must I ?
Ben. Speak.
Sybil. He was endeavouring to induce my sister to return
to him to share his infamous life. I refused to permit it.
He threatened to expose us both, unless we paid him a sum
of money.
Ben. Did you do so ?
Sybil. Yes.
Ben. How much ?
Sybil. Thirty pounds.
Ben. When you had submitted to this extortion
Capt. {lnterrupting.) Extortion !
Ben. I said extortion ! What followed ?
Sybil. He left us for good, as I imagined. ( Significantly.)
I saw my sister to her own chamber and returned to mine.
Ben. And then ?
Sybil. I had barely got to rest when I was aroused by a
piercing cry of “Murder!’’ It was her voice. I rushed
out, and found her stabbed to the heart and dying in the
street.
Ben. Was she alone?
Sybil. No ! The prisoner was supporting her.
Ben. Now, I ask you, was there anything to indicate, or
even to suggest, that he had murdered her ?
Sybil. Nothing whatever.
Jack. God bless you, Duchess.
Sybil. I know who murdered her! God knows ! and in
His own good time He will make it known to all the world.
(Fixing her eye on the Capt.)


Ben. He will ! He will ! be sure of that.
(Ben. resumes his old place L. of table for remainder of
cross examination.)
Ward. Sit down, Miss Grey.
Kath. ( Supporting Sybil.) Keep up, darlin’, keep up.
Sure God’s good, and we’re all in His hands.
Sybil. I know it ! I know it I
{Sitting l. of table under the dock. She fixes the Captain
with her eyes. He tries to avert her gaze ; every time
that he does so, he is drawn back to her in spite of
himself.)
Ben. ( Commencing cross-examination. To Capt.) Captain
Wantley, I should like to ask you a few more questions.
(Capt. moves as if about to re-enter the box.)
Ward. Don’t trouble to return to the box ; reply where
you stand.
Ben. Now, sir, you have heard the last witness. Is it
true that she gave you thirty pounds last night 2
Capt. Yes.
Ben. Then why didn’t you tell us before 2
Capt. Because I didn’t think it necessary.
Myles. But you got the money all the same, you bla’guard.
(A laugh.)
Mac. Order, order ! ♦
Ben. Well, sir, after you had levied this blackmail
Capt. ( Indignantly .) Blackmail!
Ben. I said blackmail !
Ward. Really, Mr Leigh, this exceeds the licence of the
advocate.
Ben. Licence ! licence! God grant me patience! “ Black-
mail ” is an English word which has a precise significance ;
so whether you like it or not, Mr Warden, I stick to the
word which denotes the infamous occupation of a scoundrel.
Ward. Well, go on, sir, go on !
Ben. So, sir, after you had levied this “blackmail” you
took your departure.
Capt. I did. (Sullenly.)
Ben. And you say you did not see deceased again until
the moment of the murder 2
Capt. I did not.
Re-enter Dick hastily, r. 1 b.
Dick. One moment, Mr Warden, ah’ve summat important
to say to Ben. May ah speak wi’ him jest hafe a minit 2
Ward. Certainly.
(Capt. resumes his seat. Ben comes rapidly down the front
to Dick who whispers to him.)


Ben. (Aflame, aside.) You don’t mean it, man? You
don’t mean it ?
Dick. ( The same.) But ah do tho’.
Ben. (Aside.) Thank God ! thank God ! If what you say
he true
Dick. It’s God’s truth.
Ben. Why, then, I hold his life within my hand. Come,
lad, come, quick, quick.
[Exeunt Ben and Dick rapidly u. 1 e.
Jack. Please, your Honour, mayn’t I have a look in here 1
Ward. Better hold your tongue.
Jack. But I can’t, while that lubber’s lyin’ like a lodging-
house crimp. Ye see it’s like this—l’d just turned into my
hammock
'Ward. Mind ! Every word you say may be used against
you.
Jack. The truth can’t harm me, your Honour. You see
I’d just dropped off to sleep when I heard a scream ; then
came cries of “ Murder.’’ It was poor little Nell’s voice. So
I jumped into my duds, crowded all sail for the spot, and
found her staggerin’ about like a water-logged barque in a
gale. At sight of me she lurches forrard, and founders in
my arms, for the poor lass was Weedin’ to death—and that’s
all I know about this cursed business. Ah, Duchess, if
I’m getting water-logged it isn’t for myself, it’s for her and
poor Dick, and for you, dear—for you.
(Sybil extends her hand, he hisses it, clasps it in both his,
and falls silently weeping over it.)
Myles. ( With sympathy and tenderness.) Arrah, don’t
take on so, man alive ! Sure, it’ll all come right by
and by. Remember, “ There’s a sweet little cherub that
sits up aloft to keep a look-out for poor Jack.”
Kath. Luk, luk, Myles ! Here’s Ben and Dick cornin’
back.
Myles. Then—Attention ! Heads up ! Eyes right! As
you was before you wur down in the mouth.
(Jack stands erect and confident.)
(From this moment all is excitement to the end of Act.)
Re-enter Ben and Dick r. 1 e. , in a fever heat.
Ben. (c. Triumphant, aside.) I have him, man alive, I
have him.
Dick. (Aside r. 0.) Ah wish ah had, ah’d shake the life
out of his cowardly carcase.
Ben. (Aside.) And cheat the hangman ? No! leave him
to me —to me. Be sure you have them ready when I call.


Dick. (Aside.) No fear. [Exit r. 1 b.
Ben. (Returns to table L.c.) Now, sir, may I trouble you to
stand up again ? (Capt. stands up.) You have sworn that
when you arrived at the scene of the murder, you saw
deceased struggling with the prisoner 1
Capt. I have.
Ben. You have also sworn that you saw a knife flashing
in the air ?
Capt. And so I did.
Ben. Would you know that knife again if you saw it ?
Capt. Certainly.
Ben. Was it anything like— (showing knife) —this? (Great
excitement in Court.)
Capt. (Staggered.) No—o !
Ben. That you swear ?
Capt. That I swear.
Ben. Very good. (Captain sits.) Call Wallaroo, the black!
Mac. Wallaroo ! Wallaroo !
(Wall, springs on r. 1 e. and bounds into witness box.)
Wall. Here, Massa Ben.
Ben. (To Wall.) Now, attend, Wallaroo. Have you
ever seen this knife before ?
Wall. Yohi!
Ben. Where ?
Wall. At de cross roads des morning, when dat dar dam
tief throw him away among de rushes, and Wallaroo find
him and bring him here !
Capt. ( Starts up.) The blao,k beast lies. I never saw the
cursed thing in my life before !
Ben. W'e shall see about that. Call Jeremiah Simpson.
Mac. Jeremiah Simpson ! (Calling off stage R.)
Capt. (Aside, derisively.) Ay, call away ; he is half-way
to Southern Cross by this time.
Jerry. (Outside.) ’Ere, I say. Take your knuckles out
o’ my neck I
Capt. My God, he is here !
Enter The Larr. in charge of a Policeman r. 1 e.
Ben. (Quickly to Mac.) Keep those men apart. (Mac.
quickly stands between them.) Now, sir, look at this knife.
Have you ever seen it before ?
Jerry. Seein’ it’s my own, in course I ’ave.
Ben. When did you see it last ?
Jerry. Last night.
Ben. Did you lose it or sell it ?
Jerry. Neither.
Ben. What did you do with it ?


Jerry. Lent it.
Ben. To whom ?
Jerry. To the Captain there. (Points to him.)
Capt. {Passionately.) A lie, a lie ! A cursed lie ! Let
me pass ! Let me pass, I say ! {All start up.)
{Rushing over to R. is confronted by Dick, who re-enters 1 b.r.)
Dick. Not this way.
(Capt. now darts over 1., is confronted by Myles.)
Myles, (l.) No, nor this.
(Myles and Ben simultaneously seize Capt. By one clean
and dexterous movement they swing him round to K.c. In the
struggle pocket-book falls to ground L.c.)
Kath. (l. Pointing to book.) Luk ! Ink !
Sybil, (l.c. Snatching up book and plucking out notes.)
Ha ! The notes— the stolen notes ! {Bolds them up in her
r. hand.)
Ben. (c. With his right hand holds Captain by throat,
forcing him to his knees, with his left hand pointing to the
stolen notes.) Assassin, behold the proof of your guilt!
Warden. {Rising without an instant’s pause, and in a voice
which dominates the crowd.) John Wantley, you are com-
mitted to take your trial for the wilful murder of Nellie
Grey!

ACT V.
“ WALLAROO'S LAST WORD.”
{An elapse of three months between Acts IV. and V.)
{lrish Airs between Acts.)
{The new “Erin Go Bragh.”)
A bright scene occupying all the stage. The pavillion gaily-
decked with bunting, flags, etc. Streamers across with
“ Welcome to the Erin Go Bragh,” palms, ferns, etc.
Furniture —• A couple of plaster statues, a couple of
mirrors, o. —An opening, steps, platform balcony, backed
by view of Goolgardie. l.tj.e. — Smart bar. l. 2 e.—
Small conservatory. r.h. —Opening leading off to dining
saloon. Inscription —“ Dining Saloon,” “ Cead Millia
Failtha. ”
Small table covered -with wedding presents.
A pearl necklace, a brooch of rubies, a bracelet, and a
diamond ring.
Enter Kathleex l.d. in bridal array.
Kath. So this is my weddin’ mom! Not a wink could I
shleep this blessed night for thinking of it and of him —the
rapscallion that robbed me of my heart. But if he stole mine,-
sure he gave me his on the fair May momin’ long ago.
Song, Kathleen.
(Myles, in wedding dress, springs on stage from r.u.e.
They leap into each other’s arms.)
Music ceases.
Myles, (1.c.) Darlin’, let me lave my heart on your Kps, that
I may know it’s awake I am, and not dhramin’, this blessed
mornin’, that makes the two of us one. {Embracing ardently.)
Kath. (r.c.) Aisy, Myles, aisy, ye thayfe o’ the worls’, or it’s
tearin’ the weddin’ dress off my back ye’ll be.
Myles. The saints forbid !
Kath. Well, what d’ye think of it?
Myles. Falx, I can’t see the dhress for lookin’ at you!
Sure it’s you I’m marryiu’, and not your clo’es.
Kath. For all that, you might have the manners to tell me
what you think of the gown.


Myles. Sure its raygal. The Princess of Wales — long life
to her! —couldn’t be more gorgeous,
Kath. I’m glad o’ that, for the Duchess made every blessed
bit of it wid her own purty fingers.
Myles. More power to her ! It’s the daisy she is !
Kath. Then what do you think of my weddin’ presents ?
The girls sent thim, and the boys those, and the Warden that,
and Mrs. Finnerty and the girls—bless their pretty faces! —those.
(Showing things spread out on sideboard, then quickly indi-
cating necklace, brooch, bracelet, and ring.) These pearls
were from Ben—bless his heart! —the rubies from Sailor
Jack; the bangle from Yorkshire Dick; and this beautiful
ring from the Duchess herself.
Myles. (Taking wedding ring from vest pocket and un-
rolling three or four coverings of tissue paper, then tenderly) —
And this plain one from poor Myles. Let’s thry if it’ll fit.
Kath. I’ll not put it on without the keeper. They say it’s
unlucky. Where’s the keeper p
Myles. Here! Sure ’tis myself is the keeper! And I’ll
keep yez in sickness and health, in poverty or wealth, for
ever and ever till death do us part.
Kath . Amin!
Myles. ( With tenderness and ardour.) That’s my own colleen
dhas! As for these, what are the diamonds to the jewels in
your precious eyes ? The pearls to thim in that purty mouth ?
Or the rubies to the roses on your beautiful lips ? Sure whin
I thry to remember you’re mine—my own —my very own—
begorra I can’t believe my good fortune, and I expect to wake
up and find you fading away like a fairy gift, or floatin’ into
the air like a handful of thistledown.
Kath. Myles, dear, don’t —I can’t bear it. It’s spoiliu’ me
you are. Sure, it’s only a stupid little woman lam and not an
angel.
Myles. It’s better than an angel ye are—for you’ve no wings
to fly away wid, so ye’ll have to stay here wid me and set up a
little paradise of your own, till the time comes for you to go
straight up to glory. Thin, bad luck to me, if I don’t hang
on to the tail of your skirt till you reach the Goolden Gates,
and maybe St. Father, who they say’s a dacent old gintleman,
will let me slip in unbeknownst just to keep you company.
Kath. Don’t be profane, sir ! Sure it’s one big blush you’re
makin’ me from head to foot.
Myles. Blush away, darling, your blushes become your
beauty, and it’s beautiful as a butterfly ye are this blessed
minit, so come to my arms once more, aohora alanna acushla
mabhree. [Embrace.)
Enter Glen., Bridesmen, and Bridesmaids from R.c.


Glen. Ha ! ha ! we caught you at it!
Omnes laugh.
Myles. (1.c.) Faith, then, you couldn’t catch me at a better
occupation. (Omnes laugh.)
Glen, (c.) Certainly not. But before the awful ceremony
takes place, let me present this little souvenir to the bride.
( Producing a gold watch and chain.)
Kath. A goold watch is it ?
Myles. Wid a chain as long as a rope and as thick as my
arm.
Glen. By your leave, Katty. ( Puts the chain round her
neck.) There you are, and that’s my wedding present.
Enter Yon Swop r.c., struggling forward with a cradle,
showily got up.
Yon Swop. And dis is mine ! (c.)
(A roar of laughter.)
Myles, (1.c.) G’long wid yen, ye ould villyan, sure we’ll not
be wantin’ that those twelve months.
{A roar.)
(Myles drives Yon Swop off the stage r. He comes in contact
with Jerry who enters door r. Both Jerry and Yon Swop
are spilled by the impact. Yon Swop gets off toith the cradle.
Jerry pulls himself together. He is a grotesque object, sup-
posed to be a waiter, and dressed in a suit twice too big for
him.)
Myles. Mother o’ Moses! what in the name o’ fate brings
this scarecrow here ?
Jerry, (r. With dignity.) Ax the missus.
Myles. Katty ?
Katty. (c.) Well, you see the crayture saved Sailor Jack’s life,
and as he was left high and dry widout a shilling or a shirt
Jerry. ’Ere —’ard —’ere —’ard—Don’t give me away afore
the company. If I hadn’t a shillin’ I had a shirt—leastways
a dickey ! Hobserve! There’s no deception ! ( Striking an
attitude.)
Glen, (l.) So you made him a waiter, Kitty ?
Myles. An Aunt Sally you mane! Begorra but it’s a for-
tune he’d be at the races at three shies a penny.
Jerry. ( Advancing r. confidentially to Kath.) Never mind
him, Missus. You’ll find me ’andy, and frolicsome as a fly in
a sugar basin when the grub is about.
Myles. What ? in them things ?
Jerry. Well, they was the only ready-made dress suit old
Von Swop had in stock. Don’t you be uneasy, I’ll make em


fit. If they don’t shrink I must expand. Only wait till
dinner is on. ( Grins suggestively.)
Kath. Come here, ye omadhaun, and let me thry to make
ye daycent. (Swinging him round to 1.c., and re-arranging
his cravat.)
Jerry, (1.c.) Easy does it, Missis, easy ! They’re tender as
tinder, and if they guy way I might suddenly appear as the
Greecian statue Neptune risin’ from the sea, in the full nauti-
cal dress of the period.
Kath. Be off wid yer impudence ! ( Boxes his ears.)
Jerry-. Oh, clean my boots ! ( Recoiling L.)
Myles. Come here, ye ijiot, and remember all dhrinks are
free to-day.
Jerry. ( Goes through conservatory to bar.) Give your
orders, gents. —the waiter’s in the room.
Myles. We’ll pledge Glendargle in his native gargle, the
mountain dew of Ireland. So bumpers all round.
Re-enter Yon Swop r.
(Jerry serves out drinks.)
Yon Swop. I’m on in this scene ?
Myles. Av coorse ye are! (To Jerry.) A bumper for
Misther You Swop. Here’s your health, Glendargle !
Omnes. Ay ! ay!
(Men bring round wine to Girls.)
Kath. But where’s my single young man lodger ? Where’s
Sailor Jack ?
Bridesmaids. ( With great alacrity.) Yes — yes—where’s
Jack ?
Jack. ( Entering r.c. and speaking from platform.) Here lie
is, girls, as large as life and twice as natural! ( All laugh as
they turn round to look at him. He comes down c.)
M.y dear eyes, Kitty, but you are A 1 at Lloyd’s—a
regular clipper—and I’d like to clip you !
Myles. (Coming down c. to l.) Divil doubt yez, ye bla’guard!
But where have ye been, at all, at all ? Faix, ye were nearly in
time to be too late.
Jack. Well, you see I was waitin’ for my Sunday-go-to-
Meetin’ togs, and they haven’t turned up yet.
Myles. Never mind the togs so long as you are here.
Jack. Myles, you thief o’ the world —you cut me out with
the only woman I ever adored.
Kath. G’long with your nonsense.
Jack. Nonsense! It’s gospel! and I’m that wild at being
chucked, I’ve half a mind, out of sheer spite, to marry someone
else—that is if I could get anyone to have me.


Kath. No fear o’ that. Here’s half a dozen ready
to jump at yez —if you’d only give ’em the ghost of a
chance.
.Tack. No ?
Kath. Yes !
Jack. Then here goes. Who’ll have a single young man
■with a soft heart and a hard head, sound wind and limb and
watohworks? By Jove, if I might only set up a Mormon
establishment I’d go for the whole blessed lot.
Girls. No !
Jack. Yes! But, as you see, unfortunately I can only
marry one —at a time —why then
Girls. Yes, then • {Eagerly.)
Jack. I must go and see if that darned tailor has turned
up. If he hasn’t I’ll tan his hide for him.
Girls. o—o—oh !
[Exit door r.
Myles. ( Going oner r. and calling out after Jack.) But I
say, Jack, where’s Ben ?
Jack. ( Without.) At the Golden Hole.
Kath. {With a scream.) At the Goolden Hole! But he
was to give me away ! (Going down c.)
Yon Swop. (Advancing l.) Nefare mind! I’ll gib you
away, Mistress Katty ! though, donner und blitzen, I’d rather
keep you for myself.
Myles, (r.c.) Divil doubt yez, ye owld sinner.
(Wedding Bells.)
D’ye hear thim bells P D’ye know what they’re sayiu’,
Katty?
Kath. (r.c.) Sorra a bit.
Myles. Divil a bit of sorrow, but a bucketful of joy.
They’s sayin’ “ Good-bye, Katty .Darliu’, ye’re goin’ out an
O’Mara, and ye’ll come in an O’Hooligan.” Take your places .'
Fall in, boys and girls, and divil takes the hindmost.
Mrsic—“ Paddy’s Wedding.”
[Exeunt Omnes r,u,e.
1. Yon Swop and Kath.
2. Glendargle and Bridesmaid.
Last of all, Myles and Two Bridesmaids.
Enter Yorkshire Dick l.c. He is in deep mourning.


Dick. ( Spoken on platform c.) Tlieer they go, and joy go
wi’ ’em! If ever a couple deserved happiness, it’s Myles and
Kitty! Happiness and me have parted company ever sin’—
ever sin’. It doan’t hear thinkin’ ahaat and yet ah can think
o’ nowt else. Ah think of it by day and dream of it by neet!
Ma poor lass! ma poor lass! ( Coming down he sees Jerry.)
Hello ! what’s tha up to theer ?
Jerry. ( With dignity.) Ahem! The Misses left me in
charge!
Dick. Left thee in charge ? What for ?
Jerry. Cos I saved Sailor Jack from the gallows and put
the Captain’s neck in the halter.
Dick. To keep thine own out. Ah! thoust nobbut a
wastrel! {Comes down b.c.)
Jerry. In course! In course I yam! What else can you
expect when a chap’s born in the gutter and never has a
chaunco to git out? {Comes down 1.c.) But look y’ere, Mr
Yorkshire. I’ve starved, lied, cadged, thieved for a livin’, but I
wish I may die if I ever lifted a hand crool ’gin a woman in
all my life ! I know I’m a bad lot, but I ain’t quite so bad as
that. (Dick gives his hand to Jerry.) When I twigged them
there bank notes in Court and noo ’ow he got ’em, and when I
see the white face and the great starin’ eyes of the sweet little
donah that he murdered, then I says to myself, says I—
“ Jerry, gawn! Chuck it off your chest, and give him his
gruel! ” And I did. I guv it ’im ’ot with a spoon as big as a
ladle. And now the rope’s ready, and Jack Ketch a-waitin’
to give the darned thief his last chuck.
Dick, (r.c.) Aye, aye. But wur they to hang him as high as
Haman—wur he to go straight down to hell —’twould never
bring ma poor wench back —no, never, never! {Breaks dovm
as he turns up stage r.)
Jerry. Don't take on so, laddie, don’t take on! Cheer
up and have a nip.
Dick. {lmpatiently.) Naa, uaa ! {Goes to door r.)
Jerry. Just a toothful.
Dick. Naa, naa, I tell ’ee. It doan’t agree wi’ me so early
in the momiu’.
J eery. Early or late, all’s one to this cheyld; so, if you
won’t I will. {Returns to counter.) {Drinks.) {Wedding
bells.) Hello! there’s the hawful ceremony a-takin’ place.
Ain’t you a-goin’ to have a look in duriu’ the performance?
Dick. What! me go to a weddin’! No, thank ’ee; a-buryiu’
’ud be more i’ ma way. Ma lass ! ma bonnie little lass !
[Exit door r.
Jerry. Poor Yorkshire! He’s got the collywobbles and got


’em bad. I don’t wonder at it. Suppose I lost my little Sully,
bless her dear eyes ! [Singing.)
“ Of all the gals that are so smart
There’s none like little Sally,
She is the darling of my heart,
And she lives in our alley.”
I’m a bit holf colour myself and I want a pick-me-up. ( Goes
tip to bar.) What’s this? EaaloldTom! [Drinks.) It's soothin'

Mac. Damnation, missed!
Jerky. Missed! Who’s missed? What’s missed? [Buns

Capting broken loose and on the rampage, running amuck
with a revolver. ( Another pistol shot. In a paroxysm of
terror.) Jumping Joseph ! what shall Ido ? Where shall

Capt. Free ! Free !

Fool ! He’d rouse the house ; bring ’em down on me like
a flight of hornets—then the rope - the gibbet! No, no, I
know a better game than that. Here, here !
[Leaps over the counter and exits .
Wall. ( Without, yells.) Yah! Whoo!
(Wall, bounds on over balcony c., with ras spear poised,
ready for action. He looks round the stage, peers through
doorway r. , shakes ms head, turning sees bar.)
Wall. Ah, dar ! [Bushes up, leaps over counter. As he
does so Jerry sneaks on jrom conservatory. He is more
grotesque than ever, and is paralysed tvith terror.)
Wall. Yah ! Whoo !


Jehry. No thank you. Not in these boots. (Makes
grotesque bolt through door 11.)
Wall. (Coming out of conservatory.) Gone ! gone 1
Mizzle like de mist. Dam ! dam ! big dam ! But Wallaroo
find him and settle all accounts wid dis ! wid dis ! (Rushes
up to platform.) Wallaroo on the warpath! Yah! whoo !
(Bounds off.)
Re-enter Capt. from conservatory.
Capt. The hue and cry is up ! No escape ! Yes, this !
{Producing revolver.) Five barrels ! All loaded ; the first
for you, Lionel Leigh, the last for me. For they shall never
take me alive. No, never ! Only let me find him, my
enemy. (Looks carefully through door u.) Not there. But
I can wait, yes, I can wait! (Going up c., looks off a.) Ah !
Who’s this 2 (Turning mind savagely with pistol, with a
shudder.) Her sister ! Not her ! No, no ! not her !

Music— Sybil’s —; pp.
Enter Sybil, Dick and Sailor Jack r.c. Sybil is in deep
mourning.
Jack, (r.c.) You can’t be serious, Dick 2
Dick (1.c.) Ah am tho’.
Jack. You don’t mean to say that you won’t come to the
-wedding breakfast 2
Dick. Sorrow’s a sore guest at a feast.
Sybil, (o.) Right, Richard, right! Our loss is too
recent and our grief too great. Besides, our sadness would
mar their joy.
Dick. True, lass, true ! For my part, ah hate t’ cursed
place ; and ah sail never rest till ah’m well out of it.
Sybil. Nor I either. (Xes to b. and up stage.)
Dick. Reet, lass, reet ! Twelve o’clock to-day is fixed
for completion of purchase of t’ mine ; we’ve only got to
cop t’ brass, sign t’ papers, and we’ll be off wi’ t’ bairn
to-morrow. (Going l.)
Jack, (c.) Going to take the kiddy-widdy with you 2
Dick. Aye, lad, for sure ! Barely an hour afore ah lost
my poor wench ah promised her that “My mother should
be her muther, and her child my child,” and ah’ll keep my
word.
(Exit l. door.
Jack. (Aside.) Poor Dick! (Going into r. corner, turns
cmd sees Sybil. Rather bitterly.) And so your going to
leave us, too, Duchess—going home? (r.c.)
Music —“ The Old House at Home." pp.


Sybil, (1.c.) lam there already. I see it. The garden
with its wealth of fruit and flowers, the antique dial stone,
the plashing fountain sparkling in the sun, while the weeny
red fish dart to and fro in the basin below. Before us
stands the old gabled grange, with the tall poplars peeping
over the roof ; high above our heads, from his eyrie on the
steep hill beside the castle keep, rises the old minster like
some grim Gothic giant mounting guard over the heart of
England—from the Trent to the Humber, from the centre
to the sea.
pp. Music ends.
Jack. ( Sarcastically .) A mighty pretty picture ! How do
you mean to get there?
Sybil. By rail to Albany, and thence by ship to England.
Jack. But that will cost money.
Sybil, (1.c.) I know. {Smiling.)
Jack, (b.c.) A month ago you told me you had neither
money nor friends.
Sybil. True ; but now I have both.
Jack. Both!
Sybil. Yes! Since I spoke to you, a sum of £5OOO has
been placed to my account at the bank, by a friend of my
mother’s.
Jack. Oh ! indeed. May I ask this friend’s name ?
Sybil. You may, but I can’t tell you.
Jack, (b.c.) Can’t tell me ! Why not ?
Sybil, (1.c., smiling.) Because I don’t know it myself.
Jack. Don’t know it !
Sybil. No. The people at the bank won’t tell me.
Jack. Doesn’t that strike you as being rather strange 1
Sybil. Well, yes, it does. I can only surmise that it
comes from Sir Philip Lascelles, my mother’s brother.
{Going down 1.h.)
Jack. {Significant l y, and getting excited.) Suppose,
instead of your mother’s brother, it came from somebody
else’s brother ?
Sybil, (l.) Somebody else’s brother —somebody else’s?
W T hat do you mean ? {Eagerly and getting excited.)
Jack. {Significantly.) I mean—that if you knew where
that money came from—perhaps—I only say perhaps—for
woman are kittle-cattle—you mightn’t be in such a deuce of
a hurry to get away after all.
{The remainder of this Scene very quick.)
Sybil. Mightn’t I ?
Jack. Or anyhow, perhaps you wouldn’t go alone !
Sybil. And why not, pray ?


Jack. Because I don’t think you’d have the heart to
leave him.
Sybil. Him ? Who ?
Jack. Never mind.
Sybil, (1.c.) But I do mind—of whom are you speaking?
Jack, (r.c.) Can’t you guess ?
Sybil. Guess?
Jack. Do you think there are two men in Westralia
who’d leave themselves penniless for your sake ?
Sybil. For my sake—mine ?
Jack. There, the cat’s out of the bag, so go home —(Xes
to r.u.e. in great excitement) — or go to Hong Kong, if you
like, but don’t expect his brother to say good luck go with
you, for you’ll leave bitter bad luck and a broken heart
behind. (Goes towards n. n.)
Sybil. Not so, not so! Where is he ?
Jack. On the way here.
Sybil. Here ? here ? When will he arrive ?
Jack. In half an hour.
Sybil. In half an hour ?
Jack. As sure as he’s alive. {At door r.c.)
Sybil. But why ? Why did he go away without a word,
and why has he remained silent for three long months ?
Jack. If you want to know the truth, ask him yourself.
[Exit door n.
Sybil. (Solus c.) I ought to have known it—known it
from the first—but he? He took a hasty woman at her word,
and left me—left without a sign, a look—and I—l thought
I had steeled my heart, and in my loneliness and desolation
I longed for home.
Music —“ Home , Sweet Home."
Ah, home will be no home without him. (Xes
to l.) Come back then—oh, come back, my love, and
let me take the sting out of my cruel words; come back, my
big, brave man ; come back, and take me to your heart!
[Exit l. door into co sermtory.

Myles, (l.) Away wid yez; out o’ that; you are too young.

{A roar of laughter.)
Kath. Manners, Myles, manners, the owld gentleman’s
right. Sure, it’s the proper thing to do. I’ve been married

Jerry, (r.) Of course she has, and knows all about it.
{Boar of laughter. )
Myles. And I’ll make you know all about the size o’ my
fut, ye blitherin’ idiot. {Xes to r., threatening Jerky, who-
holts up behind Girls , followed by Myles.)
Jerry. No you don’t.
Glen. Myles! (Myles, who is up 1.c., comes running
down 1.c.) Look out !
(Jack Kisses Kath.)
Jack. Don’t mind me, Myles ’ My office makes me her
father.
Myles, (1.c.) Then, begorra, it will be my office to make
you a grandfather. ( Pulls Jack away to l.) Now, Katty,
darlin’. {Going towards her.) {Restrained by Von Swop
and Others.)
Glen. No, no. the best man first, Myles. {Trying to kiss
Kath. )
Von Swop. Ya, ya, de best man !
Myles. Arrah, is it the parish pump I’m afther marryin’ ?
If you are best, sure I’m betther, my lord.
Glen. But I’m first, Myles, and first come, first served.
{Kisses Kath. Myles pulls him round l.)
Jerry. (r.c.) Pass it round, missis ; pass it round.
(Kath. gives him a clout.)
Kath. Certainly.
Jerry. Oh, I’m in this !
Myles. (Xes to Jerry.) Ye’d better be afther gettin’out of

Jerry. Out lam like a shot. (Bolts E.)
Myles, (1.c.) Now boys and girls, attention while I show

Myles. I prefer the Irish way.
Yon Swop. Ei vos. W e dos everything better in Shermany

Myles. Sure, if we tuk a dozen, you could spare ’em, ye
owld sinner !
(Bridesmaids giggle. Vox Swop fumes.)
Heads up for a royal salute—now boys, attintion!
Make sure of your mark—ready—present—fire.
(Bhidesmex hiss the Bridesmaids.)
Jerry, (r.c.) ’Ere—’ere—l’ve missed—let’s make a fresh
start.
Myles. I’ll give yez a fresh start, ye omadhaun !
Jerry. (Bolting.) No, thank you; I ain’t takin’ any just
Jack. Myles, leave that idiot alone and give us a song.
Myles. Sure I only know one.
Jack. What’s that?
Myles. Why
Jack. That's the very one we want.
Omnes. Aye, aye.
Myles. Here goes, then—but mind yez don’t lave me
alone in the chorus.
Song—Myles.
Myles, Now, foot it, boys and girls, and more power to
your heels and your elbows.
Irish Jig.
[At the height of the fun enter Yorkshire Dick e.c.)
Dick. (c. ) Time’s up. (Spoken from balcony.)
Omnes. Time’s up. (Everybody turning round.)
Dick. (e.c.) Aye, time’s up to complete purchase of “ The
Golden Hole.”
Glen, (1.c.) I’m ready—and the money is lying at the bank.
Enter Ben (e.c.) He is in his digger dress, weary and foot-
sore, and contrasts strangely and strongly with Beidal Geests.
He is followed by a group of Miners.
Ben. (c.) Let it lie there !
{A general movement —Everybody turns round to look of Ben.)
Note. From this moment the scene culminates to the end.


Glen, (l.) Bat I tell you I am prepared to carry out my
contract.
Ben. And I tell you I am not.
Omnes. Not ?
Glen. Why not 1
Ben. Because there is not an ounce of gold left in “ The
Golden Hole.”
(Various exclamations of amazement.)
Myles, (r.c.) The divil !
Jerky, (b.) Jerusalem !
Kath, (k.c. Aside, to Myles.) Whether “The Golden
Hole’s ” full or empty there’s a colleen beyant that’ll jump
at him if he hadn’t a shilling in the world.
Myles. Away wid ye then and bring her here, jewel.
Kath. That will I, in less than no time.
{Exit off platform l.c.
Dick. So then, Ben, “T’ Golden Hoel” has turned out a
dust hoel after all ?
Ben. Not exactly ; but it’s a mere chute that’s quite
cleaned out.
Jack, (l.) Then it’s all U P.
Ben. Not quite.
Omnes. Not quite 1
Ben. Not exactly. Listen !
I paid off my men to the last shilling and made
tracks for home. All at once night came down with a rush
—black night, so black that I couldn’t see an inch before
me. Crawling along, I stumbled over a snag, and down,
down I went, till I came to anchor with a crash that shook
the life out of me. I remembered nothing more till day-
break, when I awoke and found myself at the bottom of a
shaft twenty or thirty feet deep, with a head fit to split
and a skin full of aching bones. Beside me, almost within
touch of my hand, lay a mouldering skeleton, and clasped to
his bony breast, clutched in his bony fingers, I found this.
(Shows nugget.)
(General excitement.)
Jack. By Jove ! it’s splendid.
Yon Swop. Splendid ! It’s magnificent !
Myles. The most gorgeous stuff I ever saw in my life.
Dick. Ten to one it’ll run from five to five hundred
ounces to t’ ton.
Myles. Five hundred—five thousand.


Divines. No !
Ben. Yes! and what’s more! It comes from a true fissure
vein, where there are thousands and thousands of tons
waiting to be got out!
Omnes. You don’t say that ?
Ben. But I do, though.
Myles. Then, begorra, it’s worth all “The Goolden
Holes ” in the world !
Dick, (r.c.) Well, all we’ve got to do now is to find t’ brass
for t’ working capital.
Glen. How much ?
Dick. Say ten or twelve thaasand pound.
Jack 8 ' } Sure that’s a flea-bite ; we’ll find it ourselves.
Glen. }Of course we will.
Von Swop. J
Dick. Reet you are, lads ; say two thaasand a-piece and
t’ job’s done.
Jerry, (r.) Then I’m on the job ; who’ll lend me the oof ?
Don’t all speak at once.
■(Sybil rushes on l.c. followed by Kathleen. Sybil is
breathless with excitement. She remains on platform c.
overhearing conversation in foreground.)
Ben. Fair and softly, lads, fair and softly ; it’s all very
well for those who have £2OOO, but I haven’t 2000 pence!
Myles, (1.c.) The divil!
(General astonishment at Ben’s poverty.)
Dick. Then what hast done wi’ thy share o’ t’ brass, lad?
Ben. (c. brusquely.) That’s my business !
Dick. ( Emphatically.) Butsi’theehere, Ben; ah’se Yorkshire
up reet and down straight, and ah cannah understand what
thou’st done wi’ thy £5OOO.
Sybil. (Coming forward, r.c.) But I can !
(Ben starts to l.c. Omnes open out r. and l. in amazement.)
Omnes. The Duchess !
(From this moment, a rush at fever heat to the end.)
Sybil. He parted with it a month ago.
Dick (r, ) What! gambled it away ?
Sybil. No, gave it away.
Omnes. Gave it away ?
Sybil. Yes ! Gave it to an ungrateful, barbarous woman !
Ben. (l.c. Angrily to Jack.) Oh, Jack, Jack, you’ve
betrayed me
Jack (l.) Betrayed !


Ben. Silence, I tell you, silence !
Sybil (e.c.) The time for silence is past. Oh, how blind,
how base I have been not to have known there was but one
man in all the world who would make such a sacrifice
for my sake. But I know all now —know my own heart,
which has always loved you. Ah, dear, when I was hardest
upon you, I loved you best. Take your money back.
Ben. Take it back ?
Sybil. But take me with it.
Ben. Take you ?
Sybil. Yes, take me to that faithful heart, there let me
cling through life, and until death. {Advancing towards Ben.)
(Capt. leaps on balcony c., exclaiming —)
Capt. In death be it then. {Fires at Ben.)
Music. — Capt.

General consternation. ')
Ben. staggers hack to l. > Simultaneously.
Sybil starts k. with a scream. J
Wall, leaps tip c. and stabs Capt., who falls dead—
head at foot of step , feet on platform.
Wall. Wallaroo kill—kill—kill !
Sybil. (To Ben, without an instant’s pause.) But you,
dear, you ?
Ben. Safe— unhurt.
Sybil. (With a ravissement of joy.) Thank God ! Thank
God ! (Leaps into Ben’s arms o.)
