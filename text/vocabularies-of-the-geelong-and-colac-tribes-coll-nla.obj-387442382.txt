VOCABULARIES OF THE GEELONG AND COLAC
TRIBES, COLLECTED IN 1840.
By John J. Cary
{Read before the A ustralasian Association for the Advancement of Science,
Wednesday, January 12, 1898.)
The slight knowledge of the Australian language given to the
world has been mainly the work of Christian propagandists.
With his grammar of the Lake Macquarie dialect, published at
Sydney in 1827, L. E. Threlkeld may be said to have led the way.
Others, like Gunther, Teichelmann-Shurmann, Taplin, and Ridley,
have followed with copious vocabulary, phrase-book, or grammar;
while to-day the material for similar contributions to linguistic
science is no doubt still being gathered by zealous missionaries—
for example, the Jesuits in the Northern Territory, or the Bene-
dictines of New Norcia, near the capital of the Golden West;
and from the manuscript of an early missionary is drawn the
interesting peculiarity now under notice.
In 1838 the Wesleyan Methodists commenced an aboriginal
mission at Port Phillip; they established the Buntingdale Station
at the source of the Barwon, and tried, unsuccessfully, to reclaim
the Wod-dow-ro, Dantgurt, and Kolijon ti'ibes. One of the mis-
sionaries first sent from England to carry on the work was Francis
Tuckfield, a young Cornishman, brave and hopeful, who entered
on his new life with the zeal of an enthusiast. Naturally, chilling
experience somewhat lessened this ardour; but when State aid
was withdrawn, and private support grew lukewarm, and when
hope of success died within him, a strong sense of duty kept him
at his post, and not until the Government resumed possession of
the Buntingdale acres, and marked them out for public selection,
33665 (17)--A


did lie abandon the mission. Ten of the best years of his life
were spent trying to Christianise and civilise the above-mentioned
tribes.
Having an aptitude for language, he soon learned the native
dialects, but of his writings on the subject only a part remains.
A large vocabulary was compiled in the first years of the mission,
but it was unfortunately lost in a fire that destroyed the mission-
house. Tuckfield himself, forced to leap out of a window, narrowly
escaped with his life. His journal and copies of private letters
contain a few brief remarks on the aboriginal language; but in his
note-book is preserved a collection of about two hundred short
sentences, some translations of Scripture, and a vocabulary of
over two hundred words. By the kindness of the Tuckfield
family, it has been my privilege to inspect their father’s journal,
letters, and note-book ; and when perusing the latter I unearthed
a grammatical form of number hitherto practically unnoticed as
a peculiarity in Australian language. That dual number is a
feature of several Australian dialects is well known; but with the
Wod-dow-ro, number as a means of precision was amplified yet
another degree. And herein lies the discovery : these natives of
the Geelong district used triple number. Although “it is not
rare to find among uncivilised peoples a linguistic faculty superior
to that of their neighbours or of their civilised kindred,” yet
it is remarkable to find among these savages such an apparent
sign of mental activity. Triple number is not found in the
language of the Dravidians, who are regarded by some writers
as the progenitors of the Australian race. We may there-
fore conclude, admitting that we must look for “the ancestors
of the Australians in Hindostan,” that the Australian invented
triple number himself, or else he preserved a form of speech that
was lost centuries ago by his Indian congener. As to its use
in Australia, it is difficult to believe that it was spoken only
by the Wod-dow-ro, who in customs and daily life were typical
natives : death-dealing superstition stalked among them; poly-
gamy, infanticide, and cannibalism prevailed; tillage was un-
known ; and, furthermore, in the speech of the three tribes,
indications could be found pointing to original unity with the
dialects of remote tribesmen. Using Threlkeld’s and Teichel-
mann’s grammars, Francis Tuckfield compared the dialects spoken
in the vicinity of Buntingdale and others of Victoria with those
of Hew South Wales and South Australia; and this was his con-
clusion : “In construction and character they are radically and
gi-ammatically the same.” Referring to the language of the three
tribes, Tuckfield says: “It appears to me to be copious, very
significant, combining great power with simplicity, and for the
most part its sounds are pleasing to the ear. . . . Although it
has many pecularities, especially in the use and number of the

pronouns, some of these pecularities add to its precision and per-
spicuity. I will mention one or two as a specimen. ‘ You go ’
in English may signify one, two, three, or more. This language
furnishes a different word in the three senses without using the
numeral adjective.”
This wealth is shown by the following list, which is the best
illustration extant of the use of triple number

[Not strictly as classified by Tuckfield ; arranged as above for convenience.]
Not a few of these pronouns are cumbrous looking, but it seems
they were not always spoken thus. The native clipped his words,
and sentences* such as Ka-ar -dik —l talk; Willong-6w£-bon bore
When will you cease to run about (dual) ?—and Winyer kod
kol-ik-ka, —What are you talking about (triple)?—show thatinungis
* The sentences are from Tuckfield’s Note book, which also gives a few more examples of
triple number: Kel-ter-a-len tanong kollik—three talking ; Pe-del-wa-wa den—Strike us
three ; Pe-del-a gnel-en-tanong—Strike ns three ; Gnerd en bop mo gnul-en long gon" ga
hoy jo detable mur-un-nuk—The Great Spirit loves us(i hree) who have a crying heart —J J C


the three numbers lie was able to speak with brevity as well as pre-
cision. The syllabification of the first sentence is according to Tuck-
field’s entry; ik is a contraction of hangik, and the presence of din
the last syllable may be accepted as an example of the fusion of
words by the natives, comme le Franqais faire la liaison.
The use of ka-ard in the first and kod in the third sentence no
doubt indicates the inflection of verbs for number. That the
above forms of number once existed in widely separated districts
of Australia seems indeed highly probable. A strong affinity is
found in the singular dual and particular duals of eastern dialects,
and in this connection one may mention the use of pronouns in
common by such tribes : thus winyer , what, of the Geelong district,
is winyar at Lake Hindmarsh (Vic.), minya at the Brisbane River
(Queensland), and minya on the Liverpool Plains (N.S.W.) ;
hangik, I, becomes bangeek, hangak, hangak, hangak in four
dialects* of north-west Victoria, and hang in the Lake Macquarie
district (N.S.W.) ; but it may be safe to affirm that, like the
Geelong and Colac natives, one south-eastern tribe retained the
third number. What certainly seems to be an example — naiowiny,
we three—is found in the language of the Twofold Bay faboriginies.
Was triple number once commonly spoken by the Australians'?
Is it a relic of their ancient progenitors, or must we seek its origin
on this continent ? These questions may now be left to conjecture,
and in the absence of aboriginal literature or writing, perhaps it
may not be too bold to say that it is doubtful if conclusive answers
to them will be found even in the comparative study of the
Australian family of languages—a field of research still awaiting
the scientific investigator.
My thanks are due to the Professor of Philology of the
Melbourne University for kindly considering the foregoing, and
who writes as follows
“ I have carefully considered your paper ; but as I am not
personally acquainted with the Australian tongues, I do not feel
any right to express an opinion upon the special functions
illustrated therein.
“ The pity is that more example is not supplied, and that some
authority beyond Tuckfield’s is not forthcoming. Even if we
assume that the triple number is really expressed, there remain
the questions—(l) Whether the elements expressing that notion
are really affixed or merely juxtaposed ? (2) Whether the said
elements have any independent existence as words in any sense
whatever ?
* Eyre’s Journals of Discovery, vol. ii, p. 401.
f Rev. W. Ridley’s Languages of the Aborigines of Australia, p. 115 : (Sydney, 1875 )
I Naiadha. I and thou, Naiawung.
Thou, Indiga. We three, Naiowing.


“ It is noticeable, for example, that in all the triple persons the
attached elements, kollik, appear ; while in the singular and dual
there is no such agreement of ending. Is there any way of dis-
covering an independent kol (lik) in an appreciable sense of its
own ? Or is it always and only pronominal 1
“ If in English we say ‘ We do,’ ‘ We-two-do,’ ‘ We-three do,’ the
step to agglutination is but a small one. Did the Australian
simply do the same and stop at ‘ three,’ because it had no further
numerals ?
“ Thus you give the dual as containing bid; but hul is the
ordinary Australian for two, or at least is contained in the word
for two.
“ Similarly I find that kuliba and guliba are Australian for
three, and I should say that kol (lik) is an appearance of three in
your compounds.”
As regards answering Professor Tucker’s question —Whether
the elements expressing triple number are really affixed or merely
juxtaposed ?—Tuckfield’s MS. furnishes no helpful assistance.
The answer must, therefore, be drawn from the pronouns them-
selves. But if we inspect the six examples of triple pronouns,
we will find that the said elements appear to be infixes, placed
between the two syllables of the word bangik. For example,
insert etuk koll between the two parts of the word, and we have
bang-etuk-kol-lik—we; prefix ong to etuk-koll, and by the same
process we get bang-ong-etuk-koll-ik —ours. Interposing ud koll
gives bang-ud-kollik—you ; prefixing ong to ud-koll makes bang-
ong-ud kol-lik—yours. Incorporating tan-a-koll forms bang-tan-
a-kol-lik—they ; and prefixing a to tan-a-koll gives bang a tan a
kol lik—theirs.
As a similar formation also occurs in five examples of the
possessive cases, singular and dual, and also in the plural, it seems
quite safe to conclude that in the pronouns of triple number “ the
elements expressing that notion ” are neither affixed nor juxta-
posed, but incorporated.*
Passing to the second question, we may reasonably confine our
attention to kol. The same combination of letters forms the first
syllable in the names of seven birds—koling-ar, parrot; kol-ka-
wil, predatory bird, &c.; but Tuckfield furnishes no Wod-dow-ro,
Dantgurt, or Kolijon word showing kol used as a numeral. As a
matter of fact, it could not occur in Wod-dow-ro, Dantgurt, or
Kolijon as the root syllable of three—none of these dialects had
such a numeral ; in each, three was expressed by two and one.
* “ Words are formed by means of suffixes alone, the formative element being- placed
always at the end of the Word.”—Abel Hovelacque, Science of Language ; Australian
Languages, p. 68.


Thus finding triple form expressed by a word not known to the
speakers as a numeral, does not its presence indicate what may be
termed the survival of a grammatical form of precision ?
The supposition regarding triple pronouns as the conjoining of
the numerical syllable to roots expressive of pronominal relation-
ship seems to be thus fairly set aside. But turn to the dual form,
and what do we find 1 Here we clearly see that, in the three
dialects, bul, u is contained in the word for two.”* In Wod-
dow-ro, bulad, two, is traceable in Buk-ar-bul-ok—the residence of
the late Captain Fyans—signifying between two waters ; and in
dajorongbullok, the eldest of two sisters. This second example,
which seems quite akin to the dual pronoun bangbullok , is found
among names of family relationship, recorded by Tuckfield ; and
the following derivation of both examples is drawn by me from
his MS. Bukarballok-6o&arm, middle ; bulad, two ; yallok,
water; dajorongbullok-cfo/oro??#, implying priority of birth ; bulad,
two ; worok, denoting female.
Now, although the termination ok in the dual pronouns remains
unexplained, it must be admitted that the element bid in those
compounds, in bukarfrwdok, dajorongfot/ok and bulad may with
good reason be considered as the same identical root syllable.
But granting that, may we not reasonably ask what evidence
is there showing bul to be a veritable numeral ? May it not first
have been applied to some right, act, or powers of two individuals,
and then by a natural transition of meaning, like our couple or
brace, have acquired an exact numerical significance 1
Benjeroo, two, is shown by Bunce to also mean couple, brace,
and two wives.
It seems, indeed, as feasible to suppose that the dual form
supplied the AV od-dow-ro with the numeral adjective, as to
suppose that they allowed the word for three to drop out of use
as a numeral, and yet retained its root syllable in pronominal
usage. If the word fell into disuse on the death of a native in
whose name it occurred, it would have wholly disappeared! ;
a personal application of such a term would be the least likely to
survive. J

AUSTRALIAN LANGUAGE: WOD-DOW-RO,
DANTGURT, AND KOLIJON.
The dialects spoken by the Aborigines of the Geelong and Colac
districts. From the MSS. of Francis Tuckfiekl, Collated by
John J. Cary.
Wod-dow-ro, Dangurt, and Kolijon words not included in this collection
are found in—
R. Brough Smythe’s “ Aborigines of Victoria,” vol. ii.
John Hilder Wedge’s “ Note Book ” ; Bonwick’s “ Port Phillip Settle-
ment,” p. 247
G, T. Lloyd’s “ Thirty-three Years in Tasmania, and Victoria,” p. 470.
E. J. Eyre’s “Journals of Discovery,” vol. ii, p. 400-2.
The Witouro list of words found herein, and incorporated also in “The
Aborigines of Victoria,” was very probably obtained originally by Edward
Stone Parker, Assistant Protector of Port Phillip Aborigines, who refers to
Witouro as one of eight dialects used in his district. “ Papers Relating to
the Aboriginies” printed by order of the House of Commons, 1841.
Samuel Mossman, whose short listof Wod-dow-ro words forms an appendix
to this paper, was an early resident of Port Phillip, coming to Geelong in
1841, He has preserved a few crumbs of information concerning these
times in a small brochure or two, besides leaving some MS. notes.


PREFATORY NOTE.
Wod-dow-ro,Dantgurt, or Kolijon denotes both the language
and the tribe.
The meaning of Wod-do has not been ascertained, but wro (lips)
figuratively means speech or language; and as East Australians
frequently named themselves after their language, most probably
so did the aborigines, who naturally spoke Wod-dow.
But Dantgurt-kuddet and Kolijon-gnundet seem to be the
completed forms of the second and third name, the suffixed word
in each instance signifying either tribe or language.
Wod-dow-ro is F. Tuckfield’s form of the word, as obtained from
the aborigines who once occupied the Geelong district. Watorrong,
Witowurong, Witowro, Witouro and Woddowrong are variants.
11 itouro is given as the dialect of the aborigines of the Ballarat
district who roamed in the vicinity of Buninyong and Bake
Buiiumbeet. Comparing it with the Wod-dow-ro now available,
shows, howe\ er, that the Geelong and Ballarat aborigines spoke
the one language, and, no doubt, they were but different sections
of the same tribe.
The W od-dow-ro was a good type of the Australian coast
dwellers, but we can only conjecture as to whether the tribe was
numerous or not. The Geelong sections—Corio and Barabil -
are variously estimated by early settlers as consisting of 170
or 300 souls.
The hunting ground of the Wod-dow-ro was extensive, well
watered, and, from all accounts, generally furnished an abundance
of game. Broadly speaking, it included the whole of the present
county of Grant and part of Grenville on the north.
. The Kolijon is spoken of as a small tribe roaming in the
vicinity of Lakes Colac and Corangamite.
The Dantgurt was only a section of a tribe named Manmait
whose hunting ground touched the western boundary of the
Kolijon. With the advent of the whites, the sectional name
seems to have supplanted the tribal.
LETTERS.
Nineteen letters are used in writing these dialects—a, b, d, e,
g, h, i, j, k, 1, m, n, o, p, r, t, u, w, y. The natives were unable
to pronounce f, c, h, s, x, and z. Many of them could not distin-
guish between the labials b and p, nor the palatals d and t.
Obs. Tuckfield uses Ji in the aboriginal in one or two instances
only. He says but sixteen letters were necessary to form an
aboriginal alphabet.

SOUNDS.
A set of marked vowels, by Tuckfield, shows a with one long
and one short sound, as in far and fat* ; e, as in me and end ; i,
as in bit; and o, as in no, not, and move ; u, as in bull, and as in
tub ; tar, gnan ; pedong, dilbel; kar-i-gnal; bo, kol, Idk ; bit ad,
kumbe.
The sounds of the dialects were, for the most part, pleasing to
the ear.
A nasal sound, common to the Australian, is represented by
the letters gn. It is produced by placing the organs of speech in
the position required to pronounce g hard. The sound is then
emitted through the nose, like the letter n. This sound gave the
Europeans much trouble.
Gn changes to k in neighbouring dialects, and the initial cor-
responds with k in different sections of the same tribe : —Gnenong
(Wod.), kenong (Kol.), foot; gnurdong (Wod.), knardon (Wit.),
mother ; gnarn (Kol.), karl (Dant.), dog ; gnundet (Kol.), kuddet
(Dant.), tribe or language; gnun-ye, kuren-ye, small.

PARTS OF SPEECH.
The words of the Wod-dow-ro, Dantgurt, and Kolijon dialects
may be classed as nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs,
conjunctions, and interjections.
A few remarks of interest will here be made concerning the
noun and pronoun.
THE NOUN.
The common noun is either—(l) Simple—as bon, knee; da,
earth; la, stone; (2) collective—as kin-kin-bil (Wod.), mar
(Dant.), mandel (Kol.), people ; nan ok nanworen, fur tribe; or (3)
abstract—as deraba, shame ; konda, sorrow ; morom, a spirit.
Examples of nouns of the second and third class are few.


GENDER.
Inflection. —As regards gender, F. Tuckfield shows that ivorik is
a feminine suffix : Kurenyemenoon'&, “ She-with-the-small-eyes.”
Worok, gorok , and goruk are variants of the word. No mention
is made of a masculine suffix ; and the feminine can be traced in
the names of persons only.
From the Subjoined table it will be seen that gender in nouns
was more commonly expressed by different words :
Wod-chio-ro.
Masculine.
Amerjig. White man
Kuly. Man.
Pedong. Father
Wordong. Brother
Feminine.
Amerjigorok. White woman
Bagoruk. Woman
Gnurdong. Mother
Bermborok. Sister
Wagnakik. My younger brother Bermboragik. My younger sister
Dedeik. My youngest brother Dajerik. My eldest sister
Dajorongbullok. Eldest sister of
Mommomik. My son
Tanddopek. My uncle
Wong-gongik. My daughter
Male koragik. My aunt.
Dantgurf.
Amerdeit. White man
Amerdeitair. White woman
Tamtambora. Woman
Gner-rong-gi. Mother
Ko-ker. Sister
Be-bi. Father
Wordi. Brother
Ko-ko-gnun. My younger brother • Towelja. Aunt

Ma-ma. Father
Derda. Brother
Ba-ba. Mother
Banget. Sister
Koromboit. My younger brother
Ka-gnet. My uncle
Malankaugnek. My aunt
Dattonget. My eldest sister
It may be noted that wererup a common term for the
“ sorcerer ” of a tribe, can have no feminine, women never filling
that office.
Lapmolong, widower, and pondak , widow, no doubt belong to
one of the thi-ee dialects ; but Mr, Tuckfield has merely listed
them in his general vocabulary.
NUMBER.
He gives only one example of the change of a noun singular to
plural, viz., mir, eye ; mera, eyes. 1
* See example of parsing.
11
VOCABULARIES OF THE GEELONG AND COLAC TRIBES.


CASE.
The vowels a , iu, and u, when suffixed to nouns, appear to
serve as case endings. For example, murna, hand ; murnaa, in
(the) hand; weing, fire; weingm, to (the) fire; Sundays, of
Sunday.*
DERIVATION OF NOUNS.
A few examples of derivative and compound nouns that have
been traced by the aid of F. Tuckfield’s vocabulary give an
interesting glimpse of aboriginal word-formation.
. Derivatives appear to be formed by the aid of the suffix abil or
bil, which signifies one of, or pertaining to ; thus—
Tarekabil, signifies an erect person—one straight as a spear—tare, a spear •
k perhaps euphonic ; and abil pertaining to. (VVod-dow-ro.)
Taregil is the Kolijon form of the word.
Yanabil, a visitor, may perhaps be closely rendered as one of the comers
or one of the goers—yan expressing motion to a place, as in yan-
gal-e-nut, to walk ; yan-garamela, to come back ; and yanik, I go.
Nanworabil denotes a bear, opossum, or any furred animal; while
Karignalabil, Creator ; gnariwel, an adult;
Kin-kin-bil, people ; and
Nilarngwarabil, the finny tribe, are also examples.
Abil was thus attached to a simple noun or verb, or to a compound word.
Gunong, or a contraction of it, seems to aid as a suffix in forming
Pedong, father
Wardong, brother
Gnurdong, mother
Lapmolong, widower
Myungunong, liar
Dilokongong, fighter
Bilmgonong, thief.
Compound nouns consist of—(1) A noun by a noun, as
Koron gwrong, hog-face; Mulgamom, (2) A noun
preceded by an adjective, as Nerim genong, long foot, Newlem -hoit,
bad heart. (3) A noun preceded by a verb, as Pon emelana, bite-
rat—i.e., “an eater of rats.”
. These and similar compounds were the nicknames of indi-
viduals, it being customary for the aborigines to name their
children after some particular circumstance occurring at the time
of birth, or after the food they eat, or a personal peculiarity.
To the names of the females the sign of the feminine gender
was also tacked on—Korinemurnongorok, korine, bitter; murnono-
an edible plant; gorok, female.
12
SECTION F.


This name was given to her as she was horn in a place where,
and at a season of the year when, the murnong was bitter.
In all such compounds listed, the qualifying word is invariably
placed first.
Compounds also consist of an agglomeration of several words
having syllable elided, as—
Dajorongbullok, “the eldest of two sisters dajorong, implying priority
of birth; bul, a contraction of bulad, two ; and ok, a contraction of
worok, female.
Bukarbullok, is also formed of at least three abridged words, two having
the end, and one the beginning cut off; bukariu, middle ; bulad, two ;
and yallok, water. Bukarbullok, “ Between two waters,” designates
a corner of Marnock Vale, Geelong,* around which the Barwon sweeps
in a horseshoe curve.
Tarigemiretuk, eyelash—spears or reeds of the eye—conies by a similar
agglutinating process—tare, spear or tark reed ; i (?) ; ge, of the ;
mirgnetuk, eye.f
Compounds with complete words juxtaposed, as Korong-
wrong, &c., are no doubt more newly coined than those with
elisions, the latter class having their edges, so to speak, rubbed
off after long usage ; and no doubt the components of many of
these will never be traced.
PRONOUNS.
Pronouns may be classified as personal and interrogative.
“ Personal pronouns that stand alone, or that are used in answer
to an interrogative of personal agency, are different from those
that are used in connection with verbs, or in answer to a question
of the act, e.g., in answer to the question of personal agency,
“Who speaks?” (Wela karing?) the answer would be, “Karing
bangik,” (Speak I.) In answer to a question of the act, “ What
are you doing ?” the answer would be “ Kudgellengik,” (Eating I.)
In this sentence ik seems to be a contraction of the personal
pronoun, hangik; but in other interrogatives, we have other
pronouns depending, it would seem, on the consonant with which
the verb terminates. Hence it seems to us at present that there
is an endless variety of pronouns in the language.
♦Similar contractions are found in the names of places in the Colac district. Lake
Corangamite—Bitter water ; korine, bitter ; gnuhet, water. Lake Burrumbete—Round
water; burum, round (?) ; gnuhet, water. Wurdibulok—wurdi, large (?); bulad, two ;
yallok, water.
f Ge in this example, in the Wod-dow-ro, Murgebulok, the brightness (?) of two waters—a
spot at the junction of the rivers Leigh and Barwon—and in Tarntarnu/elok, the good
snaring water, may be a contraction of gewa, there. Some of the words given as deriva-
tives are probably compounds.

SECTION F.


Won is also given as the pronoun I. Gnar won gneal-gnen,
“I believe your words”; Wodjol-a won, “Anger is gone from
me.” (Gnen, (W.) nuk, (K.) won, (D.) me 1)
Two forms are given in the first person plural. Bangwodjok,
we, denotes part of a number of individuals present when that
part exceeds three; Bangetuk, includes all present.
An, you, sing. nom. appears in the example of parsing.
Gn6n, you (acc.), your, occurs in the singular.
INTERROGATIVE PRONOUNS.
Wela, who ; weka, whose; winyar, what ; winger, what.
DERIVATION OF PERSONAL PRONOUNS.
The components of these compounds have yet to be clearly
traced. In composition they are perhaps akin to the nouns
formed by elision. The dual and trinal forms most probably
incorporate the numeral, hul, in the dual, being a contraction of
bulad, two, and kol, in the trinal, a contraction of three
(kuliba, guliba).
But this opposes the statement of Francis Tuckfield, who says
the natives were able to express themselves in these forms without
using the numeral adjective. This statement, we may reasonably
suppose, rests on direct information given to him by the natives;
but then we may infer that the blacks themselves had long for-
gotten the original complex nature of the compounds, for there
remains this striking fact : the Geelong tribesmen, who used
trinal pronouns, were found with no numeral for three. They
expressed three by addition, bulad-barp-koimoil, two and one.*
Interjection. —Wah-wah. Unclassified xvord. —Koon-g-a-g-e. It
is a parting word used by the natives. “It may be a good wish,
or an exclamation expressing regret at leaving; but what it
means,” says Tuckfield, “ the blacks could not tell.” Emphasis is
sometimes marked by reduplicating a word, or adding a syllable—
