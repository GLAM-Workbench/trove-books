Our Father’s Home Eternal” (E.H. 252).
Words ascribed to S. Thomas a Kempis.
Music (E.H. 581) C. J. Webb (1803-1887)
Our Father’s home eternal,
0 Christ, thou dost prepare
With many divers mansions,
And each one passing fair;
They arc the victors’ guerdon,
Who, through the hard-won tight,
Have followed in thy footsteps,
And reign with thee in light.
Amidst the happy number
The Virgins’ crown and queen,
The over-virgin Mother
Is first and foremost seen;
The Patriarchs in their triumph
Thy praises nobly sing,
The Prophets of thy wisdom
Adore the nations’ King.
The Apostles reign in glory,
The Martyrs joy in thee;
The Virgins and Confessors
Thy shining brightness see;
And every patient sufferer,
Who sorrow dared contemn,
For each especial anguish
Hath one especial gem.
The holy men and women,
Their earthly struggle o’er,
With joy put off the armour
That they shall need no more;
For these, and all that battled
Beneath their Monarch’s eyes,
The harder was the conflict
The brighter is the prize.
And every faithful servant,
Made perfect in thy grace,
Hath each his fitting station
’Mid those that see thy face;
The bondsman and the noble,
The peasant and the king,
All gird one glorious Monarch
In one eternal ring.


Act of Remembrance.
The congregation still standing, the Yice-Dean from the chancel step
shall say:
Brethren, we are keeping this day in holy and happy remem-
brance of the beginning of our Australian Church. We
remember with thankfulness to Almighty God the faith and
foresight of William Grant Broughton, its first bishop, his
pioneering journeys, more particularly in the southern portions
of his huge diocese which now form this Diocese of Goulburn.
We think of his faithful pastorate and of the beginnings of our
church life under his care and guidance. The forty-two
parishes represented here to-day are the lineal descendants of
the ten which he established, Goulburn, Collector, Yass, Quean-
beyan, Canberra, Bungonia, Monaro, Braidwood, Tumut and
A 1 bury.
Neither do we forget pioneers of our land and our faith, priests
and lay people who shared with him his labours and
difficulties.
We recognise the good hand of God in the growth of this
country, in the expansion of our Church and the development
of this diocese, in the witness of that Church through one
hundred years to the evangelical faith and the Catholic order
of the Church of England, in the part it has played in our
national life, in days of distress and of rejoicing, in war and
in peace. On this day we remember the consecration of Bishop
Broughton, his life and work, and for all these mercies of divine
providence we desire to give God the glory and our humble
thanksgiving. Let us pray.
Commemoration of Pioneers Departed,
V. 1 must work the works of Him that sent me while it is day:
R. The night comcth when no man can work.
To he said altogether:
Grant, 0 Lord, that we may all use this time of work while it is
called to-day, Remembering gladly and thankfully those who
have gone before, Who have stood by us and helped us in past
days, Who have cheered us by their sympathy, and
strengthened us by their example; That, when the
time of our departure hence shall come, we may have a good
hope of rest with them in Paradise, and look forward with them
to a glorious resurrection to eternal life, In that day of perfect
fullness and liberty which Thou hast promised to Thy children;
through Jesus Christ, in Whose life we live. Amen.

Hymn: “Pioneers.”
Words: Walt Whitman (1819-1892).
Music: Martin Shaw.
All the past we leave behind:
We lake up the task eternal, and the burden, and the lesson,
Conquering, holding, daring, venturing, so we go the unknown
ways,
Pioneers! 0 Pioneers!
Not for delectations sweet,
Not for riches safe and palling, not for us the tame enjoyment;
Never must you he divided, in our ranks you move united,
Pioneers! 0 Pioneers!
All the pulses of the world,
All the joyous, all the sorrowing, these are of us, they are with
us;
We to-day’s procession heading, we the route for travel
clearing,
Pioneers! 0 Pioneers!


On and on the compact ranks,
With accessions ever waiting, we must never yield or falter,
Through the battle, through defeat, moving yet and never
stopping,
Pioneers! 0 Pioneers!

Intercession.
Let us Pray.
God of our fathers, to whose providence we owe the goodly
heritage of our faith and church, with all their sacred memories
and traditions, we praise thee for all the treasures of truth and
love, for all the fruits of faith and work, bequeathed to us
through servants who laboured here for thee in the days that
are past: and we beseech thee so to renew in us thy Holy
Spirit, that we may steadfastly seek thy will for us and our
children and both in life and worship show forth thy love and
magnify thy name, through Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen.
0 Eternal Lord God, Father, Friend and Comrade of us all,
remember in thy love those of our kindred and race who have
gone before and opened up this fail' land for us their children.
Give us, we pray Thee, grace and wisdom to carry on the work.
Make us a faithful and loyal people living at peace with all the
peoples of the earth. Guard this land we pray Thee from war
and teach us how to serve the world, through Jesus Christ our
Lord. Amcu -
Hymn: “0 Faith of England, Taught of Old” (E.H. 544).
Words: Canon T. A. Lacey.
Music: M. Grenter, c. 1525.
0 Faith of England, taught of old
P>y faithful shepherds of the fold,
The hallowing of our nation;
Thou wast through many a wealthy year,
Through many a darkened day of fear,
The rock of our salvation.
Arise, arise, good Christian men, _
Your glorious standard raise again,
The Cross op Christ who calls you;
Who bids you live and bids you die
For his great cause, and stands on high
To witness what befalls you.


Our fathers heard the trumpet call
Through lowly cot and kingly hall
From overseas resounding;
They bowed their stubborn wills to learn
The truths that live, the thoughts that burn,
With new resolve, abounding.
Arise, arise, good Christian men,
Your glorious standard raise again,
The Cross of Christ who guides you;
Whose arm is bared to join the fray,
Who marshalls you in stern array,
Fearless, whate’er betides you.
Our fathers held the faith received,
By saints declared, by saints believed,
By saints in death defended;
Through pain of treason and distress,
They for the rigid contended.
Arise, arise, good Christian men,
Your glorious standard raise again,
The Cross of Christ who bought you;
Who leads you forth in this new age
With long-enduring hearts to wage
The warfare he has taught you.
Though frequent be the loud alarms,
Though still we march by ambushed arms
Of death and hell surrounded,
With Christ for Chief we fear no foe,
Nor force nor craft can overthrow
The Church that he has founded.
Arise, arise, good Christian men,
Your glorious standard raise again,
The Cross wherewith he signed you;
The King himself shall lead you on,
Shall watch you till the strife be done,
Then near his throne shall find you.
Address,
Most Reverend the Archbishop of Sydney.
Hymn: “God is working His purpose out’’ (E.H. 548).
Words: A. C. Ainger.
Music: M. D. Kingham.
God is working Ilis purpose out as year succeeds to year,
God is working His purpose out and the time is drawing near;
Nearer and nearer draws the time, the time that shall surely be,
When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God as the
waters cover the sea.


From utmost oast to utmost west whore’or man’s foot hath trod,
By the mouth of many messengers goes forth the voice of God,
‘Give oar to mo, ye continents, yo isles, give oar to me,
That the earth may he filled with the glory of God as the water’s
cover the sea.’
What can wo do to work God’s work, to prosper and increase
The brotherhood of all mankind, the reign of the Prince of
peace?
What can we do to hasten the time, the time that shall surely be,
When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God as the
waters cover the sea?
March we forth in the strength of God with the banner of
Christ unfurled,
That the light of the glorious Gospel of truth may shine
throughout the world;
Fight we the fight with sorrow and sin, to set their captives
free,
That the earth may be filled with the glory of God as the waters
cover the sea.
All we can do is nothing worth unless God blesses the deed;
Vainly we hope for the harvest-tide till God gives life to the
seed;
Yet nearer and nearer draws the time, the time that shall surely
be,
When the earth shall be filled with the glory of God as the
waters cover the sea.
During the singing of this hymn a collection will he made for the expen-
ses of this commemoration.
The choir will then sing:
The Contakion of the Departed (E.II. 744).
Kieff Melody.
Give rest, 0 Christ, to thy servant with thy Saints: where
sorrow and pain are no more; neither sighing, but life ever-
lasting. Thou only art immortal, the Creator and Maker of
man: and we are mortal, formed of the earth, and unto earth
shall we return: for so thou didst ordain, when thou createdst
me, saying, Dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.
All we go down to the dust; and, weeping o’er the grave, we
make our song: allelnya, allclnya, allelnya. Give rest, C) Christ,
to thy servant with thy saints: where sorrow and pain are no
more; neither sighing, but life everlasting.
