THE SHIP I
?J. ?* \
built at Maulmain (now Moulmein), a rice settlement in
CLiyt British India, near the coast, and is constructed of solid teak,
a wood peculiar to that place. On looking at the top of the
main mast, it will be noticed that a slight indent was made during the
mutiny of the crew, who were Indians, at the time of the Indian
mutiny, the shot being fired from Fort William, in Calcutta. It is
the intention of the proprietors to exhibit her at London, and after-
wards in America. She was built as a first-class passenger ship, and
traded for nearly half-a-century as an East India trader, and has con-
veyed many thousands of passengers to and from England and the
Indies. Her first trip to Australia was made in the year 1849, when
she arrived with a full complement of emigrants. Returned again to
England, and made a second visit with another lot of emigrants in
the year 1851, when her crew deserted and went to the goldfields of
Victoria. Being left totally unmanned, she was sold at Port Phillip
to the Victorian Government, who speedily converted her into a prison
ship of remarkable strength. She is the only remaining convict ship
of Victoria, the other four, viz., the ?President,? ?Lysander,?
? Sacramento,? and ? Deborah ? being sold and broken up, this being
the restriction placed upon them, but the ? Success ? was sold with-
out that restriction, hence her being on exhibition to-day.
UPPER DECK-BOW.
1. The Compulsory Bath. ?The compulsory bath or ?Coffin?
was used for refractory prisoners who were unwilling to conform, to
the regulations of the ship with respect to their ? toilet.? They were
placed therein, and sea water was pumped on three or four at a time
from the ocean, besides being scrubbed by the warders from the top
with the aid of a long-handled brush. This was a practice invariably
performed each morning, as there were always some of the prisoners
to be washed by force, to say nothing of the fun experienced by the
warders, who really enjoyed the ? coffin soaking ? of the prisoners.

as a convict ship.

)ehmd the figure-head will be noticed the sentry-boxes, where two
warders or police were constantly stationed for four hours duty nmht
and day, in order to watch the gang ashore, and also to keep away from
the ?sacred or holy ground? any intruder within the prescribed limit.
? i , s \, Tl l e Wheel.? This wheel was used for two purposes;?
firstly, the lowering below to the prisoners their food morning, noon, and
evening ; but also for bringing on the top deck, in a cage, for exercise
such prisoners as were in solitary confinement, and who were unable to
get to the top unless raised by the wheel, as their irons were of such a
weight as not to allow of their being able to walk with the addition of
the punishment ball, which alone weighs 72 lbs., and the chain
attached 8 lbs., total 80 lbs.
6. The Hatchway.? With the exception of the iron stanchions
surrounding it, is truly original.
i? 1' ?*" h i e ? Tllis is the original mast of the ship
which was built in British India, in the year 1790, at Mauhnain, a rice
settlement near the coast. Like the whole of the ship it is decidedly
good. 11, on looking up this mast, near the band at the top will be
noticed a slight indent. This was caused by a cannon ball striking it
at Calcutta during a mutiny which arose there.
, . Old Pump. The original and only pump used in the
ship. Previous to her departure from Melbourne the ship had not
been pumped for the space of six months.

Poe wrote his poem ? The Bells,? he might have added to the list The
Inson Bell, and truthfully might have said?? What a world of
melancholy its melody foretells.?

board side was the superintendent?s room, whilst those abaft and on
the port side were for the accommodation of the warders.

gallery, and is as it was built in 1790. The port quarter gallery was
used by the officers for accommodation purposes.

MIDDLE DECK.
BOW.
HENRY POWER?Otherwise ? Harry ? Power, alias Johnson,
was a bushranger, audacious and daring. He was a native of Water- .
ford, Ireland, and arrived in Victoria in 1848. In March, 1855; two
troopers met him at Daisy Hill, near Maryborough, and calling on
him to halt, accused him of stealing the fine black horse on which he
rode, and (the colour of the horse corresponding) they insisted that he
must be the outlaw for whom they were searching, viz., Captain
Melville, and attempted to arrest him. Power?s explanations being
disregarded, and his offers to produce receipts refused, he made a
determined resistance. Revolvers were drawn by the police, shots
were exchanged, a trooper fell wounded and Power escaped. A week
after he was secured and sentenced to 14 years? imprisonment for
horse stealing and shooting with intent. While on the ? Success? he
was most daring and desperate. He was conspicuous as being impli-
cated in the Stevens and Melville rush, and when on his trial escaped
the gallows by a legal quibble. Being again returned to the
? Success,? he suffered two years and half of its cruel discipline.
Shortly after he w r as removed to Pentridge, from whence he escaped
unnoticed (though within gunshot of armed sentries) on 16th February,
1869 On May 7, 1869, he robbed the mail coach near Porepunkah, in
the Ovens district and afterwards, single-handed, held up the Buckland
coach within five miles of Beechworth. In August, 1869, �5OO
reward was offered by the Victorian Government for his arrest. He
was captured by Superintendents Nicholson and Hare and Sergeant
Montford while asleep in a gunyah built in a cave in a mountainous
part of the Glenmore run, at the head of the King River, Victoria, on
Sunday, June sth, 1870, the rain descending in torrents the while.
By his side was a six-chambered revolver, and a double-barrelled gun
capped and loaded hung within easy reach. On being conveyed in a
cart to prison he seemed flattered by the curious crowd that followed,
and he even held his hand-cuffs aloft to attract attention. He expressed
disappointment at the trial that he had not died fighting , and informed
the Judge that ? If he did not draw it mild he would return the com-
pliment should they ever meet in the bush.? He was sentenced to 15
years imprisonment on three charges of robbery on August 2, 1870.
A redeeming feature in Power?s career was that he never harmed one
of the weaker sex. Excellent behaviour and the fact of his health
failing, gained him his freedom after having served the bulk of his time.
As a free man he was engaged by the former owners of the ? Success?
to be of interest to visitors to the old hulk, and the old hulk was
always of interest to him. His ill health preyed upon his mind, and
having wandered away, was shortly after reported to have been found
drowned in the Murray, near Swan Hill, 7th November, 1891.

ANDREW GEORGE SCO! T, alias Captain Moonlight, was
I nan dauntless courage and a most notorious scoundrel. He
differed from most in that he possessed a good education, being quali-
fied as a surveyor and civil engineer. He was born in 1845, of Pro-
testant parents, at Down, Ireland. Arrived in New Zealand
in the u Black Nagle, early in the sixties, and served in the volunteers
in that colony from 1861 to 1867. In 1868 he arrived in Sydney,
and two years after began his criminal career by serving a sentence of
18 months for forgery and uttering. On the 28rd July, 1872, he was
sentenced to 10 years for robbery under arms in Victoria. His conduct
in prison gave ample forecast of his subsequent criminal career. He
was punished for no less than 22 breaches of discipline, two of which
were violent assaults ; one on Chief-warder Kelly and the other on a
fellow-convict. On the 17th February, 1877, he actually had the
temerity to ? bail up? the officer in charge at Pentridge,threatening to
murder him with a knife with which he had armed himself, and de-
manding his watch and chain without delay. He then retired with
his plunder to the bathroom, warning the warders not to come near
him, ?as he was well armed and well victualled for a few days.? For
this freak he obtained extra imprisonment. Upon his liberation, in
1879, he gave a series of lectures in the Temperance Hall, Melbourne,
on his prison experiences,* which were a financial failure. He is next
heard of as leader of a gang of desperadoes, who stuck up and robbed
the Bank at Egerton. The police were soon on their trail and encoun-
tered the gang at Wantabadgery, where a bloodthirsty skirmish took
place, which resulted in Senior-constable Bowen and two of the bush-
rangers being shot dead. Moonlight and Bogan, the only other sur-
vivor of the gang, were executed at Darlinghurst Gaol, Sydney, on the
20th January, 1880. The former wished to make a speech, but Bogan
was stolid and indifferent, and there, standing on the scaffold, with
white caps drawn, they shook hands , and were instantly afterwards
launched into eternity.
DANIEL MORGAN?WiII ever be remembered as a cruel,
brutal ruffian, standing almost alone amongst bushrangers for cool
, audacity and unfeeling ferocity. For the most past, his plunderings
and murders wfere perpetrated single-handed. He possessed the
solitary instincts of a prowling beast of prey. In a word, he com-
mitted no less than 10 robberies under arms, plundered three mails,
wounded four and murdered three men. On January sth, 1864, the
N.S.W. Government offered a reward of �5OO for his apprehension. He
replied by overtaking Police Sergeant McGinnity, robbing him of his
horse and fire-arms, leaving him lifeless on the road. The reward of
T5OO was then doubled. John McLean and Sergeant Smith (who
received fatal wounds from the merciless miscreant) were the next
victims, and then the reward for him, dead or alive, was increased to
�1,500. In 1805 he crossed the Murray, and stuck up the station of
Mr, Evans, of Whitefield, Victoria. With a revolver in each hand


and four others in his belt he ordered his horse to be brought, and,
mounting it, deliberately turned and fired indiscriminately among the
persons he had assembled, a ball passing clean through the hand of
a man raised in protest. Teamsters were bailed up all along the
line ot route to Wilton. On April 9th, emboldened by previous
successes, he visited Pecchalba Station, 20 miles from Wangaratta,
owned by Mr. McPherson, Having made prisoners of all he found on
the station, he helped himself to a hearty meal, having ordered a lady
to play for his gratification on the piano the while. He attended to
his toilet with great care, but all this bravado cost him his life. On
his arrival, a servant girl had slipped away unnoticed and communicated
with the police. Morgan having packed up everything of value, was
leaving when he found every avenue of escape cut off by a cordon of
28 troopers and armed settlers. Goaded to desperation, yet daring as
ever, he was hurrying to the paddock to secure the fleetest horse, when
John Quinlan, a station hand, fired point blank at him, the bullet
going clean through the body. He fell yelling and cursing and died
in great agony. At the inquest the jury returned a verdict of justi-
fiable homicide.

PRICE?S MURDERERS.
JOHN CHESLEY ?Was of the Church of England persuasion,
a carpenter by trade, but with all the low-bred instincts of a criminal.
He arrived in 1841 as a prisoner in the ? Eliza,? but shortly after
completing his sentence, was found guilty of assault with intent to rob.
He was then sent to Norfolk Island from whence he escaped and came
to Victoria. He made a most daring attempt to escape from Pentridge
in March, 1855, but was recaptured about 3i miles from the gaol by
a band of settlers who had joined the warders and police in the chase.
As a carpenter he had been engaged repairing the warders? quarters,
when one morning, he boldly mounted one of Mr. Price?s horses, and
with his tools in his hand attempted to pass the armed sentries as if
he had leave from the Inspector General. Finding himself challenged
he rushed through, running the gauntlet of the prompt firing from
every direction. One bullet went through his hat, another grazed his
face, while his jumper and shirt were riddled with shot. ' He was
slightly wounded, and was sentenced to a term on the hulk ? Success?
in 361b. irons. _ He was tried for complicity in the murder of Mr. Price
in 1857. During that memorable trial he conducted his own defence,
pointing out very ingeniously where its different points did not agree,
and after thanking God for moving the hearts of the jury in favor of his


fellow-prisoners, he boldly asserted he had neither hand, act, or par*
in the murder. This statement being totally at variance with the
evidence, he was executed on April 30th of the same year at the early
age of 82,
FRANCIS BRANNIGAN ?AIias ? Bragan,? was bom at Birr,
Ireland, in 1814. Transported to Tasmania by the ? Tortoise ? for a
trivial offence in 1842 for 14 years. Crossed the Straits to Victoria
in the ? Mary ? in 1854, became notorious through being concerned"
in four robberies in the Maryborough district, and, though committed
for trial, escaped from custody when en route to Castlemaine. He was
wounded by the police sentry at the time and �lOO reward was offered
by the Government for his arrest. On the 14th April, 1855, he was
secured at Bullarook Forest, Victoria, in company with five others,
known afterwards as Brannigan?s gang. They were all sentenced to
15 years, first three years in irons, for numerous highway robberies.
The leader, being a violent ill-tempered ruffian, was ordered to a special
cell on board the ? Success,? where he afterwards led the wild mob
that muideied Mr. Price in 1857. He was the first man to attack the
Inspector General, whom he caught in his arms and hurled to the
ground when the rush was first made. Of the seven men executed for
the crime, April, 1857, Brannigan alone admitted his guilt. On the
hour of his execution he recognised his former captor, Inspector
Stony, amongst the crowd assembled at the foot of the scaffold, and
bowing, wished him ? a very good morning.?
WILLIAM BROWN ?Was a mere lad, being scarcely 19
years of age. He arrived in Victoria in 1852 as a free seamen in the
?Helen,? who had worked his passage out to the colonies. He
deserted his ship, and on finding a mate went to the Forest Creek
goldfields. Being unsuccessful at the diggings he and his mate started
a downward career, for they were implicated in several robberies with
violence. He was secured and received a sentence of seven years.
He was one o�Mr. Price?s murderers, and was executed on Wednesday,"
April 29, 1857. In height he was sft. lin., ol slight frame, fair
complexion, with brown hair and light grey eyes. He was born in
Glasgow in He had been brought up to the sea, and was a
Presbyterian. His appearance was far from repulsive.
RICHARD BRYANT ?Or ?Bryan Hennis,? was born in
Dublin in 1808. Pie had followed the trade of a sawyer, and was a
Roman Catholic. He arrived in Victoria by the ? Moffatt,? in 1840,
and after committing several highway robberies under arms on the
Melbourne load, near Keilor, in company with two others, he was
arrested, the other two getting away. After obtaining his liberty he
was on two different occasions convicted of robbery, for which he
received seven years. He was an old and hardened offender, in whom
reformation was perfectly hopeless. He was a most designing man,


and nothing ever made him afraid. He was one of the prisoners con-
cerned in the murder of Mr. Price, and was executed on the morning
of Wednesday, the 29th of April, 1857. In height he was sft. 11 Jin.,
of stout build, sallow complexion, dark brown hair and hazel eyes.
He was in his 54th year at the time of his execution. A more
? tiger-like ? demon never paced the boards of the ? Success,? and as
for being concerned in every deed of violence committed, he was one
of the ringleaders.
JOHN PRICE ?Late Inspector-General of Penal Establish-
ments for Victoria, was also Chief Commandant of Penal Establish-
ments in Van Dieman?s Land. He was a son of Sir Rose Price, a
Cornish baronet, and was married to a niece of the late Sir John
Franklin, and at the time of his death left a widow and six children.
He is supposed to be the Maurice Frere of Mr. Marcus Clarke?s
depicting in ? His Natural Life,? and is here shown as he appeared
after the fatal blows were struck on the afternoon of the 26th March,
1857, which were committed by the prisoners along with him.
Ceils No. 1. to 38 were for the better conducted prisoners
or those whose sentences were of a lighter nature than the lower deck,
and also for the prisoners who were working ashore in the quarries
after having served a probationary term of two years in the lower cells.

Captain PRICE commanding GIPSY SMITH to return to
his cell at the time of the rush of Melville and his comrades on the
evening of the 22nd of October, 1856.
1. Solitary Confinement Cell.
2. GIPSY SMITH was one of a number who, becoming excited
by the utterances made by the leader of the Chartist agitation, at a
meeting held on Kennington Common, looted a pawnbroker?s shop in
Southampton Row, London. He loaded himself with watches and
jewellery, and was promptly seized and sentenced to 12 years? trans-
portation in Van Diemen?s Land. From thence he escaped, but, being
recaptured, was sent this time to Norfolk Island. He escaped from
there to Victoria in 1854. Having taken to bushranging, he was soon
standing his trial for murder, but the charge being afterwards altered
to highway robbery, he received a sentence of 16 years on the
? Success.? In confinement he was notoriously uproarious and inso*
lent, but under the influence of Mr. Chaup, the Inspector-General


who succeeded Mr. Price, he became so changed as to be released on
ticket-of-leave, and was afterwards employed by Mr. Lang (son of the
Rev. Dr. Lang, Sydney), who often had occasion to entrust him with
large amounts of money, which confidence he never forfeited. Return-
ing to the Ovens district, he decided to marry, but living unhappily,
he one night drowned his wife in a dam. Doomed to death, he tried
to defeat the law by cutting his throat with a jagged piece of razor
that he had successfully concealed in his boot. He had pretended to
be asleep with a rug over his head, when the warder at his side felt
the prisoner?s arm fall heavily on him, raised the alarm, and obtained
assistance. Executed on the day following, 22nd April, 1861.
3 and 4. Solitary Confinement Cells.
5. WILLIAM STEVENS. ?A native of Cornwall, England.
He was partner with his brother in a brig which arrived in Victoria in the
latter part of 1858, laden with timber. Soon after their arrival the
crew deserted. The brothers, however, managed to discharge their
cargo, and, having employed a watchman for the craft, started also for
the diggings, whither the crew had gone. The weather, however, was
against travelling, being awfully boisterous, and as their dray was con-
stantly ? stuck,? they were a long time on the roads, and as they were
drinking freely, their stock of grog soon ran out. One night they
camped close to Sawpit Gully, near a party who were also proceeding
to the diggings. In a drunken state, William Stevens advanced to
the travellers, and demanded a case of brandy, either by payment or
otherwise ; but he would have it. The carrier from whom the grog
was demanded refused, which caused a quarrel to ensue, the result
being that firearms were used freely. One of the travellers was woun-
ded. On the next day he was arrested, and brought to Melbourne,
where he was tried for stealing brandy and firing at with intent. He
received a sentence of 10 years, and was forwarded to the ? Success,?
where he formed in a few years the leader of the gang which made so
desperate a struggle to escape with Melville, and who was the one who
struck Owens, the warder, and then, with the stonecutter?s axe in
hand, jumped overboard. His body was never recovered.
6. RICHARD JONES. ?A native of Wales. He came
to the colony a free man, but on arrival started for the Ballarat dig-
gings, where, in a drunken brawl, a man named Conroy threw a
tumbler at him, injuring him seriously on the thumb. He was
arrested, after resisting violently, and was sentenced to seven years on
various charges. He was the prisoner who feigned sickness for the
space of 8 months for the purpose of effecting his escape, having secre-
ted 5 knives in his cell; but after the expiration of 8 months, seeing
he had only managed to cut his way half through the ship, his heart
failed him and his plot was discovered.

9. HENRY GARRETT. ?This remarkable man first gained an
unenviable reputation in 1855, by sticking up the Bank at Ballarat.
Victoria, and robbing it of �16,000, in broad daylight. On his
escape to London he was followed and brought back in custody
and sentenced to 10 years? imprisonment on the ? Success.?
In 1861 he went to New Zealand, on ticket-of-leave, where ho resumed
his criminal career. On one occasion, in 1862, he bailed up and tied
to trees no less than 17 men in one day, for which he received another
sentence of 10 years, this time for robbery under arms. On becoming
free he adopted clothes of a clerical cut and white tie, and carried a
large Bible under his arm, and while in this dress the police sLv him
enter a store by a dark right of way and caught him red-handed loot-
ing the safe and loading himself with valuables. Some 20 burglaries,
of which he had been in no way suspected, were now traced to him,
and he received in all 22 years? imprisonment. He had much literary
ability, having written and published a very readable ? Hssay on
Crime,? and many other interesting fictional sketches. As a burglar
he was ingenious in his disguises and astute in his methods, and as a
bushranger it is said of him that he never took the life of any. of his
victims. He died a few years ago, aged 72, thus finishing a
chequered and misspent career.
10 OWEN SUFFOLK ?Was a native of London. Ho was
also transported to Van Dieman?s Land, but did not stay long there,
as he escaped and came over with nine others in the year 1858. Recei-
ved 8 years in Victoria, for sticking up the mail coach running between
Melbourne and Geelong. The mail that day was a comparatively light
one, and he did not receive much recompense for his labour. Having
served his full time on that charge, he started on a second expedition,
in the way of forgery, for which he received 17 years. After doing a
portion of his sentence, he was allowed on shore to work in Williams-
town, and during the whole of that time he was always concocting
? rushes,? but the others (who were not pleased with him or his ideas,
he being at that time considered ? Price?s spy?), were not to be caught
by him. He was eventually taken on board the ? Success,? and
never allowed ashore. When he became free he went to Melbourne
from Williamstown, and in a few days wrote a book which was entitled
? The Days of Crime and years of Sufferance,? for which he received
a sum of � lO. He was the most accomplished rogue that ever stepped
into shoe-leather, and whilst on the ? Success ? he was constantly
concocting something of a villainous nature. He afterwards went to
London, where he married a widow lady with an only daughter, and
one day he arranged with them for an outing on the water in a small
skill*. This was accomplished, and whilst on their way homewards he
threw mother and daughter into the Thames. Ht immediately pro-
ceeded to the house, in order to secure all his wife?s property and
deeds of a portable nature. He was followed by a boatman who had


witnessed the whole affair, and from his evidence he was sentenced to
22 years? imprisonment. The pamphlet he wrote contained a unique
and graphic description of the early days of Victorian criminality.

13. RICHARD HILL. ?A native of London. He was a well-
educated and pleasant-speaking man. He had been a lawyer?s clerk in
London, but came to Victoria in the year 1858. When at the Ben-
digo goldfields he committed several robberies under arms, sticking up
several small stores on the outside of the diggings. He was soon
arrested and sent to Melbourne, where he was tried on the above
charge, and sentenced to 10 years? imprisonment. He was sent to the
? Success,? and being clever at stone-cutting was allowed on shore to
work. He was chosen by Stevens as one of the party in the rush, and
was the person to receive the first shot from the shore during that
escapade, and which is fully described in the pamphlet.
14. RICHARD ROWLEY. ?A native of Limerick, Ireland,
born in 1817, convicted in his native town of attempted murder, sen-
tenced to 10 transportation in Van Diemen?s Land. He escaped
from Port Arthur in 1854, and came to Victoria. After working at the
diggings a short time, he took to bushranging between Melbourne,
Bendigo, and the Black Forest. He was captured at the Lady of the
Lake Hotel, at Bulla, near Melbourne, on the road to Bendigo, nine
months after starting his exploits, and received in Melbourne, where he
was tried, a sentence of 22 years. He was sent to the ? Success,?
where he was confined four or five years. After the death of Mr.
Price, he was removed to Pentridge ; being there a few months he
assaulted one of the overseers (Kilmartin) by striking him on the head
with a pick-handle, at the same time pushing him into a quarry 30
feet deep. Kilmartin?s legs were broken at the thighs, together with
receiving a deep scalp wound on the forehead. He was attended by
the Chief Medical Officer, Dr. McCrea, who pronounced his case hope-
less. He lingered, however, for a period of two years, but eventually
recovered sufficiently to be able to walk about, but he was the most
pitiable object to be seen at Coburg, or ever the lot of man to discern,
although previous to the assault one of the most upstanding of men.
Eowley was then forwarded to the Melbourne Gaol, and brought up
for trial for assault and attempted murder before his Honor Judge
Barry. He was sentenced to death, and was executed a short time
after.

17. JACKY WILLIAMS ?Or ?Big Black Jack,? as he was
generally known amongst those on the ? Success.? He was the reci-
pient of a sentence of 15 years in London, when he was sent to Van
Dieman?s Land, for robbing a store and safe-cracking. He did a
portion of his time there, when he escaped, and came to Victoria in
1858. He took to the roads immediately after his arrival in Victoria,
but was soon arrested on a charge of highway robbery. He was ser-
ving this sentence on the ? Success? at the time of the attack on Mr.
Price, and while the officers? attention was directed towards the out-
rage he broke his leg-irons and escaped, was re-arrested, and sentenced
to wear the iron punishment band, as represented. He was recogn-
ised by Mr. Price as an absconder from Norfolk Island, and it did
not require much insubordination on his part to receive an additional
three years from Mr. Price. He, however, served his full time and
became a free man, but nothing was heard of him afterwards.
18 to 21. Solitary Confinement Cells.
22. HENRY SMITH ?Alias ? Shylock.??Born in Dublin, in
1818. Arrived in Sydney by the ? Sovereign,? in 1848. He was
then sentenced to a term of seven years, under the name of Christo-
pher Brennarf. His time expiring, he sailed to England, but returned
as a free immigrant in 1847, by the ? Coromandel,? and was subse-
quently convicted of horse-stealing. He had but two months to
serve when he became conspicuous in the attack on Mr. Price, whose
head he shattered with a fearful blow with a shovel. In evidence at
the trial, it came out that during the melee , he stripped off his shirt
(which was one mass of blood), and burned it in the blacksmith?s
shop adjacent. Executed, 28th April, 1857.
23 and 24. Solitary Confinement Cells:
25. Cell occupied by Power the bushranger while
serving 14 years for horse-stealing and attempted murder.
26. JOHN YOUNG ?Was a native of Cloford, Gloucester,
England. He was one of the Pentonville?s who were sent to the
colonies and landed quietly at Geelong. Went off to the diggings, and
there he settled down to a life of quietude for a considerable time, but
he again became anxious to gain the filthy lucre, as in an unguarded
moment on the part of his comrades, he placed a quantity of strychnine
in the tea, but his plot was discovered. He w T as arrested at Bendigo
and sent to Melbourne, where he was tried by Chief Justice Stawell,
and received a sentence of 12 years aboard the ? Success.? He was
another of the most troublesome of prisoners ; he was constantly in
trouble. He was kept on board the ship, never allowed ashore. He,
however, served his full time ; but once free, he again became as
violent as ever, and was not long at liberty before he com-
mitted one of the most atrocious of crimes. He was executed
in Castlemaine Gaol, 21st August, 1865. On the 28th Decem-
ber, 1864, a miner named Graham, residing in Daylesford, on


his return from his night shift, after 12 o?clock, found his young
wife Margaret?to whom he had been married only six weeks ?
lying on her bed with her throat cut, and her legs hanging ever the
side of the bed. On the Bth of the following January, Constable
Brady arrested Young for this most foul murder, and after a great deal
of delay and difficulty, sentence of death was passed upon him on the
28th July, 1865. Born at Colford, Gloucestershire, about 1881;
by trade a miner. He was also one of the men tried for the murder of
Mr. Price, but he was acquitted.
27 and 28 Solitary Confinement Cells.
29 WILLIAM JONES?Otherwise ? Black Bill??was a
native of Cardiff, Wales. He was transported from his native town to
ser\e a sentence of 10 years in Van Dieman?s Land for attempting
arson. He escaped from there, and came to Melbourne, but hearing
of the diggings in 1853, he, in company with two others, started for
Castlemaine and Forest Creek diggings. On their way they started
pilfering and sticking-up, but were soon captured. They w T ere all
tried in Melbourne together and received various sentences. The
Judge gave a light sentence to the tw 7 o comrades, viz., five years each,
but Jones received rather a severe one, as the Judge, taking into con-
sideration that he was an escaped convict, sentenced him to 22 years.
He was also implicated in the murder of Mr. Price, but as there was
no evidence to prove he even struck a blow, he was acquitted. After
serving a long sentence, with as much solitary as would have killed a
dozen others, he w T as transferred to Pentridge, where he served the
remaining part, and became free.
30. DANIEL DONOVAN?Was a native of Ireland, but was
transported to Van Dieman?s Land for a period of seven years for
arson. After doing some of his time in Van Dieman?s Land he was
sent to Norfolk Island, where he became acquainted with Mr. Price.
Whilst at Norfolk Island he w r as witness to one of the most revolting
acts of humanity it was possible to see. The then Inspector-General
of Penal Lstablishments, a Mr. Machonochie, w 7 as rather of a humane
disposition towards the convicts and allowed them liberties of which
they were pleased, and won their respect. For instance, each prisoner
who was of good behaviour w 7 as allowed a little kitchen garden around
his hut, besides when at work the liberty of a ? billy ? of tea at dinner-
time. When Mr. Price took charge and succeeded Mr. Machonochie
absolutely, he did not fall in with this idea, and quickly confiscated the
? billy of tea,? besides removing them to more remote portions of the ~
island, away from the gardens. This w r as the beginning of serious
acts of revolt and rebellion, and his life w 7 as not safe on the island. In
order then to put their plan into effect a man named ? Jacky Jacky,?
who w r as serving a sentence for life, murdered one of the watchmen of
a gate at the Stockade, and on Mr. Price coming amongst them,
although always on the alert, had to retreat speedily amongst the ranks
of the soldiers who were keeping guard over them. After this an


order was issued by the Government that on the next occasion of a
like nature the soldiers were to fire on the miscreants. The prisoners
implicated were tried within the gaol walls by the Visiting Judge, and
11 men were executed for this affray. Donovan soon after this
managed to effect his escape, and crossed to Victoria, but started a
series of highway robberies, and on being arrested and tried received
a sentence of 16 years, which he served on the ? Success.? He became
a free man, but like many others who had been in this ? ocean hell ?
found that his health was seriously impaired, and he soon afterwards
died.
31 and 32. Solitary Confinement Cells.
33. FREDERICK MACDONALD.?A native of Glasgow,
Scotland, arrived in Victoria about the year 1852 ; was charged with
forgery, for which he received a sentence of nine years before Mr. Jus-
tice Stawell, when he was also sent to the ? Success.? On the evening
of the boat?s affray he was discovered sitting in the boat, having over-
heard the plot, and wishing to be free had secretly hidden there.
When Power discovered him he said to Macdonald, ? What are you
doing here, and why did you not say you wanted to come ? ? to which
he replied, ? Oh 1 don?t throw me overboard, Harry, for I want to get
away ; and thinking you were going to be free I would like to be the
same.? He was tried with the boat?s crew, and returned to the
? Success,? where he served his full sentence.

34. THOMAS MALONEY. ?A native of Limerick, Ireland.
He was transported with another to Van Dieman?s Land for attempted
murder, for a term of ten years; escaped from Van Dieman?s Land
early in 1854, when he came to Victoria, and proceeded to the Bendigo
goldfields. He soon committed a series of petty robberies, but being
caught was sentenced for a term of eight years, and was sent to the
? Success ?to complete it. He was one of the most insubordinate of
all the prisoners thereon, as his sentence accumulated to 14 years for
insubordination and breakages of prison discipline. Pie was one of the
gang who assisted in the murder of Mr. Price, for which he was
executed with the others. The records state that he arrived as a
prisoner of the Crown in the ? King William ? in 1840, and after
obtaining his freedom was convicted of felony. He was by trade a
butcher. In height he was sft. Tin., of stout build, pale complexion,
brown hair and grey eyes. He was 32 years of age, and anything but
prepossessing ; and at his trial after the death sentence had been passed
on him by Judge Barry for the murder of Mr. Price, requested that
he might be publicly executed.
35 and 36. Solitary Confinement Cells.
37. JOHN HEFFERNAN?Otherwise ? Big Jack ???was a
native of Kilkenny, Ireland. He was also transported to Van Dieman s
Land, and it is known he formed one of a party of 10 who left a boat
at Brighton Beach in which they had escaped. He found his way to
