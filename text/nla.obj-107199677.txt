A Description in Verse of the passage of the BARQUE SERENA,
from Norway to Melbourne. Composed by f. Rowlands,
Chief Officer “Serena,” Jan. 1907
DEDICATED TO THE
ROUSE STREET, PORT
ITS CHAPLAIN,
\\J E left a Port in Norway,
OVV f One glorious Summer day,
CIN The breeze was balmy off the land,
And birds were singing gay;
The crew were also sober —
All healthy, hardy men—
They gave three cheers, as we left,
That echoed through the glen.
Good many young Norwegians,
Of Swedes and Germans, few
Danes, English, Scotch and Irish boys.
Are members of the crew;
Oh, yes! there is another —
The writer of this rhyme—
That spent away, by Moelfie Bay,
The happiest of his time
Hugh Dagwell, the Commander,
Is robust, strong and tall.
And we are all, both big and small,
Obedient to his call;
And also Mr. Semple—
Both from the Erin's Isle
His eyes are bright with beaming light,
And always has a smile.
With all these varied seamen,
The sails were set up tight.
The wind was fair, the weather fine,
The coastline well in sight;
We caught some scores of mackerel
When sailing the North Sea,
And now we are close to Dover Cliffs,
France yonder on the lee
The wind was from the North’ard
And blowing very strong,
We carried topsails—courses to ),
And fast we sailed along ;
The Lizard at a distance
Is on the starboard beam;
Now, friends, farewell ! we wish you well,
And leave you all the cream.
We steered to the South'ard,
Fine weather did prevail,
And crossed the Bay, and to the trades
Without a single gale.
The weather getting warmer,
The trades unusual light,
Then calm, and b iffling winds, and rain
In torrents day and night.
We pul'ed and hauled the braces,
Excessive was the heat—
You could upon the heated plates
Fry either fish or meat!
Caught dolphins and bonitas,
With sharks we had some fun—
They fell a victim at the sound
Of Captain's Dagwell’s gun.
The wind came from the Eastward,
And then we travelled fast,
So all our troubles are by now,
Recorded with the past.
The broadest belt of Doldrums
I’ve ever seen before,
Increased our passage to the line
In days to fifty-four.
SEAMEN’S MISSION,
MELBOURNE (THROUGH
REV. B. COZENS).
We saw the Isle of Tristan
Da Cunha, on the way —
This is a proof, beyond a doubt,
That we are not astray.
Of whales we saw great many,
And watched them with delight.
They blew away, in clouds of spray,
The water to the height 1
Sea birds are with us daily,
So gaily on the wing,
The Albatross moves through the air
As stately as a ling.
The question now arises:
“ Where do they get their feed ?”
I quickly answer, in reply,
‘ God gives them all they need."
About the vast blue ocean
I won’t have much to say ;
Our average sailing is about
Three hundred miles a day.
We are occupied in making,
And taking in, the sail.
We keep an eye to watch the sky,
And fly before the gale.
As we are fast approaching
The bold Australian shore,
And as my song is getting long,
I won’t prolong much more.
There is nothing of importance
Just now for to relate,
I therefore put away my poem
Until a future date.
And when ti e land is sighted
Delighted we shall be,
We 11 jump with joy at “ Ship ahoy!
The Pilot on the lee 1”
And when we get to Melbourne
And land upon the soil,
The sailor boys will all rejoice,
Regardless of their toil
We reach the port in safety—
This is a happy day ;
A cable will be sent at once
To England all the way;
Wives and daughters will rejoice,
And sons, with boundless glee,
Will praise the Lord with one accord
Upon their bended knee.
We find a Seaman’s Mission,
Where we can all attend
And get a warm reception from
A true and faithful friend;
All sects and creeds invited—
They’ll treat you as a guest,
And welcome free, both you and me,
Within this Sailors’ Rest.*
