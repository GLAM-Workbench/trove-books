To the Memory of the Pioneers
of Methodism in the Southern
World this Book is dedicated.


“ I look upon all the world as my parish,—thus far, I mean, that in whatever
part of it I am, I judge it meet, right, and my bounden duty to declare unto all that
are willing to hear the glad tidings of salvation.” —JOHN WESLEY.
“ I want the wings of an eagle and the voice of a trumpet, that I may proclaim
the Gospel through the East and West, the North and the South.” —Dr. COKE.
“ The British settlement in New Holland is a very wonderful circumstance in
these eventful times. The islands in the Great Pacific Ocean could not have been
settled, unless there had been a settlement formed previously in this country. The
Missionaries could never have maintained their ground, had they not been
encouraged, and supported from Port Jackson. How mysterious and wonderful are
all the ways of God. The exiles of the British nation are sent before to prepare the
way of the Lord.”—Rev. SAMUEL MARSDEN.
“ If we do not make haste, the Gospel and the civilisation which follows it, will
have revolutionised the Islands of Polynesia, and will leave us no memorials to tell
of idolatries which once prevailed, and of primitive arts and of strange customs
which have passed away for ever.”—Rev. J. H. FLETCHER.
“ When the pioneers of our Church have passed away, and the traditions of
early toil and triumph have become as the indistinct memories of a dream, and the
cause now so promising has spread and grown until it covers the land with its
goodly shadow, the future historian of Methodism will turn to its pages with those
of kindred character, that he may trace the spirit, the courage, the liberality, the
earnestness of this early age, and weave therefrom that narrative which, perchance
in other days, shall wake a sympathetic temper, and provoke an answering zeal.”—
THE CHRISTIAN ADVOCATE.
“We men, who in our morn of youth defied
The elements, must vanish; —be it so!
Enough, if something from our hands have power
To live, and act, and serve the future hour;
And if, as toward the silent tomb we go,
Through love, through hope, and faith’s transcendent dower,
We feel that we are greater than we know.”
—WORDSWORTH.

PREFACE.
11 |OR the writing of this book no apology is necessary. The
11 o Australian Conference of 1860 resolved that it was “desirable
|i|y I that we should have a record of facts and incidents respecting
ie introduction of Methodism into these Colonies ” ; but that
I f c\ yS) i
resolution has not hitherto been carried into effect. This is
g) t-G) the first attempt, therefore, to set out the beginnings of
Methodism in Australia and Polynesia ; and is, indeed, the
gT) first history of any section of the Protestant Church in New
South Wales. The Methodist Conference of 1904 approved of this
work even before its publication in a resolution which stated that “the
Conference rejoices to learn that the task of preparing a History of
Methodism in New South Wales has been undertaken by the Rev.
James Colwell, and heartily commends the proposed
publication to the approval and support of our people throughout the
State.”
After careful consideration as to the method of writing this History
which would afford the most reliable information in the most interesting'
manner, I determined, as far as possible, to use the available material
in its original form, and to allow the persons mentioned in the History
to tell their own story. As the work progressed I became more and
more convinced that the method adopted would meet with the approval
of far the greater number of readers. The time for writing a
philosophic History of Methodism has not yet arrived. In the illustra-
tions, only pioneers and officials have been included. Notwith-
standing repeated private and public appeals, I have been unable to
secure photographs of some pioneers whose memories deserve to be
honoured. In the arrangement of the illustrations, it has been found
necessary to distribute them evenly throughout the book. This will
explain why some illustrations appear where they have no apparent connec-
tion with the text.
It is with great pleasure that I acknowledge the assistance I have
received from many friends in the publication of this work. My thanks are
specially due to the late Rev. Ur. Lane for reading the manuscript and for


valuable suggestions, besides placing at my disposal the information gathered
throughout many years of service ; to the Rev. J. E. Carruthers for material
collected during his Ministry, and for the loan of useful books ; to the late
Rev. J. A. Nolan for access to a manuscript book prepared with great care ;
to Mr. John Orton for the use of the Journals and papers of the late Rev.
Joseph Orton ; to Mr. H. L. Tyerman for copious extracts from the Journals
of the late Rev. Joseph Oram ; to the Rev. John Watsford, the Rev. John
Pemell, and Mr. J. G. Turner, all of Melbourne, for interesting particulars of
several pioneer Methodists ; to the Rev. Paul Clipsham, of The Methodist
Office, and the Rev. Dr. Brown, of the Mission Office, for access to papers
and the use of blocks ; to Dr. Andrew Houison for the pictures which appear
in the chapter entitled “ Foreword to Mr. John Corbett for his character-
istic and constant helpfulness ; and to many other Ministers and laymen who
have placed information at my disposal. Finally, my very sincere thanks are
due to Mr. William Brooks, the publisher, whose enterprise and the con-
fidence reposed in me have made this publication possible. To my wife I
am also greatly indebted. She has helped me in many ways, the most
laborious being the typing of the greater part of the manuscript.
That there are defects in this History I am well aware ; but I may be
permitted to state that I have spared no labour to make it accurate and reliable.
For any discrepancies, almost unavoidable in a work of this nature, I ask
the generous indulgence of the reader. For the most part the materials have
been gathered and the book written during the busy life of a Minister in
charge of a country Circuit.
After four years’ labour my task is finished. It has been a labour of
love. The work was undertaken for the glory of God; as a service to the
Church, to which I owe everything; and to perpetuate the memory of those
whose loyal and loving service is an inspiration to noble deeds. I have
endeavoured to make it worthy so great an object; and I now send it forth
with the fervent prayer that God may crown this humble effort with His
blessing, and so use it as to promote His glory.

NOTE.—I am greatly indebted to Mr. Mark Blow, proprietor of the Crown Studios, George
Street, Sydney, for valuable help rendered in the preparation of the -fine Photographs and
Reproductions to be found throughout this book. Mr. Blow has not only taken deep interest
in the work—he has given ample proof of the possession of great artistic skill.

INTRODUCTION.
IHi tup l?l:V. GPORGI: LAM I:, D.D
JliiiiiL
I' HISTORY of Methodism in New South Wales,the Mother State and
jW ~ 1 1 the cradle of Methodism in Australia, has long been needed. This
want was often expressed; but until the Rev. James Colwell gave
himself to the work no one with sufficient knowledge, leisure, liter-
ary skill, and denominational enthusiasm seemed willing to take
'^o -If) U P as^- * s a ma -tter for congratulation that one so well
b'fO qualified by original research, careful and laborious examination of
facts, and the collection of authentic records, has at last supplied
the want in a manner so attractive and informing.
When the First Fleet sailed from England in 1787, laden with the
potentialities of a new nation beneath the Southern Cross, setting forth on an
enterprise which in some respects was entirely lacking in romance, fame or
honour, yet fraught with possibilities so momentous that within a century and
a quarter there should be in the South Seas eight British Colonies, six of
which were united in the Commonwealth; little, if any, notice was taken
thereof by the citizens of London or the newspapers of that day. So with the
sailing of the pioneer Wesleyan Missionary, the Rev. Samuel Leigh. On a
tombstone in Reading Church-yard is written this unique and suggestive
inscription: “The first Wesleyan Missionary to the Southern World.”
He builded better than he knew; for he was instrumental in saving souls
and erecting Churches ; setting in motion waves of moral and spiritual influences
which have never ceased to exert themselves for the honour of God, the wel-
fare of mankind, and the prosperity of the people who dwell here.
The worth of history cannot be exaggerated. It is one of the forces work-
ing for righteousness in Australia, and among those forces has been the story
of the Methodist Church. In proportion to its numbers, resources and oppor-
tunities, it has not been one whit behind, but rather in the vanguard, of the


C hristian ( hurches of the Southern World. A proper knowledge of its History
should save any of its members from being ashamed of it, or from forgetting
the wonderful influence it has exerted upon the doctrines, fellowship, worship,
and Evangelistic and Foreign Mission enterprises of modern Christianity. If
the Methodist Church be that of our intelligent choice, if bound to it by ties of
gratitude and love for conversions and the edification of believers, let us try to
teach our children that it is not merely a human institution to which our par-
tialities or prejudices have attached us, but a Divinely sanctioned system of
religion and happiness worthy of their choice and adherence. “ Parents who
train their children on the principle that they may go to any Church where
they can feel most comfortable, need not wonder when it seems most com-
fortable for them to go nowhere.”
The difficulties in writing this work were very great. The history is so
recent. And yet longer to defer the task would present even greater
obstacles. “Interest grows less vivid; truth becomes harder to find
out; memories pale, and colour fades.” The writer does not assume
an indifferent neutrally. Methodism through its Founder and its influence
did a great work for New South Wales in its early history. Its power
for good was great and widespread. That power is still at work,
a fact which this history abundantly reveals. Here there is no hiding
or distortion of the truth ; neither is there exaggeration or boasting.
Ihe actual makers of our history have wisely been allowed to speak
for themselves by extracts from their letters and journals ; and no pains have
been spared to make the narrative trustworthy and interesting. The reliable
information to which access has been gained, not without considerable toil, has
been used with good judgment and ability; and the facts are presented in a
readable and attractive style. Much new ground has been broken, thus making
the narrative increasingly interesting.
Even as a stream, small and insignificant, may irrigate some meadow
where sheep and cattle quietly pasture and where daisies smile—a silent stream
furnished here and there with forget-me-nots and helping to swell the river, in
w r hich it seems to be lost on its way to ocean—so may this story bring joy to
those who read it, and by the inspiration it supplies be fruitful of lasting good.

rOPEWOPD.
THIz DISCOVERY AMD SETTLEMENT OE AUSTRALIA.
DURING the seventeenth century, one of those impressions, the origin of
which cannot always be traced, had taken possession of the mind of
Columbus, with the result that he could not rest until he had discovered
a new world which he presented to his King and country. A similar
belief in the existence of a great continent in the Southern Seas exercised the
minds of many European philosophers during the 17th and 18th centuries.
Somewhere in the south waiting to be discovered, lay Eldorado with its golden
city. The Spaniards and the Dutch, then the chief maritime powers, fitted out
expeditions in the year 1605. De Qmros, the Spanish commander, succeeded in
reaching one of the larger islands of the Louisiade Archipelago, which he rashly
concluded to be the main land of Australia. Torres, his lieutenant, being storm
driven, touched the mainland in the vicinity of Cape York. On his return in
1609 De Ouiros made known his discovery and urged the King of Spam to enter
into possession. But the King, as Lang quaintly remarks, not being a second
Alexander, was more than satisfied with the splendid discoveries of Columbus.
The Dutch expedition —a solitary vessel named The Duyfhen—e^ the
south-west extremity ol New Guinea, entered the Gulf of Carpentaria and coasted
along the Australian peninsula. To which of these brave companies belongs the
honour of discovery is a moot point, though Flinders unhesitatingly awards that
honour to the Dutch. A third claimant for this distinction appears in the French.
Their claim is based on the contents of a report discovered in the Burgundian
Library at Brussels, first given to the world in the year 1601. Documents found
later still, in the British Museum and the War Office of Pans lead Sir R. C. Raw-
linson, when President of the Royal Geographical Society in 1872, to say
“We must own that the French are without a rival in the field.”—(L^,
vol. i., p. 4.)
The first Englishman to visit Australia was Dampier; who, at the command
of King William lIP, made a voyage of discovery in the year 1699. The famous
Captain Cook did not reach Australia till the year 1770, when, as the result of
three voyages, he completely established the existence of the Great South Land,
and set at rest the problem which had exercised so many minds. Cook landed
at Botany Bay, where he planted the ensign and took possession on behalf of his
countrymen, naming the country New South Wales from its fancied resemblance
to the Welsh principality. With Botany he was much pleased ; for to him it
was a garden of flowers. But John White, the Surgeon-General to the first fleet,
demolished this pretty fancy. “The fine meadows,” says he, “ talked of in
Captain Cook’s voyage, 1 could never see, though I took some pains to find them


out.”— (White's Journal , p. iio.) It was left to Phillip to explore the spacious
harbour at the head of which Sydney now stands. And it was also left to Phillip’s
countrymen to take advantage of this great discovery. For though the Dutch
and Spaniards were not wanting in that skill and courage which enabled them
to navigate unknown and dangerous seas, they had yet to learn the art of success-
ful colonization. Herein the practical Englishman led the way. Indeed, it has
been argued with much show of reason that the hand of God was in this matter,
and that He reserved this land for the British, who were to make Australia the
fountain head from which should flow streams of spiritual blessing, together with
the benefits of civilization, to the lovely islands of the South Pacific. Had
Australia fallen under the power of Spain the glorious Mission scenes in the
Islands would not have been witnessed, and the grand story of the triumphs of
the cross would not have been told. In their place we should have had a repeti-
tion of the dark and revolting tales which have characterised the reign of oppres-
sion and misgovernment in South America. From that calamity Australia has
happily been saved ; and though none dare claim that British administration has
been free from blemish, it must be admitted that on the whole the methods
adopted have made for the general good and prosperity of the people.
When the historian attempts to trace the development of the religious life of
Australia he lacks that inspiration which North American history supplies. Here
there are no records of sturdy Puritans, who, for conscience sake, gave up all
save God, to make a home on the wild New England shore, where “ they left un-
soiled what there they found; freedom to worship God." But no Divine, or any
other afflatus inspires the pen in this instance ; for at the best the early settlement
of Australia is a sad, and an unlovely story. The British Government found itself
suddenly confronted with this problem: Where can we send those criminals
sentenced to transportation? Since the reign of James I. an outlet had been
found in North America and the West Indies ; where, under the misguided man-
agement of contractors, empowered to hire the criminals to planters, a sphere of
labour, if nothing more, had been found. —( Lang , vol i., p. n.) The war of
American Independence put an end to this arrangement. The West Coast of
Africa was next tried; but here it was soon discovered that transportation only
was necessary —the climate did the rest! Just at this juncture Cook’s discoveries
drew attention to Australia; and Lord Viscount Sydney, then Secretary of State
for the Colonies, suggested the establishment of a penal settlement in New
South Wales. This antiquated idea—for the Persians and the Romans first
adopted it- —was eagerly seized upon by the Imperial authorities. In seeking to
give effect to this suggestion the British Government had before it a grand and
noble aim—-the reformation of its criminals by affording an opportunity to start
a new life.
These aims have been thus summarised:—(i) To rid the mother country
from time to time, of the yearly increasing number of prisoners who were accu-
mulating in the goals. (2) To afford a proper place for the punishment of crimi-
nals, as well as for their progressive and ultimate reformation. (3) To form a

free Colony out of the materials which the reformed prisoners would supply, in
addition to families of free emigrants who might be induced to settle in the
country. —(. Leigh's Life , p. 35.) To give effect to their views the Government
selected Captain Arthur Phillip, R.N., and a better selection could not well have
been made. For though Phillip was somewhat quick of temper, he was benevo-
lent of heart and worked earnestly in the best interests of the Settlement.
Leaving Portsmouth on the 13th of May, 1787, with a fleet of eleven sail, he
arrived at Botany Bay on the 18th, 19th, and 20th of January, 1788, after an
uneventful voyage of eight months. The company included 850 male and female
convicts, a full complement of officers and soldiers, together with forty women,
wives of the marines, and their children. An examination of Botany Bay
brought disappointment only. The harbour, though extensive, did not affoid
good anchorage, the land was sterile and barren, and the spot selected was un-
suitable for the proposed settlement. Phillip at once sought a better place.
Cook had marked an inlet to the north of Botany Bay, which he named Port
Jackson. This port Phillip determined to explore. And it was well that he did
so ; for a harbour of surpassing magnificence broke on his view, the spacious
beauties of which further examination only enhanced. One can well understand
the poet thus breaking out as he contemplated the future:


Hear me,” Hope cried, “ye rising realms! record
lime’s opening scenes, and truth’s unerring word:
There shall broad streets their stately walls extend.
The circus widen and the crescent bend ;
There, ray’d from cities o’er the cultured land
Shall bright canals and solid roads expand.
There, the proud arch, Colossus-like, bestride
\on glittering streams, and bound the chafing tide;
Embellish’d villas crown the landscape-scene,
Farms wave with gold, and orchards blush between.
There shall tall spires and dome-capt towers ascend,
And piers and quays their massy structures blend:
While with each breeze approaching vessels glide,
And northern treasures dance on every side! ”
Port Jackson, said White, “ I believe to be, without exception, the hnest
and most extensive harbour in the universe, and at the same time the most secure
being - safe from all the winds that blow.” —{Whites Journal , p. 121.) Phillip
resolved to found the Colony here, and a move was made at once from Botany
Bay. As to what followed let an eye-witness speak:—“ The Governor, Captain
Phillip, with a party of marines, and some artificers selected from among the
seamen of the Sirius, and the convicts, arrived in Port Jackson, and anchored
off the mouth of the cove intended for the settlement, on the evening of the 25 th
January, 1788 ; and in course of the following day sufficient ground was cleared
for encamping the officers’ guard and the convicts who had been landing in the
morning. The spot chosen for this purpose was at the head of the cove, near
the run of fresh water, which stole silently along 'through a very thick wood, the
stillness of which had then, for the first time since the creation, been interrupted
by the rude sound of the labourer’s axe, and the downfall of its ancient inhabi-
tants , a stillness and tranquillity, which from that day were to give place to the
voice of labour, the confusion of camps and towns, and the ‘ busy hum of its new
possessors.’ As soon as the hurry and tumult necessarily attending the disem-
barkation had a little subsided, the Governor caused His Majesty’s commission,
appointing him to be his Captain-General and Governor-in-Chief in and over the
territory of New South Wales and its dependencies, to be publicly read together
with the letters patent for establishing the courts of civil and criminal judicature
m the territory. ... The ceremony of reading these public instruments
having been performed by the Judge Advocate, the Governor, addressing himsell
to the convicts, assured them, among other things, that he should ever be ready
to show approbation and encouragement to those who proved themselves worthy
of them by good conduct and attention to orders ; while on the other Panel
such as were determined to act in opposition to propriety, and observe a contrary
conduct, would inevitably meet with the punishment which they deserved H
remarked how much it was to their interest to forget the habits of vice and md C
lence, in which too many of them had hitherto lived, and exhorted them to be
honest among themselves, obedient to their overseers, and attentive to the several
works in which they were about to be employed. At the conclusion of this address
three volleys were fued by the troops, who thereupon returned to their parade,
where the Governor, attended by Captain Hunter and the principal officers of


the settlement, passed along the front of the detachments and received the
honours due to a Captain-General, after which he entertained all the officers
and gentlemen of the settlement at dinner, under a large tent pitched for the
purpose at the head of the marine encampment.”—( Collin's History , p. 8.)
To follow this infant settlement through its initial stages, to attempt a
record of its struggles and sorrows, and to show how, through a fiery discipline of
trial, it struggled to success, would travel outside the scope of this chapter. But
it is necessary to touch lightly some features of that time, so that what followed
may be viewed from the right standpoint. Phillip’s first and greatest difficulty
was to make the Colony self-supporting; for so long as he looked to England for
supplies, he leaned upon a prop which occasionally gave way, the results being
disastrous. As a beginning nine acres of land were cleared for cultivation at
Farm Cove, now covered by the Botanical Gardens. But whatever astonishing
results present day methods of cultivation may bring forth, very little was done
then. The land was pronounced unsuitable, and a site was chosen at Parra-
matta, with the result that in November, 1791, 700 acres of land were under
cultivation there. Phillip soon discovered that the class of people under his
control were not suited to agricultural pursuits, and there was only one man in
the Colony who could successfully instruct them in agriculture ; and unfortu-
nately, he died three years after Phillip’s arrival. Glowing accounts of
the possibilities of Norfolk Island having been given by Captain Cook, Phillip
founded a settlement there. But failure was writ so large here that this project
was abandoned after a few years. To encourage settlement in the young Colony,
Phillip made liberal offers to free settlers and emancipated convicts. Free land,
farm implements, seed and rations for twelve or eighteen months, were offered.
Some took advantage of this liberal provision and settled prosperously. Others
saw in it an opportunity to secure land to be bartered for rum. Notwithstanding
all Phillip’s efforts in this direction, agriculture fared ill, fresh consignments of
hungry, scurvy-stricken men continued to arrive, while the provisions grew small
by degrees and beautifully less.” The weekly rations were reduced, until in
1790 each person was allowed only 2j lbs. of flour, 2 lbs. of rice, and 2 lbs. of
pork. Even this pittance was still further diminished, the Governor putting him-
self on the same meagre allowance, and giving to the general stores a quantity
of flour which he owned. How could strong men be content, 01 live on such
small supplies? And yet what else could Phillip do? dhe alternative was
plenty for a time and then starvation for all. Some few, nevertheless, kept up
a brave heart, smiling at their difficulties. It is said that when the officers dined
with the Governor, the wags of the party were seen carrying their small loaf of
bread on their bayonet or the point of their sword. But others would not smile,
and they yielded to excesses or abused their trust. The stores were frequently
raided. The Norway rats, most unprincipled thieves, stole all they could carry
away, and they had to be endured. But the human thieves, when discovered, were
banished to a solitary rock in the harbour, which they suggestively named Pinch-
gut.” When this punishment failed, Phillip became severe and inexorable. Seven


soldiers guilty of theft were hanged one morning. Their officers pleaded
for mercy, but Phillip thought it better that seven men should die than that the
whole settlement should perish of hunger. One unfortunate glutton, on receiving
his weekly allowance of flour baked it, and at one meal gorged himself with the
v hole. He was afterwards taken speechless and senseless, and died the follow
ing day a loathsome object. Others devoured their food in two days • trusting
to their wits to make up the deficiency for the rest of the week. Matters had
reached such a pass that all labour was suspended, the men being too weak to
perform the lightest tasks. When the last extremity was reached help came
from England.
Fortunately this state of things did not continue. Gradually land was got
under cultivation, maize and wheat were grown, and the people were able, in some
measure, to support themselves. During the time of Hunter and King, Phillip’s
successors, the people suffered many hardships ; but they were never again at
the point of starvation. Prices were sometimes abnormally high, as much as 70
and even 80 shillings being given for a bushel of wheat; while in one instance
a settler in the Hawkesbury district paid £j for a bushel of seed maize. In July,
1803, there were 16,624 acres of land cleared, 7,118 being planted with wheat,
and 5,279 with barley, maize and other grain. The average produce of wheat
land was 18 bushels per acre. Live stock numbered nearly 22,000, and the popu
lation stood at 7T34- Several respectable settlers arrived in the Colony during
Hunter’s, King’s, and Bligh’s time, the most notable being a body of Scotch emi-
grants, who landed in 1802 and made for themselves a home at Portland Head on
the Hawkesbury River, where their descendants are found to this day.
But the greatest affliction sprung up after Phillip’s departure through ill
health in December, 1792. Captain Hunter, who succeeded him, did not arrive
till September, 1795, the affairs of the Colony being administered during the
interim by Major Grose and Captain Patterson, One of Governor Grose’s first
acts was to substitute military authority for civil government; thereby placing
the control of the territory virtually in the hands of the officers of the New South
Wales Corps, the greater part of whom arrived with the second fleet. Whether
Grose foresaw the results of his action cannot be said. But it wrought nothing-
short of disaster; and to quote the words of Lang, “ entailed ten thousand sor-
rows on the Colony. “For the next fifteen years,’’ to cite again the same au
thority, the history of the Colony “ exhibits little else than a series of struggles
for the mastery, between the Governor on the one hand, and that powerful and
influential body on the other.” —(Langs History , vol. i., p. 49.) That the settle-
ment survived, and was not finally abandoned, is surprising. The non-com-
missioned officers secured licenses to sell rum, and the chief constable and chief
gaoler soon followed the example of their superiors. This not only Jed to the
making of immense profits ; it established a system of monopoly and extortion
which struck at the root of all commercial morality. Maurice Margarot, who
had been transported for urging the people to effect a reform in Parliament,
said in his evidence before a Select Committee of the House of Commons, that

the officers purchased the goods brought into the Colony and sold them at a
profit of 500 per cent. “ I believe I am not out when I say, that a sieve to sift
meal, which cost them ss. pd., has been sold for three guineas, and rum I have
known sold at £8 a gallon, which cost 7s. 6d ” Margaret adds that all the officers
to a man, were engaged in this trade. And Captain Kemp, of the New South
Wales Corps, when giving evidence in 1811, said:—“ The Governor, clergy,
officers, civil and military, all ranks and descriptions of people, bartered spirits
when I left Sydney, viz., in May, 1810.” But it must be borne in mind that Kemp
was a member of the New South WMles Corps whose officers first instituted, and
then manipulated, this monopoly. Rum became the currency ; and the inhabi
tants were facetiously divided into two classes: those who sold rum, and those
who drank it. And to such a pass had matters come, that Macquarie once petu-
lantly remarked, that there were but two classes in the community of New South
Wales: Those who had been, and those who ought to be convicted. T his, hap-
pily, was an exaggeration ; for even in the darkest days there were many re-
spectable people who lived soberly and walked uprightly.
The facilities for obtaining rum brought forth other evils of a still more
harmful nature—if that be conceivable. Profligacy generally follows hard on
intemperance. If Lang may be accepted as an authority matters had come
to an evil pass. The officers of the New' South Wales Corps, who had led the


way in the rum selling monopoly and usury, also took the lead here. They
“ were neither all married nor all virtuous men. Some of them, it is true, lived
reputably with their families and set a virtuous example to the Colony, even in
the worst times; but the greater number took female convicts of prepossessing
appearance under their protection, and employed them occasionally in the retail
business there was no attempt at concealment: decency was outraged on
all hands, and the prison population laughed at their superiors for outdoing
them in open profligacy, and naturally followed their example. (. Lang's History ,
vol. i. p. 52.) In Governor King’s time the same authority states: “Neither
marrying nor giving in marriage was thought of in the Colony ; and as the
arm of the civil power was withered under the blasting influence of the miserable
system that prevailed, the police of the Colony was wretchedly administered,
and virtuous industry was neither encouraged nor protected. Bands of bush-
rangers or runaway convicts traversed the country in all directions, and, entering
the houses of the defenceless settlers in open day, committed fearful atrocities.”
(Ibidem , p. 71.) It was also during King’s time that women were disposed of
as so much live stock. “ I have seen them afterwards sold,” reports Holt, “ one
of them for a gallon of rum, others for five pounds and so on ; and thus they
were transferred from one brutal fellow to another without remedy or appeal.”
(Fison, Methodist History , vol. i., p. 21.) And even under Macquarie’s regime
the Factory at Parramatta, a depot for female convicts, was in such a
deplorable state through want of proper oversight, that it led to Macquarie’s
recall and the appointment of Commissioner Bigge to report upon the matter.
Among many other terrible things he said: “ The horrors and immoralities, the
filth and wretchedness of the female prison at Parramatta ” were such that
they cannot be described!
To avert, or, in some measure to minimise this profligacy which Phillip
foresaw, he urged the convicts to marry ; and for a time it seemed that his advice
would be generally accepted. The Chaplain, the Rev. Richard Johnson, was
kept quite busy. But, if the truth must be told, Collins says that when the motives
of those who applied to the worthy Chaplain were scrutinised, it was found that
the contracting parties were under the impression that the marriage state brought
with it certain comforts and privileges denied to those who remained unmarried.
When these expectations were not fulfilled, some actually applied to be relieved
from the bonds into which they had voluntarily entered. And they feelingly
declared that marriage was a failure.
It is sad to think that so little was done by the Imperial authorities to
minister to the religious requirements of the criminals and the early settlers.
The Rev. Richard Johnson, the sole Chaplain, was a good, though unobtrusive
roan, the possessor of a meek and patient spirit, which must have been sorely
tried during his twelve years’ residence. At the foundation ceremonies he was
quietly put on one side. Flags were hoisted, guns fired, and officers invited to join
the Governor in drinking success to the new settlement ; but it was considered
superfluous to allow the Chaplain to seek Divine blessing on the people or the


land. Indeed, had it not been for the pressure brought to bear on Lord Sidmouth
by Mr. Wilberforce, and a few earnest friends belonging to the Society for the
Propagation of the Gospel, the first fleet would have sailed without a Chaplain!
The noble Lord ridiculed any attempt being made to reform criminals by the
power of the Gospel. It was seven years before Mr. Johnson could get a
Church erected, his services up to that time being conducted in the open air.
And when at last he did succeed, the convicts put a firestick into it, and it
speedily disappeared. But here the Governor stepped in and made the culprits
build another Church ; at the same time intimating that if they burned that one
down, they should replace it. Phillip also set a good example, and for a brief
period attended Divine worship himself, making attendance compulsory upon all
others. It cost an overseer three lbs. of flour and a convict two lbs., if his place
were vacant. This kind of persuasion added to the numerical strength of the
congregation ; though it is to be feared the Chaplain’s discourses were not
received with a glad and willing heart.
It is, however, only just to add, that Phillip’s successors, Hunter, King and
Bligh, attempted to break down the infamous monopoly in the traffic of rum and
merchandise. Bligh sought earnestly to abolish military despotism, and issued
prohibitions against the sale of rum and its barter. But they each and all
failed. Hunter and King returned to England, while Bligh was actually placed
under arrest by Major Johnston, who acted, it is said, at the instigation of
Macarthur and others. In his letter to Bligh, Johnston said: “I am called upon
to execute a most painful duty. You are charged by the respectable inhabitants
of crimes that render you unlit to exercise the supreme authority another moment
in this Colony ; and in that charge all the officers serving under my command
have joined 1 therefore require you, in His Majesty’s sacred name to resign your
authority, and to submit to the arrest which I hereby place you under, by the
advice of all my officers, and by the advice of every respectable inhabitant in
the town of Sydney.” Bligh’s “ crimes ” were an attempt to break down the
rum monopoly, and in its place to set up sound and healthy government. If
“ every respectable inhabitant in the town of Sydney ” considered that such a
purpose rendered the Governor “ unfit to exercise the supreme authority another
moment in this Colony,” then matters had come to a sorry pass!
The “ officers,” together with the “ respectable inhabitants,” were so over-
whelmed with gratitude at this merciful deliverance from the cruel hand of
Governor Bligh, that on the 30th January, 1808, their feelings could only find
adequate expression in the following manner: A General Order was issued in
which “ The officers, civil and military, are ordered to attend Divine worship on
Sunday next at the New Church ; and every well-disposed inhabitant is requested
to be present to join in thanks to Almighty God, for His merciful interposition
in their favour by relieving them without bloodshed from the awful situation in
which they stood before the memorable 26th instant.” Unfortunately, no
particulars of this unique thanksgiving service are available. If they were, it
would be interesting to note the pious ejaculations and the fervent responses of

this combination of evil doers, guided in their devotions by the Rev. Henry
Fulton, who, unwillingly, was forced to officiate. But though it was an easy
thing to appease their consciences thus, the Imperial Authorities were not so
readily cajoled. When conversant with the facts of the case, Bligh was promoted
to the rank of Rear-Admiral in the navy ; Johnston was placed under strict
arrest, sent to England, court-martialled at Chelsea Hospital on the 7th May,
1811, and sentenced to be cashiered ; the sentence to be read at the head of every
regiment, and to be considered “ inadequate to the enormity of the crime of
which the prisoner had been found guilty.” Macarthur was prohibited from
returning to the Colony for eight years. The “ respectable inhabitants ” were
thus deprived of the services of these two gentlemen, and the way was opened
for the appointment of Governor Macquarie.
Thus matters stood when Methodism first struck root in Australian soil.
Its growth and fruition must be studied in light of the foregoing facts.

CHAPTER I.
*
PREPARATION.
THE progress of early Methodism exhibits three well-defined
stages. First comes that of Wesley’s personal ministry when
the work extended with such amazing rapidity, and attempts
were made to consolidate and conserve the various develop-
ments. This period was followed by seven years’ strife and struggle,
wherein the Church was tested, purified and ultimately rewarded with
triumphant success. For there suddenly appeared in its ranks “men of extra-
ordinary capacity, who elevated its intellectual character, confirmed its system,
and developed its energy in plans for universal Missionary conquest. (Sec
Stevens History of Methodism, vol. hi., chap, xi.) This was the third stage, and
the period of Missionary enterprise. Within the short space of eleven years, four
new Missions were undertaken. The continent of Africa was enteied in 1811,.
Asia followed in 1814, Australia in 1815, and Polynesia in 1822,
It is not claiming too much to say that Dr. Coke was the founder of the
Wesleyan Missionary Society, as he was doubtless the originator of Home
Missions. His life was an inspiration to noble deeds; his death a summons for
the Church to rise universally and march around the world. To him more than
to any man, the impulse given to Mission work is due. At A esley s last
Conference in 1790, a Committee of nine members, of whom Coke was Chairman,,
was appointed to take charge and present the claims of what was then a new
interest. Nine later the Conference resolved to take the West Indies undei
its care. Coke, who became its agent, was authorised to prepare a statement
for information and circulation. T. his he had previously done in the interests
of a Mission to Asia upon which he had set his heart. The document, which
was circulated in 1784 was entitled: “ A plan of the Society for the Establishment
of Missions among the Heathen.’’ The address was as follows:
“ To all the real lovers of mankind: —The present institution is so agreeable
to the finest feelings of piety and benevolence that little need be added for its
recommendation. The candid of every denomination (even those who are entirely
unconnected with the Methodists, and are determined so to be) will acknowledge
the amazing change which our preaching has wrought upon the ignorant and
uncivilised, at least throughout these nations ; and they will admit that the spirit
of a Missionary must be of the most zealous, most devoted, and self-denying
kind. Nor is anything more required to constitute a Missionary for the heathen
nations than good sense, integrity, great piety, and amazing zeal. Men possessing
all these qualifications in a high degree we have among us, and I doubt not but


some of these will accept of the arduous undertaking, not counting their lives
dear if they may but promote the kingdom of Christ and the present and eternal
welfare of their fellow creatures. And we trust nothing shall be wanting, as far as
time, strength, and abilities will admit, to give the fullest and highest satisfaction
to the promoters of the plan, on the part of
“ Your devoted servants,
“Thomas Coke, Thomas Parker.
“ Those who are willing to promote the institution are desired to send their
names, places of abode, and sums subscribed to the Rev. Dr. Coke, in London,
or Thomas Parker, Esq., Barrister-at-Law, York.”
In 1801 Coke became Mission Treasurer, and was so involved in Mission
enterprise and steeped in the Missionary spirit that he has been humourously,
though none the less truly, called the “ Minister for Foreign Affairs.” This
remarkable man, who was born in Brecon (Wales) in 1747, was the only child of
wealthy parents. Educated at Oxford, he became a Clergyman in the Established
Church, being ultimately led to a more spiritual view of religion through an inter
view with Maxfield, Wesley’s first lay Preacher, and an untutored Methodist
Class Leader with whom he afterwards conversed. Charged with being a
“ Methodist,” admonished by his Bishop, dismissed by his Rector, threatened
by the mob and chimed out of Church, he took to the open air and cast in his
lot with the people derisively called “ Methodists.” At once he became Wesley’s
most valued coadjutor, receiving this advice from him; “ Brother, go out; go out,
and preach the Gospel to the world.” Crossing the Atlantic eighteen times at
his own expense, he was the first Bishop of American Methodism, and until his
death, had charge of the Missions throughout the world. When nearly seventy
years of age he presented himself to the Conference as a Missionary for the East
Indies. To his friend Samuel Drew, who urged him on account of age not to
make such an attempt, he replied; “ I am now dead to Europe and alive for India ;
God Himself has said to me : ‘Go to Ceylon !’ I would rather be set naked on its
coast, and without a friend than not to go.” With this purpose in his heart he
pleaded on the floor of the Conference in 1813. Many rose to oppose his scheme ;
Joseph Benson said it would “ ruin ” Methodism ; but Coke spent the night in
prayer, made a thrilling speech the next morning, backed up by a magnificent
offer of financial help ; and by his enthusiasm and devotion, bore down all opposi-
tion. With George Erskine, John McKenny—who was to be left at the Cape
of Good Hope as the first Methodist Missionary to South Africa—and five others,
he set sail on the 30th of December, 1813. In his farewell sermon at Portsmouth,
he said; “Itis of little consequence whether we take our flight to glory from the
land of our nativity, from the trackless ocean, or the shores of Ceylon!” From
the trackless sea his spirit took its flight; for in the Indian Ocean his servant
found his body cold and stiff lying on his cabin floor. The night before his death
he sang:' — “To me remains nor place nor time,
My country is in every clime;
I can be calm and free from care
On any shore, since God is there.”


As the sun was setting, his body was lowered into the depths. ihe death
of such a man is like the fall of a monarch, but of a monarch, who has founded a
permanent dynasty and an invincible empire. He lives still, and lives a more
effective life than when he was in the flesh. Paul preaches around the earth to-
day, as Homer still sings to every scholarly ear. Luther yet lives, leading the
moral forces of modern civilisation. And we may not doubt that when, in the
distant future, the historian shall mention the great men of our day, as we do the
Pauls, Augustines, Luthers, and Calvins of the past, the Welsh Methodist
Thomas Coke, will be cited among the chief of those, who in this age, conducted
the plans by which the human race is to be regenerated.’ (Stevens History of
Methodism , vol. hi., p. 341.)
Coke was dead, but his spirit lived; and the impulse given by his death led
to the formation of Auxiliary Missionary Societies throughout the Church, and
the ultimate formation in 1818 of the General Wesleyan Missionary Society, to
be coextensive with the Connexion and to consolidate its whole Missionary in-
terests.” A board of managers was appointed, comprising Ministers and laymen ;
and Joseph Benson, Jabez Bunting, Joseph Taylor and Richard Watson, were
among its first Secretaries. In the ranks of the Ministers, Watson and Buckley,
Morley and Everett, Reece and Atmore, aided the new movement by their per-
suasive and powerful preaching; while Billy Dawson, 1 Sammy Hick
and Jonathan Saville stirred the masses to demonstrative enthusiasm by their
rugged eloquence, their natural genius and their overwhelming spiutual power.
Bulmer and Butterworth, Marsden and Marnot, Thompson and T armer, with a
number of other influential laymen, ably assisted their Ministerial Brethren, and
set in motion a wave of Missionary zeal which swept before it all obstacles and
gave to the Church a record of Missionary triumphs never before
surpassed, not even in the days of the Apostles. 2 Thus the Church became
sympathetic and responsive to appeals for help; and it was well that
it was so; for the provisional Committee, afterwards superseded by
the newly organised Society, found itself called on to face a fresh entei-
prise. From a far off land, then but little known and only thought of as a conve-
nient place in which to try a doubtful experiment, came the following pathetic ap-
peal from a pious layman, Mr. Thos. Bowden, who had made his home in Sydney ,
1 Dawson had a famous speech popularly known as his “telescope speech. Coiling
his resolution into the shape of a spy-glass he professed to look down it and asked:
“What do I see?” describing in his answer characteristic scenes of heathenism, ihen
turning in another direction he demanded : “ But what do I see in the distant prospect,
describing the scenes of millennial peace, love and glory.
2 The following is the development of the Missionary Committee. Between 1803 and
1804, during Coke’s absence in America, the London Ministers thought it desirable to
form a Committee of Finance and Advice, composed of Ministers and Laymen. In 18
the Conference recommended the appointment of Circuit Committees, and Deorge Moiley,
then Superintendent at Leeds, proposed an extraordinary effort in his Circuit, in w nc
his colleagues, Jabez Bunting and Robert Filter, supported him. This example was
widely followed and Branch Societies were multiplied. The Conference of 1817 approved
of a scheme for the formation of a General Missionary Society, and its first annuM mee -
ing, which lasted six hours, was held in City Road Chapel, May 4th, 1010. ihe lirst
Mission House, two rooms in Mr. Bruce’s house, 4 City Road, was taken in 1010 at a
rental of £24 per annum.


“ Sydney, New South Wales, July 20lh, 1812.
On the 28th we got safely into this Port, which is a most astonishingly
beautiful, romantic, capacious, and commodious harbour, of which 1 need say but
little, several authors having done this better than I can do. ..... Of Mecho-
dists, we have here in Society the following persons: in Sydney, Mr. John H.
who leads a Class in his own house, consisting of Mr. H., Mrs. 8., and Mrs. 1., and
three of the senior girls in the school. Mr. B. has also a class in his house,
consisting of Mr. H., I. F., T. J., husband of the above, and a soldier or two of
the 75th Regiment. Our meetings are generally very comfortable and profitable.
At W mdsor, we have a class under the care oi Mr. E., consisting of six. Mr.
E. is a pious, sensible young man . . . from Ireland, where he was con-
verted. . . He was bred to the bar; and being a humble, affectionate
disposition, and zealous in the cause of God, I doubt not . . . would make
a useful man among us. He has been employed for some months past in
teaching school, and he goes some miles into the country on Sunday, where he
reads the Church Liturgy, and expounds or preaches to the settlers, several of
whom are thankful for his labours. This is a very recent undertaking only of a
few weeks, so that we can speak but very little of its success.
March 6th, 1812, we held our first Class Meeting, and it has continued
ever since.
April 3rd. Our friends at Windsor came down, and we held a Lovefeast,
which was a most blessed season. God was eminently present, and gave us such
a meek, humble, simple loving spirit, that the place was a little heaven, and each
thought himself the most unworthy of so great a blessing. We had been con-
sulting on the most effectual means of procuring the Gospel among us by means
of itinerant preaching. We had justly concluded that, although we have a few
worthy Clergymen here, yet till we see more labourers going forth in the spirit
of their work, with pure, disinterested principles, labouring only to win souls to
Christ, we cannot reasonably hope that God will make bare His arm, and display
His saving power. y
“ We therefore determined to address our Missionary Committee, and to
solicit their aid in sending us some Ministers whom God has anointed for so
great a work. Of such men we doubt not our native country has several, whose
desire is only to spend and to be spent in the work of saving souls. ' . . .
One of the most powerful arguments we can urge is, here are thousands of souls
perishing for lack of knowledge, both in high and low life. Iniquity exceedingly
abounds ; and in many cases the only difference between the one and the other
is that which avarice or- oppression has made. . . The statement made
will show that abundance of work might be found for one or two Missionaries;
and could two be obtained, it would be a very great advantage, as they could
act in concert, strengthen each other’s hands in God, and their work
would be far pleasanter. As for their support lam allowed to state that could
they be sent out to us with a good allowance of books, wearing apparel, furniture
for a house apiece, we would be answerable for the rest. lam sure Mr. Marsden


GROUP OF EARLY MISSIONARIES.


would be glad to see the different settlements provided, and especially if we pro
ceed in the primitive way of Methodism ; not in hostility against the Church, but
rather in unison with it ; not so much to make a party distinct from the Church,
as to save souls in the Church. Of course, the Preacher should not be radically
a Dissenter ; if possible, one attached to the Establishment, as Mr. Wesley, Dr.
Clarke, and most of our primitive Preachers were.
“ I am, etc,,”
1 he Committee’s response to this appeal is found in the Conference Minutes
of 1814, wherein it is set forth:—
N. S. Wales: Two to be sent by the Committee.
Montreal: Samuel Leigh if wanted.
But before effect could be given to this determination the Committee received
the following official communication:—
To the Preachers and Members of the Committee of the Methodist
Missionary Society.
" Reverend Fathers, —
By the good providence of our God, we have been brought under
various circumstances from our native land, to this very distant country, and
here, in all probability, most of us who now address you, will be called to finish
our earthly course.
“ In the land which gave us birth, we enjoyed the privileges of the glorious
gospel, and in our union with the Methodists we had access to those blessed
means of grace which are the glory of that people. Here, we may truly say, ‘ the
people sit in darkness, and in the shadow of death ; ’ around us on every hand, we
see ignorance and profanity greatly abounding. Sin, and its consequent misery,
like an overwhelming deluge, overflows the land. We cannot but feel for our
fellow-creatures, degenerated, and depraved. We feel for ourselves as situated
amongst them. We feel for our children, the offspring of our bowels, whom we
may leave behind us when God shall be pleased to call us hence. To our God
we make our complaint, and look for help ; and under Him, Fathers, to you, as
the instruments of bringing us from darkness to His marvellous light. To you
our eyes are naturally turned, and that you may the better judge how to assist
us, we beg leave to lay before you the state of this country, and of our circum-
stances. There are probably 20,000 souls in this Colony, natives of the British
Isles, and their descendants. From the description of people sent hither, much
good cannot be expected. The higher ranks of those who were formerly con-
victs, are, in general, either solely occupied in amassing wealth, or rioting in
sensuality. The lower orders are indeed the filth and offscouring of the earth,
in point of wickedness. Long accustomed to idleness and iniquity of every kind,
here they indulge their vicious inclinations without a blush. Drunkenness, adul-
tery, Sabbath-breaking, and blasphemy, are no longer considered even as in-
decencies. All those ties of moral order, and feelings of decency, which bind
society together, are not only relaxed, but almost extinct. This is


the general character of the convicts, high and low; and, excepting
the civil and military departments of the Government, there is no other difference
than that which wealth naturally creates, in the means it affords for greater
indulgence in vice. The rising generation are very numerous, and, in general,
pretty well supplied with the means of instruction, schools having been estab-
lished in the principal towns and villages, but unfortunately the depraved morals
of the parents have an unhappy influence over the children. The advantages
of education are not sufficiently prized by the parents ; hence the children are
greatly neglected.
“ The present Governor of the Colony is a respectable man ; mild, moral,
and attentive to the forms of religion. He encourages every attempt to reclaim
or improve the people, and affords great assistance towards establishing schools.
In a word, he is all that can be expected in a Governor; and we are certain, he
would not discountenance further efforts to enlighten the people.
“ We have here four Chaplains sent out from England with handsome sala-
ries. The Rev. Samuel Marsden, principal Chaplain, resident at Parramatta, has
been in the Colony many years. Mr. M. is a man of considerable talents, and if
we were not to form a separate, independent Church, we have reason to believe,
he would afford us as much countenance as could be reasonably expected, in any
attempts to improve the morals of the people. The Rev. Wm. Cowper, second
Chaplain, resident at Sydney, is a zealous man, and endeavours to do good to
the people The Rev. Robert Cartwright, third Chaplain, resident at Windsor, has
been but a short time amongst us. The Rev. Henry Fulton, fourth Chaplain,
very recently appointed. With respect to them all, from their characters, we have
full reason to conclude that they would at least approve of farther exertions being
made among us, provided these exertions did not imply an opposition to the
Established Church. There are some Calvinist Dissenters’ Missionaries that
were some years since sent by the London Missionary Society to Otaheita, and
the South Sea Islands. Having been forced to leave the Islands, they came to
this Colony, and many of them have settled here in trade and business.
“ This country, in point of natural and political improvement, is far beyond
what is generally conceived at home. The policy of the present Government
is just, mild, humane, and encouraging ; the climate uncommonly fine and healthy,
and peculiarly favourable to an English constitution ; the country is beautiful,
exceedingly fertile, and intersected with capital roads • the necessaries and
luxuries of life abundant and easy to be obtained, and the mode of living, and
social habits, nearly the same as in England.
“ Sydney, the principal town and seat of Government, is populous and exten-
sive ; nearly half the inhabitants of the Colony live there ; and there a Preacher
would find much to do. Parramatta, a populous village, is situated 16 miles up
the country from Sydney, nearly in the centre of the Colony. Within from 5
to 10 miles of Parramatta, on every side are the following detached settlements
(in each of which are many families), namely, Liverpool, Prospect, Concord,


Baulkham Hills, Castle Hill, and Kissing Point; each of these may become
stations of which Parramatta would be the centre. 1 wenty miles inland from
Parramatta lies the populous village of Windsor, in the centre of a tract of 5°
miles of a fine agricultural country, on the banks of the HawKesbury River. The
tract is very populous, and settled by farmers ; and here there would be abundance
of employment from district to district. Sydney town would be the first and
principal place, then Parramatta, in the centre of the settlements around it, and,
lastly, Windsor, and the Hawkesbury country.
“ Blessed be God, notwithstanding the general depravity, there are a few
endeavouring to escape the overflowing of iniquity, and to serve the Lord in
simplicity and godly fear. We have formed two Classes in Sydney, and one
at Windsor. Our members now are 19 in Class, besides occasional attendants,
and by God’s blessing we look for an increase. At first there was only one family.
There are numbers who, from some remains of former impressions, and
many other causes, would join us heartily if we were a settled people, and had
a pious, upright man among us to preach to, and watch over us. Most of us
have been but a short time in the country. We are, however, endeavouring to
do as much as we can in the way of prayer meetings, etc.
“ Thus circumstanced and in such a country, your children begotten by you
in Christ, call upon you, Reverend Fathers, for help. Send us your aid. We
doubt not that you will think of the offspring of your labours, your tears, your
prayers. Send a faithful servant of the Lord to us ; surely there are many wil-
ling, yea, desirous to succour the disciples of our common Lord, to proclaim His
salvation to perishing sinners even in this distant land. Find out one such, and
send him among us: Deny us not; our hearts, our expectations are turned to
you Our hope is from you: disappoint us not. We call upon you in our own
behalf: leave us not forsaken in this benighted land. We call upon you in behalf
of our children ; let not them be left to perish for lack of instruction. We call
upon you in behalf of those who have neither opportunity nor inclination to speak
for themselves, perishing, dying sinners: leave them not in their blood. We call
upon you in the name of the outcasts of society, sent and daily sending thither.
Administer to them that word of life, which may make their exile a blessing.
Send us that gospel which you have received from the Lord to preach to every
creature. Send among us one of yourselves, and we, and a seed of the Lord,
shall rise to bless you. In order to make some provision for the cause of God
amongst us, we have vested a certain sum of money in horned cattle, the best
way in which it could be put out to accumulate, from the peculiar nature of this
country, and the great advantage arising from horned cattle by natural increase.
We look forward with a certain confidence, by the blessing of God, to be able, in
a few years, from this fund, entirely to support this work ; without at all con-
sidering the great probability of having our pecuniary means increased with the
increase of members as at home. This fund we have by deed conveyed to
proper trustees to be applied to the support of Preachers, etc.


“ You have now our state and circumstances laid before you, and are the best
judges of the qualifications necessary in the person you may be disposed to send
out to us. Yet we would beg leave to suggest these necessary considerations:
namely, I. That he be a single man. We could not as yet maintain a Preacher’s
family, and the expense of sending them out would be too great for us to wish
or expect you to incur. Besides, as he would have a great deal of active business ;
in fact, his way to make it would require greater attention and exertions, than a
married man could be supposed to make or give. 2. That he be legally qualified ;
a certificate obtained in the usual way in England, will be in force here. 3.
That he be rendered perfectly independent in all points of us and everybody
else; a regular credit established for him, to draw on as he may deem fit.
This suggestion arises not from our inability or unwillingness to support a
Preacher ; for, thanks be to God, we are all able and fully determined, and hereby
pledge ourselves so to do. But for other reasons, which we need not here specify.
4. As every article of English manufacture is extremely dear, he should have a
good supply of wearing apparel, house furniture, and, particularly, books. There
are few or no books of the Methodist stamp among us; he should endeavour to
bring a large supply of Hymn-books, Magazines, Religious Tracts, Biographical
Sketches, Mr. Wesley’s Sermons, and useful practical Works. A quantity he
might sell from time to time, and some give away.
“ In short, send us a Preacher tolerably supplied with wearing apparel and
books, and, by the blessing of God, he shall be no farther expense to you.
With a filial confidence in your paternal love, we subscribe ourselves
Reverend and Honoured Fathers, your Children and Servants in the Gospel of
the Lord Jesus Christ.

“ N.B. —Mr. Bowden went out to New South Wales as a school-master at
the request of the Rev. Mr. Marsden. Mr. B. was formerly school-master at the
Great Queen Street Charity Schools, and is highly respected by our friends in
the London West Circuit, where he was a useful, zealous Class-leader.”
To such appeals the Committee could not remain indifferent; and yet it
was not easy to meet promptly all the demands being then made. The Con-
ference of 1814, which met at Bristol, told Samuel Leigh to hold himself in
readiness to proceed to North America. Leaving his address with Dr. Adam
Clarke, then President for a second time, Leigh made a hurried trip home. Return-
ing to the Mission House he was informed that a letter had been received from
Montreal that morning requesting that no Minister be sent owing to the disturbed
state of the country. Half the passage money was returned and the ship set
sail without Leigh. Three week’s afterwards Leigh’s disappointment was turned
into thanksgiving, when he learned that the ship, with all on board, save four
persons, had gone down. Being thus set free, the Committee made arrangements
for his departure to Sydney.


It was in the beautiful village of Milton, one mile from Hanley, in Stafford-
shire, that Samuel Leigh was born ; the date of his birth being the Ist of Sep-
tember, 1785. Connected with the English Church, he attended the cottage
services conducted in the village by the Wesleyans, and by these and other means
obtained a sense of pardon. He joined the Independent Church at Hanley,
which was then small and weak ; and took a whole pe\v in the little Chapel
so that he might persuade the careless to attend public worship. The pew was
soon filled. Becoming a Lay Helper, he conducted services in the various villages
with acceptance and success. Meanwhile the conviction was deepening that he
was called of God to preach the gospel to the heathen. This led him to enter
a Theological School conducted by the Rev. Dr. Bogue. He agreed upon a three
years’ course of study for the sum of T4O per annum. It was not long before
he discovered a difference of opinion between himself and the Principal in their
views of theology. Bogue was a Calvinist; Leigh leaned to Arminianism.
Thereupon, he quietly withdrew, the severance being attended with feelings of
mutual regret. Through the intervention of his brother-in-law, he joined the
Wesleyan Society at Portsmouth, becoming Assistant to the Rev. Joseph Sut-
cliffe, M.A. While at Portsmouth, his heart was deeply stirred by an interview
with Dr. Coke, who was then leaving for Ceylon. Appointed to the Shaftesbury
Circuit, he worked successfully for two years, and witnessed the commencement
of five schools and the salvation of several men ; five of whom, after an absence
of thirty years, he found on the Local Preacher’s plan. His labours were so
excessive, that at the District Meeting, the Rev. Benjamin Wood desired his
Chairman to give him a friendly caution.
Leigh at first experienced some difficulty in persuading his Mother to recog-
nise his call to Mission work. “In some of her letters she remonstrated, expostu-
lated and entreated ; at other times, she wrote in tears, and expressed her deep
regret, that, in consequence of his obstinacy, the calamity she had long anticipated
was obviously becoming inevitable.”—( Leigh's Life, p. 13.) But he remained
steadfast. “ Soon after he left Shaftesbury, he received a letter from her (his
Mother), in which she said: ‘ Son Samuel, if the Lord has called thee to be a
Missionary, He will no doubt enable me to give thee up. May the Lord Himself
go with thee!’ On reading this letter, said he, I felt as merry and lightsome
as Christian, when his burden was loosened from his shoulders and fell off his
back. I sat down and wrote by the next post to the Rev. Joseph Benson, offering
to go to any part of the world.”—( Leigh's Life, p. 13.) On his last visit home, he
found his sister dying. In a few hours, he received a letter from London which
moved him greatly. “ Samuel, what is the matter ? Tell me, directly,” said
his mother. “I am sent for and must go,” he replied. His mother responded;
“ Always obey those who are over you, and you will generally be right. The
will of the Lord be done.”—( Leigh's Life, p. 14.) Committing his mother and
sister to the sure keeping of God, he took his long and last farewell and set out
for London. He had spent six hours only in his home!
He next appeared before the Lord Mayor of London, Sir William Domville,
on the 30th September, 1814, to make the declarations and take the oaths pre-
scribed by law, “ in faith and testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the


office of Mayoralty of the said city of London, to be put and affixed to this
license.” On the 3rd of the following month, he was publicly ordained and set
part “to feed the flock of Christ, and to administer the holy sacraments.”
His parchment bore the signatures of Adam Clarke, LL.D., F.S.A., Samuel
Pradburn, Thomas Vasey, and John Gaultier.
It was then found that the co-operation of the Government was necessary,
without which the proposed Mission would prove abortive. Dr. Clarke presented
the case to His Majesty’s Ministers, with the following results:—
“ On the 3rd of November, I wrote to the Right Honourable Lord Viscount
Sidmouth, stating that I had been applied to for a Missionary to go out to New
South Wales, and that I had been applied to also, for a Schoolmaster —that the
Schoolmaster and Mistress of our Charity School in Great Queen Street had
gone out thither ; and they, with several other settlers, prayed that we should
send them over one of our preachers ; that I had found a suitable person, Mr.
Samuel Leigh, who was capable of acting in this double capacity , and for whose
prudence and loyalty I did not hesitate to pledge myself ; and I wished to know
whether His Majesty’s Government would do anything towards accrediting the
said Samuel Leigh. To this letter I received the answer and memorandum, copies,
of which I here subjoin.— Adam Clarke.”
“Whitehall, November 19th, 1814.
“ Dear Sir, —I have to thank you for having favoured me with another part
of the important work in which you are engaged, and for the letter with which
it was accompanied. My acknowledgments have been delayed by my desire
to give you, at the same time, an answer respecting Samuel Leigh; which, as 1
am pressed for time, you will, I hope, excuse me for enclosing in the form of a.
memorandum.
“ I remain, with sincere esteem, dear Sir,
“ Your faithful and obedient servant,
“ Sidmouth.”
“ Memorandum; —The Governor of New South Wales has applied to Govern-
ment for some schoolmasters to be sent out to that Colony. Mr. Samuel Leigh,
a person recommended by Dr. Adam Clarke, appears fit to be employed in that
situation. The allowance is T5O per annum, and a passage provided at the
expense of the Government. If it should be considered more advisable for Mr.
Leigh to go out as a Missionary, the society for Propagating the Gospel in Foreign
Parts will grant him an outfit, and must (by regulation) apply to the Colonial
Department for a passage, with letters of introduction to the Governor of New
South Wales. No salary is allowed by Government; but if after a residence of two
years, he shall be considered by the Society as disabled by age and infirmity,
£lOO per annum will be granted to him for life by Government; or, if he dies
in the service, a pension of T5 O P er annum will be allowed to his widow.
“ Sidmouth.”


To this generous reply Adam Clarke wrote thus:—“l feel highly obliged,
by the very kind attention your Lordship has paid to my request, relative to Mr.
Samuel Leigh. But, not expecting such a favour as your Lordship proposes, and
■finding a vessel bound for New South Wales, I had, on the strong recommenda-
tion of a friend, taken, and (but two or three days before I was honoured by your
Lordship’s obliging offer) paid for his passage. As I did not know of any other
vessel going out for that place, and the Captain proposing to sail as on this day,
and some others pressing him to let them have the berth, I was obliged to close
with him by paying him the money. I wish Mr. Leigh to act in a twofold
■character, namely, as an instructor of youth in useful learning, and a teacher of
the adults in the knowledge of God, and their duty to their fellows; and for
earnest, prudent, well-directed endeavours of this kind, your Lordship knows,
from the constitution of the Colony, there must be the greatest necessity. But
I am now at a loss how I can avail myself of your Lordship’s generous offers. I feel
extreme delicacy in thus troubling your Lordship, but should be very happy to
receive your Lordship’s further directions, under the present circumstances of
the case.”
Lord Sidmouth briefly, but courteously, replied :
“Whitehall, November 30th, 1814.
“ Dear Sir, —As I find by yours of the 22nd instant, that you have provided
Mr. Samuel Leigh with a passage to New South Wales, nothing further appears
wanting to accomplish your wishes, than that of his being recommended to the
Governor of the Colony, to act in the. capacity of schoolmaster. I shall immedi-
ately recommend Mr. Leigh to Lord Bathurst, through whom all correspondence
passes with the Governor of New South Wales, who, I have no doubt, will direct
the Governor to appoint him to such situation in the Colony.
“ I am, dear Sir,
“ Your obedient servant,
“ Sidmouth.”
This correspondence made clear that Mr. Leigh was not dependent on the
■Government for his support, though he gladly received its protection. And he,
himself, insisted that he was not to look to the friends who had asked for his
appointment. “ I go,” said he to the Mission authorities, “as your Missionary;
depending upon you, and holding myself responsible to you for my conduct; and
not as the hired agent of the Colonists, of whom I know nothing.”— {Leigh's Life .
■p. 18.) This decision, his biographer maintains, prevented much subsequent
misunderstanding.
Leigh left Portsmouth on the 28th of February, 1815, on board The Hebe ,
which was to join the East and West Indian fleets. The voyage was not without
incident. Once vhey feared capture by a French vessel; another time they
imagined that an American cruiser was bearing down upon them ; while on a
third occasion a ship carrying Spanish colours seemed to be making all haste to
•overtake them. The se dangers did not disturb Leigh’s peace of mind. “ Sir,”


said he to the Captain on the first occasion, “ I am going to New South Wales
as a Missionary; and if Igo through a French prison, it is not of much conse-
quence to me.” More than the usual share of stormy weather was experienced.
One storm continued without intermission for nine days. “ All the live stock
perished, and almost everything on deck was swept away.” The sailors ex-
plained this to their entire satisfaction. They had a Jonah on board! One said
the devil was determined to stop Mr. Leigh’s attempts to convert the convicts;
hence the stormy weather. But notwithstanding these handicaps, The Hebe
safely entered Port Jackson on the 10th of August.
The following letter to the Secretaries gives some particulars of the voyage.
It was the first communication sent by Leigh after his departure.
“Near Madeira, March 30, 1815.
“ Dear Brethren, —
“ There being a conveyance from our vessel to Madeira, I seize the oppor-
tunity of sending you this letter. On Tuesday, February 28th, we sailed from
St. Helen’s ; the wind continuing fair for some time, we soon lost view of our
native country, but not without the feelings which such a circumstance naturally
excites. When we took our last view of England’s shores, all our wishes
appeared to be, that the blessing of God might rest upon all we had left behind.
Monday evening, March 6th, we were separated from the convoy by a gale of
wind. On Tuesday morning at daybreak, we saw two large vessels ; conceiving
them to be two American brigs, all hands were called on deck to prepare for
action ; but soon the cabin echoed with the news: ‘All is well; all is well.’ The
Captain judged them to be two Spanish vessels.
“Tuesday evening, the 7th instant, we were driven into the Bay of Biscay,
by a storm, which continued, more or less, till the 17th. After the storm had
ceased, the Captain assured us that, though he had been thirty years at sea,
he had never witnessed such a storm before ; and that he had thought several
times of throwing the guns, etc., overboard. All the passengers seemed thankful
to God for preserving their lives, and saving them from accidents. Not so much
as a rope failed in all the tempest; neither have we sustained any loss since we
left England, except our live stock, nearly all of which is destroyed by the water
coming on board ; of this, however, we think little.
“ With respect to my situation, I can say on board a ship, ‘ The lines have
fallen to me in pleasant places.’ When I first came on board things were in
a confused state, I judged it best to defer making any request to the Captain
on the subject of exercising my ministry, until more order should be established ;
but I noted in my book what I intended to ask him at the first proper opportunity.
This day, after I had made my memoranda, the Captain came into my cabin,
and requested me to oblige him by asking a blessing before, and returning thanks
after, our meals ; and to read prayers, and preach a sermon on Sabbath days.
I assured him that it would afford me great pleasure to do so, and at the same
time thanked him for his kind and obliging request. In a few days after, he


expressed a desire to have the children on board instructed in reading, etc., but
did not know how to accomplish this object; for he thought I should think it
too much trouble to attend to them. I assured him that whatever I could do
to render myself useful to the children, or to any others in the vessel, I should
attend to with the greatest pleasure ; he then put the children under my care.
“ The course which I pursue at present, is nearly as follows; lam always at
table to ask a blessing ; each morning at ten o’clock, I attend to the children,
read the Lessons and Psalms for the day ; 1 begin and conclude with prayer.
On Sabbath days, I read the Church prayers, and deliver a sermon, when circum-
stances will admit. On the other parts of the Sabbath the children read, and
endeavour to answer such questions as I propose to them ; and I can assure
you that I have experienced many blessings while thus engaged. I could not
help weeping for joy, after the Captain left my cabin, especially when I considered
that the things which he requested me to do were nearly those which I had
intended to ask permission, as a favour to undertake. I have, likewise, under
instruction, a young man, who is going with his parents to settle in New South
Wales. Every morning, except Sunday, he attends to the Latin Grammar, etc.,
and in the evening I give him a lesson in Geography in my little cabin, and con
elude with prayer. The manner in which, through Divine grace, I have been
enabled to conduct myself, has already gained the approbation of the passengers,
etc., and lam only in danger of being lifted up with pride. May the Lord keep
me humble.
“ Since I left London, I have been much exercised with respect to the New
South Wales Mission ; but when new difficulties have appeared before me, I
have thought that I heard a voice crying, ‘Goon ; the Lord is with thee: thy God
will protect thee.’ I have likewise thought, you had received letters from Sydney,
and other parts of the globe, intreating you to send more Missionaries ; that this
gave fresh vigour to your zeal; and that there are several young men full of faith
and of the Holy Ghost, who are crying: ‘ Here are we, send us’; and that nothing
appears to be wanting to accomplish your wish, and the prayers of many, but
money to fit those men for their voyage, etc. And, said I, shall this be wanting ?
If the highly favoured Methodists in England know that you want pecuniary
aid, they will, from the least to the greatest, contribute towards enabling you to
send the glorious news of salvation to perishing sinners. With respect to myself,
I am constrained to say: ‘ Goodness and mercy have followed me all my days.’ I
know that ‘ the Lord is ray portion ; ’ and that as long as I live to Him, I shall
not want. Dear Brethren, pray for me, that I may be brought in safety to
Sydney, my wished-for station.
“ I am yours, etc.,
“ Samuel Leigh.”
To this letter a few extracts from Leigh’s Journal may be added;
May 2nd. —The passengers begin to feel the inconvenience of the heat, and
to complain of the tediousness of the voyage. Lor the first time cards were
introduced. I walked the deck until my usual time for retiring to rest. Knowing


that a public reproof would be resented, I said, as I passed the card party to my
■cabin: “ Good night, ladies and gentlemen, I pray God to save us this night
from destruction.” This observation spoiled their game ; for they soon separated
and went to bed.
May 15. —I was not able to perform Divine Service last Lord’s Day, having
fallen from the deck on to the cabin floor. My arm was nearly broken, and 1
was much bruised. It was truly refreshing to see the mariners and passengers
■sitting in different parts of the ship reading the books and tracts which I had
from time to time distributed among them. Our boatswain and gunner have
certainly experienced the converting grace of God.
June Ist. —Being informed that one of the officers had borrowed the gunner s
Bible, I presented him with a copy, for which he seemed truly grateful. I also
offered one to the Captain, which he thankfully accepted, and assured me that
he would not only preserve it as' a memorial of our friendship, but also careful y
and frequently read it. O ! may it be the instrument of his salvation.
June 15th. —O, what a day has this been! The anticipated storm came on ,
and in a short time the sea ran mountains high. The gunner was ill, and received
orders to keep his bed ; but on hearing that the men were unable to take in the
main-sheet, he jumped up and ascended the shrouds to assist his comrades. The
■saddle of the main-yard gave way, and he, being weak, lost his hold and fell into
the sea. His strong jacket being open, he floated on the waves. We saw him
fall and the great gulls descending upon him, but though he remained above water
more than ten minutes, the state of the elements rendered it impossible for us
to save him. He had become truly pious, and I have no doubt of his salvation,
June 31st. —The children were examined, and gave much satisfaction. Such
as could read the Scriptures were presented with a Bible, and one shilling
in silver.
As showing the influence of Leigh during the voyage, a remark of the
Captain, who had been much addicted to the use of bad language, may be quoted
■« I have been at sea,” said he, “ for the last thirty years ; but no previous voyage
has yielded the gratification to my own mind that this has done.”

THE REV. WALTER LAWRY.
Second Wesleyan Missionary to Australia.


CHAPTER 11.
PIONEER WORK.
THERE are two names interwoven in the thread of early Methodist his-
tory in Australia. The first is that of Lachlan Macquarie, the fifth
Governor and Lieutenant-Colonel of the 73rd Regiment, whose term
dates from December, 1809, to December, 1821. The Rev. Samuel
Marsden, who became Senior Chaplain on the departure of the Rev. Richard
Johnson,, is the second. By their practical sympathy and wise counsel, their
generous support and sheltering care, they did much to assist the Missionaries
in the early stages of Methodism. These two men were both sub-
jected to severe criticism; while their work and the spirit in which
it was conducted provoked great variety of expression. But what-
ever they were to others, to the Methodist Missionaries they were loyal
friends. And however much opinions may differ on other matters there can
be no diversity of view on this point, that they rendered invaluable service to
the Methodist Church, a fact which will abundantly appear in what follows.
But for other reasons than those already named, Macquarie deserves special
mention. He was the great road-maker and builder of his day. During his
time the hitherto unconquerable Blue Mountains were crossed; and by the aid
of Government labour a good road to Bathurst was made. His exertions in
this respect,” says Dr. Lang, “ were above all praise.” Among his many public
deeds, not the least were the founding of agricultural, penal settlements at Emu
Plains and the Hastings ; the establishment of townships above flood mark at
Windsor, Richmond, Castlereagh, and Liverpool; the settlement of suitable per-
sons on the land ; the discovery of the Lachlan, Macquarie, blastings, Manning,
and Murrumbidgee Rivers, with their valuable lands , and the erection of public
buildings of an imposing character. Of the latter the most remarkable was the
famous “ rum hospital,” part of which stands to-day. 1 Like all the early Gover-
nors, Macquarie had many troubles, the major part of which arose through his
determination to promote the Emancipists to positions of influence and honour
equal to those held by their more fortunate neighbours. These efforts were
often strongly resented. “ Even my work of chanty ... a work which, con-
sidered either in a religious or a political point of view, I shall ever value as the
1 This Hospital was built by Messrs. D’Arcy, Blaxcell, and Riley in return for a con-
cession from the Colonial Government for four years. This gave them the right to pur-
chase and retail 15,000 gallons of ardent spirits yearly. One wing of this Hospital stood
where Parliament House now stands; another is the present Mint, and the site of the
third wing is occupied by the Sydney Infirmaiy.


most meritorious part of my administration, has not escaped their animadver-
sion,” he wrote. To see those who had recently suffered the penalty of crime or
misfortune sitting on the Justice’s Bench or pleading in a Court of law was to
make a demand on human nature to which it failed to respond. Notwithstand-
ing the many troubles which arose through Macquarie’s conception of duty, the
Colony made surprising progress. In the eleven years, from 1810 to 1821,
the population increased from 11,590 souls to 38,778, while cultivated land
rose from 7,615 acres to 32,267. The port duties advanced from £B,OOO per
annum to £30,000. Macquarie can be pardoned for the proud boast made on
his retirement: “ I found the Colony barely emerging from infantile imbecility,
and suffering from various privations and disabilities ; the country impenetrable
beyond forty miles from Sydney; agriculture in a yet languishing state ; com-
merce in its early dawn ; revenue unknown .... the morals of the great mass
of population in the lowest state of debasement, and religious worship almost
totally neglected. . . I left it .... in all respects enjoying a state of pri-
vate comfort and public prosperity, which, I trust, will at least equal the
expectation of His Majesty’s Government.—(Macquarie’s Report to the Earl of
Bathurst, 27th July, 1822.)
Of Samuel Marsden much could be written in praise of the great work he
did in the settlement of Australia and the civilisation of New Zealand. (See
Life, by Religious Tract Society.) Men widely differed in their estimate of
his work and character. Wentworth and Lang have not a good word for him.
Bonwick calls him “ the champion of the Church of England in Australia ” ;
whilst Wilberforce thought he deserved “ the title of a hero.” After their
disagreement over the Emancipists, Macquarie heaped ridicule upon Marsden,
and that brilliant, but cynical, critic, Sydney Smith, wrote of him as a “ little
merry, bustling Clergyman, largely concerned in the sale of rum, and brisk at
a bargain for barley.” The Rev. John Watsford, who, as a boy, heard him
preach frequently, writes:—“ We boys got to know some of his sermons almost
by heart, for he often repeated them, and there were two that we specially
looked out for: ‘David and the ewe lamb,’ and ‘ Onesimus.’ A grand old man
was the Colonial Chaplain. He exercised a great influence for good in those
early days of our history, and was much respected by everybody.”—( Glorious
Gospel Triumphs , p. 13.) This diversity of opinion may be explained by the
fact that Marsden was a man of marked individuality ; freely expressing opinions
to which he held with courage and tenacity of purpose ; and in the fur-
therance of which he was influenced by no feelings of soft indulgence. As a
Magistrate he hesitated not to administer justice with a promptness and vigour
which caused one unhappy culprit to make an addition to the Litany in the fol-
lowing form: —“Lord have mercy upon us, for his Reverence has none!” The
Rev. Richard Taylor tells the story of a man who was afflicted with an intem-
perate wife. At the request of the despairing husband the Chaplain interviewed
this lady, and at the close of his visit added force to argument by administering
a horsewhipping. This was a permanent cure. Take him all in all, Marsden
was a good man; loyal to his Church, broad in his sympathies, tolerant in his
views, and devoted to Missionary labours. His sympathy with Methodism
dates back to his youth, for in early life he was a member of the Wesleyan


Society at Leeds. I his apostolic man, finding that his own Church was not
prepared to respond to his numerous applications for Missionaries, encouraged
by every means within his power the agents of the London Missionary Society
on the one hand, and opened the way to New Zealand to the Wesleyans on the
other.—( Leigh's Life , p. 56.)
As an illustration of Marsden’s feelings towards the agents of the Wes-
leyan Church the following letter may be given here, though it properly belongs
to a later date. Ihe Chaplain, having rendered assistance to the cause at
Windsor, Messrs. Leigh and Lawry sent a joint letter of thanks, to which he
thus replied: On my return from Sydney your letter was delivered, in which
you express your acknowledgments for the donation of the ground at Windsor,
to build your Chapel and house upon. In reply to which, I can only say that
I feel much pleasure in having it m my power to meet your wishes in this
respect. T. o give you the right hand of fellowship is no more than my indis-
pensable duty, and, were I to throw the smallest difficulty in your way, I should
be highly criminal and unworthy the Christian name; more especially, con-
sidering the present existing circumstances of these extensive settlements, where
the harvest is so great and the labourers are so few; the number of Clergymen
belonging to the Establishment, when compared with the wants of the people,
and their labours, are in a great measure confined and local. I am fully per-
suaded that your ministerial labours among the Colonists and their servants
will tend to promote the general welfare of these settlements, as well as the
eternal interests of immortal souls. You may rely with confidence upon my
continual support and co-operation in all your laudable attempts to benefit the
inhabitants of this populous Colony.
“ The importation of convicts from Europe is very great every year; hun-
dreds have just landed on our shores from various parts of the British Empire ;
hundreds are now in the harbour ready to be disembarked ; and hundreds more
on the bosom of the great deep, and hourly expected. These exiles come to
us laden with the chains of their sins and reduced to the lowest state of human
wretchedness and depravity; their number and vices are continually adding to
the great mass of moral corruption, and call loudly upon all, who are able, to
use every exertion to communicate moral and religious instruction. We must
not expect that governors, magistrates, and politicians, can find a remedy for
the dreadful moral diseases with which the convicts are infected. The plague
of sin, when it has been permitted to operate upon the human mind, with all
its violence and poison, can never be cured, and seldom restrained, by the wisest
human laws and regulations that legislators can frame. Heaven itself has pro-
vided the only remedy for the cure of the plague of sin, the blessed balm in
Gilead; to apply any other remedy will be lost labour. In recommending this
at all times and in all places we shall prevail upon some to try its effects ; and
whoever do this we know they will be healed in the self-same hour. I pray
that the Divine blessing may attend all your labours for the good of immortal
souls in these settlements. I am often struck with astonishment when I
reflect upon the mysteries of Divine goodness that the Father of mercies should
accompany with His gospel, the very outcasts of the human race, to the ends of


the earth ; no doubt His gracious designs are to bless some of these unhappy
victims of vice and sin, for their father’s sake, as many of them are known to
have pious parents. This consideration affords much encouragement, though
the times are dark and the overflowing of ungodliness makes us afraid ; we
must expect great difficulties in a place where sin and Satan have obtained such
universal sovereignty, where his kingdom appears to be firmly established, and
where his subjects are unitedly devoted to his interests ; however, let us go on
and sound the ram’s horns ; the walls of Jericho will fall in time. We are
feeble, but the Lord is mighty, and will make His power known, and bring His
Israel out of captivity to the new Jerusalem which is above.” 2
Finding himself at his desired haven, Leigh immediately prepared for
work. His first night was spent in the home of Mr. Edward Eagrar, in
O’Connell Street. A stranger in a strange land, he was depressed and lonely;
and the night was largely spent in meditation and prayer. With Mr. Eagar as
guide he waited upon His Excellency Governor Macquarie on the morning of
the nth August, 1815. A lengthy conversation took place, when the Governor
expressed his regret that Mr. Leigh had come as a Wesleyan Missionary. A
religious rebellion, aggravated by the bitter hostility of Papists to Protestants,
had recently taken place, and to avoid a repetition of such an unseemly exhibi-
tion great caution was necessary. Would he not take office under Govern-
ment? He would be much more comfortable, and might become rich! To this
suggestion he turned a deaf ear, and proceeded to explain the objects of his
Mission and the means he intended to employ. The Governor replied: “If
those be your objects, they are certainly of the first importance ; and if you will
endeavour to compass them by the means you have now specified, I cannot but
wish you all the success you can reasonably expect or desire. Call at the Sur-
veyor-General’s Office, present my compliments, and say that I wish him to
afford you every facility in his power in travelling from one township to an-
other.”—(Leigh's Life , p. 34.) In his official report Leigh states simply: “My
business was to acquaint His Excellency with my Mission, and by whom I was
sent. His Excellency said: ‘lt is of no importance by what name we may be
called, if we are but sincere in our profession. I believe your intentions are
good, and therefore you may expect from me every encouragement you desire ;
and 1 wish you the same success in your Mission you wish for yourself.’ When
our conversation ended His Excellency requested Mr. Eagar to give me such
information of the Colony as was necessary, that I might arrange my plan of
proceeding through the different settlements as I judge best. He also gave
me much advice. I thanked His Excellency for his great kindness, and re-
turned to my lodgings not a little impressed with a sense of the goodness of
2 If further proof of the esteem in which Marsden was held were called for it could
be found in the fact that when about to visit England an address was presented to him
signed by 302 persons, including the principal inhabitants of the settlements at the
Hawkesbury River, Nepean, and Portland Head, and the “ adjacent parts of the Colony
of New South Wales.” In this address Marsden is thanked for his “pious, humane, and
exemplary conduct in the various and arduous situations in and throughout the whole
Colony, as a minister of the Gospel, superintending magistrate, inspector of public orphan
and charity schools, and other necessary offices. Your sanctity,” the address adds,
“philanthropy, and disinterested character, will ever remain an example to future
ministers.”

FROM THE LOG OF MR. THOMAS BOWDEN.


God to me in a strange land. I know you all say, Amen. ‘ Bless the Lord, O
my soul, and forget not all His benefits. Bless the Lord, Omy Soul!’ ” This
duty performed one other remained. Leigh took the first opportunity of calling
upon the Anglican Clergy, Messrs. Marsden, Cowper, Cartwright, and Fulton.
He reports that from these gentlemen he received “ the treatment of friends
and Ministers of Jesus Christ; and can say, from my knowledge of them, that
they are men of God, and strive to reclaim the outcasts of Israel. May Jehovah
crown their labours with great success!”
The Missionary now turned his attention to the little Society, which,
through Messrs. Bowden and Hosking, had made their appeal for Missionaries.
They had first met in fellowship on the 6th March, 1812, from which time
Methodism dates its foundation in Australasia. 3 Leigh sorrowfully reports: “I
was grieved to find that Satan had entered among them, and had scattered the
feeble few. But, thank God, I found one Class, consisting of six persons, who
have since continued to meet, and I hope that the fear of the Lord is among
them of a truth, and that they will show forth His praise continually.” On
the 24th August he met a few persons who professed a regard for Methodism.
To them the rules of the Society were explained, and two Classes were formed
of six members each. Soon after three other Classes were established at
Parramatta, Windsor, and Castlereagh, with a total membership of 44.
The Sydney place of meeting was in the district known as “ The Rocks,”
not far from the spot where Phillip formed his first settlement. A house had
been secured at a rental of £l5 per annum. The partition walls were removed,
and it was fitted up for worship. Here they met at six o’clock in the morning,
and again at six in the evening for prayer and exhortation. In this cottage,
capable, says Leigh, of seating 200 people, they continued to meet until Mi
Scott’s liberality enabled them to worship in their new Chapel. The house was
“ generally crowded with attentive hearers. We have preaching every Lord’s
Day, and Wednesday evenings ; and also Prayer meetings on Sabbath morn-
ings and Monday evenings, which are well attended.” A regular Circuit was
formed, Leaders appointed, and Quarterly Meetings established. “ Indeed,
we possess every means of grace with which the Methodists are so highly
privileged.” They could boast likewise of a Steward, one Local Preacher, and
an Exhorter. The Sunday School was reorganised and placed upon an im-
proved basis, with satisfactory results in point of attendance. The blessing of
God rested upon this Institution in a remarkable degree. Through its agencv
Leigh became associated with the parents and some earnest workers. The
congregation was regular and settled, and as the Spirit of God moved among
the people helpers were raised up.
In this district there was ample scope for their united efforts. An eye
witness thus describes the notorious spot: —“ My guide had brought me this
way to point out to me another of the low life sections of Sydney; in fact, its
St. Giles’s and Wapping in one. From the earliest times of the settlement
a Whether the honour of first finding a home for the Wesleyan Church belongs to
Windsor or to Sydney has been disputed. It is maintained that the Class led by Mr.
Eagar at Windsor was in existence some time before that which met at the Rocks.


there congregated on the steep ridge above the King’s wharf all the worst
characters of this penal Colony—the felon, whose ill-directed punishment had
only rendered him more obdurate, cunning, and slothful; the prostitute, who
(if such a thing can be), had sunk yet lower; the fence , watching for a liveli-
hood, by plundering the plunderer ; many who, without great positive vices, a
sort of brute-like ignorance and uncouthness had rendered it impossible for
more orderly and rational society to amalgamate with itself, and many drawn
into the vortex of ruin through their mere want of direction, or energetic resolve
for either good or evil.” — ( The Gleaner , vol. 1., pp. 144-5.)
In picturing that first Quarterly Meeting the imagination has a fine field
before it. Suffice it, however, to say that the place of meeting was the reno-
vated house, pronounced inconvenient and not beautiful for situation. The
members were the pioneer Missionary, the Rev. Samuel Leigh; the pioneer
Class Leaders, Messrs Eagar, Bowden, Hosking, and Scott ; and Mr. Norman,
whose official position does not appear. The honour of being Circuit Steward
fell upon Mr. Edward Eagar, and if carefully kept accounts and liberal dona-
tions frequently given be any qualifications for such an office then Mr. Eagar
must have made a capable Steward. Their first difficulty was one arising
through a clerical error. The Missionary Committee understood the writers of
the appeal to ask for furniture for a horse, whereas they had suggested that
house furniture be sent. Mr. Leigh, therefore, arrived with a military saddle,
for which the officials found use by purchasing a horse at a cost of £25. In
the absence of furniture Leigh found a temporary home with Mr. Bowden.
The second difficulty was a purely financial one. It was thought that Leigh’s
salary had been provided for by the investment of a sum in horned cattle, which
by natural increase, it was hoped, would prove a source of perennial income.
But how vain was this hope! If the sum referred to had been invested, it
could not have been invested wisely. Or, if the investment were sound, misfor-
tune must have seized the flock so that it perished ; or, with that perversity
characteristic of cattle in those early days, they must have strayed into the bush,
assisted in their wanderings, it may be, by some kindly but covetous hand. Be
that as it may, the cattle had disappeared ; and Mr. Eagar found himself with
a deficiency of £3O! This was their Rubicon; but, like the generous men
they were, their liberality conquered. Mr. Scott gave £s, while Messrs. Eagar,
Bowden, Hosking, and Norman shared’ the balance, amounting to £6 i/s. 2jd.
each. Thus was the Steward enabled to present his balance-sheet, which was
duly adopted, signed by the Chairman, and is reproduced on account of
its historic value. It was the first balance-sheet prepared in the Southern
Hemisphere.
Other friends afterwards became generous contributors to the Mission
funds. For example, the names of Mr. Hargraves and Mr. Geo. Hughes appear
in the next balance-sheet, while in September, 1816, Mr. Charles Clark’s Class
at Castlereagh remits a sum, and Mr. Thomas Jones gives £5. Windsor Class
first contributes in January, 1817, and three months later the sum of £6 12s. 6d.
comes from the same source. Two suggestive items recorded still later are
the sum of £1 10s. od. from the soldier’s Class at Parramatta, and £5 14s. od.


•J Quarterly Ticket for J>eeemb&> 18$$.' *J /' SS%
from John Lees, of Castlereagh, who had cultivated a piece of land, sold the
wheat produced, and forwarded the amount to the Mission funds. Some of
these first subscribers afterwards disappear; but others take their place,
Messrs. Forbes, Hynes, Josephson, and Hunt being among the number. Not-
withstanding this liberal support, at the June quarter of 1818, Mr. Eagar found
himself with a deficiency of £157. But then Mr. Lawry had arrived, for whom
a horse had been purchased at a cost of £2O. The Missionaries’ allowances
were £lO as quarterage, with board, washing, fuel, postage, stationery, travelling
expenses, and furniture provided.
Among Leigh’s coadjutors were some who claim more than passing no-
tice. Prominent in the number was Sergeant James Scott. Scott, who had
been a soldier in the West Indies, was there converted to God, and joined the
Wesleyan Church. The detachment to which he belonged being ordered to
New South Wales, he became distinguished for his probity and strength of
character, while acting as a non-commissioned officer. Being advanced in life
he desired to retire upon his pension ; but that was impossible unless he re-
turned to England. His case being referred to the Governor, who had formed
a high opinion of Scott, a clerkship in the Commissariat Department was
offered to and accepted by him. While holding this position a dissatisfied
magistrate sought to inspect Scott’s books to gain information to be used to
the Governor’s injury. To this Scott refused to be a party. The matter
being reported to His Excellency he was so favourably impressed with Scott’s
integrity that he promoted him to an official position. Joining the Society at
“ The Rocks,” he opened his house for week-night services, occasionally taking


the pulpit himself. About this time a property in Princes Street, consisting of
several houses, being for sale, Scott became the purchaser. Part of this pro-
perty he laid out as a garden, the remainder he sold to the Missionary Society
for £3OO. These premises were so altered as to provide a residence for the
Missionary and a house in which to transact Mission business. The congrega-
tion at the temporary Chapel increasing, it became necessary to provide a more
convenient place of worship. Having sold his part of the estate, Scott said to-
Mr. Leigh: “ I intend, God willing, to build a Chapel upon my garden ground,
and give it to the Mission. I feel this to be a duty which I owe to Divine Pro-
vidence.” This generous inspiration was soon put into effect, and the building
of the Chapel was proceeded with. Scott laid the foundation stone, and bore
the entire cost, five hundred guineas, securing the exclusive right of occupation
to the Mission and its agents. The deed of this Chapel afterwards became
the Model Deed of Church property in Australia.
The opening of this Chapel was an event of no small moment to the
Society; as it gave to them status and a home. The opening ceremony took
place on the Sunday preceding the 17th March, 1819, when Leigh preached in
the old cottage in the morning, and the Rev. Walter Lawry in the new building
at night. Mr. Lawry’s text was appropriate, and doubtless the sermon was
good; though it is not on record. The text was: “He loveth our nation, and
hath built us a synagogue.” In his private Journal, Leigh thus writes of this
interesting event; —“ The congregations were large and attentive. I cannot
express what I felt during the evening service, as I looked round upon the
audience and reflected on the wonderful change that had taken place since I
first preached in Sydney ‘ Rocks.’ I was lost in wonder, love, and praise!” His
report to the Committee states: “On Sunday last, at nine o’clock in the morn-
ing, I preached a sermon to our congregation in our old place of worship, and
we left it with thankful hearts. In the evening Brother Lawry opened the
new Chapel, and, I am happy to say, that we had a large congregation. I can-
not express what I felt during the service. A neat Chapel that will accommo-
date 200 people, built and given to the Methodist Mission in this place free of
expense ; a large and attentive congregation assembled to hear what the Lord
would say to them by His Minister, and a zealous Brother !to assist me in the
preaching of a free and full salvation.”- —(. Methodist Magazine , 1819.) “ May
we not ask,” says Strachan, “ what are all the magnificent structures which the
wealth and gratitude of the British people have reared when compared with
this house of prayer? When the monuments that record them shall have been
reduced to their original form it will be said of this unpretending edifice that
this man has been born there.” The building, which was of dressed stone,
presented a neat appearance, and did good service till November, 1836, when
it was enlarged by an addition of 20 feet, and an elevation of the roof. 4 In
the Chapel he had built, and in which he delighted to worship. James Scott, or
“ Daddy Scott,” as he was popularly called in his old age, worked for many
years. He subsequently met his death by being thrown from a horse when

returning from a preaching appointment, on Sunday, December Qth, 1832. He
died in three hours, at 4 o’clock in the afternoon, and was buried by the Rev.
Joseph Orton, who was then in Sydney.
Edward Eagar, an Irishman by birth and a barrister by education, was
another of Leigh’s valuable assistants. Arriving in Sydney when quite a
youth, he made his home at Windsor, where he taught a school during the
week and on the Lord’s day went into the neighbouring villages to read the
Liturgy and explain the Word of God. Here he formed six members into a
Class, which first met in the year 1812, the precise date not being known.
While in Windsor Mr. Eagar was much, and deservedly, respected, being in-
telligent, consistent, zealous, and humble. Before Leigh’s arrival he removed
to Sydney, where he married and settled successfully in business in O’Connell
Street. When at a later stage Macquarie Street Chapel was built he lent the
Trustees £I,OOO to enable them to proceed with the work. The General Com-
mittee strongly disapproved of this loan, and censured the Missionaries for
contracting it. It objected to be made responsible for a liability as to the ex-
pediency to which it had not been consulted, d his, however, does not detract
from the generosity of the man who found the money. Eagar also drew up a
plan for the establishment of a Mission to the Aborigines ; which, though the
Committee considered, it did not adopt, as all its schemes for the reclamation of
these unfortunate creatures came to nought. And in many other quiet and
unobtrusive ways Eagar rendered valuable assistance to the Mission when help
was most urgently required. In the year 1821 Mr. Eagar and Mr. Redfern were
appointed delegates, and sent to England to set before the Imperial Authori-
ties a grievance under which many of the Colonials then suffered. Mr. Eagar
did not return to report progress.
Hr. Thomas Bowden was sent from London by the English Government,
at the request of the Rev. Samuel Marsden, through the influence of Wilberforce
and Butterworth, to take charge of the Government School, arriving in Sydney
January 28th, 1812. He had previously been in charge of the large free school
connected with the Methodist Chapel, Queen Street, London. Born in Devon-
shire, he came of Puritan stock. From the year 1600 Bowdens filled the Non-
conformist Chapels in Devon or Somerset, and as pastors they were remark-
able for their Whig politics and strong attachment to the Hanoverian succes-
sion. Mr. Bowden was possessed of considerable mathematical and mechanical
talent, in addition to his piety and loyal attachment to the Methodist Church.
He was placed in charge of the Male Orphan Institution, the aims of which are
thus set forth in The Sydney Gazette , January Bth, 1824;—“ The object of this
Institution is not to educate the youth for the polite circle, but to afford them
trades and to inculcate those moral feelings in the common rudiments of
instruction that cannot fail of rendering them honest and trustful members of
Society.” The public examination made by the Governor afforded him much
pleasure, “ while it reflected no small degree of credit on Mr. Bowden, the Mas-
ter, who is well entitled to this tribute of commendation as a reward for his
unremitting zeal and continued labour in the discharge of so important a trust
as that with which he has the happiness to be honoured.” Mr. Bowden died at

PORTION OF MR. THOMAS BOWDENS REPORT ON THE
ESTABLISHMENT OF A MALE ORPPIANAGE.


“ Dunholie,” Singleton, the residence of his son-in-law, after a short but severe
illness, on the 13th September, 1834, in the 56th year of his age. His tomb-
stone bears the following inscription: “He arrived in this colony in January,
1812, and for seven years was Headmaster of the first Public School in .Sydney.
In January, 1819, he organised the Male Orphan Institution (which situation he
came from England on purpose to fill), and superintended the same upwards of
six years, when he retired into private life, respected by all who knew him,
having spent 20 years in the education of youth. In the full enjoyment of
health, a fit of apoplexy suddenly summoned him into Eternity. Oh, Reader!
for all thou knowest such an end awaiteth thee, therefore ‘ Prepare to meet
thy God.’ ” This Institution was shortly afterwards removed to the house that
had been prepared for it in the country.
This will be a fitting stage at which to insert the address forwarded by
these four officials to the General Committee: —
ADDRESS OF THE METHODIST SOCIETIES IN NEW SOUTH
WALES TO THE COMMITTEE.
Sydney, March 2nd, 1816.
“ On the 10th August last, the ship Hebe arrived at this Port, and by her
we had the unspeakable pleasure of receiving our highly respected Brother, the
Rev. S. Leigh, bearing your letter of the 18th January, 1815. With great
anxiety we had been expecting and praying for his arrival; and now we take
the earliest opportunity of offering you our most grateful acknowledgments for
your ready compliance with our request. We desire to bless God that He has
inclined the heart of His servant to come unto us ; that He has inclined your
hearts to send him ; and that He has disposed the heart of our fellow Christians
to contribute so liberally towards the furtherance of the great object you have
in view; so that what but a few years since we scarcely ever expected to see,
has already gladdened our hearts, the everlasting Gospel proclaimed to us by a
Methodist Missionary. Our prayer to God our Saviour is, that grace, mercy,
and peace, may be multiplied unto you, from God our Father and the Lord
Jesus Christ; that you may abound in every Gospel blessing, and a rich and
abundant supply of the Spirit; and that from you, as His instruments, the Word
of the Lord may be sounded out, not only in every part of our native land, but
through every Island and Continent in the world.
‘ Till all mankind shall learn His name,
Shall all stretch out their hands to Him.’
“ As Mr. Leigh writes by this opportunity, we shall only say that we have
great cause to bless God, that on his arrival his way was providentially and
wonderfully opened. He was kindly received by our excellent Governor,
General Macquarie, as well as by the Rev. Chaplains of the Colony, who wel-
comed him with the right hand of fellowship. Many doors have been opened
for preaching the Gospel, and, blessed be God, it has not been preached in vain.
Here is abundant work for another Preacher; and it is probable a Preacher
could not be so usefully employed in any part of the world. But we are under
the painful necessity of stating that our present circumstances will not enable us


PRINCES STREET CHURCH AND PARSONAGE.
to support two Preachers unassisted by the Committee. But in pursuance of our
former engagements, we are determined, by the help of God, that Mr. Leigh
shall be no further expense to you ; but at present we cannot do much more.
Our members in Society are as yet but few ; our temporal circumstances not at
all opulent; and our expenses at present fall on a few individuals.
“ We have been for some time considering how to obtain funds to erect a
Chapel in this town. Our present place of worship is a rented house, not very
commodious, nor very convenient for situation. A Chapel is very much wanted ;
and we do not expect any great increase to our Society until we have one. We
have already the offer of a piece of ground in a central situation ; and we could
procure subscriptions to the amount of £2OO and upwards. But this sum would
fall very far short of meeting the expense ; building expenses and labour bear-
ing a very high proportion to the prices in England. We are also
endeavouring to build two Chapels in the country, namely, one at
Windsor, 35 miles from Sydney, and one at Castlereagh, 14 miles further;
places where considerable congregations attend, but at present are indifferently
accommodated. The expense of both Chapels, exclusive of subscriptions,
will be about £2OO. And what adds to our difficulties, and which, we
trust, will recommend us to your notice, is the total impossibility of borrowing
money in this Colony on any interest or security whatever.”
After enlarging on their difficulties, and suggesting to the Committee a
plan for assisting them, the address proceeds; —
“ Thus, honoured Fathers, have we endeavoured to convey to you a cor-
rect idea of our present state and circumstances. The means within our own
reach are very inadequate to the great end we have in view ; but, blessed be


God, your former liberality has encouraged us to look again to the same source.
Our former petition was granted with that promptitude which evinced the great
concern you felt for our spiritual interests. In the choice of our present Minis-
ter, the directing and over-ruling hand of a particular Providence evidently
appears, being an instrument well adapted to accomplish the ends you proposed.
And in His hands we have no doubt but the work of God will prosper, aided by
your prayers. But the field is too extensive, and the work too laborious, for
one. More help is indispensably necessary, or he will probably sink under the
burden, which he need not do while God is kindling such a Missionary flame in
the hearts of our countrymen, that we are persuaded many are ready to come
forward, crying, ‘ HERE ARE WE; SEND US. And may we not presume to
hope that our fellow Christians of both sexes, while they are so liberally con-
tributing to send the Gospel to the poor negroes of Africa, and to the wretched
devotees of Indian deities, will not withhold that Gospel from the outcasts of
New South Wales? Allow us to say, ours is a pressing and peculiar case ; many
among us formerly held a respectable rank in Society ; we left friends and con-
nections, and better prospects in life, to come and settle in a benighted land,
and from a long residence in the interior, many miles from a village or town,
have been cut off from the means of grace and the offers of salvation which
you so richly enjoy, and which we once loved and valued. But now, many of
us have not heard a sermon for years together, till the arrival of your faithful
and zealous Missionary, the Rev. S. Leigh. No wonder we are sunk in ignor-
ance, and our children brought up in a state little superior to that of the beasts
that perish.
“Not a few residing here are, through the long indulgence of criminal pas-
sions, and sinful habits, sunk into a state worse than heathenism, being, as it
were, twice dead. And some, who in an evil hour, have given way to the force
of momentary temptation, have involved themselves and their innocent, and,
till then, respectable families in wretchedness and disgrace; but the Royal
clemency having been extended towards them, they have repented, and again
turned to that God who delighteth to show mercy. Are not such characters
peculiarly entitled to pity and benevolence ? And what boon can you give them
which is so well adapted to their miserable case as that Gospel whose peculiar
property is, ‘ to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captive,
and the opening of the prison doors to them that are bound ’; and, as our poet
beautifully expresses it,
‘ To raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
To heal the sick, and lead the blind.’
“ You will pardon us when we say we have a claim on your notice by the
ties of CONSANGUINITY. We are BONE of your BONE, and FLESH of your
FLESH. There is scarcely a city, or town, or village in the British Empire
wherein we cannot claim a relative; either a father or a brother, or a wife ; and
what cause or causes soever have contributed to banish us from the happiest
and most highly favoured land under Ileaven ; yet, oh! deprive us not of those
bright beams of the Gospel which have cheered your hearts under troubles
and difficulties less in weight and magnitude than those we have had to
struggle with.


“ have pointed out the method, and. we believe, the only practicable
method, by which help can be afforded. Extraordinary cases require extraordin-
ary means and exertions, and as we are assured the liberality of our British
Brethren will provide you with ample means ; so we trust that your former act
of benevolence will be only exceeded by this, and the event will certainly be
glorious. New Holland, the largest Island in the world, which less than 50
years ago knew not an European, and whose Aborigines were the most bar-
barous and most uncivilised of any savage tribe ever discovered, and whose
recent Colonists are truly the filth and off-scouring of men ; yet even New Hol-
land, through the zeal and benevolence of her parent country, will soon rear
three Methodist Chapels in addition to the four Churches of the Establisment
she already possesses. But the good effects ot your benevolence will not end
here. This will be only the droppings preceding the shower. Other Islands m
this great sea will soon be received under your fostering wing. NEW SOUTH
WALES will soon become a station for young Missionaries. Its climate is con-
genial to a British constitution, and will afford them an Asylum from the
directer rays of a tropical sun, when worn down with fatigue and disease.
Ethiopia and India are already stretching out their hands to the true God, and
very soon may the long-expected period arrive, when the earth shall be ... .
o’erflowed, and the universe fill’d with the glory of God!
“We beg leave to subscribe ourselves, Honoured and Reverend Fathers,
your very affectionate children and servants, in the Gospel of our Lord Jesus
Christ,
EDWARD EAGAR, 5 Steward.

Matters now being in a promising state at “ The Rocks,” Leigh felt that
the way was open for a visit to the country. Being provided with a good horse,
which was nicknamed “ Old Traveller,” he started on his lonely trip. Influenced
in his choice of districts by the wish of a Sydney friend, he decided to visit
Castlereagh, being armed with a letter of introduction to a farmer, who was a
Staffordshire man. This fact, it was thought, would ensure to the Missionary
an open door and a hearty welcome. But it produced neither. A long day’s
ride brought him to the spot he sought. Introducing himself as a Wesleyan
Missionary he asked permission to preach. This reasonable request met with
a flat refusal; and, what was worse, his fellow countryman would not even
accommodate him for the night. But he did so far unbend as to direct him to
the house of another farmer who dwelt two miles distant, and was known to
be a reader of the Bible, which, we venture to presume, the churlish farmer was
not. But how mysterious are the ways of God! By means of this blunt refusal
Leigh was being guided to a house in which dwelt one who had long prayed
for the visit of a Missionary, and was even then waiting to give him the warmest
5 Mr. Eagar’s name is misspelt in this document. The secretaries also make an error
in the name of the Rev. William Cowper, whom they frequently called Cooper. Strachan
follows their example. His book is strewn with inaccuracies of this kind.

of welcomes. This was John Lees, the farmer, whose memory will always be
precious, and whose generous deeds are inseparable from the story of early
Methodism.
Knocking at the door of this house, Leigh called out: “ Will you receive a
Wesleyan Missionary ?” The door was at once opened by a “ little stiff, ruddy
lad Mr. Lees’ son, Robert, —who, seizing the bridle in one hand and the
stirrup in the other, said: “ Get off, Sir! My father will be glad to see you.”
Entering the house Leigh found a small company seated round a three-legged
table, on which lay books in preparation for family worship. “ Perhaps you
will have no objection to take this duty off my hands,” were John Lees’ first
words. Opening the bible the Missionary read the well-known prophecy, after-
wards to be fulfilled in that spot: “ The wilderness and the solitary place shall
be glad for them ; and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose. It shall
blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and singing; the glory of
Lebanon shall be given unto it, the excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they
shall see the glory of the Lord, and the excellency of our God!”—(lsa. xxxv., 1-2.)
The feelings called forth by these words soon choked the Missionary’s utterance,
and, overcome by emotion, he gave way to tears of joy, in which he was joined
by others. That memorable evening was the forerunner of many other bles-
sings which God sent upon this humble people. On rising from his knees the
farmer seized Leigh’s hand with an iron grip and exclaimed; “We have been
praying for three years that God would send us a Missionary ; now that you are
come we are right glad to see you. We had not even heard of your arrival in
the Colony.” It is not surprising to learn that on retiring they said they had
seen strange things that day!
The reader will perhaps ask; Who was John Lees and how came he there?
John Lees had been a soldier in the New South Wales Corps. On his retire-
ment he could return to England or claim a grant of land. He chose the latter,
and made his home at Castlereagh, near the Nepean River, lying at the base of
the Blue Mountains. Here he married and reared a numerous family. As a
soldier he had contracted habits from which the grace of God set him free.
His conversion was brought about by an apparent accident. Stepping out one
night for a log of wood, he accidentally grasped a snake, which instantly bit
him on the wrist. Seized with violent alarm he hastened to Windsor to seek
relief. On entering the house of the Rev. R. Cartwright, the Anglican Clergy-
man, he fell fainting to the ground. Medical aid and a gracious Providence
saved him from death. The event led to his conversion. Old things at once
passed away, and all things became new. Henceforth he became just and de-
vout, and the Holy Ghost was upon him. 6 That godliness is profitable in all
things soon became apparent. “ Mr. Lees not only entertained the Minister,”
says Mr. James Rutledge, “ but became pre-eminent in his zeal in the cause of
God, (in his) liberality and scrupulous conduct in the government of his family,
and in the strict observance of the Sabbath .... (he) not only scorned
the contempt of the proud and disregarded the scoff of the low, and vulgar, and
6 Leigh’s Biographer gives a different version of this conversion. But 1 have repro-
duced that narrated by the Rev. Benjamin Carvosso, who knew Lees well, and probably
heard the story from his lips. (See The Christian Advocate, vol. i., p. 157.)


wicked, he proceeded to acts that excited the admiration of all others that knew
him.”—( Methodist , May 20th, 1899.) He was distinguished for his piety and
power in prayer. A poor woman living in the district found delight in per-
secuting her husband for righteousness’ sake. One day, while reading his
Bible, she threw it on the floor. Retiring to the garden to meditate on this
strange act, he was recalled by one of the children. “ Mother’s crying so,” said
the child, “ Come, father, and see her.” Finding his wife weeping because of a
sentence which had caught her eye, he said: “ Come away to John Lees,” and,
“ taking a child under each arm, he led his wife, without shawl or bonnet, crying
as she went to John Lees, and there, very soon, while prayer was being offered,
the peace and blessing of God came into her soul.” —( Glorious Gospel
Triumphs , p. 27.)
Of the simplicity and fervent piety of this man Mr. Carvosso gives several
instances: “ I had left the Chapel,” he says, “in company with my good friend,
and we walked homeward in silence. Our souls had been greatly refreshed.
We were happy. John, mostly talkative on ordinary occasions, had scarcely
uttered a word since we left the house of prayer. There was no sound float-
ing on the soft breeze that gently wafted over the lofty evergreens, embosoming
the cultivated patches. It was a beautiful, serene Australian evening. At last
the solemn silence was broken. In a firm and devout tone of voice John said:
‘ I have been praying, Sir, for grace to bear the trial of this blessing.’ ” “On
another memorable occasion,” proceeds Mr. Carvosso, “ returning from the same
house of prayer in the wood, and passing together in the same direction and
over the same spot of ground, one other striking sentence was uttered by my
devout friend. It was the season of harvest. John had reaped his wheat. It
stood in shocks around us. The weather was very unfavourable. Rain had
been almost incessantly descending for several days preceding. The corn was
at the point of sprouting in the sheaf, and being greatly damaged ; and the
heavens were yet hung with the black and threatening clouds .... I used
a common sort of phraseology, indicating that it was now bad weather for the
harvest. At the sound of bad weather from my lips, he appeared moved in an
extraordinary manner. Instantly standing still in the midst of his dripping,
discoloured sheaves, feeling for the honour of his God, as the God of the
weather, he looked at me with mingled seriousness and astonishment, and, with
a kind of frown on his countenance, said in an air of authority: ‘ I think, Sir,,
the weather will always be right.’ The next day, by a sudden change, the
weather proving very fine, the heat from the sun from the bright heavens quickly
drying the wheat, and John carrying it into his barn, comparatively uninjured, I
was left to meditate on the lesson of ‘ instruction in righteousness ’ which I had
received.” —■( The Christian Advocate , vol. 1, p. 158.)
But the most remarkable deed in a life of more than ordinary interest was
the building of the first Methodist Chapel in Australia, 7 erected entirely at Mr.
7 lt has been questioned whether this was the first Chapel erected in Australia.
Having gone thoroughly into the matter I have no hesitation in saving that John Lees’
Chapel was the first Wesleyan Chapel in the Southern World. The'difference of opinion
arises thus: The old Chapel now standing at Castlereagh was the first Chapel built on
the acre of land given to the Mission by John Lees, and cultivated for the benefit of the
Mission. But this was erected when John Lees’ Chapel across the lagoon was demolished.
The Rev. John Pemell writes: “ 1 was the last who preached in that little old place in the
bush. The floor of the pulpit had rotted away, and I stood with my feet resting on the
two flooring joists.” Mr. Pemell, who was very nervous as a young man, also adds that
he requested Mrs. Gorman to arrange for the babies to be baptised when the Rev. W.
Schofield visited the Chapel. Mrs. Gorman, wdio had a sense of humour arranged for
five babies to be baptised during Mr. Pemell’s next visit. After that experience he
made no further requests.

Lees’ expense, and for the exclusive use of the Wesleyan Missionaries. The
opening ceremonies of this primitive but historic building are thus recorded by
Mr. Leigh: “On the yth of October, 1817, I opened a Chapel at Castlereagh,
built and given to the Mission by Mr. John Lees. While I stood and looked at
the people coming in carts from various quarters of remote distances, I was re-
minded of the Scriptural figure of ‘ doves flying to their windows,’ and of the
American camp meetings, dhe place was soon filled with attentive hearers. I
addressed them from ‘ The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are
glad.’ The people were not willing to leave the place. In the evening we held
a prayer-meeting in the Chapel to plead with God for the prosperity of His
cause, especially in that place. It was at this time I wished for your and my
Brethren’s presence, to join us in humbling ourselves before God, and in praising
Him for the great things He hath done for us in New South Wales. Yes, Sir,
my thoughts flew 14,000 miles in a moment, and recollected the happy seasons
I had spent in England, and was constrained to say: ‘Truly, Jacob’s God is
here.’ Are not these the beginning of good days ? And, be assured, if you will
send us more Missionaries, you shall see greater things than these.”
This Chapel was a substantial building of weatherboards, and it stood
surrounded by Methodist homes for many years, until it gave place to a larger
building. On the door of this primitive building were painted the words:
METHODIST CHAPEL, and below them, PREPARE TO MEET THY
GOD. It is said that Mr. James Burns, for many years a successful Class


leader, was convinced of sin by reading that text. “ There is something roman-
tic in the approach to the little Chapel. We have first to sail over a little
stream, and then to walk through the cornfields, which are covered with plenty.
Before you, the fruitful fields are bounded by deep, umbrageous forests, and
those again by the Blue Mountains, whose rugged and solemn brows stretch
away on either hand beyond the trace of the eye. In the midst of this interesting
scene stands the humble temple of our God, inviting our steps to its peaceful
seclusion, and our hearts to adore the Maker of all.”—/(Rev. R. Mansfield.)
Before the opening services were brought to a close John Lees gave
additional proof of his deep gratitude to God. This noble-hearted man said:
“ I have not yet done my duty ; having made some provision for the worship of
God I must now contribute something towards supplying the building with the
ministry of God’s word. I cannot, at present, give money ; but I will give one
acre of my best land ; I will plough it, sow it, reap it, thresh and sell the pro-
duce, and you shall have whatever it brings, without any deduction.” The Mis-
sionary and farmer afterwards measured off this consecrated acre, the product of
which for many years was given to the Mission funds. This was a happy in-
vestment for the good farmer; for he was afterwards compelled to say; “It
was a fortunate thing for me that I gave you that acre of land, for, since that
time, my neighbours have all observed that my wheat has grown thic l *-er and
stronger than theirs.” But the neighbours observed what was of more value
even than that. 1 hey saw an illustration of the transforming grace of God, and
an example of practical gratitude worthy of world-wide imitation.
Leigh’s next excursion into the country was made to Parramatta, then the
second place of importance in the Colony and the second place also into which
Christianity was introduced in Australasia. At the time of his visit, Parramatta
consisted of one long street about a mile in length. “ Its beautiful river, with
villas and orange groves on the banks, has been much admired. In the days
of my youth,” says the Rev. John Watsford, “ the Governor’s country residence
was there. The barracks were generally occupied by a large company of
soldiers, who, while they did not improve the morality of the piace, gave to it an
air of life and activity. By the people of Sydney, however, it was regarded as
dull and slow-going.” The town possessed one Church only, in which the Rev.
Samuel Marsden regularly preached. Its population numbered 1,200. A peni-
tentiary for women, known as the “ Factory,” was situated there, to which the
prisoners were conveyed by boat. The disgraceful scenes which, according to
Commissioner Bigge, were continually witnessed in connection with this Institu-
tion, demanded special inquiry, and called forth severe but well-merited repri-
mands upon the responsible heads. Fortunately, an account of the first religious
service held in Parramatta was given to Mr. Leigh by Mr. Shepherd, of Kissing
Point, who was present. We assembled, says Mr. 'Shepherd, in a’ carpenter’s
shop near the house of Governor Phillip in the year 1791. The military Chap-
lain, the Rev. Richard Johnson, officiated. Becoming acquainted with several
persons who enjoyed the favour of God, Mr. Shepherd says that they agreed to
meet privately for religious conversation and prayer, the place selected being
the banks of the little river, which flowed into the quarry. “ Here, under the


canopy of heaven, we read the word of God, prayed for Divine Grace, and the
guidance of Divine Providence, and sang a hymn before we parted.” Those
meetings were continued for seven years. In 1798 several lay Missionaries of
the London Missionary Society who had been driven from Otaheita took up
then lesidence in 1 arramatta. One of these, Mr. James Cover, preaching one
Sabbath afternoon, had among his hearers two men from Kissing Point.
Being impressed by the sermon they requested Mr. Cover to visit and give them
a service; to which he consented, preaching on the following Sabbath. Ob-
serving a number of children running wild, Mr. Cover advised them to build a
school, and secure a schoolmaster, on which advice they acted, and the Governor
appointed Mr. Hughes to the position. Most of the young people, adds Mr.
Shepherd, were educated at this school, and several of them were afterwards
employed in preaching Christ in the Islands of the sea.
Leigh was received with great cordiality by Mr. Marsden, who wished him
God-speed. He first preached in a private house, but afterwards obtained
the Government schoolroom, where he formed a Class of invalided soldiers.
Here he preached with success, several being led to Christ. Among his first
converts was James Watsford, a native of Brighton, in England, who had made
his home in Parramatta. Watsford had been employed as a stockman; and
while in the discharge of his duties he came in contact with a body of hostile
natives. He bravely defended himself, but they succeeded in spearing him.
His wounds so affected his health that he was forced to seek lighter employ-
ment. This affliction led to religious impressions being made, which deepened
into conviction. Hearing Leigh preach, he was deeply convinced of sin ; and
after many distressing conflicts, found peace to his soul. His friends suggested
that as a means of livelihood he should start as a carrier, running from Parra-
matta to Sydney. With assistance he began with a small horse and cart. His
integrity and punctuality, coupled with an obliging manner and unwearied dili-
gence, soon gained for him the confidence and patronage of the public. Busi-
ness increasing, the first conveyance had to give way to a larger horse and a
covered cart; which in their turn were discarded for a stage coach. This stage
coach, driven and owned by the Methodist Class member, was the first stage
coach in use in Australia. And, to his honour be it said, he ruled it in a
worthy fashion; for he courted no man’s favour, and feared no man’s frown.
Bad language or misconduct of any kind he would not allow ; and the culprit,
no matter who he might be, acting contrary to these regulations, was speedily
but firmly, told that he must quit his swearing or his seat. This line of conduct
soon commended itself to the public, and was so heartily approved by certain
gentlemen of a generous turn of mind that they sent to London for four superb
sets of harness, and set him up with a coach and four. As the Lord prospered
him he settled twenty pounds per year upon his mother, with whom he regularly
corresponded. He reared a family of twelve, who were all sent early to the
Wesleyan Sabbath School, and were never allowed to be absent from Church,
morning or evening, on the Sabbath day. This training bore fruit in after
years. For the third son, John, became a Minister and a Missionary taking

his stand by the sainted John Hunt, of Fiji. This “dull and slow-going ” town,
as it was sometimes called, has since given to the Methodist Church many earn-
est workers in the Home and Foreign fields. 8
Windsor was the next place visited, with a service at Seven Hills on the
way. At that early date Windsor had assumed importance as a town and
settlement. Ihe Governor had a residence there ; while the other buildings
comprised military and convict barracks, a court-house, and gaol. The popula-
tion did not exceed three hundred, and Strachan says that they were rude and
intemperate; while many of them had completely outlived all respect for even
the form of godliness.—( Leigh's Life , p. 58.) One sermon on the Lord’s Day
was the only religious agency supplied by the State to meet the wants of the
people. The richness of the soil along the Hawkesbury River flats had in-
duced a number of settlers to make their homes within high-water mark. The
bitter experience of several floods taught them the necessity of building on the
high lands. But they were slow to learn this lesson ; and then Governor Mac-
quarie had to come to their help. In the years 1806, 1811, 1812, disastrous
floods came upon the settlement, that of 1816 bringing deplorable results. Only
the roofs of a few houses remained visible; whilst the saddest amongst the
many sad events was the loss of a man with his wife, his mother, and his two
children, who were carried away on a barley-mow on which they had taken
refuge.
a Among the number may be named the following Ministersßevs. William Moore,
Richaid Caldwell, A. J. W ebb, K. A. Corner, W. Woolls Rutledge, with several ladies who
became the wives of Ministers, and a long list of splendid laymen too numerous to men-
tion.


W hen Leigh first visited this place the weather was not propitious. One
of those violent storms for which the district is remarkable came on, and he
was forced to apply whip and spur to his horse to keep in advance of the rising
waters, and reach the town before they had taken possession of its entrances.
Once here he succeeded in renting an outhouse, or skillion, in which he con-
ducted Divine worship. The attendance was good, and the attention all that
could be desired; save in the case of one poor, but notorious convict, who
entered the room, interrupted the service, and created confusion. Reproved by
his fellow convicts, he retired, leaving the congregation in peace. On the fol-
lowing morning this unfortunate man, when in the bush, was bitten by a veno-
mous snake. Having a wooden leg he travelled slowly, and the poison made
such progress that he died in the bush, where a search party found his body,
swollen to twice its natural size, and the features so distorted and obliterated
that, but for his wooden leg and dress, he could not have been identified. A
grave was dug at a distance, and the body was pushed into it by means of long
poles. Leigh read the burial service, gave an address, and spent the following
Wednesday and Thursday in visiting the settlers.
On Friday morning he set out for Portland Head, on the Hawkesbury
River, nine miles from Windsor. At this spot a number of mechanics, free
emigrants, had made their home ; having left Scotland, it is said, for conscience
sake. If that be so, then Australia has its Pilgrim Fathers. On Saturday
morning Leigh made known he would preach that evening in the corn-shed of
Mr. T. Bushell. (?) The attendance was so encouraging that he decided to
conduct service in the same place at seven o’clock the next morning. Near this
spot a few Presbyterians had erected a building, to answer the double purpose
of a Church and school-house. They engaged a schoolmaster, Mr. J. Youl,
who became preacher also ; and here they started “ The Portland Head Society,
for the promoting Christian Knowledge and the Education of Youth.” Their
building they appropriately named “ EBENEZER,” and they placed it on
“ EBENEZER MOUNT.” It stands intact to-day, and is used every Sabbath
by the Presbyterian Church. In this lonely sanctuary Leigh was requested to
preach at eleven o’clock. “It was truly animating,” he says, “to see those dis-
tant settlers approaching this retired spot, in their one-horse carts, and ar-
ranging their vehicles round the house of prayer.” 9
At the close of this service Leigh returned to Wilberforce, preaching at a
farmer’s house at two o’clock. When the farmer’s wife saw him approaching
from the elevation which overlooks this somnolent spot she began to prepare
the tea and the damper, which were in readiness by the time he reached the
cottage. Surrounded by his congregation, he made his meal, and afterwards
conducted service, preaching that same night at Windsor. Leigh says he re-
tired happy, though wearied. The next morning this apostolic man was at
9. Dr. Lang, the pioneer Presbyterian Minister, paid his first visit to this place in the
year 1824, when he preached and administered the Sacrament. In 1825 he secured a
Minister and formed a charge. The Presbyterians regard this settlement in 1802 as the
foundation of Presbyterianism in Australia. They celebrated One hundred years of
Presbyterianism ” on January 26th, 1902, at this Church. But long before Lang saw the
place Leigh stood in its pulpit. The descendants of some of these early settlers are found
to-day connected with the Hawkesbury Circuit.


Richmond, four miles distant. Preaching in a private house he afterwards re-
cords his impressions: “ Ihe scenery around the town is varied and beautiful in
a high degree. I was astonished when I crossed the main street, and, for the
first time, looked down on the celebrated Australian River, the Hawkesbury, as
it flowed, smooth and deep, on the other side of the eminence, on which the
settlement stands.” Pie could not, unfortunately, write in the same glowing
strains of the condition of the people. Ignorance and licentiousness abounded.
But, notwithstanding this, the visit of the Missionary was regarded as an im-
portant event. On 1 uesday morning the horse’s head was turned towards
Castlereagh. Riding at the foot of the Blue Mountains, Leigh visited every
house on the way, preaching where possible and concluding his day’s toil with
a service in the house of his newly-found friend, John Lees.
His ardent spirit bore him on again, and at an early hour the next day he
started for Macquarie Grove, the residence of Mr. Hassall, where he held even-
ing service. What a fatiguing and rough journey it was! Thirty miles through
primeval forest, with no other guide than the sun, and no other assistant than
an axe, which required constant use. In this hospitable home he rested one
whole day! and then set out for Liverpool, an infant settlement founded by
Macquarie. Plere he found traders, publicans, settlers, and convicts, with
soldiers to guard, but no Church or Clergyman to guide them. A small school-
room had, however, been built by public subscription; and in this building
Leigh preached his first sermon and promised another visit. A short journey
brought him to his first home, where, after so fatiguing a trip, he was glad to
rest, if rest were possible to a man of such untiring energy. Pie had now
visited the chief settlements in the Colony, marked out his Circuit, made ar-
rangements for regular services at convenient intervals, and reported thus on
his work to the General Committee:—
‘‘My Circuit extends 150 miles, which distance I travel in ten days. I
preach at 15 places, and in every place there appears to be a desire to hear the
Word of God. All that I can do is to preach once in three weeks in each place.
Phis is complained of in most places, as being too seldom, but what can I do ?
Come over and help us, ye servants of the Most High! The desire of the
people to whom I preach is to have more Missionaries ; and, therefore, I hope
}ou will send two to me. I need not urge my own situation as an inducement,
but would say that there are numbers of persons that will wish such labourers
God-speed ; and many have not the opportunity of hearing the Gospel plan of
sahation, except from the lips of a Missionary. There is every encourage-
ment we can expect from the state of the Colony. The people are very hos-
pitable, and many have been so to me ; besides there is a general desire to
have the Gospel preached.
* have hkewise the pleasure of seeing four Sunday Schools established
in the Colony, which are now in a flourishing state, and I hope much good will
attend them. We shall be much obliged to any of our friends in England for
books necessary for these schools. All I brought out with me are in use, and
we have no expectation of procuring any more in the Colony. About six weeks

The first Solicitor admitted to Practice in Australia.


distant about forty-eight hours’ sail from Sydney, from winch place, he has
informed me, that when he landed he could not find any place where the Gospel
was preached or prayer made. He resolved to begin a prayer-meeting ; and,
lam happy to find, that he succeeded beyond his expectations. I believe they
have prayer-meetings every evening he is off duty. If you send two Mis-
sionaries, I think one may be well placed there, although I conceive that such
a Mission would be attended with some expense at first, as the people live in
camps, food being scarce and dear. Notwithstanding, if you are pleased to ap-
point me to visit Newcastle, or any other Island, (?) I shall willingly comply.
“ I will give you an account of a Sabbath Day’s work in the country. I
preach at ten o’clock in the morning; dine, and ride seven miles, and preach at
two ; ride six miles, and preach at five ; from thence I ride six miles, and preach
at seven in the evening. lam sometimes afraid that my constitution will not
stand the labour, the climate being so very hot, and having to travel in the heat
of the day. But the pleasing sight of the people flocking to the house of prayer,
some with chairs, and others with stools on their shoulders, to sit upon, when
assembled to hear the Word of God, urges me to persevere ; and while I am
praying and weeping for their souls, I forget my fatigue. Could I but place
before your Missionary Meeting the sight I have frequently beheld, I believe
every heart would exclaim: ‘ Send them Missionaries, and we will support
them.’ May the Lord grant that our hands may not hang down for want of
Missionaries! A poor man walked fourteen miles, a few days since, to con-
verse with me about the salvation of his soul.
“ With regard to myself, all my desire is, to live every moment to God, and
to die in the Missionary cause. I sometimes take a flight to England, and con-
ceive myself to be among my Brethren, hearing and seeing the wonderful works
of God ; but I hear the words, ‘ What doest thou here ?’ Then my thoughts
return to New South Wales, and here I am surrounded with a few who are
enquiring the way to Heaven. The Lord be praised for His goodness! I
hope to hear from you by the first conveyance, and shall be obliged to you for
any advice you may please to give me.”- — (.Methodist Magazine , 1817.)
Let it not be thought that because Leigh wrote in this strain he had no
difficulties with which to contend. His hardships were many, and his dangers
not a few. But he met them all like a good soldier of Jesus Christ. Let the
following be taken as illustrations-One day, while travelling near the Nepean
River, a heavy storm came on. the rain falling in torrents. Sighting a hut he
sought shelter, and was met by a ruffianly looking man and his wife, who told
him to get into the hut, taking his horse with him. When this was done the
cabin was full. The wife had brought with her a sheaf of barley from the
field. Rubbing it into her apron she put it into the frying pan, dried it over the
fire, ground it in a hand-mill, made it into dough, and baked it in the pan.
Then, taking an old saucepan, she put in it a quantity of tea and three eggs,
boiling them all together. When sufficiently cooked the tea was poured off,
the eggs taken out, and Mr. Leigh sat down to his repast of barley-cake and
eggs. Meanwhile the horse was fed on barley-grass, and the Missionary spoke
to his congregation of two on the necessity of preparing to meet God. They


so much appreciated his visit that they would not allow him to leave until he
promised to visit them again. On another occasion he was travelling through
the bush, when he became confused, and lost himself. “ After riding until I
was exhausted, I threw the reins unon the neck of my horse, and allowed him to
shape his own course. He brought me at last to a stockman’s hut. I alighted,
and begged that he would give me something to eat. He said that his master
had just left, and that he was not allowed to give anything away in his absence.
He had thrown some Indian corn to the fowls, who were picking it up in the
back yard. I cheerfully joined the fowls, to which he offered no objection ;
and felt refreshed and strengthened by this Providential repast. Plere I ob-
tained fresh instructions, set out again, and reached Liverpool at a late hour.
The Indian corn which I had eaten with the fowls made me ill for a fortnight.”
He frequently found himself in situations where robbery and murder might
have been perpetrated with impunity; but he met generally with great kind-
ness. Even the natives, who were frequently ill-treated by the settlers, greeted
him with kindness. “ I have often been exposed to their rage,” he says, “ but
hitherto the Lord has preserved me. While travelling in the bush one day, far
from any European dwelling, I observed a tribe of natives coming upon me.
While I paused and hesitated, it seemed to be suggested to me: ‘Go forward in
the name of the Lord.’ I did so ; and as I passed through them on horseback
they bowed in silence. I can say that on many occasions the Lord has de-
livered me out of the'hands of bloody and cruel men. I have gone through
troops of savages in safety. Blessed be the name of the Lord!”
The following extracts from a letter to the Rev. Joseph Benson, dated
February 27th, 1817, will throw additional light on his work and the spirit in
which it was pursued:
“ I shall always remember the evening on which I parted with you. To
observe the flowing tears of an aged father in the cause of Christ, had too
affecting an influence on my mind to be soon forgotten by me. No doubt he
was aware of the dangers, and difficulties, and hardships which I should have
to encounter, and with which, at that time, I was not acquainted ; however, I
hope I shall overcome them. The Lord hath done wonders for me. I have
been kindly received by my Christian Brethren here. His Excellency Governor
Macquarie has shown his approbation of my Mission, and the Clergy are my
friends. Many attend the Ministry of God’s Word. A few conversions I have
already seen, and lam in expectation of seeing many more. 1 need not men-
tion the description of people sent to this country. Yet, thank the Lord, they
are not out of the reach of the Spirit of Grace, and the Mercy of God. He has
wrought, He is working, and Lie will work, upon the hearts of poor perishing
sinners. In this distant and barren land I have had the satisfaction of seeing
six Classes formed: the fourth Class at a place 14 miles from Sydney, the fifth
35 miles, and the sixth upwards of 40 miles. And in some of them the people
seldom meet without experiencing the power of God among them. And I have
been informed that even children have requested their parents to pray for
them, that they may not go on in sin and perish. And, thanks be to God, there
are some who are earnestly seeking the salvation of their souls ; and others are


willing to receive instruction. Several have set their hands to the Gospel-
plough, and been added to the Society this week ; may they never look back,
but soon enjoy, and live in the full assurance of faith!
“ I find no difficulty in entering into the houses of the poor, except what
arises in myself. I hey are always willing to hear ; indeed, I have to regret that
there are more open doors than lam capable of entering. And, if I can judge
from appearance, I may justly infer that the language of the people is, ‘ Come
and teach us the way of salvation, and we will walk therein! ’ When I look
around me, and behold the fields white already unto harvest, but cannot enter
to gather the people together, I am constrained to cry out, ‘ Lord, send forth
labourers unto the harvest.’ lam really, at times, incapable of expressing what
I feel; here are souls perishing for lack of knowledge ; here are open doors,
but I cannot enter them all. What can I say in behalf of this people ? Permit
me, Fathers, to speak to your congregations, that they may be ready to give
and glad to distribute. And, first, let me address the Christian children, who
join with you in the worship of God, from time to time. Here are numbers of
children without the light of heaven, the gospel of salvation. Many are waiting
for instructions. When I relate to them the privileges of children in England,
they weep and pray for the same blessings ; and when I told them there are
children who subscribe for the support of Missionaries, and that I hoped when
they heard there of the desire of children here, to serve and please their
heavenly Father, that they would help our Society to send more Missionaries
to New South Wales ; the language of their hearts appeared to be, ‘ May the
Lord incline them to do so —hear their prayers for us, and bless them for ever.’
If I could have a personal communication with my Christian friends I would
beg permission to say: ‘ Here are souls perishing for lack of knowledge. Many
who are respectable farmers (settlers) have gone to the same house of prayer,
have had the same Gospel preached, have kneeled at the same table of the
Lord, but have thought it proper to leave their native land to settle in this dis-
tant clime. In this situation they have experienced the value of ordinances, and
frequently mourn for their loss ; nevertheless, they are enabled to look to God,
and to the charity of our English friends, in hopes of receiving the gospel of
peace, and of salvation. To the Committee I have mentioned many circumstances ;
but, permit me to observe, I have no one but God to whom I can disclose my
mind. You may judge something of my situation. Send me a brother. If I
have merely bread and water to subsist on I shall be satisfied if you send me
help. We have great use for religious tracts here ; I therefore hope that the
Committee will grant me 3,000 tracts, of such as are published at our Book
Room ; I have already given away more than 1,000, and am happy to find that
they have not been circulated in vain.”

CHAPTER 111.
DEVELOPMENTS
IT is generally conceded that Methodism has made greater use of its laymen
than some other Churches have done. And Leigh knew how to unite
converts in works of practical usefulness. Having met with suitable per-
sons in his work at “ The Rocks,” he sent them forth to visit
the poor, the sick and the dying. They soon discovered that
many persons actually died for want of the common necessaries
of life; while little, if any, public provision was made for the relief
of the destitute. This led two of his visitors—a soldier and an emancipist—
to agree to give sixpence a week each to the most necessitous case they met
with. Later on, they were forced to lay before the Society the deplorable con-
ditions of the poor in their midst. Their statement led to the formation of a
small Committee, ol which the Rev. W. Cartwright offered to become a member,
the matter having previously been mentioned to him by Mr. Leigh. This Com-
mittee divided the town into districts, appointed visitors whose duty it was
to read the Scriptures and pray with the poor, and made a public appeal for
funds. The Treasurer, Mr. John Hosking, who took the public into his con-
fidence in a letter to The Sydney Go.zetie said that the object of this Society,
which they proposed to call the New South Wales Society for Promoting
Christian Knowledge and Benevolence, was to relieve distress in any shape or
form; and without public help the Society must entirely fail. Donations
would be received by him, while the books could be inspected at Mr. Eagar’s,
O’Connell-street, Money flowed in freely, but sympathy overran it; so that
the Committee scon found itself A4O in debt. Matters were thus brought to a
standstill. After deliberation, it was decided to state the case to Mr. Jones,
“a wealthy merchant,” whose heart was so touched that he said; “Gentlemen,
I will comply with your request and execute your order to-day.” The deputation
returned to the vestry, and while still in consultation, Mr. Jones’ cart arrived
with goods to the value of £ 2O. On opening the accompanying invoice they
found it receipted ; and what was yet more encouraging, Mr. Jones had sent
them an order on his banker for the debt of £4O. They were so cheered by
this act of generosity, that they fell to prayer; while Mr. Cartwright and Mr.
Leigh, with joyful lips, rendered thanks to God.
Thus encouraged, they attempted nobler things. Calling on the Governor,
they requested him to provide a building into which they might gather their
sick poor. The request being granted, and generous friends coming to their


aid, they prepared accommodation for fifty individuals, naming the Institution
“ The Sydney Asylum for the Poor.” This Asylum, or Benevolent Society,
as it was frequently called, was speedily filled with aggravated cases of indigence
and disease. The inmates were provided with medical attendance and domestic
comforts, and Divine Worship was conducted twice on the Lord’s Day and
thrice during the week. At Christmas time, when the books were balanced,
the Committee was again in difficulties ; and again it appealed to its generous
friend Governor Macquarie. “I am well acquainted,” said His Excellency,
“ with your proceedings. The management is admirable, and you are doing
much good. But I question whether you will be able to maintain your establish-
ment. I wish you to go on for the present; and I will issue an order for the
immediate payment of the debt you have incurred.”
The success of this Institution, of which the public generally thought so
well, called forth jealousy in a quarter wherein it was least expected. A too
zealous Anglican took upon himself to write Lord Bathurst, then Colonial
Secretary, pointing out the importance and growing usefulness of this Asylum ;
and requesting that, as an assurance of its lasting good and safe conduct, it should
be transferred from the Methodists to the Clergy and the members of the Angli-
can Church. On receiving Lord Bathurst’s reply, the Governor called the Com-
mittee together, and having expressed his surprise that any private individual
should address the Imperial Authorities without his knowledge, proceeded to
read the noble Lord’s reply. This decision declared that “ the management of
the Sydney Asylum for the Poor must remain in the hands of those with whom
the Institution originated ; that the accounts must be audited, as heretofore,
once a year ; and that the Governor was authorised to pay, from the Colonial
revenue, its annual deficiency of income.” Laying this despatch on the table
the Governor remarked; “Gentlemen, I entirely concur in Lord Bathurst s
sentiments.” So evidently did the public ; for Leigh at a later stage writes
“ Since then, this has become a magnificent establishment. Thousands have
been fed and cured and instructed in their religious duties ; and many have
gone from it to glory. Who could have anticipated such results from the two
sixpences of the soldier and the convict ?” The fears, therefore, of the zealous
Churchman were not realised ; and the Institution continued to flourish, until
eventually it passed from private control and became exclusively the property
of the Government, who administered its affairs. But let it not be forgotten
that it owes its origin to Samuel Leigh, the first Wesleyan Missionary, and his
infant Society at “ The Rocks.”
But these sick visitors, by whom Leigh had surrounded himself, made
another discovery, which led to the initiation of a still more important move-
ment, which has wrought untold good here, as elsewhere. Struck by the alarming-
prevalence of ignorance and vice, the visitors were led to seek its cause. They
found that there w r ere very few copies of the Scriptures in the Colony. A house
to house canvass of Sydney made by Leigh and a Major of the military band,
enabled them to state that, on an average, there was but one Bible to every ten
families ; and these had been supplied chiefly by the Naval and Military Bible


Society. Subsequently, Leigh made known this fact to a magistrate with whom
he was dining ; on his departure leaving with him a Report of the Colombo Bible
Society. This Report was passed on to Lady Macquarie. Its perusal led her
Ladyship to ask if a Bible Society could not be formed in New South Wales. “ I
am not aware,” said the Governor in reply, “ that there is anything in the way
of our attempting such an Institution.” The Clergy, military officers, and
several gentlemen were called together to confer upon the subject. Their
decision was that such an Institution was highly desirable, and the object sought
merited their warmest approval; but in the absence of Bibles for sale or gratui-
tous distribution, and in the present state of public feeling, the matter should
be allowed to stand in abeyance. But the Governor was not of this opinion.
Nothing daunted, he inserted a notice in the next issue of The Gazette , calling
a meeting three weeks from that date, at which he would preside. In the
intervening time, however, several packages from the British and Foreign Bible
Society arrived, addressed to His Excellency. This was considered a most
fortunate coincidence ; and it made the way clear for the formation of a Branch
Society. But this “ coincidence ” must be traced to the action of Samuel Leigh,
who, soon after his arrival in the Colony sent the following letter to the Sec-
retaries of the parent Society in England: —
“ Gentlemen, —
“ I take this opportunity of thanking you for the parcel of Bibles and
Testaments, which I received, through the medium of Lady Grey, at Portsmouth.
The Portuguese Testaments I distributed at Madeira, except three. A gentle-
man, brother to a priest, assured me that many persons in Madeira would be
glad to receive and read the New Testament. I had reason to believe that this
statement was correct, from the numerous applications I had for the Word of
God. The English copies I have given away in this Colony; and have had the
satisfaction of seeing, in passing and repassing through the bush, shepherds
and stockmen reading the sacred book with deep attention. Were a Bible
Society originated here, I am sure that Governor Macquarie and the Clergy
would cheerfully give their assistance. Should your Society favour me with
another supply, you may depend upon a faithful distribution of your bounty.”
The meeting, which was held at the time announced, is thus described by
Mr. Leigh in his report to the Missionary Committee: —“ On Friday last, the
yth March, 1820, a general meeting was held at the Court Room, Sydney, which
consisted of nearly the whole of the respectable inhabitants of this Colony,
convened for the purpose of establishing an Auxiliary Bible Society. His Excel-
lency the Governor, presided ; who, with the Judge Advocate, manifested great
zeal in recommending the sacred Scriptures to the notice of the public. Ihe
Rev. Samuel Marsden delivered an excellent speech on the great necessity of
promoting the circulation of them ; and the Rev. Mr. Cowper gave an account
of the testimonies of good men concerning the Holy Scriptures. It is supposed
that there never was in New South Wales so numerous and respectab e a pu
meeting; and in which was manifested such unanimity of sentiment as was on


this occasion. May the Lord continue this union among us, and abundantly
bless the circulation of the Scriptures.” Leigh and the Governor’s aide-de-camp
were appointed collectors, and Mr. Thomas Bowden was Secretary, an office,
says The Sydney Gazette (March 4th, 1824), which he held with the highest pos-
sible satisfaction to all parties. At the second anniversary, held in St. Philip s
Church, Mr. Bowden stated that the sum of £4l 9s. 3d. had been collected
during the year, while the Revs. S. Marsden, Walter Lawry, J. Williams and R.
Mansfield, advocated the claims of the Society. So great was its success that
in a few years, in addition to supplying local requirements, it sent to the parent
Society a substantial sum.
Another movement of far reaching importance was the formation of what
afterwards became known as the Australian Religious 1 ract Society. As dis-
tributors, Leigh employed five soldiers and three reformed convicts, who did
their work so thoroughly that the utility of the Society soon became apparent.
This led the Missionaries to hold a public meeting in the year 1823 for the
purpose of forming a Society for the sale and gratuitous distribution of Reli-
gious Tracts from the Societies of London and Dublin. 1 Eight years after,
and just prior to Leigh’s final farewell to Australia, it was stated in the report
submitted to the public “that 15,052 tracts and books had been gratuitously
distributed during the year; 1250 amongst the Europeans in New Zealand;
1000 amongst the convicts on the penal settlement at Moreton Bay ; 1000 amongst
the labourers employed by the Australian Agricultural Company at Port
Stephens; 159b amongst the stockmen, settlers, and others at Hunter’s River;
250 amongst the patients in the hospital and the prisoners in the jail at New-
castle; 1250 amongst the convicts employed on the roads, and poor settlers
about the Lower Hawkesbury; 1000 amongst the widely-extended and various
population at Bathurst; 1500 amongst the stockmen and labourers in the county
of Camden ; 500 amongst the settlers in Airds and Appin ; 500 amongst the
convicts and inhabitants in and about Windsor; 125 amongst convicts in and
about Parramatta; 3950 amongst the Sunday Schools, prisoners in the jail and
on board the hulks, the sick in the hospitals, and the poor in and about Sydney.”
About this time Leigh paid his first visit to Newcastle, to which place
his attention had first been drawn by a pious soldier who had removed to that
place from Sydney. This soldier in his letter to Leigh stated that when not on
duty he held a well-attended prayer meeting at night. Several convicts were
inquiring the plan of salvation, and they desired him to visit and give them a
sermon. At that time the population of Newcastle comprised a small detach-
ment of troops, four hundred and seventy convicts and a few settlers with their
families. The convict element was regarded as the lowest of its kind ; many
being classed as irreclaimable. First sent to Sydney, they had speedily fallen
into their old ways, or had been rendered callous and desperate by their unfor-
tunate surroundings or the cruelty of the system under which they suffered.
From sunrise to sunset they worked in chains, burning lime, getting timber,

or toiling in the coal mines. So deplorable was their condition, and so aban-
doned had they become, that Governor Macquarie, after a tour of inspection,
in which he discovered that they were without a spiritual guide of any kind, said
to the Chaplain, the Rev. William Cowper: “I must build a Church for the
establishment at Newcastle. I really cannot any longer endure the existing
state of things there. I will give instructions for commencing the work imme-
diately, and you must go over at once and lay the foundation stone with as much
solemnity as possible.” This command was duly carried out, and the services
were said to be “ peculiarly awakening, solemn and impressive.” But now that
the Church was built, difficulty was experienced in securing the appointment
of an Anglican Clergyman. This led to a request from Mr. Cowper that Mr.
Leigh would visit the settlement as frequently as possible. Leigh thus des-
cribes his visit: “ The convicts were conducted to the Church by the military ;
they behaved well, and several of them soon showed great improvement in
their disposition and habits.” —(. Leigh's Life , p. 81.) Shortly before his trip
to England, he visited Newcastle again, this time at the request of the Gover-
nor. Sailing in one of the Government ships, he resumed his labours and
preached to a congregation of 800 hearers, who were again without ministerial
oversight. Here Leigh continued until severe indisposition rendered his return
to Sydney compulsory. He was now, says his biographer, incapacitated for all
public duty; and for a time, his friends despaired of his life.
A few incidents, illustrative of the difficlties of the work, and the way in
which it was carried on by this man of indomitable spirit and singleness of aim,
may now be given. Though the Anglican Clergy treated Leigh as a fellow-lab-
ourer in the work of God, and rendered him all the assistance within their power,
there was one solitary exception. During a visit to Liverpool, where the magis-
trate, Mr. Thomas Moore, caused the bell to be rung to apprise the people of the
hour when Leigh should commence service, a complaint was lodged with the Go-
vernor that such a practice was putting “ Dissent ” on a level with the Church of
England. To this charge the Governor’s only reply was: “Tell Missionary
Leigh to go on quietly and patiently, as he has done, and I will protect him.”
But this reply, though satisfactory to Leigh, did not bring joy to the zealous
Churchman, and he carried the complaint to his official head, the Rev. Samuel
Marsden. Mr. Marsden brought Leigh and the complainant face to face, thus
giving Leigh the opportunity to say: “My Reverend friend has acted a very
unkind part in this business. My own Ministry created that desire for reli-
gious instruction to which he is indebted for his present appointment. On your
recommendation he obtained orders in England ; but till then he was, like my-
self, a poor Missionary I dined at his house but lately, and he did not
even allude to this grievance. He thanked me for the attention which I had
paid to the spiritual interests of his wife, who was converted by attending my
ministry, while he was absent from the Colony. He might have said, ‘that he
had somewhat against me.’ But, Sir, he has carried this frivolous and groundless
complaint to the Governor ; and had I not been well known to His Excellency,
I might at this moment have been under orders to quit the country. The bell


has been rung at the request of your friend, Thomas Moore, Esq. ; but my
opinion was neither asked nor expressed on the subject.” Mr. Marsden’s rebuke
was much stronger; “Sir,” said he, “I am surprised at your conduct; you have
done very wrong; you have grieved me much.” In a reply to a remark that
at his ordination the Bishop charged him to have nothing to do with Dissenters,
the Senior Chaplain said: the Bishop “ could not mean that you were to per-
secute them ! Mr. Leigh has nothing to do with your Bishop ; and I cannot
allow him to be treated as if he were ah enemy to our Church. You must not,
in future interfere with him. When he commenced his service in Liverpool,
there was no desire amongst the people there to hear the Word of God, nor
was there a teacher of any kind within twenty miles of the town. You have
entered ‘ into his labours.’ ” Needless to say, Leigh received no further trouble
from that quarter.
Complaints also come from Windsor. On one occasion when the Governor
was dining with the magistrates, officers and senior Chaplain, the resident
magistrate wished to know if His Excellency knew anything of Leigh’s visits
to the township and his attempts to make the people Methodists. To defeat
such designs, he suggested that the Missionary be sent to work with the chain
gang in the Newcastle coal mines! A better plan would be, an officer remarked,
to allow Missionary Leigh, to remain where he was, ‘ but to keep a vigilant
eye upon him.” The Governor agreed with this suggestion and informed the
company that he had been watching Leigh for some time. 1 his enabled him
to say; “I have now sufficient evidence that he is doing good everywhere. The
complaining magistrate was silenced thus; “ Sir, when Mr. Leigh comes here
again, I desire that you will call the servants of the Government into the store
room, that he may preach to them. Remember, I wish this to be regularly done
in future.”
One other attempt, and that in the most public manner, was made to belittle
the work of the Mission and to discredit it in the eyes of the public. This
took the form of a malignant epistle published in the 7he Sydney Gazette. The
letter is unworthy of reproduction, and would pass unnoticed here were it not
for the reply, which it called forth from the Governor. “ I deem it necessary,”
the Governor said in the General Orders issued at that time, “in justice to
my own feelings, and also to the highly respectable and benevolent persons and
societies engaged in Missionary labours, which have ever received my sanction
and support, thus publicly to express my disapprobation of a letter recently
published in Ihe Sydney Gazette , and calculated to prejudice the public against
those excellent men and their useful institution. After this announcement,
no other person had the courage publicly to express similar views.
None of these things moved Leigh, and the reason is apparent in the spiiit
breathed in the following letter, which he wrote to his parents, October 14th,
1817.
“ It is a long time since I heard from you ; I know not how to account for
it; surely you have not forgotten me. However this may be, I have not for-
gotten you; every day is a witness to this: my prayers are and shall be for


your welfare ; and I have no doubt but God hears and will answer them in your
present and eternal welfare. Since I wrote you I have been much
encouraged in my Mission. The Lord has been an All-sufficient
Helper. Perhaps you have frequently said, how much better he might
have been at home. I believe it would have been so, provided
it had been the will of God ; but I am sure that it is Plis will that I should
be in New South Wales. He has shown me that happiness is not to
be found anywhere else but in doing and suffering His Blessed will! Strange
as it may appear to you, I can truly say that, with my crust of bread and cup
of water, I am satisfied, and more content in the execution of my Mission, than
when I sat at your table, partaking of your roast beef. Not that I have any
cause to think unfavourably of my parents. God forbid! You have been kind
and affectionate to your unworthy son ; and the kindness and affection which
you have always shown to me, I hope will never be forgotten. I pray that God
may reward you for your paternal care. But you know that for years before I
left the most blessed nation and affectionate parents, I had desires to spend
my days in the Missionary cause. And, blessed be the Lord for putting me into
the Ministry, and for giving me a name among the despised, but, according to
my views, the most honourable labourers, the labourers in the Missionary cause.
Yes, I am happy in my work ; and although I cannot boast of any great things
done at present in this Mission, yet I believe that those who may come after
me will have the pleasure of making known to the friends of the Missionary
cause the great an'd good things which have attended it. God has promised
it. The Saviour has sealed the promise with His own blood. The Holy Spirit
has given the earnest, and lo! the end is sure ; ‘My word shall not return unto
me void,’ saith the Lord. Yes, when you and I shall be in heaven, thousands
on earth shall praise the Lamb for this Mission.
“We want more Missionaries in New South Wales. I have written for four
Brethren ; the Committee have promised me only one! Sinners are perishing,
the harvest is great, you are saving something for me, good parents! I bless
God for }/ou ; but here is a call. After your death may be too late ; give it
now; you shall never want; God has promised your bread and your water shall
be sure. If I could stand in your Preacher’s pulpit, I could tell a tale, believe
me. When there is a Missionary collection, never stand counting your money ;
throw purse and altogether into the box. Before I was a Preacher, I recollect
going to a Chapel where there was a collection. My purse was nearly full of
silver. I questioned with myself what I should give ; I said so much ; my con-
science said, ‘ a little more ’ ; the miser said, ‘No’; I took his advice. But
behold, before I returned home, I lost both purse and money! Plow much
better it would have been to have given it to the Missionary cause.
“ But you say: How much he is altered! Before he was a Missionary, he
would sooner suffer than ask for anything; now there is nothing but give, give
to the Missionary collection. This is true; but, remember, that the scale is
turned ; once I knew nothing of God, of Christ as a Saviour, or the value of
precious souls for whom God gave His Son, His only Son, to die ; for whom the

THE REV. JOHN BOWES.
Redeemer gave His own blood! Now I know that God is love, that the blood
of Christ cleanseth from all sin. I know lam saved from hell. Can Ibe silent ?
No ; I am not ashamed to plead the cause of God, the cause of the Redeemer,
the cause of immortal souls. I again say, give liberally to the best of causes.
In your chest your gold and silver will rust and corrupt; in the Missionary
box it cannot; lay it up there ; and there thieves cannot break through and
steal.
“ Oh God, Thou Who has in Thy hands the hearts of all men and women,
children and parents, servants and masters, open their hearts and hands, to
give to Thy blood-bought cause. Send us more of Ihy faithful labourers to
New South Wales, and we will praise Thee now and for ever, through Jesus
Christ our Lord. Amen.”
To his friend (Mr. Healey) he writes in a similar strain“ I
long to hear from you and yours, and to learn what you are doing for the
noble army of Missionaries. Are you praying for them? Are you collecting
for them? Have you a Missionary box in your house? In your office? You
wish to know how lam going on? Why, some are hearing of, some are
seeking after, and others are rejoicing in, the salvation of God. \ou think,


I suppose, that you have all the gospel ordinances. Have the inhabitants of
New South Wales no gospel ordinances? Yes, we have; we have the same
Gospel and means of grace. We have the same throne of grace. But oh!
we have not the same messengers to blow the Gospel trumpet; only one
Methodist Missionary! and he may soon be taken away. If your neighbours,
your brethren, were without bread, or likely to be in want, and you had plenty,
would you not run to their relief? Would you not divide your loaf with them?
I know you would. Are we not brethren? Yes. Help us then. We have but
one Missionary ; you have, in less than twenty miles, 50 men of God, Will none
come to the help of the Lord? Yes, there are several who are crying: Send
us.’ And some have said: ‘We will go to New South Wales. The ship is
ready to conduct them to the place. But, alas! the Committee have not money
for fitting them out, and paying for their passage. O Lord, open the hearts
of the people, the highly-favoured Britons ; and let us no longer groan under
our load; suffer us to live in the Colony to see the arrival of our Brethren.
Lord, send them to us and we will adore Thee ; Thou knowest that we have
waited for Thy servants, even more than the watchman waiteth for the morning!
“What! return to England do you say? You tell me I should have
thousands to preach to. But I should not have my twelves and twenties all
in tears, waiting to receive the word. Yes; I have witnessed the tears of
many; and after I have travelled twenty miles, and preached to twenty persons,
I have returned to rest with twenty thousands blessings, got a good night’s
sleep and gone off again in the morning, singing the praises of God! ‘ Return
to England,’ do you say? Why if I attempted to do so, I should be afraid of
being engulphed in the waves of the sea before I could get out of sight of the
Colony. No, I cannot return to England until I see that God has no more for
me to do in New South Wales. Here I have a few who are teachable, and
willing to be instructed in the way of righteousness. Let no man despise the
day of small things ; God has promised to bless us, and that all the ends of the
earth shall see His great salvation. I thank God lam in good health, never
better. I want nothing but faith ; that faith which has saved, and always
will save when it is exercised. Oh, for zeal for the Lord of Hosts ! for a greater
concern for precious souls! for the salvation of blood-bought sinners. Pray,
dear Brother, that I may be filled with faith in God, and a burning zeal for the
spread of the Gospel. Give my love to all my friends ; they are too numerous
to be named. Work for God,-while it is day ; time is short; there is no working
in the grave ; now is the time to leaven the land ; may we be faithful to the
grace given. That the Lord may be with you and yours, is and shall be my
continual prayer.”
One or two other incidents must be added. On one occasion, when the
Governor saw Leigh returning from the country, he wished to know why he had
not followed the example of others in applying for land for the purposes of
breeding sheep and cattle. In thanking the Governor, Leigh explained that he
was sent to the Colony for purely spiritual purposes ; and the only land he could


accept would be that given as sites on which to build Chapels or School Houses.
To such grants the Governor said that he was always welcome. On presenting
a schedule containing a list of his property at a muster of the Colonists made
every three years, the Governor again chided him for his apparent indifference
to worldly goods. “ Mr. Leigh,” said he, “ have you nothing to return but your
old horse? Why, you seem to have neither cattle nor grain yet!” Surely this
man was worthy successor to him who had but a few silver spoons, of which
to make return to the Commissioners of Excise, and who was determined at
his death not to possess more than £lO.
It sometimes fell to the lot of Leigh to visit the condemned, of whom
there were frequently from six to twelve, awaiting execution in the morning.
On one occasion, he sought to minister to “ four of the most notorious villains
that had ever disgraced Australian society.” They had refused the services of
the Chaplain, vainly hoping that, wherein the priests had failed them in this
world they would intercede for them in the next. And though they informed
Leigh that he was not a member of the “ true Church,” and that his Scriptures
were “ lies,” he nevertheless persevered in his ministrations. “ I accompanied
them,” says he, “to the place of execution, distant about half a mile. When
they came within sight of the gibbet, one of them, who had appeared more
reserved and thoughtful than the others, turned round and said, with much
feeling: ‘Sir, I depend entirely on Jesus for salvation. Will you pray for me?’
I did pray for him ; and never did I see a man more deeply affected, or more
earnest in prayer. I had hope in his death. The other three were exasperated
by his conduct, and evidently died under the delusion of a corrupt faith.”
Leigh’s health was now giving his friends alarm. The privations to which
he had been subjected, the rough fare and the arduous journeys, were telling
upon him. He either would not, or could not spare himself. “You are killing
yourself,” said the Rev. Joseph Benson, “by doing what neither God nor the
Committee expect or require.” But he could not easily check himself. Carried
forward by the irresistible impulse of Missionary zeal, saddened by the condition
of the-convicts, the spiritual destitution of the Colonists and the pitiable state
of the natives, he felt he must work while it was yet day. Mr. Marsden again
gave proof of his kindly spirit, advising him. to take a trip to New Zealand for
the benefit of his health and in the interests of the Mission which he had founded
with lay settlers in the year 1814. “I am sending over a ship,” said Mr. Mars-
den, “ with stores for my lay settlers. I will give you a free passage, and make
such arrangements as shall secure every comfort at sea, and your personal safety
while you remain in New Zealand. When you have considered what I now pro-
pose, let me see you again.” Leigh resolved to accept this generous offer; and
soon after the arrival of his first colleague, the Rev. Walter Lawry, who landed
May 2nd, 1818, he set sail.
But an incident occurred which came very near to sending Leigh to that
far country from which no traveller returns. The London Missionary Society
was sending seven Missionaries and one layman to extend its work in the South


Pacific. Among the number was the Rev. John Williams, with whose spirit
Leigh was highly pleased One of the Missionaries preached for Leigh, taking
as his text: “ I hear that there be divisions among you and I partly believe it ” ;
a somewhat inappropriate passage Leigh remarked, as there was not much to
divide and there was no schism among them. The lay agent —a Mr. Gyles —
was under a four years’ engagement to the Society to superintend the cultivation
of coffee, cotton, and the sugar cane. Thinking to derive some benefit from
a visit to Mr. Matthews who lived at Lane Cove, Gyles decided to visit him,
and Leigh consented to act as guide. Before the desired spot was reached,
night came on, it rained heavily and the travellers lost their way. Guided
by the barking of a dog, they came to a fence, over which they climbed only
to be confronted by five men holding loaded muskets. Leigh was immediately
secured by one of them, who, on turning his face to the moonlight, exclaimed;
“ What! Is this Missionary Leigh ?” “ Thank God,” said Mr. Matthews, “we
have not shot you, as we fully intended.” Explanations followed; when it was
stated that Mr. Matthews’ people were making merry over the imaginary virtues
of that mythical personage St. Patrick, when they were interrupted by the bark-
ing of the dogs. Instantly they jumped to the conclusion that they were about
to be attacked by bushrangers, against whom they were determined to make a
stand. Mr. Leigh and his friend were hospitably entertained ; and on the morrow
returned to Sydney none the worse for their encounter.
During this year, Leigh again reports on his work to the Missionary Com-
mittee (September 26th, 1818); “With respect to the Mission, things are going
on well; we have a good work in hand. At this time three Chapels are nearly
finished ; two at Sydney, and one at Windsor, all of which will not cost the
Society more than TSOO. The people do more than we could expect; many
persons subscribe liberally. Here is one instance: Some time since I was at
the house of Thomas Moore, Esq., J.P., Liverpool, when he said to me: ‘ Mr.
Leigh, I have been considering what I should give you towards building your
Chapel. I have concluded to give you T2O sterling for one at Sydney, £lO
for one at Windsor, and TlO for one at Parramatta.’ We have in addition to
this, several large subscriptions, a list of which we have agreed to
send you by the next return. There is one consideration which we will
call for all we can raise, and that is, building is very expensive in
this part of the world; a common mechanic will not work for less than ten
•shillings per day ; and building materials are very dear in price ; nevertheless,
I believe the Lord will help us according to our want.
“ Our congregations, upon the whole, are on the increase ; and in most
places are very attentive in the house of God. I believe good has been, and
will be done, not merely in New South Wales, but in other parts of the world,
by persons who leave this Colony from time to time. We have several soldiers
in the East Indies, who, according to their abilities and opportunities, are striving
to do good to the souls of men ; some of whom received their first knowledge
of Divine things in New South Wales. We have likewise some at New Zealand


attempting to civilise the heathen, who have been brought to know God. Our
increase has not been so great as we could wish. Nevertheless some addition
has been made ; but on account of some, who, I believe, are gone to heaven,
and others who have left the Colony for different parts of the world, our number
is no more than when I wrote to you last, 72. We are truly thankful for these,
when we consider where we are, and the people among whom we dwell.
Our late harvest has been very good, for which we desire to be thankful. The
value of it we have known by experience. But notwithstanding our former
heavy privations, the people of the Colony have done much in charities. A
subscription was entered into for the relief of the poor in the interior, and a sum
of not less than was raised. After this a Bible Society was established,
and our subscription amounted to more than A3OO, besides various other
collections.”
A few months later (February 24, 1819), he writes again:
“ When I take a retrospective view of this Mission, I cannot but rejoice in
its progress. When I first entered upon it, I had frequently to sleep upon the
ground, with only my top coat for a covering, and my saddle bags for my pillow ;
but now a people has been raised up, who provide us with good beds, and many
comforts. This, as it shows the regard of the people to the gospel, is encourag-
ing ; but it is more so to witness the conversion of sinners to Christ. This is the
best of all; to lie upon a barn, upon the ground, or in the open air, would be
considered no hardship to your Missionaries, if it would be the means of bring-
ing sinners to the Saviour.
“ We are much encouraged in our work by the kindness of His Excellency
Governor Macquarie. He has given us a piece of land in Sydney, on which we
are building our Chapel; Thomas Wylde, Esq., has also given us a lot which
joins to the piece His Excellency w r as pleased to bestow upon us, which lots
together, make our premises very commodious ; for which gifts we have returned
thanks in behalf of the Society. In addition to the above donations, the Gover-
nor has given us land at Parramatta, on which to build a Mission Chapel. At
Windsor, the Rev. S. Marsden has given us a very convenient piece of land, on
which we are building a small Chapel. The Clergy are at all times willing to
advise with us, and likewise encourage us in our work. I believe nothing upon
earth would give them so much consolation as the reformation and conversion
of the people in this Colony. Their hearts are truly set upon their work, and
great good has been done by their labours in the gospel.
“ Although we have endeavoured to supply as many places in this Colony
as we possibly could, yet many settlements are without the gospel. Such is
the scattered state of the people that we cannot visit all of them. We are
invited, time after time, to come over and teach the people the way to heaven ;
but we cannot comply; this is a matter of great grief to us. Surely the people
may say, ‘No man careth for our souls.’ The state of our Sunday Schools is
very pleasing; the children learn with great rapidity. Several have committed
to memory Mr. Thomas Wood’s Catechism, and a Catechism lately published


by the Rev. William Cowper, the resident Minister in Sydney. We have hope
that several children have the fear of God before their eyes. Our teachers in
the Sunday School are, in general, pious persons. From these schools we doubt
not that many will rise up to call the Lord blessed.”
The Rev. Walter Lawry, Mr. Leigh’s first colleague, and the second Wes-
leyan Minister to visit Australia, arrived in Sydney May 2nd, 1818. A Cornish-
man by birth, born at Bodmin in the year 1793, converted to God in early life,
and soon afterwards beginning to preach, he was received into the Ministry at
the Conference of 1817, and appointed to labour in New South Wales. For two
years he worked in conjunction with Mr. Leigh, when Parramatta being pro-
visionally constituted the head of a Circuit, he was appointed to its charge.
Here he laboured in the word and doctrine for nearly two years, and must ever
be regarded as the father of Methodism in Parramatta. To him, instrumentally,
belongs the honour of having organised its first Society, instituted its first Sunday
School, erected its first Chapel, and originated its first financial connexion with
the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society as one of its recognised agents.”-
{Rev. R. Mansfield , Advocate , vol. i., p. 173.)
This Chapel was opened on Good Friday, 1821, when the Rev. R. Mans-
field preached at 9.30, the Rev. Walter Lawry at 2.30, and the Rev. B. Car-
vosso at 7. The collections amounted to £lO. The site was given by Governor
Macquarie and the dimensions of the building were 40 ft. by 22 ft. The
following letter from Mr. Lawry to Mr. William White, of Parramatta, written
on the 18th March, 1820, will show that its initiation was not altogether free
from difficulty.
“ I observed, when at your village last, a considerable agitation and confu-
sion on religious subjects. On the one hand I saw that the Sunday School was
desired by certain persons to be a Government or Church concern ; and by many
of the teachers it was desired to be upon a very different footing, quite uncon-
nected from the Church. But what more immediately concerned me was the
project of building a Chapel at Parramatta. Some are for building upon the
same plan as our Chapels throughout the Colony are built ; that is, upon the
Wesleyan-Methodist plan ; some wish it to be a Calvinistic Dissenting place of
worship, and others desire to divide it between them. The last which I saw
was of this description ; and it was intended to be the property, and, conse-
quently, governed by the principal men who subscribed. I think it my duty to
let you know my views fully upon these points before one stone is laid, that
everything may be done satisfactorily. It appears to me very impolitic and
unreasonable for me to engage in building upon any plan like that before alluded
to, or indeed upon any other save our regular and stated plan, for the following
reasons:—
1. The first Dissenting Minister or Missionary that comes by will find
it probably to his interest to sit down comfortably and supply Parramatta little
Chapel, then the poor Methodist Missionary might go into the bush or else-
where ; for the Chapel being supplied, there would be no need of his labours.

2. It strikes me that such a number of men as would subscribe to the Chapel
would never agree about the manner of conducting the worship in the said
Chapel; and especially when we consider the diversity of sentiment which
would exist among them. There might be Jews or Roman Catholics or Infidels,
and I would never be subject to the direction of such characters how I should

Missionary Society, to whom it becomes me to be faithful. I must not betray
my trust; and they disallow my engaging to build upon any plan but our own,
having had so many thousands of pounds worth of Chapels taken away from the
Connexion. New South W ales is my field of labour; and here, by the Divine
Blessing, I shall spend my last days endeavouring to establish true religion
-among the people ; and I hope that the good friends of Parramatta will not
repay our toil by throwing a stumbling block in our way. 5- therefore,
persuaded by mv Sydney friends to have nothing to do with any building which
is not agreeable to our plan. T. o this lam resolved to adhere, and shall retain
-the piece of land given me by the Government at Parramatta for the purpose


of building a W esleyan-Methodist Chapel there, when it shall be deemed expe-
dient probably in a very short time after the arrival of my dear Missionary
Brethren.
Now, my Dear Sir, let not these things move you. Press on towards the
mark for your prize; it is high and glorious. Do not blame me for coming to
such conclusions as I have. My mind has never been at rest since anything
was said about building that Chapel till now ; and now I have made up my
mind and am happy. Before, I thought I was like Jonah, running away from
my professions. You may inform whom you think proper of my resolution.”
In June, 1822, Mr. Lawry was appointed to the Friendly Islands, to which
station he proceeded in company with Ins wife, a native of Parramatta, and his
infant son, who afterwards became a Missionary in New Zealand. He remained
at Tonga, amidst many privations and dangers and anxieties innumerable, until
November, 1823, when he left for England, passing through Sydney. In Eng-
land, he did Circuit work for about nineteen years, when in the year 1843 he was
appointed General Superintendent of Missions in New Zealand and Polynesia,
a position he retained for eleven years, and a record of which has been given
to the world by the Rev. Dr. Hoole. Again he returned to Sydney and settled
at Parramatta, where his health was shattered by a paralytic stroke. On the
30th March, 1859, i n the 66th year of his age, and the 42nd of his Ministry, he
peacefully entered into rest. Lively in temperament, and fertile in imagination,,
his pulpit ministrations were powerful and attractive to the people. He was
vigorous in the performance of his duties, while his cheerful, social
qualities won him many friends. “He was,” says the Rev. John Watsford,,
“ a popular preacher, full of wit and humour, and often said queer things in the
pulpit. It is reported of him that once, when preaching, a child cried loud and
long. Mr. Lawry bore it patiently for a while, and then kindly addressing the
mother, said, in a way with which no one could be offended: ‘My dear sister, it
is like the toothache, there is only one cure for it, you must have it out.’ I heard
him preach at the opening of York Street Church, Sydney. His text was Ezekiel*
xxxiv. 26. Speaking of ‘ The Holy Hill,’ the stability and permanency of the
Church, he referred to Popery and its sad work. ‘ But,’ said he, ‘at the glorious
reformation Protestanism arose in all its strength, and smote the whore of Baby-
lon in the mouth, and I was going to say, knocked the teeth down her throat.
When I was in Surry Hills Circuit, Sydney, Mr. Lawry was living near me,
and I often saw him. When he had the first attack of paralysis, the effects of
which clung to him to the end, I called at once to see him. I said to him, ‘ Mr.
Lawry, is it right with your soul now ? Looking at me in his peculiar way, he
replied, ‘ Would you not think me a fool if I had not made that right ?’ Some
six weeks after, when much better, though still very feeble, he insisted on going
to Church. When 1 had preached on the conversion of Saul of Tarsus he came
from his pew near the door. Staggering up the aisle of the church, and standing
inside the Communion rail, he said, ' God has raised me up from the gates of
death to warn you once more.’ Then, while a wonderful influence rested on
the people, he prayed them to be reconciled to God.”— {Glorious Gospel
Triumphs , p. 9.)


On meeting with Ins Brother Missionary, Mr. Leigh could not control him-
self ; and his feelings compelled him to fall upon Mr. Lawry’s neck, and exclaim:
“ Bless the Lord, O my soul! and forget not all His benefits!” Of Leigh,
Lawry wrote; “He is everything I could wish in a colleague. In commencing
this Mission he has not only been alone, like a sparrow upon the house top, but
has endured calumny and opposition from those from whom he expected
assistance. I need not dwell upon his wanderings in these forests without food,
having no shelter by day and frequently no bed by night. His patient soul en-
dured all in quietness, and the effects of his labours will be seen after many days.
By his exerpplary conduct he has established himself in the good opinion of
almost every one here, from his Excellency the Governor to the fisherman at the
stall. We are agreed to live upon two meals a day, if we may have another
Missionary and a printing press.”
After calling upon the Governor, in company with Mr. Leigh and Mr.
Eagar, Mr. Lawry threw himself into his work, so that in October of the same
year he was able to write to the Missionary Committee;—
“ Far removed as I am from my most dear friends and country, I do not
forget the many kindnesses and expressions of love which you poured upon me
during my residence in the metropolis ; for which, were it in my power, I would
most gladly make some suitable returns ; but this I can only do in word, not in
deed. It would be pleasing to me to write you a long letter describing a glorious
revival of genuine religion, but this pleasure also is reserved to some future
period; yet the Lord has not left Himself without witnesses in this isolated
part of His creation. On the subject of Foreign Missions nothing is uninterest-
ing to you, and though it would be very pleasing to your intimate friends who
are employed on foreign stations to give every particular, yet this must not
be expected, as volumes instead of letters must then be transmitted you. In
order to give you a view of this Mission, I will detail a few particulars of my
last tour round the Colony, a journey of 150 miles, which I completed within
a fortnight. My first place of preaching was Parramatta, a charming village
(called a town in New South Wales); here is a good congregation, many
sensible and well disposed people, very friendly to our Mission. Thence we
proceed 20 miles to Windsor, on the banks of the Hawkesbury ; this town
is less than the former, yet its vicinity is the most fertile, and the population the
most numerous of any in the Colony. There are a few that fear God, they
love our cause, and are building a Chapel. From Windsor I proceed to Portland
Head, on the banks of the same river; in this district are several steady people
who emigrated from Scotland, and of the Presbyterian persuasion.
“ About forty miles from Portland Head is the district of Airds, the in-
habitants of which are chiefly Roman Catholics (if they are anything, for indeed
it is very little they understand of Divine things). At nine o’clock on Sabbath
morning I preached to about 30 of them, who heard with great attention. If
I ever prayed with my whole heart, it was there in the midst of the wood, among
the Irish Catholics, who gladly received the word. I think my consolations

CROWN STUDIOS.
THE REV. JOHN WATERHOUSE.
Firsi General Superintendent of Missions in Polynesia,


on my way to Liverpool (the village where I slept) were a sufficient compen-
sation for my voyage of 16,000 miles. As to the success of the gospel in this
Colony, I have no doubt; and I exult in it, for many reasons. The station is
certainly one of the most important under your direction. From us, in a few
years I expect to see Missionaries sallying forth to those numerous islands which
spot the sea on every side of us. The Friendly Isles, the Feejees, New Hebrides,
New Caledonia, New Zealand, New Georgia; and then to the north again, very
contiguous to us, are the fine islands of New Guinea, New Ireland, Celebes,
Timor, Borneo, Gilolo, and a great cluster of thickly-inhabited Missionary posts.
How often I have thought of the good which, to all human probability, would
result from one Missionary more for this place, one for Van Dieman’s Land,
and one for Newcastle ; this would be a good supply; but I doubt of seeing
them arrive at present. I thank God, Ido not regret having journeyed so far to
be a helper in this great work of God, which is now carrying on in the earth.
My health is very good, and my mind very happy.”
It now became imperative in the interests of Leigh’s health, that he should
take his much needed trip to England. Before leaving, however, he assisted
at two important functions, consequent on the development of the work of the
Mission. The Chapel at Princes Street affording insufficient accommodation an ef-
fort was made to build a second place of worship in Macquarie Street, on the site
given by the Governor and Mr. Thomas Wylde. The foundation stone was laid
by Leigh on ist January, 1819. “I was induced,” he says, “ to lay the foundation
stone on New Year’s morning, because it is a season of special intercession with
all the Protestant Churches of Great Britain and Ireland; and perhaps the abun-
dant blessings we received on that occasion were sent in answer to their prayers.”
The Australian Magazine (August, 1821) thus describes the opening cere-
monies ; “ This place of religious worship, the erection of which was commenced
more than two years ago, was publicly set apart for its sacred purpose on Sunday,
the ist of July. Three sermons were preached on the interesting occasion. In
the morning, the Liturgy having been read by the Rev. R. Mansfield, a discourse
was delivered by the Rev. B. Carvosso, from Matthew, xvi., 18 v.: LTpon this
rock I will build my Church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.’
After a few congratulatory remarks on the auspicious circumstance of the day,
a third sanctuary having unfolded its doors to the inhabitants of this growing
metropolis, Mr. Carvosso proceeded to illustrate the Foundation, the Erection,
and the Stability of the Church of Christ. By the Foundation, ‘ this rock,’ he
clearly proved that the Apostle Peter was not signified, but the Lord Jesus
Christ whom he had just confessed to be ‘ The Son of the Living God.’ That
Christ was properly and essentially the foundation of His Church, he shewed
by establishing three propositions. 1. From Him proceeded the Atonement, the
ground of our hope. 2. From Him emanates the light which discovers the way
of life s From Him we derive ability to fulfil the commands of God. Under
the second head, he defined the Christian Church to be m its wildest
sense, ‘all those members of the human family, who are now, and shall be here
after chosen and accepted in Christ.’ This he stated to be the Catho ic. or


universal Church, —but to the term ‘ Church’ in its more confined sense, he applied
the beautiful and liberal definition of the Church of England in her 19th Article:
‘ The Church is a congregation of faithful men, among whom the pure Word
of God is preached, and the Sacraments administered according to Christ’s
ordinance.’ This Church, he observed, must be erected by a diligent use of the
means for the spread of truth, so accompanied by the Divine blessing as to secure
speedy and universal success. The stability of the Christian Church, Mr. Car-
vosso ably argued from ‘ the persecutions it has endured ; from the unsuccessful
attacks of infidelity, and finally from its firmly maintaining its grounds against
immorality.’
“ In the afternoon, the Rev. Walter Lawry preached from the first 8 verses
of the 6th chapter of Isaiah. The prophet, he observed, was favoured with this
vision when he was confirmed in the sacred office. It tended to prepare him
for his arduous and painful mission, that of denouncing judgments against
an inflexibly impenitent people. In this sublime vision, Mr. Lawry di-
rected the attention to a view of the Divine Majesty, to Isaiah’s conviction, to
his justification and to his subsequent zeal. From the whole he deduced the
spiritual advantage from so awful a contemplation of the Deity as this vision
presented. In the evening, to a crowded audience, the Rev. R. Mansfield delivered
a sermon from Psalm xx. 5 v.: ‘ln the name of our God we will set up our
banners.’ He commenced by portraying the halycon influence which peace
exerts on the domestic, the political, and the spiritual relations of man. But
however long the train of blessings attendant on the steps of peace, she could
not always be secured. The domestic circle was often a scene of tumult and of
broil, the clash of arms, and the roar of artillery. And the warrior with garments
rolled in blood but too frequently proclaimed the mighty struggles of contending
nations ; and the scene which had been that day exhibited within those walls
was a true indication of existing hostilities in the spiritual world ; for though
the Minister of the Gospel was a. herald of peace, yet was he to sustain the
attitude of a fearless combatant, and through the dominions of heresy and sin
was he to send forth a blast of defiance to the foes of the Cross. And, exclaimed
the Preacher, on this glad day, and in these almost unexplored regions, and in
unison with others already in the field, ‘ In the name of our God we will set up
our banners.’ Mr. Mansfield then proceeded to arrange his discourse into three
propositions, in which he considered: The enemies they assailed, the cause they
espoused, and the victory they anticipated. In the first he refuted the charge
of their aiming at the subversion or deterioration of other communities,
and stated the real objects of assault to be : Pagan superstition, infidel incredulity,
practical immorality, doctrinal heresy, and insincerity of religious professions.
Of the cause espoused he illustrated the justice, the greatness, the usefulness
and the prosperity. The signal victories, which on the strength of prophetic
affirmation he predicted would attend the uplifting and unfurling of these sacred
banners, he contemplated as dearly bought, gloriously secured, and triumphantly
celebrated. He concluded by a fervent appeal to the hearts of his hearers, call-
ing upon the undecided to make an instant surrender to the sceptre of Emmanuel,


and to gather round His banner ; and by exhorting those who had already done
so, to derive animation from the splendid triumphs and the imperishable crown
which should recompense all their exertions and their toils. Such is a feeble
outline of the various discourses which were delivered on this gratifying occasion.
1 he congregations were numerous and respectable, and the aggregate amount
of the collections was £43.”
The next function was at Windsor, where the Senior Chaplain having
given land on which to build a Chapel, and the congregations being regular
and growing, Leigh laid the foundation stone of the new building, assisted by
his colleague, the Rev. Walter Lawry. The 13th of September, 1818, was the
day chosen. Mr. Lawry conducted the devotional part of the service, and Mr.
Leigh preached a sermon from the appropriate words: “And all the people
shouted with a great shout, when they praised the Lord, because the foundation
of the house of the Lord was laid. (Ezra hi., 11. v.) The opening of this neat
and commodious building, the dimensions of which have already been given,
took place early in the year 1819, and created no small stir in the community.
Several families who had abandoned the outward form of religion were brought
under its influence. To this district the Rev. B. Carvosso was appointed, when
the Mission was formed into three Circuits: Sydney, Parramatta, and Windsor;
and here, for two years he laboured, a house being purchased for him at a cost
of A 270, to which a large amount was afterwards added for repairs and furmtute.
The impression made upon the public by Leigh and his work may be gath-
ered from the following communications :—The Rev. R. Cartwright, one of the
Chaplains wrote: “My fellow labourer. I heard on Saturday of your intended
voyage to England. I have for some time observed your declining state of health ;
but assuredly the Lord is fitting you for some eminent service. I rather envy
than pity you, knowing that your inward man is renewed day by day. None
of us have, like yourself, escaped the tongue of the slanderer. Neither in my
capacity of magistrate nor Chaplain have I heard anything to your prejudice. All
classes have united in the opinion, and considered Mr. Leigh a faithful servant
of Jesus Christ. Your labours have been blessed. Take with you the comfort
of knowing that you have the approbation of God and man. If God should re-
store you, stand up for us in England, and plead our cause, that we may have
more help from your Society, or some other. Why may we not hope to have you
again amongst us ? You have a stock of knowledge which none can possess
who have not passed through the same ordeal. Be assured we shall not cease
to pray for you. Write to me, and give me the benefit of your experience. Should
you be in the neighbourhood of Bradford, near Leeds, tell my friends there that
I often think of them with tears of gratitude. And now, my Brother, ‘ I commend
you to God, and to the word of His grace, which is able to build you up, and
to give you an inheritance among all them that are sanctified.’ You must con-
sider me at all times, to be, with much esteem, your affectionate Brother in
Christ.”

The Stewards of the Society in Sydney also sent an official letter to the
Missionary Committee, dated February 24th, 1820, in which they observed : “ Mr,
Leigh has fairly worn himself out in this Mission. For three years he travelled
through this uncultivated and extensive Colony alone and without help, during
the burning heat of summer, and the cold and wet of winter. We all perceived
what would be the result of such incessant labour, and only wonder that he
sustained it so long. It is the unanimous opinion of all the medical men here,
that the only chance of recovery is a voyage to England. After much per-
suasion he has consented to return home. He is exceedingly respected in this
country. Should his health be restored, the Committee cannot send any man
who will be so acceptable to the people as Mr. Leigh. In the name of the
friends of the Mission, we request that so soon as it may be considered safe,
Mr. Leigh may be sent out to us again, in preference to any person.”
On his arrival at Portsmouth, Leigh sent the following report to the Com-
mittee, which, though involving some repetition, is worth inserting, as it gives
his review of the progress of the Mission:—
“ It having pleased Almighty God of his great goodness to conduct me safe
to my native land, and to renew in a great measure my health, in hope of which
I was advised by my dear friends and the Medical gentlemen in New South
Wales to undertake the voyage, I take this opportunity of offering praise and
thanksgiving to the God and Father of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, for


this as well as numberless mercies, which I have received from Him since I left
my native country. ‘ While I live I will praise the Lord.’ For nearly four years I
was enabled to prosecute the duties of my Mission, without leaving vacant one
appointment; nevertheless, the Mission being new, I had my way to make, and
many were my difficulties; such as long rides, and but indifferent lodgings,
having to he on boards, or on the ground, with a topcoat for my covering, and
saddle bags for my pillow ; but a sense of duty compelled me to persevere ; and
blessed be God. I have seen happy effects ; for where at first I had such accom-
modations, there aie now good houses, beds, and, which is far better, congre-
gations are raised up. Several good Chapels have been erected, and many con-
verted to God, who are becoming a praying people. Although I have suffered
m health, I have rejoiced in spirit, in hearing the name of my Saviour adored in
a strange land.
“ I visited New Zealand, with hopes of being benefited thereby, and in
some measure, was not disappointed; but soon after my return from Sydney, I
was invited by the Governor, to supply Newcastle Church, where a congregation
of 800 people much wished to hear the Word of God. I was recommended by
our friends in every part of the Colony to accept of the opportunity, and to
visit the settlement. I complied, and was soon conveyed to the place in one of
the Government vessels ; but after being there a short time I w'as taken sick, and
obliged to return to Sydney, where I had every assistance that I could desire;
but after all attempts, I was brought down so much that I was not expected to
live, and the last and only remedy proposed by the Medical gentlemen, was a
voyage to England. I will now give you a full account of the state of the Mission
in New South Wales. The number of conversions has not been so great as
could have been wished; the number in Society at the time I left was 83 ; and
I hope I can say, they are sincere in their profession. Our congregations are
various with respect to number; at Sydney, our first service is at nine o’clock
on Sabbath morning, the number that assembles between thirty and fifty; after
the morning service, the school commences, with from fifty to a hundred children :
this Sunday school affords a pleasing prospect. The second service is at seven
o’clock in the evening, when there are from two to three hundred attentive
hearers. There is preaching on Monday evening, prayer-meeting on Tuesday
evening, preaching on Wednesday evening, lecture at the Church by the Rev.
W. Cowper on Thursday evening; we have class-meeting on Friday evening,
and prayer-meeting on Saturday evening, and Sunday morning. By the above
you will perceive that the people in Sydney are not without the means of
grace. Oh! that they may not rise in judgment against them in the
great day.
“Our congregation at Parramatta is encouraging: in this place we want a
good Chapel. The congregations in the interior are as numerous as we can
expect; but I am* in hopes of much more good being done when there are
more Missionaries in the Colony, who will preach from house to house, and who
will not think it too much to deliver a sermon, and pray with a single family.


When this is the case, I shall rejoice, in hope of great good being done, and
of much prosperity attending the labours of your Missionaries, in every part
of the extensive settlements in New South Wales. Several places in the Colony
will be, in six months hence, furnished with good Chapels, the dimensions of
which are as follows, viz.:—One in Sydney, in which we have had Divine service
for some time, measures 21 feet by 30 feet; this Chapel is in Princes Street, is
built of good stone, and well finished. The second in Sydney, is erecting in
Macquarie Street, and is to be called Macquarie Street Chapel; it is 50 feet
by 30, stone work, and will be well executed. The expense of this place will,
1 hope, be defrayed by public subscriptions, towards which, one gentleman has
given us £4O sterling, and a number of other respectable gentlemen have made
liberal subscriptions.
“ Our Chapel at Windsor is 32 feet by 16; is built with good brick, and well
finished. The expense of this place is to be defrayed by public subscriptions,
towards which, several gentlemen in that neighbourhood have contributed liber-
ally. The entire expense, will, 1 hope be discharged by the good and well-dis-
posed people of the Colony. Windsor is 35 miles from Sydney, and is sur-
rounded by many large settlements. I have, some time since, proposed to you
this place to be head of a Circuit; much good would attend such a plan.
Our Chapel at Castlereagh, fifty miles from Sydney, is 28 feet by 14; this is
a second place, for Divine worship, built by Mr. John Lees, of the same place,
and will be given, like the others, to the Mission, free of expense. This Mr. John
Lees has been blessed in his deeds. When I first knew him, he was very poor
and much afflicted, but of late God has blessed him with health. Religion has
made him happy, and heaven has crowned his labours a hundredfold. He is
determined to render unto God the things that be God’s. He is very useful as
a class leader, and is never weary of warning sinners to flee from the wrath to
come, of comforting the mourner, and of building up believers in their most holy
faith. May God spare his life for the sake of His Church and people in New-
South Wales.
“ The sixth Methodist Chapel in the Colony is at Nepean River, and is
undertaken by a friend to our Mission at his own expense. The last-mentioned
two Chapels are built of wood, and well executed. By the above statement
you will perceive that God has been with us in this Mission. I beg leave to
recommend to the notice of the Committee the large settlement, called the
Derwent; distance from Sydney, about two weeks’ sail, a place where the Gospel
is much wanted. Three Missionaries are indispensably necessary for New
South Wales ; without this number, the out-settlements, the only places which
most need, cannot be visited. I hope, therefore, that the Committee will take
this case into their consideration. Our Societies, and your Missionaries in New
South Wales, send their sincere thanks to the very kind friends at Sheffield for
their timely present of hardware, which will turn to good account. I beg leave
to recommend to the thanks of the Committee his Excellency Governor
Macquarie, for his very kind and persevering attention to our Missionary con-
cerns in the Colonial Settlements. I cannot forget to inform the Committee


j
THE REV. JOHN EGGLESTOXE.
of the very kind attention of Dr. Redford in my affliction ; likewise Dr. Stephen-
son, of the 48th Regt. of Foot. These gentlemen voluntarily attended me for
several months very diligently, and without any remuneration.
“To the following gentlemen of the Colony, I am much indebted for their
kind attention to me, and to the Mission at large, viz;— Edward Eagar, Esq.,
who has been a very great friend to the cause ; Thos. Moore, Esq., of Liverpool,
whose house we have always found accessible ; I. Miland, Esq., at Windsor;
J. Forbes, Esq., Mr. Scott, Sydney ; Messrs. Knight, Harper, Hughes, White,
Lees, and to all the Clergy of the Colony."

CHAPTER IV.
REINFORCEMENTS
WE must now draw largely on the story of the Mission as told by the
Missionaries in their communications to the General Committee,
other sources of information not being available.
Walter Lawry was the sole Missionary in Australia. But
he soon received valuable assistance in the arrival of two
fellow-labourers, the Revs. Benjamin Carvosso and Ralph Mansfield.
The former landed on the 18th May, 1820; the latter on the
24th September of the same year. After ten successful years of
work in the Mission Mr. Carvosso returned to England, but Mr. Mansfield
ended his days in Sydney. Mr. Carvosso was a man of eminent faith, energy,
and zeal. A favourite theme of his ministry was Sanctification. He had, it
is said, unusual tact and power in leading meetings for prayer. He valued the
moments of life, rose early and observed personal discipline for his work’s sake.
In these matters he had a fine example in the life of his father, that famous
man, William Carvosso, the Cornish revivalist; who preached and enjoyed Entire
Sanctification, and died a triumphant death, singing the Doxology. Benjamin
Carvosso closed his father’s eyes in death, and afterwards published the story of
his life. On his voyage to Sydney a call was made at Hobart Town, where
he seized the opportunity to preach in the open air. The chaplain warned him
to be prepared for insult, and probably assault; but, nothing daunted, he took
his stand on the Court House steps and preached to a great crowd of attentive
and orderly hearers. His subsequent work in that Island so impressed his
hearers that Bonwick says: “ His gentleness and piety, his large-heartedness
and fervour, his sympathy and labour, endeared him to all who approached him,
and hallowed his name in Tasmania.” —(Fisoris Methodist History , vol. 1.,
Hobart Circuit.) Particulars of his voyage may be given in his own words:
“Through the good hand of our God upon us, we are brought in peace and
safety to this remote part of the world. We landed at Sydney on the 18th
May, being four months and twenty-three days from the time of our leaving
England. In looking back, we see much cause for gratitude to God, not only
for deliverance from the perilous deep, but for the enjoyment of many comforts
during the voyage. The Captain was always kind and attentive, and provided
us with the best the stores would afford ; and as we had a neat and convenient
little cabin, in a retired part of the ship, we considered there was no cause for
murmuring, but abundant reason for thankfulness to the Father of Mercies.
But, what is still better than all these things, the Lord was pleased by His Spirit
often to visit and refresh our souls with the consolation of His love.


“ On Sabbath-days, during the whole of the voyage, we had public worship ;
one or two Sundays excepted. Most of the passengers regularly attended, and,
on some occasions, most of the ship’s crew. We always had good order ; and
often the Word appeared to have a gracious effect. For the benefit of those
who were seriously inclined, we had a meeting on two or three evenings of the
week, in a convenient cabin, of which the Captain kindly granted us the use.
In those meetings, we sang and prayed together, and I read and expounded the
Scriptures. Sometimes a good company attended. As there were several
boys in the ship, some of whom could read but little, we appointed three nights
in the week (when it was convenient for them to attend) to instruct them in
reading, and also in the things of God. Mrs. C. and I divided the care of them
between us. For some days before we made Van Dieman’s Land the weather
was rather tempestuous ; and the sea ran high, we shipped much water, and
some damage was done to the rigging. We first saw the land on the 23rd of
April, about 11 a.m., having seen nothing before but sky and sea for eleven
weeks. It proved to be the Southern part of Van Dieman’s Land, and showed
the ship’s reckoning to be remarkably correct. On the 25th we came safely to
an anchor in the Derwent Harbour; one of the finest I ever saw. We landed at
Hobart’s Town, and were very kindly entertained by A. W. H. Humphrey,
Esq., the Police Magistrate. We left Hobart’s Town on 4th of May, and after
a tedious passage of fifteen days, we got safe to Port Jackson, a distance of
about 600 miles.
“ Soon after we came to anchor, Mr. Forbes, a respectable friend, came on
board, and conducted us on shore to the house of our friend, Mr. Eagar, where
we were cordially welcomed and kindly entertained for some days. We were
extremely sorry to hear of the dangerous illness and return of Brother Leigh.
Brother and Sister Lawry we found well: I was not a little grateful to meet Mr.
Lawry, my old friend and colleague, in this remote region. Many hours were
pleasantly taken up in talking over past affairs and in conversing about the pre-
sent state and prospect of the Mission. Soon after we landed in Sydney, ac-
companied by Brother Lawry, I waited on the Governor. His Excellency re-
ceived us very politely. I delivered him the letter of introduction, with which
he was perfectly satisfied, and very cordially assured me he would do anything
in his power to serve me.”
Mr. Mansfield’s voyage was more eventful. “ Our passage has been,” he
says, “ almost without intermission, tempestuous. Many a wonderful deliver-
ance have we experienced from destruction. We had a dreadful storm, which
lasted a day and two nights, and during which we were hourly expecting to be
hurried into eternity. We then lost our main-top-mast, were so dreadfully
pooped, that the dead lights were fixed in and the cabin was floating with
water; and, to crown the whole of our misfortunes, on Thursday, August the
3rd, one of our quarter galleries was washed away, and a large hole stove
through the counter. This filled every heart on board with despair. A feather-
bed was thrust into the aperture, and served through the whole of that dread-
ful night, as the only barrier betwixt us and death. The next day we were
mercifully favoured with fine weather, which enabled our carpenters to repair,


in some measure, the serious damage. All concur in saying, that had it been
only three inches lower, nothing could possibly have saved us from destruction.
Bless the Lord for all His signal mercies! In all these dangers I and my be-
loved partner were supported by Divine grace, and felt fully prepared to live
or die. They were made a blessing to our ship’s company, and rendered my
feeble ministerial labours more acceptable and beneficial. I established a
weekly prayer meeting, which was well attended, and, I trust, greatly useful.
On Friday morning we saw the fertile hills of Van Dieman’s Land ; and on
the following Sunday evening cast anchor at Hobart’s Town. Here I have
been graciously received by his Honour Lieutenant-Governor Sorell, who has
given the use of the Court-House, with permission to preach, during my stay,
as frequently as I please, and a guard of constables to prevent disturbance. I
have circulated hand-bills, and preached every afternoon, at five o’clock, to
crowded congregations. Here is a very open door for Missionary labours ; they
rejoice to hear that a Missionary is appointed them, and patiently await his
coming. I should certainly remain till his arrival, only that I hear Mr. Leigh
has left the Colony for England, and that all the Labour devolves on only two
Preachers, Brothers Lawry and Carvosso. The latter, I am happy to say, ar-
rived safe, and resides at Windsor.”
Mr. Carvosso’s first station was at Windsor; and of his work in that dis-
trict he gave the following particulars to the Missionary Committee: —
Nov. 18th, Saturday, 1820,—1 rode in the evening to Mr. Stockfish’s, and
preached to a few people, and afterwards met five of them in Class. Most of
them seemed to know a little of their fallen state ; but Divine grace in them
is a very feeble plant. It was late at night before I could reach Mr. Lees ; but
I lay down in peace.
Nov. 19th. —After preaching at Castlereagh, a man lingered behind the
■congregation, and came to speak to me. Wiping the falling tear with the
sleeve of his jacket, he told me he had felt much under preaching some time,
but never so acutely as this morning. He said, “ I cannot refrain from weeping
at the sight of my sins.” He has been a steady character for some time, has
lately been attentive to the Sunday School in that place, and has now pro-
mised me to meet, in Class. I dine at Mr. ’s, who came as a soldier into
the Colony almost at its commencement, and has a large family. At present
there is a change in his outward conduct; he professes great attachment to
hearing the Word, likes plain, pointed dealings, and wishes me to come to his
house as often as I can, to pray with his family. I rode to Richmond, and
was enabled to deal closely with the consciences of my hearers ; and still more
so this evening at Windsor. Blessed be God for another Sabbath spent in
His service.
Nov. 20th. —I preached at Wilberforce this evening. This is a most dis-
heartening place; though the Gospel has been preached heie regulaily for
several years, I doubt whether one who sits under the Word sincerely fears
God.

THE REV. HENRY H. GAUD.
Nov. 22nd.—I called on several people this afternoon to talk with them
about their souls. I preached from Matt, xxi., 22 v. I believe many received
the Word, and I left the Chapel encouraged to hope that we should yet see
good done.
Nov. 23rd. —Several people show themselves affectionate ; they express
great approbation of our being among them, and testify their willingness to
support the Mission as far as their ability goes. I preached at Richmond this
evening to a better congregation than was expected, as a great deal of rain
fell at the time of their assembling. We have had much wet lately, which is
likely to injure the wheat-harvest, now nearly ripe. The extreme of wet and
drought to which we are subject in this land are very injurious to the growth
of the Colony.
Nov. 25 th.—l attended the hospital, and found a degree of pleasure in
praying with the afflicted, and in exhorting them to look with penitent hearts
towards the Saviour of sinners. I have instituted a meeting for prayer, and
for reading some of the very excellent memoirs found in our Magazines, and
other works published at our Book-Room. We do this to endeavour to dis-
seminate the knowledge of religious experience among the more serious.
Nov. 26th, Sabbath. —The Hawkesbury is swelled so high from the
abundance of rain that I could not cross it to-day to attend my appointments
at Portland Head and Wilberforce. I went to Church in the morning, and in
the afternoon gave a lecture to the children of the Sunday School. The School
is much improved.


Nov. 30th. —I rode to Richmond this evening with my mind rather dejected ;
but the delivery of the Word seemed to be attended with a Divine blessing.
Several were in tears, and variously testified that their minds were deeply im-
pressed. I hope we shall soon be able to form a Class in this place. May the
Head of the Church remove every obstacle.
Dec. Ist. —I visited the hospital, and was profited in my own mind. My
method of proceeding is, to read a chapter, explain it, and then pray with the
patient; afterwards I give them personal advice. A view of their circum-
stances often produces in my mind sentiments of the deepest commiseration ;
I see many of them taken away in death, but of a few can I entertain much
hope. They are in general very attentive, and some appear thankful. On my
way to Pitt Town this evening I was not a little gratified at seeing some of
the Aboriginal natives reaping wheat with great dexterity and despatch. I
was much pleased with my congregation, because so much like my Cornish
congregations. A respectable number, some from a distance, several women
with infants, leading other branches of their family, all decently dressed, and
hearing with eager attention.
Dec. 6th.—The rain is still pouring down, and now much of the low lands
is covered with deep water. Large quantities of wheat and maize are destroyed.
An awfully calamitous season ! This is the third flood since putting in the first
of the wheat in the month of May last!
Mr. Carvosso now removed to Sydney, Mr. Mansfield taking his place at
Windsor. Of this change The Sydney Gazette (August gth, 1822) says:—“ln
obedience to the discipline of the Wesleyan Church, the Rev. Mr. Mansfield,
with whose mild dictates and charming oratory, the Public of the Capital have
been sweetly and profitably gratified for the last 22 months, has retired from
the Sydney Circuit, and now resides at Windsor. By this body of Christians
the removal of so valued a Pastor and public Teacher would be an object of
unfeigned regret were it not that the responsible and arduous post held by Mr.
Mansfield is so ably filled by the Reverend Mr. Carvosso —a gentleman that
from the possession of solid piety, combined with genuine worth, only requires
to be known in order to be loved. The opportunity now casually presenting
itself, we cannot avoid gratefully acknowledging, that no other part of the world
is more amply blessed, in the Providential supply of active evangelical Clergy-
men and zealous Missionaries, than New South Wales. This latter remark, we
hope, will not be esteemed out of place.”
While at Sydney Mr. Carvosso took an active interest in the establish-
ment of a Floating Chapel, making the following announcement in the columns
of The Gazette (Nov. 13th, 1822): —
“PUBLIC WORSHIP FOR SEAMEN.
“ For some time past it is well known certain Individuals have had in con-
templation the Performance of Divine Service on the Water in the Cove of
Sydney; Captain Siddins having now kindly offered the use of his Vessel for
that purpose, the Sailors on board the rest of the Shipping in the Flarbour are


affectionately requested to take notice that on Sunday next, at three o’clock in
the afternoon, Public Worship will be performed on board the Brig - Lynx ;
when it is hoped many of those who ‘ do Business on the Great Waters ’ will
promptly evidence their desire to hear the Gospel Message.”
Subscriptions were sought, rules were drawn up, and advertised, and the
following gentlemen were appointed a Committee of management: —Messrs.
J. Nicholson, J. Scott, E. Hunt, Hyndes, J. Atkinson, with J. Piper (Treasurer),
and R. Howe and R. C. Pritchett (Secretaries). It was “ intended that the
Floating Chapel when finished shall be open to all parties and influenced by
none.” The service was held according to announcement, and Captain Siddins
fixed up the main deck. The seamen, of whom too were present, were invited
by the Bethel flag displayed at the main top-mast head. The Rev. George
Erskine, who had recently arrived in the Colony, preached from the words:
“ Prepare to meet thy God,” and the word was “ attended with energy.” The
Committee announced at a latter stage that as soon as £2OO were in hand it
would “ commence the long-spoken-of Floating Chapel.” Mr. Carvosso also
assisted at the Anniversary of the Masonic Lodge, which took place at Mac-
quarie Street Chapel, when several Civil and Military gentlemen were present,
with the full band of the 48th Regiment.
Later he writes; —“ The account of my appointment to Van Dieman’s
Land reached us in the beginning of April, and though we would willingly
have remained in our present comfortable station a little longer, we fully
acquiesce in the design of the Committee ; believing the removal to be agree-
able to the Head of the Church, and that it will be for the furtherance of the
Gospel. With respect to this Mission, although I cannot, from my knowledge
of it, send you any accounts of remarkable outpourings of the Spirit, and the
rapid spread of experimental and practical piety, yet the cause to which we
are attached is growing in the esteem and affection of all ranks of Society
Our ministry in most places, is well attended; in those places where it is not,
the cause is to be sought alone in the great neglect of all religious ordinances,
which but too generally obtains throughout this land.”
The station thus made vacant was filled by the Rev. R. Mansfield, who,
under date of Sept. 16th, 1822, writes“ In the Windsor Circuit I find many
discouragements arising chiefly from the very general indifference of the people
to the word of God. Iniquity awfully abounds ; vice exhibits its odious front
without a veil, and leads a long train of votaries into its most flagrant excesses.
My beloved predecessor, Brother Carvosso, toiled in this Circuit for two years
with indefatigable zeal; and though on removing he felt grieved that he had
reaped so little fruit, it is evident that his strength was not spent for nought.
A few have been truly converted to God, and now walk in the light of His
countenance ; seven out-stations are statedly visited; and there is, at least, a.
prospect of having eventually, in these secluded wilds, an extensive and pros-
perous Society.”

His Journal also contains the following items:—
Friday, March 22nd, 1822.—1 visited the Malefactors under sentence of
death, among whom is a woman doomed to die for the murder of a man with
whom she had been living many years in adultery, though her husband is still
umg in the Colony. She informed me that she was descended of pious
parents, her mother having been a regular attendant on the ministry of the
Methodists, in the vicinity of Manchester. She was married when very young;
but her first husband dying she was left with a family of young children, and.
having no means of supporting them, was led to the commission of those acts
of dishonesty for which she was transported. She confessed to me that since
her arrival here there was scarcely a crime of enormity of which she had not
been guilty; and she feelingly acknowledged the righteous retribution of God
which has at length overtaken her. She seems truly contrite. How rapid is
the progress of a sm, and how certain its eventual punishment!
Friday, 29th. —I again visited the gaol, where twelve unhappy culprits are
awaiting the awful crisis. They listened attentively to the word of exhortation,
appearing unwilling to lose a single word ; but I find it extremely difficult to
draw them into conversation on the solemn topic of religion. Dark and ignor-
ant in the extreme, they seem at a loss to comprehend the nature and necessity
of a change of heart; and repose a delusive confidence in that natural regret
which is so often mistaken for genuine repentance. May the Lord in mercy
shine upon their minds, and renew their hearts!
Good Friday, April sth. —This day I have been enjoying the blessings of
the Lord’s House. At nine o’clock we had a serious and profitable prayer-
meeting at Princes Street Chapel; at eleven, I attended the Church and heard
an eddying discourse from the Rev. Mr. Cowper, on I. Peter hi., 18 v. ; and this


evening I preached at Macquarie Street from “Jesus lifted up His eyes to
heaven, and said, Father, the hour is come,” etc. I have endeavoured to draw
near to God by faith in the Saviour’s blood, and have sweetly experienced His
willingness to save all that come to Him by His Son.
Sunday, May sth. —I have preached thrice. The Chapel was this evening
crowded to excess. I have not seen so large a congregation since I left London.
I felt great solemnity while’ improving the late awful visitations. Several re-
markably sudden deaths have just taken place in this town, especially that of
a wealthy merchant—without God in the world. He was riding home on Thurs-
day night, and had arrived nearly at his own door when he was suddenly thrown
from his horse, and was so violently bruised that yesterday afternoon he expired,
leaving an amiable widow and a young family to lament his untimely end.
This alarming providence has excited a general and deep sensation among the
inhabitants, which, by the help of God, I endeavoured to turn to good account.
My text was: “ I know not the day of my death.” The silent and fixed atten-
tion of the large audience showed that they felt almost every word. O
that the impressions may be as lasting as they appear to be deep !
Meanwhile Mr. Lawry was busy at Parramatta, where he built a Chapel at
his own expense, and did a most valuable work, particulars of which, unfor-
tunately, are not accessible. In a brief report to the Committee he writes;
February 29th, 1821. —I have been preaching to the poor prisoners at Pen-
nant-Hills, most of whom hear me with great attention. I have regularly
preached here for several months once a week, and the people hear with very
remarkable attention.
April 10th. —Yesterday I received the following intelligence from Corporal
George Waddy, of the 48th Regiment, dated Hobart Town:—“ The harvest
here is plenteous but the labourers are few ; the room where we meet is too
straight for us,” These pious soldiers have transmitted a regular account of
their number and proceedings in Sydney. I believe there are about twelve
who meet in Class.
Previous to this time Leigh had been busy in England gathering materials
for his Mission to New Zealand, upon which he had set his heart. Sailing in
The Brixton , he landed in Sydney, Sunday, September 16th, 1821, in company
with his bride, the Rev. William Horton and his wife, and the Rev. William
Walker. Calling at Hobart Town, Leigh decided to leave Mr. Horton in Van
Dieman’s Land, where, under the sheltering care of the Lieutenant-Governor,
there was a fine opening for a Missionary. Mr. Walker passed on to New
South Wales to commence a Mission to the Aborigines.
Before the Missionaries moved to their various stations Leigh thought it
advisable to publicly hold the anniversary of the Missionary Society and to
form an Auxiliary Branch in Australia. This important meeting was held in
Macquarie Street Chapel on the Ist October, 1821 ; and excited extraordinary
interest, being the first of its kind held in the Southern Hemisphere. Leigh,
who presided, was supported by his Brother Missionaries, while amongst the
attendants were gentlemen of distinction and Magistrates from various parts of


the Colony. Though this Branch Society had not been in existence many
months, having’ been constituted on the sth July in the preceding year, it had
already yielded £236.
Several important speeches were made at this meeting; but by far the
most important, and without doubt the most original, was that of John Lees
of Castlereagh, who had, says the Rev. Benjamin Carvosso, “come down in his
joitmg cart, thirty-five miles, to attend the meeting. He had heard much of
the Missionary Meetings in England. They suited his taste, and he came on
tip-toe of expectation. Various persons had addressed the meeting- it was
drawing to a conclusion: the Secretary had taken down a pretty long list of
subscriptions with the names of the contributors annexed. John who was sit
ting on my right hand, now stood up, his tall, lean figure making him very con-
spicuous, and said, with great seriousness: ‘ Mr. Secretary, put me down for six
guineas/ As those were not the days of great givings, the meeting was as-
tonished. The Secretary, knowing his narrow circumstances and large family,
could not bring his mind to place so large a sum in connection with John’s
name. This storm of benevolence from the Blue Mountains arrested the pro-
ceedings ; till John, guessing the cause of the embarrassment, got up and re-
lieved his friends. His heart was full at the thought of God’s love to himself
and his family. Amidst flowing tears and with broken accents, he assured the
meeting of his deep sense of obligation to God and his Saviour. He must be
permitted, he said, to present the sum he had named, to promote the cause to
which he was a great debtor. He concluded with a touching reference to two
of his children whom God had recently taken to glory. One of these, who
had married a lay Missionary of the Church in New Zealand, returned to the
Colony and died in the Lord! Every individual present was much affected ; his
name was entered on the subscription list, and his speech pronounced the best
of the evening. As he literally sought first the kingdom of God and its
righteousness, he found means in due time to pay his noble contribution.”
The Second Anniversary, which was held on September 30th in the fol-
lowing year, is thus described by Mr. Mansfield;—“ At six o’clock this even-
ing we held our second Anniversary of the Auxiliary Missionary Society in
Macquarie Street Chapel, the Rev. Thomas Hassall, Assistant Chaplain, in the
chair. The assembly was numerous, respectable, and evidently interested in
the great cause which we are endeavouring to promote. That the cause is
gradually obtaining a greater portion of the approbation and assistance of our
Colonial public, appears obvious from the Treasurer's report, by which we were
thankful to find that our receipts this year much exceed those of last.” The
report was read by Mr. Carvosso, in which he stated that the sum of T230 was
contributed during the year. Among the speakers were the Revs. B. Carvosso,
R. Mansfield, W. Walker, W. White, and Messrs. E. S. Hall, Forbes, Scott,
Josephson, Hyndes, Terry, Thompson, Reiby, and Howe. With such an array
of speakers it was not surprising that the meeting did not close till 11 o’clock.
Two Aborigines were on the platform, and the collection amounted to £2O.
The third Anniversary was equally successful. “ This evening,” (Oct. 6th,
1823), says Mr. Carvosso, “We held the third Anniversary of our Auxiliary

Missionary Society. The meeting - was well attended, and highly interesting.
Ihe Rev. Thomas Hassall was called to the chair, and conducted the business
of the meeting in a very satisfactory manner. Brother Erskine, who had be-
fore scarcely any opportunity of attending a Missionary Meeting, and of wit-
nessing the effects produced on such occasions, was particularly delighted. The
contributions in the course of the year have amounted to about £240, chiefly
raised in Sydney ; many of the subscribers in the interior having been unable
to pay their subscriptions, in consequence of the great reduction which has
taken place in the prices of grain and other produce in the land.”
But the year following the Anniversary gathering eclipsed all previous
meetings. Tke Sydney Gazette said: —“We have much pleasure in noticing the
proceedings of the Fourth Anniversary of the Wesleyan Auxiliary Missionary
Society, which was held in Macquarie Street Chapel on Monday evening last. The
preparatory sermons were preached on the preceding Sabbath by the Rev. S.
Leigh, and by the Rev. Daniel Tyerman, of the London Missionary Deputation.
At the evening service especially, several of the first personages of the Colony
were present; and the sermon, which was grounded on the I. Thess. i., g-10,
“Ye turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God, and to wait for
His Son from Heaven,” was such a display of cogent reasoning, exhalted sym-
pathy, and masterly eloquence, as could not fail to produce the most salutary
impressions on the large and attentive assembly. At the Anniversary the
Chapel was quite full, and the business was conducted with the utmost pro-
priety ; there was a happy mixture of humorous but appropriate anecdotes and
allusions, with solemn and dignified appeals to the noblest feelings of human
nature, and these were supported by the recital of striking and impressive facts.
George Bennett, Esq., who discharged in a very able manner the duties of
Chairman, the - Rev. Daniel Tyerman, and the Rev. L. E. Threlkeld, a London
Missionary from Rhaiatea, one of the Society Islands, communicated much in-
teresting information as to the former idolatrous and degraded state of the
numerous inhabitants of the Society and Sandwich Islands, and the wondrous
change both as to civilisation and sound morality, which has been effected among


them by the persevering agency of Christian Missionaries. In pointed illus-
tration of the happy effects of religious instruction of our West India negroes,
John Stephen, Solicitor-General, remarked that, on an estate belonging to him-
self, in the Island of Tortola, there was a number of slaves sunk in the lowest
depth of ignorance and vice, and particularly addicted to every species of dis-
honesty. To the instruction of these slaves the Wesleyan Missionaries were
invited ; and, in a short period, so complete was the reformation, that thefts
became quite unknown ; one of the negroes was appointed to the management
of the estate, a post which he occupied with fidelity and approbation ; and the
annual profits of the plantation amazingly exceeded the amount of any previous
year. Mr. Stephen also observed, that from his own personal knowledge, he
was able to state, that among the white population of the West Indies, he had
beheld, as the result of Wesleyan Missionary exertion, the drunkard becoming
sober, the thief honest, and the profligate reclaimed to habits of industry and
discretion. The other speeches, delivered on this occasion, presented irresistible
appeals to every principle of humanity and mercy. We were much pleased to
observe the strong emotions of sympathy and benevolence which were excited
on behalf of the Aborigines of this extensive country; and we cordially hope
the result will be the undelayed prosecution of more efficient and extensive
plans for ameliorating the condition of these wretched beings. On the whole,
we do not remember any former occasion on which the claims of many millions
of our fellowmen, who are yet without God and without hope in the world, were
more effectually urged or more cordially recognised ; whilst the friendly union
of persons of different religious denominations, in promoting the common cause
of Christianity, was never more conspicuously exhibited.”
In the country successful meetings were also held, of which the following
particulars will be read with interest. Mr. Mansfield writes (Feb., 1822): —•" At
the first meeting of the Ladies’ Committee, the amount of the contributions
gathered by the diligent hands of their collectors, was no less than T24 13s. 3d.
The male collectors produced, at the same time, £y igs. 6d., making a total
collected in Sydney during one quarter of T32 12s. pd. This is surely credit-
able to our young friends, to the Committee, and to the Colony. We last week
held the Anniversaries of Parramatta and Liverpool. The Rev. John Williams,
one of the London Missionaries from the Society Islands, spoke at great length,
and with much feeling, of the cruel practices of. those idolatrous tribes, before
their conversion to Christianity. Indeed, the barbarities of that people seem to
have been much more dark and horrid than is generally known. Human sacri-
fices were commonly offered, and their immolations were accompanied by deeds
of torture, at the relation of which the soul shudders. Now, their idols are
totally abolished, —Chapels are erected,—-and spiritual Churches are founded.”
Of Castlereagh and Parramatta Mr. Carvosso says: " The Brethren all
being present, we held a Missionary Meeting at Castlereagh. The Assembly was
not numerous, nor wealthy, but our Divine Master was with us, and the sub-
scriptions were very liberal. Not forty persons were present, including several
children, yet they subscribed £2O. In the evening of the same day we had another


meeting at Richmond, when the liberality of the people was very encourag-
ing. The following day we held a Meeting at Windsor, and had most
satisfying proofs that many are well inclined towards our Mission. Mr. Com-
missary Broughton was present, and not only subscribed two guineas, but stood
up in the meeting, and said that as it was difficult to get the settlers to contri-
bute in ready cash, if we could get them to pay their subscriptions in wheat, he
would use his influence with the Governor to get it taken into the public stores.
We held meetings at Parramatta and Liverpool, and obtained very liberal sub-
scriptions. At the dilferent meetings we obtained the promise of subscriptions,
annual and quarterly, to the amount of about Aioo. We are about to publish
a little pamphlet, containing an account of the Object and Proceedings of our
Socit ty, and also an appeal to the inhabitants of this Colony. We trust it will
be the means of serving the common cause.” Reports of other meetings held
at later dates give further particulars. For instance, at Parramatta, in 1825, the
Rev. Daniel Tyerman presided, and Messrs. George Bennett, of the London
Missionary Society, Thomas Hyndes and George Smith, spoke “ with much
propriety and feeling.” Kissing Point did well, and at Windsor “ George Allen,
Esq., Solicitor,” was elected Chairman in the absence of the Solicitor-General!
who had promised to preside. Castlereagh, in some respects, surpassed all
other places. Mr. James Scott was in the chair. Owing to the scarcity of
money in the country parts of the Colony the collection was not large ; but
the subscriptions promised were most liberal. Amongst these were: Mr. John
Lees, 80 bushels of wheat, worth about ASO > Mr. Lees’ children, ten pounds
tobacco ; Mr. and Mrs. Stockfish, six pounds ; Mr. and Mrs. Field, eight pounds
tobacco; Mr. Field has also presented to the Society a new Steel mill, of the
value of AB.
The pamphlet above referred to, which was approved of by the Mission-
aries, and came from the pen of the Rev. W. Horton, was printed, circulated,
and transmitted to the parent Society ; as it was considered “ sound in its prin-
ciples, correct in its facts, and judicious in its suggestions.” The following is
its substance:—
“ You have in this part of the world one of the most interesting and invit-
ing fields of Missionary exertion anywhere to be found. Here are two exten-
sive and flourishing British Colonies, urging powerful claims on your Christian
benevolence, and promising ultimately to yield a most ample return. Their
inhabitants are almost entirely British, as well in their feelings and habits and
general character, as in their origin.” After referring to the deadly influence
of the “ most worthless and vitiated sons ” of the Mother country the pamphlet
proceeds; “In the case of perhaps one-third of the population, this awful
degeneracy is fostered by the superstitious ignorance and hostile bigotry of
Catholicism ; for in that proportion has the insurrectionary spirit of Ireland,
coupled with her poverty and vice, contributed to crowd this place of exile. It
need not be argued with you, that the desolating effects of this gross delusion
and rank iniquity can only be counteracted by a full and faithful ministration of
the Gospel of Christ, or that this sovereign remedy is able to repair the mis-
chief, and destroy the very stamina from which it springs. Of this you are fully

aware. . . . It is also important to observe that, in our endeavours to bring
on this glorious consummation (that of saturating the whole land with a know-
ledge and love of God) we meet with few obstacles, save those which arise from
the moral corruption of the people.”
Touching upon the magnitude and prospective enlargement of the Colonies
the writer adds; “ And as the vast extent of our unoccupied territory affords
unlimited scope for industry and inexhaustible means of subsistence, New
Holland is likely to be, for centuries yet to come, a receptacle for British felons,
and an asylum for British settlers. We may, therefore, look upon our present
settlements as the rudiments of a great and mighty empire, obviously destined,
by a wise and merciful Providence, to abolish the Paganism of this portion of
the Southern Hemisphere, and to diffuse amongst the numerous surrounding
nations and tribes the arts of civilisation, and the blessings of Christianity. . .
Now, it must appear to everyone a matter of the highest importance, to im-
pregnate with religious influence and energy these elements of the future great-
ness of Australia ; to purify and sweeten those primitive sources of her future
population. . . . Nor will the influence of Australia’s piety be confined
to her own offspring. She sits as the undisputed Queen of the great South
Pacific. She already exerts a powerful, though not a political, influence over
the numerous insular nations that are scattered over that mighty expanse of
water. . . . The islands of the adjacent ocean spread before us. . . . In
some of them Christianity has already achieved a splendid triumph; in two
others of them the work has been commenced by your own agents; and the
tract which stretches before you and through which there is nothing to obstruct
your progress, is extensive and interesting .... yours is the only institu-
tion that has formed a settlement at the Friendly Islands. From the station
which you have there taken, may your labourers spread themselves over the
whole of that large cluster; and thence proceeding to the Navigators, the
Feegees, New Caledonia, the New Hebrides, the Solomon Isles, New Britain,
New Ireland, New Guinea, and numerous subordinate islets, might they reach
the Carolinas, the Latrone and Pelew Isles, the Manillas, and the vast number
of other populous islands which crowd the great Oriental Archipelago, and bring
us to the frontiers of the Chinese Empire.” The statement concludes by re-
commending (i) a man of sound experience, clear judgment, and conciliatory
manners, to visit New Zealand and Tonga; (2) an increase of Missionaries;
and (3) the purchase of a vessel to navigate the South Seas, and to carry Mis-
sionaries, stores, and intelligence from one station to another.
We must again allow the Missionaries to tell the story of their own work.
From Windsor Carvosso writes (July, 1822)“ About four weeks since
Brother Eawry and his family sailed in the ship St. M ichcicl for Tongataboo.
The vessel was destined to touch at New having on board Mr. W.
Hall, of the Church Mission, and carrying the provisions and stores to Brother
Leigh. In one of my letters of January last I stated that Brother Lawry
expected to visit Tonga, in a vessel belonging to the Mission in the Society
Islands ; but he was disappointed in this, and in two or three other proposed
methods of conveyance. Together with his family, he had taken with him two

or three mechanics, who are all steady, active young - men, members of our
Society. I believe they were moved to volunteer for the work, principally from
the particular regard they bear to Mr. L. The need of such persons in an un-
dertaking of this kind is very apparent. Brother L. has also taken with him
eight cows, a bull, and six sheep, to remain on the Island for breeding: these
were presented by His Excellency the Governor, out of the Government stock
of this Colony. As the object of the owners of the St. Michael is to traffic
with the inhabitants of the Friendly Isles, it is probable she will remain at the
Islands some months, so that Mr. L. will have a most favourable opportunity of
learning the character and disposition of the natives before the vessel returns.
Whether he will return by‘her, or remain behind, is contingent on the reception
he may meet with. A short time before he sailed he had an opportunity of con-
versing with an intelligent man, a Captain of a whaler, who had just come from
eleven months’ cruise amongst these Islands ; he gave a most encouraging ac-
count of their disposition to receive instruction ; and stated that the Island of
Tonga was now entirely under the Government of the Chief who formerly
showed such special kindness to the Brethren of the London Missionary Society,
and that he is not only still well disposed towards Missionaries, but is very
anxious to receive any who may come to him under that character.”
Mr. Mansfield adds:—“ Sunday, Nov. i;th, 1822. —This has been a
laborious and exhausting day. At five o’clock I set out from Mr. Stockfish’s for
Emu Plains, where I preached to a good congregation, and walked about four
miles. On returning to Castlereagh, I found that Divine Service was to be
performed in the Church, and therefore proceeded immediately to Richmond,
under a fiercely scorching sun. At half-past one I arrived, and while the
sexton was apprising the inhabitants of my intention to preach, I threw myself
on a bench, and enjoyed half an hour’s refreshing sleep. Soon after two, my
congregation was collected, and I preached with comfort, notwithstanding my
fatigue; and thence proceeded to Windsor. Though parched and weary, the
Lord was the strength of my heart.


Sunday, Nov. 24th. —Preached at Pennant Hills, Kissing Point, and
Parramatta. We held a Love Feast, which was lively and interesting; several
spoke with the most satisfactory clearness of their conversion to God and pre-
st nt enjoyment of His favour. Among this people a good work is certainly
begun. May it go on to perfection.”
In August, 1823, Mr. Carvosso wrote from Sydney:—“ Brother and Sister
Turner and Mr. Hobbs left us for New Zealand on the 22nd ult. In the estima-
tion of our friends here, the importance of the New Zealand Mission is now
much laised. I cannot myself but acknowledge I feel my regards drawn to-
wards it much more than formerly; and my hopes’for the prosperity of that
Mission now begin to kindle. The hand of the Lord will verily be with His
servants ; and I am persuaded they will give Him no rest till He establish His
Church in that heathen land. With respect to the cause of God in Sydney, lam
bound to speak of it with gratitude. Not that I have anything marvellous to
communicate; —no, this is not the land where the Word runneth very swiftly;
—but I can see enough to make my heart rejoice. I see evidence enough
sufficient to convince me that Jesus doth not permit His Gospel to be preached
in vain. Sinners are convinced of their guilt and danger, are humbled by the
power of the Spirit, are led to the fountain open for uncleanliness, are washed
from their sins, and are raised up to sit in heavenly places with their gracious
Deliverer! But the good which is done, be it little or much, the Lord Himself
doeth it. O, how desirable to behold Zion in prosperity! I know not that I
ever felt, on the one hand, so incapable of doing any good myself, and on the
other, so strong a desire to see good accomplished. O Lord, revive Thy work,
even in New South Wales! The public means of grace are well attended,
and a blessed influence from above is often felt by the speakers and the
hearers. Several persons, of different stations in life, are drawing near, and
casting in their lot with us.”
“In the Sydney Circuit,” says Mr. Mansfield (Jan. 31st, 1822), “the work
of God continues to prosper. That prosperity, it is true, is not so abundant as
to excite exultation ; but it is sufficient to impress the heart with deep grati-
tude to Almighty God, and to enliven it with well-founded hopes of permanent
and increasing good. I have for some time, with the Leaders and Exhorters,
been earnestly looking and praying for a revival of the Work of God. At the
late District Meeting this was made the subject of long and serious conversa-
tion. We turned to the Minutes of Conference, and found that great success
had resulted from the diligent use of Scriptural means. We mutually agreed to
tread in the steps of our Seniors in the Ministry, so far as our local peculiarities
would allow. The congregations are increasingly large and respectable ; the
numbers in Society are gradually augmenting; the Prayer-Meetings are well
attended, and are frequently, in an eminent sense, ‘ times of refreshing from
the presence of the Lord ’ ; and our Sunday Schools receive accessions of both
Teachers and Scholars. In the Sydney Circuit alone we have four Sabbath
Schools, which we denominate THE WESLEYAN SYDNEY SUNDAY
SCHOOL UNION. The first is held in Princes Street Chapel; the second in
Macquarie Street Chapel; the third in one of the Prisoners’ Barracks; the


fourth at a cloth manufactory at Botany Bay. At the Barracks are upwards of
a hundred convict boys, many of whom could not read at all before the school
was formed. They were zealously instructed by Mr. Thomas Hyndes, one of
our Class Leaders, who first commenced the good work at Grose Farm, three
miles out of town, whither this useful Brother went every Lord’s Day morning,
with a perseverance which does him the highest credit. The work was, how-
ever, more than his individual efforts could fully accomplish, and two or three
others volunteered their assistance; the Teachers’ Meeting likewise voted him
the services of some of their own number, who alternately devoted their labours
to that truly Missionary employ. Their exertions have, however, been recently
superseded by the zeal of a gentleman of high office in the Government, who
has himself entered on the laborious work, and instructs the youth according to
the National system. The School at Botany is conducted by two persons who
were members of our Society in Yorkshire, and who appear well qualified for
the office. There are nearly twenty boys who receive instruction from them
The total number now in the Sydney Union (of course exclusive of the Bar-
racks) is i 80. Here lies the foundation-stone of our liveliest hopes.”
And in his Journal he states: —November the sth. —Our Missionary Prayer
Meeting was well attended, and was a lively, profitable season. Mr. Leigh
related some affecting particulars of our neighbours, the New Zealanders. He
expressed his delight at seeing so many present, and finding so good a work
going forward on behalf of the Missionary cause.
Nov. 18th.- —A laborious but a happy Sabbath. I preached four times.
After evening service we had a heavenly Love-Feast; the best, I believe, that
was ever experienced in New South Wales. I could scarcely help fancying
myself in England, so lively were the people, so clear their experience, and so
powerfully was the presence of God felt. Brother Leigh conducted the Love-
Feast, and gave much sound spiritual advice.
December Ist. —I rode this evening to Castlereagh, about thiry-five miles
from Sydney. The shades of night overtook me while riding through the woods.
I knew not where I was, or whither to direct my course ; but, trusting to the
instinct of my horse, 1 reached the house of good Mr. Lees at eight o’clock.
The horse fell with me in the woods, and threw me a considerable distance down
the hill. But the watchful eye of our Heavenly Guardian was upon me, and I
arose perfectly unhurt. I arose (next morning) with the sun ; at six we sung
and prayed with the family, then breakfasted, and proceeded to the Sunday
School. I sat in the pulpit, watching the progress of instruction among the
little immortals, who were collected within the sacred enclosure. At ten the
congregation was assembled, and I preached from: “ This man receiveth sin-
ners.” I then proceeded to Emu Plains, about five miles further, where there is
a large estate cultivated by the Government, and a little village, containing, I
should think, more than 200 prisoners and others. We assembled in a large
room, capable of holding three or four hundred; and greater liberty in preach-
ing the Word of Life I believe I never felt. Their attention was very pleasing.

Brother Carvosso’s ministry has evidently been made useful to these poor men.
I thence proceeded to Windsor, where I preached in the evening to a serious
congregation.
Dec. 7th. —This morning I rode to Parramatta with my Brethren, Messrs.
Leigh, Lawry, Carvosso, and Walker, to present our address to His Excellency
Sir T. Brisbane. We were most kindly received by His Excellency, who
entered into a free and interesting conversation on the utility of Christian Mis-
sions. The sacred cause has in him an enlightened and a zealous friend.
Dec. nth.—Brother Leigh and I waited this morning upon their Excel-
lencies Governor Macquarie and Governor Brisbane, of whom Brother L, took
leave, being on the eve of proceeding to New Zealand. Sir Thomas expressed
himself deeply interested in the New Zealand Mission; and presented Mr.
Leigh with a plenteous supply of seeds, and other articles. I this evening
preached to “ the poor, the maimed, and the blind,” in the Benevolent Asylum,
a large and handsome building, humanely erected for charitable purposes by
Governor Macquarie.
Dec. 12th. —We had a solemn and delightful time this evening in Mac-
quarie Street Chapel. All the Brethren were together, and Brother Leigh
preached his farewell sermon to a numerous and affected auditory. We after-
wards partook of the Lord’s Supper, and felt much of the presence of God.
Brother L.’s text was Philip, i., 27. His parting counsel was truly spiritual,
and will, I trust, be lastingly useful to those who heard it.
Dec. 15th. —I spent the evening with Mr. and Mrs. Leigh, who have just
received very painful tidings from New Zealand. War is raging amongst the
natives with dreadful fury. Brother and Sister L. are kept from fear by the
Grace of God ; and are determined, by His help, to enter among these savage
hordes, and offer to them the salvation of the Gospel.
Dec. 31st- —At four o’clock this morning we accompanied our dear Brother
and Sister Leigh to their ship, where we took our leave. We to-day held our
District Meeting, and closed the year at a very profitable Watch-night. A
much larger congregation attended than was ever before seen at such a time
in New South Wales.
Monday, May 27th, 1822.—This has been a very interesting day. At 8
o’clock in the morning we commenced the annual examination of our Sydney
Sunday Schools. 1 The children repeated several chapters in the New Testa-
ment, and answered such questions as were spontaneously suggested by the
portions of Scripture recited. In this branch of religious instruction, many of
them displayed a proficiency equally creditable to themselves and to their
Teachers. At eleven o’clock they were conducted, in procession, to St.
Phillip’s Church, where the Rev. Win. Cowper kindly preached to them an
appropriate and edifying sermon on the occasion, from Proverbs viii., 17: “I
love them that love Me.” He perspicuously and feelingly described the gra-
cious regard of the Redeemer towards the young, the peculiar advantages of

seeking an acquaintance with God in early life, and the important duties which
respectively devolve on Parents, Teachers, and Children. Though no collection
was made, a sum of near £\ was voluntarily contributed by several respectable
individuals present, in whom the numerous and orderly appearance of the
children, and the fervent appeals of the Rev. Preacher, had excited a lively
interest. At two o’clock the Teachers and Visitors re-assembled with the
children, in Princes Street Chapel, to close the examination, to distribute the
various rewards, and to partake of a plain repast. In this pleasing task we
were kindly assisted by three Clergymen, the Revs. Cowper, Hill, and
Hassall; each of whom, on presenting the tokens of merit, delivered suitable
addresses, and expressed their satisfaction with the appearance and proficiency
of the classes. In the course of the day I received from one of these excellent
Clergymen the following highly gratifying note: —
“My dear Sir,—A Lady sends you the enclosed Twenty Pounds sterling
towards the expense of your Chapel, and the support of your Sunday Schools
at Sydney: viz., Al5 for the former and A 5 for the latter.
“ With sincere Christian regards,
“ I remain, dear Sir, truly yours,
“WILLIAM COWPER.’’
“ Sunday, June 9th. —I preached at Loughbottom, and heard Brother Lawry
preach his farewell sermons at Macquarie Street, being on the eve of embarking
for the adventurous Mission of T. ongataboo. The evening congregation was
exceedingly large and respectable, to whom our dear Brother gave a history of
his call to the Ministry, and a succinct narrative of his Missionary labours in
this Colony. We afterwards met the Society, and each of us delivered to them
a short address. We felt much of the presence of God ; it was really an affect-
ing time. Brother Lawry is much beloved in the Colony, many regarding him
as their spiritual father. His Ministry has been very useful.
The Missionaries remaining in New South Wales continued the work so
successfully inaugurated by their predecessors. Ihe Committee of the Local
Auxiliary, which met frequently for the transaction of business, was composed
of the following gentlemen —Revs. George Erskme and Ralph Mansfield, and
Messrs. Robert Howe, George Allen, John Stephens, John Hutchinson, James
Cobb, John Atkinson, Thomas Hyndes, John Tawell, 2 William Chapman,
John Ennis, Reuben Uther, George Smith, and John Weiss. Mr. Erskine and
2 Those familiar with the history of John Tawell will not be surprised to find his
name on the Committee. Judge Therry, who lived opposite Tawell tor two years, says
“He struck me as being a very saintly person. He always sought the society m P
of persons of reputed piety.” Transported for forgery, he subsequently became the
principal druggist in Sydney, and by the export of whale-bone, combined with his busi-
ness, he made money. Returning to England he married a respectable lady who knew
nothing of his antecedents; while at the same time he became involved m a hason with
another woman. His income falling off, he sought to relieve himself of the expense of
supporting his wife, by destroying her. For this crime he was hanged. While in New
South Wales he posed as a tempeiance reformer, gave largely to chanties, and even built
a commodious Meeting House for the Society of Friends in Macquarie Street, to whom
he professed to belong. On a stone these words were insciibed. John iaweil to the
Society of Friends.” Notwithstanding this pretence of piety he has been deservedly
described as the u arch hypocrite of his time.


Mr. George Allen were joint Secretaries, and Mr. Robert Howe Treasurer. On
Mr. Erskine’s removal to Windsor his place was filled by the Rev. Ralph Mans-
field. Additional names appear in the course of years, the laymen being Lance-
lot Iredale, D. Lindlay, Edward Smith Hall, Samuel Mansfield, Thomas Bowden,
senr., James Scott, John Lees, John Street, and others. The meetings, which
were generally held in the Mission House, Sydney, were not always well
attended, a few being Committee men in name only. The first available record
of the meetings of this Auxiliary bears date July Bth, 1825, though the Society
met informally some years before that time.
The duties of the Committee were simple, though important. They in-
cluded the oversight of the Branch Societies at Parramatta, Windsor, and
Hobart Town, from which quarterly reports were expected, though not always
received; arrangements for the anniversary celebrations; the passing of
accounts, and the approval of remittances to the Parent Society. The following
sub-committees were appointed(l) Finance: to collect funds; (2) Accom-
modation : to conduct strangers to seats, to exercise the general superintendence
during the meeting, and to make the collection ; (3) Subscriptions: to take down
the names of subscribers at the meeting; (4) Preparation; to superintend the
erection of the platform, draw up the resolutions, and make other preparatory
arrangements. That these Committees, together with the Branch Societies, did
their work well is apparent from the following figures. At the end of Dec.,
1826, these amounts had been raised since the foundation of the Societies:
Sydney, £1,084 J 9 S - 4d. ; Parramatta, £321 is. 7|d. ; Windsor, £356 19s. o|B.;
Hobart Town, £363 17s. 3-^d.; making a total of £2,126 17s. 3|d. Not an in-
significant sum for a Mission whose Auxiliary had been in existence but five
years.
The General Committee was now earnestly fulfilling the promise made to
Leigh when in England, that additional Missionaries should be appointed to
New South Wales and the Missions in New Zealand and Tongataboo. Mr.
Leigh had left for New Zealand; Mr. Lawry for the Friendly Islands; Mr.
Carvosso for Van Dieman’s Land; and Mr. Mansfield remained in New South
Wales, where he had been joined by William Horton, William Walker, and
George Erskine. Shortly after, William White, junr., Nathaniel Turner, and
John Hobbs arrived on their way to New Zealand; and at at a later stage John
I homas and John Hutchinson were sent to Tongataboo. But as the work of
these pioneers will be dealt with in succeeding chapters, their arrival and de-
parture only need be stated here.

CHAPTER V.
DARK DAYS
IT is now necessary to refer to a misunderstanding, which arose between Leigh
and his colleagues. It must already be apparent that Leigh’s attitude to
the Anglican C hurch was one of conciliation, in which he studiously avoided
everything that could be construed into rivalry or opposition. He was
influenced in his conduct by the following considerations. First: a desire to
avoid a repetition of the bitter struggle between Protestants and Papists, against
which Macquarie had warned him. Secondly: a determination to adhere loyally
to the Committee’s instructions ; and thirdly ; the furtherance of his conception of
the work and future position of the Methodist Church in this land. At Wesley’s
death the diversified opinions of the Connexion had, says Stevens, resolved
themselves into three classes, composed respectively of men who wished for no
change in Methodism, unless it were a greater subordination to the National
Church ; those who desired to maintain Wesley’s plan intact; and those who
advocated revolutionary changes with a more equal distribution of powers among
laymen and Preachers. Leigh’s sympathies were with the first of these parties.
But when other Missionaries arrived, whose views were not coincident with his,
a more independent and less conciliatory attitude was adopted. Having no wish
to be appendages to the Establishment, they instituted services and administered
Sacraments during the hours of worship in the Anglican Church according to
the principles agreed upon in the Plan of Pacification. While cherishing feelings
of Christian charity and brotherhood towards the Clergy, they determined on an
independent course, and resolved to follow what they believed to be the guiding
hand of God. To this course Leigh was so strongly opposed that he conceived
it to be his duty to bring the matter before the Missionary Committee. The
Committee considered the question ; but that consideration must have been
superficial; for its members reached their conclusions on .ex-par te statements.
When charged with this they denied it, but the fact that their strictures were
afterwards withdrawn, and Leigh reprimanded, is proof to the contrary. Both
plaintiff and defendant could not be right; and it is certainly an unusual pro-
cedure to severely censure the defendant, and then after reflection and further
enquiry to reprimand the plaintiff. Had the Committee exercised that judicial
mind, generally characteristic of its actions, neither censure nor reprimana would
have been given. But as they were given and officially recorded they demand
notice.


That the Committee’s strictures lost nothing in point of effectiveness coming
from the pen of Richard Watson or Jabez Bunting, we may rest assured. The
evidence before the Committee was contained in the Sydney Quarterly and Dis-
trict Meeting Minutes; and letters or documents from the Sydney Stewards
and Leaders, the Rev. William Cowper, M.A., and the Missionaries themselves.
On this evidence it was found: —“i. That before the consent of the Committee
was even asked, the Sacrament and Service in the forenoon were introduced in
Sydney. 2. That disputes arose betwixt the Brethren and Mr. Leigh on this
subject. 3. That Mr. Leigh was put on his trial at a Meeting of the Missionaries
for not preaching in Church hours.”
In its findings, when referring to the administration of the Sacrament during
Church hours, the Committee said: “ The conduct of Messrs. Carvosso, Lawry,
and Mansfield is highly censurable, for having deviated from their Instructions,
in the introduction of the Sacrament and Service in Church hours .... and more
especially as by thus acting contrary to instruction and placing themselves in
opposition to Mr. Leigh, who justly considered his Instructions as binding, until
modified by the Committee, they have made the matter a subject of debate and
contention.” In putting Mr. Leigh “on his trial,” and “ calling upon him to show
his reasons for not violating his Instructions,” the Brethren “ added a great ab-
surdity to disobedience.” 1 The Committee, the communication proceeds, was
“ always willing to listen to statements of facts relative to necessary expendi-
ture,” but it would never permit its “ instructions to be revised and altered, and
qualified at the judgment of an individual Missionary or a meeting of Mis-
sionaries ” ; for such a thing, if permitted, “ would render nugatory all discipline
and control ” ; and if persisted in, would mean that “ the relation between them
and the Committee must necessarily be dissolved.”
The Missionaries were also advised “ to cultivate the spirit of deference to
the Clergy, 2 and a cordial co-operation with them in promoting the moral benefit
of the Colony .... all collision with the Clergy, as to their schools, is strictly
forbidden, and the more fully to avoid disputes the Brethren are explicitly to
understand, that they must more frequently visit the settlements and smaller
towns,” and pursue “ the plan of itinerancy commenced by Mr. Leigh.” 3 The
Committee concluded; “You may rest assured that the case was felt very pain-
fully which called for such Resolutions as the above ; and unless they be attended
to forthwith, the consequence will be still more afflicting.”—(. District Records.)
On receipt of these “ unwarrantably severe censures,” the Missionaries set
forth the matter from their standpoint; when the Committee again wrote:
“ Doubtless we could not suppose it possible that such charges had not been
1 “ This would have been an absurdity ” ; retorts Mr. Mansfield in a foot note to this
correspondence which he copied, “ but the Brethren were not so destitute of common
sense as to commit so preposterous an act.”
2 This is surprising reading at this date. But it was necessary then in the interests
of peace.
3 Mr. Mansfield says that they are not only “equalled, but surpassed Mr. Leigh,
in the labours of itinerancy.” But this cannot be conceded. Equalled they may have
done, but surpass they did not; for that would be impossible.

THE REV. NATHANIEL TURNER.
mentioned in private, according to our and the Christian rule ; and for this we
think Mr. Leigh highly blameable, as well as for the unhappy habit, which we
fear he has fallen into, of indulging prejudices against his Brethren. On this
we shall suitably admonish him. As to the charges, we think them on the whole
very satisfactorily answered ; in every point, but those in which they themselves
acknowledged that they acted contrary to their instructions, or at least without
waiting to receive their instructions The questions arising out of the
introduction of the Sacrament and service in Church hours, without the consent
of the Committee may be considered as disposed of. You say that Mr. Leigh
was not put upon his trial .... we admit the explanation that this was not the
intention We trust that what we have said will convince you of our regard
for you ; and we on the other hand are satisfied, from the tone of your communi-
cations, and the observations you have made, that your faults have been errors
of judgment, and not of contumacy.”— {Letter Book .)
This satisfactory conclusion would, it is thought, have led to a more perfect
understanding between the Missionaries and the Committee in their future re-
lations ; but such was not the case. The Committee was autocratic and inexor-
able, and the Missionaries appear to have magnified their own powers. They


were sometimes compelled to act on their own responsibility, and frequently at
their own initiative, owing to the slow and uncertain means of communication.
Thus, it sometimes happens that they sought advice ; then, through delay, were
forced to act without it, only to find that when the Committee’s decision arrived
it advised another course or peremptorily forbade the very thing the Missionaries
had done. This being so, great forbearance and considerable latitude were
necessary on both sides.
Trouble arose over the building of Macquarie Street Chapel. The total cost
of this structure was about £2OOO, and to raise the necessary funds the Mission-
aries borrowed Aiooo from Mr. Eagar, and the balance from the Government,
I he loan from Air. Eagar was obtained in the hope, if not with a definite promise
that the Alissionary Committee would refund the amount from its funds, or borrow
it elsewhere. This unauthorised action gave great offence to the Committee.
Bills had been drawn for the General Expenses of the Mission contrary to
rule, and the Committee deemed it “an act of imprudence so great as to
require from the Committee and Conference such a mark of displeasure as to
give efficacy to their future directions and security for the observance of those
Rules which in this case were criminally evaded.’ The matter was not, however,
referred to Conference; though the Committee insisted that “ until the interest
and principal of the sum ’’ borrowed be paid, the two Brethren who drew the
Bills for that amount “ shall be considered personally, as Trustees of the Chapel,
responsible for the £IOOO, and their account regularly credited with all sums paid,
whether as principal or interest,” and also that “ no part of the proceeds of the
Macquarie Street Chapel pew rents, nor of the Auxiliary Missionary Society,
shall be applied to any other purpose whatever ” until Mr. Eagar was fully
repaid. The Committee eventually repaid Air. Eagar in two amounts of £SOO
each, and the Rev. Joseph Orton financed the Government loan, assisted by a
legacy left to the Missionary Society by Mr. Howe. And thus ended that trouble.
The General Committee now thought that the time was opportune for
forming New South Wales and Polynesia into a District with an official head.
Hitherto, each Missionary had been a law unto himself, acting in some measure
the one independently of the other. Though each might advise, none could
control. Three Circuits were already in existence ; a Missionary was stationed
at Hobart Town, and the Alissions at New Zealand and Tongataboo were bring-
ing additional responsibilities. Informal gatherings, conveniently called District
Aleetings, had previously been held, whereat the Missionaries considered the
various aspects of their work and sent forward reports to the Committee But
the first legally constituted District Aleeting was held in Princes Street Chapel
on the 3rd of January, 182 C. To the Chairmanship of the District, the Rev,
George Erskine was appointed by the Conference of 1825, having filled the office
of General Superintendent since the Conference of 1821. The Rev. William
Horton was financial Secretary; while to the Rev. Ralph Mansfield, the post
of corresponding Secretary was allotted.

' Jsaggre^--
THE REV. JOSEPH ORAM.
President, 1S80.
Mr. Erskine was one of Dr. Coke’s Missionaries to Ceylon, where he spent
some years, proceeding thence direct to Australia. In the climate of that spot,
so lovely that “ every prospect pleases, and only man is vile,” his constitution
was undermined. Henceforth he suffered from an asthmatic affection which
retarded his work, rendering him ill-prepared to grapple with the difficulties of
a new and arduous position, and carried him to an early grave. On his way
to Sydney, where he arrived on the 4th November, 1822, he called at Hobart
Town, and was welcomed by Nathaniel Turner. Mr. Turner speaks of him as
an invalid Missionary in exceedingly delicate health, and thought by some to
be dying. What motives induced the Committee to send an invalid Missionary
to superintend an important and promising Mission is explainable only by its
members. Viewed in the light of results, and in the absence of the Committee’s
knowledge, the appointment must be pronounced a mistake. Mr. Erskine’s
health, however, so far improved that he entertained hopes of complete restora-
tion. On the 2nd April, 1823, he was married to Miss Lydia McDougall.
“We were married,” he says, “in Sydney Church by the Rev. C. Dined at
Parramatta under Br. M.’s hospitable roof, and slept at Windsor. I see and
acknowledge the hand and guidance of my Heavenly Father." The improve-


ment in health was temporary. A few years later, a widow and five fatherless
children were mourning their loss. The long and fatiguing journeys, the hard
fare and the constant strain more than counteracted any benefits derived from
a salubrious climate. His brother Missionaries recommended the purchase of a
gig for him, as his “ infirm state of health sometimes renders travelling on horse-
back too fatiguing, and even dangerous, especially during the intense heat of
summer.”
Mr. Erskine’s first appointment was in Sydney, when he afterwards removed
to Windsor. In his journeys he was sometimes accompanied by Mr. James
Scott, who proved a good and safe guide. Travelling together on one occasion
they were stopped by bushrangers, who, after the manner of their fraternity,
demanded money or life. Happily, the travellers escaped without the loss of
either, for the bushranger, who had been a former servant of Scott, was re-
cognised by his master, and they were allowed to pass on. Thoughts of an
early death led Mr. Erskine, after much prayer and thought, he says, to make
an application to the Governor for a grant of land at Erskineville on which to
build. In this matter he must have overlooked the Committee’s instructions,
which forbade such a step. The request was complied with, and the house duly
built. Here as a supernumerary he lived for some time ; and while here he
received through the Rev. Joseph Orton, who succeeded him in the office of
Superintendent, an offer to go to Norfolk Island, to which place the Governor
desired to see a Missionary appointed. But this was not to be, for another
command came to George Erskine which he could not refuse to obey ; and in
1834 he was called up higher.
In his official position, Air. Erskine’s conduct has called forth severe and,
must we not add, well-deserved criticism? As Chairman of the District it was
sometimes necessary to hold in abeyance private judgment and personal feeling
in order to become the mouthpiece of the Missionary Committee, whose re-
sponsible agent he was, and whose interests should have been paramount. But
when this was required he seemed unequal to the tasic. 1 hus, his more ag-
gressive coadjutors took the lead, or forced him to conclusions with which, per-
haps, he did not always agree ; but for which, notwithstanding, tiie Committee
held him responsible and often blameworthy. But the man who could write in
the following strain as a Missionary in Ceylon was not just the person required at
this juncture: “ Had I known this Mission at first as I do now, nothing beneath
the heavens would have been an adequate inducement to bring me to Ceylon. I
anticipate deliverance from painful trials, by a deliverance from this Mission, by
death or whatever seems best to Infinite Wisdom.” Under the influence of
such feelings it is not surprising to find that the affairs of the Mission in New
South Wales drifted into chaos, and its prospects were blighted for years.
The positions of Superintendent and Chairman brought duties requiring the
exercise of sound judgment and tact, combined with firmness. For instance,
Mr. Erskine was charged with the selection of suitable candidates for the Ministry
from amongst the Colonial youth. He was, therefore, advised to bring on the


case of John Lovell, to which special interest attaches. As a Local Preacher in
the Van Dieman’s Land Circuit he was highly commended by his Superinten-
dent, the Rev. Benjamin Carvosso. The District Report describes him “as
indeed one of the excellent of the earth,” and from many points of view his
acceptance as a candidate for Mission work among the Aborigines of Australia,
or the heathen of I onga and New Zealand, was highly desirable. But he was
twenty-nine years of age ; he was married, and had three children, whom he
cheerfully engaged ” to maintain independently of the funds of the Society if
that were required; but he did not receive “ the doctrine of Eternal Sonship.”
Notwithstanding these considerations the District Committee recommended his
acceptance. The General Committee, however, thought differently. Adam
Clarke had recently made known his views on the Eternal Sonship. To counter-
act his opinions, Richard Watson wrote a pamphlet in 1818, entitled “The
Eternal Sonship of Christ,” which had so much weight with his Brethren that
the Conference resolved to admit no candidate to its membership who denied
“ the Divine and Eternal Sonship of Christ.” In face of this resolution the Dis-
trict Meeting recommended Mr. Lovell’s acceptance ; and, in doing so, asked the
General Committee to break its own rules. Needless to say it would do nothing
of the kind ; and, though Mr. Lovell afterwards gave his assent to this doctrine,
the Committee was immovable.
The Chairman was also to encourage, and if he thought suitable, place John
Harper on trial for work among the Aborigines. He was informed that, as John
Hutchinson, the Superintendent of the Tonga Mission, was young and unor-
dained, he was directed and authorised, with the assistance of at least two of
the Preachers in full connection, to ordain Bro. John Hutchinson according to the
forms of the Church of England as it is used in our Chapels on those occasions.
We send you the usual form of certificate which you will date and fill up and
sign.”— {Committee s Despatches, p. yg.)
This interesting ceremony, the first ordination of a Wesleyan Minister in
Australasia is thus described: “In pursuance of the Committee’s special instruc-
tions we have publicly set apart to the work of the Ministry our worthy Bro.
Hutchinson. This solemn ceremony was performed in Macquarie Street Chapel,
Sydney, on Tuesday evening, the 25th April, 1826. We strictly adhered to the
plan observed at Plome, so far as our recollection would permit. Bro. Leigh ad-
dressed the congregation on the nature and importance of the ministerial office ;
Bro. Erskine proposed the questions, and delivered the charge ; Bro. Mansfield
read the Committee’s instructions ; Bros. Erskine, Leigh, and Mansfield laid on
hands ; and Bros. Horton and Thomas assisted in other parts of the service.
The statement given by Bro. Hutchinson of his conversion, call to the Ministry,
and views of Missionary work was clear, comprehensive, highly satisfactory, and
edifying. We were not, however, indulged with favourable weather the night
was excessively dark, and the ram descended in torrents ; hence the audience was
by no means so numerous as the novelty of the occasion would otherwise have
ensured, though it was larger and more respectable than we could expect

L pon those present a deep, and we trust, a salutary and permanent, impression
was produced. —(District Despatch Book , vol. i., p. 2.) The record also states
that on 1 uesday, the 2nd instant, Mr. Hutchinson was married to Miss Mary
Oakes, a member of the Society at Parramatta, whose father was one of the Lon-
don Missionary agents, who came out in The Dupf. To this union Mr. and Mrs.
Oakes “ cheerfully consented.”
The Chairman was also requested to inform intending candidates that they
must be prepared to go to any part of the world, though they could lay no
claim to an English Circuit. With William White, who was sent to assist Mr
1 urner in New Zealand, the Chairman had a delicate task to perform. The
Committee wished Mr. White to marry before he left England, but “ he was
capricious,” and would not. His lonely position and peculiar temptations
coupled with the fact that Mrs. Turner was the only European woman on the
Island, made it desirable that he should marry. With this object in view he paid
a visit to New South W ales. Not being successful, he made it known that in
two or three years time he intended to visit England. To this step the Com-
mittee strongly objected, and in a letter to the Chairman the Rev. Richard
Watson asks: “ Can you and the Brethren do anything for him ? Have you a
a suitable person ? ... If you can manage this affair prudently we shall
not object to his visiting you again, provided he can get suitably married.
I leave this to your prudence. Write him on the subject. . . If the thing
can be managed with you, zvell. If not, the case is painful.”— (Conimittee V
Despatches, p. 86.) Mr. White remained “ capricious,” and went to England,
where, much to the consternation of the Committee, he presented himself in the
latter end of the year 1825. “ Many members of the Committee were resolved to
mark his conduct by some severe resolution. So much so that some of us
trembled for his fate,” says the Rev. George Morley in one of his letters. But
the Committee met, fully considered all the circumstances of the case, and
agreed not to censure Mr. White, but allow him to return to New Zealand as
a married man, taking with him also “ the young person whom Bro. Hobbs had
requested might be sent out to him.” 4 But if it failed here the Committee was
not to be defeated elsewhere. It therefore laid down the rule that every candi-
date for the Ministry “ must, however, be told that he is subject to the rule which
forbids any steps to be taken with reference to marriage without consulting his-
Brethren. Parents must also give their consent. This you must carefully
impress upon him.” It will thus be seen that Mr. Erskine’s duties had a wide
and varied range.
The Financial Secretary, the Rev. William Horton, had his thoughts first
turned to Australia by a visit paid to his native town, Louth, by the Rev. Samuel
Leigh, when travelling in the interests of the proposed Mission to New Zealand.
Born in 1800, he was received into the Ministry at the age of 21, and came to
Australia in The Brixton in company with Mr. and Mrs. Leigh and the Rev.
William Walker. The needs of Hobart Town appealed so strongly to Mr. Leigh
4 This was Miss Brogriff.


that he resolved to leave Mr. Horton there. He was influenced by the fact that
the people were as sheep without a shepherd. They had turned a dwelling
house into a place of worship, capable of holding three hundred people. Mr.
Horton, assisted by his wife, laboured for two years and two months at Hobart
Town, obtaining access to the gaols and hospitals, which he regularly visited,
establishing a Sabbath School, teaching a night school in the penitentiary, and
laying the foundation of the first Wesleyan Chapel. “ Well and faithfully,”
says Heigh, “ did he discharge his duty in that flourishing Colony.” In October,
1823, he removed to Windsor, and three years afterwards was appointed to
Sydney with Mr. Mansfield. Another three years found him returning to Eng-
land (6th February, 1829), where he occupied several important Circuits until the
year 1852, when he became a Supernumerary.
Air. Horton’s duties as Treasurer brought him into frequent conflict with
the Committee, and finally led to his return. For example; he had to inform the
Committee officially that the Missionaries had increased their allowances and
raised their salaries, owing, so they said, to the dearness of provisions, bread
selling at is. 3d. per 2lb. loaf. So forcible was the criticism on one occasion on
the part of the General Committee that Mr. Horton expressed the fervent hope
that his Bills, which he admitted were exceptionally heavy, would not be dis-
honoured. But it came to that eventually. In their protests against excessive
expenditure the General Secretaries repudiated the idea that each Missionary
must necessarily be the best judge of his own requirements. The Mission in New
South Wales must be viewed as parts of a whole. The proposals set forth, and
the practice sought to be established, would lead to financial anarchy ; and, if
persisted in, “we are ruined,” pathetically said the Secretaries. When the
I reasurers did refuse to honour the Bills the Mission was precipitated into a
calamitous position, such as that which befel a London Mission agent through a
similar cause. Among the minor items of special expenditure was the sum of
£2O voted to the Rev. R. Mansfield as compensation for loss sustained through
the dishonesty of a convict servant. “ With the utmost circumspection it is
impossible to prevent them from pilfering. Bro. Mansfield has been singularly
unfortunate,” wrote Mr. Horton. Then there was the purchase of the gig for
the Chairman with the transference of a horse from the Aborigines Mission, for
which the sum of £s2 had been paid ; compensation for damage done by Mr.
Carvosso’s horse at Van Diemans’ Hand Circuit, costing the Committee A4l ;
heavy charges for medical attendance, amounting in one case to A3O, in another
to £6O ; AlO to be spent in books as a present to one who had shown a friendly
spirit to the Mission, and several other items, amounting in the aggregate to a
considerable sum. The expenses continued to creep up, and the Committee
repeatedly expressed disapproval; but the Missionaries were unwilling, or, if
willing, then unable to alter anything. Mr. Erskine sought to be relieved of his
position as Chairman ; a request which could not then be complied with. Mr.
Mansfield asked to return to England, and was told that his request should be
granted in three years’ time. Meanwhile, matters were growing worse, and the
relationships daily becoming more strained. In January, 1826, the sum of


£ioß6 18s. sd. had been drawn; an amount sufficient to satisfy all demands for
some time, so the Committee thought. But four months later a bill for £1520
was presented, £1256 18s. sd. going to the Tonga Mission. A total of £2606
for six months staggered the Committee, and brought forth this resolution:
“ The very heavy expenditure on this (N.S.W.) and other Missions, which we are
frequently obliged to meet when we least expect it, calls for the adoption of
decisive measures to remedy this great and growing evil ” The pruning knife
was at once brought into use, being applied first to the Missionaries’ allowances
recently increased by themselves.
If the Committee’s scale of allowances be given the reader can form his own
conclusions as to their adequacy or otherwise. The Committee shall speak for
itself. Resolved;—“ That the following shall be the allowances for ordinaries on
those stations, viz.: Board, per week, 275. sterling; quarterage, £j 10s. sterling;
ditto, wife’s, £5 10s. od. sterling; servant, per annum, £\o (?); additional
ditto, for two or more children, Tio (?); washing, per annum, £lO 10s.
That the maximum estimated for ordinaries for four Preachers (the only
number to be allowed in New South Wales and Van Dieman’s Land, and he who
may be appointed to the Aborigines of New South Wales) will, therefore, be
T750 sterling, taking the families as they are reported in the accounts now under
consideration. And that the maximum of allowance for extraordinaries to in-
clude rent, medical expenses, travelling expenses and all other incidental charges
in the Circuits be £250, the latter to be proportioned by the District Meeting
to the several stations according to their respective wants after careful and faithful
investigation.” The Committee adds that this amount of £250 is not to include
removals or repairs to Chapels and dwelling-houses. The former charge the
Committee would meet. The latter must be met by the respective Trusts.
The increases suggested and drawn by the Missionaries were Tioo per
annum for board, being an increase on the sum named by the Committee of
£2g 16s. per year; £\ per annum for stationery and postage, for which the
Committee had made no allowance whatever; and £l2 per year for washing,
being an advance of £1 10s. or a total increase of T35 odd. In the item termed
extraordinaries,” the Missionaries desired no limitation other than that of
absolute requirements. In the official communication setting forth their sugges-
tions, they said: “ Let our domestic establishments be accurately examined, and
weighed in the balances of fair Methodistical economy, and if retrenchment then
be deemed expedient, we shall cheerfully bow to the decree, and by redoubled
attention to the duties of self-denial, shew ourselves not unworthy of the Body to
which we glorv in belonging. This is admirable, and the spirit in which it is
conceived is excellent. But when the Committee weighed these suggested al-
lowances “ in the balances of the Methodistical economy ” and made known its
decision, the Missionaries did not “cheerfully bow to the decree,” neither did they
give “ redoubled attention to the duties of self-denial.” The hand that penned
such beautiful sentiments about the duties of self-denial so cheerfully to be
-endured soon wrote in a less exalted strain; We are almost tempted, sa\s the

official letter dated gth October, 1827, and bearing the signatures of George
Erskine, Samuel Leigh, Ralph Mansfield, and William Horton, “to send you
a culinary journal, and an inventory of ‘goods and chattels/ The bread-and-
buttei toi breakfast the plain joint and potatoes, with the sober beverage
of toast and water for dinner— the repetition of breakfast for tea— and the
crust of dry bread for supper —a catalogue like this might, like a talisman,
dissolve those visions of Australian luxury which some unfriendly sprite seemed
to ha\ e conjured up at Hatton Gardens. But, beloved Brethren, we will not
thus trifle with your patience.” This, however, reads like trifling ; and its perusal
must ha\e taxed the patience of the Committee. For its members knew full well
that the men who endorsed the gloomy description of their Secretary were very
tar from that state his imagination so vividly pictured, and then so graphically
described. Within the space of twelve months, and even while asking for in-
creased allowances they requested the Committee to purchase a large number
of valuable and expensive books for their private libraries. He who was most
prominent in this agitation ordered 47 books, some of them of the most expen-
sive kind, and not absolutely necessary to the work of a Missionary. And, let
it be some were to be “ bound in calf.” As a rule, valuable editions of
the classics “ bound m calf ” are not the things most to be desired by men reduced
to “ a crust of dry bread for supper.”
Meanwhile, what was being done to bring the income within sight of the
expenditure." As an indication, take the returns for the year 1829. when the
crisis had come. Sydney Circuit, temporarily in charge of Mr. Leigh, yielded
the following amounts —Class Money, £ll 2s. 2d.; Ticket Money, A2 4 ’ios. 4 d. ;
Quarterly Collections, A 33 Bs. 3d. ; Subscriptions, AIOO 10s. 6d. ; giving a total
of £i6g 10s. 6d. for the year. The expenditure reached A 185 is. 6d, showing
a deficiency of Als 10s. Parramatta Circuit, under the supermtendency of Mr.
Erskine, shows Class Money A3 is. ud. ; Ticket Money, A 4 17s. 6d. ; Quarterly
Collections, A 5 5s- > total income for the y<?ar, Al3 4 s. 3d- Expenditure,
A3ll ns. Bd., giving a deficiency of A 298 6s. 6d. The expenditure includes the
sum of Ai 4 for travelling expenses, and A 23 10s. gd. for medical attendance.
Windsor Circuit, then in charge of Mr. Hutchinson, who had just returned from
Tonga, returned Class Money Ai Bs. id. ; Ticket Money, £2 is. id.; total for the
year, A3 9 s - 2d. Expenditure, AlB4. i 4 s., showing a deficiency of AlB3 4 s. iod. 5
The culminating point was reached when the case of another candidate
for the Ministry was under discussion. The New South Wales District concluded
that it had power to encourage, accept and then appoint suitable agents from
among the Colonial youth. In arriving at this conclusion it was warranted, its
members argued, by the words of the Committee itself. For instance the Com-
mittee had said: “ You must encourage the talents of young men, who may
0 It must be clearly borne in mind that though the names of Samuel Leigh and John
Hutchinson in connection with these balance sheets they were not responsible
for the income. Their appointments were merely temporary. Having returned, the
one from New Zealand, the other from Tonga, they were waiting a Conference appoint-
ment, Mr. Mansfield of Sydney having resigned and Mr. Horton of Windsor having
left for England. The men who must receive either jpraise or blame, as the reader may
decide, are George Erskine, Ralph Mansfield, and William Horton.


act first as Local Preachers, and furnish a native supply for the regular Ministry,
under the regulations we have adopted on other stations. Methodism must make
its own way among you as at home, with some small dillerences in arrangement,
none in principle. The Brethren will do well, therefore, to foster the zeal and
gifts of young men of character under their care.” —(General Secretary,
September 20, 1823.) And in plainer words still the Committee wrote
again: “As your Societies increase, men will be raised up to aid you in your
work, and to spread it through the Islands of the South Seas. . . . Keep your
eye on this great end ; nurse those important Missions, and nurse men up for
them.”—(Letter to Chairman, October sth, 1824.) these official deliver-
ances had already, in some cases, been put into effect. And the Committee
had expressed its approval. “ From among the settlers,” says the Report (1824,
p. 27), “ some respectable young men of useful talents have been raised up as
Assistants to the Brethren in various departments of their work ; two of whom
have gone out to take a share in the Mission in New Zealand and the Friendly
Islands.” The report for the year following speaks in the same strain: “And it
is from the enlargement of the influence of religion in these Colonies, that we
are mainly to look for future Missionaries, schoolmasters and pious artisans,
whose mercantile intercourse with the British-Austrahan possessions is becoming
every year more frequent and important.” On this point then, there seems no
want of harmony. And yet when the New South Wales District accepted a
candidate and appointed him to a station the Committee commented in terms
that were “ so extraordinarily painful, that it will require no common degree of
self-denial to repress .... those fervid feelings which they could hardly fail
to enkindle in the best regulated breast.” The “censures” administered were
“ severe and unexpected.”
What was there in this case specially to merit such language ? Mr. Weiss,
for that was the name .of the young man, is described as a youth of “ superior
education ” which fitted him for an expeditious acquirement of a new language.
As a Naval Officer he had developed a “love of order and subordination,” and
given evidence of “presence of mind and invincible courage.” He also possessed
“ a thorough knowledge of navigation,” “ readiness in the use of the pen,” was
soundly converted full of ‘‘ zeal,” loved “ our doctrines and discipline,” and pos-
sessed qualifications of a peculiar order,” all of which proved his “ admirable
fitness for the Tonga Station,” where the presence of such a man was highly
desirable. Wherein, then lay the objection? Not in the man; for of him the
Committee cordially approved. But the District Meeting had again acted con-
trary to rule. Mr. Weiss, who w T as a widower, was allowed to marry. The rule
said that Missionaries on probation must not marry without the Committees’
consent; which, in this case was not even sought. The Tonga Mission was
under the management of the New Zealand District, and was therefore outside
the control of the New South Wales Brethren. Nevertheless the appointment
was discussed in their District Meeting, and some of its members voted bn the
appointment. This was so clearly outside the range of their duty that the Rev.
George Morley, in a letter to the Chairman (October 26, 1827) says: “ If you or

>oui colleagues either advised or encouraged, or even tacitly consented to the
measure, or did not do all in your power, either as a District or as individuals
to oppose it, you can never throw off the responsibility.” The New South Wales
District had also, to borrow the words of the Committee, sent Mr. Weiss “to
Fongataboo ; a vessel being chartered to take him there at an expense of £250,
resides an outfit sent with him of ‘ a full year’s supplies/ ” 6
The District Meeting maintained that the supplies were necessary, that
they did not charter the vessel specially to convey Mr. Weiss to Tonga, and
that had there been no Mr. Weiss, nor any passenger at all, the necessity for
sending the vessel would have been just the same, and we should still have char-
tered hei as a matter of course. ’ But therein lies the cause of the trouble. They
took too much “as a matter of course.” They accepted John Lovell “as a
matter of course.” They raised their own salaries and increased their allowances
“as a matter of course.” And they appointed a Missionary to a District over
which they had no official control, and for which they were not responsible, “as
a matter of course.” And as a still further “ matter of course ” the Committee
objected to its agents acting on their own responsibility while the Committee had
to honour the Bills and to find the cash. The Missionaries’ duties were plain.
They had promised to walk by rule ; and they were the servants of the Com-
mittee, which to them, stood in the place of Conference. Their only safe course

Thomas and Hutchinson advised him not to land, and sent him back immediately.

down.


was to obey those set over them ; but this they did not “ as a matter of course.”
The Committee may have blundered on more than one occasion ; but for the
Committee’s mistakes the Missionaries would not be held responsible. As
the Committee pointed out there would be an end of all discipline and order, if
rules and regulations were thus constantly set at nought.
In a lengthy communication the Missionaries sought, in justification of their
action, to prove: “ (i) That we had the power to take out Missionaries without
waiting the Committee’s sanction, provided we thought it necessary, and duly
informed the candidate that his appointment was only provisional. (2) That to
take out Missionaries was not only our delegated right, but when opportunity
served our special duty. (3) That we were justified in exercising that right, and
discharging that duty, in the particular instance of Mr. Weiss. (4) That we were
not responsible for Mr. Weiss’ ultimate appointment. This is our defence,” con-
cluded this epistle. “ Sophistry and disguise we abhor and have religiously
shunned .... And in the integrity of our cause we have unbounded confidence.
We have therefore nothing to fear; for if the preceding pages only secure a
PATIENT PERSUAL or a PATIENT HEARING, sure we are, that for a
proceeding thus explained and thus vindicated, you will never persist in loading
us with the disgrace of your censures, and with a burden of expense which*must
reduce us to beggary, or throw us into gaol.” The authors of this vindication
must have totally misconceived the spirit and purpose of the Missionary Com-
mittee if they thought the matter was to be settled thus. The Committee now
proceeded to stronger measures than censure.
Its first step was to dishonour the Bills which had entailed such heavy
responsibility ; making the Missionaries personally responsible for the expenses
they had incurred, thus bringing matters to a standstill. They next reconsidered
the question at a meeting held May 21st, 1828, and re-affirmed their previous de-
cision in the following*words;—“The interference of the Brethren of the New
South Wales District with the stations of the New Zealand District, except by
respectful suggestions to the Committee, must be regarded as obtrusive and ir-
regular, and when accompanied by the assumption of a right to the appointment
of Missionaries, as in the case of Mr. Weiss, is deserving of the strongest expres-
sions of disapprobation. The great increase of expenditure proposed for the
Missions in Australasia they regard as utterly impracticable and unwarranted
by any success which has hitherto attended the Australasian Missions,
and they view the scheme relative to the constant employment of a vessel in the
South Seas under the direction of the Missionary Committee as altogether pre-
mature and inexpedient under existing circumstances.” —{Letter Book , pp. 27, 28.}
At the same meeting the Committee delivered its mind on the conduct of the
members of the Quarterly Meetings at Sydney, Parramatta and Windsor, who
had, doubtless, at the instigation of the Missionaries themselves, expressed their
views on the insufficiency of the allowances. After stating its “ surprise at the
extraordinary remarks and address,” the Committee directed the Missionaries “to
inform the official persons who have signed the address, that, under no circum-
stances whatever, can the Committee recognise the prerogative so improperly

and erroneously claimed in the circumstances now before them of exercising
control over the distribution of the funds entrusted to the care of the Committee
for the propagation of the Gospel throughout the world, and that they must
therefore abide by the regulations transmitted. ”
This decision advanced matters another step. Mr. Horton took the reins
m his own hands ; and, contrary to the advice of his Chairman and Mr. Carvosso,
returned to England, where he sought permission to state his case, and that of
the Brethren to the Members of the Committee. Fins permission was granted,
and Mr. Horton commenced his defence of his return home by quoting certain
resolutions from a letter of the Secretaries to the following effect, viz: That
if the Missionaries cannot live on the allowances fixed, “they may all come home” ;
and that if the grant of £IOOO will not support four Missionaries, “they may all
come home together.” These expressions, Mr. Horton argued, sufficiently war-
ranted his return without waiting for the Committee’s permission; and he
therefore inferred that as he had not returned without leave he had a right to
be heard in his own defence. The Committee was of the opinion that Mr. Horton
had failed to make out a ground of right to be heard in justification of himself;
but as an act of courtesy it was willing to give him ‘‘ a patient and careful
hearing.”
The hearing was given, and the explanation made, in which Mr. Horton
stated that he was fully justified in returning home after the Committee’s ex-
pressions ; that the allowances were altogether inadequate to the becoming


maintenance of a Missionary, proof of which was found in a document produced
bearing the signatures of several Sydney residents ; that when the Committee
received their remonstrances against the limitations of allowances he expected
a considerable addition would be made ; and that the Committee’s refusal to do
this left him no other course than to come home and plead his own cause. The
case was “fully considered,” with the result that the Committee was “unanimous-
ly of the opinion that he has entirely failed in making out a justification of his
breach of Rules ” ; and “ they therefore refer his case to the London District
Meeting to be reported to the Conference.” The language of the circular written
and published in Sydney by Mr. Horton, they considered neither respectful to the
Committee nor candid towards the Missionary Brethren. The strictures it con-
tained upon their judgment and proceedings “ seem utterly unbecoming and
unfounded,” while the severity and censure with which the character and abilities
of several excellent Brethren are described they regard as manifesting an almost
total want of that tenderness, caution, and brotherly kindness which ought, on
all occasions, to mark the conduct of Christian Missionaries towards each other.”
The action of the New South Wales District in calling out Mr. Weiss met with
their reprobation, notwithstanding Mr. Horton’s explanations. The interference
with the stations of the New Zealand District was “regarded as obtrusive and
irregular,” and when accompanied by the assumption of a right to the appoint-
ment of Missionaries was deserving of the “ strongest expressions of disappro-
bation.” And at a later meeting it adds that there was no sufficient necessity for
the calling out of Mr. Weiss, and “ they therefore fully confirmed all the censure
which they have already passed on the case.” The great increase of expendi-
ture proposed the Committee again pronounced “ as utterly impracticable and
unwarranted by any success which has hitherto attended the Australasian
Missions.”
At the Conference of 1829, Mr. Horton’s breach of discipline in having left
his station without leave from the Committee, and having printed and circulated
“ a mischievous letter ” reflecting in a “ very impertinent and unbecoming manner
upon the General Secretaries,” was dealt with. The Conference expelled Mr.
Horton, but in view of the fact that he expressed “ deep sorrow ” and declared
that, had he possessed better information he would have acted very differently, he
was admonished from the Chair, re-admitted on trial, and appointed for two years
to an English Circuit under the care of a Superintendent. From that day to the
date of his death, which took place in the year 1867, his conduct was most ex-
emplary ; and this momentary indiscretion of youth and inexperience was the
only blot upon an otherwise successful career.
The Chairman, the Rev. George Erskine, remained in New South Wales
some time after Mr. Horton’s departure. In 1831, the Committee having again
considered “ the languishing state of the New South Wales Mission,” felt it their
“ imperative duty ” to call Mr. Erskine home forthwith for insufficiency “ for
Mission work in general and the duties of Chairman of the District in particular.”
The Irish Conference was to receive notice that in 1532, it must provide a Circuit
for Mr. Erskine ; while the Committee took steps to secure a suitable person to

succeed him as soon as possible. 7 Mr. Erskine, however, did not return to Eng-
land. He became a Supernumerary; and as already stated, died at Erskineville
in the year 1834- He was buried where he died. The Rev. Joseph Orton, who
frequently visited him, says: ‘ I visited him on several occasions during his last
illness, and found him the subject of severe temptation j under the influence of
which his mind was much clouded. On the Sunday previous to his death, by his
request 1 administered to him the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper, from which
ordinance he professed to receive much comfort. During the ensuing week he
was at times exceedingly depressed and harrowed with doubts as to his interest
m the Redeemer’s blood. I am, however, happy in being able to state that his
last moments were those of peace. A short time before he breathed his last I
enquired whether his prospects were brighter, and if he now felt an interest in
the Redeemer’s blood ; and with an expiring effort, requiring all the energy of
his remaining physical strength, he replied in the affirmative. I was with him
when he died.”
The Rev. R. Mansfield, though not lost to Methodism, passed from the ranks
of the ministry and made his home in Sydney, where in various ways he rendered
valuable service to the Church. Mr. Mansfield shall speak for himself. In a
letter to his Chairman from Windsor bearing date 27th October, 1828, he says;
“ It is with the deepest regret that I now resign the office of a Wesleyan Mis-
sionary; in doing which I beg to offer the following observations: 1. My resig-
nation is not in the proper sense of the term voluntary. lam not weary of my
sacred work, nor am I conscious of having in any way rendered myself unworthy
of my office, or of the confidence or affection of the body to which I belong.
From the commencement of my Missionary labours to the present hour I have
faithfully endeavoured to carry into full effect all the Committee’s plans, and to
7 The Committee passed the following resolutions:—“ That the best mode of bring-
ing the expenditure of the South Sea Missions within proper limit would be to commit
the superintendence of them to a Brother of some standing in the Connexion and of
acknowledged talents for business; by whose judgment and vigilance all unnecessary
expenses might be prevented; and that it is desirable to find a preacher of this descrip-
tion willing to undertake the office as soon as possible. That Mr. Orton be forthwith
appointed to the District of New South Wales as Chairman, and that such assistance be
given to him and his family in the way of outfit as the Secretaries may find necessary.”


obey the very letter of their instructions, and for the truth of this declaration 1
can fearlessly appeal to yourself and my other coadjutors, and am fully assured
that you will readily confirm it by your testimony. But the Committee in re-
stricting our allowances to a sum on which I find it impracticable for myself and
family to subsist on a footing equally respectable with our Preachers at Home
and essential to the Ministerial character in this country, and especially in in-
sisting upon my bearing a proportion of the expenses of Mr. Weiss and of the
dishonoured bills of the New Zealand District: have imposed conditions with
which I am altogether unable to comply, and have broken one of the mam
conditions on which I entered into their service, viz:—To pay an affectionate
regard to all my wants, and to afford them every reasonable and necessary
supply. My resignation, therefore, is not spontaneous but compulsory. I for-
mally resign, but am virtually expelled. 2. My resignation is coupled
with certain conditions, but they are such as cannot be disposed of
by an authority but that of the Conference or Committee, and there-
fore I need not submit them to the District Meeting. 3. I by
no means retire from the Connexion; of that I trust I shall live
and die an humble, but faithful Member. 4. Ido not resign the Ministerial
Office, but simply that of a Wesleyan Missionary. As a local Preacher I hope
that I may still be useful to the cause of God. I shall consider it as much as
ever my duty to devote myself to the utmost extent of my time and ability to the
great and holy work in which you are engaged. Sincerely wishing you and your
colleagues every blessing, and recommending myself to your united and
earnest prayer.” 8
His removal was a great loss ; for though somewhat disputatious and ag-
gressive, he was a good man, an eloquent Preacher, and the possessor of a fine
literary faculty and organising powers, which made him a most desirable acqui-
sition to the ranks of the Missionaries. But this unfortunate understanding
unsettled him. Subsequent correspondence, bearing on his return took place.
“ In my letter of resignation,” he said “ I made a most distinct offer to return if
I could be honourably received. I know not what more I could do, nor that I
can now do anything, but repeat the same declaration. I retired by compulsion,
and have ever since regretted that so painful a sacrifice should have been
necessary; and certainly it is my wish to stand again among you as a Brother
beloved. My present situation is in many respects very advantageous, and puts
considerable power of usefulness into my hands ; but if you open the way for
my honourable restoration, my conscience would not permit me to hesitate.
Money I care not for. Were my income a thousand times more than it is I
should gladly exchange it for the slender stipend of a useful and esteemed
Travelling Preacher. . . . Assuring you that the work of God lies as near my
heart as ever, and that it is my ruling wish to live for the promotion of His
glory in the earth.” This letter was considered by the Committee in the year
8 Mr. Mansfield filled several prominent positions outside the Church. He was
joint-editor with Dr. John Shlotsky of the First New South Wales Magazine, editor of
The Sydney Gazette: kept one of the four large book stores in town; and originated and
carried to a successful issue the Sydney Gas Works.


1830, when its members declared that they would gladly take his case into
their favourable consideration,” when he presented himself under other views
and feelings than those hitherto evinced. Mr. Mansfield’s conditions for restora-
tion were that he should be allowed to return to an English Circuit.
The Committee said he must be prepared to accept an appointment to
any station ; and that the moneys which it considered had been overdrawn for
allowances must be refunded. Mutual concessions, though necessary were not
forthcoming, and though Mr. Mansfield wrote again in 1831, neither party would
yield, and the severance became final.
It will be needless to tell the observant reader that during this night
of gloom the work of God in the Mission fared ill. Strife is not conducive to
success ; and recrimination is not the atmosphere best suited to the development
of Christian work. 1 here was little to report, or if there to report it was not
done ; during this period the sole record of work the Committee saw fit to re-
produce is a somewhat indifferent story forwarded by Mr. Horton from Windsor
during the year 1825. In his Journal he writes;—
March 14. —I revived our Windsor Sunday-School, which was first estab-
lished by Brother Carvosso, but afterwards relinquished for want of a suitable
person to conduct it. Sixteen children attended.
April 2nd.—l went with the Rev. John Cross, the Chaplain, who resides at
Windsor, to Wilberforce, to form a Bible Association for that District; but such
is the apathy of the people, that only two attended the meeting ; so that we
could scarcely do anything.
April 11th.—At Sackville Reach, I first examined the children of the Sunday
School, about seventeen in number. In general they answered my questions
very pertinently, and I distributed among them a few rewards. I was pleased
to find that several of them have good voices, and are learning to sing. The con-
gregation assembled at eleven o’clock, and were, as usual very attentive and
serious.
June 24th. —I visited several families in the vicinity of Sackville Reach,
giving a word of advice to each. The Chapel at this place is not yet finished ;
but we now expect it soon will be, as the Archdeacon, with whom I have had
several interviews on the subject, and who has personally visited the School,
engages to use his influence with the Government in procuring for us the
pecuniary assistance for which we have applied.
June 27th. —The inhabitants of Sackville Reach have solicited me, by a
petition, to preach to them every month ; which I shall henceforth endeavour to
do. Forty persons were present at the service this morning. The children of
the School have made great improvement during the last quarter. Eleven read
to me very well in the New Testament, which not one child could do three
months ago ; and a year since scarcely any knew the alphabet.
July 17th. —Our friend Mr. Scott and I called on several families between
Castlereagh and Emu Plains, with a view to form a Sunday School. There are
about a dozen children old enough to be instructed, but they do not know a letter.


MANLY CHURCH.
The parents are all willing to send their children except one. A horrid circum-
stance occurred in this neighbourhood last week. A dispute arose between two
men who were at work in the bush, when one of them hit the other, and then
threw him on the fire, where he was so much burnt that he died a few days
after.
August 30th. —Mr. Leigh, who is somewhat recovered, came to Windsor
this morning, and accompanied me the following week to my several appoint-
ments. On Friday we visited Brother and Sister Walker at Blacktown, and
examined the children. There are two boys and five girls, of whom two are
mulattos. They read tolerably well, and repeated portions of the Scriptures
and hymns, which they had committed to memory: their needlework was exe-
cuted very neatly.
September 25th. —This morning we held a Leader’s Meeting, at which
three companies of visitors were formed, and spheres of labour assigned to
each. Their duty is to call at every house in their respective districts, to give
religious advice to the family, to distribute among them some Religious Tracts,
and invite them to attend the house of God. Provision is thus made for per-
vading in this manner about one-third of the Circuit.
The District Minutes disclose nothing of a startling or very encouraging
nature. They tell of some expulsions in the Sydney Society through evil-speak-
ing, which was then rife ; of occasional times of refreshing at the Lovefeasts ;
of the influence of religion spreading at Castlereagh, and of the loss to this place
through the removal of John Lees to Sydney; of a new Chapel at Sackville


Reach, supplied alternately by Mr. Horton and Mr. Meares, the Anglican Chap-
lain ; and of the opening of the new Chapel at Richmond, particulars of which
were given in The Sydney Gazette (Nov. 12th, 1828.) “For many years,” Mr.
Harper there says, “ have the Wesleyan Missionaries regularly performed
Divine Service at Richmond. For a long time they were kindly accommodated
with the use of the Government School House, but as its situation is very in-
convenient, they afterwards met their congregation in.a.private house. They
at length resolved to build a Chapel. A good piece of ground in the central
part of the town was obtained, and the first stone laid on the 24th July by the
Rev. George Erskine, who preached a very appropriate sermon from Christ’s
words, ‘ One thing is needful.’ This neat little structure has lately been
finished; it is built of brick, and capable of accommodating 70 or 80
persons. It was opened for Divine worship on Tuesday, the 30th ultimo, on
which occasion the Rev. Samuel Leigh, from Parramatta, preached to a large
and respectable audience in the morning, and the Rev. George Erskine, from
Windsor, in the evening. The texts were taken from John xvii., 3, and
1 Samuel xii., 24. The sermons were appropriate, impressive, and edifying. The
collections amounted to £lO 15s. zod. The morning service was rendered par-
ticularly interesting by the baptism of three young women, the daughters of an
old and respectable settler in the neighbourhood.”
The establishment of a Floating Chapel not having been accomplished,
several captains kindly lent their vessels as a substitute, in which the Mission-
aries frequently preached. Regular services were also conducted at the
Benevolent Asylum, and a “new station” at South Head was taken up in 1827.
“ The Lighthouse is our Chapel, and the persons composing its establishment,
together with the Pilots and their families, form our congregation.” The Car-
ter’s Barracks, a Government institution for juvenile offenders, received atten-
tion and regular services. But for the most part the work was disheartening,
with but little promise of success and development. A few matters
of a more public character are also recorded. For instance, on tne
departure of the Governor, Sir Thomas Brisbane, on December 3* s b 1825,
the Missionaries presented a farewell address ; and on the arrival of his successor,
Lieut-General Ralph Darling, they submitted an address of congratulation, both
of which received courteous acknowledgment. The Sydney Sunday School
Union also recommended to. the District Meeting the expediency of establishing
a Day School, assigning as its reasons“lst. The greater part of the children
of the poor being educated in Free Schools are required to attend tac same on
the Sabbath day, and are thus entirely debarred from the instruction of the Wes-
leyan Sunday Schools. 2nd. Such an instruction would be a permanent nursery
to the Whole Connexion in this part of the world. ’
Upon this subject the District Meeting resolved: “1. This proposal meets our
warm approbation, there being many families in this Colony who would prefer for
their children the instruction of the Methodists to that of any other denomination,
and feeling convinced that there is not in the Colony any Day School m which


education is so decidedly and specially spiritual as we should consider indis-
pensable. 2. But as it is not at present in our power to raise an adequate fund,
we would respectfully recommend to the Committee, that £lOO per annum be
for a few years allowed out of the proceeds of our Auxiliary Missionary Society.
We calculate upon raising a further sum of by immediate subscription ;
and from the high importance which the respectable inhabitants attach to the
moral instruction of the young, we doubt not that in a few years the whole
expense would be defrayed, without prejudice to our Mission Fund. 3. We
v ould also request the Committee to encourage a well educated Local Preacher
to come out for the purpose of taking charge of the School. He would in a
variety of ways be essentially serviceable to the Society; and we would guaran-
tee a salary of at least £l5O per annum, with a fair prospect of gradual in-
crease. The education of the Preacher’s children, and those of our respectable
nends, would open a certain source of additional income.”
But nothing came of these resolutions. The District Meeting (1826),
which dealt with this important question also authorised the Sydney Preachers
to procure a piece of land for the Methodist Burial Ground, also asserting their
rights and setting forth the advisability of the Missionaries conducting the
rnainage ceremony. By availing themselves of this right, already recognised
by the Colonial Council, “ we should raise the respectability of our cause,” and
do some good, and no evil.” Some attempt was also made to “ regularly
settle the Trust properties, though the efforts were not successful. The Dis-
trict Meeting (December, 1826), considered it expedient to appoint a provisional
oody of Trustees for the general management of affairs, and particularly for
the purpose of facilitating legal settlement. The following names were there-
fore submitted to the General Committee as Trustees ;—Sydney: All the
Preachers m the Colony, for the time being; and Messrs. George Allen, Captain
Beveridge, James Blanch, Robert Howe, John Tawell, Thomas Hyndes, John
Lees, James Scott, George Smith, and Samuel Terry. Parramatta: All the
Preachers ; and Messrs. James Burns, junr., Harvey, Richard Hawkes, Richard
unt, Thomas Moore, William Shelley, James Shepherd, senr., Francis Oakes,
and William White. Windsor: All the Preachers; and Messrs. Henry Butts-
worth, Joseph Harpur, Matthew Hughes, William Price, Henry Stockfish, John
Tebbutt, senr., and Thomas Tebbutt. But this also was among the slaughtered
innocents ; and this recommendation, like all others from that District Meeting,
so fruitful m suggestions, was pigeon-holed by the merciless Committee.
These records of five or six years’ work by four Missionaries did not inspire
the General Committee with high hopes for the future. And in the year 1820
they were told that as the work had not extended according to anticipation,
the great expenditure was not warranted ; and two Missionaries would be with-
drawn, if, during the next year proof were not forthcoming that the work could
be greatly extended. The officials in the Sydney Circuit were also informed
that henceforth one Missionary only could be stationed in Sydney. Against
111s decision the Stewards made a respectful protest; which being stripped of
preliminaries is worthy of reproduction because of the sidelights thrown on the
work of the Mission. The petition reads:

GRAFTON CHURCH.
“ Is b In the town of Sydney are two Chapels, or places of worship, to be
supplied with Preachers in the forenoon and evening of every Sabbath ; and on
two other evenings of the week ; and also the vessels belonging to the Bethel
I nion, where service has to be performed every Sunday Morning, exclusive
of these places in the heart of the town. There are also other stations of con-
siderable importance calling forth the energies of our Preachers ; one is the
Benevolent Asylum, where service is performed, on the morning of the Sunday,
and on every Thursday afternoon, and where there are not less than from
eighty to one hundred souls far advanced in life. The other is South Head,
distant from Sydney about seven miles, at which place Divine Worship is cele-
brated on the forenoon of the Sabbath. 2nd. There is considerable
labour to be performed by the Preachers in Sydney exclusive of
preaching the Gospel, calling on the members in Society, visiting
the sick, and attending to the various secular affairs connected with the
Mission, not only more immediately belonging to this place, but also to those
of Van Dieman’s Land, New Zealand, and Tongataboo, etc, etc. By which
a great portion of the time of the Missionaries residing at Sydney is consumed
in corresponding and managing Circuits. 3rd. On account of the infant site
of the Methodist Society in New South Wales, there are, very few persons quali-
fied to take the office of Local Preacher, Exhorter, or Leader—thus leaving the
Missionaries without those valuable auxiliaries the Travelling Preachers usually


enjoy.” The following signatures were attached:—George Allen (Circuit
Steward), John Brown, George Smith, John Beveridge (Society Stewards), James
Scott, John Lees (Leaders), R. Mansfield.
The Missionary Meeting of that year was held in Macquarie Street Chapel
(October sth. 1829). The report said: —“Since your Auxiliary was established,
nine years ago, we have on record every possible evidence that thousands have
aeen brought to embrace the sinner’s only refuge ; and that multitudes having
washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb ’ have
passed into the heavenly world adding new gems to the Redeemer’s crown and
causing angelic legions to sing with higher rapture: ‘ Glory to God in the
highest; on earth peace, good-will towards men 9 . These are the true sources
of our joys and encouragements ; these fill our hearts with gratitude and our
lips with praise ; and while recounting these trophies of Missionary warfare,
we ‘ thank God and take courage.’ ” Mr. Leigh, who submitted the balance
sheet, said that the receipts for the past year amounted to three hundred guineas,
and that since the foundation of the Auxiliary, £2,655 IIS - nd. had been raised
in the Colony alone for Missionary purposes.
The demand for Missionaries increasing on all hands, a strong appeal was
made to the Committee, urging it to strengthen and extend the work in
the South Seas. The Rev. George Morley thus replied to Mr. Leigh: “Your
own very interesting letter, one from Captain Henry, and one from Tonga,
arrived by the same post, were read to the Committee on the same day, and
produced a most electrifying effect; for, though they had voted away all the
money they had received, or expected to receive, and had even gone beyond
their most sanguine expectations as to the annual income of the Society, they
at once resolved to send four additional Missionaries to your quarter of the
world. One is to be a surgeon ; another a printer We are looking out
for the men ; but have not yet found them. No time, however, will be lost,
and I hope we shall soon succeed. As your labours are wanted in the Colony,
the Committee wish you to remain until you hear from them again.”-—( Leigh's
Life , pp. 357-8-) These seasonable auxiliaries were unable to meet the pres-
sing necessities of Tonga and the other Islands, to say nothing of the new pro-
vince in Western Australia founded that year with Captain Stirling as Governor.
Not including the Aborigines, at the end of the first year, there were twelve
hundred persons in the new settlement.
The year 1831 was a sad one for Mr. Leigh. An epidemic of unusual
malignity visited the Colony, and Parramatta did not escape its ravages. Mrs.
Leigh, who considered not her own safety, was unusually sedulous in her atten-
tions to the sick and dying. She fell a victim to the common scourge, and after
much suffering, endured with calm resignation, she peacefully passed away.
She was buried in the Anglican burial ground at Parramatta ; and this inscrip-
tions marks her resting place: —
9 This refers specially to the gracious revival in the Islands.


“ Sacred to the memory of Catherine, the beloved wife of the Rev.
Samuel Leigh, the first Missionary to these Colonies and New Zea-
land. She followed her blessed Master’s example, in going about
doing good, deservedly loved and esteemed by all who knew her;
and died in peace on the 15th May, 1831.”
For a time Leigh was inconsolable. Previously broken in health, he was
now much humbled in spirit. He had lost one, who, like himself, possessed the
Missionary’s heart. When about to sail for New Zealand with her husband,
friends in Sydney suggested the propriety of waiting until the cessation of
hostilities which were then at their height. “ Samuel,” she said, “ I have heard
nothing that has shaken my confidence in God. Our friends at home expect
us to do our duty. Notwithstanding the kindness of Christian Brethren here,
I shall not be happy another day in the Colony. We are prepared for death
or life in the discharge of our duty.” Duty was done and death came ; but
with it came also the martyr’s crown- —that crown worn by many a noble woman,
who, as the wife of a Wesleyan Missionary, has died in the service of Christ.
Soon after this trial, Leigh bid a final farewell to Australia and returned to
England, where he laboured successfully for some years. In 1852 he was on
his death bed. “ I wish to be wholly sanctified.” he said. “ I want to be saved
this very night. Do pray that I may be fully saved this very night.” To the
remark of a friend, he replied: “ The change will, indeed, be wonderful; but
all will be well And as it regards returned Missionaries, Dr. Coke will be at
the head of us.” Utterance failing, he quietly breathed his last on May 2nd,
1852, aged 66 years. He was interred in Reading Cemetery.
During this year (1831), the Mission received an impetus through a short
visit from the Rev. Nathaniel Turner who had removed from Tonga and was
awaiting an appointment. As there was a furnished house vacant at Parra-
matta, it was deemed best that Mr. Turner should live there and labour chiefly
in that Circuit. He thus records his impressions: “ Mr. Leigh was reduced to
great weakness both of body and mind, and was utterly unfit for any ministerial
duty. Our Church in New South Wales was now a wreck, and the faithful few
in our Israel, mourned the desolations of Zion. Windsor was left without any-
one to conduct the services of the sanctuary.” —(The Pioneer Missionary , p. 130)
At. Parramatta he found “much, very much, to discourage, and some things
at which his heart sickened.” Nevertheless, there were a few who cheerfully united
with him in crying: “ Come, O breath, and breathe upon these slam, that they
may live ; ” a heavenly influence soon attended the word and the congregations
increased. Meanwhile, the Revs. J. A. Manton and W. Simpson arrived in Syd-
ney for Colonial work (August 31st, 1831), and Mr. Turner was appointed to
Hobart Town, Mr. Manton taking his place at Parramatta. But before he left
he was called on to part with his infant child, who had been seriously ill during
the protracted voyage from Tonga. The child was buried in the same grave as
Mrs. Leigh in the Anglican Church Cemetery.

CHAPTER VI.
THE MISSION TO THE ABORIGINES
THE origin of the Aborigines of Australia has given rise to much specu-
lation, in which three theories have been enunciated with varying
earnestness and ingenuity. They are, say some, a remnant of the
ancient Canaanites; others maintain they are of Ethiopian origin;
while a third party sees in them descendants of .the lost tribes of Israel.
Certainly some of their customs closely resemble those of Jewish and Oriental
nations. Advocates of a later date argue that they are of Malayan origin, having
through long isolation, developed into a distinct Papuan race. Count Strzelecki
affirms that the Aborigine “ does not exhibit any features by which his race
could be classified or identified with any of the generally known families of
mankind.” And Flanagan adds : “ Conjecture and analogy alone remain to
guide the enquirer in any investigation touching the original inhabitants of
the Australian wilds.” —( Aborigines of Australia, p. 2.) This is so, and all
attempts to place them are futile. In any case, in this connection it is immaterial.
Suffice it here to state, that the first settlers found the Aboriginal in possession
of this country, where, like Defoe’s exile, he was undisputed monarch of the
vast territory over which he roamed. It is conjectured that then the Aborigines
numbered 100,000, though their nomadic life makes accuracy in this particular
impossible. Flanagan says that half a million would not overstate their number.
Of great variety in stature, of many shades of colour, ranging from copper to
ebony, and filthy in his habits, this poor creature was found on the lowest level
of heathenism ; from which, unfortunately, all the arts of civilization and
the influences of Christianity combined have failed to raise him. In the instances
where reformation has been accomplished it has often been temporary only ;
for the Aboriginal unswervingly gravitates to his original state. Falling back
before the white man’s approach, the time is not far distant when he will dis-
disappear. With fatal facility he acquires the white man’s vices ; his virtues,
where discoverable, he fails to imitate.
That his white brother has much to answer for in his treatment of this
untutored savage is, unfortunately, beyond dispute. Under the most trifling,
and frequently without any provocation whatever, he has been cruelly shot down
or butchered without compunction. At Mount Rouse (Victoria), even as late as
1842-4, two hundred natives were shot by the settlers. And Therry, in his
Reminiscences, gives particulars of a frightful massacre which took place at
Myall Creek, 350 miles in a northern direction from Sydney. About fifty blacks,
among whom were feeble old men and little children, were enticed over the


mountain range, tied together, then butchered and their bodies burned. And
this for no other motive, than that alleged during the trial, that some of the
blacks had committed depredations lower down the river, at a distance of from
40 to 60 miles from where the massacre had taken place. For this foul crime,
to the honour of their countrymen be it recorded, the perpetrators, seven in
number, suffered the extreme penalty of the law. Previous to their execution
they acknowledged their guilt to the gaoler, adding that they were not aware
they had violated the law as it had been so frequently done in the Colony before!
(p. 283.) Even the leading paper in the Colony at that date thought fit to attack
the Governor, and through him, Her Majesty’s Parliament, for advocating a
humane and just treatment of the Aborigines. Such sentiments it described as
■“ drawling philanthropy and mawkish sentimentality.”
But probably the most terrible indictment ever made against the white
oppressor is to be found in the Journals of the Rev. Joseph Orton, the Second
Superintendent of Wesleyan Missions in Australia. During his visits to
Port Phillip in the interests of the Mission to the Aborigines, he was over-
whelmed with evidence of the cruelty practised on the blacks. He states that
some of them were even crucified! while others at the feet of Justice sought
redress, but sought in vain. But Justice was blind or deaf, perhaps both. “It
becomes a grave question,” says Mr. Orton, “ whether we have a just right to
bring them to a British tribunal with all the parade and form of a perplexingly
refined Civil Court, and there place them at the bar and try them with all their
disadvantages of ignorance and barbarism Rather before we tan-
talize them with the mockery of British trial, let British subjects be compelled
to act upon those laws of Justice and equity which are the professed pride of
the nation ; especially wherein the rights of man are so sacredly held. Where
is the justice of robbing, starving, murdering, and then bringing the survivors
of the aggrieved to a bar of Justice for a petty larceny to satisfy the bitter crav-
ings of hunger, by taking that which their nature teaches them is their right.”
f
Let one case out of many be given. Two shepherds, the one a criminal,
the other of indifferent character, lost flour and other provisions, which, doubtless,
the blacks stole. Twelve months afterwards, a large mob of natives was ille-
gally captured, driven at the point of the bayonet into a stockyard, and after-
wards imprisoned in an unfinished store, from which, at the earliest possible
opportunity, they sought to escape. The constable, backed up by the soldiers
at once fired into them, and succeeded in shooting one man who was patiently
enduring his imprisonment. The survivors were placed on trial, the witnesses
gave their evidence, and “ the Chairman summed up the evidence according to
the most partial ex parte notes 1 have ever heard taken in the course of a trial.
Not one word was uttered in commiseration of the circumstances of the prisoners
or the disadvantages under which they laboured before a British Court. Not
a doubtful or mitigating circumstance brought before the jury, though these
were many, which might have been adduced from the evidence submitted to the
Court. No admonition to give the prisoners the advantage of any doubt which
might arise in their minds. But this most remarkable summing up was con-
cluded by an unequivocable, gratuitous, unconstitutional opinion of this worthy


Judge that the jury must find them guilty.”—(/ ournals, p. 139, vol. ii.) The men
who had sworn to do their duty, brought in a verdict of guilty ; and the poor
natives were sentenced to ten years’ transportation. “ The merciful decision of
a British, Christian Court,” sarcastically adds Mr. Orton.
From the Chief Protector at Port Phillip, Mr. Robinson, Mr. Orton received
particulars of many other crimes and cruelties, some of which he indignantly
records in his journals. And “in addition to the above cases,” he adds, “there
were many others of an atrocious character which I had not the opportunity of
looking over The Chief Protector read me an account of one
case of unlawful capture. The prisoner was chained by the neck and hurried
down to Melbourne at the rate of forty miles a day, the result of which was
that he died of fatigue and pain from the wounds made by the galling, oppres-
sive irons which he was compelled to wear. And, after all, as be-
fore stated, there was only a shadow of suspicion as to his having
committed an offence. —{Journals ii., p. 148.) But let it not be
thought that the British Government was insensible to its duty to-
wards the Aborigines. In 1833-4, the House of Commons appointed a
Protectorate at Port Phillip, with Mr. Robinson as Chief and four Assistant
Protectors. Reserves were set apart and provisions provided in various places,
but these well meant plans came to nought, and proved a failure. Various
reasons were assigned for this result, but whatever the true reason, the effect was
not inspiring.
As to the religious beliefs of the Aborigines, Dr. Lang, who had consider-
able experience, says they had no ideas of God, and no objects of worship.
But here Lang is in error, for their gods were their ancestors. Religious im-
pressions when made, were transient, and their minds were so constituted that
they appeared incapable of understanding matters connected with religion,
though they had a code of morality of their own. Their traditions tell of the
creation of the first man and woman, of reptiles and snakes, of a great flood, and
of a serpent having power over all things. The white men, they say, were once
black men, who had died and returned in an improved state of existence. They
reverenced the moon and stars, and had a great dread of the darkness. Circum-
cision, or a similar rite, was generally practised, while human sacrifice, canni-
balism and infanticide existed among many tribes. Female children were fre-
quently destroyed, and on some occasions eaten by the mother and her other
children. Revenge was sweet to the Aboriginal mind; and to avenge the death
of a relative became a sacred duty ; the revenge being considered complete
only on the production of the fat from a certain part of the body. This fat
was rubbed on the body, under the impression that the dead man’s strength was
imparted to his avengers. Their grief for the departed found vent in low wail-
ing sounds and piercing screams, accompanied by disfigurement of the body and
tearing of the hair. The position of woman was that of a drudge ; after child-
hood she was never treated with kindness or looked upon as a companion.
Their cooee was a distinctive cry, and, like their language, indicative of their
character and habits. It is different to all other known intonations, being
specially adapted for conveying the voice to a greater distance than any other
sound which the human voice articulates.


To this unfortunate race Samuel Leigh gave attention soon after
his arrival; one of his first acts being to inform the Missionary
Committee of what had already been done towards their reformation.
“In 1814,” he writes, “an Institution for the children of the Aboriginal natives
was founded at Parramatta, under the auspices and protection of His Excel-
lency, Governor Macquarie, December 10th, on which occasion the native tribes
were invited into Parramatta by the Governor, and hospitably entertained. Here
commenced their dawn of civilization. A Committee of the most respectable
gentlemen was appointed to superintend the furtherance of this humane object,
which, although commenced on a slender scale, has sufficiently evinced that these
poor souls have a capacity capable of expansion. In 1815, allotments of ground,
for the purpose of cultivation, were located to 16 native families, at George’s
Head, with the advantage of the sea coast, of whom Boongarrie was the Chief.
This native, now between 40 and 50 years of age, has been distinguished for
the docility of his manners, his kind and tractable disposition, his friendly
demeanour and his general utility. A brass medal was given to him by the
Governor, which he wears suspended around his neck, naming him ‘ Chief of
the Broken Bay Tribe.’ A boat named The Boongarrie was presented to them,
and thus has the effort been made to reconcile the adults to the manners of an
orderly society, to which end every possible encouragement was given. This
charitable work was commenced on the Ist of February. Other deserving
natives have since received medals for their good conduct, and it is a pleasure to
say, that much good has been effected by it. In 1816, an annual general friendly
meeting of the Aboriginal natives, was established by proclamation, to be held
on the 28th of December. This meeting has been well attended by most of the
tribes in the Colony, and I have no doubt but much good will attend the In-
stitution.
“ Since the commencement of this humane and honourable undertaking,
much interest has been excited ; but after all the exertions which have been
made in behalf of the native Institution, there has been a great want of labourers ;
of men who are willing to spend and be spent in the cause of the Redeemer. The
Clergy of the Colony have proposed a plan, on a larger scale, to His Excellency
Governor Macquarie, for the furtherance of the evangelizing the wandering
natives, which proposal the Governor has been pleased to accept, and has pro-
mised to support the execution of the plan for two years out of his private
purse. The Rev. Robert Cartwright has been very zealously engaged in this
cause, and has offered his services as a Missionary, to instruct the natives, and
to superintend the Institution. If the Methodist Conference should think it
right to send a zealous, holy, patient, and persevering Missionary, to be devoted
entirely to the native tribes, I have no doubt but he would be gladly received,
and well supported by the inhabitants of the Colony. I have always found
their hearts warm on this subject.”
The Rev. Walter Lawry supported Leigh’s appeal thus on October 29th,
1818: While in this district (Portland Head) I availed myself of an oppor-
tunity of speaking to a tribe of native blacks. I hey were preparing for war
with another tribe, making swords of timber, and womaras (a sort of club), and

spears in great number for the combat ; discovering this as I rode through the
woods, I put my horse up at a settler’s house, and walked towards them. As 1
approached, the women and children ran away; but the King, with several men,
came to meet me. I inquired why the children were carried off ; they replied
that many of them had been taken away by men in black clothes, and put to
a school at Parramatta, and they feared I was come on that errand. After
assuring them to the contrary, the King despatched messengers after the absen-
tees, who presently mustered them on the spot where I was conversing with
their Chief. I began my speech by observing that most likely some of them
would fall dead in the battle ; this they also thought probable, and looked very
gloomy about it. I then endeavoured to prove that they would rise again and
live for ever; after this they shook their heads, and unanimously said: 1 When
black man die, never no more, never no more.’ I reasoned with them much on
the God who lived above the sky; and spoke in the thunder they so often heard.
Of these things they seemed to know nothing, nor did they manifest any desire
to be taught; but when I took out my Bible and read to them, they set up a
great laugh, and walked off. The old King, Yellowmonday, appeared willing to
give me all the information I wished, and upon taking out my portable shaving
box, and showing him his face in a glass, he laughed much, and said; ‘lt is like the
devil.’ This, I suppose, he had learned from the English ; he afterwards shaved
himself with great dexterity. There is a school instituted for the instruction
of their children, which answers well ; this, I think, is most likely to lead to their
conversion.


“ A native corroboree is rather curious : it is a sort of festival held at full
moon, on which occasion several tribes or clans meet by previous consent; they
dance all night, and feast on such provisions as they can procure, and celebrate
some rites peculiar to themselves ; but they are adverse to admit whites to see
their ceremonies; indeed, they have customs quite unknown to us, nor do they
seem willing for us to know them. On these occasions they seldom assemble
in greater numbers than one or two hundred; an old woman, daubed with pipe
clay, performs the part of a leader. Though women are perfect slaves to the
men in common life, all their movements are guided by her ; their festivals are
generally followed by hostilities. Their principal employ is fishing, which they
perform with great ability. After they have fished a proper time they retire
into the wood, and divide mutually what they have thus caught; so, that if one
family has proved unsuccessful, they get an equal share with the rest; they
have all things common. After they have taken their repast, they stretch
themselves on the ground, and so spend the night, having no other bed than
the turf. It is remarkable they seldom stop in the same place a second night;
they are ever on the move. They have a slavish fear when it is dark of some
evil spirit or bad thing, which they say often comes down from the clouds and
carries off their children ; this idea they borrow from seeing the eagle descend
upon and carry off his prey. Of God, or anything good, they appear quite
ignorant and unconcerned. Their manners are very much corrupted by the
Europeans, whose vices they copy.”
The attention of the Committee being thus drawn to this work, its members
resolved to appoint a Missionary to labour exclusively among the natives ; and
their choice fell on the Rev. William Walker, who sailed in company with Mr.
and Mrs. Leigh and the Rev. William Horton, and arrived in Sydney, September
16th, 1821. Mr. Walker was a preacher of extraordinary power; possessing abili-
ties far above the average. But owing to unfortunate misunderstandings which
arose between him and his Brethren, his services were lost to the Wesleyans for
a time; as he settled near,Bathurst, where he rendered service to the Anglican
Church, until he returned to Parramatta, when he again became a useful member
of the Wesleyan Church. His removal is to be deplored, as the exercise of a
little tact with gentle handling would have overcome the difficulties. 1
Of his first experience with the Aborigines, Mr. Walker writes: “ Their
cruel mode of courtship and marriage is not universally practised; but the ex-
ceptions are so few that they are not worth particularizing. Both the natives
of New South Wales and those of Van Dieman’s land, have a custom of paying
1 The chief cause of the trouble with Mr. Walker arose through the possession of live
stock which came to him by marriage. The Committee wrote to the Chairman- “You
will also please to inform him, and all other Preachers in your District that if they
expect to be acknowledged as Methodist Missionaries they will be required to decline the
keeping of all farming and grazing stock and the following of any worldly business
whatever. With this decision no reasonable person could complain. But it happened
that Mr. Lawry was in a similar position ; grazing stock having come to him through
marriage Mr Lawry had an opportunity of explaining the matter in person to the
General Committee. His explanation was accepted as satisfactory under the cireum
stances; and he continued his useful services in the Church. William Walker hnd nn
such opportunity. u


adoration to the waxing moon. Any other object of their religious worship I
have not been able to learn. They are much afraid in the night, but from what
their fear arises, I cannot yet say. They are very idle and vagrant; and the
Colonists too often encourage their vices. If they cut wood, or do any other
trifling work, they are rewarded with what they call ‘ bull ’ ; sometimes this is
composed of a mixture of spirituous liquors, and at others it is the washing of
liquor puncheons. When they are permitted, they take a bucket of boiling water,
and put it in the puncheon, where they agitate it until it has drawn out the
strength of the liquor. They then surround the puncheon, drinking until they
are intoxicated. Quarrelling ensues, and if ever incarnate devils appeared in this
world, surely the natives are at such times their representatives. I was lately
returning from Parramatta to Sydney, having visited the native Institution, when
I fell in with a tribe of these revellers. Some were not at all intoxicated, others
were fearfully so ; but both the drunken and the sober knew me. I asked them
to go into the woods, knowing if the convicts met them, they would be excited to
fight, and probably to murder one another ; all followed me. But such a noise
I never heard before ; and so much wanton barbarity I never witnessed. The
men would take their waddies, which are made of hardwood, about three feet long
and four or five inches in circumference at the end, and strike the heads of their
women with such violence that I expected nothing less than the death of some
of them, as the husbands stood up to defend their wives. When one man lifted
up his waddy to strike another, I stepped in between them. I then turned round,
and found another bleeding profusely. Before I had wiped away the blood from
the head of one, another would be in danger. I declared I would not live with
so quarrelsome a people. This produced a clamour, which made the woods ring,
and all vociferated; ‘ Parson, do stay,’ a hundred times repeated.”
“ On Sunday, the 7th instant, I went to a place known by the name of
South Creek, about twenty-eight miles from Sydney, and twelve from Parra-
matta, where some of the girls out of the Native Institution, who have lately
been married to the wild men, have settled. Mr. James Hassall kindly drove
me thither. The woods through which we passed were very pleasant; but the
place where the natives have settled was exceedingly delightful. On my arrival,
I found several huts, whose inhabitants were instantly out of doors at our ap-
proach. After having committed the horse to one of them, who took him to
feed in a paddock, I went from house to house, and explained the reason of my
visit. All were pleased, and welcome beamed on every face. As I brought with
me four pairs of trousers, four gowns, and some other articles, I distributed them,
and gave one frock to a little boy who was prancing around his mother. It
would be impossible to describe their gratification. As some of the females
had learned to read at the Institution, I asked them to produce their Bibles;
and I fixed upon a part of St. John’s Gospel, which they read, and I endeavoured,
catechetically, to explain it. But you cannot conceive the ignorance which their
answers discovered. I deemed it most prudent to addiess myself to the vlnef
first, but he seemed even the most ignorant. Indeed to all my questions, the
general answer was, 1 Don’t know, Sir ’; and to all my explanations or illustra-
tions, I received an unmeaning assent.


“ After this catechetical course, 1 addressed some plain advice to them, and
prayed. To my great astonishment, they were still attentive, and apparently
reverent. This gave me encouragement. If nothing more conducive to the wel-
fare of the Mission presents itself, I shall perhaps go and live among this tribe,
still itinerating among others. We went to a hut (Bobby Fulton’s) and asked
if they could procure us anything for dinner. ‘We have some pork and beef
to give you,’ was the reply. But as we had brought victuals with us, we had
no need of theirs. Betty Fulton cooked our beefsteak ; we invited the Chief and
others to sit down with us, and divided the meat amongst them. The Chief had
brought us eggs, and Betty Fulton had prepared water to boil them, and to pre-
pare our tea also. It is impossible for me to describe the feelings of my heart
at this hospitality. We then sung two of Watts’ Hymns for Children, and I
prayed with them, and took my leave.”
At a later stage, Mr. Walker and Mr. Leigh dined with the Governor, when
the subject of the Mission was discussed, the Governor giving kindly advice and
promising his patronage. The serious people of the Colony were also much
pleased with the commencement of this Mission and voluntarily forwarded sub-
scriptions towards its support. Mr. Walker was thus encouraged to hope for
success. During the year 1823, the Missionaries met in conference; and as the
result of their observations and experiments extending over a period of sixteen
months, they told the General Committee that, for the present, no effectual
measures could be adopted for the prosecution of their difficult task without
incurring serious expense, which they would not undertake without sanction. The
only method calculated to be permanently useful was that already approved by
the Government in the establishment of a seminary for the maintenance and
instruction of a select number of youths. They, therefore, after much delibera
tion, recommended the adoption of the following plan:—
1. That a house in the vicinity of Parramatta, with spacious grounds
attached, which had been offered by the Rev. Samuel Marsden for £3O per
annum, with liberty to leave at any time be taken and that £6O be allowed
for furnishing. 2. That for the present not more than six young Aborigines be
admitted for the purpose of instructing them in religious and general know-
ledge. 3. That not more than eight shillings and sixpence per week be allowed
for the board of each native. 4. That the Institution be under the superinten-
dence of a Committee, consisting of all the Missionaries in the Colony, and
twelve laymen to be elected annually by the District Meeting. 5. That there be
a Treasurer and two Secretaries, the Missionary resident at Parramatta to be
one Secretary, and the other to be elected annually by the Committee. 6. That
the following gentlemen, with the Missionaries be the Committee for the ensuing
year: Messrs. George Allen, Thomas Bowden, Edward Eagar, Thomas Ewing
Forbes, Thomas Hyndes, Samuel Hassall, Jonathan Hassall, Tames Hassall,
Joshua Harper, Thomas Moore, James Mileham and James Scott, and Mr. Robert
Howe as Treasurer. 7. That the Committee meet once a quarter, or more fre-
quently, if necessary. 8. That the Committee at its quarterly meetings, audit
the accounts, examine the books, enquire into the progress made by the pupils,
and record the result of their deliberations, and such alterations, as they deem

advisable. 9. That no alteration in the plan of the Institution be made, nor any
additional expenses incurred, without the approval of the General Superinten-
dent. 10. That Mr. Walker keep two books for the Committee's inspection, one
containing a detailed account of income and expenditure ; the other showing
the number of Aborigines admitted, excluded and in residence, together with the
pursuits in which they were engaged. 11. that an annual report showing the
progress of the Institution be prepared, approved, and then read, at the Annual
Missionary Meeting of the Auxiliary Society. 12. 1 hat there be an annual ex-
amination of the pupils to which subscribers and friends be publicly invited.
13. That the accounts of the 'lnstitution, including Mr. Walker’s personal items,
be submitted to the Quarterly and Annual District Meetings and forwarded half-
yearly to the General Committee. 14. That not more than T3OO per annum
be drawn for the support of the Mission until the General Committee expressly
allows more.”
This plan was considered by the General Committee, and finally approved
of as a temporary scheme pending a more effective establishment. Mr. Eagar,
who had already outlined a plan of operation, was requested to attend the sub-
committee of finance for the purpose of enabling it to prepare a report for the
further consideration of the General Committee. The Committee, in approving


of this provisional arrangement, also insisted that the young men in the Institu-
tion be taught to read, instructed in the principles of religion, and daily em-
ployed in learning agriculture and some useful art connected with it; of which
employment a Journal was to be regularly kept and transmitted; and that in
the instructions communicated to them, the benefit of their respective tribes, to
whom it was expected they would afterwards communicate Christian knowledge
and civilization, be constantly kept in view.
Mr. Walker now entered heartily into his work, full of hope and great ex-
pectation. In his first report from this Institution to the General Committee, he
writes:—“ My health has been greatly impaired by exposure ; and lam only
just on the mortal side of eternity. By too great labour in hoeing up ground
for a garden, etc., a fever was induced, which in a day or two carried me to the
borders of the grave. The kind friends, by whom I was surrounded, say that
they had little hope that I should recover. But the prayers of the people of
God prevailed, and I am likely to enjoy a better state of health than I ever
did. This fever seized me almost in a moment. I was, however, at the house
of a very kind friend, Mrs. Hassall; and, being unable to move, a room, bed,
and board, were most affectionately provided for me. I have sustained a very
serious loss since I last wrote. Two of the most promising native youths I
have met with, are gone into the eternal world. This was a sore trial. No man
ever loved his son with a more ardent affection, than I did these youths. One
was the son of the renowned Ben-il-long,* whom I baptized, at his own earnest
request, and from a serious conviction of his fitness to be outwardly initiated into
the Church of God, by the name of Thomas Walker Coke. He learned to read
his Bible in about three months ; his attention to Class and prayer-meetings was
very great and encouraging. In one instance, to my knowledge (and the prac-
tice, I think, was frequent), he collected the young natives of his own tribe, to
whom he gave an exhortation, which he concluded with prayer. He seemed to
have a presentiment of his death. I was absent when he died, procuring him
some grapes; when Bandle, an old black, met me as 1 was returning, to say:
‘ Coke is dead ; he died in my arms.’ Just before he died, he said to old Bandle:
‘ Well, my brother, I shall die to-day; good-bye,’ he immediately added, and,
kissing the old man, expired in his arms. The name of the other boy was
Jemmy. He was not less promising for piety; but had not equal powers of
mind. As soon, almost, as he fell sick, he went into the bush, and in a few
weeks died. These Providential occurrences have greatly impeded the prosperity
of the work of God among the poor blacks ; for they are so superstitious that
they believe the place where one has died to be equally fatal to themselves;
and they so fret as to be disordered and often die in consequence. Being under
this influence, and having many severe afflictions to corroborate their supersti-
tion, they fled from the Mission-House, the fear that hath torment adding wings
to their flight. At present, lam left with two boys, and being in a rapid state
of recovery, must go out to collect more children. One soul, however, lam happy
to believe, has out of this degraded class of human beings, by the blessing of
God upon this Mission, been admitted to His glory.”
* Ben-il-long had acquired some notoriety through having paid a visit to England.


Twelve months later (1824), Mr. Walker writes again:—“ Yeste-
rday I visited the settlement of the Aborigines to whom I preached.
As many of the wild natives were about the woods, I had an opportunity of
conversing with them. Some of them were seriously hurt by fighting a few days
before ; the rest were lounging under the trees in a state of apparent torpor,
waiting till the shades of evening should assist them to hunt the opossum. In
the Institution there are thirteen children, seven girls, and six boys. Four of the
girls’ fathers were white men, and three or four of the boys have the same origin.
The natives have been engaged in a terrible conflict, in consequence of the death
of Coke, the black boy who was baptized, and is since dead. A year has elapsed
since he died, but his death was only avenged last week. The blacks believed
their deaths to be occasioned by the malice and craftiness of some one of the
hostile tribe, whom, they think, unperceived and unfelt, perforates with a poisoned
dart, the side opposite the heart. No sign of puncture is left, but in conse-
quence thereof, he dies. The discovery of the murderer depends upon some
dreamer ; and the individual who is the subject of the dream is to stand punish-
ment, i.e., to have as many spears thrown at him as his adversaries think pro-
per. In the case of Coke’s death, his aunt dreamed, twelve months after the
event, that his companion had speared him. He was ordered out to stand punish-
ment, on the race ground at Sydney, last Sunday but one. A spear penetrated
his body a little above the hip, but it was extracted without having greatly en-
dangered the life of the youth. The man who threw the spear which wounded
the boy, had to stand in his turn, and three or four hundred blacks assembled
to do their utmost. He defended himself successfully against a host of spears,
with a shield about one foot broad and three long. His friends then turned upon
his assailants, and the result was, that one of them had his skull dreadfully
fractured. They then made the matter up. As many as were able afterwards
intoxicated themselves, either with grog or peach cider, and then began little
less than murderous work. The strongest, of course, came off the best. If
our kind friends in England could only witness these scenes of human depravity,
these desolating effects of sin, many tears would be shed in sympathy for the
sufferers. At a Missionary Meeting, held last week, I related these matters, and
one of the speakers, in applying some of my remarks, and summing up the
number of dollars which he would give on certain accounts, said: ‘ I will give
another dollar a year, because lam not a black man!’ Had he seen, as well as
heard, he would have felt still more. O, what a work there is to perform in New
South Wales! It is a comfort to me that the arm of the Lord is not shortened.
God can save to the uttermost.”
This was Mr. Walker’s last report; and this was also the last of the Parra-
matta Institution, for it was now abandoned. I o break up his connection with
temporal things, Mr. Walker was removed.” Mr. Leigh’s name was suggested
by the General Committee, as Mr. Walker’s successor, and the Chairman was
told to look for a suitable man. If he could not be found, said the Committee,
then we can send out another Missionary. Whether anything came of Mi.
Eagar’s suggestions, or whether he submitted another and a larger scheme does
not appear. But Mr. M'alker s place was eventually filled by M!r. John Plarper ,


who had been employed as Mr. Walker’s Assistant. In October, 1824, Mr. Har-
per was sent to Wellington Valley to ascertain the number of Aborigines in that
part of the country, where there was a promising field for Missionary labour.
The black was separated from the white man, and appeared in his native and
natural state. 1 hough war raged between the Colonists and the natives in the
neighbourhood of Bathurst, peace reigned around “ the smiling and ever verdant
Valley of Wellington.” “From the information in our possession,” says The
Sydney Gazette (October 14, 1825), “ we have no hesitation in affirming, with the
utmost confidence, that Wellington V alley is one of the best adapted places in
all Australia for the immediate work of a determined and laborious Missionary.
The fields are white unto the harvest. If affection and gratitude are even now
the inmates of their untutored bosoms, what would not the Gospel be speedily
capable of affecting ? If they could only once be brought under the ameliora-
ting influence of religion, civilization would be the pleasing result.” Mr. Harper
was placed by the Governor on the stores, and a letter was sent to Lieut. Simp-
son, the Commandant of the Valley, in his favour, in consequence
of which kindness he met with every encouragement. On his re-
turn, he stated that there were five Tribes associated at Wellington
\ alley, consisting of some thousands of people all speaking the same lan-
guage, of which he had acquired such knowledge as to be able to converse with
them on common subjects. As he had shown such devotion to his work, Mr. Ers-
kine called the Missionaries together at Parramatta on the 21st of April, 1825,
when it was agreed to receive Mr. Harper as an Assistant Missionary to labour
among these tribes. Of this course the General Committee said “we fully ap-
prove.”
The District Meeting report (December, 1825), says: “Our proceedings in
this important but truly arduous department of our work have hitherto been con-
fined to some preliminary measures. Having determined to direct our attention
to the tribes in the neighbourhood of Wellington Valley, and'obtained from Kis
Excellency Governor Brisbane, not only his sanction, but also considerable assist-
ance in furtherance of our design, we despatched to that part of the interior Mr.
John Flarper, a young man of much promise and peculiarly qualified for this
formidable undertaking. He went up in the month of May, and has since been
assiduously and very successfully engaged in learning the Aboriginal language,
and acquiring such information as will be necessary for our guidance in the
establishment of a Missionary settlement. From his communications, which are
copious, and very interesting, it appears that he has gained the confidence and
affection of the natives, that he has mastered their language, that he has made
some incipient efforts to dispel the darkness from their minds, and to communi-
cate instruction to their children, that these efforts have been well received, and
that there is a disposition on the part of the Blacks in general to avail them-
selves of Missionary labours, so far at least as they tend to promote their tem-
poral condition.” •
While in the Valley, Mr. Harper gave his impressions for publication in
The Sydney Gazette. These letters did not please the Attorney-General, for he
preferred against him a charge of having presented an exaggerated picture of his


procedings. “We have taken up this matter,” said his Brethren, “in a very
serious manner. 2 A copy of the charge has been sent to him, and his reply has
just been received. He vindicates himself in a bold and manly tone, declares
that he is ready to meet his accusers face to face, and notifies his intention of
proceeding to Sydney for that purpose by the earliest opportunity.”—( District
Despatch Book , vol. i., p. 13.) On his arrival, Mr. Harper appeared before a
Special District Meeting held on the 6th June, 1826, when, “after a very rigid
investigation, he was honourably acquitted. The Missionaries afterwards had
“an interview with Mr. Bannister (the Attorney-General), who examined Mr.
Harpers MSS. and appeared perfectly satisfied with the justness of our decision.”
The Attorney-General had to swallow his own sauce at a later date, for a most
frivolous charge of libel was preferred against him!
At this stage the District Meeting suggested to the General Committee the
wisdom of applying for a grant of 20,000 acres of land, which, in view of all
considerations, “ we consider His Majesty’s Government would not hesitate to
bestow.” The most important consideration was that the land originally be-
longed to the Aborigines. The Committee was, therefore, requested to obtain
from the Colonial Office “ an order for a location of land to our Society, not
less than the quantity specified above.” This was made necessary, it was main-
tained, in order to preserve the blacks from “ the ruinous effects of intercourse ”
with their “ immoral brethren,” and to secure them from the encroachments to
which the small landowner, however distant his location, would be subject. Grants
of 10,000 acres each had already been assigned by the Governor to the Church
and London Missionaries Societies and confirmed by the Secretary for State.
And the Attorney-General expressed his surprise that a similar indulgence had
not been granted to the Wesleyan Society. The Missionaries afterwards modi
fied their views, and memoralised the Governor, soliciting the assignment to the
Society “ of ten thousand acres of land, to enable them to carry into effect their
benevolent intentions of instructing and civilizing the Aborigines of this terri-
tory.” But His Excellency was unwilling, through no lack of sympathy with the
proposal, to extend the provision in this respect, until he was satisfied that some-
thing practical was done in prosecution of the plan laid down by the Society.
Meanwhile, reports came from Mr. Harper of a discouraging nature. The
location which The Sydney Gazette triumphantly proclaimed to be the best in
all Australia was now presenting unforeseen difficulties. The native, in his un-
adorned simplicity, was there in strong numbers. He was far removed from his
“ immoral ” conqueror ; he was at peace, and easily approached. But the fatal
objection to this verdant Valley was found in the fact “ that for at least six
months in the year,” it was a place of “ lagoons and morasses ” ; certainly not
the most desirable spot for agricultural purposes and Missionary experiments.
Mr. Harper was, therefore, removed, and sent to reconnoitre Twofold Bay; where
“ the natives are said to be more numerous, more domesticated, and more indus-
trious than in any other part.”
2 They need not have done so. Libel cases at that stage of the Colony’s history were
so frequent and foolish that now most people smile at them.


In his “ Letter of Instructions,” with which the District Meeting furnished
him, Mr. Harper was informed that a vessel had been secured, which he was
restricted from employing for a longer period than two months. “On your
arrival there, your first object will, of course, be to discover the principal resort
of the natives, and, by suitable presents and conciliatory manners, to secure their
confidence in the friendliness of your designs. This will prepare the way for
free communication with them on the various topics comprehended in your main
business We would, however, caution you as to the mode of
conducting your enquiries. It will be of the utmost importance to maintain a
tone the reverse of inquisitorial, lest they should suspect you of being a spy.
Studiously conceal the marks of curiosity, and let your information be drawn
out incidentally, in the course of successive interviews rather than by formal and
direct interrogations.” —(District Letter Book , vol. hi., p. 6.) He was also advised
to take a correct survey of the proposed establishment, and to keep a Journal,
the contents of which must not be seen by anyone, in order to guard against
premature disclosures. Surely with such minute instructions, Mr. Harper could
not do other than the right and proper thing.
The result of this voyage of enquiry, the Missionary shall tell in his own
words:—
“ October 7th, 1826. Jervis Bay.-—A heavy gale of wind arose from the
South, and continued all day. At sunset it abated. I then went on shore at
Bowen’s Isle to see some of the blacks, who were employed in fishing; and found
their dialect had little affinity to that with which lam acquainted. I distributed
a few fish-hooks, and went with them into a cave in a great rock by the sea-side.
Here I took an opportuniy of speaking on the doctrine of a future state ; they
believe in this doctrine, but their ideas are very confused. I observed that they
were superstitious in taking off the scales from a fish. They believe that if the
scales are not taken off before the fish is laid on the fire, that ‘ water will jump
up,’ that waves of the yea will rise, and prevent them from catching any more
fish that day. These natives appear to be of a litigious and depraved char-
acter, nor are they satisfied, give them what you will.
“ October 9th. —I took an excursion with a few blacks to a small distance,
but was not able to return again before night, on account of having to travel
through a thick wood. When I returned I found that I was not able to get
to the vessel, the wind being too high. I therefore took up my night’s lodging
in the open air along with the blacks. The number present when I returned
was 96. After amusing them with some phrases used by the Wellington tribes,
and endeavouring to make out what I could of their language, I lay down to
rest, and slept soundly and comfortably. These blacks roam without fixed
habitation, and find temporary shelter under the branches of a tree, the hollow
of a rock, or two or three sheets of bark, laid in a reclining position against each
other. They are idle, and but seldom employed ; except in fishing, and hunting
the kangaroo and opossum. Their weapons are spears and clubs. They are
dexterous marksmen, and will hit a bird flying, or a guana on a tree, among other
small objects, at an amazing distance. Polygamy is common among them.

“ October 14th. —We arrived at Bateman Bay. It is forty miles from
Jervis Bay. A black ran along the beach, setting fire to the grass at about every
two hundred yards in order to hail us by the sight of the smoke.
“ October 15th. —The black who ran along the beach the preceeding night,
came on board ; I gave him a blanket and some biscuit, and despatched him to
fetch more blacks ; this I was obliged to do by making signs, as he could not
speak one word of English. Neither did he understand the Wellington
language.
“ October 17th. —I took an excursion with the blacks, whom I had seen the
day before. As we passed through a thick scrub, the blacks went before me,
and raked down the sticks and rods that were in my way. They seemed to be
highly amused at every trivial thing I did. No man of pure motives need be
afraid of travelling with them, even in the most obscure place.
“ October 20th. —We weighed anchor, and were leaving the Bay when I
found myself uneasy for leaving this place so suddenly ; but I could not meet
with a sufficient number of natives to confine my labours to them. While
musing with myself whether I should stay a day or two longer, the wind set in
from the southward, so that we were under the necessity of staying. At this.
moment we were unexpectedly hailed from the south side of the Bay. I im-
mediately got the vessel moored, went on shore, and took with me a few presents.
One of these blacks had been over to the new country, and could speak English
sufficiently to interpret what I had to say to his countrymen. On my first ap-
proach to the new tribe, they all lifted up their hands, a custom which denotes
peace. I stood some time ruminating upon the scene before me, considering
whether I should do right to confine myself to this tribe, were I to meet with
anything promising. I began to converse with them through my interpreter,
telling them the object of my visit, and the kindness of the good people in Sydney
in sending me. After the women had left, and seated themselves at a distance
by themselves, I sat down with the men, and began to converse with them upon
various subjects ; after which I wrote down the following observations:—Firstly.
They are the cleanest blacks I have yet seen. Secondly. They are very kind to
their women and children ; the blankets which I gave to the men they gave to
them. On my first approach, I was not a little surprised to see an aged man
and woman walking arm in arm towards me ; the man was pointing his finger
at me; their hair was nearly white. They were a venerable pair. Thirdly.
The men are of the middle size. Some of them, however, are rather tall; most
of them appear to be athletic. The women are rather short, but, I believe this
generally arises from carrying immense burdens. Both men and women are re-
markable for this docility. Fourthly. They are not corrupted by the whites. Fifth-
ly. My interpreter tells me they are on good terms with the surrounding tribes..
Sixthly. They do not appear to be so vagrant as the tribes at Jervis Bay, Shoal-
haven, etc. ; but it is impossible that they should be entirely settled, otherwise
they could not get a subsistence. They chiefly live by catching fish' and seals,
and on the fruits that grow wild in the woods. They generally live about half a
mile from the sea-coast, in temporary huts, which are ornamented with a tuft of
grass fastened to a stick, projecting from the front part of the top.


“ October 25th. —I have been alone in the woods, inspecting the land, and
have been fortunate in discovering a site that will answer the purposes of our
Mission.
“ October 27th. —I have taken my leave of the blacks, who anxiously expect
my return.
“ October 28th. —We left Bateman Bay. When we were sailing out, the
blacks waved their hands in token of their good wishes.
“ November 10th. —I arrived in Sydney. Having thus given particulars of
my journal, allow me to make a few general observations: —Firstly. It must be
acknowledged that, although these tribes are uncorrupted by the whites, yet,
they are degraded, as to divine things, almost to a level with the brutes. I
could not find that they had any knowledge of the Supreme Being. Secondly.
We have at Bateman Bay a wide field of usefulness, as other tribes are con-
tiguously situated, viz., the Pigeon-House Tribe, the Tawnebee Tribe, the Ban-
mouth Creek Tribe ; besides other tribes in the interior. Thirdly. To my mind
it is most encouraging to know that the administration of the Gospel is now, as
it has always been under the special providence of God. If we had the means
of sending a Missionary to each tribe, we might justly conclude that He, in
whose work we are employed, would not withhold the influence by which alone
the means can accomplish their end.”
Negotiations with the Governor for a grant of land were continued, and the
District Secretary thus addressed the Colonial Secretary:-—“I am now directed
most respectively to submit, that our actual proceedings in regard to the Abor-
iginal Mission, of which in our memorial we presented to His Excellency a com-
pendious view, evidence a sincere intention to prosecute the undertaking ; and
that as our Society stands solemnly pledged to the British public and to the
inhabitants of this Colony, to persevere in a work in which it has already ex-
pended upwards of a thousand pounds, and as it was never known voluntarily
to abandon any Mission on which it had once embarked, we respectfully trust
that His Excellency will accredit the honour of our professions, and place within
our command what we never before possessed, the means of accomplishing our
purpose and redeeming our pledge. —( District Letter Bk., August 26, 1826.)
To this letter the Governor replied asking how it was proposed to make the land
solicited immediately available for the purposes named. These proposals were
outlined and a request was preferred for land at “ Bateman’s Bay as the place
most eligible for the purposes of our Mission.” The Governor, however, was not
prepared to make a grant of land on the coast, and the Missionaries asxed to be
allowed to “ select the land to the South-East of Wellington Valley, at a place
called by the natives ‘ Bourndong,’ and contiguous to the ‘ Strong Rapids ’ laid
down in the map.” This is the last word on the matter. The Missionaries
conjectured that some prejudicial influence was at work which prevented the
granting of their request. But it is probable the authorities knew that nothing
of a practical nature had been accomplished where land had already been
granted and they anticipated similar results in the case of the Wesleyan Society.
Possibly, too, the failure in their own Institutions made them dubious of success


in any other quarter. Mr. Harper was sent to labour at Richmond, in connec
tion with the Windsor Circuit, with “ instructions to consider it a special and
important part of his duty at Richmond, to attend to the Aborigines, and to
instruct such of the boys and girls as he can procure.” In January, 1828, he
reports to the District Meeting: —“ I have endeavoured to adhere to the order.
But on account of the vagrant and indocile state of the Aborigines, in this
quarter and their continually mendicating from one house to another, in which,
unfortunately for their moral improvement, they too freqeuntly succeed, so as to
lead them to undervalue the means adopted for their improvement, I have failed
in the object. . . . Nothing, in my opinion, will be a means of bringing these
wretched and depraved creatures into order, but compulsion to some fixed resi-
dence ; at least, such are my sorrowful views at the present.” Six months later
he resigned his office as a Wesleyan Missionary on the grounds that he could see
no possible means, under present circumstances, of prosecuting the Mission in
a manner satisfactory to the public or to himself; and his mind recoiled from
entering upon any other sphere in the Wesleyan Mission.”
Soon after the arrival of the Rev. Joseph Orton, another attempt was made
to reclaim and help these unfortunate creatures ; the General Committee having
instructed him to keep constantly before him the state of the Aborigines. And
though hitherto every scheme had failed, or proved abortive, further effort was to
be put forth. Mr. Horton, however, found matters of a more pressing nature
demanding immediate attention; and the Mission to the Aborigines had to re-
main in abeyance. “ I have endeavoured, he writes on March 16th, 1832, to
possess myself of all possible information regarding the Aborigines of this
country. I have seen a little of them in the course of my travels, and have dis-
covered them to be quite equal to report 1 a most degraded race of human
beings,’ but they ace quite capable of receiving instruction. lam not aware of
a better mode of accomplishing this object than that of forming a settlement at
one of their principal places of resort, as far away from any white population as
possible ; to acquire the language, and pay particular attention to the rising gen-
eration. Of course such a settlement in the establishment and maintenance
would be attended with expense, say, from £SOO to £6OO in the commencement,
and at least £3OO per year afterwards. The great evil is their wandering dis-
position. They are never long in one place; but they have generally a dis-
trict for each tribe, and a rallying-point, or place of general rendezvous within
the limits of that district. They are a miserable race of beings, and truly de-
serving the attention of our Committee ; and I have no doubt that much might
be done for them to advantage, if a Mission were commenced with spirit and
carried on with energy ; but feeble efforts, I think, would sink money to little
purpose. The credit of our Missionary Society in this Colony is at this time
suffering for want of such exertions in behalf of the Aborigines.”
At the earliest opportunity, Mr. Orton visited Port Phillip with a view to
make enquiries relative to a suitable place in which to form a settlement, the
District Meeting of 1835 having passed a resolution to that effect. In 1836,
therefore, the Chairman left Hobart in company with Mr. and Mrs. Batman, in-
tending settlers for Port Phillip, sailing down the Tamar to embark on board


The Caledonia , lying at George Town. This place was so full of settlers on
their way to Port Phillip that Mr. Orton had to sleep as best he could on the
tloor of the hotel. But before he retired he preached to about thirty persons
from Romans viii., 6. Bad weather held him here for some time; and when
lie set sail the wind was contrary and the surroundings unpleasant in the ex-
treme. The miasma from the hold was intolerable ; and when one horse,
two bullocks, and a calf were dragged out of the hold in a state of putrefaction,
the cause was apparent. They anchored eventually in Port Phillip Bay on
Wednesday, 20th April, 1836; and shortly after proceeded up the “ Yarra
Yarra, still accompanied by Mr. Batman and his family. The first meal was
made in the tent of Dr. Thompson, an old acquaintance, and his toilet and
•devotions received attention on the banks of the Yarra. Pie met the notorious
Buckley on the way to Dr. d hompson’s ; and with this strange character after-
wards had an interview. 3 With Buckley as interpreter, Mr. Orton held several
interviews with the natives.
On the following Sabbath—24th April—he preached twice on Batman’s Hill,
fifty natives being among his audience. “My soul truly went out,” he says,
after their best interests. I felt as though I could have sacrificed every per-
sonal comfort for their welfare. I longed to be able to communicate my views
and feelings to them. I could but anticipate the happy time when
these poor creatures, degraded below the brute, will come to a knowledge of the
truth ; and they or their successors participate in the blessings of the Light of
the glorious Gospel.” The next day he set out for a trip in the country, ac-
companied by Mr. Ferguson, whose sheep station lay ten miles from the settle-
ment, and was under the charge of six shepherds ; to whom he read a portion
of Scripture and engaged in prayer. He then wrapped himself in an opossum
rug, “ and laid me down to rest in a small, rush hut, 7 feet square, with two other
persons.” On Wednesday he returned to the Settlement, and conversed with
Mr. Batman and Dr. Thompson regarding the establishment of the Mission, and
the erection of a place of worship for the Europeans near the Settlement. They
expressed their approval, and pledged themselves to liberal subscriptions on be-
half of these objects. Mr. Orton then returned to Hobart Town, resolved to re-
commend to the Committee the early establishment of the Mission. In his official
communication he says; —“ I can only now say that the result of my visit is that
I am much encouraged to press upon the Committee, with as little delay as
possible, to proceed with the establishing of a Mission to these wretchedly de-
graded creatures ; who are literally vagabonds upon the face of the earth. Not
only are they without any knowledge of God; but so far as I could discover,
without any but the most imperfect notion of a Supreme Being, or vestige of
religious form ; not even any description of superstitious observance.”
a William Buckley, who had been a soldier, and stood six feet seven inches high, was
sentenced to transportation. Escaping at Port Phillip with two others he parted from
them, and was captured by the natives, who, having compassion, treated him kindly, and
assigned him a wife, with whom he co-habited for many years. ITe lived with the
Aborigines for 33 years, and was so thoroughly at one with them that he made no effort
to escape. Mr. Orton says that though dull and heavy in his disposition and deportment
he was a man of thought and shrewdness of intellect. When rescued he looked like a wild
man; and had forgotten his mother tongue, the use of which, however, returned to
him.


SIR GEORGE WIGRAM ALLEN, M.L.A.


In due course this recommendation was acted upon ; and the Chairman was
again at Port Phillip in April 18th, 1839, where he was met by Mr. G. Lilley.
“ A very considerable town,” he says, “ has risen up by enchantment When I
was here three years ago there were but two houses of any consideration what-
ever, and they were comparative hovels. Now I find a town occupying an area
of a square mile ; in which are several hundreds of houses, many of which are
spacious, well-built edifices ; with a population of two thousand inhabitants, en-
joying most of the comforts of life, and all the advantages of our excellent,
political economy.” Through the instrumentality of the Revs. B. Hurst and J.
Fuckfield, whose chief care had been the Mission to the Aborigines, a Society
was formed and a place of worship erected ; valuable assistance being rendered
by Messrs. Dredge and Parker, Assistant Protectors to the Aborigines, who were
both Local Preachers. After several interviews with these Brethren and the
natives, Mr. Orton set out with Mr. Tuckfield for a tour of the country round
Geelong. A tedious journey, extending over three days through primeval
forest, brought them to the site of the intended town of Geelong ; where they
found only half a dozen settlers’ huts. On the following Sabbath (May sth,
1839) service was held in Mr. Fisher’s store, several natives attending the morn-
ing service. On the following Thursday they inspected the ground which Mr.
Tuckfield thought suitable for the proposed settlement, situated on the Barwon
River, 39 miles from Geelong. “At noon we reached the ground,” says Mr.
Orton ; “it is certainly a delightful spot; but I have serious apprehensions lest
an application for it should excite prejudice on the part of settlers who are
already squatting here. Our tent having been pitched, which consisted of a
tarpaulin thrown over a ridge pole supported by forked sticks, we took our
tea and supper together ; and after our rustic meal we closed the engagements of
the day by engaging in the worship of God, during which natives surrounded the
entrance to the tent. Mr. Tuckfield took occasion to explain, as well as he was
able, the nature of the service, which appeared to interest them much. After
the natives had retired to rest I walked over to their mya mya, which was a few
yards from the tent. A more striking sight I have not witnessed. They were
asleep lying in all positions: legs over bodies and heads, and vice versa , like a
litter of swine.” After a brief stay they were joined by Mr. Hurst, and a
thorough inspection of the district was made. Mr. Orton’s departure being has-
tened by instructions from London to proceed to Tonga, he sent a lengthy com-
munication to Messrs. Hurst and Tuckfield, in which he set forth “the general
principles upon which I believe we were quite agreed regarding the commence-
ment and working of the Mission.”
The sanction of the Governor of New South Wales being obtained for the
grant of land, 64,000 acres in area, the station was named Buntingdale, and oper-
ations were successfully commenced. On his second visit to the Mission, in
December, 1840, Mr. Orton again writes The state of this Mission has dwelt
heavily upon my mind since I have been on my visit; and after minute observa-
tion and prayerful consideration I can see no reason to alter the Views which I
have plainly expressed. Less attention should be given to the comforts of a
domestic nature, and a very great deal more to the important and sole object of


the Mission.” In May, 1841, he was again on a tour of inspection, and thus
records his impressions“ At 7 o’clock the bell rang for morning worship, when
nearly all assembled for prayers, which they concluded with the Doxology,
which had been translated by Mr. Tuckfield. My visit to the native school this
morning was very gratifying. There were in attendance 1/ boys and 12 girls
under the care of Mr. Tuckfield. The system of teaching adopted approximates
to the British Union or Lancastrian. After attending to their lessons they were
arranged for catechetical instruction. At the conclusion of the school they sang
to the Old Hundred tune, the Doxology as translated by Mr. Tuckfield. Their
vocal performance was pleasingly correct. At command they all knelt, and I
prayed with them ; though in a tongue incomprehensible to them, not so to the
Omniscient Being.”
In the year 1842, Mr. Hurst reports in the following strain to the District
Meeting: “The past year has been one of great trial and anxiety to the Mission-
aries on this Station, in consequence of the apparent fruitlessness of their labours.
For, although their exertions to improve the moral and civil condition of the
degraded and deeply injured Aborigines of this part of New Holland have been
continued according to their opportunities with unabated zeal and diligence, yet
they have not the pleasure of reporting that even in one instance they have been
instrumental in the salvation of souls. Nor does it appear, on a careful exami-
nation of all the circumstances of the Mission, that it is at all likely to succeed
unless the site be changed for one more in the centre of a large tribe, and farther
from the influence of ungodly Europeans. The ground at present occupied,
although within the boundary of a small tribe, was chosen because of its central
situation under the mistaken idea that several tribes could be brought to locate
upon the same reserve. But very soon after the commencement of their labours,
the Missionaries found there were almost insuperable obstacles to be overcome
before this part of their object could be accomplished. So inveterate are the
prejudices of one tribe against another, so constant their jealousies, so powerful
their superstitions, and in consequence so frequent their quarrels, that until the
Gospel shall have been brought to bear upon their hearts there can be but little
hope that any attempts to induce them peaceably to associate for any great
length of time would be successful. But that which presents the most formid-
able obstacle in the way of the conversion of this people is their connection with
the worst class of Europeans.”
Mr. Hurst, convinced that the Mission was hopeless, withdrew after a few
years; but Mr. Tuckfield, who was unwilling to abandon the enterprise as a
failure, wrote; “It is a matter of thankfulness to Almighty God that at no former
period did this Mission present such an encouraging character as it does at the
present. And during the whole of the year the general behaviour of the natives
towards each other, the Colonists, and their Missionary, has been such, as not
only to afford very great pleasure, but to warrant the conclusion that the best
mode of improving the moral and social condition of the Aborigines of this
land is that of separating the tribes, and treating them as small independent
communities The religious improvement of the natives is also
beginning to present a very encouraging aspect. During the year selections

from our Conference Catechism have been printed in their language, which have
been of great service in conveying Divine Truth to their understanding. Their
occasional meetings for prayer amongst themselves before they retired to rest,
the repeated invitations which the Missionary has received to come and pray
with them, their attention to private prayer, and the improved manner in
which they observe the Christian Sabbath, are circumstances sufficient to shew
that they entertain a regard for religion, and that the Spirit of God is at work
upon their minds The temporal department of the Mission is
carried on at present with one white man and the natives, and is progressing
well. They can grow sufficient wheat, potatoes, and other vegetables for the
Station ; and it is gratifying to witness the rapid improvement of the men and
boys in almost all kinds of manual labour connected with the cultivation of the
soil. And it is equally pleasing to see the women engaged at their needlework,
making clothes for themselves and their families. The flock of sheep under
their care prospers well also, and is rapidly increasing, amounting in all to 5 50,
although the establishment has been supplied from it with mutton for the last
four months.” —( District Minutes , 1844.)
Next year Mr. Tuckfield reports: “In reviewing the operation of the Mis-
sion during the past year, although on the one hand there is cause for devout
gratitude to Almighty God, yet on the other hand there are circumstances which
have tended to perplex and dissipate the minds of the natives and to put the
faith and patience of the Missionary to the test. . . . The prosperous state
of the Mission, however, was soon interrupted, by two or three influential tribes of
the District around, who encamped in the vicinity of the reserve. . . . They
seldom come near the reserve without exerting a baneful influence upon the
natives attached to the Mission, by endeavouring to allure or affright them to re-
sume their wandering habits.” Mr. Tuckfield translated the Catechism into the
native dialect; taught the boys to read and write, and for twelve years
laboured, hoping against hope. Then he reluctantly acquiesced in the abandon-
ment of the Mission. “Of Mr. Tuckfield personally,” writes Dr. Lang, after a
visit to Buntingdale in 1846, “I desire to speak in terms of sincere regard, as
an able, zealous, and indefatigable Missionary. If the isolation scheme should
not succeed in his hand, as I fear greatly it will not, it will not be from any
fault on his part.” The abandonment took place, “ the stock was sold, the
Government resumed the reserve, and before the close of 1848 the Buntingdale
Aboriginal Mission was numbered with the numerous failures which had pre-
ceded it; and all hope of the Christianization and civilization of the natives was
abandoned. —(See Symons' Life of Draper , p. 371.)
Institutions connected with other Churches fared no better. The Port
Phillip Protectorate proved “ a curse rather than a blessing.” The Rev. E. L.
Threlkeld, who worked at Lake Macquarie for fifteen years, reported that “ there
are now scarcely any Aborigines left to read, and the few who remain appear
determined to go on the broad road to destruction.” The Church Missionary
Society lived eleven years only; the German Mission at Moreton Bay was a
failure; and the Native Institution at Parramatta breathed its last after a
feeble life extending over thirteen years. Thus has every method failed to reclaim

the heathen of Australia. The Societies now at work are feeble ; and the re-
formed characters of whom we sometimes hear, give evidence of a refor-
mation genuine in some cases, but spurious in others. In dismissing this sub-
ject, with much reluctance we quote the unavoidable conclusion of the Rev. J.
C. Symons. “A gleam of hope occasionally cheers the Missionaries ; but these
are not sufficient to alter the now all but universal belief that the race are be-
yond the reach of Christian influence, and are insensible to Christian effort.’
This is a sad admission ; but facts demand it. The Methodist Church has
sought to do her duty to the Aborigines; but, like all others, she has fallen
short of success.

CHAPTER VII.
THE MISSION TO NEW ZEALAND.
WHEN Samuel Marsden was returning from a visit to England in
the year 1809, his heart went out towards a poor fellow, with a
dark skin and a bad cough, sitting among the sailors on the fore-
castle of the convict ship Ann ; this was Tuatara, a native of New
Zealand, who had been to England in the hope of seeing King
George. But in this he was disappointed. 111-used and cheated of his wages,
he found himself finally transhipped for Australia. Here Marsden found him,
wrapped in a great coat and apparently at the point of death. Taking him to his
home at Parramatta, he nursed him back to life; and at the end of six months
sent him to New Zealand, where he repeated what he had seen, and magnified
to his countrymen the story of Marsden’s great kindness. When Marsden’s
party, Messrs. Hall and King, Christian artisans sent out by the Church of Eng-
land Missionary Society to civilise and then Christianise New Zealand, landed at
the Bay of Islands, Tuatara welcomed them, and sought to repay, in some measure,
the kindness he had received. These laymen were soon joined by Mr, Kendall,
and in 1815, the Rev. John Butler, the first Clerical Missionary, became one of
their number. Marsden himself wished to accompany the party to New Zealand ;
but the Governor forbade it. News had recently arrived of the destruction of 1 he
Boyd , wherein all on board —seventy in number —save one woman and a child
were killed and eaten. 1 “To him (the Governor) as to most others,” says Buller,
“ the whole scheme was but the chimera of a pious enthusiast. He would not
allow his useful life to be so wantonly exposed.”
Returning to Sydney in 1814, Hall and Kendall brought with them Tuatara
and six Chiefs, among whom was the celebrated Hongi. Marsden sheltered, and
on their return accompanied them. And Marsden conducted the first Christian
service held in New Zealand. The Sabbath fell on Christmas Day, and the
1 The frightful massacre of the crew and passengers of The Boyd must be traced to
an indiscretion on the part of Captain Thompson, who was in charge. Loaded tor Eng-
land with Australian produce, having on board her full complement of passengers, some
of whom were reputed wealthy, she was to call at New Zealand for spars. Among her
passengers were the three Maori Chiefs: Te Puhi, Ahera or George, and Ahududu. Dur -
ing the voyage some silver spoons were missing, and George was not only charged v rth
the theft; he was tied up and flogged. Silent, though determined, he resolved to have
satisfaction. When the Captain, w r ith his crew and some passengers were inspecting
spars in the bush, where dwelt George’s tribe, at a given signal, they were all mur-
dered. A visit to the ship at night completed the dark deed; and Mrs. Broughton and
her little girl were alone spared to tell the tale. During the carnival that ensued some
gunpowder was spilled, an explosion followed and the murderers suddenly found them-
selves scattered to the four winds. But George had his revenge!


text was appropriate: “ Behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy.’ Three
of the Chiefs were robed in regimentals given to them by the Governor ; and
in this unusual dress they appeared at the service. Korokoro regulated their
movements by the aid of his switch —also a present from Macquarie ; and Tuatara
fenced in half an acre of land, placed a reading desk in the centre covered with
red cloth, provided seats for the Europeans, and set the English flag floating
above this improvised Church.
And now Leigh’s connection with New Zealand begins. His health having
failed in New South Wales, Marsden suggested a visit to New Zealand in the
interests of the Church Mission and Leigh’s health. This Mission at the Bay
of Islands was the outcome of the views on Mission work which held sway in
England at that date. “ Men must be rational and civilised before they can be
Christians,” said Dr. Lardner ; and the Bishop of Carlisle publicly stated that
“ barbarous nations are unable to hear the truth, and vicious and immoral ones
are incapable of bringing forth the fruits thereof.” During his visit to England
Marsden accepted these erroneous views, and selected New Zealand as a suitable
spot in which to test them. Leigh was to inquire into the plans of these lay
civilisers, and to favour them with his counsels, if necessary. Making the voyage
in May, 1818, he was hospitably received by the three agents of the Mission whom
he found in a dispirited state. They were not allowed to preach ; and misunder-
standings between the families had led to the suspension of all religious meetings.
He remained with them for nine months, visiting six of the nearest villages in
succession, which he formed into a Circuit, and with the help of the lay Mission-
aries arranged for a service in each village every Sabbath Day. This regular
system of labour led to improved zeal and usefulness among the lay agents,
which Leigh witnessed with much satisfaction. Opportunities for protesting
against heathen practices were frequent. On one occasion Leigh raided the
Queen’s hut, and rescued her child from a premeditated death through neglect;
and at another time he expostulated with a Chief who had exposed twelve human
heads, beautifully tattooed, in the hope that he would buy them! At the end of
the nine months, he returned to Sydney much benefited in health.
The year 1820 found him in England preparing for the project to which he
felt God had called him. His visit to New Zealand had filled his heart with a
desire to take possession of those beautiful islands in the name of Jesus Christ,
and on behalf of the Wesleyan Missionary Society. Calling upon the Rev.
Joseph Taylor, at the Mission House, he was afforded an opportunity of meeting
Jabez Bunting and Richard Watson, who, with Mr. Taylor, were then the Sec-
retaries. To them, Leigh set forth the necessity of extending the work in Aus-
tralia and attempting the establishment of new Missions in New Zealand and the
Lriendly Islands. “I am prepared,” said he, “to take the one, and Brother Lawry
the other, of those untried fields of labour.” “ Sir,” said Mr. Taylor, “what are
you talking aboutP With a debt of Tio,ooo, we are not in a condition either
to enlarge the old, or undertake the establishment of new Missions.” The
interview ended there, but not so the project. That night was spent in prayer.


and guidance came with the daybreak. It was not money alone Leigh needed ;
if he could obtain articles for the purposes of barter, they would answer the
same purpose. He therefore formulated a scheme of which the Secretaries
approved ; and the Conference, which met at Liverpool, discussed and then
sanctioned the establishment of these Missions. It also authorised Leigh to visit
provincial towns, to which he was invited for the purpose of realising the means
to accomplish his object. In September, 1820, he received a letter from Jabez
Bunting, in which he was informed that the Conference had agreed to appoint
several Missionaries to the Islands named; and that he was permitted to visit
any places “ in this kingdom,” to obtain articles of manufacture in aid of the
South Sea Missions. Thus armed, Leigh made a successful tour of the pro-
vinces. Sheffield gave him several tons of goods ; Manchester, Liverpool and
Birmingham sent numerous articles in the manufacture of which they were famous.
From Captain Irving, of Bristol, came a large tent, which proved of great service
in New Zealand ; while one charitable lady sent him one hundred wedding rings.
These contributions were packed in old casks, which had previously contained
wine, beer and porter, but which were now consecrated to a nobler use. Mr.
Taylor had some difficulty in finding room for this miscellaneous cargo , but
Leigh had no difficulty in disposing of it. For five years it almost entirely sup-
ported the Mission. That it was dispensed with care was proved thirty years
afterwards by documentary evidence, which came into the hands of Leigh s
biographer. On his death bed, Leigh said; “ These men who accuse us and our
establishment of extravagance, utter slander in ignorance or enmity.” During his
speeches, he often described the character of the Maoris. His description on one
occasion did not commend itself to a supporter of the Church Mission: he was
shocked, so he said, at Leigh’s exaggerated statements; and he felt it his duty
publicly to contradict the remark that the New Zealanders were cannibals. “ You
had better not,” said Leigh, “ for I have seen them eat one another; and there
can be no exaggeration in describing the character of a man who roasts and eats
his fellow.”
His arrangements being complete, Leigh left Gravesend in The Brixton ,
April 28th, 1821 ; and landed in Sydney on Sunday, September 16th, of the same
year, arriving in February of next year at the Bay of Islands. As a fellow-pas-
senger he had with him his bride, formerly Miss Clewes, of Staffordshire, with
whom he was intimately acquainted in early life. She was an invaluable com-
panion, and a person of good sense, deep piety, and indomitable courage. Sne
died a few years later at Parramatta. Of her he could say, as Samuel Wesley
said of Susanna Wesley:
“ She graced my humble roof and blessed my life,
Blessed me with a far greater name than wife.’
Leigh and his brother Missionaries were furnished by the Committee with
the following instructions for their guidance;
1 We recommend to you, in the first place and above all things, to pay
-due attention to your personal piety ; which, by prayer, self-denial, holy diligence,
•and active faith in Him who loved you and gave Himself for you, must be kept


in a lively, vigorous and growing state. Set before you constantly the example
of the holy Apostle: “ This one thing I do ; forgetting those things which are
behind, and reaching forth unto those things which are before, I press towards
the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.” —(Phil, hi.,
13, 14.) Amidst all your reading, studies, journeyings, preaching, and other
labours, let the prosperity of your own souls in the Divine life be carefully culti-
vated ; and then a spirit of piety will dispose you to the proper performance
of your ministerial duties; and, by a holy re-action, such a discharge of duty
will increase your personal religion.
11. We wish to impress on your minds the absolute necessity of using every
means of mental improvement with an express view to your great work as
Christian Ministers. You are furnished with useful books, the works of men of
distinguished learning and piety. We recommend to you to acquire an increase
of that general knowledge which, if the handmaid of Piety, will increase your
qualifications for extensive usefulness. But more especially, we press upon you
the absolute necessity of studying Christian Divinity, the doctrines of salvation
by the cross of Christ, “ which things the Angels desire to look into.” They
exercise their minds, which excel in strength, in the contemplation of those
precious truths which you are called to explain and illustrate. Let all your reading
and studies have a reference to this. You are to teach Religion: you must, there-
fore, understand Religion well. You are to disseminate the knowledge of
Christianity, in order to the salvation of men ; let the Bible then be your book ;
and let all other books be read only in order to obtain a better acquaintance with
the Holy Scriptures, and a greater facility in explaining, illustrating, and apply-
ing their important contents. We particularly recommend to you to read and
digest the writings of Wesley and Fletcher, and the useful commentaries with
which you are furnished, which are designed and calculated to increase your
knowledge of the sacred Volume. Like the Baptist, you must be “ burning
and shining lights,” and, therefore, recollect every day, that whilst you endeavour
by reading, meditation, and conversation, to increase your stock of useful know-
ledge, it is necessary for you to acquire a proportionate increase of holy fervour.
111. We exhort you, Brethren, to unity of affection, which will not fail to
produce unity of action. Let your love be without dissimulation. In honour
prefer one another. On this subject we beseech you to pay a practical regard
to the advice of the venerable Founder of our Societies, the Rev. John Wesley.
With his characteristic brevity, he inquires, “ What can be done in order to a
closer union of our Preachers with each other? Ans. 1. Let them be deeply
convinced of the absolute necessity of it. 2. Let them pray for an earnest
desire of union. 3. Let them speak freely to each other. 4. When they meet,,
let them never part without prayer. 5. Let them beware how they despise each
other’s gifts. 6. Let them never speak slightingly of each other in any kind.
/. Let them defend one another’s character in every thing, to the utmost of their
power. And, 8. Let them labour in honour to prefer each other before himself.’*

CROWN STUDIOS.
THE REV. GEORGE BROWN D.D.
President, 1895.


IV. Remember always, dear Brethren, that you are by choice and on con-
viction WESLEYAN-METHODIST PREACHERS; and, therefore, it is
expected and required of you, to act in all things in a way consistent with that
character. In your manner of preaching, and of administering the various ordin-
ances of God’s house, keep closely to the model exhibited by your Brethren at
home. Indeed, you have solemnly pledged yourselves so to do. You have
promised to preach in the most explicit terms, the doctrines held as scriptural,
and therefore sacred, in the Connexion to which you belong. We advise, however,
in so doing, that you avoid all spirit of controversy, in your mode of stating and
enforcing Divine truths. While you firmly maintain that ground which we, as a
body, have seen it right to take, cultivate a Catholic spirit towards all your fellow-
labourers in the work of evangelizing the heathen ; and aid them to the utmost of
your power in their benevolent exertions. You have engaged also to pay a
conscientious regard to our discipline. We need not tell you, that all the parts
of that discipline are of importance ; and that, taken together, they form a body
of rules and usages, which appear to meet all the wants of individuals who are
seeking the salvation of their souls ; and, under the Divine influence and blessing,
to promote the prosperity of every society. We also particularly press upon your
constant attention and observance, Mm Wesley’s Twelve Rules of a Helper.
V. \\ e cannot omit, without neglecting our duty, to warn you against
meddling with the political parties, or secular disputes. You are teachers of
Religion ; and that alone should be kept in view. It is, however, a part of your
duty as Ministers, to enforce, by precept and example, a cheerful obedience to
lawful authority. You know that the venerable Wesley was always distinguished
by his love to his country, by his conscientious loyalty, and by his attachment to
that illustrious family which has so long filled the throne of Great Britain. You
know that your Brethren at home are actuated by the same principles and walk
by the same rule ; and we have confidence in you that you will preserve the
same character of religious regard to good order and submission “ to the powers
that be ”■—in which we glory. Our motto is, “ Fear God, and Honour the King” ;
and we recollect who hath said, “ Put them in mind to be subject to principalities
and powers, to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work.”
VI. You will, on a foreign station, find yourselves in circumstances very
different from those in which you are at home, with regard to those who are in
authority under our gracious Sovereign. It is probable you will frequently come
under their immediate notice and observation. We are, however, persuaded that,
while you demean yourselves' as you ought, you will be generally favoured with
their protection. On your arrival at your stations, you will be instructed what
steps to take in order to obtain the protection of the local Governments: and we
trust that your subsequent good behaviour towards Governors, and all who are in
authority, will be such as shall secure to you the enjoyment of liberty to instruct
and promote the salvation of those to whom you are sent.
VII. It is peremptorily required of every Missionary in our Connexion to
keep a Journal, and to send home frequently such copious abstracts of it as may
give a full and particular account of his labours, success and prospects. He is


also required to give such details of a religious kind as may be generally interest-
ing to the friends of Missions at home ; particularly, accounts of conversions.
Only, we recommend to you, not to allow yourselves, under the influence of
religious joy, to give any high colouring of facts: but always write accounts as you
would not object to see return in print to the place where the facts reported have
occurred.
VIII. It is a positive rule amongst the Wesleyan Methodists, that no Travel-
ling Preacher shall “ follow trade.” You are to consider this rule as binding upon
you, and all Foreign Missionaries in our Connexion. We wish you to be at the
remotest distance from all temptation to a secular or mercenary temper. “No
man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of life, that he may please
Him who hath called him to be a soldier.” Independently of the moral and
religious considerations which enforce this principle, we here take occasion to
remind you that all your time and energies should be the more sacredly devoted
to the duties of your mission, because the Committee feel themselves fully
pledged to pay an affectionate attention to all your wants, and to afford them
every reasonable and necessary supply. And this pledge, they doubt not, the
generosity of the friends of Missions will from time to time, enable them to
redeem, so long as you continue to regulate your expenses by as much of con-
scientious regard to economy, as may be found to consist with your health and
comfort, and with the real demands of the Work of God.
And now, Brethren, we commend you to God and the word of His grace.
We unite with tens of thousands in fervent prayer to God for you. May He open
to you a great door and effectual; and make you, immediately or remotely, the
instruments of the salvation of myriads. We shall incessantly pray, that “ you
may go out with joy, and be led forth with peace ; that instead of the thorn may
come up the fir-tree, and instead of the briar the myrtle-tree ; and it shall be to
the Lord for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be cut off.” “ Blessed
be the Lord God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things ; and
blessed be His glorious name for ever, and let the whole earth be filled with His
glory: Amen and Amen.”
The Committee also set out the following plan of operations, which were
read to Leigh in City Road Chapel:
As you are apppointed to superintend the Missions to New Zealand and
Tongataboo, we recommend to you great kindness and mildness of manner to
your Brethren ; as well as great prudence and economy in the management of
the whole of our affairs. There must be no inequality among you ; you must
submit to privations in common, and all your comforts must be equally shared.
It is recommended, that you purchase by barter not more than 500 acres
of land, at a fair remuneration to the natives, for the use of the Mission at New
Zealand ; and if it be thought expedient, not more than the same quantity at
T ongataboo.


That you, as soon as possible, and in the most economical manner, erect
at the place of your location in New Zealand, suitable premises for a School,
a room for public worship, and three suites of apartments, one for the residence
of each family, all under the same roof ; that there be a common room, in which
the meals of the whole Mission-family may be taken together, and family worship
regularly performed. Ihe same is to be done at Tongataboo. Each family to
have-for its separate use one sitting-room and one sleeping-room for the present.
That all articles furnished from time to time, for barter, for the use of the
Mission, shall, both at New Zealand and Tongataboo, be considered as common
stock, in no case to be appropriated to his convenience and use by any individual
Missionary, either for building, purchase of land, provisions or other expenditure.
That one of the Brethren shall be appointed Secretary to each Mission,
whose business it shall be to enter into a book to be provided for that purpose,
all the articles sent out for barter, from time to time, by the committee, and those
first taken by the Brethren, and that no articles shall be taken out of the common
stock, to be bartered or otherwise made use of, but by consent of at least two of
the Brethren, whilst the number shall be three in each station : or when the number
shall be increased, of two-thirds of the whole, and not without an entry being
made at the time of the number and kind of articles so taken out of the stock,
and the purposes for which they are to be bartered ; which entry is to be signed
m the hand-writing of the Missionaries in the first instance, and two-thirds, when
the number shall be increased. The Secretary shall be required to make copies,
half-yearly, of the book-account of all stores received, expended, and on hand,
with the various purposes to which the expenditures have been applied, and to
transmit them to the Committee, made up half-yearly, to lune 30, and December
31, of each year, in duplicates by the first vessel. These duplicates, as well as
the original, are to be signed by all the Brethren on each station. At Tonga-
taboo, as long as there shall be but two Brethren employed on the Mission, the
stores to be employed only by the joint consent of both.
The Secretaries to each Mission shall, with his half-yearly account, also inform
the Committee what articles are most in request among the natives for barter ;
and also state the rise or fall in the value of the various articles, as the case may be.
That for the purpose of articles of food for the Mission family, each of the
Brethren shall in rotation, week by week, be appointed to barter with the
natives, one only at the same time being empowered to transact that business;
and that each of the wives also, in weekly rotation, take the charge of cooking
the provisions and preparing the meals for the common table. The rotation to be
so regulated, that the wife of the Brother who purchases the articles of food,
shall superintend its preparation for the same week.
That a fowling-piece be furnished to each Missionary, but that no barter
shall be allowed in muskets, or warlike weapons of any kind.
The Missionaries at New Zealand and I ongataboo will be expected to
establish schools for the children of the nativesand, as soon as practicable,
bring the natives to contribute to the support of the children of those schools.


At each of those stations, the Committee will allow for the support of those
schools, to the value in goods, of £SO per annum. And the Brethren and their
wives are directly to adopt such methods of instruction as they may, on mutual
consultation, judge most suitable, and that they themselves act as teachers.
That on each of these Missions, £so per annum shall be allowed to each
married Missionary, and £\2 per annum for each child, as quarterage, and that
the Society send out, from time to time, as many suits of clothes as each Mis-
sionary may order, to be charged to his account; and any surplus of cash, due
to him as the balance of the above named allowance be paid to him either in
goods or cash, as he may direct.
That as each Mission family will need, from year to year, a supply of salt,
butter, tea, coffee, sugar, soap, and a few similar articles, from New South Wales,
a sum not exceeding £4O shall be allowed for this purpose, to be drawn for by
the Superintendent of the New South Wales Mission.
1 hat the settlement of New Zealand shall be named after Mr. Wesley, and
that at Tongataboo after Dr. Coke, the compound name to be determined by the
site of the location.
That the Brethren shall endeavour to introduce the knowledge of agriculture
and such useful arts as they know among the natives; and that they shall bring
as much of the land, which they may purchase for the use of the Mission, gradu-
ally into cultivation as may ultimately supply them with the necessaries of life.
That Ziioo shall be allowed for the purchase of cattle and other articles of
immediate subsistence to be taken from Botany Bay, if that sum be necessary;
but it is hoped that the cattle and other articles may be obtaaied by the favour
of friends in New South Wales, at least in part.
That ABO be allowed for furniture, as per list, for the Mission House in New
Zealand.

Richard Watson, J
Leigh’s nine months’ residence in New Zealand had given him some know-
ledge of the people to whom he was about to devote his efforts. “ I felt,” he
said, when nearing the shore, “as if divested of all spiritual strength. We were
running in upon a nation of ferocious and blood-thirsty heathens, where there
was no power to protect, and while the country was convulsed by war. Never
shall I forget the agony of mind I endured, until reflection brought me to feel
that I was surrounded by the Divine perfections, and that a hair could not fall
from our heads without the concurrence of God.” The Church Mission agents
again received him most cordially ; while the natives were so pleased at his return
that they rubbed his nose until the skin was removed entirely from the point.
But trouble soon came ; and from an unexpected quarter. Marsden had supplied
Leigh with two line asses, which the natives mistook for large pigs. During the
night the asses wandered on sacred ground, not knowing it to be tapu. For this

offence their legs were tied, they were put on board a canoe and left on a desolate
island. Leigh secured them next day, and in the presence, and for the pacification
of the natives, lectured them roundly for their ingratitude and indecency. Then
the asses were pardoned. Marsden had previously lost two valuable horses for
the same offence ; while an intrepid rooster, which persisted in perching on a small
building made tapu , had to suffer permanent banishment.
Is it to be wondered at that Leigh endured agony of mind while contemplat-
ing his prospective field of labour? The Maoris thought little of life They were
cold-blooded and revengeful, even killing, roasting and devouring their own
children. “ Their conversation was sensual, their ideas filthy, and their language
obscene. Chastity was rare, if known at all. They were given to sorcery, witch-
craft, murder.” —( Buller , Forty Years in New Zealand, p. 207.) Words need
not be multiplied ; one incident only will serve as an index to their awful character.
When the Chief Hongi went to battle with Hinaki, the latter was shot. Hongi
scooped out the eye of the dying Chief, swallowed it, and drank the warm blood
as it flowed from the throat into which he had plunged his English knife.
It was Leigh’s intention to form his station at Mercury Bay ; but in this
purpose he was thwarted by the action of Llongi, who, with Waikato had visited
England. This visit had fired Hongi’s ambition and increased the intensity of his
desire for distinction and blood. Hinaki was favourable to this proposal, when
Hongi stepped in to say that he had a little difference to settle with Hinaki.
During his absence one of his people had been killed, and he must have satis-
faction ; he intended, therefore, to sweep that people from the face of the earth.
At the head of three thousand men, Hongi invaded Hinaki s territory, and the
destruction of the natives there was complete. Hongi’s return had plunged the
country into a war which lasted five years, and entirely changed the fact <>f
things. Hongi had extreme difficulty in procuring muskets, which he thought
was occasioned by the interference of the Missionaries. He therefore shunned
them and became reserved and irritable, though he promised Mr. Leigh that he
would protect him. The natives followed his example, and icfusc dto work
unless paid with firearms. .
Leigh was now joined by Mr. James Stack, whom he had known previously,
and wflio felt called to devote his life to Mission work in New Zealand. Mr.
Stack was duly accepted as a Wesleyan Missionary ; but after some years service
he joined the Church Mission. Leigh now determined to seek another spot,
and with five Maoris, he set sail for the North on a tour of inspection. Storm-
driven, they were forced to seek shelter in Wangaroa Harbour, where The Boyd
massacre had taken place. The natives granted them the use of a hut, into
which Leigh crawled, and was soon soundly sleeping. In the night he was dis-
turbed by one of his men pulling his legs; “Do you not hear, he said, that
they are quarrelling about the time for roasting and eating us to-morrow ?” But
Leigh was indifferent ;in quietness and confidence he found his strength. With
Te Ara, he sailed around the harbour and succeeded afterwards m
effecting his escape by the lavish distribution of fish-hooks. Returning home he
made a second tour of inspection, accompanied by the Rev. J. Butler in the


Church Mission boat, which was placed at his service. Though Oruru Valley
and Wangarei were inspected, the party finally decided on Wangaroa. It may
be of interest to add a list of the expenses incurred on Leigh’s first visit in
selection of a suitable Mission site. “ One piece of salt pork, seven pounds ;
one piece of bacon, seven pounds ; three quarts of rice ; one and a half pounds of
tea ; three and a half pounds of sugar ; six bottles of porter; two bottles of
brandy; three hundred fish-hooks; twelve knives; four razors; six pairs of
scissors and two axes. To four natives who navigated the boat, one hundred
and fifty fish-hooks.”—(. Leigh's Life , p. 178.)
On the sth July, 1822, Leigh made another visit to Wangaroa Harbour,
travelling on board The St Michael , under the command of Captain Beveridge.
In this magnificent harbour they anchored, and on the following Sunday (Bth
June), Leigh conducted the first religious service ever held in that part of New
Zealand. His text was I. Sam. vii., 12. “ Hitherto hath the Lord helped us.”
He saw the remains of The Boyd\ and he also saw vegetables growing, the
seeds of which had been left by Captain Cook. The next morning they sailed
up the river for twelve miles to the residences of George and his brother Tepui.
In this beautiful and fertile valley a site for the Mission was chosen, and a rude
building was erected on the hill side. One of the first sights Leigh witnessed
on the following Sabbath, was the arrival of a canoe with slaves, one of whom
was killed, roasted, and eaten in the village. The station, situated about twelve
miles from the harbour, and known as Wesleydale, “was sequestered among
hills and mountains of almost every size and shape ; most of them covered
with excellent pine trees ; many running from sixty to a hundred feet without a
branch, and their trunks from three to six feet in diameter. The soil around,
as will be imagined, was very fertile.”— (Turners Life, p. 43.) But even the
beauties of this lovely spot could not compensate for all their troubles. The
thievish habits of the people sorely taxed their patience, the rough-built tene-
ment afforded sorry shelter from the heavy rains, Leigh was forced to sleep in
a cask which had contained stores, and the natives often refused food supplies
unless they could receive an equivalent in fire-arms, against the supply of which,
the Wesley Missionaries resolutely set their faces. It would have been well
if the same remark applied to every other Missionary agent; but it is to be
feared that this was not so.
Arrangements were now made for religious services, morning, noon and
night, to which the natives were freely admitted. During the next month the
settlement was greatly disturbed by the arrival of a war party from the Bay of
Islands. Hostilities at once commenced in front of the Mission premises, which
were attacked by order of Tepui. They entered the enclosure, and “ after
repeated assaults,” says Leigh, “ they were unable to force open the door ; and,
towards evening, the Bay of Islands’ Chief desired an interview with Tepui;
when, after mutual explanations, they became friends, and ratified the agreement
by an exchange of muskets. This day has proved to us the necessity of living
above the fear of death. There was much disturbance about our dwelling during
the night ; but we rested in peace.”— {Leigh's Life, p. 192.) Next day. on


distributing a box of axes among them they withdrew, and the work proceeded
quietly. Leigh, anticipating the future, now purchased the five acres of land
facing the Mission premises. The original possessors of the land were asked to
state their demands, which were taken down and the list read over to them.
Asked if that were all, Leigh insisted on doubling what they asked. When in
later years, the equity of all such purchases was tested by order of the British
Government, it was declared in open Court that the property at Wangaroa had
been settled on the most honourable terms. Mrs. Leigh formed the girls into
a class and taught them the value of soap and the use of the needle ; while
Mr. Leigh showed the men how to cultivate the land and sow it with wheat
Mr. and Mrs. Leigh were now greatly cheered by the arrival of reinforce-
ments in the persons of Mr. White, Mr. Hobbs, Mr. and Mrs. Turner, with Miss
Bedford who accompanied Mrs. Turner. 2 The Missionaries rejoiced together
and encouraged each other in their self-denying labours. Messrs. Turner and
Hobbs found their Brethren, tools in hand, working at their dwelling. 1 hree
days after Mr. Turner’s arrival, Mr. and Mrs. Leigh, accompanied by Mr. Mars-
den, took their hnal departure from Wangaroa in The Schnapper for the Bay of
Islands en route for Sydney. The Brompton , which was to take them from the
Bay of Islands, was detained ; and when she did sail, an easterly gale sprang up,
she missed stays, struck a sunken rock, began to fill immediately, and after-
wards went to pieces. Mr. and Mrs. Leigh, with Mr. Marsden, were put on
shore on a desolate island without food or shelter of any kind ; while the Captain
put off in a boat for New Zealand. Here they remained three days and three
nights, with no other food than some potatoes, which two natives, who, like
themselves were storm driven, kindly left them. On the fourth day a small
vessel, containing friends from the Bay of Islands, came to their rescue ; and
on the 15th November, they left in The Dragon on her way from Tahiti to New
South Wales. Leigh’s health was shattered.
To follow the Mission party through its night of toil, to attempt a record
of its trials and struggles, and to give particulars of its ultimate triumphs cannot
be done here, though one is strongly tempted to dwell upon the fascinating
story. But the aim of this chapter is simply to glance at the New Zealand
Mission in its relationship to New South Wales. The Mission party lived
together as one family, giving effect, as far as possible, to the Committee’s
plan of operations. Prayer and Class meetings were regularly held, and at
least one English service on the Sabbath. To this practice Mr. Turner attri-
buted blessed results. A more eligible site was selected for the Mission, and
the frame of the cottage taken by Mr. Leigh from Sydney, was put together,
It is superfluous to add that the natives caused great anxiety. The irrepressible
Hongi was much in evidence. The Chief, George, who played so prominent a
part in The Boyd fatality, was constant in his attentions ; and the rank and file
followed the example of their Chiefs. Mrs. Turner and her maid were threatened
with the fate that befel the hapless sailors ; and George confidently told Mr.
2 Miss Bedford afterwards became? Mrs. Lancelot Iredale of Sydney.


I urner that when his heart rested where nature intended it to be, he loved him
very much ; but when it rose to his throat he could kill him in a minute. It was
very often in his throat! The everlasting tapn caused frequent strife. A
scrofulous boy, the son of a Chief, had his garments boiled in an iron pot.
The pot therefore was sacred and must forthwith be forfeit. The teapot was
stolen ; the dinner cooked in the yard was carried off —oven and all; and the
clothes on the line on washing day were a weekly temptation. But worse than
all, and sickening in its effects upon the Missionaries was the shameless roasting
and eating of human bodies. This was the depth of degradation reserved for
the Maoris’ enemies. Running one day to ascertain the cause of some com-
motion, the Missionaries found the body of an old man roasting between two
logs.
Ihe Missionaries however toiled bravely on. In six months they were
able to teach the children in the open air. Then two temporary, rough buildings
were put up in the chief villages to serve as Schools and Chapels. These
buildings were formally consecrated to God on Sunday, June 13th, 1824. They
were the first Wesleyan Churches built in New Zealand. A Maori hymn was
sung; Mr. Kendall, who unexpectedly was present, prayed in the same language,
Mr. White prayed in English and then addressed the congregation, fifty in
number, and Mr. Shepherd interpreted with great fluency. The Missionary hymn
From all that dwell below the skies,
Let the Creator’s praise arise.”
concluded the service. The dedication of the second Chapel was a repetition of
the same ceremony. The work now gave promise of success. Messrs. Tyer-
man and Bennett, of the London Missionary Society, had visited the Island in
The Endeavour , and their report was favourable. They came very near death,
however. The natives had them at their mercy ; and but for the timely arrival
of Mr. White and George, they would doubtless have been murdered. George’s
interposition was attributed to the influence of the Mission. Nothing of great
moment transpired for some months, though Mr. Turner observed that the
natives were becoming hostile. During March, 1825, both Mr. White and Mr.
Turner were attacked by Ahudu, a principal Chief. Mr. White escaped with
a few cuts and bruises. Mr. Turner’s injuries were more serious. The natives
now seized the whaling brig Mercury , which had put into the harbour for sup-
plies. The influence of Messrs. White and Stack saved the loss of life, though
it could save nothing else. The impression produced in the native mind by
this plunder was not favourable. Arrayed in grotesque and ludicrous style, the
thieves began a hideous dance before the Mission premises.
Ihe agents of the Church Mission now made a visit to Wangaroa for the
purposes of counsel and advice. As the result of these deliberations, Mr.
Turner wrote thus to the General Committee:—“ It was the unanimous opinion
of our friends present that our lives were in danger, and that we ought to leave
as speedily as we could and in the best way possible. Their decision was
influenced by the following considerations :-ist. The conduct of the natives

towards ourselves in the affair above mentioned ; spearing me and assaulting
Mr. White. 2nd. The taking of the brig Mercury. 3 r( T The speculation that
the different tribes around the Bay of Islands would come against our people
and punish them. 4th. The probability that Europeans might call them to
account, and, if so, it being very likely that we should fall victims to their rage
and malice. sth. That, after such base conduct, should we continue amongst
them, it might be injurious to our Brethren at the Bay of Islands, as their
natives might take occasion from the conduct of ours, to behave ill towards them.
6th. That George, one of our principal Chiefs, was dangerously ill, and had
requested, in the case of his death, that the natives of Shukeanga would come,
and strip us of all we possess, if not kill us, as utu, or payment for the death
of his father, who had been killed through the taking of Ihe Boyd , and for
whom he says he has never yet had ‘ satisfaction.’ This report is believed by
our friends ; and I have been repeatedly told by his brothers that when he dies
we shall be ‘ ka wait' ‘broken,’ or stripped of all, and that this request must
be looked upon as the last will of one who was about to enter the world of
spirits ; and made to those to whom revenge is sweet. Viewing the case in
this serious light, we could not disapprove of the conclusion come to by our
Brethren, who, I believe, as Brethren, feel for us and our cause. But, though
our judgment approved of the measures recommended, our feelings have not
suffered us to take any steps towards carrying it into execution. And we now
think it will be best to continue at our post for the present, and quietly wait
for the salvation of God!”
They had not long to wait for further developments. Shunghee sent word
that the Missionaries were to leave to enable him to make war upon the Wan-
garoans ; and he sent a canoe, seven feet wide and seventy feet long, for their
accommodation. Messrs. White and Elobbs took a-boat load of things away,
while Mr. Turner and Mr. Stack remained in possession. “ The thought of
leaving the place,” says Mr. Turner, “which a few months before had seemed
so promising, was almost more than I could bear. Though our lives appeared
in danger, it was one of the greatest crosses I ever had to take up, to give my
voice that we should depart!” Shunghee, however, recalled his expedition, and
George died; and though an attack was designed and debated, Te Puhi pre-
vented it. George had expressed a wish that they should be kind to the
Missionaries. Though several hostile tribes were camped near, tranquillity
seemed assured, and Mr. White having left for England, the trio remaining
proceeded with their Missionary labours, not without encouragement.
In the midst of unrest and excitement, the Missionaries toiled on through
the winter of 1826, when another invasion was imminent. Hongi sent word
to the Wesleydale tribes to leave their food and fly for their lives ; for, if he
saw the face of any of them, they would be killed. Three hundred strong,
they entered the valley, broke into the Missionaries’ garden, threatened to spear
Mr. Hobbs, and demanded the surrender of a slave girl whom Mr. Turner had
redeemed. A few nights afterwards the natives came on afresh. Luke Wade,


whose duty was that of watchman for the night, roused the party at daybreak,
as the natives were coming up to the house. Their greeting was “We have
come to take away your property, and you must be gone.” They soon gave
effect to their threat. Wade’s house was broken into and every available article
on the premises was carried to the canoes. Windows were next smashed, doors
broken down, and the beds purloined. The Missionaries now felt that they
must leave ; for when the goods were gone, the savages would turn their atten-
tion to their persons. While the thieves were busy at the back door, the Mis-
sionaries escaped by way of the front. When Mrs. 'I urner was about to leave,
a savage raised his weapon to cleave her to the ground. But his hand was
stayed by God. For greater security, the Missionaries had placed a part of their
stores above the ceiling, where the marauders, in poking with their spears had
disturbed them. Just at the psychological moment a shower of nails fell on the
dusky warrior s head: and the fall was so sudden and unaccountable that it
gave rise to many thoughts, during the contemplation of which Mrs. Turner
mercifully escaped.
What words can describe the agony and torturing suspense of that journey
of twenty miles to the Church Mission Station ? The company comprised Mr.
and Mrs. Turner and three children, the youngest five weeks and two days old :
Luke Wade and his wife, who had not long arrived from England, and Mr.
Hobbs and Miss Davis from Paihai. Wading the river several times, intercepted
by another war party from Hokianga, from whom Patuone saved them, they
struggled on, till they were met by Mr. Stack and Mr. Clarke. Other friends
met them further on the road, and eventually, like Paul and his ship-wrecked
companions, they all safely reached their destination at Marsden’s Vale. Once
again among Christian friends, they were lovingly entertained by the Rev. H.
Williams and his wife. On -the following Sunday (14th January, 1827), Mr.
Turner preached from the words: “These are they which came out of great
tribulation.” The Lord’s Supper was partaken of, and he baptised his infant
son. The plunderers did their work quite in harmony with previous records.
Hongi’s tribe stole all it could carry away ; and Hokianga made the sacrifice
complete. The premises were burnt to ashes ; the live stock was killed, and
the savage barbarians even dug up the coffin of Mr. Turner’s infant child to
secure the blanket which they supposed contained the body. Mr. Turner’s
library they fully appreciated. They tore it in shreds for cartridges. Two
books only were left, and they were secured by the Rev. Samuel Marsden
during a visit made at a later date.
Thus ends the first chapter in the romantic story of the New Zealand
Mission. It has worthily been designated “ one of the most noble, best sus-
tained, and protracted struggles to graft Christianity ” upon a savage nation.
The succeeding chapters must be told elsewhere, as the Conference of 1826
formed New Zealand and Tonga into a District, making it independent of and
separate from New South Wales. When the complete story of this Mission is
told, and by whomsoever it is recorded, let not the heroic conduct of this band

of men and women be overlooked, or held too lightly. 1 heir action in lea\ mg
their station has been the subject of adverse comment. But the critics, like the
poor, are always with us. We have no other words than those of praise, and
no other feelings than those of admiration for their patient continuance. Mr.
Turner clearly states the position when he says: “I have never for an hour,
amidst all our trials and dangers at Wangaroa, entertained the thought of leaving
the place unless absolutely compelled.” And Mrs. Turner, when stripped of
all, pleadingly asked her husband: “ Cannot we remain and prosecute our
Mission somewhere in the land ? ’ They could not remain, for God s hand was
guiding them elsewhere; and in Tonga they found a sphere of great blessed-
ness. Disappointed, though not disheartened, the Committee sought the help
of the Governor and Shunghee, and resolved to try once again. Mr. Stack and
Mr. Hobbs, with his wife, returned after six months’ stay in Sydney ; and being
joined by Mr. White, who was appointed Chairman, the Mission was again under-
taken, and successfully established.

CHAPTER VIII.
THE REV. JOSEPH ORTON’S SUPERIN-
TENDENCY.
OBSERVANT travellers have stated that in whatever part of Australia
they have wandered traces of the Aborigines’ presence were found in
curious carvings on the rocks. Students of Methodist history in this
land will bear testimony to the impress of Joseph Orton’s hand upon
the foundation work of the Church. Leigh was the pioneer Missionary
of Methodism in Australia, and he did a noble work. But Joseph Orton was
the Builder, and from the material he found lying around him, he built
up the foundations of a structure standing broad and strong to-day. It is cause
for constant regret that justice has not been done to this good man’s memory;
and that the great work he did for Methodism has never been set before the
public. This should be done, if for no other reason than that the Methodists
of to-day may know in some measure, if not in full, what the pioneer Missionaries
endured in their efforts to preach the Gospel of Peace, and to plant Methodism
in the Southern Seas.
When the call of the Church came to Joseph Orton to become Superinten
dent of the South Sea Missions, he was labouring in the Bury St. Edmunds
Circuit, where he was stationed on his return from the West Indies. Strange
now to relate, he had been imprisoned there for preaching the Gospel to the
slaves. Landing at Jamaica in 1826, he found that the Missionaries had to
encounter persecution from the slave-holders while ministering to the unfortunate
slave population. In addition to this injustice, Mr. Orton received a letter from
the Clerk of Peace forbidding him, in austere language, to hold meetings after
6 p.m. “ I endeavoured,” he says, “ with prudent firmness to evince my deter-
mination of pursuing a course in which I was perfectly justified by law and
precedents, having made myself acquainted with the rights of the matter.” On
the following day, he waited on the Chief Magistrate, who, in the most candid
manner, told him that he had been teased by the Church of England Rector
into such a course. The evening services were injurious for various reasons,
the Rector alleged. Nothing daunted, Joseph Orton and his Brother Mission-
aries continued their services, until the Act passed in 1826 by the Governor and
Assembly of Jamaica, prohibiting meetings being held among the slaves after
sunset, or the taking of contributions for charitable or religious purposes was put


in force, and its penalty—imprisonment—fell on the offenders. This iniquitous
Act, specially aimed at Dissenters it is said, put Joseph Orton in prison for six
months. Henceforth he bore in his body the marks of the Lord Jesus ; and
the seeds of the disease which carried him to an early grave, were sown during
his incarceration in a cold, damp, and foul prison.
On his way to Sydney, he spent several weeks in Hobart Town, where he
assisted the Rev. Nathaniel Turner, and addressed the annual Missionary Meet-
ings, giving an account of his persecutions in Jamaica. The cause of his delay
here was found in the tardy discharge of The Auriga , which occupied several
weeks. When in Sydney, he entered heartily into his work, taking in hand
the affairs of the Mission. That this was no easy task may be gathered from the
words of the Rev. Richard Watson to Mr. Orton, prior to leaving England. The
New South Wales Mission, said he, is the only one of our Missions that has
been a disgrace to us! “When I arrived in the District in December, 1831,”
says Mr. Orton, “ the cause was indeed low, with but little prospect of success,
excepting in Van Dieman’s Land —and even in that place the Society at Hobart
Town was in a disturbed state. From several unpleasant circumstances, their
preacher, Mr. Hutchinson, had been induced to give up his charge and leave the
Connexion. My path in Sydney was at first exceedingly rough in endeavouring
to raise the tone of discipline—and my duties arduous on account of having
the entire business of the Islands upon me.”—( Journals , vol. i., p. 221.) “ I
met a people,” he writes at another time, “ whose suspicions as to the character
of a Wesleyan Missionary had from circumstances been excited, and of which,
I, in some measure, became the subject.”-— {lbid., p. 151.) With that business-
like despatch, for which he afterwards became well-known, Mr. Orton summoned
the Missionaries to the District Meeting. “ I was greatly pleased.” says
Nathaniel Turner, who had travelled from Hobart Town to be present, “with
the spirit and wisdom with which Mr. Orton conducted the meeting, but much
pained by the disclosures made in answer to the searching inquiries as to moral
character, and the proper exercise of discipline. The new Chairman wept like
a child in deep sympathy for those concerned ; and, poor man, after all his
pity and tenderness, he was called to much suffering in consequence of the
faithful discharge of his duty. I, too, shared in the reproaches of the misinformed
in these matters, because I had been faithful to my conscience and my God in
the information it behoved me to give. How true the saying of the wise
man : ‘ One sinner destroyeth much good !’ ” — {Turner s Life, p. 140.)
The spirit in which his work was done may be gathered from his words:
“ My duty to the cause of God and to the Committee is paramount to an)' mere
private feelings of kindness or apparent charity.” In March of the same year
he writes thus to the Committee “ With regard to the progress of this Mission,
I think I understand your opinion to be, that the work having been begun, it
must spread by its own growing resources. Allow me to beg you to re-consider
those views, if lam correct in their having been adopted by you. Please to
take into account the description of the great mass of our population ; and the


infantine state of our Colony, together with the encouragement which is now
afforded by the emigrants who are flocking to our shore. Three more Mis-
sionaries might at this moment be employed very usefully in this Colony. And,
though I dare not guarantee any specific increase in subscriptions towards the
expense, yet I am assured that a considerable increase to our local funds would
be obtained under such circumstances. In Sydney there really must be a second
Preacher appointed. Here is a population of more than fifteen thousand, and
there are but two Churches and one Dissenting place of worship besides our
own. We have two places of worship —that is, Chapels—besides several other
places, where we are called to officiate, and but one Preacher stationed here,
whose time is much taken up with matters referring principally to the Islands,
and which will increase upon the person who has the charge of this District,
in proportion as this Colony rapidly rises in importance and our Island Mission
Stations extend and increase.”
He threw himself heartily into his work and found relief in visiting places
where previously no Wesleyan Missionary had preached. “ This morning ”
Sunday, August igth, 1832 —he writes in his Journal, “I commenced Divine
Service for the first time at Botany Bay. The weather being exceedingly
unfavourable from long continued rains, and heavy rain this day, there were
comparatively few persons in attendance. In the evening I preached at Mac-
quarie Street Chapel to a thin congregation. The people have not yet acquired
that Christian feeling of love and zeal that renders them proof against the
inconvenience of a shower of rain. But unhappily for them, the love of the
world will carry many of them through fire and water. Thank God these words
are not applicable to all!” The next day he writes again: “ This evening I
preached at Prince Street Chapel to a small congregation. I did not feel my mind
at liberty in my work, but rather contracted in my views—and my delivery was
forced. I fear my soul is not sufficiently alive to God, or I should feel more
liberty in declaring His love to man. Personal piety is the very soul and spring
of useful preaching.”
The Missionaries in attendance at the Twelfth Annual District Meeting,
which met in Prince Street Chapel, Tuesday, January igth, 1832, were Joseph
Orton, Chairman, George Erskine, Nathaniel Turner, William Simpson, and John
A. Manton, Secretary. There were several matters of grave importance, demanding
patient and prolonged thought, in the consideration of which, Mr. Orton says,
he found the presence of Mr. Turner of considerable advantage, as he was able
to afford information it would otherwise have been difficult to obtain. The
questions which had previously caused friction required prior attention. The
Committee had ordered Mr. Erskine’s return to England But the District Meet-
ing could not give effect to that decision, as Mr. Erskine’s health, coupled with
the opinion of his medical advisers, forbade such a step; and they therefore
recommended that he remain a Supernumerary in the Colony. Of Mr. Hutch-
inson’s retirement, the District Meeting spoke emphatically. “ The District also
feels it incumbent to express their most decided disapprobation of Mr. Hutch-
inson’s conduct, in thus secularising and abandoning the important work of the

Ministry.” While still a Missionary, he had successfully applied to the Lieut-
Governor of Van Dieman’s Land for a grant of land with a prospective view
to settlement.
The vexed question of allowances was remitted to the Meeting for con-
sideration. And from the fact that it was discussed repeatedly, it is evident
that it was well considered. The Missionaries declared that the allowance for
board was by no means equal to the expenditure upon the most economic scale.
The amount should be increased to 35 s. per week for a married, and 21s. per
week for an unmarried, Missionary. Fuel and candles cost considerably more
than the Committee allowed ; and the District Meeting suggested an advance
of Ai I os. per quarter. In some places as much as 3s. per week was paid for
water ; and this amount could or should be allowed as a water rate. They
concluded their statement thus: “ Though the Brethren have thus appealed for
an increase in their allowances, they will not presume to make any additional
charge until they receive the sanction of the Committee.” By this saving clause
they avoided the rock on which their predecessors had struck with such dire
disaster. The conciliatory spirit had its effect upon the Committee ; for the
District Meeting of 1834 thanked its members for the increased allowances
and their kind consideration, even though they had not seen fit to grant all
that was asked. The question again cropped up in 1835, when most of the
principal articles of provision rose 100 per cent. ; while flour advanced 200 per
cent., and was likely, so they said, to continue at a high rate. Whether this re-
quest was granted does not appear; but as the Committee had expressed its wil-
lingness to hear any statement the Missionaries might make doubtless it was
favourably received.
Another stone of offence with Mr. Orton’s predecessors was the selection and
reception of candidates for the Ministry. The Committee desired every en-
couragement to be given to intending candidates ; but it had strong objections
to the manner in which they had been previously received and appointed to
stations even before the Committee had an opportunity of considering their
qualifications. Mr. Orton therefore, says that upon the taking out
of Preachers, which “ in this District has caused much unpleasantness,” he moved
“ with caution.” His first step was to employ John Leach as a Hired Local
Preacher at the rate of £so per annum ; and his next to recommend Mr. Leach
and Mr. Thomas Wellard as candidates for the Ministry. Mr. Leach was a
nephew of the Rev. W. Leach of England, At the next District Meeting,
Matthew Lassetter, who was married, had four children, and had been a Local
Preacher in the London South Circuit for some years, was recommended as a
candidate. “ I am persuaded,” says the Chairman, “ that he would be an acqui-
sition to our Mission” ; and William Schofield who heard him preach from the
words; “ Set thine house in order,” says that “ his pathetic manner was much
in his favour.” But these recommendations came to nought. Mr. Leach
retired through ill-health, Mr. Lassetter entered into business, and Mr. Wellard’s
offer was not sustained.


Another difficulty to be grappled with was the unsatisfactory state of the
Mission properties, which, with the exception of two Chapels in the Windsor
Circuit were not settled according to Conference plan, and not therefore secured
to the Connexion. With the other properties the original documents had been
drawn up in the names of Messrs. Leigh, Lawry, Mansfield, Carvosso and Hor-
ton, without any provision for transfer or settlement; and it now became neces-
sary to obtain Power of Attorney. The Macquarie-street property was originally
granted by the Government to Messrs. Carvosso, Lawry and Mansfield and their
assigns for ever. “ How my worthy predecessors could be so remiss,” says Mr.
Orton, “ I cannot conjecture.” Mr. James Scott, who gave to the Mission the
Chapel in Prince Street had died suddenly without having executed a deed of
settlement. The District Meeting of 1835 again considered this question and
thus expressed its decision; “ Owing to the peculiar tenure on which property
is held in this country, many difficulties presented themselves. A recent Colonial
enactment has rendered it necessary that all property not regularly granted from
the Crown should pass through a Commissioner’s Court instituted for the specific
purpose of declining claims. After which, all undecided landed property not
having a regular grant from the Crown, or not having the favourable decision
of this Court reverts to the Crown. Under this enactment, some of our prin-
cipal properties have been brought before the Commissioner’s Court and have
received favourable decisions. But as it is attended with considerable expense
we have not yet brought the less important places before this Court. They
therefore remained unsettled and in a precarious state. There are several pro-
perties, for which we have no means of establishing a claim.” —(District Minute
Book , vol. iii.) At their next Meeting, they were able to report a satisfactory
settlement. A special Act of Parliament had been secured, which gave to them
a valid title to the Macquarie Street property and enabled them to dispose of it as
occasion required. A grant from the Government had also been obtained for the
Chapel and Mission House in Prince Street, while the properties at Castlereagh
and Windsor were legally secured. The Mission House site at Windsor being
in a desirable situation for business, its sale was recommended with a view to the
purchase of a more convenient house contiguous to the Chapel, the balance of
the sale money being placed towards the purchase of a Mission House at Parra-
matta.
These matters being disposed of, the Missionaries were able to give greater
attention to higher concerns. “ With regard to the labours and the progress of
religion amongst us,” writes Mr. Orton, on October 26th, 1832, “ I scarcely know
how to write ; sometimes lam on the mount and then in the vale. At Windsor
things go heavily, and I believe Brother Simpson finds it hard work to encourage
himself to go forward. At Parramatta a little encouragement presents itself.
The Society increases slowly ; there is peace and harmony, and the prospects
are rather flattering than otherwise. According to arrangements, I take my turn
at the country Circuits, and have thereby an opportunity of observing more
minutely, and giving my advice as to the proceedings of my Brethren on these
Stations. In Sydney we are doing pretty well. The congregations have greatly


improved, the Society gradually increases, there is perfect harmony among the
members, and I trust a general good feeling towards our cause is rapidly restoring
—though Methodism in this Colony, from several unhappy occurrences, has
received such a stab in the public estimation, that it will be some time before
the tone of feeling in its favour is restored ; during which period it will be
uphill work for your Missionaries In Sydney there is a population
of 15,000 or more, and including the Roman Catholic places of worship, there is
not accommodation or provision for 3,000 persons. Two of our Missionaries
might be very usefully employed in Sydney and its environments, especially
considering that a considerable portion of the time of one is necessarily taken
up with the 1 onga and New Zealand Missions.” —(District Despatch Book , vol.
1., p. 174.)
The state of the Work of God caused them heartfelt regret that it had so
long languished ; and they could not but look back, they said, with painful feel-
ings to those unhappy occurrences “ which have so evidently retarded the progress
of the Work of God in these lands.” As means to an end, they suggested that
it be made a point of conscience with each Preacher to bring into full operation
all the rules and usages of Methodism as far as practicable in all Circuits; for
in this respect they found great laxity. At the suggestion of Mr. Orton, they
also recommended that there be frequent interchanges to enable the Superin-
tendent to take a more thorough oversight of the work. The need of another
Preacher to work the extensive field for usefulness in and around Sydney was set
forth. Prominence was also given to the need of a strict observance of the
Sabbath and the advantages of open-air preaching. Such admonitions soon
made themselves felt, and an improvement was apparent. “ The Work of God,”
said the District Meeting of 1834, “presents the appearance of gradual improve-
ment, and the discipline of Methodism has been more general and efficiently
brought into operation We dwell together in perfect unity, being
of one heart and one mind.”
The District Meeting thought the following methods likely to advance the
interests of the Church; “ 1. That viewing the circumstances of the respective
Circuits in New South Wales, particularly the want of additional help, and their
adjacency to each other, it is desirable at least for the present that they be
worked as one Circuit ; judging that such an arrangement would tend to the
furtherance of the cause. But, though one Circuit , we recommend the Com-
mittee to allow them to appear in the Report as District Stations. 2. That in
consideration of the pressing claims of Sydney for an additional Preacher, and
the prospects presented for much greater usefulness, we are of opinion that a
second Preacher should be forthwith appointed to Sydney; and the Windsor
Stations be supplied once a fortnight on the Sabbath by the Sydney and Parra-
matta Brethren, until more help be afforded us. 3. A commodious Chapel in a
more eligible part of Sydney, is not only desirable, but indispensably necessary.
We believe our cause here has languished in a great measure from the discoura-

gmg circumstances and situation of the Chapel; and we are certain that all our
influential friends are quite prepared to come forward liberally to accomplish
arrangements for the erection of a new one.”
In his official letter, accompanying the Minutes, the Chairman writes: “ With
regard to the cause of religion amongst us in this district, I cannot state anything
of a very flattering character; but I think I can confidently state that though
our improvement is very gradual, it is manifestly certain ; therefore —especially
considering the depraved community in which we labour —we have occasion to
thank God, and take courage. My hopes are sanguine as to the advantage
likely to accrue from our Sunday Schools. In Sydney they have greatly
increased ; two years ago the number of children did not amount to thirty;
and now they are upwards of two hundred, conducted by an adequate number
of indefatigable Teachers, and under the direction of an efficient Committee.
It affords me much pleasure to observe that there are several
young men of very promising character, who have recently connected themselves
with us, who are already actively engaged in various departments of the Society,
and from whose continued, zealous services our little Church may confidently
hope to derive lasting advantage. In Sydney we are greatly in need of more
help in our public work ; more devolves upon me then I have competency to
accomplish. I hope ere this the Committee have favourably considered our
past representations and afforded us an additional Preacher for Sydney. It will
be remembered that the District decided to withdraw the Preacher from W mdsor,
and place him in Sydney until more help was afforded ; however, this we have
not yet acted upon. It became so painful a proceeding to forsake a place so
long occupied, that I thought it advisable to defer from period to period, hoping
for the arrival of a Missionary. Still anxiously looking for intelligence favour-
able to the interests of our cause in this Colony.” —(District Despatch Book ,
vol. i., p. 223.)
In September of the same year, he writes in more hopeful strain. “It
affords me very great pleasure to be able to inform you that as Brethren we
continue to dwell together in unity, and I believe mutual esteem. The spiritual
state of the District is gradually improving and wears a more encouraging aspect
than formerly. In Sydney, the Tord is evidently moving in the heaits of the
people. The congregations of late have very much increased. The members
of our Society appear to have much more stability and de\ otedness to the cause
of Christ, many of whom are earnestly panting after the fulness of the blessing
of the Gospel of Christ. I have of late discovered to my great satisfaction, that
the apparent indifference as to the prosperity of the Church, over which we have
had too much cause to lament, is giving place to an interest and concern for its
welfare.” —{District Despatch Book.)
This year witnessed the formation of one important Society and the
resuscitation of another. The first was the Strangers Friend Society, foimed in
the latter part of the year 1835 ■ “ the operation of which, to quote the Minutes,
“ promises to be of great service to the spiritual interests of our cause, as well


as the temporal relief of the sick and distressed.” In the formation of this
Society, Mr. Justice Burton rendered assistance. Mr. Orton sketched off "in a
very rough manner,” a few thoughts to serve as the ground of the prospectus
they were about to publish in the papers. These thoughts he submitted to Mr.
Justice Burton, who revised them and suggested the insertion of a clause of
which Mr. Orton said he quite approved. A meeting was held in Macquarie
Street at which the Rules were passed and ordered to be printed. This Society,
Mr. Orton regretfully reports at a later date, had been diverted from its original
purpose. The second Society was the Wesleyan Tract Society, which was
either an offshoot of the Australian Tract Society, or an attempt to make that
organization of more direct benefit to the Wesleyan Church. The members of
the District Meeting said: “We consider the distribution of religious Tracts to
be a very important auxiliary toward the promotion of the work of God; and
were our Tracts in general circulated in the Colonies, we doubt not they would
-considerably further the interests of our Societies. Accordingly, the Superin-
tendent of the Sydney Circuit has been directed to take immediate steps for the
formation of a Wesleyan Tract Society.” —(District Minutes, 1835.)
The District Minutes of 1836 contain expressions of gratitude to Almighty
God for His continued blessing. The membership had not largely increased
owing to removals and the cutting off of several " merely nominal members.”
“ We have, notwithstanding, the happy assurance of an increase of piety, unity,
and stability throughout the Societies. We likewise have reason to believe that
our excellent economy is better understood, cordially embraced, and more con-
scientiously observed than has been the case in times past; which may be viewed
as a pleasing feature, particularly as having a prospective reference to the pros-
perity of our cause in these increasingly important Colonies
Considering the mixed classes constituting this community—the prejudices
arising therefrom—and the consequent nature of the soil, which our Divine
Master has called us to cultivate, we have reason to thank God and take courage.”
Mr. Orton’s Journals supply interesting details of the work then in progress
in Sydney. Writing on Thursday, January 15th, 1835, he says: “This evening
the Love Feast was held in Princes-street Chapel. At the commencement,
the meeting was rather dull; about nine o’clock, there was an evident feeling
among the people, which gradually increased. I requested that those who were
really seeking the forgiveness for their sins, would simply express their feelings,
and many were led to do so. The expression of feeling so much increased, and
as it was getting late, I concluded the public service and requested as many
as thought proper to remain. The penitents were collected near to the pulpit,
and we recommenced our supplications. The Lord was pleased to answer prayer
The meeting continued until a little past midnight, during which time a most
powerful manifestation of the presence of God was felt. Six persons found the
pardoning mercy of God: principally young persons ; amongst whom it rejoices
my heart to record was my own beloved daughter I count this
blessed season the beginning of better days amongst us as a Society. My heart

President of General Conference , iS.90.


is excited more ardently than ever to cry ‘ Lord, revive Thy work.’ ” The next
day he writes that the District Meeting had been attended with much more
Brotherly affection among the Preachers, and many refreshing seasons from the
presence of the Master of Assemblies.
This period also marked a great advance in Sunday School work, and
witnessed the first attempts to deal with this important department of the Church
in a statesmanlike manner. On Whit Monday, 18th May, 1834, a public meeting
was held in Princes-street Chapel, with Mr. Orton in the chair, when a scheme
for the formation of “ The Wesleyan Methodist Sunday School .Society of
Sydney ” was adopted, thus superseding the almost defunct Sunday School
Union. The prime mover in this organisation was Mr. George Allen, who
drafted the rules, saw the Society safely launched, and acted as General Secre-
tary for some years. The Report submitted at that meeting read thus:
“ The Committee of the Wesleyan Methodist Sunday School Society, in
Sydney, in presenting the annual report of their proceedings, desire to express
their gratitude to the great Source of all good, by Whose watchful care and
kind Providence they have been spared to see another Anniversary of their
Institution. And they have reason to believe, that during the past year, they
have not laboured in vain, nor spent their strength for nought. During the
year your Committee have had many difficulties to contend with ; but so far
from being discouraged, they unanimously determined, by the assistance of Him
Who seeks and knows all things (and without Whose blessing all attempts to
promote His Glory would be fruitless), to persevere with increased ardour in the
path of duty, relying on Him for assistance and direction, Who, on a most
interesting occasion said: ‘ Suffer little Children to come unto Me and forbid them
not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven.’
“Your Committee feel peculiar pleasure in being able to inform the friends
of this Institution, that the Schools under their immediate care, are, by the
blessing of the Almighty God, in a more prosperous and encouraging state
than they have been for some years past; both as regards the increase in
numbers, and the good effects which, there is reason to believe, have followed
the instructions imparted to those intrusted to their care. During the past year,
nearly 200 children have been admitted into the Schools ; the present number
on the books in both Schools is now 202 (in Macquarie-street School, 94;
and in Princes-street, 108); ol whom 122 are regular attendants, receiving the
best of instruction ; concerning many of whom there is good reason to hope
they have not learnt in vain ; but that the truths of the Gospel are taking root
in their hearts; and your Committee think it not presumptuous to believe, that
many of the children placed under their care are preparing for usefulness in the
world ; and thev doubt not when their heads shall be laid in the silent tomb,
many of these shall rise to fill their places and become the representatives of
this blessed Cause to promote the welfare of which we are now met.


“ Your Committee have also to congratulate you on the increase of Teachers
in the Schools, all of whom appear to be zealously affected in a good cause ; and
many whose hearts are imbued with heavenly love, are well adapted to com-
municate to the children (in the'spiritual sense of the word) the important truths
of the Gospel, with such agents as these who take Christ for their Captain and
Guide. Your Committee look forward with pleasing anticipation, and already
perceive the desert rejoicing and blossoming as the rose. Your Committee,
however, while they are thankful for the many efficient Teachers, who are already
employed from Sabbath to Sabbath instructing the rising generation, would
earnestly and affectionately solicit the aid and co-operation, especially of those
young persons whose situation in life and disposition of mind, render them well
adapted to further the glorious ends of this Institution.
“Your Committee beg to state that by the Treasurer’s account, it appears
there is a balance in favour of the Institution ; that £7 6s. gd. has been received
and £7 1 os. lid. has been expended during the year; and while they are
desirous of expressing their gratitude to those friends who have so liberally
contributed to the support of this Institution ; and, although there is at present
a small balance in the hands of the Treasurer, the expenses of the present
Anniversary will more than counterbalance it. It is therefore humbly hoped
that the ensuing year will prove Sunday Schools are rising in importance in the
estimation of what has ever been considered a kind and benevolent Public.
“ Your Committee in closing this brief report of their proceedings for the
past year, feel that they cannot do better than implore the Divine aid and
assistance, in order that the great objects of the Institution may be carried into
effect. And in uniting their earnest supplications to the God and bather of all
•our mercies, that He would hasten the happy period when Sunday Schools shall
have spread their hallowing influence over all lands, and when the kingdoms of
this world shall become the kingdoms of our God and of His Christ.”
An elaborate and formidable list of “General Rules” for the management
of the Society was adopted on the i/th of the following month. The aim of
the Society was to afford gratuitous instruction to the children and adults. The
Society was to consist of subscribers to the amount of 10s. 6d. annually, Teachers
over the age of 18 years, with the resident Missionary as President. The Schools
were to be under the government of the General Committee, which had power
to suspend or expel any member for immorality of conduct or breach of its
rules. Annual sermons were to be preached and collections made on Whit
Sunday, and on the following day the children were to be publicly examined
and rewarded, according to merit. The duties of the various officials were clearly
set out. The Committee was to meet the first Thursday in each quarter, to
appoint a Superintendent and Secretary for each School, to control all expendi-
ture, to appoint Visitors and Teachers, and to “ make a strict enquiry into the
moral character and attention to the duties of the School of all the Teachers
and Officers.” The work also of the General Secretary, Superintendent, School
Secretaries, Teachers and Visitors was defined ; and the I eachers were explicitly


informed that they must attend punctually at g o’clock in the morning and from
2 to 4 o’clock in the afternoon, that while in School they must observe a serious
attentive deportment, avoiding talkativeness, and that during singing and prayer
they must stand at the head of their respective classes to keep them in order.
Corporal punishment was not to be allowed, correction being meted out by the
forfeiture of reward tickets. These rules were not always observed ; but the
delinquents appear to have been promptly taken to task, some Teachers being
struck off the roll for irregular attendance, and others reprimanded for striking
the scholars. At the examination at one public meeting, Mr. Orton says the
children “ acquitted themselves much to their own credit and to the great satis-
faction of their Teachers and the friends in general. Ihe public meeting was
marked by several able and interesting addresses in ravour of Sunday School
operations before a crowded assembly.”
There were two Schools only—Princes-street and Macquarie-street when
the Society came into existence ; but in the course of a few years others w ere
founded, and the organization was extended with most beneficial results. In
January, 1837, the Society resolved to open a Sunday School at Surry Hills, in
a room “ kindly offered ” by Mr. Lancelot Iredale, and Mr. Robert Bourne was
appointed Superintendent. His first report shows an attendance of 2 Teachers
and 18 Scholars. The same year the Secretary of the Bathurst School icquested
permission for his School to enter the Union ; and Mr. McKenny, then Chairman,
reported that he had succeeded in raising a sum of money for the erection of a
“commodious School-house,” on the ground attached to Macquarie-street
Chapel. To this sum the Legislative Council had voted £ls°, available when
called for. At the close of the year, the Union Committee resolved to build
the schoolroom, its dimensions to be 40 feet by 24 feet, and 14 feet high from
the floor to the lowest part of the ceiling.” The building, running parallel with
Macquarie-street, was to cost £4OO, and its erection was to be superintended
by the Rev. J. McKenny and Messrs. Piper and Peacock, who were to “ act
under the direction of Mr. Verge.” Mr. McKenny and Messrs. Piper and Bow-
den were “ to fit up the schoolroom ” at a cost not exceeding T. he newly
opened School in Druitt-street was next affiliated to the Union, joining in
February, 1838, with Mr. Kirwood as Superintendent. At the end of the year
it reported 5 Teachers and 104 Scholars, and in the early part of 1843, the Sec-
retary recorded its demise. In May, 1839, Surry Hills School had grown to 6
Teachers and 40 Scholars, and Mr. Allen had been succeeded by Mr. Thomas
Bowden in the office of Secretary. Liverpool-street School first appears as part
of the Union in 1841, with 12 Teachers and 128 Scholars. This School after-
wards passed into Hay-street. The total for all the Schools in that year was
35 Teachers and 361 Scholars. The year 1844 tells of the removal from Mac-
quarie-street to York-street, with most encouraging results, of a new School at
Chippendale, with 75 Scholars, and Mr. Roseby, Superintendent, and Mr. Scott
Secretary, of another School at O’Connell Crescent, “ about two miles from
Sydney ” —“ a place of great importance—the population rapidly increasing,”'
with 84 Scholars under the charge of Mr. H. Saxby. Two years later brought.


three additional Schools: Pyrmont, Balmain and Waverley. At Pyrmont, Mr.
Bennett was Superintendent and Mr. Brown Secretary ; at Balmain, Mr. Gol-
ledge took charge, while Waverley was under the superintendence of Mr.
Vickery. Toxteth Park, Lane Cove, South Head and Canterbury, first appear
in 1847, while Newtown joined the following year. South Head had a brief
existence. It started well, but being unable to find a suitable place of assembly,
soon lapsed. Sussex-street School was closed when the Chapel in which it
met was disposed of ; and the Union itself may be said practically to have ceased
on the division of the one Circuit in Sydney into two, viz.: North and South
Sydney. That the Society did great work was apparent. It gave prominence
to Sabbath School work, it jealously guarded the character of its agents, it did
much to spread Scriptural knowledge, in addition to teaching many to read,
and it trained as useful workers in the Church, men and women whose names
have become household words, and who have filled, or are even now filling
important public positions in the State.
The Hobart Town Society now thought that the time had arrived for the
division of the District, and with that end in view, it communicated with the
Committee, praying that Van Dieman’s Land should be made a separate Dis-
trict. When asked its opinion upon this proposal, this Meeting said: “We judge
that such an arrangement is inexpedient and unnecessary. 1. Considering the
smallness of the present number constituting our District, a division would
materially weaken the tone of Methodistical economy bearing upon us as
Methodist Preachers, the salutary operation of which is obvious, particularly with
regard to those obligations towards each other and the Body of which we con-
stitute a part. 2. We cannot see what advantages would be derived by the
Society of Hobart Town from such a division. 3. Estimating the zeal and
great liberality of our kind friends of Hobart Town, we are fully of opinion that
the financial produce of their assiduity and benevolence should be exclusively
applied to the spiritual interests of that part of the District. And we doubt
not but the Committee will, in this respect, meet their fullest wishes by sending
them more help. The proposition we hope will meet the approbation of the
Society in Hobart Town, to whom we can but give full credit for the purity of
their motive, their sincere attachment to the economy of Methodism, and their
loving zeal for the cause of the Redeemer.” — (District Minutes, vol. hi., p. 341.)
Notwithstanding this adverse judgment, the Committee authorised the
separation in 1835, and appointed Mr. Orton as Chairman of the newly-formed
District, the Hobart Town Society having pressed for his appointment as
Superintendent. He still retained the office of General Superintendent of Mis-
sions. To the acceptance of this twofold honour, he was not averse, though he
found occasion to complain of the manner in which effect had been given to the
request. His accounts had been unfairly criticised, he contended. “Never has
my mind,” he says in a letter to the Committee, “ been so severely wounded
before. I feel that I have occasion to complain, and do sincerely hope and
respectfully request that I may not again be subjected to such undesei \ed
obloquy.”

On reviewing his work as Chairman, previous to his departure for Tasmania,
he writes: “ On Sunday, the 24th ultimo (February, 1836), I bid adieu to Sydney,
which has been the principal sphere of my operation for the last four years ;
m the course of which period many have been the trials through which I have
passed ; and on occasions have endured racking anxiety on behalf of the Church.
When I arrived, I was aware that I was entering a scene, the performance of
which would be extremely difficult. I accordingly commenced my labours with
fear and trembling, and yet in humble dependence upon the sufficiency of Divine
grace.”—(_ Journal .) Referring directly to his work in Sydney, he writes:
“ After labouring there four years, I had the gratification to see the Society
trebled, and with great reluctance left a most loving people.” And, in 1839,
when resigning the office of General Superintendent, with the view of returning
to England, and in which office he was succeeded by Mr. Waterhouse, he places
this record in his Journal; “ The District had then (in 1832) 5 Preachers. There
are now 1 in two Districts, which was then one District. The members are at
least four times the amount, and though the Society of Hobart Town has been
disturbed and injured by designing, high-minded, litigous persons, at present
all is peace, with the prospect of harmonious and successful operation. I have
had the happiness to labour with my dear Brethren in the Districts with much
harmony and affection ; and feel myself greatly indebted to them for their united
and zealous co-operation in aiding me to carry out my plans for the promotion
of the cause of God in their respective spheres. In giving up my charge, the
breaking up of the connection, which had so long and happily subsisted among
us, was one of the severest trials which I have been called to endure. That
which affords me the greatest comfort next to the approbation of my Divine
Master is the confidence of the Wesleyan Missionary Committee, whose agent
I have had the happiness to be during a period of nearly 14 years. Their
repeated expressions of decided approbation have been highly gratifying, and
have often afforded me encouragement when my hands have dropped, and my
heart has been ready to faint.” — {Journals, vol. i., p. 222.)
Mr. Orton did go “ home ” ; but it was to his “ long home ” ; that, however,
Bid not transpire until he had rendered more valuable service still to the Com-
mittee and to the Church, in whose service he wore himself out. Before his
■departure from Australia, the infant Society at Fort Phillip resolved to give
expression in some practical form to the esteem in which he was held. Arrange-
ments were therefore made for a valedictory meeting, at which an address and a
valuable gold watch were given him. And with many expressions of esteem and
affectionate farewell, his friends watched him set sail for England. Though
they knew it not, he was setting out on his last journey. On the 2nd of March,
1842, with his wife and ten children, he boarded The James, in charge of Captain
Todd. Wearisome nights and a distressing cough reduced him to an “ extremely
debilitated state,” and his strength slowly ebbed away. The last entry in his
Journal bears date April 4th' *842. When rounding Cape Horn, he passed
within the veil; and his body, like that of his great predecessor, Dr. Coke, was
lowered into the depths of the sea. His last words were; “All is well. All


is well.” He was 46 years and 6 months old, having been born at Hull on the
Ist October, 1795. No monument marks his resting place, and he needs none,
for his most worthy monument is found in his enduring work. The first
Wesleyan Missionary to cross the Blue Mountains and organise Methodism on
the Bathurst Plains ; the first Missionary probably to visit West Maitland, there
to encourage and counsel Jeremiah Ledsam and the Society he had gathered
around him ; the first Wesleyan Missionary to visit Port Phillip, and there, on
Batman’s Hill, in the presence of a few settlers and their servants, several
Aborigines and the notorious Buckley, to preach the Gospel; the first to travel
to the spot afterwards, chosen as the site of the Buntingdale Mission, what other
distinction does he need ? And yet he has other honours. He was imprisoned
for Christ’s sake, he endured hardship for the Aborigines’ sake, he suffered
adverse criticism and misrepresentation for the Committee’s sake, and he severed
himself from his home and family, taking long, tedious voyages to New Zealand
and other places for the work’s sake. In his Journal he frequently wrote —
“What troubles have we seen,
What conflicts have we past,
Fighting without, and fears within
Since we assembled last.”
He can now sing—
“ But out of all the Lord
Hath brought us by His love;
And still He doth His help afford,
And hides our life above.”
When the news of his death reached Port Phillip, a. Memorial Service
conducted by Mr. Dredge, was held in the Chapel at Geelong on the 18th Decem-
ber, 1842. In his address, Mr. Dredge said: “ The period of Mr. Orton’s appoint-
ments in this distant portion of the Mission Field was one of unprecedented
importance. And there can be little question that to his judicious, prompt and
indefatigable labours, and those of his coadjutors under his direction is to be
attributed much of the stability which the cause has assumed, as well as the
wide-spreading prosperity which still crowns these Missions. Lofty in the
object after which he aspired, and single-minded in the motives by which he
was actuated, he was in labours more abundant; and amidst evil report and
good report, he nobly disclaimed to falter if by any means he might be instru-
mental in maintaining unsullied the character of Methodism and saving souls
from death.”

CHAPTER IX.
COUNTRY METHODISM.
WHAT is now the important town of Bathurst first received considera-
tion from the District Meeting in 1832. In the latter part of
that year Joseph Orton wrote to the Committee: “For several
months I have been repeatedly solicited to visit the district
of Bathurst, about 120 miles from Sydney. My many pressing duties
in Sydney have hitherto prevented my compliance, but I have now made
arrangements to visit them in a few weeks. We have several friends
residing in that district who are very desirous that a Missionary be stationed
amongst them, and who have promised very liberally towards his support. I
believe there is an opening for extensive usefulness. The result of my visit
will enable me to give more decided information, and I hope to possess myself
of interesting facts as to the state of prospects regarding the wretched Abori-
gines of the neighbourhood over whose miserable condition my bowels yearn
with the deepest concern. I judge we are verily guilty concerning this por-
tion of the brotherhood. Providence has brought us to them, and we are liter-
ally driving them from us. Something must be done for them! The incidents
of my visit shall be duly transmitted; and I have no doubt they will be such as
will induce you to afford us additional help in this increasingly important Colony;
and especially for the miserably degraded heathen population.” —(District
Despatch Book , p. 170.) In his official report after his return he says: “I am
of opinion that a Missionary might be employed to great advantage in that part
of the country. We have already a Society there, organised by myself during
my visit, consisting of persons who were members of our Society in England, and
who have been in the habit of meeting together as regularly as circumstances
would allow; and have done credit to their Christian profession, though desti-
tute of the public means of grace or pastoral attention. They have pledged
themselves to do all they can towards the support of a Missionary, if one be
sent. At all events, they intend to erect a Chapel, and one gentleman has pro-
mised ASO towards its erection: and I am persuaded that others will come for-
ward liberally. However, whether we station a Missionary there or not they
must have some attention as well as that part of the country in general. I
therefore purpose that they shall for the present have a quarterly visit from one
of us, the expense of which visits, calculating that we take the Circuit horse,
will be a little more than J2O a year. This amount, I have no doubt, will be
met by subscriptions from our friends there.” —(Despatch Book , p. 178.)
On the morning of Monday, October 29th, 1832, Mr. Orton commenced his
“ long contemplated tour to the interior of the country,” which had for its main


object a visit to Bathurst. He set out in company with Mr. S. Terry. Calling'
at Mr. Schofield’s, at Parramatta, they passed on to Prospect Hills, where the
“ undulated and conical face of the country presents a beautiful aspect.” Four
o’clock brought them to Mr. Terry’s estate at Mount Pleasant, which was the
“ most Anglocised in appearance ”of any he had yet seen. In the evening the
persons on the farm were called together “ in number to upwards of twenty,”
and a service, which gave great satisfaction, was held. The next day the little
Chapel built by John Lees at Castlereagh was visited. It was “in the most
dilapidated state. The parish school is taught in the Chapel, which consisted
of about a dozen children under the care of a Master, with as little order as I
have ever seen.” Service was announced for 5.30 that evening, and the inter-
vening time was spent in visiting John Lees, a “man sorely afflicted” and “in
a state of bodily agony and spiritual depression.” But few persons attended
the service ; and on his return to Mount Pleasant he preached again at 8
o’clock.
At daybreak the next day their faces were turned towards the Blue Moun-
tains. Crossing Penrith Ferry and ascending Lapstone Hill, they breakfasted
at a small tavern “ in the midst of sterile rocks, far from any other human habi-
tation ” ; and at six o’clock reached Collett’s Inn, where they had dinner, tea,
and supper in one meal. Divine service with “ the family and domestics ” over,
they were eager for rest, having travelled fifty-six miles. The next evening
found them, after journeying 30 miles over “ most uneven country and bad
roads,” at Rainville, the residence of Captain Raine, formerly a sailor, by whom
they were “ heartily welcomed.” During the day they fell in with a party of
Aborigines, with whom Mr. Orton entered into conversation. In guessing the
age of the white persons present they persisted that Mr. Orton must be sixty-
two, and that he lived “ long, long, very long time.” 1 Before he could set out
the next day he was visited by Mr. Lane, “ a member of our Society,” who had
been apprised of his visit. To induce Mr. Orton to return with him to “Tara-
nah,” named after an adjacent mountain, Mr. Lane promised to accompany him
to Bathurst the next day. A pleasant day was spent, followed by a service in
the evening ; and next day, in company with Mr. Lane, the journey was re-
sumed. At O’Connell Plains “we rested and took refreshments at the house
of Mr. Smith, who, with his wife, are members of our Society.” That evening
they reached Bathurst, and Mr. Orton was introduced to the Anglican Clergy
man, the Rev. Mr. Keane, a broad-minded, though eccentric man.
Mr. Orton’s description of the country around Bathurst is worth repro-
ducing : “ The plains of Bathurst extend several miles in length and breadth,
with scarcely the appearance of a shrub. The surface of the plains is pleas-
ingly undulated, and covered with verdure, affording excellent pasturage for
sheep ; flocks of which are to be observed in every direction under charge of the
shepherds of their respective proprietors. The country round the plains is ex-
ceedingly fine, well-wooded (though not encumbered), and intersected by
numerous refreshing rills of water in meandering directions, generally tending
to the Macquarie River. A great proportion of the soil is exceedingly good,
1 Mr. Orton was then 34. He attributes this error to his “ sage appearance,” and
his “ spectacles.”


and fit for any agricultural purposes, requiring but little artificial aid. The
atmosphere is very clear, and the climate is mild and salubrious, though occa-
sionally subject to keen frosts, heavy falls of snow, and severe thunderstorms.
The hailstones, or rudely shaped lumps of congealed fluid, which fell, were
unusually large, many measuring from four to six inches and upwards in cir-
cumference, by the pelting of which, I understand, there were some instances of
stock being killed ; but such storms are of exceedingly rare occurrence. Upon
the whole this part of the country is conducive to bodily health and pecuniary
profit. Its inviting character has allured a considerable population of settlers
of various grades ; the industrious of whom are reaping the ample reward of
their persevering toil.”
The next morning, Sunday, Nov. 4th, he attended the Church of England
service, and heard Mr. Keane preach “ a very impressive and good sermon,” in
a temporary Church formerly a barn, but now fitted up to do duty until the
contemplated building was erected. “In the afternoon,” says Mr. Orton, “ I
preached to the men on Mr. Terry’s farm ; afterwards rode back to the settle-
ment, and spent a pleasant evening with Mr. Keane in company with Mr. and
Mrs. Raine.” Monday was spent with Captain Raine and Mr. Lane in riding
through Queen Charlotte’s Vale to the Government settlement. At the Vale,
Mr. Lane had purchased 120 acres of land, on which he intended to build a house,
to be called “ Orton Park,” and also to erect a Chapel.
Springfield, 27 miles west of Bathurst, and on the road to Wellington Val-
ley, the residence of Mr. Tom, “a member of our Society,” was the next place
of visit. Arriving at five o’clock, they were heartily welcomed, and Mr. Orton
preached to a small congregation “ with considerable liberty and good to my
own soul.” An “ individual ” was so much affected during the sermon that he
called the next day and seriously inquired if someone had not informed the
preacher of the “ particulars of his wicked life, imagining that the preacher
otherwise could not have referred so pointedly to his actions, and described so
clearly his feelings.” That same day two of Mr. Tom’s children were publicly
baptised. On his return journey to Bathurst Mr. Orton took breakfast with
Mr. Glasson and Mr. Hawke, and observed what was to him the mysterious
process of making damper. As there were no “ inns ”on the way his bachelor
friends provided him with a slice of damper and some corned beef. When
travelling he was led to reflect upon any advantages which may have
arisen from his visit to Springfield. He thought that he could discover some
good. He had embraced the opportunity of hearing the word of God ; he had
reconciled two persons, who, from some trifling dispute, were under the tempta-
tion of coolness and distance, likely to engender decided enmity ; and he had
organised a Class of five members, which he hoped would be the foundation of
a numerous Society.
Lriday and Saturday were spent in Bathurst, when he rode round the
settlement, and called upon “the Rev. Mr. Thompson of the Scotch Kirk, with
whom I spent an hour in pleasant conversation. He is an intelligent young
man,” though stiff in the formalities of the Scotch Church. This pleasant con-
versation turned upon the advantages of composing and reading sermons. Mr.
Thompson held “ most tenaciously ” to the reading of sermons; while Mr.

Orton argued in favour of extemporaneous preaching. On the following Sab-
bath (Nov. nth, 1832) Mr. Orton, according to appointment, preached in
Bathurst both morning and afternoon, in the barn of “ Mr. William Lane, for-
merly of the Nepean.” “On both occasions the congregations were small, but
1 felt considerable liberty in preaching to them. I pray God that His blessing
may accompany the Word spoken. In travelling across the plains to the place
appointed for the holding of service, I had a narrow escape from a very serious
accident. Whilst carefully endeavouring to avoid a bog, of which there are
great numbers on Bathurst plains, my horse suddenly plunged into one with his
fore-feet, and instantaneously sank to his shoulders, and fell on his side in the
bog with me partly under him. With some difficulty I extricated myself from
my unpleasant and dangerous situation, and escaped without further injury
than that of spoiling my clothes. In the evening I preached to the men on
Mr. Terry’s farm.” Tuesday was spent in company with Mr. Keane in visiting
his farm, eight miles from Bathurst, where Mr. Orton addressed the men.
On his return journey to Sydney he again called at Mr. Smith’s, at O’Con-
nell s Plains, where he conducted service; and next day rode over to see the
Rev. William Walker, late Missionary to the Aborigines, who had settled there
on land presented by the Governor. With Mr. Walker he had a long
conversation. He is most certainly a clever man,” but “he has been injudi-
ciously managed by those who were placed over him” Of the people gener-


ally throughout the District Mr. Orton said, “ I have found my heart engaged
for the welfare of the people. Surely the Lord will bless these means which
my visit afforded a people, who but seldom hear the Gospel preached. If but
one soul be saved by these occasional visits and services, my labour as
an instrument in the hands of the Lord will be amply repaid.” On
this return journey, Mr. Orton says he preached to three chain-
gangs; travelled with Captain Brown, who desired to have his company;
called at the “weatherboard hut,” and walked over to see the “water-
fall in the neighbourhood of the Inn. “ Our guide informed us that he was
one of six prisoners for life, who were offered by the Governor a free pardon if
they should effect a descent; but after every effort for three weeks, trying every
part of the ravine, they were obliged to abandon the project.” The following
\\ ednesday evening he reached home after an absence of three weeks, having
called again at Mount Pleasant.
His second visit to Bathurst, when he again had Mr. Terry as his com-
panion, commenced on Friday, November ist, 1833. He visited the settlers
in the neighbourhood of our little Chapel at the Nepean River,” and took tea
with Mr. Stockfish. Mr. Stockfish expressed himself in strong terms of appro-
val of the Wesleyan Mission, and in confidence stated that as he had no rela-
tives he intended to make his property over to the Missionary Society. To
avoid the Statute of Mortmain, Mr. Orton says he proposed to furnish Mr.
Stockfish with a proper form of bequest. That evening was spent at Mount
Pleasant, when Mr. Fulton, one of the Chaplains, “ greatly amused and in-
structed ” them in reading the MS. of a pamphlet against Popery which he was
about to publish. On Sunday he preached to two chain-gangs in the vicinity of
Collett’s Inn. Monday brought him to Mr. Smith’s, where he preached to a
“tolerable congregation.” Tuesday he breakfasted with Mr. Walker, dined
with Mr. Lane at “ Orton Park,” and preached at a neighbouring house in the
evening. Wednesday he was again with Mr. Keane, and at night preached at
Mr. Lane’s house. Sunday, Nov. 10th, he conducted service at Mr. Lane’s,
preaching from the “ Sacrifices of Religion.” In the afternoon he preached in
the Township to a very small congregation, the weather being unfavourable,
and Mr. Keane not having fulfilled his voluntary promise to announce the ser-
vice. In the evening he preached in Mr. Smith’s house at O’Connell Plains to
a considerable congregation, and met the Society for tickets. On the following
Tuesday he was home again.
The third visit to Bathurst was undertaken on Thursday, October 16th,
1834. A call on Mr. Simpson at Parramatta, several services among the chain-
gangs, the temporary loss of his watch, and an occasional bog in the bad roads
are the chief items of interest on the up journey. Arriving late at O’Connell
Plains (Sunday, 19th October) he proceeded direct to the Chapel, preached from
the words; “ There is a sin unto death,” and baptised two children. This
Chapel had been built by, and at the expense of, the Rev. T. Hassall, of the
Anglican Church, who owned a farm in the neighbourhood. It was capable of
seating 150 people, and was appropriated to the use of both Wesleyans and
Anglicans. On Monday, with the snow thick on the ground, he visited Mr.
Walker, where he examined a half-caste girl—a candidate for baptism. When


on the way to Bathurst next day he was met by Mr. Lane, who piloted him
through the Macquarie River, then so high that six inches of water was in the
body of the gig. He preached the next evening, and had a spiritual and pro-
fitable conversation with Mr. George Hawke, who was pronounced a “ good man
with a “kindred spirit.” Friday was spent in inspecting “a spot of land pro-
mised by Mr. Lane to the Society, on which to erect a Mission House, Chapel,
etc. It is an eligible piece of land.”
Mr. Orton shall now complete the story in his own words:—
Saturday, 25th. —Rode over to Mr. West’s at Macquarie Plains and
arranged to preach there on Friday next. Read a portion of Scripture and
prayed with the family. Proceeded from Macquarie Plains to the settlement
of Bathurst; visited the Rev. Mr. Keane, and returned to Mr. Lane s. In the
evening visited and performed service at Mr. Johnson’s residence in Queens
Vale. An intelligent Scotchman, of strict moral habits, and I have reason to
believe under the influence of religious principle.
Sunday, 26th. —I preached at Mr. Lane’s house to a crowded and atten-
tive assembly, amongst whom was a neighbouring Magistrate and his family
and several other respectable persons. Selected for my text the Young Rulers
question to our Lord: “What shall I do to inherit eternal life?” After the
public service I baptised Mr. Lane’s child. In the afternoon rode over to a
place called the “ White Rock,” and preached to a tolerable congregation from
“ Godliness is profitable to all things.” Mr. Street and Mr. Lawson were pre-
sent and several of the neighbouring farmers. In the evening walked over to
the residence of Captain Raine in Queen’s Vale. Arranged for preaching in
his house on Sunday afternoon next.
Monday, 27th. —Visited the Rev. Mr. Keane in company with Mr. Glasson.
Examined the Church which is in course of erection. In my judgment it is a
very badly constructed place; the external appearance is heavy and unscientific
and internally incommodious. In company with Mr. Lane proceeded on a
visit to Mr. Tom’s of Springfield. In the evening baptised two of Mr. Tom’s
children—twins; one named Ellen Wesley and the other Emma Fletcher.
Afterwards preached to a number of persons collected together from: “I am
Thine, save me.” After service I accompanied Mr. Glasson to his bark tene-
ment about half a mile from Mr. Tom’s. In one corner of his hut a bed was
made up for me, on which I rested during the night as comfortably as could be
expected.
Tuesday, 28th. —Returned from Springfield to Mr. Lane’s. On our way
called at the settlement where Mr. Hawke is overseer, belonging to Colonel
Wall. We obtained refreshment and proceeded to Queen’s Vale through the
bush. A most picturesque and pleasant ride.
Thursday, 30th. —Rode over to Mr. Terry’s farm, spent a short time with
Mr. Turner the Overseer, and returned to Mr. Lane’s. In the evening held a
prayer meeting, when the Lord was pleased graciously and powerfully to mani-
fest His presence. It was truly refreshing to our souls. After the prayer
meeting a consultation was held regarding the stationing of a Minister at
Bathurst, and the erection of a Chapel, Mission House, etc. The principal
friends present were Messrs. Lane, Tom, Hawke, and Glasson. They were quite

hearty in the cause, and expressed their determination to exert themselves to
the utmost to accomplish the object. They liberally pledged themselves to
meet the ordinary expenses of a single Missionary if one should be sent. It was
agreed that Mr. Lane’s kind offer of an acre of land should be accepted, and
that as soon as convenient the draft of a Chapel about 30 feet by 40 be prepared
and submitted for approval.
Friday, 31st. —Took a round of about twenty miles, visiting several of the
friends in the neighbourhood. Returned by way of Macquarie Plains and
preached according to appointment at Mr. West’s from Romans viii., 6v. The
rain has fallen in torrents the greater part of the day. I have, however, for-
tunately escaped by travelling between the showers ; so heavy was the rain
that in many parts the plains were an extensive sheet of water. There was
also a most severe hailstorm ; the stones falling, in many instances, being larger
than a pigeon’s egg; several lambs were killed by them. Such a storm has not
been witnessed before by the oldest settlers.
Saturday, Nov. Ist. —Walked into the settlement of Bathurst, preached at
the hospital, and walked back again, a distance of seven miles.
Sunday, 2nd.—ln the evening preached at the settlement of Bathurst to a
rather thin congregation, from Ephesians v., 14. In the afternoon preached
at the house of Captain Raine ; the large drawing room was filled with persons,
who all seemed attentive, and I trust the Spirit of the Lord conveyed His own
Word with power to some hearts. Spent a profitable evening with Mr.


Johnson in conversation and prayer. After returning to Mr. Lane’s I gave
Society 1 ickets to those who are considered members.
On his return to Sydney Mr. Orton sent the following official report to
the General Committee, writing under date November igth, 1834.
“ I have just returned from a pastoral visit to our little Society at the in-
teresting and promising settlement of Bathurst, situated about one hundred and
thirty miles interior from Sydney, over a very broken and extensive range of
hills called ‘ The Blue Mountains.’ After overcoming the difficulties of tra-
versing the ridges, valleys, and swamps of this tedious part of the road (being
a distance of about seventy miles) the traveller is amply gratified by the ap-
pearance of a beautiful open country; the contrast of which, with the wild and
limited scenery of sterile rocks, horrifying ravines, and dense thickets, is most
delightful. My journey afforded me an opportunity of preaching the Gospel to
many who very rarely are favoured with hearing the Word of God. It is my
practice on these journeys to officiate at the end of every daily stage, whether
at an inn or at a private establishment; and on all such occasions every facility
is afforded for assembling the people, who willingly come, and thankfully
receive the message of mercy.
“ My attention is particularly directed to the road parties and iron-gangs,
which consist of men convicted of offences committed in this country, who are
sentenced to penal labour, and are employed in making and keeping in repair
the interior roads. They are interspersed over the country in parties of from
fifty to three hundred in number. They are generally a most depraved set of
men ; but they are sinners for whom Christ died, and should, by His Ministers,
be called to repentance at every opportunity. If an important collateral object
of penal conviction be reformation, these poor creatures, over whom one’s
bowels of compassion cannot but yearn, are most piteously neglected ; being
destitute of any means likely to accomplish so desirable an object. Whenever
I have officiated amongst them, they have appeared to give profound attention,
and, in many instances, have been suffused in tears while listening to the offers
of Divine Mercy to the vilest of sinners ; showing thereby that they are not
all irrecoverably lost to feeling, and affording a hope that the bread thus cast
upon the waters will be found ‘ after many days.’
“ It gives me pleasure to be able to state that the members of our little
flock at Bathurst continue to hold on their way, though they have to endure great
privation, and are exposed to great temptations and danger in the want of the
ordinary means of grace, and of pastoral attention, for which they are very
anxious, so much so, that they have renewed their former pledges with increased
and praiseworthy liberality, with a view of establishing a regular station and
supporting a Missionary, in that part of the country. A few friends have com-
bined their means, and pledged themselves to raise a sufficiency to meet the
ordinary expenses of a single Preacher, with promises to extend their liberality
as circumstances may enable them. They have in contemplation the erection
of a Chapel without delay. One gentleman, Mr. William Lane, has given to
the Society an acre of land, in a very eligible situation, and a subscription of
fifty pounds. Other friends who have come forward in a manner proportioned

to their circumstances ; and the present list of subscriptions will enable them to
proceed without embarrassment.
During my visit a meeting of the principal friends was convened, at
which, amongst other decisions regarding the establishment of a Station at
Bathurst, it was unanimously resolved, ‘ That, on the ground of their being
willing, and pledging themselves, to meet the ordinary expenditure of a single
Preacher, the Committee of the Wesleyan Missionary Society, through the
medium of the Chairman of the New South Wales District, be respectfully and
earnestly solicited to supply them with a Missionary with as little delay as pos-
sible.’ I therefore now officially forward the above resolution with my most cor-
dial approbation and pressing support, not only on account of their great
liberality in a pecuniary point of view, but because there is an encouraging
opening which ought to be entered without delay. An extensive population is
scattered about the neighbourhood, which would afford to an active Missionary
ample scope for labour and usefulness amongst our countrymen, who, in most
cases, are without the means of grace, but are anxious to possess, and willing to
the utmost of their power to support, a preached Gospel, and pastoral superinten-
dence. lam hopefully waiting the intelligence that the Committee have granted
our oft-repeated solicitations for a second Missionary for Sydney, and again beg
that the request of the Bathurst friends may be complied with by sending a
Missionary without delay. In Sydney we continue to do so as well as our means
will allow, though much cramped for want of help.” —(Methodist Magazine ,
J835.)


The Committee acceded to the request for a Missionary, and appointed
the Rev. F. Lewis, who arrived in Sydney in company with Mr. McKenny and
Mr. Draper. Mr. Lewis was a Welshman, full of fire and love, who knew well
how to bring sinners to Christ. During his nineteen years residence in Australia
he was remarkable for his zeal, abundant labours, and great success. Reaching
Bathurst on the 21st May, 1836, he wrote as follows on July 2nd of the same
year: —“The population connected with this Station is very much scattered, so
that I have a great deal of travelling. Last Sabbath week I rode twenty-six
miles, through a dreary bush between services, and on last Sabbath, forty miles
to three appointments. This will prevent me from visiting some of the places
as often as I should wish ; but I am determined, by God s help, to go to them
as frequently as possible, and to preach as often as I can. The people here had
been waiting my arrival with anxiety, and I met with a warm-hearted and
friendly reception, not only from what we term our own people, but from
others. Such is the friendly feeling of the Clergyman, that he is disposed to
render me all the assistance in his power. As we have at present no Chapel, he
has kindly offered his old Church. I hope this good feeling will continue ; and
shall do all I can to promote it. Our congregations have been large and re-
spectable. The people seem to listen with greai attention. Some have begun
to enquire, ‘ What must we do to be saved ?’ And some have entered into the
rest and liberty of the Gospel. The Word of God is evidently sweet to their
taste. Land for the Chapel is already given. We have moneys promised to
the amount of about T2OO, part of which is received. Some preparations are
made, and we hope in a few months to complete the building. Its dimensions
will be forty feet by thirty. We have this day held the first Quarterly Meet-
ing ever held on this side of the mountains. Our pecuniary circumstances are
quite as good as our friends had anticipated; and a sense of God’s gracious pre-
sence seemed to pervade every mind. We closed the day with Divine service.
(Methodist Magazine , 1837.)
The new Chapel was opened on the 10th October by the Rev. John
McKenny, the total cost being ABOO, towards which £4OO had been raised by
private subscriptions and collections ; and the Chairman had received a com-
munication from the Government promising the same amount on the reassem-
bling of the Legislative Council. The Government was also to issue the deed
of grant. The following year Mr. Lewis reported to the District Meeting that
some of their members who had been unfaithful were admonished and ex-
pelled ; though the congregations in the town were increasing. “On the last
night of the old year,” he says, “we held our first Watch Night; and, if a de-
lightful congregation, listening with deep seriousness and attention to the word
of exhortation, and a considerable measure of hallowed feeling resting upon the
mind, may be taken as indications of future prosperity, then we may expect
that prosperity much more abundant than that of the past shall crown the labours
of the ensuing year.” The congregations at Queen Charlotte’s Vale and Mac-
quarie Plains were very encouraging, and, notwithstanding the recent effort on
behalf of the new Chapel, the people had raised £l4O towards the support of
the Missionary. There was also an increase in membership of 17 for the year.

Ihe work now gave signs of development. The District Meeting of 1839
said it was absolutely necessary that another Preacher be employed in the dis-
trict. “ The Circuit will be one hundred miles in length, and in its wide ex-
tent embraces a great number of places which are not visited by a Christian
Minister, and the persons resident at them never hear a sermon.” The past
year, said Mr. Lewis, “ had been distinguished by the formation of a Branch
Missionary Society, and by a pleasing increase in the funds. At the formation
of the Society we were favoured with the presence of the Brethren, J. McKenny,
J. Watkin, and J. Hunt, who by their excellent sermons and speeches excited
very considerable interest in behalf of the Missionary Cause. The public
Meeting was truly interesting, the congregations respectable and numerous,
and the collection surpassed any previously realised in the Colony.” There
was an increase of £6O on the year; and this, Mr. Lewis said, was the first
fruits of the harvest that would follow. But he found one drop of bitterness in
his cup of joy. The principal teacher in the Sabbath School had removed into
the country, the parents were indifferent as to the children’s attendance, and
the Sunday School had been suspended. Next year the District Meeting found
additional incentive to action in the presence of two Romish Priests, “ and our
minds are greatly pained by the fact.” One remained in the town, while the
other traversed the “ immediate neighbourhood.” “ The plan pursued by them
we wish to adopt,” said the Missionaries ; and “ there must be another Preacher
on the Station.” But notwithstanding the Priest’s presence Mr. Lewis told the
District Meeting: “ With several of the older members of Society we are much
pleased, as their experience fully justifies the conclusion that they ‘ are journey-
ing unto the place of which the Lord hath said I will give it you ’; while their
conversation and example speak loudly to those around. ... In pecuniary
matters we have also done remarkably well, having raised (in addition to the
sum of £l4O towards the Mission House, which has been commenced) upwards
of £2lO, being an increase of £3O on the past year.” To assist the building of
the Mission House the Government consented to give a grant of £520.
Mr. Lewis was succeeded by the Rev. D. J. Draper, who left Parramatta
on the 26th February (1840), and reached Bathurst three days later, after a safe
and pleasant journey over the Blue Mountains. Mr. James Byrnes accompanied
him six miles on the road. Travelling in those days was an expensive matter.
It cost £B2 12s. 6d. to take Mr. Draper and his furniture to Bathurst! During
the year 1841 he was able to report that a small Chapel had been commenced at
Springfield. “ Half an acre of land has been presented to the Society by Mr.
John Glasson, who, with other friends in the neighbourhood, are resolved to
finish the building at their own expense. It is almost ready for the roof, and will
be finished in a few months.” This Chapel was built of stone, being 24ft. by
16ft. in dimension. The year following Mr. John West, senr., gave half an acre
of land at Macquarie Plains, and in 1844 the Chapel was erected largely through
the liberality “ of the Messrs. West, who have subscribed handsomely.”
“In travelling these parts,” Mr. Draper wrote, “ one stands in need of
strong nerves and unshaken trust in God ; for our ears are frequently saluted
with accounts of atrocities committed by armed bushrangers, and our eyes not
unfrequently behold scenes where they have for a season spread terror and


alarm. ’ 11 is journeys not only involved long rides and personal peril, but fre-
quent absence from home. His stay in Bathurst appears to have been a period
of success and happiness, and his Journal gives evidence of earnest yearnings
for the souls over whom he watched ; and also of his joy at tokens of Divine
favour and blessing upon the people. He speaks of preaching to “ encouraging
congregations, many of whom had come five or six miles ” to the service ; of
being “ thankful to bear precious seed to a soil so much neglected ” ; of “ great
seriousness and attention being manifested while he exhorted them to love Christ
and keep His commandments ” ; of thankfulness to God “ that he had been able
to be faithful, and deliver his soul in warning the people.” —[Draper s Life ,
p. 43.) One extract from his Journal will give some idea of his work in the
Circuit.
Sunday, May 17th, 1840. —This morning I was favoured with a comfortable
sense of the Divine presence, which proved the earnest of a good day. Preached
at 11 a.m. from Joshua xxiii. A good congregation: the Lord favoured me with
liberty, and the people heard with very great attention. May their profiting
appear to all. Having taken a hasty dinner I mounted my horse and rode to
Springfield, where I arrived a little before six o’clock, and preached to a very
respectable and attentive congregation, from John xiv., 15. The whole of the
families in this neighbourhood are emigrants from Cornwall, who, having been
some years in the Colony, are pretty well established. About thirty persons at-
tended the preaching, most of whom are young persons, for whose salvation I was
much led out in prayer. Having completed my work for the day, and closed it
in the enjoyment of the Divine favour, I felt that ‘ the sleep of the labouring man
is sweet’ ”
The Rev. Samuel Wilkinson, who followed Mr. Draper in 1843, wrote: —
M At King’s Plains, a temporary place of worship is in course of erection. The
people have been visited, and Divine Service held for the first time, or recom-
menced at Emu Swamp, Pretty Plains, King’s Plains, and the higher parts of the
Fish River; at Kelso, the next township in general importance to Bathurst,
we have opened a Sabbath School, and commenced service on the Sabbath
•afternoon.” Mr. Wilkinson also states that a Day School had been opened at
Bathurst with fluctuating numbers, and inadequate remuneration for the
Teachers. “ The withdrawal of Government assistance for educational purposes,
•or what amounts to the same, the restrictions under which it is at present doled
out, has done a great injury to the rising generation of the Colony.” The Boys’
School closed after a brief period, but the Girls’ department continued. In 1844
Mr. Wilkinson said the Quarterly Meeting appointed “four promising young
men ” as Exhorters, while he himself paid his first visit to Hartley Vale and
Summer Hill. Summer Hill was “32 miles from Bathurst West,” and Hartley
Vale “45 miles east.” At both places the great Head of the Church had placed
open doors. The next year disclosed further developments. “ During the
year,” to quote the District Meeting Records, “ a quarterly visit to Carcoar has
been made. This is the principal township south-west of Bathurst. Here we
have a few members of Society, and a people anxious to hear the Gospel. A
place of worship is in course of erection at Glyndwr, on the Fish River. Sub-
scriptions are being raised for a new Chapel at Hassan s Walls. The difficulty

of obtaining land in a good situation, with a good title, has been the chief hind-
rance to our having the same at Hartley. The houses in which service is held
are generally crowded with attentive hearers. The sum of £IOO has been paid
towards the reduction of the debt upon the Chapel and Mission House in
Bathurst; and the munificent offer of our friend, Wm. Lane, Esq., the re-
mainder is in a great measure provided for. We are glad to record this year as
the first in which the expenses of the Circuit have been paid by its regular in-
come.”
Rev. Benjamin Hurst informed the District Meeting (1846) that with
sorrow he had to report a decrease in the number of members during the
past year; but that, he said, was not surprising when they remembered the
religious excitement which had previously prevailed. Yet he believed the
Society to be in a more flourishing state, and there had been a decided improve-
ment in the congregation at Bathurst, every seat in the Chapel being let. “At
the Green Swamp, 12 miles from Bathurst, a congregation has been raised
during the year, a Class has been formed, and through the Divine blessing
upon the Word preached some had been recovered from the ways of sin, and
were now rejoicing in a clear and delightful sense of God’s mercy towards them
in forgiving their trespasses. The Circuit finances were never in a better state
than at present. The ordinary income has improved, and is still improving;
and notwithstanding the great expenses of removal from Sydney to Bathurst,
there is a balance in hand of T32 6s. gd. The whole debt of the Bathurst
Chapel and Mission House, amounting to £2lO, has been paid off, principally
through the princely liberality of old and long-tried friends, who subscribed the
noble sum of Tioo towards this object. So that, notwithstanding the pain
caused by the unfaithfulness of a few, we have much to be thankful for as to
the past, and to encourage us with regard to the future. On this Circuit there
is abundance of work for two Missionaries, and could a young man be appointed
to it, there would be no difficulty in raising his entire support.”
Next year Mr. Hurst said that he had met with considerable
opposition from wicked and unreasonable men by means of which a few
members had been greatly injured and others had been induced to leave the
Society. But, notwithstanding, there had been many cheering signs of God’s
presence and approbation. The congregation had been thinned by the removal
of about 50 of its members, but the attendance, notwithstanding, continued to
improve, so that additional accommodation had been provided for 140 per-
sons by the enlargement of the Chapel at a cost of Y300.' A Class had been
formed, and public services commenced, at Campbell River, where the congre-
gations were very encouraging. The arrival of a pious family from Ireland
had also led to the formation of a Class at Meadow Flats. The Chapel at
Bowenfells was completed and opened for Divine service, but its distance pre-
vented the possibility of paying it much attention.
The following year the Rev. J. G. Millard was appointed Assistant Mis-
sionary, and together they were able to report to the District Meeting of 1848
that for many years past they had not been favoured with so many, and such
clear indications of a genuine revival of the work of God. Several were deeply


convinced of sin, others were earnestly seeking peace with God, and many
older members had been quickened in their desire to obtain holiness of heart.
“ With the administration of the Sacrament a few weeks ago the presence of
God was felt in a remarkable manner; every soul present was bathed in sacred
influence, and we had a delightful foretaste of the joys of Heaven.” The
service which had been previously held at Summer Hill was transferred to Rose
Hill, where there was every prospect of a good congregation ; and “ a grant of
two acres of land in the village of Orange has been obtained from the Govern-
ment, and we are seriously purposing to build a Chapel upon it the ensuing
year.” A Class was also commenced at Hasson’s Walls, and the services of the
Chapel were much blessed. Guyong was also taken up as a preaching place,
and the congregation was good and encouraging. During this year, a brick
school-room, 30ft. x 16ft., was erected at the rear of the Chapel at a cost of
ABO, and was free from debt. The School had never been in a more pros-
perous state, and arrangements were being made to commence a Day School in
Bathurst.
Mr. Hurst was now removed to Sydney East, his place being taken by the
Rev. Benjamin Chapman, who had with him the Rev. William Byrnes as
Assistant. Mr. Chapman said that the past year had been an eventful one in
the history of the Circuit owing to the action of a few persons who had
endeavoured to sow the seeds of discord and strife ; but this was soon over-
come, and the greatest cordiality and brotherly love prevailed. The employ-
ment of a second preacher had enabled them to pay greater attention to the
places previously on the plan, and to visit regularly several new places. The
result was that the Churches had been strengthened, the newly-arrived emi-
grants had been saved from wandering as sheep without a shepherd, and the
Word had been blessed to the conversion of many sinners. The income Bad
been equal to the expenditure, and, but for the large fall in the price of wool,
which prevented some from redeeming their promises, there would have been
a surplus on the year. During the year “a very excellent brick Chapel, 30ft.
x 16ft. in the clear, has been erected at a cost of about £110” at Orange.
“ The most lively interest in this object was manifested by the people in the
neighbourhood, and as nearly everyone of them contributed something towards
its erection it is free from debt. It was opened for Divine service on the first
of July, when the congregations were most encouraging. The sum of £l2
was contributed on the occasion. As the population is increasing, we have a
fair prospect of raising a very flourishing cause here.” The mines at Molong
and Bathurst had been supplied with Ministerial labour once a month. At
the Bathurst mines (26 miles from Bathurst) service had been held in the house
of Mr. Thomas Pye, who had not only placed a large room at their disposal, but
should the mine succeed, had promised to give ground for a Chapel,
The next year (1850) Mr. Chapman wrote that at Bathurst the congrega-
tions were large and increasing, and that generally the work was in a flourish-
ing condition. Cottage Prayer Meetings had been productive of much good,
and the Ladies’ Sewing Society, by its useful exertions, had afforded valuable
aid during the past year. The population at Cornish Settlement had con-


siderably increased, and promised soon to be much larger. Here the Chapel
was already inconveniently small. At Orange, where an excellent Chapel had
been erected the previous year, there were several friends in the neighbourhood
who regularly attended. Owing to the extensive Circuit, the place had been
supplied with Preachers from Cornish Settlement. Bowenfells was still, Mr.
Chapman said, a wonder to them, for there God had done wonderful things. A
visit had also been paid to Rylstone in consequence of urgent invitations and
the rumour of a revival of religion, due mainly to the influence of a young man
who had called at Bowenfells on his return journey from Sydney. After much
distiess this young man found peace with God, and opened his house for
prayer on the Sabbath day. Thus when the Preacher visited the place, he found
the people prepared, and iri the afternoon preached to a very interesting con-
gregation thankful for the Word. In the evening he met the little Society so
providentially gathered “out of the wilds,’” and gave notes on trial to six per-
sons, five of whom had since been received into Church membership. They
were still zealously pursuing their course, striving to grow in grace. Mr. Chap-
man regretted that they were unable to do more for this district, which was
fast becoming populous.
The next year he wrote that the discovery of rich gold mines in the imme-
diate vicinity and on almost every side of them had considerably interrupted
and disorganised various departments of their work. A great number of their
members and hearers had left their homes for the diggings, and the Sunday
congregations were considerably reduced. Local Preachers and Class Leaders
were among those who had suddenly become gold-miners, and the diminished
attention to the means of grace, together with worldly attractions, had tended
to lower the tone of Christian feeling. They had sought to follow the gold-
diggers to the busy scenes of operation, and to bestow upon them what atten-
tion was within their power. “ The portion of the diggings first discovered,”
Mr. Chapman wrote, “ has been denominated Ophir, and are about forty miles
west of Bathurst. These were visited by us immediately, and public worship
was held there the first Sabbath after they were generally known, and while
there were only a few hundreds of miners on the Creeks. The population of
Ophir rapidly increased to several thousands. After the first few weeks the
wicked men were emboldened to sin with little fear. Sad immoralities were
practised, the Sabbath was awfully desecrated. We continued to preach there
as often as possible. By many we were cordially welcomed, and generally
obtained large and attentive congregations. In consequence of the discovery
of other diggings, and the increased difficulty of working these on account of
the flooding of creeks from the winter rains, the greater portion of the miners
left, so that the present mining population of Ophir is not more than a few
hundreds. When, however, the waters of the creeks subside no doubt
thousands will again flock thither.
“ The diggings on the Turon River have also recently been visited. The
population working in this neighbourhood is to be numbered by thousands.
On the occasion of the visit referred to, we held four religious services in the
open air. The opportunity of hearing the Word was gladly embraced by many

FUEDK. LEWIS, Minister


of our members who were within reach, in addition to whom considerable num-
bers of all grades of religious opinion, and some perhaps of no religious opinion
at all, seemed well pleased to join with us in our Sabbath religious exercises.
Here also, as at Ophir, immorality abounds, and a wide scope is presented for
the exercise of Christian sympathy. We are glad that some of our respected
Brethren, the Local Preachers from our own, and other Circuits, have not for-
gotten the Saviour’s claim upon their service, and have boldly stood forth in
His name to call sinners to the Saviour. Their efforts have generally been
acceptable. As at Ophir, we attempted on the Turon to organise a Society.
But time will only tell whether our efforts will prove more successful than at
the former place. In Bathurst, though so many usually worshipping with us
have removed, our Sabbath congregations are not so much diminished as might
be expected, owing chiefly to the influx of visitors from other places. But the
week-evening Classes and services have fallen off considerably. At the begin-
ning of the year we had very cheering tokens of the Divine Presence. The
Word of the Lord had free course—while our members generally evidenced a
growth of grace—several hearers were convinced of sin. Of late, however,
we are sorry that the state of the work has not been so encouraging.”
The Rev. Samuel Wilkinson now took up the work at Bathurst, being
appointed to this station for the second time. The baneful influence of worldly
cares and desires, and the extraordinary pressure of worldly business conse-
quent on the scarcity of labour, had been severely felt, he said ; and they had to
deplore the sad effects of the strife and disorder of former years. But not-
withstanding the discovery of gold, their contributions to Missions had con-
siderably increased. At the Turon, where there had been many changes, much
positive good had been effected. At Sofala, where the junior Minister resided
a greater part of his time, a weatherboard Chapel had been erected. The
inhabitants of the vast interior, lying beyond the limits of his Circuit were, he
said, in a deplorable state of destitution, calling imperatively for Christian Mis-
sionaries. The Rev. John Pemell, who had now been placed in charge of the
new Circuit, must be allowed to tell the story in his own way; “In December,
1849, I was sent 1° Bathurst, the Minister in charge being the Rev. Benjamin
Chapman. The Circuit was low in piety, for there had been a fourth year’s
appointment against which the people protested. Great discord existed, and
Cornish Settlement had separated itself. Gold was discovered at Ophir Creek
by Mr. Hargraves and Mr. Tom’s son. Mr. Chapman went one Sunday for
service, and I went the following Sabbath, the Methodist Ministers being the
first to visit the places. I reached Mr. Thomson’s tent, tied up my pony, placed
a log on him, and was invited to a feast of damper and mutton and tea without
milk, sweetened with black sugar. At night a large opossum rug was spread
on the grass, on which eight men lay; I made the ninth. I found some Local
Preachers there, and I preached from the words: 1 The Spirit and the Bride
say come.’ I had to visit Orange. There were no roads then, not even a
sheep track. At Orange there was but one store, a hotel, a smithy, and a
miserable hut or two.


“In the year 1851 a new Circuit was formed, of which I was Superinten-
dent. The Circuit included Fish River, Jenolan Caves, Bowenfells, Hartly,
Meadow Flat, and Riverlet. I lived with various friends, and spent a week
or two at each place. The Church was of stone with two windows on each
side, a door at one end and the fireplace at the other. I had to sleep in the
little stone Church. Putting two forms together I spread my mattress on them,
bringing my pillow and blankets from behind a calico screen. At Jenolan
Caves we had a Chapel built of sod walls. I was the first Minister at Rylstone
in 1852-3. I found Mrs. Provis there. We had a revival, and I visited them
once a month. An old man named Read, converted at the age of 82, learnt to
read, and died at 84. While I was at Joseph Taylor’s Mrs. Stewart arrived,
having ridden seventeen miles in order to get converted. We got two acres of
land as a grant, and got up a brick Church. The Rev. W. B. Boyce opened
the Church, and several souls were saved. There was no debt. On leaving
Rylstone I was presented with a purse containing £35 and an address of con-
gratulation.
“I was also the first Minister at Mudgee, Joe Taylor taking me from
Rylstone on horseback. We applied for lodgings at the only decent inn in
Mudgee ; but as there was no room, Mr. Simpson, a blacksmith, took me into
his house and I lay on the hard floor without bedding and a blanket over me.
I arranged for service in the Court House, attending the Church in the morn-
ing. At night the Court House was filled, Nicholas Bailey being in the con-
gregation. After the service I asked all the Wesleyans to remain, and I
formed a Class appointing Mr. Lovejoy, from Cow Pastures, to meet them
during my absence. Mr. Moss allowed me the use of his slab hut for preach-
ing for one year without payment. The hut was a mere frame without floor
or windows. Mr. Bailey, who gave me a home, said: ‘ That room is yours,
never mind who is here.’ A lad helped me to saw some logs for the support of
cedar boards with which to make seats for the congregation. I made my own
pulpit, and boarded off part of the Church for my bedroom. Thinking of get-
ting up a brick Church, I selected two acres of land in Mortimer Street, formed
a building Committee of Messrs. Blakeman, Viles, Amos, Lovejoy, and myself,
and we determined to build a Church 36 x 16. Mr. Blakeman gave £5O, and
the cedar ceiling, and Mr. Viles £5O and all the carting. The building, which
was fitted up with pews throughout, cost £5OO, and was opened free of debt.
The foundation stone was laid by the Rev. J. K. Piddington, and as we had
nothing adequate with which to lower the stone Mr. Piddington pushed it into
position. The Rev. B. Chapman came up from Sydney to dedicate the Church.
As there were several applications for pews, we resolved that at 10 a.m. on
Monday the doors should be thrown open on the principle of ‘ first come first
served.’ Ten minutes after, all the seats were taken, except one, which I took
for my wife. We secured a bell from Bromby and fixed it to a neighbouring
chimney. When the Church was built I lived in the old slab hut. I was also
the first Minister to visit Wellington. In 1854-5, I visited Dubbo, where I
found two or three Methodist families. I engaged the Court House for preach-
ing purposes, and the Chief Constable was present. He took up a tray and
insisted on making a collection. I selected a site—the usual two acres for
Church purposes.”


HUNTER RIVER.
The Hunter River District with its spiritual needs was first brought under
the notice of the Missionary Committee by the District Meeting of 1832, when
it was stated that there were 2,000 residents in the District. This appeal was
repeated the year following, and again in 1835, when Maitland had been visited
by the Chairman, who reported on the prospects of Methodism in the most flat-
tering terms; but the matter remained in abeyance till 1838, when the District
Meeting presented a more urgent plea. For during the year 1837 Mr. Jeremiah
Ledsam had introduced Methodism into the District. Mr. Ledsam had recently
arrived from Ireland with credentials from Gideon Ouseley and other Ministers,
He settled in Maitland as a coachbuilder, combining with his trade the duties of
an auctioneer. He was a Preacher of more than ordinary ability. On the first
Sabbath evening after his arrival he preached in his own house to an attentive
congregation, and during the week rented a billiard room at the rear of Gorrick’s
buildings at an annual rental of £ 2O, 2 The seats and reading desk were fur-
nished by Mr. Vincent G. Williams, a cabinet maker, and here the services were
held for four years. The first Watch Night Service took place on the 31st De-
cember, 1837, and was conducted by Mr. Ledsam and Mr. Williams. They soon
conferred with each other relative to the acquisition of a site for a Chapel. A
public Meeting was convened, at which, by resolution, it was resolved to purchase
land. Mr. Ledsam was to collect subscriptions “ throughout the outlying Dis-
tricts ” ; while Messrs. V. G. Williams, George Denshire, and James Bicknell
“ were to put forth their energies in Maitland and its neighbourhood.” In a few
months the sum of £270 was collected and placed in the Commercial Bank, to-
gether with £3O forwarded by the Rev. John McKenny. To this
amount the Executive Council added a grant of £3OO, and, accompanied
by Mr. Williams, Mr. Ledsam purchased the present site from Mr. Charles
Robins ; the adjoining allotment on which the parsonage now stands being
secured soon after. The foundation stone of the Chapel was laid by Mr. William
Galway the contractor ; and the top stone was put in its place before the arrival
of the first Missionary, the Rev. Jonathan Innes. 3
In a letter to the Superintendent, the Rev. John McKenny, Mr. Ledsam
gave the following particulars of his work:—-
“ The last Sabbath we commenced school at nine o’clock, when the children
numbered 21. On December 3rd the number was 17. The prospects respect-
ing this school are cheering, as I anticipate through the Divine Blessing that
many more will be induced to assemble for the purpose of receiving religious in-
struction. You will please sanction the appointment of Bro. Williams as General
Superintendent of Maitland Sabbath School. The public services commence on
Sabbath days at 11 p.m., when Bro. W. reads the Church service ; at its close
2 This room was in the back yard of Norton the publican.
3 Mr. Joseph Caddy, who knew Mr. Ledsam, relates the following incident:—“l
recollect that he had been holding a sale in the village during the week, and on the
Sabbath he preached in our Chapel. Some of the funny ones were there; and in his
earnestness he knocked the Bible, when someone called out; ‘Knock it down, Jerry.’
But Brother Dyer said: ‘Amen!’ Brother Dudley: ‘Hallelujah’; Brother Clarke:
‘Bless the Lord’; and another Brother; ‘Amen.’ Jerry was right and the others were
silenced.”

the Methodistic service is entered upon. The forenoon service concludes about
a quarter before one. School recommences at 2 and terminates at 4 o’clock.
Preaching at half past six. lam happy to inform you the evening service con-
tinues to be well attended ; there were not less than 50 persons in the house last
Sabbath evening. The congregation appeared to be all eye, all ear. I have in-
duced Bro. Williams to assist me in the evening by commencing the service by
prayer, or should I commence, after the service I give place to Bro. W. that he
may conclude. The rules of our Society were read Sabbath evening last: the
entire congregation remained. I read a few extracts from your letter, and
dwelt especially upon your intended visit to Maitland. Your visit to Maitland
will be calculated to strengthen the weak hands, and I make no doubt will also be
attended with good to the people ; and also have the tendency of giving additional
evidence that the services are conducted under the sanction of the Methodist


Superintendent of the Missions in N.S.W. You cannot reasonably put off your
visit to us longer than the first week in the new year. Tuesdays and Fridays are
evenings for prayer. At seven o’clock a few attend. A Class has also been
formed which meets on Sabbath afternoons at 4 o’clock. It now numbers five.
On this point I am very cautious, and hesitate in pressing persons to join us
until, by constant attendance on public worship they evidence a sincere desire
to flee from the wrath to come.”— (JDistrict Minutest)
After his removal to Tasmania as Chairman of that District the Rev. J.
Orton visited Port Phillip a second time, and made a long journey of inspection
in connection with the proposed Mission to the Aborigines. Before he had com-
pleted this tour he received instructions to proceed to the Friendly Isles to in-
vestigate certain charges made against the Rev. John Thomas by “ the notorious P.
Dillon. Reaching Sydney with all haste he was detained waiting for a vessel;
and while thus waiting, the Committee’s instructions were countermanded. Dur-
ing this time of enforced idleness he determined to visit the Hunter River Dis-
trict. Leaving on board the steamer Sophia Jane , in company with his old
friend, Mr. Lancelot Iredale, he reached Newcastle Friday morning, 9th August,
1 839, at 7 o clock. After taking in 10 tons of coal they proceeded up the Hunter
River, “ gliding with considerable rapidity along its very tortuous course, and
arrived at Morpeth, or Green Hills, about noon.” From Morpeth they took a
vehicle “ something like a caravan,” which was waiting to take them to Mait-
land. “ The roads were extremely bad ; and the unbending springs of our car-
riage ill-suited to the roughness thereof, the result of which was that we were
almost shaken to death.” Mr. Iredale suffered so woefully that he had to retire
for a short time in order to compose himself! The remaining part of the day
was spent in pastoral visiting and in inspecting the new Chapel then in course of
erection.
Of Sunday, August nth, which was a full day, Mr. Orton wrote in
his Journal; —“ Preached at Morpeth in the morning from Rom. viii., 6v. After
the public service I baptised the following children: —Adeliza Maria, daughter of
Vincent George and Ann Williams. Born 9th April, 1839. Mary Ann Bowden,
daughter of Jeremiah and Eliza Ledsam. Bom Ist july, 1839. Preached in
the evening at Maitland from Proverbs xxiii., 24 v. Afterwards administered
the Sacrament of the Lord’s Supper.” Next day they visited Mr. Crofton’s resi-
dence, “ situated about 7 miles from West Maitland in a southerly direction.”
In the evening Mr. Orton preached in Maitland from 11. Cor. viii., 9v. “ The
promising cause here,” he says, “ has been raised principally by the laudable
zeal, persevering exertions, and consistent deportment of a Local Preacher from
Ireland named Jeremiah Ledsam ; by whose instrumentality preaching has been
established, a Society formed, and a neat substantial Chapel nearly finished, and
which will be completed free from encumbrance. The prospect here is very
encouraging, and the cause would no doubt progress rapidly if they have a Mis-
sionary amongst them. There is an extensive field for usefulness which ought
to be immediately entered.”
The traffic on the River Hunter at that time was obstructed, and there was
then some talk of the formation of a Company to remove these obstructions and

to bring more steamers into the Hunter River trade, “ which is very desirable,”
said Mr. Orton, “ as at present the whole is in the hands of one person, who
has too much of his own way to be sufficiently accommodating to the public.”
There was then in existence a spirit of jealousy between East and West Mait-
land as to which place was of the greater importance ; but Mr. Orton predicted
that would disappear, when, by the increase of population and buildings, they
became one. Their “ present jealousies ” would then “ merge in a common in-
terest.” Next day he breakfasted with “ Edward Sparke, Esq.” and in the
afternoon bid farewell to the Maitland friends and proceeded to Hinton, where
he was “ hospitably entertained by Mr. James, formerly of Sydney.” On the
return journey his spirit was somewhat perturbed in the first instance by a
“ young, conceited, self-complacent gentleman,” who, with “ extreme loquacity,”
advocated summarily flogging of the blacks without trial. The second cause of
annoyance was the conduct of a Romish priest who came on board “with a sort
of wiry dancy step, which I imagine to be peculiar to the fraternity,” and pro-
ceeded to make a “ pious parade ” of a small Bible, which evidently was of
greater service for show than study. Though Mr. Orton was him-
self unable to visit Maitland again, he suggested to the Rev.
Nathaniel Turner that he should spend a Sabbath there, which he
did in the latter part of the year 1839. He was warmly received by Mr. Ledsam ;
and as the Chapel was not yet complete he preached twice in the billiard room

to good congregations, gave tickets to the members and administered the Lord’s
Supper to the Society and a few other pious persons. Of the District he said:
A more beautiful and fertile country I never saw in all my travels.”
The Rev. Jonathan Innes, the first Missionary to be stationed at West
Maitland, arrived during the year 1840. His appointment, he said, was regarded
by the people with gratitude to God and to the Committee. In his first report
to the District Meeting he records a gift of land at Patrick’s Plains by Mr. J.
Kingsbury for the erection of a Chapel and dwelling house, and on which a
School House, used as a Chapel, had been erected free of expense to the Mis-
sion. And he proceeds to say; “At Patrick’s Plains our Day School is in a
prosperous state, and is conducted on strictly religious principles. At Newcastle
our congregation upon an average amounts to 100 on the Sunday evenings that
we have preaching there ; and they are very attentive to the word preached.
Our Ministry here is much prized, and could we visit them regularly every Sab-
bath, many would join our Society. At Raymond Terrace we have recently es-
tablished preaching, which has been well attended by many of the scattered
settlers who manifested great anxiety for our continued exertions there, and
eight have joined the Society.” At Newcastle there was the prospect of estab-
lishing a good school which would have been undertaken earlier but for want of
a suitable Schoolmaster. In 1844 the Government granted half an acre of land
on which to erect a Chapel; 4 and one year later a second grant of half an acre

was made adjoining the first site. An acre was also given for the purposes of a
Burial Ground. Fortunately, the Schoolmaster was found in the person of Mr.
William Lightbody, a native of Ireland ; who was for a time Minister among
the Primitive Methodists, and became a Wesleyan Missionary in New South
Wales. On his arrival in the Colony he was employed as a Local Preacher and
School Teacher in Sydney and the Hunter River Circuit “with great acceptance
and usefulness.” Mr. Lightbody gathered around him a band of earnest people
who met regularly in a building situated at the corner of Newcomen and Scott
Streets. Plis co-workers were Messrs. Nixon, Jackson, Tulip, and George
Thrums. 5 In 1841 Mr. Innes referred to the success of the Day School established
at Maitland, and adds, “ a Day School has also been opened at Wollombi ” on a
site granted by the Government for that purpose. The School House was to be
built at the sole expense of the settlers, “ who feel a lively interest in its being
established.” So also did the Papists, from whom considerable opposition was
encountered; “ but their object has been defeated,” adds Mr. Innes. In 1844
the Government gave additional land for the purposes of a Chapel and Burial
Ground. In 1842 Mr. Innes commenced services at the Paterson River, “where
we have two pious members and good congregations,” who soon set to work, for
in the year following they were erecting a Chapel “ built of slabs, plaistered inside
and stuccoed outside. Its dimensions are 30ft. by 16ft., and it is fully expected
that no debt will remain on it.”
In 1843 Mr. Innes removed to Windsor, his place being filled by the Rev.
Frederick Lewis, who, with characteristic fervour, took up the work of this pro-
mising District. “ The Lord has favoured us,” he says, “ with an encouraging
degree of prosperity during the year. Our congregations are improving. A very
gracious influence has attended the preaching of the Gospel. A few fresh locali-
ties have engaged our attention and labours during the year. One of these,
the Upper Allyn, a distance of about 45 miles from Maitland, has for some time
past needed the visits of a Minister of the Gospel.” The remarkable work in the
Allyn River was brought about through the united efforts of Messrs. T. Doust
and W. S. Grenfell; who, being much concerned about the low state of morals
in their district, wrote to Mr. Lewis, requesting him to send them a Local
Preacher and they would guarantee his salary. Mr. Lewis at once sent over
Mr. T. Patterson of Singleton ; who, travelling in Mr. Doust’s dray with his wife
and two children, safely reached his destination and took up his residence in a
“humpy parsonage” built by Mr. Munsey and Mr. Grenfell. Two Sabbath
services were held at Camberwell and one at a place higher up the River with
prayer meetings during the week, Mr. Lewis paying a Quarterly visit, “ rain or
shine.” Mr. Patterson visited the William’s River and commenced services at
Dungog. Subsequently some of these Methodists passed on to the Manning
and assisted in the introduction of Methodism there. About twenty persons
joined the Society, and so anxious were they for the means of grace that they en-
gaged to subscribe A4O per annum to secure the services of Mr. Patterson as
Schoolmaster and Preacher. In 1844 the Government granted them three acres
of land for the purposes of the Mission. At Newcastle the cause was flourish-

ing. There were 50 members and a congregation of 200 hearers, whose re-
gularity and serious deportment inspired the hope that they too would soon join
the Society. A new Chapel was in course of erection which would be opened
shortly. 6 At West Maitland a Religious Tract Society was organised and in
active operation ; while by an extraordinary effort the sum of A 270 was paid off
the debt on the Chapel. At East Maitland Mrs. Muir and her son James pre-
sented an acre of land to the Mission on which to erect a Chapel.
The year 1845 witnessed a great extension of the work, which Mr. Lewis
shall tell in his own way: “In reviewing the present state of the Society we are
happy to record the fact that on the whole they are in a tolerably prosperous
condition. In some localities the Lord has indeed done great things for us
whereof we are glad. In West Maitland the congregations have been good, and
several have been turned from darkness to light, and are now consistent mem-
bers of Society. We indulge the hope that the day is not far distant when a
second Missionary will be appointed to this Circuit. In the town of East Mait-
land our prospects at the present time are somewhat cheering. Since our last
District Meeting we have succeeded in the erection of a very comfortable Chapel,
which has cost about £35. It was opened for Divine Service on Whit Sunday,
when it was crowded with attentive hearers. Since that period our congrega-
tions are much improved. Many very gratifying conversions have recently taken
place, and the increase in Church members has been such as to render it neces-
sary to divide the Class, and a third will shortly be required.
“ At Newcastle a variety of causes have conspired to distract the minds of
our people and to hinder the prosperity of our work. The removal by death of
our highly esteemed, and truly devoted Brother Cox, who held the offices of
Local Preacher, Class Leader, and Day School teacher, was severely felt. Our
new Chapel was opened on the 29th June by Rev. D. J. Draper. The congre-
gations were large and respectable, the sermons excellent, and collections very
satisfactory. In our opinion this rising town ought to have a single Preacher
stationed in it. At the Wollombi a small Society, consisting of about twenty
persons, has been formed. At Singleton, Paterson, and Raymond Terrace
we are still called to sow in hope, but little fruit having as yet appeared to cheer
us in our work. On the Allyn River the Lord continues to bless the labours of
His servants. Here such is the thirst of the people for the ordinances of re
hgion that we have known men and women to walk about 28 miles to heai the
Word of God. We have here an interesting Society of about 40 persons. At
the head of the William’s River, where until lately the Gospel of Christ had
never been heard, the Lord has visited His people in mercy. We have seen
seventy persons assembled in a bark hut in a dense forest on a dark night to hear
the Gospel. A class of fifteen persons has been formed, and if properly attended
to a prosperous Society will be raised. We have also been earnestly solicited
to visit Port Stephens and Muswellbrook where we are informed there are a few
members of our Society who are as sheep without a shepherd. Upwards of
sixty souls have been added to our number during the year, and the fields are yet
white unto the harvest.”— (District Meeting Minutes .)

This story of Methodism in the Hunter River District would be incomplete
without reference to the laymen who assisted the early Missionaries in their
ertorts to spread the benefits of the Gospel. Some of these laymen were the
pioneers of the Methodist Church, and opened the doors through which the Mis-
sionaries passed to usefulness and success. Jeremiah Ledsam has already been
referred to. Mr. Robert Belford, or “ Bishop Belford ” as he was popularly
called, was one of these early pioneers. An Irishman by birth, he left London-
derry in the ship Portland, preaching every Sunday on the poop, while the
Romanists held service on the forecastle. He reached Sydney in the early
part of 1838 to find a year of famine succeeding a severe drought. Interviewing
the Rev. John McKenny at the Emigration Barracks in Hunter Street, and through
the assistance of the Rev. Robert Blain, Presbyterian Minister of Maitland, he
was engaged as Overseer to a gentleman known as “ Parson Woods,” who had
been a Catechist in the Anglican Church. “We had ” then, says Mr. Belford, “ a
small cause in Maitland, consisting of a few members, viz.: Mr. Ledsam, Mr. C.
Crofton, Mr. Griffiths, Mr. Galway, an architect who built the Church of England,
Mr. Joseph Ede Pearce, myself, and a few others.” Accompanied by Mr. Led-
sam, Mr. Belford went to Morpeth, where they held the first Wesleyan Service in
the open air as the people were leaving the Anglican Church. “ That was the
commencement of a good work at Morpeth,” he adds. He then re-
moved to Nelson’s Plains, near to Raymond Terrace, where he found a Class
already in existence. “ I had services on the Sabbath in Mrs. Gilbert’s house,
until we fitted up a nice little place belonging to Mr. Boots ; Mr. John Richard
Moulding took a seat in it, and helped us along until we were able to build a
snug little Chapel of our own. Our Society was increasing, Mr. Pearce removed
to the Plains, and shortly after the Rev. Jonathan Innes was appointed. I then
left the Hunter River District and went to the Manning River, where I was set
down in the midst of dense brush. The Lord helping me, I cleared a spot for a
make-shift, and an influx gathering then to the Manning, I formed a Society, and
had my regular appointments for preaching places as followsGlenthorne, Mr.
Thomas Trotter’s, senr. ; Taree, Mr. C. Crofton’s store; Tinonee, Mr. Thomas
Avery’s and Mr. Carter’s, Presbyterian Minister ; Purfleet, Mr. Murdock’s and
Mr. Clennan’s; Redbank, Mr. Samuel Gibson’s; Chatham, Mr. John Newby’s.”
The meeting at which these preaching arrangements were made was held under
a gum tree on Mr. Belford’s uncleared farm, and the Preachers were " the
Bishop,” Mr. Garratt, Mr. Crofton, and Mr. Isaac Rose. At Mr. Crofton’s store
there were a number of clocks in stock which some mischievous person so ar-
ranged that they should strike the hour of twelve one after the other. This helped
to confound the Preacher, and caused considerable merriment among his
hearers.
“ Mr. William Plummer and myself,” continues Mr. Belford, “ often had to
take off our boots and wade through swamps to get to some of these appoint-
ments, especially Redbank. I recollect my son John and myself were working
in the District three months when I had to go home to the Quarterly Meeting
in West Maitland. When I got home, the Rev. Mr. Angwin was at my place,
and we talked over the advisability of asking for a Missionary for the Manning.

Merewether.
Old Mr. Curry opposed the motion ; Mr. Angwin said he would go if they would
send him; but Mr. Rabone, our Superintendent, said they did not bring out
young men to send them to the bush! ” But “the Bishop” won the day, for
he triumphantly adds: “The motion was carried and the Conference sent the
Rev. John Pemell.”
In the year 1846 Mr. Lewis reported that the work of Ciod had continued to
improve, and several very interesting cases of conversion had taken place,
new Chapel had been opened at Morpeth, 37ft. x 32ft. in dimensions, an event
which they considered of great importance, as it would no doubt lead to the
formation of a good Society there. Several new places, which were in a great
measure destitute of the Gospel had been placed on the plan, and many others
were now inviting their attention. Three additional Sabbath Schools had been
established. The year following he said that in the town of West Maitland the
Society was in an improved condition. The enlargement and very great
improvements made in the Chapel, together with the erection of a large and

commodious vestry at its rear, were likely to prove beneficial to the cause ; and
though upwards of twenty additional pews had been put up they were all let
with the exception of two. At Morpeth there were the germs of a most interest-
ing Society. Since the erection of the Chapel “ a respectable congregation ”
had continued to attend. Through the generosity of the Rev. W. B. Boyce, a
lending library was formed. A weatherboard Chapel, capable of seating 100
persons, was built at Cooley Camp, and at Woodville an interesting Society con-
sisting of twenty-four persons was established. This infant Church was greatly
indebted to a humble man residing in the neighbourhood, whose exertions,
under the blessing of God, had contributed in no small degree to its formation.
Chapels were badly needed at Woodville, Raymond Terrace, and Nelson’s
Plains. At Newcastle the Society was not so prosperous owing to removals and
deaths. The congregation at Sugarloaf had erected a small slab Chapel and
formed a Class of twelve persons. “ More Ministerial labour,” wrote Mr. Lewis,
“ is absolutely necessary for the successful cultivation of this very extensive and


promising field of Missionary toil; and it is hoped that ere long an additional
Minister will be sent to assist in gathering in the precious fruit that is even now
white unto the harvest.”
It was reported to the next District Meeting (1848) that the past year at
Raymond Terrace was one to be long and gratefully remembered, as it was a
year of salvation to many souls. The membership had increased from twelve
to forty. A Missionary Meeting was held for the first time. It was enor-
mously attended,” and produced a lively interest in the cause of Missions. Ser-
vices had also been commenced at Hexham, Stockton and Seaham where a So-
ciety of 20 members had been gathered chiefly composed of persons almost total y
neglected by all and living in the neglect of religion. Camp Meetings had been
held at different periods of the year at West Maitland, Woodville. Raymond
Terrace, and Stanhope. They were well attended, and were accompanied with
the most beneficial results. At Port Macquarie, then formed into a Circuit, 1
was stated that regular services had been held on the Sabbath, and also a
Rolland’s Plains, Kempsey, and occasionally at two other places on the Macieay
River. “ The breaking up of the Government establishments with other cir-
cumstances have led to the removal of a large proportion of the inhabitants of
this district, so that the congregations have been greatly reduced in number.
There is good reason to hope that the word preached has not been altogether
in vain, several individuals having joined the Society who are now enquiring
their way to Zion with their faces thitherward.
Lo\vis now gave way to the Rev. Samuel Wilkinson, who reported to
the District Meeting of 1849 that “for the greater part of the year this Circuit
has had the labours of the Junior Preacher. The advantages derived have been
obvious, the regular income of the Circuit has increased to the amount of £25,
which in addition to subscriptions towards his support will amount to £4O. The
engagement on the part of some of our Leaders that their Classes shall not fall
under the minimum of Methodist rule and the fact that some of their Classes,
not in better circumstances than their neighbours have exceeded this, is worthy
of commendation. The liberality of many of our people is very observable,
but many have still something to learn on this subject. The almost entire
absence of money in some agricultural parts for some months in the year makes
the excellent system of weekly payments not so suitable, so that in our circum-
stances some established and further effort seems to be a desideratum. The
interesting offering of the first fruits after Harvest seems to supply us with our
institutions both Scripturally and appropriately.” During the year they had
paid the balance of debt on the West Maitland Church, amounting to £IOO, and
had also raised A4O for the purchase of a burial ground. The Church was
reported as being much too small. At Morpeth they still enjoyed the most
manifest tokens of Divine blessings, the Chapel debt being liquidated and fur-
ther necessary expense for repairs being incurred. At Woodville a Chapel
was being erected on land given by Dr. Scott. The necessity of a larger place of
worship was still felt at Singleton, but this had been met in some measure by
the Rev. W. B. Boyce, whose help had enabled them to purchase land. Service


had been held in the Court House, where “ enormous congregations attended.”
Mr. Wilkinson adds that in accordance with the wishes of the last District Meet-
ing he made a Missionary tour of three weeks during the month of September to
Muswellbrook, Scone, Murrurundi, and Liverpool Plains, his object being to pre-
pare the way for Mr. Currey, who was appointed to that District. Services were
held at the above-named places, and nearly every house visited, Tracts being
distributed among the people. “The reception from nearly all persons was of
the most kind and hospitable nature, the attendances generally good, and the
readiness expressed by many of the people to support a Minister when sent was
very encouraging. Our impression from all we saw and heard was that the Lord
had opened an effectual door for the Ministry of the Gospel in these parts.”
The Missionary may be allowed to tell the story in his own words; “ The
work in this Circuit has been commenced during the current year. It embraces
a distance of 40 miles on the great Northern road, including Muswellbrook,
Aberdeen, Scone, and the two townships of Haydontown, and Murrurundi; at
each of these places, preaching services have been held once a fortnight. In
neither place have the congregations been large, the number of hearers amount-
ing to one hundred and fifty. A Society has been formed in Muswellbrook,
where the members hold a prayer meeting on the Sabbath, when there is no
preaching, and once on the week day. The prospects of this place are encourag-
ing. Preparations have been made for building a Chapel. About ASO have
been subscribed in Scone for a like purpose. The Preacher in this Circuit has,
during the year, visited several places on Liverpool Plains and New England as
far as Armidale, a distance of 160 miles, preaching at Tamworth and Armidale, as
well as at a number of squatters’ stations. In these districts there is almost
entire destitution of the means of grace and Christian instruction, while there is
an evident desire on the part of the inhabitants to receive the Word of Life.
“ The most remarkable circumstance that has happened is the opposition
that has been offered by certain Clergymen. This has gone so far that one
Minister waited on the Preacher after his first visit to one of the places in the
Circuit, and solemnly protested in the name of God against his ever coming into
his ‘ parish ’ again. And in addition to many other means used to prevent the
people from attending the preaching, published a circular calling upon his
parishoners not to subscribe to ‘ the maintenance of a certain strange and
schismatical Teacher of the sect called Wesleyans.’ This opposition has no
doubt prevented many who would otherwise have attended the preaching. The
prevalence of intemperance in the neighbourhood is truly alarming. There are
seventeen licensed public-houses, and six wholesale dealers in spirituous liquors
in the compass of this Circuit, while there are not more than 300 persons attend-
ing public worship. In addition to other efforts a regular weekly distribution
of Tracts has been commenced, and several families supplied with copies of the
New Testament.”
The next year Mr. Wilkinson wrote in hopeful strains. “ The Missionary
spirit evinced at our Missionary Meetings,” he said, “ has been highly gratifying.
The total amount of AlO2 exceeds last year by £\o. Towards the erection of


SINGLETON CHURCH.
three slab Chapels in different parts of the Circuit upwards of £2OO have been
raised. Towards the support of the second Preacher T3B has been contributed.
And he adds: “At the close of the year, a visit was paid to Stroud, 5° miles from
Maitland, in the above district. A large congregation met to hear the word in
the Court House, which was granted by the authorities for the occasion. We
met with about a dozen persons, who had formerly been members of our Society
in England and elsewhere. That they have still retained the form of godliness and
something of its power amid many unfavourable circumstances was a matter of
thankfulness to God. Our reception was very kind and encouraging.”
Of the new Circuit, placed under the name of Scone, the Assistant Mis-
sionary said the Circuit was rather a Mission by way of experiment in a thinly
peopled district, chiefly important as leading to Liverpool Plains and New Eng-
land. The Preacher had to travel far and to preach to small congregations,


finding here and there a few Methodists. He was preaching in the Court House
at Muswellbrook and holding regular services at Aberdeen and Scone. He thus
concluded his report: “In the course of the year the Preacher has made three
journeys to Liverpool Plains and the Barnett River, and one journey to New
England. Pie was everywhere gladly received, and believes that there is full
employment and ample support in these districts for several active labourers.
Chapels are much wanted in all our preaching places. We have already received
grants of land at Scone, Murrurundi, Aberdeen, and Muswellbrook, and also at
Armidale in New England. We should have commenced Chapels at Muswell-
brook and Scone, but have been restrained by the General Superintendent. In
the ensuing year we believe that the expenses of this Mission will be borne
by the people who benefit by the labours of the Preacher. Considering the
violent and unmeasured opposition of the High Church ‘ Puseyites ’ on the one
hand, and the High Calvinistic Presbyterians on the other, and taking also into
account the amount of personal influence brought to bear upon the inhabitants
of the townships by the resident Episcopalian Clergy, who have recommended
us as Schismatics, etc., we consider the fact of such liberal contributions having
been raised to be no small proof of the quiet progress which our cause is making
in the estimation of a large number of the most respectable people in the Dis-
trict.”
The Rev. Stephen Rabone succeeded Mr. Wilkinson in 1851, and he was
called upon in his first report to speak of the unprecedented commotion and the
comparative desertion of some places in consequence of the gold discovery. But
notwithstanding this they had purchased a piece of land in West Maitland,
adjoining the Mission premises. The foundation for a stone or brick Chapel
had been laid at Raymond Terrace, but the gold discovery had almost dispersed
the people. At Bandon Grove and Dungog there were good congregations, but
they sadly needed a Chapel at Dungog. The following year Mr. Rabone stated
that the work was progressing steadily, though there was nothing remarkable to
report.
These particulars may be supplemented by two sketches furnished by Mr.
J. G. Turner and the Rev. John Pemell. “ The rapid growth of families in the
Hawkesbury River and the numerous converts on the Hunter and its tributaries,
the Paterson and the Williams Rivers,” said Mr. Turner, “developed among the
farmers the spirit of exploration and enterprise. The most convenient opening
at the time was the beautiful and fertile Manning River District, its embryo town-
ships being about no or 120 miles by horse track from the Hunter. During
those years (1853-4) Methodists from Bolwarra and the Lower Hunter, first pros-
pected, and then with their families swarmed over to various parts of the Manning
River. Several zealous Local Preachers and Leaders were in the exodus. They
quickly, on their own initiative, and in all possible ways, began to spread Spiritual
Holiness through the land. Up to that date no finer Methodist singing in Aus-
tralia had been known than that of the Bolwarra Methodists, nor were there
anywhere more devoted Preachers, Exhorters, and Leaders than the Brethren
Belford, Delves, Rhodes, and their associates. The Revs. W. A. Quick and J.
G. Turner were stationed at Maitland, in 1856.

TAREE CHURCH.
“At his first Quarterly Meeting the Superintendent found himself surrounded
by some thirty office-bearers, to each of whom the wants of the pioneers on the
Manning made strong appeal by their past fellowship and work. Mr. Quick,
though willing, felt himself physically unfit for the journey of 250 miles, mostly
over difficult country; his colleague, therefore, became his deputy to the Man-
ning. Visiting all day and preaching each night during ten days he was able
to take in a true Methodist prospect. A conference of the principal workers
was held at Glenthorne at midday in an open clearing. Steps were announced
for recommendation, places were selected for regular service, suggestions entered
and efforts made to obtain a Chapel site. On the Sabbath a fleet of river boats,

including a steam launch, brought the people to a beautiful home on the River
bank, where a Methodist family had kindly arranged their spacious drawing-
room for public worship. The principal places on the Manning at that time
occupied were I aree, Tinonee, and Wingham ; but the area for work outlined
comprised several other places more or less distant. To the credit of the resi-
dential pioneer Methodist workers, it must be noted that there were frequent
Gospel journeys taken to and from the Hastings River and along its branches
by bush track.
“Mr. Turner’s journey was repeated from Maitland the following year in the
company of the Rev. W. Clarke, then at Dungog, both Ministers doing a con-
siderable amount of work for the permanent interest of the Manning River
people. During those visits and for years after the non-Methodist districts
appreciated alike these occasional visits and those of the zealous Local
Preachers. During the tour, a week-evening service, arranged for by request in
a Presbyterian neighbourhood, was held in the local school-house. Daylight
fell just before the time for the lesson. Then three or four tall, gaunt, Cale-
donians solemnly rose, each producing a number of tallow candles for distribu-
tion, and as holders as many bottles. Then followed a sight as gladdening as
comic. The whole congregation of Scotch men and women, each with a copy
of the Word of God, and a light to see as well as hear what the young Minister
was reading in the third chapter of St. John’s Gospel! Their avidity was
intense, and they gradually felt the Preacher’s influence in his sermon on ‘ God
so loved the world.’ ”


The Rev. John Pemell writes: “In 1855 we were appointed to Singleton,
where I was the second Minister. Here there was a slab hut, but we built a
brick Church without debt. I visited many other places, Muswellbrook being
among the number, where I found one Methodist family, and re-opened the
Church. When leaving Singleton I was appointed to the Manning River Cir-
cuit, where the land boom was on, some having paid as much as Al5 P er acre -
The ground was so rich, that the settlers, who chiefly lived in tents or gunyahs,
■could not at first get a crop. The people had asked for an unmarried Minister ,
and when I was appointed I was met with a letter protesting against my appoint-
ment, as there was neither home, furniture, nor ground. We sailed on The
K'ing William the Fourth , the first steamer built in Sydney. My first home
was a building owned by a Local Preacher, partly furnished, without floors or
windows, in which we were allowed to place our bedding. In front of this
building was the river, and on one side a ditch, across which a fallen tree served
as a bridge. At low tide this ditch was a mass of mud and ooze. The water
from the river was brackish, and it was all we had to drink. My wife was
stricken down with malarial fever. The Chapel, which was on the other side of
the river at Taree, was built of slabs and hardwood floor, without ceiling, and
calico in lieu of windows. It measured 29ft. x 20ft., and was without a fireplace.
In desperation I went to Mr. Playford. I told him that, as the Chapel was
Methodist property and I a Methodist Minister, I was going to move into it to
save the life of my wife and children. They repaired the slabs, put up a par-
tition, built a fireplace with stones and bark, and carried our goods to the
Church by boat. Notwithstanding all our troubles, services were maintained.
Glenthorne was our principal place.
“ I had to get a boat built, which cost us £l5, and my removal to the Man-
ning cost £2O. My health was injured, as the climate was trying. At the
District Meeting in 1859 I stated my case, and a Minister was sent up, but no
good results came from his visit. During my second year I visited Port Mac-
quarie, forty miles further north. The Chapel had been closed for years. I
spent some time there, established services, got a Class together, and henceforth
paid a quarterly visit. I then went on further still to the Muggle River, opening
up some other places. I also visited Kempsey, two or three of us going on
horseback. We held a meeting in the barn, and several were converted. On
my return journey the Hastings and Camden Rivers were in flood. I had a
narrow escape. On my return home I found my family had gone to Sydney, as
I had been appointed to Pentridge. While holding the Quarterly Meeting we
heard that The Sampson had gone ashore. Mr. Crofton’s boat was manned,
and we proceeded with all haste to the Pilot Station. My wife and children had
an anxious time, and my books and effects were all ruined. We stayed at the
Pilot Station that night, and on the following day my wife went on in a small
sailing boat, and I went overland to Sydney.”

GOULBURN CHURCH.
GOULBURN DISTRICT.
The first official recognition of Goulburn and the surrounding district is
found in the District Minutes of 1842, where it figures as one of the “New
Stations ” recommended to the attention of the Committee. The Minutes
state ; “ Several gentlemen of property in the neighbourhood of these Towns
(Goulburn and Yass) have expressed their desire to have the advantage of the
labours of a Wesleyan Missionary among them. There is no doubt but the
appointment of a Brother to labour there would be attended with very great
good to that part of the Colony, and his entire support would, we have no doubt,
be fully realized in that neighbourhood. Indeed, the sum of £IOO per annum
is guaranteed by those residing in Goulburn.” Chief among these “ gentlemen ”
was Mr. Matthew Trenery, who has been regarded by some as the Father of
Methodism in Goulburn. He gave a slab building in Clifford Street, which was
repaired and fitted up as a place of worship, the Presbyterian Minister, Mr.
Hamilton, preaching the opening sermon by request. Associated with Air.
Trenery were Mr. John Wheatley and Mr. John Simpson, who both preached
in Mr. Bulmor’s house before Mr. Trenery’s gift of the slab hut, Mr. Wheatley
coming from Collector to conduct service. Soon after, Mr. Robert Blatchford
and Mr. Henry Goldsmith, both Local Preachers, settled at Goulburn, and a


Class was formed, meeting in the slab hut with Mr. John Lansdowne as Leader.
In 1846 the Rev. D. J. Draper paid a visit of inspection to Goulburn, choosing
the site in Goldsmith Street for the Mission, and in 1847 the Rev. William
Lightbody was appointed to the Circuit. The few Methodists at Collector
led on by Mr. John Wheatley, were holding services in the house of Mr. John
Sheridan, until they built a Chapel on land given by Mr. Wheatley, who also
subscribed most liberally.
In July of 1847 Mr. Lightbody thus reports to the District Meeting: “In
the town of Goulburn the work of God is progressing. During the year the
Class has increased in number from 5 to 22, including those now on trial for
membership. At Gunning a Class has been formed, which at present consists
of 10 full members and lon trial. Some of them have obtained the forgiveness
of their sins, and are now ‘ walking in the fear of God and in the comfort of the
Holy Ghost ’; whilst others are earnestly enquiring ‘ What they must do to be
saved ? ’ In Goulburn the congregation has so increased that the temporary
Chapel in which we preach is generally crowded with worshippers. Subscrip-
tions, amounting to near £2OO, have been promised towards a new Chapel, and
arrangements have been made for its erection. In different parts of the coun-
try, seven new places have been opened for preaching from 8 to 50 miles distant
from Goulburn, viz., Bangalore, Gunning, Bush Oak Park, Bindia, Richland, and
Bunnaby, in all of which places our Services are well attended, and pleasing
indications afforded us that the Spirit of God is working in the minds of the
people.” And Mr. Lightbody adds that the Government has also granted two
acres for a Chapel School House and Mission House on which they were then
about to build a brick Chapel 40ft. by 25ft. This Chapel was opened on
the 23rd April, IS4B, by the Rev. Mr. Harris of Sydney. Services were
conducted at 11, 3.30, and 6 o’clock, when the attendance was good. On
the following Monday a Public Tea, attended by 240 persons, was provided
in the new building. Addresses were afterwards delivered by Mr. Harris
and Mr. Lightbody, and Messrs. Trenery, Ba}dey and Saunderson. The
entire cost of the Chapel was towards which the opening ceremonies
brought One friend offered to put up the pulpit and ceiling, and to
plaster the building free of cost. At the end of the year the debt remain-
ing was £6O.
The congregations were now improving, though at that time there " was a
perceptible falling off owing to the uncomfortable state of the Chapel, in con-
sequence of the plasterers being at work.” There were three Classes, 44 mem-
bers had been admitted to the Society, 14 were on trial, and the members adorned
“ their profession by their holy living.” At Joraway, eight miles from Gunning,
“the Lord has commenced a gracious work.” At Brush’s Farm and Stans
Classes were formed, and at Collector there were 11 members and “ about thirty
or forty hearers.” At Oak Farm, Binda, and Bunnaby, “the power of the truth
has been felt, but we have not been able to form a Class at any of these places,
for want of a suitable person to take charge of it.” Queanbeyan reported “ a
Class of twelve persons, who seem to be alive to God. There is a good opening

for Methodism if embraced. In this town and district many are beginning to
see their lost estate. A few persons of influence have made liberal offers towards
the support of a Missionary for the next year, provided he be appointed to
reside among them.” Next year Mr. Lightbody recorded grants of land at Gun-
ning, Gundagai, Yass, Queanbeyan, and Bungendore, and gave a good report of
the progress of the work. “ The prejudices of many against Methodism are
vanishing, and the people are now coming out to hear the Word of Life, some
of whom have sought and found mercy, whilst others, though not seriously con-
verted, are partially reformed, and have a sense of the evil of sin, of their duty
to God, and a regard for the Christian Sabbath, to which they had formerly been
strangers. There are 14 different places in the Circuit where moral darkness
and destitution hitherto prevailed, which are now regularly supplied with preach-
ing.” At Gunning, “ Methodism is generally esteemed.” The new brick Chapel,
28ft. by 18ft., had been opened. The entire cost, £go, had been met. At
Queanbeyan several “ scoffers ” and “ professed enemies to Methodism ” had
begun to attend the services. Yass had now a Class “ lately formed, South-
well’s, Gundaroo, Old Collector, and Wheeo had regular services, while Bmdia
had “ a Chapel large enough to contain 100 persons,” with a congregation of
50 or 60.
Mr. Lightbody gave place to Rev. James Somerville, Assistant Missionary,
in 1850. Mr. Somerville wrote that “the work of the Lord is steadily improv-
ing.” Mr. Somerville was in charge one year only, being succeeded by the
Rev. William Schofield. Mr. Schofield said that many “have recently left the
town and country parts of the Circuit in search of gold. Yet we have to thank
God for the good that does even now appear, in the increase of members, and

the manifest spirit of liberality, by which a debt of about £8 left on the Circuit
last year has been paid— £2s upon Goulburn Chapel, and a few pounds upon
Gunning Chapel-keeper’s House; the Class and Ticket Money are in advance
of last year; also above twice the amount has been contributed to the Mission
Fund—so that if an increase to our Church and an augmentation of our funds
afford any evidence of spiritual growth we have it.” The next year (1852) the
Rev. William S. Byrnes tells of the havoc wrought by the rush to the goldfields.
“ The discovery of gold and the dissipation of mind which it has induced have
seriously injured the work in this Circuit. Some have fallen away; and more
have been deeply injured.” Through removals to other parts of the Colony
some congregations have been broken up, and others are very small. In the
year 1853 a two-roomed brick cottage had taken the place of the old slab hut
in which the Chapel-keeper lived. It had cost £73, and was free from debt.
Jerriwa was “preparing to erect a brick Chapel forthwith.” But when it was
erected the bricks had given place to slabs, at the cost of £l2O. Braidwood
was following the example with a brick or stone building, and Moruya, or Gun-
dary as it was called, had received a grant of land, on which in the year 1854 a
weatherboard Chapel was built. The year 1854 witnessed the erection of a
Mission House at Goulburn, towards which the people had contributed £l,lOO,
and the Chapel Committee had given £3OO. The same year Mundanoon and
Braidwood erected a Chapel, the slab building at the former place costing £25
only.
It would be impossible to think of early Methodism in this District apart
from Mr. Tom Brown, or “ Old Tom Brown,” as he was familiarly called in his
later days. Tom Brown was no ordinary man. An Englishman by birth, a
prize-fighter by profession, standing over six feet in height, without educational
advantages in his youth, he was a diamond in the rough. But he was a diamond,
and being taught by the Holy Spirit he developed wonderful gifts and graces
which were all consecrated to the service of God. After his conversion he came
to Australia settling on a farm near Camden. In those days there stood between

CHURCH AND SCHOOLROOM.
Wagga.
Luddenham and Camden, at the foot of the “ stony ridge,” a Methodist Chapel
built of split slabs, roofed with bark and rough stools for seats. Here Tom
Brown and his brother Bill, Silas Gill, the Wheatleys, and the Roots Brothers,
both Local Preachers, met frequently in prayer and at Camp Meetings, the
Camp Meetings being held in Bill Brown’s paddock, near the Chapel, under a
large bush-apple tree. Silas Gill was a great singer, and Tom Brown was
mighty in prayer. And it was a question often discussed but never satisfactorily
decided: Which was the louder, Silas in song, or Tom in prayer. On one
occasion, when asked to pray in this little Chapel, Tom Brown carefully spread
his large-coloured handkerchief on the floor, and then, straightening himself
with uplifted face, he said aloud: “Now for a blessing.” He was mighty in
prevailing prayer. While kneeling at a long form crying for mercy a number
of penitents have been set at liberty as he prayed. It was retailed as a very
choice morsel among the unbelievers that one of these early Methodists worship-
ing in the little Chapel near Camden had felt the pinch of poverty, from which
he had been relieved in some measure by a previous flood which had deposited
a plentiful supply of his neighbour’s pumpkins on his property. But the last
pumpkin had been eaten, grinding poverty was again a prospective reality, and


therefore out of the fulness of his heart he prayed: “ Lord send us another flood,
and more punkins." Among the cases of conversion here was that of a shoe-
maker who had lived a wild life, but under Methodist preaching was convicted
of sin. Having previously attended the Church of England services he went
to the Clergyman who told him that he was out of health and needed a tonic.
The Local Preachers supplied “ the tonic ” by sending him to Jesus, Who healed
his sin-sick soul. At a meeting held some time after, when the same Clergy-
man was in the chair, this man rose and said: “I thank God that the Methodists
ever came here. I was in great trouble about my soul, and I came to you, Sir,
and you administered carnal physic to a sin-sick soul; but I went to the Local
Preachers and they led me to the Saviour, and I found mercy.”
Tom Brown afterwards removed to Jerriwa Creek, about thirty miles from
Goulburn, where he settled prosperously on a farm, his temporal circumstances
being greatly improved. Jerriwa Creek was then widely, but unfavourably,
known as the abode of cattle stealers. He went amongst them interceding for
Christ and preaching the Gospel. In a few years the condition of things was
entirely changed, some of the ring-leaders in sin becoming earnest Christians.
A Church of seventy members was formed and a good brick Chapel erected.
Such was his generosity that he mortgaged his farm to pay off the debt on one
of the Chapels in the District. It was a pleasure indeed, says the Rev. John
Watsford, “to labour among the people, and the good work was chiefly the
result of Tom Brown’s labours. He was the hardest working Local Preacher I
have ever known. Sometimes he would travel forty miles on the Saturday,
preach in three different places on the Sunday, and then travel forty miles home
on the Monday.” —(Glorious Gospel Triumphs , p. 122.) His sermons and
speeches were always good, and as a platform speaker he was very popular.
His alternation of the terrible with the tender in his preaching as he denounced
sin was very effective. The use of these denunciations he humourously des-
cribed as the shaking of his “ brimstone bag.” Hundreds, if not thousands, were
converted under his preaching, and the remarkable figure with the green shade
over one eye covering the result of a fall which he received when he missed an
appointment—a solitary instance —was welcomed everywhere. His lack of educa-
tion was more than counterbalanced by his remarkable spiritual power, his
transparent consistency and his deep piety. He died as he had lived—an
earnest Christian, February 16th, 1871, the Rev. W. H. Pincombe conducting his
funeral sermon.
Around the memory of such a man there gather many stories, based on
fact, but coloured by fiction. Among those authenticated, space can be found
for a few only. Brown once told Mr. Watsford that when a prize-fighter he
struck his opponent in the ribs and broke one of them ; and, said he, “ I tell
you I did feel, and I said in my heart, ‘ Lord have mercy on me.’ ” Speaking
one day on the different ways in which the enemy tries the Christian, he said:
“ One day, the champion prize-fighter was passing by me, and without a
moment’s thought I said to myself: ‘ I think, my fine fellow, I could polish you
off in a few minutes! ’ ” This type of muscular Christianity doubtless had


weight with the cattle-stealers of Jerriwa Vale. His addresses on Missionary
work were powerful and attractive, though often marked by humorous incidents.
For example, when speaking of the heathen he called them “ Hopnitops,” a
blunder which the reporters could not resist circulating. But next time Tom
spoke he said: “ Now you reporters there, don’t you go and put it “ Hopnitops ”
to-night, but Hottentots ; that’s the right way to speak the word.” In preach-
ing, his whole body was in motion, his long arm stretched out or lifted high and
coming down with tremendous force. When giving a Missionary address on
one occasion he stood on the floor of the Chapel near a form, on the end of
which was seated a man named Holgate, who was spell-bound by his rugged
eloquence. Tom was speaking of the glorious Gospel carried the wide world
round and winning the millions of dying heathen for Christ; and suiting the
action to the word he swung his long, strong arm round and round until he
struck Holgate on the head, bringing him to the ground. Rising rapidly and
looking earnestly at the speaker he said: “All right, Tom; I should not have
cared if you had knocked my head off, if it would have sent the Gospel round
the world!” The following letter, written to the Rev. John Watsford in
October, 1858, will further reveal this man’s character:—
“ Rev. Dear Sir, —
“You may be surprised that I should write to you so soon after your return,
but Glory be to God ! I write to tell you that Wilson has got his soul made happy
this day. God broke his hard heart that night under the sermon, and he was
in awful distress ;he was like a madman till God set his soul at liberty. Glory
be to Jesus! Now, Sir, we had hard work that night with the powers of dark-
ness ; but our Jesus hath stirred up His power and hath bruised Satan’s head
this night. We had three of our young people at the Chapel this night who
had lost the witness. Charles Ginn is one of them, and of all that I ever saw
that beat all. Isaac Butts was a wonderful struggle, but this of Charles far
exceeded it, for it took nine or ten persons to hold him for fifteen or twenty
minutes. Then the Lord cast out the fiend and made him happy. Glory be to
Jesus! We had one at the penitent form at the time, and it seemed as if
Satan, when cast out of Ginn, entered the other, for he fell and had a great
struggle ; so the Lord restored all three of them again. Glory be to His dear
name for ever! Our people are all on fire for Jesus to take the kingdoms for
His own. I shall feel thankful to you if you will write me a few lines after your
Mission tour.
“ I remain,
“Yours affectionately,
“Poor Old Tom Brown.”
Silas Gill, another of this famous group which first settled at Camden, was
born in Sussex in 1807, being familiar with services from his infancy, and
being brought to God through the ministry of the Rev. Thomas Collins. Marry-
ing in 1825, he emigrated to New South Wales in 1838, shortly after settling
at Cowpastures, or Camden, as it is now called. While here he has been
known to attend the meetings at Quarry Grove, sixteen miles distant, carrying
his child in his arms, arriving home between two and three o’clock in the

morning. In the year 1845 he removed to Woodville on the Hunter River,
and with the assistance of his brother, William Gill, opened a prayer meeting
in William’s house, followed by meetings in other houses, and eventually
extending to the William’s River. Here the Rev. h. Lewis was invited to visit
them, making his quarterly visitation in a barn belonging to Mr. William Lee.
Two Classes were formed under the leadership of the two brothers. They also
went to Seaham and Wallalong, where Chapels were erected. Accompanied
by Mr. Boltwood in 1857, Silas Gill removed to the Hastings River. At that
time Port Macquarie Chapel was closed; but Silas set to work, travelling for
hours on foot, and returning with half a dozen persons he would commence
praying and preaching at some camp on the way. One night each week' was
devoted to the instruction of his family. He began the Mission at the Hastings
River in a private house, and afterwards at Mr. Kerr’s residence, where service
was held for many years. Then he felt himself called to labour at the Macleay
River, to which place he removed, continuing to preach till his death. He
took the service at Frederickton on September sth. On the following Mon-
day he complained of cold, and died on Friday, September 10th, 1876, his
funeral taking place two days afterwards, when his body was carried by the
Church officers, and an address was delivered by the Rev. H. Wiles.
John Wheatley, yet another- of this noble band, was born at Ashdowne
Forest, England, 19th of April, 1792. When twenty years of age, he heard Dr.
Adam Clarke preach, and the sermon made such an impression that he at once
met in Class, and began to preach in the towns and villages around. It was
under his preaching that Tom Brown was brought to Christ. In the year
1838, with his wife and family, he emigrated to New South Wales, residing
for a short time in Parramatta, afterwards settling near Camden. Thence he
removed to the Coulburn District, where he exerted his influence to extend
Methodism, and became associated with its beginnings in Coulburn, Yass ;
Queanbeyan, and Gunning. His service for Christ was marked by untiring zeal.
He frequently walked from Collector to Coulburn, a distance of twenty-two
miles. He was a liberal giver to Foreign Missions and to all other organisa-
tions of the Church. He passed away in “ the sere and yellow leaf ”at the age
of 80, leaving behind him a memory which will not soon be allowed to die.

THE REV. JOHN MCKENNY.
Third Superintendent of Missions.


CHAPTER X.
THE REV. JOHN McKENNY’S SUPERIN-
TENDENCE
THE Rev. John McKenny succeeded Mr. Orton as Superintendent
in New South Wales, Mr. Orton’s presence being required by
the Committee in London to afford information in connec-
tion with the various developments of the work. Mr.
McKenny was an Irishman by birth, being born at Coleraine in
1788. Shortly before his birth John Wesley visited his fathers’ house, and
earnestly prayed that the child yet unborn might be consecrated to God from
his birth. Converted early in life under the ministry of the Rev. William
Ferguson he joined the Wesleyan Society, and when between eighteen and
nineteen commenced calling sinners to repentance. Placed on the President’s
list of Reserve when only twenty years of age, Dr. Coke selected him in 1813
as one of the noble band of devoted men to carry the Gospel to India and the
Cape of Good Hope. John McKenny was the first Wesleyan Missionary to
Africa, and for two years he laboured in Cape Town, when, owing to the
illiberal policy of the Colonial Government, he was silenced for a time from
public preaching. But this could not silence him elsewhere. In hiding-places,
partly underground, to a chosen band of converts, consisting chiefly of pious
soldiers, he proclaimed the love of Christ. In 1816 he sailed for Ceylon, where
he laboured with prudence and zeal for twenty years. There success crowned
his efforts, and he generally left behind him a good Chapel and School Houses.
His health failing, in 1834, his medical advisers ordered him to England, where
he arrived in 1835, and was appointed by the Conference of that year as Chair-
man of the New South Wales Mission. In the latter part of the same year, with
his wife and family, he was again on the water, his companions being the Revs.
William A. Brookes, John Spinney, Daniel Draper, and Matthew Wilson, with
their wives, and Frederick Lewis.
Embarking in The Bencoolen on the 15th October, they were accompanied
down the river by Dr. Bunting and the Rev. J. Beecham. In a memorable
prayer of remarkable power Dr. Bunting commended them to God , and in
course of conversation remarked: “You are going to New South Wales. A
new world, and a most interesting field of labour. You will find a moral atmos -
phere unfavourable to the success of the Gospel Ministry, \ears may pass
before you witness any decided fruit to your labours, and I think it probable
you will meet with many discouragements. However, success is certain. It


must come! It must come!” Ihe voyage to Hobart Town occupied 132 days,
the party arriving on the 22nd of February, 1836. They proceeded at once to
the old School Room in Melville Street, where a prayer-meeting was being
held. After their detention of five weeks, in which they received many gracious
visitations from on high, they set sail for Sydney, where they arrived on Sunday,
3rd of April, after a most perilous voyage ; and were just in time to hear
Nathaniel I urner preach his farewell sermon in Macquarie Street Chapel prior
to his second appointment to the New Zealand Mission. The Sacramental
Service followed, and proved to be a bond of love in that service of Missionary
farewell and Missionary welcome.
Mr. McKenny at once took up the work his predecessor had left to his
care. In his first District Meeting Report he said that the past year had been
one of severe trial and painful anxiety to the Missionaries who had recently
arrived. New to the place and people they found the spirit of faction among
the residents which threatened to make its appearance in the members of the
Society. The Chapels as a rule were well attended, the services crowned with
blessing, and there had been instances of sound conversion. He set himself
the task of improving the Mission properties. The Mission House in Sydney
being in a decayed state, it was absolutely necessary that it should be put
into proper repair; one wing was therefore taken down and rebuilt, providing a
home for the “ Brethren coming to Sydney, either from England, the Islands, or
the country Stations in the Colony.” Princes Street Chapel was also length-
ened 24 feet and renovated without extra expense to the funds; and during the
year 1837 extensive repairs were made to Macquarie Street Chapel. A new
gallery was erected, the ceiling removed, and " sundry important repairs com-
pleted,” at a cost of £2lO, which amount was met by private subscriptions and
collections. At the next District Meeting the Chairman was requested to
take immediate steps to have the Model Deed registered in the Supreme Court,
the expenses to meet such registration being raised “ among the friends in
their respective Circuits.” At this meeting he was able to announce the re-
ceipt from the Government of the deeds of grant of the Mission property in
Princes Street, for which a charge of £5 sterling had been made.
Mr. McKenny also sought to remove, or mitigate the disabilities under
which the Wesleyans laboured. To the District Meeting (January, 1838) he
reported that by the assistance of legal friends in Sydney he had prepared such
an alteration in the new “ Church Act ” as would place the Wesleyan body on a
footing with the other denominations. He presented a copy of these alterations
to the Governor, requesting him to introduce them into the Legislative Council
with a view to their adoption. This the Governor refused to do, stating as
the ground of his objection that the assistance sought could be granted without
any alteration in the law, as the advances made to the Mission by the Colonial
Government could be charged in the Supplementary Estimates.
To this proposal the District Meeting very properly objected, setting forth
its demurrer in the following terms: —“We conceive from the information we
have been able to collect that it is the intention of Her Majesty’s Government
that all denominations of Christians in this Colony should stand on equal


ground ; and as the plan proposed by the Colonial Government for our assis-
tance will be attended with great uncertainty, being subject to the will of the
Governor for the time being, we consider it our duty to press our claim to all
the advantages and privileges intended by the Home Government. The Dis-
trict, therefore, instructs the Chairman to renew his application as soon as may
be after the arrival of the new Governor for such an alteration in the late Act
of Council ‘ for the building of Churches, Chapels, and Ministers’ dwelling-
houses, and for the support of Ministers ’ as will fully meet our case, and place
us on an equality with the other Denominations in whose favour an alteration
has been made in the Act referred to.” —(District Minutes , 1838.)
The question of the celebration of marriages by the Missionaries also de-
manded attention, and as the members of the District Meeting claimed to exer-
cise their right to celebrate marriages it was thought advisable to define the
method of procedure. The District Meeting (1838) therefore resolved:—
“ 1. That the Church of England Service shall be the form used, the Brethren
being at liberty to use extempore prayer, and to give such advice to the parties
as may appear suitable at the time. 2. That in all cases where licences are not
obtained, the publication of Banns shall be made on each of three successive
Sundays, during the celebration of Divine Worship. 3. That a Register shall
be carefully kept in each Circuit, and copies of all entries made therein shall
be brought to the Annual District Meeting to be entered in the General Re-
gister to be kept in the Mission House. 4. That the fee of ten shillings shall
be paid on all marriages, which shall be placed to the credit of the Circuit in
which the marriage shall be celebrated. 5. That in all places where there is a
Chapel, the ceremony shall be performed therein and not in private houses.
6. That these Resolutions shall be made public through the medium of the
Colonial Newspapers.”
But soon after, the District Meeting (1839) resolved that “henceforth mar-
riages be solemnised amongst us by licence as well as banns, whenever re-
quired.” It was soon required, for the Rev. D. J. Draper had presented to him
the following Licence: —“ Whereas William Moore, of Church Street, Parra-
matta, Bachelor, and Elizabeth Watsford, of Church Street, Parramatta, Spins-
ter, are desirous of entering into the holy estate of matrimony ; and the said
William Moore hath appeared before one of Her Majesty’s Justices of the
Peace for this Colony, and made affidavit that they are both unmarried and
above twenty-one years of age, and that there is no impediment arising from
consanguinity, precontract, or otherwise ; this is to authorise you to solemnise a
marriage between the said parties without the publication of banns. Provided
that if it shall appear that there is any such impediment existing at this pre-
sent time, this writing shall be null and void.”
Another question of some interest, though relatively not of great impor-
tance, dealt with by Mr. McKenny and his brother Missionaries, was the
numerical returns of the Church. The District Meeting (1845) resolved that
as another census was to be taken during the coming year, “ and as we have
every reason to believe that the last census was very defective as a return of the
number of Wesleyans in this Colony, in consequence of which our interests.

were seriously injured ; we resolved that to prevent as far as possible a similar
occurrence, a circular shall be prepared by the Secretary to be signed by the
Chairman and himself, which shall be printed and distributed as widely as
possible among the members of our Societies and Congregations.” Mr. Draper,
who was then Secretary, prepared and presented to that District Meeting the
returns.
English Methodism, after much discussion in the periodicals on both sides
of the Atlantic, and on the suggestion of Butterworth, “ whose large soul had
comprehended its extraordinary Mission, and whose large means had been
lavished upon its great schemes,” resolved to celebrate its Centenary, and to
commemorate it in the year 1839. The hundredth year of Wesley’s ordination
was first proposed as a suitable occasion, but eventually the organisation of the
“ United Society” at the old Foundry in London was considered preferable.
For it was in that year the Methodist movement may have said to have begun.
It was in that year the “ Pentecostal” Lovefeast was held at Fetter Lane, and
four days later that seven despised Methodists met in Conference. It was in
that year that Whitefield and Wesley both first preached in the open air; that
Wesley formed the first Band at Bristol, that he laid the corner stone of the
first Chapel built by his people, and that he and his brother Charles issued the
first volume of Hymns. The Conference of 1837 appointed a Committee to
devise a plan for the celebration, the primary object of which should be “ the
religious and devotional improvement of the Centenary,” and the raising of “ a
pecuniary contribution.” A day for united prayer was appointed in January,
1839; Thomas Jackson, then President, was to preach a “Centenary Sermon,”
and prepare a Centenary volume, showing the progress of Methodism. And a
day in the month of October was to be devoted to religious services in every
Chapel throughout the Connexion.*
The celebrations were successfully held, many of the public Meetings
being marked by great enthusiasm, and a sum totalling £2 16,000 was raised,
the amount being apportioned thus: First, the Theological Fund for the erec-
tion of two new buildings and the general purposes of the Institution ; second,
Centenary premises and various other Missionary purposes; third, the pur-
chase of a “ Missionary Polynesian Ship ” and the expenses of her outfit:
fourth, the Chapel Loan Funds in England and Ireland; fifth, Kinsgwood and
Woodhouse Grove Schools debt; sixth, the Auxiliary Fund. In addition to
these allocations two special grants were made by the Centenary Committee,
viz.:—£5,000 for a Centenary Monumental Chapel in Dublin, and £5,000 to
the Wesleyan Education Committee for their Day Schools.
As local interest attaches to the purchase of the Missionary ship it may
not be out of place to enumerate a few particulars. In the early part of 1839
the Missionary Committee purchased The Triton , of 120 tons burden, to be
employed exclusively under their direction. “ She has been examined by com-
petent persons,” said the Committee, “ and pronounced in all respects suitable
to the service which shall be required of her, in conveying Missionaries and

stores between the Colonies of New South Wales and Van Dieman’s Land,
and the Friendly Islands, New Zealand, the Fejees, and other groups and
Islands of the Great South Pacific Ocean. It is expected that advantage will
be taken of this opportunity to send a reinforcement of Missionaries to the
several stations in that part of the world, as well as a large supply of goods of
all kinds, for the use of Missions.” An appeal was therefore made for goods,
and the Missionary Committee told its friends that the following articles would
be acceptable:—A pinnace, ready to be built on arrival at the Friendly Islands,
to act as companion to The Triton-, ship’s tackling, suitable for the ship or
smaller craft; sea stores ; a tent, or marquee, for use on distant stations ; furni-
ture, including earthenware, tinware, and ironmongery; clothing of all descrip-
tions ; medicine and surgical instruments; bells for Alission Chapels and
Schools ; and stationery. The appeal was liberally responded to.
On the morning of the 14th September, 1839, The Triton was ready for
her trip, as she lay in the harbour at Bristol. A valedictory service had been
conducted the previous evening by the President, the Rev. Theophilus Lessey,
at which the Alissionaries about to leave were commended to God in prayer.
The commencement of the voyage was marked by religious exercises. First,
the infant child of Airs. Beatty, the Captain’s wife, born on board, was baptised
by Dr. Bunting, who afterwards gave out the hymn,
“Blest be the dear uniting love,
That will not let us part.”
Then he and the Revs. J. Beecham and E. Hoole engaged in prayer. “It was
a solemn and affecting season, and every heart responded to the sentiment,
‘lt is good for us to be here!’ ” The steward, Thomas Ingledew, evidently had
an eye to the fitness of things ; _ for, producing his Missionary box with the
remark that he had been among the heathen and could testify that they needed
the Gospel, he added that the Committee wanted £IOO,OOO that year, and they
“ should all lend a hand.” He received subscriptions from all present, handing
over to the General Secretaries a handsome sum. The Triton now sailed away
on her errand of peace. Comfortably fitted up, thanks to Air. Irving, she set
sail with two large flags floating in the breeze —one having the Union Jack
in the corner, and for a motto, “ Glory to God in the Highest ” ; and the second
bearing the inscriptions: “The Wesleyan Missionary Society’s Centenary
Ship, A.D. 1839,” and “ The best of all is, God is with us.” Unfavourable winds
compelled her to seek temporary shelter in Alilford Haven. From Milford
Haven to Madeira heavy gales were experienced, in which she lost her stern
boat. But the party was all well and in good spirits, and in due time they ar-
rived at their desired haven.
It was natural that the Alethodists of New South Wales should follow the
splendid example of their Brethren in England, and they seized this oppor-
tunity to bring to a happy issue the scheme for building a Chapel in a central
spot, which circumstances had forced upon them. At the District Aleeting of
1834 it was stated that “the very ineligible situation of Macquarie Street
Chapel, being exceedingly detrimental to our cause in this town, it is deemed
indispensably necessary that endeavours be made forthwith to dispose of the


said Chapel to the best advantage ; and to erect a commodious one in a more
central part of the town.” “It is the universal opinion of our friends,” pro-
ceeds the Minutes, “ with which we fully coincide, that the erection of a com-
modious place of worship in an eligible part of the town, will tend materially
to the advantage of our cause. And by the anticipated assistance of the Com-
mittee, the Trustees will be placed above circumstances of embarrassment.”
The “ anticipated assistance ” was the use, as a loan, of the New South Wales
Auxiliary Funds for four years, a request originating with the Quarterly Meet-
ing. The Chairman also supported this appeal. “ Could the Committee view
the circumstances of the case as presented to those of us who are on the
spot,” he writes, “ I am fully persuaded they would yield to the point that
such a measure is indispensable to the prosperity of our cause.” As proof of
their sincerity, “ the following handsome subscriptions, with the promise of
additional aid as circumstances may require,” were already announced: —Messrs.
S. Terry, Tioo; J. Street, TSO; L. Iredale, TSO; J. Blanch, £25 ; and several
other smaller sums. The Trustees, Leaders, and Stewards also forwarded a
Memorial to the Committee through the Chairman, in which they recapitulated
what had already been advanced with one striking addition. Macquarie Street
Chapel “ is quite out of the town, which is extending in an opposite direction,”
a fact which had “ completely disheartened the friends ” from making those
exertions they were “ heartily disposed to do.” Ihe memorial bears the sig-
natures of the three Missionaries; Joseph Orton, W. Schofield, and W. Simp-
son, and Messrs. George Smith, Matthew Lasseter, James Blanch, J. Hamilton,
Lancelot Iredale, john Jones, R. Mansfield, George Allen, William Piper, John
J. M. Weiss, Mark Blanchard, John Terry Hughes, Thos. Street, John Hosking,
and Henry Thomas.
On June 18th, 1839, a Special District Meeting was held, the Revs. J.
McKenny, W. Schofield, J. Watkins, D. J. Draper, and S. Wilkinson being pre-
sent, when the Centenary Celebrations were considered, and it was decided
that no time should be lost in procuring a “ suitable site for the erection of a
large W’esleyan Chapel, to be monumental in this Colony of the Centenary of
Methodism,” and that meetings and services should be conducted “ on a simi-
lar plan to the meetings held in England.” Efforts were now made to dispose
of Macquarie Street Chapel property, and the request for a loan was renewed,
as the Governor, who had been interviewed by Mr. McKenny, promised to pro-
mote their views as far as possible. But the way did not open rapidly. It was
difficult to dispose advantageously of the old Chapel and equally
difficult to secure a suitable site for the new one. Both difficulties were eventu-
ally removed. Mr. Iredale secured the Macquarie Street property for T3TOO,
“to be paid by him as required for the building of the New Chapel ; 1 and
IMr John Orton, son of the Rev. Joseph Orton, tells the following story in connec-
tion with the Macquarie Street Chapel; —“ 1 well remember when my father came home
from Macquarie Street Chapel on one occasion he expressed himself thus; 1 could not
get on well at all to-day. The old Rope was looking at me all the time!’ By some mis-
adventure the Roman Catholics had become possessed of two organs, and offered to sell
one to the Wesleyans. My father was averse to having any dealings with the Romanists,
but the Trustees got possession of it, and placed it in the Chapel. It was a high, massive,
elegant, and powerful instrument with a figure on the top, either the Pope cm some bamt.
This figure disturbed my father’s peace of mind so much that it wms cut off.

the Trustees on the gth ]uly resolved to purchase from Mr. William Hutchin-
son the present site in York Street, Messrs. Iredale, Peacock, Street, Hebble-
white, and Jones being deputed to carry out negotiations, while Mr. George
Allen was requested to examine the title. On the 29th August of the same
year, plans, measuring in the outside dimensions Soft, by 65ft, and prepared
gratuitously by Mr. Josiah Atwood, were passed. In October, Mr. Floods tender
for £4,950 was accepted, and early the next year a Government grant of £I,OOO
in aid of the erection was received.
Thus all promised well, and it appeared as if the Centenary Chapel,
though a little late in making its appearance, would soon be complete. Ihe
Rev. John McKenny and the Preachers of the District were to lay the founda-
tion stones when the set time arrived. Meanwhile, building material and wages
suddenly advanced, and Mr. Flood informed the Trustees that in consequence
he intended to discontinue the building. The Trustees sought legal advice
from Mr. a’Beckett and the Attorney-General, through Mr. George Allen, with
a view to holding Mr. Flood to his contract. But as this could not be done, re-
lief was found in an offer from Mr. J. J. Hughes to complete the building for
the sum of £6,000, the final expenditure exceeding this sum by some hundreds.
This offer was accepted, and the Trustees purchased land from Mr. Hutchinson
for a Mission House near the Chapel, receiving a subscription from him at the
same time.
The foundation stones were laid on February 26th, 1840, at one o clock.
The Rev. F. Lewis commenced the service by giving out the hymn,
“ Thou who had in Sion laid
The sure foundation stone. ”
afterwards engaging in prayer. The Rev. J. McKenny gave a short address,
and in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, declaied the
stone well and truly laid. William Schofield followed with a second address,
and Daniel 1. Draper announced another hymn, concluding with prayer. The
heat was oppressive, the concourse large, and the feeling good. The following
inscription was inserted; —“The Foundation Stone of the Wesleyan Centenary
Chapel, York Street, Sydney, was laid by the Rev. John McKenny, Chairman
of the Australian District Committee, Monday, 24th February, in the year of
our Lord, 1840, and in the 3rd year of the reign of our Sovereign Lady, Queen
Victoria, His Excellency Sir George Gipps, Knight, Governor of the Colony.
The Rev. Theophilus Lessey, President of the British Conference, the Rev.
Dr. Bunting, John Beecham, Robert Alder, and Elijah Hoole, oecietanes to
the Wesleyan Missionary Society, and the Rev. John Waterhouse, General
Superintendent of Wesleyan Missions in Australia and Polynesia. The Tius-
tees were Messrs. Bowden, Weiss, Jones, J. Wfi Jones, Munce, Iredale, Cald-
well, Coates, Inder, J. Byrnes, J. W. Brown, and J. Greer. This event was made
still more interesting by the arrival, that morning, of additional Missionaries —
Messrs. Henry H. Gaud, F. Sweetman, and Jonathan Innes —who witnessed the
ceremony, and in the evening assisted at the Anniversary of the Missionary
Society, held in Macquarie Street Chapel, under the presidency of Alex. McLeay,
Esq. For some unknown reason Mr. Plughes failed to carry out, or even to


commence, his contract, and the I rustees, in despair, took possession, appoint-
ing Messrs. Bowden, Atwood, and Munce a sub-committee to supervise the
work. The brickwork was completed in 1842, and the following year Jacob
Juder s tender for the completion of the building, without galleries, was ac-
cepted, and in February 14th, 1844, the Centenary Chapel was opened.
But now, to retrace our steps to get back to the public celebration of the
v entenary under the presidency of the Rev. J. McKenny. A public meet-
ing was held in Macquarie Street Chapel, Thursday evening, July 25th, 1839,
v len the assembly, says Joseph Orton, “was large and respectable, and the
sernces on the occasion were conducted with spirit and considerable interest.”
ie subscriptions amounted to £ 1,150, and it was resolved that the amount
t ius collected should be appropriated to the erection of the Centenary Chapel,
f such an unauthorised appropriation of funds” Mr. Orton did not approve.
I view it, he said, “as a violation of principle and Connexional faith, to apply
the funds raised without the sanction of the authorised body, the Centenary
Committee. But evidently the donors were not with Mr. Orton in this view,
for he appears to have been the only one to take exception to the course
adopted.
On Sunday, October 13th, Centenary sermons were preached in all the
Chapels throughout the District. In the morning the Rev. D. J. Draper spoke
at Macquarie Street from the words: “ And daily in the temple, and in every
house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ.”—(Acts v., 42 v.)
In the course of his sermon he referred to the circumstances, operations, and
success of the \\ esleyan Ministry. At night, in the same place, the Rev. J.
Aat kin preached a characteristic sermon, “ in which many good things were
said from the words: “Concerning this sect we know that everywhere it is
spoken against. (Acts 28, 22 v.) But the greatest event of all, at least in
the eyes of the children, took place on the following Monday; and as Joseph
Orton, who was an eye witness, has graphically described it, we cannot do bet-
ter than quote his words:—
The festivities of the Centenary were observed this day (Monday, 14th
October, 1839), which has been looked forward to with expectations of delight.
At an early hour the children of the respective Sunday Schools in the Circuit
were in active and cheerful operation, thronging the doors long before the ap-
pointed time of meeting. They marched off in procession, with their banners
flying, with inscriptions on them, betokening the respective schools of the
Union , and after taking their rounds, they met at Macquarie Street Chapel
yard some time after 11 o clock. hhe children, with many others, assembled in
the Chapel to listen to an address delivered by the Rev. J. McKenny from the
subject of young Samuel, which interesting service was concluded by the Rev.
Nathaniel Turner with prayer. The children were then sumptuously regaled
in the yard with plum cake, ginger beer, oranges, buns, etc.,—hilarity beaming
from every countenance, and exhibiting itself by a thousand playful tricks, for
the allowance of which a license seemed to have been given. Though the pro-
bability is that none of these children will witness a similar occasion, yet they
will talk of it to their children and children’s children through succeeding


generations, until the period shall arrive when an accumulated progeny will
have the happiness of celebrating the Anniversary of the Centenary of Metho-
dism, I have no doubt under circumstances, even much more auspicious than
those which we are this day called to contemplate with such delightful feelings
of gratitude to that God who has raised up and called us to associate with a
people so highly favoured of the Lord.
“ At five o’clock a large and respectable party assembled for the purpose
of taking tea together. Very much credit is due to the persons, particularly
the ladies, for the provisional arrangements for the occasion. All was orderly,
there was a plentiful supply of food and attendants, every countenance beamed
with joy and happiness, nor am I aware that there was one jarring chord ; as
every one seemed harmoniously to join in symphonious notes of gladness and
praise. At seven o’clock a numerous assemblage of persons met in the Chapel,
according to arrangements made, for the purpose of allowing anyone an oppor-
tunity of stating their views on the subject of the Centenary who might feel
disposed. The conduct of the meeting devolved upon Mr. McKenny, and as
only a few others could be induced to speak, we were obliged to take the prin-
cipal part in the meeting. The addresses were pious in their strain and very
interesting. A very blessed unction manifestly pervaded the assembly, and,
according to the best information, all were gratified ; and those connected with
us appeared to be more enamoured of Methodism than ever. I have had some
fanciful thoughts as to whether our venerable Founder can in any sense partici-
pate in the sacred joys of this notable period and stage of a cause which, under
God, he was so distinguished an instrument in commencing. O, what a numer-
ous train of children directly and collaterally will he have when the glorified
family of heaven be made up ! ” —(_ Journal s.)
The Revs. J. McKenny and F. Sweetman preached the first sermons in the
New Chapel, but the official sermon was preached by the Rev. Walter Lawry,
who had then returned to Polynesia as General Superintendent of Missions.
He took for his text Ezekiel xxxiv., 26 v. Popery was then putting forth
strenuous efforts to capture the young life of this new land, .and Mr. Lawry,
during his sermon could not resist a reference to it. Speaking of the holy hill
and the stability and permanency of the Church he said: “ But at the glorious
Reformation, Protestantism arose in all its strength, and smote the whore of
Babylon in its mouth, and, I was going to say, knocked the teeth down her
throat.” Miss Allen presided at the organ. The Rev. D. J. Draper, who was
then in charge of Sydney Circuit, described the building thus. The size is 74ft-
by 54ft. in the clear, and without the galleries, which have not yet been erected,
will comfortably accommodate 700 persons. The whole piemises are settled on
the provisions of the Model Deed, and the financial state of the Trust, although
at present not exactly defined, is considered to be such as to inspire the utmost
confidence as to future prosperity. The congregations are exceedingly good,
and from our hearts we thank God for the completion of this noble edifice for
His worship and service.” The building of this Chapel affected Methodism in
the city, for the congregations doubled, the Missionaries sphere of operations
was greatly enlarged, while “the ordinances of religion have been attended

with a rich effusion of the Holy Spirit, and have been channels of mercy to
many souls. Several new Classes have been formed, which are well attended
by the members. Some of the old Classes are very large, and it is hoped that
in a very short time several others will be established. The prayer meetings are
well attended, and a very gracious influence rests upon the people.”
In a publication ( Sydney , in 1848) this Chapel is thus described: “The
Wesleyan Centenary Chapel is one of those few good buildings of which the
Wesleyans particularly, and the citizens generally, have reason to be proud. In-
deed, few of the provincial towns in England can boast of a building equal to
this. The basement is divided into two spacious school rooms, capable of
affording accommodation for 500 children. The interior arrangements are in
the usual style adopted in England. The pulpit, which is octagonal, with geo-
metrical staircase ascending from the aisle, is a very clever piece of workman-
ship. A gallery is now in course of erection, its panels and other fittings to be
the choicest Colonial cedar, and the workmanship equal to any at home. The
Wesleyans are rapidly gaining ground in this Colony .... so that now in
the city and suburbs there are no less than ten Chapels, all well attended.”
The population of Sydney and suburbs was then 50,000, and the Sydney
Circuit embraced Sydney, Toxteth, Waverley, Newtown, Botany, Ashffeld,
Moorfields, Lane Cove, Pyrmont, and Balmain, with seven Missionaries in the
entire Colony. “They were a happy few,” says the Rev. Joseph Oram, “with
Mr. Boyce at their head.” But “ Preachers and Churches grow old and pass


away like candles and candlesticks, but the Gospel is like the sunlight, whose
radiance is as fresh and young to-day as when it fell for the last time, ages ago,
on a world without a sinner in it, or a tearful eye, or a human grave.”
1 his development of the work at the Centenary Chapel was accompanied
by many other signs of a cheering nature. In 1838 Mr. McKenny writes:—
“ God, in His good providence, has opened the country before us in its length
and breadth, so that we have only to go up and possess it. lam sure the Com-
mittee will be at once ready to avail themselves of the present state of things,
and feel their obligations to enter the open door that Divine Providence has
set before them. This is not a question of mere pounds, shillings, and pence;
for it now assumes this form: Shall Australia be a Protestant or a Popish
Colony ? The number of Priests who are being sent out is quite frightful;
lately eight arrived in one vessel, and received from the Home Government
A l5O each for their passage and outfit. In Sydney, our Chapels are by no
means equal to our congregations. ... A blessed influence attends our ser-
vices, and the increase of religion is manifest. Come or send SOON to our
help.”
The question here raised was one which gave the Distiict Meeting no
little concern, a fact abundantly evidenced by the frequent appeals for more
Missionaries. The Government having passed a Bill placing all denominations
on an equality with regard to State Aid, this provision was eagerly seized by
the various denominations. “ The various parties are vieing with each other in
order to establish their interests in every part of the country. The Episcopa-
lians, the Presbyterians, and especially the Roman Catholics, are most zealous,
and within the last six months no less a number than twelve Romish priests
have arrived, each of whom had received the sum of Tl5O Horn the Home
Government towards their outfit and passage.” The “ Bishop of Australia ”
was equally active, while the Presbyterians were bringing out Ministers and
Schoolmasters. The Wesleyans, however, could not at first avail themselves of
this aid, as their Chapels were not settled on the principles of the Church Act.
But now they stood on the same platform as the other denominations. “ And
what shall we say to our Committee to induce them to act vigorously. Phis
land is now before us in its length and breadth, a very extensive feeling of
goodwill towards the Wesleyans exists throughout the Colony; and if we had
ten additional Brethren on the spot we should be able to place them where
their own personal and ordinary expenses would be met. The feelings of the
Brethren in reference to the moral state of this country can hardly be described.
Of course, we cannot but desire that pious Ministers of every denomination
should come out here to the help of the Lord; but the favours shown and the
facilities afforded to the Romanists at home and on the spot cannot but fill our
minds with great concern for the religious and moral condition of this Colony.
The question just now appears to be; Shall its poor inhabitants be consigned to
the awful and destructive errors of Popery; or shall they be rescued by a
timely and powerful effort on the part of Protestants? We, as a Body, have
the confidence of the community, and, in fact, they look to us and say: ‘ Our
houses, our estates, our purses, are open to you ; only provide us with faithful
labourers to rescue the Colony from the evil that now threatens us, and let the


religion of the Scriptures be the religion of Australia.’ This statement is not
highly coloured ; it is matter of fact. And if ever country had claim upon Mis-
sionary enterprise it is New South Wales. We want men. The country will
supply the means. The District would therefore earnestly urge upon the
Committee the necessity of sending the number of men requested, and the
propriety of an application to Lord Glenelg for assistance in their outfit.”
—( District Minutes , 1839.)
This matter was again referred to the following year. The Minutes speak
of the absolute necessity of an increase of Missionaries to counteract the
“ awfully growing influence of Popery. The events of the past year have not
in any degree allayed our fears respecting the danger in which Protestantism is
at present placed; nor are we less impressed with the conviction that if effectual
resistance be offered to the spread of Popery in this Colony, the Wesleyans
must take a very prominent part in that resistance. The facts we named last
year relative to our having access to every part of the Colony we now repeat,
and have no hesitation in saying that several more Missionaries would be en-
tirely supported by the people, especially with the aid now afforded by the
Government.” —{M inutes, 1840.)
The District Meeting also found itself called upon to consider Popish ag-
gression at Tahiti, then under the care of the London Missionary Society, where
the work of that body had been hampered by the action of Captain La Place,
of the French Frigate, LArtemise. This frigate, getting on the rocks, was
nearly lost, and with very great difficulty was kept afloat till she reached
Papeete, where for several weeks 150 natives were pumping day and night to
keep her from sinking. In two or three months’ time she was repaired, her
crew, numbering 450, behaving themselves well while ashore. When ready to
put to sea the Captain threw off his Jesuitical disguise, assumed a threatening
posture, and demanded liberty for the Roman Catholics to worship when and
where they would in defiance of the law passed at Tahiti prohibiting Roman
Catholic doctrines being taught. Fie insisted that this law should be repealed,
that a Roman Catholic Chapel should be built at Papeete, and at every other
Station where there was a Protestant place of worship, and told the Queen that
if she did not willingly agree he would make her. And he would enforce
obedience in that gentle manner so characteristic of Rome’s agents! He would
land 200 men under arms to commence the work of devastation and death ; he
would set fire to the large Chapel, then the Queen’s house, and afterwards the
houses of the Royal family; and, finally, he would depose the Queen and put one
of the Chiefs in her place. Under the influence of such treats, the Queen,
though strongly averse to Popery, wavered, then feared, and eventually granted
the demands. “ Now I have no doubt that,” writes the Rev. Mr. Davis (Papaia,
July 25th, 1839) “we shall shortly have a swarm of Priests from their nest at
Valparaiso.”
The London Missionary Society’s agents reported the matter to the home
authorities, and to strengthen their hands they sought the help of the Wesleyan
Missionary Society through the Australian District Meeting, before whose
members copies of the correspondence was laid. At a Special District Meeting,


held in Princes Street Chapel, Sept. 25th, 1839, the Rev. J. McKenny, with the
Revs. N. Turner, J. Orton, J. Watkin, D. J. Draper, J. Spinney, and S. Wilkin-
son, considered the matter. While they would carefully avoid meddling- with
political matters, they said, they could not forbear expressing their regret at
the forcible and oppressive measures employed to secure the introduction of
Roman Catholicism amongst a people unwilling to accept the forced, gratuitous
services of the Romish Clergy. If such proceedings were practised with im-
punity serious apprehensions would be entertained for the peace and prosperity
of the successful Missions in the South Seas, particularly as attempts had al-
ready been made to introduce the Priests at Vavau in opposition to the wishes
of the natives. The District Meeting therefore drew the attention of the
General Committee to these occurrences, suggesting the propriety of employing
influence in such a manner as the importance of the case demanded.
But Popish aggression was not the only aggression that claimed the Mis-
sionaries’ attention. The Centenary Chapel was filled, and it became necessary,
in 1845, 1° a dd the galleries. The work of God in Sydney had extended in a
most encouraging manner. “ Several new Classes have been formed,” Mr.
Draper reports in 1844, “which are well attended. Some of the old Classes are
very large, and it is hoped that in a very short time several others will be estab-
lished. . . . It is believed that during the past year the number of persons at-
tending our Ministry in the city has nearly been doubled, and we rejoice to
know that a considerable number of persons, who at the beginning of the year
were without hope and without God in the world, are now members of our
Church, and partakers of the saving benefits of the Gospel.” —{District Minutes ,
1844.)
Material progress was also in evidence. At Surry Hills a neat Chapel,
24ft. x 16ft, was erected at the sole expense of Mr. L. Iredale, who had engaged
to settle it on the Conference plan. At Newtown, in 1840, half an acre of land
was promised by Mr. J. Jones for a Chapel and dwelling house, preaching ser-
vices and a Class having already been established. Here, with a rising popula-
tion, there was the prospect of great usefulness. At Botany Bay preaching was
resumed, and at Canterbury, “ a small village, our preaching is well attended.”
In the following year half an acre of land was purchased near the Sugar Works
for A3O, on which a temporary Chapel and School House were erected. At
Liverpool Street, Mr. T. W. Bowden, having erected a large store, for which he
had no immediate use, the lower part was placed at the Missionaries’ disposal.
Day and Sunday Schools were held in it, with service twice on the Sabbath
Day. In 1842 Mr. R. Campbell, M.L.C., presented an acre of land on the Liver-
pool Road, Canterbury (now Ashfield), which was to be regularly conveyed,
and on which a School House, to be temporarily used as a Chapel, was being
erected. In 1843 “ a very gracious work ”at Gordon was reported. The Syd-
ney Local Preachers, chief among them being Messrs. Pidgeon and John
Bowes, had visited this place every Sabbath, preaching the Gospel in the house
of Mr. Carver, in the midst of a people noted for adultery, drunkenness, and
cockfighting. Here a Class was formed, with Mr. Goodsell as Leader, and
James Uncles, W. H. McKeown, and Mr. and Mrs. Carver as members. Mr.


and Mrs. Bowes being on a visit to their friend, Mr. McKeown, they decided to
hold revival services—the first held in North Sydney—when several persons
were converted.
The following year (1844) the District Meeting reported a gift of land at
Waverley, 30ft. x 60ft., and the purchase of an allotment at Balmain, 40ft. x
60ft., for the sum of “eleven pounds sterling.” Both sites were “ secured to
the Connexion.” The Chapel at Waverley was commenced the same year,
being 25ft. by 15ft. “ in the clear.” “It is of stone, and will be a substantial
building. A considerable part of the funds has been secured, and, as one of
our friends in the neighbourhood has taken upon himself the responsibility of
its erection, we do not apprehend any difficulty in its completion.” Mr. Draper
adds, in his report of the work, “ a new School House, which is used as a Chapel,
has been erected and opened for Divine Service at Ashfield, a village five miles
from Sydney. A very encouraging congregation attends on the Lord’s Day,
and a Class has been formed.” This brick Chapel was divided by a partition,
the Schoolmaster living in the room at the back, which was 10ft. by 15ft. “At
the Canterbury Sugar Works, the number of members has been considerably
increased, and the propects are very satisfactory. At Balmain, a settlement on
the opposite side of the harbour, where a year ago preaching was discontinued
in consequence of the very small attendance, a new effort has been made with
every prospect of success. A Congregation of from 40 to 50 persons attends,
and 20 are meeting in Class. A Class has also been formed at Waverley, 2\
miles from Sydney. . . . Twelve persons are there united with us, and al-
though the population is small we have reason to expect an encouraging con-
gregation.”
Next year (1545) still further advance was made, the Government granting
land at the Haymarket and Chippendale, the former site “ facing the Market
Square, an eligible and most important part of the city,” and the latter “ a large
and most valuable piece of land.” At the Haymarket it was intended to erect
a new Chapel and School House to supersede the place in Liverpool Street,
lent by Mr. Bowden, who required it for his own use at the end of the year.
At Chippendale there were large Sunday and Day Schools, and a good con-
gregation, “ but without adequate accommodation, being held in a confined pri-
vate house.” At O’Connell Crescent, Newtown, “ Captain O’Connell has given
a very suitable and valuable piece of land for a Chapel and School, where they
are greatly wanted, the small schoolroom in use there being by. no means equal
to the purpose for which it is used.” The financial and spiritual affairs of the
Mission were now in a state of prosperity, notwithstanding the withdrawal of
donations by members of the Anglican Church, who, under the narrowing in-
fluence of High Churchism, were confining their gifts to their own body.
“ But, thank God,” adds Mr. McKenny, “ we are enabled to maintain our posi-
tion, and to exercise a growing moral influence upon Society, an influence that
we do not consider lessened by the strong tendency to Rome manifested by
many of the Ministers of the Church of England.” —(District Minutes , 1845.)

But perhaps the most encouraging feature of the work was found in the
number of young men ready to devote their lives to the preaching of the Gospel,
a fact which gave the Missionaries the greatest pleasure. James Dredge, who
was sent by the Home Government to Port Phillip in 1838 as one of the Pro-
tectors to the Aborigines, offered his services to the Mission, as he failed to find
in the post to which he was appointed an opportunity to improve the moral,
spiritual, and civil condition of the natives. The District Meeting of 1840 re-
commended his acceptance, and employed him as a Hired Local Preacher in
the Parramatta Circuit at a salary of £2OO per annum. As he was well known
to Dr. Bunting and several Ministers in the London District his acceptance
was recommended without hesitation. “ Physical mcompetency soon com-
pelled Mr. Dredge to retire from the active work of the Mission. The next
year John Watsford appeared before the District Meeting, and was unanimously
recommended as a candidate. For two years he had been a Local Preacher
in the Parramatta Circuit, though he was then but 21. He was described as
having a good education, “ some knowledge of the C lassics, is deeply pious,
very zealous, and in our united judgment is well qualified to be received, and
“ offers himself, without restriction, for any part of the Southern Hemisphere.”


le was conditionally stationed at Windsor and the Lower Hawkesbury. In
1842 Francis Glass, a native of Ireland, who emigrated in 1841, and was em-
ployed in the Hunter s River Circuit, where he had settled, was also recom-
mended as an Assistant Missionary. He was first employed as a Hired Local
Preacher at Cowpastures, in the Parramatta Circuit, and afterwards as Assistant
Missionary at Wollongong, where he continued but a short time, soon after
leaving for America. At the same meeting d homas McClelland, also a native
of Ireland, who had arrived that year, and was labouring, “ with acceptance,” as
a Local Preacher in the same Circuit as Mr. Glass, offered his services. He was
cordially recommended, offering himself for any part of "Australasia or Poly-
nesia.” Mr. McClelland afterwards withdrew his offer, though he continued
to act as a Local Preacher, rendering valuable service in West Maitland for
many years. William Lightbody, already referred to in connection with New-
castle Methodism, was the sole candidate in 1843. And as he had already
given proof of gifts and graces his acceptance was cordially recommended, and
he was employed conditionally as Assistant Missionary at Camden.
The next year it was found necessary to hold a special District Meeting
(January 31st) to consider developments consequent on the death of Mis-
sionaries in the South Sea Islands. Mr. Watsford was ordered to Fiji, and Mr.
David Hazlewood was recommended as Assistant Missionary. Mr. Hazlewood,
who emigrated to Australia in 1842, had been a Local Preacher in the Windsor
Circuit (Eng.), and came highly recommended by his Superintendent, the Rev.
William Biownell. Settling at Parramatta, he was recommended by that
Quarterly Meeting as a man of excellent health, deep piety, a thorough know-
ledge of the English language, and "considerable acquaintance with Greek
and Latin. Moreover, for three months he had been diligently studying the
Fijian language, assisted by Mrs. Cross, widow of the late Rev. W. Cross, using
the Grammar compiled by the Rev. David Cargill, M.A. As he could now
read the Scriptures in Feejeean with fluency ” he was rcommended as pecu-
liaily fitted for Mission work in the South Seas. They were therefore instructed
to proceed at once to Fiji in 7he Triton. In the same year William Lowe was
recommended for the Ministry, having been a Local Preacher in the Nantwich
Circuit, emigrating to this Colony in 1842, and eventually settling at Parramatta
as a Local Preacher. That Circuit sent him on the District Meeting, and the
Distnct Meeting employed him as Catechist in the Windsor Circuit, until the
Conference accepted him for the Mission.
And now Mr. McKenny’s work was done. At the District Meeting of
1847 he became a Supernumerary, and went to reside at Stanmore. Under
accumulated afflictions his patience was truly Christian, and his entire resigna-
tion to the will of his Heavenly Father remarkable. Gradually sinking,
through extreme weakness, he was removed to his bed. from which he never
lose again. Visited by his fellow-workers, Messrs. 1 urner, Lewis, and Harris,
he gave brief but expressive assurance of his interest in Christ. At nine o’clock
on Sabbath morning, October 31st. 184;, the weary wheels of life stood still,
and without a murmur or a sigh he passed within the veil. He was 58 years of
age, having been a Missionary 36 years. He was buried in the Devonshire

Street Cemetery. An extract from the Conference obituary notice may fittingly
close this chapter: “He was a man of simple faith in the atoning sacrifices of
God’s dear Son ; a faith that was most uniform in its exercise, and most Scrip-
tural in its manifestation. Both in principle and practice he was a thorough
Wesleyan. He well understood and faithfully pursued the special and proper
calling of a Minister in our body ; taking the oversight of the entire interests
of the Societies committed to his care, and labouring to advance the prosperity
of every department of our work, the temporal as well as the spiritual. In
superintending projects of Church extension, he displayed a truly correct taste
and an excellent judgment, and by his wisdom and prudence he preserved our
Connexional property from being involved in financial embarrassment.” 2
2 In 1901 Mr. McKenny’s remains were removed from the Mission House vault to the
Wesleyan Burial Ground at Rookwood, the Government having resumed the Cemetery
site for railway purposes.

CHAPTER XL
THE MISSIONS TO THE SOUTH
SEA ISLANDS.
A GLANCE at the map of the world reveals a network of Oceanic islands
dotted throughout the South Pacific Ocean, which are thus grouped:
Melanesia, the Black Island region, Micronesia, the region of small
islands, and Polynesia, the region of many islands. Of these groups
the two most important are the Sandwich Islands in the north, and
the Fiji Islands in the south, 4000 miles apajrt. The Fijian group numbers more
than 200 islands, about 80 of which are inhabited, the largest island being Vitu
Fevu. All these islands, which are of volcanic origin, are well wooded and ex-
tremely fertile. The Friendly Islands, in the Polynesian group, consist largely
of coral or volcanic deposits, and are extremely low, the chief island of this
group being Tongataboo, or sacred Tonga. The Samoan Islands, also in the
Polynesian group, are volcanic in origin, and are said to be among the loveliest
islands in the Pacific. Nature produced “on mountain slope and peak and in
coral lagoon her most beautiful effects. To compensate the people for their
isolation, their island homes were enriched with many of the choicest gifts of
Divine Wisdom and goodness. Forest and ocean gave them an abundant and
varied supply of food, and a genial climate and balmy breezes ministered to their
daily comfort.” ( Christianity in Polynesia , p. II.) From whence the inhabitants
of these lovely islands came is a question which cannot positively be decided.
First discovered by Tasman in 1643, next explored by Cook in 1774, they were
afterwards visited in increasing frequency by trading and other vessels. In the
year 1804, twenty-seven convicts, who had escaped from New South Wales,
succeeded in reaching the Fiji group, where they settled. At the end of thirty
years one man only was left, an Irishman named Connor.
The attention of the Missionary Committee was first drawn to these islands
by Walter Lawry and Samuel Leigh. Lawry had the prophetic insight; for it
will be remembered that in the year 1818 he wrote to the Committee: ‘‘The
Station (New South Wales) is certainly one of the most important under your
direction. From us, in a few years, I expect to see Missionaries sallying forth
to the numerous islands which spot the sea on every side of us. The Friendly
Isles, Feejees, New Llebrides, New Caledonia, New Zealand, New Georgia; and
to the north again, very contiguous to us, are the fine islands of New Guinea,
New Ireland, Celebes, Timor, Borneo, Gilolo, and a great cluster of thickly


inhabited Missionary posts.” But Lawry was not satisfied with prophesying
great things. He did his best to bring about their fulfilment. And he there-
fore offered to go as a Missionary to the Friendly Islands, if the Conference
would appoint him. To this the Conference consented at Liverpool in 1820,
furnishing him with similar instructions to those given to Samuel Leigh. (See
Chapter on the New Zealand Mission.) To the Friendly Islands’ Mission the
Committee attached special importance for the following reasons; “We are the
only labourers, and because of the bearing which the success of such a Mission
there will have upon that part of the world, comparatively unknown and unvisit-
ed.”-—(Committee’s Instructions, vol. I, p. 55.)
Among the members of the Polynesian family, the Tongans took front
rank. “ Ethnologists claim for the Samoans and Tongans that in physical pro-
portions they stand at the head of all races. In physique and brain capacity
finer specimens of human development can nowhere be found.” —( Christianity in
Polynesia, p. 84.) They honoured and respected woman, and old age was never
wantonly insulted. This in itself speaks volumes, and is an index to their
superiority of character when compared with their neighbours the Fijians. If
the Tongans took highest place, the Fijians could without a rival claim the
lowest; their salvation is therefore the more remarkable.
The earliest attempts to take the Gospel to the Friendly Islands were made
by the London Missionary Society. In April, 1797, this Society landed ten lay
agents at Hihifo with a view to the civilization of the Tongans. But from a
variety of causes their Mission was fruitless. Three of them were murdered
during a native war; one became a pagan, and the remainder, after two years
of stress and storm, seized the opportunity to remove to Sydney. One of their
number, William Shelley, who settled at Parramatta, never ceased to labour for
the re-opening of the Mission. Some years later, two native teachers from
Tahiti, on their way as pioneers to Fiji, were left at Tonga; and one of them,
Rape by name, deserves special mention for the work he did. The cause of
failure in this well-meant attempt on the part of the London Missionary Society
is apparent. The same result followed the work of the Church Mission in New
Zealand. These efforts to regenerate the man from without were conspicuous
failures, as all such attempts must always be. Two runaway convicts and a dis-
reputable Englishman resident on the island did not contribute to their success,
though they did help on their failure. One of these convicts, a man named Mor-
gan, had made his escape from Botany Bay. He proved a great obstacle to the
Missionaries, whom he robbed on several occasions. But when they made
known his character the natives treated him with insult, and made his life in-
supportable. To be revenged he told the King that the Missionaries were sent
by the King of England to destroy the natives, and take possession of their
land, which they were accomplishing by witchcraft and incantations. This story
was rendered more probable by an epidemic which then prevailed among them,
from which several persons died each day. To these falsehoods the natives gave
credence, and, as above stated, killed three of the lay agents. But Morgan’s end
came; for, having incensed a chief by a stupid threat, he was clubbed to death
on the seashore. The mischief was wrought nevertheless.


On their acquaintance with the white man, the Tongans spoke of him as
papalangi , under the vain fancy that he had rent the heavens, and come down
to them. But unfortunately this idea soon gave place to others of a less com-
plimentary nature. The Rev. J. M. Alexander says: “It became proverbial that
on coming to this far-away ocean many men, even from the best circles of
society, hung up their consciences off Cape Horn, and seemed to conclude that
God did not rule West of America. Some of these adventurers were from the
worst classes of civilised communities, from the dark corruption that seeths in
great cities, and pours forth only to blight and blast wherever the ships ol
commerce sail. The histories of some of these men would be darker than the
heathen themselves.” I his “lengthened and made more dark for the Mission-
aries that night of toil through which they had to pass before the dawn appeared,
and it inflicted wounds upon the islanders which are still open sores most difficult
to heal.” — {Christianity in Polynesia , p. 14.)
The religion of the Tongans was thus described by Mr. Lawry: “They
have no knowledge of the one true God, but seem to have some confused notion
of the immortality of the human soul. The other world they call boolotoo : to
this place go all the dead; but some are insensible of pleasure or pain, while
others (the higher orders) remain in a state of consciousness, but whether joyous
or otherwise, they have not determined. They consider death the greatest of
evils. Their opinion is that the souls of their great men come from boolotoo , and
enter at certain times into such individuals as they may choose. Any person
who chooses to say the Atooa is come into him, is reverenced as a god, and his
words are seldom discredited. When anyone is sick he presents the man who
is thus supposed to be inspired with a sacrifice, which is greater or smaller, as
occasion may require; sometimes a piece of cava, an axe, or, in great extremity,
a child. Whatever the sorcerer is pleased to say, is considered as the word of
the Atooa or god. These priests often work themselves up into such a state of
frenzy that they appear to be in strong convulsions, in which they say they are
entirely passive. This may sometimes be the case, when the devil is permitted
to influence them in such a manner as to deceive their countrymen.” {Mission-
ary Notices , 1823, p. 102.)
After a tempestuous voyage of two months in the St. Michael , under Cap-
tain Beveridge, Walter Lawry arrived at Tonga on the 16th August, 1822, having
spent two weeks at New Zealand, where the vessel left supplies for Mr. Leigh.
He was first met by William Singleton, an Englishman who had been resident
on the islands for sixteen years, since the cutting off of the Port-au-Prince. He
had become a perfect Tongan in his manners, having abandoned all civilised
habits. He rendered great service as interpreter, and, though Mr. Lawry argued
and pleaded with him, lending him Wesley’s Sermons and seeking in every
possible way to reclaim him, he refused to abandon his ways, and ultimately
decided to cast in his lot with the heathen. Lawry was accompanied by his
wife and child, and a Marquesas lad, whom he thought likely to be of service
as interpreter. But in this he was disappointed, as he knew nothing of the
Tongan dialect. He had also George Lilley, a carpenter, “a very pious young
man from the Colony ” ; Charles Tindale, also “ a pious young man,” and Thomas

Wright, general servant. Lilley grew weary, and his place was filled by Thomas
Bainbrick, “a clever workman,” while Wright was promoted to the post of
agriculturist, “ an office which we consider to be absolutely necessary,” said the
Missionaries.
A few minutes after Singleton’s arrival, Palau, “ the stoutest man I ever saw,”
and one of the principal Chiefs, came on board, to whom Mr. Lawry made
known his purposes. Palau appeared very anxious for the Mission to be estab-
lished among his people, promising every support. Mr. Lawry landed, accom-
panied by Singleton and the Chief. “ A very great concourse of Indians were
assembled on the beach. As the landing place was bad, a very tall native
to the boat, and took me ashore on his back. A multitude swarmed around me,
but the Chief gave orders for them to form themselves into a ring: his commands
were promptly obeyed, and he took his seat on one side, and desired me to come
to him. A Chief sat by his side, called Taoofa. Between these I sat down while
cava was prepared. This was a most interesting scene to me. I thought of my
friends, and the Societies in England, and New South Wales, and wished they
could have beheld the sight. There were two clusters of bananas in the centre
of the ring, one of which was presented to me by the Chief’s order. I expressed


a wish to go into the country, that I might judge whether it was a proper place
or our purposes or not. The Chief walked a little way, but complained of
fatigue ; and sitting down on the grass, sent his son and some of his men as my
guards. With these and Singleton I proceeded a few miles inland. The coun-
try was beautiful, and the soil is very rich. I observed the people watched every
step 1 took, and every part of my conduct. My clothes were very narrowly
examined, especially my outside jacket, which was of Scotch plaid. They felt
it, smelt it, and several took a fold in their mouths. Many of them had never
seen a European in his own dress before. Ships are in great dread of these
pagans, and many seamen have been cut off by them. In the evening I re-
turned to the ship, where I was received with no small joy. In this day’s
occurrence I have evidently seen the hand of the Lord.”— (Missionary Notices
1823-5.)
The next day he landed seven sheep, seven cows, and a bull, at which the
natives were much amazed. On the 27th he went ashore at Maofanga, accom-
panied by Mrs. Lawry. “My object was to meet all the Chiefs, and open to
them the business upon which we were come to d onga. Seven were present
The people consisting of a vast crowd, the number of which I could not guess,
took us into the hoof an gas, where we were introduced into a house, which con-
sisted of a roof standing upon pillars, and floored with mats. The Chiefs came
to us, and the people formed themselves into a circle outside. I presented to
the Chiefs twenty chisels, and two axes, which they said was the greatest favour
ever done them. The King of Britain was sending them presents: and there
never was such a thing before.”
Mr. Lawry’s Journal contains interesting detail of the prospects and diffi-
culties connected with the commencement of the Mission. The Mission House
and other buildings, including a blacksmith’s shop, were erected ; a large piece
of ground was fenced in, and a garden brought under cultivation ; fruit trees and
vegetables were planted, and live stock was introduced. Thus the future was
bright with hope, and Mr. Lawry was encouraged to believe the Mission would
prosper. But he had misread the signs around him. The strong and forceful
bongan was not so ready to cast away his gods, and he became suspicious of the
Missionary’s prayers, thinking they would bring upon the land new calamities.
Mrs. Lawry’s health having failed after fourteen months labour on the island,
Mr. Lawry returned to England by way of Sydney, leavmg the artisans behind
him. that his Mission was surrounded by difficulty is apparent from his
Journal. The Chief who had impulsively promised his assistance was more dis-
tinguishable for treachery than tenderness. “ They seem to have forgotten their
first impressions and promises, and only seek how they may insult and injure us.
Some of the Mission property Palau has taken away by treachery, and some by
violence; leaving us with the graves of our predecessors before our eyes, to
conjecture how these things will end.” And again: “ Every day’s experience
tends to convince us that these savages are not so much in love with us as with
with our property. They are not to be restrained within bounds, while we retain
so many good things, of which they know they can possess themselves if they
use their power. Palau rather grows worse ; and Satan seems to buckle on his


full armour in defence of his invaded dominions. Hitherto the Lord hath helped
us, and we trust He will still deliver The arrival of the St. Michael
would now be very acceptable to us, several articles of our household necessaries
being expended, and we have neither sugar nor soap. I have scarcely a hat or a
shoe to put on ; but, blessed be God, we are both contented and happy.
But when the day of departure came the heathen relented. On October ist,
1823, Mr. Lawry writes: “ The natives are evidently very much affected at our
projected departure ; they crowd round our premises from morning to night, and
beg us not to go away ; or, if we do go, they say they hope we shall soon return
from the foreign countries, and bring some of our relations with us. We have
this day (October 3rd) embarked for New South Wales, and the scene of our
departure was truly moving. Palau was scarcely able to open his mouth for
weeping: vast crowds collected round our house, and carried almost all our lug-
gage in their canoes to the ship, a distance of seven or eight miles. Just as
we were stepping into our boat, the natives formed themselves into a regular
cava ring, and desired me to stand in the middle of it, while one of the Chief
speakers addressed me to the following purpose: 'We thank you for coming
among us. Before you came it was dark night on Tonga ; now it begins to be
light. Your friends in the foreign lands have sent for you ; well, go, and tell
them that Tonga is a foolish land, and let them send us many Teachers. Our
hearts are sore, because you are going from us.’ Here they burst into tears, and
I could bear the scene no longer.” —( Missionary Notices, 1823, p. 341.)
Though “ greatly dissappomted ” at the turn of affairs the Committee still
cherished the belief that a successful Mission might be established. With this
end in view, the Revs. John Thomas and John Hutchinson were appointed to
Tonga, and they resumed the work in June, 1826. They built their house and
settled at Hihifo, twelve miles from Nukualofa, where they were exposed to
robbery and insult, and began to fear for their personal safety. The Chief, Ata,
openly expressed his contempt for the God of the Christians. Mr. Thomas, full
of zeal and ardour, persevered ; but Mr. Hutchinson, whose health was seriously
affected, applied for permission to return to Australia. At the end of ten
months, Mr. Thomas saw no sign of victory, and his confidence in the Chief
proved to be misplaced. Difficulties were thrown in the way, and the spirit of
persecution made itself evident. Taking advantage of this the youths robbed
the Mission with impunity, and those who had attended Divine Service were
commanded to leave the district. —{The Pioneer Missionary, p. 91.) An appeal
to Sydney for additional help led to the appointment of the Rev. Nathaniel
Turner and the Rev. William Cross, who left Sydney with their wives in the
year 182;. Mr. Weiss arrived a little later. On arrival, Mr. Turner thought
it advisable to take up work at Nukualofa, where Tubou, the Chief, had expressed
a wish for a European Missionary. With Messrs. Cross and Weiss he started
at daybreak, and arrived in time to hear Hape the Tahitian teacher conduct
the service. Refreshments were provided, a conference was held, and Tubou
expressed his approval of the proposed Mission. Temporary dwellings were
found, and in a short time the Missionaries with their stores were safely housed.


lllgen effort was now put forth to acquire the language, and within a
short time the Missionaries composed a hymn, wrote a prayer and sermon and
used all three in public worship. Trouble now arose between the Chiefs and
the King, and I übou was carefully watched. The Chapel was closed ; but this
did not prevent 1 übou from stealing into Mr. Turner’s bedroom to join him in
the worship of God. At the first District Meeting held late in the year, the
Alphabet and plan of Orthography prepared by Mr. Turner were approved, and
it was deaded to prepare a First School Book to be printed in Sydney. Mr.
Hutchinson obtained permission to return to the Colony, and Mr. Turner, whose
health was indifferent, took his place. Meanwhile Mr. Thomas and Mr. Turner
assisted each other in composing hymns and the School Book. But Ata, the
Chief, perversely opposed the instruction of his people. A native school’ was
begun in March, with fifty present the first day, the number rapidly increasing.
Another school was also commenced at Hihifo. Mr. and Mrs. Cross and Mrs.
Turner instructed the women and girls each afternoon ; and so rapid was their
piogiess that they found it difficult to satisfy their thirst for knowledge. In
June, 1828, they were gladdened by the conversion of Tubou. The event
caused much joy, and Mr. Thomas came from Hihifo to assist at the service.
Now came a period of toil and rejoicing. The harvest time had come.
Medical attention successfully ministered proved a valuable auxiliary; and the
Missionary’s skill was in constant demand. So mightily did the work of God
prevail that on the 4th of October Mr. Turner wrote to the General Committee:
My mind is at this time affected by the absolute necessity there is of more help
being sent to this infant Mission. . . . On one island, where no Missionary
has set his foot, a Chapel has been erected by the poor natives in full expec-
tation of one. On one of the Habaai Islands, they have persuaded an ungodly
sailor to become their instructor. Do, my dear Fathers and Brethren, pity and
help these thousands of perishing souls. Tell their wants, publish their cries
throughout England, and I doubt not the increased liberality of those who love
Jesus will enable you to send a press and a printer, and men who will gladly
rush into these open doors, and cry ‘ Behold the Lamb of God.’ ”
To Mr. Leigh, Mr. Turner wrote in a still more joyous strain: “The
work is unquestionably begun. Many have entirely laid aside their heathen
customs and superstitions, and according to the light they possess sincerely wor-
ship the true God. I can hear them pray to Jehovah in their little communities
with such solemnity of spirit and propriety of expression as quite affect me. . .
My diligent and laborious colleagues make great progress with the language.
Thousands in the neighbouring islands are crying, ‘ Come over and help us.’
Our trials are severe, but they are swallowed up in our mighty concern to in-
struct and save the race.” The first Class Meeting was held October 14th,
1828, and the first convert at Hihifo was baptised by Mr. Thomas in January,
1829, while six of the most promising of the Catechumens were publicly received
into the Church by Baptism, the names assigned to them being Noah, Moses,
Peter, Barnabas, Joseph and John. They all became Preachers of the Gospel
to their countrymen. The first Christian marriage took place on the 3rd May,
the same year, and Mr. Cross preached a special sermon on David and Goliath.


Sunday, the 7th June, was a Pentecostal day. A gracious influence rested upon
the congregation and many were pricked in their hearts. The District Meet-
ing of 1830 shewed great and substantial prosperity. The Church members
were more than doubled, and over a thousand were under instruction in the
schools.
March brought reinforcements, to whom Messrs. Turner and Cross gave a
hearty welcome on the beach. Nathaniel Turner thus describes the party: —
“ Brother Peter Turner is from Macclesfield, in my own beloved Cheshire. In
vain we sought to find any nearer relationship, but in Jesus we are one. Both
he and his good wife appeared truly alive to God, and endued with a Missionary
soul. Brother Watkin is from Manchester, and appears a clear-headed, active-
minded man. He will soon get the language. His little wife is niece to the
holy Joseph Entwistle, one of the most eminent Fathers of the Wesleyan Body.
Brother and Sister Woon are from Cornwall; they will soon win the confidence
and affection of the people to whom they have devoted their lives. Brother
Woon is our Missionary Printer ; he has brought a press, and a good supply of
material. Thank God this will not only lessen our toils (who have hitherto pro-
vided all with our pens), but it will supply thousands of hungry souls with
heavenly food.” In the evening Mr. Watkin preached, and a few days later the
new Missionaries witnessed the public baptism of nearly seventy adults and the
marriage of about twenty couples. Another extract from the pen of Nathaniel
Turner will give additional proof of the wonderful success of the Gospel. In
1831 he writes to the Committee: —“ It is a great consolation to me to know
that I have left the Mission in a very prosperous state, with every prospect of
still greater success. . . . They have just opened a new Chapel at Lifuka,
longer than the one at Nukualofa: upwards of two thousand persons were
present at the opening services. Nine Classes have been formed, with constant
additions. More than five hundred persons are now meeting as members with
us. What hath God wrought! And what may we not soon expect!”
Captain Russell, who visited the Friendly Islands about this time, informed
the Rev. Joseph Orton that it was delightfully astonishing to see the good done
by the Mission. The work was rapidly extending, and seemed only to be
stayed by want of labourers. At Vavau the Chiefs had determined upon the
erection of a Church sufficiently large to contain the greatest portion of the in-
habitants that they might receive the instructions of their only Missionary.
Captain Russell conveyed some of the natives, in company with Mr. Cross, from
one island to another; and he bears testimony to their transformation, with
which he was highly gratified. They were regular in their devotions, apt in
quoting Scriptures, and many of the females wrote a beautiful hand. Though
he had travelled over the greater part of the world, and particularly among the
South Sea Islands, he had never, he said, witnessed anything like it. The
Missionaries had succeeded in establishing morality, while a religious influence
prevailed over the minds of the natives. “ Never,” adds Mr. Orton, “ was it
more emphatically said concerning any Missionary Station: ‘ The fields are
white unto harvest; but the labourers are few.’ ” It was during this year that
a proposal for visiting the Mission stations regularly in Tonga and New Zealand

(amc from Captain Henry, the son of one of the London Mission agents to the
Society Islands. Captain Henry proposed that for the sum of £3OO yearly
from the Wesleyan Missionary Society, and £350 from the London Missionary
Society, he would undertake to find a vessel to attend upon and to visit all the
Mission stations belonging to both Societies once a year, making Sydney the
port of discharge ; and carrying passengers and luggage from station to station
as requiied for a period of five years. The time occupied by such a trip, Cap-
tain Henry said, would be about seven months. In submitting this proposal
to the Committee, Mr. Orton suggested its acceptance for the following reasons:
Considerable inconvenience was felt, especially at Tonga, by the infrequent op-
portunities available for communication; all previous plans suggested or
adopted had not been satisfactory ; and the importance and probable develop-
ments of these stations demanded better facilities for communication. The
Committee did not accept Captain Henry’s offer.
This flourishing Mission, of which so much might be written, must be dis-
missed with a brief summary from the pen of the Rev. John Thomas. In 1832
Vavau was added, and the membership totalled 1422; in 1833 the total was
3456; and 1834 there were 7451 members. “In this district,” writes Mr.
Thomas in 1835, “we have one hundred and thirty schools, 960 teachers, and
7241 scholars, and upwards of 200 Local Preachers. In the short space of
nine years not less than five groups of Islands have embraced Christianity, com-
prising not fewer than 14,000 souls! May we not exclaim: ‘What hath God
wrought! ’ The enemies of the Lord have been found liars. ‘ The Lord hath
been mindful of us and He will bless us.’ Blessed be His Holy Name! New,
and if possible, more important fields of Missionary labour are inviting us to
cultivate them.”—( Methodist Magazine , 1837, p. 230.)
1 he reader will not be surprised to learn that the outcome of this gracious
revival at Tonga was a desire to bring Fiji and the neighbouring Islands within
the circle of its influence. Under the protection of a small Chief, some Tahitian
Teachers had previously been introduced into Fiji, and some of the residents of
Lakeba had renounced their idolatry; and with their teachers had settled on an
Island named Oneata, being driven there by persecution. “ The Fijians,” says
the Rev. James Watkin, “ judging from their general appearance and language,
are descended from another stock than the Friendly Islanders, though it is true,
there are some points of resemblance in their habits. It does not become me
to decide where wise men have been puzzled and kept to mere conjecture, or I
should certainly think the Feejeeans had an Asiatic origin, whilst the Friendly
Islanders might have descended from an ancestry originally from the continent
of America. My opinion of the Asiatic origin of the Feejeeans does not rest
merely upon the Asiatic contour of countenance which I think they bear ; but
there are points of resemblance in their habits.”—( Methodist Magazine , p. 68,
1836.)
For the conversion of the Fijians the Tongan Missionaries were greatly
concerned. “ Plead with the friends of Missions in behalf of Fejee, Samoa,
Niua, Niua-Foou, and several Islands, that are white for the harvest,” writes the
Rev. Charles Tucker from Lifuka in September, 1834. “Here are thousands


upon thousands of immortal souls, who have never heard of the name of Jesus,
O send us help, I beseech and intreat you ; send us more men, who are willing
to labour and suffer for Christ, if called to it. The doors are open wide; the
people are crying out to us to help them ; but we have not strength. We are
willing to go anywhere, to spend and to be spent in the glorious work in which
we are engaged; but we cannot do impossibilities; we cannot go to Fejee,
Niua, etc., without neglecting the ground already broken up.”
The Rev. William Cross now volunteered to go to Fiji, and the Committee
appointed the Rev. David Cargill, M.A., to accompany him. Mr. Cross had
already had his baptism of fire. When stationed in Tonga, and while proceed-
ing from Nukualofa to Vavau (January 7th, 1832), accompanied by several
natives, he had a most painful experience in the death of his wife by drowning,
When near Hunga Tonga, after being benighted and storm-tossed, they deter-
mined to return to Tonga. But they were driven on the rocks near Atata, and
all washed off the canoe, which was dashed to pieces. “ T had my arms round
Mrs. Cross, nor did I let her go. The water was about six or seven feet deep.
Several times we arose to the surface, and were as often overwhelmed by the
surf. I continued to hold Mrs. Cross with my right arm, while my left was em-
ployed in catching at poles and broken parts of the canoe, by which means we
had an opportunity of breathing. No word of complaint or fear escaped my
dear wife’s lips ; but she several times said; ‘ Lord, save us! Lord, have mercy
upon us! Lord deliver us in this our time of need.’ I said, ‘ Look to the Lord
we are both going to heaven together.’ A few more seconds, and she spoke
no more. I still clasped her with my right arm, was perfectly collected, and
expected in a few minutes more to be in heaven with her ; but the Lord, con-
trary to my expectation, made a way for my escape.” —{Letter to Committee. ,
1832). The body, which was lost for a time, was recovered at Hihifo and
brought to Mr. Thomas’ house. No carpenter being available, a coffin was pre-
pared in the best possible way, her name was placed on her breast arid she was
buried in the King’s burying ground. Mr. Thomas read the burial service, and
thus was laid to rest the first martyr to fall on the Wesleyan Mission field in the
South Seas. Mrs. Cross was formerly a teacher in the Sunday School at
Parramatta, where she was converted under Samuel Leigh’s Ministry.
Mr. Cargill, made a special study of the language and religion of the
people, and it may be as well to insert here a summary of the sketch forwarded
to the Committee for insertion in the Methodist Magazine. —(See vcl. 1838, p.
862.) Their religion, Mr. Cargill says, is precisely that which Nature and tradi-
tion had taught them, and it was such as to engender animosity, war, murder
and misery. It was a compound of palpable absurdities and glaring contra-
dictions. They believed in the existence of a plurality of gods and of malignant
■genii, called gods, who go to and fro on the earth for mischievous purposes
Their religious rites were numerous, and some of them associated with deeds of
horrid cruelty, which have a most degrading influence. The gods are never
approached by the people ; this being the exclusive duty of the priests who
propitiate them by offerings, including the little finger and the immolation of
human beings. Their sacred rites were performed in temples which women

ant diabolical in its attendant circumstances. Take one example. When about

o a distant territory. He was then kept for some time, made as fat as possible,
forced to sit on the ground, with his feet under his thighs and his hands placed
before him so that he could not move a limb or joint. He was then made to sit
on stones heated for the occasion, and covered with leaves and earth preparatory
to being roasted alive. When cooked he was carried as an offering to the gods 7

ometimes men women and children put to death in cold blood. The children

head and then made to dangle in the wind as trophies of the victory.
Women were strangled on the death of their husbands and buried with
them. Sometimes they omitted to strangle them and buried them alive, while
the aged and infirm having exhausted the patience of their friends were either
abandoned or buried alive. Nor were these cruelties occasional outbursts
1 hey were rather the constant overflowing of the heart. When about to launch
a new canoe several victims were slaughtered, their bodies being dragged about
he deck so that it should be soaked in blood. Sometimes the canoe was
dragged into the water over human beings used in place of rollers. " The un-
natural prosperity to eat human flesh exists among them in its most savage
form. Facts demonstrated that the Feejeeans eat human flesh, not merely from
a principle of revenge, nor from necessity, but from choice .... and it is
Said ’ * hat ’ as if the F were human hyenas, they disinter dead bodies, even after
they have been two or three days in the ground ; and that, having washed them
m the sea. they roast and devour them ”—{Methodist Magazine, 1838 p 862)
In cases where they had a plentiful supply of food on hand, the heart was some-
times preserved for months. The bones were thrown about or formed into
needles for making sails. Such in brief was the character of those heathen for
whose salvation the Tongan Missionaries were pleading so earnestly.
On Monday, 12th October, 1835, Mr. Cross and Mr. Cargill with their wives
and families arrived at Lakemba, the principal island in the weather group As
they landed from the ship’s boat the natives assembled on the beach armed with
clubs and bayonets and they were received with surprise and caution Con-
ducted to the King’s house, introduced to His Majesty and other Chiefs they
conversed with them in the Tongan language. The' King promised land on
which to build, pledged himself to protect their persons and property and to
isten to instruction. He also offered them a house within the fortifications
which they considered it expedient to decline. In the afternoon their wives and
children were landed and they spent the night in a large canoe-house, but with-
out sleep, as the mosquitoes were unusually large and troublesome. The Captain
came to their relief, and allowed them to make the vessel their home until tem-
porary edifices should be erected. The King had ordered the building
without delay and they soon took up their abode in these houses constructed
of the leaves of the cocoa nut tree. “On the Sabbath,” adds Mr. Cargill, “we

performed Divine Service in the morning and afternoon. On both occasions
we addressed the people in the Tongan language, which is intelligible to many
°f the Feejeeans. About one hundred and fifty were present at each service.
\\ e stood in the open air. The King was present in the morning and listened
with great attention.” The inhabitants of Ono, the most Southern island of
the group were also anxious to receive a Teacher. They had taken offence at
their “ gods," for not preserving their bodies from death and disease. “ The
favourable commencement of a new and important Mission,” as the Methodist
Magazine describes it (Vol. Ixi., p. 149)) led the Committee to resolve on sending
reinforcements at once. The Revs. J. Spinney and Matthew Wilson were
directed to proceed to Fiji; “and in compliance with urgent representations of
the necessity of the case, the Rev. J. Jaggar has lately received a similar ap-
pointment He takes with him a printing press and type, of
which he is to have the superintendence, and which are likely to prove a valuable
auxiliary to the Mission. But even five Missionaries are a very inadequate sup-
ply for the numerous islands included in this group, which, by a friendly arrange-
ment made by the Committee with the Directors of the London Missionary
Society, are now left exclusively to the benevolent zeal and enterprise of the


Wesleyan body. Ihe undertaking, though pre-eminently required by the awful
state of the heathen population, is one of no ordinary difficulty, danger and
expense ; but will not on that account, be declined by those who believe that
the command of Christ is imperative on His Church, and that immortal souls
are of infinite value. If it should please God to crown it with continued pros-
pects of that usefulness of which its beginning has afforded the promise, the
Fegee Mission must, of necessity, be further re-inforced at no distant period.”
—( lbidem .)
Just at this time English Methodism was stirred to its depths by an appeal
on behalf of Fiji. At a special District Meeting held at Nukualofa, Oct. 22nd,
1836, the Rev. James Watkin, at the request of his Brethren drew up an appeal,
which they forwarded to the Committee in the hope that it would be circulated
throughout the United Kingdom. This the Committee willingly did, commend-
ing it especially to the collectors ; and suggesting that it be read at the Mis-
sionary Prayer Meetings and other gatherings. The “appeal” at once let loose
the springs of Christian benevolence. In one county two families agreed, after
listening to the “ appeal,” to give the sum of Tl2O, and to augment it, by the aid
of their friends to £2OO, if others would make it up to T2OOO, to provide at
once for the outfit and passage of six Missionaries and their wives. In another
small family two of the members immediately doubled their subscrip-
tions. And a letter containing £3 came to hand, accompanied by
this brief and pithy sentence: “I am sent in answer to the appeal, ‘ Pity, O pity
poor Fegee.’ ” The Committee held a special Meeting at which its members
decided to bring the number of Missionaries up to six, and the Rev. John Hunt,
then in the Theological Institution, was sent out in company with Mr. Jaggar;
the Rev. James Calvert, was sent also owing to an offer made by a Lincolnshire
lady to pay the whole expense of Mr. Hunt’s passage and to contribute TSO per
annum for three years.
If space permitted how gladly would we insert Mr. Watkins pathetic ap-
peal: “Pity poor Fegee.” After touching upon the “horrid cannibalism” of
the Fijians which exceeded that of the New Zealanders, and of which he gives
some revolting particulars, Mr. Watkin asks: What is the antidote for all these
evils? and proves conclusively that it is not to be found in commerce or the
arts of life. “The Gospel, and that only! Then send them the Gospel! You
are put in trust to send it to all mankind ; and Fegee is included in the original
intention We call upon you all for help. Ye rich men, we call
upon you to give more largely, out of the funds with which God has entrusted
you. ‘lt is required in a steward that a man be found faithful.’ Give of what
God has given you, and He will reward you. Ye tradesmen, give articles suit-
able to the establishment of a Fegee Mission on a large scale ; for a Mission on
a large scale is necessary. Polynesia presents no finer field for Missionary enter-
prise than is Fegee. Ye young men of talent and piety, who are putting on the
harness in order to engage in the work of Missions, offer yourselves for Fegee,
and come out with burning zeal for the Lord of Hosts, and ardent love to the
souls of men. Ye Christian parents, see that you do not withhold your sons
■and daughters from the work: at your peril, do not! Ye Collectors, male and


female, adult and juvenile, redouble your exertions. We give you another motive
to increased effort; another motto, —Fegee, cannibal Fegee! Pity, O pity, can-
nibal Fegee! . . . . The Lord incline thy heart, reader, to pity the poor
Fegeeans, and to help, according to thy ability. Give, if thou art able, largely ;
and if thou canst not give, pray. O pray for poor cannibal Fegee, that God
would pour out Flis Spirit upon that wilderness, so that it may also be glad, and
blossom as the rose! Amen.”
Notwithstanding the response given to these appeals, the Misionaries still
asked for more. “ I hope,” says David Cargill, “ You will take into your most
favourable consideration our petition for Missionaries in the Fegees. Ten More
could now be usefully employed. The population is numerous. Several in-
fluential Chiefs, having heard of Missionaries, desire to have them.” They were
also about to commence a new station in the leeward group. “ O send us col-
leagues ; send us help! At least one hundred thousand souls are perishing in
Fegee for lack of knowledge.”—(Letter to Rev. John Beecham, Sept. 1836.)
Meanwhile Mr. Cargill was devoting himself with great assiduity to a study
of the native language. He found that the language varied in the different
islands, though it was a difference in words, not in principles. One Grammar
and one Dictionary compiled as a Polyglot, would be sufficient for all Fiji he
thought. He contemplated a Grammar, and a Dictionary was then in progress,
in which he had inserted 3000 words, exclusive of names of places and per-
sons. He had also in eight months translated a part of Genesis, sixteen chap-
ters of Matthew, all Mark’s Gospel, and the Epistles of John. “ 1 am very
happy in my work. My time is wholty given up to the language and to duties
purely Missionary. . . . The translation of the Bible into the various dia-
lects of Fegee is a subject on which my mind dwells with ardour and delight ;
and I hope that I shall yet see such a work accomplished.” —(Missionary Maga-
zine., vol. Ixi., p. 855).
“ We are blessed with an encouraging degree of prosperity in this group of
the Fejee Islands,” writes Mr. Cargill in August, 1838, “notwithstanding the
opposition of Tuinayau and his brother. A new and neat Chapel is being
built; it will probably hold six or seven hundred persons. May it be the
birthplace of many souls! The press which you are sending will be a valuable
acquisition to us. The Gospel of Matthew has been sent to the press at Tonga.
I have the other three Gospels ready for the press, but I have resolved not to
print them until our own press shall arrive. . . . Our privations are in-
creased ; our supply is a mere pittance, notwithstanding the large quantities
of articles of barter with which you have from time to time furnished the Breth-
ren in the Friendly Islands. We have been obliged to sell our trunks, and
many articles of wearing apparel, and are still under the necessity of giving up
the Mission print and calico, which have been ordered for family use. We are
badly off for kitchen utensils, crockery ware, etc. We have only one teacup,
and that, by the bye, has lost the handle.” And Mr. Cross adds, “ I have
finished the translation of the Psalms into the dialect of Rewa, and Nos. I. and
11. of the Conference Catechism, but without the proofs. I have also prepared
a small Hymn Book, and a First Book of Reading Lessons. I am proceeding


with the translation of the Book of Proverbs. Mr. Cargill and I had hoped that
we should be enabled to translate the whole Bible before either of us left
Fejee.”
Mr. Cargill also gives interesting particulars of the development of the
Mission towards the middle of June the same year. He and his companion
were much cheered by the arrival of six native Teachers from Tonga, some
of whom were Chiefs of high rank, and burning with zeal for the Divine glory.
They were willing to labour anywhere or to do anything. He had formed the
syllabus of a Grammar containing five or six thousand words with their signifi-
cations, accentuation, and probable derivation. It was the result of much re-
search and of the labours of many happy hours. Mr. Cargill preached at Nuku-
nuku, where a piece of sheet copper did duty for a bell. The young converts
listened with attention, though some of the heathen part of the audience in-
dulged themselves by smoking tobacco. Generally the work was very en-
couragmg, numerous difficulties were surmounted, and violent opposition was
being removed. They preached five times a week at Lakemba, where there
were several zealous Local Preachers, and at all the stations there was ex-
hilarating intelligence. The Schedule for the Society at the close of the year
gave the following numbers, which may form a fitting close to this part: —
Members, 264; on trial, 89, showing an increase of 52 on the year. During
the year i/i members had removed, five had backslidden, eight had died, 57
couples had been married, and 178 adults and 56 children had been baptised.
Tonga also had the honour of sending pioneers to Samoa, or the Navigators’
Islands as they were frequently called. Of the religion of the Samoans, Dr.
George Turner says: “ One saw his god in the eel, another in the shark, another
in the turtle, another in the dog, another in the owl, another in the lizard, and so
on throughout all the fish of the sea, and birds, and four-footed beasts, and
creeping things.” They, too, were heathens, but higher in the scale than the
Fijians. The communication was frequent, large canoes passing from
Tonga to Samoa. Some of the Tongan Methodists married into
Samoan families, settled there, and established family prayer, a prac-
tice in which they were followed by a few Samoans only, as the nation prac-
tically remained heathen until later. But it was to Saivaaia, to whom
the honour of being the avowed pioneer of Methodism belongs. Visiting
Tonga in 1828 he there abandoned heathenism, returned to his home the year
following, and publicly professed Christianity, calling himself “ Lotu Tonga ”
a Methodist. Introducing his religion to his friends at Tafu and Salelologa,
they were induced to renounce their heathenism, substituting the “ Lotu Tonga
in its place, which rapidly grew apace. “ Everything was in a state of spon-
taneous growth. Demons were rapidly sinking into contempt, the lost know-
ledge of God was being restored, and the first faint semblance of Christian
worship was offered to Flim, but garbed in language which heretofore had been
used in devil worship. Prayer to God instead of to their ancient ‘ aitu ’ and the
observance of the Lord’s day formed the sum of their religion.”—(Dyson’s.
Samoan Methodism, p. 12.)

THE REV. JAMES WATKIN.
President of Australian Conference.
Just at this time (1830), that is, be it noted, several months after Methodism
had taken root, the London Missionary Society resolved to enter upon work in
Samoa, and with this object in view Messrs. Williams and Barff called in The
Messenger of Peace , leaving behind them eight Tahitian teachers under the
protection of Malietoa the Chief. Six of these Teachers were stationed at
Savaii and two at Upolu. Tui, the Chief of Satupaitea, who had already be-
come a Methodist, heard of this arrangement and proceeded to Tonga, where
through Tubou, in the year 1831, he appealed to the Wesleyan Missionaries for
a Missionary for his native town. In the Missionary Report of 1832 this ap-
peal is noted, and the Missionaries state that they had begun to prepare a
book for their instruction ; and the Committee adds: “ The Brethren of the Dis-
trict will adopt the best measures their circumstances will allow for improving
the favourable opportunity which is presented for introducing Christianity into
the Navigators’ Islands ” (p. 43). Tui returned, and became the head of
the “ Lotu Tonga.” The revival news from Tonga prepared the minds of
thousands of Samoans, and hundreds of people at Upolu renounced heathen-
ism soon after. In three years’ time from Tui’s return “ there were forty villages
and hamlets on Savaii, and twenty-five on Upolu, that had turned from the
worship of ‘ aitu ’ to serve the Living God, and were now called of the ‘ Lotu


Tonga.’”—(Dyson’s Samoan Methodism , p. 14.) “Thus,” to quote again the
same authority, “ during the first six years of its existence in Samoa, Methodism,
without guide, overseer, or ruler, had penetrated into one-fifth of the villages
and hamlets of the whole group. The movement, self-sustained, and indepen-
dent of foreign aid, had been begun and continued outside, and was widely separ-
ated by family jealousies from the London Missionary Society’s people. It had
grown into a Mission, the like of which, in other places, many years of toil and
expense had failed to accomplish. Churches had been built and congregations
were collected, and, if it had been possible, the poor heathen in this instance
would have given a practical answer to the Apostle’s question: ‘ How, then,
shall they call on Him in whom they have not believed ; and how shall they
hear without a preacher? ’ If ever the Lord set before the Wesleyan Church an
open door to any people which no men should have shut, surely this was one—
‘ A people prepared for the Lord ’ ” (p. 14).
At the Tongan District Meeting of 1834 the request of Tui and the in-
structions of the Committee led to the appointment of the Rev. Peter Turner,
who, after a series of trials and successes, proceeded to Samoa fresh from the
remarkable revival then in progress at the Friendly Islands. A schooner from
Fiji calling at Vavau, he left in January, 1835, with Mrs. Turner and four Ton-
gan Teachers. Through stress of weather they were detained at Niuatobutabu,
which was already white unto harvest. Gogo, the King, was convinced of
sin, cast his polygamy from him, and in a few weeks five hundred professed to
have received forgiveness of sin. After a stay on the island of four months they
reached Samoa on the 18th June, 1835. At Manono, where they made a brief
stay, he was surprised at the numerous applications for Teachers, which he
was unable to meet. At Satupaitea there was great excitement, and Tui was
wild with joy. Here Mr. Turner made his home, and also the head of
a new Circuit. The Mission was put into vigourous action, and the 2,000 con-
verts soon multiplied into 13,000. “This marvellous work was accomplished in
the short space of twenty months. During this time eighty Churches were
built in as many villages. Four thousand persons were distributed into above
three hundred classes, and 1,000 Teachers, who themselves had been newly
taught to read, were busy as bees in the midst of 6,000 scholars, teaching them
the wonderful lesson card and the art of reading.”-—(Dyson’s Samoan
Methodism, p. 19.)
But now this “ brilliant spring ” of the Mission was “ suddenly beclouded ”
with a night of storm, attended by retrogressive steps on the part of the Mission-
ary Committee, which were, and, we fear, always will be, inexplicable. Mr. I urner
had only been in Manono two months or more when Messrs. Platt and Wilson,
of the London Missionary Society, arrived, Mr. Platt remaining a year and Mr.
Wilson four years. One year after Mr. Turner’s arrival six other Missionaries
arrived from England and. settled in the group. A week after their ar-
rival Mr. Turner received a letter, in which they gave free expression to their
opinions, and exhibited a candour which was more pointed than polite. Mr.
Turner was told that his coming to Samoa was “ an unwarrantable intrusion.”
His conduct was “ ungentlemanly, not to say unchnstianlike,” and his work was


a direct attack upon them, in order to wrest from them the fruits of their
labours. (Dyson’s Samoan Methodism , p. 20.) Such an attitude, enforced
by such language greatly grieved Mr. I urner, and led him to seek the cause.
He was then informed that their attack was the outcome of an agreement be-
tween the Directors of the London Missionary Society on the one hand and
the Wesleyan Missionary Society on the other.
Now, what was the nature of this agreement ? That we may do the Rev.
John Williams no injustice, we quote his putting of the case. At a conference
held between the agents of the two Societies in the islands, the Revs. Nathaniel
Turner and William Cross “expressed a wish that, as the Fiji Islands were so
near to Fongatabu and politically connected with it, we should leave that field
open to them, and urged upon us the extent and importance of the Navigators
on the ground that the affinity of the language and other circumstances appeared
to assign that group to our Mission, and the Fijis to theirs. Feeling the great
importance of keeping our spheres of labour distinct, we readily acceded to
their proposition, and Mr. Barff and myself on the one part, and Mr. Turner and
Mr. Cross on the other, agreed that we should occupy the Navigators’ Islands,
and they bend their attention to the Fijis.” Such was the impression on the
mind of the Rev. John Williams, and conveyed by him to the authorities in
England. But who was responsible for such an arrangement, and how did it
originate ? It grew out of a conversation or Conference between Messrs. Wil-
liams and Barff and Messrs. Turner and Cross, in which they discussed their
work and policy. During this discussion Mr. Turner said to Mr. Williams; “I
understand that the Samoan dialect approximates much nearer to the Tahi-
tian, and, therefore, I should think that a much more likely field of labour for
your Teachers. I wish the Committee particularly to observe that what there
passed between us had exclusive reference to the native Teachers they had with
them.”—( Letter of Nathaniel Turner to General Committee, 10th August, 1837.)
And the Rev. Martin Dyson, who spent eight years in Samoa as a Wesleyan
Missionary, adds: “ Mr. Turner did not propose to give up Samoa to the London
Missionary Society, and to keep Fiji for his own Society; he made no pro-
position about this, but Mr. Williams supposed he had done, and consented to
that also. Now, since Mr. Turner made no such proposition, and would have
opposed it if anyone else had done so, he could not be said to have consented
to it. Therefore, there was no agreement between the parties concerning it.”
(p. 22.) But evidently Mr. Williams thought there was such an agreement,
and he led the General Committee to think so also. But it was afterwards
admitted by the General Committee that the agreement was made without
full knowledge of the condition of the Mission and without any knowledge of
the opinions and wishes of the Missionaries in the Friendly Islands. Hence
their decision, to which they honourably adhered, notwithstanding subsequent
developments which threw fresh light on this painful misunderstanding. But
it is difficult to understand why, even after this arrangement, Mr. Williams sent
two of his Teachers to Fiji. If the so-called agreement were binding on Peter
Turner and the Wesleyan Missionary Society it was no less binding on John
Williams and the London Missionary Society.—(See Wesleyan Chronicle , nth
February, 1864.)

ADELAIDE SISTERS’ HOME, KIRIWINA, NEW GUINEA.
For some time the Missionaries, however, attached small importance to
what had passed. Mr. Turner, with the Rev. Matthew Wilson, who joined him
in 1836, worked zealously on witnessing encouraging success. But on December
6th, 1837, the General Committee issued the following mandate:—“ That Mr.
P. Turner and colleague, or colleagues, who may have subsequently joined him
are affectionately but positively required to relinquish forthwith their opera-
tions in the Navigators’ Islands.” This left Mr. Turner no choice, and he pre-
pared, with much pain to himself and his people, for his departure. “ The sad
agreement nearly broke my heart,” he wrote ; “ Is it any wonder that I grew
grey prematurely, and got a head as white as flax at the age of forty ? If writ-
ing this in my blood would be the means of your retaining this Mission how
gladly would Ido it; or, if by prostrating myself on my bended knees before
you would avail, how would I rejoice to do it.” —(Letter to General Committee.)
His Brethren in Tonga were also much grieved. One of them said: “We
thought it impossible that our fathers should take such a step ” ; and in view of
such a belief they had appointed Air. Wilson to assist Air. Turner, hoping that
fuller information would lead the Committee to other conclusions. But it
failed. “We have made this engagement with the London Society, and our
honour is pledged before the Christian public; we cannot draw back.”


The Samoan Wesleyans were demented with grief, and they set them-
to retain their Missionaries, and thus defeat the purposes of the Commit-
P ro^es^ against the change. Mr. Turner says: “ I tore up the
Class Books and broke up the Schools. I did all in my power to get the people
to go over to the other Society (London Missionary Society), but all to no
effect. I invited some of the London Missionary Society’s Missionaries to be
present at one or two of the meetings where I spoke, and endeavoured to per-
suade our people to yield and to come over ; but all to no effect. If the London
Missionaries attempted to speak, our Chiefs became angry and said: ‘We will
not hear you, as you want to drive our Missionaries away from Samoa. We
will not Lotu to you. Mr. Turner and Mr. Wilson shall not go.’” Mr, Turner
also attempted to secure submission by a simple device, which hopelessly failed
Inviting Mr. McDonald to his Chapel he commenced the service, and then put
up Mr. McDonald to preach. But a Chief saw through it all; and after publicly
protesting twice he left the Chapel, followed by all the congregation, save only
Mr. Turner and his household. Eventually Mr. Turner, Mr. Wilson, the Tongan
Teachers, their wives and families, left in The Camden , 23rd May, 1839. The
natives sought to frustiate Mr. Turners departure, and they laid a plan to carry
him into the bush, and there detain him till The Camden had departed. But
he heard of it in time, and upset their plans. The Chiefs then determined to
hold a public Meeting at Manono to ascertain what request should be sent to
King George of Tonga. The meeting was attended by thousands, and thus as-
sembled they resolved to continue as Wesleyans, and to petition King George
to allow the Tongan Teachers to return to them and to supply them with more
Teachers until the Kings and Missionaries of Tonga should appeal to the Com-
mittee. They told Mr. Turner that he could have no love for them, or he would
not leave them, and that they could not join the other Missionaries. And ad-
dressing Joel, King George’s brother, the public spokesman said: “I beg you
will attend to me. . . . will Tonga throw us away? We are your friends,
your sons and your daughters. . . . and shall we be separated by the Lotu.
or by our Lotu relatives in England? No, No, No—Never let it be thus. But
what do we know of Tahiti? What communication had the Tahitians with us
or with Tonga? We only heard of Tahiti last night.” But it was throwing
words away. The Committee had, rightly or wrongly, made the agreement,
and though it could not, like Herod, break its promise, it could break up this
promising Mission. And from that time till the year 1857 Methodism was
adrift in Samoa, though not entirely without oversight. For five years the
Tongan Teachers themselves did their best to hold together the sheep without
a shepherd ; meanwhile continuing their request for another Missionary. Then
political intermeddling and tribal wars completed the break-up. Methodism
rapidly declined, the war brought again heathen abominations, the places of
worship in Upolu became empty, _ and either fell into the hands of the other
Society or perished. On Manono one Church was closed, and the other passed
to the London Missionary Society. In some other places Methodism fell into
contempt, was proscribed by the Chiefs and burnt out of the place. And at
this disheartening stage the Mission in Samoa must rest until it again claims at-
tention in connection with the Australian Conference proceedings.

CHAPTER XII.
COUNTRY METHODISM.
PARRAMATTA.
THE Rev. J. A. Manton was stationed at Parramatta in the year 1831.
And while he found, during his short stay on that Station, some
members whose spiritual state gave him much satisfaction and
“ exceeding joy ” the affairs generally were in a gloomy state.
The Rev. William Schofield succeeded him, remaining one year only.
The chief items of interest he records are a visit to Seven Hills,
a ‘ place entirely without the means of grace,” with a service in the Cor-
poration School Room ; and another service “ under favourable circumstances ”
in the new Chapel at One Tree Hill. The Rev. William Simpson followed Mr.
Schofield in 1835 ; his advent being marked by proposals for the erection of a
Mission House on land already in possession. On his removal the Station was
without a Missionary for a period of five months pending the arrival of the Rev.
D. J. Draper from England. Having spent a short time in Sydney, Mr. Draper
settled at Parramatta in June, 1836. The Mission generally, he says, was in
a very disorganised state. During the year occasional visits were made to Wind-
sor, Richmond, and Liverpool; and he found cause to mourn over want of suc-
cess. In the early part of the following year, Mrs. Draper was smitten with a
fatal illness. She died in perfect peace, and was buried in the vault wherein lay
the mortal remains of Mrs. Leigh and her own infant. Nathaniel Turner read
the burial service in the Chapel, and James Watkin preached the memorial
sermon. In May, 1839, he was able to write in a hopeful strain of the work.
The “ congregations are overflowing,” applications for sittings could not be met,
and plans for a new Chapel, 60 feet by 40 feet, were being prepared, their pre-
sent building, erected 16 years earlier by Walter Lawry, being then much too
small.
1 he nature of the work in the Circuit may be gathered from the following
sketch by Mr. Draper:—“ On Sunday morning, at 11 o’clock, I preach in the
Chapel at Parramatta; in the afternoon I ride, on an average, eighteen miles and
preach in the country. On Sunday evening, at half-past six, I preach in the
Chapel in town again. On Monday, I meet the female Class at four p.m., hold
a large prayer-meeting in the Chapel at seven, and frequently meet the Juvenile
Class afterwards. Tuesday, I hold a prayer-meeting in a private house at
seven, when many attend. Wednesday, Igo to Liverpool, visit the people, and
preach in the evening. Lriday evening, I meet a Class.” In his
report to the Missionary Committee bearing date May 19th, 1838,
he adds:—“ Our Sunday School is becoming more efficient than ever. One


hundred children were present last Sunday morning-, and eighty-five in the after-
noon. Ihe Teachers are actively engaged, and much good is anticipated. Last
week we closed our year’s accounts, when, after paying all the demands on the
school, including £lO paid for books given as rewards, there remained in the
hands of the Treasurer the sum of A 5 ns. 6d. Several ladies and gentlemen
were present at the examination of the children a fortnight ago, who expressed
themselves as being much pleased with their proficiency in the Scripture, Cate-
chisms, and Hymns. Their attainments in these respects were certainly far be-
yond my expectations ; and I hesitate not to say, that our Sunday School here
is the most efficient in the Colony. The day of the examination was indeed a
treat, both to children and to friends. After the examination and distribution
of rewards, the children were regaled with tea and cake under the spacious
verandahs of Mrs. Shelley’s house; and after being addressed by the Rev. J.
McKenny departed to their homes much delighted. The Teachers, with several
Ministers and friends, afterwards took tea together, and the greatest harmony
and Christian feeling prevailed.
I have just returned from attending the Missionary Meetings in the Wind-
sor Circuit, which went off very well, and a large sum of money was collected,
especially in the Lower Hawkesbury Branch. I have no doubt but this District
wih fully meet its own expenses in the course of a year or two ; and if we suc-
ceed in the application made to Government, of which I am aware the Chairman
has informed you, we shall be able to increase our numbers, and extend our
labours. The Governor, Sir G. Gipps, receives us most courteously, and appears
disposed to give us all the assistance we require. The Rev. S. Marsden died
on Saturday, the 12th inst., and was interred on Tuesday last. His funeral was
attended by an immense number of the most respectable Colonists, by whom he
was much venerated. He was seventy-three years of age, and had been Senior
Chaplain in the Colony between forty and fifty years. Next Sunday morning we
intend to close our Chapel, and, as a mark of respect to the memory of this vener-
able man, go to Church to hear his funeral sermon.”
Thursday, 19th September, 1839, was a “high day with the folks at Parra-
matta, says Mr. Orton. For on that date the new Chapel in Macquarie Street,
“ chaste and elegant ” in its decorations, was opened ; and the foundation stone
of another was laid. On the following Sabbath the good people made a day of
it; for at five a.m. a prayer meeting was held; at 11 Mr. Draper read the Morn-
ing Service, and the Rev. John McKenny preached “a very edifying sermon”
from the words: Thy Kingdom Come. The collection was A3l 2s. 6d. In the
evening Mr. Orton, who was on a visit, preached an excellent sermon on Balaam’s
exclamation; “How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and they tabernacles, O
Israel! ” The collection amounted to about AlB. At the close of the morning
service the greater part of the congregation proceeded to the other end of the
town to witness the laying of the foundation stone of the Centenary Chapel by
Hannibal McArthur, Esq., M.L.C. The neighbourhood in which the Centenary
Chapel was built was destitute of the means of grace. “A Popish Chapel is
the only place of worship, and the place presents an awfully gloomy appearance
as it regards both morals and religion.” Mr. Draper had been holding open

Parramatta.


air meetings on the spot for nine months, the allotment of land having been pre-
sented by Richard Rouse, Esq., to the Rev. S. Leigh and others for the use of
the Mission. The building was to cost £I,OOO, and a few friends headed the
subscription list with £IOO, as they were determined that the building should
not be delayed through want of funds. After prayer and the singing of a hymn
Mr. McArthur placed a bottle in the cavity containing the name of the donor of
the land, his own name, and the names of the President of the Conference, the
General Secretaries, the Chairman of the District, the Superintendent Minister,
and the Building Committee. Mr. McArthur delivered an address characterised
by piety and fervour, in which he sought to prove that Methodism in conjunction
with the Church of England presented the most powerful barrier then existing
against Popery. Mr. Draper also spoke for twenty-five minutes showing that
Methodism was Christianity in earnest. On its completion the Governor de-
clined to render any aid on the ground of the financial difficulties of the Colony.
But Messrs. James and William Byrnes met this difficulty by presenting the sum
! 7 S - to the Trustees “by means of which principally the heavy debt on
that place of worship has been entirely removed.” For this “ extensive and well
timed liberality” the District Meeting (1845) presented them with its “very sin-
cere and cordial thanks.”
Mr. McArthur had previously laid the foundation stone of the Chapel opened
that day, for which Christian act the Anglican Bishop had “ expressed himself
in very unhappy terms of censure.” 1 On the following Sabbath there was a
prayer meeting at 6.30; at n Mr. Draper read the Service, and the Rev.
Nathaniel Turner, who had arrived in the Colony a few days before, preached
in the newly opened Chapel from the words, “ There is joy in the presence of
God over one sinner that repenteth.” It was a most “ blessed sermon,” and the
collection exceeded £lO. In the afternoon he stood upon the foundation stone
of the Centenary Chapel, and cried: “Neither is there salvation by any other.”
At night the Rev. James Watkin preached to not less than 450 persons from the
words: “ The redemption of their souls is precious.” The collection amounted to
£l3, making a total of £72 Bs. for the opening ceremonies. The whole expense of
the Chapel was £1,530, its dimensions were 55ft. by 42ft, and it was predicted
that it would be free of debt in three months, having an annual income of £BO,
with every sitting let before the opening. The Sacrament followed the even-
ing service, in which fifty persons joined, and one soul entered into the enjoy-
ment of “ perfect love.” Happy was that soul; and happy the people ministered
to by the noble men above referred to. Four weeks afterwards Joseph Orton
preached again, when he says the congregation was poor, but the prayer meeting
in the vestry was “ lively.” 2
1 Bishop Broughton was a zealous Churchman, and a good man, but his narrow
intolerance did much towards destroying that brotherly feeling which had hitherto
existed between the Anglican Clergy and the Wesleyans. To their honour be it recorded
many of his people repudiated his Ritualistic deliverances.
2 Both Mr. Turner and Mr. Orton were remarkable preachers. Mr. Turner had a
powerful voice, which could be heard, it is said, a mile away. He had frequently to
stop in his preaching and come down from the pulpit to comfort penitents in distress.
When he “ fired up ”he generally made the candles fly. Joseph Orton was very pointed
in his appeals. He has been heard to say: “ I want ten of you, twenty of you, to come
to Christ to-night. You men and women sitting on the last form there, and that soldier
in the corner.” And they generally came. These were grand men, and they did much
for Methodism.


During this second visit Mr. Orton called at Captain Benson’s, where he met
Miss Catherine Byrnes, “ a convert from Popery to Protestantism, the account of
which has occasioned so much stir in the Colony.” As representing the cruel
and intolerant spirit of the Romish Church, and as proof of her proud boast that
she never changes, this incident is deserving of record. On account of her re-
nunciation of Popery, Miss Byrnes was under the necessity of leaving her home
in Ireland, when she came to this Colony with letters of introduction to Captain
Benson and entering his family and was placed under his guardianship.
She had been educated under the superintendence of priests, several of whom
were her relatives, her uncle also being a Bishop in the Church. In a letter, which
she published after her arrival, she exposed as “ much of their iniquitous pro-
ceedings as delicacy would allow ” ; for which she suffered ex-communication by
the Vicar-General, Bishop Ullathorne, and at once became a target for the
venomous darts of her persecutors.
Her enemies were not long in getting to work. For an excommunicated
person, any treatment was good enough! Returning from a service one morn-
ing to Captain Benson’s residence, situated two miles from Parramatta, she was
suddenly attacked by two ruffians when in a lonely part of the road. They
knocked her down, “ and were in the act of dragging her through a gap in the
fence, when her screams brought to her rescue a man who happened to be at no
great distance, who obliged the villains to fly,” without completing their mur-
derous designs. Is it necessary to add that these men were both Romanists,
and that they had just returned from Mass? The men were eventually taken
into custody and set down for trial at the Supreme Court on the sth November;
the case, however, being postponed to the following day. And now let the Rev.
Joseph Orton, from whose Journals these particulars are gathered, and who had
several interviews with Miss Byrnes, complete the story; “Miss Byrnes’ case
was tried to-day. The Attorney-General introduced it in a very fair manner.
The several witnesses proved the assault to have been a most atrocious one ; in
which no doubt her destruction was determined by these ruffian instruments of
Popery, whose abominations had been partially disclosed by Miss B. However,
Chief Justice Dowling summed up in a shamefully partial manner; acting in fact,
as special pleader for the prisoners. ... A crime which, in justice, called for
the sentence of death was punished with one year in an iron-gang. The other
day a gentleman’s assigned servant received precisely the same kind and amount
of punishment for a few words of insolence to his master. Mr. Justice Dowling
was annoyed that the case had not been decided at the Quarter Sessions and
therefore appeared to make it as trivial as possible.—(_ Journal s, vol. i., p. 325.)
During this visit also, Mr. Orton was present at the Local Preachers’ Meeting
on Wednesday, October 23rd; when “ young Watsford, the son of a coach
proprietor of that town, was received as a Local Preacher. He is a promising
young man.” John Watsford was converted under the ministry of the Rev. D.
f. Draper. After attending a prayer meeting in Macquarie Street Chapel, “he
trembled before God,” and thought he would “sink through the floor into hell.”
He joined the young men’s Class, and after six weeks of distress and bondage,
in which his mother thought he was going out of his mind, he entered an upper

REV. JOHN WATSFORD.
President of the Australian Conference.
The First Native Born Missionary.


room and prayed earnestly for pardon. In a moment, he says, he saw all his
sins laid on Jesus. And he thought that someone had spoken to him from
heaven and said: “ Thy sins, which are many, are all forgiven thee.” His joy
was very great. He was the first Australian born youth to enter the ranks of
the Ministry. Mr. Orton does not relate an amusing incident which probably
transpired at this Meeting, though Mr. Watsford tells it with apparent relish.
He was appointed to preach at Liverpool, and being somewhat deficient in the
power of song he took with him a new arrival who had great confidence in his
ability to lead the singing. The Hymn was announced and the “ new arrival ”
commenced. But he had evidently brought his tune with him, for it was quite
new to the congregation. “ There were eight or ten tunes,” says Mr. Watsford,
“ rolled into one. Of all the singing I ever heard that was about the worst.”
As Mr. Watsford could not restrain himself he “ burst out laughing,” and the con-
gregation laughed with him, all save one stern old Independent, “ who very
probably had never laughed in his life.” The matter was reported to
the Local Preachers’ Meeting. After hearing the explanation Mr.
Draper said, We had better go on to the next business ” ; and Mr. Orton re-
marked in solemn tones: “ Don’t do it again Brother.” He promised that he
never would, if he could help it!
The following year (1840) Mr. Draper left for Bathurst, being succeeded by
the Rev. John McKenny, who had Mr. James Dredge as his Assistant. Ii was
during the latter part of this year that the first remarkable revival took place.
It owes its origin to the following method adopted by three Local Preachers, of
whom John Watsford was one. They agreed every morning and evening, and
at midday to spend some time in pleading for an outpouring of God’s
Spirit; to observe Friday as a day of fasting and prayer; to sit together in
the meetings and to plead silently for the coming of the Holy Ghost. At the
end of three weeks their faith was honoured, for at the close of the Sunday even-
ing service people flocked from the Chapel to the Schoolroom for the prayer
meeting until the building was crowded. Sighs and suppressed sobs were heard
on every side. The Rev. John McKenny was pronouncing the benediction, when
he suddenly stopped and sobbed aloud. As soon as he was able he called out:
“Brother Watsford, pray.” He did pray, he says: and so did many others until
far into the night; it was twelve o’clock before the meeting closed. Many were
saved, among the number being several young persons, including a boy who
afterwards became President of the Victorian Conference. This gracious work
continued for many weeks. “ Some of the Local Preachers and Leaders in
Sydney and Parramatta were men of great spiritual power, men who believed
in prayer and fasting, and who did not depend upon a stranger coming now and
then to hold special services and bring sinners to Christ. They believed in the
Holy Ghost, and pleaded for His coming in connection with the ordinary ser-
vices. As a result, there were ‘ showers of blessing,’ glorious revivals, wonderful
displays of the Holy Spirit’s power in convincing and saving men. We used
often to see the whole congregation broken down and unable to leave the


Church ; and numbers, night after night, coming to the House of God and find-
ing salvation, and this no matter who was conducting the service.” —( Glorious
Gospel Triumphs , p. 20.)
Writing of those early days Mr. G. T. Hunt says: “ The services at St.
John’s were held on the Sabbath at n a.ra. and 3 p.m., the Wesleyan Services
at 11 a.m. and 6.30 p.m. The teachers and scholars of the Wesleyan Schools
attended the afternoon service at St. John’s regularly. They walked from the
Chapel to the Church in order, and took their seats together in the gallery.
This they did for years. In the Sunday School the three Misses Shelley and
others were teachers, and among the male teachers were Messrs. Hunt (Superin-
tendent), Byrnes, Howell, Mortimer, and Walker. Lessons were committed to
memory, examinations held yearly, and prizes awarded. Some of the scholars
recited so well on one occasion that they were invited to take part in a Sunday
School treat held in Princes Street Chapel, Sydney. They went, and acquitted
themselves well.” And Mr. Gilbert Smith adds; “ The Sunday School children
used to sit in what were called the free seats, being several long forms without
backs. The Trustees requiring space for pews the question arose: What was
the Sunday School to do? We wrote to the Trustees offering to collect the
money and erect a gallery for the school children ; if they would give us a
guarantee that it should be for the school alone, and never taken from them for
any purpose. The Trustees gave the guarantee, we collected the money, and
erected the present gallery.” The pillars of this gallery were taken out of old
St. John’s Church when that building was demolished.
This glorious revival soon made itself felt throughout the Circuit. “ Preach-
ing has been established,” said Mr. McKenny in 1842, “at Castle Hills, Toon-
gabbie and Dural. At the Cowpastures (now Camden) there is a glorious work
of God. There are three Classes ” with nearly fifty members and many more
who would join the Society if they had the advantage of regular pastoral care.
The congregations were large, and “ the whole country in that delightful District
is open for the Society’s operations.” A “ substantial brick Chapel,” 30ft. by
20ft., was then in course of erection at Camden, and would soon be completed.
This Chapel was opened in April, 1844, by the Rev. J. McKenny free of debt.
The Rev. Edward Sweetman, who succeeded Mr. McKenny in 1843, had Mr.
Francis Glass as a Hired Local Preacher to assist him in the Camden District,
when several additional places were opened for preaching. Mr. Sweetman was
also able to report in 1844 that a Tract Society had been formed at Parramatta.
“ The town is divided into Districts, and more than twenty persons are distribut-
ing in this way the truths of the Gospel.” Providence had also opened their way
at Campbelltown, a “ stronghold of Popery and Puseyism,” the services being
held in the “ commodious Court House.” “ Popish and Puseyite influence ” was
also felt at Parramatta, “ already proverbial for indifference to religion.”
Referring to the cause at Castle Hill, the Rev. William Schofield said that
“the past year (1846) had been one of great interest, as the neat stone Chapel
had been finished and paid for.” A temporary Chapel, to hold 75 people, had
been built “in about a fortnight by our own people ” at Dural. He had also

commenced public service on Friday afternoon at the Parramatta Jail, when
there were thirty or forty persons in attendance. The outlook in the Circuit
was so bright that the last Quarterly Meeting unanimously resolved to apply
for a second Preacher, as there was a handsome surplus in hand.
The following year, the Rev. Thomas Adams, who succeeded Mr. Scho-
field, reported the Society still in an improving state. At Dundas, they had
evident tokens of the presence of God among the people. The report of the
following year was equally encouraging. In Parramatta the Missionary had
been greatly encouraged by the evident tokens of God’s presence. Several
had been led by faith in the blood of Christ to enjoy a free, full and blessed
pardon. During the year “ a good commodious Chapel ” had been erected at
Baulkham Hills, and as the Chapel was well situated they were expecting still
further increase. The Rev. Benjamin Chapman was not able to write so hope-
fully in the following year, for he said that the review of the year furnished
reasons for unfeigned humiliation before God. Still they were cheered, as
they looked at the Circuit as a whole, by many indications which betokened
good. The Chapel in Macquarie Street was filled. Castle Hill was improving,
and at Kissing Point their desires had at length been realised in the erection
of a beautiful and commodious stone Chapel opened at the beginning of the
year. Service had also been commenced at Longbottom.
The improvement indicated at Kissing Point continued the year following.
“ The assemblies,” wrote the Rev. Nathaniel Turner, “ in our neat little Chapel
have been delightful; and such a year for prayer, praise and heavenly showers

MR. JOHN FALKINER.
Kissing Point was never before known. The Society has been doubled. The
new converts are chiefly from among the young.” Concluding his report, Mr.
Turner said that he felt it his duty to say that during the twenty-nine years
of his administration it had in several respects been one of the most comfort-
able of his life. He had dwelt amongst his own people and laboured in har-
mony with all his local brethren and office-bearers. Notwithstanding, his
anxious mind had not witnessed the success he desired ; yet he rejoiced to find
at the close of the year a happily united Church with a net increase of thirty-
two members with thirteen on trial.
The next year he lamented the interference with the work by the discovery
of gold. “ Business of every kind has been exceedingly dull, and it has pain-
fully operated upon the minds, and militated against the efforts of several of
our influential members. The discovery of the Bathurst goldfield, for a season,
threatened our congregations, classes and schools with ruin. The powerful
excitement has somewhat abated, and a gracious reviving influence is mani-
festly moving among us.” At Baulkham Hills it was still the day of small
things. Popery had firm hold on many, and others were injured by High
Church prejudices. Shortly after the District Meeting Mr. Turner’s health
failed, and as no one could be immediately sent to supply his place the work
suffered, until the Rev. Henry Gaud succeeded him, when he was able to con-
tinue what had been so well begun.


WINDSOR, 1832.
Windsor had now been without a Missionary for some time, and the cause
had nigh well disappeared. Mr. Hutchinson acted as temporary supply, and he
was soon followed by the Rev. William Simpson, whose first duty was to form a
Class of three members. The discouragements,” he says, “ are very great, owing
chiefly to the torpor of the people’s minds. They are altogether insensible to
then spiritual welfare, and it appears next to impossible to excite in them any
desiie for salvation. At Sackville Reach he found six members, with large,
attentive, and promising congregations The income was deplorable! The year
1 1 yielded a total of 10s. 3d.; being ss. 3d for Class money and 3s. ticket
money. The Mission House also was in a bad state. “It is exceedingly in-
com cnient, and the situation in many respects, which cannot in decency be
particularised, is extremely bad.” Under Mr. Simpson’s fostering care an
improvement soon took place. In 1833 he reported to the District Meeting that
the Society shewed an increase ; while the Class meetings had been visited “ with
the quickening influences of the Divine Spirit.” At Richmond the Society was
steadily improving, though he saw reason to deplore “ a w T ant of fixedness of
purpose and determination of mind among the people.”
In the year 1833 the Rev. William Schofield, who had successfully laboured
at Macquarie Harbour, succeeded Mr. Simpson, and he saw the desire of his
heart; for the work of God prospered. The improvement, however, did not
altogether satisfy the General Committee, for in 1833 it expressed its deep
regret at the comparatively unproductive state of Windsor and Parramatta, sug-
gesting their abandonment. To this proposal the District Meeting could not
agree, as it considered there were indications of improvement. And these indica-
tions were fulfilled; so much so that in 1836 the District Meeting reported its
intention of erecting a substantial brick Chapel 30ft. by 40ft. at a cost of T6OO,
towards which they asked for a grant of if 100, to which they hoped to add
another £ 100 by subscriptions. 3 Mr. Schofield was also the medium through
which the residents of the Lower Hawkesbury asked for the appointment of a
Missionary; promising Tl3O annually towards his support. In a lengthy
memorial bearing the signatures of George Turnbull, M. J. Everingham, D. B.
Kirwan, and J. Cotton, the schoolmaster, who in compliance with a resolution
passed at a public meeting held in the Sackville Chapel (January 9th, 1837}
forwarded the request, it was set forth that “ Upon a very moderate computation
it may be said that there are upwards of eleven hundred souls (Protestant) within
the limits of this District occupying a surface of, perhaps, 60 miles in circum-
ference, whose spiritual destitution may be imagined when it is known that
from Sackville Reach to the extremity of the river there is but one Minister of
Religion: a Clergyman of the Church of England to administer the ordinances
of religion to the Whites. We forbear to mention the difficulties to be encoun-
tered by a resident Missionary with respect to the roads and ways of communi-
cation with the respective places of this contemplated Missionary station ; as we
are sure these things are but of little importance to you ; and as your truly excel-
3 These dimensions were afterwards altered


lent and indefatigable colleague, the Rev. William Schofield, is well able from
personal experience to give you every information on this subject.” The
District Meeting strongly supported this appeal, and Mr. Schofield wrote in high
terms of praise of the liberality of the people at Sackville Reach and Lower
Portland Head. The request was not, however, immediately granted.
In his first report to the Missionary Committee (October 14th, 1835) Mr.
Schofield writes: —“ In making up the list of subscriptions to the Wesleyan
Missionary Society, I am glad to find, that there has been a considerable improve-
ment this year, as well as in the preceding one ; which year was the first that I
laboured here, when an increase of £ls 3s. 3jd. took place, making a total of
A4l igs. lojd. ; and this year there is an increase of £ 2O, making about £62.
Our receipts from the Classes also have been doubled within this period ; for
which I feel thankful to God and more attached to the people ; for these contri-
butions may be regarded as a proof that as they become acquainted with our
doctrines, by attending upon the public services, they are better disposed to
assist in carrying on the good work. I hope that, when the second Preacher
arrives for Sydney, and I shall no longer be under the necessity of going thither,
or to Parramatta, every alternate Sunday, as I have hitherto had to do, the cause
here will prosper in proportion as the spiritual wants of the people are more
adequately met by the preaching of the Gospel.
“ On the 25th of the preceding month I left home at an early hour to go
down the Hawkesbury River, a distance of nearly fifty miles, that I might
preach at Mr. G. Everingham’s in the evening, but the wind and tide being
against us a considerable part of the way, and the persons who had to pull in
the boat not being very strong, we did not arrive till eight o’clock, so that the
congregation had gone away. I was, however, requested to preach the following
morning at eight o’clock ; and, considering the short notice and the unfavourable
time, the service was well attended ; the people were very attentive, and expressed
their pleasure at having had an opportunity of hearing the Word of God. I have
promised to visit them again. In this journey, another awful instance of human
depravity presented itself in the want of parental affection ; two small female
children having been abandoned by their father, who had resided at a place down
the river called the Bar. They were left without relative, friend, or neighbour
near them, and with only as much bread for their support as was sufficient for
one meal; and during the three following days they had to live upon oysters,
which they broke off from the rocks. In this state, without bed, or almost any-
thing to cover them during the night, they were prividentially found by William
Johnson, and brought to Mr. Everingham, I suppose a distance of fifty miles.
Ele kindly took one, and Mr. William Friday, another of our members, the other;
so that they are now provided for. Had they not been found, it is probable that
they would have been discovered by the Aborigines and cruelly used, or devoured
by the wild native dogs.”
Though Mr. Schofield met with some success he felt that the work was
impeded by his frequent exchanges, against which he protested to Mr. Orton,
but without success. On May Bth, 1838. Mr. Orton, in company with the Rev.

J. Watkin and Mr. Lancelot Iredale, who provided a carriage for the occasion,
attended the Missionary Meeting. “ Not very lively,” writes Mr. Orton ; though
it appears that Mr. Schofield has been rendered very useful in this part.”
While in this district Mr. Schofield had an experience not uncommon in those
days. Proceeding to Sydney through Parramatta one Sunday morning, and
having passed the toll-bar about half a mile past Mr. Macarthy’s gate, three
bushrangers suddenly confronted him. One seized the horse’s head, another
presented a pistol at Mr. Schofield, while the third approached Mrs. Schofield,
demanding to know what they had in their possession. The thieves appropriated
Mr. Schofield s watch and 3s. 6d. in coin. During this experience Mr. Schofield
says that his mind was calm and he felt enabled “ to say a few words to them on
the sinfulness of their proceedings.” Shortly after he was summoned to Sydney
by Mr. Rossi, the Police Magistrate, to identify a suspect. But he could not fix
the culprit for the all-sufficient reason that the magistrate had arrested the wrong
man. The residents of the Lower Hawkesbury had their request granted in the
appointment, of Mr. Schofield, his place at Windsor being filled by the Rev.
Samuel Wilkinson. In his first report to the District Meeting, which met in
January, 1839) Mr. Wilkinson said that after his six months’ experience he saw
that the members in “ this ungodly town ” were growing in grace. At Richmond
he found that the majority of the inhabitants attended “ no place of worship.”
At Castlereagh, where no service had been held for some time, matters presented
a better aspect than they have done for years.”
At the next District Meeting he was able to report the opening of their
new Chapel, the foundation stone of which was laid on October 17th, 1838, by
the Rev. W. Schofield, and was “an occasion of no small interest.” “It was
opened for Divine Worship,” the District Minutes report, “ on Tuesday, Decem-
ber 4th, 1839. The Rev. J. McKenny preached in the morning and the Rev.
j. Orton in the evening. In the afternoon a public Prayer Meeting was held.
Notwithstanding the efforts which the Episcopalian Minister of Windsor had
made both in private and in public to prevent any with whom he had any
influence, attending, the congregations were large and respectable, among whom
we observed many of the members and hearers of the Church of England. We
are thankful to add, every seat of the Chapel is now taken, and when all the
moneys which we confidently expect are received, the Chapel will be completely
out of debt. Its dimensions are 50ft. by 30ft. in the clear, 21ft. high inside.
A substantial brick building generally admired for the convenience and comfort
of its accommodations and the plainness and neatness of its architecture. The
cost of erection has been about Ai,020.”
Mr. McKenny preached an appropriate sermon on “The Worship of God”
and Mr. Orton took for his text I. Thess, v., 20 v. On the day following- the
opening ceremonies Mr. McKenny, with Mr. Orton and Mr. Wilkinson called
upon the Anglican Clergyman, the Rev. Mr. Stiles, to ascertain the correctness
of the reports of the sermon he had preached against the Wesleyans at Richmond
and Windsor. “ After a tedious discussion,” says Mr. Orton, “on several irrela-
vent points, Mr. Stiles consented to read a part of his sermon, which turned
out to be much more severe than had been reported.” Not for its intellectual


merit, but as a specimen of the teaching of men of Mr. Stiles’ type the outline
is worth reproducing. Text; “ Now 1 beseech you , brethren , mark them
which cause divisions and offences contrary to the doctrine which ye have
learned ; and avoid them!' Rom., 16th chap., 17th verse. Introductory remarks
relating to divisions in the Church. I. Mark or recognise those who cause divi-
sions: (1.) Show the Church of England to be the True Church. (2.) What is
implied in Schism? (3.) Who have occasioned divisions and are Schismatics?
ihe Wesleyans. Mr. Wesley had some good qualities, but he was a most irregu-
lar man. He had, however, determined never to leave the Church. His followers
and successors had abandoned the principles of their Founder and were going
farther. They take salaries, administer Sacraments, marry, etc. They seduce
from the Church, particularly by sending round inviting attention to the opening
of their Chapel. 11. Avoid them: (1.) Come out from them. (2.) Give them no
countenance. (3.) Afford them no support. (4.) Do not attend the opening of
their new Chapel, etc. “So much,” adds Mr. Orton, “ for the Christian liberality
of this junior Clergyman!” But this opposition was a splendid advertisement,
for Mr. Wilkinson adds: “The things which have happened have fallen out
rather to the furtherance of His cause amongst us than otherwise.” Some of
the residents, at least, must have appreciated the teaching of the “ Schismatics,”
for that same year two successful Girls’ Schools were established at Windsor and
Richmond, “ much to the satisfaction of the Parents.” The Mission House
situated in George Street was also disposed of, the net proceeds being £ 1,943
1 os. Bd. Towards the erection of the new building, the foundation stone of which
was already laid, they expected to receive Government aid to the extent of ASOO.
Meanwhile Mr. Schofield was busily engaged on the lower portion of the
Hawkesbury. In his first District Meeting report (January, 1839) he wrote:
“We are happy to say that the religious state of our Society in this newly
formed Circuit is encouraging. The members are alive to God, punctual in their
attendance upon the means of grace which they prove to be wells of salvation,
and thus renewing their strength they have fruit unto holiness. . . . The
congregations are very good except at Colo, which is much worse than formerly,
occasioned by the opposition of the Episcopal Minister, whose injurious influence
it is difficult to counteract from the distance of the place. ... At Sackville
Reach a New Chapel has been built during the year of larger dimensions than
the old one.” On one of his trips to the Mac Donald River Mr. Schofield organised
the first Class at the close of the afternoon service (February 3rd, 1839), the
members being Mr. J. J. Walker and his wife, Mr. Aaron Walters and his wife,
George Thompson, Jane Thompson, and James Walker. One of these members,
John Joseph Walker, is worthy of special mention as the pioneer of Methodism
in that District. He was sometimes called “ The Apostle of St. Albans.” Born
in Sydney in 1810, sent either to Princes Street or Macquarie Street Sabbath

I he Rev. F. Lewis, who now took charge of the Mission at Windsor, was
greatly honoured by God in the salvation of the people. For it pleased the
Great Head of the Church, he said, to answer the prayers of His Church, to
bless the labours of His servants, and to enlarge the borders of their little Zion
Believing that all the promises are Yea and Amen in Christ Jesus, they appointed
special prayer meetings for intercession and pleading for a revival of religion.
1 he God of Elijah heard, and the droppings of the shower fell upon all parts
of the C ircuit ; but they were looking for its bursting, when the residue of the
Spirit should descend in all His fertilising influences, converting the sterile
wilderness into a fruitful field, and making the desert as the Garden of the Lord
“ In the proverbially drunken and ungodly town of Windsor ” the Class had
been divided into four by the additions of new members. Richmond
had prospered, and Castlereagh was rising in importance. Here there were
thirty members. They “ are generally poor, but a more liberal, heavenly-minded
people I have never seen,” states Mr. Lewis. Penrith was receiving services
every Sunday, and the house in which they worshipped was thronged, many
being compelled to stand in the open air. A Class with sixteen members had
been formed.
Mr. Lewis was now (1841) assisted by the Rev. John Watsford, who was
appointed Assistant Missionary, and between them they had charge of Windsor
and the Lower Hawkesbury, and the good work continued. The Holy Spirit
frequently came mightily upon the people, so that they were compelled to con-
tinue their meetings far into the night. There were many remarkable cases of
conversion, the publicans losing some of their best customers. Of course they
were angry and did all they could to hinder the work and to annoy the workers.
But they miserably failed. Their opposition became a useful aid in the form of
an advertisement. One publican sought to annoy Mr, Watsford whenever he
passed his house by crying after him: “ Amen. Hallelujah. Bless the Lord.”
And a storekeeper got so angry at something Mr. Watsford did not say that he
resolved to hear for himself; so that, if the preacher erred in speech he could
take him to task. But the arrow of conviction struck him ; and at the service
that evening he fell from his seat to the floor, “ literally roared for mercy,” and
was set at “glorious liberty.” Four months after he died a triumphant death.
The Sabbath School also participated in this blessed work. One Sabbath
afternoon about seventy young persons, in ages ranging from eight to sixteen,
gathered in great distress, while Mr. Watsford and the Superintendent prayed
for them. Forty years afterwards Mr. Watsford met one of these children
in England. She spoke of her conversion that day, when six years of age.
At Castlereagh the commencement of this work must be traced to two
women, Mrs. Byrnes, the wife of a selector, and Mrs. Lees, the wife of John Lees,
junr., who resolved to meet together in weekly prayer for the conversion of their
husbands. The Rev. F. Lewis, who was greatly cheered by this indication of
spiritual activity, applied to the Rev. John McKenny for a Schoolmaster who
would instruct the children throughout the week and preach to the adults on the
Sabbath day. Mr. James Rutledge with his brother and sister, having recently
arrived from Ireland (October, 1810), where he had witnessed the revivals in

connection with the Centenary Celebrations, the post was offered to him ; and
after a tour of inspection with Mr. Lewis, when Mr. Rutledge conducted service,
he accepted the position. On that occasion Mr. Lewis said in the concluding
prayer: “Lord, if Thou wilt not come with him, let him not come,” a petition
of which the congregation felt the wisdom and the force. Of his surroundings
Mr Rutledge wrote; “The social and moral character of the population was
without parallel in any other country that I know of.” The Sabbath day was
openly set at nought, and when John Lees, returning from a preaching appoint-
ment one Sabbath afternoon, gave expression to his righteous indignation at
the sight of Sir John Jamieson’s assigned servants working in his vineyard, he
was afterwards required to attend the Police Court to explain why he had
endeavoured to excite the convict servants to disobey the orders of their master.
But nothing unlawful could be proved against him. John Lees was so jealous
for the sanctity of the Sabbath that he took one of his own servants to court for
milking the cows on the Sabbath, during his absence and against his orders.
“ Concubinage, too,” to quote Mr. Rutledge again, “ was shockingly prevalent ;
but there were those who, notwithstanding these evil influences, maintained an
upright character and carefully preserved their families from contact with
immoral persons.”
One of Mr. Rutledge’s first acts was to call a meeting of “ the neighbours
that seemed seriously disposed ” to arrange for a tea-meeting and special prayer.
Mrs. Gorman, Mrs. John Lees, junr., Mrs. Stanton, and Mrs. Byrnes bore the
entire cost of the tea meeting. The Friday preceding was observed as a day of
fasting and prayer. Mr. Lewis’ heart was full to overflowing. “ More manifest
displays of Divine Grace I never saw before,” continues Mr. Rutledge. “ For
months after the Lord added weekly to our Church such as had given their
hearts to God. One Sabbath evening after the service many of the people
remained to spend the time in praise to God. I never can forget the feeling
that prevailed while we sang:
1 Suffice that for the season past
Hell’s horrid language filled our tongues;
We all r l hy words behind us cast
And lewdly sang the drunkard’s song=.


But O the power of grace Divine !
In hymns we now our voices raise
Loudly in strange Hosannas join,
And blasphemies are turned to praise. ’
All felt that more appropriate words could not be used to express that change
so many experienced.” At the first Local Preacher’s Meeting held in the Wind-
sor Circuit, the place of meeting being Richmond, there were four persons pre-
sent, says Mr. Rutledge—Mr. Lewis a Welshman, himself an Irishman, Mr. John
Crisford an Englishman, and Mr. William Chaucer a Scotchman.
The Lower Hawkesbury shared in these showers of blessing. At a house
then called Green’s, “ when we went to prayer at the opening of the service,”
says the Rev. John Watsford, “ the power of God so came upon us that the
people could not rise again from their knees for two or three hours. What a
time it was! All seemed broken down; many were saved. One peculiarity
about the place was that many who came to service there had to stay all night,
for they came from afar. The people of the place gladly provided for all who
came, and provision had often to be made on a large scale.” Among the young
men converted there were George Douglass and John Laughton, who became
Local Preachers, and died, the former in 1902, and the latter one year earlier,
after fifty years’ service in their Church. It was a common practice for these
men and other Local Preachers in that Circuit to travel fifty miles to a preaching
appointment, pulling in their boat or walking the whole distance. The land at
this spot was afterwards given to the Mission by Mr. George Everingham on
which to build a Chapel. 5 Mr. Everingham, who was born on December 3rd,
1799, began to preach in 1828, and was frequently spoken of as the
first Australian-born youth to become a Local Preacher. Though
he always walked to his appointments, and sometimes took three
days to do it, he was never known to disappoint his con-
gregation. He did all he could to further the cause of Christ, his generosity
even extending to the entertainment of a Romish Priest. On this occasion Mr.
Everingham asked the Priest to conduct family prayers, but he excused himself
by saying: “No, no, you, you, Everingham; you pray!” “These were true
revivals,” proceeds Mr. Watsford. “ The fruit soon appeared in changed lives,
in earnest work for Jesus, and in cheerful giving to His cause. What collections
we used to have! At one of our Missionary Meetings at Castlereagh, Mrs.
Gorman brought in her Missionary box. She had collected all the year and had
the silver changed for gold. When the box was at last opened, sovereign after
sovereign rolled out, until we counted forty. At one of our meetings Mr. Lewis
and I had to stop the people in their giving. We positively refused to take any
more.” —(Glorious Gospel Triumphs , pp. 23-8.)
The Chapel at Richmond was now too small for the growing congrega-
tions, and in 1842 the primitive building erected in Mr. Harper’s time dis-
appeared. “ Our new Chapel was opened for Divine Service on Tuesday, the
20th August, by the Brethren Hurst and Tuckfield, who preached two excellent
discourses on the occasion. The congregations were good and the collections
6 This old building, which stands intact to-day, was thoroughly renovated in 1903.


highly satisfactory. At Regentville, Sir John Jamieson having kindly given
about 2| acres of land, a neat School House has been erected upon it, and Divine
Service is now regularly performed in the neighbourhood.” The Rev. Jonathan
limes succeeded Mr. Lewis, and he found his hands full in consolidating and
developing the gracious work his predecessors had witnessed. Some few fell
awa y> but the majority continued steadfast and immovable. “Several new
Chapels,” says Mr. Innes to the District Meeting of 1845, “are loudly called for.
At Lower Portland Head one is determined on. At Kurrajong one is being
built; it is not likely to be burdened with debt.” To enable the Missionaries to
carry on their work they had received gifts of land from Mr. G. Everingham at
Lower Portland Head, Mr. Thomas John at Kurrajong, and Mr. John
Tindall at Penrith. “At Castlereagh the old Chapel is in a dilapidated state,
being much too straight for the congregations. A new one will be commenced
forthwith.” The Sabbath and Day Schools at Richmond, Windsor, and Castle-
reagh were in a flourishing state. “Tn no place have we greater prosperity than
at Castlereagh.”
In 1846* Rev. J. McKenny reported that during the year the Windsor
Circuit had been much disturbed by designing and bad men, though their
designs had been brought to naught and their hopes disappointed. During
his second term at Windsor, Mr. Schofield, who succeeded Mr. McKenny, prose-
cuted his work vigorously, visiting Richmond, Castlereagh, Lower Portland
Head, and the Mac Donald River. The following year was one of severe trial
to many people in the Circuit, consequent upon the failure of the wheat crop
on which they were dependent for several months’ supply. Some were reduced
to a state of actual want, while others were compelled to leave the Circuit and
to seek their means of support in more favourable places. At Castlereagh the
new Chapel was opened during the year by the Rev. F. Lewis, but owing to
the unprecedented depression, it had not been completed, though the people
were doing what they could. The opening of this Chapel took place on
Wednesday, 16th, and Sunday, 20th February, 1848, the Rev. J. McPhee taking
the service on the Sabbath Day. The new building was 40 ft. by 24 ft.,
and was to cost the amount realised at the tea and opening service being
between £2 5 and A3O. It was reported that Mr. Lewis preached an excellent
sermon, and that 250 persons sat down to tea. At the Public Meeting, Mr.
J. Ducker presided, and addresses were delivered by Mr. Travis and the Revs.
Millard, F. Lewis, and W. Schofield. The last sermon in the old Chapel was
preached by the Rev. John Pemell.
The following year Mr. Schofield was able to give greater attention to
that part of his Circuit included in the lower part of the Hawkesbury and the
Macdonald Rivers. At the Macdonald River he regularly conducted service in
the small Chapel built by the people for the accommodation of all Protestant
denominations. During the year, four of their members had been called on, he
said, to meet their last enemy, among the number being Mrs. Schofield, who
suffered a long affliction; John Lees, of Castlereagh; Mrs. Chaseling; and
Richard Dyer, a Local Preacher, who died in peace after a short illness.

MR. GEORGE EVERINGHAM.
The first A atioe-born Local Preacher.
Ihe next year Castlereagh was reported as doing well. The members
were alive to God, and striving together for the faith of the Gospel. The congre-
gation was good, and the new Chapel was out of debt. Nothing of importance
now transpired for two or three years, beyond an exhibition of Missionary zeal
at Castlereagh. Early in 1855, the resident Minister handed to four godly
women a Missionary box each, requesting them personally to canvass neigh-
bours and friends for two or three miles around. When the time came for hold-
ing the Missionary Meeting at noon on Wednesday, the little Chapel was
more than crowded; the speakers for the occasion being the Revs. Peter
Turner, John Watsford, Thomas Angwin, and R. W. Vanderkiste, the two
former, who had recently arrived from the Islands, and the latter from England.
The Chair was taken by Mr. Thomas Cowlishaw, of Sydney. “ Never was
a Christian company warmed by a hotter Missionary fire. While the collection
•of T2B was being counted, the contents of the four Missionary boxes were
announced as £ll, £l3. £36, and A4O, mostly in gold, the total being over
£lOl, and this from a few small farm leaseholders. This was a record at the
time, and probably during the fifty years that have past, numbers and circum-
stances considered, it has not been excelled. To the honour of John Lees’
personal influence and example it should be added that the £4O box had been
carried round, besides being personally watched by his devout and energetic
daughter, Mrs. Gorman.”


ILLAWARRA.
The first Ministerial visit to Wollongong of which any record is available
was made by the Rev. William Schofield, who left home on October ;th, 1839.
During his trip he visited Dapto, “ preached and met the members, including
those on trial, 16 in number. They are in want of half a dozen of our hymn
books. Mr. Robinson informed me that Mr. Bursell, of Campbelltown, had
offered a piece of ground to build a Chapel upon. From Mr. Vidler, whom I
appointed as Leader of the Dapto Class, I learned that he and a few friends had
formed a Sunday School at his house, and though it was in its infancy they had
37 scholars names on the books, and that the average attendance of the children
is about 2;. It is necessary to forward the Rules of the Society to the respec
tive Classes.” This visit was made at the instigation of members of the Black-
family, who had recently arrived from Ireland, presenting their tickets of mem-
bership to Mr. Schofield at Princes Street. Sailing from Wollongong they
weie entertained by Mr. Robert Osborne. Young Mr. Black having occasion
to visit Sydney returned with Mr. Schofield, for whom Mr. Osborne also found
a home. And Mr. Schofield was permitted by Mr. Meares, the Anglican Clergy-
man, to preach in his Church on the following Sunday at 3 o’clock.
Referring to this visit, the District Meeting of the same year said “ This
part of the country is rapidly increasing in population, and demands the atten-
tion of the Committee. We have a Class at Wollongong, and numbers of emi-
grant Wesleyans are scattered over the District; they are now destitute of the
means of grace which they enjoyed so richly in their native land ; and unless
the Committee do more for this country, they must continue destitute. The
Chairman is about to visit the place and will report.”
This report said;—•“ Until the Chapel can be raised a temporary place is
prepared for the accommodation of the congregation. Mr. Robinson, a gentle-
man from Ireland, who was long a Local Preacher and Leader in his native
land, has taken charge of this infant cause for the present. He is assisted in
his labours of love by a Mr. Cox, a very excellent young man from Ireland. And
we affectionately beg the attention of the Committee to this rich and beautiful
District, which may be called the Garden of New South Wales. A consider-
able number of members reside in the neighbourhood, who regularly meet in
Class.” In 1840 the District Meeting reported that at Wollongong “Mr.
Thomas Osborne, a zealous member of our Society from Ireland,” has pre-
sented sufficient land for a Chapel and dwelling-house ; and Mr. Schofield adds:
“ Our prospects are very flattering. We have three Classes and attentive con-
gregations.”
The Society in the District now resolved to make formal application for
a Missionary, and in a joint letter to the District Meeting it saidOn the
present occasion we need not enter into details relative to our application for a
Preacher, as heretofore this subject has been laid before you. In addition to
this the Rev. W. Schofield, from his several visits to this District, has acquired
such knowledge as we think will satisfy your minds of the necessity of sending a
Missionary to labour in this part. Though Methodism is in its infancy here,

yel there is every prospect of its success through the instrumentality of faith-
ful Ministers, who may expect every assistance from the few Local Preachers
and Leaders in the District. In expectation of this we are now erecting a
good temporary preaching house, 30ft. by 16ft., which we hope will be finished
in a short time. As we are given to understand that about A3O per annum will
be required for the Preacher’s salary, exclusive of his board and lodging, with
feed for his horse ; notwithstanding the depressed state of the time and the
few from whom we expect to receive Class and ticket money, yet we agree to
meet the above demand.” I here were then 64 members of Society with four on
trial, and they wished their proposed Circuit to include Wollongong, Dapto, Fairy
Meadow, Marshall Mount, Jamberoo, and Kiama. The Chapel, a strong slab
building capable of seating 200 persons was opened in 1842.
Who were these pioneers of Methodism in the Illawarra District? Messrs.
Robinson and Cox have been referred to, but prominent among them all was
John Vidler, appointed Leader of the Dapto Class by Mr. Schofield on his first
visit. Born in Kent (England) in 1800, John Vidler was converted at the age of
19 years under the ministry of the Rev. John Smith, who placed his hand on
his head saying; “God bless this lad.” Previously associated with a gang of
smugglers, his conversion, which was followed by a joy rich and full, was unmis-
takable. At once he felt concern for his relatives, most of whom were soon
converted through his efforts, among the number being an uncle known as
“ the Socinian Vidler of London.” He became a Local Preacher in the Sand-
hurst Circuit for 19 years. John Vidler’s father first objected to his son’s con-
tinual absence at night through Church work, and as a protest he locked the
door, and John Vidler was forced to make his bed on a haystack, while the snow
- *
lay round him. The next Sunday night his father, who accompanied him to
Ins preaching appointment, was converted, thus passing from Unitarianism to
Methodism. He left England in The Maitland in 1838, thinking that he could
make a living in Australia, preaching on the Sabbath as he had done in Eng
land. On his arrival in Sydney he sought out the Rev. J. Watkin. who received
him most kindly ; and after two weeks he left for Albion Park under engage
ment to Mr. Terry Hughes to work on his property. He held his first service
some time before Christmas, 1838, in his own hut, built of blankets on a rough
frame work ; his congregation being his wife:, himself, and his brother James.
Holding occasional services at Daptc he met Mr. William Bursell and Mr.
Robinson, who had been praying for the arrival of a Wesleyan, so they said,
for seven years. Next year he took a farm at Dapto, preaching regularly in his
own house. A revival soon broke out, when thirty persons were converted and
formed into a Society which Mr. Vidler met. The first Societ} 7 Class and Sun-
day School throughout the District were both formed at Dapto ; while to Wollon-
gong falls the honour of possessing the first Chapel. Mr. Vidler
also conducted services in Mr. H. Osborne’s house. During his second year
in that District a young woman from Jamberoo, afterwards Mrs. Gay, said to
him: “ I want you to come and preach at Jamberoo, for the Word of God is not
in all the place.” He preached in a house near Mr. Fry’s, to a congregation
of seven persons. Praying in the bush that same morning for one soul, he was


diiected to the house of Thomas Gower, who found the Saviour, and straightway
arranged for a service in his house that evening, at which others were con-
verted. Some time after, he conducted a service at Mr. Armstrong’s
house near Jamberoo. I hese efforts for the salvation of the people soon pro-
voked persecution, which fell on Mr. Vidler. The Anglican Clergyman at
Wollongong persuaded Mr. Gerrard not to rent his farm to Mr. Vidler for
another term, as he was “ doing a great deal of harm by taking away his congre-
gation ; and though Mr. Vidler offered to double the rent Mr. Gerrard remained
obdurate, and the Methodist Local Preacher had to go. Mr. Tlenry Osborne
sought to come to his rescue, offering him any farm on his estate free of rent
for life ! But he could not accept this magnanimous proposal, and he there-
fore settled at “ Bradley Park,” Campbelltown, where he remained for seven or
mght years, forming a Society Class and preaching in his own house until the
Chapel was built.
In 1839, or thereabouts, Mr. Vidler paid a visit to Coolangatta, where he
met Mr. David Berry, to whom he said; “ Sir, my errand to this part of the
country is to see if I can find a Christian man or stuff enough to make one.”
Mr. Berry invited him to preach, and at 2 o’clock he spoke to 80 persons, most
of them Government men. At the close of the service a poor woman, a
Romanist, entreated him to visit her husband, as she had been to the Priest and'
he refused to come because she had not paid her dues! The poor fellow on
bended knee wished to know what penance “ his Reverence ” would lay on him.
He expected it would a weighty one! But John Vidler told him to stand to his
feet, while he quoted the 53rd Chapter of Isaiah and expatiated on the virtues
oi the Blessed Virgin s Son. Removing from Campbelltown he returned to
Dapto, and often accompanied the Missionaries to their appointments, travelling
on one occasion with the Rev. Benjamin Hurst to Mr. Thomas Black’s at Gerrin-
gong. fi Mr. Vidler continued to render invaluable service to Methodism in the
Illawarra District, leaving behind him, at the close of a long life, many hallowed
memories and a splendid record of work.
Another devoted layman who did yeoman service was Mr. John Graham/of
“ Avondale.” Converted in early life, John Graham arrived in this country
from the North of Ireland in 1844 with his wife and family, settling at Marshall
Mount, where he remained for two years. He then removed to “ Avondale,”
where he resided till his death in 1882. On settling at Marshall Mount in con-
junction with other Methodists he established services, Mr. I. Morris, of
Bowral, preaching in a building lent by Mr. Henry Osborne. Subsequently a suit-
able Chapel was built on a site given by Mr. Osborne, where the Public School now
stands ; and from this humble beginning Methodism at Marshall Mount takes
its origin. Mr. Graham was indefatigable in connection with the building;
While 011 this trip they had an amusing experience. Calling at a house for break
last they were informed that there was no bread, and little if any food. Seeing some fowls
wandering about Mr. Hurst inquired who owned them. “ They are ours,” said the woman,
“but we cannot catch them, as they fly in the bush.” With the lady’s permission Mr.
Hurst secured a broomstick, asking Mr. Vidler which bird they should have. Mr. Vidler
expressed his preference for “that white rooster,” which Mr. Hurst laid low wdth one
fatal blow. Mr. Vidler dug some potatoes, Mr. Hurst cooking the bird, and seasoned
with the sauce of hunger they feasted right royally.

lesting not until the expense was liquidated. He was equally indefatigable at
Dapto. where a congregation had been gathered and a Chapel built on a site
also given by Mr. Osborne ; who always maintained a friendly attitude towards
Methodism. To a liberality almost beyond his means, and a wisdom tempered
by discretion, Mr. Graham added “ labours more abundant.” Courage and
earnestness were marked features of his character; and everywhere he fearlessly
witnessed for the Master. The creed of his audience seldom troubled him, and
Romanists often received reproof and exhortation ; but his singleness of pur-
pose commanded their attention and respect. In 1859 his friend, Mr. Osborne,
died. Always a welcome visitor, Mr. Graham was doubly so during
his illness; and his ministrations, supported by the Rev. J. Watkin’s
visit, were owned of God in Mr. Osborne’s peaceful and triumphant death.
Realising the value of services such as Mr. Graham’s to the community, and
in order that he might devote himself more fully to his Master’s work, Mr.
Osborne laid an obligation upon his family to pay Mr. Graham AlOO per
annum during the remainder of his life. This was willingly done; so that
henceforth, relieved from worldly cares, he could follow his inclination. In addi-
tion to his work as Local Preacher and Class Leader his time was largely
occupied in visiting, enjoying a cheerful welcome, and everywhere proclaiming
the truth. “ Visiting him a few days before his death,” writes Mr. Thomas
Armstrong, “after reading at his request the 14th Chapter of John, and
offering prayer he asked me to come near, as his voice was weak, and then he
testified to his conscious acceptance with Christ! Speaking with great earnest-
ness he said: ‘Wherever you are, preach Christ! preach Christ.’” And thus
passed away one of the most humble, earnest, and devoted Christians with
which God has blessed His Church.”
In 1846, the Rev. Jonathan Lines, then in charge of the Camden
and Wollongong Circuit, reported that “ they had seven preaching places on the
Camden side where the congregations were serious and attentive. The first
Missionary Meeting was held in Camden during the year, at which there was


an enormous attendance, and general interest was excited in the work. At
Campbelltown a new Chapel had been commenced, and would soon be opened
for service. ’ In the Wollongong District they had made but little progress,
as he had been able to devote only one week out of six to the work there.
The friends, he said, “ were earnestly craving for the appointment of a
Missionary, and the support of a single man would be nearly raised on the
spot. Their wish was granted in the year following, the Rev. John McKenny
taking charge of Camden Circuit, with the Rev. J. C. Thrum as Assistant
Missionary. Mr. McKenny wrote that the Chapel at Campbelltown was opened
m October, 1846, and that the Work of God received valuable assistance from
the Local Preachers, who, in addition to preaching once or twice on the Sab-
bath day, often travelled from sixteen to twenty-four miles without expense to
the Circuit. Mr. Thrum said that he had visited Dapto, Marshall Mount,
Jamberoo, Spring Hill, Gerringong, and Fairy Meadow, where he had been
kindly received. Classes were formed, and the work was strengthened by his
visits.
Next year the first visit was paid to Picton, where, said the Missionary,
the people appeared very desirous to hear the Word, and several persons
manifested concern for salvation. Steps have been taken for the immediate
erection of a Chapel. About £2 5 were already subscribed.” Of Bulli the
Assistant Missionary wrote: “We preached in the house of Mr. J. Black, who
with his wife and two sons formed the whole of the Society, and the majority
of the congregation. The want of a Preacher to reside in this Circuit is much
felt, nor is there a prospect of much extension of the cause until that want is
supplied. A large field of labour presents itself, but the agency is very limited.”
1 lie next year Mittagong was visited, where the Missionary said “ there is a
prospect of usefulness in that destitute neighbourhood.” At Jamberoo, ser-
vices were being conducted in the Scotch Free Church, but they hoped soon to
build a Chapel on the ground given by Mr. Owen. At Marshall Mount they
were preaching in the house of Mr. Henry Osborne. “ This Circuit,” the report
continued, “ is occupied by the Hired Local Preacher, who preached six times
every week. . . . Our cause at Spring Hill has sustained a great loss in
the death of our best local Preacher, Brother Henry. The stroke was verv
unexpected. He preached at Jamberoo on Sunday in his usual health, and
up to Thursday was quite well. He expired on Thursday evening about 7
o clock without the knowledge of his family or any other person. He has left
a good testimony. For some time past he was living on the verge of
Heaven.” The Missionary also travelled to Shoalhaven for the first time in
the year 185°- “Being so far,” he said, “from Wollongong, and having so
many other places in the Circuit to attend to, we can visit this place but seldom
We have, however, formed a Class containing twelve members, and we hope
soon to build a small slab Chapel on the land granted by the Crown.”
In the year 1851 Mr. John Bowes was placed in charge of the Camden
Circuit, while Mr. George Pickering was sent to Wollongong. Mr. Bowes, in
addition to continuing the work already taken up, extended the borders of the
Circuit, and witnessed encouraging tokens of the presence of God. Of Cob-
bety Paddock, he wrote: “This little Hill of Zion has been watered with

showers of heavenly influence. Some seeds of Divine truth have sprung up and
brought forth fruit. Several have been added to the Lord, and the Classes
and the old members have been revived and edified.” In Camden the congre-
gations continued good, and the Chapel was often crowded with attentive
hearers. The average attendance was about 150, and there were four classes
in the town with thirty-two members. From Wollongong Circuit Mr. Pickering
reported that the cause of Christ afforded ground for gratitude and hope. Much
of his time, he said, was spent on horseback. A commodious Chapel had been
opened at Kiama during the year, and a congregation of from forty to fifty
persons attended. I his, he said, is likely to become an important place,
and at no distant date, the head, we hope, of a second Circuit in Illawarra.”
Of Shoalhaven, he wrote; “An iniviting and extensive field of usefulness pre-
sents itself in this locality, but its distance renders it impracticable for the
Preacher stationed at Wollongong to visit it more than twice m a quarter, and
only one Exhorter resides in the neighbourhood. We have here nineteen
members and materials are in course of preparation for a Chapel.”
The cause at Cobbety Paddock had been visited by such refreshing showers
of heavenly influence, said Mr. Bowes the next year, that they had resolved
to erect a Chapel on the land given by Messrs. J. and W. McArthur. At
Wollongong they were still labouring under the disadvantage of “miserable
Chapel accommodation; ” but, as they had secured central and commodious
premises they hoped soon to see an improvement. The new Chapel at Jam-
beroo was opened during the spring, while Shoalhaven was said to be in a
good state and offering an inviting field for usefulness. The whole Circuit
had, however, suffered injury by the prevailing excitement, consequent on the
discovery of gold, and some of the officers and members had permanently
removed.

THE REV. W. B. BOYCE.
President of the First Australian Conference.


CHAPTER XIII.
THE REV. W. B. BOYCE’S SUPEPIN-
TEN DENCV.
TEE Rev. W. B. Boyce now took charge of the Mission, with the object
of preparing the way for the establishment of an Australian Con-
ference. At his first District Meeting, held in York Street Chapel on
Thursday, 30th July, 1846, the following Missionaries were present:
Revs. J. McKenny, W. Schofield, D. J. Draper (Secretary), F. Lewis, J. Innes, B.
Hurst, S. Wilkinson, and W. Lightbody (Assistant Missionary). Speaking of
the arrival of the General Superintendent, the District Minutes said that his
labours had already been highly beneficial, and the highest expectations were
cherished as to the result of his presence.
In addition to the routine work of the Meeting there were other matters of
moment with which Mr. Boyce and his Assistants were called upon to deal,
the greatest in point of importance being the preparatory steps for the
inauguration of the Conference. But that matter is dealt with at length in a
separate chapter. Another question of importance arose through the
employment of Mr. John Bowes and Mr. George Pickering as Assistant Mis-
sionaries. It was evidently Mr. Boyce’s intention to establish a new order of
agents corresponding in many respects to the present Home Missionaries. But
to this proposal the parties concerned did not agree, and in lengthy communi-
cations to the District Meeting they claimed status as Missionaries. The
result of this contention was that Mr. Bowes and Mr. Pickering were accepted
as Missionaries.
In the year 1850, Mr. Boyce also found himself called upon to answer
important questions proposed by the Leaders of the Sydney North Circuit.
They desired to know if a charge were presented by A against B, whether the
Superintendent had power to dispose of the case without reference to the
Leaders’ Meeting. To this and other questions on similar lines Mr. Boyce
gave lengthy and statesmanlike replies, which are inserted in the District
Minutes. Another interesting question, showing the trend of thought, was
also proposed. “ What are we to understand by the term ‘ Church ’ as used
in Matthew xviii., 17. And how are we to comply with our Lord’s direction
there given?” Mr. Boyce answered: “The term Church, as used in Matthew
xviii., 17, cannot mean the whole Church or society in any one place, as it
would be an impossibility in most cases to call them together, and where


possible many causes of complaints and grounds of difference would be of a
nature altogether unsuitable for such public and general hearing. It must
therefore mean, as explained by Barnes, a Presbyterian commentator, ‘ those
who are authorised to try such cases, the representatives of the Church, or
those who act for them.’ Mr. Wesley explains the passage as referring to the
‘ elders ’ of the Church who ‘ watch over your souls,’ that is, the ‘ Ministers.’
The highest Court in our Ecclesiastical economy, and that which represents
most fully our 1 Church,’ is the Conference, from which all our Superintendents
derive their authority to exercise discipline in their respective Circuits. This
power of the Superintendent is carefully guarded from abuse by our rules, and
is subject to a right of appeal to the Leaders’ Meeting against his decisions.
The Superintendent thus exercising the authority received (in accordance with
the Divine Ordinance) from our Highest Church Court,* a complaint to him, and
the appeal (when deemed necessary) from his decisions, either to the District
or Leaders’ Meetings (as the case may be) constitute in fact, an appeal to the
‘ Church,’ in its recognised local executive authorities. The appeal may be
carried even to the Conference, which binds itself to hear aggrieved parties by
deputation. (See Minutes , 1835.) Thus our members have the fullest oppor-
tunity of ‘ telling ’ their grievances ‘ to the Church ’ in the highest and most
comprehensive sense of the term.”
During the year 1848 the Mission at Moreton Bay, or Brisbane as it is now
called, was undertaken. The Missionary first appointed to labour in that far
distant station wrote: “In this place and neighbourhood an important Mission
has been commenced during the past year, which affords promise of much good.
The small Chapel, formerly erected by Mr. Little, when resident here, and lent
by him gratuitously to the Society, has generally been filled to overflowing, and
the word proclaimed has been the power of God to the salvation of several
souls. A Class has been formed, consisting of eighteen members. North
Brisbane, a town of rising importance, as the principal port and mart of North
Australia, is the central sphere of our operations. The Lord has given your
Agent favour in the eyes of many. A new Chapel of large dimensions has
become necessary, in order to accommodate the many who are disposed to hear.
Arrangements are being made to accomplish this desirable object. A consider-
able sum has already been promised ; and we hope, ere long, the foundation
stone will be laid. Ipswich has been visited, with every prospect of success. We
have preaching also at Kangaroo Point, South Brisbane, and the German
Stations.” In 1851 the Rev. John Watsford, then in charge of Moreton Bay
Circuit, said that the prospects were cheering, and he believed that the Circuit
must, at no distant period, become very important. At North Brisbane the
Chapel was quite full, and arrangements had been entered into for the erection
of a much larger place of worship ; but they had delayed the work on account of
the numerous removals caused by the discovery of gold at Bathurst. At South
Brisbane a small Chapel had been built a Toogooloowa, where he was preaching
in the house of Mr. D. McConnell; and, he added, since Mr. Millard’s appoint-
ment to Ipswich the congregations had considerably increased.


THE REV. JOHN GARDINER.
President , 1899 .
In November, 1849, a Special District Meeting- was held in York Street
Chapel to take into consideration the very urgent request of the Rev. Walter
Lawry for additional Missionaries for Fiji. Mr. Lawry had come to Sydney to
present this request. Ihe members of the District Meeting having considered
the question they unanimously approved of the transference of the Revs.
William Moore, John G. Millard, and Joseph Waterhouse to the Fiji District.
They were influenced in their decision by the following facts. Four Mission-
aries were on their way to the New South Wales District, by means of which
they would be able to supply the stations rendered vacant. Next, the peculiarly
painful state of the Fiji District called for additional help. One Missionary had
•died, a second had been compelled to leave through affliction, one had “desisted,”
and the health of those remaining was precarious. Added to these considera-
lions, the large sums expended, the great toil bestowed upon the Islands, the
prayers offered, and the remarkable successes which had accompanied the
Missionaries’ operations, made a loud demand for Missionary labour. “ The
Papists are ready to enter, and will assuredly take advantage of our
present circumstance of weakness, and more must be sent, or past labour
will be lost.” The Missionaries named above had volunteered for the work,
■and they were deemed peculiarly eligible for the appointment. Referring


to the return of the Rev. John Watsford in consequence of the failure of Mrs.
Watsford s health, the District Meeting- said it was unanimously of the opin-
ion that the present state of Mrs. Watsford’s health rendered his return to the
Islands almost impossible. I hough Mr. Watsford had been directed by his
District Meeting to come home, he still expressed himself as anxious to re-
turn as soon as possible. He was willing “to pack up and go to-morrow,” he
said.
Among the candidates for the Ministry offering during Mr. Boyce’s super-
intendency, taking them in chronological order Mr. J. C. Thrum came first.
Mr. Thrum emigrated to the Colony in the year 1834, and had been a Local
Preacher in the Hunter River Circuit, where he was employed as a Schoolmaster
and ( atechist. Being in every way eligible, the District Meeting recommend-
ed his acceptance, meanwhile employing him provisionally. The next year,
John G. Millard and William C. Currey were received as probationers for the
Ministry; while the following year, 1848, James Somerville, John Pemell
and William Byrnes were recommended as Assistant Missionaries. The Dis-
tiict Meeting having “carefully and deliberately examined them,” was highly
pleased with their ability and piety. In the year 1849 the Rev. James Ford
was compelled, through failure of health, to leave his station in Fiji, and the
the Rev. J. C. Thrum, after two years’ service, retired for the same reason ; the
District Meeting placing on record its high opinion of his moral worth and
excellent character. It also made him a grant of money. The same year
Mr. Joseph Waterhouse was recommended by the Rev. D. J. Draper, of Ade-
laide, where Mr. Waterhouse had resided for the last three years. Having
received an excellent education, and being qualified m every way for his high
calling, the District Meeting unanimously recommended his acceptance. Mr.
Joseph Fillingham was the only candidate recommended in the year 1850,
being brought forward by the Sydney North Circuit; and Mr. George Picker-
ing and Mr. John Bowes were received as Hired Local Preachers the following
year.
Referring to the state of the work of God in the Sydney Circuit, Mr.
Draper stated “ that it was exceedingly encouraging. At the close of the-
year he was rejoiced to find an increase of 161 full members, with thirty per-
sons remaining on trial. The number of members had been increased during
the year, and the congregation continued uniformly good, paying the most
marked attention to the Word of God.” The new Chapel at the Hay Market
was to be set apart for worship during the sessions of the District Meeting.
Arrangements had also been made for laying the foundation stone of a new
Chapel at Balmain, which was much required by the increasing population of
that suburb. The state of suburban and city Methodism generally was very
encouraging. “We have every reason to believe,” continues the report, “ that
Methodism in this Circuit is in a sound, vigorous and improving state. The mem-
bers of the Society are living in love, and the God of love and peace is among
them. . . . It is proper to remark that two new places have been visited
during the year. First: Port Macquarie, two hundred miles by the coast, north-
east of Sydney, where we have a nice Chapel and congregation with fifty


members of Society. A Sabbath School has also been formed there, and the
people are earnestly requesting the appointment of a preacher for whom the
field is most extensive and inviting. .Second; Goulburn, one hundred and
thirty miles south-east of Sydney, where there are a few members and a
icspectable congregation, which will be much increased were a preacher residing
among them. We have two local Preachers there, but the state of the town
and the district needs the appointment of a man to be fully devoted to the
work of the Lord. From the Melbourne Circuit, the Rev. Edward Sweetman
sent encouraging reports of progress, adding that it was hoped that the strong
and repeated recommendations of the last Quarterly Meeting for an additional
Minister would be met as soon as possible. Ihe Rev. F. Tuckfield also sent a
lengthy report of the Buntingdale Mission.
The following year, 1847, the Rev. Nathanial Turner took charge of the
Sydney Circuit, and he was able to state that the past year had been eventful
and prosperous, and taking the Society as a whole, it had never been in a more
flourishing condition. The congregations at York Street were so large that
they hoped soon to erect a gallery. Since the great improvements made at
Princes Street, the congregations had improved. At Surry Hills, a district
rapidly improving, a commodious place of worship was opened. On Friday,
the 26th and Sunday 28th, the new Chapel, 50ft. by 30ft., was opened under
favourable circumstances by the Missionaries who had recently arrived in The
John Wesley. Within one month, every sitting in the Chapel was taken. At
Chippendale, by the zeal and liberality of numerous friends, a similar Chapel
to that at Surry Hills was opened by the Rev. John McKenny, assisted by
the newly arrived Missionaries. At Toxteth Park, the residence of the Hon.
George Allen, a Chapel was erected on his private property. At Newtown,
where they had been worshipping in a hired room, more accommodation was.
much needed. New Chapels were also opened at Canterbury and Balmain,
while preaching services were regularly conducted at Waverley, Lane Cove,
South Head Road, Bishop’s Gate, and Camden. “We regularly conducted
Divine Worship,” wrote Mr. Turner, “in the Asylum for the Aged and Infirm
and the Public Hospital for the Sick. We have also several indefatigable men
employed on the Sabbath from morning till night in the lanes and alleys of the
city, calling upon sinners to repent and live.” The request of the Melbourne
Circuit had now been granted, the Rev. William Lowe being appointed to
Geelong, while Mr. Sweetman remained at Melbourne.
The same District Meeting recommended the division of Sydney North
into two Circuits. It was proposed that Surry Hills be made the head of the
new Circuit to be designated Sydney East, and to comprise Woolloomooloo,
Rushcutter’s Bay, Rose Bay, Paddington, and Waverley. “ The population
in this new part of Sydney is rapidly increasing and spreading especially by the
sale of the Raleigh Estate and by the opening of the new Military Barracks.
It is felt that in the present union of Surry Hills and its vicinity with the
North Circuit, it is impossible to give it that Ministerial aid and oversight which
so important a place claims, and it is confidently hoped its formation into a
new Circuit will be attended with great success. We are the more sanguine

THE REV. GEORGE WOOLNOUGH, M A.
President, 1881.
in this proposition from the remarkable success which has resulted from the
formation of the Sydney South, or Chippendale Circuit.” In the event of this
division, the Missionary Committee was earnestly requested to send out an
additional Missionary, the preference being for one who was talented and
laborious, with a few years’ experience in the work at home.
Ihe Sydney North Circuit, which, in accordance with the last District
Meeting, had been divided into two Circuits, continued on its prosperous career.
\ ork Street Chapel was full to overflowing, but the much needed gallery had
not yet been erected. The new Chapel at Surry Hills was well attended,
and the Society was increasing. The same report was forthcoming of the
work at Balmain. A Camp Meeting was held on Anniversary Day in the
city. It was ‘‘ enormously attended,” and this extraordinary service, as it was
described, resulted in the conversion of several souls. The Tract Society was
reorganised in order to visit more extensively the neglected and degraded
portions of the community. Of the new South Sydney Circuit, it was stated
that the change had been attended by beneficial results. At Chippendale, the
head of the Circuit, the Chapel was well filled, and the Quarterly Meeting
had requested the Superintendent to take preliminary steps towards the erection


of a large and suitable Chapel on the site recently granted by the Government.
Stanmore had been graciously blessed, and a Class of twenty persons formed.
A Camp Meeting was also held in this Circuit, the spot chosen being the
paddock adjoining the Chapel at Chippendale.
The next District Meeting, 1849, expressed its opinion that the erection
of a large central Chapel in the Sydney South Circuit was of the greatest im-
portance to the work of God, and that it was desirable that immediate steps
be taken to bring the matter before the public. It was also recommended that
Circuit libraries be formed, to be under the management of one or two secretar-
ies, by which means books might be regularly circulated through the Circuit.
Mr. I urner was now able to report that his long cherished desire had been
fulfilled and the gallery had been placed in York Street Chapel, by means of
which accommodation was provided for twelve hundred persons. At
Lane Cove, he Had received much encouragement. The large room lent by
Mr. Johnson was generally well filled, and the Society had been augmented in
numbers and improved in piety. Sydney South, in charge of the Rev. F.
Lewis, complained of the want of adequate accommodation at Chippendale,
where their inability to supply the applicants with sittings had led many people
to worship elsewhere. Hay Street was till in a discouraging state. At New-
town the work was prospering. “At a Camp Meeting held on Good Friday, a
very gracious influence attended the preaching of the Gospel, and at a Love
Feast in the evening, several were in deep distress about the salvation of their
souls. The sight of two respectable Class Leaders, the one leading an aged
wife, who had long been a member of the Society, but had never obtained a
sense of her acceptance with God, in deep distress to the penitent form, and
the other conducting a young man who had just taken to meet in Class to the
same spot under similar feelings, and then to see at a subsequent period of the
meeting, the husband and wife, and father and son, all praising God together,
was indeed an affecting sight. This most interesting service will not soon
be forgotten in Newtown, inasmuch as the fruit thereof continues and is likely
to be abiding in its character. . . . The growing wants of our increasingly
large congregations have at length led to the commencement of a new Chapel.
The site was purchased of R. M. Roby, Esq. for the sum of £yo, and is in a most
eligible situation. The Chapel will be built of brick, on a stone foundation
which is already laid. The style is Gothic, and the dimensions are 5 1 ft. by
30ft. in the clear of the walls.”
The report of the Sydney North Circuit the following year, 1850, was
not such pleasant reading; for the year had been one of peculiar trial and loss
of membership, accounted for in the following manner. The formation of the
Surry Hills Circuit and the consequent loss of membership; the arrival of
many persons from the British Isles, who, though members at home, had not
joined in fellowship with the people here ; not fewer than seventy persons had
-ceased to meet in Class during the year ; and the interference with the finances
through the bankruptcy of a number of persons. But the Sydney South Circuit
was able to tell a brighter story. Chippendale was prospering, while at New-
town the new Chapel was complete. “It was opened on Sunday, May 19th.


" *'
WAVERLEY CHURCH.
The opening services were of a most interesting character, the Chapel being
well filled, and a gracious influence pervaded the assemblies. The offerings
of the people evinced their joy and gratitude to God, the collections amounting
to It is well suited to the locality, and, if we may judge from the fact
that every pew was taken at once, and from a second increase of the congrega-
tion, it is likely to prove of great blessing to the neighbourhood. The Chapel
has cost £570 including £yo for the land. It has a debt upon it of
The new Circuit in Sydney East was progressing favourably. The Chapel at
Surry Hills had undergone extensive alterations. Its area had been doubled,
and the wall raised sft. to admit of a gallery at some future period. This
improvement had been effected at a cost of £6OO. During the alterations,
services had been held in the Court House.
The Rev. John Eggleston was placed in charge of the Sydney South
Circuit in the year 1851. He had to complain of the temporary dissipation
caused by the excitement in the Colony on the gold mine question, which had,
he said, interfered with the advancement of the work. The Chapel at Chippen-
dale was now too small for the congregation, and a larger one would soon be
filled with regular hearers. “ The officers are spiritual and zealous, aiming to
fulfil their duties to God. Great harmony prevails in official meetings, and a
sincere and ardent desire is evinced to see the work of God extending in the


neighbourhood. Several of the Society have recently been enabled to reckon
themselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through jesus Christ
our Lord, and are producing the fruits of perfect love. And the awakening
and conversion of sinners have encouraged more ardent prayers for Zion’s en-
largement.” At Bishop’s Gate, the Circuit Steward had lent a room in his
mill, in which Sabbath School and public worship were held. At Newtown a
Leader’s Meeting had been established, embracing Stanmore and Duke’s
Ground. Canterbury was rejoicing in a gracious revival, while at Ashfield and
Moorfields there was a decided improvement, a Chapel being in course of
erection at the latter place. “ There is much in this Circuit of genuine English
Methodism. A simplicity and zeal in both officers and members, which greatly
encouraged Ministerial effort and afforded promise of success. The Local
Preachers are plain, straightforward, hard-working men. The Tract distribu-
tors are zealous, and well prepared for the difficult work they have to perform in
the low neighbourhoods they have to visit; and their labours have been owned
of God in bringing souls under the ministry of that Word which has proved the
power of God unto their salvation. In reviewing the past year we feel called
upon to thank God and take courage.”
The Rev. Benjamin Hurst was able to write in similar strains of the
Sydney East Circuit. He, too, spoke of the gold discovery, the ultimate effect
of which, upon the moral and religious condition of the Colony, would in some
instances divert the attention of the people from those desirable riches which
the Gospel offered, causing the minds of the unenlightened and unsaved to be
less susceptible of Divine influence. An addition had been made to the pro-
perty at Surry Hills by the erection of a spacious School Room with Vestry
and Chapel keeper’s dwelling, the addition proving of great service to the
Society in several departments of its labours. These improvements had in-
volved the expenditure of upwards of £I,OOO, increasing the Trust debt from
£4OO to £BOO. At Waverley he reported the loss, by removal, of Mr. Vickery’s
family; while many male members of the congregation had gone to the
diggings. The Rev. Francis Tuckfield took charge of Sydney North in the year
1852, but his report did not disclose anything of a remarkable nature. In the
Sydney South Circuit, the Rev. Benjamin Chapman referred to the gold discovery
as the principal cause of the decrease in his Circuit. Local Preachers and Class
members had been seized with the gold fever. At Chippendale and Tlay
Street they hoped soon to remove the debt from their Chapels; Moorfields
Chapel was opened for Divine worship. The Rev. Benjamin Hurst, then at
Sydney East, said that the congregations at Surry Hills were remarkably
good, while at Paddington, where the Rev. Nathaniel Turner resided, a
beneficial influence had been exercised by the family upon the district. During
the year he had commenced service in the house of one of their members at
Woolloomooloo. Elere these detailed reports of Circuit work must end ; for with
the approach of the first Conference the Missionaries ceased to submit informa-
tion in this form. Henceforth, that is, until the publication of The Christian
Advocate , news is extremely meagre, being gathered almost entirely from
the District and Conference Minutes.

CHAPTER XIV.
Tl II: riPSI CON TERENCE.
THIS subject may fittingly be introduced by the insertion of the following
letter from the Missionary Secretaries, the Revs. George Osborne and
William Arthur, to the Rev. William Schofield, bearing date October
ist, 1852. ‘‘The resolutions of the Missionary Committee of date De-
cember sth, which were published in the Missionary Notice for January last, have
been unanimously approved by the Conference ; and in pursuance of them, the
Rev. Robert Young has been appointed a Deputation to visit Australia and New
Zealand. The Rev. John Kirk has also been appointed to accompany him to New
Zealand. The Deputation to Australia is appointed in the hope that by the
blessing of God it may lead to such a reorganization of Methodism in that im-
portant Country as shall greatly promote its prosperity in time to come. The
Constitution of a New Conference for the Australian Colonies, distinct from the
British Conference, yet not wholly independent of it, but sustaining a relation to
it analogous to that in which the Conferences of Ireland, Western Canada, and
France respectively stand, is the course which seems to be suggested by the
circumstances of the times, and has approved itself to the judgment of those in
this Country who are the most competent to form an opinion on the subject.
Such a proceeding would, undoubtedly, tend more than any other to a most
advantageous development of the resources of the Australian Colonies, while it
would, with God’s blessing, secure the unity of Wesleyan Methodism; and if
the attainment of these objects should require some additional sacrifices on the
part of our Brethren stationed there, we cannot doubt that they will be readily
made. The details of the plan will be submitted to the consideration of the
Brethren by the Deputation, and it is not necessary for us to do more than
express our earnest desire and confident hope that you will give them your care-
ful and candid consideration. Our prayer is that God may guide us and you
to such results as shall promote the extension of His kingdom and the honour
of His blessed name. In this we know you will heartily join us; commending
to your Brotherly intercessions and to all such other good offices as they may
stand in need of, our beloved Brethren, Mr. Young and Mr. Kirk.”
Leaving Plymouth, October 15th, 1852, they embarked on The Melbourne,
one of the vessels of the Australian Royal Mail Steam Navigation Company.
On the 19th, the vessel met with a serious accident. She rolled the masts over-
board, carried away part of her bulwarks and received other damage. The
spars, sails and other parts of the rigging becoming entangled with the propeller,
she was rendered powerless and left to the mercy of the waves. After much
exertion, the screw was disentangled and the vessel proceeded to Lisbon. Here


the passengers held meetings, at which they decided not to proceed further in
the ship, because of her unseaworthiness and want of proper sanitation. “It
is but simple truth to say, that there was not a passenger on board who did
not feel that they had been thoroughly imposed upon.” — {Youngs Journal , p. 8.)
On the 27th of the next month, Mr. Young found himself at Southampton,
where, after an interview with the Company, they agreed to defray the expenses
ol the return journey, and to give the passengers a berth in The Adelaide , a
new screw steamer of 1800 tons and 450 horse power. On the 19th December,
Mr. Young again embarked at Plymouth, and passed the breakwater in gallant
style at 4 o’clock. But by g o’clock the next morning, he was again in Plymouth,
the water having broken into the forepart of the vessel during the night and
completely filled that portion of the ship. In these misfortunes,
some of Mi. \ oung s friends saw what they conceived to be an indication that
he should not proceed to Australia. Mr. Kirk evidently agreed with them, for
he decided to remain in England ; but not so Mr. Young. He thought there
might have been an answer to prayer in the very disasters through which he
had passed.
On January Ist, 18 5 was again on board Ihe Adelaide , expecting to
start the following morning; but his purpose was frustrated by the resignation
of the Captain and his first officer. The passengers championed the Captain’s
cause, and he was reinstated. A satisfactory trial trip was then made to test
the vessel, and on the Bth Mr. Young finally left Plymouth and put out to sea.
Misfortune still dogged his steps, for the ship now experienced a fierce gale,
which lasted three days. Mr. Young’s berth was filled with water, and for three
nights, without undressing, he was forced to take refuge in the dining saloon.
I\ or was this all, for an alarm of fire rang through the ship, spontaneous combus-
tion of the coal having taken place. By prompt and judicious measures, the fire
was got under, though several times afterwards they were threatened with the
same danger, as the coal put on board was highly inflammable. On the 24th
April, they entered King George’s Sound. Arriving at Port Adelaide on the
sth May, Mr. Young was met by the Revs. D. J. Draper and T. N. Hull, and
proceeded to town, preaching in the evening in Pirie Street Chapel. Remaining
here two days, he afterwards proceeded to Port Phillip, where he arrived on the
11 th mst. Unaware of his arrival, there was no one to welcome him and he
called a cab, the driver refusing to take him to Melbourne, a distance of M miles,
for less than 50s.* Mr. Young, therefore, walked, arriving at the Mission 2 House
covered with mud, where he was warmly received by the Rev. William Butters
Mr. Young spent some time in Melbourne, when he received an address, inspected
various towns and Mission properties and prepared the way for the first Con-
ference. On the nth June, at 12 o’clock, he entered Port Jackson where he
was received by Mr. Boyce and other Ministers and friends, who gave him a
hearty welcome. “ Mr. Boyce drove me to his residence at the Glebe, a beautiful
and sequestered spot which was to be my residence during my sojourn in the
Colony.”
and L?^ I 'plr Sf * 4O this chw « e on P l ®* were ifc per bushel


Mr. Boyce soon proved himself to be a generous host and a wise guide,
affording Mr. Young opportunities of meeting all the Missionaries and their
wives and the “ lay friends connected with the Wesleyan Church in this city.”
They “fully sympathised with the object of my Mission,” and “expressed their
willingness to use all legitimate means for its successful promotion.” On the
24th June, a Tea Meeting, “in honour of the Deputation,” was given in the
York Street Chapel, when there were about 500 present, all of whom were in
some way officially connected with the Wesleyan Church. The Rev. W. B.
Boyce, presided ; and after an introductory speech of considerable point and
humour, introduced Mr. Young to the meeting, and an address was presented to
him. Mr. Young replied to the effect that the object of his mission was undoubt-
edly important. They would be pleased to know, he said, that in the arrange-
ment proposed, provision would be made for the continued maintenance ol
Methodism in all its essential, doctrinal and disciplinary principles. Several
other excellent speeches followed, approving of the scheme and warmly advo-
cating the propriety of incorporating New Zealand and Polynesia in the new
arrangement. This official function concluded, Mr. Young found himself at
liberty to make excursions into the country and to explore the city, finding able
guides in Hon. Geo. Allen, M.L.C., Mr. A. McArthur, and Mr. James Byrnes. For
example, he attended Missionary meetings at York Street Chapel, Windsor,
Richmond and Parramatta. At York Street, “the meeting was said to be, in
every respect, the very best known in Sydney.” He was impressed by the
numerous public-houses on the way, and the number of men on horseback, “ most
of whom were riding at great speed, and with hardly an exception, each man had
a short pipe in his mouth.” When near Parramatta, “we passed a milkmaid-
looking girl, driving a cart; she was perched on the front of the rude vehicle
with the reins in one hand, and although the day was bitterly cold, a parasol
in the other shading her face from the sun.” On the Parramatta to Windsor
Road, “ the mud was frightful, averaging from one to two feet deep, of the
consistency of putty.” At Windsor, he expressed surprise that the Romish
Chapel was without its usual symbol, the Cross, when he was told that a like
symbol having been placed on the English Church, “ the Puseyitish apery so
offended the Romish Priest,” that he had his own Cross removed. The Mis-
sionary meeting at Richmond was attended by 20 men, 40 women and 30 babies,
but not one baby uttered a cry! When preaching at Parramatta, he noticed that
the people were “ very stoical ” ; and he adds, “ I called upon Mrs. Oakes, who
was the hrst child born of European parents in New South Wales, and the first
white female married in the Colony.” A contemplated trip to Bathurst was
abandoned on account of the roads, which were in “an awful state,” being
“ trampled into a continuous puddle.” When preaching at Newtown he “ was
grieved to learn that some of the hearers had received the Morisonian heresy,
and others the Winchestenan views of future punishment.” The congregation
at York Street was reduced in numbers owing to the “ influenza prevalent.”
On the 28th July, Mr. Young was present at the District Meeting, when
he stated the object of his visit and a free discussion took place. It was then
resolved; “1. That the Brethren fully approve of the proposed Australian Con-
nexion, which, in their opinion, will obviate many practical difficulties hitherto


experienced in the carrying out of the Methodist economy in these Colonies.
2. That they recognise with great satisfaction the justice and liberality of the
Committee in making ample provision to meet the pecuniary claims of the Bre-
thren upon the Connexional funds, pending the establishment of similar funds
in the Australian Connexion ; and also in the permission granted to the Brethren
from England, to take their choice in being permanently attached either to the
Home or Australian Connexion. 3. That they pledge themselves to a careful
consideration of the details requisite to carry the measure into effect in the
approaching Conference.”
In reference to the incorporation of the Polynesian Mission with the pro-
posed Australian Conference, it was resolved: “ 1. That in the opinion of this
meeting the union of the Missions in New Zealand and Polynesia with the Aus-
tralian Conference is highly desirable, both in reference to the comfort of the
Missionaries, and the effective management of the Missions. 2. That by so
uniting these Missions with the Australian Conference, and placing them under
its direction an additional interest in the Mission work will be created, and larger
supplies will be raised for its support. 3. That although for the present, it will
be necessary for the Committee in London to make grants towards the cost of
these Missions, yet they look forward to a period when, by the blessing of God
upon the efforts of His servants in this and other departments of labour, these
Colonies may be in a position to take the entire expense upon themselves.” On
the motion of Mr. Thomas Cowlishaw, seconded by Mr. John Caldwell, a similar
resolution was passed in the Financial District Meeting, and resolutions substan-
tially similar to these, although varying in their terms, were adopted by Special
District Meetings in Tasmania, Victoria, and South Australia. The Financial
District Meeting also passed this additional resolution: “ The members of the
Financial District Meeting cannot allow its proceedings to terminate without
expressing the gratification they feel in being favoured with the presence and
judicious counsel of the Rev. R. Young. They thank God and the Conference
for the appointment of one whose rich and evangelical ministrations amongst
us are productive of such cheering results, and who so well sustains the high
anticipations that were raised by the knowledge we previously had of his posi-
tion and usefulness in the Churches at home. We pray that the object of his
mission may be brought to a conclusion which shall afford the richest gratifica-
tion to his own mind, and lead to the promotion of God’s glory in the welfare
and extension of the Churches in this part of the world. We would also record
our grateful acknowledgment to the parent Society for their long continued
liberality, and the many benefits conferred upon us by their paternal superin-
tendence, and for the expression of confidence they now so obviously repose in
us, in committing to us the management of our own affairs.” —(District Minutes ,
1853-)
Mr. Young preached the District Meeting sermon in York Street Chapel,
and through the liberality of Mr. McArthur, whom he afterwards married to Miss
Maria Bowden, second daughter of Mr. Boyce, he was enabled to meet the prin-
cipal members of the Wesleyan Churches in the City to the number of 500.
Excellent addresses were delivered by Ministers and laymen, and the following-


resolutions were adopted with great cordiality: “ 1 hat it hath pleased Almighty
God to raise the Wesleyan Churches in this part of the world to a state which
warrants their official separation from the British Conference, we embrace the
opportunity of expressing our very great pleasure in being favoured with the
presence of the Rev. R. Young, and our hearty concurrence in the object of his
mission. That, as the Rev. B. Hurst has kindly offered the sum of ZToo, pro-
vided that £4OO additional can be raised towards bringing six young Ministers
from England to New South Wales, this Meeting, convinced of the importance
of entering the many providential openings which are presenting themselves in
the interior of the Colony, hereby expresses its sympathy with the object, and
pledges itself to raise the required amount.” Mr. Boyce then stated that they
were prepared to receive contributions to meet Mr. Hurst’s offer, and in a few
minutes the sum was subscribed with great cheerfulness. “ The Wesleyans in
these Colonies,” adds Mr. Young, “ are far from being parsimonious, and many of
them evince a liberality indicative of great nobility of soul, as well as high
Christian principle.” After tedious delay, caused by the frequent postponements
of the vessel, Mr. Young left for New Zealand on the 30th August, accompanied
by the Revs. W. B. Boyce and Nathaniel Turner.
On the 3rd December, Mr. Young was again in Sydney, having visited New
Zealand and Fiji. On his return, he was accompanied by King George, who
assisted him at a remarkable Missionary Meeting at Chippendale. Before his
final farewell to Sydney, he met the Ministers and their families at Mr. Allen’s
at Toxteth Park, and received an address on the occasion of his departure, the
address expressing unwavering determination to carry out the views of the Com-
mittee and Conference in relation to Australia. On the 14th, he left in The
Hellespont steamer for Melbourne. “I parted,” says Mr. Young, “with Mr.
Boyce’s very interesting family. I had spent three months altogether under
their roof, and the unwavering kindness and abounding hospitality of the whole
family made an impression on my mind so deep, that whilst memory retains her
seat it can never be forgotten. Mr. Young airived at Southampton, April
3rd. “In eighteen months I have travelled by sea and by land, about forty
thousand miles ; have been in sundry perils, and exposed to many trying changes
of climate ; yet, such has been the kindness of Divine Providence, I have not
suffered an hour’s illness.”
Mr. Young’s report to the English Conference was eminently satisfactory,
and the way was now prepared for that self-government which had become a
necessity. “ The future of this vast religious organisation was important, and
it was felt that the field could not longer be well worked from London as the
official centre. Its exigencies had more than once baffled the wisdom of the
Committee.” —{The Pioneer Missionary, p. 298.) At the Conference held that
year in Birmingham, Mr. Young reported the results of his mission, and the
following “ Plan for forming the Wesleyan Missionary Society’s Australasian
and Polynesian Missions into a distinct and Affiliated Connexion ” was adopted.
The Plan, dated August 9th, 1854, was signed by the President, the Rev. John
F arrar.

I. THE CONNEXION.
i. The Australasian and Polynesian Missions, now under the direction of
the Wesleyan Conference and the Missionary Society in England, shall hence-
forth constitute a distinct but Affiliated Connexion, to be called the AUSTRA-
LASIAN WESLEYAN METHODIST CONNEXION. 2. This new Con-
nexion, shall continue to maintain in common with the English Connexion,
the Wesleyan doctrine as contained in Mr. Wesley’s four Volumes of
Sermons, and Notes on the New Testament, and the Wesleyan system of disci
pline, as contained in the Minutes of Conference.
11. THE CONFERENCE, ETC.
1. The Conference of the Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Connexion
shall consist of the Missionaries in Australasia, Van Dieman’s Land, New Zea-
land the Friendly and Fiji Islands, who have been admitted, by the English
Conference, to the full work and office of the Christian Ministry, and of such
other Ministers as shall hereafter be received by the Australasian Conference
into its own body. 2. The Conference shall meet annually, and at the following
places successively—-Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide and Hobart Town. If found
practicable, it may also occasionally be held at Auckland, and other places may
be added, whenever it may be deemed proper to increase the number. The time
of the meeting to be fixed by itself. 3. The Ministers who may attend the
Conference, excepting those who may attend ex officio , shall be selected by the
annual District Meetings. For the present, it appears desirable that all the
Ministers in the district, where the yearly session of the Conference is held,
should be allowed to be present; and from each of the other Conference districts
in Australia and Van Dieman’s Land, one Minister at least, if the District Meet-
ing think it necessary and practicable, shall be appointed to go to the Conference
in addition to the Chairman who shall attend ex officio. When it is found
convenient, one Minister, at least, beside the Chairman, shall also be permitted'
to attend the Conference, from Western Australia, and one from each of the
Mission districts in New Zealand, the Friendly Islands and Fiji. The number
of Ministers who may actually attend the Conference, shall, for the present, be
deemed competent for the transaction of business, but the Conference shall have
power, whenever it may be found necessary or proper, to fix the number of
Ministers who shall constitute a quorum for that purpose, as well as to limit the
number of Ministers who shall attend the Conference, and also the period of its
own annual session. The General Superintendent of Missions shall attend the
Conference and the Stationing Committee, ex officio. 4. The Australasian Con-
ference shall have the same power as the English Conference, with regard to
the exercise of discipline upon its members, the selection of candidates for the
Ministry, the appointment of Ministers to the Chapels, and the receiving and
finally deciding upon all appeals from the subordinary jurisdiction of the Con-
nexion. 5. The economical regulations which the Australasian Conference may
from time to time adopt, for the general management of Connexional affairs.


shall immediately come into operation ; but the English Conference shall, never-
theless, have the power of electing one of its own members of standing and ex-
perience to the office of President. 6. The President of the Conference will be
■expected to spend as large a portion of the year in the intervals of the Con-
ference, as may be convenient, in the visitation of the District and Circuits of
the Connexion. 7. As the provision adopted by the English Conference, by
which the Ex-President supplies the place of the President in case of his removal
•or his being incapacitated by illness for the peformance of his duty, could not
be adopted in Australia were such an emergency speedily to occur, —it shall be
understood that, until circumstances will admit of the application of the same
plan in that country, should the President of the Australasian Conference thus
be laid aside, consultations shall be had with the Secretary of the Conference,
and the Chairman of the New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Van
Dieman’s Land Districts, in concurrence with whom one shall be appointed to
supply pro tempore the President’s lack of service. 8. The economical regula-
tions which the Australasian Conference may, from time to time adopt for the
general management of Connexional affairs shall immediately come into opera-
tion ; but the English Conference shall, nevertheless, have the power of disallow-
ing, at is first annual session after the minutes of the Australasian Conference
shall be received, such rules, or rule, in its judgment infringe any of our doctrinal
or disciplinary principles.
111. DISTRICTS.
1. The formation of Districts, and the appointment of Chairman, are left
to the Australasian Conference; but it is expected that every Chairman will
make himself well acquainted with the discipline of the body, and with
regular correspondence with the Superintendents, and by visiting the several
■circuits, and occasionally presiding at their Quarterly Meeting, main-
tain a constant and effective oversight of his District, and secure
in all the Circuits, an uniform, impartial, and truly Christian ad-
ministration of our discipline. 2. As the number of Ministers who
attend the Conference from all the Districts, except the one in which the Con-
ference may be held may be so few, and the distance being so great as to preclude
such communication during the sitting of the Conference,—it is deemed desirable
that every District Meeting should continue the practice which obtains in all
the District Meetings of the Society, and draw up a provisional list of appoint-
ments for the use of the Stationing Committee and the Conference. Further,
as the Australian Districts will be, for some time to come, of great extent, and
interchanges between them would involve considerable cost and delay, changes
from District to District should not be made, without sufficient public reason for
the same. 3- A Chapel Building Committee, composed of Ministers and lay-
men, shall be formed for each District, to be consulted m reference to every
Chapel proposed to be built. And it is expected that the Committee will not
sanction the erection of any place of worship on which it is intended that there
shall be a permanent debt, or which is not settled according to the provisions of
the English Connexional Model Deed. 4. The General Committees of the


several Connexional Funds, comprising an equal number of Ministers and lay-
men, have been hitherto appointed by the several District Meetings in Austra-
lasia ; but, for the future, the appointment shall be made by the Conference.
The annual District Meetings, however, when the Circuit Stewards are present,
shall have the privilege of making the nomination of twice the number of suit-
able persons required, the Superintendents, nominating Ministers, and Stewards,
the lay members, and from these District lists the Conference shall select the
parties who shall contribute the several Committees for the year.
IV. EXISTING CLAIMS OF MISSIONARIES.
2. The Missionaries in Australia, Van Dieman’s Land, New Zealand, the
Friendly Islands, and Fiji, who, as British subjects, sent out from this country,
have a claim upon the English Conference for home Circuits were they now to
return, shall retain their claim for a reasonable period, and continue eligible for
Circuits in the home-work should circumstances arise within that period to
render it proper for them to withdraw from the work in Australia. But whilst
the English Conference and the Missionary Committee would thus keep good
faith with their esteemed Missionary Brethren, they are, nevertheless, anxious
that the Australasian Connexion should not be deprived of the services of those
whose standing and experience qualify them for working out, under the guid-
ance and blessing of the Great Head of the Church, the new arrangements with
efficiency and success. 2. The Missionaries, whether sent from England, or taken
out in Australia, who are now members of the English Preachers’ Annuitant
Society, shall continue such as long as they pay their regular subscriptions to the
Fund, and are recognised as members of the Conference ; and, on their becoming
Supernumeraries, shall have the allowance according to rule from the fund of the
said Society. It is, however, desirable, that an Annuitant Society should be
formed in connection with the Australasian Conference, or some equally good
plan be originated for the support of disabled Ministers and Ministers’ Widows,
and that an arrangement be made with the English Preachers’ Annuitant Society,
for a repayment on account of the subscriptions already paid to the Funds of
that Society, to aid in the formation of a fund of their own. The attention of
the Australasian Conference is especially called to this subject. 3. The claims
of the Brethren for auxiliary grants, when they become Supernumeraries, are to
be provided for by the formation of an Australasian Auxiliary Society, or by
some other more suitable plan. 4. The educational claims of the Ministers for
their children shall be met by the Australasian Connexion as soon as possible,
either by charging the amount to the Children’s Fund, or by some other more
eligible mode; but, until an arrangement for this purpose can be satisfactorily
made, such claims will still be recognised and provided for by the parent Mis-
sionary Society, in behalf of those Missionaries who are now in connection with
the English Conference.
V. THE RELATION OF NEW MINISTERS.
No Preacher on trial who is now employed in the Australasian and Poly-
nesian Missions, or who may hereafter be employed by the Australasian Confer-
ence, shall, at the close of his probation, have a claim to be admitted into full con-
nexion with the English Conference ; but, if approved, shall be received simply


as a member of the Affiliated Australasian Conference, without having any claims
upon the English Conference or its Connexional Funds. This rule shall equally
apply to all candidates who may be sent from this country, as to those who may
be admitted on trial in Australasia; but the case of any senior Minister whom it
may be deemed desirable to send to Australasia shall be settled by special
arrangement with the English Conference.
VI. FUNDS, ETC.
i. The Mission Churches in the Australia and Van Dieman’s Land Districts
shall now, in accordance with the New Testament rule, undertake the entire sus-
tenance of their own Ministers. 2. The Australasian Connexion shall hence-
forth maintain for its own benefit the Contingent and other Connexional funds
already established in Australia; and the Committees thereof, chosen principally
from the District in which the Conference is held, shall meet preparatory to the
Conference, and from time to time make such arrangements as may be re-
quisite to obtain the means necessary for the support of the work in its several
departments.
VII. MISSIONS.
1. A Missionary Committee, consisting of an equal number of Ministers and
laymen, appointed by the Australian Conference, shall annually review the state
and expenditure of the Missions in New Zealand, the Friendly Islands, and Fiji,
and in connexion with the General Superintendent of Missions fix the grant
of each District for the year. A Minister and a layman shall be appointed as
joint treasurers of the Mission Fund. 2. The Missionary contributions raised in
the Australasian Connexion shall be considered as part of the income of the
parent Missionary Society in England, the lists of the subscriptions, with the
names of the subscribers, to be printed in the Society’s annual report; and the
General Committee of the Parent Society shall from year to year, so long as it
may be necessary, make grants for the support of the Missions in connexion with
the Australasian Conference equal in amount to that of the Australasian Mis-
sionary subscriptions paid into the general fund, with such an additional sum as
the necessities of the work may for, a time, require. It is to be distinctly un-
derstood that the Missions undertaken by the Australasian Conference are not
to suffer by the reductions of the grants from the home fund of the Society;
but to be maintained in a state of efficiency by means of increased contributions
raised in the Australasian Connexion. 3. The General Superintendent of
Missions will be required to transmit to the Missionary Committee in London,
such information respecting the state and prospects of the work in the Austra-
lasian Connexion, and especially of the Mission work in the Islands, as will
be suitable for publication in the Missionary Notices and the Society’s Annual
Report; and it will he further expected that such a report of the state and
claims of the work be transmitted every year, from the Australasian Conference,
as will assist the General Missionary Committee in determining the amount of
the annual grant for the support of the Missions under the care of that Affiliated
Conference.

THE FIRST GOULBURN PLAN.


The Conference met in York Street Chapel, Thursday, 18th January, 1855,
at 11 o’clock, when the following Ministers, according to the Conference Minutes,
were present, gathered from the Australian Colonies, Van Dieman’s Land, New
Zealand and Polynesia:—Revs. William B. Boyce, Nathaniel Turner, T. N.
Hull, William Schofield, James Watkin, J. A. Manton, John Whiteley, William
Butters, Stephen Rabone, D. J. Draper, John Eggleston, Frederick Lewis,
Thomas Buddie, H. H. Gaud, Benjamin Hurst, Jonathan Innes, Benjamin Lyth„
Isaac Plarding, Francis Tuckfield, Samuel Wilkinson, John Watsford, Thomas
Adams, Benjamin Chapman, Joseph Oram, William C. Currey, John G. Millard,
John Pemell, James Somerville, Joseph Fillingham, W. J. K. Piddington, Josiah
G. Turner, Lonsdale Abell, Thomas Angwin, William Curnow, John Gale, Wil-
liam Kelynack, Plans Mack, R. W. Vanderkiste, John Bowes, and George
Pickering. “It was needless to say that great interest was felt in reference to
its meetings. Not many of the Ministers ever had the opportunity of attending
the English Conference ; and most of them never had been present in that
Assembly. The entire circumstances were novel, and prophets of ill omen, of
whom there are always plenty, predicted that the whole scheme was premature,,
and would prove a signal failure. But the assembled Ministers entered upon
their duties in the spirit of men who felt their responsibilities, and who, in
God’s name and strength, resolved to discharge them to the best of their power.
And neither the parent Church at home, nor the Australasian Church, now be-
coming so important, had any cause to be ashamed of that first Conference of
1855, nor of any of those which have succeeded it.” — {Draper's Life , p. 164.)
And the Rev. J. G. Turner adds: “The occasion was one of solemn interest
to all. There were the founders of a mighty work of God which, during then-
day, had outgrown their most ardent anticipations; and there were young
Ministers whose earliest religious instruction had been received at their feet.
Before them were momentous questions, and upon their decisions seemed to-
rest in a great degree the advancement of the Church of Christ. Never was.
Christian zeal more earnestly tempered with humility than when they rose to-
sing, as their opening hymn:—
‘ Except the Lord conduct the plan,
The best concerted schemes are vain,
And never can succeed. 9 ”
{The Pioneer Missionary , p. 298.)
The first business was the reading of the following resolutions of the Bri-
tish Conference giving the necessary authority for the formation of an Affi-
liated Confederation of Churches in Australasia, and the formal notification of
the appointment of the Rev. William Binnington Boyce as the first President;
“ 1. The arrangements respecting the Missions in Australasia, and the plan on
which the Affiliated French Conference was formed, modified as to some of its-
details, for the purpose of adapting it more fully to the local circumstances of
the work in Australasia, having undergone careful consideration, the Conference,
while recognising the new principle that Foreign Missions, when they have
attained sufficient maturity, ought to be placed in a position in which they will
be able to discharge the common obligation resting upon all the Churches of


Christ to provide their own support and perpetuation,—rejoices to learn that
our people in Australia, entering fully into these views, express a readiness to
undertake the support of their own Ministry, and to afford immediate assistance
to a considerable extent to the Missions in New Zealand, the Friendly Islands
and Fiji; at the same time taking upon themselves the obligation of ultimately
providing for the entire maintenance of the work at these important Missions.
1 he Conference is further of opinion that the proposed Plan contains the best
guarantees that can be devised —and, as, it is believed, sufficient guarantees —
for the preservation and purity of our evangelical system of doctrine and dis-
cipline : and that the measure regarded as a whole, is eminently calculated in-
strumentally to promote the advancement of the work of God in the extensive
regions to which it is intended to apply; and accordingly hereby adopts the
Plan, and constitutes the Missions in Australia, Van Dieman’s Land, New Zea-
land, the Friendly Islands, and Fiji, a distinct Connexion to be dominated
‘THE AUSTRALASIAN WESLEYAN METHODIST CONNEXION/
with an annual Conference of its own, having the same kind of relation to the
parent English Conference as is sustained, in the reference thereto, by the
Affiliated Methodist Conference in France and Canada. 2. The Rev. William
Bmnington Boyce is hereby appointed the first President of the Australasian
Weslevan Methodist Conference.”
*
Mr. Boyce had now been General Superintendent of Missions for ten years,
and the experience thus gained, together with his zeal and capacity, his shrewd-
ness and vivacity, his business talents and great powers of endurance, singled
him out as pre-eminently fitted to be the President of the first Conference. He
was an altogether remarkable man, few such men being given to Australia. He
was not only a good, but a strong man, “ whose piety was a fruitful vine twined
round an intellect like an English oak. Much of his work is now buried, but
it is the burial of foundations on which fabrics of strength and use will long
endure.” —(Rev. J. H. Fletcher, Advocate , March 16th, 1889.) When Sydney
University was incorporated in 1850, he was appointed one of the sixteen origi-
nal members of the Senate, where he came into association with William Charles
Wentworth, Sir Charles Nicholson and other well-known Colonists. ‘‘But it was
no common spectacle in those days .... to see a man who united in himself
such decided, and, one might almost say, ‘ narrow denominationalism,’ joined
to such a broad and generous judgment, which made him at home with men of
every school of religious thought and always ready to do them justice. He was
then in the midst of his great work as General Superintendent of Wesleyan
Missions in Australia, and his name will ever be held in reverence by those who
remember with what liberality of gift and labour, with what kindness of heart
benind not a little brusqueness of manner, with what largeness of view and
persistency of purpose he laid the foundation of the present Wesleyan Methodist
Church of Australia, now no longer dependent on the liberality of the English
Missionary Society, but a self-supporting group of Churches, with large powers
of self-government, and an energetic Missionary propaganda of its own.”—
(Ibid)


Mr. Boyce was one of the Committee appointed to form the magnificent
library of the University, severing his connection with that Institution to return
to England as one of the Secretaries for Foreign Missions, a post which he held
for eighteen years, and in which he distinguished himself by his broad views of
Mission work and his deep interest in the British Colonies. Returning to Syd-
ney in 1876, he spent the last years of his life in the city which had seen so
much of his useful life’s work, devoting himself in the evening of his years to
literary pursuits, and regularly conducting the service in the Chapel, Toxteth
Park. Here on the Bth March, 1889, he died suddenly at midday at the age
of 84. Much of his enormous reading is put into two books on which he
lavished much time; “The Higher Criticism ,” and “An Introduction to the
Study of History .” “In the first of these books one is struck with the large-
ness of heart and generous judgment of the writer, whose satire usually was
so keen and swift upon anything he disliked, who heartily disapproved of nearly
all the writers that he criticised, and yet, who resolutely maintained a certain
judicial fairness in discussing them. In both these books one is impressed
with the vast range of the author’s reading in almost all directions ; the only
fault one is disposed to find is that we have not more of the author himself.
Whenever he gives us his own thoughts, you seem at once to see the man him-
self, so rich in commonsense, so free from affectation of superior learning, and
with an almost cynical pleasure in exploding a sham which would have grati-
fied Carlyle.” —(Ibidy Mr. Boyce was one of the old school of large library
men, and he collected in his time, more than one valuable library, presenting
more than 2000 volumes to the Theological Institution at Stanmore And yet,
though his reading knew no limitations, carrying him into the most distant
fields of Theological discussion, of German Literature, of religious and philo-
sophical speculation, he kept with strict fidelity to the theological lines of the
school in which he had been trained.
The Conference next proceeded to the election of a Secretary, the honour
falling to the Rev. John A. Manton, of Hobart Town; whilst the Revs. Stephen
Rabone and Henry H. Gaud, were appointed sub-Secretaries. The first prayer
was offered by the Rev. Nathaniel Turner, the only representative of the earliest
Missionaries. The Revs. T. N. Hull, William Schofield, J. Eggleston, and B.
Hurst, also joined in prayer, and a most gracious influence prevailed. The
usual questions as to Ministerial status, qualifications, and character, occupied the
attention of the Conference till it adjourned for lunch. The afternoon session
lapsed, for the English mail had arrived that morning, and the longing to pos-
sess the information thus available, was irresistible. The Conference Prayer
Meeting was held in the evening, and was largely attended. It was a “ blessed
season.” Brief addresses were delivered by the President, and the Revs. T.
N. Hull, W. Butters, J. W. Eggleston, J. A. Manton, J. Innes, N. Turner, and
B. Hurst. Those were the days of Spartan discipline, so that it is not sur-
prising to find that the President and some of the senior Ministers met the
Probationers in the York Street Vestry, at 5 o’clock each morning, for the pur-
pose of free conversation and friendly counsel. On Friday evening, sermons
were preached at York Street, Surry Plills and Chippendale Chapels, to large
and attentive congregations. The Conference sermon was preached by Mr.


Hull, being based on the address to the Church at Ephesus. (Rev. ii., 4th
and sth v.). It “ was regarded as one of the most eloquent and powerful dis-
courses delivered in Sydney. The Ministers present will not soon forget their
emotion and vows under the word that night.” At its close, the Sacrament of
the Lord’s Supper was administered to the Ministers and a large number of
communicants.
On Saturday morning at 6 a.m., five young Ministers, about to be received
into full connexion with the Conference, were examined in theology by the
President and some of the senior Ministers. Ihe examination being satisfac-
tory, it was resolved that their ordination take place on Wednesday evening,
23rd, at York Street. This “ very interesting and impressive service ” commenced
with hymn 744, and prayer by the Revs. N. 1 urner and T. N. Hull. The Presi-
dent read part of the 20th Chapter of the Acts, and John G. Millard, James
Somerville, John W. Pemell, W. Currey and Joseph Fillingham, gave brief, but
distinct accounts of their conversion to God and their call to the Ministry.
The usual questions were asked, each candidate was presented with a Bible,
and, by the laying on of hands by the President and the senior Ministers, they
were thus publicly set apart to the work of the Christian Ministry. Address-
ing himself first to the audience, the President said that the Ministry was an
ordinance of God. There were two points that the Wesleyan Church particu-
larly insisted upon: personal piety and a Divine call to the Ministry. And
although it was the duty of the Ministers to look out faithful men to entiust
with the Ministry, they took their people with them in the affair, who had the
power to prevent improper persons from being admitted. The Quarterly
Meeting of the Circuits had first recommended these young men as candidates
for the Ministry; these Quarterly Meetings were composed of-the Officers of
the Church as well as the Ministers. These young men had also undergone
an examination at the District Meeting. Their intellectual powers, their re-
ligious state, their acquaintance with doctrine, and their attachment to the Wes-
leyan discipline had been enquired into, and proving satisfactory they had been
employed as probationers. Recently they had been subjected to a public and
private examination in the Conference, and by the solemn and unanimous vote
of their Brethren, had been admitted into the full Ministry; they were now to
be, by a solemn and formal act, publicly set apart to the work.
Proceeding to address the candidates for ordination, the President said he
did not intend to enlarge on their duties and responsibilities; he had only to
direct their attention to them. Their office was honourable, but in proportion
to this were its duties and responsibilities. The rewards of fidelity both here
and hereafter were great; equally so would be the condemnation should the y
prove faithless. Let them remember God’s love in the exercise of their Minis-
try ; present it to mankind, offer a present, free, full salvation ; exhibit the lov-
ing' character of their Heavenly Father. Their experience had vindicated the
Divine prerogative to select Plis own Ambassadors. He looked at the moral
and religious world, its awful disorganisation, and he could not consider this as
its normal state; it was a fallen world. They must look upon themselves as a
class of instrumentalities by which God would affect great moral changes in the


world. On their faithfulness, the salvation of multitudes might depend; future
ages might be affected by it. They were but men, and that constituted one
ground of fitness. They had human sympathies. Angels knew more, but they
had no such identical sympathies ; angels never felt the burden of sin, never
felt their need of Christ’s sacrifice. They had felt this, and this made them more
suitable. They should look well to themselves ; success much depended upon
the character of the instrument; it must be a gracious instrument; it must
be in tune- —the intellect enriched with knowledge, the heart inflamed with zeal.
There must be diligence, a desire for usefulness ; there must be expectancy ; the
soul must be ardent in desire relying on God for success and expecting it.
Theirs must be a soulsaving Ministry. Why were they thus set apart but to
convert souls as well as to feed the Church? If they ceased to be a converting
Ministry, either God was changed or they were faithless. They had mental
work to do. It was not in the nature of things that unintelligent piety should
act on mind. They were bound to cultivate their minds. In proportion to
their laborious diligence to acquire intelligence, they might expect the light and
assistance of the Holy Spirit. All mental effort, however, would be without
success unless a deep sympathy for souls was cultivated. A man who had no
sympathy for the state of the Church and the conversion of the world, could
have no call to the Ministry, and the sooner he abandoned it the better. Theirs
was a Ministry of love , and not mere combative argument. They had no special
call to try to save sinners unless they felt for them.
With reference to their Brethren, they had a peculiar relation to them.
Their Connexional itinerancy rendered them dependent on each other; there
should be a spirit of union ; they should endeavour to admire each other’s ex-
cellencies, and bear with each other’s infirmities. They had a relation to the
people. Theirs was a popular Ministry, but no mere intellectuality would ensure
this hold upon the people’s esteem. Their people would not value them on
account of their reputed learning, but their positive usefulness. They must
be working men , and let them be amongst the people what they really were,
and not put on a character for sanctity they did not possess ; not to be un-
natural so as to have a grave and sanctimonious appearance in certain positions,
and be light and trifling in others. They would have to meet their Classes
at the Quarterly visitations. Some had disparaged these meetings, and pre-
judice had been created by their inefficiency, but he considered them a most
important means of grace. They should endeavour to make them profitable.
What a nursery was the Class Meeting! What a source of information! It
exhibited religion embodied in human experience. A glorious future was
before them if faithful. They might see great changes in the Colonies, political
and other changes, but God was unchangeable. Truth changed not. The
various mutations of the political world could not alter the principles laid down
in the New Testament. To the end of time it would be true that “whosoever
shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.” The Revs. J. A. Manton
and D. J. Draper then engaged in prayer, and the meeting closed at 10 o’clock.

Balmain.


On the Conference Sunday, 21st January, special sermons were preached
in all the Chapels in Sydney and the neighbourhood, and also at Parramatta
and Windsor. The Stationing Committee met on Friday, Monday, Tuesday
and Wednesday mornings at 6 o’clock, services were conducted every evening in
the principal Chapels, and the morning and afternoon sessions were given to Con-
ference business. What that business was it is difficult to set forth in detail,
owing to the paucity of record ; but we know from the Minutes that Horton
College in Tasmania was founded, the Rev. J. A. Manton being appointed first
Principal. The Plan submitted by the British Conference was also discussed
at length and accepted, subject to several suggested alterations. The most im-
portant of these had reference to the appointment of the President and to the
claim of the Missionaries to return to England. The Plan set forth that the
President should be appointed by the English Conference. The Australasian
Conference suggested that it be allowed to nominate the President by ballot
for each succeeding year, and to this suggestion the English Conference agreed.
The right of Missionaries to return to England was also continued to them.
A scheme was submitted suggesting three or more Annual Conferences with a
General Conference meeting every three or four years ; but though this was
advocated by some of the ablest Ministers, it was not entertained, being lost
by a narrow majority. The New South Wales District prepared a Plan for the
formation of a Fund for the support of Superannuated Preachers and the
Widows of Preachers. The Conference, preferring to remit this question to
the Connexional Committee in each District for consideration and support, did
not then sustain the scheme. The same District sought permission to form the
Church Sustentation and Extension Society ; and it also outlined a Plan of Mis-
sionary Management, including a General Committee consisting of an equal
number of Ministers and Laymen, namely, six each for New South Wales,
Victoria, Van Dieman’s Land, South Australia, Auckland, and Wellington. An
Executive was also formed, subordinate to the General Committee. The follow-
ing Laymen were nominated by the District Meeting as eligible for election to the
Conference Committees:—For the Contingent Fund and Chapel Building Com-
mittee: Messrs. G. Allen, W. Speer, W. Love, R. Mansfield, J. Caldwell, M.
Blanchard, A. Howitt, A. Fletcher, T. Cowlishaw, W. Bailey, J. j'esson, Hard-
wick, J. Whiting, J. Byrnes, J. E. Pearce, W. Currey, senr., T. Holme, T. P.
Reeve, W. Bailey, G. IT Tempest, J. R. Andrews, E. Dawson, S. Paul, S. Owen,
J. Nott, J. Dawson, J. Mills, J. Glasson, J. Falkiner, C. IT. Walsh, J. Neale, G.
Somerville, and G. Black. For the Missionary Committee: Messrs. G. W.
Allen, W. Speer, J. Caldwell, W. Love, J. Pemell, M. Blanchard, T. Cowlishaw,
Hardwick, J. Dawson, W. Currey, J. Byrnes, and R. Little.
The question of Education was considered, and the Conference recom-
mended “ our Brethren and friends to co-operate heartily with the Legislature
in rendering this less perfect mode of Education (so far as the religious element
is concerned) as efficient as possible.”* Several important resolutions bearing
on Sunday School work were also set forth, the Conference calling the atten-
tion of Ministers and friends to the regulations of the Connexion bearing- on the
o
* This refers to non-denominational schools.


management of Sunday Schools. Higher Class education was also discussed,
and the Conference delivered its judgment on Government Grants for Religious
Purposes. It was not, it said, prepared to advocate the continuance of State
support to religion, but so long as it was the law of most of the Colonies it could
not insist upon the relinquishment of a just claim to a fair share according to their
proportionate standing in the Census returns. “ The question appears to the
Conference to be one not involving any New Testament principle, but to be
simply one of expediency respecting which men of equal judgment and piety
may innocently differ in opinion and action.” The regular collections to be
made “in all our Circuits ” were specified. They were: “ The Missions to the
Heathen,” the Wesleyan Church Extension Fund, the Chapel and Building
Fund, the Education of Preachers’ Children, and the Fund for the support of
Supernumeraries and Widows. “ The Annual Address of the Conference to
the Methodist Societies ” was read and approved; and the Conference also
presented an Address to Plis Excellency Sir William Denison, on January 31st,
1855, in which it congratulated the Governor on his appointment, and expressed
deep anxiety “ for the perpetuation of that loyal and dutiful feeling towards our
gracious Sovereign, and our beloved Fatherland, which is as yet all but universal
in these Colonies.” The Conference forwarded the following address to the
British Conference;—
“ Rev. Fathers and Brethren,
“ In addressing you, for the first time, in the new relation in which
we stand toward you, we are mainly impressed with the sense of our obligations
for the many favours bestowed upon us, and for the long continued and patient
liberality displayed towards the Churches of Australia and Polynesia, which now
form by their union under our Conference, the Wesleyan Methodist Church in
Australasia. We desire to be found faithful stewards of the spiritual truths and
Godly discipline which we have received from you, so that through our instru-
mentality the blessings of our common Christianity may be widely diffused and
transmitted in succeeding generations in this Southern World in which our lot
is cast. Our Conference has been a most happy one, undisturbed by any serious
differences of opinion. We have to rejoice in the gradually increasing prosper-
ity of the work of God, both in the Colonies and in the Missions. In con-
templating the results of these Missions which commenced only thirty-seven
years ago, and which for some years were very limited in their operations, we
must exclaim ‘What hath God wrought?’ We have now in connection with
us 116 Ministers, besides a number of Native Assistant Missionaries, nearly 800
Chapels, and other preaching places, 19,897 Church Members, with 1,958 on
Trial. Beginning our separate ecclesiastical existence with such advantage,
and surrounded as we are by so many openings for usefulness among the Euro-
pean Colonists and the Polynesian Islanders, we trust that by the blessing of
God we shall be distinguished by ‘ labours more abundant,’ and that while our
Pauls plant and our Apollos water, God will give the increase.


“ You will perceive by our Mission that in our financial arrangements we
provide for systematic efforts to extend our usefulness as a Church in these
Colonies and the Mission Fields. Our difficulties, in this respect, arise rather
from the want of men, than of the means of their support. A large number of
respectably educated and zealous young men, properly trained by previous
labour as Local Preachers, and approved and accredited by us, would find
among us a sphere second to none in the world. But we need men to labour in
the bush as Missionary Evangelists, with bodies adapted to endurance and
fatigue, and with mental and moral energies which will not flag under either
physical or intellectual privations. We rely upon you to add to your former
kindnesses this grace also, and to send us out a suitable supply of working
material, so that we may with renewed activity and confidence, address ourselves
to the great work before us in this section of the Lord’s vineyard.
We can assure you that the Mission to the Heathen will lie very near to
oui hearts. Our commission is like yours, to ‘ preach the Gospel to every crea-
ture,’ and we are convinced that our prosperity in the Colonial work will, in a
great degree, be dependent upon our faithfulness to the cause of Christ among
the perishing Heathen. We have already made ‘ a beginning ’in these Colo-
nies, each of which may be regarded as a spiritual ‘ Jerusalem,’ and now we feel
increasingly the obligation of preaching ‘ repentance and remission of sins ’ ‘ in
His name among all nations.’ We hope in a brief period to spare you any
further anxiety or expense in reference to the Polynesian Missions ; but in order
to enable us to ensure results so desirable you must send us more men.
“ Our public documents may probably strike you as being deficient in the
expression of those conventional amenities towards our official Brethren, which
usage has sanctioned among us, and which may be regarded by some as a
graceful recognition by the Churches of the special services which have been
rendered to them. But we feel that our position differs materially from that of
our Fathers and Brethren at home. We are few in number, and the majority
of the senior preachers fill official positions. There are then so many deserving
our thanks and so few to express them that we deem it advisable to omit all
display of mutual regard. We are happily so united in the bond of brotherly
affection that no one in these Colonies will misinterpret our silence, and you
will appreciate our motives. Besides this, the greatness of our responsibility,
and the importance of the crisis in our Connexional Polity had their natural
influence upon us. We felt that we met under extraordinary circumstances, ‘ the
harvest is truly great, the labourers are few,’ and the claims of the work so
pressing that we are naturally led to follow literally the Divine precept given
under similar circumstances, ‘ salute no man by the way.’ (Luke x., 4.) And
now, Fathers and Brethren, we beseech you, ‘pray for us that the word of the
Lord may have free course and be glorified.’ ”

account of “ the loss of his excellent wife,” and deeply regretted “ the loss of
his invaluable services as an eloquent and most able Minister of Christ.” In
reference to the Rev. F. Lewis’ retirement, it expressed its regret that his
health had not been restored, and placed on “ permanent record the high sense
it entertains of the distinguished zeal, and labours most abundant which have
characterised his Ministry in the several Circuits in which he has been stationed
during the last nineteen years, and also its devout thanksgiving to Almighty

enlargement of the borders of the Church which has attended that Ministry.
Fifteen additional Ministers were expected from England shortly to labour in
various parts of the Colonies.
The relative strength of Methodism under the jurisdiction of the Confer-
ence may be gathered from the following figures: —
There were 35,576 children in the Day and Sunday Schools, 1,958 on
trial for membership, and about 50 native Ministers not included in the number
reported above. Mr. Young obtained the following particulars from the
Rev. R. Mansfield previous to his return. The centesimal increase upon their
own respective members of the following denominations stood thus: —Wesleyan
Methodists, 278.16 per cent. ; Roman Catholics, 76.05 per cent. ; Church of Scot-
land, 64.37 P er cen b ; Church of England, 40.35 per cent. ; and the increase on
each thousand for the last 10 years was as follows: Wesleyan Methodists, 32 per
thousand ; Roman Catholics, 23 ; Church of Scotland, 1 ; while the Church of
England showed a decrease of 81 per thousand. Mr. Mansfield also stated that
the Wesleyans stood well in the estimation of the public, and had done so for-
more than 33 years ; that they were loyal to the Queen ; that the result of the
altered ecclesiastical arrangements about to be applied to the Wesleyan
Churches of Australia would be beneficial to all concerned, and tend to the effi-
cient working of Methodism ; and that long before the gold-fields were thought
of he foresaw that Australia must become a great nation. And Judge Therry, a
Roman Catholic, in writing of the various religious denominations at that date
says: “The Wesleyan Body, whose religious zeal and the moral excellence of
whose members merit the highest commendation. It is no slight praise to say
of them that they are seldom seen in any of our Courts of Justice —in the
Criminal Court, never.” ( Reminiscences , p. 153.) But even here opinions
differ. The Wesleyans, having availed themselves of the financial help afforded
by State aid, Dr. Lang wrote: “It is much to be lamented that this influential,
ecclesiastical body should latterly have placed itself in opposition to the cause of
civil and religious liberty, both at home and abroad. It is matter of history that
the celebrated John Wesley actually encouraged the Americans in their famous
struggle for national independence ; but spiritual despotism and political servility
seem to be the watchwords of his followers born in England and in the Colonies.


THE FOUNDRY, LONDON
To consent to eat their miserable ‘grub’ out of the same Government trough
with Romanists and Puseyites—to do all in their power to support and per-
petuate a system which produces such abominations
‘ ’Tis strange, ’tis passing strange !
’Tis pitiful ! ’tis wondrous pitiful!
1 wish I had not heard it!’”
’Pis pitiful, indeed! But not more pitiful or strange than that a scholar
and a public man, such as Dr. Lang, should allow bitter feeling to guide the
pen where judicial fairness and courtesy are expected.*
* This kind of language is characteristic of Dr. Lang when writing of those from whom he
differed. It vitiates his style, and does much to mar a work which otherwise is most valuable.

CHAPTER XV.
THE AUSTRALIAN CONEERENCE.
1555 - 1573.
IT will not be necessary to make further reference to the first Conference
as that event has been entered into fully in a preceding chapter. We
may therefore proceed to deal with the developments which took place
during the regime of the Australian Conference. Dealing first with
purely local work let it be stated that the Conference of 1855 approved of
the separation of Newtown from the Sydney South Circuit, the Newtown
Circuit to comprise Newtown, Botany, Botany Bay, Stanmore, Camperdown,
Toxteth, Ashfield, Canterbury and Moorfield; and Sydne}' South to include
Chippendale, Hay Street, Bishopgate, and Redfern. Next year the Hunter
River Circuit, which had assumed extensive proportions was formed into three
named respectively Maitland, Newcastle, and Singleton. Two years later
the Turon Gold Fields were separated from Bathurst, and the following year,
Wollongong was divided into three, Kiama and Shoalhaven forming new Cir-
cuits. Dungog and Clarence Town were also separated from the Maitland
Circuit. In iB6O the Orange district was formed into a Circuit, and Goulburn
was divided into Goulburn, Yass and Gunning, and Braidwood. The
growth of Methodism in the Windsor Circuit made it necessary in the year
1861 to form another Circuit with Penrith as its head. Further divisions were
imperative in iB6O when Balmain, Ashfield, and the Lower Hawkesbury Cir-
cuits were formed. As development proceeded other divisions, which it is not
necessary to name, were made.
The passing of the Mission into a self-governing body necessitated revising
the list of questions for the regulation of District Meeting business. The Revs
S. Rabone, John Eggleston and H. H. Gaud were appointed to prepare a list
of questions to be laid before the next Sydney District Meeting with a view
to submission to the following Conference. These questions were adopted,
and are to be found in the Conference Minutes of 1858. In substance,
they are intact to-day. The Conference of 1861, with an eye to the future,
deemed it wise to have the Minutes of the respective Districts bound, the Pre-
sident and Missionary Secretary being authorised to give effect to this decision.
But a much more important conclusion, so far as New South Wales was con-
cerned, was reached in the year 1863, when the New South Wales District was


divided into five, in consonance with the District Meeting recommendation.
These districts were named: Sydney, Bathurst, Maitland, Goulburn and
Queensland. As an indication of the extent of Methodism in the Colony at
that date, the names of the Circuits included in these Districts may be given.
Sydney District: Sydney North, Sydney South, Sydney East, Newtown, Parra-
matta, Windsor, Castlereagh and Penrith, Camden, Wollongong, Kiama, and
Moruya. Bathurst District; Bathurst, Orange, Turon, Mudgee, Fish River
West, and Forbes. Maitland District; Maitland, Newcastle, Singleton, Dungog,
Manning River and Port Macquarie, Armidale and Grafton. Goulburn Dis-
trict; Goulburn, Yass and Gunning, Braidwood, and Adelong. Queensland
District: Brisbane, Ipswich and Warwick.
With a view to preserve uniformity in Church worship the method of giv-
ing out hymns was brought before the Conference of 1861. The spirit of the
brethren appears to have been deeply perturbed by irregularities, for the Con-
ference said; “ The Conference hears with regret of increasingly numerous cases
of departure from our long-established custom of giving out the verse in suc-
cessive portions ; not only because that practice appears to be more conducive
than any other to the ends of devotion, especially on the part of the poor, but
also because any interference with our ordinary modes of worship is, on many
accounts, undesirable ; and while unwilling to urge the discontinuance of the
latter practice where it has long existed, the Conference instructs the Ministers
of the Body to discourage, by all prudent means, its introduction in other places.”
The practice of the early Methodists with regard to Quarterly Fast days was
emphasised, and in 1863 the dates upon which the Quarterly Fasts should be
observed throughout “the Body” were specified as Friday, March 27th, June
26th, October 2nd, and January Bth. The same Conference renewed the testi-
mony which the Wesleyan Church had hitherto borne against “ such public
amusements, games and entertainments, as could not be used to the glory of
God.” It viewed with apprehension the frequent appeals made in the name of
charity, by the promoters of worldly amusements, which aimed at associating
the Church and the world in theatres, balls, and concerts. It affectionately
reminded the Societies under its care that both the spirit and the letter of the
New Testament law were violated when Christians resorted to such amuse-
ments ; that evidence was given of a decay of spiritual religion in the heart, and
that by such conduct it seemed to admit what was affirmed by the world that
religion was an inadequate source of pleasure. For their own sakes, and for
the sake of the young people of their families they earnestly entreated the
members to unite with the Ministers in discountenancing such amusements.
The importance of the preparation and reception of candidates for
the Ministry first claimed attention in 1861, when the Conference decided
that probationers should be required to submit to an examination in Mr.
Wesley’s four volumes of sermons, his Notes on the New Testament, and
Bishop Pearson’s work on the Creed; the examination to be conducted at


the discretion of the District Chairman. It also gave attention to the
insufficient provision for the theological training of its Ministers, towards which
little had been done. It therefore said that it was expedient to form an
Institution to be called “The Wesleyan Theological Institution for the
improvement of Junior Preachers.” Those who entered this Institution should
be allowed to remain in it for two or three years, as might be consistent
with the Claims of the Church for the immediate supply of Circuits and
Missions. But this Institution came not, and two years later attention was
again called to the matter. But all that the Conference did was to express
the opinion that it was highly desirable all Preachers on trial should be
thoroughly conversant with the best writings in Divinity in their own Church,
and the works of Puritan Divines. The Chairmen were directed to institute
an annual examination in Wesley’s Sermons, and such other Theological
works as they deemed essential, after enquiry, for the probationers to
study.
At this initial stage of self government the British Conference exercised
a watchful and paternal oversight over the Australian Church. It had
reserved to itself the power to appoint the President, permitting the Con-
ference to make the nomination ; and it regularly sent an answer to tire
address which was forwarded annually. But it did more than this, for as
opportunity offered it appointed some of its leading Ministers to visit
Australia, a practice which proved of great assistance to Colonial
Methodism in its early stages. The first of these distinguished men
to visit the Conference was the Rev. F. J. Jobson, D.D., particulars of whose
journey may be found in a volume * published on his return. Referring to
this visit the Conference said: “ That by his eloquent and powerful Ministry,
his able and judicial counsels in the Conference, the cheerful readiness with
which he had entered into the plans and arrangements for carrying on the
work of God, were of very great service, for which it wished to express its
high appreciation.” It also conveyed its cordial and respectful thanks to Dr.
Jobson “ for his truly eloquent and powerful sermon preached before the Con-
ference.” And they requested him to act as their representative to the next
British Conference. Dr. Jobson arrived in New South Wales on Sunday,
January, 1861, preaching at eleven o’clock the same day in the Surry Hills
Church to a large congregation from the words: “ God is Love.” “ Very
many shed silent tears of joyous admiration of the love of God, as the preacher
expatiated on his rich and inexhaustible theme.” In the evening he preached
at York Street, and on the following Monday evening he was accorded a public
reception. “It was one of the most delightful and enthusiastic meetings,”
The Advocate remarked. The Rev. John Eggleston, President, presided, and
the Rev. Stephen Rabone read an address of welcome. “ The unity of one
great Methodist Church throughout the world in the maintenance of the truth
of God and the evangelisation of men, appears to us to be amongst the things

most important and necessary to the universal prevalence of the Kingdom of
Christ; and we rejoice in Dr. Jobson’s visit to these shores as helpful to this
great end.” Dr. Jobson wrote; —“They all received me with the
heartiest affection, and gave me as cordial a greeting as could
possibly be given to a brother by a body of Ministers. They
evinced strong emotion at the mention of the fathers of the British
Conference, and of the love of all their brethren to them. They received the
official Address from the British Conference, delivered to them, with marked
courtesy and respect; and they heard an accompanying extempore address
with attention and signs of fraternal gladness. Throughout the entire pro-
ceedings they showed the truest veneration and love both for the parent Con-
ference and the Methodists of England. We discussed together freely, and
at considerable length, vital and delicate questions on the relative position and
powers of the parent and the affiliated Conference-; and in all, not an ungenerous
sentiment, or ungentlemanly word, was spoken. We argued fully the pressure
of the large Mission-work upon the Colonies, and which amidst financial
difficulties bore heavily upon their home-funds and personal comforts, when
as line a flame of missionary zeal burst forth as ever kindled in a missionary
meeting at home.” (Notes by the Way, p. 172).
The year 1864 saw the arrival of two other distinguished men. The
first was the Rev. E. E. Jenkins, M.A., from India, and the Rev. William Taylor,
or “Californian Taylor” as he was popularly called, was the second. Mr.


Jenkins, who was General Superintendent of Missions in Continental India,
was on his way to England. Being in Melbourne during the Conference
sessions, he was invited to attend. Speaking of his eminent gifts and effective
pulpit labours, the Conference said that interest had been excited by his lectures
and addresses, and that his visit had been received with joy and profit. The
Rev. William Taylor came on a financial Mission, and though the Conference
thought it unwise and impolitic to encourage visitors to take up large sums in
the Church while the demands for their own work were so frequent, they made
an exception in Mr. Taylor’s case, permitting the Chairmen of Districts and
Superintendents of Circuits to act on their own initiative and responsibility.
It also felt constrained to express its gratitude to God for the piety, zeal, and
acceptable labours of Mr. Taylor, and his remarkable success in winning
souls.
Mr. Taylor was a typical American, with methods all his own. But the
greatest testimony to the wisdom of these methods is the fact that his work
endures to this day, many in New South Wales remembering him with gratitude
as the instrument under God in their salvation. In addition to the wide-
spread testimony borne to Mr. Taylor’s wonderful spiritual power, many
amusing incidents are told of his quaintness of speech and ready repartee.
His way of putting the truth was forcible, and he could compress into a short
sentence that which it was difficult to forget. The Rev. John Watsford, who
was associated with Mr. Taylor in his work in Adelaide, says that at one of
Mr. Taylor’s meetings a Scotchman was praying in what was to many an un-
known tongue.. This was bringing a coldness on the meeting. Nudging
Mr. Watsford, Mr. Taylor said: “ Is not that about as good as the tune from a
cross cut saw?” And when the earnest Scotchman had finished Mr. Taylor
said: “ Thank God that job is over!” At another meeting a Baptist somewhat
unwisely introduced the question of immersion among the new converts,
quoting the passage “ Buried with Him in baptism,” to add force to his remarks.
Mr. Taylor met this by saying: “Well, Brother, if you will have it in that way
you must have altogether ; and you know that He was three days and nights
in the grave. What do you say to that ? I tell you if you have the whole
thing you will come up as dead as a salted herring.” Speaking one day of
the secret of his success as a revivalist, he said: “ I look to the Spirit. He
teaches me. I get my message direct from Him. Igo to the meeting
expecting the presence and power of the Holy Ghost, and He never fails me.
To this period belongs the celebration of an event of great and wide-spread
interest, that event being the Jubilee of the Australasian Methodist Church
in the year 1864. The first step towards the marking of such an interesting
event was the appointment of a special Committee, convened during the Con-
ference by the request of the General Missionary Committee. This meeting
took place at Wesley Church, Melbourne, on February 2nd, 1864, when the
Rev. James Buffer, the President, presided. The meeting heartily sympathised


with the Jubilee celebrations in England, and it recommended the Conference
to make arrangements for a movement in all the Colonial Districts. The
following objects were specified as worthy of the liberality which it was hoped
would be displayed: the establishment of a Central Theological Institution ;
the extension of Missionary operations in New Guinea or some other field
not already occupied; the raising in each Colony of a Loan Fund for the
relief of Trusts; and for the encouragement of Trustees in the erection of
Churches and parsonages. The Conference adopted these recommendations,
directing the Chairman of each District to initiate steps for the celebration in
his own District.
New South Wales Methodists first thought to celebrate this event on the
10th August, but unavoidable delay held it over till the Bth November. The
Jubilee spirit already engendered was not, however, permitted to decline. Its
inauguration in Sydney took place on Monday, with a public service in York
Street Church. The Rev. Stephen Rabone, the Chairman, preached an
excellent sermon to a large congregation from the words ‘‘ Consider the work of
God.” In his closing remarks Mr. Rabone said that only a few who took part
in that Jubilee would take part in the Centenary of Australasian Methodism,
but these few would tell the doings of their fathers to the generations following.
Let their doings then be worthy of the remembrance of their children. They
boasted of a glorious ancestry; let them act in a manner worthy of their
ancestors, and transmit their name and fame untarnished. On the following
Tuesday a Public Prayer Meeting was held at 7 a.m. in the York Street Church,
followed by a Public Breakfast in the Masonic Hall at nine o’clock, attended
by between four and five hundred persons. At the Public Meeting which
followed, Mr. T. W. Bowden was voted to the chair, and the Revs. S. Rabone,
R. Mansfield, G. Hurst, W. Kelynack, and Messrs. James Byrnes, Peacock, L.
Kendall, G. W. Allen, R. Love, M.L.A., J. Caldwell, M.L.A., and J. Dawson
took part. This was followed by a Public Meeting in the evening, presided
over by the Hon. G. Allen, and addressed by the Revs. Ralph Mansfield, James
Watkin, W. Kelynack, W. Curnow and S. Rabone. The spirit of liberality
rested on the people, enabling Mr. Rabone to state with pleasure at the close
of the evening meeting, that the contributions to the Fund already amounted
to
Describing this meeting The Advocate said that “it was evident the
Jubilee movement in Sydney would be a success, as from all parts of the city
and suburbs the people flocked into York Street Church to hear the Jubilee
sermon. The early morning prayer meeting was well attended, and the spirit
of grace and supplication rested upon the assembled worshippers. The plead-
ings for an outpouring of the Holy Spirit and the conversion of souls were
fervent, and the Spirit’s presence and power were felt.” The Breakfast
Meeting was described as “ one of the most respectable and influential
assemblies of Wesleyans which we have ever seen in this city; the

spacious Hall was filled in every part and with all classes of our
community. The rich and poor met together, animated by the
spirit of gratitude and love. The whole meeting seemed to be
moved by one spirit; that of grateful recognition of the spiritual blessings which,
under God, Methodism had conferred on themselves and on their families.”
Ihe Love Feast was a season of great refreshing. The people spoke of their
strong attachment to the Church of their choice, and of their desire to see it
prosper for the spiritual benefit of the whole Continent. The evening meeting
was no less marked by the spirit of liberality and hopefulness. The Chairman,
and another gentleman, who wished his name to be unknown, gave T250 each,
while many other sums as great in proportion to the means of the givers were
promised. The people gave willingly, while some contributed in the spirit of


Christian sacrifice, being fully resolved in this way to make a grateful return to
God for benefits received. “We have no doubt,” the report concluded, “ that
the noble example set at the Central Meeting will be followed in all the Circuits,
one of which is to be held not only in the Sydney District, but in every part
of New South Wales and Queensland.”
The Goulburn Circuit was the first to follow the fine example set by Sydney,
initiating the movement by means of a Breakfast and Public Meeting, at which
addresses were delivered by the Revs. H. H. Gaud, James Phillips, F. Brentnall,
G. Lane, W. H. George, W. T. Pincombe, and Messrs. William Davies, C. H.
Walsh, and R. Blatchford. The amount contributed was 10s. 6d. Other
Circuits were not slow to do their part, and so successful throughout Australia
were the proceedings that at the following Conference this resolution was
adopted: “ I he Conference desires to acknowledge the blessing and presence
cf Almighty God, vouchsafed to the Wesleyan Methodist Church during the
period of the celebration of the Jubilee, and gratefully recognises the spirit
of liberality displayed by our people.”
I he development in Church extension noticeable in Mr. Boyce’s time con-
tinued during this period. The first Church of significance was erected at West
Maitland, the old Church built by Mr. Ledsam and his co-workers being
inadequate for the increasing congregations. This beautiful edifice, as it was
then described, was opened on the 13th of January, 1859, when the Rev. William
Hessel preached in the forenoon to a large and deeply attentive congregation,
his subject being “I he House of God.” The Rev. John Eggleston preached
to a still larger congregation in the evening. The services were continued on
the following Sunday, and the Revs. W. Kelynack, John Eggleston, and John
Watsford were the Preachers. The proceeds of the opening services were
£124. “ The whole of the services,” said the Christian Advocate , "were
numerously attended, especially on Sunday evening, when it is believed that
nearly seven hundred persons were assembled together, thus showing the large
capacity of the building. A large portion of the Chapel is occupied with pews,
nearly all of which are let already. We believe that with reference to the
number of attendants on public worship the erection of this place of w T orship
will be a most successful enterprise.” The following year Dowling Street
Chapel, Woolloomooloo, was opened, the dates being the 19th and 20th of
June. The pitiless and pelting rain had fallen in torrents for some days pre-
viously, and a cold wind was blowing from the south. But even this, combined
with the mud in the streets, of which there was a plentiful supply, did not
prevent the ladies from gathering in large numbers. The Rev. William Hessel
preached the morning sermon, the afternoon service being taken by the Rev.
W. Cuthbertson, B.A. The Church was inconveniently crowded, numbers not
being able to find standing room. The Superintendent of the Circuit, the
Rev. S. Ironside, preached to a surprisingly large congregation in the evening.
This sermon was followed by a Penitent’s Prayer Meeting, when six or seven

young people knelt at the Communion rail in deep distress. At the Public
Meeting the following evening Mr. John Fairfax took the chair, and addresses
were delivered by the Superintendent and his colleague, and Captain Welch and
Messrs. Garrick and Dean. The weather was again most unpromising, but
notwithstanding these drawbacks, nearly £SO were taken at the opening
services.
Methodism at Newtown was also taking a forward step, the foundation
stone of a new Church being laid by the Hon. George Allen on the 30th
September, 1859. The building was to cost no less than £4,000, and the land
had been purchased for the sum of £I,OOO. Addresses were delivered by the
Revs. Stephen Rabone, Chairman of the District, and George Hurst, the Revs.
J. Eggleston, S. C. Kent (Congregationalist), and J. A. Manton also taking part.
The opening service took place eleven months afterwards. “ The first six
audiences were large and respectable, and evinced their high approval of the
new erection by a noble collection in aid of its funds. Considering the character
and the present times, we think we are justified in designating £207 a noble
contribution for one day, especially as several subsequent collections were con-
templated. The spacious edifice was proved to be admirably adapted for
speaking and hearing, the Preacher’s voice being distinctly audible in every
part. This is a most valuable excellence, and is a matter for congratulation.”
The foundation stone of a new Church at Balmain was laid in the early
part of January, iB6O. “A new era of Wesleyan Church building in this
Colony has already commenced,” said The Advocate. “ Our friends at Maitland
have had the honour of inaugurating it. The people at Bathurst immediately
followed, and now Newtown and Sydney are emulating the good example.
Other projects are in contemplation in the Metropolis which only require a little
time to ripen into action. The necessity is very great and pressing, but it is
as important to avoid rashness and precipitation as it is to escape from lethargy
and inactivity. We require time and a vigorous unfaltering perseverance to
compass the end in a satisfactory manner. Everything we do should be well
done, with an enlightened regard to the necessities of the future.” The new
Chapel at Bathurst was opened on Thursday, May 31st, iB6O, an elaborate and
detailed account of the building being published in The Advocate. The morning
sermon was preached by the Rev. Joseph Oram. The Rev. William Hessel
should have preached on the following Thursday, but Mr. Oram was compelled
to take his place. In the evening a Public Meeting, preceded by a tea, was
held, over 400 persons being present. The new edifice, capable of seating seven
hundred persons, was filled in every part, while many were unable to gain
admission. The chair was taken by Mr. J. T. Lane. Mr. Parker, Secretary
to the Building Committee, made a financial statement, from which it appeared
that nearly £6,000 would be required to complete the building, towards which
they had received £2,600. The meeting was addressed by the Revs. H. H.
Gaud, W. J. K. Piddington, Thomas Angwin, W. Hessel, and Joseph Oram.
The proceeds of the day were upwards of ,£250.

THE NEW GUINEA AND NEW BRITAIN MISSION PARTY.


At Glebe Road, in the Sydney Second Circuit, the comer stone of a new
Church was laid on Good Friday, 1864, by Mr. Allen, of loxteth Park, and was
dedicated to the worship of God on Sunday, nth December, the Revs. William
Taylor (America), Dr. Steel, and Stephen Rabone being the Preachers on that
occasion. The inevitable Public Meeting and Tea followed the next evening,
when five hundred people sat down to tea in a marquee erected in the paddock
opposite the Church. At the Public Meeting, the Rev. J. Bickford, Superin-
tendent of the Circuit, called upon the Hon. George Allen to preside. Addresses
were afterwards delivered by the Revs. George Hurst, William Taylor, Joseph
Oram, R. Sellers, B. Chapman, and Messrs. James Buckland, J. Caldwell, M.L.A.,
and Joseph Wearne. Mr. Wearne estimated the expenditure at ,£2,500, and
the receipts at £1,500. The opening ceremonies were in every way successful.
A new Church at Mudgee was opened this year also under favourable auspices,
the Preachers for the occasion being the Revs. George Hurst and W. Curnow.
Again the Tea Meeting followed. “The tables were loaded to profusion, and
the three hundred who partook of the entertainment, one and all declared that
it was one of the most successful Tea Meetings ever held in Mudgee.” At
the Public Meeting a number of addresses were delivered, the speakers being
the Revs. George Hurst, J. G. Turner, W. Curnow, T. Angwin, and Messrs.
N. P. Bayley, Hardwick, Bridges, and H. Kellett. The estimated cost was
£3,648, towards which £1,600 had been promised.
The foundation stone of a new Church at St. Leonard’s was laid on the
17th September, 1864, by the Rev. William Taylor, of America, who was then
visiting Sydney. Those taking part in the service, in addition to Mr. Taylor,
were the Rev. George Hurst and Mr. E. Vickery. A similar ceremony took
place at Ashfield on the 17th October, in the presence of a large assembly.
“ The site of the building is extremely good, one of the most central and
commanding in the village of Ashfield, and within five minutes walk of the
railway station/' A Tea and Public Meeting followed, and so great were the
expectations of the people that they had engaged a special train to leave Ash-
field at half past nine o’clock, “ for the convenience of Sydney and Newtown
friends.” The Revs. Joseph Oram, J. Bickford, W. Schofield, and S. Rabone
took part, while Mr. E. H. Woodhouse laid the foundation stone. This Church
was opened the following year by the Revs. J. H. Fletcher and W. Curnow.
On the following Wednesday the Rev. William Taylor preached, when a Tea
Meeting followed, at which four hundred persons were present, and a Public
Meeting took place in the Church, the following gentlemen taking part; the
Revs. S. Rabone, Howden (Congregationalist), W. Curnow, William Taylor,
Mr. Reuben Hall, Mr. W. Foster, and Mr. Henson. What was described as
“ the great feature of the week ” took place at Moruya during the month of
December, 1864. “ This,” said The Advocate , “ will probably be reminiscent to
one portion of our community for years to come, and will stand proudly
prominent in the ecclesiastic records of the town whilst recollection retains a
view of this our day.” The foundation stone had been- laid the previous year


by Mr. Jacob Luck. The first sermon in the new Church was preached by the
Rev. George Hurst, and the building was filled to overflowing. The Rev.
William Curnow took the evening service. Nothing so common as a Tea
Meeting was to be held on such a great occasion, and the friends therefore
announced a soiree , to be followed by a Public Meeting. Mr. J. Hawden
presided, and the Revs. George Pickering, George Plurst, W. Curnow, and Mr.
R. Burns delivered addresses. The total cost was £l,lOO, towards which
C 532 12s. had been received. This amount was reduced during the evening
to £3OO, and on Mr. Hurst promising £l5O as a loan, to be paid in five years if
the remaining £l5O should be raised, five ladies, Mrs. J. Hawdon, Miss Brown,
Mrs. Clarke of Bergalia, Mrs. Clarke, of Bodalla, and Miss Foster of Wagonga,
promised to collect the £l5O in the course of the next twelve months. To
crown this successful function the local paper rounded off its report by adding:
“ During the proceedings, the choir performed several pieces of sacred music
with much taste and execution, the last of which brought the meeting to a
termination.” A new Church at Morpeth was also opened this year at a cost
of 2,300. When all the returns were in it was expected that there would
be a debt remaining of £7BB.
A small Church was dedicated to the worship of God at Wagga in May,
1865, by the Rev. H. H. Gaud, Chairman of the District. The Rev. F.
Brentnall made a statement, from which it appeared that the total cost was
£627 16s. 1 id., which had been met with the exception of £199. The opening
of Wesley Church in the Chippendale Circuit was regarded as an event of
great importance. “Itis a chef -d'oeuvre of the Methodist architecture in the
Colony, and is an ornament to the City.” The opening services took place on
the 17th and 24th April, 1867, the Preachers being the Revs. H. H. Gaud,
Stephen Rabone, James Bickford, W. Curnow, J. H. Fletcher, and W. Kelynack.
Although the rain was falling heavily at the time of the Tea Meeting on the
18th, about five hundred persons assembled. Mr. G. W. Allen presided at the
Public Meeting, when it was stated that the cost of the Church was £6,000,
of which amount £4,000 was already paid. The proceeds of the services
amounted to £250. A number of Ministers gave addresses, the Revs. Joseph
Oram, S. Rabone, J. Bickford, George Lane, R. W. Orton, H. H. Gaud, and
H. J. Lavers being included. The Methodists of Goulburn would not allow
themselves to be behind those of Wesley Church. The old Chapel opened in
1848, though subsequently enlarged to double its original size, had to make way
for a much finer building, the foundation stone of which was laid on the 31st
March, 1870, during the pastorate of the Rev. William Curnow. At the opening
services the Revs. W. Curnow, W. Kelynack, and H. H. Gaud took part, the
amount collected at the opening service reaching £3lB, making the total amount
already raised, including the grant, £2,510. At the Public Meeting Mr.
William Davies presided, and appropriate addresses were delivered by several
Ministers and laymen.


1 he Memorial stones of a new Church at Tamworth were laid in October,
1871, during the superintendency of the Rev. J. E. Carruthers. The Memorial
stone was laid by the Rev. W. J. K. Piddington. Describing Mr. Piddington’s
address, The Advocate said: “It is a pity that room cannot be made in The
Advocate for his manly and eloquent statement of the doctrinal belief and
ecclesiastical polity of the people called Methodists. It was an address which
those who were privileged to hear it will not soon forget, and which certainly
must do our cause in Pamworth a great deal of good.” The estimated cost
of the building was £835. On Monday, the 18th December, what was
described as a ceremony of considerable importance to the progress of Metro-
politan Methodism was performed by the Rev. George Hurst. This was
nothing less than the laying of the memorial stone of a new Church at the
corner of William and Forbes Street, Sydney, which, when it was finished,
would be a credit and ornament to that part of the city. The proceedings
were enthusiastic and well attended, the Revs. W. Clarke, G. Martin, J. B.
Waterhouse, G. Hurst, H. H. Gaud, J. Watkin, and Mr. Thomas Rowe taking
part. It was expected that the cost would reach £5,000. The land for a
new site was purchased from Mr. John Fraser for £1,500. At the opening
services the Revs. George Hurst, J. Greenwood, M.A., and J. H. Fletcher
preached appropriate sermons, the Revs. William Clarke and W. Curnow
taking the following Sunday. To Mr. Clarke belongs the honour of having
inaugurated the scheme, and to the Rev. George Hurst praise was due for his
liberal contributions and his efforts on behalf of the Trust. At the Public
Meeting, Mr. Edmund Webb presided, and in addition to the Ministers already
named, Messrs. J. Wearne, John Hardy, Wilson, Rowe, W. H. McClelland and
B. James gave addresses. The opening services were described as eminently
successful from every point of view.
Amongst the Ministers who passed away was the Rev. David Hazlewood,
who had laboured for ten years in the Fiji Islands, where he was specially
useful in the important work of translation for which he was peculiarly fitted.
He prepared a good Grammar and a copious Dictionary of the Fijian language,
and also translated the whole of the Scriptures of the Old Testament into that
tongue. Affliction compelled him to return to New South Wales in 1853, where
he continued the revision of his translation, when death terminated his valuable
career on the 30th October, 1855. The Rev. Benjamin Hurst died two years
later on the sth of January, 1857. In addition to his work at the Buntingdale
Mission, he devoted himself with great energy to ministering to the spiritual
wants of the settlers in the different Colonies. Two hours before his death
he awoke from a stupor, and after a smile said: “ I have been half way home to
glory.” The Rev. John Crawford, who had just entered upon his Missionary
career, died of dysentery at Ovalau on the 20th January, 1858. He had
travelled two years only in New South Wales. The Rev. Walter Lawry died in
peace at Parramatta on the 30th March, 1859, in the 66th year of his age and
the 42nd of his Ministry. After his return from Tonga he fulfilled the duties

THE HANDWRITING OF THE REV. D. J. DRAPER.
of the Ministry for many years in England, and was appointed in 1843 as
General Superintendent of Missions in New Zealand, and visitor to those in
Polynesia, an office which he held for 11 years. Vigorous in the performance
of duty, his ministry was attractive and sometimes powerful, and his cheerful
social qualities won him many friends.
Three others prominently identified with Methodism in its initial stages
were called home the year following, the first being the Rev. J. A. Manton, to
whom reference is made in another part of this work. The next was the Rev.
Nathaniel Turner, the pioneer Missionary to Wesleydale, New Zealand. He
laboured successfully at Hobart Town, Launceston, Sydney, and Parramatta,
becoming a Supernumerary in the year 1850. He was a faithful friend, an
affectionate Pastor, a successful Preacher, and few Ministers have preached the
Gospel over a more extensive field. “In the social and domestic relations he
was greatly beloved. Held in the highest esteem by all who knew him, he
is embalmed in the affections of a large and godly family to the second genera-
tion. The word “ Victory ” was on his lips as he passed to his reward. The
Rev. Jonathan Innes died at Nelson, May 6th, 1864, aged 55 years, the latter
part of his ministry having been spent in New Zealand. He was a good


Pastor, and an affectionate colleague labouring with acceptance and usefulness.
Ihe Rev. Francis Tuckfield died in the following year at Portland, Victoria,
He will be remembered for his devoted work among the Aborigines. The
greater part of his ministry was spent in Victoria. He was an earnest and
warm hearted Preacher, possessing great power in prayer, and he was an
assiduous overseer of the flock of Christ. After a painful illness, he died a
triumphant death.
A shock was felt throughout Australia when it became known in the early
part of 1866, that the Rev. D. J. Draper and his wife had gone down in the
S.S. London in the Bay of Biscay. Mr. Draper, after many years’ laborious and
successful toil in which he acted as pioneer in New South Wales, Victoria, and
South Australia, received the permission of the Conference to visit England
in the year 1864. At the termination of his visit, from which he received great
enjoyment and edification, he set out on his return journey, trusting that there
yet lay before him many years of useful service. But God had willed it other-
wise. When in the Bay of Biscay, terrific seas broke over the ship, and she
began to settle down. On entering the saloon, the Captain said; “ Ladies,
there is no hope for us, lam afraid. Nothing short of a miracle can save us.”
Mr. Draper calmly replied; “Then let us pray.” He also added: “Well my
friends, the Captain informs us that our ship is doomed, and there is no hope
of our getting into port; but the Great Captain above tells us there is hope,
and that we may all get safe to Heaven.” Mr. Draper met his death when
engaged preaching and praying, and pointing agonised souls to the Everlasting
Refuge. Nineteen only out of 263 on board were saved. Thus this noble man
met death, fitting conclusion of a life devoted to the great work of rescuing
souls.
“ Spoken the last farewell,
The last sigh spent, Life’s weary journey o*er,
No ruthless hand shall ever part them more. 53
The Rev. Joseph Fillingham passed away at Grafton in 1808 at the age of
42, the funeral being conducted by Mr. William Stuckley in the absence of a
Minister. As a Preacher he was clear, instructive, and often eloquent, and in
all departments of Circuit work he laboured diligently and with success to
extend and strengthen the cause of Methodism. Though suffering severely
he triumphed at last. The Rev. Richard Amos died on the i;th November,
1870, in the 49th year of his age. He was appointed by the Conference of
1856 to the Vavau Circuit. From this sphere he was compelled to retire, and
after labouring in different Circuits in New South Wales for between nine and
ten years, he became a Supernumerary, and shortly after was rendered incapable
of taking part in the work he loved. The Rev. Stephen Rabone literally died
at his post; for suddenly, while walking to preach at Wesley Church, Sydney,
on Sunday Evening, July 21st, 1872, he expired in the street. In 1834, Mr.
Rabone was appointed by the Missionary Society to labour in the Friendly


Islands, and after much delay caused by shipwreck, he entered upon his work,
remaining until the year 1850. During this time he rendered service of great
value in the translation of the Scriptures and other books. Returning to New
South Wales he laboured for upwards of 20 years, and no voice was more
familiar than his throughout the Colony. His power in prayer was often
remarkable. He was an able and willing worker, and a model of accuracy,
courtesy, and despatch. He became President of the Conference in iB6O,
and was General Secretary for Missions for nearly nine years. His services as
Missionary Secretary were invaluable.
The Rev. Peter Turner died on the 2nd November, 1873, in great peace,
in the 72nd year of his age. He left England in 1830 for the Friendly Islands,
where he served his Master for a long term of unbroken toil. He was the
first Wesleyan Missionary to Samoa, and was greatly honoured of God in those
Islands. From Samoa he returned to the Tongan Group, where he continued
to labour until broken down by over work. On coming to New South Wales
he laboured for twenty years, working when he could and always suffering,
but suffering patiently. He led a holy life from youth up, and was an
exemplification of the doctrine of Christian Perfection. He left all he had
to the Preachers’ Annuitant Fund.
Among the laymen whose names figure on the death roll was Mr. Thomas
Iredale, of Surry Hills, who died on the 14th September, iB6O. As a Class
Deader and Focal Preacher he laboured with much success for many years.
Mr. John Crofton, prominently connected with Hunter River Methodism in its
infancy, died during the year 1867. He was buried in the West Maitland
Cemetery by the Rev. Benjamin Chapman. The next year Mr. Samuel Paul
of Bathurst passed away after much suffering, reference being made to his
death by the Rev. Joseph Oram in the William Street Church. Mr. Weiss,
or as he was latterly called, “Father Weiss,” died on the 19th April, 1872.
On his return from the Friendly Islands he entered into business, still continuing
a willing workman in the service of God. In all the relations of life he had
endeavoured to act with a perfect heart. Mr. William Sweetnam died in the
year 1873, after continued and acceptable service as a Focal Preacher and
worker for about 30 years. Often at personal inconvenience he would ride
many miles to preach. He was identified with the establishment of Methodism
in Bathurst and the adjacent localities.
We may fittingly close this chapter with a description of the last Australian
Conference from the pen of the Rev. J. E. Carruthers, which appeared in The
Methodist (November 2nd, 1901.) “ The Conference was held in old York
Street Church. It was attended by about 100 ministers, nearly half of whom
had gathered from New South Wales. The rest had come from Victoria,
Tasmania, South Australia, and New Zealand, with representatives from Fiji,
Tonga and Samoa. The Rev. Thomas Williams of Victoria, was the President,


the Rev. John Cope the Secretary, and the Rev. Benjamin Chapman the ex-
President. The platform presented an array of men who had graced the chair
in preceding years. John Eggleston was there, with his closely knit brow and
his penetrating eyes, indicative of the clear strong brain that lurked behind ;
ihomas Buddie and James Buller, fathers and founders of Methodism in New
Zealand, which began even then to claim to be the 1 Great Britain of the South ’;
John Watsford, ruddy of countenance, ready in debate, and full of unction when-
ever he spoke on subjects bearing on the spiritual interests of the Church ;
George Hurst, well informed and emphatic, regarded as an authority on con-
stitutional questions, and conservative of what he held to be the vital principles
of Methodism ; William A. Quick, quiet, dignified, learned, always listened to
with great respect; James Bickford, a master in pastoral theology and in
pastoral visitation ; and others who have now gone over to the great majority.
The leaders on the floor of the Conference were such men as Samuel Wilkinson,
Joseph H. Fletcher, Joseph Oram, J. B. Waterhouse, William Kelynack, George
Woolnough, George Daniel, Joseph Dare, and W. J. K. Piddington. Young
men in those days had not much to say ; but Shirley W. Baker, of Tonga, could
not be suppressed.
“ The President’s official sermon, and the charge of the Rev. W. B. Boyce
at the Ordination Service, were deliverances not soon to be forgotten. The
President was a man of literary tastes and pretensions. As he rightly regarded
the last of the Australasian Conferences as an historic occasion, he had especially
prepared for the official service. Plis text was; ‘ What hath God wrought ?’
He surveyed the past of Australasian Methodism, descanted upon its present
position, and looked out upon the future with the eye of a prophet and a seer.
The Ordination Service also had its remarkable features. It was held in
Wesley Church. Candidates for ordination were seven in number. They
represented men of various years, as ordinations were not held annually in the
several Colonies at that time. Here is the list: John S. Austin, Robert Johnston,
John A. Waddell, James E. Carruthers, James G. Middleton, Robert Allen, and
Frederick W. Ward. The service was conducted by the President, and the
charge should have been delivered by the ex-President, the Rev. B. Chapman.
But the Rev. W. B. Boyce was on a visit to Sydney and the ex-President secured
him as a substitute. At that Conference, a splendid Missionary
Meeting was held, and the Rev. Joseph Dare —the Chrysostom of
Victoria —delivered an address which thrilled the audience by its
magnetic fervour and sacred eloquence. The Missionary business was
not transacted in the Conference proper, but a meeting of the General
Missionary Committee was held during the Conference. The Minutes
show that the only laymen now with us who were present then are the Hon.
E. Vickery, Mr. T. P. Reeve, and Mr. E. Bayliss. Mr. W. Robson was also
present, but it was as the Rev. W. Robson. There were some good debates in
the Conference.


''' •
“Gbc IHIlorlD is m\} iparisb.”
“ The Conference had its recreations. There was an At Home at 7 oxteth
tendered by Sir Wigram and Lady Allen, a harbour excursion on the Saturday
afternoon, and an all-day railway trip to the Lithgow Valley Zig-Zag, specially
to give intercolonial visitors an opportunity of seeing the wonders of the Blue
Mountain railway line. The close of the Conference meant the close of the old
order. The Colonies were to go their own way with their own Annual Confer-
ences, and the General Conference was thereafter to be composed of a limited
number of elected representatives. Hence it was with more than ordinary sig-
nificance and feeling that the verses of the closing hymn were sung: —
£ Through Thee we now together came,
In singleness of heart,
We met, 0 Jesus, in Thy Name,
And in Thy Name we part.
‘ Subsist as in us all one soul,
No power can make us twain ;
And mountains rise and oceans roll,
To sever us in vain. 5 55
To this description let a last word from The Advocate be added: “As
Ministers and people we have separated with an increased desire, we believe,
to be faithful to God, to hand down undiminished our Methodist traditions, and
to transmit untarnished our Methodist honour. And where there is spiritual
earnestness along with fidelity to God’s truth there will be progress. ‘ Seeking
first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, all other things will be added.’
And we had better wait half a century before we report progress which might
be gained by muddling our theology until nobody knows what it means, or
sponging out our lines of discipline until nobody knows who is in the Church
and who is outside.”

CHAPTER XVI.
HOME MISSIONS.
WHAT the backbone is to the human body the Church Sustentation
and Extension Society is to the Church. A branch of the work so
important deserves a chapter to itself, in which prominence may
be given to its origin and development and the noble work it has
done for Methodism.
To trace the genesis of this Society we must go back to the District Meet-
ing of 1845, when the few Missionaries who then guided the affairs of the Mis-
sion were considering a communication from the General Committee recommend-
ing the establishment of a Contingent Fund and Chapel Fund as valuable and
imperative auxiliaries in Church work. The outcome of these deliberations
was the passing of the following resolution:—“ The advice and suggestion of
the Committee relative to the formation of a Contingent Fund for the purpose
of assisting the new and poorer stations in this District were most respectfully
and cordially received by the Brethren, and it was unanimously resolved that
on their return to their several Circuits, the necessary steps shall be taken to
carry them out.” This was at once done; but it was not till the District
Meeting of 1846 that the Australian Chapel Fund and the Contingent Fund
were officially inaugurated. For then it was determined that a Fund to assist
the building of Chapels be commenced, that “ our more wealthy friends be
solicited to support this Fund by annual subscriptions,” and that collections in
its interests be made in all the preaching places in the month of November ;
the distribution of these Funds to be managed by a representative Committee
which should meet the day preceding the District Meeting, or at such other
times as the General Superintendent deemed necessary.
Thus this financial barque was launched, but the gentle winds which it was
hoped the people’s generosity would set in motion never filled its sails, and it
would have remained motionless had it not been for grants received from the
Government for several years. In connection with the Contingent Fund mat-
ters were more hopeful, though the popularity of that Fund was by no means
equal to its usefulness. In introducing this Society to the public the District
Meeting resolved: “ 1. That we rejoice in the liberal support which this Fund
has received from our members generally, an additional proof, if any were
necessary, of the anxiety of our people to spread the knowledge of vital Chris-
tianity in the Colony. 2. That the following gentlemen be requested to act as
a Committee, to meet in Sydney the day before the District Meeting in July,
1847, f° r the purpose of auditing accounts, considering the claims of Circuits


for grants towards deficiencies, and reporting upon the same to the District
Meeting:—All the Preachers of the District in full Connexion, the Treasurers
of the various Funds, the Circuit Stewards of Sydney and Parramatta, and
Messrs. McArthur, Blanchard, Caldwell, Green, Piper, Vickery, and BBebble-
white, Sydney; Cavanough, Ducker, and Everingham, Windsor ; Lane, Fulton,
and Tom, Bathurst; Ledsam and McClelland, Blunter River; Kendall and
Vidler, Camden; and Cummings, Wollongong. 3. That the March subscrip-
tions in the Classes and the proceeds of the July collections be immediately
remitted to the Treasurers, Mr. McArthur and Mr. Boyce.”
This Fund existed for a few years, during which time it rendered service
to the weaker Circuits, though its voluntary income rarely, if ever, exceeded
£l5O per annum. The approach of the first Conference in 1855 necessitated a
rearrangement of the Connexional Funds, so that at the District Meeting of
1854 the “Church Extension Fund for New South Wales’ was introduced.
“ In order,” said the Missionaries then in session, “ to provide for the extension
of the work of God in this Colony, and to meet the numerous calls for Minis-
terial help which are made in almost every direction, this meeting is of the
opinion that it is most desirable that the Contingent Fund should be placed
upon a more extended basis. We therefore recommend: 1 1. That the name of
this Fund be the Wesleyan Church Extension Fund for New South Wales. 2.
That in future the contributions in the Classes at the March visitation be dis-
continued. 3. That in lieu of the collection in the Classes a public meeting be
held in all our principal places in connection with the annual collection made
in the month of July, when the claims of the Colony shall be advocated, and
that subscriptions be solicited from our principal friends. 4. That a report of
the Fund be printed and circulated together with a list of the collections and
subscriptions.’ ”
Though the Conference apparently approved of this change the new
Society does not appear to have been introduced to the public until the year
1859, when it was proposed that the Chapel, Contingent, and Extension Funds
be amalgamated and henceforth known as the Church Sustentation and Exten-
sion Society. “The Extension Fund was all but a wreck,” said Mr. J. Walker
at the inaugural Public Meeting, “ and it was not generally satisfactory.” The
Rev. William BBessel had so continuously thought upon the matter that he
resolved to advocate the establishment of a new Society. At the District
Meeting of 1859, after the business of the Church Contingent Fund and Exten-
sion Fund had been disposed of, Mr. BBessel submitted the following resolutions,
which, being seconded by the Rev. B. Chapman, were briefly discussed and
unanimously adopted;—
“ 1. That in the opinion of this District Committee the present system of
separate B'unds for specific purposes in this District is unsatisfactory: First,
because it is not adapted to secure that deep interest and intelligent confidence
of the Methodist public which are necessary to success; second, because it does
not, and cannot, supply us with adequate means of aggressive action, in the
many promising fields of labour which are open to us ; and, third, because it

necessarily devolves the financial business (especially in raising the Funds) in
an undue degree upon the Ministry. This Committee, therefore, thinks it
expedient that some alteration should be made, and that the evils of the pre-
sent plan would be remedied, and a powerful engine of Evangelical aggression
secuied by the formation of a 1 Wesleyan Church Sustentation and Extension
Society ’ for this District substantially after the model of the Wesleyan Mis-
sionary Society, which shall embrace all the objects of the present Church
Extension and ( hapel Funds, and any other congruous objects that may arise ;
and. therefore, the Committee respectfully and earnestly solicits the permission
of the Conference to establish such a Society for the New South Wales Dis-
trict. 2. That the Ministers and Circuit Stewards in the Sydney, Newtown, and
Parramatta Circuits be appointed a sub-committee to prepare a draft constitu-
tion for the proposed Society, to be laid before an adjourned Meeting- of the
Financial District Committee, to be called by the Chairman about the time of
next Conference.”
The Committee was composed of the following gentlemen :—Messrs.
McArthur and Dr. Moffitt, Sydney North ; Moore and Wearne, Sydney South ;
Moulding and Lane, Sydney East; Walker and Henson, Newtown; and Neale


and Golledge, Parramatta, being the Circuit Stewards of their respective Cir-
cuits. I'he Ministers also of these Circuits were members of the sub-Commit-
tee, which was authorised to draw up a plan, of which the fifth Conference
approved, and to raise funds.
The meeting was held in the Book Depot, 17th January, 1859, the following
being in attendance:—Revs. S. Rabone (in the chair), Ironside, Quick, Hessel,
Oram, Millard, and Messrs. McArthur, Golledge, Walker, Houlding, and Dr,
Moffitt. This draft Constitution was agreed to; —
“1. This Institution shall be called the New South Wales Wesleyan
Methodist Church Sustentation and Extension Society. 2. The object of this
Society is to stimulate and combine on a larger and more systematic scale, the
efforts of the Wesleyan Methodist Church in New South Wales, to establish
and extend the ordinances of God for the spread of ' Scriptural holiness through
the land.’ 3. Every benefactor presenting a donation of £lO and upwards shall
be a Life Member of this Society, and every person subscribing ten shillings
and upwards, annually, and every Collector of ten shillings and upwards quar-
terly shall be members of this Society. Such Life Members as Mem-
bers, shall be entitled to a copy of the General Annual Report. 4. Every
Association that shall be formed in the several Circuits of New South Wales
for the support of this Society shall be called a Branch Society for the Circuit
in which it shall be established. 5. All the moneys raised for the objects of
this Society shall be regularly paid to the Branch Treasurer and by him to
the General Treasurers once every quarter or oftener, deducting only the neces-
sary incidental expenses. 6. The financial year of the Society shall end on the
30th September. 7. The Secretaries of the various Circuit Branch Societies
shall prepare and forward to the General Secretary or Secretaries of this Society,
not later than the 21st October, a list of all the donations, subscriptions, and
Collections contributed in their respective Circuits during the year, stating
what amount has been detained for necessary local expenses. 8. An Annual
Public Meeting of the Members of this Society, with such other religious ser-
vices as may be agreed upon, shall be held in Sydney, in connection with the
Annual District Meeting in the month of November, when a Report of the
Society’s operations, and the Treasurer’s accounts shall be submitted. 9. The
General Management of this Society shall be under the direction of the Finan-
cial District Committee, who shall appoint an Executive Committee for the
transaction of the business of the Society during the interval of its Annual
sittings, whose proceedings it shall review and direct. 10. The Executive Com-
mittee, who shall meet in Sydney once a month or oftener, shall be composed of
six, eight or ten, senior Ministers, not being Supernumeraries, resident in or
near Sydney, and an equal number of laymen, being members of the Wesleyan
Methodist Society, who shall be elected by ballot of the General Committee.
Two of the lay members shall retire annually by rotation, but be eligible for
re-election. This rotation during the first two or three years shall be effected
by ballot of the Executive Committee, after which it shall proceed in regular
course. All the Members of the General Committee shall be entitled to meet and
vote with the Executive Committee, n. Two General Treasurers, and one or


more General Secretaries shall be elected annually by the Financial District Com-
mittee, and shall be ex officio members of the Executive Committee. 12. The
funds of this Society shall be appropriated to the following objects—
1. To defray the current working' expenses of the Society, and the ordin-
ary necessary Connexional expenses which equitably belong to the Wesleyan
Methodist Church of New South Wales. 2. To assist in sustaining Ministers in
neglected or scattered populations, where the full support of a Minister cannot
be obtained. Provided that all the agents employed be approved by the Austra-
lasian W esleyan Methodist Conference and quarterly information with a
balance-sheet of their Circuit income and expenditure annually be furnished to
the Executive Committee. 3. d o grants in aid of the erection of New Chapels,
Ministers residences, and School Rooms, and towards the liquidation of debt
on such Methodist property as may have been already acquired. Provided
that in every case the property is settled (or in case of a grant from Govern-
ment in sure process of settlement) on the Model Deed. And provided, further,
with regard to all new erections that the proposal to build the plans and specifi-
cations shall have been approved by the Executive or General Committee.
T 3- The Executive Committee shall adopt such measures as they may deem
necessary and proper to raise moneys for the purposes of the Society, and they
shall have discretionary power to grant money for the recognised objects of
the Society in special cases. But their administrative functions shall be con-
fined chiefly to the consideration of applications for assistance, the recommenda-
tion of amounts to be granted by the General Committee at its annual sitting,,
and the enforcement of the conditions on which the grants may have been
made. They shall also seek information respecting Districts in which there are
no Wesleyan Ministrations, and shall recommend to the District Meeting the
appointment desirable and prudent. 14. No property shall be accepted, pur-
chased, or built for the purposes of the Wesleyan Methodist Church in New
South Wales, whether pecuniary assistance be asked or not, without the formal
consent of the Executive or General Committee, who shall have power to
require such information, as they may deem necessary for the purpose of form-
ing a judgment upon the case.”
In introducing the Society to the public The Christian Advocate (Feb.
17th, 1859), said:—“ The Society is, strictly speaking, only a new mode of
carrying out the recognised objects of Methodism, which have hitherto been
promoted by somewhat different means. . . . This arrangement will relieve
our congregations of one Sabbath collection during the year, and at the same
time, we hope it will promote more generally systematic and liberal contribu-
tions by the people for the Sustentation and Extension of Methodism in this
country. We raise upwards of A3,000 per annum in this Colony for Foreign
Missions, and scarcely more than A6OO for the objects contemplated by this
Society. One consequence of this is, that our Foreign Missions are far out-
growing our Home Churches. This is likely to lead to serious financial embar-
rassment. . . . We commend the interests of this Society to our friends,
not as the rival of the Foreign Missionary Society, but as a means of enlarging
its sphere, and increasing its resources, by multiplying Wesleyan Societies,

congregations, and Sanctuaries in every part of the land. . . . The success
of the Society depends mainly upon the interest and sympathy of the great body
of the Methodist people, and we are anxious that they should fully understand
it, and earnestly espouse its cause. ... It will be really a people’s society,
and we believe that they will learn to love it as a means of improvement to
themselves, and of doing good to others.” These high hopes were not always
realised. For though many have done nobly, “interest” and “sympathy” have
not been always forthcoming, and for some unaccountable reason the Society
has failed to become a “ people’s ” Society. Its support has fallen upon the
generous few.
The machinery of the Society being ready, and the sanction of the Con-
ference having been obtained, nothing now remained but to bring the new
Society to a successful inauguration. This was done at a “ General Meeting of
Wesleyan Methodist Church Officers,” convened by circular, in the School
Rooms at York Street on Monday, March 21st, when about 100 “Church


Officers ” sat down to tea at half-past six o’clock. After tea the Rev. William
Hessel stated the object of the Meeting, and called upon Mr. McArthur to
preside. Ihe Rev. R. Mansfield, who was the first speaker, submitted the first
resolution:—“ That this meeting is convinced of the great importance and
necessity of combined and systematic efforts on the part of the Wesleyan
Methodist Church, for the sustentation and extension of its means of grace and
•salvation in this Colony.” In the course of an able speech, Mr. Mansfield
referred to the State Aid formerly received by the Church. The two “ crutches ”
upon which they had been leaning were the Civil List, reserved by the Imperial
Act of Parliament, out of which their Church had received its quota, and the
supplementary vote which had been granted for several years past by the
Colonial Parliament. The first of these crutches had been taken from them,
and as a result, some of the denominations were floundering in the mud. Mr.
J. Caldwell, who seconded this resolution, said that he was not disposed to find
fault with crutches, for they had served important purposes, and were sometimes
desirable. He hoped that a great scheme would be set on foot that night
which would tend to send the Gospel through the length and breadth of the
land, so that Methodism would be second to none. During the last ten years
they had not maintained the stand they ought to have taken, but the time was
now come for them to stir themselves. Mr. J. R. Moulding, who supported the
resolution, expressed his pleasure that one crutch had been knocked away, as
they were not such cripples as to want crutches.
The Rev. W. Hessel moved the next resolution: —“ That this meeting
believes the new Society, whose foundation was sanctioned by the last Con-
ference at the request of the Financial District Committee, is well adapted to
accomplish the desirable objects proposed, and therefore earnestly commends
it to the sympathy and support of the whole Methodist body in New South
Wales.” Mr. Hessel said that they were initiating a movement, which, by con-
solidating and extending the influence of the Wesleyan Methodist Church,
would exert an influence upon generation after generation till the end of time.
The Society was intended to furnish a stimulus to local effort, by rendering
conditional assistance. He had no faith in any plans or organisations by which
religious ordinances were provided for the people without co-operation. An
institution which gave religious ordinances to the people without calling on them
to do something for themselves would do more harm than good. One of the
leading principles of the Association was to stimulate the exertions of the
people by calling on them to do as much as they could for themselves, and then
rendering them the amount of aid really necessary. I nless people gave to the
House of God, they were not likely to receive benefit from the ministrations of
the House of God. One object of the Society would be to promote the erection
of commodious and eligible Chapels in populous Districts. Another principle
involved in this Society was the adjustment of living agencies and material
appliances for promoting the extension of the Work of God. He behe\ed this
Society would be the means of awakening the people’s zeal for the salvation of
their neighbours and fellow Colonists, and would thus give a great impetus to
the work of evangelisation. He had great faith in Methodism. He believed

that Wesleyan Methodism was the greatest foe that Satan had in this world,
and that he had held many councils to devise means to weaken its power and
injure its usefulness. He thought it was their duty to uphold Methodism in its
integrity, and with renewed vigor to push on its glorious conquests. This
resolution was seconded by Mr. John Walker and supported by Mr. Lawson.
Mr. John Dawson, the next speaker, after a few introductory remarks,
moved:—“ That this meeting respectfully recommends the friends of Methodism
in this Colony to hold a public tea meeting or other public meeting in each Cir-
cuit as soon as practicable, for the purpose of forming a branch Society for the
Circuit, appointing a committee and officers for its management, and soliciting
donations and subscriptions in support of the parent Society.” This resolution
was seconded by the Rev. George Hurst in a forcible and telling speech. He
was quite sure, he said, that if they were but faithful to God and to themselves,
Methodism would spread Scriptural holiness throughout these beautiful coun-
tries. The resolution was also supported by Mr. James Barker. The Rev.
John Eggleston hoped that the proceedings of that meeting would have an
important result on the future. He had no faith in such a Society being
launched feebly. If those present had taken the trouble to calculate what was
embraced in the object of the Society, they would feel that no ordinary
pecuniary effort should be made in launching it. It would embrace the whole
of their home work ; it would be, in fact, a Home Mission ; it would comprehend


within its objects the sustenance of the Ministry and their Chapel extension ;
and if their friends would just consider what had been expended every year for
the last few years, they must see that more than ordinary contributions ought to
be made to the Society. It was a saving to their funds to build large Chapels
where the District was populous. He would like to see every year £5,000 spent
in the erection of a Chapel, the Society giving ,£I,OOO. The sending forth of
Ministers was another very important object of the Society. At present they
were spreading themselves over an immense surface of little places, and in this
way frittering away their Ministerial energies, and were accomplishing little for
the Colony. He approved of the union of the two objects in one Society, as it
would supply a focus and centre of action and influence. He would move that
a subscription list be opened. On Mr. Love seconding this proposal the mat-
ter was enthusiastically taken up by the audience, the sum of £ll2 10s. 6d.
being promised as donations, and £142 14s. 6d. as annual subscriptions. Mr. A.
McArthur, Mr. E. Vickery, Mr. James Barker, gave £25 each, and promised
£lO as annual subscriptions, while several other names well-known in Methodist
circles appear among the subscribers.
After this successful launching of the scheme it became necessary to hold
public meetings in every available place to introduce the Society and to enlist
the sympathies of the public. To Newtown Circuit belongs the honour of the
first public meeting and special sermons, the preachers being Rev. S. Rabone
and Mr. B. S. Walker. At the public meeting the sum of £35 was raised,
and it was stated that two other branches were to be formed “ in the country
parts of the Circuit.” Sydney North came next with its gatherings in the
‘Centenary Chapel,” York Street. Mr. John Hosking, son of the schoolmaster,
who, in conjunction with Mr. Bowden, wrote the appeal to the Missionary Com-
mittee for the appointment of a Missionary, took the chair. A local committee
was formed, a collection amounting to £2l was realised, and a list of donations
and subscriptions amounting to £216 was read. This local Committee, which
met soon afterwards, divided the Circuit into eight Districts,- —four in the city,
two at Balmain, one at Pyrmont, and one at Lane Cove—and selected a number
of ladies who should be requested to undertake “ the arduous and honourable
duties of collectors.” These ladies were invited to a friendly tea at the Superin-
tendent Minister’s house a few days afterwards. The Circuit officers met the
ladies, and the evening was spent in pleasant Christian intercourse, in which
there was much counsel and encouragement relative to the new Society. It
was fully expected that though late in the year not less than £4OO would be
realised in that Circuit alone. The report of that meeting concludes in this
hopeful strain: “ This will be a good example for all the other Circuits of the
Colony, which it is hoped they will not be slow to follow. The Society has
already taken hold of the religious affections of many of our good people, and
this augurs well for its success. O, that it may become a great power to scatter
gospel blessings through the land.”
Sydney East Circuit followed, yielding £22 from sermons and public meet-
ing, and £7O from subscriptions. Camden came next, when the collection
realised £23, and seventeen persons gave in their names as annual subscribers..

THE REV. JAMES WOOLNOUGH.
President , i££7.
The report of that meeting states: “ The people of Camden Circuit have unmis-
takably evinced their approval of the new Society.” The Goulburn Circuit
■caught the spirit of the promoters and held a tea and public meeting, at which
Revs. J. Watsford, W. Kelynack, J. W. Dowson, and Messrs. W. Davies, E.
Butler, R. Sindel, and R. H. Blatchford took part. Of the public meeting The
Goulburn Chronicle naively said: “There were present about one hundred
persons, the major proportion females.” Windsor reported that the attendance
on both occasions was remarkably good, a fact which evinced the lively interest
taken in this Society by the friends in this Circuit.” The best proof of this is
to be found in the fact that forty persons became subscribers and the collections
amounted to £\2 igs. 3d. At Newcastle, the Rev. J. G. Turner reported a suc-
cessful meeting with collections totalling £ 15- A beginning was also made at
Maitland, where regret was expressed that owing to “ the pressure of local
claims ” they could do no more than make a beginning. But it was a good
beginning, for one hundred subscribers to the Society were obtained and A6o
raised in collections. At Singleton the weather was “ unpropitious.” Mudgee
had “ respectable and well-attended congregations ” The majority “ were well
satisfied with the general procedure and the results,” which amounted to A 45
is. In due course branches were formed in other Circuits, and the Society took
root throughout the Colony.
At the first monthly meeting of the Executive the work of the Provisional
r O
Committee was confirmed, and the proceedings of the General Committee were
entered in the minute book. The General Secretaries were requested to get


the report through the press as soon as possible, and the hope was cherished that
the Society “ would become mighty for good by the number and devotion of its
adherents.’ The Christian Advocate was persistent in its appeals for the new
Society. “d he Society must be made to live in the thoughts and prayers of
the mass of the people if it is to become, as we believe it will, a mighty instru-
ment for good.” And again: “It is our earnest hope that the new Society will
directly contribute most extensively to the advancement of Methodism in this
Colony, and indirectly to the enlargement of the sphere of our Mission opera-
tions. . . . When we consider the objects of the Society, we cannot for a
moment believe that any genuine Methodist will either stand aloof from it or
give it a lukewarm support. . . . Nobler objects it would be difficult to
conceive, or which would exert a more powerful and beneficial influence on the
whole land. We trust that in the days to come, many a native Australian, con-
templating the Churches erected by the aid of this Society, will sing—
“ ‘ These temples of His grace,
How beautiful they stand!
The honours of our native place,
And bulwarks of our land.’ ”
It would be interesting, indeed, to follow the Society along the various chan-
nels through which its helpful streams have flowed. It would be inspiring to
describe the efforts of the men who have toiled in its interests, and to enlarge
upon the patience and persistency of the lady collectors, many of whom are
worthy of all praise. But space forbids. We can describe only its most impor-
tant developments, leaving it for others to pursue their studies m the bypaths
of the work of this beneficent Society. For many years, it pursued the chequered
tenor of its way, assisting various building schemes, sustaining weak and
struggling Circuits, putting down its agents in new and difficult spheres of
labour, assisting in their support until the Circuits reached independence, thus
helping to fulfil the object of its founders: To spread Scriptural holiness
throughout the land.
The position of Secretary has been held by several of the leading Ministers,
who, each in turn, did splendid work in organising and advocating the claims
of the Society. The Rev. George Hurst was the first permanent Secretary,
holding the position for sixteen years, during which time he not only pressed
home its claims, but gave his services gratuitously. In 1883 he was succeeded
by the Rev. George Lane, whose love for the work of the Society was deep,
and his efforts on its behalf untiring. Mr. Lane retained the position till
18S9, when he gave place to Rev. Richard Sellers, D.D., who held office until
1895. The Rev. James Woolnough then took charge, and at the expiration
of his term in 1902 he was re-appointed for six years.
The developments in connection with the Society have been remarkably
encouraging. The first substantial addition to its funds was made in con-
nection with the Jubilee of Missions in the year 1864. British Methodism
having set the example, Australian Methodists resolved not to be backward,
and in a generous and comprehensive scheme the Conference laid the matter
before the public. Chief among the objects which it was sought to aid by


the funds raised was the establishment of a Loan Fund. The Conference
wisely resolved that all subscriptions to the Jubilee Fund, given with special
reference to the Loan Fund, should be for the use and benefit of the Colony
in which they were respectively given. This enabled the New South Wales
District to aim at raising £ 10,000, to be used exclusively for the Sustentation
Society. This amount was not realised, though many responded liberally.
A sufficient sum, however, was raised to be of lasting benefit to the Society in
its efforts to strengthen and develop the work of God.
Incalculable and lasting assistance next came through the generosity of
the Rev. William Schofield, who, at his death, left the sum of Aqo.ooo odd,
with which to found the William Schofield Loan Fund; at the same time
intimating that at the death of Mrs. Schofield the balance of the estate would
be devoted to the same object. Mr. Schofield arrived in New South Wales
in the year 1827, proceeding a few days later to Hobart Town, where on
the 30th March, 1828, he preached his first sermon to 300 persons at Macquarie
Harbour. He continued to labour here as Government Chaplain until the
year 1832, when he was appointed to the Parramatta Circuit, afterwards
travelling in Windsor, Portland Head, Sydney, Melbourne, Parramatta a second
time, and Windsor again in 1847. Thence he removed to Goulburn in the
year 1850, and in the following year became a Supernumerary, having been
twenty-four years in active work. He died at the age of eighty-five, his last
words being an assurance that he was trusting in Christ. During prayer
by the Rev. F. Firth he responded fervently. He was buried at Waverley.
Having provided for his near relatives, his executors were directed, at Mrs.
Schofield’s death, to sell the estate, and to secure the proceeds to the Wesleyan
Church Sustentation and Extension Society for ever, as a Loan Fund for the
Colony of New South Wales, to be kept distinct from, but worked in the same
way as the existing Loan Fund.
Mrs. Schofield died in November, 1893, when Mr. Schofield’s wishes were
carried into effect by the Executors, the Revs. George Lane, James Woolnough,
and Mr. John Corbett. In 1878, Mrs. Schofield became possessed of
considerable wealth, which she regarded as a talent entrusted to her by God.
Tier gifts towards the erection of Churches, Colleges, Schools, Parsonages and
Christian Missions cannot be estimated. To the New* Guinea Mission she
was specially liberal, leaving the principal part of her private means chiefly for
its maintenance. Her gifts to the poor were quiet and unostentatious, while
her interest in the extension of the work of God was practical and abiding.
She took deep interest in the erection of the new Church at Waverley, towards
which she contributed T6,000, also giving the organ at an additional cost of
Tpooo. She laid the foundation stones of upwards of thirty Churches, and
gave donations to almost all the Wesleyan Churches erected in New South
Wales for the fifteen years immediately preceding her death. Notwithstanding
her great income she lived plainly that she might have the more to give to the
work of God. Of her it may be truly said; “ She hath done what she could.”


Another name to be remembered with gratitude because of his fine
generosity is that of Mr. John Bright, of Wollongong; who, in the year
1884, bequeathed a legacy of £40,000 to the Sustentation Society, together
with £3,000 towards the support of a second Minister in the Wollongong
Circuit. Mr. Bright was in business in Wollongong for many years. The
Society has also received several smaller sums from its thoughtful friends.
At the first New South Wales and Queensland Conference, the Committee
submitted a series of resolutions then said to be of the greatest importance to
the work of the Society, in which it was resolved that the Funds henceforth
should be appropriated to the following objects only, the grants hitherto having
been almost without restriction. First: to defray the working expenses of
the Society and the necessary Connexional expenses. Second; to assist in
sustaining Ministers in neglected or scattered populations where the full support
of a Minister could not be obtained, and in supporting Home Mission
Ministers appointed by the Conference. Third: to grants in aid of the erection
of New Churches, Parsonages and School-rooms. This proposed division of
funds was adhered to for some years, when the increased demands made it
imperative to discontinue all grants towards the erection of Churches, Parson-
ages and School-rooms.
The Society now proposed to establish another agency to prosecute the
work in outlying places, where the support of a Minister was not possible.
At a special meeting of the Executive Committee, held on the 16th of April,
1889, the scheme for the establishment of Home Mission Stations was sub-
mitted in accordance with the resolutions of the preceding Conference. Its
originators stated that every good purpose would be served for the present,
by drawing up a simple plan on the lines of the resolutions of the last Con-
ference, with a few well defined principles clearly laid down; and, as the work
advanced legislation could be framed to conserve and further its growth. After
full discussion, the Committee forwarded a plan to the District Meetings for
their consideration with a view to submission to the Conference for its approval.
The proposed plan embodied the following features. That the Executive
Committee should have authority to establish Home Mission Stations in
localities where it was impracticable or inadvisable to establish Circuits; that
it should have power to select Agents and appoint them to these stations;
that the Home Missionary should be under the direction of the Executive
Committee; that there should be an exchange between the Home Mission
Agent and the Minister of some neighbouring Circuit for the purpose of
the administration of the Lord’s Supper ; that the Executive Committee should
report to the Conference respecting the condition and prospects of the Flome
Mission Stations, particularly as to any, which, in the judgment of the
Committee should be formed into a Circuit; and that the Committee should
have authority to arrange for the employment of Bible Women in suitable
localities. Regulations were also adopted concerning unmarried Home
Missionaries desiring to offer themselves as candidates for the Ministry.


.
MR. JOHN BRIGHT, OF WOLLONGONG.
In submitting his report to the following Conference, Dr. Sellers, who was
then Secretary, said that two Home Mission Stations had been established
during the year, one in the Tweed River District and the other at Narrandera.
Applications for Home Missionaries having been made from several parts of
the Colony, the Committee hoped shortly to increase the number of agents.
Speaking of his work at the Tweed River, Mr. Thompson said that from August,
1889, to the end of the year, he had conducted sixty-two ordinary and fourteen
evangelistic services, travelled upwards of 1,300 miles, and made three hundred
visits to the houses of the people. Mr. Boyd, of Narrandera, reported that
in addition to preaching almost every Sunday morning and evening in the
town, and at places some twelve miles distant in the afternoon, he had held
services at places a considerable distance towards Hay. So promising was
this work that the Committee contemplated taking up other Stations,
immediately after the Conference of 1890.
Referring to this forward step The Advocate (February 9th, 1889). wrote:
1 After years of patient labour and expectation, we have come to the conclusion
that in an extensive and sparsely populated country like this, our Circuit
system needs to be supplemented with and sustained by evangelistic methods,
of a more flexible and economic type, and we have determined to enter upon
what we trust and believe will make the Methodist Church more than ever


what Mr. Ex-President Lane in his retiring address said it should be: an
agency for the conversion of men. . . . We rejoice that the Conference
has decided upon carrying out such measures ; for we believe that it will effect
a great saving of money, will minimise the difficulty in stationing Ministers,
which has already become a serious matter, at the same time adding to the
efficiency of our Churches as a great evangelising agency. We hope to have
a good deal to say in future on this new scheme. To the Rev. J. E. Carruthers
belongs the honour of bringing it definitely before the Conference, and we
trust it will be their honour to work the scheme successfullv.”
The Conference of 1896 witnessed another important development, when
the Rev. James Woolnough, who had succeeded Dr. Sellors, introduced the
resolutions of a Finance Committee, which had, in obedience to Conference
resolution, sat during the year. This Committee proposed first that a Model
Balance Sheet be adopted for the use of all Circuits, and that in future all
Circuit grants be prospective, such grants absolutely discharging the Conference
and the Sustentation Society from any further liability to the Circuit or the
Minister for the Connexional year for which such grants were made. To
introduce this system, the following arrangements were proposed. That the
estimated deficiency in the funds of the Society for 1894 and the amount to
be granted for Circuit deficiencies for 1895, and for a Special Help
Fund be capitalised, leaving the income for 1895 free for prospective grants
for the following year. That this amount, namely, be capitalised
and borrowed from the Bright Bequest Fund for a term of twenty years, to
be repaid with interest added at the rate of 5 per cent, in equal instalments.
That the appropriation for prospective grants should not exceed the estimated
income of the Society for the year, and that the administration of the Special
Help Fund be left ,to the General Secretary, who should visit dependent
Circuits, assist in raising money for the payment of existing Circuit debts,
and also seek to institute better methods of local finance with a view to.
rendering the Circuits self supporting. The working out of the Fund was to
extend over a period of three years. The Committee also proposed that no
grants should be made to Circuits paying more than the minimum allowance,
and that Trust properties should not be pledged for the payment of
Circuit deficiencies. The Conference adopted these recommendations, and
thus inaugurated the Special Help Fund. In discharging the Finance
Committee it specially thanked the Rev. j. Woolnough and Mr. E. Vickery,
jun., for their very valuable services.
In placing this scheme before the public, Mr. Woolnough said that the
Fund was established for the purpose of removing the system of Circuit over-
drafts. It would be administered by the Committee in accordance with the
legislation of the Conference to which the attention of Circuit officers and
Superintendent Ministers was called. The Conference, Mr. Woolnough added,
had no authority to say that Circuit overdrafts should not be created, but it
did the next best thing by forewarning the parties concerned. In reviewing
the success of the Fund at the Conference of 1897, Mr. Woolnough stated.


that the total amount of debts recognised by the Fund was ,£9,445, of which
£3,834 was due to the banks on overdraft, and the balance to Ministers. The
payments made from the Fund amounted to £2,044 2s. 3d., while the debts
remaining were £849, together with one or two small amounts voted but not
paid. Ihe following year the Conference decided that the operation of the
Fund be extended for another year, its administration being vested in the
Executive Committee. At the close of the third year Mr. Woolnough was
able to report the liquidation of Circuit deficiencies amounting to £II,OOO.
In the latter part of the year 1896, the question of providing a Gospel
Car Mission to supply the dwellers in the back-blocks with religious services
and healthy literature v/as brought before the public by several communications
in Ihe Methodist , and by a recommendation from the Bathurst Synod. The
Home Mission Secretary, the Rev. James Woolnough, took up the idea in an
■enthusiastic manner, and submitted proposals to the Committee. Having
considered the question, the Committee decided to secure a Car to be stationed
in the Riverina District, with its head quarters at Hay. But the Executive
insisted that at least £2OO must be in hand before the work was undertaken.
To inaugurate the fund, the collection at the Annual Meeting of the
Sustentation Society was devoted to this purpose. The whole scheme,
therefore, was placed upon the people, who responded liberally. It was
proposed to build a Gospel Missionary Car, to furnish it with a stock of
Christian literature, and to place it in charge of a Minister or other suitable
agent who should travel in districts outside the boundaries of Circuits, and
who should act as a colporteur, at the same time fulfilling all the functions of
a Christian Minister wherever the opportunity arose. The response at the
Public Meeting was so encouraging that the Executive Committee decided to
proceed at once, and the Car was built by Mr. H. Proctor, of Hay, at a cost
•of £9O. The Conference appointed the Rev. James A. Walsh to take charge
of the Mission, and he soon had the Car equipped with a suitable supply of
books, a portable organ, and all other requisites. The Car Mission was publicly
inaugurated at a Meeting held in the Hay Church, when the Revs. Charles
Jones, Chairman of the District, Richard Caldwell, James Colwell, and J. A.
Walsh were in attendance. Mr. Jones preached an appropriate sermon, and
the Car, accompanied by good wishes and many prayers was sent on its
mission. In a short time' Mr. Walsh was able to report satisfactory results.
For two years he remained in charge, being succeeded by the Rev. Thomas
Jenkin, who continued the work on the same successful lines as his predecessor.
But a protracted drought held the Riverina District in its cruel grip, one of
the results being that horse feed could only be purchased at ruinous prices,
-and travelling throughout the District became a matter of very grave expense.
The Executive Committee therefore reluctantly decided to suspend operations
for a time, and the Gospel Car Mission tentatively, if not permanently, has
ceased to be. But the need for such an agency still exists.
In his first report to The Methodist Mr. Walsh said: “We left Hay on
Tuesday, September 26th, intending to make a journey lasting about three
weeks, travelling via Maude, Oxley and Booligal. Tuesday night we stayed


at Benduck Station, and on \\ ednesday reached Canoon. We were invited to
hold a service at the shearing shed, so that in the afternoon we drove four
miles, and after tea preached to about forty men. Next day, after calling at two
settlers’ places, we determined to remain at Maude all night. Having arranged
for service, we visited other houses in the town, inviting the people to service
with satisfactory results. On Friday evening we stayed at Tupra Station,
four miles from Oxley, where the Manager, though a Romanist, asked us to
visit the house. We preached to a congregation of about twenty. On
Sunday we announced two services in Oxley. The morning service was
regarded as an unjustifiable innovation, and was a failure; but the people
rallied well to the evening service. The following week, we set out to travel
over the dreary plains to Mossgiel, a town rarely visited by any Clergyman.”
The indebtedness of the Society to its Secretaries and Treasurers is very
great indeed. The position of Treasurer was filled for many years by the
Rev. J. B. Waterhouse and the Hon. Ebenezer Vickery. At the Conference
of 1890, Mr. Waterhouse retired, and Mr. Vickery also tendered his resignation.
Of Mr. Vickery’s services the Conference said: “ The Executive Committee
resolves hereby to place on record its high estimate of the valuable services
which Mr. Vickery has rendered to the Society for the past thirty years.
During this long period he has continuously held office as one of its General
Treasurers, and, moreover, as one of its founders and first officers, he has by
his initial advocacy, his munificent benefactions, and his wise counsels, especially
in the earlier years of its history, placed the Society under obligations of
gratitude, which this Committee deeply feels and warmly appreciates.” In
vacating the Treasurership, Mr. Waterhouse stated that he had been identified
in some way with the Society from its inception. During the thirty years
which had since elapsed, the Society had paid in grants to buildings alone
the sum of £36,273 18s. The Loan Fund began its operations with a capital
of £ 7OO. The capital now, that is in 1890, amounted to £10,401 9s. nd. ; and
during the period of its operations it had enabled various Trusts to liquidate
debts amounting to £35,611 ss. 4d. The names of the Revs. Dr. Kelynack
and William Clarke, together with those of Mr. B. H. Chapman and Mr. R. H.
Ducker, must not be passed over lightly; for their gratuitous services have
been great, and often heavy.
One other important accessory must not be passed without mention. The
Ministerial Choir, in charge of the Revs. W. W. Rutledge and G. O. Cocks,
gives very great help at the Annual Meeting by its excellent rendering of
suitable choruses and part songs. It is a miniature Leidertafel.

CHAPTER XVII.
THE N.SAV. AMI) QUEENSLAND
CONEEDENCE.
1574-1592.
THE second chapter in the history of Australian Methodism was now
closed. The first opened with the introduction of a few British
immigrants and their organisation into a Society by the
Rev. Samuel Leigh, in 1815. This lasted for a period
of forty years. Then came the second stage, when the Rev. W. B.
Boyce presided over the first Australian Conference, and formally
inaugurated the new dispensation. This was a very important period, in which
devoted men, whose names will not easily be obliterated, made their influence
felt on the development of the moral and religious life of the Colony. “ They
stood at the beginning of things, and in one of the most trying and critical
periods of Colonial history; when the first gold fields were discovered, and
men were carried away by the splendid visions of sudden wealth ; they bore
witness for Christ, and stood right nobly to the discharge of their duties. This
chapter extended over a period of nineteen years, and it contains unmistakable
proofs of the adaptation and potentialities of Methodism as a system of
a gg Tess i ve Christianity. But this last page is written for good or evil. The
chapter is closed for ever.” —(Christian Advocate , February 2nd, 1874.) The
writing of that chapter was the end of the Australasian Annual Conference.
In its place Annual Conferences in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia
and New Zealand were to be established, with a General Conference meeting
every third or fourth year.
This new era was entered upon by thoughtful and sober men with some
degree of trepidation. But it was forced upon the Church by the conjunction
of circumstances. Missionaries had multiplied, and the operations of the
Church had extended over a vast network of Circuits which were no longer
manageable by a single Conference. And as one said: “ The voice of necessity
could be taken as the voice of God. They could not look back with vain re-
gret upon the past; they must adjust themselves to their altered circumstances.
Constitutions must be framed, and their practical difficulties would test the
administrative capacity of the most able and far sighted men. They would
have to proceed with the greatest caution, and they would continually need
the presence and guidance of the Living God. It was not intended that the
Annual Conference should be merely a magnified District Meeting, though the
power of Connexional legislation was reserved to the General Conference. The
maintenance of the General Conference would conserve unity in doctrine, it


would preserve Methodism from diverging along different lines, and it would
prevent it losing its national character by colonisation, thus giving to it the
element of homogeneity, an element necessary to preserve the Church from
disintegrating influences. The Annual Conference would possess real powers
in the appointment of Ministers and Chairmen and the election of their own
officers, thus leaving the future of Methodism practically in their own hands.”
Each Conference was to possess control of its own funds, and “there is one
thing above all that we desire in connection with our new regime. It is
that our Annual Conferences may become channels for the communication of
Divine grace to the people. Why should not our Annual Assembly be looked
for as a testimony of rich spiritual blessing, and anticipated as a feast and
festival by our city Churches ? That they may be such we are fully persuaded.
And, if they remain so, then many difficulties will vanish from our path, and
the glorious blazon which shone so triumphantly upon the standards of our
fathers will shine upon ours also.” —(Christian Advocate .)
The first New South Wales and Queensland Conference assembled in
York Street Church on Wednesday, January 28th, 1874, at ten o’clock, the
Conferences in the other Colonies assembling at the same hour. Messages of
greeting and fraternity were sent to the Conferences in Melbourne and Ade-
laide. There were fifty-five Ministers in attendance, the first Session being
commenced by the Rev. B. Chapman. Owing to the short notice given,
the attendance of the public was not large, though several Methodists from the
city and country occupied the side seats in the old Church. The Revs. W.
Schofield and J. Watkin engaged in prayer, after which the voting for President
took place, the following being the record: Gaud 1, Somerville, 1, Curnow 2,
Piddington 3, Wilkinson 7, Fletcher 27. The Rev. J. H. Fletcher, Principal of
Newington College, was therefore declared duly elected President. In his
address Mr. Fletcher said: “My position is so novel and unexpected that I feel
I may reasonably claim your indulgence. To sit in this chair and be called
Mr. President are things unfamiliar and somewhat formidable. I would
remind you that we are not the Conference we used to be. We are no longer
the ‘ Australian Conference of the Wesleyan Methodist Church,’ but the ‘ New
South Wales and Queensland Wesleyan Methodist Conference.’ The con-
stitution under which we sat last year has undergone material changes. We
have sacrificed magnitude and dignity to compactness, economy and flexibility.
The Presidents of the larger Conference have been guided by precedents, which,
in our altered circumstances, will possibly be sometimes inapplicable. We are
entering upon new ground, and we shall have to feel our way. Still, sur-
rounded as I am by brethren of great experience and matured thought, I doubt
not that I shall have their sympathy and support in the arduous duties with
which the Conference has just now entrusted me. . . . Looking forward to
the great future, when Australia shall become a nationality—and not only a
distinct nationality, but a community with a literature of its own—l trust that in
laying the foundation of that which doubtless awaits us, we shall in this be
brave enough to attempt all that God calls us to do. In the strength of that
Divine Being whom we worship, let us reverently and humbly undertake these
and all other responsibilities in such a way that we may secure His smile and
liis well-done at last.”


1 he position of Secretary fell to the lot of the Rev. J. B. Waterhouse,
while the Revs. G. Martin and F. Firth were appointed Assistant Secretaries,
and the Rev. G. Woolnough, Official Letter Writer. The Secretary then
read extracts from the Minutes of the last Australasian Conference, setting
forth the Constitution and powers of the Colonial Conference, after
which the Rev. William Schofield was called to the platform by the President.
The business transacted comprised a variety of matters. For instance: a
memorial came from the Samoa District Committee of the London Mission-
ary Society asking for a readjustment of the two Societies in that district;
the obituary notice of the Rev. Peter Turner was read; permission was given
to the Rev. W. Curnow to visit England ; the Rev. J. Waterhouse volunteered
to return to his old sphere of work in Fiji; the advisability of establishing a
Sustentation Fund for Queensland was discussed; and considerable time was
spent in the consideration of Church Sustentation affairs. The following
Preachers were admitted into full connexion ; the Revs. M. Gray, W. W. Lindsay,
W. B. Nathan, T. R. McMichael, J. W. Moore, J. F. Orr, E. J. Rodd, and
W. G. 1 aylor; the Revs. W. H. Beale, Rr. McKeown, A. Midgley, F. Moore,
J. B. Portrey, C. Saunders, J. Thomas, J. Woolnough, FI. Youngman, W. Glasson,
J. C. McDougall, B. Mack, G. R. Glasson, J. Mathison, and J. Phillips remained
on trial; and J. D. Joy and C. J. McCoy were received as preachers on trial.
Messrs. J. Gibson, J. Aldis, R. East, and G. A. Reeve were sent to the Theo-
logical Institution for training. Referring to the Conference The Advocate
said; “We have taken another step in the direction of complete self-govern-
ment ; . . . we are putting more wheels to the machine, but are the wheels
doing more work ?”
We must now glance briefly at some of the most important events which
took place during the existence of the New South Wales and Queensland
Conference. The General Conference of 1875, after protracted debate, resolved
on the admission of laymen to the Conference, each Circuit to have the right to
elect one lay representative who should be elected by ballot at the Quarterly
Meeting, the laymen eligible for election to be Church members of at least four
years’ continuous standing. The Committee of each Institution to which a
Minister was set apart was also to have the right to elect a representative. This
departure, so much feared by some, has brought in its train beneficial results, in
addition to enlarging the scope and power of the Conference.
Another matter which caused considerable agitation in the Church, and
provoked long and warm discussion was the Membership Question. For
several years the feeling had been gaining ground that the basis of member-
ship should be broadened. At the Conference of 1888 resolutions were passed
committing the question to the Quarterly Meetings for their consideration.
When the Conference of 1889 met, the District Meeting resolutions together
with the report of the Committee appointed to consider them, was read by
the Convener, the Rev. Rainsford Bavin. This report disclosed the fact that
several Circuits emphatically disapproved of the alteration suggested by the
General Conference, while other Circuits were in favour of abolishing the
Class Meeting as a test of membership. In some Quarterly Meetings the sub-

ject was discussed, but no vote was taken. In his summary, Mr. Bavin said
in thirty-three Circuits a majority of votes in twenty-one Quarterly Meetings
were against and nine in favour of the proposed change, while three remained
neutral. The Circuits favouring a change were about evenly distributed
between the city and country, and these Circuits represented less than one-fifth
of the total membership of the Circuits included in his calculation. One or
two Circuits deprecated the continual discussion of the subject as likely to
produce harmful results.
When the Sydney District Meeting met, the Rev. William Clarke moved,
and the Rev. George Lane seconded, “ that this Meeting disapproves of any
alteration in the basis of Church Membership.” As an amendment the Rev.
Baul Clipsham moved that a change of some kind was necessary, requesting
the Conference to devise some properly guarded test of membership which
should meet the case of persons in other respects eligible for membership who
did not see their way to meet in Class. Both resolution and amendment were
vigorously and earnestly discussed; and when the amendment proposed by
Mr. Clipsham was submitted, twenty-five voted for and thirty-five against it.
The original resolution was then carried by a majority of twelve votes.
This recommendation, together with those from the other District Meetings,
was submitted to the next Conference; when the Rev. J. E. Carruthers,
Secretary of the Constitution Committee, moved: “ That the Conference can-
not approve of the change suggested in the resolution sent down for considera-
tion by the General Conference.” The Rev. R Caldwell having seconded


the motion, the question was open for discussion. The Rev. Henry Young-man
moved an amendment on the same lines as that of the Rev. Paul Clipsham at
the District Meeting. The whole question was now canvassed at great length
in a debate characterised by extraordinary ability. Mr. T. Cummins then
moved that the question be now put, and the vote was taken with the following
results: For the amendment, sixty-two; against, eighty-six. The resolution
submitted by Mr. Carruthers was carried by eight-nine to sixty-one votes. In
an article dealing with the debate, The Weekly Advocate said: “Of course
the question of the basis of membership is not yet settled. The result of
the vote on Saturday last showed unmistakably that in connection with our
own Conference there is even a larger proportion than was supposed in favour
of a modification of tne present test. . . . The General Conference, however,
has now become the point of interest. All minds are reverting to it as
the Court which must face and settle this great question. ... If we may
judge from the decision of the Annual Conference an attempt is sure to be
made in the way of modifying our present test. Whether the test be success-
ful remains to be seen.”
The General Conference met in Sydney during 1890, and when the debate
on Church Membership, announced for Wednesday afternoon came on, there
was a large attendance of representatives and of the Methodist public. The
President, the Rev. Dr. Kelynack, called upon the Rev. J. Haslam to submit the
resolution of the Special Committee to the effect that the Conference re-
commended that the Class Meeting continue a test of Membership, but that
in cases of affliction, infirmity, and kindred reasons, tickets should not be
withheld from those who were unable to attend. Upon this an amendment was
moved by the Rev. J. J. Lewis, of New Zealand, proposing that Church mem-
bers should have their names enrolled in Class Books, such members being
strongly advised lo meet in Class. Able as previous debates in the General
Conference had been, this equalled, if it did not surpass them all. After
several effective speeches a Committee was appointed to take into consideration
the several resolutions of which notice had been given, and to frame therefrom
such a resolution as would embody the wishes of the Conference. That same
evening the Committee presented its report. After affirming its belief in the
value of the Class Meeting as a means of grace, it recommended that in
addition to the weekly Class a monthly Meeting for testimony and fellowships
be instituted in every Circuit, such Meeting to be led by the Minister or Leader
duly appointed, the names of all persons attending either the weekly or the
monthly meeting to be entered in Class Books provided for that purpose, and:
such persons to be regarded as members. This was considered at the time
to be a happy solution of a very grave difficulty, and the progressive spirits
were tharlkful. But their joy was somewhat premature, for it is now generally
admitted that, though the mountain laboured, it brought forth nothing more-
formidable than a mouse.
Writing of the Committee’s report, which was unanimously adopted, The
Advocate became jubilant; “It retains all that the most conservative Method-
ist has a right to ask for,” it said, “ and it makes it difficult for any Christian mam


or woman desiring membership in our Church to find a reasonable excuse for
remaining outside. We do not expect that the decision of the Conference
will -satisfy everybody, though the Conference as a corporate body regarded
the finding of the Committee with the utmost unanimity. . . . Where opinion
is so equally divided as it has been on the test of membership question, com-
promise or disintegration is inevitable. The General Conference has wisely
accepted a compromise, and we trust that its practical working will render
-any future agitation unnecessary.” Speaking of the Monthly Meeting the
same authority said that it would, it believed, increase the vitality of the weekly
Class Meeting, bringing into closer union many who had hitherto been out-
ride. This, however, has not proved to be the case. The Monthly Fellow-
ship Meeting has not achieved what was expected of it, and it has done little,
if anything, to add to the spirituality or numbers of the Church.
The Centenary of the Colony now being due, the Conference of 1887
resolved to mark the event by the establishment of a Thankgiving Fund. The
proposal was remitted to the District Meetings and to a Special Committee for
consideration and report. At the Conference of 1888, the Rev. James Wool-
nough, Secretary to the Committee, moved the Committtee’s resolution to the
■effect that a Centennial Thanksgiving Fund be established. The Rev. George
Brown and Mr. B. H. Chapman supported the proposal, and the Rev. Dr. Kely-
nack, in an eloquent speech, emphasised the object. The question which came
to them as Christians, he said, was, how much did they owe to God ? They owed
a debt to the pioneers of this great country who had conferred upon them
supreme blessings, and he wanted the question to be taken up earnestly. He
called upon the Methodists of New South Wales to raise not less than A 50,000
as their expression of thankfulness to God for the blessings of the past century,
and as a pledge of consecration for the future. The Conference then gave the
opportunity of free speech and a remarkable scene was witnessed. During the
space of one hour £7,200 were promised, chief among the subscribers being
Mr, F. Tait A 1,000, Mr. W. Arnott A 1,000, Mr. G. Crawshaw A3OO, Mr. B. H.
Chapman A 250, Rev. R. Dyson Al5O, Mr. W. H. McClelland Al5O, Rev. W.
Clarke and Mr. T. P. Reeve AlO5 each, Mr. John Wade, Mr. G. W. Barker,
Mr. Reuben Hall, Rev. Joseph Spence, Mr. Ramsay, Rev. J. A. Nolan, Rev. J.
F. Orr and Mr. W. Crispin Aioo each. Arrangements were then made for a
public meeting at which the objects of the Fund should be advocated, and the
scheme presentee to the public.
i'he Public Meeting was held in due course and the Rev. George Lane,
President, took the chair. The management of the Fund was entrusted to able
hands, the Rev. Dr. Sellers and Mr. J. H. Watkin being Secretaries and the Rev.
Dr. Kelynack and Mr. G. Crawshaw, Treasurers. The aim of the promoters,
in initiating the Fund was fourfold. They set before them the erection and
■endowment of a Theological Institution ; the extinction of Church debts ; the
acquisition of a site for a Ladies’ College, and to inaugurate and assist Mission
work in the city and country districts. In speeches of an elevating character
the Revs. J. A. Nolan, J. H. Fletcher, Dr. Sellers, S. Wilkinson, Dr. Kelynack,
-and Messrs. G. Crawshaw, J. H. Watkin, S. E. Lees, M.L.A., T. P. Fletcher


•and W. H. McClelland, advocated the objects of the Fund. The Rev. J. H.
h letcher said that during the last twenty years he felt there had been wanting
some great movement that would make them feel they were a great con-
federacy, a power that could be diffused throughout the country for its good.
He therefore trusted that the enthusiasm which had begun to display itself
would continue. “ They had never seen nor heard of a revival worthy of the
nineteenth century. Dr. Sellers said that the spirit manifested in the Con-
ference the previous hriday afternoon was something remarkable even in that
liberal age. He had never seen such an outburst of generosity. Enthusiasm
again ran high, and addrtional sums, includrng from the family of the
Rev. George Hurst, £SOO from a Friend, £2OO from Mr. J. Hardy, £l5O from
Mr. James Watkin, and £IOO each from Messrs. G. B. Allen, R. C. Allen,
Arthur Allen, and R. S. Callaghan were also promised, making a total in
connection with the Conference gatherings of i 10,697 H 5 - After extending
over a number of years the Fund was closed, the amount realised bringing a
substantial addition to the objects already enumerated.
I he question of the formation of a Sunday School Union was once more
to engage the attention of those interested in Sabbath School work ; and the
Conference of 1879 adopted a series of resolutions having for their object the
formation of a Sunday School Union. The objects of the Union were said
to be the promotion of Circuit Unions and fraternal intercourse between
schools ; the supply of good books for libraries and Sunday School requisites ;
the establishment of a Sunday School Depot; the commencement of Schools
in neglected or necessitous localities ; and competitive examinations for officers
and teachers, with the issuing of certificates of competency. The Union was
to be supported by annual subscriptions from Schools and donations from
sympathisers; and its affairs were to be managed by a Committee having
power to make by-laws for the regulation of its own business. The Rev.
Frank Firth was Secretary to the Union; and the Conference decided that a
Public Meeting should be held at an early date to inaugurate the Union, the
Sunday Schools being invited to co-operate.
A constitution was drafted, and the machinery was ready ; but little was
done until the year 1888, when the first Annual Meeting, as it was described,
was held in Wesley Church, February 23rd. The President, the Rev. George
Lane, presided, and the attendance was only moderate. Mr. Lane said they
had met to inaugurate their Union, to put a little more vigour into it, ana, if
possible, to induce other Schools to unite with them The Rev. C. W.
Graham, who had succeeded Mr. Firth as Secretary, stated that some Schools
were holding aloof from the Union. There were then twenty-three Schools
connected with it. Addresses were also delivered by the Rev. Dr. Sellers,
J. W. Winspear, and Messrs. T. Cummins and W. H. McClelland. The
following year the report was of a more encouraging nature. Referring to
the second Public Meeting, The Advocate wrote: “The marked absence of
Sunday School workers was largely attributable to want of interest in the

Union ; but it had no doubt the day would come when the Union would be a
pronounced success, and every School would want to join it. But new enter-
prises took time to start, and the full report which it had published would, it
was hoped, result in many Schools joining the Union.”
At the succeeding Conference, the Rev. W. H. Beale was appointed Secre-
tary, and he reported next year that the Union was growing in popularity and
usefulness. The most important movement of the year, he said, had been the
inauguration of a system of competitive examinations open to all schools
connected with the Union, the examinations being held half yearly. A large
and important Meeting had been held in the interests of the Prize Fund during
the last District Meeting. In the Union there were 594 teachers, 104 officers,
and 8,104 scholars. Early in the year, a Conference of Sunday School workers
had been held. The Meeting was most enthusiastic, the collection amounting
to T3O. The system of competitive examinations has successfully continued
to the present time, the work assuming vaster proportions each year. The
Secretarial work has undergone frequent changes, that arduous position now
being filled by the Rev. R. H. Rickard and Mr. E. A. Bronsdon, who receive -


valuable assistance from the Sunday School Union Committee and the Sunday
School Council. No Meeting is more enthusiastic or popular than that at which
the prizes are presented to the successful competitors. But better than this
display of enthusiasm is the fact that the Union is developing the systematic
study of the Word of God, promoting uniformity and thoroughness in Sunday
School work, and exerting a beneficial influence gratifying to its promoters.
The promising openings in New South Wales and Queensland were now
so many and the opportunities so great that it was felt by the Conference of
1882 that the supply of Ministerial candidates must be largely augmented from
some other source. The Conference requested the British Conference to
supply a number of young men, and the Rev. Francis Tait, who was visiting
England, presented that request, which met with a generous response. Mr. Tait
carried out his part of the commission with wisdom and sagacity. The first
batch of young men arrived in The Peshawur on the 16th of November, and
were welcomed in York Street Church at a Public Meeting, marked by much
enthusiasm. The Rev. George Woolnough, M.A., as Clerical Secretary of the
Sustentation Society, introduced the newly-arrived Ministers, eleven in number,
to the President, remarking that the inception of the movement was due to the
Rev. George Hurst, who contributed a handsome sum towards the expenses
involved. He also referred to the valuable services of Mr. Tait in the selection
of the Ministers, and to the assistance rendered in England by the Rev. Dr.
Osborn. The Rev. George Hurst, in addressing the Meeting, boldly ventilated
the question of sending to England for others, offering a second £ 100 towards
the expense of another twelve. The Meeting was then addressed by five of the
young Ministers, the Revs. C. J. Prescott, 8.A., C. E. James, F. C. Boyer, W. H.
Harrison, and another. Referring to this meeting, The Advocate said; “We
trust the York Street Meeting may prove an augury of successful work to the
young men who have thus become publicly identified with Australian Method-
ism ; and, as the leaves of future years are unfolded, we hope the life histories
which these young men will write thereon will be filled with the records of
manifold victories won in the cause of the Redeemer and Saviour of men.” The
Meeting was unique, such a gathering not being known since the Rev. James
Calvert brought out his band of Missionaries. On this occasion the company
was larger. In quick succession several other Ministers arrived from the English
and Irish Conferences, and many of them are filling important positions to-day.
But the supply has now ceased. The impression is abroad, at least in official
circles, that men trained in Australia are better fitted for the heavy demands
made by the exigencies of Circuit life. But that is a question which lends itself
to argument.
An effort was made during 1886 to establish a Local Preachers’ Associa-
tion, a Meeting for the purpose of enrolling members and electing officers being
held on Friday, January Bth. Three Ministers and sixteen Local Preachers
were present, and the Rev. William Clarke was voted to the chair. The rules
prepared at a previous Meeting were read, amended, and then adopted. The
proposed constitution provided that all Ministers should be members, and Local


Preachers could qualify for admission by an annual subscription of ss. The
aims of the Association were the mental improvement of Local Preachers by
means of lectures, essays, and conversations, and concerted action in the supply-
ing of neglected places in need of help. The first officers were: President, Rev.
William Clarke; Vice-President, Mr. T. Cummins; Secretary, Mr. T. P.
Reeve; Treasurer, Mr. Reuben Hall; Committee, Rev. H. Youngman, and
Messrs. W. Jones, C. Tuke, J. C. Bennett, and J. Hambly. The Advocate said
that there was much good work possible to such an Association. By its
influence many of the prejudices against the order of Local Preachers might
be destroyed. It was within the power of the Association to elevate the tone
and quality of this valuable body of workers as a whole. By friendly inter-
course and criticism, and by the communication of knowledge, they could help
each other to greater usefulness. By taking counsel together it would be easier
to supply Circuits that were short handed, and to undertake evangelistic work
at present untouched. “If the aim is steadily kept in view to improve and
utilize the material at hand to the utmost, for the good of man and the Church,
there ought to be little question about the movement having sympathy. The
permanence and effectiveness of the Association must largely depend upon the
Local Preachers themselves. Ministers who can help, we hope will rally up, as
they are able ; but we urge the Brethren principally concerned to aid in making
the Association a centre of sympathy and wise and vigorous work.” But this
friendly hope was never fulfilled. Small and feeble as was the beginning, the
Association became feebler still. And whatever may have been the reason,
the Association so valuable in many other places, never became popular, and
after a brief but struggling existence it ceased to be.
City and suburban Methodism having developed so rapidly during these
years the Conference of 1891 thought it advisable to divide the Sydney District
into two, a resolution to that effect being moved by the Rev. George Lane.
The Rev. J. E. Carruthers, in seconding the resolution, remarked that in the
Sydney District there were thirty-five Circuits and six Departments, with sixty-
one Ministers and two Probationers; whilst the other Districts combined
contained but sixty-five Circuits, with fifty-seven Ministers and fourteen Pro-
bationers. There were one hundred and thirty-nine representatives in the
Sydney District alone, a number altogether disproportionate, when con-
trasted with the other Districts. He believed that this alteration would tend
to accelerate the progress of Methodism in the city. The proposal was carried
in the affirmative by a large majority. This arrangement, however, did not
finally approve itself to those who were most ardent in its advocacy, and it was.
soon found necessary to revert in some measure to the old system, continuing
Sydney as one District, and establishing two separate Districts at Illawarra and
Parramatta. This arrangement has worked satisfactorily to the present time.
During this period great expansion in Church building took place. Even
to name all the new buildings would occupy pages, for which room cannot be
found. We must, therefore, be content to refer briefly to the most noted of
these constructions. The first notable development was in connection with


Lourke Street Circuit; where, on Saturday afternoon, April 13th, 1878, the
foundation stone of a Church in Cleveland Street was laid by the Rev. Gervase
Smith, D-D. 1 in the presence of between two and three hundred people. Pro-
minent among the contributors were the Iredale family and Mr. and Mrs. Uther,
who presented the Trustees with £l5O, enabling them to undertake the building
of the Church.
A -7 Church at Mount Lachlan was also opened on Sunday, June 3c,
18/8, the Rev. George Hurst, President of the Conference, preaching the official
sermon. The foundation stones of the new Church at Burwood were laid
November sth, by Mrs. Schofield and Mrs. J. H. Fletcher. The Church was
opened on the 2nd of December by a public tea in the School of Arts, when it
was stated that the cost of the building was £2,50;, towards which the sum of
*> I > 1 45> 13 s - Qd. had been received. The old Church at Princes Street, erected
in 1817, was also removed, to make room for a building more in accordance
with the requirements and tastes of the times. The foundation stone was laid
y Mr. Alderman McArthur, of London, and an interesting address of a his-
toncal nature was given by Rev. R. Mansfield. The sum of £IOO was placed
upon the stone. Developments also took place at Wollongong, where, on the-
26th December, 1879, the foundation stone of a new Church, estimated to cost
£2,000, W as laid. In 1877, a new Church was built at Paddington through the
enterprise of the friends in the Waverley Circuit. The total cost was £4,000.
The Church was opened on Saturday, 3rd of February. The initial difficulties
were nobly undertaken, Mr. E. Vickery and Mr. Thomas Cowlishaw being
generous helpers in the enterprise. The new School Church at Petersham
followed on the 12th December, 1880, the Revs. W. Curnow and J. H. Fletcher
preaching the opening sermons. The total cost of land and building was a little
more than £I,OOO.
At what is now the important town of Lismore, services had been con-
ducted in the Temperance and Protestant Halls respectively, but a weather-
board Church was built in February, 1877, the Rev. W. G. R. Stephinson
preaching the opening sermon. The total cost was £250. The foundation
stone of a new Church at Singleton was laid by the Rev. George Woolnough,
M.A., President of the Conference, in May, 1881, the building costing £1,796.
Mr. Woolnough opened the Church in the following February. At Stanmore-
the erection of a Church had long been talked of. After much consultation
and not a little caution, the Trustees accepted the tender of Mr. Peter Hill for
the sum of £8,400. The previous Church had only been erected some six years.
This new enterprise was considered a bold one, but the growth of Stanmore
as a favourite suburb, and the location of Newington College in close proximity,,
compelled the Trustees to provide accommodation earlier than was anticipated.
The foundation stone was laid by the Rev. G. Woolnough, M.A., President, on
October 4th, 1881. The architects were Messrs. Thornley and Smedley, and the
contractor Mr. Peter Hill. It was estimated that the total cost would amount to
not less than £6,000. The memorial stone of a School Church was laid at
Homebush by Mrs. Schofield on Saturday, January 24th, 1885. The estimated:


'cost, including land, was £1,400, towards which Mrs. Schofield and the Rev.
George Hurst contributed £IOO each. The opening sermon was preached by
the Rev. J. H. Fletcher on Wednesday, 20th May, the following year.
An attempt was now made by the Executive Committee to establish
Methodism at Manly, which had sprung into prominence as a watering place.
A small Church was therefore erected, and formally opened in the early part
•of February, 1887. Methodism at Waverley also went in for a forward move-
ment, the dedication services of their new and beautiful Church taking place on
Sunday, 6th January, 1889. The Rev. J. B. Waterhouse commenced the
morning service, and the Rev. James Woolnough, the resident Minister,
preached the sermon. A public meeting followed on Monday evening, with
the Hon. E. Vickery in the chair. It was stated that up to that time the
-disbursements had been over £13,000. Liberal promises of help were given
by Mr. Vickery and Mrs. Schofield, whose generosity made the building of such
-a beautiful Church a possibility. The Church is capable of seating 1,000
persons, the height of the spire from the ground is 137 ft., and the Church itself,
to quote the words of the Rev. George Lane, who addressed the public meeting,
is “ the most beautiful belonging to the denomination in the Southern World.”
An important development took place at Dubbo, where a Church, described
as one of the handsomest and most comfortable out of Sydney, was built
largely by the perseverance and zeal of the Rev. Robert .Stewart. It was opened
during December, 1888, by the Rev. George Lane, President of the Conference.
At Newtown the memorial stone of a new School Hall was laid on the 18th
of October, 1890, by Mrs. Isaac Doust, the builder being Mr. James Catts, and
the contractor Mr. Kent. What was called a red letter day in the history of
New England Methodism, took place on the 30th November, 1892, when, owing
to the inadequate provision of the Church and the growing interests of that
important centre, it was resolved to build at a cost of £2,000. Mrs. Schofield
to lay the foundation stone, but, being unable to be present, she
requested Mr. E. Lonsdale to act on her behalf. The Rev. W. H. Beale, then
Superintendent of the Circuit, laid the second stone.
The work in the Foreign Mission Field, with one exception, was develop-
ing along successful lines. In 1877, the Jubilee of the Tongan Mission was
'-commemorated by religious services at Nukulofa on the 25th of June. It was
proposed to mark this interesting event by the erection of five large Memorial
Churches and a new College Hall, towards which a large sum was subscribed.
In writing of the Jubilee, one of the Missionaries said that the services were the
commencement of a gracious revival “which is still going on. Since the
beginning of the Jubilee Meeting eight hundred have joined the Church, and
many among them are Romanists. Our Prayer Meetings and other services
are crowded. Last Tuesday at Bea, twenty-two found peace, and twenty-eight
on Thursday at Fuamotu. Almost all the inhabitants of one Romanist village
have come over to us. On Friday at Mua, the King’s grand-daughter and many
-others were converted. The Lord blesses His work.” The work at Tubou
College was strengthening its claim to the gratitude of the country. Its

taknted Fnnapal had not only pubhshed an ed.tion of Ison’s Fables
beautifully illustrated, but he had prepared a large map of Europe for the
use of the college and schools, and an improved geography had been issued
rom the press. But most important of all, the Rev. J. E. Moulton was
about to proceed to England to publish a new edition of the Tongan Scriptures.
While Tonga was rejoicing, the Mission at Samoa experienced a distur-
bance brought about by two parties in that group of Islands each striving for
supremacy. One party represented those who joined Malietoa in the action
which he took with regard to Colonel Steinberger; the other party represented
themselves as the Government at Samoa, or, as they were often called, the
Steinberger party. Malietoa, who was King at the time of Colonel Stein-
beigers removal, was deposed by the Government party, another King being
nominated in his place. These opposing parties met near Apia, and while
negotiations were still pending one party was surrounded, thirty being killed,
the rest laying down their arms on condition that their lives should be spared.
The Rev. George Brown wrote that there was a great desire in Fiji that Samoa
should be annexed, but what the future would bring forth he was unable to tell.
Ihe Mission to New Britain was established in the year 1876; the leader-
ship being entrusted to the Rev. George Brown. Mr. Brown embarked in The
John Wesley, which sailed from Sydney on her annual voyage to Fiji, Samoa,
and Rotumah. The establishment of this Mission had been before the Com-
mittee of the Board of Missions during September, 1874. The success of the


existing Missions was so remarkable that they were now prepared to send
native Ministers and Teachers to assist Mr. Brown in his honourable task, and
he intended to take volunteers wherever available. At Fiji six married, and
three unmarried men were selected, the Government ascertaining that those who
volunteered thoroughly understood the character of the work to which they
were proceeding. Having placed before them the dangers awaiting them in
New Britain, the Government authorities questioned them as to their views.
Aminio Bale replying for the others said; “We have fully considered this
matter in our hearts, and if we die, we die, and if we live, we live.” They then
signed a declaration to the effect that they had been fully informed of the
nature of the work lying before them, and of the discomforts which they would
be called upon to undergo. But notwithstanding this precaution they persisted
in repeating their offer. Accompanied by Mr. Brown, they left in The John
Wesley for Samoa, picking up two other natives and their wives, and arriving at
Rotumah on the 23rd. Here the Rev. W. Fletcher, 8.A., joined Mr. Brown,
and together they sailed for New Britain on the 31st, sighting their destination
on the 14th of the following month. Next day they dropped anchor at Port
Hunter in Duke of York’s Island ; but, as it was Sunday, they remained quietly
on board. On the 16th the site for the Mission House was selected, and on the
following Thursday preparations for the building began, and in a short time
the building was erected. Mr. Brown soon made the acquaintance of the place
and people. After a stay of three weeks, The John Wesley started on her
return journey.
Mr. Brown now called for volunteers to occupy the stations on New Britain
and New Ireland. Fie was immediately met by a new difficulty. They all
volunteered! But having made his selection, Teachers were soon settled in
various parts of the group. Everything conspired to encourage the workers,
compelling Mr. Brown to write: “ All passed off well, and the people who came
with us were quite surprised by our reception. My own heart was full, and I
longed to be able to go away into the bush to weep for very thankfulness.”
There were ten Agents to be stationed about the group as soon as it could be
wisely done. In rapid succession New Ireland, New Britain, and other parts of
the Duke of York were visited, the sites for Teachers’ houses being selected. In
January, 1876, the first Church was opened for worship, and in October of the
same year, Mr. Brown left for Sydney, after fourteen months’ residence, during
which time wonderful pioneer results had been achieved. Nearly twelve months
later he returned to his great work, when the Mission was again vigorously
prosecuted. In 1879, Mr. Brown was forced to leave for New South Wales
owing to indisposition; but, as he had been joined by the Rev. Benjamin
Banks, the work was continued. During his absence sickness fell upon the
Missionary party, two of Mr. Brown’s children dying under distressing circum-
stances. Mr. and Mrs. Banks were much reduced by fever. But the patience
of the Mission party was above all praise. Mrs. Brown’s resignation and bravery
were an inspiration to her fellow-workers.


In January, 1881, Mr. Brown and his family left the Mission, followed by
the tears and prayers of those to whom they had been the messengers of sal-
vation. i hough but five years and a half since he commenced his work, the
results were astonishing. Ihe Rev. Benjamin Danks said: “ The work done
in those few years cannot be overestimated. In every department of Mission-
ary toil he laboured with unwearying diligence, and with no mean success.
Hundreds of miles of coast had been explored, people in scores of towns had
been visited, the thing had begun to assume definite shape in the minds of the
Missionaries, some school-books had been provided, and the Mission fully
established. He left behind him twenty Churches, twenty-nine Da}/ and
Sunday Schools, five hundred and fourteen Sunday and day scholars, and 2,390
attendants. We cannot follow the history of this interesting Mission in detail.
We can only further state that Mr. and Mrs. Danks continued this good work
amidst personal sickness, and the fighting and cannibalism of the people, which,
at times, severely tested their faith. They were soon joined by the Rev. I.
Rooney, and in 1882 the Rev. R. H. Rickard commenced his work in the
Islands. 1 hough the work done by the Missionaries and their wives was
heroic, that of the 1 ongans, Samoans, and Fijians was not one whit behind it.
Right nobly, as Mr. Danks said, “ did they respond to the trust reposed in them,
shrinking not from the work at the onset, nor quivering in fiercest conflicts. At
the opening of the Mission, under their intrepid leader, they were equal to all
its demands for dogged perseverance and patient endurance; and they take
rank among the foremost of Christ’s Heralds.”
The Mission in Fiji, commenced under Cargill and Cross, was now about
to celebrate its Jubilee. It would indeed require a gifted pen and much space
to record the work done since the establishment of the Mission. The story
remains yet to be written. Suffice it here to say that among the men intimately
connected with New South Wales who gave their energies and life to this
glorious work, in addition to those already named, were William Moore, who
went to Fiji in 1850, Joseph Waterhouse, who was privileged to baptise the
dreaded Thakombau in 1857, William Fletcher, 8.A., Francis Tait, and Lorimer
Fison, M.A., who did a noble work for the Mission. And who can forget
I homas Baker, in labours abundant, never neglecting a duty or shunning a
danger, murdered in 1867, six of the Fijian Christian natives sharing the same
fate. Add to these, Frederick Langham, John Watsford, and David Hazle-
wood. These names are interwoven in the story of Fijian Missions. To
commemorate the Jubilee the Native Church proposed to raise a fund
to defray the expense of a Church at Suva ; to complete the Church at Bau, to be
designated the “ Cakobau Memorial Church ” ; to enlarge the Native Institution
grounds, and to improve the building; and to extend the New Britain Mission,
in the establishment of which the Fijian teachers had so largely assisted. The
General Conference appointed the Revs. John Watsford, A. Reid, and W,
Kelynack, D.D., with Messrs. B. James, jun., S. S. King, and T. Buddie, a
deputation to visit Fiji, and to represent the Colonial Churches at the Jubilee
services. In his first communication from Bau, Dr. Kelynack wrote: “We
begin the proceedings in connection with the Jubilee next week. The first


meeting will be away among the mountain tribes at the head of the Rewa River,
these being the last to accept Christianity, d hence we shall return to Rewa,
taking that town second in order. ... Ihe gatherings are looked forward
to with great interest by Missionaries and people.”
In reviewing the Fiji Mission in the light of his first visit at the Annual
Missionary Meeting, Dr. Kelynack said in the course of a brilliant speech;
“ Take two or three index points from the dial plate of our progress, and let
them stand to indicate the marvellous prosperity with which God has blessed
the enterprise. Take this fact, that we have twelve hundred villages and towns
under our care, in each of which we have a teacher or preaching place. Take
another, that we have no less than three thousand F ijians engaged in preaching
Christ, and thirty thousand Church members, most of whom have tested as well
as seen that the Lord is gracious. And then, if you take the one hundred and
two thousand attendants on public worship, the result is one which is almost
beyond belief; because it places Fiji in this position. That from go to 95 per
cent, of its population is in attendance on the ministration of the Gospel, a
fact which may well excite the wonderment of the world. . . . Twenty
years after the Mission was established, when the expenditure for the year was
£3,000, the sum collected in Fiji was £IOO. . . . Last year the free con-
tributions of the Fiji Churches were upwards of £5,000; and from the
beginning of the Mission until now they have contributed in cash between
£60,000 and £70,000, in addition to all they have done in the erection of
Churches and Schools and dwellings. . . . In the history of this Mission,
and, as helping in the achievements of its triumphs, what noble instances
has it furnished of consecration and service on the part of men of whom any
Church might well be proud ; and of women who gave evidence of a grandeur
of character, and cheerfully accepted voluntary exile from home and country
in a spirit that was sublimely heroic. The roll of the honoured dead shines
with a blazonry of many a name that is to-day embalmed in the memory with
tenderest reverence and love for all they were and for all they dared and did
and suffered.”
In the year 1890 the Board of Missions found itself called upon to undertake
yet another Mission, His Excellency Sir William McGregor, Governor of
British New Guinea, having requested the Board of Missions to give its
attention to New Guinea and the outlying Districts. Sir William McGregor
knew something of the work of Wesleyan Missionaries in the South Seas, and
the fact that he had written, asking them to help in the work of Christianising
and civilising New Guinea, spoke volumes. There were in New Guinea 400
islands, exclusive of the mainland, almost untouched by Christian Mission-
aries. The field they were asked to occupy was greater than the combined
Missions already in existence. In order to undertake the work successfully
they required at once £2,000 with which to commence operations. At the
Annual Missionary Meeting in 1890, a collection for this purpose was made
and an anonymous subscription of £250 from one who designated himself “ An


Outsider was received. The Rev. George Brown, then General Secretary,
visited New Guinea in 1890 by direction of the General Conference, the
Mission commencing the following year.
Volunteers for the new Mission were soon forthcoming. The Rev. W.
E. Bromilow with Mrs. Bromilow, was placed in charge ; and he was accom-
panied by the Revs. S. B. Fellows, J. I I'ield, J. Watson and Mr. G. H.
Bardsley, Lay Missionary. Dr. Brown accompanied the party, and the Revs.
R. H. Rickard and W. Brown with Mrs. Brown, who were proceeding to New
Britain, were with him. Among the Native volunteers there were fifty-three
adults and twelve children, who came from Tonga, Fiji and Samoa, and were
to be employed as teachers. The Missionary party ■ proceeded to their des-
tination by way of Sydney. In addition to other Meetings held in Sydney
and its suburbs, a large and enthusiastic gathering took place in the Centenary
Hall for the purpose of bidding God speed to the pioneer band. The plat-
form was filled with Ministers, while native Missionaries, with their wives and
children, occupied the platform in front. They were as fine a band of Christian
men and women as any who had given themselves to this noble enterprise.
Their souls were filled with one idea: “ New Guinea for Christ.” Addresses
were given by the Rev. Lorimer Fison, M.A., Rev. Samuel Ella, of the London
Missionary Society, the Organising Secretary of the Anglican Mission, and a
number of Natives. The Meeting was remarkable and memorable, auguring
well for the success of the Mission.
The Missionary party landed at Dobu on June 19th, 1891. The usual
sights of heathendom were very noticeable, one of the most prominent being
the skulls of men and women who had been eaten, exposed in the front of the
houses in the different villages. They justified Sir William McGregor’s
description that the people of Dobu were amongst the worst natives of New
Guinea. This Mission was remarkable in many ways. It was begun with a
larger number of Agents, and with more complex appliances for work than
any other Mission ; but the results have fully justified the wisdom of the plan.
Referring to this departure The Advocate said: “The sympathies of the whole
Church have been awakened, and a noble band of men has been found who
are now on their way to open a Mission which, we trust, will be one of the
crowning glories of our Church. The brief sojourn in this city of the Native
Missionaries and their wives has been like an inspiration to our city Churches.
We have seen what God can do. We have heard from their own lips.” A
number of friends and well wishers assembled on board the Lord of the Isles
for the purpose of taking leave of this noble band. Headed by the President,
an extemporised service was held, a few words of sympathy being spoken by
the Rev. George Lane and Archdeacon King.
As to the work already accomplished, we cannot do better than quote the
words of His Excellency the Governor, Sir William McGregor, in one of his
Reports: —“Two points have been characteristic of this Mission from first
to last —intense earnestness and sound, practical good sense. Their deep

earnestness, which never approaches bigotry or fanaticism, began to tell upon
the natives soon after the work was begun. They have maintained, without
flagging, the zeal and industry with which they began, with the result that
there is perhaps no more successful Mission than theirs. Mr. Bromilow has
reduced Dobu and its neighbourhood to a decently-behaved community, who
keep Sabbath, go to School, attend Church, and conduct themselves like an
ordinary Christian parish. The immensity of the transformation can be ap-
preciated only by one who has seen these tribes half a score of years ago, and
who visits them now. . . . The lapse of time has speedily strengthened
the conviction that Mission labour is of immense value and importance in the
Possessions. The training and education of children and of youth is practically
in the hands of the Missions. The figures will give a fair idea of the extent
to which the very important task is attended to. The example of the regular
and upright life of the Missionaries is of itself an object lesson of great
significance. The humanity they practise in regard to the sick, the castaway,
and the abandoned child, the moral force by which they exercise restraint over
many bad characters, and their sympathy with the weak and suffering, are all
softening and ameliorating influences that would not otherwise have been
supplied to the natives.”
This is indeed high praise from a valuable quarter, for no one is better
able to judge of the good results of Mission operations than Sir William
McGregor. But its greatest value lies in its truth. But this is not all, for
Sir William’s successor, Sir G. A. Le Hunte, K.C.M.G., abundantly confirmed
what Sir William had previously written. Though in existence such a short
time, the Mission now reports that there are 32 Churches, 55; native members,
2,825 day scholars, 2,137 Sunday School scholars, and 16,376 attendants on
public worship.


What must be considered the darkest day in connection with the Missions
came to the Church in Tonga during the period with which we are now dealing,
where secession, with persecution fell upon the people. The barest outline of
this painful story can only be given. It is first necessary to state that the Mission
Board of Management, with the concurrence of the President, possesses the
power to recall any Missionary. This power was conferred by General Con-
ference regulation in the year 1878. The Board of Missions now thought it
advisable in the interests of the work in Tonga, to recall the Rev. Shirley W.
Baker, Chairman of the Friendly Islands District. Complaints having been
made against his administration, a Deputation was appointed for the purpose
of enquiry. On considering its report, Mr. Baker’s recall was confirmed, and
he was given permission to rest for one year, and to reside in New Zealand.
The appointment of the Deputation irritated King George, who had requested
that the Tongan Church should be made an independent District, free from
the control of New South Wales, threatening serious steps if this were not
done. The request for the formation of a District was granted by the General
Conference in 1881. Meanwhile, Mr. Baker had gone to New Zealand, from
which place he unexpectedly returned, to assist, so he alleged, in burying the
King’s son. But he evidently had other purposes in view, for immediately on
his return he took office under the Tongan Government as Minister of Foreign
Affairs and Comptroller of Finance. Mr. Baker was then summoned to appear
before the Committee of Discipline, a command which he ignored, as he ques-
tioned the authority of the Committee to deal with his case. He appeared,
however, at the Conference of 1882, when he was put on his trial and con-
demned on all the counts. He was then asked openly to resign, and after
taking time for consideration, he sent in his resignation.
The authorities afterwards thought it advisable to recall the Rev. J. B.
Watkin, appointing him to the Shoalhaven Circuit. Ihe Rev. J. E. Moulton
succeeded Mr. Baker as Chairman of the District, the Rev. E. E. Crosby, 8.A.,
being associated with him. This step seemed to make Mr. Baker furious, and
he forwarded the following telegram to the President of the General
Conference. Its contents give the key to the situation. King and ( hiefs
enraged at Watkin’s recall. Decided to establish National Church, and get
Watkin as first Minister. King delayed at my request. President’s letter
unsatisfactory. No new plan acceptable. This is the King’s ultimatum:
Tonga to be an independent District like Auckland; Watkin to be reinstated,
Tonga to be attached to New Zealand. Grant this, peace. Reject, one
secession. Don’t be deceived. The secession will be universal and popular.
It was impossible to grant all that this telegram demanded; but the
requests were met as far as practicable. Mr. Watkin was allowed to remain
and was appointed to another station in Tonga. This apparently did not
calm Mr Baker, and he made the Rev. J. E. Moulton the scapegoat. The
Government now proceeded on the lines indicated in the telegram. Its first
step was to take possession of the Wesleyan Day Schools. It next set up a
rival College, making it known that no man would be eligible for a Government


position unless he had been trained in this Government Institution. Govern-
ment officials were forbidden to preside at Missionary Meetings. Against
these arbitrary and unconstitutional proceedings the Conference and Board
of Missions entered its protest, the Rev. J. H. Fletcher, who was President
in 1884, writing a respectful, though strongly-worded official letter. To this
letter no answer of any kind was received.
The succeeding steps in the secession are soon told. In the year 1885
a separate Church was established in response to the King’s wish, so Mr. Baker
said. But Mr. Baker’s was the master mind at the back of the King. The
Rev. J. B. Watkin resigned, and the way was made clear for the establishment
of this Independent or Free Church, falsely so called. The violent efforts made
to establish it appear strangely at variance with the principles of freedom
or independence. d hreats were freely used, native prejudices were played
upon, the Teachers and Missionaries were forbidden the use of their own
Churches, their goods were spoiled, many were deported, and several were
threatened with death by hanging if they did not join the National Church.
One chief, on being approached by the King’s messengers, replied: “ The King
can do what he likes with my body, but my religion is my own ; I will not
change.” This reply embodied the spirit of many others. Mr. Crosby
protested against these unrighteous acts. But Mr. Baker, replying as Premier
said; “ I respectfully reply that if you consider your rights have been infringed
or usurped, that there are Law Courts established in Tonga for the purpose
of taking cognisance of such complaints, and I must therefore refer you to the
same.” At the native “ fonos,” the Wesleyans were often told that if they
refused to join the new Church they must seek another country. Several were
forced to leave, and persecution became rife. With the hope of ending this
persecution, the Committee of Privileges addressed Fler British Majesty’s Vice-
Consul, and another deputation was appointed by the General Conference, the
Deputation being the Revs. John Watsford, Frederick Langham, and William
T. Rabone. Its findings provoked an animated and protracted discussion in
the Conference of 1886, and the Conference passed these resolutions:—
“ The Conference heartily thanks the members of the Deputation for
hastening, at much personal inconvenience, their visit to Tonga, and recognises
the ability and kindly spirit with which they sought to accomplish the difficult
task assigned to them. The Conference is deeply pained to find that at the
time of the visit of the Deputation, the members and adherents of our Church
were in different places being cruelly persecuted on account of their refusal to
turn over to the New Church set up by King Tubou and his Premier, the Hon.
S. W. Baker, while ixi various parts of the group forcible possession had been
taken of our Churches. It regrets to learn that the efforts of the Deputation
to bring about a reconciliation were unsuccessful, and that the promises made
in answer to the appeals of the Rev. John Watsford and his associates, that
the Wesleyans might be allowed to worship God according to their consciences,
as the constitution of Tonga provides, have not been fulfilled. The Conference


expiesses its warm sympathy with our people in the painful trials to which
they have been subjected for so many months, and views with much emotion
the patient, heroic, and martyr-like spirit they have so generally displayed.”
As proof of its confidence in the Rev. J. E. Moulton, it refused to remove him
fiom Tonga, even though the Deputation had recommended his removal. Mr.
Bakers race was nearly run. Ihe Imperial authorities now thought that his
vagaries called for enquiry. Enquiries were instituted, and one result was
the deportation of the Premier for two years. Simultaneously with his de-
parture, persecution ceased, and the scattered Church members, left free to
follow the promptings of their hearts, have gradually returned to those from
whom they were mercilessly driven or ruthlessly torn.
Among the Ministers who passed away, the first in order was the Rev. G.
H. Holmes, whose sun went down while it was yet day. He died August Ist,
1874, in the thirty-fifth year of his age, and the eighth of his Ministry. In
the most important Circuits, he exercised a ministry of no ordinary eloquence
and power, being greatly beloved by the people among whom he laboured.
I hough burdened by long continued and wasting disease, he spared not himself
in the service of Christ. Rev. d homas Benson Roots, born at Camden in
the year 1846, was also struck down in early life. He died at Singleton, April
1 °th, 1877, in his thirty-first year, from hemorrhage of the lungs. He was a
man of high character, good abilities, and amiable disposition, while his piety
was deep and genuine. The Rev. Charles Creed reached a much riper age,
passing away on the eighth of February, 1879, having reached his sixty-eighth
year, after 42 years service in the ministry. First, as a Missionary in New
Zealand, and afterwards in several Circuits in New South Wales he laboured
with much success. During his sickness he frequently said: “ The will of the
Lord be done,” and “ God is Love.” But the greatest veteran of all was the
Rev. William Schofield, who died June 9th, 1878, in his 85th year. Mr.
Schofield’s work has beert referred to elsewhere, and here we need only add
that as a Circuit Minister, he was indefatigable in pastoral work, his sermons
were evangelical and earnest, he had a remarkable gift in prayer, and he was an
affectionate and faithful leader and a judicial adviser. The Rev. William
Wilson passed away in his 50th year, on January 4th, 1881, after twenty-one
years service as a Circuit Minister. As a preacher he was original, faithful
and earnest, and was altogether a fine specimen of a useful Methodist Preacher.
After preaching an intensely earnest sermon from the words “ To die is gain,”
he said to several friends: “ I have preached my last sermon,” a prophecy which
was fulfilled.
The Rev. Benjamin Chapman, who died at the age of 62, had been 37
years in the Ministry, passing to his reward on the 10th of September, 1881
First a Missionary to the Gambia, he afterwards returned to England, pro-
ceeding thence to Australia. He was a man of strict integrity and unquestion-
able piety, a warm and constant friend, and a laborious and useful Minister,
being deeply respected and widely beloved. During his eight years’ office as
General Secretary of Foreign Missions, he displayed great promptitude and


fidelity, his services being of eminent value to the Connexion. He was elected
President in the year 1872. On his last Sunday he attempted to preach at
Sackville Reach, but being too ill to proceed with the service, he was conveyed
to the Parsonage at Windsor, where he lingered for a week in great pain, and
then passed to that land where pain is unknown. About this time news
reached the Colony of the martyrdom of the Rev. Thomas Baker, suddenly
cut down by Fijian natives, who in their recklessness chopped him across the
back and on the right side of the neck. He died in his 36th year, after nine
years in the Ministry, and he fell while in the path of duty. The Rev. William
Fletcher, 8.A., spent a short time only in New South Wales and Queensland,
his earlier ministry being in New Zealand and Fiji. He rendered signal service
in connection with the Institution for the training of Native Ministers, the
results of which have been of the highest value to the work of God. His
Industry and ability also found scope m the translation of the New Testament.
When in New South Wales, sickness fell upon him, compelling him to retire
from the active work, and finally developing into a prolonged illness, borne with
Christian meekness. Systematic in his habits, gentle in spirit, scholarly in
Ins culture, clear in his presentation of Divine truth, assiduous as a pastor and
faithful in all things, he lived as a servant of Christ, and died on the 20th of
June, 1881, in the 52nd year of his age and the 25th of his Ministry.
The Rev. Henry Honey Gaud died at the ripe age of 72, after 47 years
in the Ministry. Arriving in Tasmania in the year 1839, he removed to
Parramatta in 1852, and subsequently occupied some of the most important
Circuits in New South Wales. His preaching was clear and forceful. As a
pastor he was affectionate and diligent, securing a large circle of friends who
deeply mourned his death and highly respected his memory. In the year
1867, he became President of the Australasian Conference, in addition to being
Chairman of several Districts, and one of the General Treasurers of the
Missionary Society. Flis last illness was short, but severe and depressing.
His last words were “All is well.” The next year, 1884, the great reaper was
unusually busy, laying his hand first upon the Rev. Robert Edward Bellhouse,
who died April 19th, 1884. in the nth year of his Ministry, and the 35th of
his age. Arriving in the Colony in 1875, he laboured diligently in several
Circuits, though suffering frequently from personal affliction. He possessed
gifts of a high order, and was beloved and esteemed as an able Minister of the
Gospel and a true friend. In illness, as in health, he glorified God, and as
the end drew near remarked; “ I think the last has come. All is well.” The
Rev. W. H. B. Sylvester, an Irishman by birth, was a young man of rich promise,
though to him but a few years’ service were permitted. In April, 1884, after
five months’ earnest and successful work in the Moruya Circuit he died of
consumption. His last utterances were: “Oh death, where is thy sting ?Oh
grave, where is thy victory ?”„ He had been four years in the Ministry and was
only twenty-four years of age.
The Rev. Edward Dunstan died October 25th, after four years’
service, in which his whole hearted consecration won the esteem and
love of his Brethren and of the people. His earnest preaching bore

fruit in the conversion of many souls. His last words were apparently
addressed to his Master, to Whom he said: “Oh Jesus, my Saviour, I am
coming soon." The Rev. William C. Thompson, who died at sea on his return
voyage from England, where he had gone for the benefit of his health, was a
preacher of much acceptableness and power. His chief distinctions were his
entire consecration to God and his success in winning souls for his Master.
1 he Rev. George Hurst, whose work has frequently been referred to, made
his mark upon the Church. Converted under the preaching of his brother,
the Rev. Benjamin Hurst, he was received into the Ministry, and embarked
for Australia in the year 1859. In 1870 he was elected President of the
Australasian Conference, and in 1878 President of the New South Wales and
Queensland Conference. In both these important positions he discharged
his duties with great advantage to the Church. He was an able preacher,
a ready and powerful debater, and a diligent student, possessing extensive
acquaintance with Theology and General Literature. For sixteen years he
filled the office of Secretary to the Sustentation Society, working with such
zeal and success that many new places were supplied with Ministers, and the
interests of Methodism were greatly developed. His labours in this office
were entirely gratuitous. He took a prominent part in obtaining young
Ministers from England, liberally contributing towards the expense thus
involved. He passed peacefully away at his residence at Burwood on July
ist, 1885, in the 46th year of his Ministry. The Rev. William Rosewarne
spent but a short time in New South Wales, from whence he proceeded to Fiji,
where he worked for three years and a-half, winning for himself the character
of an earnest Christian and a devout Missionary.


Another veteran in the person of the Rev. James Watkin passed away on
the 14th May, 1886, in the 81 st year of his age, and the 56th of his Ministry.
His great work in Fiji has already been referred to. In New Zealand it was
his singular honour to throw his activity and enthusiasm into a third Mission.
From New Zealand he returned to New South Wales, receiving in 1862 the
appointment as President of the Australasian Conference. He tooK rank with
the ablest preachers of Australia, and in preaching and writing he used his
large gifts of humour with skill and effectiveness. His obituary notice said:
“ Always alert and willing to go anywhere, generous to a fault, an earnest
preacher, a faithful and tender pastor, and an uncompromising foe to all untruth
and self pleasing, greatly beloved both within and without the borders of
Methodism —a Paul in his earlier days, a Barnabas in his later days. He
entered his last period of rest as a Supernumerary in the year 1869. . .
As a venerable Minister of most benign countenance, cheerful speech, and
large sympathies, he was a familiar presence in all Methodist Assemblies of
every kind in Sydney for more than a quarter of a century. He passed to his
reward in the spirit of a little child.” The Rev. T. Walkden Brown passed
away the following year in the prime of his manhood, the zenith of his fame,
and the twenty-first year of his Ministry. Converted near Bathurst under the
Ministry of the Rev. R. Caldwell, he began to preach in 1864, and was after-
wards received into the Ministry. He possessed special talents, which
marked him for great usefulness. He was one of the ablest of platform
speakers, being very successful also in the salvation of souls. “He possessed
a fertile mind, a lively imagination, a strong, retentive memory, a pleasing
humour, and a ready utterance.” When on a visit to an old friend in Hobart
in the hope of re-establishing his health, he was seized with paralysis, and
quietly passed away on the 7th February.
The next year witnessed the death of two other able Ministers in the
prime of life, the first being the Rev. Charles Olden, who died at the age of
47, on May 2nd, 1888, after 27 years in the Ministry. In Queensland and
in New South Wales he made full proof of his Ministry. His mind was vigor-
ous, active and versatile, and his chief joy was found in devising and carrying
out plans for the extension of the work of God in the salvation of souls. He
gave special attention to the social and moral condition of the people, and as
a pastor proved himself kind and attentive. The call came unexpectedly, for
while actively discharging his pastoral duties at Parramatta, he was stricken
down by typhoid fever. His last utterance was: “ I shall soon solve the great
mystery.” The Rev William Thomas Rabone, son of the Rev. Stephen Rabone,
died on the 15th of August m the 49th year of his age and the 25th of his
Ministry. First in New South Wales, afterwards in Tonga, and later still in
the Mother State, he laboured with much zeal and devotion. In some respects
he was a model Minister. His faithful discharge of duties in all their details,
his candour and amiability, his unfaltering loyalty, his constant devotion and
his self-sacrificing generosity were worthy of praise and imitation. He had a
genius for hard work ; and with the ruling passion strong in death, he said:
“At last I have finished the work Thou didst give me to do.” The only death

recorded the following year, 1889, was that of the Rev. W. B. Boyce, a member
of the British Conference. Mr. Boyce’s work and worth are referred to at
length in other parts of this volume and nothing further need be added here.
The death roll the following year was heavy, six Ministers being called
to their reward. The first was the Rev. G. W. R. Stephinson, who laboured
first in Victoria, then in the South Seas and Queensland, and subsequently in
New South Wales. He was several times honoured with the position of Chair-
man of a District, and in 1887 he was elected President. He gave ungrudgingly
of his time, talents, and energy to the cause of Christ. Kind and attentive
as a Pastor, earnest and practical as a Preacher, though possessing a vigorous
constitution, he succumbed to the pressure of over-work, and while preparing
for the service of God’s house, he suddenly passed away without
a struggle. The Rev. Joseph H. Fletcher died on the 30th June. Particulars
of his work are given in the chapter on Newington College and the reader
is referred to that source for information. The Rev. Hans Mack came to Aus-
tralia in response to a call by the Rev. R. Young. His first appointment was
in the Braidwood Circuit. In Tasmania, South Australia and New South
Wales he did good work. In temperament he was warm and impulsive, but a
true and generous friend. As a Pastor, he was sympathetic and tender, as a
student, diligent, and as a Preacher, he gave evidence of a penetrating mind,
while his sermons were marked by solidity and weight. Returning from Eng-
land, whither he had gone in search of health, he was compelled to disembark


at Adelaide, where, after a few days’ intense suffering, the end came. He was
58 years of age and had been 36 years in the Ministry. The Rev. R. W.
Vanderkiste, after working in London as a city Missionary, came to Sydney
with eight other Ministers in the year 1854. While in the Dungog Circuit,
he was lost in the mountain ranges. His health was so impaired through
exposure, that he was compelled to become a Supernumerary. A severe accident
in his own house in the year 1890 so much affected him that he never recovered,
and on December 7th of the same year, after 36 years in the Ministry, he passed
away at the age of 71.
Rev. T. A. Hanton laboured in New South Wales six years only. On his
arrival in the Colony, he was appointed to the Morpeth Circuit, and in 1889
he removed to the Macleay River. Here, on his way to a Sunday morning
service, he was swept down the Macleay River in an attempt to cross the Bel-
grade Falls. He passed from toil to rest on Sunday, January 25th. Ihe Rev.
J. B. Waterhouse was another of God’s gifts to Methodism in New South
Wales. Born in London, he received his education at Kingswood School, and
his theological training at Richmond College. Thence he came to Australia,
and for thirty-five years faithfully discharged the duties of a Methodist Preacher
in Tasmania, South Australia and New South Wales. In 1882, through serious
failure of health, he retired from the full work of the Ministry, but not to rest
from labour. He honourably filled the office of President in the year 1876,
and for 16 years was one of the General Treasurers of the Sustentation Society.
He also filled a similar position in connection with the Foreign Missionary
Society for seven years. His services here were invaluable, and his efforts
on behalf of the Church in Tonga will not soon be forgotten. By his sagacious
advice he contributed largely to the settlement of the Church Properties upon
the trust of the New Model Deed, and also to the passing of the Property Act
of 1889. His preaching was evangelical, and his sermons were carefully pre-
pared. As a pastor, he was diligent and tender, and his memory fragrant. In
his final illness, which was severe and agonising, he cried: “Lord Jesus, come
quickly.” Shortly before the end he tried to sing the first line of the Evening
Hymn. He died at Randwick on the 18th January, 1891, in the 70th year
of Ins age and the 46th of his Ministry.
The year 1891 saw the close of the work of the Revs. John Bowes and
George Pickering, two early pioneers. Mr. Bowes’ first appointment was in
connection with the Wollongong Circuit, where he left many spiritual children.
Respected and loved as a Class Leader and Preacher, he was unusually success-
ful as a pastor, and he has left behind him a name that will long be cherished
by his many friends for his beautiful and consistent life. As a Supernumerary
at Stanmore, he rendered useful service in many Circuits, until he ceased at
once to work and live. George Pickering’s work was on the same lines as
that of Mr. Bowes. Sent to Camden by the Rev. W. B. Boyce to supply a
vacancy, he gave great satisfaction and continued in the active work of the
Ministry till the year 1877, when he became a Supernumerary. While in
charge of extensive Circuits, necessitating long and wearisome journeys, his


duties were conscientiously discharged. Shortly before his death, he was found
weeping, his tears being caused, so he said, by the goodness of his Heavenly
Father. He died on the 22nd of September. The Rev. Thomas Danson, who
had just entered upon his work as a Probationer, was drowned in the Hunter
River on the 23rd of March. The Rev. William Kelynack, D.D., also passed
away during this year ; but, as his life is dealt with in the same chapter as that
of the Rev. J. H. Fletcher, the reader is again directed to that source for in-
formation. The Rev. Ralph Mansfield, a Methodist veteran, also died at his
residence in Parramatta in September after a short but painful illness.
Among the laymen who died during this period, the first in order of date
was Mr. Thomas Cowlishaw, who passed away at Paddington on the 6th No-
vember, 1875, in the 70th year of his age. For some years he was Superin-
tendent of Bourke Street Sabbath School, and in numerous other ways he
rendered invaluable service to the Church and its Ministry. Mr. Richard Black,
for 63 years in membership with the Church, died on the 9th January, 1878, in
the 80th year of his age. Mr. T. W. Bowden, son of Mr. Thomas Bowden, the
pioneer Methodist, died at his residence at Newtown on the 24th April, 1878.
He was remarkable for his business talent and his physical and mental acti-
vities. Mr. John Ducker, who spent the greater part of his life at Richmond,
died on the 10th April, 1879. He was a true friend to the Methodist Church,
and a man of blameless life. The Hon. George Oakes, M.L.C., died in his
69th year, meeting his death by a tram accident in Sydney in the year 1881.
Mr. Oakes worshipped in the old Church at Parramatta, and was a good friend
to the various Methodist Institutions. The Bourke Street Circuit lost another
valuable helper by the death of Mr. Callaghan, who died in August, 1884. He
had been prominently identified with the Sabbath Schools at Chippendale,
York Street and Hay Street. He was associated with the various efforts of
the Church for a period of 45 years, and was a member for the lengthened
period of 56 years.
Mr. Launcelot Iredale was also connected with the Bourke Street Circuit
and Chippendale, though the latter part of his life was spent at Waverley.
fie was 75 years of age. Flis long life was one of honourable usefulness, in
which he occupied several prominent positions in the Church. Methodism
also suffered a severe loss in the death of Sir George Wigram Allen, K.C.M.G.,
who died suddenly in August, 1885. Plis'record of service as a public man was
very remarkable. Not alone in the Methodist Church is his name endeared
by generous thought. In the University, the Sydney Grammar School, the
Bible Society, the Missionary Society, the Public Education of the Colony,
the proposed Wesley College, and the erection of Newington College, he took
a prominent part. His name is one to be remembered with loving thought,
associated with a good man and a stainless gentleman. His record as a citizen
was absolutely unique. Throughout he maintained that sustaining trust in
the Lord Jesus Christ, assisting regularly in the service at Toxteth Chapel,
built by his father. The Hon. James Byrnes who, for many years, was a

pillar in the Church at Parramatta, died in September, 1886, aged 81. His
last illness, though accompanied by much pain, was a striking illustration of
the power of Christian faith to inspire peace and assure a certain hope. The
Hon. William Byrnes, also of Parramatta, an old and highly respected member
of the Church, died in the year 1891.

CHAPTER XVIII.
THE LITERATURE OE METHODISM.
II is claimed that Methodism was the pioneer of many of the popular move-
ments of to-day. Fourteen years before Robert Raikes began his work in
Gloucester Cathedral, Hannah Ball commenced a Methodist Sunday
School at Fligh Wycombe. And Sophia Cooke, another Methodist, who
afterwards became the wife of Samuel Bradburn, first suggested to Raikes the
idea of a Sunday School, and actually marched with him at the head of his ragged
scholars the first Sunday they were taken to Church. The Bible Society found
its pioneer in “ The Naval and Military Bible Society,” projected by George
Cussons and organised by a number of his Methodist companions. An appeal
from Melville Florae, at one time one of Wesley’s preachers, led to the found-
ing of the London Missionary Society. John Venn, son of Henry Venn, the
Methodist Clergyman, started the Church Missionary Society, and John Wesley
and Thomas Coke formed the first Tract Society in 1782; that is, seventeen
years before the Religious Tract Society was organised. The first Dispensary
the world ever knew is said to be that established in the Foundry at Moorfields
by Wesley himself, while he also led the way in humanitarian agencies by his
Stranger’s Friend Society, which paid from forty to fifty thousand visits to the
sick poor of London every year.
But in no sphere is this more apparent than in the realm of literature. To
promote religious knowledge Wesley issued his Christian Library , containing
abridgments of the choicest works of practical divinity and beginning with
translations of the Fathers. It continued through fifty volumes, and was pub-
lished at a loss of £2OO. “ His Christian Library ,” says Thomas Jackson,
“ was a noble effort to render available, to the spiritual interests of the people
in general, the scarce and valuable works of voluminous and learned authors.”
In addition to his theological works, which are simply astounding in their scope
and ability, he prepared a History of England and a History of the Church,
each in four volumes, and a Compendium of Natural Philosophy in five volumes.
And he issued text books on English, Latin, Greek, Hebrew, and French Gram-
mar, Logic and Rhetoric, an English Dictionary, a History of Rome, editions
of the Classics, and other works chiefly for use in his experimental school at
Kingswood. His Arminian Magazine , so useful in his day, is now the oldest
religious periodical in the world. From his Printing House and Bookstore he
sent forth thousands of Tracts, the sale of which brought him money only to be
used in designs for popular usefulness. “It may be questioned whether any
English writer of the last or the present century has equalled him in the num-
ber of his publications.”—( Stevens , vol. 11., p. s°B)


The example thus set by the Founder of Methodism has been followed by
many of his successors. As shown in other parts of this volume, the early
Missionaries were the pioneers in some of the most beneficent movements,
notably the Benevolent Society and the Tract Society. The reader will not
therefore be surprised to learn that the first religious Magazine issued in Aus-
tralasia was the sole production of the Wesleyan Missionaries in the year 1821.
This was known as The Australian Magazine, and was edited by the Revs.
Benjamin Carvosso, Walter Lawry, and Ralph Mansfield, Wesleyan Mission-
aries, and printed by Mr. George Howe, also a Wesleyan. It continued for
about eighteen months with a good remunerative circulation, but from the
frequent changes of residence, which in those days took place, it was found
inconvenient to maintain it. After its discontinuance Mr. Carvosso wrote moral
essays for the Colonial newspapers, “ in which he gave them as much gospel
as they would bear.” And, unfortunately, that was not much. But while the
opportunity was there Mr. Carvosso and his assistants made the most of it.
The contents of their Magazine included Theology, Biography, Natural Philo-
sophy, Literary and Religious Intelligence, European and Colonial Incidents,
and a Meteorological Diary. Their attitude on religious matters generally may
be gathered from their own words: “ While it is our determination,” they said,
“ to give to the Australian Magazine a decidedly religious character, it is far
from our intention to wish to make it the organ of sectarian peculiarities. Cor-
dially believing the doctrines of the Established Church to be those of the
Bible, we shall continue to confine ourselves to those fundamental verities of
the Christian faith which are so clearly stated in her articles and homilies.”
The second attempt to give to Methodism a religious Journal was made
by the Rev. W. B. Boyce, General Superintendent of Missions from 1846 to
1855. As Mr. Boyce was practically his own master his efforts were not sup-
pressed as were those of his predecessors. An omniverous reader, and a
man of wide culture, it was natural that he should seek to open the doors of
learning by the circulation of good literature. The method chosen was that
adopted by Wesley in his Christian Library. In a weekly paper of twelve
pages, which Mr. Boyce named The Gleaner, first issued August 7th, 1847, he
presented his readers with those gems of literature which his extensive reading
and magnificent library placed within his reach. The entire responsibility
appears to have devolved upon Mr. Boyce, who selected and edited the matter.
The printer was Mr. Robert Barr, of 124 York Street, and the price at first was
one penny per copy, and afterwards twopence. The nature of this publication
will be seen from the preface to the first volume, in which the Editor says:
“In concluding the first volume of The Gleaner, the Editor congratulates his
subscribers on the variety and excellence of the literary material of which it is
composed. He can do this the more readily, as this volume contains but little
original matter, being chiefly compiled from the first English authors. The
succeeding numbers will contain fewer extracts and more original comments ;
the Editor, in this respect, yielding to the wishes of the readers. He cannot,
therefore, speak with the same confidence of the future, as of the present,
volume. But of one thing his subscribers may be assured, that nothing will be


knowingly inserted which is calculated to grieve any of the professed followers
ot Jesus. He desires to keep in mind the saying of the great Melancthon •‘ In
essentials, unity, in things indifferent, forbearance, in all things, Love.’ ”
The Editor did nothing in the way of introducing himself to the public,
not even writing a leader, preferring, as he says, to let others speak. The
nature of this valuable little publication may be gathered from a glance at the
index to the first volume. Considerable space is given to Colonial, English, and
oreign news, embracing those subjects uppermost in the public mind at the
date of writing. This, of course, covers a wide field, and includes the subjects
of Emigration, Exploration, New Settlements, Mineral Discoveries, and Squat-
ting Interests. There are also “Extracts from English authors,” Bacon,
Hooker, Chalmers, Edwards, Milman, and McCheyne being amongst the num-
ber. Richard Knill’s amusing sketch, “A Great Farce, or Praying the Pope’s
Soul out of Purgatory,” finds a place, a sentence from which will serve as a
sample of all. “ The system of Popery would not have been complete without
a purgatory , but how, from the figment of Apostolic Succession to the last act
of praying the soul out of a little hell, it keeps salvation entirely in the pockets
of the priests. It is a kind of turnpike gate system, and the gate-keeper must
be paid. ‘No Trust ’is written over the baptismal font, on the confessional, on
the purgatory, and even on the gate of Heaven. O how devoutly we should
pray, From such delusions good Lord deliver us.’ ” Narratives from Grant
Thorburn, D'Aubignes Reformation , Settlers and Convicts , and the Roman
War in Judea occupy several columns, while the remaining part is given to-
Poetry, Science, and Religious Intelligence of all the denominations, even includ-
ing the Roman Catholic Mission to New Guinea, where two priests and one
lay brother had been eaten by the natives, the other priests seeking safety in
flight to a spot where the natives showed their appreciation m a less demonstra-
tive fashion.
One incident recorded will show Mr. Boyce’s attitude towards Puseyism,
which was then seeking that congenial soil it has since so successfully monopo-
lised. The child of Mr. and Mrs. Best, of Dural, was publicly baptised by the
Wesleyan Minister, the Rev. Mr. Adams. The child s godmother, who did not
approve of this baptism, took the child to the Anglican Clergyman for baptism
without the parents consent and against their wish. After ascertaining how Mr.
Adams administered the ordinance and as to whether the water had been
poured upon the child and so forth, he declared that “ the Wesleyan Baptism
was of no use,” and baptised the child in the absence of the mother, notwith-
standing the fact that Mr. Adams had assured him of the previous baptism.
The action evidently aroused Mr. Boyce, for he thus writes: “The individual
in question would never have hazarded a breach of his own ecclesiastical law.
as expounded by high authorities, and, among others, by his own Bishop, had
he not been lifted up above measure by the preposterous notion that he alone ,
as the only successor of the Apostles in that locality, had the right to adminis-
ter Christian ordinances. Plere is an instance in which the Bishop of Aus-
tralia, by the imposition of his hands, transformed at once a harmless and
respectable attorney’s clerk into a somewhat injudicious Minister of the Church

<of England ; and then sends this article of his own manufacture, bearing his
image and superscription, and obtaining currency by his stamp, to be the
channel through which all the benefits of Puseyiie Church of Englandism are
to be communicated to the people of Castle Hill and Dural. If his fellow-
Clergymen are satisfied with their colleague—-if his congregation delight in his
ministry —we have no objection to his ecclesiastical status; but if, on the
strength of this factitious position, he will trespass on the conventional pro-
prieties and decencies which public opinion requires Christian Churches and
Ministers to observe in their conduct towards each other, then—if he court the
pillory he shall have it. ‘ Those that glory in their shame (says Foster) should,
like other distinguished personages, pay a tax for being eminent.’ ”
In concluding his first issue Mr. Boyce gives the wholesale price of current
articles of produce, which may be inserted as an index to the state of the mar-
ket in 1847. Wheat was selling at 4s. 6d. per bushel, oats 55., maize is. /d.,
English barley 35., hay (per ton) £y 10s., straw £2 ios., best flour Al3, fresh
butter is. 2d. per lb., cheese 4d., tea £\ 10s. per chest, raw sugar T24 per ton,
molasses £l2, tallow A3l, beef (per carcase) per lb., mutton pork qd.
per lb., tobacco 6d. to is., and soap £1 3s. per cwt. The Gleaner had not a long
life, though it was a useful one. It was discontinued in 1848, and the Church
was again without an official organ. The cause of its discontinuance was
found in the Editor’s words at the close of the second volume; “ The Gleaner
was not established for profit, and must of necessity mean some pecuniary loss
to its proprietors, but this loss ought not to be increased by the carelessness, or
worse than carelessness, of some who profess to feel an interest in the under-
taking. The agents are requested to send their orders for the next quarter
immediately to the office, as none of the new series will be sent, except where
expressly ordered.” At the end of the second year, The Gleaner was incor-
porated with the Christian Standard , the first number of which was to appear on
the first of fuly 1848, and for the publication of which “ an entirely new fount of
type ” was cast expressly, “ an additional recommendation to the subscribers.”
The next journalistic venture launched on the stormy sea of literature
was The Christian Advocate and Wesleyan Record ; and if an enthusiastic
■send-off were a happy augury then success was assured. But the winds sweep-
ing this sea are sometimes contrary, the currents are often strong and adverse,
the quicksands are numerous, while the shores are lined with wreckage of
those gallant Argos which optimistic inexperience has ventured to send forth.
The master hands that made their impress upon the foundation work of the Sus-
tentation and Extension Society are apparent here. And to William Hessel
.and William Quick must be awarded the honour of giving to Methodism in
New South Wales a Journal worthy of the Church of which they were such
‘conspicuous ornaments.
The first step in this direction was taken at the District Meeting of 1857,
when it was resolved “ that a sheet of religious intelligence be published monthly
under the direction of the Book Committee, and that William Hessel and William
A. Quick be requested to act as Editors.” The members of the Book Commit-
tee were the Revs. John Eggleston, William Hessel, Joseph Oram, William A.


Quick, Stephen Rabone, and Messrs. Barker, Moulding, Dawson, and Moore.
The Committee immediately set to work to produce this “ sheet of religious
intelligence,” as they modestly termed it ; and on June 21st, 1858, just seven
months from the time of their decision, they issued the first number of their
religious sheet.” The “ sheet ” had multiplied into fourteen pages of reading
matter and four pages of advertisements. The price was sixpence per copy,
the printer was D. L. Welch, Atlas Office, and the title page bore the words:
The wisdom that is from above is first pure, then peaceable.” The first issue
contained three lengthy Leaders entitled “ To Our Readers,” “ The Wesleyan
Methodist Book Depot,” and “ Legislative Infringement of the Sabbath Day”;
articles on “ Methodism Beyond the Blue Mountains,” by Rev. Joseph Oram ;
Immigrants Counselled,” by Pastor; “ Port Macquarie Methodism,” by a
Local Preacher; and numerous extracts covering such ground as “ A Glance at
Public Occurrences,” “ Our Schools,” “Nebuchadnezzar’s Dream,” “ De Mora”
Information about India from the London Quarterly Review, Reviews of
Books, including the “ Life of Benjamin Carvosso,” the “ Life of Adam Clarke,”'
and the Juvenile Scripture Pearl Society,” by W. G. Haigh, Sydney. Among
the Biographical Sketches were notices of Mrs. Shaddock, mother of the Rev.
W. A. Quick, written by himself; Mr. Hessel contributed a notice of Eliza Hes-
sel, his sister, remarkable for piety and poetical genius, a sample of which is
given in the same issue, and the Editors made brief reference to the death of
Miss Emily Greaves at North Shore, and the Rev. William Crawford, who died
in Fiji after an illness of five weeks. Revival intelligence in England, Ireland,
and America have prominence, and the contents of the first issue were such
as to command the respect and support of the Church.
In making their bow to the public the Editors modestly said: “We are not
experienced journalists, and therefore cannot be expected to be proficient in
the etiquette and art of journalism ; but we are conscious of an earnest devotion
to our duty, and an anxiety to perform it with skill and integrity. We hope this
will secure us the confidence and sympathy of our readers, and shield us from a
severe hyper-criticism.” Vain hope and innocent men to think that the Editors,
of religious papers, particularly when those papers are controlled by a Con-
ference will be saved from criticism and overwhelmed with the confidence and
sympathy of a confiding public. To take away the inalienable right of
criticism would be to deprive the captious of the supreme pleasure they derive
from their annual attack upon the hapless Editor. “We have not undertaken
our arduous and responsible duties with the hope of any reward except the
gratitude of those who may be benefited by our labours.” Again vain hope !
Gratitude the reward, indeed ! “ We venture to say that we hope our Journal
may be thought worthy of preservation. We shall labour to make it so, and we
ask our readers not to treat it as a common newspaper. . . . We hope it
will contain little that is ephemeral, and much that is of abiding interest.
We hope our washes and purposes are sufficiently apparent, and that they are
such as may commend us and our labours to the confidence and sympathy of our
readers.” They should have done so certainly, for the Editors did nobly, but
they toiled for an unappreciative public. “We cannot float any false colours,”'

GRANT THORBURN’S ARRIVAL AT NEW YORK.
On the 16th of June, 1794,* about ten o’clock, a.m,, our ship came to
anchor opposite the city. In a few minutes the vessel was surrounded
with boats, and I believe every passenger went on shore but myself ; I
felt a sort of presentiment that I was about entering on new, important
and untried scenes. Many of our countrymen came on board inquir-
ing for friends or news; for in those days a ship arriving with passen-
gers teas a rare sight., I asked an Edinburgh man who came on board,
and who had been in New York above a year, if he thought my brother
and I could get employment to make nails ; he said he thought not, as
they had just got a machine set up for cutting nails out of iron hoops.
This was a piece of discouraging news, and made me less anxious about
going on shore, especially as all the money we had between my brother
and I was 6i cents j and this was given us by a passenger (who by this
time had returned on board,) after exchanging a guinea, and was what
we charged him for half a pint of wine—we gave him for one of his
children that was sick ; and there was no wine in the ship, they having
drank all up except what my brother and I had at the time. We Lad
been eight weeks out. I will here jtpispk, that one bottle, scarcely
containing a quart, was all we took on board ; and .yet wc htd the last
wine in the ship. About eleven o’clock the captain returned on board,
bringing a piece of fine fresh beef and some new potatoes, which he told
the cook to get ready for the sailorsf dinner; and seeing mo look very
sober, and finding I had not been ashore, told me to Join In the mess,
and not be discouraged ; “ for,” added he, “ if there is a man on hoard
to i0ke a figure and a fortune, you are the man.” With something of
a lighter heart, I went about as usual to assist the cook (he was a
black man) in getting ready the dinner, being anxious to taste fresh
meat; he and I sat down flat on the deck, his feet against my feet, and
a wooden bow] of potatoes between our legs, and began to scrape off
the akin from the potatoes. While thus employed, a bout,came along-
side ; in the boat was Dr. Kemp, one of the professor* of Columbia
College ; James Anderson of Broadway ; &z$ George Cleismd, hardware-
r merchant, of Maiden Lane. * When they camo on deck, the first in
quifed for a fanner’s servant ; the aeoond for a servant-woman» Wld C.

they proceed. “We take our stand on the citadel of Christian truth and rear
the standard of the Cross, and appeal to the lovers of truth and righteousness
for support. We cannot smile upon error, or wink at sin, and therefore do not
expect that we shall never be assailed by foes. We doubtless shall have battles-
to fight, and in the name of God we intend to maintain our ground and be vie-
torious.” These are the words of brave men, and not the boast of idle fellows;
As long as the public supported and supplied them with the sinews of war
they did maintain their ground. Error was unflinchingly, and with great per-
sistence, exposed, and the Romish Church had no more consistent exponent of


its errors and abominations than The Advocate. This may account in some
measure for the aversion with which Romanists regard Methodism. May the
Methodist Church never forfeit this aversion so long as it is incurred for this
and no other reason.
At the dawn of the new year the Editors told their subscribers that “ we
have been forming resolutions and plans to promote, if possible, their interests
and enjoyment. . . . This Journal has met with so much public favour and
support during the seven months of its existence, that the Book Committee
think themselves both justified and called upon to issue it every alternate week,
instead of once a month.”—(Vol. 1., p. 99.) They were moved to this step by
the following considerations: —The present and prospective circumstances of the
Church required more frequent means of communication with the people ; the
withdrawal of State aid placed upon the people increased responsibilities which
they could only be made to realise by the circulation of information and the
development of self reliance ; and finally to bring the paper within the pro-
visions of the postal law to secure its free transmission. At the close of the
year success still attended their efforts, for on December Bth the Editors wrote :
“ The establishment of this Journal was regarded by many as a doubtful specu-
lation . . and we believe that few anticipated its success and continued
existence. It will therefore be gratifying for its friends and well-wishers to
learn . . . that it is prosperous, approved, and a permanent institution of
the Wesleyan Church in this Colony.” The Ministers had adopted prospective
arrangements for its conduct with even greater efficiency. These arrangements
provided for the appointment of Mr. Elessel as Book Steward, where he would
find some “leisure for those literary labours which are necessary to render
this periodical more worthy of the Church to which it belongs.” In the last
number of volume I. the Editor said that the circulation had “ recently increased
more rapidly than usual.”
In May, 1861, the Editors begin to tell a different tale. Their ship had
drifted on to the sands. The circulation was not as extensive as the}' hoped it
would be ; “ the list of subscriptions owing is a frightfully long one ; some have
not paid from the beginning,” and if something were not done, “ and done soon,
The Advocate will die, whoever may regret it.” Five months later an appeal
was made for help, and in response to a request from some well-wisher, a state-
ment of the financial position was given. At the end of April, 1861, The
Advocate was indebted to the amount of A 250, which had been borrowed for
publication, and A3OO were owing as unpaid subscriptions. The expenses of
publication for the year were A 560, the number of subscribers 888, and the
income £525, leaving a balance against the paper of A 35 for the year. Several
donations were now received to help tide over the difficulty. In November
of the same year, the Editor turned his Leader into a homily, which he divided
into the orthodox divisions: The Advocate ; the circulation of The Advocate ;
and the desirability of securing a larger circulation of The Advocate. From
this text he preached an able sermon, in which he enforced the self-evident
truth: that if the Methodists of New South Wales wanted their religious paper
they must be prepared to pay for it.


This sermon evidently took effect, for during the sessions of the District
Meeting, a meeting for “ social intercourse and mutual greetings ” was held in
York Street school-rooms, when there were between four and five hundred
people present. After tea the President announced Hymn 711, and the Rev,
John Watsford engaged in prayer. The Chairman, Mr. Alexander McArthur,
M.L.C., set forth the aims of the promoters of the gathering. In addition to its
social character it was organised to afford an opportunity to bring into promin-
ence the affairs of the Book Room and The Advocate. Having outlined the
initial difficulties involved in these two ventures Mr. McArthur said he would
give a few hints as texts upon which the speakers could enlarge. 7he Advocate
should be taken (1) by the head of every family; (2) by every Sabbath School
Library; (3) by every Minister, Local Preacher, and Leader; (4) Ministers
should recommend it to their country congregations ; (5) a suitable agent should
be appointed in each town ; (6) it could be sent to friends at a distance as a
valuable remembrance ; (7) it was desirable that twenty persons should engage
to procure ten subscribers each ; (8) and, most important of all, subscriptions
should be paid in advance. The Preachers then spoke to the text given by the
Chairman, the President leading the way. He would feel much grieved to give
up the paper, but unless they did something there would be neither capital nor
credit, he said. But at the suggestion of such a calamity the audience cried out
“No, No/' The Revs. James Watkin (Senior Editor), Samuel Wilkinson,
William Clarke, William Kelynack, and Mr. Caldwell, M.L.A., also spoke, Mr.
Kelynack (one of the Editors) making a most eloquent appeal. “ When a while
ago,” he said in his peroration, “ war-clouds lowered on the horizon and the
storm of a threatened invasion seemed to be gathering over the shores of the
Fatherland; when bristling with steel and holding the thunder, France looked
ominously across the wave to England’s cliffs —then it was that the Empress
of the Seas woke up from the dream of security into which she had been lulled,
and prepared for the danger that her supineness had invited, and then roused
by the clarion call that echoed o’er the land ten thousand times ten thousand
hearts vowed to defend her or to die, and the existence of the means of defence
•averted the probability of invasion. So should it be with ourselves. Alter
alluding to the part which it might play in the common war between truth and
error, he concluded by saying, “ something has been said to-night, Sir, about taking
the pledge. With your permission I will give the pledge to this Meeting. 1 hat
pledge is The Advocate for Methodism and Methodists for the ADVOCATE."
But will the reader believe what follows? Notwithstanding this fine meet-
ing and the enthusiasm kindled The Advocate existed long enough to appear
before the public in three more issues, and then it died an unnatural death on
December 19th, 1861, aged 3J years. It was starved through want of nourish-
ment. But just as the highest type of life has its resurrection to an existence
more glorious than at first enjoyed, so The Advocate came to life again, its second
birth being Thursday, April 7th, 1864. The Revs. George Hurst and William
Curnow were now the Editors, and in their leading article they said“ We are
fully persuaded that our readers will rejoice that The Advocate is levived, and
that they will give it that hearty welcome with which they are accustomed to

greet an old friend. 1 hey will find that it wears the same honest face, that it
speaks with the same distinct and manly voice, and that its principles and
character have suffered no deterioration. For our own part, we hope that its
renewed life will be healthy, vigorous, and permanent; that it will run a long
course of usefulness ; and that from year to year it will become better adapted
to accomplish the religious and philanthropic purposes at which it aims.” Of
its attitude to Romanism they said:—“ The Advocate will be thoroughly Pro-
testant in its principles, firmly and boldly upholding the great doctrines of the
Reformation, and supporting its spiritual and scriptural modes of worship. With
the doctrinal errors and superstitious practices of the Church of Rome it will
make no truce whatever; on these questions it will neither be silent, nor give
an uncertain sound ; but whenever the interests of truth and spiritual religion
shall require, it will faithfully expose error and fearlessly denounce supersti-
tion.”
The year 1865 opened auspiciously. “In entering upon the second year
of our journalistic labour,” said the Editors, William Curnow and William Kely-
nack, “ we feel ourselves to be surrounded with encouragements that look forth
upon us with pleasant aspect, and that beckon us onward with kindly tones.
The success which has attended the The Christian Advocate during the past
twelve months, is an augury that may well incite to renewed and yet more
vigorous labours. We write under the inspiration of pleasant retrospections
and auspicious forecasts. We are not burdened and bound by the fetter of
financial difficulty. We are not chilled by the indifference of an unsympa-
thetic public. We are not poor in topics, the discussion of which may well
tax the largest ability, and the most persuasive eloquence. And with all can-
dour we confess that the work which lies before us is one to which we have
pledged, in no narrow* spirit, and with no grudging hand, our love and labour.
. . It ( The Advocate) is the mirror wfliich reflects Antipodean
Methodistic sentiments and life and powder. That it should do this with the
utmost effectiveness, and prove itself the epitome of our enterprise, difficulty
and success, must be the desire, and should be the aim of every Methodist
heart. Valuable now*, it will be no less in the future. We cannot forget, how,
when the pioneers of our Church —some of whom yet linger among us —have
passed away, and the traditions of early toil and triumph have become as the
indistinct memories of a dream, and the cause now so promising has spread
and grown until it covers the land with its goodly shadow, that the future his-
torian of Methodism wall turn to its pages with those of kindred character, that
he may trace the spirit, the courage, the liberality, the earnestness of this early
age, and wmave therefrom that narrative wTich, perchance in other days, shall
wake a sympathetic temper, and provoke an answering zeal.”
Still all was not well, for in July, 1867, the question was earnestly dis-
cussed: “Why is The Advocate not more widely circulated?” 1c stated
that though New South Wales returned 30,000 nominal Wesleyans, only six
hundred were found subscribing to Ihe Advocate. This has always been the
difficulty: the comparatively small number of subscribers. In completing its
eleventh volume on March Ist, 1873, the Editors gave a resume of its history,


in which, in addition to the facts already stated, they said that in 1865, the
Rev. George Hurst had left Sydney for Wollongong, his place being taken by
the Rev. W. Kelynack. In conjunction with Mr. Curnow, Mr. Kelynack con-
tinued the Editorship until 1868, when Mr. Curnow removed to Goulburn, and
the Rev. J. H. Fletcher took his place. Three years later the itinerancy took
Mr. Kelynack to Goulburn, and brought Mr. Curnow back to Sydney to join
Mr. Fletcher in the editorship. This arrangement held good till 1873, when,
as the subscribers numbered 1,000, the paper was enlarged, and the Rev. George
Martin joined the editorial staff. In April, 1874, the Rev. George Woolnough,
M.A., took Mr. Fletcher’s place, and when he resigned one month later the Rev.
George Martin took sole charge. The year 1877 saw yet another change, for
the Conference directed that The Advocate should be issued weekly. To give
effect to this decision a committee of Ministers and laymen was appointed, and
the Rev. F. W. Ward became Editor-in-chief, with Mr. John Corbett as Sub-
editor and Manager. Mr. Ward resigning in 1879 the Editorship again came
into the hands of the Rev. George Martin. But all these changes, placing as
they did many able men in the Editor’s Chair, did not secure the circulation
desired, and various offers, including the awarding of a gold medal to successful
competitors, were made to the Methodist public. In 1885 Mr. Martin removed
to Goulburn, and the appointment of an Editor being left with the Book Depot
Committee the management of the paper was placed under an editorial com-
mittee of three, the Revs. George Brown, Henry Youngman, and B. J. Meek
forming the staff. Several changes in the arrangement of type were made
enabling the Editors to give additional matter. Two years later the Rev. W.
Clarke, Dr. KelynacE and B. J. Meek formed the Council with the Rev. E. J.
Rodd as Queensland representative. In 1888 the Rev. Paul Clipsham took
charge, and from then to the present time he has been associated with the paper
either as Editor or Manager for a longer period than any of his predecessors.
The Revs. J. E. Carruthers, W. H. Beale, G. Martin, A. J. Webb, Rainsford
Bavin, E. J. Rodd, and W. Woods Rutledge have been associated with him from
time to time. During Mr. Clipsham’s management several important changes
have taken place. In the year 1890 The Advocate was put under the control of
a separate committee composed of eleven Ministers and the same number of
laymen. The same year it was proposed to form the paper into a Proprietary,
but this, unfortunately, was not entertained. The following year (1891) the
old name passed out of sight, being superseded by that of The Methodist ,
which the paper appropriately retains to-day.
The chronic impecuniosity of The Methodist led Mr. Clipsham to seek its
cause, and he became convinced that the only remedy was the establishment
of a Connexional Printing and Publishing House. For a time the Conference
did not see eye to eye with the Editor, and it was not till the year 1893 that Mr.
Clipsham obtained permission to start a Printing Establishment. There were
many preliminary difficulties, and the fact that the Conference gave no finan-
cial assistance, coupled with the financial crash that occurred throughout Aus-
tralia at that period necessitated the establishment being started on credit. A
small plant was bought for T3OO, and a beginning was made in a small way in

THE REV. PAUL CLIPSHAM.
Editor of “The Methodist ”
Clarence Street. Mr. Clipsham was appointed Manager, and the new venture
was called the Epworth Printing and Publishing House. It was soon apparent
that this enterprise was destined to succeed, for it rapidly acquired a reputation
for high-class work, and was able in course of time to devote large sums of
money to the assistance of 7he Methodist , which, without this timely help, must
have found the struggle for life too great. From the time of its inauguration to
the present, in spite of the trying years experienced by the printing and pub-
lishing trades, the progress of the Connexional office has been without a check.
It now possesses an up-to-date plant, and financially is in a most enviable posi-
tion. It has already done a great deal for the Church, and is destined to play a
still greater part in the future. In 1898 the Conference constituted it a Depart-
ment under the control of Mr. Clipsham, whose wise and watchful management
has brought about this satisfactory position. It is anticipated that ere long the
Publishing blouse will produce a great change in the style and matter of The
Methodist , devoting part of its profits to the improvement of the paper, and
assisting the cause of literature in other ways. Meanwhile The Methodist and
the Publishing House appeal for the loyal support of the people called
Methodists.
Glad Tidings, the organ of the Methodist Holiness Association, is a penny
monthly publication in four pages, devoted entirely to recording and “ spreading
the good news of free salvation.” It was first issued in 1886, and has continu-


ously been under the Editorship of the Rev. Matthew Maddern, whose contri-
butions and choice of subjects have rendered the paper successful, helpful, and
popular. It circulates extensively throughout Australasia. The Missionary
Review is under the management of the Mission Office, and is given up to the
dissemination of information bearing on Foreign Mission work. Its area of
•circulation extends throughout Polynesia. It was first issued in 1893, and is
published monthly. Subscribers of 10s. and upwards to the Mission Funds
are entitled to receive it free ; non-subscribers are charged one penny per copy.
Several Circuits also issue either Quarterly or Monthly papers, in which par-
ticulars of Circuit work are made known ; and Methodism generally in New
South Wales makes good use of the Press. But up to the present, the Church
in this State has failed to produce an author of repute. The Rev. W. B. Boyce
published two valuable volumes, “ The Higher Criticism ” and “ An Introduction
to the Study of History,” but he can in no sense be regarded as a production of
Australian Methodism, though so intimately associated with it. That the Rev.
Joseph Fletcher could have published something great on Theology is beyond
doubt, and that he contemplated some such step is probable, having most care-
fully prepared manuscript lectures on Theology for the Students while Theo-
logical Tutor. His frequent contributions to The Advocate while one of its
Editors evidence the possession of a gifted and brilliant style; while
his public addresses arq classic masterpieces. 1 The Rev. W. Vander-
kiste’s “Not- Lost but Hone--Before,” the Rev. John Watsford’s “ Glorious
Gospel Triumphs,” the Rev. G. W. Payne’s (“Tom Blue Gum”) Australian
Sketches, and the Rev. James Green’s book on the South African war, com-
prise the list of publications. But if there is paucity of authors, there has been
a superfluity of editors, several of the editors of the leading daily papers having
graduated while contributing to The Advocate?
The Missionaries were soon impressed with the fact that if they were to
-counteract the evil influences around them, they must possess their own Book
Room for the sale of Methodist publications. Hitherto they had been regu-
larly supplied with literature for sale and free distribution by the English Book
Steward. The Superintendent of the Sydney Circuit had taken charge of
these supplies, but as the Mission developed, the Rev. W. Schofield, who was
then living in Sydney as a Supernumerary without charge upon the funds, was
appointed to take oversight of this department. In 1852 he became Book
Steward, the District Meeting appointing the Sydney Preachers as a Book
Committee to meet the Stewards quarterly. The lines along which the busi-
ness should proceed were laid down, and all Sunday School Committees were
commanded to purchase their supplies through the Missionaries. At the Dis-
trict Meeting of 1854 the Missionaries discussed the advisability of founding a

Mr. J. J. Fletcher, for which there was small demand, the fault lying entirely with
the publisher. Every preacher should secure this book.
2 The first editor of The, Sydney Morning Herald was the Rev. Ralph Mansfield, and
the Rev. William Curnow filled the same office for many years. The Rev. F. W. Ward
became Editor of the Sydney Daily Telegraph, the Rev. G. Woolnough, M.A., edited
The Brisbane Courier, the Rev. John Osborne went to The Star, and the Rev. Frank
Firth is now religious Editor on The Town and Country Journal and Evening News.


Book Depot. “As it is exceedingly desirable,” they said, “to secure a central
position for the Book Depot, on the recommendation of the Brethren, Mr.
Schofield agrees to take the York Street House for one year at a rental of
£l2O. In consideration of the increased expense-incurred by the Depositor,
the meeting agrees that Mr. Schofield shall charge 10 per cent, upon the cata-
logue price on all retail sales effected in Sydney: upon books sent to the
Brethren in the country Circuits, or ordered by them through him from Eng-
land, he shall allow a discount of 2\ per cent. ; and the Brethren in the country
shall charge the books 15 per cent, upon the catalogue price.” This arrange-
ment apparently continued till 1857, for at the District Meeting of that year the
following report of a sub-committee was recommended to the Conference.
“ 1. That suitable premises be rented as a store and shop for the purpose of
the Book Depot for the New South Wales District. 2. That the Depot be
under the management of a mixed Committee, composed of the Chairman of
the District and eight others, four of whom shall be laymen, who shall engage
the necessary agents and present an annual report and balance-sheet to the
District Committee. 3. That a percentage be charged upon the published prices
of the books sufficient to cover the working expenses. 4. That the follow-
ing Ministers and gentlemen be the Book Committee: —The Chairman of the
District, the Superintendents of the three Sydney and Newtown Circuits, with
Messrs. Barker, Houlding, Dawson, and Moore.”
This, then, was the commencement of the present Book Room ; though the
Rev. John Mason, the English Book Steward, had been sending forward sup-
plies of hymn books, magazines, and other literature, which were stored in
Princes Street parsonage and regarded as Mr. Mason’s stock. At the fourth
Annual Conference held in Hobart Town, January, 1858, “the Conference hav-
ing seriously considered the recommendation of the several Districts on our
Book Affairs ” the following resolution was adopted:—“ That the establish-
ment of a Centra] Book Depot for this Connexion is, at present, impracticable ;
but that it is most important to promote in each District, by the formation of
Depots or otherwise, such arrangements as shall lead to the more general cir-
culation of Wesleyan literature amongst the members of our congregations and
the children of our schools.” In pursuance of this expression of opinion a few
gentlemen, nominated as the Book Committee, met in the Centenary Chapel,
York Street, on the 4th May, 1858, to see if anything further could be done.
The members present were the Revs. S. Rabone, S. Ironside, W. A. Quick, W.
Hessel, and Messrs. Barker and J. Dawson. A sub-committee was appointed
to ascertain if the present and prospective stock of books was sufficient to fur-
nish a shop, and if so, to make enquiries about suitable premises. This com-
mittee was also authorised to send an order to the Rev. John Mason by the
next mail, to ascertain on what terms he would dispose of the stock in hand,
and how he would deal with the Committee in future transactions if a capital
were raised. Mr. Mason’s answer was favourable, though no capital appears to
have been forthcoming. Premises were taken at the corner of King and
Castlereagh Streets at an annual rental of Tl5O, a Depository was engaged,
and a large order was sent to Mr. Mason.

THE REV. FRANK FIRTH.
This decision was made known to the public through the columns of
The Christian Advocate. “It is a source of no small gratification to us,” it
said, “that we are able, in the first number of this Journal, to chronicle the
opening of a public Depot for the sale of Wesleyan and other religious litera-
ture in this city. This establishment commenced on the fifth of the present
month (June, 1858), and is now in vigorous operation. We regard this as an
important event in this history of Methodism in this Colony. It is both
significant and full of promise. . . . We have devoted some attention to
the subject, and heartily concur in the decision of the Committee. This deci-
sion is significant of two facts ; first, that Wesleyan Methodism has a some-
what extensive literature, and secondly, that the demand for it in this Colony
is very considerable. Otherwise, the establishment of a Wesleyan Methodist
Book Depot, necessarily involving heavy expenditure, would have been both
an impertinence and a ruinous folly. We are fully persuaded that the Com-
mittee have not made these calculations without sufficient data, and are quite
confident as to the successful issue of their plans. ... Its object is especi-
ally the diffusion of Wesleyan literature throughout the Colony. Its opera-
tions, however, will not be confined to Methodist books, but will extend to
many other religious and moral works. It has not been established for the
purpose of gain, but of usefulness, and, therefore, the prices are fixed as low as
the working expenses will admit. We heartily congratulate the Committee
and their friends on their successful commencement. The premises they have
selected are most respectable, centrally situated, and otherwise admirably


adapted for the purpose. The stock of books, though not possessing such
ample variety as it will do in a short time, is extensive and elegant, and well
worthy of inspection. We earnestly commend the establishment to the atten-
tion and support of our readers.”—(Vol. 1., p. 2.)
The Book Depot was singularly fortunate in having the Rev. William
Hessel as its first Book Steward. Mr. Hessel was indefatigable in his labours
for the Church. He was the Methodist statesman of that day, and one the
Church could ill afford to lose. Believing that the Methodist Church was the
great enemy of Satan and the active opponent of the Romish Church, he sought
to fit her for the successful discharge of the work which lay before her. And
he therefore advocated most strenuously, even if he did not first propose the
foundation of the Sustentation and Extension Societv, the establishment of
•r 7
the Book Room, and the production of The Christian Advocate. He was also
a most pronounced opponent of State Aid, which was, he said, “ a great evil.”
His health having failed, he was ordered to England, but he did not leave till
the Methodists of Sydney had given expression to their regard by presenting
him with an illuminated address and a purse of Mr. Hessel was suc-
ceeded in the Stewardship by the Rev. Stephen Rabone, the worthy successor
of a worthy man.
The pressure of obligations was soon seriously felt. The rental was too
high, the stock was unsaleable, and the method of conducting the business not
likely to command success. Other premises were sought, and in December,
1861, one of the small shops in the George Street Markets was taken; a loan
of £lOO was secured from a few friends with which to purchase a supply of
suitable books from America; generous treatment was received from the new
Book Steward in London, the Rev. Dr. Jobson, who visited Australia as the
Conference deputation; Mr. John Corbett was appointed Manager in 1863, and
with a revolutionised system of business under the wise and firm administra-
tion of the Rev. S. Rabone, the financial clouds began to clear away, " appre-
hension gave place to confidence,” and a new era was entered upon in which
profit was from year to year declared, says Mr. Corbett. But one thing Mr.
Corbett does not add, and with pleasure we supply the omission. It is not
too much to say that Mr. Corbett has made the Depot what it is. His keen
business instincts, his self abnegation, his laborious toil combined with never-
failing courtesy have cleared away the financial clouds above referred to, mak-
ing the Book Depot a valuable agency and his own name a household word.
At the end of its first ten years of life The Christian Advocate said: “ Our
Book Depot has survived all the ailments and risks of its childhood, has cut
all its teeth, stands sturdily on its legs, and is now nearly ten years old.
The last report . . . shows a steady increase of sales during the year,
and warrants the conclusion that this is one of the most useful, and at the same
time, the most economical, institutions belonging to Methodism. Its working
expenses could scarcely be less, seeing that the services of the Rev. Stephen
Rabone, to whom the Depot owes so much, are entirely gratuitous . . . the
prices of the books are lower than almost anywhere else in the city. And they
might be cheaper if every buyer would pay for what he buys. We hear that

THE REV. GEORGE MARTIN.
President, 1882,
there are several hundred pounds locked up in overdue accounts. It is not too
late for such sinners to repent, only remembering that repentance in this case
means a remittance. Milton speaks of 1 iron tears.’ The Book Stew’ard, how-
ever, will prefer those which are of gold, or its equivalent. . . . We trust
that whoever lives to write an article on the second ten years’ work of the
Depot may be able to say that it stands on ground belonging to the Methodist
people, a monument of their wise liberality, and a convenient meeting point for
all the Methodist Committees and business matters in the city.”—(Sept. sth,
1868.)
The shop in the Markets becoming too small, a central position in King
Street was secured where the business continued to thrive. In 1872 the Rev.
Stephen Rabone, who for eleven years had given the most assiduous care to its
affairs, was suddenly removed by death. He was succeeded by the Rev. George
Hurst, who in the year 1879 gave place to the Rev. Frank Firth. Again the
business was removed to larger premises in George Street, where it flourished
till the year 1885, when a lease having been bought in the same street, another
move became necessary ; and for the next six years the business added to its
capital in a satisfactory degree.
The Rev. William Clarke became Book Steward in the year 1890, and
again the Depot reached an eventful stage in its history. For many years the
Committee had desired to secure a permanent home in some approved com-
mercial centre. Various properties had been placed under offer, but none

were thought sufficiently eligible until the present premises were available.
Inspection, followed by much thought and discussion, led to purchase. And
at the cost of £IB,OOO, to which must be added the sum of £1,900 for alterations
and fittings, the premises passed into the possession of the Methodist Church ;
and for the first time since its inauguration in 1858 the Book Depot found a
home. Standing directly opposite the Strand in George Street, its position is
incomparable. The business was transferred to this spot in January, 1891,
where it has since continued to prosper. The debt on the building now stands
at £5,000, and as soon as this can be extinguished its capabilities for assisting
the literary enterprises of the Church will be largely increased.
The Book Depot has reached its present satisfactory position without sub-
scribed capital, endowment, or subsidy of any kind whatever; and it depends
entirely on the trade it does. All that it asks is the loyal business support of
the Methodist public, for whose benefit it exists. “It is an Institution,” says
Mr. Corbett, “ of which our people need not be ashamed, or for which they
should offer any apology. We have reason to say that it is the envy of the
other Churches. But because of the denominational banner it carries, and the
distinctively religious character of its objects, it has limitations which ordinary
business houses need not respect. And for these reasons it asks for the trade
of the Methodist Church, and for the loyal and steadfast adherence of the
people called Methodists ; who may with honest pride point to the Rook Rooms
of Great Britain, the United States and Canada as among the greatest pub-
lishing and distributing centres in the world.” The English Book Room has
already given very valuable assistance to Connexional Funds and the literary
ventures of Methodism. And what it has done on a large scale, the Book Room
here will do on a smaller one when its debt is liquidated. This consummation,
which is not far distant, will be brought nearer still if the Methodist public
will continue to support their own Institution. There have been cases, happily
solitary ones, in which the Book Room has been set on one side in favour of
some place where a second-hand bankrupt stock has offered “ wonderful bar-
gains ” in the display of what has been labelled “ cheap,” and afterwards proved
to be “ nasty.”

THE NEW SOUTII WALES CONEEEENCE.
1593-1902.
THE last stage in the interesting development of New South Wales
Methodism has now been reached. The hive had swarmed
once more, and to Queensland the concession to establish
an independent Conference had been granted by the General
Conference. The inaugural session of the Queensland Conference
was held in the Albert Street Church on Thursday, March 2nd. The
event attracted considerable attention in the religious world of Queensland,
and there was a large attendance of spectators, including Ministers and members
of other denominations. Dr. Sellers, who was appointed to preside, and who
had been associated with Queensland Methodism in its early days, met with an
excellent reception, giving a timely, characteristic and inspiring address. The
Rev. Henry Youngman was elected to the Presidency, and the Rev. Joseph
Bowes was appointed Secretary. The collection for a Memorial Fund to
augment the existing but insufficient Loan Fund, realised the sum of £5 50.
The Brisbane Telegrafh devoted a lengthy article to the Conference, giving
also a resume of Queensland history from its inception to the present time.
The honour of being President of the first New South Wales Conference
fell to the lot of the Rev. J. E. Moulton, of whose career particulars are given
in another part of this volume. On the expiration of his term he was succeeded
by the Rev. Joseph Spence, who possessed an extensive and varied experience,
gained in Queensland and New South Wales. The Rev. J. E. Carruthers
was elected President by a very large majority in the year 1895, and his term
of office afforded additional proof of his love for the Church and his great wish
to strengthen and extend her borders. On Mr. Carruthers’ retirement, the
honour fell to the Rev. W. G. Taylor, whose year was one of success and
usefulness. Mr. Taylor’s great work, the founding of the Central Mission,
is dealt with at length in a separate chapter. In 1897, the Rev. James Wool-
nough was called to the Chair. Mr. Woolnough was well-known for the
remarkably successful way in which he had extended Methodism in the im-
portant Circuits to which he had been appointed. The Rev. E. J. Rodd
succeeded Mr. Woolnough, acquitting himself so admirably, that his praises
were in all the Churches. The Rev. John Gardiner, who succeeded Mr. Rodd,
brought to the chair an admirable record for successful Circuit administration.
The next occupant of the Chair, who proved himself in every way equal to the
demands made upon him during his year of office, was the Rev. W. H. Beale,
well known in Conference assemblies and public debates as an able legislator


and a far-sighted man. To the Rev. George Lane came the duty of presiding
over the last Wesleyan Conference of 1901, and needless to say, Mr. Lane more
than fulfilled the expectations of his warmest admirers. This was Mr. Lane’s
second call to the Chair, as he was President in 1888. He was President at an
earlier age than any of his predecessors. The honour of re-election had hitherto
fallen on two Ministers only- —the Revs. J. H. Fletcher and William Clarke.
Among the questions dealt with during this stage was the revived proposal
to establish an Affiliated College in connection with the Sydney University.
Though a Conference Committee was regularly appointed and the matter
frequently discussed, nothing practical was done to bring about a successful
issue, and Wesley College still remains on paper. The constitution of the
Leaders’ Meeting was also altered, its basis being enlarged, thus making
Leaders’ Meetings possible in every Circuit. The establishment of a Con-
nexional Fire Insurance has also received attention from time to time. Its
adoption has been earnestly advocated by several competent witnesses, but no
scheme has yet been formulated, and the matter still remains in abeyance.
The exodus of Methodist families from the city proper into the suburbs
had seriously affected the attendances at several Churches, once the centre of
vigorous life and activity. This fact became so acute, and was so frequently
considered, that the Conference of 1898 was constrained to make an attempt
to grapple with the difficulty. Mr. W. Robson moved that a Committee be
appointed for the purpose of obtaining information and to prepare a scheme
dealing with the position and prospects of the Church within the metropolitan
area. This Committee set itself earnestly to the task entrusted to it. One
proposal provoking much discussion was that submitted by the Rev. W. W.
Rutledge for the formation of all city Circuits into a Metropolitan Mission.
This scheme proposed that the whole of the evangelistic and philanthropic
agencies then in existence, and yet to be commenced should be separated from
the Central Mission and placed under the control of a General Council and a
General Superintendent. This idea, with other suggestions, was considered
by the Committee, which finally recommended the establishment of a Metro-
politan Mission and the formation' of a Committee with power to select and
purchase sites for new Churches, and in other ways to secure the development
of the Church’s interests. This scheme did not command general approval,
and the Conference rejected it. But the feeling that something more must
be done to cope with the problems of city life was deepened rather than
removed. The solution was not however found in this direction.
Meanwhile, apart from, and independent of such a scheme, the Church
was extending her borders and strengthening her hold upon the city population.
The Central Mission, notwithstanding the adverse and unreasoning criticism
to which it had been subjected in many unexpected quarters, was continuing
its beneficial work, having succeeded in gathering a regular congregation, largely
composed of non-Church goers. At Montague Street, Balmain to which, the
Rev. P. J. Stephen had been appointed, it became necessary to secure a large
Hall to accommodate the congregation gathered by Mr. Stephen every Sunday
night. On his removal to Wesley Church, Redfern, where the congregation
had been scattered through the exodus above referred to, the attendance rapidly
improved until the Church was again filled. The aggressive work thus
commenced was successfully carried on for four years by Mr. Stephen’s


successor, the Rev. Frederick Colwell, who not only added to the congregation,
but took up a great deal of philanthropic and social work which continues to-
day. Ihe Mission at Balmain is now in the charge of the Rev. W. F. Oakes. #
The Christian Endeavour Movement was now growing into such goodly
proportions, and doing such valuable work, that the Conference took official
cognisance of it. Ihe impression had gained ground that its constitution
needed some slight adaptation to bring it into line with Methodist usages and
legislation. A move was therefore made in this direction during the year 1898,
though at a previous Conference a Christian Endeavour Committee had been
appointed and its annual report was carefully considered. This Committee
suggested the establishment of a General Council for the Wesleyan Societies;
and the suggestion was submitted to the District Synods and the Endeavour
Societies for consideration. Ihe Rev. J. Woodhouse, the Secretary, presented
the scheme to the Conference and it was adopted.. The Christian Endeavour
Rally has now become one of the important meetings of the Conference. It
is always well attended, and no gathering is marked by greater enthusiasm or
more demonstrative evidences of youthful energy consecrated to the service of
Christ than this yearly gathering.
It was during this period that Australia received a visit from two specialists,
the one being the Rev. Thomas Cook, of the British Conference, well-known
as an exceptionally successful soul winner; the other was the Rev. Leonard
Isitt, of New Zealand, who had made for himself a name as a temperance
advocate. To both of these important subjects, represented by these Brethren,
the Church has given earnest thought and persistent effort, and a visit from
these visitors was therefore heartily welcomed. Mr. Cook visited the Colony
in 1894. In the many centres in which he conducted Missions, encouraging
results followed, and his methods were an object lesson to the Church. Mr.
Isitt opened his campaign in the Centenary Flail in the year 1897. His gifts
and enthusiasm made him most successful on the temperance platform. His
mission was not so much to the individual as to society at large, in which he
advocated the safe guarding of the whole line of human conduct by moral,
social, and legislative acts, and specially that part wherein danger most lies
and where temptation finds the least resistance. The Rev. Thomas Champness,
so well-known throughout the Methodist world in connection with his Joyful
News Mission, and his labours in the interests of “ the man in the smock frock,”
paid a visit to Australia in the latter part of 1898. He also visited the Islands.
One result of his tour was the appointment of a Joyful News agent to one of
the Mission Stations.
Another matter worthy of note, though it has no immediate connection
with the questions preceding it, was the celebration of the Jubilee of Methodism
in the Willoughby and Gordon Circuit in 1896, and Goulburn in 1897. The
first of these interesting events took place on the 24th May, the interest largely
* Since the Conference of 1902 with which this history closes, other developments in this
direction have taken place. At Newcastle a large Hall in every way suitable to the require-
ments has been built by the Rev. Rainsford Bavin and his Committee in the face of many
unforeseen difficulties. Now Mr. Bavin preaches to more than 1,000 people every Sunday
evening. At Bourke Street, Sydney, the Rev. M. Scott Fletcher, M.A., is filling the large
Church; while at Leichhardt, the Rev. P. J. Stephen is building a large Hall for the congrega-
tion at present worshipping in the Town Hall. A Hall for seamen, and known as “The Rawson
Hall,” situated at Miller’s Point, is about to be opened free of debt. This Hall is to be the
basis' of the work among the sailors now carried on by the Central Methodist Mission under the
superintendency of the Rev. W. C Taylor.


centring around Mr. McKeown, who also was celebrating his jubilee as a
Methodist. A public luncheon was held in Gordon Park, at which nearly five
hundred persons were present, and a Public Meeting was afterwards held,
presided over by the Hon. Jacob Garrard. The Rev. H. W. T. Pincombe, the
Superintendent, presented Mr. and Mrs. McKeown with two beautiful portraits.
Mr. McKeown having suitably replied, several interesting speeches were given,
and the proceedings terminated with a concert. The celebration of the Jubilee
at Goulburn took place on Sunday, October 31st, when the Rev. Henry Young-
man conducted appropriate services, and Mr. J. W. Wombey assisted at the
afternoon service. This was followed during the week by a tea and Sunday
School rally, when the Revs. John Gardiner, H. Youngman, Mr. Sibson, Mr.
C. W. Turner and others delivered addresses.
The Conference of 1898 appointed a Committee to prepare a scheme for
the fitting celebration of* the close of the century. The scheme
formulated was to be sent to the District Synods for consideration. The Com-
mittee stated that in recognition of the great and numerous blessings bestowed
by God upon the Church during the igth century, a fund of fifty thousand
guineas, to be designated the Century Commemoration Fund, be raised in New
South Wales. The objects aimed at in connection with the Fund were the
extinction, or the reduction of Trust debts, contributions being invited for the
following objects: local Church trust debts ; the Centenary Hall; the Colleges,
and the Parramatta Church, which it was proposed to designate the Leigh
Memorial Church in recognition of the work of the pioneer Missionary. It
was optional with subscribers to allocate their subscriptions to any of the above
objects in such proportion as they pleased. Efforts were to be made to secure
contributions from all the adherents of the Church of one guinea each. Central
Meetings were to be held in Sydney and the principal country towns, and an
Organising Secretary was to be set apart to work the Fund. The Fund was
to be initiated by special sermons throughout the Colony, preceded by a week
of special prayer in every Circuit, and a letter commending the Fund, pre-
pared by the President and the Organising Secretary, was to be read at the
Sunday services.
There were sufficient reasons why such a step should be taken in New
South Wales, for though the Methodists in this State could not undertake such
an enormous scheme as that of the Million Guinea Scheme, first suggested and
then so earnestly advocated by Mr. Perks, Rev. Hugh Price Hughes, and others
in connection with British Methodism, it was nevertheless felt that there were
strong reasons why practical expression should be given to the gratitude which
found place in the hearts of many Methodists. “ The closing century,” to
borrow the words of The Methodist , “had seen Methodism, which eighty years
ago had a few representatives in Sydney, extend and grow until its net-work
of agencies has spread over every inhabited part of Australasia; and it has
almost during the latter half of it witnessed the Christianising of that great
archipelago of Islands in the Southern Seas which formed the theatre of our
earliest enterprises and sacrifices and triumphs. The epigram employed to
embellish many a platform speech ‘ Methodism raises no monuments where
she saves no souls,’ but conversely as the stages and periods of our history are
marked by tokens of the divine favour, so they should be by memorial acts
of recognition and consecration. When God gave to Jacob the vision, Jacob
built an altar and gave to God the vow.” And proceeding, the same paper
added: “If this Commemoration effort is to attain its highest objects it must be
suffused with spiritual enthusiasm ; there must be such a realisation of the

relations in which we stand to God and to His providential and redemptive
ministries as shall inspire holy joy, devout gratitude, and a triumphant con-
fidence in the men who in God’s purpose were to succeed in bringing the
world to himself. Let Ministers, Office-bearers and congregations address
themselves to this effort, swayed by these and kindred considerations, and the
fifty thousand guineas will not be difficult of attainment, and will when attained
represent the smallest part of the gains by which the Century Commemoration
will afford us.” (October 29th, 1898.)
The Ministers and Office-bearers, Synods and Conference did indeed ad-
dress themselves to this effort, and though the Methodist Church in this Colony
had frequently shown itself capable of rising to noble acts of sacrifice from
a financial as well as from some other points of view, the Century Fund
Movement surpassed all previous efforts. When the Conference met, the Com-
mittee which had been previously appointed to prepare and then submit pro-
posals, brought its scheme before the Conference, the Rev. John Hulme, the Sec-
retary, acting as the Committee’s mouthpiece. Some of the most optimistic
wanted the amount set down at one hundred thousand guineas ; but while this
hopeful enthusiasm commanded admiration it did not secure approval, and
the amount was finally fixed at fifty thousand guineas. Dr. Brown, Foreign
Missionary Secretary, advocated the inclusion of Foreign Missions in the
scheme, and though the Rev. J. Carruthers pleaded earnestly for the inclusion
of the Parramatta Church as the Leigh Memorial, his advocacy was not suc-
cessful. When the scheme left the hands of the Conference it included local
Church Property debts, the Centenary Hall, the Colleges, and Foreign Mis-
sions. A central Committee was appointed by the Conference, and it was
resolved that in each district a Secretary, and in each Circuit a Committee,
Secretary and two Treasurers be appointed who should be responsible for
carrying out local details.
By a unanimous vote the Rev. Rainsford Bavin was appointed Organ-
ising Secretary, and a better selection could not well have been made, for
though the fifty thousand guineas were not secured, Mr. Bavin did all that
could be done, and much more than many would have done. He received
very valuable assistance from the Central Committee, and the Rev. John Hulme
and Mr. Percy Slade, the Secretaries, and the Rev. E. J. Rodd and Mr. R. J.
Lukey, the Treasurers. In thanking the Conference for his appointment, Mr.
Bavin said he could not undertake the work unless he was supported by the
fullest sympathy and confidence of the Ministers and laymen. The responsi-
bilities of the position were so great. Fie saw no reason why the scheme should
not be a splendid success throughout the Colony, being made also of great
spiritual benefit to the Church. If they were to enkindle enthusiasm throughout
the Churches they must be first enthused and consecrated and then take the
lead in the movement. He wished to invite the members of the Conference
to meet at breakfast at Mr. Quong Tart’s for fuller consideration of the scheme.
“ This breakfast,” it was afterwards said, “ must be considered as the inaugural
meeting of the Century Fund. He ventured to forecast among the blessings
gathered round the movement, the removal of a large proportion of their local
and Connexional trust debts, the revival of the old time Missionary enthusiasm
and the strengthening of the Connexional spirit among them.”
At the breakfast meeting, a gathering made possible by the kindness of a
friend, the scheme was successfully launched. The ex-President, the Rev. E.
j. Rodd, presided. Speaking of the project, Mr. Rodd said the enterprise de-
pended on two things ; first, thorough, wise, and careful organisation ; second,


faith in God. Mr. Bavin, who followed, said that a lady had already promised
£SOO, and a gentlemen £250. Ihe Rev. J. E. Carruthers then in charge of the
1 arramatta Circuit, stated that he could promise on behalf of that circuit the
sum of £I,OOO. Many other speeches followed in the same spirit, and what
must be described as an eminently successful inauguration took place.
The Committee now set to work earnestly to make arrangements for the
inaugural meetings shortly to be held. Monday, May 22nd, was the red-letter
day of the Fund. On that date morning and evening gatherings were held
in the Centenary Hall, followed by what was described as ‘‘ a mammoth tea
meeting and “ a magnificent public meeting ”in the Town Hall. On the pre-
vious Sunday in every Church throughout the Colony, the President’s letter was
read, and special sermons were preached on the subject of the commemoration.
Several leading ministers and laymen took part in the devotional meetings in
the Centenary Hall, and when the hour for the tea meeting arrived the base-
ment of the Town Hall was filled, and a thousand people were unable to gain
admission. It was estimated that four thousand sat down to tea. At half-
past seven the d own Hall was crowded by an eager and expectant audience.
At the appointed time, the chairman, the Hon. E. Vickery, M.L.C., took the
chair, having as vice-chairmen Mr. John Hardy and Mr. R. H. Ducker. The
front seats of the platform were occupied by the speakers and the members of
the Executive Committee. Inspiring and eloquent addresses were delivered
by the Organising Secretary, Mr. Bavin, and by the Revs. W. G. Taylor, George
Lane, the Chairman, and Mr. William Robson. Before the meeting closed,
Mr. Bavin was able to announce that the promises with the collections amounted
to 13,622 guineas. The tea meeting was expected to yield £l5O additional.
This amount included many personal subscriptions, while the following Circuits
pledged themselves to raise the sums namedStanmore 1,000 guineas; Bur-
wood 700 guineas; Newtown 750 guineas; Waverley 2,000 guineas; Wil-
loughby and Gordon 1,100 guineas; William Street 800 guineas; Lewisham,
Wesley Church, Bourke Street, Cleveland Street, Kiama, and Balmain Mission
500 guineas each. Several other circuits followed in the same spirit, and
though in some cases the amounts promised were not quite realised, in several
circuits they were exceeded.
This magnificent meeting was followed by others on a similar scale
throughout the country districts. Almost without exception the rank and file
of the people responded nobly. Not only did the ministers and laymen work
enthusiastically and with great hopefulness to make this fund a success, but
The Methodist Committee issued a special number, in which there were suit-
able articles by the Editor, the Revs. J. E. Carruthers, B. Banks, A. J. Webb,
W. W. Rutledge, J. Hulme, George Lane, George Martin, Joseph Beale,
James Colwell, the Hon. E. Vickery, M.L.C., Mr. James Rutledge, and Mr. W.
Robson. The fund was satisfactorily launched and arrangements were
made for demonstrations throughout the the country, both ministers and laymen
rendering valuable assistance. We cannot follow the Organising Secretary
throughout his long and arduous journeys, extending over two years, neither
can we give a record in detail of the many gatherings held in the interests of
the fund. We must dismiss this subject with the remark that one and all did
well, so that at the close of his strenuous efforts Mr. Bavin reported that 44,000
guineas out of the 50,000 aimed at had been received towards the fund. In a
leading article, headed “Hallelujah,” The Methodist said; “It is wonderful
to note how this commemoration fund has already taken hold upon the imagi-
nation and heart of our people—our people everywhere have been quick to


understand it. They already know all about it, are in hearty sympathy with
it, and are in a wonderful way expressing their sympathy in generous gifts. To
those who have had to do with the formation of this scheme, and who will feel
more or less the burden of responsibility until it has been brought to a successful
issue, the first public meeting must be highly gratifying.” But let it not be
thought that financial results were the only ones achieved or aimed at. At the
memorable inaugural meeting Mr. Bavin stated that in many churches on
the preceding Sabbath there had been wonderful manifestations of the presence
of God, and several souls had been set at liberty This was by no means con-
fined to the first Sunday, for throughout the whole of his term God wonderfully
blessed the Secretary and others in their efforts on behalf of the fund. Out of
this scheme, we may add that the Tent Mission movement successfully carried
through by the Hon. Ebenezer Vickery, M.L.C., took its rise. To him it pre-
sented the question ; Why should not the Church aim also at securing 50,000
conversions to commemorate God's goodness throughout the past century? The
relief which the fund brought to many Trusts was most helpful, and the im-
petus given to long-cherished projects in church extension was noticeable in
many cases.
Though the fine and imposing structures erected in and around Sydney
were sufficient to accommodate the worshippers for some time to come, a steady
and quiet development continued in other places. At Lewisham it was found
necessary to make additions to the Church at a cost of nearly £I,OOO, thus
providing extensive accommodation for Church and School purposes, including
school hall, infant school-room, vestry, library, and three class-rooms. The
Church was also re-seated, and special attention paid to the ventilation. The
re-opening sermons were preached by the Revs. W. Clarke, J. Gardiner, and F.
Colwell. At the Public Meeting which followed, addresses were given by the
Rev. George Lane and Messrs. R. W. Conway and W. Robson. 'Phis enlarge-
ment was largely the result of a revival which had taken place during the super-
intendency of the Rev. F. Colwell. The report of the proceedings concluded
thus; —“ With a good congregation, two hundred Church members, four
hundred on the Sunday School roll, and increased facilities for work, we thank
God and take courage.”
The new Church at Armidale, to which reference is made in a previous
chapter, was opened in 1893, the Rev. George Lane conducting the dedication
service, and the building being crowded. Ihe Rev. J. E. Carruthers preached
to large congregations on the following Sunday. At the Public Meeting on
Wednesday, Mr. E. Lonsdale presided, and Mr. Peter Dean made a financial
statement, from which it appeared that the cost of the budding was £2,134.
The Church at Burwood also received extensive additions, Mrs. and Miss Plurst
having promised to provide a pipe organ if the Church were enlarged. The
cost of these alterations was £BOO, towards which Mr. John Hardy gave £ 2OO.
The organ was a noble instrument, the City Organist pronouncing it exception-
ally good. The enlargement included an extension in length providing for
an organ chamber, chancel and vestry. Three memorial windows were placed
in the Church, two by Mrs. Hurst, and one by Mr. Hardy. “ The appearance
of the new building strikes those who knew the old one with astonishment, for
the transformation is amazing.” Special sermons and an organ recital with
special music marked the event. Mr. F. Morley displayed the splendid
qualities of the new instrument, while the President and the Rev. George Lane
conducted appropriate services. The organ bears this inscription: “ This organ
was erected to the memory of the Rev. George Hurst by his widow and
daughter.”


THE REV. FREDERICK LANGHAM, U.D.


What was described as an interesting ceremony took place on the Tweed
River in December, 1895, when a Church for the Kanakas, of whom there were
two hundred, was opened. The Church was a small building costing A4A
and accommodating seventy-five persons. It was opened free of debt. M r -
Silas Bembrick conducted the opening services. A new Church was opened at
Hornsby, January 26th, 1896, the Preachers being the Revs. G. Brown, D.D.,
and H. W. T. Pmcombe. This was followed by a Tea and Public Meeting,
at which many visitors were present, when addresses were given by the Hon. J.
Garrard, the Revs. J. E. Carruthers, President, J. Woolnough, Dr. Sellers, and
Messrs. W. H. McKeown, J. Channon, Dobson and Miners. The total cost,
including fittings and fencing, was A3,000. Another Church in this Circuit was
also opened a few months later at Lindfield, the Revs. W. G. Taylor and Dr.
Brown preaching the opening sermons. The Church and site cost As°°-
The old Church at Narrabri, which had done duty for so many years,
was now to give place to a building worthy of Methodism in such a town. The
Church was erected largely through the energy and perseverance of the Rev.
J. Watson, Circuit Minister. The President preached the opening sermons,
and the meetings comprised an “At Home,” special sermons, and a lea and
Public Meeting. The Sabbath services were very successful, several souls
being won for Christ. “ His people are quickened, the Church opened free
of debt with the exception of the amount due to the Loan Fund, and A3 O to
the good for the furnishing ; not to speak of the social fillip we have received.
Altogether the results justify fully the audacity of our request that the
President of the Conference should come 350 miles to be with us in the con-
summation of our long-cherished hopes.” The same week Church enlargement
was reported from Summer Hill in the Ashfield Circuit, where, under the super-
intendency of the Rev. J. E. Carruthers the church was considerably enlarged,
making it in keeping with the wants of such a large and popular suburb. The
opening sermons were preached by the Revs. George Lane and George Martin.
The next year, on the nth of June, 1898, the memorial stones of the
Hutchinson Memorial School Hall were laid. Towards the erection of this Hall
Mr. W. A. Hutchinson had bequeathed AlOO in addition to providing a loan of
A 240 free of interest for ten years with which to purchase the site. The
Committee had succeeded in raising a further sum of A 250. The Rev. J. Wood-
house, the Superintendent, requested Mrs. Boyce and Mrs. Hutchinson to lay
the foundation stones, the trowels and mallets used on the occasion being those
presented to Mrs. George Allen at the laying of the foundation stones at York-
street and the Glebe. Methodism took a wonderful step forward at
Cootamundra during 1899. “ Sunday, 21st May,” said The Methodist , “ will long
be remembered by the Methodists of Cootamundra. On that day the new
Church was opened and dedicated to the worship of Almighty God. . . .
The magnificent and generous way in which the people responded is worthy of
the highest commendation. The financing of the scheme has been to the
Pastor a great delight. There has been little begging done, the money has
been given voluntarily and freely. Mr. Samul Ward’s donation, first of AlOO
to start the list, then another AlOO to pay for the inside furnishing, and an
additional A5O at the opening is worthy of special note.” The entire cost
of the building, A 827, was all paid with the exception of A 76. The Rev.
Benjamin Dinning, to whose energy this erection was due, presided at the
Public Meeting, when addresses were given by the Revs. James Woolnough,
who had preached the opening sermons, C. Jones, H. Pennington, EL Llutchin-
son, and Canon Betts.


Soon after tins date the Methodists in two of the suburbs launched build-
ing schemes. At Mosman on March 7th, igoo, the foundation stone of a new
Church Hall was laid by Sir Frederick Barley, Chief Justice. The Church
was to cost A 1,000. A 1 ea and Public Meeting took place in a large marquee
elected on the grounds. Ihe Revs. E. J. Rodd, W. G. Taylor, R. Bavin, W.
VV. Rutledge, and H. C. Foreman, 8.A., who was in charge of the Circuit,
took part. “1 he day’s proceedings realised almost £SO, and the Mosman
friends confessed it the brightest, gladdest day in their history.” A few
months later, that is in August, 1901, the Rev. T. F. Potts, then in charge
of the Manly Circuit, took in hand a much needed Church extension scheme,
the out-come of which was the building of a suitable Church in a commanding
position. Ihe foundation stones of the new building were laid on March
30th by the Rev. George Fane and Messrs. E. Bayhss and R. G. Higgins.
Saturday, July the 20th, was a red letter day in the history of Manly Method-
ism, when the new Church was formally opened for the worship of God by Mrs.
E. Bayliss. The vision of eleven years ago was realised, and great was the
thankfulness and rejoicing. The Rev. J. E. Carruthers offered the dedication
prayer, and the President of the Conference delivered the dedication sermon.”
ihe total cost was £ 1,070, the kauri pine seats being the gift of Mr. E.
Bayliss and his family. During this year and the following new Churches
were erected at Botany and St. Albans, being the first Churches built since
the consummation of Methodist Union. Botany, and St. Albans on the
McDonald River, figured in connection with early Methodism. Though but
a small place, with but few Methodists, when the St. Alban’s Church was
opened by the Rev. W. G. Taylor, there was no debt remaining, though the
cost was A 405.
Among the Ministers connected with the New South Wales Conference
who died, the first in order was the Rev. William Moore, who passed away
on the 12th September, 1893, in his 73rd year. First at Moreton Bay, where
he laid the foundation of Methodism in the extensive Colony of Queensland,
and afterwards at Fiji he did faithful service for the Church of Ins choice!
For nearly 20 years he laboured for the' Fijians, doing a work that was in-
valuable. His power over Fijian audiences and his personal influence with
the Chiefs were remarkable. On returning to the Colony he laboured in
several Circuits, showing himself a true and faithful Minister of Jesus Christ.
In 1883 he was elected President of the Conference, and in 1885 he became
a. Supernumerary, spending the even-tide of life at Stanmore. He endured
much suffering with Christian patience. Among his last words was the wish,
“ I want to go home.” The Rev. G. R. Glasson, another native of the Colony,
died on the nth of July, 1894, after twenty-three years in the Ministry. He
was a man of strong constitution, buoyant temperament: warm heart, and
genial manners. He spared not himself, but often laboured beyond his
strength. His last illness was severe and brief, but he was graciously sus-
tained by the comfort and hope of the Gospel.
The following year, the Revs. R. W. Orton, J. A. Bowring, and W. R.
Carmichael were called home. Mr. Orton died at Camden on the 29th
September, 1895. He faithfully and earnestly discharged the duties of a
Minister in Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland, where he showed
himself to be a good Preacher, a diligent pastor, a prudent administrator, and
a devout Christian. His loyalty to the doctrines, principles, and polity of the
Church were very marked. Flis last illness was of a distressing nature, but
he passed away with a steadfast reliance upon the atonement of the Ford Jesus


Christ. James A. Bowring was cut down in the midst of his years. His
manly courage, perseverance, sincerity, and fervent zeal gave promise of much
power and success. For two years he was Conference Evangelist, and for
another two years had charge of the Central Mission during a critical and
changeful period of its history. For five years he was Chairman of the Tonga
District, where he rendered invaluable service. Returning to the Colony
he succumbed to an attack of inflammation of the lungs on Christmas Eve,
1895, in the town of Lithgow. Mr. Carmichael first worked in South Australia,
and then in West Australia, being accepted in the latter place as a candidate
for the Ministry. Possessing a strong desire for Mission work, he proceeded
to Fiji, where after two years’ labour he was prostrated by an acute attack
of dysentery, and died at Kadavu on April 10th. Though the native Ministers
up to the present have not been referred to, an exception must be made in
the case of the Rev. David Tonga, who also died this year. David Tonga
passed through the fierce fire of persecution during the Free Church movement,
where, notwithstanding most tempting offers, he stood by his vows and remained
loyal to the Church of his choice. This, however, did not save him from
persecution, for he was banished to Fiji. He afterwards travelled through the
Colonies to tell the tale of the persecution. Many remember with gratitude
his preaching and consistent life.
Other Ministers were called home in the year 1897, the first being the
Rev. Robert Dyson, who died at Kogarah on the 14th December. Mr. Dyson
travelled in several English Circuits until his health necessitated a change.
Coming to New South Wales he was appointed to several important Circuits.
He was a fine Preacher and a kind Pastor, being beloved by both Ministers
and people. His sun went down while it was yet day. The Rev. J. P.
Chapman died in the prime of life. In Fiji, where he laboured for eleven
years, he won the reputation of being an energetic and zealous Missionary,
never sparing himself in the performance of what he regarded as his duty.
Contracting consumption from exposure, he came to New South Wales, and
after a lingering illness died at Tamworth on New Year’s morn. Among his
last words, he said: “I am going home.” The Rev. Joseph Oram arrived in
New South Wales in 1850, subsequently travelling in the most important
Circuits in the Connexion. During his first term at Bathurst he carried out
several successful Church building enterprises, and launched the scheme for
the new Church. In 1879 he was made President of the Conference, the
duties of which he discharged with fidelity and success. Through failing
health he became a Supernumerary in 1883, making his home at Stanmore,
where he continued to serve the Church he loved so well. He was a man deeply
beloved; his gentle spirit, his earnest piety, his constancy of friendship, his
love for the Brethren, and his unswerving loyalty to the Church, combining to
make his memory precious. He died suddenly at Stanmore on the 21st
April, 1898.
In the year 1899 several other Ministers were gathered to their fathers.
The Rev. James Somerville rendered useful service for many years, having
entered the Ministry in 1848. Fie was a true pioneer, being the first Minister
stationed at Moruya, and the first to visit Bega, where he built a Church. His
name is remembered far and wide in the South Coast District. For eleven
years he had charge, as Supernumerary, of the Hawkesbury River Circuit. In
1885 he settled at Burwood, identifying himself with the newly built Church at
Enfield. He was a devout man, who truly walked with God. The Rev. T. R.
McMichael will long be remembered for his deep spirituality of mind, and for

his personal enjoyment of the higher experiences of Christian life. For many
years his work was carried on under severe physical disability, and in 1896 his
health broke down utterly. His sufferings at last were specially severe. Almost
his last message to his Brethren was a request that they should preach more
constantly the Scriptural doctrine of holiness. He died on the 14th January,
1899. Ihe Rev. Warren Henry was for several years connected with the Irish
Conference, ill-health brought him to this Colony, and in several Circuits, as
far as health permitted, he proved himself an efficient servant of God and His
Church. Proceeding to America in the hope of recovery, he died on December
10th in the house of his brother at Colorado, America. The Rev. C. W.
Graham passed away somewhat suddenly on the 22nd May, the immediate
cause of death being heart failure. Mr. Graham was brought to God during the
visit of the Rev. William Taylor, of America. After entering the Ministry he
laboured successfully in several Circuits in New South Wales and Queensland.
Appointed in 1898 to the Parkes Circuit, he contracted a chill, and died of
pneumonia. He gave whole-souled devotion to the Master’s work, and even in
his delirium he was preaching the Gospel. He had often expressed a wish that
he might die in harness, and his wish was gratified. The Rev. Arthur J. Webb
was called home in the month of August. He also was a convert of the Rev.
William Taylor, being brought forward for the Ministry by the Rev. J. Watkm,
and accepted at an early age for work in Fiji. While here his life on several
occasions was in danger. After eighteen years’ successful Mission work he
returned to New South Wales, where, in important Circuits, he gathered
large congregations around him. His work at Albert Street Church, Brisbane,
was eminently successful. His last appointment was to the Burwood Circuit,,
where he gave rich promise of usefulness. But illness came, attended with
intense pain, followed by ease, and then unconsciousness. He was an excep-
tionally fine Preacher, being a man of rare intelligence and culture. He was
cut down in the prime of life.
The Conference Minutes of 1900 report the deaths of the Revs. Samuel
Wilkinson, William Hill, W. W. Lindsay, and W. C. Hughes. Mr. Wilkinson
arrived in New South Wales in the year 1838, when New South Wales Method-
ism was represented by four Circuits and four Ministers. In 1841 he was the
first Minister stationed in Melbourne, then in its infancy. His subsequent
spheres of labour included important Circuits in New South Wales, Victoria,
and Queensland. In 1875 he was elected to the Presidential chair, and two
years later became a Supernumerary, continuing, however, to be actively en-
gaged in many good works. In 1885 he became Chaplain to the Naval and
Military Forces and the Hospitals, and his long and honourable career reached
its close on December 26th. A conspicuous feature of his Ministry was his
devotion to pastoral visitation, and his best work was done in the homes of the
people, where his name is held in loving remembrance by three generations.
His sixty years’ of service were a patient continuance in well-doing. His great
age and long career made him a uniquely interesting figure in the Church. He
was the last link in the Conference between modern Methodism and the pioneer
days. The Rev. William Hill died at Chatswood on 6th December. He
was sent by the British Conference of 1854 to South Australia, where he
laboured for four years, proceeding thence to the Friendly Islands, from whence
he retired through failure of health. In 1891 he became a Supernumerary. He
was what may be termed an old fashioned Methodist Preacher, steadfastly
adhering to the doctrine of the Church. He was a vigorous opponent of
Sabbath desecration, the liquor traffic, gambling, profanity and impurity, and
he possessed a quaintness of style peculiar to himself. The Rev. W. W.* Lind-
say was a Minister of thirty years standing, nearly all of which were spent in


t iji. He was called upon to spend many days and nights travelling by sea and
land ; but, from hardship, danger, and the fierceness of the people he never
shrank. He was at Viwa when an epidemic of measles swept away forty
thousand of the people, and when the shadow of death lay upon the land he
spent himself for the people, carrying on his Ministry, and supplying medicine
to thousands. Though gentle and gentlemanly, he could be severe when neces-
sary He loved the natives, and they in return loved him ; but those who knew
him best loved him most. His good qualities were numerous. His sudden
death caused widespread sorrow, and the influence of ins pure, high character
has been a blessing to Fiji. The Rev. W. C. Flughes fell asleep at Kogarah on
tiie 21st August, 1900. Mr. Hughes possessed a calm and intelligent trust m
the Divine Saviour, which enabled him to make progress in the Christian life.
Modest and retiring in disposition, he was loved for these qualities as well as
for his preaching. He was also a staunch and vigorous advocate in the tem-
perance cause, and a fearless exponent of Protestant principles.
Among the laymen who were called to their fathers was Mr. William J.
Hambly, who rendered acceptable service as a Local Preacher and Sunday
School Superintendent in the Mount Lachlan and Burwood Circuits. Methodism
m the West Maitland Circuit received a great blow in the sudden death of Mr.
Richard Young, who died in September, 1893. Born in West Maitland, he
commanded wide-spread respect for a life that was singularly unselfish and suc-
cessful. Always ready to give time, thought, and service to every movement
tending to the good of the community, his death was little short of a public
calamity. In the Church he occupied an important position as one of the most
responsible office bearers, being exemplary in his regular attendance at the
public service of the sanctuary. By his counsel, his influence, and his support
he was a tower of strength to the Church, of which he was a conspicuous orna-
ment. Testimonies to his high worth from all quarters were received by the
Rev. J. E. Carruthers, then in charge of the Maitland Circuit. Mr. J. B.
Medcalf, another of the early workers of Methodism, passed away during this
year. Arriving in Sydney in 1839 he identified himself with the Methodist
Clmich as Prayer Leader, Class Leader, and Local Preacher, in addition to the
position of choirmaster at Macquarie Street, York Street, and Hay Street
Churches. For upwards of twenty years he was connected more or less with the
Mount Lachlan Circuit. He went to the grave in full age, as a shock of corn
cometh in its season.
The following year another prominent figure in West Maitland was called
to his reward in the person of Mr. John Falkiner, who finished his course with
joy on the 2nd of July. He came to this Colony m 1842, and with the exception
of a few weeks had ever since been associated with Methodism in the Hunter
River District. During this long course of years he filled with credit every office
in the Church open to laymen. He was a man of rare and unwavering fidelity
to Methodism. Mr. Caleb Parker, of Molong Circuit, also passed away at this
time. As a Circuit Steward and Trustee, he was wise in council, while his
conversation and religious experience gave proof that he longed to live and
dwell in Christ. Mr. Thomas Walker, of Kempsey, born in Sydney in 1819, and
dying at the age of 76, was another pioneer. It is impossible to estimate the
services he rendered to Christ and His Church during the 56 years of his
attachment. As a Prayer and Class Leader, and finally as an acceptable Local
Preacher, his work was much appreciated. In the earlv days of Manning River
Methodism he did lasting work.


A GROUP OF FIJIAN TEACHERS.


he next year was to witness the removal of several other prominent lay-
men, including Mr. J. E. Pearce, of Hay, who arrived in the Colony in 1838, and
too up agricultural pursuits in the Hunter River District, where he took a keen
and prominent interest m church and public affairs. In 1862 he accepted the
position of Police Magistrate, removing to Lambing Flat, then in a disturbed
state. Eight years afterwards he was transferred to Play, where he died. Both
at °ung and Hay he was the pioneer of the Wesleyan Church, churches being
uilt mainly by his influence. He was a consistent Christian, a warm friend
to Home and Foreign Missions, a friend to all, and an enemy to
Ai n6 D , TT A ® hfield , Circuit suffered a severe loss in the death of
Mi. Reuben Hall, on the 27th of September. On that date he left his home
singing just as lam without one plea,” to take his seat in the train. Here he
bowed his head, and died without a pang. Arriving in Sydney, 1852, Mr. Hall
soon found ample scope for his preaching abilities. After a chequered career, he
removed to Ashfield, where he continued to show his love for the work,
materially helping forward the erection of the Church at that place. “ Mr. Hall ”
wrote the Rev. R. Caldwell, “ was no ordinary man. Stirling, true, and godly
beyond the common run of mankind, he was one of God’s own princes.” Mr.
braham Kershaw, identified with Goulburn Methodism in the early days - Mr
top fckley °f West Mr. Mitchellhill, one of the pkmeer
n ethodists m Grafton; Mr. Thomas Clarke, a pioneer Methodist in the Mudeee
ircmt; Andrew Gdl nephew of Silas Gill and a prominent figure in the history
of Cun die ; and Mr. John Grainger, of Singleton, were called away during the
year 1896 They were all intimately associated with Methodism in its initial
stages m the Circuits already named. Mr. Grainger settled in iB6O at Paterson
and continued to preach for 35 years. In Singleton he did his most important
work, and is gratefully remembered to-day as the first to visit many in the
scattered He was ready to respond to every call. He was well known
m Church assemblies, and served Methodism in every available official position.
The following year several other men of prominence were called home
Among the number was Mr. James Piper, of the Tamworth Circuit, who for
wenty years served the Church as a trustee and office bearer; Mr. W H B
Preadier h °
r, M. J. W. Barker, who died at a ripe age, having served Methodism

Methodism in its early days; Mr. H. Kellett, of Ashfield, Local Preacher.

Lambert, of Armidale ; and Mr. J. T. Neale, of the William Street Circuit a
constant and systematic giver to the work of God. The following year 1808

e death roll. He was followed by Mr. William Baines and Mr. William
Brewer both of the Manning River; Mr. F. B. Gulley, of the Richmond River;
Mr John Simpson, of Corowa; Mr. Henry Saxby, who, in 1874, removed to
joulburn and in conjunction with others began services, which led to the for-

and being repeatedly elected as Representative to the Conference. Mr.
William Crundell, for many years in active service in the Gunning Circuit, passed
away at the age of 82. He was an ornament to the Church, and to the Chris-
tian profession. As a Local Preacher he rendered valuable service. Mr. J. J.
Waddell also died during this year. At Collector he identified himself ener-
getically with all movements to benefit the community. Day and Sunday
Schools were established, and as the result of revival services, conducted by the
Rev. J. W. Dowson, a Church was built.
Mr. C. W. Lukey, of the St. Leonards Circuit, passed away in the year
1900. He was the oldest surviving Trustee of the St. Leonard’s Church. The
Inverell Circuit sustained a heavy loss by the death of Mr. Thomas Taylor. Mr.
1 aylor was a free-handed and generous helper, and a tower of strength to the
Church. He made provision for the erection of the beautiful Church now
standing at Inverell. Mr. W. R. Reynolds, of the Stanmore Circuit, and Mr.
John Southall, of Farnsham, had been workers in the Church for many years.
Mr. Henry Kellett died at Chatswood, August 22nd, 1901. He was a consistent
loyal, and useful member of the Church, taking a deep interest in its affairs. He
was well known in Circuits in and around Sydney as an acceptable Local
Preacher. One prominently associated with Newcastle Methodism for many
years passed away in the person of Mr. William Arnott. First in West Mait-
land, and afterwards in Newcastle, he successfully pursued his business, in
which he afterwards became very successful. He was a thoroughly loyal
Methodist, who loved the Class Meetings, and always bore his testimony to
God’s goodness. “He was a good man, a judicious and Christian worker, a
father and husband worthy of imitation, an able and enterprising business man.”
Mr. John Gibson, for thirty-six years identified with Methodism in the Crookwell
District, maintained uninterrupted membership with it until his death in 1901.
He lived a zealous, godly life, and was a liberal giver. One of the pioneers in
the Maitland District also died this year in the person of Mr. John Bowden, one
of the most successful Local Preachers. His name was on the plan for
seventy-three years. Long distances were no obstacle to him, and nothing
seemed too hard for him to do to further the cause he loved so well. He placed
all that he had at the disposal of the Church, and gave most generously of his
means. Mr. J. T. Wheatley, another pioneer, died at Junee during this year.
He was almost the last of a succession of godly laymen whose names are
associated with the progress of Methodism in the Gunning Circuit. “He was a
typical Methodist, and a good old type at that.”
The last in this long list of obituaries are the names of Mr. George Read
and Mr. C. Bowen. Mr. Read was a Class Leader for nearly half a century, and
did splendid work in York Street, Chippendale, and Bourke Street Circuits. He
was an ideal Class Leader, and a constant student of the Word of God. Though
raised to the position of Superintendent of Police, this did not prevent him
from taking active interest in the Church. He died in January, 1902. Mr.
Charles Bowen was an active figure at Hornsby, where he was prominently
associated with the erection of the first Wesleyan Church in that district.
Deeply interested in the work of God he sought to help it in every possible
way. After seven months’ suffering he passed away on January 26th.
Among the legislative acts of this period must be placed the initiation
of the Removal Expenses Fund, due largely to the efforts of the Rev. W. W.
Rutledge. By the establishment of this Fund an annual levy is made upon all
Circuits, by means of which claims are met after submission to the Removal’

TO THE REV. J. B. WATERHOUSE.


Expenses Committee. The establishment of this Fund has been of great
service to the weaker Circuits, and it has commended itself to the
approval of the people generally. To secure the more orderly and
uniform conduct of the business of the Quarterly Meeting, the Conference
of 1902 adopted a list of questions, which may be found in the Minutes of that
date. It also did similar service for the Leader’s Meeting. The perennial
Class Meeting question, which, it was thought, had been finally disposed of
by the last General Conference held in Sydney, cropped up again, and the
Conference of 1902 declared its unabated appreciation of the Class Meeting as
a means of grace, and urged its regular observance and the duty of attendance.
It forwarded instructions to the Synods to consider the question with the view
to secure an increase of godly and earnest leaders ; to promote instructiveness
and interest in the regular meetings, and to recommend such measures desirable
and necessary to place the Class Meeting in that position of influence and
power that it should hold as an essential part of the spirit and organisation of
the Church.* The matter of Chaplains to Public Institutions, Gaols,
Hospitals, and Naval and Military Forces claimed the attention of
the Rev. J. E. Carruthers, who was able to state as the result of his efforts
that the representations made to the State Government for a more adequate
recognition of the rights of the Church in relation to private Chaplaincies had
been successful. ‘‘ Our efforts/’ said Mr. Carruthers, “ hitherto have been
successful; but it will be necessary to exercise constant vigilance so as to
secure and maintain the full measure of recognition to which our status as a
Church entitles us in regard to this matter.” During the Boer War, the Revs.
James Green and H. J. C. Foreman, 8.A., were appointed Chaplains to the
Forces.
The work in the Foreign Mission field continued to receive attention,
though no new Mission was undertaken. An important step was, however,
taken with regard to the Fiji District in the adoption of a Constitution, pro-
viding for an increase of the self-governing powers of that District. The
Constitution was to operate in the year 1902. The Higher Education of the
Fijians also was considered, and steps were taken to secure changes considered
important and desirable. The settlement of thousands of Coolies in Fiji has
given the Board of Missions much thought. A Missionary Sister was first
appointed to work amongst them, and an Indian Mission under the superin-
tendence of the Chairman of the District, with one Missionary and two Mis-
sionary Sisters now exists. The re-establishment of a Mission to China was
considered by the Conference of 1902, but it could not see its way to recom-
mend the resumption of the Mission previously undertaken by the Bible
Christians, as directed by the General Conference. Norfolk Island, though
not to be regarded as a Foreign Mission Station, was now taken over by the
Executive Committee of the Sustentation Society, and worked as a Home
Mission Station. The Home Missionary afterwards gave place to the Rev.
Robert Laverty, who is now doing valuable work among the residents.
We must now briefly refer to the attitude of the Church to great public
questions. Take first its relation to Romanism. Towards that system its atti-
tude has always been pronounced. For though the Church has made it clear
that it has no quarrel with individual representatives of that body, it neverthe-
less has made it equally apparent that there must be everlasting war against its
unscriptural doctrines and its pernicious practices. Romanism has been ceaseless
* The General Conference of 1904 made the basis of Church membership broader still.


and untiring in its efforts to advance its interests at the expense of the State,
while its official Head has endeavoured to usurp position and influence to which
he was not entitled on numerical or any other grounds. Against these encroach-
ments, the Conference has repeatedly protested. The Conference of 1902 re-
affirmed its convictions that any changes in the principles of the Public Schools’
Act, brought into existence by Sir Henry Parkes, were undesirable and unneces-
sary, especially when these changes sought to confer aid upon the schools of any
particular denomination. “Such changes,” it said, “should be resisted by the
Parliament.’ And it also recorded its disapproval of grants being made to
charitable institutions not under the control nor subject to the inspection of the
Government. St. Patrick’s Day having been previously proclaimed a public
holiday, the Conference respectfully and emphatically protested against the set-
ting apart of such a day as a public holiday as an unwarranted and a dangerous
precedent, and an unnecessary addition to the already numerous public holidays,
i his protest, in conjunction with those from other quarters, was successful, and
St. Patrick’s Day is not now proclaimed a public holiday.
On the great question of Temperance reform the Church has given forth
no uncertain sound. Its attitude throughout is indicated in the Report sub-
mitted to the Conference of 1902. In that Report the Conference affirmed its
belief in the principle of Local and State Option without compensation. At the
same time it stated that in its judgment the drink traffic was vicious in itself,
and that the Church could be no party to the State adopting the system of public
control. It also urged its adherents to exercise their rights as ratepayers, and
to take advantage of the Local Option vote to prevent the increase and renewal
of public-house licenses. To give an opportunity for the enforcement of these
views, it regularly set apart one Sabbath in the year as Temperance Sunday;
and it advocated the admission into Sunday School libraries such books as
taught clearly the great evils of gambling and intemperance. It also recom-
mended the use of non-intoxicating wines in the ministration of the Sacrament.
With regard to the observance of the Sabbath, it strongly urged the people
to maintain the utmost fidelity to the requirements of the day by conscientious
abstinence from secular engagements and unnecessary travelling, and by careful
attention to all religious duties. It urged the people to elect to Parliament
and Municipal Councils only those persons in favour of preserving inviolate
the rest and sacredness of the Sabbath, and those pledged to oppose any attempt
to open public-houses on any part of that day, and it directed that a sermon
be preached on this subject in all the Churches on the last Sunday in June.
An effort being made by the Government to regulate the liquor traffic
by means of a Licensing Amending Act, the Temperance Committee requested
the State Treasurer to embody the following points in his proposed Bill; —(1) To
extend the existing Local Option law that it may apply to all new licenses.
(2) To enact earlier hours of closing on week nights. (3) To enable Sunday
closing to be effective by adopting the recommendations of the Royal Commis-
sion as to the charge of onus of proof from the police to the publican and persons
found on licensed premises during prohibited hours ; and by giving all police-
men the right to take action. (4) To enact the non-employment of barmaids
after reasonable notice. (5) And to prevent the sale of liquor to children and
young people under 17 years of age as messengers, as well as for consumption
on the premises. The Conference has also consistently opposed all efforts
to establish the Totalisator, and it has repeatedly given voice to its disapproval
of gambling and of those practices at bazaars where the gambling principle
has been taken advantage of to dispose of goods.


The Church’s attitude to other public questions may be gathered from
the spirit embodied in the resolutions passed from time to time. As an
indication of that spirit, take again the resolutions passed by the Conference
of i 902. As the Boer War was then waging, the Conference expressed its
sympathy with the Methodist and other Churches of South Africa during the
sorrow caused by the war, and it recorded its indignation at the slanders ex
tensively circulated as to the conduct of the campaign on the part of the Imperial
Government and the troops under its direction. It expressed its unabated
conviction as to the righteousness of the policy which led up to the war, and
the honour and humanity of the soldiers in prosecuting the same. Dealing with
the Coronation Oath on the accession of His Majesty, King Edward VII.,
it declared that no alteration would be acceptable which should relax in any
degree the safeguards ensuring the Protestant succession to the Throne of Great
Britain and its dependencies. A copy of the resolution was forwarded to the
Governor-General for transmission to the Secretary of State. The Duke of
Cornwall being on a visit to Australia in connection with the inauguration of the
Commonwealth at this time, an address of welcome was presented to the Duke
and Duchess, expressing loyalty to the King and throne, and conveying respect-
ful sympathy in the bereavement sustained by the the death of the Queen. A
cordial welcome to the Duke and Duchess on their visit to these shores was
also tendered. To this address the Duke of York forwarded a lengthy reply.
The news of the death of the President of the United States having been
received in Sydney in September, igoi, the President, the Rev. George Lane,
accompanied by the Secretary, called on Mr. Orlando H. Baker, the United
States Consul, presenting a letter of sympathy with the sorrow-stricken nation
and the bereaved family, on behalf of the Wesleyan Church.
As a fitting close to the work of the New South Wales Conference, we
cannot do better than quote the special resolution prepared by the Rev. J. E.
Carruthers at the Conference request. “At this, the last session of the New
South Wales Wesleyan Methodist Conference, we desire to place on record our
devout sense of the continual guidance and blessing of Almighty God through-
out our history as a Church in these lands. It is nearly go years since Wes-
leyan Methodism was introduced into New South Wales, and over 86 years
since its first ordained Missionary landed on these shores. The vicissitudes
and perils of the early days were succeeded by the period when, through the
wisdom and enterprise of our fathers and brethren in England, the Church in
this Colony was organised into a District, then into an integral portion of an
Australasian Conference, and later into an Annual Conference under the General
Conference of the Australasian Wesleyan Methodist Church. Now, under
what we believe to be the guidance of our Divine Head, this Conference is
merging into the New South Wales Conference of the Methodist Church of Aus-
tralasia, thus entering into organic union with all the other branches of Method-
ism on this Continent and in these seas. In entering into larger ecclesiastical re-
lationships and ampler opportunities of spiritual usefulness, we cannot forget how
the Hand of God has been upon us for good during our history. In the succes-
sion of earnest, gifted, and devoted men who have been raised up for the
ministry of the Church ; in the sagacious and far-seeing counsellors and wise
and capable administrators who have managed its affairs; in the spirit of holy
aggression and sanctified daring that has never been wanting in its policy ;
in the material wealth that has been placed in no small measure at its disposal;
in the arduous and self-sacrificing toil by which its ministers and people have
been willing to further the great purpose of its existence ; and in the multitudes


Ttor** 1 ** /'*->•* * ' 4 **'* §
of those who have been converted and saved under its ministrations; —we find
proof of our Divine vocation as a Church and evidence of the abiding blessing
of Heaven upon our ministrations. ‘Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but
unto Thy name give glory, for Thy mercy and for Thy truth’s sake.’ The
successes and victories of the past inspire us with confidence that, under the
enlarged conditions we are now entering upon, our beloved Methodism will
be a greater spiritual power than it has ever yet been in this State ; and to this
end we fervently pray that the Divine Spirit may be given in ampler measure
to the United Methodism of this State and of Australasia, thus qualifying it
more efficiently to discharge the great commission entrusted to it; To spread
Scriptural Holiness throughout the land.”

CHAPTER XX.
THE CENTRAL METHODIST MISSION.
ENGLISH Methodists have their Mecca in City Road Chapel, towards
which they turn with willing feet, and for which they cherish an affec-
tion akin to veneration. The Methodists of this State find their
Mecca in the Centenary Hall, standing on the site of the Centenary
Chapel, frequently spoken of as “ dear old York Street.” This Chapel was
endeared by many precious memories. Those in the front rank of Methodist
preachers have stood in its pulpit and guided its affairs; in its underground
schoolrooms many have been trained who, to-day, are among our public men ;
while crowds of the elite of the city entered through its pillared porches to
worship in its pews of unpoetic mould.” Here, in Conference assembled, the
leaders of the Church have rallied their forces in debate and legislative enact-
ment, while not a few remember some hallowed spot where the great crisis of
life. came. That time when—
“ Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;
Smote the chord of Self, that trembling, passed in music out of sight.”
But the old order changed. The conditions of city life produced an exodus of
Methodist families into the suburbs, where they established Churches to which
they gave the benefit of their service. But the drain killed York Street; and
it was left high and dry upon the sands of desolation with its banner, still
waving, bearing the word Ichabod. To the Conference the place had become
a perplexing problem. What was to be done with it ? Some advocated its
sale, and the erection of a Church in a more central spot. That any of John
Wesley’s successors should be found suggesting the sale of an empty building,
standing in the midst of thousands of non-churchgoers, seems incredible.
Others thought that a change of method with a wise adaptability would be better.
Some of the ablest men in Conference warmly advocated this step, though here
and there was an undertone of pity or contempt that York Street Chapel had
come to “this.” Yes, it had come to this or that; “this,” being an earnest
attempt to reclaim the people by a wise policy of adaption; “ that,” the toler-
ance of an empty Chapel surrounded by a crowd. But, surely, life, in whatever
form expressed, is preferable to stagnation, or to chilling formalism.
With a view to a remedy, the Conference, after anxious consideration, re-
solved on a new departure; and, with this object, appointed the Rev. William
G. Taylor as Superintendent, and the Rev. Frederick C. Boyer as Assistant. In
these appointments the Conference showed its wisdom in its choice of men.
Mr. Taylor stands without a compeer in his own line. He is a specialist in


the sense that many of the early Methodist preachers were specialists, his
special study being the best methods to bring men to Christ. He is eminently
suited for such a position. Gifted with great pathetic power ; fearless, strong, and
persistent in his denunciations of evil; possessing a magnificent voice, a fine
presence and an attractive personality, joined with Methodist fire and fervour,
he moves his audience at his will. He has a genius for organisation and an
unquenchable love for his work. In his colleague he found a loyal and
gifted helper, who, after twelve months’ service, was succeeded by the Rev.
Joseph Woodhouse to whom the same remark applies. The Conference fur-
ther showed its wisdom by giving Mr. Taylor an absolutely free hand to do
what “ grace, grit or gumption ” might suggest. And it refused to hamper him
by unnecessary or irritating restrictions. “Let him,” said a dignified Ex-president,
surely under sway of a reckless mood, “ kick down the old pulpit—anything
to make the place go.” But Mr. Taylor found quite sufficient avenues for his
energies in other directions, as a glance at the situation will show.
The congregation, which once numbered 1,000, now stood at 50, the Classes
had dwindled down to 18 members in the whole Circuit, the Chapel was dull
and dingy, the Choir, in large part, had deserted their posts, and the Stewards,
in pessimistic mood, said that “ the thing was dead.” And what was worse,
it could not be brought to life again! Of this they were so fully persuaded
that they declined to accept any financial responsibility. But Mr. Taylor was
not so minded. Believing that much lies in a name, he designated the new
departure, “ The Central Methodist Mission ” ; thus anticipating by two years
a similar name given to the East London Mission, the first of the now famous
Missions in England. Equipped with a small organ, at which Mr. Boyer pre-
sided, the little band ventured into the open air, taking their stand at the Town
Hall Corner, a spot which the Mission workers have since appropriated. “At
first,” says Mr. Taylor, “we met with the keenest opposition. . . . The
Salvation Army was in its infancy. No Methodist Church had its Mission Band.
Many Christian Ministers expressed strong doubts as to the wisdom of our new
departure. A mighty rush of opposition came from the free-thinking element,
at that time a force to be reckoned with. Still we persevered ; and gradually
—very gradually at first—the congregation increased. Some of the worst fel-
lows of the streets were converted, and many of them are with us to-day."—
( Report , 1898.) By degrees a strong band of workers was gathered. Five or
six open air services were held every week. The Superintendent placed him-
self m direct communication with the Ships in the Harbour, and the Boarding
and Common Lodging Houses, whilst the streets were paraded by bands of
converts, with invitation slips, and words of kindly welcome. The congrega-
tions grew from the start. Gradually the centre of the Chapel was filled, the
seats under the gallery were appropriated, then the gallery was thrown open,
shortly to be fully occupied, and within twelve months the Sunday evening
congregation numbered nearly 1000; and “Old York Street,” the despair of
the Conference, the lifeless thing of the Stewards, was alive again, was self-
supporting and crammed to the doors. The membership roll was rising beauti-
fully ; at the end of the first three months it stood at 53 full members with


3 1 on trial; then it proceeded thus quarter by quarter: 80 and 63 ; 115 and
52 ; 123 and 66 140 and 19; 150 and 53 ; 168 and 35, and so on to its present
membership, which numbers 499, with a paid staff of 29, and an unpaid one of
266.
Now came a new experience, and another period of trial. Failure had prc-
\ lously been the trouble ; success now blocked the way. A larger building ,vas
required in which provision could be made for those philanthropic adjuncts
which it was felt must accompany such a work. The Trustees submitted a
scheme to the Executive Committee in which they proposed to make alterations
to the Chapel at a cost of £1,500; but the Committee would have none of it,
and rejecting the Trustees proposal, substituted a scheme of their own which
w as eventually adopted. But the Conference moved slowly. Its first step was
to remit the question of the establishment of a “ Central Methodist Mission ”
to the Executive Committee, and the Sydney District Meeting, with a view to
the consideration of the scheme by those Quarterly Meetings of the Circuits
likely to be affected by the establishment of such a Mission.—( Conf. Minutes \
1887.) The next Conference resolved that the matter be postponed for a year
to allow an expression of opinion on the subject, first by the Trustees of the
York Street property, and then by the next Sydney District Meeting.
Meanwhile, but not without divergence of opinion, Connexional Commit-
tees, and finally the Conference resolved to pull down the old Chapel and to
rebuild. Messrs. Rowe and Green were the architects, and Mr. Catt’s tender
for the sum of £25,000 was accepted by the newly-appointed body of Trustees.
The Rev. Joseph H. Fletcher, who had done much to encourage Mr. Taylor*
and who persistently advocated the policy of adaptation, preached the last
sermon in the old Chapel in November, 1886, his text being: i. Peter i., 24, 25.
“For all flesh is grass,” etc. The sermon, which was characteristic, had five
heads. The Word of the Lord endures: i. Monumental; ii. Terminal; iii.
Vocal; iv. Crescent; v. Eternal. Its closing words were: “ And now farewell
old York Street. You are but a youngster compared with the Ministers of the
Western world, a mere mushroom compared with pyramid and sphinx in the
Western world, yet your time has come to vanish away. In your earlier days
yen were beautiful and admired. But you stand to us now type of our world
which in the eye of its Great Architect shall one day seem obsolete and un-
comely. As a vesture shall it with ease be folded and thrown aside. Then
over some greener earth shall rise some more glorious heaven, for ‘He that
sitteth on the throne ’ will say, ‘ Behold, I make all things new.’ ”
The work of demolition was at once begun, and the congregation, gathered
by the dint of so much toil, was scattered. A dirty room in Kent Street, capable
of seating 200 persons, became the centre of the work, or of all that was left
of it. Here the noble 200, led on by the Rev. James A. Bowrmg, who for the
time had succeeded Mr. Taylor, toiled amidst many discouragements, until in
October, 1888, the present magnificent block of buildings was opened, and for
five months Mr. Bowring laboured amidst nobler surroundings. Meanwhile Mr.
Taylor had gone to England, chiefly at the instigation of the Rev. J. H. Flet-
cher, that he might inspect the methods of Forward Movement Mission work in

the old land. The foundation stones were laid on Saturday, July 2nd, 1887, by
Mrs. Allen, of Toxteth, Mrs. Schofield, the Rev. W. G. R. Stephinson, President
of the Conference, and the Hon. E. Vickery, M.L.C. Addresses were delivered
by the Rev. Principal Fletcher, on “ The History of Old York Street,” and the
Rev. Dr. Kelynack on “ Christian and Philanthropic Work of the Future,” while
a united choir composed of representatives of the city and suburban Churches
rendered appropriate music. Though in use some time previously, the formal
opening did not take place till the 28th April, 1889, when Dr. Kelynack and
the Rev. W. G. Taylor preached in the morning and evening respectively, Prin-
cipal Fletcher and Mr. Taylor taking the services on the following Sabbath. On
the following Thursday (2nd May), a well attended inaugural demonstration
was held, with the Hon. E. Vickery in the chair. Mr. Vickery spoke on the aim
of the Mission, Mr. Taylor outlined its programme, and the Revs. J. H. Fletcher,
J. E. Carruthers and Dr. Kelynack gave appropriate addresses. Over £BOC
were promised, the subscriptions including £250 from the Chairman, £lOO from
Mrs. Schofield, £3O from Mrs. Allen, and £5O from a “ Queensland friend.” This
brought the total amount of subscriptions to £1450. But this was not all, for
on the following Wednesday (May Bth), a meeting of Methodist ladies was
arranged, to be followed by a Mass Meeting for young men. The President
for the year, the Rev. R. Caldwell, presided at the Fadies’ Meeting, at which
;£ioo 16s. 3d. was collected, the ladies having made themselves responsible for
A 360. The young men promised £yo towards the Evangelists’ Home.


A sinking Fund had been provided, it was thought, by the rentals of the
Hall and warehouses. But as the best laid plans of men oft go astray, so one
of those periodic afflictions in the form of commercial depression came over the
Colony. 1 In consequence, the warehouses brought in but half the anticipated
revenue, and when the total cost of the building was ascertained, the £25,000
'had run up to £31,000. This unforeseen result placed an incubus of debt upon
the Mission property, which has made the wheels drag heavily, and which, but
for the relief afforded by the Loan Funds would have produced disaster. So
severe was the pressure felt at one period, that Mr. Taylor was officially sent to
Europe and America to assist in raising £lO,OOO towards the extinction of the
debt. But Mr. Taylor, like some others who have gone on a like errand, found
it extremely difficult to convince the Motherland that it was her duty to assist
New South Wales in her hour of need ; and after all his efforts, which were
most exhausting and persistent, he collected the sum of £3OOO. 2
The buildings now being adapted for the work contemplated, Mr. Taylor
was again placed in charge, and the Conference of 1889 adopted the following
resolution; “1. That a Central Mission be established in connection with the
Centenary Hall, York Street. 2. That the Princes Street Church be included
in the Central Mission scheme. The Mission Committee to undertake the
management of the Princes Street finances. 3. That the operations of the Mis-
sion be confined within the limits of the present York Street Circuit, except in
such cases as shall have received the sanction of the Superintendent Minister,
and the Quarterly Meeting of any Circuit in which it may be thought advisable
to enter upon Mission work. 4. That one or more Ministers be appointed to
the Mission. 5. That the Mission be under the management of a Committee,
to be composed as follows: —The President of the Conference for the time be-
ing, the Clerical General Secretary of the Church Sustentation and Extension
Society, the Minister or Ministers appointed annually by the Representative
Conference on the nomination of the Trustees of the Centenary Hall. 6. That
■the Mission shall be carried on with the design of reaching, and influencing all
classes of the community. 7. The Conference appoints for the first twelve
months the Revs. Principal Fletcher and William Kelynack, D.D., to conduct,
in conjunction with the Minister in charge of the Mission, the Sunday morning
service. 8. That the other Sunday Services be directly evangelistic. 9. That
.an ordained Minister be appointed to the Mission. 10. That suitable agents be
appointed to assist in carrying on outdoor and rescue work under the direction
of the Committee, n. That as soon as funds are available, a suitable City
Missionary be engaged. 12. That the work of Temperance be regarded as a
special branch of the Mission enterprise. 13. That the following gentlemen
nominated by the Trustees of the Centenary Hall, be the Committee of Manage-
1 This depression amounted to a panic. During the months of April and May twelve
■banks temporarily closed their doors, involving the locking up of nearly ninety-eight
millions of pounds sterling. And during two years 43 financial institutions sus-
pended payment. It has since been shown that this action on the part of
some of the banks was premature and ill-advised.

ment for the year 1889: —The Hon. E. Vickery, M.L.C., Messrs. William Davies,
Thomas Cummins, Walter H. McClelland, Edward Dawson, George Crawshaw,
and Rev. William Kelynack, D.D.”
Mr. William Davies was the first Secretary to the Committee, retaining the
position till his death, when he was succeeded by Mr. Walter H. McClelland,
who has since held the post continuously. Mr. Edward Dawson was appointed
Treasurer, and at his removal from Sydney, he was succeeded by Mr. Percy N.
Slade in 1898. This office entails much work which has always been cheerfully
and efficiently done, thus placing the Mission under great obligation. In the
choice of Morning Preachers, the Conference was singularly fortunate. Joseph
Fletcher and William Kelynack stood without rivals as Methodist Preachers.
Joseph Fletcher was the Ruskin of Australian Methodism ; William Kelynack its
Demosthenes. They were both princely men. They have been succeeded by
the Revs. J. Egan Moulton, George Martin, Edward J. Rodd, now President of
Burwood Ladies’ College and Theological Tutor, and the Rev. Charles J. Pres-
cott, M.A. (Oxon.), President and Head Master of Newington College. At the
Conference of 1891, the Superintendents of the adjoining Circuits were appointed
to assist at the morning service. The Hon. Ebenezer Vickery, M.L.C., who has
continuously held the position of Treasurer to the Trust, has laid the Mission
under an incalculable debt by his valuable counsel and continuous gifts. It is
not too much to say that without his assistance the Mission could not have
reached its present high state of efficiency. Mr. Vickery belongs to that class of
men who “do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame.” In the year 1901, Mr.
H. M. Hawkins relinquished business to become organising Secretary to the
Mission, thus relieving Mr. Taylor of some of the responsibility.
At the close of the nine months, ending December 31, 1889, the Committee
submitted its first report for presentation to the forthcoming Conference. This
document stated that from the commencement they had met with encouragement,
and they were now thankful to report the following agencies in active operation.
I. Numerous Evangelistic Agencies, including four weekly indoor Evangelistic
Meetings, six Open air Mission Services, Cottage Meetings and a comprehensive
system of home visiting. 2. Temperance Agencies. Every worker connected with
the Mission was an abstainer from strong drink. During nine months, 192 Tem-
perance and 245 Anti-gambling pledges had been taken. 3. The Mission to Sea-
men. From all directions testimonies were borne to the good work done among
the Seamen. In large numbers they attended the services, and many had been
converted. A band of earnest workers visited the ships at the public wharves
every Sunday morning with tracts and invitation slips, and 3636 visits had been
made during the nine months. 4. The Training Home for Evangelists was
meeting a felt want. There were three young men in residence who received
instruction in Theology, Literary Subjects and Methods of Christian work.
Their afternoons were given to visiting in the homes and the Hospitals ; and
their evenings and the whole of Sunday to Evangelistic work. A Book Stall
was also to be established for the sale of Religious Literature. 5. The Musical
Department was becoming a source of power to the Mission. The Brass Band
secured a congregation in the streets, while the Choir and Orchestral Band had

greatly helped in the Sunday Evening Services. 6. The Sunday Afternoon
Adults, Bible C lass had met with a fair measure of success. J. The Free Read-
ing Room and Library was being visited weekly by hundreds of working men.
As a counter attraction to the public house bar, it was a success. 8. The Cen-
tenary Hall Boys Club, undertaken by the Young Men’s Sectional Committee
had given some concern. Suitable premises in Clarence Street at a rental of
& 2 7S P er year had been secured in which to carry on the work, and they had
been comfortably fitted up as Gymnasium, Class, Reading and Recreation
Rooms and Concert Hall. Rough youths, numbering 400, had passed through
the Club, many of whom had been manifestly improved by its associations.
Every Sunday night a homely religious service was conducted, in which from 30
to 50 youths were gathered. 9. The Ladies’ Sectional Committee had rendered
much valuable assistance, and about 50 poor women were members of the weekly
Mothers’ Meeting. The Sunday Congregations had already grown. Every
Sunday morning from 300 to 400 persons assembled. At night the congregation
varied from 1200 to 1500 persons of all classes. The congregation was in great
part a new one, and was thus a distinct gain ta Methodism. Rarely had ser-
vices been conducted without visible fruit. There was an increase of 100 per
cent, of members, while the Class Meeting was the life of the Mission. The
excessive financial burdens upon the Trust had brought grave difficulties from
the start. The Committee had been forced to raise £919 18s. 3d. for Trust pur-
poses before they could touch the real work of the Mission. The income from


all sources was 13 s - adding £2 /s. 6d. more to the debt which existed
at the commencement of the work. In addition to the agencies at work, there
was in contemplation the establishment of a Home for Sisters of the Mission, a
Home for Friendless and Fallen Women, Young Mens Guild, Literary Associa-
tion, Savings Bank, Servants’ Registry Office, and Free Breakfasts for the Poor.
Mr. Taylor also furnished what he designated “Jottings from the Superinten-
dent’s Note Book,” in which he gave particulars of some remarkable cases of
conversion which God had been pleased to give to them in their work duung the
nine months. The temptation to reproduce some of these “ samples ”of the
work is strong, but space, or rather the want of it, forbids.
When this report was placed before the Conference, its gratitude found
• expression in the following resolution; “That this Conference, in adopting the
Report of the Central Mission, records its devout gratitude to God for the suc-
cess with which He has been pleased to crown the enterprise. It recognises the
devotion and ability with which the Rev. W. G. Taylor has directed the various
agencies of the Mission, and the value of the service rendered by the Revs. Dr.
Kelynack and Principal Fletcher, the Sunday Morning Preachers. The Com-
mittee is also thanked for the attention it has given to the work committed to
it, and it is hereby directed that the Report be printed in extenso in The Weekly
Advocate , and in other ways circulated amongst our people.”— {Conf.
Min., 1890.)
The Mission might now be said to be successfully launched, and already to
have fulfilled the hopes of those who so strenuously advocated its foundation
■lts progress was one of steady development, in which, some schemes being found
unworkable had to be abandoned, while others, not in the original programme,
gradually took shape and were forced upon the Committee through the neces-
sities of the work. The Free Reading Room and Library, though much appre-
ciated by those for whose benefit it was commenced, was abused by that type
of professional loafer who finds in Sydney a happy hunting ground. Sometimes
he was light-fingered, and while appropriating books or papers, he generally
managed to leave behind him some savoury reminder which did not add to the
■comfort of the respectable working man. The management was, therefore, com-
pelled to discontinue this agency. The Religious Book Stall did not apparently
meet a want, for after a brief and feeble existence, it quietly disappeared.
The Boys’ Club killed itself. That the idea was good, the work beneficial, and
its continuance necessary, cannot be gainsaid. But the expense was great and
the expenditure of energy and time demanded so constant that it could not be
given without making serious inroads upon the more directly spiritual work of
the Mission. Reluctantly, therefore, it was closed, to be succeeded by a Boys'
Institute and Gymnasium still in existence.
But the Evangelists’ Training Home has consistently held its position from
the start, and it has been of great service to many young men. This movement
was commenced in prayer. At the close of the Consecration Meeting one Satur-
day evening in April, 1889, a number of praying people ascended to the large
.room at the top of the building, where they formed a ring and went to prayer,


thus consecrating the Home, which has always been a centre of blessing and
power, and is held dear by those who have been in residence. Since its estab-
lishment, between forty and fifty men have passed through it, and Mr. Taylor
says that without exceptioii they have all given a good account of themselves.
The first candidates to enter the Home were Mr. Edward Hutchinson, who had
been employed by the Rev. Thomas Champness in the Joyful News Mission in
England ; Mr. Joseph Walker, who gave up business to join the Home, and Mr.
James Richards, another of Mr. Champness’ men. After several years valuable
service, Mr. Hutchinson entered the Congregational Ministry, taking with him,
as his wife, Miss Gannon, formerly one of the C.M.M. Sisters. Mr. Walker
entered the Wesleyan Ministry in this State, and Mr. Richards returned to
England. Several other Evangelists have become Wesleyan Ministers, one has
joined the Baptist Ministry, and now has charge of a suburban Church, and
another, not finding the doors of his own Church open to receive him, passed
over to the Anglican Church, graduated at Sydney University, and finally be-
came Assistant Tutor at Moore College, where he had previously a distinguished
career, winning a scholarship each year. Numbers have become Home Mis-
sionaries in South Australia, Queensland, Western Australia and New South
Wales, while others have laboured in a similar capacity in Ireland, England and
New Zealand. If proof be needed, this is abundant evidence that the Evange-
lists’ Home is a successful training ground for young men who wish to fit them-
selves for Christian service. And we know of no other place where equal
advantages are offered, or where young men could gain a better insight into the
successful methods of evangelistic effort.
The Mission to Seamen is the oldest Branch of the Mission, and its origin
is peculiar. Attention having been directed to the large numbers of Methodist
seamen who visit this port, the establishment of a Seaman’s Mission was sug-
gested to Mr. Taylor, who brought the idea before the Ministers’ Monthly Meet-
ing. Though not wanting in sympathy, this meeting could do nothing beyond
suggesting that the matter be laid before the Home Mission Committee. As
this Committee did not see its way to the appointment of an agent, a few friends
accepted the responsibility, and engaged Mr. H. D. Gilbert as Seamen’s Mis-
sionary, and he soon gave proof of his suitability for such work. The Mission
was started on July sth, 1886, and has continued to this day with encouraging
success. Its head quarters are at Princes Street, where the Seamen’s Institute
has its home in the Schoolroom. “ During the year,” to let the Missionary speak
for himself in his Report for the year 1898, “ the congregations, Sunday School,
Collections and Society Classes, have been greatly m excess of previous years.
The Seaman’s Institute has been open every night, while every Friday there
has been a Musical Evening for sailors. A short, stirring address is given at
every concert, which is much appreciated by the men; followed by invitations
to the Sunday Services, both at Centenary Hall and Princes Street Hall. .
Workers assist in visiting every ship along the wharves, tracts and handbills
are given out, and a kindly word given to Jack. It is thus we obtain our con-
gregation.” The following tabulated statement of a year’s work (1898) will give
.some idea of what is done, Visits paid to ships in port, 3334 ; handbills and

Closely allied with this Branch is the work among the Blue Jackets, at first
carried on by the Rev. Samuel Wilkinson, for many years Chaplain to H.M.
warships. A Parade Service was conducted every Sabbath morning in the Cen-
tenary Hall at g.30 by the Chaplain or a Minister appointed by him. That the
efforts made were appreciated, finds evidence in a letter sent to Mr. Taylor by
one of the men who had completed his term of service on this station. Speak-
ing on behalf of the Naval men, who had attended the Hall, he says; “ We can-
not leave Australia without expressing our thanks to you for the interest you


have displayed in our people, and also the authorities and members of the Mis-
sion, who ha\ e done their best to make us feel at home when enjoying" your
services . . . and we take this opportunity of thanking you most heartily
for this cordiality. Such services as those held by you cannot fail to produce
an elevating effect on our men. Although such may not be apparent to you, and
our people seem to come and go without any visible effect of religious influence
having been brought to bear, we feel assured that, as we ourselves have been
influenced and brought to a higher standard of manhood, many more have been
likewise benefited, and sincerely trust that such influence may be a lasting one.
We wish the Central Mission ‘ God Speed.’ These few lines only
express a small portion of the regret which we felt at having to sever our con-
nection with those who have at all times been most kind and attentive to the
sailor boys.”—(See Report , 1898.) Since the death of Mr. Wilkinson the post
of Chaplain to the Naval Forces has been filled by the Superintendent of the
Mission and his colleague, thus bringing this work directly under the Manage-
ment of the Central Mission Committee.
The Musical Department, a very important feature of the Mission, has been
continuously under the care of Mr. W. I. R Mote, who was appointed Musical
Director when the Mission was officially organised. That fact in itself is proof
■of Mr. Mote’s fitness for a post of no small difficulty, requiring much patience
and tact. By a strange irony, choirs are proverbial for strife ; but the Centenary
Hall Choir is conspicuous for the absence of friction. “ The social element,”
says Mr. Mote, “is not forgotten, and is an important factor in knitting the
members together; in fact we are as a large family, and if one member is m
any need of help, all the others are ready to do whatever is required of them,
to the best of their ability.” This work has often been owned of God in the
salvation of the members of the congregation, a fact made known through com-
munications received, wherein Mr. Mote has been thanked for help given
through solo or anthem. This is not surprising, for a song may reach him whom
a sermon flies. “ ‘ Excelsior ’is our motto,” says Mr. Mote, “ and we press on ” ;
and the work is done heartily as unto the Lord and not to men.
Though choir and orchestra are now in a high state of efficiency, success has
been attained only by dint of hard work. When Mr. Mote took control, he had
to form both choir and orchestra. The first practice night one solitary singer
put in an appearance, but there was no organist. The attempts to form an
•orchestra were even more perplexing. “ Many proffered help, only to be re-
fused by reason of total unfitness. I spent the first practice nights in giving an
elementary lesson in scale playing to two young would-be violinists ; but after
three months preparation, with the assistance of some personal friends, we
started the orchestra on the first Sunday evening service of September, 1889,
since which time it has been a very valuable adjunct to the People’s services.
All the first players have left us long since, but their places have been filled by
new comers, and to-day we have a good and fairly representative orchestra.”—
( Report , 1889.) The members pay a small subscription, part of which is given to
purchase of new music, the balance being used for social purposes. Practices
are held weekly, and every piece, whether hymn, anthem or chorus is specially


arranged for each player. This entails an enormous amount of writing, which
is cheerfully done in view of the results attained in the general ensemble. The
varied character of the work done will be seen from the following list of pieces
rendered-—many of them for the first time in Sydney; Ruth, Abraham’s Sacri-
fice, moth Psalm, 150 th Psalm, St. Cecilia’s Day, The Captive of Babylon, two
Harvest Cantatas, and several other items. The position of Organist changed
hands many times until it came to Mr. Arnold Mote, 8.A., a convert of the Mis-
sion and the son of the Musical Director. The Centenary Hall Brass Band is
well-known, having reached a state of efficiency rarely met with in similar agen-
cies. With the exception of a short interval, when the late Mr. Andrew Mills
was in charge, Mr. John Huegill has been the leader and organiser. Most of
the players are members of the Church, and every band practice begins and
ends with worship. The whole work of the Band is voluntary, save that of the
leader, who receives a small honararium to cover expenses. Frequently the
Band takes charge of the open air service, giving the addresses as well as lead-
ing the singing. “From our hearts,” says Mr. Taylor, “we thank God for the
splendid service thus renderd us year after year. Thousands have, by means of
our open air services, been led to attend the Hall Meetings, and many of them
0
have here met with Christ.”—( Report , 1898.)
The Sisterhood, one of the earliest branches of the work, is at the same time
one of the most popular; for the work that the Sisters have so faithfully and
unselfishly performed has commended itself to every right-thinking person. “ I
am persuaded,” said the President, the Rev. E. J. Rodd, in 1898, “ that the work
the Sisters do, in carrying the comfort and aid of Jesus Christ into the homes
of the distressed and the spiritually careless, is likely to prove the most success-
ful method we have yet devised for bringing the lapsed masses, as we term
them, into sympathetic relation with the Church. I should greatly rejoice in
such an increased liberality to this branch of the Mission as would enable us to
increase the number of the Sisters and generally extend the sphere of their use-
fulness.” To this Sisterhood belongs the honour of being the pioneer of its
kind in Australasia, for it was the first Evangelical Protestant Sisterhood, and
it stands to-day, in creation and labour, a direct answer to prayer. It was not
established without the nervous expression of some fears. It savoured of
Romanism some thought, and it would impose vows of perpetual maidenhood
upon the young ladies entering the Home ; but they soon dispelled that delu-
sion, for some of them married Christian workers, three of whom are now Minis-
ters. And in what more fitting place could any young woman qualify herself
for Christian service than here ? The one pledge required is to abide by a
few simple rules necessary in the conduct of such an establishment. Mr. Vic-
kery’s generosity provided a Home, and the formal opening was inaugurated by
Mr. W. H. McClelland presenting Mrs. Thomas Cowlishaw with a silver key
with which to open the Home on Saturday, August 9th, 1890; and addresses
were delivered by the Revs. R. Bavin and A. J. Webb. That same evening a
public meeting was held in the Centenary Hall, the Rev. George Lane presiding.
Mr. Taylor made a brief statement with regard to the expense, stating that there
were four Sisters in residence and four more expected. These four young


ladies, Sisters Mary Bibby (Sister-in-charge), Emily Gannon, Ada Atkins and
Laura Francis, were each presented with a Bible, and publicly set apart to the
work. Mrs. 1 aylor, wife of the Rev. W. G. Taylor, was Superintendent of the
Home. The Home was afterwards removed to Woolloomooloo, where a house
was again provided rent free by the Hon. Ebenezer Vickery, M.L.C. At a later
stage, the Home was removed to another house in the same block of buildings,
where it now stands in a well-furnished house of thirteen rooms. The Home
is under the management of the Ladies’ Auxiliary Committee, with the wife of
the Superintendent as Chief Sister, and Miss Hazelwood as Home Sister. The
house was furnished by the gifts of the people in sympathy with such work.
Thirty-eight young ladies have been in training. One went out as the first Aus-
tralasian Missionary Sister to New Guinea, another to India, while a third be-
came the wife of a Chinese Missionary.
The duties of the Sisters are manifold. Their morning hours are generally
given to Bible study and domestic duties, their afternoons and evenings to the
work of the Mission. They assist in all the gatherings, helping in the Classes,
the Christian Endeavour Society, the Mother’s Meetings and the Enquiry
Rooms. They also visit .the Public Schools for the purposes of giving religious
instruction, go in and out among the slums of the city, where their sympathetic
natures are often sorely taxed by the saddening sights they witness. They are
well-known and heartily-welcomed visitors at the Hospitals and Charitable In-
stitutions of the City, and they do their work in a spirit which is above all
praise. Some of it is heart-breaking work ; but it is all done cheerfully and
without complaint. The love of Christ constrains them, and they realise
that “ inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these ye
have done it unto Me.” Some of the Sisters have felt drawn to special work,,
in which they have been conspicuously successful. For example, Sister Francis
spent considerable time in seeking to rescue the unfortunate girls with whom
she frequently came into contact, going so far as to secure a room in the Hay-
market where she regularly held meetings. These poor creatures were often
under good impressions, with strong desires to forsake their lives of shame ; but
little practical good was done simply through the lack of a Home in which to
give the girls the favourable surroundings necessary to reformation. Sister
Bibby has given great attention to the Mother’s Meetings. Sister Reay, a
trained certificated nurse, gave the whole of her time to sick nursing; while
Sister Tebbutt found her sphere among the children, thus giving valuable aid'
to the Children’s Home Committee.
The Conference now thought it advisable to enlarge the sphere of the
Mission’s operations so as to embrace the work at Haymarket and Pyrmont.
With this object in view the Revs. John F. Orr and Ernest E. Crosby, 8.A.,.
were appointed to assist Mr. Taylor; Mr. Orr to have oversight at Pyrmont, andi
Mr. Crosby at Hay Street. To overcome the difficulty of Mr. Taylor’s ap-
pointment beyond the three years’ limit, Mr. Orr was to act nominally as Super-
intendent of the Circuit, while Mr. Taylor continued in charge of the Mission.
But this well-meant arrangement was a mistake, for it placed both Mr. Orr andi
Mr. Taylor in false positions. And it is difficult now to understand how the

Conference could sanction it. At the end of the first twelve months Mr.
Taylor was sent to England on his financial mission, being succeeded by the
Rev. Rainsford Bavin, who acted as Superintendent for three years. Mr. Bavin
had spent the greater part of his Ministry in New Zealand, where he had a wide
experience as Chairman of Districts, President of the Conference, and Super-
intendent of the most important Circuits. In New South Wales he had taken
charge successfully of William Street and Newtown Circuits, giving evidence of
the possession of gifts which qualified him to act as Mr. Taylor’s successor. Ihe
Rev. James Colwell succeeded Mr. Orr in the oversight of the work at
Pyrmont, rendering assistance in other ways ; while Hay Street was placed
under the care of Mr. Edward Hutchinson, the Senior Evangelist. The work
at the Hall was successfully carried out along the lines already indicated, while
the Branches developed. At the Sunday evening services these new places
were filled, brass bands were organised, and open air and social work was
prosecuted vigorously.
It was during Mr. Bavin’s Superintendency that the Children’s Home was
founded. The Evangelists and Sisters, particularly the latter, frequently came
across distressing cases of neglect among the children, for whom little or nothing
could be done, unless these neglected waifs and strays could be placed in the
midst of surroundings where at least they could be given a chance to a better
life. So seriously was Mrs. Bavin impressed, that she discussed the question
with several ladies, and the outcome was the determination to form the Chil-
dren’s Home. Preliminary arrangements were made, a Committee of Ladies
appointed, and in a house situated at Woolloomooloo Street, given rent free
by the Hon. E. Vickery, a commencement was made. The Home was formally
-opened on Tuesday, 31st October, 1893, by Mrs. J. E. Moulton, the wife of the
President of the Conference, when suitable addresses were given by several
Ministers the Home was inspected, afternoon tea was provided, and with much
■enthusiasm and great promise of success the work was inaugurated. The aim
of the Home was to rescue neglected and perishing children, the work to be
conducted by Christian women, to be broad and unsectarian in its character,


and to be carried on without incurring debt. An Executive Committee of 24
ladies was appointed by the General Committee to take sole management of
the business with their own officers and banking account, the Committee to
report twice a year to the General Committee through the Ladies’ Auxiliary.
Mrs. Thomas Cowlishaw was appointed President, a position she has continu-
ously filled with conspicuous success ; Mrs. Bavin and Sister Francis were the
Secretaries, and Mrs. F. W. Warren, Treasurer. The representatives on the
Committee and its officers have undergone change from time to time, but the
Committee has always been strong and representative and loyal to its duties.
At once the Home captured the practical sympathy of the people, and in addi
tion to being one of the most blessed, it has also been one of the most success-
ful features of the Mission. The Ladies’ Committee, for their persistent
efforts and wise management, deserves the highest praise. They have always
had a balance in hand on the working expenses, and their management is char-
acterised by economy, capability and the spirit of Him who said, “ Suffer the
little children to come unto Me.” The Committee soon found that if this work
were to be carried on successfully it must have a suitable home in one of the
suburbs, and though it was not quite clear how this was to be secured, it was
hoped the way would open. But when God calls and His servants obey, ob-
stacles thought to be insurmountable, suddenly vanish. And it was so here.
On the Parramatta Road at Croydon stood a fine and spacious home known as
“ Dalmar,” standing in four acres of ground. This property was for sale, and
the Committee rose to the occasion and purchased it for the sum of ;£ißoo. To
this amount a considerable sum was added for repairs and alterations ; and in
January, 1899, the children were removed from Woolloomooloo to their new
home. The day was wet and uncomfortable, but that detracted little from
the pleasure caused by their new surroundings. “ May we stay here always ? ”
and “Is this our Home ? ” the poor little things asked in rapid succession. And
when assured in the affirmative their gratitude and delight were overwhelming.
In March, 1900, the New Home was formally opened by Lady Renwick in the
presence of a large and influential gathering, the Ministers being well repre-
sented, as the opening took place during the Conference Sessions. At the
same time a fancy fair was held, bringing satisfactory help to the finances.
During the first year in the new Home the Committee was able to reduce the
debt of £7OO on the building by the sum of £2OO, to pay for alterations and
additions, and to carry on the work successfully.
The internal management of the Home is under the charge of a House Com-
mittee, consisting of the Officers and three members of the Committee elected
every three months. This Committee meets every Tuesday morning to consider
all cases for admission, applications for the adoption of the children, and to
transact the business of the Home. The General Committee meets at “ Dal-
mar ” the first Tuesday in each month. During its nine years’ existence, about
eighty children have been admitted to the Home ; and of these, fifty-six have
either been adopted into good families, returned to their parents, or sent to good
situations as domestic servants. The elder girls are trained in domestic duties
and assist in house work, and the boys attend the Public School and work in
the garden. The spiritual welfare of the children receives careful oversight.


Applications for admission are numerous, and in some cases the details are
deplorably sad. Only those who attend the House Committee meetings and
are familiar with the darkest side of City life are aware of the pressing need of
this work, and the sorrowful lives of many children in the slums. Scantily
clothed, sometimes found lying on a few bags in a foul room, their days spent
in begging or in carrying beer from the nearest hotel, living daily in an atmos-
phere vitiated with drunkenness, impurity, and the most degrading forms of sin,
what can their future be, if the State or the Church does not rescue them ? Many
of these waifs have been placed in Methodist Homes surrounded by the gracious
influences there so often happily found. Illustrations could be given if space
were available. Two only shall be named. Sister Tebbutt found a baby girl
in a dirty state sitting on the ground. When washed, the girl was seen to be
covered with sores caused by neglect; and, suffering from “ rickets ” she was
unable to stand. After ten days in Prince Alfred Hospital she entered the
Home, and is now a strong, healthy child, quite the pet of the household. There
was also the case of a boy so weak and ill from neglect and starvation, that he
was taken to the Children’s Hospital and thence to the Home. For a time he
suffered from bronchitis and debility, but now he makes the Home bright by
his merry chatter. “No one,” says the report, “ who saw him now could recog-
nise the little baby so treated by his inhuman mother, whose only anxiety was to
get rid of him.” Another child, a baby a few days old, was found on a door-step,
and taken to the Home. That boy is now happy in a Methodist home in the
country.
The last Report (1901-2) says:—“We will leave our readers to judge if
any good is done by our work. During the past year, eight children have been
admitted and nine have been adopted or have gone to situations, leaving twenty-
four in the Home. We have had to refuse several cases of boys who are above
our age limit. The Committee hope that the time is not far distant when they
will be able to erect a separate building for boys. When that is accomplished,
many cases such as are now refused could be dealt with, and the sphere of the
work widened. . . Knowing that there are numberless little waifs aid strays
in our midst, who are daily and hourly suffering from cruelty and neglect, we
would, in conclusion, ask for a continuance of your past favours, sympathy and
prayers, so that during the coming year we may persevere with our feeble ef-
forts to alleviate the sorrows of such little ones, knowing that there are kind
friends ready and willing to help us in our work.” The Report also expresses
the thanks of the Committee for the generous help afforded during the year,
special mention being made of Mr. William White, who for a period of eight
and a-half years, supplied the Home with bread free of charge, a gift equal to a
donation of £460; and to Mrs. English, who had collected the sum of £29 55.,
chiefly in weekly penny subscriptions. The Sabbath Schools had also assisted
by means of a yearly subscription, while some had taken collecting boxes, and
others had shown their sympathy by clothing one of the children. The Com-
mittee closed its report with the hint that the following things are always
needed:—Tapioca, Sugar, Soap, Treacle, Rice, Sago, Coal, Stockings, Oatmeal,
Jam and Boots.

Mr. Bavin having now completed his term of three years, he was succeeded
by the Rev. W. Woolls Rutledge, who was Superintendent for two years, when
he was succeeded by the Rev. W. G. Taylor, who continues in charge. The
Rev. John K. Turner was Mr. Rutledge’s colleague. For a time Mr. Taylor
worked single-handed, as Hay Street and Pyrmont were cut off by the Confer-
ence of 1900, but the work being too arduous for one man, he was afforded an
Assistant in 1901, and the Rev. H. C. J. Foreman, 8.A., became his colleague.
During the Superintendency of Mr. Rutledge, another important develop-
ment took place and the Medical Retreat was founded. “In the year 1896,”
says Mr. Rutledge, “ the fact that a number of persons connected with the Cen-
tral Mission had been rescued from drunkenness and converted to God, through
the instrumentality of the Mission, and that others had been saved from the sin
of gambling, led me to form what was afterwards known as the ‘ Converted
Drunkards’ and Gamblers’ Brigade.’ These men were anxious to rescue their
fellows from the evil habits which had enslaved themselves for many years, and
bring them to a saving knowledge of Christ. Accordingly, numerous meetings
were held in the Centenary Hall, and in some of the Churches. The ‘ Brigade,’
either in the halls loaned for the purpose, or in the open-air meetings at the
street corners, proclaimed the mighty power of Jesus to save the people from
their sins.
“ In a great many cases men were induced to sign the pledge, and in others
the deeper work of conversion resulted ; but the work taken in hand recalled
the necessity for the establishment of a Home, into which the men could be
received, and by means of which they could be removed from the almost over-
powering temptations to which they would again be immediately exposed. In-
quiries with a view of renting premises were made, and, in a few cases, owners
of house properties were approached, but without success. Attention was also
directed towards a ‘ Retreat ’ for Inebriates situated within a short distance of
the City, but negotiations were resultless. Just at this juncture, providentially,
as it would appear, I was enabled to secure the formulas of a course of treatment
for inebriates, etc., which had for several years elsewhere been successful in
rescuing drunkards from the power of the demon alcohol. Accordingly, after
searching enquiry and satisfactory proofs, I submitted the matter to the Com-
mittee of the C.M.M. After much anxious and earnest consideration had been
given to the subject, it was decided to make the experiment. A gentleman,
who had many times before laid the Mission under deep obligation by his
munificence, placed at the disposal of the Committee, for a term, rent free, ex-
tensive premises in a suitable locality.” The inaugural meeting was held in
the Centenary Hall, February 22nd, 1897, and the next day the first patient was
received at 6 St. Mary’s Terrace, Lower Domain.
This is not the place in which to discuss the drink question in its varied
aspects, but it may not be superfluous to state that habitual indulgence in alco-
holic liquor and narcotics creates a condition of the human system which may be
called diseased. To imprison these diseased people, is not a reformative pro-
cess, it is little short of crime. To trust to their ultimate reformation by the
force and sway of good resolutions or the exercise of will power is useless.


They have no will power. With vital powers impaired, the capabilities of re-
sistance minimised, and the bodily functions deranged, the unfortunate victim
drifts into a condition technically termed dipsomania, in which he is at the mercy
of an uncontrollable desire for drink. Nervous decay generally follows, and
the helpless victim glides downward to insanity or to a drunkard’s perdition. Now
the question frequently before the Mission workers was this: Can salvation from
this disease be found? To that question the Central Mission Medical Retreat
replies; “To all , whether periodical or perpetual drinkers, we say: ‘We can
entirely remove this appetite of craving, by eradicating the cause, and leave you
as free as you were before you began to contract this habit, provided you really
wish to be cured.’ ”
How is this accomplished? hirst, by a 'purely vegetable cure which stands
apart by itself upon its own record of achieved success. The “ cure ”is effected
by means of a thorough course of medication, continuing for at least three
weeks. Ihe treatment is administered hypodermically four times a day, viz.,
at 8 a.m, 12 noon, 4 p.m, and 7.30 p.m, alternating with tonics as directed. The
medicine given contains no drug that will create an appetite for itself. When
the treatment is over the patient stops taking the medicine without any incon-
venience whatever. On the contrary the invariable testimony of patients is that
the general health is built up and strengthened to an extent that has been as
gratifying as surprising.” Ihe Retreat receives persons of either sex, who are
treated with every kindness and courtesy. Liquor patients are supplied as often
as they desire with the best brands of spirits or beer upon their arrival at the
Institute ; after the second or third day the desire begins to lessen, and even-
tually it leaves them altogether. There is no restraint of personal liberty, and
it is possible to arrange for treatment outside the Retreat, though this is not
recommended. Persons addicted to opium, morphine or cocaine habits, are
treated with satisfactory results, and the greatest privacy is maintained ; the
whole appointments of the Home being those of a better class boarding estab-
lishment. The treatment is duly administered by a duly qualified medical
officer —Dr. McClelland, late Medical Superintendent of Sydney Hospital
and a trained nurse as Administrator; and the Retreat, which has been removed
to the Warren Heights, Tempe, is within the reach of all sufferers of whatsoever
calling, creed or circumstance.
At first the Committee moved with cautious step, refraining from making
extensive announcements until the value of the system employed had been
practically tested. But now publicity is sought for an institution whose work
has already been attested by permanent results. Leading professional men, on
behalf of the Government Inspector, reported favourably on the Retreat on 3rd
July, 1901, Mr. Taylor having made application for a license under the pro-
visions of the Inebriates Act of 1900. As this was the first application made
under the Act, Mr. Maxted gave particular attention to all the important con-
ditions surrounding it. The results of the treatment had been, he said, as satis-
factory as could be expected. The buildings were in good order, the rooms
were well furnished, the treatment of the inmates liberal, humane and homelike

and in view of the “ foregoing conditions ”he was of the opinion that the prem-
ises known as ‘ Cathona,’ situated at the corner of Harrow Road and Liberty
Street, Stanmore, may be properly licensed in accordance with the provisions of
the Inebriates Act of 1900, as required by the Rev. W. G. Taylor on behalf
of the Central Methodist Mission.”
The Government Committee of Advice, consisting of the Hon. Dr. J. M.
Creed, the Hon. E. W. O’Sullivan, Minister for Works, and Mr. P A. Rabett,
also reported favourably. “We recommend,” this Committee said, “ that the
license be granted, and have arrived at our conclusions on the following grounds:
—That the same authorities have successfully carried on for six years an In-
stitution for the treatment of inebriates in St. Mary’s Terrace, Woolloomooloo,
and that they have removed to these premises as being preferable. That we
are of opinion that an Institution of this character is much in the nature of a
well-conducted boarding house, with the precaution that alcohol is not permitted
on the premises, except under medical prescription, and that the inmates are
under legal compulsion to be governed by certain rules. Under these circum-
stances we do not see any necessity for the prevention of the ordinary associ-
ation of men and women as in common life. We add that we think such
association is not only not an evil, but will probably be an aid to the recovery
of the patients.”
The Retreat has already commended itself to the Medical fraternity, many
of whom send their patients there, and to the public as one of the most sensible
and humanitarian movements of the day. “In numerous instances absolute
cures have been effected where the sufferer had passed absolutely beyond the
reach of either moral or punitive influence. It is hard, therefore, to imagine


any work more worthy of a Christian Church than that of cultivating this agency
of reform, which offers to its hand the key of the most degrading moral fetters
by which mortals can be bound.”— {Daily Telegraph, December 16, 1897.)
Testimonials from 350 persons who have entered the Retreat, bound as with
fetters, and who have left it completely delivered from the galling thraldom of
strong drink, have been received. The Committee courts enquiry, and appeals
to all who love this work to make the benefits of the Institution known
far and wide. An employer in one of the largest retail houses in Sydney
writes:—“ I can speak in the highest terms of the results obtained by your In-
stitute. Four cases of men who were absolutely unable to abstain from taking
alcoholic liquors have been treated at your Home. Three of them have been
drunkards for years, pronounced incurable ; the fourth case had ten bouts of
drunkenness in 18 months. All the men I speak of held good positions and
lost them entirely owing to the influence of drink. Three of them were prac-
tically at starvation point, and I was induced to give them a chance in my employ
at nominal wages. All of them are now in important positions in my business
and have never given me the slightest cause for anxiety. They tell me that
they never have any desire to taste drink again.” A Sydney firm of timber mer-
chants writes:—“ With regard to the two men we sent to you. We have much
pleasure in stating that one man has been fourteen months, and the other five,
since they left your Institute, and during that time neither has touched a drop of
drink, as they freely state they have no inclination for same. Both men occupy
responsible positions in our firm.” “ Morning, noon, and night I thank God for
a merciful deliverance from the drink demon, through the agency of your Insti-
tute. It is now ten months ago that I underwent treatment at your hands, since
which I have revelled in the sense of freedom from the unspeakable horrors of
alcoholic craving,” writes a Clergyman. “ I might write volumes of the direct
results to myself of the treatment, and then but inadequately express my perfect
faith and absolute belief in its efficacy and force. You have my free and full
consent to refer anyone interested direct to me,” says an Editor after three
years’ deliverance. “lam at present in splendid health,” says a well-known
Sydney warehouseman, “ and the will power, which I had lost completely, has
returned in full force, and, to put the whole thing in a nutshell, Sir, ‘ I am my
own man again,’ lam glad to say; and with God’s help, Sir, I shall so continue.”
“ I am so glad that I went through your treatment at the Medical Institute, and
I can now truthfully say that, 1 am thoroughly cured of the habit of drunken-
ness. I thoroughly loathe the idea of liquor now,” enthusiastically writes a
gentleman highly connected. And so on from ladies, Clergymen, solicitors,
business men, hotel-keepers and artisans. There have been cases of failure
with some who have entered the Retreat. But the fault has not been in the
system or the method of cure. Every case of failure has arisen through the
inmates refusing to abide loyally by the rules of the Institution. While pro-
fessing to long for freedom they have been surreptitiously strengthening the
habits from which they pretented to seek deliverance.

It will be remembered that the original programme of the Mission oper-
ations included a Home for Friendless and Fallen Women. But after the lapse
of many years Mr. Taylor writes:—“ In this report we have emphasised the pain-
ful need that exists for the early establishment of a ‘ Home for Friendless and
Fallen Women.’ During the past year several girls have professed conversion
at our meetings. At once has come the question, ‘ What can we do for them ? ’
There are certain homes in this City these girls will not enter, and we can
scarcely blame them. We must have a home of our own. Already we see our
way to a suitable Matron, and to the necessary workers. The sum of £2OO
per year would give us an admirable start. We are profoundly convinced that the
Christian Church is not at present realising its responsibility as it touches the
fearful increase of the social evil amongst us.”- —( Report , 1898.)
But in December, 1902, Mr. Taylor saw the desire of his heart and was satis-
fied. At Burwood Heights, in Lindsay Street, within easy distance of the Burwood
Railway Station, stands a fine commodious villa, within pretty and extensive
grounds, containing about a dozen spacious and splendidly-ventilated rooms, in
addition to kitchen, extensive laundry and outhouses. This property the
Committee purchased from the Savings Bank for i 11,600, on terms which were
considered most advantageous. The property, which is capable of enlargement,
to any extent, is worth £2,000 at the lowest estimate. The capital debt has
already been reduced to below A 1,000, and additions to the Home have been
carried out at a cost of £2OO, which has all been met; while the furnishing
also, at the cost of another £2OO, has been paid for.
The Home provides accommodation for 20 girls, though the Committee
hopes to double the accommodation as funds permit. The inmates find employ-
ment in washing, ironing, flower growing, sewing, curtain dressing and dress-
making, the latter branch being in charge of a city dressmaker who volunteered
to transfer her plant to the Home and there continue her business. A capable
Matron was found in Miss May Davies, with Miss Salmon as working Matron,
and Sister Nellie, who deals directly with the unfortunate girls for whose benefit
the Home has been opened. In this work she has been most successful, and
her influence has been marvellous. In two weeks she induced six girls to for-
sake their life of shame, and drew them away from their undesirable surroundings
to reinstate them in respectable homes. The Home was made a necessity for
several reasons. Other houses were in greater part full, some were notoriously
unpopular, and it was necessary that the hand that took the girl from the gutter
should take her on to a sure footing. There are thousands of girls of this
unfortunate class wandering on the streets of Sydney, with whom the Mission
agents are continuously brought in contact. Bhe Home, named after her
Majesty the Queen, is known as the “ Alexandra Girls’ Home,” and is open to
young girls of all, or any persuasion. Ihe open door policy has been followed.
No high fences surround the place, but the forces of love and kindly counsel are
brought to bear upon the girls to induce them to remain in what is sought to be
made a home of practical Christianity. So far this policy has proved a wise one.
The opening ceremony was performed by Lady Rawson, accompanied by
Major Holman, A.D.C., on Saturday afternoon, December 7, 1902, where she

was received by Mr. Taylor and welcomed by a number of Ministers and laymen.
In declaring the Institution open, Lady Rawson said that “ every woman saved
and restored to her proper place in Society by means of the Home would be a
living memorial that the Home had not been opened in vain.” The Revs.
W. H. Beale and J. Woolnough also addressed the gathering, the latter referring
to the interest with which the Home was regarded in the country Circuits. A
sale of work was held during the afternoon, the Mission Band and Orchestra
performed at intervals, and thus was launched the latest addition to the many
organisations assisting to make up that complex body everywhere favourably
known as the Central Methodist Mission.

NEWINGTON COLLEGE, STANMORE


CHAPTER XXL
EDUCATIONAL ESTABLISH MEM LS.
NEWINGTON COLLEGE.
IN educational, as in other matters, the early Missionaries followed the ex-
ample of Wesley and his Assistants. It will be remembered that one of
Wesley s first measures was the founding’ of a seminary at Kingswood, the
corner stone of which was laid by Whitefield ; who, kneeling upon the
ground, surrounded by reclaimed and weeping miners, prayed that “ the gates of
hell might not prevail against it. Wesley raised the building through funds
given by his followers or reserved from his College Fellowship, while the pious
Lady Maxwell rendered great assistance by her generous deeds. When the de-
sign was first mentioned to her she gave Wesley £SOO towards it, and some time
afterwards liquidated an accumulated debt of T3OO. The Spartan discipline of
this School did not hinder its success, nor did it save its founder from vexatious
embarrassments ; but through it all the School struggled to success, and to-day
bears an honourable name among the educational establishments in the
Methodist world. Three years after Wesley’s death Kingswood was appro-
priated exclusively to the sons of Ministers, and has since bpen used only for
that purpose. This decision of a far distant Conference links Kingswood
School with Australian public life ; for boys trained there have since become
Presidents or Masters at Newington College and other Australian Public
Schools.
The British Conference of 1838, contemplating the adoption of a general
plan of education, a special Educational Committee was appointed, and the
question came before the New South Wales District Meeting in September,
1 839. Though in accordance with the sentiments expressed by the Conference
the District Meeting could not see its way further than repeating the substance
of the resolution of its last annual Meeting, to the effect that a school should
be established at each principal station, “ to be conducted upon truly Wesleyan
principles.” To secure this end a General Committee was appointed, the Com-
mittee comprising all the Preachers in the District and the following gentle-
men:—Messrs. Bowden, Iredale, Jones, Matthews, Munce, Weiss, J. Byrnes,
J. Hamilton, Lane, Cotton, and Crofton. Several schools were organised in
Sydney and the country. In the year 1840 the Wesleyan Grammar School was
“ commenced under encouraging conditions ” ; but it was relinquished for a
time owing to the Master accepting a Government position. For six years the
Day Schools flourished with varying degrees of success, being supported by
a Government grant issued under certain regulations. But in 1844 the Colonial
Secretary informed the Superintendent, the Rev. John McKenny, that Govern-
ment aid would be withdrawn after January Ist, 1845, and the whole of the


schools would be referred to District Councils for assistance. The Legislative
Council appointed a Select Committee to take evidence on the state of Educa-
tion in the Colony, as well as the best means of meeting its wants. Mr.
McKenny, with many other Ministers and laymen, was examined by the Com-
mittee, and the District Meeting resolved to adopt efficient means for watching
the progress of educational questions before the Legislature, with a view to
securing the just claims of the Connexion in the grants made to the Denomina-
tional School system, which was afterwards adopted.
By this system the Wesleyan Church received the sum of £$ JO as a grant
during the year 1849. The Romish Church received a very much larger sum,
but that was not sufficient to satisfy the advocates of a Church which has
always been ready to appropriate the public funds to advance its own interests.
The Rev. J. McEnroe, a Romish priest, addressed a letter to the members of
the Legislative Council claiming a larger proportion of the funds voted for
education, with a corresponding reduction in the grant to Wesleyan Schools.
But the Rev. W. B. Boyce, who was then General Superintendent, was not the
man to allow such an appeal to pass unnoticed. He therefore followed this
letter with another in which he voiced the feelings of the Church. While alto-
gether dissenting from the principle applied, he would not submit to an unfair
division of the funds. “ Some stand,” said Mr. Boyce, “ must be made against
ecclesiastical assumption and extravagant claims in secular matters, and we
think that the stand might as well be made here.” No money, continued Mr.
Boyce, “ has been more wisely and economically expended than this paltry
sum of T570, which enables us to educate 1,657 children at an average cost of
6s. 1 id. per head, when the average cost of the children in the Denominational
Schools generally is about 20s. per head. . . . We challenge examination
as to the character of our schools.” Mr. McEnroe did not get his way this
time, and the Denominational system, with its questionable aid, flourished
until Sir Henry Parkes smote it so sorely that it practically passed out of sight.
Meanwhile the idea had been gaining ground that New South Wales
Methodism needed a Higher Class School, after the manner of Horton College
and the Methodist College at Belfast. The Legislative Assembly having passed
the College Partial Endowment Act, the question assumed prominence. This
Act made provision for the establishment of Colleges affiliated to the Univer-
sity, to receive an extensive grant of land, £ 10,000 towards the erection of a
building to cost not less than £20,000, and the annual payment of £SOO towards
the salary of a Principal. The Wesleyans sought to avail themselves of this
offer by erecting an affiliated College to be called Wesley College. In July,
1857, a meeting was held in York Street Chapel, with the Governor, Sir William
Denison, in the chair. The meeting was one of great unanimity and enthusiasm,
and the sum of 15s. was promised, including a subscription of £2O per
annum from His Excellency. But the scheme did not commend itself to the
public generally. “It was,” says the Rev. J. H. Fletcher, “ a noble project, and
nobly taken up, though few persons now will much regret its failure. For the
College pre-supposes the School, and to begin with the College would certainly

be premature.”— {Sermons, Addresses, and Essays, p. 173.) The subscriptions
promised towards Wesley College were almost, without exception, transferred
to another scheme —the establishment of a Collegiate Institution, first advocated
by the Rev. John Allen Manton. The project was brought before the District
Meeting in 1862 by Mr. Manton, and being approved by that Meeting and the
Committee of Education, was sanctioned by the Conference of 1863, and duly
carried into effect. So that “ out of the ruin of those fair blossoms of the
spring-time of Methodist liberality in this Colony, gradually emerged the Insti-
tution which now . . . has been planted at Newington.”
In making known his proposal to the public Mr. Manton said: “ I. It is
proposed that the Institution be designated ‘ The New South Wales Wesleyan
Collegiate Institution.’ 2. That its general supervision be entrusted to the
Wesleyan Educational Committee for the New South Wales District. 3. That
the president of the Institution be a Wesleyan Minister appointed by the Con-
ference. 4. Although the Institution will be decidedly Wesleyan in its charac-
ter, it shall be open to the sons of parents of all religious denominations. 5. The
course of study to embrace all the branches of a sound Commercial, Classical,
and Mathematical Education. 6. The Education Fees, 50 guineas per annum,
Washing 4 guineas, and Medical attendance one guinea per annum, payable
quarterly in advance. Six weeks’ notice of the removal of a Student required
or half a quarter’s fees will be charged. Each pupil to take with him one silver
fork and spoon, two pairs of sheets, two pillow cases, and six towels, all to be
marked with the owner’s name in full. Each Student will have a separate bed.
The Dietary will be upon the most liberal scale. 7. No pupil will be eligible
for admission who is not able to read the New Testament with facility. 8. That
for the present, a building suitable for such an Establishment be hired, g. That
the friends of Education be solicited to subscribe to a fund (to the amount
of £2,000) for furnishing such building, and other expenses incidental to the
commencement of the Institution, and that the Subscribers shall have the first
claim for the admission of their sons to the Institution, beginning with the
donor of the largest sum, and so on, downwards. In case a subscriber have
no son .to send, he shall have the right of transferring his claim to any other whom
he may please to name, whose son shall be admitted by virtue of the sub-
scription so given.” The Editors add “ there is now an opportunity afforded us
of establishing an Institution that will be really serviceable and immediately
serviceable. We commend the above proposal to such of our readers as are
able to promote it.”—( Advocate, vol. 111., p. 129.)
The first duty of the Committee was to find a suitable spot for the School,
and this they succeeded in doing at Newington House, facing the Parramatta
River. Being unable to purchase the property they leased it for a number of
years. “It is seen at its best from the bend of the river near the Pennant
Hills wharf. It looks pleasantly out from between the trees, seated with some
stateliness on a natural platform that commands the whole sweep of the river
from the orange gardens of Pennant Hills to the slimy reaches of Duck River
and the last bend of the river towards Parramatta.”— (Newingtonian, vol. 1.,

p. 22.) The vicissitudes of this place afford matter for an entertaining novel.
Built by John Blaxland, a wealthy squatter, in the year 1832, it became the
home of the Blaxlands, a cultured and hospitable family, where, to quote Mr.
Fletcher again, “ distinguished guests and gay parties gathered for many years,
then abandoned for a time to butchers and their families —the old kitchen
turned into a piggery and the fine dining-room into a barn. Then came our
turn, and after putting the old Home into thorough repair, schoolboys and
masters clothed the desolate mansion with new life for fifteen years.”
The House was renovated at a cost of £ 1,200, absorbing at once nearly
all the subscriptions. The Committee was allowed to spend the five years
rent in restoration and improvements. The place was thus made a respectable
domicile for about sixty boys and young men, with accommodation for masters
and servants. “ The decayed outbuildings would easily give shelter to a regi-
ment of soldiers. On the ground an old Church supplies school room for week
day and Church for Sunday, when persons employed in the neighbourhood
join us in worship.” The Rev. John Allen Manton was appointed President in
April, 1863, and in the following July the School was opened with ig boarders.
“ We nineteen miserable boys,” to borrow the words of Dr. Andrew Houison,
the first boy, “ not one of us knowing another, met together in one of the large
rooms. Mrs. Manton received and took charge of us in her motherly way,
and during the first quarter under her influence a homely feeling grew upon us,
and we settled down to our work.” On celebrating its first anniversary The
Christian Advocate wrote: ‘‘The College is no longer a theory and a prob
lem, but a fact. A single year has crowned it with success beyond the anticipa-
tions of its most ardent supporters. . . . Only the other day as it seems
we laid the memorial stone of our educational temple, in the certain hope that
the temple would rise. Why should we conceal our satisfaction that it is ris-
ing, that difficulties have been fairly met, and already effectually mastered, that
our extensive outlay, and consequent responsibility are not likely to end in
embarrassment and failure ; that without Legislative endowment, and without


distinguished patronage we have secured one of the most valuable estates for
the purposes in the Colony, an efficient staff of tutors, recommended from their
icspective Colleges at home, a considerable roll of intelligent and promising
students and applicants for further admissions beyond our present means of
accommodation.’—(Vol. 111., p. 43.) At the end of September, 1864, the num-
ber of scholars had increased to fifty with two Theological Students, generally
known as “ Divinities.” *
The Rev. J. A. Manton, the first President, “ not only inherited
a name of honoured Puritan memories, but cherished a love of learn-
ing, and a desire to promote education worthy of the name.” Mr. Manton was
born in 1807 at Biggleswade (Hertfordshire). Converted when 15 years of
age, a Local Preacher at 18, in 1831 he was accepted as a Missionary, and
arrived in Sydney in August of the same year. Next year he went to Tas-
mania, and at the Penal Settlement of Port Arthur did such valuable work
amongst the convicts that he received special recognition from the authorities.
In 1855 to him was assigned the arduous task of establishing Horton College,
built on the site given by Captain Horton. Notwithstanding initial difficulties
the College became a success. Two years later he was elected President of the
third Australian Conference, returning to New South Wales in 1859. When
the Education Committee of 1863 sought a President for the Institution about
to be established in New South Wales all eyes turned to Mr. Manton, and
the success of Newington “was beyond the anticipation of its most sanguine
friends, attributable in a very large degree to the reputation and ability ” of
Mr. Manton. He took profound interest in the higher education of youth.
“ His name may never be read on monumental marble, but we need no marble
for a name that must live in the memories and affections of immortal souls.”—
{Advocate, vol. HI., p. 90.) On the 9th September, 1864, Mr. Manton’s work
was finished. Failing health, followed by complications, made alarming inroads
on his shattered constitution. FI is last thoughts were for his work and his
Saviour. Pathetically charging those around him to do something for the
* Dr. Andrew Houison, who was Dux of the School on the 26th October, 1865,
amused himself on the Thursday of that date by writing on the fly-leaf of his History
of Rome a list of the boys then at Newington House. The following is the entry:
“A. Houison ( Dux ), G. Muir, H. Higman, M. Love, H. Gorman, F. Myers, J. Fletcher,
F. Piper, W. Allen, W. O’Reilly, H. Richardson, J. Waterhouse, H. Hebblewhite, T.
Moore, vV. Wren, C. Oram, J. Crofton, G. Hurst, A. Oakes, P. De Mestre, W. Oakes,
A. Golledge, C. West, J. Kendall, J. R. Glasson, H. Fletcher, W. Reeve, G. Mills, E.
Evans, G. Wilkinson, W. % Simpson, F. Speer, H. Tcbbutt, H. Taylor, T. Small, J.
Dawson, H. Brady, H. Wren, W. Wren, W. Oliver, J. Graham, A. Graham, A. Edrop,
E. Pryce, A. Amos, H. Myers, J. Moore, S. Moore, H. Hodgkinson, H. Glasson, E.
Vickery, J. O’Reilly, W. Neill, C. Pryce, A. Kendall, M. Kendall, J. Gibbons, J.
Venters, W. Dawson, H. Winterline, G. Merry, A. Merry, E. Byrnes, Williams.”
The Theological Students were:—J. S. Austin, K. A. Corner, Adin Parsons, Job
Trotter, and Belford. Dr. Houison has also preserved an account of a “ row ”
among the school boys. When Mr. Creed detained the boys as a punishment for miscon-
duct they retaliated by blowing out the candles and letting loose a number of frogs.
For this freak they were brought before Mr. Johnstone, who gave them a lecture on
“ blowing out candles and bringing in frogs.” To give this lecture lasting impression
the culprits, who had already “ owned up to their sins,” were made to write out the
Indicative Mood of a Latin verb 50 times. The sentence was recorded on Tuesday
afternoon; at seven o’clock the next morning Houison had completed the task, to the
amazement of Mr. Johnstone.


boys, with a last word, “ Oh wondrous grace, saved at last,” he fell on sleep,
having seen fifty-eight years of life, and thirty-five in the Ministry. • At his
death the big Newfoundland dog howled the night through, a fact which
stamped itself on the boys’ memory. His body was carried to the Parramatta
Cemetery, preceded by the College students, when the Rev. S. Rabone read
the burial service, and the Rev. Ralph Mansfield, an old friend, gave an address ;
and thus was laid to rest the body of the first President of the College. The
Committee made temporary arrangements for the continuance of his work,
the President, Rev. Stephen Rabone, acting as College President, and a Com-
mittee of Finance assisting in the accounts. The Rev. George Hurst gave
lectures on Theology to the Divinity students, and Mrs. Manton remained at
Newington until the following April. The Committee also placed on record its
high appreciation of Mr. Manton’s services.
Mr. Thomas Johnstone was the first Head Master. Though an excellent
teacher, Mr. Johnstone was handicapped as the result of an accident which had
deprived him of a leg. But he found a substitute in a wooden leg, a circum-
stance which the boys considered particularly fortunate, as it gave them timely
warning of his approach. Mr. Johnstone was assisted by the Rev. James Egan
Moulton, and Mr. Joseph Coates, to whom reference will be made later. Mr.
Metcalfe came next, to be followed by Dr. Howe, who filled the post for seven
and a half years and then retired, to be succeeded by Mr. Coates. Dr. Howe
was a graduate of Trinity College, Dublin, coming to Australia to fill a position
at Wesley College, Melbourne. His career at Dublin University was a dis-
tinguished one. To those willing to receive he gave freely and ungrudgingly of
his ample stores of philology, and not a few of the most successful scholars
passing from Newington to the University were indebted to him for their clas-
sical training. He died on the 3 r d of August, 1884. d here are many memories
associated with Newington House which the “ old boys ” fondly recall at
their reunions. For example, they speak of old Monk the gardener; and of
the housekeepers, Miss Gilligan, Miss Rabone, and Miss Normington, kindly
souls, always sympathetic with the boys in their troubles. They recall Dr.
Howe with his Irish accent, and how he once told some transgressor: “We’ll
have an investigaretion in the marning” And they speak of the night when the
Doctor was “ doused ” by two of their number at a waterfight, the Doctor being
mistaken for the enemy; of the great bonfires on Queen’s birthday, when
°ads of sweet tea tree ” were piled up twenty or thirty feet high to
be fired by the President’s wife ; of the cottage owned by Mother Tyler, whither
the little boys resorted to exchange their pence for sweetmeats, and the bigger
boys “to spoon a little with the nymph with the chestnut locks,” who allowed
her favourites to buy on credit and enter the amount on the slate themselves ;
of the palm-tree in front of the House thoughtfully provided by a kind Provi-
dence to enable the boys to make midnight raids on the apple trees ; of the
pillow fight, “ when some twenty lively boys in fluttering night-shirts
just at the breaking of the day, were driven to cover by the appearance of
the President; and, last of all, of the cricket matches between “Lyceum,” or

the Upper School, and Portico, or the Lower School; and of the shooting
matches, when the boys beat the 18th Royal Irish, and later still the non-com-
missioned officers from the Prince’s ship, The Galatea.
Mr. Manton was succeeded by the Rev. Joseph Horner Fletcher, the oldest
son of the Rev. Joseph Fletcher, a Missionary to the West Indies. From his
home at Grenada, in which Methodism was a name of renown and in which
he on his Father s side sterling sincerity and uprightness, and on his
Mothers culture and scholarship, he was sent in 1830 to Wesley’s famous school
at Kmgswood, where he remained for seven years. “ Here, under a system of
diet and discipline worthy of an old monastery, many a now useful man remem-
bers how he plodded his weary way through the grim gates of classic learning,”
assisted, we may add, by numerous birchings, for which Kingswood was then
famous. —(Biographical Sketch , p. 10.) He was then transferred to his Uncle’s
school at Bath, “ one of the principal schools in that aristocratic city.” This
Uncle, the son of the Rev. William Horner, who was called into the work by
John Wesley, was not only a famous scholar and mathematician, but belonged
to a family of very superior intellectual gifts ; for the Horner’s were all more
or less witty, poetic, sensitive, and ambitious. At the death of his Uncle, he
entered into business for seven years, the crisis of his life coming when eighteen
years of age. Taking an active part in Church work he went as Assistant
Preacher at Dunster, and in 1845 was accepted by the Conference for Mission
work. Proceeding to Richmond Theological Institution he remained three


years, being afterwards appointed to New Zealand, where he arrived in April,
1849. He commenced, and for seven years had charge of the “Auckland Wes-
leyan College and Seminary,” standing on twelve acres of land purchased by
the Rev. Walter Lawry. He also engaged in Circuit work, and his term in
New Zealand closed amid the gloom and distraction of the Taranaki War.
The Conference of 1861, which met in Sydney, appointed him to Queensland,
and in April, 1865, he took over the duties as President of Newington House.
“ I am following,” Mr. Fletcher writes, “ in the footsteps of a truly good man,
John A. Manton, to whose zealous efforts this Australian Sheffield and Taunton
owes its existence. I am earnestly seeking to rise to meet the duties of this
conspicuous and difficult position. I do not believe that a Christian ought to
expect to be crushed by any duties which His Heavenly Father lays on him.
My Auckland experience will help me, and not less the experience
since I left Auckland.”
When Mr. Fletcher assumed control, Mr. Johnstone was still Head Master,
having as his Assistants, Mr. Coates, Mr. Creed, and Mr. E. Bickford with Mr.
Fairland as Drawing Master and Mr. Hardman as Drill Master. The work
proceeded steadily for several years, Dr. Howe succeeding Mr. Metcalfe, who
was in turn followed by Mr. Coates. Mr. Coates matriculated at London Uni-
versity from Huddersfield College (Eng.), winning the gold medal for History
and the Silver one for Classics. Before he had time to complete his studies
he was offered, and accepted, an Assistant Mastership at Newington. In 1872
he left the College, and after filling important positions under the Council of
Education visited England, returning to Newington in 1877 as Head Master.
He was a brilliant and popular left-handed cricketer, having many times cap-
tained the New South Wales team in intercolonial matches. Possessed of
great tact, making no enemies, a shrewd business man, and an able school
master, he had remarkable power in influencing boys, either collectively or
alone. And though a boy among boys when ungowned, he was a stern dis-
ciplinarian in school; a fact the boys thoroughly understood and respected. In
1883, Mr. Coates severed his connection with Newington to become Head Mas-
ter of the Sydney Public High School, holding the position until June, 1896.
Three months later he was struck down by paralysis, and a second attack
following soon after, he died peacefully September 9th of the same year.
Newington House now entered upon a period of great prosperity, and i!
could not well be otherwise when its management was in the hands of Mr.
Fletcher and Mr. Coates. Success became embarrassing, and it was soon made
clear that the Institution must move unless Newington House could be pur-
chased. This was not found practicable; and experience seemed to have
determined that a new building, erected for the special object, near the railway
and not too far from Sydney, must be secured as a permanent home. As no
house could be found suitable or spacious enough for the purposes without such
extensive alterations and additions as would cost more than the erection of a
new building, it was clear that the Committee must build. Where to build
was the problem which took the Conference some time to solve. But it was
solved at last, the solution being found, in the first place, by Mr. Edmund Webb,

of Bathurst, who first suggested the purchase of the Stanmore site, and after-
wards became a large contributor and constant friend ; and in the second place,
by Mr. John Jones, who left valuable property at Stanmore to be appropriated
for the furtherance of the cause of Wesleyan Methodism in the Colony of New
South Wales.”
On the recommendation of the Council of Management the pro-
posal was remitted to the District Meetings for approval, and was then sanc-
tioned by the Conference. “It was generally agreed that no object, could be
found large enough to represent Colonial and not merely local interests, and
permanent enough in its character to represent those interests for all time, that
was more worthy to be entrusted with this general bequest than the long pro-
jected College and Theological Institution.”—(Rev. J. H. Fletcher at Inaugural
Address , 1881.) The actual site of the College, including about four acres with
a cottage at the southern end, was obtained by purchase at a cost of £ 1,044
10s. In his Journal (June 21st, 1869) Mr. Fletcher wrote; “To-day our Council
took a very important step in resolving to buy the land at Stanmore adjoining


Jones’ estate.* My heart almost fails at the probably stupendous labour to be
accomplished in the next year and a half, if a College is erected there. But
faith in God removes mountains. I cannot but observe (i) that this step is
the necessary result of all the previous ones. The hand of my God placed me
here, and has for four years sustained me. We have been unable to buy this
place ; indeed, it has clearly appeared that we ought not. We have waited now
to the utmost limit of our time before seeking a site. That at Stanmore is the
only suitable one we have heard of, though looking out for years ; and (2) I
cannot but remark the unanimity of the large Council which met to-day. That
was one of the signs which I humbly asked of my God . . . let ‘ Jehovah
Jireh ’ be the motto of the Institution as well as of my history.”
To initiate the building fund a Public Breakfast was held in the Masonic
Hall on Tuesday, April 12th, when 200 persons were present, including a num-
ber of ladies. The chair was filled by the Rev. George Hurst, President of the
conference, and he was supported by the Ministers stationed in and around
Sydney, many city and country laymen, and thirty students from the College,
dhe Chairman crowned a lengthy speech with a promise of ASOO, and Mr.
Fletcher read the history of the movement up to date. Addresses were also
given by the Revs. William Curnow, William Moore, Ralph Mansfield, W.
Fletcher, 8.A., and Messrs. William Davies, and Edmund Webb, M.L.A. ’ The
sum of £2,000 12s. was realised, Mr. Webb giving ASOO, and expressing the
hope that his gift would enable the Council to do something more for the sons
of Ministers.
Having possession of this fine property, twenty acres in all, the Council of
Management proceeded cautiously. First accepting tenders for the earth work
and foundations, amounting to £2,58; they surrounded the entire property
with a substantial fence, planted a number of ornamental trees, placed a man
on the ground to look after the plantations, and the property was put in good
order. The sum of £4, qqq had now been spent, and but for the assistance
rendered by Mr. T. P. Reeve m the management of the rents it would have been
larger. Competitive designs now being in the hands of the Council, in January
1876 it called for tenders; Mr. Moon’s tender for stone work and brick work
including tower and educational rooms, omitting for the present sitting and
bedrooms m the farther wing, being accepted. But there was even then small
probability of the first and last portion of the College being erected under
£2OOOO, a vast increase in the cost of building material during the period of
si tat lon having taken place. “ Regarding,” wrote Mr. Fletcher, “the menu-

mental character of the structure, as the first Methodist doxology in stone for
the whole Colony, commemorative of the success which, during the first 63 years
of our Australian History, the God of our Fathers has given us, the Council
acceded to the earnest solicitations of the architect and chose the more costly,
but more enduring, and, in the end more economical material for the new
fabric.” The Council first thought to build of brick at a cost of but
the discovery of good building stone in the neighbourhood, together with Mr.
Rowe’s earnest persuasions prevailed, and bricks were used only for the interior
walls. To meet this extra demand Mr. Fletcher said: “We hope during the
next three or four years to raise £ 10,000, and the remainder we intend to bor-
row, the interest representing a rent charge on the building.” But this was
not done, for though several friends responded liberally the majority turned a
deaf ear as they had already done in connection with the Jubilee Fund, the
remembrance of which doubtless prompted Mr. Fletcher to point his appeal
thus; “If there survive among us any glowing embers of that flame of grati-
tude and hope which found so much devout expression, but so little substantial
embodiment in our Jubilee demonstration.”
In May, 1878, the building being raised to the first floor, six memorial
stones were laid on the 18th by the following gentlemen: —The Rev. Gervase
Smith, D.D., Representative of the British Conference to the Australian Con-
ference ; Sir George Wigram Allen, Mr. Edmund Webb, M.L.A., Rev. William
Schofield, Mr. William Davies, and the Rev. George Hurst, who represented
the President of the College, Mr. Fletcher having slipped on some planks among
the foundations and breaking his leg. Seven weeks afterwards he was still on
crutches ; but he wrote in hopeful strains. “ Altogether,” he says, “ though this
accident, like all such occurrences, had much about it that seems unaccount-
able and mysterious, yet I see light shining out of the darkness. I feel deeply
grateful, too, that with such an accident I should have suffered so little acute
pain.” And one year later he wrote again: “ I thank God for the accident and
all its consequences.”
In July, 1880, the last removals from Newington House took place, and on
January 18th, the new College was formally opened, the President, Head Mas-
ter, and one Resident Master being in residence before the Ist of August. The
School opened with 100 scholars and four Theological Students, though accom-
modation was provided for 200 boys and 70 boarders. At the formal opening
a large number of ladies and gentlemen assembled in the Great Hall in the
afternoon, when Sir Wigram Allen, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly, pre-
sided, being surrounded by a number of Ministers and representative laymen.
In the course of his speech Sir Wigram said: “The Wesleyan Church, in this
Colony, has not in times past neglected its duty to its people in respect of
primary or higher schools. For many years it maintained, with aid from the
State, several primary schools, most of which have been properly absorbed in
the Public Schools.” Mr. Fletcher gave a characteristically brilliant speech,
in which he outlined the foundation, development, and aims of the Institu-
tion. Mr. William Davies and the Rev. W. B. Boyce also spoke, and Dr.
Kelynack closed the meeting with a vote of thanks to the Chairman.

REPORT OF NEWINGTON COLLEGE BUILDING FUND.
/n the handwriting of the Rev, J. II, Fletcher.


In the evening, refreshments having been provided meanwhile, a second
meeting was held, at which addresses were delivered by Dr. Kelynack, Presi-
dent of the Conference, the Rev. George Woolnough, M.A., and others. A
choir, under the conductorship of Mr. J. S. Huthnance, added interest by their
singing. The collections for the day totalled £ss°) including a gift of £lOO
from the Mayor of Sydney, Mr. John Harris. Mr. Fletcher announced that the
first Scholarship had been founded that day, Mrs. Schofield having given
£l,OOO for the Schofield Scholarship. At a later date, Sir Wigram Allen pro-
vided three Scholarships to be known as the Wigram Allen Scholarships, of the
annual value of 16 guineas each. It was also stated that the Hon. William
McArthur, then Lord Mayor of London, and his brother, the Hon. Alexander
McArthur, had given £2,000 towards the College, and assisted Dr. Kelynack,
when in England, in collecting from their friends the further sum of £852.
“ But,” added Mr. Fletcher, “ for these surviving embers from the hearth, where
the family met 23 years ago, our festival blaze to-day would not have been so
bright.” The committee thus found itself in possession of a perfectly unencum-
bered and beautiful estate, with the ocean in view, a School already waiting to
go into possession, and behind it 50,000 Methodists in New South Wales and
Queensland.
How this courageous undertaking impressed the public may be gathered
from the following remarks in The Sydney MaiT. —“Looking at what has
taken place from an extra-denominational point of view, the spending of
£55,000 upon a College,* may be accepted as an indication of what value the
Wesleyan Church places upon education ... in these times of intellectual
activity no Church aspiring to perpetuity can afford to omit the establishment of
educative agencies. Churches must educate or perish. That is the alternative
of the age. In New South Wales, the State has monopolised much of this
business of instruction, but the denominations have still quite as much to do
as the means at their disposal enable them to get through, and the probabilities
are that many years will elapse before they will be called upon to find some other
outlet for the energy and wealth now being devoted to such culture as has found
a home in the costly building at Stanmore. Opened under favourable auspices,
backed up by a growing body of people, it is not likely to have a disappointing
history.”—(January 22nd, 1881.)
Having secured their School, we may ask what was the specific aim of its
founders and of those who struggled to secure its establishment ? Higher
education is a term, the meaning of which may vary according to the aspirations
of those who use it. At what did the Council aim ? “ The objects,” said Mr.
Fletcher, “especially provided for were; First, the maintenance of a School for
higher education, open to boys of all religious denominations ; secondly, the pro -
vision in connection therewith of education at the Connexional allowances to a
proportionate number of Ministers’ children ; and, thirdly, the maintenance of
* This is estimating the land to be worth £20,000, and the aggregate value of the
property at £55,000,

a Theological Institution for training candidates for the Ministry; and fourthly,
at least for the present, to provide residence, tuition and oversight for
Methodist students attending the University.” The second of these objects
was quite in accordance with Methodist usages, and was especially needed by
Ministers living in remote country places. The interests of the Theological
Institution were safeguarded in the Trust Deed securing to that Institution an
equal share in the land and building, and the whole share, if the School should
be given up. In the School, it was hoped that Christian influences arising out
ol faith in Christ and God’s Holy Word would accompany for good the instruc-
tion of many youths in preparation for commercial and professional pursuits.
In the Theological Institution it was intended that the students “ should be
thoroughly possessed of the Christian verities which they undertake to teach, as
v, ell as competently furnished in whatsoever things qualify the Christian Minis-
ter of the 10th century to take his place as a skilful, and cultured, as well as an
earnest, worker in that ever-widening field of labour in which public opinion
seems to expect him to conjoin the fervour of a seraph with the half-man,
half-horse, physical endurance of the fabled centum.”—{lnaugural Address ,
January, 1881.) And Mr. Fletcher cherished another wish, which the Church


of to-day appears to have forgotten. “We ought,” he says, “to have a suitable
room in which to collect a Connexional Library, and a Missionary Museum.
Several very valuable books have already been presented, as the nucleus of a
library of 1 heology and of general literature, and others would be given ; and
probably also we might hope to collect manuscript materials for the History of
Australian Methodism, now in danger of destruction for want of some suitable
place of deposit and guardianship.”
Even at the risk of unduly lengthening this chapter, we cannot resist the
temptation to give Mr. Fletcher an opportunity to speak again on a project
which he had made his life’s work, and which remains an imperishable memory.
“ Let us not be charged, then, with vain ambition if, finding ourselves entrusted
with this spacious area of land near the Metropolis we have dedicated it to this
College. . . . Believing as we do in the imperial strength and permanence
of Christianity, and that the scorn of scepticism is but the foaming of the fret-
ful wave against the ever steadfast rock, believing as we do that Protestantism
would be very unwise to allow the higher education of the youth of this land to
pass into the hostile hands which are so eager to grasp it, believing as we do the
Methodist Church, which is indeed the youngest branch of the great Protestant
family in Europe, but one of its older branches in Australia, now after nearly
seventy years of hard pioneering labour in every part of the land, holds a deep
and enduring interest in the moral and religious well-being of the country.
. . let us not be counted rash and vain if in this our faith, we, who are not a
wealthy community, nevertheless, without asking a shilling from the State, have
ventured to build this College. Newington is a title as yet of no significance.
It is, we may say, a blank page, which, however, may be thickly written with
memories of affection, with names of lustre, with traditions of renown. Or we
may say it is the flag undistinguished as yet, which floats to-day at the mast-
head of the new-built, new-launched ship of our hope. From this day, sail on
then, good ship.
‘ Sail forth into the sea, 0 ship !
Through wind and wave, right onward steer;
Fear not each sudden sound and shock,
’Tis of the wave and not the rock;
’Tis but the flapping of the sail.
And not a rent made by the gale.
In spite of rock and tempest’s roar,
In spite of false lights on the shore,
Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea.
Our heart, our hopes, are all with thee.
Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears,
Our faith triumphant o’er our fears,
Are all with thee are all with thee.’ ”
Newington College more than fulfilled this aim so beautifully set forth by
Mr. Fletcher. It sailed on peacefully for many years until a commercial crisis
came, when it was buffetted by adverse winds. Mr. Fletcher, however, did not
live to see this. He remained in charge till the year 1887, during which time
the College rapidly increased in numbers and influence. Then he was appointed
Principal of the Theological Institution, removing to his own property near at
hand on April igth, the anniversary of his landing in Auckland thirty-nine

years before. At the breaking up of the College in December, 1888, the “Old
Boys ” showed their appreciation by the presentation of an artistically executed
address and the unveiling of his portrait in oils, which hangs to-day in the
School Hall. “ Not a little,” said the address which was presented by an “ Old
Boy,” Dr. W. J. O’Reilly, “we hope, have our lives been influenced for good by
your example of devotion to duty, of self-sacrifice and of all that was manly and
Christian. We remember, too, with pleasure your teachings, full of helpful
counsel, given to us in such a form as could not fail to interest and impress.”
The schoolboys also gave expression to their admiration for their late President
by presenting him with some pieces of furniture and an address read by W. L.
Parker, one of the boys. “We recognise,” said the boys, speaking on behalf of
the College, “ the devotion you have always shown in promoting its interests,
and the enthusiasm with which you have always championed its cause ; and we
are convinced that the present position is to no small extent due to the unwearied
vigilance with which you have during twenty-three years personally managed its
affairs. Your eloquence in the pulpit, and upon the platform, the brilliant versa-
tility of your pen, and the earnestness of your Christian character, have com-
- bined to render you one of the most prominent personalities in this Colony;
and the influence you have thus been enabled to command has always been
exerted to the advancement of this Institution.” The Conference also placed
on record its opinion of Mr. Fletcher and his work. In a lengthy and apprecia-
tive resolution it said: “We recognise with appreciation and gratitude that his
culture, his large experience, his weight of character, and his fatherly and godly
supervision, have been productive of much good to the large number of youths
who have passed under his care, and of benefit to the general interests of
Methodism. In addition to these services, the Conference remembers that for
many years Mr. Fletcher discharged the duties of Theological Tutor to many
students who are now doing good service in the ranks of the Ministry, and now
that he has been wholly set apart to this office, the Conference hopes for larger
and yet more valuable results from Mr. Fletcher’s labours in this direction.”—
(Conference Minutes , 1887.)
On his retirement from the College, Mr. Fletcher found congenial employ-
ment for which he was so eminently fitted and to which he attached great
importance. Here he hoped to spend the autumn of life in continued service
to the Church, which had become the passion of his life. But God had
willed it otherwise. Towards the close of the year 1889, his health causing
some anxiety he paid a visit to Brisbane to take part in the opening services of
the Albert Street Church. But no improvement took place, and he found him-
self called home by the unexpected death of his youngest son, Norman, through
typhoid fever. Graver symptoms asserted themselves, and he gradually sank
till Monday, June 30th, when the end came. And what a beautiful ending it
was and how characteristic! As language failed he tried to write upon a slate
these words: “Heaven! Light! Life!” His face lighted up, his hands were
raised, and Joseph Florner Fletcher was no more, for God had taken him.


What was the secret of Mr. Fletcher’s success at Newington? Let Mr.
W. H. Williams, M.A., who was Flead Master at the time of his death be heard
in a beautiful tribute inserted in Ihe iV civ ingtOman. “Lo all Newingtomans,
both to those who daily look up at that familiar face, with its kindly smile,
hanging m the School Hall, and to those thousands, scattered here and there
over this vast C ontinent, to whom his influence and example form some of the
most cherished memories of their lives, the death of their old President came as
a personal sorrow. For 20 years, Mr. Fletcher was literally identified with the
College, so entirely did he dedicate his time, his energy and his influence, to
promote its interests. Xhe success that attended his ungrudging devotion is
evidenced by the flourishing condition of the College at the present time, which
may fairly be attributed in no small degree to his judicious management during
the precarious stages of infancy and growth. One great source of success was
his unfailing popularity with boys, with whom he seemed to have instinctive
sympathy. He intuitively understood boys—their feelings, their little weak-
nesses, and their way of looking at things. He unconsciously ‘ put himself in
their place,’ and was not too far above or beyond them. In a word, he was
human. In his addresses to them he used simple, racy, idiomatic English, which
they could understand, which ‘ went home to their business and bosoms.’ His
language was chaste, elegant and poetic, being chosen with taste and refine-
ment, totally opposed to rhetoric and bombast. His prayers at the morning
exercises were beautifully simple and natural, without any straining after effect
or pompous phraseology, yet seeming to soar spontaneously into an ‘ ampler,
purer air.’ It was this spiritual elevation, this deep insight into things invisible,
that gave his prayers their hallowing influence.”— (Newingtonian, Sept., 1890.)
“ Succeed or fail,” Mr. Fletcher had previously said, “ I have steadfastly aimed
. . . to give our scholars as little excuse as possible for insubordination or
discontent by studying their personal comfort as far as we are able, or as they
will allow us to do, by avoiding unnecessary restraints, and when punishment is
necessary, by choosing rather sharp words than blows, and rather to withhold
indulgence than to inflict pain.”
Mr. Fletcher’s place was filled by. the Rev. William Kelynack, D.D., who
relinquished his position as General Secretary to Foreign Missions, a post which
he had filled with distinguished success for several years. In setting apart Dr.
Kelynack to this new but responsible duty the Conference said: “We record our
sense of the very remarkable services which Dr. Kelynack has rendered while
he has been Missionary Secretary at a most critical time in the history of our
Australasian Mission, arising from the withdrawal of the long-continued bounty
of the parent society. Dr. Kelynack devoted himself with unsparing labour,
with most persuasive eloquence, and with most distinguished success to create
a Special Flelp Fund. . . . We reluctantly release him from the office in
which he has so ably and with so much self sacrifice served our Church.”—
{Conference Minutes, 1887.). William Kelynack was one of the most brilliant of
a long line of Methodist Preachers hailing from Cornwall. Born in the seaport
village of Newlyn in 1832, a spot since rendered famous by artists of the Newlyn
School, educated at Penzance, he first taught in a private school, afterwards


entering the office of a merchant, where he laid the foundation of those business
habits so marked in after years. Converted at an early age, he was placed on
the C ircuit plan by the Rev. Robert Young when 17 years of age, receiving
valuable assistance from his Uncle, the Rev. John P. James, to whom he said
“ more than to any other man I owe much gratitude for the care and godly
tenderness with which he watched over my budding youth, and guided my
opening manhood.’ Removing to Plymouth, he was much in request as “the
Boy Preacher.” The Rev. George Barnley, his Superintendent, thus wrote of
him; The most noticeable feature . . . was the unlaboured and perfectly
natural beauty of his every phrase. He spoke in poetry, and seemed to be
incapable of doing anything less beautiful. Whilst the poorest of the company
were never confounded, but rather greatly helped by his imagery, and the most
fastidious were never tempted to suspect any efforts at display. . . . His
moral and religious character stood very high, and with a manly bearing he
v onderfully combined such a gentleness of spirit as told of very near relationship
to his Master.”
The Reform Movement was then dislocating Methodism, and the demand
for candidates was small; but William Kelynack, yielding to the persuasion of
his friends, offered for Mission work and was accepted with many expressions
of approval. On the eve of his departure his Pather died, and when friends
entreated his Mother to recall her gift, she nobly said: “No, his Father and I
have given him to the work of a Missionary, and he must go.” In his trial ser-
mon as a candidate he commended himself to the favour of his judges. The
sermon, preached at 6 a.m., was heard by a large number of Ministers, attracted,
to quote again the words of Mr. Barnley, “by the reputation of the young
man, and these one after another, in long succession, during the consideration
of the whole case, took the opportunity of saying that throughout the course of
their Ministry, it had not fallen to their lot to listen to a young man of equal
powers. The Theological examination was not a whit behind the specimen of
pulpit ability.” In 1854, he left for Australia, in company with the Revs. William
Curnow, Hans Mack (both Cormshmenj, James Bickford, R. Wi
Lonsdale Abell, John Gale, and Thomas Angwin, arriving at Port Jackson in
May, where he said, “the shores of Port Jackson echoed to the song of our
grateful and o’erflowing hearts.” His first Circuit was Bathurst, which was suc-
ceeded by many others, when in 1882, he became General Secretary for Mis-
sions, retaining that post till 1887. During this term he raised £6,000 as a
Special Help Fund, travelling through the Colonies and Fiji. On leaving
Bathurst a second time, in 1877, he visited England and America, collecting the
sum of £3,000 on behalf of Newington College. Receiving the degree of D.D.
from New Orleans, he was elected President of the New South Wales Con-
ference in 1880, and ten years later became President of the General Con-
ference.
During his Presidency at Newington, the College continued on its pros-
perous career, though Dr. Kelynack was not permitted to guide its affairs for
more than eight years. Flis work was then done. “ I was accustomed,” he said
to a friend, “ to think myself capable of anything, that I was made of cast iron.,

hut I find that I am only a piece of pottery.” The strain had been too great,
and the pressure too high, and the end was not far off. Preaching, lecturing,
and speaking were forbidden, and he was forced to sit quietly and submissively
waiting for the end. The yoke of silence was hard to bear, but he bore that
as bravely as he did the yoke of service. On Sunday evening, November Ist,
189 1, the boys had marched silently to Church, subdued by the presence of
death, which had been hovering over the College for the last week. While
the congregation was worshipping in the Church near by, the soul of William
Kelynack-—-the man of rare eloquence, of manly and vigorous character, of
courageous championship of the truth, of blameless and beautiful life, crossed
the bar to meet his Pilot face to face. Speaking of his Saviour he said: “ What
is all the gold of Australia to compare with Him ? How precious He has been
to me! ” And just before his death, when asked if Christ were still precious,
he replied: “ Supremely so! ” This was nearly his last word. Having sent
his love to his brother Ministers and to the boys, he turned to meet death.
While the strains of the evening hymn, sung by the worshipping congregation,
floated through the window, he peacefully and painlessly fell on sleep after 37
years’ service, “ during which he wore the white flower of a blameless life in the
fierce light of public opinion.” He was buried at Rookwood in the Wesleyan
Ministers’ burying ground, the public showing their esteem by a very large
attendance at the funeral. The Newingionian (December, 1891) said; “It
came as a great shock. We could scarcely believe that we should never again
look upon that familiar form that had gone in and out among us so long, or
listen to the accents of that melodious voice that had so often thrilled us with
its eloquence and instructed us with its wise councils. But slowly the con-
sciousness of our irreparable loss was borne in upon us. We felt that we
were bereft of a loyal champion, a trusty councillor, and a faithful friend. Nor
are we alone in our sorrow. The Church to which we belong, the Colony, the
whole of Australasia, are poorer by the decease of the Rev. Dr. Kelynack.
The universal esteem with which he was regarded was attested by the numerous
and representative attendance at the funeral. As President of the College he
filled an important and responsible position with dignity, strength, and wisdom.
He was essentially the ‘ strong man ’ that the late Principal Fletcher said he
desired as his successor when he resiened the Presidency into the hands of
Dr. Kelynack. Be it ours to follow his example in all virtuous and godly
living, that our last end may be like his.” Mrs. Kelynack was requested to con-
tinue at the College for the next year, while the Rev. Charles Stead, then Presi-
dent of the Conference, acted as President of the College.
It is only necessary to add that during Dr. Kelynack’s regime the College
maintained its position, as one of the foremost Schools of the day. But after
his death, strain and stress came, occasioned chiefly through a wave of com-
mercial disaster which swept over the Colony. Dr. Kelynack was succeeded
by the Rev. James Egan Moulton, who had been an Assistant Master in the
early days of Old Newington. Mr. Moulton, who is the son of a Wesleyan
Minister, belongs to a family famous for literary attainments. It included the
late Rev. W. F. Moulton, M.A., D.D., Head Master of the Leys School; Mr.


Richard Moulton, Professor of Literature in America; and Mr. Fletcher
Moulton, K.C. Mr. Moulton put aside prospects of brilliant success in England
to prosecute in the Tongan Islands the work he loved so deeply, the enlighten-
ment of uncivilised races. After a remarkably successful career at Tubou Col-
lege, his latter days there were clouded by the persecution promoted by Mr:
Shirley Baker s establishment of another Church, which he inconsistently named
the Free Church. Having returned to New South Wales, Mr. Moulton was
appointed President of the College in March, 1893. holding the position till
December, 1899. During his term he received the degree of D.D. from the
Victorian University. The boys could not allow Dr. and Mrs. Moulton to
sever their connection with the College without presenting an address, in
which they assured him of “ the high place which you have won in our affection
and esteem. . . . We have found in you a friend and counsellor. You
have been at all times readily accessible to us in our difficulties. You have
encouraged us alike in our work and recreation, and ever led us in the good
way. Newington has at the present time one of the best equipped playgrounds
in the Colonies. The cricket oval, the swimming bath, and many other improve-
ments have been carried out during your term of office and under your direc-
tion. In the School life you have ever striven to develop a manly type of
character, and we venture to think with the happiest results.” Dr. Moulton was
then presented with a richly upholstered combination easy chair, and Mrs.
Moulton with a silver tea urn, a silver entree dish, and a silver tea caddy.
On Dr. Moulton’s retirement the Conference abolished the dual system of
control, and appointed the Rev. Charles J. Prescott, M.A, (Oxon), to the post
of President and Head Master. Mr. Prescott, who is also the son of a Wesleyan
Minister, was born at Bridport (Eng.), in 1857. Educated at Kingswood
School, he passed through the usual six years’ course, and being Head Boy he
was permitted to remain two additional years. Under the guidance of Mr. T.
G. Osborne, M.A., the Head Master, he had a brilliant career, winning the Dux
and Arithmetic medals and twice gaining the medal for Greek Testament. He
passed the Junior Oxford Local Examination twice, winning the seventh and
second places on the respective lists ; and in the Oxford Local Examination,
corresponding to the Sydney University Senior Examination, he was placed
third. Subsequently he gained a Scholarship of £7O a year for four years,
and in 1876 proceeded to Worcester College, Oxford. Here he gained the
Goldsmith’s Exhibition of £SO for three years, and completing his course in
1880, took his B.A. with Honours in Mathematics. His M.A. followed in 1893.
While at Oxford he was a member of the University Union, and President of
the Debating Society of his own College. Accepted as a candidate for the
Ministry, he became Assistant Tutor at Handsworth Theological Institution;
and in 1882, accepted an invitation to join the New South Wales Conference.
He was stationed at Parramatta for three years, meanwhile acting as Tutor in
Classics and General Literature at the Theological Institution. In 1886, on
the establishment of the Ladies’ College at Burwood, Mr. Prescott was appointed
its first President and Head Master, a position which he held till his transference
to Newington College in the year 1900. Mr. Prescott is essentially a man of


wide views and liberal sympathies, deeply interested in all questions of secondary
education, and taking a warm interest in school sports. It is too early to speak
of Mr. Prescott’s successes at Newington, but we may add, to quote again The
Newingionian, “ the mantle of the Head Mastership is descending upon worthy
shoulders, and the Council, in appointing Mr. Prescott, has secured the services
of one who will give of his best to Newington, and in whose hands the prestige
of the School will be abundantly upheld.” To give the members of the Execu-
tive an opportunity to meet Mr. Prescott, the Council of the Old Boys’ Union
entertained him at dinner, when Dr. Cecil Purser, the President of the Union,
took the chair. The Old Boys also promoted a successful “At Home ” at the
College, when Mr. and Mrs. Prescott had an opportunity of meeting the friends
of Newington on the College grounds.
Let us now retrace our steps to that time when Mr. Coates severed his
connection with the College, to be succeeded by Mr. W. H. Williams, M.A.,
who was selected in England by a Committee, and who was to commence his
duties early in 1884. In the interim Mr. J. J. Fletcher, M.A., B.Sc., son of the
President, successfully carried out the duties of Head Master. Mr. Williams,
who came to Newington with a high reputation as a Classic and an eager student
of English Literature, was educated at the ancient Grammar School at Newark -
upon-Trent, founded in 1531, and at Trinity College, Cambridge. Throughout
a brilliant course he won a Sizarship, the Foundation Scholarship, the English
Declamation Prize, being bracketed equal with the present Lord Tennyson ; the
Greek Testament Prize, and prizes for first-class in College examinations, in
addition to the Jeston Exhibition. He graduated in the first class of the Clas-
sical Tripos in 1876, and took the degree of M.A. in 1879. Leaving Cambridge
he became senior Classical Master at the Leys School, Cambridge, under the
Rev. Dr. W. F. Moulton, M.A., holding this position for seven years, when he
resigned to accept the Head Mastership of Newington College. At the end
of 1892 Mr. Williams accepted the Lectureship of Classics and English Litera-
ture in the newly established University of Tasmania. Mr. Williams has pub-
lished an edition of “ Ralph Roister Roister,” Dryden’s “ Hind and Panther ,”
and is now engaged on specimens of the Elizabethan drama. During his term
at Newington College, the numbers reached their highest point, two new
class rooms, the chemical laboratory, the gymnasium and the boarders’ day
room were built, and the School was reorganised and reclassified, its character
passing from a Superior State School to that of an English Public School.
During the nine years Mr. Williams was Head Master of the College, his
influence as a teacher was apparent in the brilliant results achieved at the
University examinations. Prior to his departure the Masters and boys pre-
sented him with 194 volumes of a varied character, contained in a handsome
revolving stand, and also an enlarged portrait of the teaching staff. Mr. Flint,
who was deputed to make the presentation, said that “ they had every respect
and regard for Mr. Williams as a scholar, and they loved him as a friend.” The
Old Boys also showed their appreciation and personal regard by a harbour
excursion and the presentation of a number of books.

MR. A. S. LUCAS ; M.A., B.SC.
Head Master.
A suitable successor to Mr. Williams was found in Mr. A. S. Lucas, M.A.,
B.Sc, for ten years Mathematical and Science Master at Wesley College, Mel-
bourne, and Tutor in Mathematics and Science at Ormond and Trinity Colleges,
Melbourne. From 1877 to 1882 Mr. Lucas occupied the position of Science
Master at Ley’s School, Cambridge, where he laid the foundation of his repu-
tation as an exceedingly brilliant teacher. His record as a scholar was remark-
able. In 1868 he was Dux Medallist and Scholar of Kingswood School; in
1870 Exhibitioner, London University; 1872, First Class Mathematical Modera-
tions, Oxford; 1876, Burdett Coutts’ Geological Scholar, Oxford, and Senior
Science Scholar, London Hospital; 1877, Gold Medallist in Botany, London
Apothecaries’ Society, and M.A., Oxford, and B.Sc., London. It has been said
that he was capable of giving thorough instruction in over thirty subjects.
During his Head Mastership the members of the Sixth Form, taught by him-
self, won several medals in the Senior Examination, in addition to the Barker
Scholarship, the “blue ribbon” for Mathematics at Matriculation. Mr. Lucas
has been a large contributor to Magazines on scientific subjects. “He leaves
behind him,” said The Newingtonian, “the reputation of an English gentleman


and honourable man, and those who remain at Newington will possess a bright
memory of a mind possessing large abilities, joined to intense application,
illumined by the sunshine of charity.” Mr. Lucas was not allowed to leave
without some token of the boys’ esteem. At the Speech Day of 1898, F. G.
Phillips, one of the senior boys, read an address, and on behalf of the boys
requested Mr. Lucas to accept a cheque with which “ to purchase something for
himself as a memento of his connection with the School.” The boys of the
Sixth Form also made a presentation.
It would be unjust to conclude that the great success of Newington in
Scholarship and Sports was due entirely to the Head Masters who controlled
its destinies, great as their influence was. 1 hey themselves would be the first
to repudiate this claim, as they have been the most ready to acknowledge the
valuable help received from their colleagues. Indeed, they have made a point
on public occasions of acknowledging the debt t?hey owed to their Assistants.
Prominent among these gentlemen were Mr. John Waterhouse, M.A., who
severed his connection with Newington in 1883, and Mr. I. J. Fletcher, M.A.,
B.Sc., who rendered great help for seven years, until in 1885, he became Secre-
tary of the Linnean Society, the Upper Fifth and Sixth Forms presenting him
with two silver salvers as a mark of their esteem. Both these gentlemen were
formerly scholars at Old Newington. Other Masters deserving special mention
are Mr. R. T. Baker, F.L.S., House Master and Captain of the Cadet Corps for
many years; Mr. A. K. Watson, 8.A., who died of typhoid fever in 1890, after
seven years service; Mr. C. A. Flint, M.A., who succeeded Mr. J. J. Fletcher
as Mathematical and Science Master; Mr. P. A. Robin, M.A., who filled Mr.
Watson’s place ; and Mr. C. A. Buchanan, 8.A., now Senior Resident Master
and Captain of the Cadet Corps.
The developments in connection with the College since its removal to
Stanmore have been steady and numerous. The advent of Mr. Williams
brought with it several changes, soon made apparent in the examination
results. Mr. Williams introduced the “Judgment Book.” showing a weekly
return of work done in the Forms, thus enabling the parents to make them-
selves familiar with the progress of the scholars. The School paper. The
Newingtonian, was also successfully launched in July, 1884. The Fifth and
Sixth Forms Boys had previously issued The Newingtonian in manuscript,
the first number appearing on 23rd March, 1883, with George Abbott as
Editor, who succeeded in bringing out two or three numbers. “ What the
paper will be,” said the youthful Editor. “ depends upon yourselves—boys of
Newington. Devote some attention to it; make some sacrifices for the sake
of advancing your paper, and make it worthy of Newington College and
worthy of the Australian boys who contribute to it. Don’t let it be said that
our School cannot hold its own in this respect with the Grammar School and
its other compeers, for we don’t think that it has ever yet had reason to hang
down its head in other respects. We need never be ashamed of our School.
Let us see to it that Newington will never be ashamed of us.” When the pre-
sent Magazine made its appearance in June. 1884, the Editor wrote: “Let our

motto serve at once to define our aims and excuse our faults. ‘ Mentor
fuertiae! To place on record the simple annals of boyhood: to redeem from
oblivion passing incidents and achievements, trivial perhaps to others, yet of
keen interest to ourselves; to chronicle the prowess of the athlete and the dis-
tinctions of the scholars: to link past with present, by showing our old comrades
that we trace their careers with affectionate regard: to foster literary attain-
ments, by giving the tyro an opportunity of making his first attempts before
a kindly and familiar audience: to afford a mouthpiece for the British grumbler:
in a word, to afford a mouthpiece of the many-sided life of a great School.
We want to make our Magazine the genuine outcome of our School
life. We want it to be written as far as possible by the School, for the School,
and about the School. Self-Help and Co-operation are our watchwords.” The
Head Master and. a Committee took charge of the publication. The Science
Club was inaugurated at the instigation of Mr. Lucas during the September
quarter, 1893, its object being to arrange for excursions for those “ who have
a liking for any of the different branches of Natural Science.” Its first excur-
sion was made to Watson’s Bay, and its first officers were Mr. Lucas (President),
W. A. Shortland (Secretary), and W. R. Beaver (Curator). The Museum
received forty specimens of mineral wealth from the Government and several


contributions from its members. A Carpentry Class was also established
about the same time, meeting on Saturday morning and Thursday afternoon.
The first contract of importance was that in which the amateur carpenters
undertook to make the posts for the oval.
In the realm of sports Newington has always figured successfully. In
Mr. Coates’ time the School became famous for its achievements in the Cricket
field, but it was not till the year 1884 that the Athletic Club was formed, largely
at the instigation of Mr. J. J. Fletcher, who thus set forth its aims: “ The
aim and object of our recently-established Athletic Club is to take up the
training of our boys’ bodies, that they may more fitly enshrine the minds,
which it is the primary object of the School work to cultivate, and at the same
time to foster a public spirit among us. But this is not all. It encourages
its members to meet the representatives of other Schools in friendly rivalry on
the cricket ground, in the football field, and at the rifle range ; it strives to
teach them to win fairly when they can without undue exultation ; to accept
a fair defeat without harbouring envy or ill-feeling ; to resolve always to do
their best even when the game is uphill; and as all this involves the learning of
such valuable lessons as self-restraint and unselfishness the work done by
the Athletic Club is a valuable auxiliary to the ordinary School training.”—
(The Newingionian, vol. 1., p. 25.) The Club was to comprehend all games,
thus securing satisfactory and systematic management of the games and finan-
cial matters and giving an official status which the Cricket or Football Clubs
alone could not give. Its conduct was in the hands of a Committee of Masters
and boys elected from among and by the members. The Cadet Corps, from
the nature of its constitution, was not placed under the management of the
Athletic Club, but in every other respect it was one. The Bicycle Club was
inaugurated in 1886 with Mr. Williams as President, Mr. Reeve Captain, and
Mr. W. L. Curnow Secretary. Twenty members joined on its initiation. The
Tennis Club followed in due course, a new court being provided in 1886,
and the Gymnasium and Swimming Club were organised at a later stage.
And, as if to crown all these exhibitions of sport, the School Flag, obtained
through subscriptions by the boys in 1899, was hoisted for the first time on
Thursday, 18th May. On that date the School assembled by the flag staff at
12 o’clock, forming a hollow square, wherein stood the President and his
familv, the Head Master and his Assistants, the Rev. E. J. Rodd and Mrs.
J. 11. Fletcher. Mrs. Moulton then unfurled the flag, the Cadets presented
arms, the School Band played the National Anthem, and the Rev. E. J. Rodd
uttered a prayer of thanksgiving.
Lest it be thought that in the world of sport alone development was notice-
able, mention must be made of progress in other directions. First of all came
the additions to the College property. The College grounds are continually
undergoing improvement, so that to-day they are the finest and most exten-
sive grounds attached to any Public School in the State. The Laboratory,
or chemical workshop, was added in 1886, and additions to the Class rooms
and other parts of the building have been made from time to time. Other
aspects of the work also received attention. During Dr. Kelynack’s Presi-

dency social evenings for the boarders were inaugurated, and the Literary and
Debating Society was commenced. Ihe inaugural meeting of this Society was
held on Friday evening, November nth, 1887, when the Head Master, Mr.
Williams, occupied the chair, and the President (Dr. Lelynack) delivered an
instinctive and eloquent address. The President and Head Master were
President and Vice-President respectively, ex officio , Mr. Watson and Mr. Flint
Vice-Presidents, W. A. Parker Secretary, W. F. Litchfield Treasurer, and
F. V. Pratt, L. E. Serisier and A. C. Vallack the remaining members of the
committee. The Musical Society was formed in the early part of r 888, the
first meeting being held on the 20th April. A Branch of the Students’ Chris-
tian Union was instituted in 1896, and was due to a visit from Mr. Mott,
Secretary of the World’s Student Christian Federation. Mr. Mott did not
visit Newington, but his influence was apparent upon Mr. Fiddian, one of the
Masters, who spoke to some of the Senior boys about the formation of a
Union. A beginning was made with about a dozen boys, Mr. Fiddian acting
as President, and Mr. Reginald W. Robson as Secretary. The Union met
once a week, when papers on various subjects were read and discussed. Mr.
Sallmon’s book, “Studies in the. Life of Jesus Christ ,” was afterwards
adopted, and interesting meetings were held with the boarders and the Divinity

students. The Union has had a beneficial influence upon the life of its mem-
bers, and it is hoped that the same results may follow at Newington which
have made themselves apparent elsewhere, viz.: a steady stream of cultured men
into the ranks of the Christian Ministry. Mr. Prescott also regularly conducts
a Class for the study of New Testament Greek.
But one of the most notable developments took place in 1893, when the
“ Old Boys’ Union ” was formed. About that time the Heads of the Secondary
Schools in New South Wales were waking up to the fact that for years past
they had done nothing to keep their ex-students in touch with their respective
institutions, and they recognised that, from a sentimental as well as from a
practical point of view, a great mistake had been made. On the initiative of
the Rev. J. E. Moulton and Mr. Lucas steps were taken to remedy this defect
so far as Newington was concerned. The foundation stone of the Union was
laid at a meeting of twenty Old Boys, which took place on August 13th. A
committee was appointed to draft a constitution for submission to a second
meeting to be held on the 20th inst. Forty “ Old Boys ” were in attendance,
when the Constitution was adopted and the following officers elected for the
ensuing year:—President, Rev. J. E. Moulton ; Vice-Presidents, Mr. Lucas,
M.A., B.Sc., Mr. S. W. Moore, M.L.A., Mr. W. E. V. Robson, 8.A., and Drs.
W. J. O’Reilly, Murray Oram, and G. Abbott; Secretaries, Mr. W. A. Parker,
B.A, and Mr. T. R. Bavin, B.A. ; Treasurer, Mr. A. J- Phillips; Committee,
Messrs. F. V. Pratt, B.A, W. L. Curnow, B.A, D. S. Edwards, B.A, H. Wol-
stenholme, B.A, J. C. Halliday, and E. O. Litchfield. The Union was
inaugurated on Friday, August 20th, by a cricket match between past and
present members of the School. Subsequently about forty Old Boys sat down
to tea in the Dining-room Hall, after which a Reunion followed, attended by
150 Old Boys. The loyalty of Old Newingtonians has never been questioned.
The College has always been popular, and one of its most cherished traditions
has been to do well in scholastic work and in school sports ; and there are
many features about its history which appeal to the imagination of its con-
stituency and ex-students.

The object of the Union, as stated in its Constitution, was “ to strengthen
the bonds between Old Newingtonians and the School.” In the practical
working out of this idea there was some little haziness for a while in the minds
of both members and officials. The movement was a new one for Australian
Schools, and there were no precedents to guide. It was arranged to hold
periodical re-unions, when members might meet in social intercourse, renew old
friendships, and form new ones. As time went on two things became evident
to the responsible officials: First, that careful organisation was necessary; and
for the movement to take a firm hold on the convictions of Old Boys there
must be some stronger motive than the mere prospect of meeting friends at
an occasional re-union. Accordingly the view was strongly presented that
while the Union afforded opportunities for personal enjoyment, its higher mis-
sion was to create in the minds of members a deeper feeling of loyalty to the
School, and to urge them to do all that lay in their power to advance the
material interests of the College. This aspect has appealed very strongly to
many Old Boys.
At the conclusion of its first year the Union roll of membership stood
at 83. At the end of the eighth year it had increased to 272, and it is still
growing. The members are scattered all over Australasia, and some live in
other parts of the world. These are kept in touch with the School and
many of their friends by receiving every quarter a copy of the College
Magazine , which contains not only School news but also records the doings of
all Old Boys whose movements are known. After eight years’ existence it
can be said that the Union has justified its formation. Apart from the social
side of its work, it has created a stronger feeling of “esprit de corps” among
Old Boys; it has implanted in the minds of many the desire to see their
friends and relatives enjoy the privileges and pleasures of Newington School
life, and it has strengthened the determination of others that their sons shall
follow in their footsteps by becoming pupils at their old School. The value of
the Union to the school has frequently been dwelt upon by the present Head
Master, who has had numerous opportunities of observing its direct and indirect
influence, an influence daily growing greater, a result due in no small measure
to the untiring efforts of Mr. A. J. Phillips, the Treasurer. The following
gentlemen have been elected Presidents :-Rev. J. E. Moulton, Mr. A. H. S.
Lucas, M.A., B.Sc., Mr. S. W. Moore, M.L.A. (twice), Mr. P. W. Rygate, 8.E.,
Dr. Cecil Purser, Dr. G. H. Abbott, Mr. W. E. V. Robson, 8.A., and Mr. W.
Horner Fletcher. As an indication of the nature of the work done at Newing-
ton College the reader is referred to the Appendix, where a list of University
successes is appended and with which the story of Newington College must,
conclude.

THE SCHOFIELD HALL, BURWOOD COLLEGE.
BURWOOD COLLEGE.
The gratifying success of Newington College raised the question of estab-
lishing a Ladies’ College, which should render for the Church similar services
to those so long rendered by Newington. Discussed for years, nothing definite
was done until the Conference of 1883, when a Committee was appointed to
consider the question and to report to the following Conference. This Com-
mittee met in York Street Church, May 4th, 1883, when the following gentle-
men were present;— Revs. W. Moore (President), S. Wilkinson, G. Hurst, J.
Oram, J. B. Waterhouse, J. Bowes, J. H. Fletcher, W. J. Davis, W. Clarke, G.
Woolnough, M.A., G. Martin, J. Clifton, J. A. Nolan, G. Brown, R. Caldwell,
J. W. Brown, W. E. Bourne, K. A. Corner, W. G. Taylor, J. E. Carruthers,
C. J. Prescott, 8.A., J. Gardiner, and Messrs. P. Miller, G. W. Barker, Dr. W.
J. O’Reilly, S. E. Lees, Dr. Oram, and Thomas Cummins. The Rev. John
Gardiner was appointed Secretary, and the following resolutions were unani-
mously passed:—“ That, considering the great importance to our Church and
to the country generally, of Higher Education, this meeting is of opinion that
the time has now come, when steps should be taken for the immediate estab-
lishment in this Colony of a High School for girls, in which will be imparted
a sound and complete education, and in which at the same time special atten-

tion will be given to the religious and domestic training of its pupils.” A
small Committee to obtain information with regard to suitable building sites
and the cost of working was appointed ; and at the next meeting held on the
23rd, a list of properties available was read, and the Rev. J. H. Fletcher gave
particulars in connection with the founding of Newington College, adding
that the College should be near the railway line, and not farther away than
Ashfield or Burwood.
Enquiries were now made concerning several properties, but without
avail. The Committee finally decided on the purchase of Miss Lester’s School
at Burwood, known as “ Kent House.” But this decision was not arrived at
until November 10th, 1885, when the Committee unanimously resolved —
“ That we purchase Miss Lester’s property, including furniture, for T6,000,
£ 1,000 to be paid at once, and the balance to remain at 5 per cent, for seven
years.” The Rev. S. Wilkinson was requested by the Committee to solicit
subscriptions on behalf of the College, and a Committee to make arrangements
for its inauguration was also appointed. At the next meeting Mr. E. Vickery
reported the completion of the purchase of the house, furniture, and the pad-
dock opposite the School for the sum already named. And as the contract
of sale was duly signed, the Committee ratified the purchase. At the same
meeting it was also placed on record that the property should not be regarded
as a permanent home. The College was named “ The Wesleyan Ladies’ Col-
lege,” the formal opening was fixed as near the 21st January, 1886, as possible,
the terms were arranged, and the lines on which the College should proceed
were set out. The Rev. J. H. Fletcher and Mr. P. Miller were appointed a
furnishing committee to arrange for the domestic arrangements of the School,
and the Conference was to be requested to appoint the Rev. C. J. Prescott,
B.A. (Oxon.) as President and Fleadmaster. Mr. Prescott and Mr. Fletcher
were authorised to advertise in the Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane papers


MISS WEARNE M. A.
First Ur ad Mistress of Burwood Ladies' College,
for a Head Mistress, and they finally succeeded in securing the services of Miss
Shiels, Principal of Sydenham School, Moonie Ponds, Melbourne, who was to
be assisted by a staff of resident and visiting teachers. The domestic arrange-
ments were placed under the superintendence of Mrs. Prescott.
The formal opening took place on the 27th January, 1886. “This Col-
lege, said The Advocate of that date, “is founded to meet a want that has
been felt for some years past by members of the Wesleyan Church both in the
■City and in the country, and to carry out the decision of the Conference
arrived at after discussion in several of its annual meetings. While it under-
takes in the first instance to supply this want its basis will be sufficiently broad
to meet the requirements of parents of other Christian Churches. Every care
will be taken to foster a lofty moral tone and high Christian principle in the
pupils. This College is situated in an eminently healthy neighbourhood, suffi-
ciently removed from the keen air of the sea, easily accessible by train from
Sydney, and commanding a beautiful view for many miles around. The pre-
mises have been occupied as a school by Miss Lester for many years past, and
are consequently well-known. Ihe Committee are prepared to make all neces-
sary additions and improvements for the proper accommodation and comfort

of day scholars and boarders. The scholastic course will include the usual
subjects of education, and while it aims at fitting the pupils for home life, will
also make provision for those who wish to prepare for University honours
and for those who look forward to finding their sphere of usefulness in educa-
tional work. The Ladies College Committee have appointed the following
gentlemen, who are members thereof, as a Committee of Advice to co-operate
with the President of the Conference, ex ojficio \ —The Rev. J. H. Fletcher
(President of Newington College), the Rev. W. Kelynack, D.D., Rev. Wi
Clarke, and Messrs. B. James, W. H. McClelland, E. Vickery, and H. C.
Fraser.”
The first Speech Day was held Thursday, December 16th, in the Burwood
School of Arts, when the Hon. Edmund Webb presided. The report stated
that the progress had been as good as could be expected. The School opened
with io pupils; at the end of the quarter they had increased to 20; the next
to 30, the next to 40, and at the end of the year the total number was 46.
Many of these pupils belonged to other Churches, a proof of their confidence in
the broad and inclusive nature of the religious work of the College. The
health of the College had been good. The success thus attained during the-

year was continued with such gratifying results that several successive enlarge-
ments became necessary, the most notable being the building of the dining-
room, known as the “ Schofield Hall,” made possible through Mrs. Schofield’s
munificent gift of £2,800. Mr. John Hardy also gave £250 towards the
reduction of the College building debt in addition to several other gifts, includ-
ing the annual presentation of the Hardy Gold Medal, and Mr. R. H.’Ducker
and some other laymen, though few in number, have consistently shown their
interest in the College. But, broadly speaking, the Methodist public has not
shown that interest in its welfare which was expected or desired. The foun-
dation stone of this Hall was laid on the 16th December, 1901, and now it is
said to be the most beautiful School Hall in Sydney. By this addition bed-
room accommodation for twenty additional pupils was provided.
At the close of the year 1900, Mr. Prescott was removed to Newington
College, the Rev. E. J. Rodd suceeding him as President, while Miss Wearne,
M.A., was appointed Head Mistress. The scholars and staff could not allow
their President to leave without expressing their love and appreciation in a
tangible form. The Schofield Hall was filled to overflowing at Mr. Prescott’s
last Speech Day, when Mr. John Hardy presented the prizes. In this last

report, Mr. Prescott touched on the progress in educational matters during the
14 years he had been in charge of the College ; and when he had concluded,
Mr. F. Morley appeared upon the scene bearing a large silver salver, and Miss
Wearne, on behalf of the staff, read an Address requesting Mr. and Mrs. Pres-
cott to accept the present as a token of the goodwill and affection of the
staff. This was followed by a tea and coffee service, carried on a silver salver
to match, the present of the Old Girls, who had gathered in force to say fare-
well to their former President. The School girls also made a presentation, and
then came a little mite bearing a handsome silver bowl as an offering from the
Kindergarten staff and children. Both Mr. and Mrs. Prescott were much
touched, and Mr. Prescott made a gallant attempt to speak. The Council
placed on record its regret at Mr. Prescott’s removal. In his written thanks
Mr. Prescott said : “ We feel that the affection manifested by those with whom
and for whom we have worked is a rich possession and a precious
recompense for such efforts as we have been able to put forth. We feel very
much the painfulness of severing a connection that has brought us so much
happiness during the past fourteen years, though that is alleviated by the recol-
lection that in a very real sense that connection is not, and cannot be broken,
for we shall cherish your friendship as long as we live. It is perhaps unneces-
sary to say that our interest in the College will remain very strong, and we

shall always rejoice to hear of its prosperity. We shall count it as a personal
favour if you will show to those who will succeed us the same loyalty that you
have shown to us.”
Mr. Prescott’s successor, the Rev. E. J. Rodd, was a Minister of many
years’ standing. Accepted as a candidate for the Ministry by the British Con-
ference of 1868, and proceeding to Richmond College he studied there for three
years, receiving special inspiration and valuable training from the Rev. W. F.
Moulton, M.A., one of the Tutors. Landing in Sydney in 1871, he was
appointed to the Braidwood Circuit, proceeding afterwards to St. Leonard s.
Camden, Gunning, and Orange followed in succession, when he was appointed
to Toowoomba, proceeding afterwards to Albert Street, Brisbane. Returning
to this Colony he was appointed a second time to St. Leonards, then Stanmore,
then Goulburn, and last of all Burwood. In each of these Circuits, he minis-
tered successfully to large and intelligent congregations, who remember with
gratitude his prayers and sermons. At Toowoomba he made an impression
such as is made by few men. Whilst stationed at Stanmore, he acted as Secre-
tary to the Examining Committee and Tutor to the Theological Students in
Homiletics and Christian Evidences. As a preacher, Mr. Rodd takes high
rank, his sympathetic preaching being marked by simplicity, beauty, and apt
illustration, enabling him to present truth in a way that arrests attention and
clings to the memory. In the year 1898 he was elected President of the Con-
ference, when his methodical habits, his quick despatch of business, and his
ready grasp of detail were apparent to all, and made his year conspicuously
successful. Miss Wearne, M.A. (Syd.), who succeeded Miss Shiels, was
appointed Head Mistress on the removal of Mr. Prescott. Miss Wearne
graduated in 1887, taking her B.A. in Mathematics and Languages. In the
following June she took her M.A. in Ethics and Political Economy.
Under this new arrangement the School continued its progress, the num-
ber of scholars gradually increasing, more accommodation being urgently
needed. It is very desirable, if funds allow, to complete the building according
to the architect’s design, which would give a handsome and striking erection.
The College has maintained its reputation, strengthened its position, achieved
excellent results at the University Examinations, and secured high standing
in educational circles. It exercises through its pupils a good influence in many
homes in this State and in Queensland, and it is doing a work for the Church
of great value though that work is silent and unobserved. The College has its
Magazine, Excelsior , which is exclusively the production of the girls. A
Reading Club was also formed, social evenings for the Boarders were inaugu-
rated, and the girls find recreation in their Tennis Club and other amusements.
A branch of the Students’ Christian l T nion has been commenced and the girls
have shown their interest in Christian Missions by the successful management
of a Bazaar.


THE THEOLOGICAL INSTITUTION.
The history of the Theological Institution does not reflect great credit on
the Church, for, though some of its leaders have insisted times without num-
ber on the prime importance of suitable training for its Theological students
no adequate provision has yet been made to give effect to their views. In
the absence of endowment, and with but small contributions by the Church,
the establishment of a separate and self-supporting Institution on the lines
.advocated in connection with the establishment of Newington College has, up
to the present, not been attained. The work of the Theological Institution
is bound up in the development of Newington College, the machinery avail-
able in the School being used as far as possible. The first attempt to give
the students systematic training was made in connection with the founda-
tion of Newington House on the Parramatta River, where the Rev. J. A.
Manton rendered what assistance lay within his power. Plis successor, the Rev.
J. H. Fletcher, who was most thoroughly impressed with the importance of
thorough training of candidates for the Ministry, did all that was possible
within the limitations imposed upon him. And the training of the students
proceeded in an indifferent fashion until the removal of Newington College
to Stanmore. At the Conference of 1883, an effort was made to improve the
then existing condition of things. In his report of the Theological Institution
submitted to the Conference, Mr. Fletcher said: “ I have refused the title of
Theological Tutor, but I should not have refused the work if it had been
.given me under conditions favourable to an effective discharge of the duty.
Those conditions, I think, are (1) a sufficient number of students remaining
for a fixed period, so that it may be possible to lay down a definite plan of
study, and go through with it; (2) an efficient Assistant teacher, who could
spend a good deal of time with young men in other work than theology, in
giving them their ground work for learning, and instructing them thoroughly
in the English language, in Latin and Greek at least up to the requirements of
using intelligently such books as Alford’s Greek Testament. This Assistant
should be a teacher, and, if possible, a Minister. It is no depreciation to say
of many of us that we are preachers and not teachers. Teaching is an art
which does not come by intuition, and especially in foundation work it is the
teacher and not the lecturer who is required; (3) as the annual collection for
the support of the students at the College is most inadequate, seldom amount-
ing to more than half of what would be required for cost of board and resi-
dence of six students, it is necessary that an effort be made to increase that
collection. The idea of supporting a Theological Class, with all the cost of
board and residence, tuition, and books, on Tl5O a year, is too ridiculous to be
discussed. And yet that is the maximum that has been available hitherto.
“ Now, for the first time during my eighteen years of residence at Newing-
ton, the conditions seem to approach possible fulfilment. First of all, lam told
that six or even seven, students may be set apart for instruction. Such a
statement, however, before the Stations are finished, may mean little, and it
would be better to put one or two men on the President’s list for emergencies,
than, after having sent them to Newington College, after we have altered all
our domestic arrangements to meet their case, and after having laid down a
plan of study for a year, to see first one and then another taken away for
periods varying from one month to six months for Circuit work. All the
Churches with which -I am acquainted send up their students for fixed periods
of study, of three, five, or seven years, which arc scarcely ever broken into. The
J *


next condition, also for the first time, appears possible. Among our young
men from England is one who is both a scholar of distinguished antecedents,
and who has been recently employed in one of our English Theological Insti-
tutions as an Assistant Tutor. I propose, therefore, as an essential part of my
scheme, that this Minister shall be stationed in or near this Circuit, which will
be most glad to receive him, and the Council of the College have agreed to
contribute to his support. Even then efforts should be made by subscriptions
and otherwise to double the present contribution to this most momentous work of
preparing our Ministerial candidates for their work. I ask this Conference to
consider how many of our young men we have called into our Ministry are
likely to be able twenty years hence to take our city pulpits, to represent
Methodism on public occasions in Sydney, or to take charge of such Circuits
as Bathurst, Goulburn, Newcastle, Maitland, Sydney, and of a dozen more
large and important cities that will adorn the New South Wales of 2003 ? In
the tabulated statement printed and laid before the Conference I present
succinctly an amended plan of our Provisional Theological Institution. The
resolutions now standing on the Minutes were drawn up by myself about a
dozen years ago, but I am of one mind with those who think that the time has
come for a step forward, only let it be on the right lines.”
This report was adopted with some slight alterations, and the Con-
ference recommended “ that for the present year, the Rev. J. H. Fletcher be
appointed to give the students instruction in Theology, and the Rev. C. J.
Prescott, 8.A., be appointed his Assistant to direct their education in Classics
and General Literature.” On accepting this position, Mr. Fletcher wrote in
his Journal; “God give me grace to do justice to the position I have accepted
as instructor to these young men in Theology. Oh may we be able to begin
an improved method of preparing the future Ministers of this Colony for their
future work. May I duly feel my responsibilities and faithfully discharge my
office.” At the following Conference (1884) Mr. Fletcher reported that he
had been ably assisted by Mr. Prescott, and that he himself had given lectures
on Theology. His work, he said, had been hindered by the want of proper
class-rooms and studies for the students, and the question of proper accommo-
dation must very soon be looked at. In the year 1887, a still further advance
was made, when the Conference resolved to set apart a Minister who should act
exclusively as Theological Tutor, Mr. Fletcher being appointed to that posi-
tion. In defining his methods of instruction to the following Conference Mr.
Fletcher said that his aim had been to make the young Ministers well informed
men and effective preachers in touch with the thought and the need of the times
in which they lived. He kept up, he said, a correspondence with his former
students, and thus endeavoured to encourage and inspire them. “In my teach-
ing,” he wrote, “ I feel bound to look at the effects of our Probationers’ Cir-
cuit life, and consider how I can do most for them in the allotted time to fur-
nish them for their actual work. And I ask, first, a good ground work such as
can be given only by a thorough training in Latin or Greek Grammar with
such Mathematical study as we can add. The preacher must be first the Inter-
preter, and without grammatical knowledge he cannot interpret. ... I
set myself to study the actual situation of affairs and to adjust my teaching to
it. And I lay down for myself this, which is the first principle in the philosophy
of teaching, we must begin with what is best known. The Theology of salva-
tion and of Christian experience give us our first platform. . . . Wesley

and Watson gave us the material of our first year’s course in Theology. But
along with these I have commenced a series of Lectures, which are intended to
deal with the controversies of our time in their bearing, especially upon the
fundamental question of the superhuman origin and supreme authority of Holy
Scripture. ... I have given my students nineteen of these Lectures dur-
ing the past year, and I hope, as my hand gets into the work, to multiply them
considerably.”
At the Conference of 1888, the Rev. J. B. Waterhouse moved a series of
resolutions for submission to the next General Conference, which would be
called upon to consider the establishment of a Central Theological Institution.
These resolutions stated that Mr. Fletcher had been appointed Theological
1 utor, and that from the proceeds of the Centenary Wesleyan Thanksgiving
Fund it was thought there was a prospect of ample provision being shortly
made for the thorough training of the candidates in New South Wales, which
asked to be left free to carry to a successful issue the important task upon
which it had entered under most favourable auspices. When the Centennial
Thanksgiving Fund was inaugurated in January, 1888, Mr. Fletcher moved
that among the objects of the Fund provision be made for the erection and
endowment of a Theological Institution for the training of candidates for the
Ministry and the purchase of a suitable site for the Ladies’ College. In his
speech he said that for twenty-two years he had been connected with education,
having prepared a number of young men for the Ministry, and he wished
especially to advocate the claims of the proposed Theological College. “It
was,” he argued, “ necessary that the young men who sought to enter the
Church should be given a chance, and have a few years for preparation and
training. He had come to the conclusion that for the demands made upon
them by the peculiar character of the work in this Colony their own men were
the best. They wanted men in every sense of the word, and especially of
sound physical constitution. The strain upon some of their young men was
extraordinary. There were no such monstrous Circuits in England, yet their
educational agencies were far more numerous, and they were doing everything
to give their young men a University training. Some of the young men in
this Colony were placed in most difficult positions, enough to try the energy
and courage of the bravest of men. They had great distances to ride, and it
required a very keen intellect to get any reading or study done. As they had
determined there should not be two classes of Ministers, but all should" have
the same training and enjoy the same honour it was more than ever necessary
that they should have at least three years before they went into those posi-
tions in which they could do so little to accumulate material, so that they may
set out on the right path, and we might never be ashamed to see them in our
city Circuits. There were two great powers that helped to keep the Church
alive. One was godly homes, the other a thoroughly live Ministry. Let the
young men think highly of the work of the Christian ministry, and feel that
it is the great work of their lives to qualify themselves. Let them all remem-
ber whose sons and daughters they were, what honoured Methodist names they
bore, and let them pray God to help them to do something great and good in
that happy and golden moment that had come to them in this Centennial
year.”
These objects have not yet been attained. Mr. Fletcher continued to act
as Theological Tutor until the year 1889, when the state of his health began to
interfere with his work. In his last report to the Conference he outlined the
work he sought to do during the past year. The purpose he had kept in view


. ' I J WW&:.

The Proposed Affiliated College .


had been to encourage the students to cultivate their own individuality and to
believe with all humility that they had something of their own to bring out by
study, self discipline, and prayer. At the same time he had endeavoured to
stimulate their minds by sending through them a stream of fresh thought by
conversation, and especially by Lectures touching the opinions and contentions
of their own time. He had given again the course of twenty-two Lectures for
the students the previous year, and he had also written the second series of
twenty-two Lectures for the second year’s men. “We have,” he said, “ paid a
good deal of attention to sermonising, but not in an efficient!}-'’ formal manner
as to be presentable for examination; though the note-books of the young
men have received a good many suggestions and criticisms, which will, I
hope, be fruitful at least in saving them from wrong methods.”
Mr. Fletcher regarded the three years in which he acted as Theological
Tutor the happiest years of his life. His relations with the students were of
the most cordial and satisfactory character. In writing of this period, his col-
league, the Rev. C. J. Prescott, said: “He loved educational work all his life,
but this was perhaps the most congenial kind. Here he found men anxious to
learn and of an age at which they could understand the priceless value of know-
ledge. No spur was therefore necessary to make them take in. And thus the
mutual sympathy between Tutor and students was of the strongest and ten-
derest kind. As they left, it was his joy to correspond with them as time per-
mitted, and to give them his kindly and fatherly help in their perplexities and
trials, and many a word of gracious wisdom and many a letter of loving
counsel will be treasured up for years to come.”
Mr. Fletcher s death compelled the Conference to make other arrange-
ments for carrying on the work. Though no one was appointed to succeed him
as Theological Tutor several Ministers gave their services as Tutors in special
subjects, among the number being the Revs. Joseph Oram, George Martin, J. A.
Nolan, and E. J. Rodd. On Mr. Prescott’s appointment to Burwood College,
a lay tutor was secured to guide the students in their classical studies. Dr.’
Kelynack became House Governor on Mr. Fletcher’s death, and he was suc-
ceeded by the Rev. J. E. Moulton, who in turn gave place to Rev. C. J. Pres-
cott, who now occupies the position of House Governor, while Rev. E. J. Rodd
fills that of Theological Tutor. This arrangement is not all that could be
desired, though it provides for the training and education of the students.
But that training cannot be entirely satisfactory until more adequate provision
is made for this important work.
It has been shown in this chapter that the first Theological Student was
Kirton A. Corner, who was afterwards joined by John S. Austin and Adin
Parsons. When the Institution was removed from Parramatta River to Stan-
more, the students then in residence were Benjamin Lane, and Richard H
Rickard. Of the Ministers now living eighty-eight have passed through the
Institution. The ex-students have formed a Union, which holds its annual
meeting during the Conference sessions. The officials are —President, ex
officio, Rev. E. J. Rodd; Vice-Presidents, Revs. B. Lane, R. M. Laverty, and
W. F. Oakes; Treasurer, Rev. W. H. Howard; Secretary, Rev. I. Ward Har-
rison and other members of the executive, Rev. J. E. Carruthers, *W. H. Beale,
and M. Scott Fletcher, M.A. The success of the Union is owing in great part to
the enthusiastic energy of its Secretary.

THE FIRST NEW SOUTH WALES METHODIST CONFERENCE, SYDNEY, 1902.


CHAPTER XXII.
METHODIST UNION.
IT would serve no good purpose to discuss at length the causes which led to
the drifting away or cutting off of various sections of the parent body in
England; but it is necessary to refer briefly to those divisions and mis-
understandings which led to a weakening of the forces and a scattering
of the ranks. When John Wesley died he left Methodism substantially
intact, though there were indications that difficulties lay ahead. Wesley
died at troublous times. The horrors of the French Revolution were
moving Europe and America almost to convulsion. Tom Payne’s.
“ Rights of Man ” were adding to the unrest and excitement of the
day, and the great Methodist revival, though it checked revolution
in England, had called into action conflicting tendencies, which became
pronounced at Wesleys death. Even his letter to the Conference, delivered by
Joseph Bradburn, his companion in travel and sickness, in which he said: “ Do
all things with a single eye, as 1 have done from the -beginning. Go on thus,,
doing all things without prejudice or partiality, and God will be with you even to
the end, did not extinguish the smouldering fires of discontent. To Alex-
ander Kilham belongs the unenviable distinction of fomenting the first schism in
the Church. Differing from his brethren on questions of administration, he gave
expression to his views in publications, entitled “ The Progress of Liberty,” “ I he
Methodistic Bull,” and ‘‘An Appeal.” The charges in these pamphlets against
Mr. Wesley and his body of preachers were pronounced, “ unproved, and slan-
derous,” and, as he could not prove even one of them, “ we adjudge him un-
worthy of being a member of the Methodist Connexion,” said the Conference.
As he had already caused much disunion and strife, the Conference of 1796
expelled him. Taking with him most of those of like mind, they soon after
formed “ The Methodist New Connexion.”
Such apparently commendable steps, as the founding of a Theological
Institution, and the erection of an organ in Brunswick Chapel, Leeds, in the
year 1828, led to other secessions. The congregation at Leeds would not
tolerate the organ, and passed out of the Chapel to worship in some spot where
organs were unknown. Dr. Samuel W. Warren, an able but irascible and
impetuous man, took offence because his name was not submitted for a high
position in the proposed College, and, with extraordinary animosity, he issued
a pamphlet, in which he set forth his views. Being deposed from his Circuit,
he appealed to the Vice-Chancellor, then to the Lord Chancellor, and finally to>


the Conference, only to find that he was hopelessly in error. When expelled
he gathered round him certain malcontents, to whom he ministered, until he
thought God called him to become an Anglican Clergyman, when he forsook
his former flock. Trouble came again in 1849, when James Everett, Samuel
Dunn, and William Griffith were expelled from the Ministry for the circulation
of anonymous papers called “ Flysheets,” in which they uttered grievous slanders
against the Methodist leaders and the Conference. In the year 1857 these three
bodies found a Cave of Adullam, into which they all entered, naming it “ The
Methodist Free Churches.”
The Primitive Methodist Church was not the fruit of strife, but rather of
revival. Among the results of the awakening at the early stages of Methodism
were William Clowes and Hugh and James Bourne, of Staffordshire, all zealous
and useful laymen. They multiplied prayer meetings, preached in the open air,
and, being joined for a time by an eccentric but earnest Methodist Preacher,
Forenzo Dow, from America, who was seized with the impression that it was
his special duty to preach to the Papists in Ireland, they decided to hold a Camp
Meeting, after the manner of similar meetings in Dow’s native land. A flag
was hoisted on Mow Hill, in Staffordshire, and the first camp meeting in England
was held. Wonderful influence attended the gathering, and these zealous men
thought they saw in camp meetings a Providential means of reaching multitudes
outside other religious influences. But the Conference, not blind to the good
wrought by camp meetings in England, thought them productive of considerable
mischief, and disclaimed connection with them. Hugh Bourne and Clowes, who
thought differently, and continued on their course, were afterwards expelled by
their Quarterly Meetings ; but they earnestly maintained their labours with
much success. And in 1810 the Primitive Methodist denomination took its
rise, beginning with a society of ten members. The Bible Christians, or
Bryanites as they were frequently called, closely resemble the Primitive
Methodists. This Connexion was founded by a Cornish local preacher, named
William O’Bryan. Their first Quarterly Meeting was held on January Ist, 1816,
and their first Conference three years later.
These offshoots soon had their representatives in other lands. In America,
they have not simply added to their numbers, they have multiplied their divisions,
so that to-day there are seventeen distinct denominations which trace their
origin to the Methodist revival. The Bible Christians have made their home
wherever the Cornishman has settled: that is, in all mining communities. The
Primitive Methodists have grown into a great and powerful Church. Australia
has found a home for all these branches. The Wesleyan Church was represented
in all the Colonies, being numerically strongest in Victoria. The Primitive
Methodists established themselves in each Colony, save Western Australia ; the
Bible Christians had their stronghold in South Australia, and the United
Methodist Free Church was everywhere, but not strong anywhere. Con-
sequently, there was overlapping, and people began to ask: Why these divisions ?

THE REV. GEORGE JAMES.
Primitive Methodist.
\\ ith the same theology, singing the same hymns, sprung from the same stock,
and, with few exceptions, the same method of Church government, why are they
not one ? Whatever reasons may have existed to explain the secession, is there
anything now to justify its perpetuation? Thus some reasoned, and the outcome
of their thought was an effort towards reunion.
It is said that the Rev. Dr. Watkin, of Victoria, was the first to advocate
organic union ; but at that period union was not generally considered desirable,
and when, many years ago, the Rev. George Daniel proposed a resolution in
favour of union in the Victorian Conference he could find no one to second it,
and he stood alone. But gradually the question began to be discussed, in its ab-
stract form certainly, but the seed already sown was germinating. The Bible
Christians of South Australia first adopted a resolution in favour of Union, and
the General Conference, held in Adelaide in 1881 , advanced the sub ject another
stage by the following Minute: “ That, in the interests of Christian charity
and Union, and in the hope of economising the energies of the various
Methcdist Churches, this Conference declares its readiness to consider any
well-devised scheme that may come before it for affecting a union of those
Churches.” Three years later a meeting, representing four sections of the


Methodist body, was held in Victoria, presided over by Dr. Watkin, when a basis
of union was adopted. The Victorian Conference which followed passed a re-
solution, requesting the General Conference to take such steps as it considered
safe and desirable to bring about union. But New South Wales remained
quiescent. The ardent Unionists in Victoria and elsewhere, however, secured
a favourable resolution in the General Conference of 1884, which met in New
Zealand, directing that communications be opened with the other branches of
the Methodist family in the Colonies. This the Unionists felt was a consum-
mation indeed, and they were very hopeful. But next year the Victorian Con-
ference put back the hands of the clock by means of a retrograde motion, while
New South Wales was apparently indifferent. She was concerned with other
matters. The discussion on the membership question, and the schism in
Tonga, arising through the disloyal action of Rev. Shirley Baker, engrossed her
thoughts. The next General Conference (1888) favoured co-operation and
united services, but the Conference of 1890 failed to give effect to its previous
conclusions by doing nothing. It did not even pass an academic resolution,
and the question dragge'd wearily along till 1891, when Committees to consider
the suggestions were appointed by most of the Conferences. In July of that
year a Committee sat in Sydney, under the Presidency of the Rev. Dr. Brown,
to discuss, in a practical way, the advisability of Organic Union. At that meeting
resolutions were passed, with but two dissentients, declaring that Union would
be in the interests of Christ’s kingdom, and for the glory of God.
But the end was not yet. The General Conference of 1894, which met in
Adelaide, marked the practical settlement of the question, after which Union
in Australia became only a question of time. In a debate, able and vigorous,
but in which it seemed doubtful as to what the issues would be, it was eventually
resolved; “ That union with the other branches of Methodism in these Colonies,
practically identical in belief and teaching with itself, sprung from the same
spiritual stock, and separated from it merely by difference in ecclesiastical order,
would be for the glory of God and the advancement of Christ’s Kingdom.”
This resolution was followed by the submission of a plan of Union, and power
was given to the Annual Conference to carry Union into effect upon the basis
set forth. “ The Union debate,” says an eye witness, “ was the most prominent
feature of the General Conference. It lasted twelve hours. The interest was
intense. The kaleidoscopic scenes were memorable. Never before in South
Australia, and not often elsewhere, has a discussion in a religious assembly been
watched so closely. At length 101 voted for Rev. Dr. Fitchett’s motion for
Union, and 14 against. In a manner, befitting a great event, the Conference
made history. A spectator said he would gladly have travelled 10,000 miles
to be present. The Conference sealed the doom of Methodist divisions through-
out Australasia, and made ultimate Union morally certain.” (,Methodist Times ,
January 2nd, 1902.) One after another the various courts of Methodism, with
one exception, agreed to Union upon the basis adopted by the General Confer-
ence, and Union was consummated in New Zealand in 1896, in Queensland in
1898, in South Australia and West Australia in 1900, and in Victoria in 1902.

THE REV. VV. WOOLLS RUTLEDGE.
President of First Methodist Conference.
New South Wales, with characteristic caution, made haste slowly. The
Rev. W. Woolls Rutledge became the leader and the most ardent advocate of
the movement, and with the Rev. E. Crozier (Primitive) and Rev. E. W. Bris-
combe (United hree Methodist) acted as joint secretary of the Methodist
Federal Council appointed by the Conferences concerned. The question was
now referred to the 1 rustee and Quarterly Meetings, and also to the adherents
by means of a referendum. In each case there was a large majority in favour
of Union. But the Conference of 1898, though it affirmed the expediency, did
not vote in favour of organic Union, and the following year it postponed the
question in order that the adherents in the minor Methodist bodies might
record their vote, which was overwhelmingly in favour of Union. And the
Conference of igoo being favourable, it was resolved that Organic Union should
take effect in 1902,
It is not necessary to enter at length into the debates which took place in
the New South Wales Conference, or to enlarge upon the spirit which controlled
them. Some speeches were slightly acrimonious, and at times feeling ran high.
The advocates of Union made good use of the General Conference resolution


that such a step would be for the glory of God. It was also urged that Organic
Union was manifestly needed to avoid “ unholy rivalry ” and waste of effort;
that the common likeness of the Methodist Churches was a reason for Union;
that the success of Union in Canada and Ireland justified Union here ; that the
tendency of the age was towards co-operation ; and that from the standpoint
of the New Testament existing divisions could not be justified. On the other
hand, some argued that, as the branches had cut themselves off from the parent
stock, they must abide by the result of their own action ; that though the spirit
of Union was desirable, uniformity was not to be sought; that the time for
the consummation of Union was not opportune on account of the financial diffi-
culties then existing, and likely to be increased ; that the rank and file of the
adherents in the minor bodies would not be transferred to the United Church, a
case in Queensland being cited as an example ; that it would be calamitous to
let the cherished word “ Wesleyan ” pass out of sight; and that many Wesleyans
did not want Union with the minor bodies, as they preferred amalgamation with
some other Church. Some of these objections were strenuously urged by men
whose age, experience, and worth commanded respect Some so-called argu-
ments were frivolous ; unworthy of the men who uttered and of the Conference
compelled to listen to them. And the tactics adopted by extremists on both
sides savoured of party warfare, and the methods happily not often practised
in a Methodist Conference. However, “all’s well that ends well,” for immediately
on the carrying of the Union vote one of the most pronounced and most highly
honoured of the opponents of Organic Union rose in the Conference and
said that now the vote was decided in the affirmative he would work loyally to
give effect to it. In this spirit Union generally was accepted, and it is the
proud boast that in New South Wales Organic Union has been achieved without
the loss of a property, the secession of a Minister, or the resignation of a Church
Officer.
Steps were now taken to secure the passing of a Bill to legalise Union.
On Wednesday, the 6th March, 1901, a united Conference of the three
Churches entering into the Union was held in the Centenary Hall. It was an
historic gathering, exciting the widest interest, and the spirit manifested gave a
happy augury for the future. The Rev. George Lane, who was voted to the
chair, was supported by the Rev. J. W. Holden, President of the Primitive
Methodist Conference, and the Rev. W. E. Briscombe, President of the United
Free Methodist Assembly. The Revs, W. Halse Rogers and William Atkinson
were appointed Secretaries, with the Revs. J. G. Morris Taylor, William Pearson,
and J. W. Horbury as assistants. The Revs. Rainsford Bavin and Joseph Hop
kins, with Messrs. W. H. Jones and J. Bartlett having offered prayer, the Chair-
man welcomed the brethren before him. In the spirit in which the Wesleyan
Conference had sent an invitation to that gathering the other Conferences
had accepted it, Mr. Lane said. They were met as Christian brethren and ser-
vants of God. They were aware that the early Methodist preachers were men
with a great deal of human nature, which their successors had inherited; and
the laymen were men of like passions. That was an interesting and history-

making Conference, and the effects would be traceable for many years to come.
They all traced their spiritual ancestry to John Wesley, and they were not
ashamed of their name and origin. John Wesley had been placed in the pillory
of persecution, but the revenges of time had made compensation. He who was
pelted and insulted in the streets of England was now honoured by a monument
in Westminster Abbey and in the literature of the world. The greatest writers
testified to the immense debt the world owed to that “great, little man.” Let
them recall and feel the influence of some of his famous sayings; “A clean heart
and a converted world,” “The world is my parish,” “The friend of all and the
enemy of none,” and “The best of all is God is with us.” In things that were
non-essential they would claim and extend to one another liberty, in things
essential they would maintain unity, and in all things charity. He prayed that
God would endue them with wisdom, so that they might do their work in the
fear of God, in the interests of their country, and for the prosperity of their
Church. The Rev. J. W. Holden, on behalf of the Primitive Methodist Con-
ference, reciprocated heartily the cordial welcome extended to them, and the
Rev. E. W. Briscombe concurred. The Rev. W. Woods Rutledge, who had


charge of the business, submitted the Plan of Union previously prepared by
the Rev. James E. Carruthers and proposed by the Federal Council, which was
considered, and, with a few slight amendments, unanimously passed. The reso-
lutions necessary to provide the machinery for the interior working of affairs
pending the consummation of Union were also dealt with, and it was arranged
that a suitable devotional service to mark the consummation of Union be held
in the Centenary Hall, January Ist, 1902. This proposal was supported by the
Rev. George James, who had been labouring in the Colony 42 years, and the
Rev. William Clarke, who, for 45 years, had been in New South Wales. The
Revs. W. Woolls Rutledge and J. E. Carruthers received special acknowledgment
for their valuable labours. At the public gathering above referred to a parch-
ment copy of the Plan of Union was ready for the three Presidents to sign on
behalf of the contracting parties.
How the public viewed the signing of this document may be gathered from
a leading article in the Sydney Morning Herald. “1 he event which will be
marked to-day by the assembling of Methodists at Centenary Hall is of great
Connexional interest, but it also has a considerable importance for the general
community. The reunion of all branches of ‘the people called Methodists’ in
the States of the Commonwealth is, as we show in our retrospect of the move-
ment, not a new ideal. It is in complete harmony with the spirit of the age in
kindred and other directions. . . To the general community it cannot be
otherwise than noteworthy and satisfactory to find the various bodies of
Methodism engaged in a cordial co-operation. No other body, it is safe to say,
even with the fullest recognition of the great awakening of the Church of
England in the last half-century, has such a record in the evangelisation of the
masses of England, Wales, and Ireland. For a century and a half it has gone
with the English speech everywhere, and in the world which Wesley declared
to be his parish it has brought forth fruit abundantly. It is easy to wish
well to a body which has done so much for humanity as this world-embracing
Connexion, once a band of derided and persecuted reformers working amongst
the poorest, the rudest, and the least evangelised of all nominally Christian
peoples of the eighteenth century. . . For the present we have achieved the
desirable end of uniting in essentials, in Church government, in organisation for
the objects of a great Christian society, the whole body of Methodist adherents
in Australia. The immediate result may be expected to be a great develop-
ment of the resources and power of the Methodist Church, and that cannot but
make for the public welfare. Next we have the important result of checking
division and substituting combination. Of the ultimate consequences of such a
policy, whether in moulding the progress of Church organisation in other coun-
tries and conducing to better relations among Christian societies, we cannot
speak ; but the prospect is fairer and more hopeful for every such demonstration
of that unity which is an old Scriptural ideal for brethren.” (January Ist,
1902.)

Steps were now taken to secure the passing of the Methodist Union Bill.
The legal work was done by Messrs. Robson and Cowlishaw. Mr. W. E. V.
Robson, 8.A., is a son of the Hon. William Robson, who had been an ardent
advocate of Union and a loyal friend to Methodism ; and Mr. Reginald Cowli-
shaw is the descendant of a family prominently associated with the Wesleyan
Church for very many years. They requested Mr. Arthur J. Kelynack, LL.B.,
son of the late Dr. Kelynack, to draft the Bill, which was submitted to the
Legislative Council, Wednesday, nth June, 1902, by the Hon. William Robson.
Mr. Robson then presented a petition from the Rev. William Woolls Rutledge,
the President, on behalf of the Conference, praying for leave to bring in a bill
to confirm the Union. Mr. Robson produced copies of the Government Gazette ,
the Sydney Morning Herald , and The Daily Telegraph newspapers containing
the requisite notices, and the petition was received. One week later (ißth
June) Mr. Robson moved for leave to bring in the Bill, and the question was put
and passed. Having produced a certificate to the effect that the sum of
had been paid to the Consolidated Revenue the Bill was read a first time. The
following is its title ;
“A Bill to confirm the Union in New South Wales of the Wesleyan
Methodist Church in New South Wales, the Primitive Methodist Church in New
South Wales, and the United Methodist Free Churches in New South Wales
under the name of the Methodist Church of Australasia; to deal with the real

and personal property in New South Wales of the said uniting Churches ; to
give certain powers to the New South Wales Conference of the said the
Methodist Church of Australasia; to amend the Wesleyan Methodist Church
Property Trust Act, 1889, the Primitive Methodist Church Temporalities Act,
1879, and the Primitive Methodist Church Property Act, 1897; and for other
purposes connected with, or incidental to, the above objects.”
The following Wednesday Mr. Robson moved that the Bill be referred to a
Select Committee to consist of the following members: Sir Arthur Renwick,
Dr. Cullen, Mr. Vickery, Mr. Hepher, Mr. Kerr, Mr. Meeks, Mr. Hawken, and
himself. This Committee, with the exception of Dr. Cullen and Mr. Hepher,
sat on the 2nd of July. The Revs. George Lane, W. Woolls Rutledge, John
Penman, and E. W. Briscombe, with Mr. E. V. Robson, the solicitor for the
Bill, gave evidence ; and on the 9th July the evidence and a copy of the Bill
were presented to the House and ordered to be printed. Passing through the
Legislative Council it was sent down to the Assembly, where Mr. J. L. Fegan,
a Methodist Local Preacher, piloted it through in a remarkably short time. The
only semblance to opposition was an incoherent speech by Mr. Meagher, a

it is said of set purpose, wasted. The Bill became law according to Act of
Parliament, and nothing further remained to legalise Organic Union
The first Conference of United Methodism was held in the Town Hall on
Tuesday, February 25th, 1902. The Rev. George Lane took the chair at 6.30,
being supported by the Presidents and ex-Presidents of the uniting Churches,
while the platform was crowded with Ministerial and lay representatives unable
to find a seat in the Hall. Tim Choir gallery was occupied by a chorus of 250
voices under the conductorship of Mr. W. I. B, Mote, Musical Director of the
Central Mission. The Centenary Hall orchestra also assisted, while the Central
Mission Organist, Mr. Arnold Mote, 8.A., presided at the great organ. The Hall
was crowded, not less than 4500 people being in attendance, and the interest
was sustained for three hours. The proceedings commenced with the well known
hymn “All hail the power of Jesu’s Name,” sung as only the Conference can
sing it, to the time honoured tune, Miles Lane. The Rev. E. W. Briscombe read
a portion of Scripture, the Rev. J. W. Holden prayed, and the Rev. W. Halse
Rogers called the roll. The ballot for the election of the President and Secretary

THE REV. W. HALSE ROGERS.
Secretary First Methodist Conference,
was next taken, when the Rev. W. Woolls Rutledge was elected to the former
office, and the Rev. \V. Halse Rogers to the latter. Writing of the President,
The Methodist (March ist, 1902) said: —
“ The honour of being the first President under the new order has fallen
by a decisive vote to the Rev. W. Woolls Rutldege. There is a peculiar
significance and appropriateness in this. Mr. Rutledge is a native of this State,
a product of the Church that has now called him to its highest office, and has
been honourably and usefully connected with it from nis earliest childhood to
the present time. Taught in its Sunday Schools, converted under its Ministry,
nurtured in its Class Meeting, Australian Methodism can claim him in an
unqualified sense both as one of its sons and one of its seals. From the
beginning of the movement for Organic Union, the President of to-day took
an active part in it and soon became its recognised leader. Never daunted,
never admitting defeat, he persevered with unflagging energy and with
conspicuous ability in the prosecution of the movement, until the consummation
has at length been reached. Mr. Rutledge has given ample evidence of his
great ability as a debater and organiser. In his Circuits he is known as an able


preacher and successful soul-winner. By the public generally he is recognised
as an able, broad-minded, and public spirited citizen; and Methodism may rest
assured that in his hands its interests will be in safe keeping, and that its
reputation in public affairs will be well and amply maintained.” And referring
to the Secretary the same paper adds: “New and yet old, as Secretary of the
Conference, the Rev. W. Halse Rogers well deserves the emphatic mark of res-
pect and confidence accorded to him by his election as first Secretary of the
Conference of United Methodism. Mr. Rogers has made a study of the business
of his office, until he has not only become conversant with all its details, but a
past master in all that goes to make a model Secretary. In the Conference,
and during the year, he toils on with unflagging diligence and unwearying
patience. He overlooks nothing, neglects nothing. The staff surrounding him
on the Conference platform is an admirable one.” The Revs. William Atkinson,
Joseph Woodhouse, W. Pearson and J. K. Turner were nominated Assistant
Secretaries.
In his retiring address the Rev. George Lane said; “This may be rightly
denominated a historic and unique occasion. It is not exactly history-making,
but it is history celebrating. Not only has Methodist Union been consummated
in New South Wales, but virtually over the whole of Australasia. By the Union
it is expected that the Church will be able to present a bolder front to the
enemies of Christ and His Church, to speak with stronger voice upon the great
social and moral questions of the day, to work with its combined resources and
agencies more aggressively and vigorously for the spread of the Gospel of Christ,
and the evangelisation of this country, and the Islands of the Seas committed
to our care. Unless such results shall follow this Union, it will fail to accomplish
the good predicted of it by its advocates, and the just expectation of those who
have entered into it. With our new relationship of Union, and our united forces
of Ministers, preachers, teachers and other workers ; of Churches, Schools and
Funds, we have taken on an increased responsibility to God, and the people of
this land. We have wider fields of Christian usefulness set before us, mightier
powers of faith, prayer, testimony, and spiritual influence, less waste of men, money,
time and machinery, in overlapping ; large opportunities and greater aptitudes for
the work of God in teaching, converting, training, and inspiring men and women
in the Christian life and character and service. We shall have need of wisdom,
patience and mutual forbearance in the arrangements and adjustments which
will have to be made by this Conference in relation to Circuits and Ministers.
The difficulties will be chiefly financial, and we may surely expect that under
the Divine guidance, and with the exercise of ordinary prudence and Christian
self-sacrifice, these difficulties may be overcome.”
The President then read a telegram of fraternal greetings from the Rev,
Dr. Fitchett, President of the Victorian Conference, and the Rev. George Lane,
as President of the General Conference, conveyed the congratulation of that
body,'and expressed the hope that united Methodism might be made a lasting


blessing to the community. Congratulations then followed from the represen-
tatives of other Churches. The Rev. Canon Pain, M.A., spoke on behalf of the
Archbishop of Sydney, who was unavoidably absent. Ihe Archbishop sent the
following greeting: “ I greet the United Conference in the name of our one Lord
and Saviour. I welcome the fact that in the Union of the Methodist Churches,
there is a testimony to an increasing desire for more effective co-operation in
spiritual work, and for lessening the divisions which makes such co-operation
difficult. Organic re-union between the various Christian Churches may be still
a dream of the future, or even prove to be an impracticable ideal, but to throw
down needless barriers, and to foster all possible fraternisation between different
sections of the Church, it is an object to be constantly aimed at and prayed
for. I greet the Conference cordially, and trust that the Union now consum-
mated, may, under God’s good providence, tend to the promotion of true godliness
throughout the Commonwealth of Australia.” The Rev. Dr. Cameron, M.A.,
Moderator of the Presbyterian Assembly, represented the Presbyterian Church,
and the Revs. George Campbell and Dr. Fordyce, M.A., Congregationalists,
Revs. F. Hibberd and Dr. Porter, Baptists, and Lieut. Col. Hoskins, Salvation
Army, voiced the good wishes of the bodies to which they belonged. The Hon.
William Robson and the Rev. E. Crozier responded to the greetings, and the
President concluded a meeting which was “ historic, enthusiastic and devout.”
An extract from The Methodist will fittingly close this chapter. An
occasion, such as was witnessed on Tuesday evening, does not occur often in
the history of a State or of a Church. It marked the opening of a new era in the
history of one of the most progressive and aggressive of the religious forces
of the State, and formally invested Methodism with an additional opportunity
and responsibility as one of the leading Churches of the land. The full signifi-
cance of the occasion has hardly yet been realized by many of our own people.
But sympathetic onlookers of other denominations have not been slow to recognise
the full measure of meaning involved in the new circumstances upon which our
Church has entered. The speeches of the visiting delegates on Tuesday evening
supplied abundant evidence of this, as well as of the broadly Christian and Catho-
lic approval with which the Union of our forces is regarded by all our allies in
the field of Christian service. It would, of course, be far too much to say that
‘ Humanity, with all its fears,
With all its hopes of future years,
Is hanging breathless on thy fate!’
But it is only affirming sober fact to assert that all who wish well to the best
interests of the community are expecting not a little of added influence and use-
fulness from us because of the event of which Tuesday’s proceedings were in
one respect the consummation, and in another the commencement.”

CHAPTER XXIII.
THE TENT MISSION MOVEMENT,
o\i
THE GOSPEL UNDER CANVAS.
TO define precisely the influences leading up to the remarkable series
of meetings constituting the Tent Mission Movement is not an easy
task. But we may state in the first place that the Century Fund
Movement in New South Wales, having for its object the raising of
50,000 guineas with which to develop and strengthen the work of the Metho-
dist Church, was one factor; for it suggested to the Hon. Ebenezer Vickery,
M.L.C., to whose liberality the Tent Mission movement was entirely due, the
question: If the Methodist Church can set itself the task of raising 50,000
guineas why should it not aim at winning 50,000 souls for Christ ? Another
factor was the pressing needs of the people outside the Church’s influence, and
apparently beyond the reach of ordinary methods. “ God brings the world’s
needs before us, and we avert our gaze. The dry bones are filling the valleys
on every hand, and we refuse to see the ghastly slaughter sin is making; and
so for want of more Ezekiels who are willing to cry, ‘ Oh, hear ye the word of
the Lord,’ there is no shaking among the children of men, nor is bone coming to
His bone. There is no army of young converts crowding into the Churches
filled with the Spirit of God.” But God was revealing His will to one of His
servants, who not only heard His voice, but with whom were the desire and
the means with which to attempt something for the unsaved masses. The
Simultaneous Mission held in Sydney in November, 1901, revealed clearly how
this work could be done. It was seen that the Gospel could be taken to the
country districts by means of a suitable travelling tent, and all necessary equip-
ments down to the organ and enquiry room with an experienced Evangelist and
Assistant to accompany the tent. If the Evangelist were forthcoming, Mr.
Vickery resolved that the matter of expense should not block the wayj and
with a well thought out plan that finally embraced nearly the whole State, he
decided that Tent Missions should be held in every town in New South Wales
with a population of 400 souls. This was carried into effect with unflagging
zeal and persistency. ‘‘l am free to admit,” said the Rev. W. G. Taylor, ‘that
although associated with Evangelistic work all my life I have never known a
revival of religion like unto this. It has been compared by one to the remark-
able Missions conducted over 30 years ago by ‘ California Taylor. Others


have suggested that the record in many places resembles the scenes witnessed
under the Ministry of the earlier Methodist Preachers, while the feeling has been
expressed by several that in some of its details we have been carried back to
the Irish Revival of 1859. . . . The characteristics of this great work have
been absolute consecration by the Evangelists and helpers coupled with a
professed faith in the willingness of the Holy Ghost to save men. On the
part of the crowds who have attended there has been from the start, a remark-
able spirit of hearing . . . followed by an agony of prayer, culminating in
a clear revelation of Jesus Christ as their personal Saviour.” Of such work
there should be permanent record ; and this chapter is written to the glory of
God, and for the encouragement of all labourers in the great vineyard of
Christ.
It was determined to operate first in eighteen different centres on the
South Coast, beginning at Nowra. The Rev. D. O’Donnell and Mr. Robertson
were secured as Missioners, the Central Mission Committee temporarily sur-
rendered Mr. Gilbert, the Seaman’s Missionary as Choirmaster and open-air
preacher, and Mr. S. E. Vickery undertook the management of the tent, the
acetylene gas generator and apparatus, and kept the tent brilliantly lighted
and cheerful, a task often presenting grave difficulties. Three tents were
employed in the South Coast Mission, capable of seating 3 00 > 600, and 1,000
respectively, each tent being furnished with platform, organ, acetylene gas
apparatus, an enquiry room, hymn books, Marked Testaments, and suitable
literature. The first tent was dedicated to the work of soul saving in the
Domain, Sydney, by the Executive of the Evangelical Council on Boxing
Day, 1901. The gathering was remarkable, for the power of the Holy Ghost
came upon the people, and they received proof that God accepted the offering
of the tent and answered the many prayers offered that day.
Next day the Tent was sent to Nowra, and the people, wrote Rev. H. Wheen,
with a great deal of interest, watched the new tent being put into position.
Its coming had been much talked about. Preparatory meetings in the Churches,
little prayer meetings extemporised here and there, a carefully planned system
of advertisement in the newspapers and by neat programmes, and bold blue
posters had tended to make the Tent Mission a topic of conversation in every
quarter before a single tent peg had been driven. And when the fair structure
was at last set up in the most central position in the town, no further announce-
ment was needed, as everyone knew that the Tent had come. The great Evan-
gelistic enterprise that was destined to bring such wonderful blessings to the
South Coast opened on Friday, January 3rd, 1902. The Tent was at first pro-
vided with seats for 460 persons, and its was nearly filled at the first meeting.
A little later it was found necessary to get additional seating accommodation
for 120 more, and even then there were at times large numbers who could not
gain admission. The first Saturday night a deluge of rain fell exactly at the
hour of meeting. But on Sunday evening a large congregation came through
the wild storm. The weather moderated during Sunday night, and to the close
delightful weather conditions prevailed. The early morning prayer meeting
grew in interest and power from the start, until over 80 people gathered for


prayer. Another striking feature of this Mission was the large and enthusiastic
open air meetings led by Ministers of the various Churches, assisted by the
balvation Array officers. Several Army bandsmen brought their instruments,
and Evangelist Gilbert gave solos on his violin. Laymen of all the Churches
found themselves exhorting sinners to repent, and many fine addresses were
delivered m the open air.
The blessing vouchsafed night after night was truly wonderful. Old men
u ll j u rCn ’ Un £ men anc * busy tradesmen and anxious mothers,
heard the Gospel, and found Jesus. Many came from distant country places, to
return with the new song in their mouths. Young men in the stores and offices
sought Christ, and then diligently set themselves to bring others to Him.
A travelling company visiting the town during the progress of the Mission found
it impossible to gather an audience. And the Mission was at high tide when
the end came. It seemed impossible to close the Mission on the date pre-
viously arranged, and it was therefore decided, with the assistance of the Rev.
W. G. Taylor, who opened at Berry for Mr. Robertson, to continue three days
longer in the School of Arts. The closing meetings will be a landmark for
many a year to come. Over two hundred people passed through the Enquiry
Room at the Nowra Mission.
The town of Berry, situated 10 miles from Nowra, was the next place
visited. A remarkable Sunday morning service was held in the tent, at which
a large congregation gathered, the Churches being closed. The congregations
throughout were excellent. Ihe Enquiry Room was often taxed to accommo-
date the crowd of seekers. The cordial feeling amongst the Churches was
most beautifully voiced at a united service in the Tent at n o’clock on Sunday
morning, the 19th January. The Mission at Berry had also to be extended, the
closing meeting being held in the School of Arts, which was crowded. Here
100 persons professed conversion.
The Kiama Mission, which followed that of Berry, was hampered by the
Agricultural Show, and also by the fact that the Mission forces were divided.
But notwithstanding these obstacles the power of the Lord was present to heal
and many of God’s children were greatly refreshed. The Missions at Jamberoo.
and Shellharbour were also much blessed, though it was observed that simul-
taneous Missions in country places where the villages are not more than six
miles apart are not advisable. Ministers and Christians have their interest
divided where they should be united, and they are not able to throw their full
weight into the work. The Tent at Kiama was pitched in a central spot so that
many passers-by heard the message. The nightly attendances averaged 250,
which was good when the unfavourable conditions were considered. The Sun-
day congregations were very large. About seventy persons entered the Enquiry
Tent, a large number of these being adherents of the Church of England.
On the last day of January the Tent was removed to Wollongong, where
Ministers and friends hailed joyfully the prospect of the Mission, and entered
most heartily and zealously into the preparations. They held meetings for
prayer, made house-to-house visitations, and issued notices and invitations to


the meetings. A large Committee was formed with the Rev. C. A. White,
M.A., as Organising Secretary for the district. After many weeks’ preparation
and prayer they now looked for the outpouring of the Spirit on the larger
populations about to be visited. The “ Cathedral Tent,” as the first Tent was
called, was erected in the centre of Wollongong, while another tent was set up
amidst the population of Bulk. The attendance at the opening meetings at
Wollongong was not large, but it speedily increased as the power of God
deepened, and nightly the Enquiry Room had from twenty to forty of all ages
and conditions pressing into the Kingdom of Heaven. The town was thoroughly
stirred, and the gracious influence radiated throughout the district, raising expec-
tations of good in the surrounding centres soon to be visited. An eye witness
of the Wollongong Mission said the result was truly marvellous. “ The service
in the Town Hall was the greatest, most representative and solemn gathering
that it was my privilege to attend, and a glorious testimony to the great spiritual
effect of the Mission in Wollongong. A blessed work is being done at Mount
Keira and Mount Kembla. I went up to the service at Mount Kembla. The
tent was quite full, although many present seemed to stand at bay as it were,
an intense, emotion with an evident assent to the Preacher’s burning words
were imprinted on every face and feature. . . . The resolve to promote
this South Coast Mission was Heaven-inspired. Its success to the present is
so great, that I am not surprised it is to be extended elsewhere.” Over three
hundred and fifty persons passed through the Enquiry Room at Wollongong.
All the neighbouring centres were visited either by Mr. O’Donnell’s or Mr.
Robertson’s Tent. At Mount Kembla Heights, a village greatly deteriorated
by the influences of a private gambling club situated outside the boundaries of
the Mount Kembla Company’s property, an evil influence had long been at
work. The Company had not permitted a public house to get a footing within
its boundaries. Because of the influence of this club, Mount Kembla was looked
upon as unpromising soil for the Mission. Many distressed women said to
the visitors; “ I hope you will be able to shut up the drinking and gambling
club.” Earnest prayer was offered for the Divine blessing to fall on Mount
Kembla. Although at first the outlook was not promising there was soon a
movement among the ‘ dry bones.’ The workers began to reap, and the local
club lost some of its members. Similar reports of encouraging success came
from Corrimal, Balgownie, Dapto, Albion Park, Unanderra, Port Kembla, and
Clifton.
The Mission at Bulk was equally successful, the outpouring of the Spirit
on the word preached in these places reminding one of the revival records in the
days of Whitefield and Wesley. There were fifty persons at the morning
prayer meeting, while at night the big tent was much too small, many having to
stand. Scores were brought under conviction. The Mission closed with a
tremendous crowd in and around the tent, and there were several conversions,
chiefly among the men. Indeed, during the last days of the Mission, the con-
verts were almost entirely men. The number passing through the Enquiry
Room at Bulk was two hundred and ninety-two. The same story came from
Balgownie, where the people could not be packed in the Tent, so great was the


crowd. “This is a wonderful work of God,” wrote the Rev. D. O’Donnell.
Ihe moral tone of the town is changed. I am told that now an oath is
se om heard at the Mount Keira mine. We had a great storm last night, but
the Tent was full. God has wrought wonders at Balgownie. . . . Nearly
two hundred have passed through the Enquiry Room, some of whom are said
to have been the worst characters in the district.” Corrimal and Belambi
reported in similar strains: “ This is a hard place, but God is working power-
fully. Five Roman Catholics have been converted at one service.”
From Corrimal the Tent was moved on to Helensburgh, being pitched
there for Mr. O Donnell to open on Easter Sunday, 30th March. Helensburgh
was described as a very wicked place, with but few Christians to assist in the
work. But on April sth the Missioner writes: “We thank God for such
showers of blessing. In the six nights we have totalled one hundred and
thirty-six converts. And two nights after he sent a telegram to the effect:
Grand meetings last night; forty-two souls saved.” The Mission should have
concluded on April 6th, but the success was so marked that it was continued
some time longer. The total number of converts was 234. This concluded
the eighteen Missions on the South Coast, at all of which God was pleased to
send showers of blessing. This remarkable series of meetings was closed by
a Convention in the Wollongong Town Hall on April 7th, Bth, and gth. Four
sessions were held daily, and the Hall was filled to the doors on Tuesday and
Wednesday evenings. The whole Convention was pitched in the highest key,
and equalled the best of the famous Geelong gatherings in interest and spiritual
power. Crowds of converts were present, and it is believed that many were
led on to the best possible lines of Christian service.
To tabulate the results of Missions is not always wise, but we may add that
2,735 passed through the Enquiry Rooms during these 18 South Coast Mis-
sions. Of the permanent results we may not speak definitely. “ That the
parable of the sower will apply to the work of the Master as time passes,” wrote
the Rev. Charles White, “ there can be but little doubt. But while this may be
so it is to be hoped that ‘ good ground ’ has received much the greater part of
the precious seed sown by the Mission, and that manifold rich results in the
way of ‘ fruits of righteousness ’ will follow in time and Eternity. A young
convert, however old in years, is no match in his own strength for the devil in a
thousand and one ways in which he will present himself for temptation ; in
the strength of God, however, the feeblest and humblest believer in Christ will
be more than conqueror over the evil one and all the devices of hell. Nothing
is more true than the words of the children’s well-known hymn, which say
‘ Satan trembles when he sees
The weakest saint upon his knees.’
The Mission has come and is almost over. And having finished the blessed
work Divinely assigned to them, indirectly if not directly, the two Missioners
will be leaving us soon. Christ will remain in our midst, however, as He did
among His disciples on the Mount of Transfiguration after the departure of
Moses and Elias. And with His loving presence, and heavenly influence, all
will be well with those who love, trust, and obey Him. . . . The great


Illawarra Mission was clearly designed by our Heavenly Father not to take
place in vain, nor will He suffer its spiritual results to come to naught. The
movement was not the work of man, but of a Triune God to Whom be all
praise, honour and glory now and for ever. Amen.”
“ Altogether,” Mr. White continues, “ the magnitude of the movement
and its blessed results far surpass the most sanguine hopes entertained at the
outset. The movement grew as it proceeded and attracted in its scope all
sorts and conditions of men and women from the highest to the lowest ranks
of society under the one banner of the Lord Jesus Christ. It appeared at first
as if it were a cloud on the horizon, not larger than a man’s hand, and speedily
spread over the whole of the Illawarra firmament, until copious showers of the
Holy Spirit descended upon thousands of thirsty souls throughout the com-
munity so richly favoured from on High. One of the many blessings charac-
teristic of the Mission has been the whole-souled Christian sympathy, and per-
sonal co-operation, of the local Ministers in connection with this movement.
Protestant Clergymen of all denominations, ministering in our midst, are found
working hand in hand in a cordial manner with the two strange Missioners ;
while, however, the Church of England Clergymen at Nowra, Berry, Jam-
beroo, Kiama, and Dapto worked heart and soul with the Mission those at
Wollongong and Bulk held aloof. They did not join the crew of the Mission
Life Boat; but it may be taken for granted that they stood close upon the
shore, watched her every movement among the billows of a Satan-tossed sea
with keen interest, and hailed with delight every soul rescued by her from
the surging surf of sinfulness, in which they were being engulfed into eternal
* »
rum.
The Rev. D. O. Donnell asks: “ What are the evidences ‘to the man in
the street ’ that this work is genuine ? A very proper and pertinent question.
I am a staunch believer in the doctrine of ‘ works meet for repentance.’ Well
here are some of them: First, payment of debts. Tradesmen report the settle-
ment of accounts they had long since regarded as bad. Second, a pure language
turned upon the people. Every man I have spoken to on this question tells
me that the language ordinarily used in the coal-pits is inexpressibly awful.
This is greatly changed. It is said that in the Mount Keira pit an oath
has scarcely been heard since the Mission. One poor fellow getting hurt,
forgot himself one day, but he fell upon his knees there and then, and asked
God’s forgiveness. Third, a fair day’s work. The proprietor of one of the
mines told me that the biggest day’s output of coal they ever had, followed
the Mission. Fourth, attendance at Church. All the Churches report greatly
increased congregations and increase in the membership. This is true of the
Anglican Church, some of whose Ministers are the only ones who have held
aloof from the movement.”
At the meeting of the Wollongong Executive Mission Committee resolu-
tions were passed in which the members expressed their gratitude to God and
rejoiced exceedingly in the manifest work of the Spirit through the district; it
desired, so it said, to record its profound gratitude to Almighty God for the
blessings vouchsafed to His servants. And the Methodist Church in Nowra


THE REV. D. O’DONNELL.
wrote: “The United Tent Mission just closed has filled us with gratitude to
God. Ne\ ei has the Shoalhaven district received so mighty a spiritual benefit.
Such multitudes never before came together in this district to hear the Gospel.
Our Quarterly Meeting places on record its devout thankfulness for this
remarkable religious revival, and also expresses its deep gratitude to the donor
of the funds by which the Mission was sustained. Over 60 connected with our
Church professed to find Christ. ‘To God be the glory/ ”
A deluge of requests now poured in on Mr. Vickery for Missions in all
parts of New South Wales ; and so urgent were the requests and so blessed
the results already achieved, it was felt that the work should be continued on
an extended scale, until every town in New South Wales was brought within
the zone of its gracious influence. Letters also came from other States, Dr.
Fitchett, President of the Victorian Conference, writing; “I am delighted to
hear of the good work done in the Tent Mission at Goulburn. Your Tent
Mission indeed has been a great blessing to New South Wales. But you are
a good Methodist, and, like John Wesley, take the world as your parish. Your
Tent Mission has now been at work in New South Wales for a long time;
why should it not take a wider sphere ? Victoria would be for it a new and
rich field sure to yield a splendid harvest. I write now unofficially, and would
like to know, whether, if our Conference invites you to extend your Mission to
Victoria in connection with our Church, will you be disposed to favourably
consider the invitation. Praying God to bless you abundantly.” Mr. Vickery


was willing to “ favourably consider ” that or any other similar request, but
to extend the Mission to other States was to place upon himself a burden of
work to which he did not feel equal.
To overtake the work of Missioning 200 centres during 1902 and 1903 it
became necessary to equip four additional Tents, and to obtain the services of
other Evangelists. In addition to those already in the field the services there-
fore of the Rev. E. Shanks, Rev. W. Blackwell, M.A., Rev. D. C. Davidson,
M.A., Rev. W. H. Scurr, and Mr. J. T. Leafe, of London, were secured, and a
Tent, designated the Central Mission Tent, was placed in charge of Messrs.
Gilbert, A. E. Walker, and J. Allison. In times of emergency through illness
generous help was rendered by Rev. W. G. Taylor, Rev. H. B. Hammond, Mr.
J. J. Virgo, and others. Thus at one time there were not less than seven
tents in full swing, each being efficiently manned and properly equipped. But
even then the supply was not equal to the demand. But if it
were an impossible task to grant all requests how much more
difficult it is to write a detailed or worthy account of this blessed and exceptional
work. To do so would require volumes, and even then the wonderful story
could not be fully told. Those familiar with the work would still exclaim:
“ The half has not been told.” Indeed, there are many beautifully pathetic
incidents which it is impossible to tell, and which, if set up in cold type would
lose their charm. Some of the scenes witnessed at the Tent Mission services
are too sacred to be held up to public gaze. Sufficient to know that the eye
of God witnessed them, and that upon human witnesses they have stamped
impressions which time will not efface. Here we can only name a few places at
which Missions were conducted, reserving space in which to particularise three
or four Missions, representative of many others.
The Central Mission Tent, under the charge of Messrs. Gilbert, Walker,
and Allison, was removed to Dungog, where one of the most successful, and
in many ways most remarkable of all the Tent Missions was conducted, the
Missioners being assisted throughout by the Rev. R. Mowbray, Methodist
Minister. The Missioners reported a grand opening meeting when the Tent
was crowded, and there were sixty_ enquirers. Mr. Gilbert wrote; “ The
Dungog Mission will not be forgotten. Never in its history has there been
anything like it in this place, and the most remarkable meeting was the last
one. As our Tent had to be taken down to catch the boat Wednesday morn-
ing, the largest hall in Dungog was taken, being lit up with acetylene gas.
The hall was full, at least half of the population of the place being there.
We began the open air service at 7 o’clock, and the meeting inside at 7.45,
when we continued praise and testimony until 8 o’clock. We commenced with
a hymn, ‘What a Friend we have in Jesus.’ I had prepared an address, but I
was led to speak first to Christians, then to the young converts and afterwards
to the unconverted. When the invitation was given there was such a rush
for the Enquiry Room as I have never seen before, and that without any
pressing. I did not leave the platform ; the people came up the steps over the
platform to the room at the back. There were sights never to be forgotten.
Members of families who had been at variance were hanging on each other’s


necks. Some of the leading business men of the town, who lately had been
at law, were locked in each other’s arms kissing one another. One man who
had been a victim to drink, and for whom everything that could be done had
been done, rushed through the back of the Hall over the platform saying as he
went: ‘ There is a dreadful row in hell to-night ever my taking this stand.’
Old companions in sin were locked in each other’s arms. Mothers and fathers
embraced sons and daughters who had been wayward but had now come to
Christ. One old man even said that if they stopped a fortnight longer the
devil would take his departure from Dungog. When we were leaving in the
buggy several young men came to bid us farewell. As they were weeping I
offered prayer. We shall never forget the scene.”
The Rev. R. Mowbray, the Organising Secretary, adds: “ I have often
heard people say they did not know how or where to praise God. This is
precisely what I feel at the present time. I do not know how to begin to
describe to you the blessed times we have had. God has been with us in a
very wonderful manner. Old and young, male and female, have been made
to feel the power of the Gospel. ‘ Bless the Lord, oh my soul, and all that is
within me bless His Holy name.’ Despite the rain and darkness, and it rained
in torrents, the people came for miles. To my knowledge some came as far as
twenty-four miles, and at times the tent was packed. The cry everywhere has
been: ‘We have never seen it in this wise before.’ The last meeting was held
in the Victoria Hall as the tent had been sent to the next place. Early in
the morning one of the converts gave me ios. to pay the rent of the Hall, and
as the meeting was commencing someone else sent me another half sovereign
for the same purpose, so that the rent of the Hall was secured twice over.
It was glorious; forty seekers, nearly all adults. The local paper said: ‘lt
is not our intention to enumerate the enormous conversions of the Missioners,
but the good they have done promises to be felt in Dungog for many years to
come, for the professors of faith who stood up that night were certainly moved
to earnestness by an unseen power.’ This is a splendid testimony from an
unexpected source. In all there have been 212 professed conversions. A
great number more are now in trouble on account of their sins. What hath
the Lord wrought! The thank offering amounted to over £ig, and when-
paying all local expenses we expect to have a large balance set down for the
Door of Refuge. To God be the glory.” Mr. Mowbray adds in another com-
munication written after the second Mission in Dungog: “Personally I cannot
tell how grateful I am for the Missioners’ visits and work. This Circuit has
indeed been blessed, and though, during the last visit, not so many Methodists
were among the seekers, yet largely as a result of the Mission we have three
Y.P.C.E. Societies, and probably will commence a fourth. We are making
arrangements for building one new Church and rebuilding another. In all
during the two visits to this Circuit no less than five hundred seekers must
have passed through the Enquiry Room.”
Referring again to the second Mission which took place in July, I9°3>
that is, after a lapse of nine months, Mr. Mowbray stated that he only knew of
two converts who had not continued faithful ; while at Bandon Grove there-


were whole families brought to Christ nine months ago who were still loyal
Christians. Very successful meetings were held on this occasion at Dungog,
Bandon Grove, and other places in the surrounding district. At the Methodist
Quarterly Meeting one of the members told Mr. Gilbert that since the first
revival the Circuit had paid its way, a thing which it had been unable to do
for a long time previously. Numbers of letters were received from the con-
verts, the most remarkable probably being that of a man who called himself an
“ old sinner.” In thanking the Missioners for the salvation he had received as
the result of their visit he said: “ I never heard anything like it since I heard
Dicky Weaver, a converted collier in the Old Country.”
The Mission at Bega may also be referred to as another illustration of the
remarkable work of the Tent Missions. Great interest was taken before the
Mission commenced. The Executive Committee prepared the way by print-
ing 450 large posters, two thousand tickets of invitation, and four thousand
hand-bills. The Churches concerned worked harmoniously from the first.
The United prayer meeting was a time not soon to be forgotten, and the people
seemed to realise that the blessings of the Mission were already upon them.
Mr. Robertson was in charge of the Mission, being assisted by Mr. W. Arnold
and Mr. James Graham. This enabled them to work Bega, and to Mission the
•outlying places.
The Tent arrived at Bega on Thursday, March sth, and a band of willing
helpers soon had it erected, and furnished in an excellent position. An open
air service was conducted on Saturday evening, being led by Mr. Graham, who
was well supported by an energetic band of workers. The first service in the
Tent was the Sunday Morning Prayer Meeting, which was well attended. At
11 o’clock the united Service was held, followed in the afternoon by a children’s
service. In the evening the Tent was crowded, though the thermometer regis-
tered 108 degrees. The Spirit of God manifested His presence in great
power, and several passed into the Enquiry Room. Throughout the week the
meetings grew in intensity of feeling and power, and many remarkable con-
versions took place night after night, the whole district being moved. The
Men’s Meeting on the second Sunday afternoon was a time to be remembered.
The purity pledge was signed by 160 men. The closing service was held on
Monday, March 23rd, and was a time of great blessing. The tent was again
crowded, and an opportunity being given for testimony, praise flowed like a
stream of grace. The total number of enquirers passing through the Enquiry
Room at Bega was two hundred and fifty-two.
Referring to this Mission Mr. Arnold wrote; “ God has been pleased to
own and bless in a marvellous way the Mission in this town. From the open-
ing service the attendances have been enormous, and the deep interest dis-
played by the Church folk is God’s reward for the faithfulness of those who
for the past three months have been turning everybody and everything upside
down. Up to date nearly two hundred souls have been led to the Saviour. In
the great eternity there will be an exceedingly great army who will praise God
for His goodness in sending the flapping canvas under which these souls yielded
to Him. I gave an address to the young ladies at the Deaconess’s High School

A TENT MISSION SERVICE.— MR ROBERTSON AND MR. S. E. VICKERY IN CHARGE


on Thursday last. The Church of England Clergyman was present. The
open air meetings which have been held every evening have proved a great
blessing and a source of strength to the Mission. On Saturday next Mr.
Graham and myself go to Bemboka to commence a six days’ Mission ; from
there we go to Wolumla and then to Tanja. The Holy Ghost has manifested
Himself in a wonderful way.” Among the permanent results of the Mission
in this district was a revived interest in Church work generally, and an exten-
sion of the sphere of operations.
On the North Coast the Lismore District reported a most wonderful
work, in which the attendances were remarkable and the number of conver-
sions most encouraging. Grafton and the surrounding district, including
Maclean, and Brushgrove spoke of crowded attendances “ inside and out,” and
of overflowing gatherings with most satisfactory results. West Maitland and
Singleton had splendid meetings, the attendance at Singleton being pheno-
menal. Armidale, Tamworth, and all neighbouring centres were visited, while
the towns in the Newcastle District told of wonderful scenes of saving grace.
Orange, Bathurst, Dubbo, Lithgow, Mudgee, and nearly all the towns along
the Western line sent similar reports ; while the South-west, including Wagga,
Albury, and other large centres, was visited. But the efforts were not
restricted to these centres of population, for the most distant towns in the “ back-
blocks ” came in for their share of blessing, thus being able to add their tribute
of praise to the general tale of rejoicing and gratitude. Even such places as
Gilgandra, Wilcannia, White Cliffs, Bourke, and Cobar were not overlooked,
the success in some of these places being equally noted, though on a smaller
scale than that of the larger centres.
It was thought advisable to hold extended Missions in the month of April
in the Waterloo and Balmain West districts. The Ministers at these places
being communicated with, called a meeting of Church workers to make arrange-
ments for the furtherance of the project. At Waterloo, Mr. Virgo, who had
been Organising Secretary of the Melbourne Simultaneous Mission, attended
this first meeting and gave a full account of the conditions necessary to make
the Mission a success. This Meeting was held on Monday, February 16th, in
the Methodist Church, Botany Street. The Rev. E. Fox was elected Secretary
to the Committee, and Mr. Pontifex was appointed Organiser. Several friends
expressed their willingness to open their houses for cottage Meetings. A
United Prayer Meeting was arranged for half-past eight on Sunday, 22nd, to
which the Salvation Army officers and all interested in Church work were
invited. The Botany Street Methodist Church was well filled, and everything
was done to make the Mission a success. The first Sunday the Rev. D. C.
Davidson, M.A., addressed about 300 men in the afternoon, while Mr. Robert-
son spoke to a large congregation the same evening. At the Sunday morning
Prayer Meeting there was an attendance of upwards of 200 persons. Though
the weather was unfavourable the attendance was good, a remark which
applies throughout the whole Mission, extending over a month. The last
Sunday evening the gathering numbered over 1,000 persons. ‘‘lt would
require,” says an eye-witness, “ a volume instead of a page to set forth all the


\\ onderful incidents of the Mission, and eternity alone will reveal the splendid
possessions won for the Redeemer’s Kingdom. We believe our district will
be all the better as the result of this sustained effort; and certainly the Churches
should gain a large accession to the number of workers for Jesus. The hearts
of many aie filled with gratitude to the Missioners for their earnest efforts ;
and we believe all who desire the good of their fellow men will bless the Pro-
moter of the Pent Mission, for such a movement was practically impossible
without his aid. Certainly the blessing of those ready to perish will rest upon
him ; for many hearts and homes are filled with Christian joy.” More than
700 people passed through the Enquiry Room,
Balmain was another district selected in which to hold an extended cam-
paign. The locality chosen was known as “ The Devil’s Allotment.” The
Tent was pitched on the 29th July, and placed in charge of Messrs. Barrett
Brothers, and Mr. J. T. Wynn of Bulli. Ihe local Christian workers declared
that the spot was just the place for such a work, as it was the rendezvous of
gamblers and Sabbath breakers. God blessed the work from the start. The
congregation, consisting largely of non-Church goers, was drawn by the attrac-
tive and helpful music provided by the Barrett Brothers. This Mission dif-
in its methods from those conducted elsewhere, such aids being
brought in as hand-bells, musical glasses, a male quartette, and the Sunbeam
Choir. When two weeks expired, instead of closing the Mission, such were
the possibilities apparent that it was decided to continue, to develop and
consolidate the good work done, and to proceed for nine weeks more. Scores
of young men, who had previously made the place notorious, were regular in
their attendance, and by the wise conduct of those in charge their attention
was won and kept. As the closing time drew near many lamented the fact
that the tent could not permanently remain. Mr. Vickery then decided to
erect a well-appointed Mission Hall in which to carry on the work, securing
at the same time the services of the Barrett Brothers as Missioners. A suit-
able corner allotment was purchased and the building commenced. But as the
Tent was required, according to agreement, for North Sydney, and the Hall
was not complete, the work was continued in the Balmain College. One con-
vincing proof of the extent and genuineness of the work was the sustained
interest in the 7 o’clock Sunday morning Prayer Meeting, which was often
attended by 70 or 80 people. Lantern Services, Saturday evening Children’s
Meetings, week day and afternoon services, the use of charts and blackboards,
and several other novel features, were introduced into this work. Assistance
was also rendered by the Rev. W. G. Taylor and Mr. J. J. Virgo. The local
paper, referring to this work, said: “During the two months of the Tent
Mission 420 persons passed through the Enquiry Room, and about twelve
have since decided for Christ in the College, giving a total of 432. It is by
far the most successful Mission ever known in the district, and residents say
a greater work has been done than is apparent. Many of the converts, now
regular attendants, had not been to religious service for years. Some of these
have since joined neighbouring Churches. Even prize-fighters help to swell
the number of enquirers. The police were always outside, and one of them


heard the message, which God blessed to his conversion.” Many touching
and beautiful incidents connected with this work could be given, if space per-
mitted.
This unique Hall was opened in November, 1903, and was named the
Helping Hand Mission Hall. It stands at the corner of Evans and Ewell
Streets, Rozelle, and was finished in a manner that entitles it to rank as a
most suitable building for the class of work contemplated. The basement
was built of brick with suitable foundations, and was well lighted. The build-
ing has a staircase leading to the Upper Hall, and also a large entrance from
Evans Street. The floor is of alkalite, and the room is intended to be used
for social gatherings, Sunday School, Christian Endeavour, Young Men’s, and
other meetings. There is lavatory accommodation at the rear, and a copper,
with gas fittings, trough and sink, and accommodation for the preparation of
food for social gatherings. A portable partition divides the basement into
two rooms. The partition is built in sections, which slide in grooves, and
which may be utilised as tables for tea and other meetings when the building
is occupied. The basement is lofty and commodious.
The main Hall has two entrances, one at the corner of Ewell and Evans
Stieets, and the other at the rear of the building in Ewell Street. “On
entering the Hall in the day time,” said the local paper, “ one cannot but
express pleasing surprise at seeing such a lofty and handsome place. The
building covers the full area of land, and is built of red wood, lined with
specially selected kauri, V-jointed, stained, and varnished. The height of
the walls in the Hall is 18ft., and the gable roof another 15ft. The roof is of
iron (with a vent ridge), lined inside with varnished kauri, and between the
iron and kauri, felt is placed to prevent inconvenience from heat, etc. The
principals and the beams are of Oregon, stop champered and varnished, giving
a Church-like appearance. There are thirteen large windows, fitted with
Cathedral glass ; and the colour thrown on the varnished walls and ceilings
causes a pretty effect. Round the walls are moulded cedar dados and skirting.
At the Evans Street end of the Hall a platform is erected two-thirds across
the room. There is no reading desk or pulpit; simply a table and cabinet
organ. Alongside the platform is a space curtained off to be used as vestry
and enquiry room. On the back wall is placed a framed oil painting, lift,
bin. x 6ft., depicting the Ascension of Christ. At the other end is a gallery,
continued half way round on each side, built in a light looking style, with open
iron balustrading. The latest designs in gas fittings have been fixed. Chairs
have been supplied, giving a more comfortable appearance than stiff-looking
forms or pews. The main Hall will comfortably seat 500, and the gallery
150. The basement will seat 350. The outside walls are painted with Scrip-
tural texts; and at the Evans Street frontage a picture is painted 13ft. x 9ft.,.
symbolic of Peter calling upon the Lord, ‘ Save me, or I perish.’ Above this
picture is painted an open Bible, on which are the words, ‘ Thy word is truth,’
and around it are texts of Scripture referring to the Word of God.”


At the opening ceremony a large gathering assembled, when Mrs. G. J.
\\ aterhouse initiated the proceedings by uncovering the Bible on the wall,
afterwards unfurling the Mission Banner. Mrs. Waterhouse said; “In the
name of God I unveil the symbol in the wall of our precious Bible, the Word
of God, the Sword of the Spirit, which I trust will be faithfully wielded within
this building as long as it shall last. In the name of our God we set up our
banners, and I unfurl the Helping Hand Mission flag to float over the building
in which the Bible will be proclaimed and taught as the only standard of faith
and the only sure rule of life. I pray that the Word of God wielded here may
prove a two-edged sword, leading to the salvation of many thousands of immor-
tal souls.” Miss Vickery being presented with a key unlocked the door by
remarking: “Behold, I set before you an open door to the dedication of this
Hall. At half-past three a service in the main Hall was held, when the place
was filled. The Rev. W. G. Taylor commenced the service, the Rev. D. O’Don-
nell preached, Mr. C. Hosking sang, and the Rev. Dr. Lane closed the service
with prayer. A Tea Meeting followed at 6 o’clock, succeeded by a Public Meet-
ing, at which the Hon. E. Vickery, M.L.C., presided, being supported by the
Revs. W. G. Taylor, P. Clipsham, PI. C. Foreman, 8.A., S. A. Harris, Dr.
Brown, W. H. George, and others.
In his opening address, Mr. Vickery expressed his thanks to God for
being permitted to build the Hall and having his life prolonged to see it
opened. He considered it fitting to make one allusion to the circumstances
w inch had let to the erection of the building. It was known to most present
that during the past two years the United Tent Mission had been in progress
throughout New South Wales, and its object had been to attract the atten-
dance of the unsaved and those who were not reached by the ordinary Church
organisations, with a view of proclaiming the Gospel direct to them. In
every instance the service had led 10, 20, or 100 persons to forsake their sinful
course of life. There had been some 200 Mission Tent services, their suc-
cess being greatly dependent on the work done by the Ministers and Officers
of the various denominations. He considered that the Churches had benefited,
and their congregations were augmented. Balmain West was looked upon as
a locality calling for special and prolonged effort. Accordingly, on the 26th
April a large tent was erected in Thornton Street, and the Mission was opened
by the Revs. D. O’Donnell and W. H. Scurr with their staff of Assistants, and
continued for five weeks. Good work was done; but the Missioners were
compelled to go elsewhere to fulfil other engagements. To reach the class
desired, and on the advice of Mr. O’Donnell, the tent was moved to Evans
Street. The work proceeded for nine weeks with encouraging results. It was
found necessary to provide a permanent home for the work, with the hope of
training the converts to a higher life, adding to their members, and by con-
tinuing Evangelical services to add to and strengthen the Churches. The
College Hall was engaged and occupied three nights weekly, and on Sunday
in continuation of the Mission work, pending the completion of the building
they were in. The work that would be carried on by the Mission would
include Evangelical services, meetings for workers and young men, Christian


Endeavour meetings, a Sunday School for children not attending other
Churches, and social meetings. The chairman said he hoped that the Hall
would prove a busy hive for Christian workers engaged in defeating the devil
and all his agencies, especially dancing saloons, drinking shops, gambling dens,
and places of immorality.
The Barrett Brothers continue to carry on the work of the
Helping Hand Mission and will do so till the end of the year IQ°4-
when the entire control, management, and property will be vested in the com-
mittee of the Central Methodist Mission, free from debt. The report of the
first half-year’s work in connection with this Hall is of a most encouraging
nature, its Missionary efforts being worthy of special mention. Already three
native Missionaries are supported by means of weekly penny subscriptions.
THE END.

* This total is much below that of the Government Statistician in the Census returns.
There the number is
132.000 odd.
The
difference is explained in
some measure by the
omission of
the
returns
from Broken Hill, which,
though situated in
New
South
Wales, is joined to the South Australian Conference, owing to its geographical position.
