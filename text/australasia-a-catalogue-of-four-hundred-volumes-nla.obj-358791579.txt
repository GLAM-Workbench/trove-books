(prefatory Qtote.
' WAS desirous of forming a Reference Library on Australasia, and,
II consulting with our esteemed Archivist and Bibliographer, Mr.
E. A. Petherick, C.M.G., he has generously transferred his private
collection of four hundred or more choice books to “ a Governor-General’s
Library,” thus supplementing his already noble gift to the Commonwealth
of nearly twenty thousand books and maps now at Federal Parliament
House.
The smaller collection at Federal Government House is truly repre-
sentative of the Australian States and Polynesia. The books are arranged
in chronological order of their subjects For the Voyages: Magellan,
Mendana, Quiros, Tasman, Dampier, Bougainville, Cook, La Perouse, Bligh
and the eventful story of the “ Bounty,” Baudin, Flinders, King, Darwin,
Stokes, the “ Challenger,” &c., down to Scott, Shackleton, and Mawson.
For the Explorers : Oxley, Sturt, Mitchell, Grey, Eyre, Leichhardt, Burke
and Wills, M'Douall Stuart, and Forrest, with summaries of the heroic
period by Tenison-Woods, Favenc, and Calvert. For New South Wales
there are Phillip, King, Bligh, Macquarie, Brisbane, summarized respectively
in Barton, Bladen, Bennett, Lang, Flanagan, Rusden, and so forth. There
is also an Alphabetical Index comprehending the four hundred and odd
volumes.
The hitherto empty bookshelves at Government House are now, thanks
to Mr. Petherick’s generosity, replete with useful and informative books,
and I and my successors are under a deep obligation to the donor for the
fine library he has placed in Government House, where it will remain for all
time a monument to his erudition and his enlightened public spirit.
RONALD MUNRO FERGUSON.

POETRY AND ANTHOLOGIES.


AMERIGO VESPUCCI IN AUSTRALASIA, 1498.
Discovery of giant trees and a kangaroo, a monstrous beast, with the head
of a fox, the hands of a man, the tail of a monkey, and that wonderful
provision of nature, a bag in which to carry its young.—Voyage of Amerigo
Vespucci. The writer says he intends to write the account of his four
voyages. It is known that he was out of Spain in 1498 and 1499. When
he went to Lisbon and lived there Vespucci was made Pilot-Major of Spain,
an appointment which he held till his death in 1512. The Hunt-Lenox Globe
shown in projection in the Encyclo. Brit., 9th edition, “ Art Globe,” includes
the outline of a continent east of Africa and Madagascar, and south of
India. It is in the J agellon University of Cracow, Poland, with the addition
“America noviter reperta.” I have permission to publish his “Globus
Jagellonicus.”
“He landed and performed the usual ceremonies of taking possession in the names
of the Spanish sovereigns, and in one place carved their names (F. and Y.) on a
magnificent tree, of such enormous magnitude that seventeen men with their hands could
not embrace the trunk.”—Columbus, by Washington Irving (quoting Las Casas).
