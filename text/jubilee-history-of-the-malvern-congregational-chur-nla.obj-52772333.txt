JUBILEE HISTORY
OF THE
MALVERN
CONGREGATIONAL
CHURCH
1883 1933




Malvern Congregational Church
IN compiling a brief history of the Malvern Con-
gregational Church, it is necessary to go back
for about 70 years, somewhere in the sixties.
Records of this far away time are very scanty, but it
has been proved that there was a Union Church in
The Building in Glenferrie Road, between Wattletree Road
and Gordon Grove.
Gardiner (as Malvern was then called) about that
period ; worship was conducted in a wooden building
in Union Street, which was quite recently still in
existence in the garden of Leaton House. This fellow-
ship, which comprised members of different sects,
removed to a new building in Glenferrie Road, be-
tween Wattle Tree Road and Gordon Grove, in
February 1873. The Rev. James Moss was the
Minister of this Church for some years.


About the end of December 1882, overtures were
made to the Executive Committee of the Congre-
gational Union and Mission of Victoria, that the
building known as the Gardiner Union Church should
pass into their hands, and should thenceforth be
known as the Malvern Congregational Church. The
overtures were accepted, and on Sunday, 7th January,
1883, the building was reopened as a Congregational
Church. During january 1883 the Rev. J. H. Mitchell
conducted divine service, and from February onward
the Rev. C. J. \\T Moon supplied the pulpit.
On Thursday, 21st June, 1883, a fellowship was
formed, the officiating ministers being Revs. J. J.
Hallev and T. E. Owens Meil. Twenty-six persons
formed that fellowship, their names being :
Mrs. J. Bishop,
Mrs. Thomas,
Mrs. J. Alway,
Mrs. Purdue,
Miss Purdue,
Mrs. R. Alway,
Mrs. Lay,
Miss Alway,
Miss S. Alway,
Mrs. C. Bishop,
Mrs. Wilson,
Mrs. Frazer,
Mrs. Gillespie,
Mrs. Devenish,
Miss Devenish,
Miss A. Devenish,
Mrs. Heriot,
Mrs. Chandler,
Mrs. Rose,
Mr. J. Hart,
Mr. W. Purdue,
Mr. G. Lay,
Mr. J. Wilson,
Mr. J. Heriot,
Mr. R. Alway,
Mrs. W. Mosley.
Immediately after the formation of the Church,
that is, on the 27th June, 1883, a church meeting was
called for the purpose of electing deacons, and the
following were chosen : —Joseph Hart, Secretary ;
Robert Alway, Treasurer ; William Purdue.
The foregoing particulars are taken from a copy
of a document placed under the memorial stone of
the present building.
This, then, is the beginning of the Malvern Con-
gregational Church 50 years ago, the Jubilee of which
we are now celebrating in 1933.


The Rev. C. J. W. Moon was definitely called to
the pastorate of the Church on 22nd June, 1883,
which was accepted bv him on sth July ; the sum of
fifty pounds was granted by the Congregational
Union towards the stipend. It is worthy of note
that the call was signed by all the members ; a
striking testimony to the bond existing between them.
From that time the attendances steadily increased,
until it became evident with the growth of population
in the district that the building would soon be too
small. A public meeting held on Wednesday, 2nd
September, 1885, had for its principal business the
following recommendation ; —“ That the meeting
take into consideration the advisability or otherwise
of erecting a more commodious church in front of
the present building.”
The Present Building as it Originally Stood before
being Extended in 1889.


Rev. C. J. M. MOON (1883-1888)
Rev. J. W. JONES (1895-1898)
Rev. DAVID O'DONNELL
(1889-1895)
Rev. JESSE TAYLOR (1903-1304)


Eev. A. E. GIFFORD (1904-1907)
Rev. S. H. COX (1919-1922)
Rev. G. A. W. LEGGE (1907-1919)
Rev, ABSALOM DEANS, B.A.
(1923-1932)


Opinion seems to have been divided between
erecting a building in front of the original one or pur-
chasing a new site, and at a meeting a month later, it
was resolved to purchase the site at the corner of
Glenferrie Road and \Tinter Streets, which was done
about the end of 18 85. The price paid was probably
£j per foot, and the work of preparing plans and
specifications was entrusted to Messrs. Billing & Son,
Collins Street, and the contract was let to Mr. J. H.
W. Harrison for £1864, which included the seating.
The memorial stone was laid on 9th October, 1886,
by Mrs. J. A. Devenish.
It is to be regretted that no record can be found of
the opening ceremony of the new building.
Mr. Moon remained in the pastorate till November,
1888, when he accepted a call to the Church at Manly,
N.S.W.
In a letter received from him, dated 28th July,
1927, he states “ That he looks back on his sis years
pastorate of the Malvern Church with peculiar pleasure.
They were days of great joy in Christian fellowship
and service for our worthy Master, Jesus Christ.”
On 14th January, 1889, a call was extended to
the Rev. David O’Donnell, and on 3rd February of
that year he began his ministry which lasted till IS larch
1895’. He was a preacher of strong evangelical
tendencies, and his work is remembered by many
still amongst us.
The new building had never been regarded as
finished, and on 19th May, 1889, it was resolved that
“ the present church building be extended to its full
capacity,” and the ladies agreed to organize a bazaar
to finance the undertaking. The accepted tender
was for £1589, and the foundation stone was kid by
Mrs. W. S. Willis on 7th December, 1889.
The dedicatory services of the enlarged building
were held on Friday, nth April, 1890, when the Rev.
Dr. Bevan delivered the address. Special services


were held on the two Sundays following, in which
Revs. A. Gosman, W. Allen, A. W ebb, D. O’Donnell
and Dr. Fitchett took part. It is interesting to note
that in August 1889 the membership numbered 81.
The financial position was evidently acute during
portion of his ministry, and many meetings were held
to grapple with the overdraft question.
In October 1895 a call was accepted by Rev. J. W.
Jones who was then at Stawell. His ministry lasted
till June 1898, when he resigned. Unfortunately
the minute book of this period is missing and cannot
be found ; this book is the only one not available
in the whole period of 50 years.
Evidently the church was pastorless in 1599-1900.
\We find records of the Rev. Samuel Bryant conducting
church meetings and Sunday services for some months
just prior to his leaving for England, and later the Rev.
James Rickard was invited to act as honorary pastor
of Malvern in conjunction with his work at Brighton.
For some years the financial position was acute, and
the membership had declined considerably, but at
length in April 1901 the Rev. Jesse Taylor was called
and inducted into the pastorate. He had recently
arrived from England and returned there after
resigning the charge at Malvern in February 1904.
In November 1903 suggestions were made respecting
an exchange of properties between this church and the
Presbyterian church at Malvern on terms, but at a
special meeting it was decided to proceed no further
in this direction. The wisdom of this course has
been proved many times since, but it affords striking
evidence of the financial crisis that the church passed
through.
On 24th February, 1904, a special meeting was
held, and the minister at Brighton was again requested
to take the pastoral oversight at Malvern, but this
time in conjunction with the Rev. A. E. Gifford
who had recently left the Methodist church. Mr.
Rickard consented, and Mr. Gifford accepted the


co-pastorate. The induction took place on 29th
March, 1904. The church was now making good
progress, and in September 1904 Mr. Rickard resigned,
and Mr. Gifford undertook sole charge. Malvern
was now being thickly populated and the church
made headway.
The ministry of Rev. A. E. Gifford continued till
July 1907, when he received a call to Adelaide. His
work at Malvern was characterised by great earnestness,
and there are many still with us who affectionately
remember the good work done by him.
The next minister was Rev. G. A. \X. Legge who
began in August 1907 and remained till 1919, when
he accepted the charge of Trinit}' Church, Perth.
During his ministry the church progressed steadily,
and the membership largely increased. A man of a
most kindly and sympathetic nature and an earnest
and thoughtful preacher, he was much loved by the
people, and his memory is cherished by all who knew
him.
In i9ir additions were made to the school building
and it was re-opened for Sunday School work in
January 1912.
In the same year Mr. Legge took a trip to England,
during which time the pulpit was occupied by a large
number of ministers and others who had offered to
assist the church during the absence of the pastor.
On his return he suffered a rather severe illness, and
the preacher was the Rev. G. J. Milliams, of the
London Missionary Society, who has on many
occasions helped the church by taking the sendees.
Two important events during the pastorate of Mr.
Legge were the opening of the church at Gardiner,
which was an offshoot from Malvern, and for a time
was largely helped by the parent church ; and the
installation' of the pipe organ in 1915. This was
opened in February 1916, and was completely paid
for very shortly after that date.


In 1918 Mr. Legge was appointed principal of
the Congregational College, which position he held
till his removal to Perth in 1919.
The next pastor, by a singular coincidence, was
the Rev. Sydney Herbert Cox who had just left Trinity
Church in Perth. He was a brilliant preacher and
lecturer and the congregation increased considerably
during the term of his ministry which lasted till 1922,
when he removed to Sydney and took up the charge
of Bourke Street Church there.
During this period the interior of the church was
renovated and re-decorated as the result of a very
successful fair.
In September 1923 Rev. Absalom Deans, 8.A.,
pastor of Rockdale Church, Sydney, was called to
Malvern and began a ministry there which continued
till March 1932, when he resigned after nearly nine
years of earnest, faithful work in which he was most
ably seconded by Mrs. Deans, who re-organised the
work amongst the women of the church and formed
the present Women’s Guild which has done very
fine service. The period of depression through
which Australia and the world is passing has affected
the Malvern Church in common with most others,
but there is a great work to be done, and already signs
of a better day are evident.
Since the departure of Mr. Deans the pastorate
has been vacant, and the services have been taken by
very excellent supplies, chief among whom was Rev.
Dr. Boreham who preached for three months to
very large congregations. It is hoped by the present
diaconate that before very long the church will again
have a pastor and leader who shall cam 7 on the work
so nobly done by his predecessors, and shall lead it
on to still greater achievements of Christian work
and service in the future.
For the preceding brief resume of the life of the
church the compiler is indebted to the fact that all


the minute books have been found intact, with the
one exception referred to earlier, and also acknow-
ledges the good work done by the Re\. Absalom
Deans in collecting and classifying _information
about former days which has been of very great
assistance.
The Sunday School, which was formed one year
before the church, held its Jubilee in September last
year, and the great success of that series of functions
is fresh in the minds of all who were privileged to take
part in them. As a result the school building was
painted inside and out, and much other necessary
work done.
No account of Malvern Congregational Church
would be complete without a reference to the choir.
This possible attained its zenith during the ministries
of Revs. Legge and Cox, when it was recognised not
only in the denomination, but also outside it, as one
of the best suburban church choirs.
It will be noted in the foregoing outlines that no
mention is specifically made of any persons who have
been foremost in the work of the church, where
there have been so many it would not be possible
to name them all, but the cause has never been without
workers, and the church stands as a_ monument to the
loving and self-sacrificing labor of those who itom
time to time have been associated with it. It has
passed through several critical periods during tre
50 years under review, but has emerged victorious
through the faithful work and prayers of its pastors
and members, and the same thing will be the experience
of the future.
When the time comes, in the providence of God,
for a new pastor to take up the work, let all the members
rally round him and make their church a power
for "good in the city and district.
