I. ?Expeditions of Discovery in South Australia. By Edward
John Eyre, Esq.
Under any circumstances, expeditions which have contributed so
much to extend our knowledge of the southern regions of the
Australian continent, as those performed by Mr. John Eyre, in
the years 1839-40-41, would have called for notice in the
? Journal ?of the Geographical Society. The propriety of giving
an account of them has become a necessity, since one of the gold
medals placed at the Society?s disposal has been awarded to him.
Mr. Eyre?s connexion with the colony of Southern Australia
commenced towards the close of 1837, with an undertaking cha-
racterised by the same spirit of adventurous hardihood that has en-
abled him to accomplish so much as a discoverer with compara-
tively limited resources. The practicability of driving cattle over-
land westward from New South Wales to Adelaide was at that
time considered extremely problematical in Sydney, and few were
willing to be the first to risk their property on such an adventure.
More daring spirits, however, were willing to take the field, and,
amongst others, Mr. Eyre and Messrs. Hawdon and Bonney.
Mr. Eyre was the first to start, although the other two gentlemen,
owing to the delays he encountered on the road, were the first to
reach Adelaide. Mr. Eyre left Sydney with his party on the
Bth of November, 1837. He diverged to the S. of the Murray,
hoping to strike upon a more direct practicable route to Adelaide;
but the country into which he had advanced proving sterile in
the extreme, and devoid of water, he was obliged, when within
200 miles of his destination, to retrace his steps to where he
quitted the river. Owing to this detention he did not reach Ade-
laide till the 13th of July, 1838. During this journey of eight
months, in part through desert tracts, in part along the courses of
rivers, which for Australia are thickly peopled and with warlike
tribes, he, with his small party of six men, conducted in safety a
herd of 300 cattle and three drays. The delay, therefore, to
which his ambition to strike out a new path exposed Mr. Eyre,
enabled him on the other hand to prove his possession of the
VOL. XIII. M


tact and management so indispensable in the leader of an expe-
dition of discovery.
On the sth of December, 1838, Mr. Eyre again left New
South Wales with 1000 sheep and 600 cattle, and arrived safely
in Adelaide on the 23rd of February, 1839. This time he ac-
complished the journey in a much shorter period, having been
less than three months on the road. The vague expressions of
the documents from which we derive our information do not
enable us to determine whether the interval consumed on this
expedition is calculated from the time of his leaving Sydney,
or from the time of his leaving the settled districts of the
colony of New South Wales. Be that as it may, to Mr. Eyre
belongs the honour?without any derogation from the high merits
of Messrs. Hawdon and Bonney?of having been the first to under-
take, and one of the most persevering in thoroughly opening, the
road for the thousands of sheep and cattle which have since been
driven overland from Sydney to South Australia, so much to the
benefit of the latter colony.
Before quitting this preliminary matter to dwell upon our
proper theme?Mr. Eyre?s exploits as a discoverer ?it may not
be altogether irrelevant to notice his successful efforts to extend
still further that branch of commerce which he had been mainly
instrumental in establishing. On the 30th of January he left
Adelaide to open a communication between that settlement and
Western Australia by water, for the exportation of sheep. Upon
landing his flock at King George?s Sound, he undertook a further
overland journey with them to Swan River, a distance of 320 miles.
Since that time the trade in stock between the colonies of South
and Western Australia has continued steadily to increase.
These incidents in the life of Mr. Eyre do not seem to us out of
place here. They illustrate the character of the man ?explain in
some measure how he has been able to accomplish what he has
already achieved?and lead us to hope that the material interests
of his adopted country, and geographical science, will be yet
further benefited by the exertions of so resolute and enterprising
a spirit.
During the course of the year 1839, Mr. Eyre engaged in two
expeditions of discovery. On the Ist of May he left Adelaide to
explore the regions to the north of that settlement. He was
absent nine weeks; and, during that time, he travelled about 220
miles, examining the country between Spencer?s Gulf and the
Murray River to about 36 miles north of Mount Arden. His
party had with them ten horses and two drays, and the expedition
was fitted out and supported exclusively at his expense.
Mr. Eyre returned to Adelaide on the 29th June, and on the
Bth July he started for Port Lincoln. He was absent nine weeks.


This time was occupied by an examination of the line of coast
from Port Lincoln to Port Bell?an extent of about 230 miles.
From Streaky Bay he crossed to the head of Spencer?s Gulf,
about 220 miles. He returned to .Adelaide on the 15th of Octo-
ber. On this occasion, too, the expenses of the expedition (which
was accompanied by ten horses and two drays) were defrayed
entirely by Mr. Eyre.
The operations of 1840-41 may be regarded as one con-
tinuous expedition. It was commenced under the auspices of the
local government, which contributed a donation of 100/., sundry
stores, and the loan of two horses. The colonists of South Aus-
tralia contributed five horses, and the payment of part of the ex-
penses. Seven horses, and the very considerable excess of ex-
penditure over the advances mentioned, were supplied from Mr.
Eyre?s private funds. All charts and plans of his routes were
delivered up by Mr. Eyre to the Colonial government.
Mr, Eyre left Adelaide on the 18th of June, 1840, to attempt
to penetrate into the interior of Australia. He advanced to Lake
Torrens, and traced its shores for nearly 400 miles ; but finding
himself, from the anomalous conformation of that huge horseshoe
quicksand, entangled in a cul-de-sac, and finding the country more-
over arid and sterile, he crossed to Port Lincoln. He was thus
the first to open a direct line of road to that harbour from the
head of Spencer?s Gulf, a distance of about 220 miles. From
Port Lincoln, he, after being repeatedly baffled, but never dis-
couraged, succeeded in tracing the whole line of coast westerly as
far as King George?s Sound, a distance of 1300 miles.
Mr. Eyre?s tracks, on the various expeditions now recapitulated,
will be found laid down from the original tracings on Mr. Arrow-
smith?s last and excellent map of Australia, As a means of
adding something more of interest and detail to this meagre out-
line, it has been judged advisable to subjoin Mr. Eyre?s own
accounts of his excursions, as given in his reports to government.
I. Operations of the Year 1839.
1. Excursion from Adelaide to the Murray and eastward as far as
Spencer?s Gulf ?? On the Ist of May I left Adelaide with a party of
five individuals, exclusive of myself, and two horse teams with supplies
calculated to last us nearly three months. For the first few days after
leaving Adelaide, we passed through a considerable extent of fine and
well watered country, crossing the chains of ponds named by Mr. Hill
the Wakefield and the Hutt, to the latitude of about 33� 40', when the
country assumed a more open character, presenting to us a considerable
extent of high open downs well adapted for sheep, and abundantly watered
by chains of ponds to the eastward and N.E. of the Hutt. The latter
chain of ponds we traced in a northerly direction to its junction with a
large water-course, which I named the ? Broughton,? near the parallel of
M 2


38� 30'. Here I found very extensive reaches of water connected by a
strongly running stream; in this vicinity, too, the Broughton received
several chains of ponds from the N. and N.E., and then, taking a course
considerably S. of W., it wound through some very broken hills of an
open barren nature, after which the stream was lost in the sandy nature
of its channel, and we only found water-holes at intervals; proceeding
still further, we found its channel quite dry, but very wide and deep, and
its course became changed to a north-westerly direction towards Spen-
cer?s Gulf, near which I left it, as the surrounding country was of a poor
barren appearance. We then passed a tract of high open country, prin-
cipally covered with prickly grass, and at intervals with small patches
of scrub, crossing two running streams emanating from the hills to the
northward, but which both became dry in their channels a little west of
where we crossed them. After leaving the latter of these in about 33�
18', we passed under the base of some bare hills rising abruptly from the
level of the land around, and forming the commencement of the range
running to the head of Spencer?s Gulf, and in which Mount Brown and
Mount Arden are situated. Under these hills we continued our course
on the west side, and found that as we advanced to the northward they
increased in elevation, at first taking a course somewhat west of north,
and afterwards inclining a little to the eastward of that point. For some
distance we found numerous creeks taking their rise among the hills, dry
generally in the flat country, but with springs and small water holes
among the hills; these all fall westerly towards the Gulf, through a
country more or less open, and divided by belts of scrub and pine brush,
similar to what we met with near the Murray. As we advanced further
to the northward the country gradually became more barren, and the
intervals between the water much greater and more difficult of access,
until we reached the head of Spencer?s Gulf, about 16 miles beyond
which I encamped ray party for seven days, whilst I examined the nature
of the surrounding country, as each day?s stage had made the appearance
of the country less promising, and as our supply of water and grass had
become so precarious that I did not consider it prudent to hazard the
safety of my party by pushing further until I had ascertained the cer-
tainty of our being able to procure a supply of both.
? On the 18th of May I halted the party in latitude 32� 6' at a small
creek, where we were enabled to water our horses about two miles up
among the hills. From this point we made a careful and laborious
examination of the adjacent country, and the result was our finding it
impracticable to push any further inland to the N., or round the Gulf to
the S.W., in so dry a season as the present. The range of hills we had
followed under so long still continued, but as they stretched to the north-
ward they had increased in elevation and in barrenness of appearance,
and we rarely found even the dry channel of a water-course emanating
from them. The last of these creeks that I found to the northward was
about 26 miles from our dep<st, and though dry in the plains, had large
reaches of very salt water in it among the hills, and in the ledges of rock
where the water had evaporated we found a great abundance of pure
white salt. We were, however, enabled to obtain a few quarts of tole-
rable water from a small hole dug by the natives in the gravel. Beyond


this creek we travelled about 12 miles further N. to a high dark looking
range, standing by itself, and running in a direction nearly at right angles
o the mam tier, and as its elevation was considerable, I ascended in hones
ot viewing a more cheering prospect. The range was of granite, and from
its summit I could see to an immense distance. To the north the ranges
rose in lofty broken outline, tier behind tier, of very barren rocky appear-
ance, as far as the eye could reach; to the eastward our view was inter-
rupted by the hills we were travelling under; to the west of these hills
the country had gradually changed to a complete sandy desert, inter-
spersed with scrub; further W. and S.W. was seen a low range, flat at
the top, and gradually declining to the level of and merging into the
sandy country before us; whilst to the N.W, and extending to the N
as far as the eye could reach, was to be seen a very broad glittering stripe
of what seemed to be water, but which I am inclined to think was not
water, but only the dry and glazed bed of where water had lodged?and
of very great extent. Nowhere could we see the least sign of grass or
water; the hills before me were high, barren and rocky, and there were
po gum trees or other indications of water emanating from them to be
seen any where?the whole was barren and arid-looking in the extreme,
and as I gazed on the dismal scene before me I felt assured I had
approached the vast and dreary desert of the interior, or, it might be, was
verging on the confines of some inland water, whose sterile and desolate
shores seem to forbid the traveller?s approach. Anxious as I was to ascer-
tain the nature of the country before me, I was at one glance convinced
that m so unfavourable a season I could not hope to penetrate further
We were already 36 miles from our depdt without finding a place where
the horses could water ?we had not seen a blade of grass?and the
extensive and distant view before us forbade us to hope for either to the
we were therefore reluctantly compelled to retrace our steps
to the depot, which we had some difficulty in reaching with our horses
as they were greatly reduced for want of food. Foiled as I was in the
hrst and most important object I had in view, I am still of opinion that
the lofty masses of ranges I saw so far away to the northward may, in a
more favourable season, afford the means, and I think I may venture to
say, the only means, of penetrating far into the interior.
On rejoining my party at the depot, I found my overseer just returning
from the S W., in which direction I had sent him, to a high and distant
range I had seen from the heights behind the depdt. He reported that
e ad been out 50 miles to the S.W., to a high, barren, rocky range
from the summit of which he could see another high range, similar in
appearance to the one he was upon; and the intervening country, like
that he had traversed, was open, level and barren, with the bed of a dried
up lake about 10 miles beyond the range he was upon, but neither water-
course nor tree of any kind was to be seen, and during his whole journey
he had not seen a blade of grass anywhere, or a drop of water; and the
miserable condition of the horse he had brought back fully proved the
wretched state of the country he had been examining.
? As our riding horses were nearly all knocked up, and the nature of
the country so dry and barren, I saw no hopes of succeeding in the second
object I had in view, that of opening a line of road to Port Lincoln.


Before, however, I commenced our return, I VouXThtd
country more immediately on the west side of the Gulf, .
little hopes, from its appearance, of obtaining water in that direction
accordingly I proceeded on foot, accompanied by my overseer, about 3
S fromthedepfit round the head of the Gulf. We found the land
high and flat-topped, gradually declining to the south, and broken by deep
gorges into portions resembling hills. The soil was soft sandy red loam,
greatly mixed with stones, with here and there a little ol( lt hered grass
We could see no timber of any kind but patches of scrubby bu.hes and
a few small pines, but not the least indication of water, and as the country
before bore the same character as that we had traversed, we were
under the necessity of returning, and giving up the attempt as impracti-
cable at so unfavourable a season as the present In 011 at^ur
we had seen very few natives, and those were timid and alarmed at our
presence; but to judge from the-many and well-beaten tracks Jeadmg p
the hills to the water, and the numerous fires we saw among the hi
night, I should imagine there were a considerable number
bourhood. We found a singular practice prevail among them here o
covering up the springs and water-holes (where there was more than one
hole) very thickly with the boughs and branches of trees, as if to project
it from the rays of the sun?a circumstance I had never observed else
where, and which would lead me to suppose that they suffer -ixam . the
scarcity of water in the dry seasons. On the western side of the Gulf we
could never see the tracks or fires of the natives in any direction, though
we were travelling for a great distance so near the eastern side as to have
distinguished fires across the water on the other side had there been any
? After returning on my outward track as far as 33 18 , Istruck
more to the eastward, making for the north-west angle of the Murray
river as the nature of the country and supply of water enabled me to pro-
ceed In my progress I was obliged to go further S. than I intended,
and passed through a considerable extent of very fine country, and tole-
well watered, to the hills separating the country to the westward
from the course of the Murray. From these hills I found a passage to
the river, shorter and better as a route to Adelaide than the one in
present use, and communicating at once with the unlocated country to
the N and N.W. I struck the river in 34 16, and followed it down
to its entrance into the lake. In my progress I examined the alluvial
flats in the valley, and have much pleasure in adding my humble testi-
mony to the opinion long ago expressed by Capt. Sturt, of the great
extent and rich character of the land they contain, and though nearly all
are more or less covered with reeds and are partially subject to inunda-
tion, I consider this portion of land to be as rich and valuable as any I
have seen, and I have only felt surprise that so few have thought it worth
their while to examine the land bordering on such a noble river Alter
leaving the lake, I found a good pass through the ranges about 15 miles
to the southward of Adelaide, and returned to town on the morning of the
Excursion from Port Lincoln to Streaky Bay, and thence to the
head of Spencer's Gtdf.-~? I left Port Lincoln with my party (consisting
of three men, an overseer, and two native boys), on the sth of August,


passing over a low barren country, through which were interspersed
many salt lakes, to the coast, which I struck in latitude 34� I', and
following then its general direction, I crossed a succession of low hills
wooded with casuarinse?grassy, but very stony, and destitute of water,
except what was left by tbe late rains in swamps that we met with occa-
sionally behind the sand hummocks of the coast. These stony hills?
which are of limestone formation?extend but a few miles inland, and
are backed by a perfectly level and scrubby country to the eastward. I
found this character of laud continue With little variation to about latitude
33�, when we left the stony hills, entering a lower and more sandy
region, in which the scrub, consisting of the eucalyptus dumosa and
tea tree, approached much nearer the sea, gradually supplanting the
casuarinae, until in 33� 40' the latter disappeared altogether, and the whole
country, to the water?s edge, became one mass of dense and almost impe-
netrable scrub. During our progress through the low country we had
hitherto at intervals met with high bluffs of granite rising to a consider-
able height, and frequently visible at a very great distance, from the level
nature of the surrounding land; these had now ceased, and in no direc-
tion could we obtain a view of higher or more promising ground.
?On the 25th August, I arrived with my party at Streaky Bay, and
having ascertained, by reconnoitring the country a-head, the impractica-
bility of taking our drays any farther to the westward without first
cutting a road through the scrub ?a work of great labour and time?l
determined to form a depot at a spring we were fortunate enough to find
about two miles S.E. of the most southerly bight of Streaky Bay, and,
leaving my party here, to proceed myself on horseback and examine the
country along the coast as far as I might find practicable. Being most
anxious to have continued this examination to the head of the Great Bight,
in longitude 131� E., I went fully prepared for remaining out the neces-
sary length of time, taking wfith me one of my native boys, and a pack-
horse to carry our provisions. I found the country along the coast still
continue of the same character?low, barren, sandy, densely covered with
scrub, and destitute of water. So close, indeed, and so strong was the
nature of the scrub, that we had much difficulty in forcing our way
through it, even on horseback. This dreary region extended round
Streaky Bay, Smoky Bay, Denial Bay, and as far as the 133 rd parallel
of longitude, a little beyond Point Bell, this being the most westerly point
I could reach, as the scarcity of grass and the absence of all water com-
pelled me to return in spite of my most anxious desire to have continued
our route two degrees farther west. During the whole of our course from
the lower extremity of Streaky Bay to Point Bell, we had only found
water once, a little to the N.E. of Point Brown, and here it was so
difficult of access, and in so small a quantity, that we could not obtain a
sufficiency for our horses. This, added to the very fatiguing nature of the
country, had so exhausted the horses that it was not without difficulty we
succeeded in taking them back safely to the depdt. They had been four
whole days without a drop of water, and the greater part of that time
without food also, during which period we had ridden, at the least, 140
miles over a very heavy country. At the time of our return, the scrub


still continued very dense near the sea ; and the only improvement I had
observed in the character of the country was, that the land a few miles
back from the coast was gradually becoming more elevated, and the
intervals of plains or small openings among the scrub were getting some-
what larger and more numerous than we had met with before; but no
heights were visible, nor were there the least indications of a probability
of water being found more to the westward. Having observed from a
height to the southward of our depdt a high and very distant peak to the
eastward, I had sent my overseer out in that direction to reconnoitre
the country during my absence to the westward. On his return he
reported that he found water at intervals, but only in small quantities, left
by the rains in clefts of rocks, and even this, he stated, was rapidly drying
up. This information, added to the unfavourable state of the wind for
some days past, and the fact of our supplies being reduced to rather a low
ebb, decided me at once to move on the party and push across as rapidly
as possible.
? On the afternoon of the Bth September we evacuated our depdt, and
steered easterly, through a barren and scrubby country, very low and
level, with occasional heights of granite, in the clefts of which we usually
found a little water deposited by the rains. At about longitude 135�
25' E., we came to a singular mass of lofty ranges extending far to the
northward and to the eastward. These ranges were devoid of timber, of
a barren appearance, and consisted of granite and porphyritic granite,
but principally the latter. There were neither creeks nor springs
emanating from them, and the land around, to their very base, was low,
barren, and scrubby, the hills themselves being nearly overrun with the
prickly grass. I took the liberty of distinguishing this very remarkable
range with the name of his Excellency the Governor, as it constitutes the
principal feature in this part of the country, and exhibits a succession of
lofty rugged ranges, one behind the other, stretching through a vast
extent of country, and thus forming a striking and singular contrast to
the low and level waste around.
? In this vicinity, and among the hills, we met with several small salt
water lakes, with salsolaceous plants growing around their margins; but
we were entirely dependent on the deposit of water left by the rains
among the rocks for our supply of fresh water. The supply was thus
very precarious, being only procurable in small quantities at a time, and
frequently at very considerable intervals apart?and even this was
evidently rapidly disappearing before the rays of a very hot sun, so that I
feel assured had we delayed even a few days longer,at Streaky Bay, we
never could have succeeded in forcing a passage across. On the 29th
September we formed a depot, being anxious, before leaving this vici-
nity, to see a little more of the interior to the northward. I detained my
party in camp for a week, and proceeded on horseback about ninety
miles beyond the depot. In the course of this ride I ascended two or
three heights in the ranges under which I was travelling, and from one of
them it was evident that a lake of considerable size extended to the N.
and N.W.: but as my time was very limited, and the lake at a consider-
able distance, I was obliged to forego my wish to visit it. I have, how-


ever, no doubt of its being salt, from the nature of the country, and the
fact of finding the water very salt in one of the creeks draining into it
from the hills. Beyond this lake to the westward was a low flat-topped
range, extending north-westerly as far as I could see. The intervening
country between Flinders Range and the Lake (which I distinguished
with the name of Colonel Torrens), and extending as far as the eye could
reach to the northward, consisted of extensive plains of firm red sandy
soil destitute of vegetation, and divided by ridges of sand wooded with
shrubs and stunted bushes. Through these plains ran many large creeks
whose courses were marked by lines of lofty gum trees. These emanated
from Flinders Range, and, though dry in their channels below the hills,
water might generally be procured by following them up among the
ranges. They all fall in a westerly direction, or a little north of west, and
drain into Lake Torrens, Flinders Range still continued at the time
of my return, and another small detached hill was also visible to
the N.W.
? During my absence to the north, I sent out my overseer to examine
the country to the eastward. He reported that Flinders Range, or
rather a succession of ranges, continued for about eight miles : that he
then crossed a large barren plain through which a creek was running to
the northward, and which was probably one of those I had crossed after
it had wound through the hills. Beyond this, he found the country con-
sist of alternate ridges and flats of a bare and barren character, with a
good deal of the prickly grass, until, at about 60 miles east of the depot,
he obtained a view of the low flat sea of scrub similar to that near the
Murray river, and which probably is a continuation of that scrub extend-
ing to the northward. From this point he returned to the depot. After
leaving the camp near Mount Arden, I returned to Adelaide, passing
through a great extent of fine.and valuable country, well watered by
numerous running streams, nearly all of which retain water even in the
driest seasons.
?In reviewing the result of our labours, I cannot but regret they have
not been more productive of interest and utility to the colonists. We have
barely succeeded in effecting the object of the expedition by passing
through a certain extent of country ; and for this unsatisfactory result we
are indebted solely, under Providence, to the very favourable season we
experienced (and which appears to have extended generally over the
colony). During the whole of our course from Port Lincoln along the
coast to Point Bell, and across the interior to the head of Spencer?s Gulf,
a distance of 600 miles through, I believe, an hitherto unexplored
country, we never crossed a single creek, river, or chain of ponds, nor
did we meet with any permanent water anywhere, with the exception of
three solitary springs on the coast, to which the few natives we met with
appear to resort when the water left by the rains further inland is
dried up.
? The variation of the compass I found to diminish as I advanced to
the westward, and again increased as I advanced easterly towards Spen-
cer?s Gulf. At Streaky Bay it was only about 2� E., whilst at the head
of Spencer?s Gulf it was about 7� E.?


11. Operations of 1840-41.
1. Excursions in the Vicinity of Lake Torrens. ?Mr. Eyre left
Adelaide on the 18th June, 1840, and arrived at Mount Arden, at the
head of Spencer?s Gulf, on the 3rd of July. From his depot there he
writes:??
? On the 6th I proceeded, accompanied by one of my native boys, on
horseback, to reconnoitre Lake Torrens and the country to the north of
the depot, leaving the party in camp. I arrived on the shores of Lake
Torrens the third day after leaving the depot, and have ascertained that
it is a basin of considerable magnitude, extending certainly over a space
varying in width from fifteen to twenty miles, with a length of from
forty to fifty from its southern extremity to the most northerly part of it,
visible from a high summit in Flinders Range (about ninety miles N.
of Mount Arden). The lake is girded with an outer ridge of sand,
covered with salsolaceous plants, and with saline crusts appearing above
the ground at intervals. Its waters extend over a considerable surface,
but they are, apparently, shallow. I could not approach the water from
the soft nature of that part of its bed which is uncovered, and which
reached from three to four miles from the outer bank to the water?s edge.
There can be no doubt, however, of its being very salt, as the portion of
its bed which lay exposed to our view was thickly coated with pungent
particles of salt. There were not any trees or shrubs of any kind near
the lake where we made it, nor could either grass or fresh water be pro-
cured for our horses. Lake Torrens is bounded on its western side by
high land?apparently a continuation of the table-land to the westward
of the head of Spencer?s Gulf. I should think that it must receive a
considerable drainage from that quarter as well as the whole of the
waters falling from Flinders Range to the eastward.
? From the very inhospitable nature of the country around the lake,
I could not examine it so carefully or so extensively as I could have
wished. My time, too, being very limited, made me hurry away to the
northward, to search for a place to which I might bring on my party, as
the grass in the neighbourhood of the depot is very old, and much" less
abundant than in either of ray former visits there. It became, therefore,
imperative on me to remove the horses as speedily as possible. Should
circumstances permit, I shall, however, endeavour to visit Lake Torrens
again, on my return from the northern interior. After leaving the lake
I spent many days in examining the country to the northward of our
depot. Its character seemed to vary but little ; barren sandy plains
still formed the lower level, and the hills constituting the continuation
of Flinders Range were still composed of quartz and ironstone. They
are, however, gradually becoming less elevated and more detached, with
intervals of stony valleys between, and the whole country was, if pos-
sible, assuming a more barren aspect, while the springs, which had
heretofore been numerous among the hills, were very few in number,
difficult to find, and very far in amongst the hills. After a most anxious
and laborious search, I at last succeeded in finding a place about ninety
miles (of latitude) N. of Mount Arden, to which I can remove my depdt,


and from which I can again penetrate more to the northward. After
an absence of sixteen days I rejoined my party under Mount Arden on
the evening of the 21st July.
? The high land seen on the opposite side of Lake Torrens appears
to be a continuation of the table-land lying to the W. of the head of
Spencer?s Gulf; and though the fall of the country appears to be
to the N., I begin to be of opinion now that it is not in reality. Lake
Torrens is evidently the basin into which all the waters from 1 linders
Range fall, and its extent is very considerable; in fact, where I last saw
it to the N. it was impossible to say whether it terminated or not, trom
the very great distance it was off. The country lying between Flinders
Range on the one side, and the table-land on the other, and the north ot
Spencer?s Gulf, is of so low and so level a character that the eye alone
is not a sufficient guide as to the direction in which the fall may be.
On my previous visits I felt convinced it was northerly, but 1 am now
inclined to think the drainage from Lake Torrens, in seasons of wet, is
to the S., into the head of the gulf; and I can only account for there
not being a larger connecting watercourse than the small shallow one
found when crossing from Streaky Bay?and which I did not then
imagine extended far above the head of the gulf?by supposing that the
seasons have so altered of late years that the overflow of the Jake has
never been sufficient to cause a run of water to the gulf. Should my
present supposition be correct, the idea of a northerly drainage is done
away with, and we have yet to come to a ? division of the waters.
My uncertainty on this most important point has made me most
anxious to get my party removed to a place where they can remain
until I can decide so important a point, and one on which our future
prospects so much depend. The same causes that prevented my staying
a little longer in the neighbourhood of the lake have also prevented, as
yet, my extending my researches to the N. for more than about forty
miles further than I had been when last in this neighbourhood. Ihe
only change I observed was the increasing barren appearance of the
country ?the decrease in elevation of the ranges their becoming more
detached, with sterile valleys between?and the general absence of
springs. The rock of the higher ridges, which were very rugged and
abrupt, was still the same, quartz and ironstone, but much more of the
latter than I had before seen, and in some cases, with a very great pro-
portion of metal to the stone. The lower ridges and steep banks, when
washed away by the rains, presented great quantities of very pungent
salt to the eye of the observer, mixed with the clay and sand of which
the banks were formed; and in this neighbourhood the creeks were
(though dry) all lined with the salt water tea-tree?a shrub we had
never before seen under Flinders Range.?
A subsequent despatch from Mr. Eyre, dated the 9th October,
gives an account of their further proceedings up to the date of the
Upon leaving our depot near Mount Arden, the low, arid, and
sandy nature of the country between the hills and Lake Torrens com-
pelled us to follow close under the continuation of Flinders Range.
Here our progress was necessarily very slow from the rugged nature ot


the country, the scarcity of water, and the great difficulty both in find-
ing and obtaining access to it. As we advanced, the hills inclined con-
siderably to the eastward, gradually becoming less elevated, until in lati-
tude 29 20 S. they ceased altogether, and we found ourselves in a very
low and level country, consisting of large stony plains, varied occasion-
ally by sand; and the whole having evidently been subject to recent
and extensive inundation. These plains are destitute of water grass
and timber, and have only a few salsolaceous plants growing upon them ?
whilst their surface, whether stony or sandy, is quite smooth and even!
as it washed so by the action of the water. Throughout this level tract
of country were interspersed, in various directions, many small flat-
topped elevations, varying in height from fifty to three hundred feet, and
almost invariably exhibiting precipitous banks. These elevations are
composed almost wholly of a chalky substance, coated over on the upper
surface by stones or a sandy soil, and present the appearance of having
ormed a table-land that has been washed to pieces by the violent action
of water?and of which these fragments now only remain. Upon forcing
a way through this dreary region, in three different directions, I found
that the whole of the low country round the termination of Flinders
Range was completely surrounded by Lake Torrens, which, commencing
not far from the head of Spencer?s Gulf, takes a circuitous course of
tully four hundred miles, with an apparent breadth of from twenty to
thirty miles?foflowing the sweep of Flinders Range, and almost encir-
cling it in the form of a horseshoe.
? Ihe greater part of the vast area contained in the bed of this im-
mense lake is certainly dry on the surface, and consists of a mixture of
sand and mud, of so soft and yielding a character as to render perfectly
ineffective all attempts either to cross it or to reach the edge of the water
which appears to exist at a distance of some miles from the outer margin ?
On one occasion only was I able to taste of its waters, in a small arm of
the lake, near the most north-westerly part of it which I visited, and here
the water was as salt as the sea. The lake, on its eastern and southern
sides, is bounded by a high sandy ridge, with salsolae and some brush-
wood growing upon it, but without any other vegetation. The other
shores presented, as far as I could judge, a very similar appearance; and
when I ascended Flinders Range, from which the views were very ex-
tensive, and the opposite shores of the lake distinctly visible?no rise or
hill of any kind could ever be perceived, either to the W., the N., or
the E.; the whole region round appeared to be one vast, low, and
dreary waste. One very prominent summit in this range I have named
Mount Ssele; it is situated in 30� 30' S. latitude, and about 138� 40' E,
longitude, and is the first point from which I obtained a view of Lake
Torrens, to the eastward of Flinders Range, and discovered that I was
hemmed in on every side by a barrier it was impossible to pass. I had
now no alternative left me, but to conduct my party back to Mount
Arden, and then decide what steps I should adopt to carry out the ob-
jects of the expedition. It was evident that to avoid Lake Torrens and
the low desert by which it is surrounded, I must go very far either to
the E. or to the W. before again attempting to penetrate to the interior.
? P art y had already been upwards of three months absent from


Adelaide, and our provisions were too much reduced to admit of our
renewing the expedition in either direction, without first obtaining addi-
tional supplies. The two following were, therefore, the only plans which
appeared feasible to me, or likely to promote the intentions of the colo-
nists, and effect the examination of the northern interior :
First to move my party to the southward, to endeavour to pro-
cure supplies from the nearest stations N. of Adelaide, and then by
crossing to the Darling, to trace that river up until I found high land
leading to the N.W.
? Secondly?To cross over to Streaky Bay, send from thence to Port
Lincoln for supplies, and then follow the line of coast to the westward
until I met with a tract of country practicable to the N, To the first
of these plans were many objections: amongst the principal ones were
the very unfavourable accounts given both by Captain Sturt and Major
Mitchell of the country to the W. of the Darling river?the fact of Cap-
tain Sturt?s having found the waters of that river salt during a continued
ride of many days the numerous tribes of natives likely to be met with
and the very small party I should have with me?lastly, the course of
the river itself, which, trending so much to the eastward, would take us
from, rather than towards, the centre of this continent. On the other
hand, by crossing to the westward, I should have to encounter a country
which I knew to be all but destitute of water, and to consist, for a very
great distance, of barren sandy ridges and low lands, covered by an almost
impenetrable scrub, at a season, too, when but little rain could be ex-
pected, and the heat would, in all probability, be intense; still, of the
two, the latter appeared to me the least objectionable, as we should at
least be going towards the point we wished to reach, and through a
country as yet quite unknown.
? After mature and anxious consideration, therefore, I decided upon
adopting it, hoping that ray decision may meet with the approbation of
the committee.
Previous to our arrival at Mount Arden, we experienced very showery
weather for some days (otherwise we could not have attempted a passage
to the westward), and as there were no longer any apprehensions of
water being found on the route to Streaky Bay, I sent two of my teams
across upon our old tracks, in charge of my overseer; whilst I conducted
the third myself, in company with Mr. Scott, direct to Port Lincoln, to
procure the supplies we required. In crossing from Mount Arden
towards Port Lincoln, we travelled generally through a low country
densely covered with brush, among which were scattered, at considerable
intervals, a few small patches of grass, with here and there some rocky
elevations; in the latter, we were usually able to procure water for our-
selves and horses, until we arrived at the districts already explored in
traversing which we passed (to the N.E. of Port Lincoln) some rich,
well-watered valleys, bounded by a considerable extent of grassy hills
well adapted for sheep or cattle, arriving at Port Lincoln on the 23rd
October. Asa line of route from Adelaide for the immigration of stock,
the course followed, though it cannot be called a good one, is perfectly
practicable in the winter season; and I have no doubt, when the country
becomes better known, the present track might be considerably improved
upon, and both grass and water obtained in the greatest abundance.?


2. Overland Expedition to King George?s Sound.
Mr. Eyre has narrated the progress of this enterprise in the
three despatches here subjoined;?
Mr. Eyre to the Chairman of the Committee for Promoting the
Expedition.
? Sir ? I have the honour to acquaint you, for the information of his
Excellency the Governor and the colonists interested, with the unsuccess-
ful termination of the expedition placed under my command, for the
purpose of exploring the northern interior. Since my last report to his
Excellency the Governor, containing an account of two most disastrous
attempts to head the Great Australian Bight, I have, accompanied by
one of my native boys, made a third and more successful one. On this
occasion, I with some difficulty advanced about fifty miles beyond the
head of the Great Bight, along the line of high cliffs described by
Flinders, and which have hitherto been supposed to be composed prin-
cipally of chalk. 1 found the country between the head of Fowler?s Bay
and the head of the Great Bight to consist of a succession of sandy ridges,
all of which were more or less covered with a low scrub, and without
either grass or water for the last sixty miles. This tract is of so uneven
and heavy a nature that it would be quite impossible for me to take a
loaded dray across it at this very unfavourable season of the year, and
with horses so spiritless and jaded as ours have become, from the in-
cessant and laborious work they have gone through during the last seven
months. Upon rounding the head of the Bight, I met with a few friendly
natives, who showed me where both grass and water were to be procured,
at the same time assuring me that there was no more along the coast for
ten of their days? journeys (probably one hundred miles), or where the
first break takes place in the long and continuous line of cliffs which
extend so far to the westward of the head of the Great Bight.
? Upon reaching these cliffs I felt much disappointed, as I had long
looked forward to some considerable and important change in the cha-
racter of the country. There was, however, nothing very remarkable in
their appearance, nor did the features of the country around undergo
any material change. The cliffs themselves struck me as merely ex-
hibiting the precipitous banks of an almost level country of moderate
elevation (three or four hundred feet), which the violent lash of the
whole of the Southern Ocean was always acting upon and undermining.
Their rock formation consisted of various strata, the upper crust or sur-
face being an oolitic limestone; below this is an indented concrete mix-
ture of sand, soil, small pebbles, and shells; beneath this appear im-
mense masses of a coarse greyish limestone, of which by far the greater
portion of the cliffs are composed 5 and immediately below these again is
a narrow stripe of a whitish, or rather of a cream-coloured substance,
lying in horizontal strata, but which the impracticable nature of the
cliffs did not permit me to examine. After riding for 45 miles along
their summits, I was in no instance able to descend; their brinks were
perfectly steep and overhanging, and in many places enormous masses
appeared severed by deep cracks from the main land, and requiring but
a slight touch to plunge them into the abyss below. As far as I have


been along these cliffs I have seen nothing in their appearance to lead
me to suppose that any portion of them is composed of chalk. Imme-
diately along their summits, and for a few hundred yards back, very
numerous pieces of pure flint are lying loosely scattered upon the surface
of the limestone. How they obtained so elevated a position, or whence
they are from, may admit, perhaps, of some speculation. Back from
the sea, and as far as the eye could reach, the country was level and
generally open, with some low prickly bushes and salsolaceous plants
growing upon it; here and there patches of the gum scrub showed them-
selves, among which a few small grassy openings were interspersed.
The whole of this tract was thickly covered by small land shells, about
the size of snail shells ?and some of them somewhat resembling those in
shape. There were no sudden depressions or abrupt elevations any-
where ; neither hills, trees, nor water, were to be observed; nor was there
the least indication of improvement or change in the general character of
this desolate and forbidding region. The natives we met with at the head
of the Bight were very friendly, and readily afforded us every infor-
mation we required ?as far as we could make them comprehend our
wishes.
?We most distinctly understood from them that there was no water
along the coast, westerly, for ten days? journeys; and that, inland, there
was neither fresh nor salt water, hills or limber, as far as they had ever
been; an account which but too well agreed with the opinion I had
myself formed, upon ascertaining that the same dreary, barren region
I had been traversing so long still continued at a point where I had ever
looked forward to some great and important change taking place in the
features of the country, and from which I had hoped I might eventually
have accomplished the object for which the expedition was fitted out.
Such, however, was not the case; there was not any improvement in the
appearance of the country, or the least indication that there might be a
change for the better, within any practicable distance. I had already
examined the tract of country from the longitude of Adelaide to the
parallel of almost 130� E. longitude?an extent comprising nearly
degrees of longitude?without my having found a single point from
which it was possible to penetrate far into the interior; and I now found
myself in circumstances of so embarrassing and hopeless a character,
that I have most reluctantly been compelled to give up all further idea
of contending with obstacles -which there is no reasonable hope of ever
overcoming. I have now, therefore, with much regret, completely
broken up my small but devoted party. Two of my men returned to
Adelaide, in the Waterwitch, five weeks ago.
? Mr. Scott and another of my men proceed on Monday in the Hero ;
whilst myself, my native boys, and the overseer (who has chosen to
accompany me) proceed hence overland to King George?s Sound, as
soon as our horses are a little recruited by the abundant supply of forage
we received by the Hero.
? Edward John Eyre.
? Fowler?s Bay, 30th Jan., 1841.?


Mr. Eyre to the Colonial Secretary of South Australia.
? Having left Fowler?s Bay on the 26th February, 1841, I arrived at
the head of the Great Australian Bight, on the 3rd March. Here we
halted four days to rest our horses, as they had been three days without
water previous to our arrival at the head of the Bight. From this point
we had 135 miles to travel without water, until we had passed the first
of the remarkable line of cliffs mentioned by Captain Flinders. In
effecting this passage, our horses were five days without water, and were
consequently much reduced in strength and condition. The line of cliffs
now receded some miles from the coast, but still continued running nearly
parallel to it inland, and forming a perfectly level hank, visible beyond
the low and barren country intervening between it and the sea; until, as
we advanced, the whole merged in a succession of high sandy or stony
ridges, covered by a dense and impenetrable scrub, and reaching to the very
borders of the sea. To attempt a passage through such a tract of country
was quite cut of the question, and we were consequently obliged to keep
very near the coast, and frequently to trace round its shores for many
days, thus considerably increasing the distance we should otherwise
have had to traverse. For four days we continued to travel steadily
without finding water; on the fifth our horses were much exhausted,
and one by one, three of our best dropped behind, and we were com-
pelled to leave them to their miserable fate. The other poor animals
still continued to advance with us, although suffering much from the
almost total want of food as well as water. This dreadful state of sus-
pense and anxiety continued until the afternoon of the seventh day,
when, by God?s blessing, we were once more enabled to procure water by
digging among the sand drifts of the coast, ?after having accomplished
a distance of fully 160 miles; throughout which not a drop of water
could be procured, even by digging.
� We had now seven horses left, but they were barely alive. For eight
months previous to our leaving Fowder?s Bay, they had almost inces-
santly been occupied in the labours of the expedition to the northward;
and in that space of time had travelled over a distance almost incredible;
and it required far more than the short month we were able to afford
them at Fowler?s Bay, to recruit their exhausted strength, or renew a
spirit that was almost broken by incessant toil. It may readily, there-
fore, be imagined that the severe privations they endured in rounding
the Great Bight had reduced them to perfect skeletons, without either
strength or spirit. To me it was only a matter of surprise that a single
horse should have survived such extremity of suffering. We were now
at a place where we could procure abundance of water, but there was
scarcely any grass for our poor horses, and the little they could find was
coarse, sapless, and withered. To add to our difficulties, we were almost
without provisions. In the early part of this journey, we were obliged
to abandon the heavy part of our baggage; water-kegs, ropes, buckets,
horseshoes, tools, medicines, pack-saddles, clothes, great-coats, and part
of the ammunition, were all left behind. As we advanced, and our
horses became weaker, it was necessary to leave even the provisions,
instruments, and the remainder of our ammunition, light though they
were; while we hurried on with the wretched animals, scarcely daring


to hope that it might yet he possible to save their lives. Having arrived
at the water, and rested there during six days, I sent my overseer and
one of the native boys (with the three strongest of the horses driven
loose) to try to recover the things we had last left, and which w r ere about
50 miles from the water; those abandoned earlier on the journey were
too far distant for us to attempt their recovery. On the fifth day they
returned, after a most painful journey ; one of the horses had perished,
the other two almost dead, and the party had only succeeded in bring-
ing a portion of the baggage they were sent for. As there were many
things among those they had not brought which we could ill afford to
spare, I left the overseer in charge of the party, and the day following his
return I proceeded myself, accompanied by one of the elder boys, but
without horses, to make a second attempt for their recovery ; this I
effected, and on the fourth day rejoined my party at the water. Our
horses were now reduced in number to five, and the whole were so
thoroughly jaded and worn out, that it was evident we could not attempt
to move from our present position for some time to come, especially as
we had the gloomy prospect of a vast extent of country before us in which
there was not the least hope of water being found. In the meantime
our provisions were rapidly disappearing. From the very commencement
of the journey our weekly allowance had been very limited ?gradually
it had been further reduced ?and now that a long delay w r as unavoidable,
1 found it necessary to kill one of the horses to enable us to husband the
little flour we had remaining.
? Hitherto my labours had been comparatively light ?for in the midst
of all the cares and anxieties by which I was surrounded, my overseer
had placed the most implicit confidence in my guidance, and had cheer-
fully gone through the duties that fell to his share. This support Ino
longer experienced, and it was with the greatest pain I discovered that
my fellow traveller had become disheartened and dispirited, foreboding
evils that might not occur; and though he still exerted himself readily
and strenuously on every occasion, I could readily perceive that (although
the greatest difficulties of the undertaking were over) he was disinclined
to continue the expedition, and would rather have attempted to re-cross
the fearful country behind us in the vain hope of being able to return to
Fowler?s Bay, where we had left a considerable depfit of provisions, This
dispiriting impression became, unfortunately, conveyed to all the native
boys, and eventually became the cause of an occurrence as frightful as
it was fatal to the poor fellow with whom it had originated. Ilf the
earlier stages of the expedition the three native boys had behaved well,
and been very serviceable; but, as we advanced, this good conduct gra-
dually disappeared, and, added to our other annoyances, not long after
leaving Fowler?s Bay, it became necessary for the whole party to walk,
and though the native boys were allowed to ride long after myself and
the overseer had given it up, it at last became imperative, from the state
of the horses, they should be dismounted. This, added to the insufficient
quantity of food which our low state of provisions allowed to each indi-
vidual, made the three boys gloomy and sulky, and we had frequently
much trouble in getting them to assist in any way ; and then the little
they performed was rarely done with cheerfulness and good humour. It

was impossible to make them understand the necessity of the case. As
long as ever a horse could walk, they considered it a hardship not to
ride, and as long as there was an ounce of provisions left they considered
themselves ill-used if not allowed to eat to excess. It was of no avail
telling them that, if the horses were ridden they could never get through
the journey, and that we should have to carry everything ourselves?or,
that, if we consumed the little stock of provisions we had all at once, we
must starve afterwards. The fact of myself and overseer walking and
living on the same allowance of food as themselves was no argument to
them; and we could not dissipate a sullen discontented humour. This
sullenness of disposition became much augmented, when they perceived
that the overseer himself was doubtful and disheartened at our future
prospects, and I really think their impression was, that we could never
accomplish the journey we had undertaken. In this frame of mind it
was they deserted from the party (April 22nd), after being detected steal-
ing the provisions during the night ?a practice they had continued some
days before they were found out. After an absence of four days they
returned, and begged to be forgiven, stating that they were unable to
procure food of any kind for themselves. As they were freely received
again, I had strong hopes that their future conduct would be better, but
it would appear from the sequel that they were still unwilling to con-
tinue to prosecute the journey, that they still looked back with longing
to the provisions left at Fowler?s Bay, and that they had only rejoined
the party again with the view of plundering the camp of provisions at the
first favourable opportunity, and then endeavouring to retrace their steps
to a place where they knew plenty had been left, and from thence (should
they succeed in arriving there) they might eventually make their way
to Port Lincoln, or get away in some of the vessels whaling along the
coast. This scheme was unhappily but too successfully executed during
the night of the 29th April, whilst I was absent from the camp, engaged
in watching the horses to prevent them straying. After plundering the
stores of provisions and fire-arms, it would appear they were preparing
to depart, when the unfortunate overseer awoke, and in his attempt to
prevent their purpose fell a victim to these ruthless murderers.
? A copy of the depositions of myself and the boy Wylie (who did not
accompany the other two), relative to this melancholy occurrence, is
herewith enclosed for the information of his Excellency.
? I was now deprived of my only aid, and felt bitterly the loss of a
man whose fidelity and good conduct had retained him in my service for
many years, and whose unwillingness to leave me, when I commenced
this perilous journey, has been the unconscious means of his own de-
struction. At a distance of fully 450 miles from Fowler?s Bay, and
nearly 600 from King George?s Sound, I was now in a position but little
to be envied. Left alone with a single native, whose fidelity I could
place no dependence upon, with but little provisions, and almost without
arms, whilst my jaded horses had already been three days without water.
I had no time for deliberation. To attempt to retrace my steps to
Fowler?s Bay I knew would be certain destruction ?it would have been
impossible for us to re-cross that fearful country ?and I had, therefore,
no alternative but to push on for King George?s Sound, humbly trusting


possibly, afford secure harbours for boats, but the circumstances under
which I was travelling did not admit of my delaying to examine them,
and, for the convenience of crossing, I usually kept so far inland as to
intercept them above the termination of the salt-water reaches. The
high downs among which these water-courses wind are, as I remarked
before, sandy, and covered with shrubs, and the soil poor, and destitute
of grass; but in the valleys themselves, and in small portions of the
slopes immediately above them, we found some patches of good and,
occasionally, of rich soil, upon wdiich the herbage was abundant and
luxuriant. These tracts, however, as far as I could judge, were of very
limited extent; nor was there any timber in their vicinit}', beyond the
few small stunted tea trees growing along the banks of the w 7 ater-courses.
At intervals between these various creeks, we met with many holes?
sometimes of salt, at other times of fresh, water. A few tea-trees, and
occasionally a few straggling eucalypti, grew around their margins; but
I seldom succeeded in finding any grass.
? Passing behind Lucky Bay to the lagoons W. of Esperance Bay,
I traversed a considerable extent of grassy land, consisting principally
of sandy undulations, but with many patches of rich soil in the flats and
valleys. Water appeared to be abundant; but there was still a total ab-
sence of all timber but the tea-tree. From the salt lagoons we crossed over
a very barren country, and had much difficulty in procuring any grass for
our horses. The water is generally very brackish, and there is much
scrub. The rock formation was principally quartz, ironstone, and sand-
stone, with much grit on the surface. About sixteen miles N.E. of Cape
Riche, we fell in with a considerable salt-water river from the W.N.W.,
which appeared to join the sea at a gap left by Flinders in the coast line,
and marked as ? a sandy bight, not perfectly seen.? We found several
permanent pools of fresh-water not very far distant, in deep narrow
gullies, by which the country hereabouts is much intersected. From the
depth of the river, and boggy nature of its bed, we were obliged to trace
its course for about ten miles from the sea before we could cross. Here
the water-course was obstructed by a ledge of rocks, and its channel
appeared to become more contracted and rocky, whilst the soil, for the
most part, is of an inferior description. Along its immediate banks
there was a little grass, and more wood than we had previously seen any-
where ; the trees are, casuarina, tea-tree, and eucalypti. Beyond the
point at which I crossed the river, the country (as far as I was enabled
to judge from a distant view) appeared to improve somewhat; many
clear and seemingly grassy patches were seen on the slopes towards the
river : and good runs, for either sheep or cattle, might probably be found
in this direction. After crossing the river, we met, for the first time,
with stunted trees of the kind called the mahogany; but it was not until
we had passed some miles to the westward of Cape Riche that we saw any
large trees, or got into a country that could properly be called a timber
one. Here the mahogany, red gum, casuaringe, and other trees common
at King George?s Sound, abounded, and formed a tolerably dense forest
nearly all the way to that settlement. From the head of Doubtful Island
Bay, I had kept some distance from the coast, cutting off the various
corners as circumstances admitted, and cannot, therefore, give an opi-


nion of the country immediately upon the coast line. That portion
of it, however, which lies between Cape Riche and King George?s
Sound is, I believe, already too well known to require any further
examination.
? On the 2nd June we had met with a French whaler, the Missis-
sippi, of Havre, commanded by Captain Rossiter. To this gentleman I
am much indebted for the very kind and hospitable reception I experi-
enced during a residence of twelve days on board, whilst my horses
were recruiting after their severe toils, and for the very liberal manner
in which I was furnished with supplies for prosecuting my journey to
King George?s Sound. At the latter place I arrived on the 7th July
instant, after having travelled over an extent of country which, from
sinuosities of the coast line and other obstructions, has exceeded upwards
of 1040 miles in distance from Fowler?s Bay; and for the last 590
miles of which I was unaccompanied by any but a native of King
George?s Sound, known by the name of Wylie, and whom I would re-
spectfully recommend to his Excellency the Governor, as deserving of
the favour of the Government, for services rendered under circumstances
of a peculiarly trying nature. I have omitted to state that, during the
progress of our journey, we met with very few natives, and these, for the
most part, are timid but well disposed. The language spoken by them
is exactly similar to that of the natives of King George?s Sound as far as
the promontory of Cape le Grand; and this similarity may probably
extend to the commencement of the Great Cliffs, in about longitude
E. A little beyond this point the language is totally different,
and the boy Wylie could not understand one word of it.
