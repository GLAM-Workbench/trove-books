T N past years a great want was felt by the Colonial commer-

protection should be open to them against the heavy losses
from which they were compelled to suffer, owing to their
inability to ascertain the position of their constituents,
whether resident within or without the colony—losses which,
in many instances, had this means been available, would
never have been experienced by them.
Prior to 1878, the necessity of Trade Protection made
itself felt with tremendous force ; but since that time a very
great alteration has taken place in the manner in which
commercial affairs are conducted, and the losses which might
have arisen through dealing with dishonest tradesmen, or
those on the verge of bankruptcy, have been reduced to a
comparatively small scale. This was mainly owing to the

THE NEW SOUTH WALES
SjVcMfe |lSrut^ctlw
T N past years a great want was felt by the Colonial commer-
cial community of some association, by means 1 of which
protection should be open to them against the heavy losses
from which they were compelled to suffer, owing to their
inability to ascertain the position of their constituents,
whether resident within or without the colony—losses which,
in many instances, had this means been available, would
never have been experienced by them.
Prior to 1878, the necessity of Trade Protection made
itself felt with tremendous force ; but since that time a very
great alteration has taken place in the manner in which
commercial affairs are conducted, and the losses which might
have arisen through dealing with dishonest tradesmen, or
those on the verge of bankruptcy, have been reduced to a
comparatively small scale. This was mainly owing to the
M33OC


efforts of Messrs, Bretnall Bros, who, at first, under great
difficulties, commenced the issue of what is now known as the
“ Trade Report.” At a time when business men lacked facilities
to ascertain with any certainty the financial position of their
neighbours, Messrs. Bretnall Bros, by dint of careful and
prompt enquiries, were able to' supply the necessary know-
ledge. Thus it was that some persons who had been for a
considerable period able to procure too extensive credit,
and still tried to procure it, notwithstanding adverse changes
in their finances, were prevented from perpetrating further
frauds (for operations under such conditions can be called by
no other name) by means of the “ Trade Report,” which con-
tained a full and exact record of Registrations of Bills of
Sale; Mortgages on Stock, Cattle, Horses, Wool, Crops;
Failures, &c. These registrations are carefully extracted
from the Supreme Court and the Registrar-General’s Offices,
and are embodied in a private circular sent to members of
the office.
It has been contended that the publication of such a
circular is injurious to some business men—so it possibly is—
but certainly not to those who wish to conduct their affairs on
a straightforward basis, because the knowledge that a Bill of
Sale is registered, or a mortgage effected, over their property
will not prevent them from obtaining a reasonable amount of
credit, which they under the circumstances might ask for ; but,
on the other hand, it decidedly would affect the dishonest


trader, who would attempt to procure a greater amount of
credit than his balance at his bank or his known assets would
warrant. In consequence of this, less deception is practised,
from the very fact that a person who has mortgaged his all
knows full well that it would be useless applying for further
credit, as his position is tolerably well known to business
people. The publication, therefore, compels many men to go on
real and not fictitious grounds, and credit being refused when
the position does not warrant it many are saved from dis-
honour and disgrace.
“ The New South Wales Trade Protective Institute,” now
under the able management of Mr. John Gibbs, who suc-
ceeded the Messrs. Bretnall Bros, in 1885, and who had long been
connected with the Office, supplies its members with the fullest
obtainable information in the shortest possible time, and as it
has ramifications extending throughout Australasia, as well as
in Europe and America, no difficulty stands in the way of
satisfying all enquiries.
The value of this Institution cannot be over estimated.
It conduces to the honorable conduct of business, and places
it upon a far more sound basis ; those only who arc members
of the office and who were in business before it was inaugurated
can properly appreciate its value, understand the good it has
wrought, and the many pounds it has saved them by timely
information. Before the introduction of the “ Trade Report,”
business people received orders and their would-be customers


made various representations to them as to their solvency, of
which the merchant had absolutely no means of ascertaining
the truth. Some applied to their bankers, and if they were
not able to assist them, were in great difficulty as to obtaining
any information. Even if information were obtained, in how
many cases was it reliable ? In very few, for though, no
doubt, the information they received was given in good faith,
those who supplied it were only able to judge from very
imperfect knowledge. But with the Institute it is different,
its offices, trustworthy agents, and travelling reporters exist
everywhere, and, as they work silently and cautiously, are able
to get behind the scenes, and the result of the enquiries is
made known in such a short time that a would-be customer
has no knowledge that either he or his business have been
the subject of inspection. As business at the present is
carried on almost solely on a credit system, it is absolutely
necessary that one should know the financial standing of his
fellow business-man, in order that, on the one hand, he may
not suffer loss through over-cautious trading; or, on the other
hand, through over zeal to do business with those of whom he
knows little or nothing. These risks are minimised, if not
altogether avoided, by not neglecting to profit by the lessons
taught in the pages of the “ Trade Report ” issued by the New
South Wales Trade Protective Institute, and by taking
advantage of the many facilities offered by them. It is
possible to conceive a case where a man may for months be a


subscriber and find nothing in the circular to affect him in any
way, in which case he should certainly be thankful; and yet, the
moment he may discontinue his subscription on the ground
above mentioned, a notice appears which might have saved him
a large sum. That such instances do occur there is not the
slightest reason to doubt, and many examples of it have come
under the notice of the Institute. The work, as carried ou by
this Institute, is as perfect a guard as may be against loss.
Having so far dealt in generalities, we would now bring
under notice the several departments of the Institute, with the
object of explaining the working of them more fully than has
been done hitherto.
First of all then, a weekly private circular is issued regu-
larly to members, containing a complete record of registered
securities, comprising—Bills of Sale, Stock Mortgages, Crop
and Wool Liens, Settlements and Contracts of Sale, Assign-
ments and Transfers of Securities, Insolvencies, together with
full information in regard to meetings in Insolvent Estates,
Certificate Meetings, Assignment of Estates, Discharges of
Stock Mortgages, Satisfied Bills of Sale, Dividends Payable,
Companies Registered, Dissolutions and New Partnerships,
Business Changes, Notices to Creditors, Answers to Corres-
pondents, and other information affecting persons in business.
A daily circular is also issued for the convenience of City
members, containing the registrations for the previous day ;
and at the end of each half-year an Index in pocket form,


bound in cloth, is also issued, thus enabling members to
readily turn up any name they may require.
The Commercial Enquiry Branch next demands attention,
and while no claim is made to infallibility, we do assert, with-
out fear of contradiction, that our system is more perfect than
that of any other kindred office in Australasia, and surpassed
by few of the largest European or American offices. The New
South Wales Agencies of the Institute number upwards of
four hundred, in addition to travelling reporters, besides
which, the Institute is affiliated with the principal recognised
Intercolonial, European, and American Trade Protection
Offices, through whom information is obtained for members,
and to whom letters of introduction are given to members,
\
thus enabling them or their representatives to obtain informa-
tion direct during their visits to the other Colonies or the Con-
tinent, advantages which no other office in New South Wales
could possibly offer.
The Collection of Debts also forms another important branch
of the Institute to which special attention is given, and,
through the solicitors to the Institute, processes are issued for
the recovery of moneys. One great advantage in connection
with this branch is that no commission is charged unless a
recovery is effected (except where legal measures are specially
authorised, in which case legal expenses only are charged),
and the large number of agencies throughout the whole of the
colonies gives the Institute special facilities in this branch.


Bills of Sale—These must be made in
duplicate, with an affidavit by the attest-
ing witness ... 5 0
The registration of all classes of securities, such as Bills of
Sale, Stock Mortgages, Crop and Wool Liens, Real Property
Transfers, Mortgages, &c,, is effected, and, owing to the
great inconvenience members in the country frequently
experience in getting ordinary securities registered, the
Institute has undertaken to do this work at very low rates, as
may be seen on reference to the following scale of charges,
viz. :
The following Scale of Charges is made to Members for Regis-
trations, as wider :—
s, d.
Stock Mortgages.—A single copy only
necessary, and no affidavit of witness ... 10 6
Liens on Cropsi „ „
{• To be made in duplicate 6 0
Liens on Wool)
Beal Property—Torrens Act.
Mortgages and Leases, each 17 6
Transfers where no New Certificate is
required 17 6
Transfers where new Certificate is re-
quired ... 37 6
(Extra fees are in some cases payable for
Married Women’s acknowledgments,
&c. In these cases they are charged
additional nett.
Real Property under the old Act. —
Mortgages, Leases, and conveyances each ‘l2 6
Stamp Duty and Postage, additional nett.
—No stamp duty is necessary on securities
by way of Mortgage, such as Conditional
Bills of Sale, Stock Mortgages, Crop and
Wool Liens, kc.


Terms will be forwarded on application.

members.
The Institute also undertakes all kinds of Searches for
Wills, Real Property, &c., at a low scale of charges.
All descriptions of Accountancy work are undertaken,
particular attention being paid to the Closing of Estates.
In fact, the many advantages of the Institute are so obvious
that to dwell further on them would be useless. An examina-
tion of its system cannot fail to satisfy any one as to the
ability of the management to substantiate all its claims, and
every business man is urgently solicited to participate in the
advantages thus offered.
