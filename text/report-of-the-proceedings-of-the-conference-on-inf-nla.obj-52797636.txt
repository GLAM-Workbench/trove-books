Value,
Service
The extensive manufacture of all
kinds of clothing by David Jones’
has constituted a marked advance
in Australian industry.
The advantages of purchasing
goods made in Australia are at
once apparent, and better values
are obtainable because two profits
(manufacturers’ and wholesalers’)
are entirely eliminated. Materials
are of a more reliable quality, and
styles can be changed immediate-
ly, in accordance with the most
recent advices from fashion cen-
tres.
An inspection and comparison of
the goods offered at David Jones’
will effectively demonstrate the
accuracy of their claim to supply
<l better values.”

PREFACE.
The importance of promoting the Welfare of Infants and
Children for the safety of the nation—as much as for the
happiness of the individual—has never been more fully
appreciated by those already engaged in such work than it is
at the present juncture.
The time seemed ripe in N.S.W. for holding a Conference
which would stimulate public interest and deepen in citizens
their sense of responsibility towards the youngest members of
the community. Accordingly, a few especially interested in the
subject, arranged a meeting of representatives of Infant Welfare
and kindred associations at the British Medical Association
Rooms on January 16, 1917, when it was decided to hold
a Conference on Infant and Child Welfare on May 23 and
24 following, and those, present formed themselves into a general
committee, and appointed an executive to carry it out.
Regarding the contents of this volume, the papers cover a
wide range of subjects of vital interest, and the committee feel
that it will serve as a permanent record of a successful and
interesting Conference.

REPORT OF THE PROCEEDINGS
WEDNESDAY, MAY 23, 1917
OPENING SESSION
The Conference was opened by Lady Helen Mtinro
Ferguson , on Wednesday afternoon, in the presence
of a large gathering. ,
Her Excellency said :
We are met here to-day to discuss questions which are
attracting special attention just now, because the events of the
war have brought home to everyone that in the last resource the
Nation depends for its existence on the numbers and the quality
of its population, and, consequently, everyone is turning their eyes
to the children of the land, and is considering what can be done
to give them the very best chance of surviving the dangers of
infancy, and to give them the chance of growing up strong in mind
and in body. The war has also caused more people than mere
individuals to take interest in the vital statistics of our young-
children, and it has supplied figures which are very useful for the
purpose of comparison. Sir Charles Mackellar, who is one of
the great authorities on child life, and has done so much for child
welfare, states in his opening letter that, Whereas in the last two
and a half years we have lost 17,672 men, overseas, at the war,
we have in the same period of time lost here in Australia 32,600
children under five years of age. of whom 23,360 were under one
year of age. This seems to show that the babies take almost as
great risk on themselves as the soldiers, and that there are some-
times as great dangers in the home as on the battle-field.
Now, we know that in these 17,000 odd lives, Australia has
lost the “flower of her manhood,” but, amongst these 32,000
young children a good proportion would have grown up to be men
and women of the same stamp, and, therefore, the nation has just
as much need to lament over one casualty list as over the other.
Fortunately, the reasons for infant mortality have been widely-
studied in many countries. Royal Commissions have sat and
have tabulated the causes of the unnecessary mortality under 12


heads, and, if you will eliminate one of them —the tragedy of
inherited diseases—the character of the others is such as to
render them preventible. In this instance, you have on the one
hand such causes as wrong foods, septic milk, deficient know-
ledge of the needs of infants, insufficient care of mother and
baby, bad hygiene, and, on the other hand you have this grand
total of loss of life amongst the youngest in the country. Now,
the question is, What are we to do? I think the very fact that
these causes appear in themselves so very trivial is the result that
we have done as yet so very little. If the angel of death were to
visit these 23,000 homes in the shape of some dread plague or
epidemic all human science would be mobilised to deal with it;
but, when the angel strikes through indigestible foods, stuffy
rooms, bad hygiene or bad midwifery, heroic measures seem out
of place; nor, indeed, are they necessary, because what these
causes mean is that a little more knowledge, a little better mother-
craft in many homes, would be,more effective to turn that des-
troying angel from the door than was the “blood on the lintel” in
the olden story.
Fortunately we have many encouraging examples of what
can be achieved to bring knowledge and instruction in mother-
craft into the homes of the land. You here in Sydney some years
ago started some inspectors (I think you called them) who taught
the right methods of feeding young infants, and, in a very few
years, the mortality from gastric trouble amongst babies fell from
1.55 to .81.
Then there is the celebrated example of the Mayor of
Huddersfield, who determined to do something, during his tenure
of office, for baby mortality. He therefore issued promissory
notes of £1 to every mother whose child was born, during his
tenure of office, and the promise was that £1 would be paid to that
mother if she produced a strong and living infant at the end of
the first year. It is surprising how the infant mortality fell
during the reign of that particular mayor, but, to do the mothers
of Huddersfield justice, it was not because of the £1 that was
promised, but because on the back of the £1 note were written
directions on the right way of feeding and caring for the infants,
and it was to this knowledge, brought to their homes in a
form which attracted considerable attention, that the remarkable
results were due.
Then we have in New Zealand, Dr. Truby King, who has
made this particular question a special study, and. some time ago
a society formed by Lady Plunkett who established an order of
nurses to look after the babies and instruct the mothers . . . .
Parts of New Zealand can boast of the smallest infantile
mortality in the world.
I know that at home, in my own town in Scotland, the appoint


merit of a special district nurse to look after the babies, in which
work she was assisted by a body of health workers, also brought
down the infantile mortality there considerably.
Now, I think the question before the Conference is—How best
can we bring this necessary knowledge to improve mothercraft
into the homes.
These examples seem to point to the fact that district nurses
(and we must not think only in terms of Sydney) and bush
nurses in the country, mothers’ schools, baby clinics, and mater-
nity homes where mothers can have rest before and after their
confinement, are the best means. But, though we have all these
agencies, we have not enough. There are in this great and widely
dispersed land too few nurses, and I noticed in the bush nursing
report of this year that during the past year (I think) no less than
six of their nursing centres had ceased to exist owing to the lack
of local interest in their work, and, therefore, the inability to"
raise £125,000 per annum to supplement what was done by the
Government.
I am sure if it was known locally the immense value of the
work done by these nurses, there would be no lack of local
interest, and, when we look around and see what splendid things
have been achieved by people of this country for the soldiers to
provide them with hospitals, equipment and comforts, we cannot
help believing that when all necessity for that work is over, ade-
quate provisions of that kind for the saving of child life will be
forthcoming.
But, of course, this conference is going to deal with other
questions, too, concerning child welfare, and I hope that the dis-
cussion on kindergarten will bring more support to those excellent
institutions. I don’t know anywhere outside of Australia where
there is a better system of kindergarten schools for the moral,
mental, and physical training of the children. Besides, in the
kindergarten work we have a splendid example of the amount of
public spirit there is in the country, and it brings home to us that
there will always be a splendid response to any appeal that reaches
the heart of the public and commends itself to their intelligence.
Therefore, this conference, if it comes to definite conclusions;
and can make definite recommendations, and can also tell the
people which of the existing agencies ought to be supported, I feel
confident that the outcome of it will be a permanent increase in
the well-being of the mothers and children in this land.


INFANTILE MORTALITY AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE.
By G. H. Knibbs, F.S.S., M.
de 1’ Inst. Inst. Stat., etc., etc,.
Commonwealth Statistician.
I. Life and its dangers. Life has been likened to a
bridge, along which each generation is compelled to tread.
Measured in spans of years, its greatest length is perhaps
105 to 110 spans, but none may cross it, for as each passes
along this bridge, he is assailed, and at its first and last spans
with special violence. Initially the numbers who fall through
this assault are so great that—were the rate maintained—all
would have vanished ere the 67 days had passed. The
average rate of falling for the whole of the first day even,
would extinguish in 106 days all born. This is in Australia.
In no other place, excepting perhaps New Zealand, would this
short stretch be covered.
This rate of falling however dwindles with amazing
rapidity for the first week and then more and more slowly,
till about the twelfth year, when it is only about i/3400th
part of what it was at the very beginning of life. After
twelve years of age the numbers falling on the Bridge of Life
increase and with ever growing rapidity, until when, say, the
95th span is reached, the rate of falling is what it was on the
sixth day. 1 This again is as in Australia and is based upon
the evaluations of the 191*1 Census.
As regards these menaces to life, great improvements
have taken place in recent years. In Australia the total
mortality for the first year of life has fallen roughly at the
rate of 1 per cent, per year for the past 30 years. 2 Can it be
made to fall more slowly by the exercise of greater care and
the spread of appropriate knowledge? Doubtless, but we shall
be disappointed if we imagine that all child life can be saved.
An organism plastic somewhat in the inverse ratio of
the time it has endured; that is to say, its metabolism—the
rate at which that waste and repair, which is an essential
of life, proceeds—decays with a rapidity increasing as some
function of the reciprocal of its period of its existence.®
Apparently any organism is both most vulnerable and most
recuperable when most plastic. There is reason also to
believe that the greatest rate of mortality is pre-natal. But
as to this there is—so far as I am aware—no reliable statistic.
The evidence of still-births conveys some amount of informa-
1. The respective rates are 0.341 and 0.356.
2. The fall from 1886 to iBqs was 87.84 per cent., and from iBq6
to 1906 it was 78.48 per cent.
3. Thus if Xis its age. its metabolism is F {I 7X) ; the function,
however, has not been accurately determined.


tion, but it is difficult, if not impossible, to ascertain a rate
therefrom. The transition from pre-natal to post-natal life
is a vicissitude in the life history of organisms, which imperils
particularly those which are weak, ill-nourished or malformed,
and many a life passes away at birth because of dyspnoea.
These are cases of failure of adaptation to the new environ-
ment.
Organisms carry within them all the aids or hindrances
of their heredities, and since they may be attacked even pre-
natally by diseases to which, by heredity, they may be non-
resistant, the human organism must be regarded, in the
individual case, as more or less impaired and liable to death’s
disaster, either from disease attacking it from within itself or
attacking it from without. The attack may be very rapid:
for example, many new-born children die of tubercular menin-
gitis. Thus the young organism is in peril from ill-nutrition,
from disease, from accident, and from adverse heredities or
various kinds. It is obvious all these can be combatted m
proportion as State and personal eugenics advance, and it is
from the statistical study of infantile mortality that an appro-
priate measure of the total effect of all influences operating,
can be obtained.
2. The Secular Improvement in Infantile Mortality. —ln
Table I. (page 14), is shewn the extraordinary falling-off in the
last few decades, in the rate of mortality for children under one
year of age.
It is a curious fact—one well worthy of attention—that,
where the birth-rates for countries are very high, the rates
of infantile mortality are almost invariably also high. An
indication of this is given in Table 11. (page 14).
The ignoring of this fact has led to some strange conclu-
sions as to the jeopardy of populations from low b.rth-rates.
death-rate of the first year of life is so large, and so many
vicissitudes have been passed through, that we may well adopt
the end of the first year as the proper time to measure the
effective or residual birth-rate. Thus, instead of counting
those born, we may well count only those who survive one year.
The corresponding birth-rate is found by multiplying the
actual birth-rate by the ratio of survivors for one year to
those born. This survival factor for Australia is now about
0.93. In the above table for Chile it is 0.678; that is to say,
the birth-rate is roughly reduced by one-third.
Incidentally it may be mentioned chat the deaths for the
first year of life, occurring in any calendar year, arc partly
deaths of those born during the calendar years in question,
and partly deaths of those born in the preceding year. From
the birth-rates and the infantile death-rates of Australia it
may be shewn that about 0.732 of the deaths are of those

•Approximate estimates only. There are no available statistics for the accurate estimation of the frequency of death during
each of the first 24 hours of life.


born m the same calendar year, the balance, 0.268, belong-
ing to the preceding year. In determining residual birth-
rates, therefore, this fact has to be taken into account. Thus,
on making the year of the births agree with the year to which
the infantile mortality is referred, the result is as shewn
in Table 111. (page 15).
Of course, from a still wider point of view, one might
refer the birth-rate to its efficiency as at a later period of life.
Thus for other purposes we might have taken those who sur-
vived to age 7, to age 14, or to age 21, etc. From the stand-
point of the care of child-life, however, —with which we are
here concerned, —the survival for one year may be taken as
particularly appropriate.
3. Mortality of the first year of life. Reference has
already been made to the fact that the mortality is very great
at the beginning of life. How great is popularly not realised.
After the first twenty-four hours from birth have elapsed, and
for about one week onward, the probability of death dimin-
ishes as the length of time lived-, reckoned from the moment
of birth. Unfortunately the law is not determinable with
very great accuracy owing to defects in the recording of the
facts. Table IV. (page 15) gives the death-rates per diem for
the first year of life and at the end of the third year.
The rate is given as at the end of each day indicated.
It is obvious from the above table that, to reduce infantile
mortality, the factor of greatest importance is the ushering
in of the new life under the best possible conditions, and next
to that the care during, say, the first 7 days.
To realise this we may give a table of equivalent periods
so far as deaths are concerned, the basis being the number
dying during the first 24 hours from birth.
Period (days) ... 014 5.21 22.61 62.115 116.183 184.269 270.374
Length of Period 1 4 17 4o 54 68 86 105
Thus at the last quarter of a year (approximately) there
are only as many deaths in 105 days as occurred during the
first 24 hours after birth.
4. Mortality from specific causes of death. Thus far the
mortality from all causes has alone been considered. The
incidence of disease according to age, however, varies greatly
for different diseases. • In this respect diseases may be
divided into four classes, viz.:—
(i) Normal; viz., those in which the relative frequency
is similar to the relative frequency of death from
all causes combined;
(ii) Infantile, viz., those which characterise infancy
only;
(iii) Senile, viz., those which characterise old age only;
(iv) Median, viz., those which characterise middle age
only.


The infantile causes of death may be sub-divided into
three sub-classes, viz. (a) those in which the mortality is
greatest in the first year of life; (b) those in which it is later
than the first year; and (c) those in which the mortality is
greatest in the first year, but is followed by an irregular mor-
tality for all ages. Examples of these three sub-classes are:—
(a) Whooping Cough; congenital debility and malfor-
mations; simple meningitis.
(b) Diphtheria and croup; tubercular meningitis.
(c) Var.ous forms of tuberculosis.
Out of a total of 31,288 deaths of males and 24,135 deaths
of females under one year of age, the numbers from various
causes during the period 1910-1915 inclusive were as shewn in
Table V. fpage 18).
Of the above, those in the following tables have been
analysed by me, in respect of their frequency as compared with
the living of the same age and sex. The results are shewn
hereunder.
In Tables VII. and VIII. (pp. 19 and 20) the results for
■each of the first twelve months of life are similarly given, but
m this case per million of the same sex and age; Table VII. is
for males and Table VIII. for females.
These results shew that diarrhoea and enteritis, and con-
genital debility are the most serious causes of death in the
first year of life. Tables VII. and VIII. shew also that the
former reaches a maximum about the end of the third month
but does not diminish as rapidly as the latter.
An examination of the preceding tables shews clearly that
death from congenital debility and malformation is the most
serious feature of infantile mortality; and further, that whatever
be the cause of death, in most cases it is the first week of life
which involves the greatest risks. It is evident, therefore, that
practical eugenics must be concerned with pre-natal, as well as
post-natal, conditions. It will probably be found extremely
difficult to maintain, in the future, the same ratio of improvement
that has characterised the past three decades. Nevertheless, from
general knowledge one can rest assured that intelligent care
during the pre-natal period and good infant hygiene ought to
save many a life that at present is lost; or, if not lost, remains
in the form of a weak and ill-endowed member of the human
race.

5. CONCLUSlON. —Allegations have been made that in one
departement in France the infantile death-rate had been reduced
to zero.* Communication with the Director- of the Bureau of
Statistics of France shewed that the statement was not correct
and that the numbers were so small as to be without significance.
While all infant life cannot be saved, it is nevertheless true that
the death-rate can still be reduced and that the problem of the
social organism is to secure so desirable an end by bringing about
a better state of knowledge regarding the conditions under which
lives shall be so ushered into the world, as to be happy and
healthy. These conditions should, moreover, at least endure
through that critical period necessary for the young lives to be
fully established.
* The departement was Villiers-le-Duc in which in 10
years there were only 43 births and 4 infantile deaths. There
happened to be no deaths in 1912 to 1914, but there was 1
death for 2 births in 1915. To quote this experience of this
departement. with an average of only about 4 births a year,
is to mislead.


AIMS AND IDEALS OF FREE KINDERGARTEN.
MRS. JACKSON.
I have been asked to speak to you for a few minutes on
Kindergarten ideals.
Friends, these ideals are so high that we want to bring The
Kingdom of Heaven into the life of every poor and neglected
child In all ideals we have to “Hitch our Waggon to a Star,”
and if that star be the one that pointed the way to Bethlehem, all
our aims should lead in the same direction, for if there be any
higher ideal than that manifested in the life and teaching of Christ,
the world has yet to discover it.
Some people say the ideal is not practicable, and, especially
in these days of world turmoil, that Christianity has failed —
rather should we say that we have never given Christianity a
chance, and every day of our lives, in some way or other, we
are fighting against the Will of God as he would have it done on
earth. If, therefore, we can instil into the minds of our children
the duty of truthfulness in word and deed, and the necessity of
doing unto others as we would that they should do to us, we
shall be laying the foundation upon which the Kingdom of God
is built.
When asked to come here to-day, I wondered “what can I
say to the people to make them see the true value of our work?”
—for that is my chief object. We need your sympathy, interest
and co-operation. And as I wondered how to obtain all this, a
message came to me with startling clearness, a message as old
as the hills, and yet repeated in every fresh young life entrusted
to us: “Suffer little Children to come unto Me, and forbid them
not, for of such is the Kingdom of Heaven,” and if any work
in this world is helping to bring the Kingdom of Heaven on
earth to these little ones, it is the work done in the Free Kinder-
gartens. These schools might be well described as “A Nation
in the making,” and the question naturally arises, what kind of a
nation do you hope to make with these children?
Every day our Kindergarten children salute the Flag and say
“I give my head, my heart and my hands to my Country.” Of
what is this symbolic? The unit of the human family is the
home and the collection of homes becomes the community, and
it is natural that our love should centre round the home idea.
The flag, therefore, stands for what we cherish and when, as we
believe, in the British case, the flag stands for Liberty, Law and
Justice, it is right that the child mind should be taught to honor
the emblem. There is. however, sometimes a tendency to forget


that to the children of other countries their flag has much the
same meaning, and instead of this making a basis of community
of ideas, it is made one of difference, and not enough is made
of the necessity for. all the children working towards mutual
helpfulness, gathering, each from the other, the best that each
individual flag stands for, so that the dedication of the child’s
head, heart and hands, should become an offering of their best,
for the benefit of the whole human race, beginning with what is
nearest and best understood in childhood, their home circle.
A child coming into the atmosphere of the Free Kindergarten
soon realises that his tempers and wilfulness cause more suffering
and inconvenience to himself than to anyone else, and that in
rubbing elbows with his fellows, it is better and more com-
fortable all round to give out. as well as partake of loving service.
I have seen a boy not more than four years of age. a regular
street corner hooligan in the making, come into the Kindergarten
for the first time, and for a few hours disturb all the beautiful
harmony and happiness of the new world into which he has just
entered. I have seen that boy. a few days later, as adaptable and
amenable to reason and discipline as any child from a happy and
well-ordered home. And how has this been accomplished?'
Why! because love overcometh all things, and there is at least
a spark of the light that lighteth every man who cometh into
the world, even in the hearts of these little ones, and they res-
pond to the spirit and discipline of love as a flower responds and
opens to the sun. And as the flowers in a beautiful garden,
when carefully watched and tended, reward the loving service
expended on them, by blossoming out into beauty that gives delight
and cheer to many, so will a little chjld trained in the beautiful
garden of love naturally begin to express himself in loving
service to others.
Two wee bairnies came into our school one day, when I was
present, two such neglected, miserable cowed little creatures,
that I asked the director about them, and from her heard a sordid
storv of a miserable home and a drunken father, but oh! the
difference in the faces of those children after a very short time
in the Kindergarten —they had found a refuge, a haven, where
they experienced for the first time something of the joy of
living. The little girl with a baby doll, her face full of the
mother-love, would hardly have been recognised as the same
child Shortly after they came to us the father found work
away from Sydney and left his family, and they managed much
better without him.
I always feel very strongly in connection with the Kinder-
garten work that we are in it. not so much to teach, as to be
taught by the child, how to help him to discover himself, and to
make the best use of the good that is in him.


Children are not naturally naughty; what looks like naughti-
ness is generally misdirected energy. I well remember an
evening we once had in the Old Country in connection with a
Literary Society of which I was a member. It was an evening
of anonymous poetry, the subject chosen being childhood—one
verse of the prize poem ran something like this:
“When children are naughty ten chances to one
They suffer far more than they should,
They are copying us and what we have done
It is we who must try to lie good."
Our schools are all situated in the poor streets and most
densely populated districts of the city. The children’s parents
are of the busy working class—in the great majority of cases
the only playground is the street, the favourite toy —any old tin
can—its value being enhanced according to its noise-producing
capacity.
There is little need for me to dwell upon the danger of the
public street as a playground for our children, it must be pain-
fully apparent to the most casual observer; so let us aim at
getting guarded playing spaces for all the children, for in the
poor neglected street-playing child of to-day, we assuredly see the
possible criminal of to-morrow.
We hope, in time, to have playgrounds attached to all our
Kindergartens, and I am to-day in the happy position of being
able to tell you that we have just obtained permission from the
City Council to have playing space for the children of the
Devonshire Street Free Kindergarten in Prince Alfred Park.
The Council have also generously offered to erect a playshed
for us there. What better use?
We have been long in realising that the child is our greatest
asset, but at last he is beginning to come into his own. The
spirit of neglected childhood would seem to stand before us and
say, “I am here without any desire of my own, I am a life, a
thought of God who entrusted me to you. lam in your keeping,
what will you make of me?” and, friends, upon our answer to
that question depends the social problem of to-morrow.
Let us seek out and find these poor neglected children whose
parents, not generally for want of love, but through want of
better knowledge, have so little idea how to train and care for the
children they bring into the world; let us see to it that those
children shall, when their time comes, be well fitted to train and
care for the precious lives that may be entrusted to them.
We attach much importance to the social work done in the
Kindergartens, chiefly by means of clubs for boys and girls,
Mothers’ Meetings and Soda! F.venings, and our desire is to


make each school a sunshine-diffusing centre for the whole
neighbourhood in which it is situated, and to make every boy and
girl, who has passed through the school, feel that the loving and
far-reaching spirit of the Free Kindergarten still follows and
keeps in touch with its children.
And now, in conclusion, let me invite any who have not yet
seen one of our schools to delay no longer —and when you go,
do not forget to wait for the Good-bye Ceremony, the saluting
of the flag and the sweet upward look of confidence and trust
of the little children as they curtsey and say good-bye to the
director. I know you will come away not only willing but
anxious to help swell the numbers of these Free Kindergartens,
for so surely as these schools increase, so surely will crime and
hooliganism decrease, because the habits acquired in childhood,
whether for good or ill, will not easily be lost, so let us all unite
in our efforts to surround the child with loving kindness; he is
“a thought of God” and love is his due, and let us always re-
member that “children have more need of models than critics”—
“God lias lent them to our keeping
Ours the trust, the danger ours,
As the sowing—so the reaping,
Noxious weeds or fragrant flowers.”


THE SCHOOL AS A SOCIAL CENTRE.
MISS SIMPSON.
Lecturer in Education, Teachers’ College.
Mistress of Montessori Practical School, Blackfriars, Sydney.
Before going on to speak of the School as a Social Centre —or
as a socialising centre —I should like to say that a good deal is
already being done in this direction by our public schools and
public school teachers. Mothers’ meetings are held regularly in
connection with many of our kindergartens and infant schools.
The kindergarten is now an officially recognised link in the chain
of education. The State has seventy kindergarten rooms in the
city and rather more than that number in the country. These
rooms are-properly ecpiipped with small tables and chairs, and
are, in each case, under the control of a trained kindergartner
who has spent not less than two years at Teachers’ College,
Blackfriars. In these kindergartens the mothers and teachers
come together and co-operate in a way that was not thought of
a very few years ago.
In many of our primary schools Old Girls’ and Old Boys’
Clubs have long been established. A beginning has been made
in one or two centres with classes for adolescents and these will
doubtless grow under the fostering care of parent and teacher.
Then there are in many places cookery classes, dressmaking
classes, and millinery classes for mothers and elder sisters. These
are quite apart from the Evening Continuation Schools of which
there are many in operation in city and country.
I might speak with enthusiasm of the work that is being done
everywhere in the State by the Parents’ and Citizens’ Associa-
tions, but my purpose is not so much to tell of what has been done
as to suggest what might still further be done in connection with
our public schools.
The thought has often occurred to me that our school build-
ings and school grounds might be put to much better and fuller
use than at present, and the main purpose of this paper is to indi-
cate some of the directions in which the present school buildings
and playgrounds might be made of fuller service.to the com-
munity.
Taking first the matter of playgrounds for children. There is
not any reason to my mind why the area surrounding every school
in the city, or in the country for that matter, should be bolted
and barred against the children each day at four o’clock. Often
after school hours, on my way home or on business bent about


the city, I am struck by the numbers of children in the streets.
Everywhere one may see them, playing in the gutter, dodging in
and out among the traffic, hanging on to the backs of waggons,
crossing in front of swiftly-moving motor cars “just for the fun
of it,” and otherwise endangering life and limb —to say nothing
of the risk from subtler dangers to the moral and spiritual nature
which the life of the street holds. At such times lam filled with
sadness at the sight of our unused school playgrounds and empty
school buildings.
There is a school within easy reach of every child in this city
of Sydney. For seven hours of the day it is a centre of vivid and
happy life, and for the rest of the twenty-four hours this same
school is shut up, silent and unused. Surely there is something
wrong in our point of view when we bring children together for
seven hours a day under highly-qualified men and women, in an
environment where they learn all sorts of interesting things—
where cleanliness of mind and body is required, and where
healthy standards of life are set —and then, during more than the
same numljtjr of hours, we turn these same children out into the
street to absorb its uncleanness, to learn its language, and to
graduate in its criminality and vice. I say we are asleep or worse
while we allow these things to go on. The children themselves
realise that there is something amiss. One has only to notice the
many wistful little faces pressed against locked school gates after
school hours to be aware of this.
Taking our school playgrounds then, there seems to me no
reason why these spaces, small though they be in some cases,
should not be used after school hours by the children of the
neighbourhood. Simple, suitable play material, at any rate for
the younger children, should be provided. Such material might
include see-saws, overhead ladders, climbing poles, stall bars,
horizontal bars, miniature railway lines, sliding boards, and other
material of a like nature, dear to the hearts of all children in all
ages. I can speak from experience of the value of such equip-
ment. Some months ago we had the infants’ playground at
Blackfriars filled up in this way. \yhen we first thought of doing
it the pessimists told us there was not room enough for the
material, and even if there were room to squeeze it in half the
children using it would be injured, if not killed outright, within
the first week. The apparatus has now been in use several
months and no accidents of any kind have happened. Less super-
vision by the teachers is required than under ordinary circum-
stances. The children use the material continuously and with
great delight during the hours of play. Instead of making for
further crowding of the playground, it leaves clear, free spaces
for the children who want to play running games or ring games.
Apart from the physical benefits of such material as I have
mentioned, in the way of healthy exercise, may I draw attention


to the very great benefit derived from the joy of it. No exercise
for little children is of much value unless it has this element of
joy in it. Joy brings colour to the cheek, light to the eyes and
elasticity to mind and spirit. Its results are seen quite plainly in
the improved physical appearance of the children who experience
it.
The Education Department is fitting up another school play-
ground with play material, and I dare say more will quickly
follow. This is good—indeed it is excellent as far as it goes, but
it does not go far enough. Why should the children be shut out
from the joys of see-saws, sliding boards, climbing poles, and all
the other delightful things every day at three or four o’clock?
Why should they not be allowed to come back and play in the
schoolgrounds if they want to do so? The school is theirs and
no one has any right to shut them out of it.
Here, then, is one way in which our schools might be used as
social centres or play centres after school hours at any rate for
the younger children. One might even look forward to the time
when a few seats would be provided where mothers might
occasionally come and sit for a while watching their children at
play. Of course if the grounds were used after school, proper
supervision would be necessary, but I shall have something to
say later about supervisors and supervision;
Apart from the school playgrounds there should be, in my
opinion, other playgrounds for the younger children within ten
minutes or so of every poor mother, and this for the sake of the
mother as much as for the sake of the children. The poor
mother has as much right to be relieved of the care of her
children for a part of the day as the rich mother. She has also
as much right to the certainty that her children will be well looked
after as the mother who is rich enough to employ a nurse. The
mother in poor localities is household manager, cook, laundress,
dressmaker, tailor, children’s nurse, sick nurse, and mother all in
one. She is never alone during the whole of the twenty-four
hours. How, I ask you, can any human soul grow if it is never
alone and never has any quiet moments in which to think?
Turning next to the school building itself, the rooms in it
might be used for many purposes. If only Our clumsy fixed
desks could be replaced by more sensible movable furniture the
usefulness of our schools as social centres for the children could
be enormously increased. Here are some of the purposes for
which the rooms might be used: —
i. For gymnastic exercises and organized games. I think
every school should have its gymnasium, but putting this aside,
if only the furniture were movable a great many excellent
organized games could be played with the aid of fairly inexpen-
sive material.


2. Musical Drill and Folk Dancing should have a place in every
centre. The Folk Dance makes a strong appeal to the children,
and its value is now very generally recognised by educationists.
3. There might be rooms set apart where the little children
could have their dolls and tea sets, and toy engines, and go-carts,
and balls, and rocking horses and all the other dear delights of
infancy.
4. There should be rooms for quiet games such as draughts,
dominoes and chess.
5. Of course there should be a Library with a librarian to ad-
vise and guide. There should also be a story room where the old
stories, dear to all children, would be related by skilled story-
tellers. There might even be a room where dramatic games and
plays could be worked out —a sort of children’s theatre to which
other children, or even parents, might occasionally be invited.
6. In connection with the library, a good picture might now
and then be borrowed, and some one with right understanding
and knowledge enlisted to talk about it and tell its story —not for
the sake of giving information, but for the development of taste.
7. Art work and handwork would necessarily have a place in
any social ' centre or play centre scheme. Painting, drawing,
modelling, plain and fancy needlework, knitting, toy-making,
raffia work, and fancy basket making generally, could all be taken.
8. Our manual training rooms, of which there are many,
should certainly be used. I do not mean that there should be
manual training classes as such, but I do hold that if a boy wants
to make something he should have access to the tools wherewith
to make it, and a sympathetic adviser should be at hand 'to help
him over his difficulties. Of course it will be said that this would
ruin the tools. What matter if it does? What is the spoiling
of a few tools compared with the making of a citizen?
In all these I would emphasise the fact that these occupations,
and these rooms, are in no sense classes or class-rooms. They
are just rooms where the children might paint or sew or read,
or otherwise follow out the things in which they are interested,
and where they might move about and talk to each other in season
provided they do not annoy others. Dr. Montessori’s two rules
might be the governing law—“No child may interfere with the
liberty or comfort of anyone else,” and “No child may be guilty
of any act that is rude or unbecoming in itself.” All else might
be done.
In connection with these centres for children, I would have
schools for mothers, where such matters as simple hygiene, care
of the baby, care of children up to five years of age, plain needle-
work and cookery would be taught. I would specially emphasise


the care of children up to five years of age, and would urge it
upon the attention of those interested in child welfare. The
years from one to five are the most neglected period of the child’s
life, both by parents and the State. The baby gets attention, and
some care is taken with regard to feeding, clothing, and health
during the first year of life. The child of six and over must be
given attention for the school demands it. But the vears from
one to five receive little real attention from anyone.
Many other interests in connection with such centres as I
have indicated might be mentioned, but my paper is meant to be
suggestive only. I may add that many, if not all the things I
have spoken of are in operation in other countries. The London
County Council has given many of its schools for evening play
centres. So also have education authorities in other parts of
Britain. There are, of course, certain laws governing the centres,
and they are in charge of paid supervisors who are thoroughly
qualified for this kind of work.
1 want to say a brief word on supervisors and supervision, and
then I have done. I know there arc plenty of voluntary workers
who would gladly help in any movement of this kind, and if we
had established such centres as I have indicated voluntary
workers might do much to help. At first, however, supervisors
should be skilled, carefully chosen men and women. It is not
enough to have the will to do good work in this, or indeed in any
other direction. One must also have knowledge that is born of
serious study, and the experience that is gained only by practice.
The social centre supervisor must be teacher, companion, play-
fellow and foster-parent all in one. He or she must have a
strong—an unshakable faith in the original goodness of every
child. Without this faith one can do nothing.
There are perhaps two ways by which we might get suitable
supervisors for playgrounds and social centres. Voluntary
workers who are really in earnest might put themselves through
the training necessary for the work, or some teachers, already
trained, might be willing to give up to this work one or two nights
a week for a year or so. This would be hard on teachers who
are teaching all day, but I believe there are many who would do
it, for whatever the faults of our schools, no set of people can
compare with the teachers in them for self sacrificing devotion
to the interests of the children.


CHILD WELFARE AND THE ENDOWMENT OF
MOTHERHOOD.*
JOHN SULMAN, F.R.I.B.A.,
President of Town Planning
Association.
“The true veins of wealth are purple—and not in Rock, but in
Flesh—perhaps even the final outcome and consummation of all
wealth is in the producing as many as possible full-breathed,
bright-eyed and happy-hearted human creatures,” so wrote Rus-
kin in “Unto This Last” about the middle of the last century.
At the time he was regarded as a dreamer and idealist, but in
these days of storm and stress we can now realize that he was a
prophet. The large percentage of rejects unfit for military ser-
vice, the increase of insanity, the ever persistent cry for more
hospital accommodation, and the institution of all kinds of
agencies for the relief of distress show that things are-not as they
should be in any modern civilized State. Flow to attain such
health and wealth, as Ruskin describes, is one of the greatest
problems of the present day. It is being attacked on all sides,
but mostly by way of alleviation. The root of the matter seems
to me to consist in good parentage and good conditions for child
life. As the children grow up into men and women they can well
take care of themselves.
Let us consider the question of good conditions first. They
are adequate and proper food, clothing and shelter in a healthy
dwelling, in healthy surroundings, under wise and loving
parental control. For the well-to-do these are generally attain-
able, but as we go lower in the social scale, disabilities begin to
creep in, until in the lowest stratum they are mostly non-existent.
The well-to-do form but a small minority of the population, and
as a rule the number of their children in each family is less than
in those possessing little of this world’s goods. The race is there-
fore being continued, to a considerable extent, by those least able
to rear healthy offspring. It may be objected, why then does the
human race on the whole progress? The answer is that Nature’s
law of “the survival of the fittest” comes into play, and by a
deplorable sacrifice of infant life the balance is redressed.
Another is that in human nature there is an element of the Divine
striving ever upwards and onwards to perfection. But, which-
ever of the two is the true solution, the waste of infant and child
life is pitiable, and I believe in the long run preventible. The
public conscience has so far been stirred, that is allowed to the
mother, on the birth of every child; for necessary expenses if she
♦The writer introduced the subject by stating that the paper
must be taken as opening a discussion of the subject on the affirma-
tive side.


likes to claim it. It may in some cases be mis-used, and skilled
service instead of money might be better, but it is a step in the
right direction. Alany other ameliorative agencies, Governmental,
municipal and philanthropic are in operation, but beneficial as they
are they count but little compared with what is needed.
In the first place adequate means of support is in too many
cases lacking. Wages boards and arbitration courts have raised
the wages of many workers to existence level, but there is still a
large section earning less than is needed to support a family. In
many cases this is due to inherited defects or acquired vices, and,
with those earning a minimum wage, a portion is too often dissi-
pated in drink, gambling and other undesirable ways. The
mother of an infant requires good food, if she is to nurse it, as
well as attend to her household duties. In too many cases the
mother has to go out and work to secure the means of subsistence,
and thus the children are necessarily neglected.
Nearly 60 per cent, of the people of New South Wales live in
towns, and town life, as it at present exists, is not a healthy one
for the poor. In the larger cities they are crowded together in
mean houses, in mean streets, and a contaminated atmosphere.
The only play-place for the children is the gutter, until they go
to school, and then the school playground is usually too small.
In congested districts a playground every half mile is a necessity,
and slum dwellings should be eradicated. Already something has
been done in this direction, but the problem of supplying decent
bousing for the poorest class, at a rent they can pay, is a most
difficult one and is still unsolved. Many are beginning to think,
especially in Great Britain, that it cannot be provided except by
a Governmental subvention. To this there are many grave ob-
jections of an economic character.
Another serious menace to child life is ignorance on the part
of the parents, especially of the mother, of household economy
and child maintenance. Something is being done in our public
schools to correct this, but I venture to think (ladies, this is only
a man’s opinion) that after the three R’s arc mastered every girl
should be taught cooking, cleaning, sewing, elementary physiology
and hygiene, maternal duties and the care of child life, before
they devote much time to the other subjects of the present
curriculum. It is the former they will make most use of when
they grow up, and, with fully instructed mothers, many of the
present difficulties would be reduced if not altogether remedied.
It has been suggested that every mother should have a lien on
her husband’s wages proportionate to the number in family, but
this does not seem a very workable proposition. In decent work-
ing class families the husband hands over his wages to his wife
minus a proportion for his own pocket money, and if she is a
sensible, capable woman the family is well cared for. Where


the husband is a drunkard, a gambler, or a waster, the scheme
might be advantageous if there were any wages to draw upon.
The probable result would be another deserted wife and family.
On the other hand the wife might be incapable, or wasteful, and
in that case no advantage would be gained.
Let us now consider the relation of motherhood to the State.
The three necessities of any civilized community are the produc-
tion of the necessaries of life, the defence of the country, and the
perpetuation of the race. We provide for the first by the instruc-
tion of the young, and especially in the means of gaining a living
by continuation and technical schools, and apprenticeship so far
as permitted by trade union limitations. For the second we have
universal service within Australia. But of the third, and perhaps
most important function of all the State is hardly cognizant, except
for the marriage laws, the baby bonus and clinics, hospital treat-
ment and the medical inspection of school children. It is left to
the initiative of the sexes, and is practically unregulated and un-
assisted, whereas the begetting and rearing of healthy children
is most vital to the State from an economic and military point of
view. Any single woman engaged in industrial life receives such
pay as she can earn, but the mother who rears children receives
no pay at all and is dependent on the earnings of her husband.
This places the husband in an inferior economic position to the
single man, and is a deterrent to matrimony. If the perpetuation
of the race is vital to the State, it should be paid for the same
as any other service rendered. In short, motherhood should be
endowed. The principle is already partially recognized, by the
separation allowance to wives and children of soldiers, or by
pension if they are killed or incapacitated. In such cases it is
the service the soldier renders to the State that earns the allow-
ance, and it is more or less according to the number of his
children.
The endowment of motherhood by the State has for its object
the bearing of healthy children and their careful nurture. To
attain the first it is essential that the parents should be of healthy
stock. This can only be secured by selection and registration.
To insure careful nurture periodical inspection would be neces-
sary to prevent the endowment being misused. From the eugenic
point of view all but the physically, mentally, and morally sound
should be excluded from the list of parents, though at first
elimination should be confined to those afflicted by congenital
insanity, chronic criminality or drunkenness, and directly or in-
directly transmissible diseases of a serious character. There
would of course be no compulsion of selected parents to marry,
they would merely be certified as fit and thus entitled to the en-
dowment if they did marry. The choice of partners in life would
be just as free as at present, and the registration lists should be


confidential, and only open to a man and woman between whom
marriage is contemplated.
The amount of the endowment should he only sufficient to
provide the absolute necessaries of life for the mother, and also
for each child up to the age of say fifteen, when the amount
should be progressively reduced till its earnings are enough for its
own maintenance. Any lapse into criminality, drunkenness,
neglect of the children, or other evils should entail forfeiture of
the endowment and the removal of the children to the care of the
State. It may be objected that registration would be obnoxious
and cast a slur on those excluded, but it is only an extension of
the regulation openly advocated in Sydney, and already the law
in several of the United States, that a medical certificate of health
should be obtained before marriage. Another objection is that
the unselected would still marry and have children, or that
irregular unions would be encouraged. There is some truth in
this, hut we cannot attain perfection all at once; and any step
forward, that is beneficial to the community as a whole, always
hears hardly on a few. But, as time passes, the unfit would be
gradually eliminated, and the ideal of a healthy people attained.
A still more serious problem is the provision of funds for the
endowment. At a time like the present when all our resources
are needed for the prosecution of the war, and heavy taxation in
the future is inevitable, the economist may say the scheme is im-
practicable. But where there is a will there is a way. We shall
certainly have to produce more wealth to pay the war taxes or
else curtail our luxuries. The loafer, whether of high or low
degree, will be discouraged, and, with a high ideal in view, it is
to be hoped that the extra amount needed for the maintenance
of poor mothers and children in a healthy way will be raised. It
is, of course, a question for the skilled statistician to solve, as to
how much would actually be required.
I venture with much diffidence to suggest that, as the question
is one for the people at large, and that the poorest will reap the
most benefit, the endowment should be raised by an equal poll tax
on every adult, male or female, except selected mothers. This
would mean that every one would have to work enough for
maintenance, and to pay the tax and so encourage industry. If
they failed to do so let the example of Holland be followed, and
send them to a labour colony till they amended their ways. It also
means that the single man or woman would contribute his or her
share to the perpetuation of the race, under good conditions, and
is much better than the suggested tax on bachelors to force them
into matrimony whether fit or unfit.
Another great advantage, that would be attained by the en-
dowment of motherhood, -is the equalization of the chances of
the married and unmarried, and men versus women, in the labour


market, as the married man would be assured of at least a
sufficient maintenance for his family. (Any decent father would
of course endeavour to supplement this to the best of his ability).
Connected with this phase of the question, it is well known
that the dilution of labour in Great Britain is causing serious con-
cern, and re-settlement after the war is one of the most knotty
problems statesmen will have to settle. It is quite certain that,
women having shown their capacity in many avocations hitherto
closed to them, and earning good wages therein, will not give
them up without a struggle, and that may precipitate the most
serious conflict of all, viz., industrial antagonism between the
sexes. This question is very clearly discussed in the March,
1916, issue of the “Round Table Review,” under the heading of
“The Problem of Women in Industry,” and anyone interested in
the question should certainly read it. Unfortunately it offers no
solution and only states the facts,
In conclusion, let me add, that, in reading these notes, I am
presenting, in a very concise form, a solution advocated by many
eugenists, as an opening for the discussion of a very vital ques-
tion. If the endowment of motherhood is found practicable, then
potential mothers should be as fully trained in all the duties of
motherhood and child nurture, as any boy or girl who is learning
a trade or profession ; and, conversely those girls, who are not
selected, should be given equal opportunities with boys to qualify
for industrial, commercial or professional life; and equal pay for
equal work should become the rule. Under existing circum-
stances it does not pay to train girls thoroughly, for most of them
have marriage in view as their final vocation.
The whole subject is one of great difficulty, and, in venturing
to place it before you, I do so in the hope that it may stir up
thought and discussion, and help to form a more enlightened
public opinion than at present exists. Until that is effected no
steps towards realization are possible or even desirable. I may,
however, again quote Ruskin to the effect, “that in a science deal-
ing with so subtle elements as those of human nature, it is only
possible to answer for the final truth of principles, not for the
direct success of plans; and that in the best of these last, what
can be immediately accomplished is always questionable, and what
can be finally accomplished, inconceivable.”
Discussion.
Mrs. Francis Anderson moved that —“The Members of this
Conference .undertake to do all in their power to encourage these
movements which promote the Welfare of Children.”
Dr Arthur: “I have much pleasure in seconding this reso-
lution. I wish to say that the ideal playground for the children


is, where possible, the Sea Beach, and any movement which will
allow the children, not only of the city but of the far back
country to get for a certain time every year to the beach to
enjoy themselves, is one which should receive encouragement
from the State—if possible, to give cheaper train fares so as
to bring mothers and children down from the back country from
the unbearable conditions in summer time, to the sea beaches.
It is also possible to make arrangements for the little ones in
the slums of Sydney to be taken once or twice a week by their
teachers or their guardians, and this is a matter which , will do
very much indeed to promote their well-being and increase their
happiness.”
Mr. Meredith Atkinson: “I must say that nothing in the
nature of Conferences has been more welcome to me, personally,
than this one. I think we are apt to be a little too complacent
about the excellence of Australian conditions, of which we are
often too proud. The question with regard to Infantile Mor-
tality is not what lives are actually saved, but what might be saved.
I have had the advantage of seeing in New Zealand the work
of the Plunkett Homes and system generally, and I must say
that I have not been impressed in any country so much as in
New Zealand, with the almost magnificent possibilities of saving
Infant Life once skill, science and human sympathy are in the
field. . . . So, I would protest most strongly against the idea
that we have any right to be proud of the infant life we save,
so long as it can be said of us that we do not save all we could
save. It happened a few months ago that I actually sketched
a programme of a conference like this for the Workers’ Edu-
cational Association, but Dr. Mary Booth was here before us.
I have come here to-day to welcome the conference, as I believe
it is in the direction of progress more than any other conference
of its kind.
“I regret the absence of a paper dealing specifically with the
economic conditions of the family. ■ Mr. Sulman has given us
a few leading lines of discussion on these conditions, but I
think it would have been better, if I might make a modest
suggestion, to have one paper set aside'for discussion on the
economic conditions of the family in Australia. I think, in
Australia, in regard to family life, we are too apt to assume,
that because Australia is a country which gives big wages, every
family enjoys a big wage. It is true that a large number of
families, even a great percentage of families in Australia do
enjoy big wages (and I speak as one interested in economics),
but I am interested in those families that do not enjoy a big
wage, and for whom something must be done.
“I think it would be well therefore for us to face the problem
of the poor family in Sydney. lam quite sure that in Sydney,
alone —I know from my own experience—l can speak of hun


dreds of families who enjoy an income of less than £2 a week,
on an average all the year around. I have been making some
enquiries lately, and have been appalled at the frequency with
which I have met families in Sydney who, on an average of 52
weeks in the year (the yearly income is the real criterion) have
an income of less than £2 per week. It is impossible to bring
up a family, in these days, on a wage like this. I do say that
this is not a time for complacency and self satisfaction. We
are too fond of quoting Australian conditions —as if they were
perfect. Individual cases do not count. We should not be
satisfied until every child in our city, and in the Commonwealth,
has the same opportunity of a good, decent and human exis-
tence as every other child.
“One other remark: With regard to the two papers we have
had on education this afternoon, Airs. Jackson breathed the
very spirit of the Kindergarten, and I have never been able to
understand why the Government does not give millions to the
Kindergarten. It has always been to me a puzzle that more
money has not been spent on it. I do hope one of the efforts
of this conference will be directed towards seeking an increase
for the Kindergarten. Secondly, Miss Simpson’s paper makes
us feel how far we are from what we ought to be in the matter
of provision for play. It is astonishing that the necessity of
filling the hours of a child’s life from 4 p.m. till 9 p.m. —the
most deadly and dangerous hours a child has to live—is not
realised. It is surely a most extraordinary thing that the State,
at the present moment, does not do more for the children. In
Australia (I think and speak as one whose life and interests are
now centred in Australia), we are distinctly behind Continental
and American countries in regard to playgrounds. The Liver-
pool and Leeds Councils have institutions of the kind described
by Miss Simpson. We are not really in the forefront in regard
to play facilities for the child, and that is one respect in which
we should do a great deal, to urge upon the authorities to pro-
vide for these playgrounds. Lastly, the vexed question of cost.
Ministers express sympathy, and say they cannot find the money.
Now, before the war, I used to sympathise with Ministers in
their endeavours to find money for the various applications for
funds. We now live in days when England can raise £7.000.000
a day for warfare, and I will never again believe a Minister
when he says there is no money forthcoming. We shall never
justify that boast if we are not able to find in this country, at
any rate, many millions for the promotion of conditions which
will elevate the race generally, more particularly the conditions
of Child Welfare.
Resolution carried unanimously.


EVENING SESSION
WEDNESDAY, MAY 23, 1917
Dr. Gordon Craig, President of the British Medical
Association, in the Chair.
ALCOHOL IN CHILDHOOD.
Dr. H. G. Chapman. Sydney University.
The use of alcoholic beverages, ales, wines, and spirits, had
been almost universal in Britain up to the early years of the nine-
teenth century. We learn from the chroniclers of the customs of
the different centuries that no festive gathering lacked these re-
freshments for the spirits. They were considered indispensable
in every meeting or entertainment for joyous recreation. Not
until the nineteenth century had dawned was abstinence from
alcoholic liquors advocated or practised except in certain small
communities.
Alcohol was regarded as a food and as a stimulant to the mind
and body. While the harmful effects of intemperance were
known, the temperate use of drink containing alcohol was not
thought to be injurious in any way.
During the last seventy years sufficient accurate observation
has been carried out to establish clearly that alcohol is to be con-
sidered more as a drug than as a food. It is a medicine To be
prescribed by the doctor for certain symptoms and ailments.
There is still much debate as to whether alcohol can serve as a
food. It appears to be established that a small amount of alco-
hol, two or three tablespoons, well diluted with water, can-replace
the equivalent amount of sugar in the diet of an adult man.
Although alcohol can serve as a food it has been shown that the
body can perform every function completely without its use. No
purpose is served by adding alcohol to the diet. This is especially
the case with the children. The quantity of alcohol that could be
added to the diet of a child without leading to ill-effects is so
small that no good or useful effect can be ascribed to its use.
The child has such zest for food that its meals may be sufficiently
varied without the addition of alcohol to the diet.


Alcohol has the reputation of preventing fatigue and of assist-
ing in warding off the tired feeling that follows work. It has
been proved, time after time, that this is a misconception. The
person who takes the alcohol may feel that work is better done,
but this is not so. Experiments made with compositors, revealed
that the numbgr of errors made in setting up type, were more
numerous when alcohol was given to stimulate the tired workman.
The alcohol diminishes restraint and gives confidence, but it does
not stimulate the muscles and nerve cells to greater activity.
By medical research it has been shown that alcohol in sufficient
concentration is a poison to the cells that compose every tissue of
the body. The amount that is sufficient to produce deleterious
effects varies in the different tissues. The effects of the free use
of alcohol are well known. No tongue could tell and no pen
describe the evil that has resulted from the abuse of alcohol.
Body and soul are both ruined. If children are allowed to par-
take freely of alcohol a certain number of them will develop the
fatal habit of taking too much. Children do not need alcohol.
They do not like alcoholic drinks as a rule. They can readily be
protected from any chance of hindering their moral, mental and
physical growth by abstinence from alcoholic beverages. If they
are permitted to take these beverages, the quantity must be
strictly limited. The growth and development of the organs will
be prevented by comparatively small quantities. Even if no
exaggerated ideas are held as to the noxious and poisonous in-
fluences of alcohol, a contemplation of its actions on ferments, on
secreting cells, on the heart, on the nerve cells, is sufficient to
warn against permitting children to take alcohol.
The effects of drunkenness are so well known that there is no
need to refer to them, but the habitual use of more alcohol than
can be completely burned up in the body gives rise to the chronic
effects of alcoholic poisoning. If too much alcohol is taken then
the poison remains in the blood to influence the whole of the
tissues of the body and especially the nervous structures which
control the rest of the body. In children the amount that can be
oxidized or burnt up is so small that it is wiser to refrain from
giving alcohol at all.
To sum up. Children do not need alcohol. They can enjoy
every happiness without its use. Why should they be exposed to
the danger of becoming addicted to its use?


THE WRECKER OF LIFE: VENEREAL DISEASE.
Professor D. A. Welsh, Sydney University.
GENERAL FACTS.
Technicalities of medicine only bore and bewilder a popular
audience. I hope to arrest your attention and enlist your sym-
pathy by a presentation of fact, which will be none the less truth-
ful because it is expressed in metaphor and illustration.
Other speakers at this conference will give in other figures
some idea of our terrible losses in the warfare against death in
childhood and infancy. I ask you to compare these losses with
the drain on our manhood at the front. My calculations are
based on statistics, quoted by Sir Charles MacKellar, in his open
letter to the Minister for Public Health, dated March 10th, 1917.
Throughout the two and a half years of war, to the end of 1916,
Australia has been losing her best men at the rate of 20 lives each
day. During the same period she has been losing her infants,
under one year, at the rate of 25 a day. Indeed, for the last
twelve years, every hour of every day has struck the death-knell
of an infant. If we extend the figures to include children under
five years of age, we find that we are losing these little lives at
the rate of 35 a day.
That is not all. You must have noted in the military casualty
lists the heartrending toll of the missing. But the medical
casualty lists of infant mortality do not take count of the children
that are missing—of the children that are never born. I believe
that they form a loss to the Commonwealth which is incalculable
in every sense of that word. And so, when we include the un-
born that might have been, the grim total rises to some unknown
figure, which cannot be less than 40, which may be more than 50,
representing the children lost to our small population every day.
Such is Australia’s present effort to make good the losses of her
finest men.
Incredible as it seems, it is a fact that this great wastage of
new life is preventable, and the greater part easily preventable.
The chief causes of the mortality are known microbes, or germs,
whose activities can be controlled. In particular, that attack by
the microbes on the human body, which we term infection, may
be repelled by proper scientific methods. On the other hand,
while prevention is easy, cure is difficult. Our control of the
microbe ceases when it enters the living body. It is not easy to
destroy it there without hurting the more delicate human tissues.
The vast numbers of dead and damaged infants bear witness that
we cannot rely on the curative power of medicine. We must


concentrate on the better course of prevention. We must not
allow the enemy of disease to gain a footing in the tissues and to
become entrenched there. We must fight him in the open before
he can dig himself in.
The microbic invasions of infancy fall into two distinct
groups: (i) Those which attack life after birth; and (2), those
which attack life before birth. The former include such infec-
tions as gastro-enteritis, and tuberculosis; the latter are the
venereal diseases. All may he combated with success, provided
that the campaign is conducted with the strategy and tactics
appropriate to each microbe.
THE HISTORIC QUESTION.
Now we must face the historic question, “If these diseases are
preventable, why are they not prevented?” We shall see that,
strictly speaking, there is no answer, because there is no reason
why they should not be prevented. There is simply the crude
fact that they are not prevented. Take first the fact that every
year thousands of babies are born to Australia, healthy in body,
and sound in mind, free from all germs of disease, only to be
killed within a year by preventable gastro-enteritis. Consider for
a moment that murderous folly.
You have doubtless read of an ancient custom in China of
throwing the unwanted girl babies out to die. How dreadful,
you say. What will you say of another country which badly
needs all its babies, and yet exposes many thousands, boys and
girls indiscriminately, every year to certain death? ' Perhaps you
think of the masses of China as steeped in barbarism. I ask you
to spare a thought for another people steeped in worse than
barbarism—steeped in ignorance and indifference. For the killing
of our children is done deliberately, partly through ignorance, since
one section of the people has not the remotest idea how to feed an
infant, and partly through indifference, since another section
knows that improper feeding will inevitably lead to gastro-
enteritis and death. With all her natural and social advantages,
there is less excuse for Australia than for any other country under
the sun; and, with her vast empty spaces, there is greater reason
that the practice of infanticide should cease.
Concerning tuberculosis in children, I wrote in 1910. “Tuber-
culosis has been practically stamped out in a community by feeding
only with heated milk. True, it was a community of pigs. But
pigs are very like children in their way of taking tuberculosis.
. . . Denmark was the first country to recognize how easily tuber-
culosis of pigs could be controlled by sterilizing the milk with
which they are fed, and, as long ago as 1898, it was made illegal
to distribute unheated milk for feeding purposes, with the result


that tuberculosis in pigs has been' almost suppressed. Other
civilized countries have begun to follow Denmark in the care of
their pigs. Ido not know of any country which shows the same
consideration for its children, although several large cities are
making praiseworthy efforts. It is no exaggeration, however, to
say that more care is taken in Denmark to keep the pigs free from
tubercle, than is taken in this country to keep the children free.”
Is it too much to suggest that an Australian child has a higher
economic value than a Danish pig?
These are typical examples of our constitutional apathy and
lethargy. What is true of gastro-enteritis and tuberculosis,
which kill off thousands of infants healthy at birth, is also true
of the venereal diseases which attack the life unborn. The loss
of life due to venereal disease is appalling, though incalculable; the
greater part, if not the whole, of that loss is preventable; and the
ultimate causes of that loss are ignorance and indifference —the
same enemies of our race in the same firm alliance, with perhaps
another ally added in the form of uncharitableness or intolerence.
Regarded as a medical problem, there is probably none easier
of solution than the eradication of the venereal diseases. They
are microbic contagious diseases, controllable and preventable.
What then stands in the way of prevention? It is the mental
attitude of the people. They make the fundamental error of
confusing disease with immorality. They think that there is only
one big problem, when there are two —the improvement of public
health, and the improvement of public morals. Both are urgent,
but they are distinct, since one is ultimately medical, and the other
ultimately ethical. We can never "hope to achieve a great pur-
pose if we are always confusing it with another great purpose,
whose means of achievement are essentially different. It is our
first duty to appreciate that distinction and that difference. Some
people do not yet realise that they cannot send cavalry to cap-
ture submarines.
This confusion of thought leads to another and a worse
mistake. It leads to the terrible idea that venereal disease is a
just punishment for sin, and that vice would be encouraged if
venereal disease were checked. No progress is possible while
such ideas dominate the mind. It is imperative for all citizens
of this Commonwealth —for all members of our Imperial race—
to apprehend their individual responsibility, and to discharge their
elementary duty towards the innocent sufferers from venereal
disease. For that suffering has been tolerated, nay, has been
aggravated, by those who pride themselves on their ethical
principles and their Christianity—who, nevertheless, follow after
the false gods, prejudice, intolerance, uncharitableness, whenever
the question of combating venereal disease is raised—who cannot
or will not see that venereal disease is the enemy, and not the ally


of all enlightened effort for the suppression of vice. We read
of wasteful methods of living being revised in other lands. It
is more important here that we should revise wasteful methods
of killing—our children. To that end we must revise that mode
of thought which makes that killing possible.
THE VENEREAL DISEASES.
There are only two venereal diseases of importance—syphilis
and gonorrhoea—but they are responsible directly or indirectly
for greater incapacity, greater suffering, and greater loss of life,
actual and potential, than any other two infectious diseases.
Nevertheless, there is no real difference between them and other
infective processes, such as small-pox or epidemic meningitis.
They, too, are caused by microbes invading the body, and they
are transmitted from one person to another only when the
microbes are transmitted. Further, the microbes of syphilis and
of gonorrhoea are among the best known to medical science.
They can be freely handled and examined in the laboratory.
Their ravages have been studied in great detail. Highly technical
and exact methods of diagnosis have been worked out for every
stage of syphilis. In gonorrhoea early recognition is easy, but
later diagnosis is difficult. Syphilis can now be treated with
remarkable success, owing to the discovery of a drug which has
a powerful germicidal action on the microbes within the human
body. Gonorrhoea in its incipient stage may be treated with good
results, but, where prompt and proper measures have not been
carried out, it may prove one of the most intractable of diseases.
(a) Syphilis.
The immediate effects of acquired syphilis are inconsiderable
compared with its later developments. But year after year the
microbe goes on compiling a catalogue of “damaged goods,”
whose ultimate dimensions are most formidable. There is not
an organ or tissue of the body that is not liable to be invaded and
colonised by the microbes. Untreated or improperly treated
cases remain highly infectious for years, and virulent germs may
be transferred to healthy persons through the medium of a cup
or a kiss, or by other innocent intercourse.
Before and after birth inherited syphilis is much more serious
than the acquired form, since the microbe is attacking tissues in
process of development. Hence it is a frequent cause of ante-
natal death. Otherwise the infant is born with the microbe
already planted in its tissues, though it may appear healthy at
birth. Within a few weeks or months, however, the tainted life
begins to disclose the taint, and a veritable chamber of horrors


is revealed. I shall not raise the curtain further than to quote
two sentences from the final report of the Royal Commission on
Venereal Diseases, London, 1916. “The child’s growth is
checked, its vitality depressed, its intelligence stunted.” And
again, “The central nervous system may be gravely affected, lead-
ing to . . . blindness, deafness, meningitis, idiocy, and various
forms of paralysis.”
I speak to a healthy audience whose intelligence and attention
are alert. I have seen as large a gathering of dehumanised
derelicts, many of whom were the wreckage of syphilis, a pitiful
and repulsive spectacle. Between these extremes of perfect
health and utter idiocy there is a great army of the mentally
defective. A proportion, larger in some smaller in others, of
their brain-cells remains undeveloped or permanently damaged.
What chance have these little ones of becoming good citizens?
They are degraded from the race of men. They represent a lower
order of being—and they act accordingly. That physical basis,
which is the first condition of the expression of our intellectuality
and of our spirituality, has been denied them from the start.
That healthy brain, without which we cannot have an able mind
or a high character, was never theirs. To complete the tragedy,
they are condemned to pass on to their children, and to their
children’s children, the same defective brain. Not every case of
mental deficiency is due to syphilis, though syphilis is probably
the most important contributory cause.
The ante-natal damage that may be done by congenital
syphilis is illustrated in the most startling manner by some family
histories quoted by the Royal Commission. “In the case of 34
syphilitic mothers, Dr. Mott found that 175 pregnancies resulted
in only 30 apparently healthy children, leaving 104 premature
births, stillbirths, or deaths in infancy, and 41 seriously diseased
offspring. Of the apparently healthy children it is possible that
some may show the effects of congenital disease later.”
( b ) Gonorrhoea.
Gonorrhoea is at least five times more prevalent than syphilis.
The majority of men infected, however, recover under treatment
without noticeable ill effect. They are blind to the tragedy of the
minority. Hence the infection is too often regarded as an
accident which may be lightly dismissed from tbe mind. But tbe
microbe is not thereby dismissed from tbe body. The surgeon
knows its ravages and the long duration of its infectivity in men.
But only those who have made a special study of the diseases of
women realise the vast damage to womanhood, the cruel fraud
on motherhood, the massacre of the innocents, perpetrated by this
microbe. The unhappy patient of course does not know to what
her illness is due. In most cases even her husband bas no sus


picion, and he would be overwhelmed with remorse if he had.
To do him justice, he never dreamt of danger. It is characteristic
of this insidious disease that the obvious symptoms soon pass off,
while the hidden infection may last for years. So a man may
marry, all unconscious that he is still infested with the germs of
a past disease—all unconscious that the wild oats which he sowed
a few years before are waiting to yield a late crop in the form of
an invalid wife and a desolate home.
The verdict of the Royal Commissioners is unmistakable.
■“The consequences of gonorrhoea in men are grave and far-
reaching. The disease is a frequent cause of sterility, and a
source of the greatest danger to the community at large ... It
is impossible to exaggerate the importance of gonorrhoea in
woman. In the earlier stage it inflicts on her a serious ailment;
subsequently it may cause sterility; and in later years it frequently
leads to conditions which may necessitate grave and difficult
operations, to chronic invalidism, and sometimes to death . . .
Both gonorrhoea and syphilis lead to an enormous annual loss o f
child life.” They add this rider: “In view of the comparatively
small importance with which, until recently, the consequences of
gonorrhoea have commonly been regarded, it is our duty to
emphasise that the evidence given before us seems to establish that
gonorrhoea, until it has been effectively treated, should be con-
sidered a hindrance to marriage ... As regards syphilis, the
importance of preventing the marriage of any person who is in
an infectious state is far more generally appreciated.”
From these facts it would appear that, compared with syphilis,
gonorrhoea is not less destructive, though it is more merciful, to
the children. They are less often born diseased; they are more
often not born at all. It does not kill. When the microbe of
gonorrhoea has completed its work there is nothing left to kill,
and there never will be anything to kill. The last hope of mother-
hood has been destroyed.
It is true that the venereal diseases are the outstanding cause
of children never being born, of children being killed before they
are born, and of children being born diseased. Yet I must warn
you that they are not the only cause of any of these events, and
you will do a grave injustice to many innocent persons if you do
not recognise that fact.
THE MENACE AND THE COUNTERSTROKE.
It is just 60 years ago since the good ship Dunbar was
wrecked off the South Head in a wild southerly gale, and of the
120 lives on board only one was saved. That dramatic wreck
has made a deep and lasting impression on Australian history.
Try to realise that immigrant ships laden with human souls come


daily to our shores, that oftener than twice a week a Dunbar is
wrecked, and that all her human freight is under 5 years old.
Imagine the sensation in Australia if submarines were
operating off the coast and sinking 40 or 50 lives a day. With
all the earnestness at my command I entreat you to realise that
submarines are there now. The natural dangers of the landing
may destroy a few immigrants, but that loss is nothing compared
with the preventable loss by shipwreck at sea. For our sea
routes are infested by the submarines of venereal disease, which
destroy our best immigrants with every refinement of frightful-
ness. Some ships are sunk within sight of land, others, as I have
explained, never appear above the horizon.
Such is the menace to our race. The counter-stroke cannot
be delivered by medical men alone, nor by Government alone;
it must be delivered by the people. The Government is but the
servant of the people, and the people get the government they
deserve. Not until our people all the world over are roused to a
sense of their peril and their responsibility can the great work of
saving our children hope to succeed. The problem is complex.
Social, administrative, and medical factors enter into its solution.
To create and foster an enlightened public opinion is the main ob-
ject of tiffs conference. The people are responsible for a tact-
ful and intelligent administration of the public health by the
Governments of Australia. Scientific guidance is waiting, for no
profession is more willing to sacrifice its convenience or less will-
ing to sacrifice its high ideals than that of medicine.
The secret of the successful counter-stroke is co-operation—
sympathetic, wise, courageous. Just as Mr. Lloyd George is
urging, in words that convey both warning and encouragement,
that another submarine menace is futile if everyone does his bit
and behaves like a reasonable being, so all must combine to de-
feat the enemy of our race —venereal disease. We must recog-
nise that we are not all equally useful in the emergency of war.
But that should make those of us who are least useful only the
more anxious to do our best. We might at least sink all prejudice
and indifference, and save such commonsense and initiative as we
can for the advancement of our race.
At this crisis of an Empire’s fate two citizens have done most
for their country —one is the good soldier—the other is the good
mother. We honour both, and we honour ourselves when we
help both. For one fights to preserve a grand inheritance for
our children, and the other works to preserve our children for
that grand inheritance.
At the request of Sir Charles Mackellar, his paper on “Mental
Deficiency,” &c., &c., has been omitted to allow of its incorpora-
tion in a larger treatise.


Discussion.
Dr. F. G. N. Stephens said; “My remarks apply specially
to Syphilis. The Medical Profession has worked very hard for
compulsory notification of and for suitable education concern-
ing Syphilis. They have worked in vain. In the Out-Patient
Department of the Renwick Hospital are seen cases of congeni-
Syphilis; frequently the same parents, in the following years,
bring along more children suffering from the complaint, and we
feel that, when we see a case of Hereditary Syphilis, steps
should be taken in order that the parents may be treated for this
disease; they should be made responsible to the community for
becoming free of it. But we must go further back in the matter,
for many a girl gets married to a man who has the seeds of
Syphilis in his system and vice versa. People, who are going
to be married, should be told that there are simple tests whereby
they may ensure that their life partners will not cause their
children to be Syphilitic, and they should know how to set about
getting the tests done.
“Again people, who are promiscuously immoral in their
sexual habits (and these people, spreading venereal diseases
broadcast, are a great infliction on the community), should, for
the good of that community, be prevented from getting such
diseases. We cannot prevent them from ‘sowing wild oats,’
but there should, in centres such as Sydney, be means (easy of
access) for them to find out how to prevent themselves from
catching these diseases if possible.”
Lady (name not known): “The last speaker thought that
means should be made public whereby people should know how
to prevent Syphilis being caught. I understand there is a
prophylactic tent (military) that it has been instituted by the
Department. Is it not for that means? If so, is it for better
or worse in regard to this disease?”
Professor Welsh : “I am not able to answer the question
that was put, but I should like to say this: Venereal disease
amongst our soldiers is a very serious thing indeed. It keeps
a man from being an effective soldier. The man very often
contracts it under circumstances for which he is not altogether
responsible. If there is not a prophylactic tent in every camp
in the Commonwealth, I should be very sorry indeed. I think a
prophylactic tent should be established—l have no official know-
ledge of it being established —but I believe it is in most of the
best regulated camps I think the establishment of such a tent
is not detrimental to the morals of our soldiers. The question
of morals must come afterwards. The prophylactic tent has its
place in the prevention of diseases amongst our soldiers, and it
has a most important place in that respect.”


Dr. Worrall: “The evil is so great and men like myself
who have dealt with children all their lives know that Child
Life is going to be the saving of the nation, and the greatest
asset of the population is good health. I return thanks to Pro-
fessor Welsh for the cultured manner in which he dealt with an
unpleasant subject. We would not allow a leper to parade our
streets and be a danger to our community, and, therefore I can
see no reason why we should allow a syphilitic. When you
think that during the last 20 years, or thereabouts, a large
number of children have died under one year of age, it is not
barbarism—it is worse than barbarism—it is crass ignorance,
plus barbarism, that child life should be sacrificed when the
Commonwealth needs population.
“There is evidence that the State Government is not really
in earnest about the prevention of venereal disease. If it were,
there would be no hesitancy about granting the Sydney Hos-
pital space for a venereal clinic, by giving to the Hospital the
35 feet at the rear of the Hospital up to the pathway, and by
providing for the nurses on the Richmond Terrace site, thus
setting free the present nurses’ quarters as indoor accommo-
dation for the complications of venereal diseases. The present
Sydney Hospital Venereal Clinic, owing to deficient and un-
suitable accommodation is a farce and a danger.”
Dr. Worrall had no doubt that insanity and feeble minded-
ness and epilepsy were on the rapid increase. No insane person
should be discharged from Hospital, no feeble-minded person
should be allowed to be at large without being sterilised, so
rendering it impossible that they could reproduce their kind.
Sterilisation can now be accomplished without appreciable
danger.
Dr. Stopford; “We are all agreed that the use of alcohol,
during the growth of the organism, must be in the highest
degree injurious. Tobacco, tea and coffee are also injurious to
the growing organism.
“We cannot hope to accomplish much without the earnest
co-operation of the Government It seems the Government is
not sincere in this matter. As evidence of that, chemists, who
are totally unqualified to treat these diseases are allowed to do
so all over the Metropolis; the result is, unfortunately, that
irreparable injury is done, and cases that might easily be cured,
are allowed to get in such a state as to make curing impossible.”
Dr. Arthur: “It seems to me that the order in which these
3 papers have come, follows to a very considerable extent the
sequence of Cause and Effect. The first paper dealt with Alcohol,
the second with Venereal Disease, and the third with Mental
Deficiency. I think we can claim that a great deal of venereal


Disease is a direct result of Alcohol. We can go further and
claim that Mental Deficiency is the result of Venereal Disease.
“The Medical authorities after investigations of a number of
cases, stated 60 per cent, of the children who were Mentally
Deficient responded to the syphilitic test.
“We all know that the most potent cause of rousing the
sexual passion is Alcohol.
“If you wish to get to the root of these conditions, you must
strike at the Drink Traffic. I should like Professor Welsh to
elaborate a little more fully the prejudices which according to
him have to be swept away. If you are going to seek by so-called
preventative methods to guard the male from the dangers of
Venereal Disease, then you must allow the same protection to
the female. I certainly think that what the women of this
community should clamour for is a Medical Certificate before
marriage. The Government should pass legislation on this
subject..
"I said at the Presbyterian Assembly the other day that
Ministers should take upon themselves tlie responsibility of
refusing to marry people unless a Medical Certificate is pro-
duced. The Government is remiss in this matter. They have
got to provide hospital accommodation in a very much larger
way, and find very much larger sums of money if they are
going to grapple with diseases that lower the whole of the
physical conditions of the race.”
Mr. F. G. Adrian (Newcastle Magistrate) : “I am struck
with the suggestions in regard to the treatment of Mentally
Defective Children, but there is a very much larger scope to
which these remarks might be applied.
“There is no doubt that a considerable proportion of our
criminals are simply suffering from Mental Diseases, In a
great many cases that there are now before the Court as crimes,
the people who are now considered as criminals should be segre-
gated and treated simply as Mental Defectives, and not as
criminals.
“I think there is a germ of truth in the Habitual Criminals’.
Act, though it is a very clumsy and awkward way of dealing
with many sorts of crimes. For instance, in regard to sexual
criminally—it is perfectly absurd to apply the provisions of the
Habitual Criminals’ Act. We have a crime so peculiar in its
manifestations, yet a criminal in this way is allowed to be let
loose upon society until he qualifies as an Habitual Criminal. It
necessitates a certain number of convictions before it can be
said, or before the Judge can state, that he has become an
Habitual Criminal, but the sum of his convictions is by no means


the measure of his offences. A person in this way is let loose
on society and becomes the parent of children, and, in the next
generation, produces many of the mental degenerates to whom
Dr. Mackellar has referred.
“This subject should receive a great deal of consideration
by Magistrates in Children’s Courts. Of course, in regard to
children, many of the offences are due to immaturity and bad
environment. Their criminal tendencies are often the result of
immaturity, and, by the time they reach maturity—they may if
their conditions are improved—become reputable citizens.
Wherever a criminal tendency shows in that direction, I think
they should be kept under proper supervision and observation,
and given careful attention until they reach the age of maturity,
when flie authorities will probably be able to see what has been
due to mental immaturity, and what is due to a constitutional
taint or defect.
“I think a great deal of the work now done in the Courts
of Justice, really are cases for medical attention and for mental
specialists.”
Professor Welsh : “The points that have been raised are
questions of detail. lam with all the speakers in the main issue.
Perhaps I differ a little in the details, and in the way the main
issue is to be carried out.”
Dr. Guy Griffiths; Resolution proposed—“ That this Con-
ference urges the Government to take immediate steps to check
the wastage of Infant Life from Venereal Disease.”
Resolution seconded and carried.
Dr. Mary Booth ; “Moved that this Conference urges the
Government to introduce legislation to enable the community to
control the feeble-minded effectively and humanely.”
“It is surprising that N.S.W. has done so little for the
feeble-minded. The subject was discussed at the Medical Con-
gress in Sydney in 1913, as mentioned by Sir Charles Mac-
kellar in his paper, and received considerable attention. The
Congress appointed a committee of experts —of which I was
honorary secretary —to make a census of the feeble-minded of
the Commonwealth, and to inaugurate a popular campaign to
educate the public in the problem.
“I rate the capability of the teachers to make the first rough
sorting of children —according to mental capacity, more highly
than do Sir Charles, and the majority’of my colleagues in
the Final Report. I cannot see how an investigation could be
carried out on a larger scale without them. Further, the mod-
ern teacher has a fair knowledge of Psychology and of Hygiene,
and by his daily contact with a child has a good opportunity


of gauging his powers. Further, the report referred to had
the value which belongs to every earnestly thought out scien-
tific scheme, vis., the pointing out of certain cul-de-sac, and
suggesting certain improved methods, e.g., the need for especially
interesting the teacher, and also the doctor in the public
health aspect of the question.”
Str Charles Mackellar : “I have very much pleasure in
seconding that resolution. I am not at one with Dr. Mary
Booth in her estimation of the capacity of teachers to deal with
this subject. Their opinion is of some value, but without some
special education it is impossible that a correct estimate could
be made by anyone whether a Doctor or Teacher.
“As to the passing of legislation in this matter, I am en-
tirely in accord. At a Parliamentary Select Committee a short
time ago, during the regime of the late Government, I was a
witness, and I was a member of the committee also. A member
of the Government who was at the head of the Education De-
partment at that time (Air. Griffiths) promised that he would
bring in legislation dealing with this subject —at any rate, so far
as it concerned the children of the State—but he made it a con-
dition that if a Board of Management were formed I should be
the Chairman. (I have: reached the time of life when it is not
convenient for me to take on any fresh duties). However, if the
passing of legislation hinges upon my taking the Chairmanship
of the Board, I would even take the Chairmanship.
Resolution carried.


EMPIRE DAY
THURSDAY, MAY 24, 1917
AFTERNOON SESSION
Mrs. Francis Anderson in the Chair.
Mrs. Francis Anderson (Chairwoman) : “The work we
have been doing in the past, and the work we have to do in the
future, is really just as much connected with Empire, and just
as important for our Nation as the work our men are doing at
the front. It is very little use for our sons to fight for the
Empire if, when they have fought and won, the Empire should
be found to be dying slowly, and this is what is happening. We
are slowly going down, and we must go down unless we do
something to stem the tide of disease that is eating at our vitals.
“This Conference, on Empire Day, asks you to do something;
not to sit down helplessly. Have you ever thought that we arc
a most apathetic and ease-loving people for the most part ? We
sit still and listen and say ‘Very Good’, to each other. I think
this Conference will be barren of result unless we do something
more than talk to each other; because some of us have been
talking for years, and we have done little. For every institution
which we have in the city to save the lives of our children, we
should have in the same place, four or five or even ten, and we
have not got them. I do not think you will get anything by
simply petitioning the Government and the Municipal Councils
What we want is active and strenuous work, and I think that
this Conference will simply be useless unless you do something
afterwards. The Government will do nothing unless we have
a big majority behind us, and are determined that we will have
reform in this matter; not only in the matter of Kindergarten
and playgrounds (after all, the child might live without the
Kipdergarten and playgrounds), but it will not live unless we
do something for the disease which saps the foundation of
motherhood, and makes the child an invalid for life.
“If our men are fighting the enemy outside, we shall have
to fight a more insidious enemy inside. There will be no little
Belgium to break the attack, and every woman has to think of
it. It will not do for us to sit down and say T have no time;
the Government must do it.’ We must do it ourselves. I hope,
after these papers are read (and I am sure they will be very
interesting papers —yesterday’s were), they will lead you all to
think, not simply to go away and say ‘very good; it is dreadful;
it is shocking; something ought to be done!’ but that ‘something
shall be done, and I’ll do it.’ ”


LEGISLATION WITH REGARD TO MILK.
MISS ISLA BLOMFIELD, MUNICIPAL HEATH VISITOR.
Probably the first official action with regard to milk, from a
public health point of view, was taken in America early in the last
century. This was due to that fatal affection known as milk
sickness. And in Tennessee a law was passed “to prevent
animals from eating an unknown vegetable, thereby imparting to
their milk and flesh, qualities highly deleterious.” When the
country became cleared and settled the disease largely disap-
peared. Many years passed without further legislation until
skimming and diluting became so notorious as to give rise to
additional laws in 1856. The primary object was to prevent
fraud, and they were thus almost wholly of economic import.
Prior to 1880 there is little evidence, however, of any great
activity on the part of states and municipalities to control milk
supplies.
About this time the increase of infant mortality in large cities
was attracting the attention of the health authorities, and it was
found that milk in addition to causing disease by reason of un-
wholesomeness and impoverishment was a carrier of disease. In
1857, in Scotland, Taylor had observed an outbreak of typhoid
fever, and traced the infection to milk. Similar observations
were repeatedly made in Great Britain, Hert having collected
reports of no less than 43 such outbreaks. In 1882 like observa-
tions were recorded in the United States, and they multiplied
until there could be no doubt that a new problem in milk control
had arisen, and that the economic aspects in milk production were
becoming overshadowed by its public health aspect. The next
legislation with regard to milk aimed at preventing the trans-
portation and sale of milk being contaminated by any sick person
with communicable disease. The practical application of
bacteriology in the study of milk, and the discovery of tubercle
bacillus led to the investigation of tuberculosis among cattle, and
in 1895, in the district of Columbia and Minnesota, authority
was granted to local health authorities to protect their milk
supply by means of control of herds, inspection and licensing of
dairies by the health officer of the district.
In New South Wales the milk supply is regulated and con-
trolled by the Dairy Act of 1901, and further safe-guarded as
far as laws and regulations can safe-guard anything by the Pure
Food Act of 1908. These Acts are administered by the Board
of Health and the local authority of the different districts in
which the dairies are situated. The Dairy Act regulates the in-
spection of stock, the sanitation of dairies, the health of cows
owned by dairymen, the health of employees and their cleanliness
of person and clothing, the cleanliness of utensils used for milk.


and cleanliness of the hand of the milker. Certain diseases, both
in men and animals are notifiable under the Dairy Act, and under
the pure food regulations it is an offence to sell milk from cows
suffering from disease.
Thousands of samples of milk from dairies in all parts of the
country are tested by the Board of Health yearly. Any use of
preservatives is illegal. All dairymen, as well as milk vendors,
must comply with the regulations set forth in the Dairy Act, and
unless these regulations are complied with, are liable to have
their licenses cancelled. Over 1,000 milk vendors are inspected
annually by the City Council.
Milk enters largely into the diet of human beings from infancy
to old age, and possesses a high food value. According to Rose-
man, one pint of milk is equal to eight eggs; but it is also the most
easily contaminated of all foods. For this reason no matter what
laws and regulations are made with regard to milk, it would be
impossible to protect it, when brought from a long distance,
sufficiently to render it a suitable food for infants. Most people
have an idea that sterilization or pasteurization will overcome the
evil. The greatest mistake is, I suppose, that milk may be heated
after it has travelled or stood for 12 hours. Sterilization does
not purify a dirty milk. You may kill the bacteria, but not the
toxins that they have produced. Any milk heated enough to kill
germs destroys the lactic acid. To quote Dr. Ralf Vincent, a
well-known specialist in infant feeding; “The use of preservatives
is to be strictly condemned for the same reasons as the boiling
of milk. These preservatives inhibit the action of the delicate
lactic organisms, and thus encourage the growths of the putre-
factive bacteria. Milk treated with preservatives putrifies, as
does boiled milk. Milk for infants should be so far from con-
tamination that it may be given raw, and investigations made by
different authorities show that children fed on pure milk suffer
less from epidemic diarrhoea than in other artificial ways.”
In respect to treatment of milk after milking, the Danes recog-
nize that the destruction and inhibition bacterial activity in milk
is the basis of all successful dairying. They recognise the multi-
tudinous opportunities which milk has of becoming polluted from
the time it leaves the udder of the cow to the time it reaches the
consumers’ mouths. Bacteria which have gained access to milk
will multiply at an enormous rate. In consequence the Danes
adopt three simple rules: —
(1) Prevent organisms gaining access by cleanly methods of
dairying.
(2) Strain thoroughly.
(3) Inhibit, by refrigeration, the growths of such organisms
as may have gained access to the milk.
Clean milking.
Careful straining.
Cooling.


CERTIFIED MILK, 1889-1890.
In America two notable movements were started through
private initiative, 1889-1890. The first by Koplik, having for its
object the control and distribution of milk to infants of the poor,
and the second by Coit, for the production of clean or certified
milk for clinical purposes, under the control of a medical milk
commission. The movement was shortly followed in England,
Dr. Ralf Vincent being one of its chief supporters. In America
for purposes of supervision the best classification of milk is
generally accepted to be: —
(a) Certified.
(b) Inspected.
(c) Pasteurized.
( d ) Cooking.
The methods and standards under which certified milk is pro-
duced and distributed represent the ideals of dairy hygiene. Both
certified.and inspected milk are properly the produce of tuberculin
tested cows.
Certified milk is milk of a prescribed standard certified by the
Commission. Certain conditions were formulated by the Com-
mission which had to be complied with by the farmer. The main
condition required was a bacterial standard of not more than
10,000 per c.c. when delivered to the consumer, the milk to be
obtained from tuberculin tested cows, with due precautions in
regard to the possible infection either by disease in the cows or in
the employees on the farm; the premises were subjected to fre-
quent inspection by officers employed by the Commission, and the
milk was examined not less than once a week for bacteria, and
for chemical composition.
Numerous precautions must be adopted in order to have a
milk of not more than 10,000 c.c. when delivered to customers.
Among other things, the cows must be groomed like racehorses,
and the cleanliness to be observed in handling the milk resembles
more nearly surgical cleanliness than the cleanliness of an
ordinary dairy.
MILK DEPOTS FOR INFANTS.
Infants milk depots are of French origin and are conducted
on a philanthropic basis. They supply food to weakly mothers
who suckle their babies, pure milk to those babies whose mothers
are unable to suckle them, and serve as training schools for future
mothers, who take a voluntary share in the management. In
1893 a somewhat similar movement was started in New York for
the sale of certified milk for children under five years, and the de-
livery in bottles to about 14 milk depots; this milk is pasteurized


for 20 minutes at about 167 degrees F., and it is claimed that this
milk has been an important element in the reduction of the
number of deaths among infants.
The first Infants’ Depot in England was opened in 1899 at
St. Helens, in Lancashire. Since then depots have been estab-
lished in many other places in England. The milk supply in
connection with the Infants’ Hospital, at Hampstead, is produced
under ideal conditions. Dr. Newman in his work on “Infant
Mortality,” takes as a model the Finsbury Infant Milk Depot: —
“The work of this depot was undertaken by a voluntary com-
mittee of medical men. The whole of the funds were subscribed
by a few friends of the enterprise. The principles by which the
medical committee wished to be guided were; —
“(a) Absolute control of the milk and the avoidance of the
serious fallacy of sterilizing unclean milk.
“(b) Medical supervision of the entire management of the
depot.
“(c) A discriminating and careful distribution of the milk
only to infants who could not be breast fed.
“(d) The systematic study of the effect of the milk on the
children.
“It is not a milk shop where anyone can obtain milk, and care
is taken in no way to interfere with the ordinary milk trade
carried on in the borough. It is a specialized milk supply, for
special circumstances which cannot be met by the trade.”
Certified milk depots have been tried in both Queensland and
Sydney. Lady Chelmsford was instrumental in establishing one
in Brisbane, and the late Sir James Graham, here. But both
failed on account of the difficulty of supplying milk in bottles at
market price.
But no matter what expensive or elaborate system is under-
taken for the production of a pure milk supply, we have the con-
tamination in the home, which no inspector can prevent; we can
only depend on the education of the mother and her power of
assimilating that education.
It is because of this contamination in the home that all those
who are interested in infant welfare urge natural feeding, as
mother’s milk is the only kind of milk which is free from con-
tamination. This encouragement of natural feeding is the chief
aim of the nurses in charge of the Baby Clinic, and they often
find that the inability to breast feed is caused by want of nourish-
ment on the part of the mother.


Women complain that at the present price of milk they cannot
afford to take sufficient milk food. When there is any difficulty
in making ends meet, a woman’s first idea of economy is to cut
down her own food. It is very little use in telling a mother to
feed herself on milk food. She is short of money. I hope that
the time is not far distant when there will be an Infants’ Milk
Depot run in connection with the Baby Clinics; but at present we
want a pure milk supply subsidised by the Government, where
nursing mothers may obtain sufficient milk to enable them to feed
their infants. Tickets could be issued to the Clinics and when it
was found that a mother was not feeding herself sufficiently to
enable her to nurse her baby, she could be given a ticket and pay
2ch. 3d., or 4d. per quart, according to what she could afford,
and the difference be made up to the dairyman.
A great deal of condensed milk is used in the poorer homes,
and it is probably due to the want of sufficient fresh milk that one
notices children who have been fine babies appear to fail and look
weedy at about two years or eighteen months.
One of the most important tests of pure milk is the time of
curdling at a given temperature, and the character of the curd
formation. A dirty milk will curdle in 30 hours or less, at a tem-
perature of 190 c., the curd being gas blown. Clean milk will not
curdle under 48 hours. A really pure milk should not curdle
under 72 hours, the curd being smooth.
At present, somewhere about 200 gallons of milk are thrown
away at the sale yard weekly. The cows are inspected, only
healthy ones being sold. This milk might be milked under cleanly
conditions and chilled immediately. The sale yards are close to
the freezing works, and pure milk chilled immediately will keep
for days. This, of course, would not be used as a food for
infants, but for cooking or for adults it might be sold cheaply to
those who could not afford milk at the ordinary price.
A milk depot on the lines of the one at Finsbury, of course,
would not pay; but when anything affects public health, we do
not say, is it a paying proposition, but how will it affect the com-
munity generally ? And we must face the fact that we are not
only engaged in war with Germany now, but she is already pre-
paring for the future, by feeding her nursing mothers, and caring
for the infants in spite of the reported shortage of food. And
we have to remember that the country which takes care of its
mothers is building up it£ manhood and enabling them to defend
their country against whatever enemies may assail them in the
future.


INFANCY AND THE LAW.
H. L. MAXTED,
Chief Inspector, State Children’s Department.
Some of the most important purposes for which the Children’s
Protection Act, the Infants’ Protection Act, the State Children’s
Relief Act, and the Neglected Children and Juvenile Offenders’
Act were introduced, remain unfulfilled. These purposes are
directly connected with the question of infantile mortality.
Take, for example, the question of the adoption of children.
The State Children’s Relief Act empowers the adoption of
State children by and with the consent of the State Children
Relief Board. Certain statutory forms are prescribed by law, but
as the wording of them suggests the possibility of interference
or intervention by the Board, under certain conditions, the
majority of persons who adopt children prefer to do so inde-
pendently. Thus, children can be, and are, commonly adopted
from private institutions and from private individuals without
reference to the Board which has no knowledge whatever of the
matter for which they are regarded as responsible. Moreover,
it has no jurisdiction whatever over the private institution, which
arranges the adoption in respect to such matters. These
adoptions are not uncommonly arranged through the Press, and,
in this respect, too, the Board is powerless to interfere.
The State Children Relief Act, which was originally passed in
1881, was intended chiefly to regulate the boarding-out of children
to private families, and the adoption of children was theoretically
confined to those particular children who happened to be boarded
out; no legal provision for the adoption of other than State
children by private individuals was made, apparently, until 1892,
when the Children’s Protection Act became law, brought about
by the exposure of scandalous baby-farming cases. This pro-
vision was incomplete. Even now, any woman can take any
infant to care for, if she alleges that she receives no payment
for its support . . . and it is a most difficult thing to prove pay-
ment. If she does receive payment, she is compelled to register
under the Children’s Protection Act, and supervision is then
exercised by the Board’s officers, but her fitness to act as cus-
todian is not questioned by the law, and no action can be taken
by the Department against her until she has neglected or ill-
treated the child, when intervention is usually futile.


Moreover, institutions of a private character are declared
immune from the provisions of the Act, and such institutions are
the main source on which such adoptions take place. Again, if
a child is taken by a private person for payment, and ill-treated
or neglected, the person so ill-treating or neglecting the child is
not liable to punishment under the Act unless it can be proved on
medical testimony that such neglect or ill-treatment “has resulted,
or is likely to result, in serious or permanent injury to the child.”
The Children’s Protection Act has been amended from time
to time, and finally, in 1902, the Consolidation Commission des-
cribed the Children’s Protection Act as “the worst drawn Act in
the Statute Book.” As much as possible has been done to give
the section sense. That opinion was expressed in 1902, and so
matters stand to-day, except that the position has been intensified
by the introduction of a measure known as the Private Hospitals
Act of 1908, and its interaction on the Children’s Protection Act.
The Children’s Protection Act attempted to regulate the con-
ditions under which children are born in lying-in homes. The
lying-in home keeper was defined as a person who took two or
more cases for confinement into her home, either at the same time
or within a period of two months; certain provisions were laid
down by regulation or by the main sections of the Act with the
object of safeguarding the mortality of infants; for example, the
District Registrar was expected to furnish the chief officer with a
list of illegitimate children; lying-in home keepers were bound,
under a heavy penalty, to supply the chief officer, on a supplied
schedule, with certain information relating to each patient and to
each child; the lying-in home keeper was also forbidden to allow
a woman to leave the home without her child, and, if the adoption
of children were arranged, full particulars of such adoption were
to be available. This Act, which stipulated so much in regard to
the child, stipulated nothing in regard to the character and
capacity of the lying-in home keeper, and did not do so until the
Royal Commission elicited that babies were being born in inferior
structures in which confinement cases were treated contempo-
raneously with typhoid cases under most insanitary conditions.
To remedy this, the Private Hospitals Act was introduced, and
it regulates the character and capacity of the lying-in home keeper
as well as the structural fitness of her home. To this extent its
operations have been admirable, but it in no way deals with the
supervision of children born in these places, and the question of
adjusting this matter is one of the first importance in the interests
of infant welfare. Children are born in these homes after the
mothers have worked, for some months prior to confinement, in
laborious occupations—right up to the eve of confinement —practi-
cally for their keep. In a few days after confinement the women
are at work again; found some makeshift employment elsewhere,
or else simply turned adrift. These private establishments are,


so far as these matters are concerned, absolutely independent of
all legal control, and occasionally they run in series: —
(1) The employment of the mother.
(2) The birth of the child.
(3) The separation of the child from the mother within a few
days, or the repudiation of further responsibility by
the discharge of mother and child.
(4) The retention of the child in a Babies’ Home, pro-
viding the mother can obtain a maintenance order for
the child, and give the institution a permanent
authority to receive the money.
(5) The subsequent disposal of the child by adoption, not-
withstanding that the maintenance order continues to
be paid to the institution for the benefit of the child
who is not there. There is no control over either the
adoption or the payment of the maintenance.
(6) Retention in a private institution up to the age of 12,
14 and 16 years.
(7) Apprenticeship at 12, 13 or 14 years for 2, 3 or 4 years,
under a system of indenture arbitrarily prescribed by
the institution’s authority, and having no legal
sanction under which payment of wages is made to
the institution ostensibly on behalf of the child, but
when the child comes of age to receive payment, he is
informed by the institution authorities that he, the
child, is expected to pay from his accrued earnings
towards the cost of his-maintenance in the institution
of which he was, in his earlier years, an inmate.
The fnortality of children in private institutions became so
heavy that in 1904 the Hon. Sir Charles Mackellar secured the
passage of the Infants’ Protection Act. This Act regulates the
conditions of child welfare up to 7 years of age within institutions
of a private character “established for the care and treatment of
two or more children.” In order to assist mothers, or expectant
mothers, this Act also essays to obtain for them preliminary ex-
penses and maintenace orders from the men by whom they have
been victimised. In this latter respect, however, the Act has been
a failure because it insists that proceedings must be accompanied
by material corroboration, and this, in a large majority of
instances, is not procurable. Proceedings, moreover, according
to the Act, held in the Children’s Court, the adjudicating officer
being a special magistrate. Privacy in such proceedings is re-
garded as being an essential. The idea was that a girl should be
able to seek and obtain redress under conditions which would
preclude publicity, and thus be encouraged in her effort to keep


her child with her and foster the spirit of mother-love, rather than
being abandoned (and in despair, without means or employment,
she might be induced to the crime of infanticide). This aspect
of the Act has not been fully realised, because in the average
country town everybody knows everybody else’s business, and, in
the larger country towns, as well as in the metropolitan area, the
concentration of work in a common centre does not conduce to
privacy. Girls and women of various type necessarily commingle
and discuss matters of common interest and experience, with fre-
quently a demoralising effect to each other and to the child.
Moreover, the very use of the term “court” in connection with the
relief sought is quite sufficient, in many cases, to deter girls from
venturing to take advantage there. The presence of a trained
woman at the court to assist these girls in their efforts to obtain
relief is not particularly effective under existing conditions.
A further attempt to amend the condition of affairs as regards
children was made in the Neglected Children and Juvenile
Offenders’ Act of 1905. This Act established Children’s Courts,
and insisted on the element of privacy. A very comprehensive
list of definitions of neglect is part of the Act, but an extra-
ordinary feature is the exclusion of infants from its benefits until
they have reached five years. “Child” is defined as boy or girl
over five and under 16 years of age.
One other law which has a more or less direct bearing upon
infantile mortality is an amendment of the Crimes Act, known as
the Girls’ Protection Act. This measure protects girls up to the
age of 16 years, and the number of girl mothers in this State
shows the necessity for such a measure. Mr. J. B. Trivett,
Director of the Bureau of Statistics of this State for 1914, points
out that in 23 years, out of a total of 58,944, there were 2,614 girl
mothers up to the age of 16 years, the ages being: 11 years, 1;
12 years, 2; 13 years, 34; 14 years, 156; 15 years, 644; 16 years,
1,777; total, 2,614; 4 P er cent, of the total illegitimate children
born. In 1914 in this State 2,778 illegitimate children were born,
or slightly over 5 per cent, of the total children registered during
the year. A large number of these girls are confined in private
maternity establishments, under conditions most commonly outside
the jurisdiction of this Department, and when it is realised that
the death-rate of illegitimate children is nearly three times that of
legitimate children, the necessity for stringent supervision of ille-
gitimate children is obvious.


OUR SOCIAL HABITS AS THEY AFFECT CHILD
WELFARE.
MRS, F. WHITE,
State Children’s Dept.
It is as a practical woman whose work during the past twenty-
five years has been among the poorer people, chiefly, that I have
been asked to address you.
I wish first to point out the peculiarly limited ideas some
people have with regard to our “Win the War Economy.”
Among the poor widows whom I have to visit, there are some
whose experiences I am sure most of you would b'e keenly
interested in.
These women all have young children. They are helped by
the Government to the extent of supplementing what they can
earn by such an amount as will make the total sufficient to main-
tain them and their families. They are, however, expected to
earn as much as they can.
One woman has until recently earned 18s. weekly, by doing
three whole days washing and ironing at 6s. per day. In a
family for whom she worked there were three young daughters
and two sons and the parents. They entertained a good deal.
To give you an idea of the wash, there were generally five table-
cloths and numerous serviettes, and, sometimes, as many as
eighteen slipbodices. Of course there was always in addition
the usual household linen. This widow went early, and returned
late to cook her children’s dinner and get them off to bed. At
that house she did all the washing and nearly all the ironing.
The daughters of the house used to help with the ironing.
Lately this family decided to help “win the war.” They told
the poor laundress that “as the young ladies now had to go to
work at Red Cross and other depots, they would no longer be
able to assist her, and she must therefore do the washing and
complete all the ironing or they must get someone else ”
Another case was one where a rich woman announced to her
laundress that “as she had to give to so many of the War
Charities, she had decided to only have her washing done once
a fortnight in future instead of weekly.” She thereby reduced
the woman’s wages from 6s. weekly to 6s. per fortnight, although
the washing was exactly double the weekly amount. This was
that lady’s idea of economy.
Many of these poor women, upon whose strength the future
of young Australians depends, are expected to arrive at a house
at 7.30 a.m. for half day’s work for which they are paid 3s. 6d.


If they are finished before twelve o’clock noon, even if only a
few minutes, some small duty is found for them to fill in that time.
The only nourishment offered to them is a cup of tea —“not even
a pot” these women tell me—but a cup, poured out, accompanied
by thin bread and butter; no breakfast, no eleven o’clock tea,
and no luncheon. • .
The next thing I must touch upon is in reference to the way
in which pregnant women are overworked in Maternity Hospitals
and Homes. We should not wonder that there are so many
abortions procured, when we know what a handicapped poor
creature the single mother is; and it is the single mother, who,
as a rule, if she has no relatives willing to help and cannot keep
her place in the economic world, has generally to go in as a
waiting patient to a Maternity Hospital.
When I was a young nurse, I was taught that a pregnant
woman should conserve her energy preparatory for that time,
when the partition of the infant from her body would undoubt-
edly constitute more or less of a shock, and, although she should
keep fit by taking gentle exercise, she was in no way to overdo
it.
What have we in comparison to this so far as these poor
women are concerned? They are kept washing, ironing, and
scrubbing up to the last minute, and are told “it is good for
them.”
Many of them do not think it is good for them, and say they
were feeling exhausted when they went to bed, and only began
to feel well-rested when they had to get up (in 10 days).
The next point also has to do with single mothers. We all
know that our first duty is to “Win the War;” but, in the mean-
time to make ourselves socially efficient so that we as a commun-
ity will be prepared for all the hard tasks ahead. We all know
that the value of labour is enhanced, and that women’s labour
is now, and shall be, in greater demand, but so far our Insti-
tutions to which mothers with babies are admitted, have not
acknowledged to themselves, much less to the women concerned,
or the public, that they owe a great deal to the unpaid labour of
unfortunate women.
Now we must not think that the economic factor is the only
thing to be considered in the matter. The educative, ethical and
spiritual value of such old established Institutions as, for in-
stance, The Infants’ Home at Ashfield, cannot be over-estimated.
There, for nearly a half century, girls have been re-educated.
It has been a focus from which nearly all our present day methods
have developed. The Homes under the State Children’s De-
partment learned much from it, and the Sisters at Waitara are
always ready with generous acknowledgment of early lessons.
Therefore I want you to understand that it is not the methods


of any particular Institutions which I wish to criticise, but to
bring under notice the fact that there is a general discontent
among girls in reference to unpaid labour.
And it is undoubtedly true that the more intelligent women
who have been “helped” by being admitted to some of the Homes
have a great contempt for all Homes where mothers and infants
are kept. The natural result is that their friends, when similarly
situated, wean their babies and board them out, much to the
detriment of the child.
My experience is that women do not like to be congregated in
Institutions. The State Children’s Department has made an
effort to specialize in Homes. At one place what were alluded
to last night as moral imbeciles are kept. In another, the girls
whose cases have to come before the Courts, and in another the
best class of the unmarried mother is shielded from the possi-
bility of having their private affairs known. It is a fact which
we will have to consider that no woman likes to be classed as
a “refugee” or “inmate” of an institution, nor will she surrender
her liberty if she can help it.
.Some scheme whereby allowances could be paid to the poor
mothers or the single mothers, to enable them to live privately
while the suckling of their children is an economic handicap,
would strike at the root of the preventable deaths of infants.
We will, however, always have some babies boarded-out. and
my next point has to do with them.
We know that scientific knowledge is not sufficient and
neither is surgical cleanliness to make a success of infant nursing.
Unless the scientific treatment, with hospital cleanliness, is ac-
companied by loving care, the infant wilts away to a little
skeleton, listless and dull, with dirty habits, a condition recog-
nized as “hospitalism.”
This brings me to the next point of my remarks. It is a
fact that most of the mothers and foster-mothers of sick infants
who are compelled for some reason or other to resign the nursing
of their babies to Infant Hospitals during the acute stage, are
not allowed to pick the infants up and give them a “love” when
visiting. This applies to all our Infant Hospitals.
One of the things which might worthily occupy the minds
of those interested in child welfare is the necessity for outdoor
workers to carry the babies out of hospitals daily for air, also
the necessity for more human and loving care of the infant
while confined. Nurses have not the necessary time to do one
eighth of what is needed, and the most piteous being in the
community at the present moment is the hospital baby.


If the girls who are at present working as Voluntary Aids,
would, when the war is ended, turn their attention to the care
of babies, what an example they could set the’world.
Another matter which I must touch upon is the time which
poor outdoor patients are kept waiting at our large Metropolitan
Hospitals. Many women have to neglect their homes and all
their other children, if one of the family should need to be taken
to hospital daily.
This practice of wasting the time of the poor men and
women has been going on for years, and much of the benefit
of free medical advice is lost because not availed of for this
reason. Consulting depots could be established in each suburb,
and only bad cases sent on to the large metropolitan hospitals.
This matter intimately concerns the welfare of children.
You will no doubt perceive that it has been my aim to show
that most of the defects of our present methods are to be traced
to an economic source. We must also note the fact that it is
not sufficient to have high ideals, but that at present our inter-
pretation of our own ideals is from from perfect. lam of
opinion that if the State wants healthy babies, the community
must be prepared to cease its niggardly and chaotic methods.
However, any constructive suggestions will more properly con-
cern the future operations of this conference.
There is much to be said in reference to venereal disease in
babies, and the necessity for Special Homes for mothers and
girls who are suffering from this disease, which I cannot now
touch on


THE PHENOMENA OF BIRTH AND MATERNITY
STATISTICALLY CONSIDERED.
By G. H. Knibbs, F.S.S., M.
de 1’ Inst. Int. de Stat., etc., etc..
Commonwealth Statistician
i. General. The close connection between those facts
of birth and maternity which are subject to statistical review,
and the well-being of infant life is sufficiently obvious to need
but mention. For evident reasons it is desirable to distinguish
between nuptial and ex-nuptial maternity. Both are impor-
tant, yet the distinction is not as sharp as might be supposed,
for reasons which need not here be considered.
It is proposed here to consider the main facts of the birth-
rate, nuptial and ex-nuptial. It may be stated that these
and the general time-relations between marriage and birth
reveal the extraordinary regularity of the human response to
the reproductive impulse, a response which characterises all
things essential to the continuation of the race.
The relative frequency of maternity in Australia enorm-
ously decreased, viz., to about one-half during a period of 41
years, viz., from 1862 to 1903, as the table hereunder shews.
Here it may be remarked that the crude birthrate, that is the
number per 1000 of the population, is in general only a rough
indication of birthrate proper, viz., that which depends upon
the numbers actually at the one degree of risk, and not upon
the total population.
2. The secular changes in birthrate. The remarkable fall-
ing off in the birthrate during these four decades naturally
occasioned concern, though the fact is often wrongly inter-
preted. This falling-off is shewn in Table I. (page 4), and
for purposes of comparison the marriage rates have also been
given.
These rates, a maximum in 1862, shew a fairly steady
decrease to a minimum in 1903, when the birth and marriage
rates were only 58.4 P e r cent, and 76.1 per cent, respectively.

*The highest values were both in 1862 i.c. for birthrate and marriage rate.
tThe lowest values were in 1903 and 1894.


of what they were in the former year. Then the birthrate
was 4.94 times the marriage rate; in 1903 it was only 3.79
times that rate. These relations, however, have been improv-
ing since 1903, and for 1915 the advances on the results for
1903 were 7.75 per cent, and 37.03 per cent, for birth and
marriage rates respectively. The factor of relation between
marriage and birth rates has also changed, viz., from 3.79
to 2.98, that is it is still decreasing.
This fall in birthrates has been characteristic of the
Western world. It is not peculiar to Australia. Such a fact,
however, is more serious in a young country of considerable
size, the population of which relatively is very small indeed.
It must give and has given concern to those who see its pos-
sible reaction on the future of this country. It is important,
however, to recognise clearly that there is a sharp limitation
to the reproductive power of the human race, a fact which
is often ignored.
3. Reproductive Power and its Meaning. All organisms,
including the human, are limited in their power of multiplica-
tion by the impossibility of their food supply advancing as
rapidly as their powers of reproduction demand. On a super-
ficial view it might be thought that a low birth rate is therefore
of no moment. But in a young and relatively uninhabited
country, such a view is erroneous. Other things being equal,
the race that multiplies most rapidly, will be the dominant race.
And if our country is to hold its own it must be populated. The
very limited power of the earth to sustain an increasing popu-
lation for many centuries can be seen in a number of ways.
Suppose, for example, that the increase of food supply was
initially in a constant ratio which —to take two examples—let
us suppose was 8 and 16 times that of the rate of increase at
every moment of the population; then if the latter were 1 per
cent, per annum, it would be only 331.5 and 422.9 years
respectively before the excess of food supply was overtaken
by the population increase.! It will be shown later that it
matters little that the food supply will also increase beyond
what it was initially.
tlf the percentage be greater, divide the above numbers of
years by the per cents, in the rate; that is, if the rate were
3 per cent, the time is only 110.5 and 141.0 years respec-
tively. This, of course, shews how impossible it is to
continue our rate of multiplication for any length of time.


Again, if the annual rate of increase was 1.159 per cent.,
which was about the rate for the five years 1906 to igio
inclusive, it would take only 1782 years to produce the pre-
sent population, viz., 1,649,000,000, from a single pair of
human beings. That it is impossible for the world’s popula-
tion to increase for any appreciable length of time at the
present rate, whatever the possibilities of food supply are,
is shewn by the following:—The average consumption per
individual of food-corn can be taken at, say, 5.7 bushels per
annum. Let us suppose that every acre of the earth’s surface
—neglecting only the arctic and antarctic regions, say in all
33.000. acres—could be made to produce 22.8 bushels
per annum, we should then get 752,400,000,000 bushels of
food corn per annum, which would supply only 132,000,000,000
persons. Even if the population increase were as low as 1 per
cent, per annum and the present population were only
1.500.000. the period of 450 years would reach the
exhaustion point of the food supply. Further, if by some
agricultural magic the yield could be made tenfold—the enorm-
ous amount of 228 bushels per acre —in 682 years shortage
would occur.
There is still another aspect of the matter shewing very
clearly the limits of the power of multiplication. The average
instantaneous rate of increase, viz., 1.159 per cent, per annum,
doubles the population in every 60.15 years, a rate which for
10,000 years gives the number 22184 with 46 noughts after it.
The actual mass of the earth is equivalent in persons each
weighing 100 lbs., to only 13226, with 19 noughts after it.
Hence it would require 16771 with 23 noughts after it times
as much matter as in the entire earth to form merely their
bodies. One sees at once that the rate of even 1 per cent, per
annum' cannot be maintained for even a few centuries. We
may learn from this we must populate Australia as quickly
as possible if we are to hold it. The pressure of necessity will,
sooner or later, compel us to secure ourselves by men and
material equal to the needs of the situation.
4 Ex-nuptial maternity, and its frequency. To those
who do not realise that human conduct is really very uniform,
the numerical constancy year by year of those whose maternity
is ex-nuptial is very striking. From 1907 to 1916 inclusive
it Was as shewn in the following table:—•

5- Secular variation in ex-nuptial maternity. It has been
surmised that recent events would have contributed to an
increase of the frequency of ex-nuptial maternity. That the
contrary is the case is evident from the preceding Table 111.
The annual results are given by the formula
£ = 6.230-0.079 (t- iqo7)-0.0072 (t-i 907) 2 .
E denoting the annual percentage at the beginning of
each year, and the date.
This shows that the number of ex-nuptial births is not only
relatively diminishing, but also diminishing with increasing
rapidity. Since 1913 the ratio of ex-nuptial cases to nuptial
cases has been rapidly decreasing although the population is, of
course, increasing—the greatest diminution being from 1915 to
1916.
If the nuptial and ex-nuptial cases be compared from
1913 to 1916 it will be seen that the falling-off of ex-nuptial
cases is much fore rapid than the nuptial.
6. The annual periodicity of nuptial and ex-nuptial births.
The frequency of births is not uniform during the year but has
a well-defined periodicity which is readily seen in the numbers
of the quarterly births. These must first be adjusted to repre-
sent quarters of equal duration. Effecting this adjustment we
have the results shewn in Table V. (page 9).
If the percentages of ex-nuptial on total births in Table 111.
be examined, it will be seen that, with one exception, the ratio
is greatest for the third quarter, and is a maximum for the
middle of the quarter. If the seasonal influence were quite
identical, the ratio would be unaffected: this shews that, what-
ever be the cause, it operates more efficiently in the cases of
ex-nuptial maternity. The corresponding insemination-period
is the last quarter of the preceding year, with a maximum m
November.
7. The age-influence upon maternity. Apart probably
from all questions of the influence of age upon self-control,
there is unmistakable evidence of a variation of the probability
of maternity with age. This is shewn by the relative frequency
with which persons of different ages experience either nuptial
or ex-nuptial maternity. The crude annual probability is given
by dividing the number of cases of ex-nuptial maternity by the
number of unmarried women of the. same age. The results
are as shewn in Table VI. (page 9).
The greatest probability of nuptial maternity is thus at
18J years of age, and of ex-nuptial maternity at 22i years of
age. For equal numbers of single and of married women, the

chance of ex-nuptial maternity at the age of maximum risk
is only 0.03744 of that for nuptial maternity, or vice versa, the
chance of nuptial maternity is 26.71 times that of ex-nuptial.
This probably is, of course, not restricted to first cases of
maternity.
The curves representing the respective probabilities are
almost identical in general character, with the exception that
the maximum age lags behind in the ex-nuptial cases. This
lag probably has no physiological basis but is to be ascribed
to the repressive potency of social traditions.
8. Age of greatest fertility and its probability. The curve
of probability of maternity, given by dividing the cases occur-
ring by the number at risk, does not directly give the age of
greatest fertility, for the reason that a previous case of
maternity, diminishes the risk. Thus when the numbers are
corrected so as to represent the number at full risk it is found
to affect both the maximum age and the maximum probability.
The question is elaborate and an analysis by me is being
published in the Appendix to the 1911 Census. It will be
sufficient here to note that when the data are thus reviewed
the following result is obtained, viz.:—
Maximum (uncorrected) fertility is at age 18.8, and
the probability is 0.483.
Maximum (corrected) fertility is at age 19.0, and the
probability is 0.5 17.
It is difficult, however, to be certain that this is physio-
logically the age of maximum fertility: it may be physiologi-
cal fertility modified by other facts. Nevertheless, when all
the circumstances indicated by general knowledge are taken
into account, itywould seem not improbable that it is the true
age of maximum fertility.
9. On the range of interval between marriage and birth.
The average interval between marriage and a first birth in-
creases with age according to the following formula, in which
i represents the interval and x the age.
i = 0.0437 (x-u) + 0.0i22i (x-n) 15 .
The formula gives zero value for 11 years. This may
possibly have some connection with the minimum age
at which maternity can occur for any race which happens to be
domiciled in Australia. The curve indicated by the formula
holds good up to the age 47, but after this the interval rapidly
diminishes, becoming zero at about age 55. There are, of
course, very few cases between the ages 47 and 55.
12. Conclusion. The interpretation of the phenomena
which have been disclosed by the statistical facts under review
is by no means simple in detail. For example, the extra


ordinary oscillations in frequency—repeated with but slight
modification whatever the age, of the mothers—during the
interval of nine months from marriage, are so regular that
they must express some law, and a rational explanation there-
of is a desideratum.
The figures adduced disclose with what force —under the
general social conditions of Australia—the reproductive instinct
expresses itself. Having in view Australia’s destiny, one is
reminded that an intelligent appreciation of what eugenics
means for the betterment of the race, requires that we should
face the facts as they are in reality and endeavour to direct
the vital forces so that the race shall advance in ethical and
physical power.
It may be added that we shall do well to remember that
the important fact is, not so much that the birth-rate should
be very high, but that the residual birth rate should be high.
This implies that we should thoroughly know the facts with
which we have to deal and should accentuate, in social
eugenics, those features which concern themselves with the
conditions under which new lives enter and are preserved for
the nation.


EVENING SESSION
THURSDAY. MAY 24, 1917
Staff-Surgeon F. H. Brennand , R.A.N. District
Naval Officer —lately H.M.S. Melbourne , in the
Chair
Dr. Guy Griffiths: “The Chair will be taken to-night by
Dr. Brennand who has just returned from 2 years and g months
active service on H.M.A.S. Melbourne. We were very anxious
that the last session of the Conference should be presided over
by someone who had the double qualifications of having
served at the war, and, at the same time, of having a special
interest in the welfare of children.”
Dr. Brennand (Chairman) : “I hope you will excuse my
shortcomings as a Chairman. It is a sudden change to be
plunged into the peaceful atmosphere of a meeting like this after
what I have been doing lately, and I am not used to speaking.
“I am very glad Dr. Griffiths has referred to the time that
I was a colleague of Dr. Booth. We were carrying out a number
of anthropometric measurements of the school children in this
State, and my work was to measure the boys from the State
Schools and Grammar Schools, and to try and get all the data
we could about the growth and development of the rising Aus-
tralians. That work, unfortunately, was onl) r carried out to a
limited extent. I think the number of measurements we took
was about 5,000 boys, and the same number of girls, and I think,
the same number was examined and classified. The idea at
that time was to start an anthropometric bureau in Australia,
something on the lines of one in the United States, but I think,
at the time, the Government did not have very much funds to
spare on a purely scientific matter of that kind, and the thing
lapsed. I believe however, a series of these measurements have
since been taken by school teachers in various parts of the State,
but they were not so full as those proposed in the time of Sir
Timothy Coghlan. This subject of child welfare, of course, is
a most important one in view of the future race which will in-
habit this continent, and the original investigations were to find
put if, in the course of two or three generations the type was
becoming modified in any way as the result of different environ-
ment from European countries. That is a purely scientific
aspect of the child, but I presume that this Society is not so
much interested in that as in the study of social conditions, in
order to try, if possible, to improve the social conditions of the
children and advise new and improved methods, of education.


“I have just come from London, and while I was waiting
for a ship, I had an opportunity of visiting the hospitals in the
East End for three or four weeks. It was painful to see the
children you meet in the East End in the depth of winter,
miserably clad and fed, in fact it is a common thing for children
to go to school without any breakfast. How badly these children
do their lessons it can be imagined.”
THE BABY-THE EMPIRE’S ASSET.
A. W. GREEN.
President State Children’s Board.
There can be no question that the case for the baby cannot
be too strongly put, especially at the present time, when the man-
hood of the nation is being so depleted by this awful war. It
therefore behoves us to be up and doing, and, under every circum-
stance, “Save the baby.”
In this State a great deal is being done by the various agencies,
but while there is so much being done, a great deal more might be
done by a more systematic co-operation, and, with that object in
view, this conference has been convened, so that we shall learn
more of one another’s work, and thus fill up the gaps which re-
main. Every baby saved is so much gained to the State, and
while each agency is reaching forward to do its portion, all should
co-ordinate, so that there shall be no waste effort.
During the year 1916, there were 52,075 births in this State,
and 3,533 deaths of children under one year, which is 67,8 per
1,000 births; to these the metropolis contributed 1.428 deaths, and
the remainder of the State 2,105 deaths. The rate is the lowest
on record, and is 8 per cent, below the average of the last 10
years, which includes seven years of exceptional low infantile
mortality. Of the deaths of children under one year —and this
is a most important fact, as it indicates to my mind, the immediate
necessity for the extension of pre-natal assistance, on a liberal
scale, to expectant mothers—l,6s7, or 47 P er cen t. occurred at
ages under one month, and 2,196, or 62 per cent, at ages under
three months.
This wastage should not be allowed to go on. but every effort
should be put forth to improve matters in this direction. How
can this be done? By educating the mothers, in the first instance,
and by helping them, in the second. Early education of the
woman on the subject of rearing babies would be of immense
value, and then, after the education, follow up this by seeing that
the woman has every assistance during her period of motherhood.
We cannot be too careful of our women if we desire to have a
strong virile race.


I should like to express the view, strongly, that if many babies
are to survive the critical stage of infancy, they must be paid for,
and paid for well by the State, and, naturally the person most
entitled to the payment is the mother. Payment for the child
should begin at a defined time before its birth, and continue for
a defined time after its birth. On the one hand, the State should
guarantee the payment and recoup itself as best it can, if ever
it recoups itself at all, whilst the mother, for her part, should be
placed under such conditions as will guarantee the expenditure
in a manner intended in the interests of the child. So much for
the payment aspect.
Now for the personal aspect. lam convinced that mother
love exists, or can be developed for the child in at least 90 per
cent, of the cases in which the child is allowed to be born. The
inducement for the infant to die—and the mere wish for that
result obsessing the mind is of great assistance towards that end,
without any active measures—is primarily that the mother has no
means to keep it; she has already incurred social ostracism and
all the disabilities and temptations that that implies in her lapse
from conventionality. But I am convinced that, guaranteed the
means of keeping the child from the time she realises that she is
about to become a mother, she is prepared to do all in her power
to rear it. The spirit of mother love, if encouraged and de-
veloped, will triumph over all things. All that the unfortunate,
friendless, despairing, destitute, and frequently homeless mother
asks for are two things:—(l) The means to fulfil her duty under
reasonable conditions which are outside her control, and (2)
Privacy. Surely, she is entitled to those. At any rate, I am
satisfied if she receives them, the child will be given the maximum
chance of surviving.
As to privacy: What does this entail? As regards cost,
nothing, and less than nothing. As regards the removal of
temptation to infanticide, actively or passively entertained, every-
thing Girls loathe homes and institutions—the very mention of
the name is sufficient. They leave their homes to hide their
shame. That is the beginning and the end of their prospects, and
of the coming child’s. Their only refuge is an institution, and
this they hate, for particulars must transpire as to their identity,
their home, their parents, their character, and the cause of their
trouble, not infrequently their means; the subsequent insistence
upon court proceedings, and finally, not infrequently, the dis-
charge with their infants, or without them, to situations without
regard to fitness. The term “private home” is. in this sense, a
misnomer—there is no such thing. Private homes are those
which the Government does not control. As regards the desire
for information, they are frequently more exigent than the
Government, which is required by law to collect the particulars
of each girl.


What the girl says, in effect, is this: “Give me the means to
keep my child, and don’t ask any questions; don’t wish to know
who I am; do this for me, and for you I will do my utmost to
rear my infant under the conditions that you prescribe.”
Now I must say that I strongly concur with the mother’s
point of view. What should it matter to us whether the girl is
Martha Brown or Mary Smith? What should it matter to us
whether she goes into a Home or stays out of it, providing that,
given the means, she can satisfy us that she is willing to do her
best to rear her child ? Why should the harrowing details of her
seduction be insisted upon? Why should the prosecution of the
man be a condition of the child’s survival?
It may be argued that the course I have advocated offers a
premium to immorality, and allows a coward to go free. The
answer to that is; No girl or woman will sacrifice her social
prospects for the monetary consideration she would receive as a
mother under the conditions I suggest. Furthermore, as to a
man’s escaping “scot free,” he should be prosecuted with the
utmost rigour, compatible with the coming child’s greatest number
of chances of surviving.
But, in the last resort, the unborn child should not suffer; in
the last resort, the State should take up its duty of Fatherhood,
and hold out an unstinting hand to the woman who so badly needs
it. This position, I say, must be recognised if unborn children
are to survive, and mothers fulfil the full and natural functions
which motherhood has thrust upon them in all their unprepared-
ness.
The rate of payment should be a sliding scale according as to
whether the mother (a) nurses and mothers her child, or (b)
merely mothers it.
Consider for a moment the condition of the illegitimate or
unwanted baby. In the period 1904 to 1914, 89,663 babies died
in the Commonwealth before they reached their first year. It is
quite understood that a very large percentage of these infants
were born healthy and strong, yet, from one cause or another,
they were allowed to fade away, and be lost to the community.
Surely something can be done to stop this leakage, and bring
about a better state of things.
In the year 1915, 9,107 babies died in the Commonwealth. Of
these, 3,227 died within one week from their birth. Is not this
an appalling loss, and can we not remedy it? Surely, by better
care of the mother during her pregnancy, these startling figures
may be reduced. Then let everyone of the agencies dealing with
babies, take a grip of the matter and make a bold bid to improve
the lot of the expectant mother, so that the baby, upon arrival,
will not be handicapped out of the race for life. The total
number of illegitimate children born in this State during the year


1914 was 2 .778, which gives a rate of 5.18 per cent, of the total
children registered during the year.
The ordinary death-rate of children under one year is 64.2,
but that of illegitimate children is 141.0 per 1,000 births, showing
the dangers to which illegitimate children are exposed.
Strong educative measures of a repressive character should be
introduced with the object of enforcing parental control, and thus
lessening the temptation to which girls of tender age expose them-
selves.
It is quite a common thing for girls, during the age of 13 and
16, to frequent picture shows regularly, unattended by any
responsible adult —most frequently with their parents’ connivance
or consent. As though this exposure of young girls was not
sufficiently serious in itself, films of a sex problem character are
a common feature, helping to inflame the already too precocious
imaginations ‘of these children. In this connection, I strongly
advocate that associations for the protection of child life should
have a definite part in the censoring of unsuitable films; for, there
is not the slightest doubt that they are as pernicious to the plastic
mind when they are of an unsuitable character, as they are bene-
ficial under properly guided educational influences.
It will, of course, be known to the various members of this
conference that the attempt to protect the conditions of child-
hood is universal. This is sufficiently indicated in the report pre-
sented by Dr. Mary Booth on “Infant Mortality” in 1913, when
a Congress of 29 delegates for 23 countries was opened by the
President, the Right Hon. John Burns, M.P., M.D., who esti-
mated that the remedial measures that were being taken were
saving 50,000 infants a year. It is not necessary to review the
details of that report —three facts, however, might be emphasised
as applying specially to conditions here—
(l) Special provision for pre-maternity cases generally.
(2) Payment of the maternity benefit to the mother herself.
(3) Greater prominence to infant hygiene.
In the same year, 1913, we have the International Congress
for the Protection of Childhood, at Brussels. I shall quote cer-
tain excerpts from the report of that Congress by the Hon. Sir
John Cockburn, K.C.M.G., and there is no doubt that, had it not
been for this world-wide war, many administrative and legal re-
forms would have been introduced ere this. This international
necessity was freely accepted by all philanthropic workers, and
has, of course, been greatly intensified by existing economic con-
ditions, and, generally speaking, an entirely new set of affairs,
the details of which cannot, in any complete degree, be established
until the war has ended.
Having this in mind, it will be interesting to review the various


expressions accompanying the resolutions adopted at the Inter-
national Congress.
“To encourage the survival of the weak, without (Troubling
about their fate, was to handicap progress by increasing the dead
weight that had to be carried.” The three dominant factors
recognised were “The Children’s Judge,” who might claim the
enviable title of the “Judge of the Poor”; the second was the role
assigned to those scientists, psychologists, hygienists and doctors
who concerned themselves with the welfare of the children, and
incidentally with that of the poor; the third was the collaboration
and influence of women in endeavouring to assure a better future
to the children and to the poor.
The heading of a leaflet submitted by a delegate ran as
follows:—“Take care of the children; they are the joy of the
home, the solace of old age, the continuity of the race, the sap
of the nation. Without them the hearth is lonely, old age is
desolate, the race dwindles, and nations disappear.”
It was unanimously resolved—
1. That radical reforms ought to be introduced in the
practical working of creches.
2. That the time had come to include orphanages and
houses for the reception of neglected children in the
list of institutions regulated, supervised, and eventu-
ally subsidised by the public authorities.
The following resolutions were also unanimously adopted:—
1. All children put out to nurse or to be minded away from
the home of their parents or legal guardian ought to
be placed under the supervision of the public
authorities.
2. Permission to bring up or to take charge of children so
situated to be subject to hygienic conditions prescribed
by the authority, and especially to the previous obtain-
ing of a certificate as a child guardian by the person
concerned. The programme of theoretical and
practical studies for such certificate, as well as their
duration, to he fixed by law.
3. The medical inspection of these children should be en-
trusted to medical men appointed by public bodies,
and possessing a special knowledge and jurisdiction.
Dr. Dclcourt also submitted the following resolution, on
which, however, no vote was taken: —
The first International Congress for the Protection of
Childhood expresses the desire to see enacted in every
country where it does not already exist a law having
for its fundamental principles—
1. Free medical attendance to every pregnant woman.


2. Prohibition for pregnant women to work in factories
and workshops during the six weeks immediately pre-
ceding their confinement, and to'be paid during those
six weeks an allowance based on the average rate of
women’s wages in the different countries.
3. Payment of a daily allowance during a period of six
months to every woman who herself suckles her
infant.
Dr. Delcourt’s resolution is particularly interesting, inasmuch
as it expresses the economic difficulties which reformers have to
face. I strongly support every word of Dr. Delcourt’s resolution,
and I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that the intro-
duction of such measures as he proposes would have a striking
influence on infantile mortality.
To come nearer home, we realise that Australia—and particu-
larly New South Wales, is already practising many of the
measures which are apparently still in the air in other parts of
tho world. Modern legislative efforts have secured a great im-
provement in the condition of infantile mortality, until, in New
Zealand and Australia, the death-rate is now the lowest in the
world.
The International Congress quite realised the actual work
that is being done in Australia, which country, being young, “with
institutions in a plastic condition, is especially responsive to the
demands of the age.” Problems here can be attacked with
success because they still remain obvious, and. I might say, that
the attacking during the last few years, has been persistent and
successful, and is, in my opinion, in a very considerable degree,
due to the exercise of the influence of the women of the State in
the last few years that they have been accorded political and
social freedom. I will go further and say this —that if the prob-
lems relating to child life are not satisfactorily settled, either by
administrative or legislative means, in this State at least, the
women of the community will be primarily to blame, for they are
problems which call for solution particularly from women.
The State Children’s Department in this State keeps steadily
before it the one view—that the baby should be kept with its
mother under every circumstance; with this object, it has estab-
lished Homes where mothers can be kept with their babies, and
thus, enabled to breast-feed them. It has also provided Homes
for pregnant women, where they may, without worry and anxiety,
rest until their confinement takes place, and. when the period of
lying-in has been finished, may return to the home and suckle
their infants. These Homes have proved to be very successful,
and the results very satisfactory indeed; so much so, that the
Homes which have been started are always full, and the accom-
modation thoroughly taxed. We find that the care of the mother
before her confinement materially assists the baby, and there can


be no doubt that the actual mothering of the baby tends to give
it a very much better chance of life than if placed in any Institu-
tion, however well it may be managed. The baby needs one
woman’s care and attention during its first year of life. and. un-
less it gets such nursing, its chances of being reared are much less
than they should be. Mothering is, therefore, of paramount im-
portance, and, under no circumstances, should a mother be en-
couraged not to nurse a child.
To show the injurious effects of depriving the baby of its
natural food, Dr. Robertson, Medical Officer of Health for
Birmingham, has shown that while the infant mortality of breast-
fed babies is 7.8 per 1,000 births, that of infants receiving no
breast milk is 232 per 1,000 births, and Dr. Newsholme. Medical
Adviser to the Local Government Board, Birmingham, has shown
that the probability of death from epidemic diarrhoea is 54 times
greater among infants fed on cow’s milk, than among those fed
on breast milk, and 150 times greater amongst those fed on con-
densed milk. These figures tend to show how necessary it is
for all those dealing with pregnant women to advise them to
persevere in feeding their new-born babes on the breast, instead
of looking round for some substitute—there is no substitute to a
child’s natural food. It should always be remembered that where
the want of breast-feeding does not kill, it very often maims, and
is often responsible for rickets, tuberculosis and a number of
other ailments. Then, let it be breast-feeding, and breast-feeding
only.
As the result of my experience through many years, the
present most important question to settle is that of the organisation
of honorary effort, and co-ordination of various aspects of the
work, in order to prevent a considerable waste of most important
philanthropic energy. There should, in my opinion, be one
strong central committee, subdivided into sub-committees for
particular purposes; one sub-committee would deal with the
question of creches, another would deal with the question of in-
fant feeding, another sub-committee would particularly apply
itself to the conditions of infant life and infant upbringing,
another would constitute itself a bureau for recording purposes,
systematising work, preparing statistics and so on.
NOTE ON DAY NURSERIES.
There is very real need for the extension of day nurseries in
many suburbs. There are a few now, but they are quite inade-
quate to the demands made upon them, and to growing necessities.
There should be a day nursery in every suburb in order to ensure
the proper caring of children of tender ages during the mother’s
absence at work. There are very many women who are now
receiving aid from the State Children Relief Department, as
widows or deserted wives, who would gladly go to work and


thus swell their income if they could leave their children under
proper supervision in the daytime.
In conclusion, I shall give a brief summary of the steps which
are being taken by this Department at the present time, with the
object of maintaining and increasing the improvement in mortality
among infants —
(1) Pre-natal Assistance (though on a very limited scale) to
expectant mothers. This assistance is extended in
conjuntion with the Homes for Babies and Mothers.
(2) The establishment of Homes of a semi-private character
for a limited number of mothers and their babies, with
special facilities for the encouragement of breast-
feeding.
(3) The extension of the system of salaried Lady Inspectors
to deal specially with the conditions relating to infancy
(instruction in dieting and in the general care of
children, advice to mothers).
(4) Special rates of payment to private guardians for the care
and treatment of infants suffering from gastro-
enteritis, or the results thereof . . . and, generally,
special rates of payment for ailing and delicate infants.
(5) The appointment of a Special Female Officer at the
Children’s Court, in order to ensure that mothers, or
expectant mothers, who go to the Court seeking the
benefits of the Infants’ Protection Act as regards pre-
, liminary expenses, or maintenance, may have the
fullest assistance in establishing their claim. The
appointment also of a special Male Inspector to assist
them in Court, when necessary.
The Homes for Mothers and Infants need to be generally ex-
tended, and there should be a greater guarantee of privacy than
there is at present; that is to say, everything should be subservient
to the fact of the necessity of the child’s admission and the proper
treatment of the mother and the later personal identification of
the case for record, or maintenance purposes, should be of
relatively small importance.
There should be careful oversight of the distribution of the
baby bonus, to ensure that the women themselves reap its benefit.
There is no doubt that in many instances, at the present time,
they do not do so, and it is not infrequently an inducement towards
a purpose which is contrary to that anticipated.
After all, as I have said before, the main remedy lies, in my
opinion, in two directions;—
1. In the proper organisation and co-ordination of the various
agencies relating to infant life.
2. In the hands of the women themselves.


A LARGER MOTHERHOOD.
Ethel Turner (Mrs. H. C. Curlewis).
I wish that someone would invent powerful field glasses with
a special kind of lens, a retrospective kind of lens, through which
we might peer backwards into the life of any citizen, good, bad,
or indifferent. We would focus it on the childhood of such citi-
zen, and at a glance be able to discover, in a very great measure,
just what that childhood had lacked or been supplied with to give
it those good, bad, or indifferent qualities that are marking its
career at the present moment.
Let us imagine it focussed on the childhood of each and every
soldier who has taken up arms and gone to defend his country.
What shall we find? Doubtless that a large proportion of them
has had good parenthood, and the cherishing of good homes, and
even the remainder that may have lacked such has not had enough
of hardship and unhappiness and limitation to kill that warm
spark of humanity, that fierce hatred of oppression, that faith in
the ultimate triumph of good over evil, which distinguishes man
from the beast of the field. But focus now on the bad citizen
and the indifferent one; adjust the lens and peer into the child-
hood of the man who would burn, murder, or rob, while the
nation is locked in deadly combat with the enemy; or the man
who would set himself to make selfish profit out of the deadly
combat; or even the man who simply shrugs his shoulders at such
combat and does nothing in any way to help to end it.
I think the lens relentlessly focussed on these would bring to
sight childhood so black, so full of deprivations, so twisted, so
starved in soul if not in body, that we should turn our gaze away
from it, full of shame and shock that we had consented to go on
living happily in the world while such things went on. We should
have to look further back, of. course, than the childhood of many
of them-—back to the childhood of their fathers and mothers,
their grandfathers and grandmothers —knowing that heredity is
the strongest of all the influences, but it would always be to the
period of childhood that we should direct our eyes, since we are
quite seised of the fact that the child is father of the man, even
more than the man is father of the child.
Now, there is something I want to say that I have the diffi-
dence in saying which we all have in speaking of our deeper feel-
ings. It is that I am one of those who are becoming more and
firmly convinced as these heavy-footed months and years go by
that out of the fire and blood and tears of this war we shall
emerge with clearer vision. We shall find it sheerly impossible
to see crying evils in the world and go comfortably on our way


without making a personal and whole-souled effort to redress
them. Poverty, neglect of children, drink, preventable diseases,
one by one we shall grapple with them as they have never before
been grappled with in the history of the world, and one by one
they will yield to us. I truly believe that before we die, we who
are now alive shall be able to say —
The years are slow, the Vision tarries long,
And far the end may be,
But one by one the ancient fiends of wrong
Go out and leave earth free.
But these are perhaps what Hamlet would call “Words, words,
words.” Let us be practical. I take it that to be practical is to
submit at least one workable idea for the betterment of
neglected children. For lam a profound believer that the
happy child is the future good citizen. I want vastly to
enlarge the motherhood of Australia. I seriously and sanely
ask every good woman in the land at once to adopt a
child. Whose child? What child? The nearest neglected
one upon which you can lay your hands. It may be one of the
many children of your struggling washerwoman, or that shrink-
ing child round the corner whose father drinks, or the little fellow
in the hospital with hip disease and no one to visit him, or that
lonely froward girl in the institution; or, or, the list is absolutely
without end. There are none of us so happy, no, not one of us,
who cannot at a moment’s notice lay our finger on an example of
a friendless or handicapped child.
Now lam really trying to be practical. By adoption Ido not
mean bring it into your home and provide for it altogether. What
I do mean is extend some of the superfluous motherliness that is
in your heart to one child who needs it. If you have children of
your own then you have plenty of motherliness and to spare; if
you have none here then is the outlet your heart needs. Indeed,
this plan is quite clear in my mind; and if I can be so happy as to
make it clear to others then it will materialise forthwith.
Imagine us to have made an association that needs no presi-
dent, no committee, no official expenses, just a quiet association
of hearts all up and down the crowded and the lonely parts of
our continent. Call it, if you like, “The Larger Motherhood
Association.” Write your undertaking down for it yourself
deliberately and plainly, and keep it .where it may refresh your
mind from time to time —“I undertake to try to bring happiness
and well-being into.the life of one child who needs it, and to try
to help make of it a good citizen.”
Here are a few suggestions of ways to help the child of your
adoption:—•
I. Make it realise that in any trouble it may at once turn
to you.


2. Watch that no one is overworking it or underfeeding it:
if yon suspect the latter let it come to your own house as often as
you can for a nourishing meal or send it nourishing food. If the
former, the law is ready to help you.
3. See that it does not grow up with any remediable defect; the
State and the hospitals are at your elbow for this. Its own
parents are too often the ones who apathetically leave it until
too late.
4. See that it does not have the humiliation of going to school
in ragged or ugly clothes. If you cannot afford new ones for it
you may he able to commandeer pretty and serviceable outgrown
garments from the wardrobes of your well-to-do little friends.
5. Give it Christmas gifts and birthday gifts, and all the “un-
hirthday” gifts you can afford. It is a good deal more
susceptible to joyous surprises than even your own petted darlings.
6. Discover its natural bent and help it forward if you can
by extra lessons or books on the subject.
7. Let it spend a day with you as often as you can; it will be
good for you both. If it is in an institution visit it, and write to
it often.
8. Over and above all let it realise that in you it has someone
who is genuinely concerned for its welfare, its happiness, and the
place it is going to take eventually in the world.
Remember you are not being asked to attempt to grapple with
the awful sum total of child-misery in the world; you are simply
asked to make one neglected child your care, and to concentrate
upon it. It will be in the unity of such isolated action that the
strength will lie.
Statistics show that in this State alone there are 16,600
children so unfortunate the State has had to step in to provide for
them. Double the number with children drifting about in the
care of neglectful parents or guardians, or hopelessly poverty-
stricken ones, and this gives 33,200 young people for adoption.
This gives a chance to 33.200 women for the exercise of the
larger motherhood..
There is a poignant phrase in one of the books of Sully Prud-
homme —“Oh meres, culpables absentes” —oh mothers, culpably
not there. It seems to me that wherever there is a little life
growing ugly and awry, wherever there is “a child’s sob in the
dark,” all women near by stand accused —oh meres,- culpables
absentes.”


SYDNEY DAY NURSERY ASSOCIATION.
A BRIEF OUTLINE OF THE WORK.
Twelve years ago the Sydney Day Nursery Association was
founded by a small enthusiastic band of workers, and the first
Nursery was opened in Dowling Street, Woolloomooloo, the aims
and objects of the Association being to properly care for the
babies and young children of working mothers, when the mothers
are forced to be at work, and to establish Nurseries in the
crowded and needy sections of the city.
Excellent pioneer work was done in Woolloomooloo, and very
soon the accommodation of the Nursery was taxed to its utmost,
which proved how great the necessity was for these Institutions.
Then the Committee were confronted with the difficulty of
finding larger premises in a suitable locality, and eventually a
house was found in Darlington. Here the work was successfully
carried on, though under rather adverse conditions, as it was
soon found that this house also was not large enough and in
many ways was most unsuitable and inconvenient. However, in
October, 1913, the ambitions and ideals the Association had had
in view from its inception were largely realised, and a splendid
property in Arundel Street. Forest Lodge, was purchased and
converted as nearly as possible into a model Nursery. Here the
babies have every advantage of fresh air, plenty of sunshine, and
the care and attention so necessary to the physical, mental, and
moral development of the little child; they also have an outlet
for their energies in the Nursery Kindergarten, which has proved
a great success.
The second object of the Association, that of establishing
other Nurseries, has been very difficult of realization, mainly
owing to the difficulty of raising sufficient funds, but in October
of last year, thanks to the generosity of the Government, a branch
Nursery was opened in Chippendale, and already is filled to its
utmost capacity. It is only owing to the lack of funds, that
there is not a Nursery in every crowded part of Sydney. The
need for them cannot be too strongly urged. The State’s asset,
the baby, should have every chance of growing into a healthy
and useful citizen, and it is only by helping and caring for it
from its earliest infancy that this can be accomplished.
It is to be hoped that one of the results of this Conference
will be to make this work more widely known, and to help the
Association to continue in a much wider field the splendid and
national work, that of saving the baby.


CHILDREN’S GARDEN CLUBS.
MRS. BERTRAM STEVENS,
President Women’s Horticultural Society.
In order to interest children in gardening, the Women’s Horti-
cultural and Home Industries Society has appointed a committee
to establish Girls’ and Boys’ Clubs wherever possible. Miss Brace
has accepted the position of Honorary Organizer of these clubs.
Children’s clubs have already been tried with very great
success in America. There the idea has been extended to the
raising of corn, pigs, and poultry by children. Not only have
the boys and girls themselves benefited considerably, but the
production of food has been increased by millions of dollars
worth as a result of the clubs’ activities. Some of the children
have far exceeded their elders in intensive production, and one
boy holds the record for the largest potato crop in the world
from a small area.
Here we are starting with garden clubs; one of these is in
working order at Waitara, with a membership of twenty children.
A piece of ground already ploughed was lent by a member of the
Society. The ground was marked in two parts, one for the
juniors under ten years of age, and one for seniors over ten.
Each part was divided into plots of equal size, and each plot was
numbered, and lots were drawn to decide ownership.
The children were first taught the proper method of pre-
paring and manuring the ground. Seeds were given to them, and
they were shown how to plant their own plots. Seeds are also
sold in penny packets, so that the children may taken them home
and use them there.
The principal object of the clubs is to encourage the children
to make gardens in their own back yards. The demonstration
ground is for teaching purposes, and it is thought that bringing
members together in a common purpose and with the prospect of
reward will make them more keenly interested.
Prizes are offered for the best kept plot in the club garden,
and for the most profitable crop grown in the home gardens.
Special prizes will be awarded for particular crops.
Each child is charged an entrance fee of threepence, and a
monthly subscription of not more than threepence. The funds
are controlled by the children,themselves, and will go towards the
prize money. The club is managed by a committee elected by
the children. The committee consists of six members, three girls
and three boys, with a president who is a member of the Women’s
Horticultural and Home Industries Society. The committee is


responsible for the good behaviour of the members, the care of
the tools used at the demonstration ground, etc. By self-
management the children will acquire some of the primary ideas
of citizenship, which in itself is a good thing.
The organizing committee appointed by the Society will
arrange for the sale of the products of the children’s gardens,
the net proceeds of the sales being handed to the children them-
selves. *
It is urgently requested that anyone owning, or knowing an
owner, of vacant land, which could be used for a club garden—
it need only be a small area—should communicate with the Society.
In that way, as well as in donations, a great deal can be done to
help the movement along.
It is a movement which deserves assistance, as it will make
children healthier; it will provide their families with good vege-
tables at a low cost; it will interest them in the land, and its culti-
vation, and will encourage them to leave the crowded cities and
develop the country.

Miss Goldsmith proposed: “That, in the opinion of this
Conference, Day Nurseries should be established in all the
populous suburbs.”
Mr. A. W. Green seconded: “There should be no question
about it. There should be a Day Nursery in every populous
part of the city. These women do need out-help. We do not
want to make them pensioners entirely on the Government. We
do not want to do away with their thrift. Of course, if a woman
has young children in her house, it is impossible for her to go
out to work,, but if she is able to place them in a Day Nursery,
then she is quite willing to do her little bit for her babies.”
Resolution Carried.
Mr. Mackay (President of Kindergarten Union) : “I have
not had the pleasure of attending this Conference during the
whole of its sittings. I have been in and out as my business
permitted, and I have noticed that it was urged that something
concrete should come out of this Conference in regard to the
meetings and resolutions. The resolution I have to move is
something concrete in reference to what has been done: —
‘That this Convention, realising that alcohol is one of the
great evils menacing child life, resolves to urge the
Government to introduce an Anti-shouting Bill immedi-
ately in order to minimise that evil.’
“The reason that I move that motion is, as President of the
Kindergarten Union, I am keenly interested in child welfare.
It is well-known that there are nine schools established in the
city, and I should like to have ninety. In visiting these schools,
and speaking to the directors generally about their work, they
all say that in a few of the homes, drunkenness is prevalent,
and drunkenness is a disease I think we should deal with.
According to my way of thinking, I believe the disease of
drunkenness is acquired through our silly social custom of
shouting. It is very hard to reform a drunkard, but if you
remove the cause of drunkenness, and I believe you could, by
removing the silly custom of which he became a drunkard. If
the Conference form a deputation to the Government, they will
give some strength to the movement in New South Wales.”
Mrs. Anderson seconded the motion. Carried.
Discussion.
(Clergyman) : “The British Royal Commission said that
drink is largely responsible for perhaps 60 or 70 per cent, of
the disease concerning which we are here to-night, and therefore


everything we can do to hinder the drink traffic helps this
cause ”
Mrs. Jackson : “A prominent American citizen in Svdney
said ‘I do not know what the women of Australia are thinking
about. You have the vote: cannot you do something with it?
You are actually showing pictures that the American women
have turned down. They determined to have nothing but the
best, and you put on the screens what we have refused.’ ”
Dr. Litchfield: “It struck me that Mr. Green’s address
was eminently practical, and I find myself in accord with almost
everything he said. Some of his schemes were rather bold,
especially from the financial aspect. I think, in regard to in-
fantile mortality, he picked out the most important point in
laying such stress on the death rate amongst illegitimate children.
It is the death rate amongst illegitimate children which sends the
mortality rate up, and by dealing with this in a practical manner,
there is no doubt the infantile mortality would be very
considerably reduced.
“Then I also agreed with him in his remarks about the
censorship of picture shows. I must say I have seen things in,
picture shows which I hardly thought possible—not only that
they could be shown, but that such things could actually be
conceived. We necder a stricter censorship of these pictures,
especially those dealing with sexual matters and problems. I
also agree with Mr. Green in connection with the boarding-out
system. We find, every now and then, in Sydney, some well-
meaning but misguided people advocating that we should go
back to the barrack or institution system of dealing with the
children of the poor, including infants. I hope that such a
backward step will never be taken in this country. I think the
boarding-out system is the best and has thoroughly justified
itself. I agree with the Frenchman who was quoted by Sir
Chas. McKeilar, that to put a child into an institution is to put
it on a toboggan straight for hell.”
Miss Murray (Victoria) : “With reference to Mrs. Curlewis’
paper on Adoptions, I think it would surprise all the members
of this Conference if they knew how many adoptions there really
are. (I am speaking for Victoria). There are hundreds every
year, and amongst people of all classes. The majority of the
adoptions are good, and it is nothing new for people of all classes
to take the babies wholly and solely, not just an interest. I do
not know what the figures are in New South Wales, but I am
sure that there are 200 adoptions a year in Victoria that are
notified, and quite 200 not notified through ignorance of the law.
“It is a good idea of Mrs. Curlewis’ to take this interest, but
the hindrance to adoption is that there is no law that gives the


child entirely to the adopted parent, but that is the great pride
of the British nation, that no mother can give her child away
permanently. These are things that must be looked at when you
are thinking of taking a baby. It is a big matter to deal with.”
Dr. Guy Griffiths: “Unfortunately, when once you begin
to legislate, the indirect effects of legislation always prove more
striking than the direct effects. Now, all these schemes for
endowing motherhood and supporting children by the State have
been tried. In the early part of the 19th century in England,
many of these schemes were tried in the Poor Law System, and
one of the unfortunate results was that the hard-working in-
dustrious, poor people were unable to marry because all their
earnings were taken to support the children of reckless and
dissolute people Unfortunately, it happens that, whenever
people can get somebody else to support them, they cease to
attempt to support themselves.
“It is a very sad thing, but there are two difficulties which
make it impossible to carry out all the schemes suggested to
provide completely for children. First of all, money cannot De
found, and secondly, a number of people who now provide for
their children, will cease to do so if they find the State will
undertake the responsibility. lam sorry to introduce a note of
discord, but it is necessary to point out that the proposals put
forward cannot be achieved simply and without complications.”
Dr. Marv Booth introduced the subject of the co-ordination
of infant and child welfare effort and said: “I feel it is
unnecessary to sav many words on this subject because,
especially as the Conference goes on, we have so many evi-
dences of the needs for such co-ordination. Many members
have expressed a wish that a permanent association for Infant
and Child Welfare should grow out of the Conference.
“The great value of such co-ordination, in my opinion, is that
the people engaged in the different societies shall get oppor-
tunities of knowing one another, and establishing the mutual
sympathy which talking over things together gives. I think
that is the surest way to prevent overlapping, and it would
mean that we would have opportunities .of getting a fuller
knowledge of the problems before us. We have had displayed
to us in these four sessions what these problems are, and how
verv far we are from the solution of any one of them. lam
sure that the indifference to these problems that is so widespread
arises from lack of knowledge, and in our State particularly,
from the fact that the State has' attempted to do so much or
rather promised to do so much. It has arrested voluntary
effort and the initiative of the citizens, and has made and is
making us an inert people.


“The idea Mrs. Curlewis’ paper brought before us appeals
to me very much indeed. I think it is quite practicable, in fact,
in a small way, we have begun with Centres for Soldiers’ Wives
and Mothers. These women are our special care while their
men are away.
“In regard to Child Welfare as a speciality. It is un-
necessary to say that in Europe, specialisation has gone farther
than we are attempting. The needs of children are special
problems of public health, and that is a good reason for forming
a special association as apart from general health organisations.
“Mr. Green outlined in his paper some of the work that
such association might take in hand; I hope that an association
will be formed to-night, and that we shall develop with careful
thought what is best for the children. We have resolved that
the existing carelessness must not go on here. Most of the
papers, as the programme of the Conference developed, dealt
with general principles. They have been on broad lines, and
they have given us a wider outlook. I feel the Conference has
been most fruitful.
Dr. Litchfield proposed: “That the members of this Con-
ference form themselves into an Infant and Child Welfare
Association, and that Lady Helen Munro Fergflson be asked to
be Patron. President, Dr. Clubbe; Patrons, Sir Philip Sydney
Jones, Sir Chas. McKellar, Mrs. Andrew Garran, Miss Rose
Scott; Vice-President, Mrs. Francis Anderson; Committee,
Dr. Arthur, Dr. Brennand, Dr. Guy Griffiths, Dr. Stevens,
Dr. Mary Booth, Mr. A. W. Green. Professor Welsh, Miss
Simpson. Miss R. Goldsmith, Dr. Litchfield, Miss Alice
Friend, Mr. John Sulman; with power to add to their number.
“This Conference has been an undoubted success, and I think
we cannot do better than form this association and continue the
good work. There has been a great fall in infantile mortality.
It has fallen from 12 to 7 per cent., which really means a con-
siderable fall. I have been greatly interested in this matter
for a long time I have been watching closely, and the con-
clusion I came to was that the climate had a great deal to do
with this fall. For instance, I found that the fall has been
universal; it has been in every state, in every district and corner
of the country. There has been a widspread influence at work.
The point is this, that a more unfavourable cycle of years may
strike us some day, and the infantile mortality may spring up
and give us a shock.”
Dr. Worrall seconded: “Hoped the Association would be
formed. The highest death-rate among children is caused by
gastro-enteritis (which is a preventive disease) due to the
apathy of parents, the apathy of the municipality, the apathy


of the Government and to the apathy of the profession to which
I belong.”
Lady (name not known) ; “I think this opportunity that has
come to us here in this Conference is one that we should not
miss.
“I think we shall be very amiss indeed if we allow it to pass.
We should find some means of crystalising the whole of these
discussions by some act or resolution on our part, by which we
can approach Parliament, and the legislation of this country.
After all, no matter what our arguments may be, it is only
through legislation that we can get what we want. What is
the use of us women thinking and talking amongst ourselves in
this way without putting it into action in some definite way.
Let us, now we have a National Government in power put it to
them, that every child is an asset to the nation.”
Dr. Guy Griffiths expressed the thanks of the meeting for
the honour Her Excellency Lady Helen Munro Ferguson had
conferred by opening the Conference. Also he wished to say
how much they appreciated the help they had had from the
President of the British Medical Association; from Mrs.
Francis Anderson and Dr. Brennand for taking the chair at
different meetings. The Honorable the Minister for Health,
for arranging a visit to a Baby Clinic; to Air. Knibbs. C.M.G.,
for coming especially from Melbourne to give his valuable
papers; to the Children's Department, Melbourne, for sending
Miss Murray; to the Committee of the Burnside Homes for the
visit arranged to the Homes; to the Kindergarten Union: to Mr.
Grove for the loan of an office; to W. Pepperday for printing;
and especially to the Press for its liberal notice of the doings
of the Conference.
Mr. Sulman seconded: “We have had many discussions
and various opinions have been expressed, and all are agreed
that the question of child welfare is of paramount importance
to the country. I would only like to add a sense of our in-
debtedness to Dr. Mary Booth for organising this Conference
and bringing us together.”

GENERAL COMMENTS.
On Density of Population and Vital Statistics.
(As shewn by General and Special Reports, also coloured maps
showing parks, schoolgrounds, &c.).
Mrs. E. R. Williams
Apart from the city of Sydney there is no legal prevention
of over-crowding in the metropolitan area. With the in-
crease in factories, warehouses, &c., within the city, there is a
natural squeezing'of the people into the nearer suburbs, with
a result that, while there is a decline in population in the city,
there is a corresponding increase, with all the evils attendant
upon overcrowding, in the municipalities adjacent to the city.
One means of remedying this would be to make the
Building Ordinance under the Local Government Act com-
pulsory' instead of optional.
The Municipality of Waterloo may be taken as an example
of how statistics can mislead if not carefully considered. For
while the density of population is only 14 per cent, per acre
for the whole municipality, the N. and W. wards, which are
nearest to the city, show a density of 75 per cent, to the acre.
The general tendency' is for congestion of this nature to
gradually force its way forward, carrying with it such an
increase in the value of land as enriches a few landlords at
the expense of the well-being of the whole community'.
Birth-rate: In 1916 the birth-rate for the metropolitan
area (Sydney and suburbs including Kuring-gai Shire), was
4 per cent, below the average of the preceding 5 y'ears, and
is the lowest since 1910. (Vital Statistics, N.S.W.).
Against this it is to be noted that the number of children
under 1 year of age who died during 1916, was 7 per cent,
below the average of the previous 5 years, which is especially'
gratifying as those years were all of exceptionally low infantile
mortality.
Death-rate: For 1915 the death-rate for illegitimate child-
ren was 141.0 (141) per thousand births, as compared with
64.2 in the case of legitimate children. Excluding diseases
which may be ascribed to inherent weakness, there is strong
evidence of neglect or want of care as regards illegitimate
children. Infantile debility showed 47.3 per thousand births,
as against the legitimate rate 27.7. Diarrhoea and enteritis
were 52.6 as compared with 15.4: respiratory' diseases 8.2, as
compared with 6.6; and syphilis 4.5. as compared with 0.3.
No great difference is exhibited between the legitimate and
illegitimate rates for epidemic diceases. (Vital Stat., N.S.W.
Govt.).
School children, In the metropolitan area for 1914—0 f
24,195 pupils attending public schools, 12,940 were notified as
defectives (after medical inspection). Of 3,778 pupils attend-
ing private schools, 2,142 were notified as defectives. Total,
27,973; defectives, 15,082, or approximately 54 per cent.
