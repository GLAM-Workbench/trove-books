m Spain both the Right and the Left so thoroughly disgraced themselves in
the turns they took in trying to govern their country before the Right
revolted, that it is impossible to say which of them is the more incompetent.
Spain must choose for itself: it is really not our business, though of course
our Capitalist Government has done everything it possibly could to help
General Franco. las a Communist am generally on the Left; but that
does not commit me to support the British Party Parliament system, and its
continental imitations, of which I have the lowest opinion.
At present the Capitalist powers seem to have secured a victory over the
General by what they call their non-interference, meaning their very active
interference on his side; but it is unlikely that the last word will be with
him. Meanwhile I shall not shout about it.

THE QUESTION
To the Writers and Poets of England, Scotland, Ireland
and Wales
It is clear to many of us throughout the whole world
that now, as certainly never before, we are deter-
mined or compelled, to take sides. The equivocal
attitude, the Ivory Tower, the paradoxical, the ironic
detachment, will no longer do.
We have seen murder and destruction by Fascism in
Italy, in Germany—the organisation there of social
injustice and cultural death —and how revived, imperial
Rome, abetted by international treachery, has con-
quered her place in the Abyssinian sun. The dark
millions in the colonies are unavenged.
To-day, the struggle is in Spain. To-morrow
it may be in other countries—our own.
But there are some who, despite the martyrdom of
Durango and Guernica, the enduring agony of Madrid,
of Bilbao, and Germany’s shelling of Almeria, are
still in doubt, or who aver that it is possible that
Fascism may be what it proclaims it is:
“the saviour of civilisation”.
This is the question we are asking you:
Are you for, or against, the legal Government
and the People of Republican Spain ?
Are you for, or against, Franco and Fascism ?
For it is impossible any longer to take no side.
Writers and Poets, we wish to print your answers. We
wish the world to know what you, writers and poets,
who are amongst the most sensitive instruments of a
nation, feel.


PUBLISHER’S NOTE
It has proved impossible to include all the answers
received, in response to the hundreds of “ Questions ”
sent out, within the limits of a sixpenny pamphlet.
In the task of selection, the editor has depended
entirely on the most complete guide available —the
‘ Reference Catalogue of Current Literatureso that
in no instance has an Answer been omitted on grounds
of “ policy(As the reader will see at the first
glance, the overwhelming majority of authors are ‘FOR
THE GOVERNMENTand it so happens that all the
answers omitted fall under the same head.) This
publication is, therefore, both representative and impor-
tant, since it reflects faithfully the frame of mind of
British authors to-day.
‘ Left Review ’ will be glad to receive, with a view to
publication, statements from any established authors
whom the original question did not reach.


THE ANSWERS
FOR
THE GOVERNMENT
Lascelles Abercrombie
the war in Spain is crucial for Europe and civilisation. lam for the legal
Government and true nationalism inspired by social justice and free culture.
I am against Franco and the forces of international Fascism which, mas-
querading as patriotism, intend a ruthless domination of property and
privilege—in an alliance of obscurantist religion, conscienceless finance,
and brutish militarism.
Valentine Ackland
fascism is symptomatic of the sick man’s will to self-destruction: artists
live to resist this will, they express the fight of the living people for life,
against death.
I stand with the People and Government of Spain. Against Fascism
always. Against confused thinking and cowardice. For the artist’s most
important qualities of reason and tenacious courage.
Mulk Raj Anand
all the truth of my being, all the intensity of passion of which I am
capable urges me to tell you that I stand for the People of Republican
Spain against Franco and Fascism; that I feel that in this tragic hour of
Spain’s destiny, in the moment of her utmost suffering, it is the duty of
all of us to look into our consciences and inquire whether we can sit still
and see the flower of Spain’s manhood sacrificed before the greed of a
few who dream of power and feed their insatiable lust for glory and wealth
on the blood of men, women and children.


Martin Armstrong
I am on the side of the legal Government and the People of Republican
Spain. I am against Franco because I am against the Spanish priesthood,
Spanish landlords and Fascism, and I am against Fascism because I am
against any form of tyranny, persecution and narrow nationalism.
W. H. Auden
I support the Valencia government in Spain because its defeat by the
forces of International Fascism would be a major disaster for Europe.
It would make a European war more probable; and the spread of Fascist
Ideology and practice to countries as yet comparatively free from them,
which would inevitably follow upon a Fascist victory in Spain, would
create an atmosphere in which the creative artist and all who care for
justice, liberty and culture would find it impossible to work or even exist.
Jenny Ballou
I am for the legal government and the People of Republic Spain and
against Franco and Fascism, against the cultural night these names spell.
The struggle in Spain has X-rayed the lies upon which our civilisation is
built. Those writers who pretend not to see are, at the risk of their per-
sonal destruction as artists, betrayers of their own kind.
George Barker
I am for the people of Republican Spain, for the people of China, for
the people of England, for the people of Germany, etc. I am against
Fascism, Franco, Mussolini, Japanese Generals, Hitler, Walter Chrysler,
the Archbishop of Canterbury, etc.
Leonard Barnes
certainly I am wholly for the Spanish Government and wholly against
Franco and his allies. But I remember that Fascism in Italy and Germany
is largely the outcome of policies pursued by capitalist interests and
Governments in Britain, France and America. Moreover, British rule in
India and Africa is a form of Fascism just as barbarous as the German
or Italian. For Britons, therefore, the enemy is not merely the ambition
of a Mussolini or a Hitler, but also the general structure and functioning
of the British Empire itself, as now organised.
Samuel Beckett
i UPTHEREPUBLIC !
J. D. Beresford
while I have no particular admiration or sympathy for the methods of
Spain’s legal Government, I oppose with all the forces of which I am
capable any spread of Fascism.


Pearl Binder
to-day the future of European Culture is being decided on Spanish soil.
All sincere writers must support the legal Spanish Government in its heroic
struggle for learning and liberty against the dark forces of General Franco.
Ralph Fox was one of us.
Oswell Blakeston
fascism is what men used to call “original sin.” It is the essential core
of evil in each of us. If we can rid the world of Fascism, we may know
what men used to call heaven. If we do not, we will get our Hell as others
have already found theirs.
Kay Boyle
i am against fascism and its exponents as symbols of a material and not
a spiritual triumph; I am against Franco and for the people of Spain.
I am for the people of every country who have, because of a tradition of
ignorance (or because of colour), been exploited and betrayed.
Lionel Britton
the world is faced with disruption because men do not realise that
privileges cannot be retained for ever. In a last attempt to save their
privileges against the rising tide of men, the privileged classes are giving
up the only thing that makes life worth while—freedom. Some freedom
must be given up for the sake of order, because without order civilisation
is impossible; but this is not intelligent unless we receive from the collec-
tive order more freedom than we individually give up.
The Spanish Government was a legal government, elected by majority
opinion; and though majorities are not always right, to suppress this by
force where it cannot be done by argument, is to revert to the practices
of ages we now consider uncivilised.
Fenner Brock way
fascism is the climax of the cruelty and the tyranny of Capitalism. This
is shewn by the infamies of Hitler, Mussolini and Franco. I wholeheartedly
support the struggle of the Spanish workers and peasants to defeat Franco,
and hope that they will make a permanent job of it by carrying through
the social revolution, and so destroy the Capitalism which is the parent
of Fascism.
Alec Brown
i am for the government of Republican Spain, because it is clearly the
Government elected by a nation striving towards greater freedom and
activity of thought, hence improved human life; lam opposed to all forms


of Fascism and conservative forms of government, because invariably
they trammel thought, hence hamper mankind’s struggle for improved
life.
George Buchanan
your question appears to call on writers to step down from their Ivory
Towers. Not being resident in one, I cannot make the appropriate gesture.
I do not regard Fascism as the “saviour of civilisation”, and desire to
see the Spanish people free from civil war and oppression.
Gerald Bullett
as one who has NO political axe to grind, is attached to no political
party, and detests all tyrannical government whether it be of the Right
or of the Left, I believe that the subjugation of the People of Republican
Spain by Franco and his foreign confederates will, if it is effected, mark
the end of freedom and civilisation in Europe. Fascism—which in practice
is merely gangsterism on a national scale—involves the enslavement of
peoples, the destruction of culture, and the persecution of all real religion.
And it depends for its continued existence on the perpetual fomentation
of new wars. In the light of recent history, and of history now in the
making, I am astonished that any man or woman of good will can remain
blind to these plain facts.
Thomas Burke
I know nothing of the rights and wrongs of the struggle in Spain; but I
am for social justice, a fair standard of life, and freedom of opinion, for
the People of all countries. I am against the regimentation of the People,
under whatever name it operates.
Arthur Calder-Marshall
as writer, I oppose Fascism as the enemy of the arts. As politician,
I work against Fascism because it tries to keep by tyranny a class system
now as obsolete as it was always unjust. As man, I hate Fascism because
it destroys all the best in life and the lives of all the best.
Their free spirit now articulate after centuries of oppression, the Spanish
People fight not for themselves only, but for all who prize freedom.
Sir Peter Chalmers-Mitchell
fascism is A pathological condition, a disease of Society. Unfortunately
it is contagious. Its leading symptoms are exaggerated selfishness and
moral atrophy. In its more virulent phase, as in Germany, Italy and
Spain, it glorifies and justifies crime. In its weaker forms, as in the British
Government and the majorities of the two Houses of Parliament, it appears
as a complacent and selfish cowardice. But it is the same disease, and
I fear that a very slight change in economic conditions would produce
the virulent phase even in England.


Norman Cliff
Foreign Editor, News Chronicle
I am with the common people of Spain in their almost unaided struggle
through blood and tears for liberty, decency and civilisation against
Fascist tyranny, military insanity and imported savagery.
Margaret Cole
the cause of the war in Spain, and the actions of Fascist Powers with
regard to it, have made it clear to everyone who cares for democracy,
liberalism, or culture, that Fascism is determined to wipe these out by
every possible means, both of brutal violence and lying propaganda.
Those who doubt should read or listen to the speeches of the rebel generals
and their foreign supporters: this should be enough for anyone who cares
at all for civilisation.
Norman Collins
i abhor with all my heart the terrible action of Franco and his sup-
porters, who by their merciless campaign against men, women and children
are daily adding new horrors to the world’s history, and are threatening
to submerge Western Europe in the barbarism of the Middle Ages.
Cyril Connolly
fascism is the first process by which the cynical few exploit the idealism
of the many, by violence and propaganda through the use of a dictator.
Its aim is to maintain the status of the rich by using the poor to fight
battles. This cannot be done until the whole nation is rendered both
warlike and servile. Those who will not make soldiers are not required;
those who are not required are eliminated. What we can learn from Spain
is the order and extent of that elimination before the stultifying of the
human race can proceed. Intellectuals come first, almost before women
and children. It is impossible therefore to remain an intellectual and admire
Fascism, for that is to admire the intellect’s destruction, nor can one
remain careless and indifferent. To ignore the present is to condone the
future.
A. E. Coppard
I am FOR the republic of Spain and its rightful government.
I am AGAINST the invasion by Italy and Germany, and AGAINST the
massacres by their flunkey Franco.
Most of all I am against the cold-blooded Tartuffe that watches the
murder from the fence, and under the plea of keeping the ring dainty for
democracy devotes the upholders of its “honour” to the perils of a Tattoo
and the blasphemy of “Abide with Me.”


Alastair Crowley
do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.
Franco is a common murderer and pirate; should swing in chains at
Execution Dock.
Mussolini, the secret assassin, possibly worse.
Hitler may prove a “prophet”; time will judge.
Love is the law, love under will.
The late Brigadier-General Crozier
there is only one thing that can save civilisation and that is civilisation.
Rating, as I do, Fascism as an anti-social evil I am accordingly opposed
thereto. On the other hand, in Communism I detect the hand of Christ.
W. P. Crozier
Editor, Manchester Guardian
I have to make it a rule to express my opinion on political questions
through the paper. I am afraid I must keep to my rule in this case also,
although I imagine that from the paper my opinions are well known.
A. J. Cummings
Political Editor, News Chronicle
emphatically i am for the Government and People of Spain and against
Franco and Fascism. If Fascism wins in Europe all that is worth while
in modern civilisation must perish.
Nancy Cunard
it is as unthinkable for any honest intellectual to be pro-Fascist as it
is degenerate to be for Franco, the assassin of the Spanish and Arab people.
Spain is not “politics” but life; its immediate future will affect every
human who has a sense of what life and its facts mean, who has respect
for himself and humanity. Above all others the writer, the intellectual,
must take sides. His place is with the people against Fascism; his duty,
to protest against the present degeneration of the democracies.
C. Day Lewis
the struggle in Spain is part of a conflict going on now all over the world.
I look upon it quite simply as a battle between light and darkness, of
which only a blind man could be unaware. Both as a writer and as
a member of the Communist Party I am bound to help in the fight against
Fascism, which means certain destruction or living death for humanity.
Cedric Dover
the success of republican Spain would make another revolutionary
advance in human progress. It would cripple European Fascism even
if it did not kill it. It would encourage those suffering millions who


know the yoke of colonial Fascism. It would inspire the proletariat, the
depressed peoples and the true intellectuals of the world. To support
the Spanish Republic, to share its struggle as intimately as we can, is
therefore an honour and a duty.
Havelock Ellis
in reply —While I recognise that there are good men on both sides, I am
myself decisively on the side of the legal Government and against Franco
and the Fascists.
Liam O’ Flaherty
I am for the legal government and the people of Republican Spain
against Franco and Fascism. As an Irishman I realise that the toiling
masses of Spain are waging the same struggle which we have waged for
centuries in Ireland against landlordism and foreign Imperialism.
Long live the Republic in Spain and all over the earth.
Ford Madox Ford
I am unhesitatingly for the existing Spanish Government and against
Franco’s attempt—on every ground of feeling and reason. In addition,
as the merest commonsense, the Government of the Spanish, as of any
other nation, should be settled and defined by the inhabitants of that
nation. Mr. Franco seeks to establish a government resting on the arms
of Moors, Germans, Italians. Its success must be contrary to world
conscience.
William Forrest
I am a labourer’s son. I am a trade unionist. I am a writer. The labourers
of Spain, los pobres y humildes, the trade unionists of Spain, the writers
of Spain—all these are my comrades, my brothers. And you ask me
where I stand, with them or against them ? In the name of God !
Suffering, struggling, stoic
People of Spain,
All your split blood heroic
Is not in vain.
No, spilt not in vain.
Hamilton Fyfe
that the fight in Spain is between the forces of freedom, democracy,
justice, and the forces of reaction, tyranny, obscurantism, admits of no
doubt. It would be a disaster for all who believe in the right of People
to decide for themselves their own destinies, if Fascism were to win.
It must not win I


William Gallacher, M.P.
I am for the People’s Government of Spain and for the Spanish People,
The Fascist hordes around Franco, representing all the evil forces of
Europe, must be driven out of Spain—out of Europe.
All lovers of Peace and Progress should support the legal Spanish
Government in their great task.
This is the first step towards the complete defeat of Fascism.
Douglas Garman
of course I have “taken sides”. I hate Fascism as I hate all barbarism,
because it sets out to destroy everything which I love, admire and enjoy.
I believe in the cause for which the Spanish Government is fighting because
it is the cause of all who subscribe to the principles of Socialism.
David Garnett
the question whether I am for or against a military adventurer who calls
in the weapons of foreign despots against his own people appears to me
to have been settled a century or two before I was born. I am an English-
man and a liberal who has always enjoyed personal liberty and been free
to think and speak as he likes. I cannot conceive a tolerable world with-
out such freedom.
The question for Englishmen and Frenchmen to-day is not whether
they are for or against Fascism, but when they will have to fight in defence
of their liberty against the German and Italian dictatorships and with
what weapons. What we have to consider is the strategy necessary to
defeat the disciplined but rather top-heavy enemies of liberty.
Marcus Garvey
fascism is the cult of organised murder, invented by the arch-enemies
of society. It tends to destroy civilisation and revert man to his most
barbarous state. Mussolini and Hitler might well be called the devils
of an age, for they are playing hell with civilisation.
David Gasgoyne
one would have to be devoid of the most elementary feelings for decency
and justice in order to preserve an attitude of indifference towards the
inhuman gangster warfare being waged by Fascism against the people
of Spain and their elected Government.
Louis Golding
I am for the legal government and the People of Republican Spain,
which means I am against Franco and Fascism. I would be against Franco
if I were the most dyed-in-the-wool jingo flag-wagger. But that is not
my reason. I am against him because he is a fist of Hitler; or at least, a
little finger. Ecrasez I’infdme I


Douglas Goldring
I was perhaps the first English writer to see Fascism in action, in
Ireland, 1919-1921. The Black and Tans invented “Shot while trying to
escape”, and many other familiar horrors subsequently copied by Hitler
and Mussolini. I have spent nearly twenty years of my life, as a writer,
trying to warn the younger generation against what is in store for them
if they persist in pursuing the “good time” or trying to live in (with
apologies to my old friend the late Mary Butts) “Crystal Cabinets” or
“Ivory Towers”.
As my convictions have remained unchanged since, in 1919, I was the
English secretary of Henri Barbusse’s “Clarte” movement, you can be
certain that I am against Fascism wherever it appears, against Franco and
for the legal Government and the people of Republican Spain. Fourteen
years ago I spent a spring in a Mallorcan “anarchist” or co-operative
fishing village. It was a paradise; without crime, distress, repression or
“Loranorder”. Spain will, no doubt, be crushed by the dead weight
of Fascist bombs. But in the end Spain is unconquerable, superb, humanity’s
chief hope. No pasardn.
Victor Gollancz
of course I am for the legal Government and the people of Republican
Spain.
Of course I am against Franco and Fascism.
Fascism is culturally and intellectually a species of dementia praecox—
a refusal any longer to carry the burden of being human, and a slipping
back, happy sometimes but always disgusting, into the primeval slime.
The writer, poet or artist who says the whole thing is no concern of his
is either a knave or a fool, or more probably both.
Geoffrey Gorer
as A writer, as an anthropologist, as an Englishman and as a human
being, I am convinced that the triumph of Franco—or rather of the powers
that are backing him—would be an overwhelming disaster for the human
race as a whole; it would render the position of Englishmen even more
perilous than it is to-day; the explicit anti-scientific attitude would render
anthropology impossible; and the atmosphere fostered in Fascist countries
makes creative art almost an impossibility.
Geoffrey Grigson
Editor, New Verse
for potted shrimps in the club, for reading the Manchester Guardian,
for holding hands in the cinema, we are paying willingly with the lies,
the insolence and the cynicism hung between us and intervention in Spain.
I am equivocal enough to be against politically, and not for, to fear
and distrust any mass in its own control; but for me Hitler, Mussolini


and Franco are man-eating mass-giants issuing from mediocrity and
obscenity. I believe it better to risk “destroying civilisation” than to
live and profit in a civilisation of Baldwinian lies by throwing them victims.
Carmel Haden Guest
(1) I am for the people of Republican Spain because they are the real
patriots who are defending the independence of their country.
(2) I am for the legal Government because it stands for liberty and
democracy.
(3) I am against Fascism because it means international war, slavery of the
workers, suppression of art and culture and the degradation of women.
James Hanley
(1) I am against the Franco Insurgents for I believe it to be a very real
danger to the constitution of an organised democracy.
(2) I am against all forms of Fascist dictatorship as they constitute a
real threat not only to the freedom of man and men, but also to the intel-
lect and the culture we value as one of the great fruits of human life and
endeavour.
Tom Harrisson
the equivocal attitude, the Ivory Tower, the paradoxical, the ironic
detachment, are words your letter uses to sway with superstitious feeling
our immediate judgment. But even without them we must feel horror
and terror and hate at that Franco, saviour of civilisation, who uses the
weapons of science to prosper the principles of confounded superstition.
Science is seldom evocative, starts always from doubt. It does not end
in doubt. There is no doubt about Guernica. Science can only work
with detachment; that is not equivocal or ivory, but its effects are more
than ironic. You, who are interested in man’s future states, must realise
this: the iron age is over.
Robert Herring
Editor, Life and Letters To-day
as journalists and human beings, we consider it to be taken for granted
that we are against Franco and Fascism.
Harold Heslop
the only answer to the Fascist attack on culture and on Spain which a
writer ought to give is; Down with the Fascist Monsters. With the blood
of the people of Spain is being written a chapter of human history which
will remain imperishable through time. I join with my comrades of the
pen with the Spanish people in the war on Mussolini, Hitler, Franco and
their allies.


R. P. Hewett
writers have always been more progressive than their society. The
non-political writer is a modern myth, born of fear and obscurantism.
But Addis Ababa, Guernica, and Tientsin have opened the eyes of even
the most escapist writers, and the immediate menace of Fascism forces
every one of us to take up an uncompromising attitude against Fascism
and in defence of Spain, which must be expressed in our work.
Jack Hilton
for the people of Republican Spain.
Against Franco and Fascism.
Yes. Yes. Yes.
J. L. Hodson
i am opposed to fascism as I am opposed to any dictatorship either of the
Right or Left. I oppose any system of government which deprives the
individual of liberty of speech or writing. In so far as the Government of
Spain is one of liberal or socialistic principles, I support it. I am against
Franco.
Lancelot Hogben
the brutal attack upon the constituted authority of Spain’s democratic
Government by Franco’s Moorish legionaries is a challenge to democracy,
to decency and to constructive social effort in all countries where Fascism
has not yet trampled on intellectual freedom.
Laurence Housman
i am wholly opposed to fascism, as a negation of religious and civil
liberty, but I do not think that legal governments are sacred things. The
Spanish Government was provocative, and threatened to secure its reforms
by unconstitutional methods before rebellion started. Had it been con-
structively pacifist from the beginning, I do not think that the present
disastrous position of affairs would have come about.
I think it is a mistake to pretend that legal government is so sacred.
I would advocate a national strike against our own Government if I
thought it would succeed, even though a national strike has been made
illegal.
Brian Howard
a people, nearly half of whom has been denied the opportunity to learn
to read, is struggling for bread, liberty and life against the most unscrupulous
and reactionary plutocracy left in existence. Utterly unable to crush this
people alone, their enemies have hired foreign mercenaries, whose govern-
ments self-confessedly covet Spain’s raw materials, to butcher whole civilian
communities. With all my anger and love, lam for the People of Repub-
lican Spain,


Aldous Huxley
my sympathies are, of course, with the Government side, especially the
Anarchists; for Anarchism seems to me much more likely to lead to
desirable social change than highly centralised, dictatorial Communism.
As for “taking sides”—the choice, it seems to me, is no longer between
two users of violence, two systems of dictatorship. Violence and dictator-
ship cannot produce peace and liberty; they can only produce the results
of violence and dictatorship, results with which history has made us only
too sickeningly familiar.
The choice now is between militarism and pacifism. To me, the necessity
of pacifism seems absolutely clear.
E. Ibbetson James
I am for the legal Government and the People of Republican Spain.
I am against Franco and Fascism.
To take any other view is, in my opinion, to be false to the 800 year
traditions of the English people, and to the present vital interests of the
British Empire.
C. L. R. James
against fascism, against Franco, but against bourgeois democracy too.
For the independent action of the workers in the struggle for a Soviet
Spain, the defence of the U.S.S.R., and international Socialism.
Norah C. James
I am for the legal government and the People of Republican Spain
and against Franco and Fascism. What other attitude can anybody who
cares about humanity adopt ? Nationalism, hatred and war are the inevit-
able growths of Fascism.
Storm Jameson
it ought to be impossible to find any writer willing to admit that he is
for Franco and Fascism. This hideous war, which is murdering Spain
and may let war loose again over the whole of Europe, is the deliberate
act of the two Fascist dictators, and avowed by them as such. It is an
act they will not hesitate to repeat. Civilisation, the civilisation of the
mind and the heart, is threatened with utter ruin by this doctrine which
exalts violence and uses incendiary bombs to fight ideas. For any writer
to support it is plain treachery and worse, if there is anything worse.
C. E. M. Joad
i agree that it is the duty of every writer, of every artist and of every
thinker to regard Fascism as the arch-enemy. The success of Fascism is
the collapse of civilisation and the relapse into barbarism.


It is by virtue of his reason and his spirit that man is separated from
the beasts: truth is the specific good of reason; beauty, of the spirit.
Fascism suppresses truth and oppresses the spirit. Those who care for
these goods must use all their powers to repel that which threatens them.
Arthur Koestler
other wars consist of a succession of battles; this war is a succession
of tragedies, with the Spanish folk as the victim. Both Hitler and Mussolini
have publicly admitted that they wish Franco to win, and help him to
win; that means that the fact of foreign aggression in the territory of an
independent country is plainly established.
John Langdon-Davies
two things make the future real, the artist’s imagination and the
worker’s hope. Fascism destroys both. Therefore the artist and the worker
must unite to destroy Fascism. The Fascist artist is a traitor, the neutral
is already dead. Art and anti-Fascism are synonymous.
Professor Harold J. Laski
i regard the defeat of General Franco as vital to the interest of demo-
cratic freedom over the whole world. He symbolises a combination of
feudal privilege, ecclesiastical obscurantism, and economic reaction, the
victory of which would encourage all the dark forces against which
civilisation is contending.
F. Le Gros Clark
(Committee Against Malnutrition)
all my sense of logic and belief in progress throws me utterly upon the
side of the Spanish Government. Life is to-day a struggle between progress,
which is an absolute good, and reaction, superstition and tyranny, which
are absolute evils. There can be no neutrality or quarter. We had better
settle down to a realisation that our fife-times are going to be ones of
intense struggle; and realising this, we had better choose our sides and
plunge into the battle.
John Lehmann
Editor, New Writing
of course I am for the legal Government and the People of Spain. No
writer who is trying to create for the future, and not merely dabbling in
outworn forms and sentiments, can be on any other side.
Rosamund Lehmann
with all my mind and heart I am against Franco and Fascism, and
for the legal Government and the people of Republican Spain. As a mother,
I am convinced that upon the outcome of the struggle in Spain depends


the future, the very life of my children. Up till now a pacifist in the fullest
sense, I have come to feel that non-resistance can be—in this case, is—a
negative, a sterile, even a destructive thing.
Fascism, whose main principle is the sacrifice of the People to the
State, must in the last analysis attack what are called the humanities.
Culture, which has been violently destroyed in Italy and Germany, is in
mortal danger even here, even in England. Not only as an internationalist,
but as an English writer, I must choose to bear my part in the defence of
culture against Fascism.
Professor H. Levy
THE BURNING of the Books,
The Crucifixion of Abyssinia,
The Destruction of Guernica,
all bear witness to the barbaric onslaught of Fascism on Culture and
Civilisation.
As a scientist seeking to harness knowledge to human progress, I take
my stand with those who fight against the savagery symbolised by Hitler,
Mussolini and Franco.
Jack Lindsay
I believe fascism to be utterly evil and destructive. I stand with every
fibre of my being for the People of Spain against the murderous attack
of the feudalist remnants backed by Hitler and Mussolini for their im-
perialist world-war purposes; I believe this is an epic conflict in which
ideas like Freedom and Culture leap out with a new tremendous urgency,
an irresistible demand on our loyalty. To be above the battle, when such
a cause is concerned, is to be sub-human.
Eric Linklater
my sympathy is with the people and government of Republican Spain.
I am against Fascism and Franco and all who set the mythical value of
an imaginary totality above the intellect and freedom of the individual.
To European civilisation Fascism is as dreary and dreadful a peril as
another Flood—and the Ark of the Covenant has unhappily been scuttled.
F. L. Lucas
civilisation was built by the free individual, shaking off the tribe and
the tribal god; now, losing nerve, he flees back to their shadow. Fascism,
CcEsarism, are the cocaine of a Petite Bourgeoisie afraid of social justice,
of science, of progress, of itself. Together Rome and “Nordic” barbarism
are thrusting back the new Spain into the dungeon of the Middle Age
and making of Madrid a new auto-da-fe.
Rose Macaulay
AGAINST FRANCO.


Hugh Macdiarmid
i am A member of the Communist Party and wholly on the side of the
legal Government and the People of Republican Spain—as are the vast
majority of the people of Scotland, where at successive General Elections
a majority of the total poll has been cast for Socialism, and where—if we
had had national independence—we too would have had a Socialist
Republican Government long ago. Practically all the Scottish writers of
any distinction to-day are of the same way of thinking. But for the con-
nection with England, Fascism would never be able to raise its head in
Scotland itself. If we are subjected to a Fascist terror in Scotland, the
London Government will be to blame, as it is mainly to blame for the
horrible tragedy inflicted on our Spanish comrades—a tragedy which must,
and will, be turned yet into a glorious victory over the Principalities and
Powers of Darkness, and end with the liquidation of Franco and all his
fellow-murderers.
A. G. Macdonell
question 1. You bet your life I’m for the legal Government and People
of Republican Spain in their struggle against Reaction, Prussia, the Moors
and the heroes of Capretto and Guadalajara.
question 2. You bet your life I’m against Franco and all Fascists in
whatever country they may be found.
Louis MacNeice
I support the Valencia government in Spain. Normally I would only
support a cause because I hoped to get something out of it. Here the
reason is stronger; if this cause is lost, nobody with civilised values may
be able to get anything out of anything.
Charles Madge
I wholeheartedly support the Government and the People of Spain in
their struggle against Fascist repression and terror.
Tom Mann
i am entirely for the legal Government and the People of Republican
Spain; I am determinedly against Fascism, and also against Franco, its
Spanish champion. I am with you one hundred per cent and thank you
heartily for taking the present action.
Ethel Mannin
I am for the legal government of Spain inasmuch as I am against
Franco and Fascism, and that passionately, but with the defeat of Franco
I hope for very much more than a mere Republican Spain (with the old
bourgeois capitalist Government still in power)—for the establishmen


of a Workers’ State, not on Communist (U.S.S.R.) lines, but C.N.T.-F.A.I.
(Anarcho-Syndicalist).
Francis Meynell
there can be no honour without freedom of choice. There can be no
art without freedom of expression. There can be no life without freedom
of growth. There can be no love without freedom of opportunity. There
can be no spiritual adventure without the freedom of expectation. The
Fascist philosophy forbids all these. And most Fascists have proved them-
selves to be not philosophers but sadists.
You say, “It may be our turn next.” It is our turn now —if “us” and
“our” mean the fellowship of those who prefer poetry to bayonet practice.
Naomi Mitchison
there is no question for any decent, kindly man or woman, let alone a
poet or writer, who must be more sensitive. We have to be against Franco
and Fascism and for the people of Spain, and the future of gentleness
and brotherhood which ordinary men and women want all over the world.
Ivor Montagu
fox-hunters, people who shoot down birds, dukes, bankers, like Franco.
Cocktail parties are given for him.
If there were no other good reason—with the Republic you find better
company.
Should we sleep while others are raving and winning the world, who
will bother to wake us ?
Elinor Mordaunt
of course i object most strongly to any form of despotism—and I think
that no possible hell could be bad enough for Franco and his kind who
have launched such horrors on their own people. As for Fascism I believe
it would be the worst terror Europe has ever known if it once cuts right
across it.
In Kingslake’s History of the Crimea you will find the words: “When
England is weak there is no peace in Europe.”
Louise Morgan
i am of my time. Not, like some, an anachronism. Deep in my heart as
well as my brain is a sense of exultation at the struggle upwards of the
human mass. That is why, if I were free, I would be giving all my time
to help the People of Spain against Franco and Fascism.
Raymond Mortimer
since i believe in the supreme importance and value of minorities; since
I believe that the scientist and the artist have the right and the duty to


make public their work, whether or not this meets with the approval of
the Government; since I believe that the future of civilisation depends upon
the extension of individual liberty; I necessarily regard Fascism as the
self-declared enemy of the human race.
Willa Muir
I am against franco and on the side of Republican Spain, because I
desire to see individuals growing up undistorted by economic or other
pressure, free to develop creatively in a creative environment that fosters
new life. For that reason I am against capitalism in general.
John Middleton Murry
I am wholly for the Spanish Government, and against Franco. But that
does not mean that I am for British intervention on behalf of the Govern-
ment: I am opposed to that in any form. But I believe that the present
system of “non-intervention” is very unjust to the Spanish Government.
(June 17, 1937)
Henry W. Nevinson
LL.D., D.Litt., Ex War Correspondent
I am opposed to dictatorships and Tyranny in any form. I detest the
cruel systems of persecution and suppression now existing under Hitler in
Germany, Mussolini in Italy, and Stalin in Russia. Consequently I detest
the tyrannical system which Franco, with the hardly concealed assistance
of Germany and Italy, is endeavouring to establish in Spain. I also regard
it as a most serious danger to British interests in the Mediterranean.
Robert Nichols
in my opinion both Fascism and Communism make for spiritual and
intellectual bondage. Therefore insofar as the Spanish Republican Govern-
ment is non-Communist I am in its favour and opposed to Franco and
the more so as Franco’s party appears to be narrowly nationalistic.
Sean O’Casey
i am, of course, for a phalanx unbreakable round those who think and
work for all men, and I am with the determined faces firing at the steel-
clad slug of Fascism from the smoke and flame of the barricades.
George Padmore
the sympathy of Africans and other colonial peoples naturally goes out
to the toiling masses of Spain in their heroic struggle against Fascist-
barbarism, for they have not forgotten Abyssinia. And precisely because
of this, it is so regrettable that democratic Spain, by failing to make an
anti-imperialist gesture to the Moors, played into the hands of Franco.
This should be a reminder to the European workers that: “No people
who oppress another people can themselves be free.”


Herbert Palmer
i think the struggle in Spain is as much between Mithraism (revived)
and Socialist Christianity as it is between Fascism and Liberalism. Mithraism
is now called Fascism, but they differ in very few essentials. However
much we may suspect disintegrating and anarchical elements on the
Spanish Government and Communist side it is very clear that Franco’s
party is not on the side of the angels.
Sylvia Pankhurst
of course I am wxth you in the struggle against the Fascist war on Spain.
It is an attack on a people, the majority of whom had repeatedly declared
their aversion to dictatorship and their determination to throw off feudalism
and to advance to a freer, more equalitarian and more enlightened organi-
sation of society.
The Spanish war is in fact a war by two foreign Powers upon Spain,
aided by the reactionaries of Spain herself. The Spanish war is one sector
of the international struggle between Fascism and Democracy.
The author and the journalist are the first to whom the choice comes,
either to stand for Fascism or against it. Upon them rests the heaviest
of all responsibilities. They can defend the public mind and conscience
against the specious propaganda of this base reaction, or they can assist
the betrayal of the people to this greatest of all enemies.
Harry Pollitt
I am for the legal government and people of Republican Spain,
believing this Government to be the best custodian of the interests of the
Spanish people; of their democratic rights; for the carrying out of their
programme for social advance.
I am against Franco and Fascism as representing a bestial creed which
only exists on the basis of terror and violence which it directs against all
progressive organisations and people.
Raymond Postgate
I am wholly against franco and in favour of the Spanish workers; but
not for the reasons suggested in your manifesto, such as the horrors of
Durango, Guernica, Madrid or Bilbao. War means such atrocities, and
whoever begins the conflict they are soon committed on both sides.
Judgements given under the influence of such stories are unstable and
emotional decisions; I wish that every supporter of the Spanish Govern-
ment who relies on them would look into his mind and find a surer basis
for his opinion
The fight between Franco and the Spanish workers is a fight between
the capitalist, clerical and feudal owners and the exploited workers. It
is the class struggle between the rich and the poor, the exploiters and
the exploited, which has surely been sufficiently explained to everybody


by now. For that reason, even if all the atrocities were disproved, I would
still be on the side of Socialism.
Llewelyn Powys
I am unequivocally in favour of the legal Spanish Government and
opposed to Fascism and any other form of Government that seeks by
means of coercion to impose its arbitrary will upon its own or other peoples.
V. S. Pritchett
I am heart and soul for the People of Spain in their brave and stoical
resistance to Franco and Fascism. The lesson of Spain for the rest of
western Europe, even before this struggle, lay in the innate simplicity and
nobility of the uncorrupted common people. They have now burned this
lesson upon the imagination of us all.
D. N. Pritt, K.C., M.P.
the Spanish struggle is an international war, a struggle of the forces
of progress against the forces of reaction, and in that struggle none can
be neutral. All who value freedom and peace must make clear to the
world where their allegiance lies. I am against Franco and the dark forces
of Fascism which he represents. I am for the Spanish people and their
legal Government.
Herbert Read
in Spain, and almost only in Spain, there still lives a spirit to resist the
bureaucratic tyranny of the State and the intellectual intolerance of all
doctrinaires. For that reason all poets must follow the course of this
struggle with open and passionate partisanship.
Edgell Rickword
fascism has unmasked its ugly face in Spain as if to convince the waverers
that it is indeed a force of destruction and human degradation. Support
for the people of Spain and their legal Republican Government means
the triumph of life over death. It means the doom of the gangster, the
bully and the hypocrite, the birth of a free and happy world. And because
Fascism is all the power of the past striving to throttle the future, no
struggle ever called for greater courage and determination.
J. W. Robertson Scott, J.P.
Editor of The Countryman
from the beginning my sympathies have been warmly with the Govern-
ment of Spain in an unparalleled aggression of Italy and Germany and
from Africa, which, twenty years ago, no one would have believed Great
Britain and France would have endured; and I have gladly subscribed to
three of the funds.


Paul Rotha
i accuse Franco and other European Fascist Dictators as the enemies
of modern civilisation, its culture and its comradeship. I accuse all
Governments friendly to the Fascist cause as assassins of common sense
and decency. I protest my contempt for those who sit in apathy when the
very fundamental requisites of human existence are being massacred for
the sake of profit in the name of fear.
Militia of Bilbao, the International Column of Madrid, the steel-workers
of Chicago, the miners of Harworth, the workers of Germany, Italy and
the Soviet Union—l salute you all for your bravery IWe shall win !
Edward Sackville West
as A writer of Liberal opinions, I am ready to declare my abhorrence
of General Franco’s willingness to lay waste Spain in an attempt to destroy
the legal Republican Government of that country —and of Fascism in
general, as being retrograde and thus inimical to the best interests of
civilisation.
David Scott
I have just resigned the post of Paris Correspondent of The Times in
order to devote myself more effectively to the struggle against Fascism.
Whatever the faults, whatever the mistakes of the Spanish Republicans,
I am, as all who care for the progress of humanity must be, wholeheartedly
with them in their struggle to free their countrymen from tyranny and
superstition. Fascism means a return to the Dark Ages. It must be
resisted at all costs if our civilisation is to survive.
Naomi Royde Smith
I am against fascism in any form and think the Spanish people should
decide on their own form of Government without interference from any
other nation.
Stephen Spender
i am opposed to franco firstly because Franco and his supporters
represent the attempt of the aristocracy and clergy of Spain to prevent
the history of Spain developing beyond the Middle Ages. In opposing
their reaction, so far from being an extremist, I support the Protestantism
of intellectuals like the great Catholic writer Bergamin against the material-
ism of the Catholic Church in Spain; and I support in Spain exactly such
a movement of liberal and liberating nationalism as the English liberals
supported in many countries still groaning under feudalism in the nine-
teenth century.
Secondly, I am opposed to Franco, because, supported by Hitler and
Mussolini, he represents international Fascism. If Franco wins in Spain


Fascism will have gained the third great victory in an international war
which began in Manchuria, continued in Abyssinia, and may end in Spain.
If Franco wins, the principle of democracy will have received a severe
blow and the prospect of a new imperialist war, which is also a “war of
ideologies” will have been brought far nearer.
Olaf Stapledon
I support the Spanish government because, whatever its faults, it is
defending the oppressed and preserving culture. I believe that a British
Government sincerely sympathetic to Spain, or sincerely neutral, could
end Fascist aggression by firm diplomacy without causing a general war.
But firmness over Spain must be combined with readiness to internationalize
our own ill-gotten gains.
Christina Stead
franco, the traitor, image of his caste, with eighty per cent of the army
and desperate foreign allies expected to win back Spain for the landlords
in three days. The resistance of Spain’s Republican Government is a
guarantee of the eventual victory of the common peoples against these
sterile powers: but to shorten their struggle, we must expose the Fascists’
allies at home and abroad.
James Stephens
I am for Spain, and hope, with all my heart, for the defeat of her
rebellious military men and their Italian and Germanic abettors.
John Strachey
I am for the government and people of Republican Spain and against
Franco and Fascism. I believe that the struggle being waged by the Spanish
people is part of a world-wide struggle, which can only be ended by the
abolition of the present economic and social system and the rebuilding
of human society on the basis of Socialism.
Thomas Sturge Moore
i am for the legal Republican Government in Spain. I am against all
bullies whether Fascist or Communist. I am against Franco.
Hannen Swaffer
being an Englishman proud of the liberties won in the past by his own
race from people who were Fascists without knowing it, I am naturally
on the side of the legally elected Government of Spain and, therefore,
opposed to the cut-throats and murderers who forced civil war upon
Spanish people in the interests of runaway Royalty, rapacious landowners
and a discredited Church.


The Spanish Government, being human, has faults inseparable from
all human systems. Anyway, it is the beginning of an attempt to build
up for the Spanish people a new order of society. Therefore, it shines
resplendently in the eyes of all people who have sight with which to see.
Randall Swingler
I believe that culture has always been the directive force of man’s
progress towards freedom; that Fascism is destructive alike to culture and
to human progress; therefore that everyone who is for life and enlighten-
ment must be wholeheartedly implicated on the side of the Spanish People’s
Government, who struggle to save us from Fascism and war.
H. M. Tomlinson
AS we have nothing but the free use of the mind to bring order into chaos
and to give a meaning to life, then scientists and artists who support
dictatorships and absolutism are traitors to their own gifts. They would
nullify intelligence and knowledge. Better to be shot by such as Franco
than submit to anarchy and unreason.
Sylvia Townsend Warner
i am for the people of Spain, and for their Government, chosen by them
and true to them.
And I am against Fascism, because Fascism is based upon mistrust of
human potentialities. Its tyranny is an expression of envy, its terrorism
is an expression of fear.
Lawrence Vail
I am against fascism, whatever the tune or hue. I might understand it,
while resisting it, in countries where great numbers have the illusion they
must herd and submit in order to bolster the frailty of a maudlin pride.
Not so in Spain. The Fascist whip cuts across the grain of a proud race.
Franco’s victory would mean a dictatorship of a particularly blind, ruthless
brand and should be resisted at any cost.
Helen Waddell
I detest fascism, in Spain or elsewhere, in any of its disguises. I still
believe in a God who is the father of mankind: and I abhor the Moloch
of the Sovereign State. Any creed, religious or political, that will torture
a man’s body to coerce his mind is gangrenous: but the torturer and the
tortured have shirts of many colours.
I endorse every word of your letter but one: “unavenged”. That the
signatories should still, in 1937, be speaking of vengeance is a nightmare:
a return to Carthage, or Versailles.
Rex Warner
I am on the side of the Republican Government in Spain not only because
it is a legal and democratic Government, but because it represents the


forward movement of humanity and civilisation. I believe that Fascism,
so far from “saving” civilisation, attempts to arrest this forward move-
ment and consequently must drag humanity backwards towards a kind
of self-conscious barbarism.
Alick West
I am for the People of Republican Spain, and against Franco and Fascism,
because I am for freedom and culture against the tyranny of barbarism.
Rebecca West
I am for the legal Government of Republican Spain against Franco, since
Spain herself, at a properly conducted election, chose that Government
and rejected the party which now supports Franco.
I am also against Fascism: the reforms of Diocletian were a work of
genius and made many people temporarily happy, but failed in the end
and added greatly to human misery. I see no reason why this inferior
modern copy of them should succeed.
Antonia White
I am against fascism and any form of government or society which is
based on fear, violence, and the suppression of free enquiry.
Amabel Williams-Ellis
I am for the Republican Government of Spain, and against Franco and
all other Fascist leaders.
Clough Williams-Ellis
last spring I spent my summer holiday near Malaga, for love of Spain
and the Spanish people.
I have only this moment returned from Moscow whither I have been
(not for the first time) because I needed reassurance in a mad and menacing
world.
These two facts should indicate my attitude to Franco and Fascism.
Leonard Woolf
I am for the legal Government and people If Republican Spain and civilisa-
tion; I am against Franco, Fascism, antf oarbarism.


NEUTRAL?
Ruby M. Ayres
uninformed interference in international politics is more to be dreaded
than any anticipated danger resulting from the conflict in Spain.
As a professional writer I dread amateurs.
Vera Brittain
as an uncompromising pacifist, I hold war to be a crime against humanity,
whoever fights it and against whomever it is fought. I believe in liberty,
democracy, free thought and free speech. I detest Fascism and all that
it stands for, but I do not believe that we shall destroy it by fighting it.
And I do not feel that we serve either the Spanish people or the cause of
civilisation by continuing to make Spain the battle-ground for a new series
of Wars of Religion.
Robert Byron
you condemn the impartial view of politics. Perhaps you will allow me
an impartial view of myself. Had I been a Spaniard when the rebellion broke
out, I cannot say for certain that I would not have favoured it. Now that
it means Fascism I hope for its defeat. But my sympathies are with those
Spaniards on both sides, whose honesty, which you despise, brings their
loyalty and their reason into conflict. That is the fate of Falkland, and
there are many such in Spain to-day.
Rhys J. Davies, M.P.
you may collect the strongest words to be found in all the dictionaries
of every language extant to denounce Dictatorships and use them in my
name, provided you at the same time make it clear that the same words
shall apply to all Dictatorships alike, including those of the Right, the
Centre and the Left. I detest them all!
Norman Douglas
i don’t know what to say about your questionnaire. I cannot excite
myself over nations and causes and creeds —my contempt for humanity in
general is too great. Individuals are the only things that interest me. If
Spaniards like to cut each other’s throats and get Germans and Russians
to help them—why not let them ? It’s not my affair. If they eat each other
up to the last man, like Kilkenny cats, let them ! This will sound unsatis-
factory to you. But if you want the truth, there it is. Nobody is going to


compel me to “take sides”. To hell with sides. If Fascists annoy me, I
hop it. If Communists annoy me, I hop it. Everything that ends in “ism”
is just b . . . s, so far as I am concerned.
T. S. Eliot
while I am naturally sympathetic, I still feel convinced that it is best
that at least a few men of letters should remain isolated, and take no part
in these collective activities.
Yyvyan Holland
I am opposed to any system of government that denies freedom of speech
to the individual, and I am opposed to all forms of tyranny and oppression,
whether from Communism, Fascism or Religious Persecution. There is
little to choose between these, but probably Communism is the most
objectionable, as offering even less individual freedom than the others.
There is more real freedom to-day in England, the last of the great consti-
tutional monarchies, than anywhere else in the world.
Charles Morgan
in politics, I care chiefly that a man’s thought be not regimented or his
art censored, and that he may live as he pleases so long as, within a rule
of law he has shared in making, he offer no violence to the health or integrity
of others. Neither contestant in Spain aims at this, and between them I
will not choose, thinking it better to preserve the surviving liberties of
England and France within the peace of Europe than to persecute in the
false belief that the only alternative to a tyranny of the Right is a tyranny
of the Left.
Sean O’ Faolain
don’t be a lot of saps. If X and Y want to cut one another’s throats
over Z, why on earth must people who do not believe in the ideas propounded
by either X, Y, or Z have “to choose between them” ? If you want to know,
I do think Fascism is lousy. So is your Communism, only more so. But
there are other ideas in the world besides either of them—thank God (whom
neither of you believe in).
For the love of Mike cut loose from this fixation that the artist no longer
can have the guts to be what every artist worth his salt has always been—
an individualist. . . .
(May I say how much I like your postal address ?)
Yours contemptuously
Ezra Pound
questionnaire an escape mechanism for young fools who are too cowardly
to think; too lazy to investigate the nature of money, its mode of issue,
the control of such issue by the Banque de France and the stank of England.
You are all had. Spain is an emotional luxury to a gang of sap-headed
dilettantes.


W. J. Turner
i am not a supporter of Fascism or of anti-Fascism and I disagree with
every word of your questionnaire.
I await with interest to see if you believe sufficiently in intellectual liberty
to print this among the collection of answers.
Derek Verschoyle
I detest violence, particularly the violence of politicians, above all the
violence which politicians export from their own into other countries. But
my knowledge of Spain and of Spanish politics is fragmentary. It would
in the circumstances be presumption for me to judge which of the two
sides might best serve the true interests of Spain.
Alec Waugh
I do not agree that it is essential for an Englishman to take sides in the
Spanish Civil War because I do not accept the argument, “It’s Spain’s
turn now. It will be ours to-morrow.” Things are different here. The extent
of a writer’s capacity to detach himself from immediate issues is determined
by his individual temperament. But there is an essential difference between
the “Ivory Tower” and a stand-point “above the battle”.
H. G. Wells
i am not an “anti” of any sort unless it is anti-gangster or anti-nationalist.
My sympathies were all with the new liberal republic in Madrid. It has been
destroyed between the Anarchist-Syndicalists on the one hand and the
Franco pronunciamento on the other. The intervention of Italy and
Germany is on traditional nationalist lines; it was to be expected and it
has been greatly facilitated by the stupid confusion in the British mind and
will.
The real enemy of mankind is not the Fascist but the Ignorant Fool.
Vita Sackville West
the reason I did not respond to your previous questionnaire still holds
good. It is that I dislike Communism and Fascism equally; and, in fact,
cannot see any difference between them, except in their names. It seems
to me that they each bully and oppress the individual; and, through the
individual, Society at large. That is chiefly why I cannot make up my mind
to take either side in the Spanish quarrel, which is really a quarrel between
Communism and Fascism in Europe, not only in Spain.
One point in your questionnaire strikes me as ambiguous. You stress
“the legal Government” of Spain, as the Government you wish to support.
Is this because it is the legal Government, or because it is a Communist
Government ? If because it is the legal Government, then you ought also
to be prepared to support Hitler or Mussolini in the event of a rebellion
against them. Yet I do not think you would do so ?


Therefore what you really mean is that you want to see Communism
established in Spain as well as in Russia, and you do not care a snap of
the fingers whether a Government is “legal” or not. If so, why not have
said so frankly ? I hate these subterranean forms of propaganda—and wish
you could have avoided them if your convictions are sincere and therefore
respect-worthy.
Malachi Whitaker
fascism and communism are equally repulsive to me. I would resist the
encroachment of either, physically and mentally. My sympathy is for the
non-combatants in Spain.
AGAINST
THE GOVERNMENT
Edmund Blunden
i know too little about affairs in Spain to make a confident answer. To
my mind (subject to that first reservation), it was necessary that somebody
like Franco should arise—and although England may not profit by his
victory I think Spain will. The ideas of Germany, Italy, etc., in your docu-
ment do not square with those I have formed upon the whole of the recen t
history of those countries. Memories of 1914-18 perhaps do not allow
me to see some incidents you mention in the isolated and flamboyant way
the manifesto has them.
Arthur Machen
mr. Arthur machen presents his compliments and begs to inform that he
is, and always has been, entirely for General Franco.
Geoffrey Moss
Major Geoffrey McNeil Moss, late Grenadier Guards.
(1) i am for the Government of General Franco.

I was delighted to receive your unprejudiced brochure.
Naturally, I am a warm adherent of General Franco’s, being, like all of
us, a humanitarian.
The destruction of so many beautiful objects, and the massacre of so
many innocent persons, makes one pity profoundly the ignorant red masses
—subsidized by Russia—in Spain.
Do you not agree ?
Evelyn Waugh
I know Spain only as A tourist and a reader of the newspapers. I am
no more impressed by the “legality” of the Valencia Government than are
English Communists by the legality of the Crown, Lords and Commons.
I believe it was a bad Government, rapidly deteriorating. If I were a
Spaniard I should be fighting for General Franco. As an Englishman I
am not in the predicament of choosing between two evils. I am not a
Fascist nor shall I become one unless it were the only alternative to Marxism.
It is mischievous to suggest that such a choice is imminent.
