I dedicate this book to my Father,
and to the memory of my Mother,
in grateful remembrance of a very
happy childhood




The School for Birds
When I was going through the wood
What do you think I saw?
Why, a lot of birds in school
Their teacher a Jackdaw.
I thought that I would stay and watch,
So hid behind a tree
Where I peeped and saw them all,
But none of them saw me.
The Jackdaw strutted up and down
Very spruce was he,
“When you’ve finished preening, birds,
We’ll sing a song,” said he.
He wore spec’s upon his beak,
A cane beneath his wing,
And when he started to beat time
“The birds began to sing.”
Some Canaries sang the air,
It was very sweet,
But all the little Wagtails sang
Was “tweet! tweet! tweet!”
Then there was a joyous laugh,
It was a Kookaburra,
Jackdaw said “Come out and walk
Ten times round that furrow.”
Then they sang another song,
They were full of joy,
But Joey Parrot, he cracked nuts
Just like a little boy.
I slipped just then and made a noise,
They all flew away,
I’ll be as quiet as a mouse,
On another day.


The Animal Schoo
Haven’t you seen the Animal School?
I’ll take you there one day,
The walls are made of Pampas-grass
The roof is made of Hay.
The schoolmaster is Mister Bear,
And he gets very cross
When Billy Goat will not attend,
But tries to Butt and Toss.
One day the bell could not be found
And so Jill Cow did “Moo,”
Till all the animals were there
Who marched in two by two.
When Jane Cat can’t do her sums,
She begins to cry
“Meow, Meow, Meow, Meow,”
Which makes the old Bear sigh.
Once he said, “Now quadrupeds
Good old Farmer More
Says someone eats his turnip tops,”
Dick Donkey went “He-Haw.”
The teacher said to Billy Sow,
“Come, you’re late once more,”
Bill looked glum and gave a grunt
Just like a human snore.


Then teacher said, “Attention all,
Sing Doe Ray Me So Fa,”
But all that Mary Lamb could sing,
Was “Baa-aa-aa.”
One day old Bear was very pleased,
Little Johnny Foal
Had brought a bunch of carrots red.
To decorate a bowl.
Another day the old Bear said,
“Who would like to go
And find a nice big bone for me?”
And Jim Dog said “Bow-Wow.”
The rain came through the roof one day
A big hole in the Hay,
They said George Horse had eaten it,
He simply answered “Neigh.”
Mister Bear said, “Now all stand ;
But don’t make too much noise
Or else you’ll all become as bad
As those things they call boys.”
“Mark time! Quick march!
All keep in the line.
Left, right, left, right,
You are doing fine.
Now you may all go off home
To see your friends and dine,
But mind you all come back to school
To-morrow morn at nine.”


Fairyland
Have you been to Fairyland?
It’s a lovely place,
Where all the little Fairies are
With wings of silver lace.
Of course there is a Fairy Queen
And she is very grand,
Every time she leaves the dell
She has the Fairy Band.
Some play on the Blue-bells sweet
Soft mellow chimes,
Others ring the Flox-gloves deep,
They have lovely times.
When one shakes a Cowslip cup
There are drops of gold
Falling for the Fairy Queen,
Who never will grow old.
When she walks into the glade
In her shoes of glass,
All the Fairies bow to her
And wait to see her pass.
She has got a tiny throne
Underneath a tree,
Where she sits dressed all in white
And listens to a Bee.


He kneels down in front of her
And says “Your Majesty,
I’ve been making honey-dew
And brought it for your tea.”
The Queen is very pleased with him
And says “Dear Mister Bee
Thank you for your honey-dew,
I’ll love it for my tea.”
Then there comes a Ladybird
Who says “Your Majesty,
I have found a rain-drop
And brought it for your tea.”
“Oh,” she says, “How sweet of you
Ladybird and Bee,
Honey-dew and rain-drop
To bring them for my tea.”
If you go to Fairyland
And want to please the Queen,
You must take some honey-dew
And leave it where it’s seen.
You must take some raindrops
To please the Fairy Queen,
Leave them there then run away
She mustn’t know you’ve been.


The Garden Party
Lord and Lady Gladioli
Are going to “receive”
The debutantes of all the flowers
In springtime I believe.
So the flowers are busy now,
Deciding what to wear
To please dear Lady Gladioli,
They’re quite in awe of her.
She is so tall and lovely too,
She makes them feel quite small,
In fact the little Snow-drop feels
She’ll not be seen at all.
She is choosing dress of white
Trimmed with palest green,
Although so small, she’ll look so sweet
And fit to meet a Queen.
The Violet too will be there,
Who also is so sweet,
She’ll be dressed in purple hue
The noble ones to meet.
The Primrose also will be there
In dress of palest gold
Cut on the very latest lines,
At least so I am told.


Little Pansy will be seen
And how smart she’ll look;
Purple velvet splashed with gold,
I’ve seen it in a book.
The Jonquil tall hopes to be
There, with all the rest,
Her dress is white with golden spots,
She’ll look her very best.
Daffodil too will be there
She is tall and fair,
Her dress is in two shades of gold
The skirt cut in a flare.
The Crocus small, will be seen
In dress of mauve and yellow,
She’s ordered it from Mister Bee
He’s such a busy fellow.
He goes to one, then passes on,
Doing all he can
To make the world a sweeter place
For flowers and for man.
You may see this party too
In springtime, of the flowers,
And if you stay, I’m sure you’ll have
Many fragrant hours.


Playing Shops
“Who’ll buy, who’ll buy, who’ll buy, to-day,
I’ve beef and pork and chops,
I’m sure I am far cheaper than
All the other shops.
Look at these fine sausages,
(They’re really Plasticine),
I’m sure that you will say they are
The best that you have seen.
Now look at this prime piece of beef,
(Potato and red ink),
’Zactly like real butcher’s beef,
(Well, at least, I think).
Here is my new Grocer’s Shop,
You’ll like my cheese I hope,
(I’m sure no one will ever tell
It’s just a piece of soap).
This is tea (well s’posed to be,
Really they are beads
That Grandma gave me from her frock),
One pound, Mrs. Leeds?


You want some brown sugar too?
(Don’t tell her it is sand),
And won’t you try my home-made jam?
The best in the land.
(My jam is made from betroot’s red,
All cut up quite small,
She thinks that it is strawbr’y jam
She doesn’t know at all.)
Yes! I have some butter too,
(More yellow soap,
She will not see, that it is just
Like the cheese, I hope.)
Some white sugar and some flour?
(Both are only salt,
So if you do not like her cakes
You’ll know it’s not her fault.)
That is all to-day you say?
Nice weather for the seeds,
Thank you, now, mind the step
And good-bye, Mrs. Leeds.”


I ISi
Little Miss Mutfet’s Party
“Little Miss Muffet” sat on a chair,
“Little Miss Muffet” was full of despair,
For she had seen a cupboard quite bare,
And not a sign of her “Curds” was there.
So “Little Miss Muffet” up she got
And ran to her mother on the spot,
“Oh! mother,” she cried, “of curds I see none,”
“Never mind my dear, here are some.”
She went as carefully as she could,
And carried her curds into the wood,
On the side of a hill there she sat down
At the place where “Jack” had “broken his crown
So she sat and ate all her curds,
There wasn’t a sound except for the birds,
Until ’neath the trees she did espy
“Little Red Riding Hood” just passing by.
Then she ran home and said with delight
“Dear mother, ’tis near my birthday night
I’ll make out a list of all I’ll invite,
Then you can check it to see that it’s right.
Who shall I ask, now let me see,
Of course “Cinderella” there must be,
And “Little 80-Peep” and “Red Riding Hood,”
And “Little Jack Horner” because he’s so good.


And “Humpty Dumpty” who sat on the wall,
And “Jack and Jill” who both had a fall,
The “Three Little Pigs” and “The Three Bears”
And “Goldilocks” who climbed up the stairs.
“There mother dear, Fve made out the list
I hope there are not any I’ve missed,
But I think we’d better write on the door,
‘All Nursery Rhymes welcome at four.’ ”
So the day came and they all trooped along
And went into tea at the sound of the gong,
There were cakes and jellies and nice jam tarts
Especially praised by the “Queen of Hearts.”
They were happy as happy could be
Eating the cakes and drinking the tea,
And “Little Miss Muffet” she made a speech
When she saw that the “Spider” was out of reach.
“Little 80-Peep” said “Where have you been?”
To the Cat who had just returned from the Queen,
The “Blackbirds” sang and cried “Hie, hie,
How glad we are we’re not baked in a pie.”
Then “King Cole” he sought a dance
With “Cinderella” when he’d a chance,
But “Humpty Dumpty” sat on the floor
He didn’t want to fall down any more.
The “Little Lamb” and “Mary” too
Danced first with the “Prince” then “Little Boy Blue,”
And “Little Jack Horner” who’s always so good
He sought a dance with “Red Riding Hood.”
So they laughed and sang and danced with each other,
Then played “Hide and Seek” and all sought their cover,
They played “Hunt the Slipper” and pulled Crackers too
And wore paper caps like humans do.
And so the night at last went by,
And dear Mrs. Muffet said with a sigh,
“Now my dears ’tis time for bed,”
So they gave three cheers, by “Cock Robin” led
Then they each one said “Good-night,”
To “Little Miss Muffett” who put out the light,
And as they went home they all were agreed
They’d had a jolly good time and a jolly good feed.


Santa Claus and his Gnomes
Santa Claus rings a bell calling to his Gnomes,
Helter skelter down they come from their little homes.
Some of them live in the moon, some live in the stars,
Always ready to come down to help old Santa Claus.
Santa says to them “My Gnomes, ’tis nearing Christmas Eve,
So we must all get busy now to make the toys to leave.
Redcap Gnome, you can go and buy some wood for me,
Get the very best you can, as quickly as can be.
Bluecap Gnome, you can go and buy some paint and nails,
And you can buy some dollies too and horses with long tails.
Whitecap Gnome, you can go and buy some picture books,
Pastry boards and rolling pins for the little cooks.
Browncap Gnome, you can go and buy some coloured bricks.
Trumpets, whistles and some drums, but don’t forget the
sticks.
Yellowcap Gnome, you can go and buy some little chairs,
Snow-white and the Seven Dwarfs and some Teddy Bears.
Greencap Gnome, you can go and buy some Aeroplanes,
Cowboy suits and motor cars and some electric trains.”
Then Santa and his little Gnomes get busy as can be,
Making toys for girls and boys for stockings and the tree.
So we must thank dear Santa Claus and his little Gnomes,
For making toys and buying toys to leave in children’s homes.
So give three cheers for Santa Claus and his little Gnomes,
Hip, Hip, Hip, Hooray! they’ll see us from their homes.


Kwissmuss Time
Ise going to hang my stockin’ up
On Kwissmuss Eve, is you?
My Mummy says, most girls and boys
Will hang their’s up too.
I know where Father Kwissmuss lives
Wite up in the sky,
But when it’s near to Kwissmuss time
He comes down to buy.
He buys such lots and lots of things
For little girls and boys,
And when they hang their stockin’s up
He fills them up with toys.
Last time I got a picher book
“The Mouse and the Clock,”
And I got a LOVELY doll,
In such a PWETTY fwock.
This time a letter I have wote
To dear old Santa Claus,
Asking for a big doll’s house
Wiv windows and wiv doors.


And I’ve asked him for some cups
And some saucers too,
’Cos Mummy says my dolls must learn
The pwoper thing to do.
One doll must ask the other dolls
To come wound for tea,
But they mustn’t go to sleep
But sit up pwoperly.
They must learn how to shake hands
And say “How do you do”
And “Oh, it weally is too sweet,”
Like gwown up ladies do.
I will teach them to play bwidge,
Although I do not know
The pwoper way to play myself,
But Mummy dear will show.
They must learn to sit and talk
Of all nice things they cook,
And if my Mummy’s wery good
I’ll let her sit and look.


Little Mollie Mee
“I think I’ll play at school to-day,”
Said Little Mollie Mee,
“I’ll get my dolls and teddy bears
From their box,” said she.
“First of all get in a line,
Now young Percy Bear,
I distinctly saw you pulling
Susie Jane’s long hair.
So when we get into school,”
Said Little Mollie Mee,
“You’ll have to stand upon a stool
For being naughty! see?”
“Now I’ll call the reg’ster first
And if you’re here, ‘say HERE!’
First of all comes Winnie Peg
Winnie, can’t you hear?
Susie Jane and Percy Bear?
Yes I know you’re here;
Shirley Temple and Snow-white?
Do speak up my dear.
Koala Bear and Donald Duck
Are you quite well again ?
If you will eat unripe fruit
You must expect a pain.


Here comes Peter Golliwog
And he is late again;
Stand in front young Golliwog
You’re to get the cane.
Attention all! look at the board,”
Said Little Mollie Mee,
“Now if you all are ready, then,
We’ll say the A.B.C.
A, for Apple, B, for Bat,
C, for common Cat,
D, for Dunce, E for Once,
STOP! now who said that?
Oh it’s you Susie Jane,
Pm quite ashamed of you
Don’t you know E stands for Ear?
I don’t believe you do.
’Tention all, we’ll do some sums,”
Said Little Mollie Mee,
“Snow-white what do one and two make?
Yes, that’s right, it’s three.
Now then, Peter Golliwog
Add this up for me,
Two and two and four, what’s that?
You say it’s twenty three?
Oh, you are a naughty boy,
That’s through being late,
Write, I am a great big dunce,
Eight times on your slate.
Now we ail will sing a song,
And Donald Duck don’t ‘quack’;
Koala Bear? well I declare
He’s fallen on his back.
Shirley Temple’s gone to sleep,
Snow-white’s going too,
Winnie Peg has broke her leg,
Dear me, what will Ido?
A teacher’s life is very hard,”
Said Little Mollie Mee,
“You children are so trying, yes
As trying as can be.
So I think we’ll go off home,
’Cos its’ time for tea,
I’ll pack my children in their box,”
Said Little Mollie Mee.


Two Little Girls and a Boy
Three little children going to school,
Two little girls and a boy,
Johnny and Millie and Mollie Mee
And each one was holding a toy.
Millie had a big Teddy Bear,
Mollie a big Golliwog,
But Johnny who felt far too old for such toys
Carried a real looking dog.
Three little children all in school
Their toys upon a chair,
Every now and then had a peep
To make sure that the toys were there.
Three little children going home
Quarrelled on the way,
“I want this,” “You can’t have that,”
Is what I heard them say.
Each one wanted the other one’s toy,
Millie began to cry,
Mollie decided to do the same,
Then Johnny piped his eye.


“Oh! what a noise,” said the big Teddy Bear,
“Dear me,” said the Golliwog,
“Well really! what great big babies they are
Remarked the real looking dog.
Three little children felt ashamed
So Millie ceased to cry,
Mollie decided that she’d stop too,
Then Johnny dried his eye.
Three little children home from school
Two little girls and a boy,
Johnny and Millie and Mollie Mee
And each one was holding a toy.
But Millie had the real looking dog,
Mollie the big Teddy Bear,
Johnny was holding the Golliwog
With black and fuzzy hair.
Three little children so polite
Then went out to play,
“You may have this one if you like,”
Is what I heard them say.
Three little children as good as gold,
Two little girls and a ooy,
Johnny and Millie and Mollie Mee
Who had quarrelled just over a toy.


My Dolly
My Dolly’s name is “Susie Jane”
And she’s got big blue eyes,
If I press her tummy hard,
Do you know, she cries;
But if I kiss and cuddle her
She’s as good as gold,
Just like real babies are,
As least so I am told.
One day I took her into Church
In her dress of blue,
And she went and fell asleep
Like grown-up people do.
Another day I left her on
The seat of our new car,
My Daddy went and sat on her
And she cried out “Mama.”
One day I could not find my Doll,
I looked everywhere,
Then I saw my naughty pup
Chewing Susie’s hair.
Oh! it made her very ill
She had to go to bed,
The Doctor came and said she’d need
Some stitches in her head.
