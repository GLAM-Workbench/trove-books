An Interesting Document.
Being a reproduction of the original agreement which founded the House of Peapes.


Fifty Years of History.
X
Military Barracks in George Street, Sydney, in the Thirties. The Bank of New South Wales and Commercial Bank of Sydney stand on part
of the site, and Peapes & Co.’s present location is at about the centre where the old gateway stood (X).
A story of Progress.
An historic
Site.
Business is not without its romance.
Looking along the busy George Street, Sydney,
at that part where the old Military Barracks once stood, one
can see many of the buildings that came into being in the
picturesque Mid-Victorian era, and on some few of these the
very names most closely associated with the commerce of
that period.
It was at that time, in the year 1866, that the House of
Peapes was established, and as the 50th anniversary is now
so close it was deemed opportune to introduce a few inter-
esting facts relating to the early days of the business, which
was commenced nearly opposite the present building.
“The Scrap
j
~
Paper.
On the front P age is shown a c °py of “The
Scrap of Paper ” which is evidently the founda-
tion document. This document shows that on
M a y 12th, 1866, one Michael Goulston sold to
George Peapes and William Shaw the fittings and lease of 338
George Street (the site now occupied by Messrs. James
Sandy & Co.) for the sum of FORTY POUNDS. The first
ledger supports this evidence, and both are naturally treasured
possessions. It may be judged from this that the commence-
ment of the business was a very small one.
From an early print we are able to show the original
building—the business being then so small that it was
possible for one of the founders to use a portion as a
dwelling.
Another sketch, reproduced on the following page, shows
the additional premises as then occupied in the early seventies.
Evidence shows that from the inception of the business
some of the leading men of the day in Sydney were
patrons—in fact, the ledger shows names of prominent men
throughout, and we are pleased to state that in many
instances names of their descendants are still on the
books.
Three clients who were among those of 1866 are still
recorded in the present ledgers—patrons for 50 years.
Some
Notable
Clients.
Among the interesting names in the old ledger
is that of His Royal Highness the Duke of
Edinburgh, who visited Australia in H.M.S.
“Galatea” in 1869.
The names of Captain Taylor, who commanded that
ship, and those
of some of his
officers are also
recorded.
This interest-
ing ledger is not
free from not-
able characters,
for in it appears
the name of
the “Sir Roger
Tichborne” who
gained such no-
toriety some
years ago as
claimant to
the Tichborne
Estates. After
a trial lasting
many months
he was adjudged
guilty of fraud
and sentenced
to a long term
of imprison-
ment. His ac-
count (promptly
paid) shows
£l4l 12s. Od. as
expenditure on
his outfit.


In the Early Seventies.
About 1876 adjoining premises were acquired at 342
George Street for the purpose of adding a Drapery Section.
The extended business was successfully conducted there
until late in the year 1888, when the site was sold for about
£2,500 per foot.
As that rendered further occupation impossible, Messrs.
Peapes & Shaw decided to discontinue the sale of drapery
and to specialise in men’s wear, and premises were secured
at 311 George Street, now part of the present building.
Early in 1889 the removal was effected; these premises
were then much too large, only a small portion being
required—so little, in fact, that the offices were on the ground
floor. In this book, lack of space prevents us from illustrating
these premises, but in their modernised form they are so well
known it is hardly necessary.
Mr. William Shaw retired in 1891 and Mr. George Peapes
took over the business.
A Critical
Period in
Sydney.
The bank crisis of 1893 severely strained the
growing business, as it did all others, but the
storm was successfully weathered, and with
the subsequent recovery of trade it found its
full share of progress.
No. 309 George Street was acquired in 1897 —that being,
with 311, the present frontage of the building.
Mr. George Peapes died in 1898, and in December of
that year the business was converted into a limited company
A few years later it was realised by the management that
it was imperative to modernise the building to meet the
rapidly increasing trade.
Several rooms previously inaccessible were then converted
into showrooms, and the addition of a lift and other conveni-
ences such as pneumatic tubes and electric light were
installed.
What had been waste space was then able to be occupied,
and the facilities for displaying goods and conducting the
business were increased.
In 1902 the building was found still too small to
accommodate the growing business, and the Wynyard Lane
Section was raised two stories higher for the purpose of
increasing showroom and workroom facilities.
So great has been the expansion since then that the
present building is now inadequate and was to have been
razed to the ground during this year, 1915, and a new
building erected on the same site.
Further
Expansion
merely
Deferred
The plans are already prepared but the Great
War has intervened, necessitating a postpone-
rnent of extensions which, under other circum-
stances, would have been effected by now but
which we hope to make in the very near future.
Proposed New Building.

High-class Tailoring
BUYERS acting for us in Great Britain procure each season the most exclusive effects in better-class woollens. Thus it is that we
can always submit such a fine range of distinctive patterns.
The point we would emphasize at present is that despite the great war and its consequent effect on production, we fortunately
procured extensive ranges of those admirable weaves for which we are so favourably known.
Quiet tones will be favoured during the incoming season —greys of many shades and patterns predominating.
At the time of publication great difficulty is being experienced with the new dyes, and the mills are so busy with war orders
that a serious shortage of materials for civilian use is anticipated until the end of the war.
Having best .British woollens, treated with dependable dyes, we are in a position to offer exceptional advantages to our
who order before present supplies are exhausted.

Lconomic Tailoring
LARLY in the year we added to this department a large
workroom equipped with modern labour-saving devices,
which enable us to counteract rising costs and to still offer
well-made suits to measure at very moderate prices.
Our Economic Tailoring is carefully produced, each gar-
ment being well finished inside and out—-and thus beingquite dis-
tinct from and superior to the average moderate-priced tailoring .
Early contracts with the mills have enabled us to ensure
against immediate increases in our prices, but our quotations
must be accepted as subject to market fluctuations.

Washing Clothing
Ready to Wear
THE people of Australia are realising more and more every
vear the necessity for wearing cool light clothing during
summer.
Although originally produced for tropical wear, our Washing
Suits are now keenly sought every summer for beach and bush
wear and for lounge use at home during the hot weather.
Some of these garments are made for us in India —others
are produced in our own workrooms. In every instance the
materials are thoroughly shrunk and seams strongly sewn so
that the suits will withstand rough laundry usage.
In addition to the usual tropical materials we introduce,
and strongly commend, Light Mohair, Aero Crash, and Formosa
Silk —w r hich give good service and do not soil quickly.

“No-Veste” (Regd.)
Suits
For Lounge or Holiday Wear
OUR Ready-to-Wear “ No-Veste ” Suits
are essentially different from any other
productions.
The distinctive styles, the careful finish
and the exclusive character of the materials
distinguish them as the smartest of all Suits
for Lounge or Holiday wear.
The name “ No-Veste ” has been speci-
ally registered to prevent its adoption by
others. The ordinary two-piece suit lacks
the smart cut of the “ No-Veste ” style,
which, indeed, closely resembles a made-to-
order suit, and retains its shape during wear.
Patterns of the materials will be sent on
request. These include an excellent range
of Plain and Fancy Flannels, White Serge
and Light Porous Tweeds.
The name “ No-Veste” is registered by us
and cannot be used by others. Lach suit
carries our “No-Veste” label.

Australia enables us to select judiciously the materials most suitable tor the
various climatic zones.
All riding garments are specially reinforced at the parts subject to wear and
saddle strain.
Comfort is assured to the rider by reason of the careful cutting of the garments
a factor which also provides longer wear and neat appearance.
Conditions arising from the war may cause prices

alteration.

distinctive shirtwear. In addition we import large
quantities of shirting in piece which we make up in

CREPE Shirts have deservedly become the
most popular for Summer wear. The mate-
rial is so very open in weave that it is at all
times cool, yet it is quite as serviceable as the
closely woven fabrics. Our Crepe Shirts are made
in our own workrooms from the best British Crepes,
and are this year more notable in value than ever.

White Dress Shirts
IN addition to the conventional Dress Shirt with long stiff front,
we feature several distinctive stj’les of soft fronted shirts, which
are more comfortable for wear during the warmer months and
are accepted as quite correct for evening functions.
When ordering Dress Shirts it is advisable to state size of linen
collar usually worn, which we find a more reliable guide than quoting
the size of neckband.
Do not cut Catalogue when ordering —it is sufficient
to state number, size and price.
For Prices of Dress Shirts Made to Order, see

Distinctive Hats
ryESPITE the difficulties which con-
front manufacturers in England at
the present and which will affect Aus-
tralia for some time, we were able to
obtain shipments of exclusive new styles
much in advance of the time when such
productions will become available else-
where.
In fact we fear that many of the hats
now shown by us will not be again pro-
curable for some considerable time.
Hats for all seasons and all occasions
are shown on this and the subsequent
pages.

Straw Hats
THE long summer season makes the Straw Hat very popular in
Australia, and we prepare for the demand at the inception of
warm weather by assembling the best productions of leading
hat manufacturers in Australia and England.
Onr Straw Boaters typify the most recent styles and are always
evenly woven and of good quality.
The Panamas, illustrated on the following page, are made in
England from the finest .South American straw.
They are very light and cool and come to us in the most dis-
tinctive shapes. The straw is so well plaited that the hats can be
rolled into pocket size without deteriorating the hat or affecting its
shape.
Please state width of brim when ordering
Boaters or Panamas.

Woollen Sweaters
THE Coat and Vest styles of Sweaters we originally intro
i duced to Australia, and each season we have placed
before our clients the same dependable British make.
This year, despite all the difficulties, we have been able
to replenish supplies, but have advices of serious increases m
the cost —so much so that sweaters for the next season may
be quite prohibitive in price.
Men who take the precaution to order this season will
certainly effect an appreciable saving.
Please observe the difference at neck between Coat and
Vest Sweaters before ordering.
When ordering please state
number —do not cut
catalogue.

Underwear
for Summer and Winter
LARLY in the season the military authorities commandeered
all available supplies of Underwear. The mills in Great
Britain and Australia are working at high pressure for
military needs, so that the outlook for woven underwear is by
no means bright.
Prices have already advanced over last season’s figures,
and it is likely that it will become much more expensive, as
advices state that orders cannot at present be fulfilled by the
mills.
Cotton Underwear will be more popular than ever this
summer, and of that, fortunately, we have ample supplies
for the coming months.
Please note that shirts and pants are quoted with corres
ponding numbers on opposite pages.
Please state chest measurements for Shirts.
Owing to the effect of the war, prices are subject to fluctuation.

Plain and Fancy Half-Hose
FANCY Half-Hose will again be confined mainly to neat effects in Embroidered Clocks
and Embroidered Fronts as shown in our illustration. We feattire these styles
in various effective colour combinations—the majority being in the dark shades so
widely popular.
Hosiery, like Underwear, will be scarce, and is likely to become much more expensive
than usual. We counsel early ordering for summer and winter requirements.
Special attention is directed to our quotations for Cotton, Lisle and Silk Half Hose,
which we have introduced in very light weights, with strengthened toes, heels, and soles.
These cool socks should appeal particularly for summer wear.
When ordering please be sure to state size of boot —not size of foot.

SIMPLIFYING SELECTION OF GOODS BY MAIL
No matter how distant you may be from Sydney we can serve you satisfactorily by
mail. A special staff is devoted to this important section of our business and particular
care is taken, under close supervision, that instructions are intelligently followed.
The illustrations are authentic, and convey a correct idea of the goods described.
PATTERNS SENT ON REQUEST
We will be pleased to send patterns of Suitings, Shirtings, Overcoat materials, Ready-
to-wear Shirts and Clothing, etc., when requested. We would ask that a second selection
be always indicated as it is possible that the first choice may be out of stock at the
time of ordering. Should you have any requirement not shown or described herein,
please write to us as we are frequently adding new lines which cannot be included in
the catalogue.
WHEN REMITTING
Please send Cheque, Money Order, Bank Draft or Postal Note. If you have no account
with us please enclose remittance, or refer us to Sydney business house. If desired,
we send goods to any part of the Commonwealth by the Value Payable Parcels Post
System.
ALL COMMUNICATIONS SHOULD BE ADDRESSED
as follows :-PEAPES & CO. LIMITED, BOX 165 G.P.0., SYDNEY. This will save
delay and avoid confusion. Do not address letters to any of our staff.
ORDERS ARE DESPATCHED PROMPTLY
Except in those instances where goods have to be made to order, we dispatch all parcels
on the same day that letters are received, and when letters arrive by late mails the
goods go forward the next morning. Our clients find this promptness a great
convenience.
DO NOT CUT THE ILLUSTRATIONS
Our system of numbering ensures correct fulfilment of orders. It will be sufficient if
you quote the number and the required sizes and colours.
This catalogue is useful as a guide to prevailing and incoming styles, and we would
deem it a favour if you will keep it for reference during the year.
SIMPLE ORDER AND SELF-MEASUREMENT FORMS
are attached to simplify instructions. These forms enable us to systematise the despatch
of goods and to record your measurements for future use.
GOODS FORWARDED ON APPROVAL
If you have an account with us we will be pleased to send goods such as Neckwear,
Socks, etc., for approval.
If any goods ordered should be found unsatisfactory on arrival they may be returned.
Great care is taken to send just what is required, but as no system is infallible we
state our willingness to either exchange goods or refund money if desired.
EXTRAORDINARY CONDITIONS MAY AFFECT PRICES
