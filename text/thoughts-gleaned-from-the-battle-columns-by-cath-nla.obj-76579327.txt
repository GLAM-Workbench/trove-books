POEMS
OUR ANSWER TO THEIR CHALLENGE
From wide-flung empire ?neath the skies,
Resplendent with a thousand dyes,
And stars in beauty beam;
On tropic isles where spices grow,
O?er mountains where eternal snow
And silver cascades gleam.
From valleys green o?er flowery plain,
Or wider Adds of golden grain,
Enriched with summer?s glow ;
From iron-bound coasts so wild and stern,
Or where the deep-toned rubies burn,
And pearls gleam down below.
The sapphire waves that kiss the strand
Of coral reef begirded land,
The Indian?s natal home;
Or where the soft June roses blow,
And hawthorn white in green lanes grow
Beneath her fair blue dome.
Flow rich our heritage, and wide,
Where Freedom?s banner floats with pride
O?er all this fair domain;
Her stalwart sons united stand,
Obedient to their king?s command,
To break Oppression?s chain.


The bugle calls: ?To arms, away!?
That nation now has named the day,
To which he toasted long,
And to her challenge we will speak,
Onr cause is to defend the weak,
And right against the wrong.
Ah! monarch proud, yon now must learn
Yon cannot treaties lightly spurn
Between the nations true;
If yon trespass upon the land
That will in conflict neutral stand,
Thus will we answer you.
Oh, Teuton cruel, with armoured heel,
Can your cold heart no pity feel
For a people small and brave
Who dared to keep their plighted word ?
And deeply all the earth was stirred,
this answer that they gave ?
?We will for honour firmly stand,
And dare you to invade our land;
To keep our word we'll fight,
And though our blood like crimson rain
Should all our fair broad acres stain,
We?ll die for truth and right.?
Their bitter wrongs we will requite,
For every vengeful blow you smite,
And in the cold dust lay.
For city and for sacred fane,
And all the noble-hearted slain,
Indemnity you?ll pay.


O?er a country strong and great
You reign, proud man, in high estate,
Yet so dissatisfied
Because the earth is not your throne,
And vou are monarch all alone
Throughout this world so wide.
A cause that's righteous, true, and just
Will bring your proud heacf to the dust,
And veil your land with shame,
Because you thought in pomp to ride
O?er all the nations, in your pride,
For glory and for fame.
Now this sad lesson you must learn:
Those wrongs will to your bosom turn.
Which you have cruelly done:
The widow?s and the orphan?s tears,
And anguish through the long, long years,
Will be your laurels won.
THE CALL OF THE MOTHERLAND
Listen to the Motherland,
She calls for volunteers,
Throughout her mighty empire vast
Her army now appears.
They answer to her noble call:
Come, help defend the right!
From north and south, and east and west,
They bravely go to fight.


The weaker nations needed aid,
Their cry Great Britain heard,
She pledged her faith to be their friend,
And now she?ll keep her word.
By all her sons of empire great,
And wealth of all her shores,
With allied friends she stands to-day,
Upholding Freedom?s cause.
The hardy Scot, with brow so stern,
And throbbing heart of fire,
Stands side by side with brother Celt
From that fair isle of Ire.
The Englishman, with cooler brain,
But nerve as strong to fight,
On foreign soil joins hands with those
Who battled for the right.
New Zealand?s lads have crossed the foam
And India's groves of palms
Send forth their dusky sons with pride
To bear their country's arms.
And where the sun in glory shines
On Afric?s sandy plain,
Her stalwart troops march boldly forth
To fight for their domain.
Canadian homes have sent their men
Across the trackless blue,
And from the front we read with pride
Of valiant deeds they do.


Now where the Southern Cross e?er shines
From out a sky so blue,
And Freedom?s banner ever floats,
The boys are coming, too.
The Coo-ee boys, so brave and strong,
Are answering to their vow,
As through their own fair southern wave
Their gallant troopships plough.
Some have reached the Dardanelles,
And, oh! our pulses thrill
To read how they left the boats
And stormed the Turkish hill?
In front of guns that belched out fire,
And rain of shot and shell,
With bayonets fixed they made their charge,
With one terrific yell?
?Onward, Australians !! At them, boys !!
Victory is yours to-day,?
Then trench after trench was bayonet swept,
Till the Turks fled with dismay.
Ah! justly proud is Britain now
Of her sons from distant lands,
And of the good old boys from home,
Who help with willing hands
To break the cruel oppressor?s chain,
The vauntant tyrant sway;
With other lands she fights for right,
And right must win the day.


What did you do when the big ships grey
Bore our troops to the fight away?
How did you feel, and what did you say,
When the ships put out from the shore?
Did you counsel the men to be brave and loyal,
And never their country?s honour soil,
To fight for the right, and not for spoil,
When the ships put out from the shore?
Did your eyes grow dim when you said ?Good-bye,?
As your breasts were torn with the parting sigh?
Did you lift this prayer to our God on high,
When the ships put out from the shore?
Oh, guide them safely o?er the main,
In the fierce, hot fight do Thou sustain,
And help them the cause of right maintain,
When the ships put out from the shore.
Did you knit them mitts and socks by the score,
To keep them warm in the trenches raw?
Were you proud of the men going forth to the war,
When the ships put out from the shore?
Many a heart will be wrung with pain,
When the great grey ships return again
With the wounded boys from the battle plain,
When the ships return to the shore.
Let your welcome be as kind and true
As the farewell was when they crossed the blue,
For they?d need a greater love from you
When the ships return to the shore.


Give to those dauntless heroes bold,
A place in your hearts that will ne?er grow cold,
For thrilling will be the stories told,
When the ships return to the shore.
Be good to the lads that are halt and maimed,
For they gave'their limbs for the country?s name,
And they wrote their deeds on the scroll of fame,
Ere the ships return to the shore.
Let fall a tear for the brave who sleep
?Neath the battlefield across the deep,
And a sacred place in your memories keep
For those who return no more.
CAN YOU STAY AT HOME?
Can you stay at home ?neath a smiling sky,
And read unmoved the list of the slain?
Can you turn away from the nation?s cry:
Come, help us the cause of right maintain?
Can you stay at home when women give
Their husbands and sons for the cause of right
And sisters bid their brothers live
For honour, and for their country fight?
Can you stay at home when the brave ones fall
On the blood-red field across the deep?
Can you, heedless, hear the bugle's call
While mothers pray and sisters weep?
Don't stay at home when the nation?s need
Calls for her truest, noblest men,
While the tears of the widows and orphans? plea ?
Go, right the cruel wrongs done to them!
it


As I sit and think of the bloodstained lands,
My heart will ache and my eyes will weep;
Oh, monarch! with your crimsoned hands,
On your easy conch can you lie and sleep,
And dream of home, of wife, of child,
Of broad lands and fair.
And hear no sounds of anguish wild,
From hearts wrung with despair?
The orphan's cry, the widow?s moan,
Are they unheard by thee?
That cruel command went from thy throne
Which caused their misery.
On your downy couch do you hear no sound
Of the innocent blood you have shed,
Crying to heaven from out the ground
For vengeance on your head ?
No penitent tears can wash away
The guilt of that blood-red shame,
While a million voices on earth to-day
Breathe curses on your name!
You schemed and planned in your palace royal,
You toasted ?That Day? in the banquet hall,
When your men should go forth to plunder and
And cause the cities and towers to fall.
spoil,
Ambition?s sea rolled under your feet,
You drank at its laughing tide,
And, oh! the waves were buoyant and sweet,
As they lifted you up with pride.
That golden hood has crimson grown
By the blood of your victims slain.
You seek all Europe for your throne,
And the world your vast domain!


The throne you have will fall to the dust,
The only reward you can claim
For a war so cruel, and deeds unjust,
Is a crown of lasting shame!
DON?T BE A COWARD AND STAY
AT HOME.
Don?t be a coward and stay at home,
While brave men are over the sea;
Fight to preserve the peace we prize,
And our nation?s liberty!
Don?t be a coward and stay at home,
When women give their sons
To fight for their country?s honour dear,
While you are afraid of the guns.
Don?t be a coward and stay at home
When women go to the front
To nurse the sick and wounded men,
Who hear the battle?s brunt.
Don?t be a coward! They?re not afraid
To hear the cannon?s roar,
'And sec the shells around them hurst,
While nursing at the war.
If you?re a coward, and must stay at home,
Don?t brag in a public place
That you?re afraid to shoot a Turk,
To Australia?s deep disgrace.
If you?re a coward, don?t tell it abroad
That fact we already know,
You have the pity of all your friends,
And the scorn of every foe!
If you?re a coward, and must stay at home,
When our troops return
The streets will echo with ringing cheers,
While your cheeks with shame will burn.


If you?re a coward and must stay at home,
When the red campaign is o?er,
You'll miss the laurels so nobly won
the heroes of the war.
Now, don?t be a coward and stay at home,
We want to be proud of you all,
And show the world Australia?s sons
Will answer the bugle call!
HISTORY REPEATS THE SAD STORY
AGAIN.
The pibroch had sounded o?er mountain and glen,
When the flowers of the forest marched out to their
doom,
Now history repeats the sad story again?
The youth of our country have gone in their bloom.
The bugle has sounded a stern call to arms,
And their young hearts responded that call to obey.
They left their bright homes, and their rich, growing
farms,
To fight for their king in a land far away.
Their ploughs and their reapers they left for the guns
That boomed on Gallipoli?s fair height ;
The hoys cutting sleepers, and lads from the runs,
All joined their brave comrades to battle for right.
To the boys in the city the same bugle call,
Thrilled through their pulses and throbbed through
each brain ;
From workshop and office, and cottage and hall,
They hore the stout troopships again and again.
Then o?er the wide ocean to Anzac?s far shore
The sons of Australia passed on in their pride,
Leaving at home hearts now aching and sore,
For the grave out there on the lonely hillside.


Sad widows are weeping, and sisters now mourn,
And mothers' hearts ache for their boys.
The bright-hearted laddies for ever have gone
From the once sunny homes now void of all joys.
Oh! mother, and widow, and sister, and sire,
Look up to that country where hearts ache no more,
The trump of God called to our boys, ?Come up
higher,?
And live in a land where they never learn war.
In the ocean eternal of God?s wondrous love
Those dear ones find rest who have fallen out there,
In the many bright mansions in the city above,
Which the Man of all sorrows has gone to prepare.
In a rapture that follows this long night of pain,
In a home where they know nought of sorrow or
care,
You?ll fold to your bosoms your loved ones again,
And live in those mansions He?s gone to prepare.
LORD KITCHENER OF KHARTOUM.
Why are the people weeping,
And the nation wrapped in gloom?
Because ?neath the sea lies sleeping
Brave Kitchener of Khartoum.
Who is this great departed?
Not even the children ask
For Kitchener, the lion-hearted,
Who was equal to any task.


Is known throughout the Empire
As a soldier true and bold.
His deeds are sung round the camp-fire,
And proudly in trenches told.
His name on history?s pages
Stands out in bold relief,
And through the coming ages,
They?ll read of our warrior chief.
How he fought down there in the Soudan,
?Neath the banner of the free,
Like a soldier and a true man,
Established liberty.
So now in the world?s wide battle,
Where the deafening cannon?s boom,
And the rifle?s long death rattle,
Was Kitchener of Khartoum.
Sending his brave boys forward,
And bidding them be loyal,
And never by deeds unworthy
Their country?s banner soil,
Himself at the call of duty,
Passed o?er the rolling foam,
From the land of his birth and its beauty,
He left those to mourn at home.
For the warrior whose mind was directing
His country in this great campaign,
Still Liberty?s banner protecting,
He sank ?neath the rolling main.
