PROSPECTUS
OF A DAILY PAPER TO BE DESIGNATED
M «m jLirsvaA&sA» s>sjl«vs. m
It is neither safe nor creditable, in the present
condition of the civilized world, for any extensive
community to allow so important an organ as the
public press to be monopolized by any Political
party, or set of men holding particular opinions ;
whatever that party or these opinions may be.
But it is peculiarly unsafe, and absolutely dan-
gerous, as well as discreditable, for any such com-
munity to allow the press to be monopolized by
individuals who are notoriously actuated by no
higher motive than the lust of gain, and who
systematically prostitute that noble engine, which
Divine Providence has beneficently given to man-
kind for the general welfare and advancement
of the race, for the basest purposes, and the gra-
tification of the most unworthy feelings.
It is therefore a maxim of universal applica-
tion in Europe and America, that wherever there
is room for one paper, there must also be room
for two ; and it is also a maxim of special appli-
cation to New South Wales, as a great Colonial
community having interests of transcendent im-
portance to advocate at the present moment,
that the monopoly of the Sydney Morning He-
rald should forthwith cease and determine.
The parties who have accordingly determined,
provided the Colonial public shall support them
in their undertaking, to put an end to the said
monopoly, by establishing another daily paper in
Sydney, to be designated “ The Australian
League,” of course hold certain political opini-
ons to which they desire to give currency ; and
as the public will naturally wish to know* what
these opinions are, the more important of them
are simply as follows :
1. —They hold that this Colony, in common with
certain others of the Australian group, is at
present in an exceedingly depressed and retro-
grade condition—that the Local Government
has lost the confidence and respect of the
public ; that the best part of the population,
including intelligent and industrious mechan-
ics, small traders of reputable character, and
small capitalists with considerable means, are
rapidly leaving the Colony for a far distant
and foreign land, where people are allowed, by
a liberal and enlightened Government, to
manage their own affairs; that the mercantile
interests of the community are, in consequence
of this condition of things, in a state of com-
plete prostration ; that public morals were
never so low, nor the condition of the people
generally so unsatisfactory, at any former pe-
riod within thfe last twenty years ; that the
funds of the Colony are either absorbed in
great measure in the payment of exorbitant
salaries, utterly beyond the means of the
colonists, or recklessly expended, at the
instance of interested parties, to inundate
it with a free immigrant population of the
worst possible description ; and that influ-
ences of a character the most dangerous to
the freedom, as well as to the moral welfare
and general advancement of society, are exten-
sively predominant in the management of
public affairs.
2. —They hold that this exceedingly depressed
and retrograde condition of the Colony is to
be ascribed entirely to bad government—
the people’s being denied their inherent an«
indefeasible right, as men and as Britons, to
the management of their own affairs—to their
being subject to a despotism worse in some
respects than even that of Poland ; inasmuch
as the Autocrat with us is not a substantial
flesh-and-blood Emperor who is amenable in
some way to public opinion, but a mere Phan-
tom, who systematically shelters himself from
all such responsibility behind Acts of Parlia-
ment which he gets made to order, and
which he violates at pleasure.
3. —They hold that, in such circumstances, the
Colony has nothing to hope for from home—
where all the governing influences are either
indifferent to our welfare or dead against us;
and as Earl Grey, as Secretary of State for the
Colonies, has already had three years given
him to prepare a Constitution for these Aus-
tralian Colonies, but has hitherto done abso-
lutely nothing in the matter, notwithstanding
his own specious professions and promises be-
forehand, they are decidedly of opinion that
it would be fo’ly and madness to give him one
hour longer, and they are accordingly deter-
mined not to do so.
4. —They hold that there is equally little to hope
for from the present Legislative Council, which,
unfortunately for the Colony, is
Fall’n, fall’n, fall’n, fall’n,
Fall’n from its high estate,
And weltering in the mud !
There let it lie—Requiescat in pace ! De
mortals nil nisi bonmn.
s.—They hold, moreover, that in these circum-
stances, the Colonists ought by all means to
take their case into their own hands, and to
follow the noble example set them in the
earliest and best times of British Coloniza-
tion, as well as in various important instances
in the Mother Country of a recent date, by
forming a Great Political League, for mutual
protection and defence, and for general ad-
vancement ; to comprise those Colonies
which, from contiguity of place, and com-
munity of interest, may be bound up, so to
speak, in the same political volume.
In addition, therefore, to the general objects
of a Colonial Journal, it will be the special
object of “The Australian League”
Ist.—To unite in one Grand Political League,
for mutual protection and defence, and for
general advancement, the five Australian Co-
lonies of New South Wales, Van Diemen’s
Land, South Australia, Port Phillip and Cook’s-
land, or the Moreton Bay Country, (which is
evidently destined to become a separate and inde-
pendent Colony very soon) ; that the inhabitants
of these Colonies may henceforth feel and know
that they are no longer isolated and detached
communities—to be governed and oppressed
separately and independently by Ukases from
Downing Street, with none to interfere for them
from without—but one people, having common
interests and common objects—the nucleus and
elements of one Great Australian Nation.
2nd.—To defeat the scandalous conspiracy
which the Local Governments, acting upon re-
cent and outrageous UkaseS from Downing Street,
have formed with a mere handful of Squatters
in this territory, to degrade certain of these
Colonies into mere receptacles for the convicted
felons of Great Britain and Ireland ; to prevent
that degradation in every instance and at all
hazards, and to remedy, as far as may be practi-
cable, the enormous evils that have already
resulted from the prevalence and abuse of the
Transportation System in certain of these Colo-
nies.
3rd.—To encourage and promote, by every le-
gitimate means, the influx of an industrious, vir-
tuous, aud thoroughly British population into
these Colonies ; that their vast and inexhaust-
ible resources may be duly and fully developed,
and that they may be fitted, as speedily as possible,
for taking the high and influential place which
they are evidently destined to hold in the civili-
zed world, as the Great Leading Power of the
Southern Hemisphere.
4th—To achieve, by moral meani exclusively,
and with the full approbation and concurrence
of Britain, the entire freedom and independence
of these Colonies, and their erection into Sove-
reign and Independent States; to be incorporated
into one great political Federation, like the Swiss
Cantons of Europe, or the United States of Ame-
rica, under the style and title of “ The United
Provinces of Australia.”
The parties originating this movement are
quite confident that all this is not only supremely
desirable for the future welfare and advancement
of these Colonies, but perfectly attainable in the
present state of the public mind in England,
within a comparatively brief period, and without
the shedding of one drop of British blood. Great
Britain would now most willingly grant entire
freedom and independence to her North Ameri-
can Colonies, if they merely asked for that great
boon ; but the bitter pill for Britain to be re-
quired to swallow is the annexation of any of her
Colonies to the United States of America. This
of course would be altogether out of the question
in our case; and therefore as that case is a hun-
dred-fold stronger in favour of entire freedom and
independence for the Colcnies than that of Can-
ada, we should in all likelihood have a favorable
consideration of our claims, and a favorable an-
swer the more cheerfully and the more speedily,
if w T e only offered our mother-country fair and
honorable terms for the future.
As the objects which the originators of this
movement are anxious to promote, are equally
and transcendently important to men of all ranks
and conditions, of all professions and denomina-
tions, it will be their earnest desire and endea-
vour to conciliate in their favour men of all
classes and creeds, without giving unnecessary
offence to any. Union is strength, and the
union of all classes of this community, for the
accomplishment of the great political objects
above-mentioned, will in a period of time com-
paratively short, raise this magnificent group
of British Colonies from the extreme point of
insignificance and depression which they have
unfortunately reached under wretched govern-
ment, to a position of the highest importance
and influence among the nations of the earth ;
while prosperity will again revisit our shores
and cheer the hearts of our heart-broken and
cruelly depressed population.
