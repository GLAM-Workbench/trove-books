GET DR. WAUGH’S.
The day was young and not far spent,
As through the busy streets there went
A youth (as yet unknown to fame),
Bearing aloft the well-known name—
“Dß. WAUGH’S.”
His ?ye was bright, his form upright;
He held his banner to the light;
, His business there, to advertise
v The Powder famed for Cakes and Pies—
“ DR. WAUGH’S/
Nor mow, nor ioe, were seen about, »
As lustily that youth did shout;
“ D Baking Powder you would choose, ■
And not know which the best to use,
GET ‘DI. WAUGH’S.”*
** Oh stay 1” a maiden said, “ Oh stay I
And tell me ; when I cook to-day &,
What Baking Powder shall I try ?” vv.
The youth he answered with a cry—
“GET DR. WAUGH’S.”
" listen, friend,” an old man said,
*V*y wife she does not make good bread,
Tho’ many powders she doth use.”
The youth said, —“ Powders bad yon choose
—GET DR. WAUGH’S.”
“ m tell my wife,” the old man ories,
And when the Powder good she kies;
“ The bread I know will be quite light,”
The youth repeats with his “ good night ”
—“GET DR. WAUGH’S.”
Then for a last good bye he said,
“ When using Powder for your bread,
I hope you will take my advice,
For DE. WAUGH’S makes all things nice
—GET DR. WAUGH’S.”
ALWAYS THE PUREST AND BEST.

A doctor is a useful man,
4 ► Who does us all the good he can.
But DR. WAUGH now takes the cake,
< ► With housewives who can cook and bake.
Would you know the reason why
* ► DR. WAUGH is voted best ?
Then just his BAKING POWDER buy,
4 ► And put it to the test.
With it a girl can make a cake,
4 ► As light as any feather ;
But if she some other take,
4 ► ’Twill turn out just like leather.
So let us all unite 0
4 ► In praise of DR. WAUGH,
Whose Baking Powder, of which we write,

S. A. PALMER (Vitadatio).
Dear Sir, —I have very great pleasure in certifying to the MERITS OF VITA-
DATIO. I have suffered for the past five years, off and on, from “JAUNDICE,"
“ENLARGEMENT of the LIVER.” and an “INTERNAL GROWTH ” of some
kind, which the doctors did not seem to understand, and all the medicine I took
before VITADATIO had no more effect upon me than so much water. My
husband and son induced me to try your VITADATIO, and, after the
second week I had been taking it, a quantity of blood, and lumps of stuff
which looked like pieces of liver, came away, I now feel splendid; am
able to get abont and do my work.
I am an old resident of Shepparton, and all my neigh-
bours can tell you how bad I was.
I EARNESTLY RECOMMEND VITADATIO to
- . -v anyone suffering as I did.—Yours gratefully,
WCBBCIfe \ Mrs. C. CURREY.
