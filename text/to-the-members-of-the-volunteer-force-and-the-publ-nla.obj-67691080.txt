Gentlemen, ?The daily press having published this Memorial
with only a portion of the correspondence, we feel compelled to resort
to this mode of laying the whole facts of our case before you. In doing
this, we are not actuated by any spirit of vindictiveness at our dis-
appointment. Prom the beginning we were determined to exhaust
every constitutional means in our power to vindicate our position. We
had very little, if any, expectation of succeeding after the Treasurer
repudiated his solemn promise; but having at heart the welfare of
the Volunteer Force, we desire to place prominently before you the
treatment we have received at the hands of the War Minister and the
Colonel Commandant, believing that publicity is the surest and safest
guarantee against that system of corruption and mis-management
which is slowly but surely destroying its very existence.
We have the honor to remain,
Your obedient servants,
THE MEMORIALISTS.

Sheweth,
?That your Memorialists were appointed in 1860 and 1861
to the Medical Staff of the Volunteer Force, then commanded by
Colonel Pitt.
?That your Memorialists received and now hold their com-
missions as Assistant Surgeons to the Artillery Corps.
?That Colonel Anderson, the present Colonel Commandant of
Volunteers, at the time of the appointment of your Memorialists
was Lieutenant Colonel of that Corps and recommended their appoint-
ment to the Governor.
?That your Memorialists did duty with their Corps until the
new enrolment took place in October last, at which time Officers were
re-gazetted and new rules published.
? That your Memorialists were not amongst the Officers
re-gazetted, nor was any intimation given to them that they were or
ever had been connected with the force, in fact, the existence of your
Memorialists was completely ignored.
?That after waiting for a considerable time, your Memorialists
discussed the subject of their treatment and resolved to seek informa-
tion from the Colonel Commandant of the Volunteer Force and the
Honorable the Treasurer.
? That your Memorialists now beg to submit to your Excellency
and the Honorable the Executive Council, the following correspondence
and enclose a declaration as to the truth of the facts in connection there-
with.
? And your Memorialists humbly pray that it may please
your Excellency and the Honorable the Executive
Council to direct that your Memorialists may receive
that consideration which the circumstances of the case
seem to merit. And your Memorialists as in duty
bound will ever pray.?

As regards Mr. Verdords repudiation, the Governor will not, in
my opinion, entertain it.
I think it unnecessary to Memorialize His Excellency

Memo. ?In reply to the attached communication from Medical
Gentlemen lately attached to corps in the Volunteer Service, I have to
state that it was the intention of Government by the order in Council of
the 14th October, 1863, to cancel all appointments to the Force made


previous to the new organization, but not the commissions ; taking this
view of the case, all Officers, whether Medical or in other branches,
who offered their services under the new enrolment and were not
appointed to Corps, retained their commissions and were available for
service, if called upon, until which time they remained unattached,
having no duty assigned to them to perform. I have made answer to
this effect to applications made already on the question now before me ;
but since then the wording of the former commissions has been brought
to my notice, and it raises a point which must be submitted to Govern-
ment. The commissions state ? Alluding to rank, to hold, exercise,
?and enjoy the same whilst it shall be the pleasure of her Majesty
? or the Governor of Victoria to continue the services of the said Corps
?of Volunteers.? The reply of Government will be duly promul-
gated.

Melbourne, 21st March, 1861.


Melbourne, April 4th, 1864.
Sir, ?The undersigned Medical Officers have the honor to
submit the following facts for your consideration :
?On the 12th December last, we addressed a letter to the
Colonel Commandant of Volunteers requesting to know r what position
we held in the Force. Having waited about a fortnight and receiving
no reply, we again communicated with that Officer, calling his attention
to our former letter, then unanswered. On the 26th of December, a
reply was received, which we unanimously concurred in as
unsatisfactory, when it was resolved to seek the mediation of His
Excellency Sir Charles Darling, who advised us to place ourselves in
communication with you as the responsible head of the department, at
the same time intimating that if found necessary the whole subject
could be afterwards submitted to his consideration.
?In accordance with His Excellency's suggestion we, on the
12th of January, obtained an interview with you at your office in the
presence of the Colonel Commandant, w r hen, after a lengthened
discussion and full consideration, you were pleased to ask us ? what
would satisfy us ?? to which we replied that we claimed to be gazetted
as Medical Officers Unattached to the Volunteer Force or otherwise
placed on the staff. You then rejoined ? 1 will gazette you, and if
there is a doubt about any of your commissions I will give you new
ones.? Fully relying on this very distinct promise we waited patiently
for over two months, thinking that this delay probably was
attributable to the pressure of important public engagements, but
learning that the true cause of delay originated with the Volunteer
office, and as some of us were anxious to attend the review at Sunbury
we had again the honor of an interview, at which the Colonel
Commandant was again present and stated that he had sent a notice to
the Gazette , and asked us if we had not seen it, although it afterwards
appeared that was impossible as the Gazette was not published till the
following evening. On being made aware of the nature of the notice
thus referred to, we then and there intimated our dissatisfaction there-
with, inasmuch as it did not carry out tbe instructions and promise
made at the interview' of the 12th January, in fact it conceded
nothing. You then stated you would send our names to the Gazette
Office and commenced writing them down. Immediately after this
interview and in order to prevent any misunderstanding, it having
occurred to us that as the Colonel Commandant had stated that a notice
had been forwarded to the Gazette Office and with the view of
avoiding any unnecessary trouble to you, we had the honor to reiterate
in writing our previously expressed declaration that any notice which
did not contain our names in full would be unsatisfactory or not in
accordance with your promise and instructions. We cannot avoid
calling your attention to the fact that the Gazette notice above referred


to bears date the 21st March, the very day of our last interview with
you at which a statement was made and question asked by Colonel
Anderson whether we had not seen the notice in the Gazette as it had
been forwarded two days previously. On the same occasion also,
Colonel Anderson appeared anxious to re-open the whole subject and to
urge the objections previously taken by him and disposed of by you.
?In reply to our letter of the 21st March, you refer us to the
Colonel Commandant, which we must beg respectfully to decline.
?In conclusion, we respectfully submit that the foregoing facts
must have escaped your recollection, and as it is very clear your orders
have not been carried out we beg respectfully, but firmly, to claim the
fulfilment of your promise.?
We have the honor to be. Sir,

Sir, ?I am directed by the Honorable the Treasurer to
acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 4th instant with reference
to your position in the Volunteer Force as Medical Officers Unattached
to any particular Corps, and to an interview on that subject with him.
I am to state that if you conceived Mr. Verdon on that occasion
to promise to publish the names of all Unattached Officers of the
Volunteer Force, either the Treasurer must have made himself
insufficiently understood or you have inferred from his reply more than
it warranted.
Mr. Verdon at that interview undertook to insert a notice in
the Gazette to remove doubts which were alleged to exist as to the
status of officers Unattached but declined to say that the names would
appear until he had inquired as to the practice of Her Majesty?s service
and consulted with the Volunteer Office, Colonel Anderson having
objected to the publication in extenso on its being proposed by the
deputation.

*Melbourne, May 10th, 1864.
Sir, ? I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your
letter of the 15 th ult., in reply I am desired by the Medical Officers to
remind you that at their first interview with yon they produced, read,
and laid on your table the correspondence which took place between
themselves and the Volunteer Office. The names of the six Medical
Officers who sought information in reference to their position in the Vol-
unteer force were distinctly and clearly mentioned in the bodies of those
documents. Having the correspondence now before them, they cannot
allow that there is any doubt of your having distinctly promised to
publish their names in the Gazette. They do not say that you promised
to publish the names of all the Unattached Officers of the Volunteer
force. But they are unanimous in opinion that you gave them a most
positive and distinct promise to publish their names in the Gazette , nay
more, they have notes of the exact words used by you at the time.
You state ?that at that interview you undertook to insert a notice in
the Gazette to remove doubts which were alleged to exist as to the
status of Officers Unattached, but declined to say that the names would
appear until you had inquired as to the practice of Her Majesty?s
Service, and consulted with the Volunteer Office.? The Medical
Officers desire also to remind you that it was Colonel Anderson?s
unsatisfactory reply to their communication which took them to you
for redress as the responsible head of the Volunteer Department, and
that at their first interview with you on the 12 th January ult,, they are
equally positive no mention was made of any notice in the Gazette
other than your promise to publish their names in it, A member of
the deputation who had been an Army Surgeon informed you that it
was the invariable practice in Her Majesty?s service to Gazette all
Unattached Officers. Colonel Anderson, the head of the Volunteer
Office, was present at this interview, and urged various doubts and
objections, all of which you apparently, at that time, over-ruled. In
conclusion, I am to inform you that the Medical Officers are utterly
amazed at the statements in your letter as to what transpired during
their interview with you at your office, as their remembrance of the
facts is very clear and distinct, and has since been refreshed by notes
taken immediately after the occurrence.

I will give you new ones, and if necessary, I will obtain an order in

that Colonel Anderson, Commandant of Volunteers, was present at that
interview.
And we make this solemn Declaration, conscientiously believing
the same to be true, and by virtue of the Provisions of an Act made and
passed in the Ninth Year of the Reign of Her present Majesty, intituled

UNATTACHED MEDICAL OEFICERS OE THE VOLUNTEER
ARTILLERY.
TO THE EDITOR OF THE AGE.
Sir, ?In your issue of the sth instant is a memorial and
correspondence from Unattached Volunteer Medical Officers to the
Governor and Executive Council, praying that they might be officially
gazetted as Unattached to the Volunteer Force, as is the practice in
her Majesty?s service. As you have published a portion of the corres-
pondence only, I wish, with your permission, to state a few facts in
connexion with this subject, as one of the memorialists who was
present at the two interviews which took place with the Treasurer?the
Victorian War Minister. It will readily be seen by the memorial that
Colonel Anderson failed to do his duty to those Officers at the new
enrolment. The Order in Council by which he does it was evidently
intended to exclude all Officers from the force except the favored few
whom he subsequently gazetted. I make this statement from the fact
that Officers were not chosen by seniority or for good service, and from
his own explanation of the intention of the Order in Council, which
failed to effect the desired object, owing to the bungling manner in
which it was drawn up; as he apparently overlooked the wording of
the commissions, which states, alluding to rank, ?to hold, exercise,
and enjoy the same whilst it shall be the pleasure of her Majesty or the
Governor of Victoria to continue the services of the said corps of
Volunteers.? It so happened that the memorialists, with one excep-
tion, belonged to the Artillery corps, which, at that time, was com-
manded by himself, and he recommended our appointment to the
Governor?we not only were gazetted to that corps but actually
received our commissions to it. Colonel Anderson, in his memo, of
the 26th of November, states ? that it was the intention of the Order
in Council to cancel appointments to the force previous to the new
organisation, but not the commissions.? The remaining clause of this
memo, is almost a positive contradiction, when he says, ? All Officers
who offered their services under the new enlistment, and were not ap-
pointed to corps, retain their commissions, and are available for service,
if called upon, until which time they remained unattached, having no
duty assigned them to perform.? According to this statement, any


officer not offering his services, which means re-embodying himself,
would be out of the force altogether; notwithstanding that he held her
Majesty's commission, which made him liable to be called on at any
time. But, leaving the commission out. of the question, he never
published any instructions for their guidance, to enable them to comply
with his interpretation of the Order in Council. I therefore think that
the equivocal wording of this memo, made it imperative on the memo-
rialists to appeal to a higher authority than his, as it was quite clear
from it that no satisfactory information would be obtained from him.
Accordingly, a deputation of four of the memorialists had an interview
with the Treasurer, when the question w T as fully discussed. Colonel
Anderson was present, and raised various objections, one very grave
one indeed?that if we were gazetted, he would be compelled to gazette
two of the most useless and objectionable Officers in the force. He
was reminded that he appeared to have no recognised rule by which he
acted in making his appointments, as junior Officers were placed over
the head of seniors, others were elected by their companies, others
superseded for no apparent reason. Lastly, he insisted that the
Hotham battery of the Artillery corps was a company itself, and that
the surgeon?s commission was cancelled by the re-organisation of the
regiment, although the Treasurer told him that reading the commission
as a lawyer, he was of opinion that such was not the case. No doubt
Colonel Anderson had forgotten that he had, a short time previous,
written to the Captain who commanded that battery, informing him
that his commission was untouched by it. I may here say that the
deputation were highly pleased with the conduct of the Treasurer
during this interview, as he maintained his position throughout as head
of the department, and appeared to grapple with the shallow objections
raised by Colonel Anderson by at once promising to gazette the memo-
rialists, very much to the Colonel?s evident chagrin, as he afterwards
could scarcely muster sufficient courtesy to bid them good morning.
After this interview, we felt satisfied that justice would be done us by
the Treasurer. We, therefore, waited patiently for over two months,
thinking he might have forgotten it, when the deputation sought and
obtained a second interview with him, to ask the cause of the delay.
On reaching the Treasurer?s office we found Colonel Anderson already
there. The Colonel appeared to be master of the position, and inquired
on our entrance if we had not seen the notice, as he had forwarded it
to the Gazette office two days previous. When the said notice did
appear it was dated from the Volunteer office the very day he made the
statement. We did not expect to encounter him on this occasion, but
were not long in learning that the aspect of affairs had changed, and
that he had taken advantage of the long delay to impress on the
Treasurer his previously expressed ideas; as he endeavoured to again
open up the whole subject, on ascertaining the nature of the notice


from the Treasurer, wo reminded him that it would not fulfil his
promise, and that it was useless to us, as our commissions did already
confer all the privileges proposed in such notice. The Treasurer then
said he would send our names to the Gazette office, and wrote some oi
them down on a slip of paper. On retiring from his office we thought,
from the position assumed by Colonel Anderson, that there might still
be a hitch somewhere. We therefore wrote to the Treasurer stating
that any notice which did not contain our names would not relieve us
of the unjust reflections cast upon us in the first instance, and would
not be satisfactory. He replied, referring us to Colonel Anderson,
saying that the question was one for his consideration more than for
his own, although it must be borne in mind that he had a short time
previous given his distinct pledge that the names should be gazetted.
A notice signed by Colonel Anderson did appear in the Gazette a few
days after this intimating that commissioned officers were to be regarded
as having the privilege of unattached Officers to the Volunteer force.
There could be no doubt about this notice, it was intended as a master
stroke to defeat the memorialists who had dared to appeal from his
authority. Appearing to concede, yet conceding nothing. We then
submitted a plain statement of the whole facts from the beginning, to
the Treasurer, thinking it possible his memory mighffliave failed him.
He replied, attempting to introduce into the dispute ? all unattached
Officers ? of the Volunteer force, and in plain terms denying the vera-
city of our statement, which compelled us to fling back so foul an
accusation, accompanied by a solemn declaration as to its truthfulness.
We then felt bound to submit the whole correspondence to his Excel-
lency the Governor, as intimated in the first instance. Now, Sir, I
must take exception to the false issues, which were placed before the
public in your leading article of yesterday. The dispute is not about
the nature of the Treasurer?s Gazette announcement, but is simply this:
Colonel Anderson disrated the memorialists at the time their corps was
reorganised, and not as you here stated, ? amalgamated with others,?
and refused to inform them why he had done so. They went to the
head of the department, the Treasurer, and asked him to reinstate them.
He promised to do so, but failed to perform his promise. If any
seeming want of courtesy was displayed by us it was only in self-de-
fence. As to the vanity which you charge us with I assure you the
present commandant has made the ? distinction ? of Military Surgeons
costly if not questionable. You ask on what grounds we claim a
recognition which we did not seek to extend to our fellows ? To which
I answer that we belonged to a distinct branch of the service, and to
one corps, and had no authority to act on behalf of any other Officers.
It was not for the mere love of the idle distinction which it conferred
but from a spirit of self-respect, and a determination not to allow any
man to ? snub ? or treat us in any other respect superciliously. If


civilians gave more attention to the Volunteer force, the paid staff
would not absorb the enormous sum of over eleven thousand pounds.
I agree with you, that he who does his duty best is entitled to the most
distinction. But does he get it, under the present rule ? I have no
objection to your preferring the Treasurer?s version of the dispute,
although opposed by four of the memorialists; but I think your
remarks with reference to it is not calculated to encourage that ? patri-
otic and manly ? spirit which you so applaud in the Ballarat Rifle Bangers.
The inconsistency of recommending them to do the same act which you
condemn us for, I leave you to explain, and am content to abide by
the decision of the public, when the whole of the correspondence
comes before them. I am, Sir, your obedient servant,

His Excellency states that it cannot be expected that he should offer
any opinion upon the controversy as to what actually passed between
the Treasurer and the Memorialists at the interview referred to in the
memorial but, that as regards the question of the position which the
Memorialists now occupy under the Orders in Council of the 14th and
16th of October, 1863, he concurs in the opinion, that the appoint-
ments of the Memorialists were cancelled by the order first mentioned.
Further, His Excellency remarks, that as a commission is originally
given for the purpose of carrying into effect an appointment he is
inclined to the opinion that the commissions of the Memorialists w r ere
also virtually cancelled by the same Order in Council.
I have the honor to be, Sir,
Your most obedient servant,
E. J. SYMONDS.
J. G. Beaney, Esq.
This minute of His Excellency the Governor infers that a legal
opinion had been placed before him in conjunction with our Memorial,
as in that document we did not ask his opinion on the validity of our


Commissions, but simply wished to lay before him for his consideration
the treatment we had received at the hands of the Volunteer authorities,
as this minute raised doubts in our minds as to tTie legal interpretation
of the Orders in Council of the 14th October, 1863, we resolved on
obtaining the highest legal opinion on the subject. . ?
