THE UNEARNED INCREMENT : ITS NATURE.
Let us begin by taking the incr�ment in
its simples! and clearest form.
Suppose I buy Government land at �1
per acre, and quietly holding on while
roads are being puahed forward, settle-
ment extending and land values rising,
refuse offer affcer offer till the prioe
reaohes �2, when I sell out. Of these
�2, one I h�ve aoquired by direct pur-
chase ; �1 worth of money for �1 worth
of land ; but the other I h�ve done noth-
ing to acquire.
It may be quite right for ail that, that
I should h�ve it. That is not the point
at pr�sent. The point at pr�sent is
aimply to explain the terni, and to show
not only what it direotly means, but what
it indireotly implies, for it implies a great
deal?muoh more than moat people h�ve
any idea of.
I h�ve neither done anything to create
this inorease of value nor rendered any
service in return for it. If a sovereign
were suddenly to drop into my pocket
from the sky, it would not bo more com-
pletely unearned.
But it has not only been unearned. If
that were ail, it would be no great matter.
If, like the sovereign, it had dropped
from the sky, then, though I might be
undeservedly the richer, nobody else
would be the poorer. My gain would be
a olear addition to the sum total of human
wealth, out of whioh others besides my-
self would in one way or another d�riv�
benefit ; and, whether or no, whatever
benefits one without injuring another is
fair subjeot for congratulation.
But it has not only been unearned it
has been drawn from the earnings of
others. My gain is others? loss.
If I sell goods or perform work for an-
other, then no matter how high I may
charge for the goods or the work, I am
rendering goods for goods, service for
service, earnings for earnings. What I
offer is my labour, or the fruits of it, and
as the public are free to get the same
goods or services elsewhere if my ternis
don?t suit, or lo go without them, the
faot of their aocepting my ternis shows
that the thing I offer is, under the cir-
cumstances, worth the money.
But in the case of this unearned in-
cr�ment on land there is no pretence
of any exohange. I offer for it neither
labour nor the produoe of labour. AU
I do is to place my hand on a certain
portion of the earth?s surface, and say,
?No one shall usa this without paying
me for the mere permission to use it.?
I am rendering no more service in return
for this extra pound, either to the pur-
ohaser or to society, than if l had ao-
quired exclusive tille to the air, and
charge! people for permission to breathe.
And, if instead of selling my land for an
additional pound I let it at a proportion-
ately additional rent the prinoiple would
be the same.
The inorease of value in my land has
arisen from the ex�cution of public works
and inorease of population, causing an in-
creased demand for the land ; in other
words, it has arisen from the national pro-
gress ; and I, so far from aiding in this
progress h�ve aotually hindered it, by
keeping my property locked up, and so
forcing on intending producers to inferior
or less accessible lands ; and by holding
so muoh land back h�ve helped to make
land so muoh scarcer, and, therefore,
so muoh dearer, and so h�ve helped to in-
orease the tribute whioh induatry has to
pay to monopoly for the mere privil�ge of
exerting itself.
I h�ve employed my land not as an
instrument of production, but as a means
of extortion. I h�ve brought it, not to
use but to prevent other people from
using it without my purohased leave ; not
to earn anything by it but to obtain the
power of demanding the earnings of
others.
Suppose certain parties knowing that
a road would shortly he made into a par-
tioular r�gion, bought from Government
the privil�ge of plaoing bars across the
road (when made) and forbidding any-

body to pass until he had paid toll ; toll
not (as under the old State tolls) to pay
for the maintenance of the road, but toll
for the mere permission to pass along the
road. Kvery one would reoognise that
this toll was pure blaokmail and not
earnings, and the obstruetors mere para-
sites lioensed to prey upoa the public.
But where is the diff�rence between block-
ing the road and blocking the land
that the road leads to 1 Where is the
diff�rence between levying blaokmail on
the transport of goods and levying it on
their production ?
But it will be said, ?It was with real
earnings that I bought the right to de-
mand this payaient.?
True. But the point is that whether I
bought it or stole it, the thing I h�ve
bought or stolon is the privil�ge of levy-
ing blaokmail upon industry ; of demmd-
ing somethiug and giving nothing in re-
turn ; of laying my hand on the earth?s
surface and saying to ail and sundry,
? Give me of the produce of your labour
or get out of this, So much a year if I
choose to let it ; so much in a lump sum
if I prefer to sell it. ? Whichever of the two
forms the demand assumes it is called by
political economists ? rent,? and by that
name I shall henceforth call it, because
that is the accepted name, because there
is no other compact and handy terrn by
whioh to express it ; but it is not to be
confounded with rent in the l�gal and
commercial sense, whioh includes interest
on the cost of improvements. The rent I
shall mean is eoonomioal rent oaly ; the
price oharged for the mere use of the
land as suoh, either without any improve-
ments or apart from them, I shall mean
? ground rent ? in short.
The faot that it was with real earnings
that I bought the land for whioh I charge
rent does not make rent earnings. I may
invest earnings in buying a share in a
pirate vessel (as a great writer puts it),
but the proceeds o� piracy are not thare-
fore earnings.
It is the nature of the business whereby
I make money, and not the manner in
whicli 1 got intoit that makes the
diff�rence between earnings and appro-
priation.
Earnings mean taking payment for
goods or service rendered ; appropriation
means taking something and giving
nothing in return, no matter whether the
taldng be l�gal or ill�gal, or how I ac-
quired the privil�ge of taking. �nyone
can recognise thatit is one tliing to charge
for the fish I oaught in the sea, and quite
another thing to charge for permission to
fish in the sea ; one thing to charge for
produoe I h�ve raised from the land, and
quite another thing to charge for per-
mission to raise produoe from land.
? Still I h�ve the right to make this
charge ?? I am not disputing that.
If Government, with the full consent o�
the governed, issued lioenses authorising
to rob on the highway, the robbers, I
suppose, would be justifled in acting on
their privil�ge ; but their gains, ail the
same, would be appropriation and not
earnings, no matter how high they paid
for their lioense or how honestly they
came by the money to pay for it. And
if the public, disgusted with the System,
demanded its imm�diate abolition, the
robbers would bave a daim to compensa-
tion ; but their compensation would h�ve
to be assessed, not by tha amount of
plunder they had expeoted to make, but
by the fee they had paid for their lioense
and the actual loss to whioh, in one way
or another, they had been put by the
sudden abolition of a privil�ge they had
honestly paid for.
But it wili be said, ? Rent is the resuit
of a free contract.?
Is it ? The Italian psasaut who agr��s
to pay to the brigand on the mountain so
much a year in consid�ration of not being
x'obbed makes a contract, but is it a free
contract? If he refuses to pay it the
brigand will take his earnings ; if the
applioant for land refuses to pay rent the
landlord will refuse to let him make any
earnings, Where is the great diff�rence
between the two cases ? There is a con-
tract in eaoh case, and the one is about
as free as the other.
?But,? it will be said ? in practice
the rent of an estate repr�senta real earn-
ings in the shape of improvementa made,
as well as mere permission to use the land,
and how can you separate the two values.?
Not only is it quite possible to separate
tlxem, but the thing is often done. In
London, for instance, the ground rent
and the rent for the house often belong
to quite diff�rent porsons. In Ulster, again,
the retiring tenant reoeives the value of
his improvements while the landiord
kceps the value of the land. And in
America, I am told, the land and the im-
provements are assessed aeparately and
taxed separately.
But ail this haa really nothing to do


with the subject in hand. My concern
at pr�sent is simply to explain the nature
of the uncarned incr�ment.
Whether the value of the land and the
value of the improvements can be
separated or not, they are quite distinct
�l�ments, just as in a glass of grog, the
brandy is brandy and the water water,
each with its own distinctive properties
and ef�eots, notwithstanding their indis-
tinguishable commixture ; and he there-
fore who lets land levies blackmail upon
industry by oharging for something which
represents no service at ail, none the less
that at the same time he charges for some-
thing else that does represent service.
No doubt there are many other things
besides land in which a monopoly of the
article will enable the possessor to levy
something resembling blackmail ; but
there are points of diff�rence that dis-
tinguish them ail from the pure and
simple appropriation of land monopoly.
The first is that none of them excludes
other people from making a living or
from making earnings to any extent by
other means than the article monopolised.
If by a day?s labour or by pure acci-
dent I find a diamond, I may ask a
prioe entirely disproportionate to the
value of my labour ; but then the public
need not buy my diamond unless they
like. My finding a diamond does not
prevent other people from looking for
diamonds with as much chance of finding
them as I had, and if they don?t think
they are likely to find any by looking for
them they can go without, and be none
the worse.
But every pieoe of land appropriated
shuts out so many other people from that
land, and as ail the land (praotically
speaking) is appropriated, or in one way
or another out of reach of the masses,
they are at the mercy of the landholdera,
and h�ve no choice but either to rent it
from them as tenants or work for them as
labourera on the hardest tenus to which
comp�tition can drive them ; which means
that the landowner has the power of ap-
propriating the greater part of their
earnings in return for the mere permission
to them to earn anything.
Or suppose that, inatead of finding a
diamond, I buy tin, and that next week
the prioe goes up to double?here there
is an additional distinction between my
gains and the land speculators ; for not
only are the public under no compulsion
to buy tin (which they are to rent land),
and not only does tin represent the
r�sulta of labour, and so represent
earnings (which land does not), but the
magnitude of my gain in most cases
represents compensation for great risk.
The earnings of farmers and of miners
may average the same, but the farmers?
average is made up of pretty equal profits
ail round, while the miners? average is
made up of a few big prizes and many
blanks. And what apphes to the miner
applies also to the speculator in mining
produots. His ocoasional large profits
represent compensation for great risks,
and is thus as much of the nature of in-
suranoe as of profit.
No one would think of either mining or
speoulating in mining products unless the
many blanks were compensated by ooca-
sional large prizes. They are the neces-
sary induoements to engage in those call-
ings, and therefore fair earnings when
they corne. Land, however, is not a
sp�culation in this sense (though even if
it were, ita profits would still be appro-
priation and not earnings for reasons
already given). It is a sure investmant
in the sense that it is subjeot to no ex-
traordinary risks; to no more risks, that
is, than suoh as are ins�parable from ail
human enterprise, even the safest.
The value of land, as of everything else,
will oaeillate within certain limits, and
even in sotne exeeptional cases, as in the
sudden diversion of traffic, fall for an in-
definitely prolonged period ; but these
oocasional or exeeptional perturbations
are but as the advance and r�cession of
the waves in a flowing tide. The tide
still cornes in.
In every country which has any enter-
prise and progress, land values must rise.
The movement may be fast or slow, oon-
tinuous or interrupted, but it is up not
down.
There is not a single faotor in a nation?s
progress that does not add to the value of
land. l�very road improved and railway
laid down ; every machine invented and
prooess perfeoted ; every opening of new
markets ; every improvement in fiscal
polioy, in order and good Government, in
the knowledge and skill, in the morals,
manners, and even numbers of the people,
every conceivable element, in short, that
adds to the productiveness of industry
adds to the value of land, and inoreases
the tribute which monopoly can wring
from industry ; which the man who
merely owns the land can exact from him


who uses it for the mere permission to use
it.
This is why the graduai rise of land
value or rent (ground rent only, remem-
ber), is called the unearned incr�ment.
So far for its nature. Our next con-
sid�ration will be its magnitude.
THE UNEARNED INCREMENT : ITS
MAGNITUDE.
Sia,?�nder the System prevailing ail
pver the civilised world every country is
eut up into square pi�ces, and appro-
priaient by a (comparatively) few owners.
What these owners do with the land is
a matter the State oonoerns itself very
little about. Whether they ocoupy and
use it themselves, or let it to a tenant
and live in idleness on the fruits of bis
labour ; whether they cultivate it like a
garden, making it yield abundant wealth
and maintain hundreds of familles, or
leave it in a State of nature to carry
sheep, exoluding the whole tising tide of
population from the opportunity of de-
veloping its boundless resources because
the sheep pay them rather better ;
whether they open out the minerai
treasures hidden in its depths or look
them up by demanding such exorbitant
royalties that enterprise either will
not attempt the work, or attempts and
fails ; whether they construot factories
and build cities upon it, or turn out the
whole population and burn down their
dwellings (as in the Soottish Highlands)
because a foreign millionaire offers them
a higher price for the privil�ge of turuing
it into a wilderness to shoot deer in than
the children of the soil can give for the
mere privil�ge of earning a living ; ail
these things the State regards as matters
of quite seoondary consid�ration with
whioh it is not called upon to interpose,
because that would be interfering with the
? aaered rights ? of property.
The one thing it does conoern itself
energetically aboutis to establish these
? sacred rights ? as fast as possible and in
ail directions, and ensure that every acre
shall h�ve its blackmailer privileged to
exolude everybody else from the land he
bas acquired possession of, and to forbid
acoess to ail industry except on payment
of the heaviest toll whioh the keenest
comp�tition can compel.
The whole country (that is the whole
country worth oooupying at any given
moment) being thus apportioned amongst
these privileged few, they are masters of
The situation. The first thing a man re-
quires is room to stand in ; and there is
no unappropriated room available for the
purpose. If he stands on private land he
is liable to an action for trespass. If he
goes out into the Street, the polioeman
may order him to move on. When
night cornes on, matters are worse.
If he sleeps on somebody?s promises
he can be apprehended for being on the.
promises for an unlawful purpose. If ho
sleeps in the bush he may be looked up
as a vagrant without any visible meaus of
support. The State insists that he
shall pay blackmail to somebody ; not
payment for service of any sort rendered,
but payment for the mere permission to
be somewhere.
Land is the basis of ail industry.
Ail industry oonsists either?
1. In extraoting the raw materials of
wealth from the land ; or
2. In working up, shifting about, or
distributing these materials, or in aiding
in one way or another some of these pro-
uesses.
We shall call the one class prirhary and
the other seoondary industries.
Farming and mining are the chief
examples of the primaries. As to the
secondaries, they are l�gion ; and not
only are ail the materials these last h�ve
to operate upon drawn from the land, but
so are the tools they work with, as well
as the food the workmen consume.
It is clear that the extent of the
seoondary industries will be striotly
limited by the primaries, that is, there
can be no more persons engaged in work-
ing up, shifting about and distributing
materials than there are materials (ex-
traoted from the land) for them to work
up, shift about and distribute?and
not only is the extent of tue secondaries
determined by the extent of the pri-
maries, but so also are the profits in
the secondaries determined by the profits
in the primaries.
Materials must be extracted (or pro-
duoed) from the land before they can be
put to any further use, and men will not
leave this neoessary preliminary work to
take to the seoondary work unless they
can make as much by the new industry as
they could by the old, and they oannot
hope to make more, because, if they disl,
the opening in the seoondary industries
being striotly limited, competitors would
at once flook in and bring their profits
down.


If profita ia the primary industriea
are high, that is, if the land yields
abundantly, and no one stepa in to ap-
propriate the fruits, profita in the
secoodariea will be high too, for otherwiae
people would leave the secondariea and
betake themselves to the land.
If, on the other hand, profits in the
primariea are low ?that is, if either
nature is niggardly or someone (the land-
lord) appropri�tes the fruits ; profits in the
secondariea will be low too ; for otherwise
people would leave the land and crowd
into the secondariea till they brought
profits down.
Now, if ail the land is held by a com-
paratively few people (as is the case), then
since the land is the basis of ail industry,
there will be keen comp�tition for it ?a
comp�tition becoming keener year by year
as the competitora multiply, the resuit of
winch comp�tition will be that the man
of average means and capacity will h�ve
to give the very highest price for the land
that he will consent to give rather than
go without it, and this highest price will
be determined, not by the amount that it
takea out of his pocket,but by the amount
that it leaves behind.
Here, for instance, are three farma of
differing fertility estimated to yield to
the oustomary System of farmiug, �2OO,
�3OO, and �4OO net profit respeotively.
Then, it the first of these fetches, after a
pretty close comp�tition �lOO a year,
this shows that no bidder will give more
than will leave him �lOO to himself, but
that the comp�tition of the others will
not allow him to retain more ; in other
words, that �lOO is the lowest he will
consent to keep, and the highest he will be
allowed to keep, so that �lOO a year is
the average profit of f arming among f armera
of that claas and means. But since he
cannot hope to keep more than �lOO it
does not matter to him what the surplus
may be whioh he is eompelled to give up
to his landlord ; consequently the other
two farms will fetoh respeotively �2OO
and �3OO. Of course, it is the rate of
profit, aud not the actual profit which we
are speaking of. The �lOO is only quoted
aa an example. Amongst one clasa of
farmera the reserve will be higher,
among another lower, according to their
meana and the magnitude of their op�ra-
tions.
This ia the theory, and it corresponds
exaotiy with the facta ; for whether a
farmer settles here or there, near a mar-
ket or far off, whether he pays �lOO a
year for an indiff�rent farm, �l5O for a
better, or �2OO for a better still, he finds
that except by some luoky accident his
profita as a farmer remain muoh the same,
whioh shows that his rent is determined
not by what he has to pay away, but by
what he is determined to keep ; and this
amount, this rate of profit will, for
reasons already given, d�termine the rate
of profit in ail the seoondary industries,
though they h�ve no visible connection
with the land at ail.
To put it oompaotly, the profits of in-
dustry ali round are determined by the
rent of land. That amount of profit
which the worker on the land can save
from his landlord will be ail that the
worker at any industry can hope to get,
and it will represent that minimum
margin to which he will consent to be
beaten down rather than go without the
land,
'What is the minimum margin 1
The applicant for the iaud has a certain
amount of capital (otherwise he could not
be an applicant), and for this he knows
he could get interest, and he has also the
capacity to work. Consequently, the
least he will d�termine to keep will be
what he could earn as a labourer, plus
the interest on his capital. Aotually
(except in the case of the poorest oom-
petitora for the smallest and worst farms)
it will be something rather more than this,
for his capital, auch as it is, gives
him a certain advantage in the position.
He and his competitors being none of
them in danger of imm�diate want, and
therefore not pressed by neoeasity, will
h�ve a tendency to hold back in the
bidding when it begins to run high, and
to oling to something more than the olose-
neas of the comp�tition raight seem to
demand ; and the larger his capital the
greater will be his advantage, not only
beoause of his greater power and stronger
inclination to hold out for better terms,
but also because the men of sufficient
means lo require a large farm, suoh as he
wants, are fewer in number, and the
comp�tition in every way less keen and
forced. Hence the smallest and worst
farms are always the highest rented,
whioh is only another way of saying
that the profits on them are smallest.
Still, be the farms large or small, com-
p�tition will always force rents up, and
therefore profits down to the smallest re-
turn the average applicant of his class


will consent to acoept rather than go
without the land.
Land, as we h�ve said, is the baais of
ail induatry, and agriculture is the fonda-
mental industry.
Everyone reoognises this ; and in view
ofthe hard struggle and hand-to-mouth
existence of the fariner, ail sorts of pro-
jeots are proposed to ameliorate his lot,
One party advoeates protection, another
the lightening and equalising of taxation ;
another the cheapening of labour by
asaisted immigration (makiug the labourer
the soapegoat) ; another pins its faith on
railways, ard so on.
Of these proposais some are good, some
bad ; but their effects, whichever way they
tend, will not, except for the moment,
affect the farmera? profit one way or the
other.
Let us suppose protection to be the true
policy, and raising the prica of some par-
ticular article by a duty, say m�at, see
what the resuit would be.
The rise of price in m�at will produce
two opposite effects. It will immediately
injure one class of farmers and benefit
another. Those who by reason of distance
from market, unsuitability of their land
for grazing, or its still greater suitability
for something else, do not fatten stock,
notwithstanding the rise in price (and
these will be a very large number), will
suffer a distinct appr�ciable �oss in in-
creased household expenses and increased
cost of feeding their men, without any
advantage to set off ; while those
on the other hssnd, with land spe-
ciaKy adapted for grazing, who already
made a profit by it will make a larger
profit still ; and those on land passably
suited for it, who formerly made their
profit by something else, may, perhaps,
change their System, and make their
profit by grazing instead of by those other
things.
But the point is, that after the first
start neither those who gain nor those who
lose will be any the better or the worse
off for their gain or loss, beoause at the
first renewal of their lease they will
transfer the gain or loss to their land-
lords.
Eor so _ long as ail the land of the
eountry is in the hands of a comparatively
few, so that there are more farmers want-
�ng farms than there are farms for them
to h�ve, so long will comp�tition for�a
land values up to their maximum ; and
rent will mean to the fariner the utmost
that he can see his way to giving for the
land rather than go without it and let an-
other take his place.
But for the very reason that comp�ti-
tion is thus already at its full stretoh, it
cannot he stretched any farther, and those
farmers whose narrow margiu of profit is
trenched on by their increased expenses
cons�quent on the rise in m�at will
insist on having that margin restored,
and they will be able to oarry their point,
for they were already giving full value for
their farms, and their farms (sinoe they
produce no more and yet cost more to
work) are now worth l�sa, less not only to
the pr�sent occupants, but to any one
else who might want to take their place ;
therefore, the landlords cannot play off
one against another, and so must aocept
r�duction.
Oonversely, where the profits on land
already profitable for grazing h�ve been
increased by the duty, those lands will
h�ve beoome just so muoh more valuable
and will fetoh so much more rent.
So, if you made a railway to every
farmer?a door you would simply make the
land more valuable. Compare those dis-
tricts that h�ve railways with those that
h�ve none. In the former you will see a
greater population ; probahly, more culti-
vation, oertainly higher rents, but no
higher farm profits ; for where the car-
case is there will the eagles be gathered
together ; where returns are high, thither
will oompetitors flock. There may be no
aotual bidding against eaoh other among
the applicants, but this is only beoause
the landlord will kindly take that trouble
off their hands. He will put up the rent
as high as he thinks he can?too high at
first perhaps?if so his vacant farm will
soon cause him to correct his error, but
whatever the prooess, the resuit will be
the saine.
So if, by assisted immigration, you
reduoed the cost of labour by ha'f, or if
by meohanioal inventions you enabled the
farmer to do with half the number of
men (which would corne to muoh the
same thing to him) you would he simply
reduoing the cost of working the land and
so inoreasing the return to be got out of
the land, and so inoreasing the value of
land, and so raising rents.
One after another labour-saving ap-
pliances h�ve been introduoed within the
last 20 years, double-furrow ploughs,
reapera and binders, horse rakes, steam
thxeshers, without improving the condi


tion of the farmer in the least. Never
h�ve there been so many aids and ap-
plianoes to industry as there are now, and
nsver has the struggle of tha farmer been
more severe.
So if you lightened taxation, or even
aboliahed it altogether, it would make no
diff�rence to the farmer, beyond the mo-
ment. At pr�sent some leases stipulate
that the landlord shall pay ail rates ;
others that the tenint shall pay them ;
others again that each shall pay half, but
it is ail a mere adjustment of rent. The
more taxes the less rent, and vice versa.
If the farmer pays nore rent it is he-
oause he has to pay less taxes, and
wheiher this is owing to the landlord
paying them, or to their bsing none to
pay, makes not the least diff�rence in the
resuit.
So if nature herself instead of the mere
instruments of production were improved ;
if the soil were suddenly doubled in fer-
tility ; if the Sun could begot toshine and
the rain to fall exaotly when and where it
was wanted ; if ail weeds and plagues
were abolished, it would coma to the same
thing, and for the same reasona.
The Press is continually preaohing that
the fault of things ail lies with the farmer.
He should be more industrious or more
provident, he should knowsomething about
chemistry, he should buy the beat appli-
anoes, and use the most advanced
methods. It is very good advice in its
way perhaps, but it does not touch the
question in the least.
If yen passed every farmer through a
technical coll�ge, if by a network of
meteorologioal stations and commercial
agencies you supplied him every day with
a foreoast of the weather, and the
state of the markets, if you supplied him
gratis with ail the beat machinery, if you
trained him in habits of industry and
economy, foreaight and skill, till you
made him as much superior to what he
now is as a ateam thresher is superior to
a flail, you would enormous'y inorease his
efficiency no doubt, but you would not
add one farthing to his profits. The
whole benefit would go as before to the
landlord, and for the same reasons. You
would not h�ve eaaed the pressure of com-
p�tition, but only h�ve put it into the
power of every competitor to offer more.
Still as before, rent would mean the ntmoat
the farmer could be foroed to bid for the
land rather than go without it.
Granting that there are many things
that swallow up much of the surplus that
would otherwise corne to the farmer ;
heavy taxes, injudicious laws, bad roads,
scaroe labour ; ail these matter norhing
(as a great writer says) ao long as behind
them stands something which swallows
ali that is leffc. So long as that something
stands waiting with open mo�t h, abolish-
ing any of these only leaves so much
more for it to swallow,
Some people shrink from these con-
clusions saying, ? it ia a hard doctrine?
(as if truths could be dodged by shtinking
from them). Others say that the remedy
is the fixing of a fair rent.
But what is meant by a fair rent ?
If Brown objecta to his pr�sent rent of
�IOO, saying it is too high, and should be
reduced to �BO, and yet Jones is standing
by pr�parai to give �IOO, why should
the rent be reduced ? Why should Jones
be forbidden to h�ve what he is ready to
give �IOO for, in order that Brown should
h�ve it for �BO 1 It is fair neither to
Jones norto the landlord whatever it may
ba to Brown.
What would Brown think if Jones oh-
jeoted to pay the 6s. for his wheat that he
had agreed to pay, saying it ought to be
reduced to 4s , when Smith is standing by
ready to give ss. 1
In the open market there is no suoh
thing as a fair prioe. Hudibras? saying
still holds good that ? The value of a
thing is just as much as it will bring.?
There is a remedy for this evil, and a
very simple one, but it is not the fixing of
a ? fair rent.?
?But,? it will be said, ?ail farmers
are not tenants. Many own ihe land they
ocoupy.? True ; but ail this can prove
is, not that the preceding remarks are
incorrect, but that there is a certain class
to whom they do not app'y. We will let
the exceptions go for h hat it is worth.
What I shall undertake to show by-and-
bye is that it is worth very little.
But we shall h�ve to pr�sent one or
two othec consid�rations at some length
before we are prepared to deal fully with
this. For the pr�sent we will let it stand
over, only remarking (to quote from a
previous letter) that in farming, tenants
are the rule, oooupying owners the excep-
tion, and that the exceptions grow
steadily fewer year by year. Not only in
Tasmania, but in ail the other colonies,
in the United States, and wherever, in
short land is recognised as absolute pri-
vate property, the divorce between ooou


pation and ownership is proceeding apaoe,
and the very institution which was de-
signed to secure to tlie producer the full
fruits of his labour is beooming the means
by which he is oompelled to surrender
them to another.
THE REAL SU?FERER
As the landlord by virtue of his mono-
poly of the land holds the applicant for it
at his meroy, so the applicant once in
possession holds the labourer at his
meroy.
The comp�tition was first for possession
of the land, it is now for employaient on
the land. The comp�tition is in the one
case open and direct, in the other dis-
guised and indirect.
Labourers do not usually underbid eaoh
other for employaient as tenants ovetbid
each other for possession, but it cornes to
much the same thing as if they did : the
more numerous the labourers in propor
tion to the work to be done the lower the
wages, and vice versa.
If the landlords were to divide their
land into as many pi�ces of equal value
as there were applicants for it, and were
to offer these pi�ces separately, there
would be no comp�tition to run rents up,
and the landlord would h�ve to take
what he could for it?a merely nominal
rent.
To make money by his monopoly he
must keep up its charaoter as a mono-
poly ; that is, he must offer his land in a
single block, so to speak, and so compel
comp�tition.
And just as the landlord forces rents
up by offering his whole land for one
tenants occupation, and so setting ail to
compete for the privil�ge of being that
one, so the oooupier in his turn forces
wages down by eraploying as few labourers
as he can, and so setting ail to compete
for the privil�ge of being among those
few.
The secret of his power over the
labourer is the same as that of his land-
lord over him. It is not in his capital (as
is generally supposed), but in his getting
possession of more land than he can use
by his own personal labour, and prevent-
ing other people from using it by their
Personal labour, exoept for his profit.
The landlord makes the oocupier give
him his money ; the oooupier makes the
labourer give him his work.
In so tar as the oooupier can keep his
wage expenditure below the g�n�ral level
by doing the same work with fewer men,
or paying them less wages, he can retain
the saving to himself ; but in so far as
he only succeeds in keeping down
the g�n�ral cost of labour, he is only
keeping down the recognised cost of work-
ing the land, and so increasing the value
of land, and so raising rent ; and the
resuit of his efforts (as a rule), is only to
keep down the g�n�ral level, for ail are
playing the same game, and any saving
effected by one is soon copied by ail, and
absorbed in a g�n�ral reduced cost of pro-
duction, increasing the value of land and
raising rent.
The productiveness of any industry?
that is, the amount it adds to the g�n�ral
wealth, or to the material comforts and en-
joyments of the people?is measured by
the diff�rence in value between the thing
produced and the materials used up in
produoing it.
Thus, if a carpenter in a day makes a
door worth �l, using up Bs. worth of
timber and nails in the process, the resnlt
of his work has been to couvert Bs. worth
of rough timber into 20s. worth of finished
produot, exhibiting as the measure of its
productiveness a net inorease of 12s.
How this inorease is distributed and ap-
plied?whether, being an independent
artisan, the maker can keep it ail to him-
self, or whether, being a hired servant,
he must be content with his day?s pay,
leaving the surplus to his employer
whether he re�oives his share in advanca
or has to wait for it ; whether he con-
sumes it or saves it up?ail these make no
diff�rence to the faet that the increase
was 12s.
The maintenance of the labourer forms
no part of the real cost of production, for
the labourer has to eat whether he works
or not.
The proceeds of labour, generally
speaking, are divided amongst three
people, the labourer, the employer, and
the landlord. No one reckons the land-
lord?s or the employer?s maintenance as
part of the cost of production, and yet
they persiat in reckoning the labourer?s as
such. Relatively, to the employer, it may
be, but abao�utely, to the country, it is
not.
Everyone seea that the landlord?s and
employer?s maintenance is merely the use,
or one of the uses, to which he puts his
share ; well, the labourer?s maintenance
is merely the use, or one of the uses, to
which he puts his share.


The employer always has to waifc for
his share till the product is realised,
whiie the labourer generally, and the
landlord sometimes, reoeives his in ad-
vance ; and the employer sometimes
makes a miscalculation and gives
more to the landlord in rent, or to the
labourer in wages than a due regard to
his own profit would warrant ; or the
enterprise may misoarry, and there be
no increase to divide, or to make good
what he has advanced. But suoh miscal-
culations and failures do not affect the
truth of the proposition that, taking in-
dustry as a whole, wages, profits and rent,
are the three diff�rent portions into whioh
its prooeeds are divided. And since, as
we h�ve seen, the comp�tition for posses-
sion of fhe land keeps profits down to a
minimum, either rent will be determined
by wages, or wages by rent, that is to say,
the larger the share of the prooeeds the
labourer gets, the less will there be leftfor
the landlord, and vice versa, but as the
landlord owns the land, he is master of
the situation, and rent d�termines wages.
But to say that rent d�termines wages,
is to say that rent devours wages. The
labourer gets so little because the land-
lord gets so muoh.
Note. ?I h�ve adopted the division
into rent, wages and profits, instead of
into rent, wages and interest, because
though less scientifically acourate, it is
suffioiently acourate for my pr�sent pur-
pose, and enables me to keep my subject
within more manageable liants.
Bent devours wages.
Suppose the labourer to ask for a rise
and the farmer to refuse, on the ground
that he cannot afibrd it.
But presently something happens. A
rail way is made or a mine opened in the
neighbourhood, or some improved pro-
cess enables a greater yield to be obtained
at the same cost, and there is now an ap-
pr�ciable surplus. �he labourer cornes
forward again and say s, ?You can
afibrd it now.?
? �nfortunately, no,? replies his em-
ployer. ? I might h�ve done so, but my
lease is nearly up, and these advantages
you refer to having made the land more
valuable, my landlord has notified that he
means to raise the rent ; and as there cer-
tainly is a greater surplus available for
rent than there was, I must give it, for
if I don t someone else will ; and so, as far
as I am concerned, the surplus you calou-
late upon has vanished.?
In short, whenever there is an inorease
in the produotiveness of industry
creating an additional surplus, and
the labeurer stretohes forth his hand
for a share of it, the landlord
pushes him aside, and takes it ail him-
self ; but as he keeps well out of sight
in doing so, using the employer as his
instrument, his action is not perceived.
And as it is in the pr�sent soit has been in
the past. Inventions and discoveries h�ve
within the last century doubled the pro-
ductiveness of industry over and over
again, but the labourer has no more
benefitted by themthan the employer has.
The inorease has been enormous, but in
the primary industries at any rate, the
landlord has taken it ail.
But some will say, ?The labourer?s
exertion is a fixed quantity. The
increased produotiveness of his industry
is in no degree due to himself, but
to the improved appliances he works
with, and, that being so, the person
who supplies these appliances?that is,
the employer?has a right to the in-
orease.?
There is enough prima fade appearance
of reason in this to h�ve made it worth
discussing if the employer really got it,
but he does not. It is the landlord, who
has neither invented, nor supplied nor
put to use the appliances, who gets the
whole benefit of them.
To see that it is rent that devours
wages, look at it another way.
Suppose the labourers demanding an
inorease and being refused, were to say
? Well, in six months we shall strike,
so look out ; meanwhile we shall pr�par�
for the struggle.? So they save money,
subscribe funds and organise ; and at the
time appointed pr�sent themselves, pro-
visioned and prepared.
What would happen?
Would the farmers refuse, and so ail
industry cease, or would they consent to
pay more than they oould afibrd and go
bankrupt ?
Neither of these things would happen.
The farmers would simply turn to their
landlords and say, ? You see how it is.
We cannot afibrd higher wages, and the
labourers won?t work without them.
Accept a reduced rent, or we throw our
farms on y our hands.?
What could the landlolds do ?
Their rents are determined by comp�ti-
tion, and here is comp�tition suddenly
corne to a stop. They must make the


beat of the situation, and aocept the r�-
duction.
And so industry would go on as before,
and the farmers make the same profit as
before. Ail that would h�ve happened is
that labour would h�ve gained a mardi
upon monopoly and the labourer h�ve
wrested frora the landlord a part of the
blaokmail he-was aocustomed to pay.
For it is the labourer chiefly from whom
it is wrucg It is by keeping down
wages that the landlord thrives. The
employer is merely the instrument, who
for a consid�ration, eut down by comp�ti-
tion to the lowest figure, undertakes ail
the trouble, the risk, and the odium of
the squeezing.
The price of labour, like the price of
everything else, is determined by supply
and demand, and it is said that if em-
ployment is scarce it is because there is
net profitable employmenton the land for
ail. Ah ! but profitable for whom 1 For
the labourers 1 for the country, or for one
or two privileged people ?
Here is a farm, selected from the as-
sessment roll of this district as a fair
sample of a so-oalled agricultural farm,
oonsisting of 610 acres andrented at �l5O.
It keeps, I believe, at the outside, two
men at work the year round; any other
applicants for employment being dismissed
with the formula, ?No work for y ou.?
Two men to a whole square mile !
And this on a farm within 15 miles of the
port of Hobart, and containing hardly an
acre unfit for cultivation.
Ail the produoe that cornes off this
farm has to be raised by the labour of
these two men, and must r�alis� over and
abeve their wages and keep and ail col-
lat�ral working expenses, a surplus of
rent, �l5O ; rates and taxes, �2O ; em-
ployer?! profit (say), �IOO ; total, �270 ;
being a profit of �,135 to eaoh man. No
man, in short, is allowed the opportunity
to earn a living on this square mile of
cultivable land unless he produces, over
and above the supply of his own modest
wants, a net annual surplus of �135 to
hand over to somebody else.
If employment is restricted, it is
land monopoly that restricts it.
It is not that there is not abundancs of
land to use, abundance of use.to put it
to, and abundance of profitto be made from
it, but that the tendency of monopoly is
to keep hungry mouths off rather than to
take willing hands on. It is natnrally
conoerned only to get as big a share as
possible to �tself, and is not conoerned
whether other people h�ve a chance to
get a share or not.
The occupier will not engage more men
than he can help.
But smpoae his hand isforced.
Suppose the Trades Unions were to
change their taotics (as they may do any
day), and instead of trying to restrict the
field of employments were to undertake
to extend it. Suppose a Trades Union of
farm labourers were to say to the farmer,
?You h�ve been aoenstomed to employ
two men only ou this farm. Well, not a
man shall take service with you unless you
undertake to engage four, and at the
same wages.?
Does anybody doubt that the two extra
men could produoe more than they con-
sume and use up, and so be productively
employed? And if the net surplus to
hand over to the landlord were less, why
he would h�ve to take less.
The earnings of tke two extra men,
reckoning their wages and keep only,
would be �IOO a year, and if that left a
surplus of �2O less for the landlord, there
would still be �BO to the good. For, as
I h�ve elsewhere pointed out, the
labourers maintenance (much more his
whole earnings), so long as he replaces
what he re�oives, is not oost of produc-
tion but profit. If an industry does
nothing more than maintain one man con-
tinuously it is to that extent productive.
But the landlord?s position is too
strong for hira to stand in much fear of
suoh combinations as these, and the
whole tendency of affairs is to increase
his power.
The landlords as a class get more,
without the least exertion, outlay, or
risk, out of the labour of the community
than they could if the whole working
community were their slaves.
PROLETARIANISM V. SLAVERY.
Suppose 1 own a sugar estate and 100
slaves, ail the land abouc being held in
the same way by people of the same olaas
as myself.
It is a profitable business, but there are
many expans�s and annoyanoes attached
toit.
I must keep up my supply of slaves
either by breeding or buying them.
I must pay an overseer to keep them
oontinually to their work with the lash.
I must keep them in a state of brutish
ignorance (to the d�triment of their


efficiency), for fear they should learn their
rights and their power, and beoome dan-
gerous.
I mu�t tend them in siokness and when
past work.
And the slaves h�ve ail the vices and
defects that slavery engenders ; they h�ve
no self-respect or moral sense ; they lie,
they steal, they are lazy, shirking work
whenever they dare ; they do not care
what mischief their carelessness occasions
me ao long as it is not found ont ; their
labour is obtained by force, and given
grudgingly ; they h�ve no heart in it.
AU these thiogs worry me.
Suddenly a briiliant idea strikes me.
I refleot that there is no unoocupied land
in the neighbourhood, so that if my
labourers were free they would still h�ve
to look to me for work someho�.
So one day I announce to them that
they are ail free, intimating at the same
time that I will be ready to employ as
many as I may require on such terras as
we may mutually and independently
agr��.
What could be fairer 1 They are over-
joyed, and falling on their knees, bless
me as their benefactor. They then go
away and h�ve a jollification, and next
day corne back to me to arrange the
new ternis. Most of them think they
would like to h�ve a pi�ce of land and
work it for themselves, and be their own
masters. Ail they want is the few tools
they h�ve been accustomed to use, and
some seed, and these they are ready to
buy from me, undertaking to pay me
with reasonable interest when the iirst
crop cornes in, offering the crop as
seourity. As for their keep they can
eas�y earn that by working a few weeks
on and off on any of the plantations, or
by taking a job of clearing, fencing, or
such like. This will keep them going for
the first year, and after that they will be
better able to take care of themselves.
But ?softly,? I observe, ?you are
going too fast. Your proposais about the
tools and seed and y our own maintenance are
ail right enough, but the land, you mu�t
remember, belongs to me. You oannot
expect me to give you your own liber ty
and my land too for nothing. That
would not be reasonable, would it 1?
They agr�� that it would not, and begin
to propose terms.
A fa .cies this bit of land and B that.
But it soon appears that I want this bit
of land for my next year?s clearing, and
thait for my oows, and another is too close
to imy house, and would interf�re with
my privaey, and another is thick foreata
or iswarnp, and would require too long
antfl costly pr�paration for men who must
hawe quick returns in order to live, and in
shorrt that there is no land suitable that I
car� to part with. Still lam ready to do
wh�at I promised? 1 ?to employ as many
as I may require, ou such terras as we
may mutually and independently agr��.?
But; as I h�ve now got to pay them wages
inshead of getting their work for nothing,
I cannot of course employ quite so many
of tlhem. I can find work tor 90 of them,
however, and with these I am prepared to
discjuss terms.
Alt once a number volunteer their ser-
vioe�s at such wages as their imagination
has been picturing to them. I tell the
90 whoae demanda are most reasonable, to
stamd on one side. The remaining 10
look blank, and seeing that sinoe I won?t
let tfhem h�ve any of the land, it is a
question of hired employment or starva-
tiom, they offer to corne for a little less
tham the others. I tell these now to
stamd aside, and 10 others to stand out
inat?ad. These look blank now, and
offert: to work for less still, and so the
? miutual and voluntary ? settlement of
termis proceeds.
Brat, meanwhile, I h�ve been making
a litttle calculation in my head, and h�ve
reckroned up what the cost of keeping a
slav?, with his food and clothes, and a
triflee over to keep him contented, would
corne to, and I offer that.
TBiey won?t hear of it, but as I know
they can?t help themselves, 1 say nothing,
and jpresently first one and then another
give� in, till I h�ve eot my 90, and still there
are l! 0 left out, and very blank indeed they
look.. Whereupon, the terms being
settlffid, I graciously announce that
thoujgh I don?t really want any more men,
still �� am willing (in my be' evolenoe) to
take the 10, too, on the same terms,
whioih they promptly accept, and again
hail une as their benefactor, only not quite
so rajpturously as before.
Soo they ail set to at the old work at the
old pfiace, and?on the old terms, only a
little; differently administered ; that is,
that whereas I formerly supplied them
with food, clothes, etc., direct from my
stores, I now give them a weekly wage
repreisenting the value of those articles,
whicHi they will henceforth h�ve to buy
for tlhemselves.


There is a diff�rence too in some?other
respects, indioating a moral improvement
in our relations.
I can no longer ourse and flog them.
But then I don?t want to ; it?s no longer
necessary ; the threat of dismissal is quite
as effective, even more so ; and much
pleasanter for me.
I can no longer separate hushand from
wife, parent from ohild. But then again,
I don?t want to. There would be no
profit in it ; leaving them their wives and
children has the double advantage of
making them more contented with their
lot, and giving me greater power over
them, for they h�ve now got to keep
these wives and children out of their
own earnings.
My men are now as eager to corne to
me to work as they formerly were to rua
away from work.
I h�ve neither to buy nor to breed
them ; and if any suddenly leave me, in-
stead of letting loose the bloodhounds, I
h�ve merely to hold up a finger or adver-
tise, and I h�ve plenty of others offering
in their place.
I am saved the expense and worry o�
incessant watohing and driving,
I h�ve no sick to tend, or worn out
pensioners to maintain. If a man falls
ill there is noth�ng but my good nature to
prevent my turning him off at once ; the
whole affair is a purely commercial
transaction ; so much wages for so much
work. The patriarchal relation of slave-
owner and slave is gone, and no other has
taken its place.
When the man is worn out with long
service I can turn him out with a olear
business conscience, knowing that the
State will see that he does not starve.
Instead of being foroed to keep ray men
In brutish ignorance, I find public schools
established at other people?s expense to
stimulate their intelligence and improve
their minds, to my great advantage, and
their children compelled to attend these
schools.
The service I get, too, being now volun-
tarily rendered (or apparently so) is much
improved in quality.
lu short, the arrangement pays me
better in every way.
But I gain in other ways besides peou-
niary profit. I h�ve lest the stigma of
being a slave driver, and h�ve aoquired
instead the character of a man of energy
and enterprise, of justice and benevolence.
lam a ?large employer of labour,? to
whom the whole country, and the labourer
espeoially, is greatly indebted, and people
say, ? See the power of capital ! These
poor labourers, having no capital, could
not use the land if they h ad it, so this
great and far-seeing man wiaely refuses to
let them h�ve it, and keeps it ail him-
self, but by proHding them with employ-
ment his capital saves them from pauper-
ism, and enables him to huild up the
wealth of the country, and his own fortune
together.?
Whereas it is not my capital that does
any of these things. It is not my capital
but the labourer?s toi! that builds up my
fortune and the wealth of the country.
It is not my employaient that keeps him
from pauperism, but my monopoly of the
land forcing him into my employaient
that keeps him on the brink of it. It is
not want of capital that prevents the
labourer from using the land, but my
refusing him the use of the land that pre-
vents him from acquiring capital. Ail
the capital he wants to begin with is an
axe and a spade, which a week?s earnings
would buy him ; and for his maintenance
during the first year, and at any subs�-
quent time, he could work for me or
for others, turn about, with his work on
his own land. Henoeforth with every
year his capital vould grow of itself, and
his independence with it ; and that this is
no faney sketch, anyone can see for him-
self by taking a trip to our North-West
Ooast, where he will find well-to-do
farmers who began with nothing but a
spade and an axe (so to speak) and worked
their way up in the manner descrihed.
But now another thought strikes me.
Instead of paying an overseer to work
these men for me, I will make him pay
me for the privil�ge of doing it.
I will let the land as it stands to him
or to another, to whomsoever will give the
most for the billet.
He shall be called my tenant instead of
my overseer, but the thing he shall do
for me is essentially the same, only d me
by contraot instead of for yearly pay.
He, not I, shall find ail the capital,
take ail the riak, and engage and supervise
the men, paying me a lump sum, called
rent, out of the prooeeds of their toil, and
make what he can for himself out of the
surplus.
The comp�tition is as keen in its way
for the land, among people of his class, as
it is among the labourers for employ-
ment, only that as they are ail possessed


of some little means (else they could not
oompete)theyarein no dangerof imm�diate
want, and oan stand out for rather better
terms than the labourers who are foroed by
necessity to take what terms they can get.
The minimum in eaoh case amounts
prac ioally to a ?mere living,? but
the mere living they insist on is
one of a rather higher standard,
than the labourer?s ; it means a rather
more abundant supply, and better quality
of those little comforts which are next
door to nece>saries. It means, in short,
a living of the kind to which people of
that class are acoustomed.
For a moderate r�duction in my profits
then (a r�duction equal to the tenant?s
narrow margin of profit) I h�ve ail the
toil and worry of management taken of�
my hands, and the risk too, for, be the
season good or bad, the rent is bound to
be forthooming, and I can sell him up to
the last rag if hefails of the fullamount, no
matter for what reason, and my rent
takes precedence of ail other debts.
Ail my capital is set free for invest-
ment elsewhere, and I am freed from the
odium of a slaveowner, notwithstandiug
that the men still toil for my enrichment
as when they were slaves, and that I get
more out of them than ever.
If I wax rich while they toil from hand
to mouth, and in depressed seasons find
it hard to get work at ail, it is not, to ail
appearance, my doing, but merely the
force of ciroumstances, the law of nature,
the state of the labour market ; fine
eounding names that hide the ugly reality.
If wages are forced down, it is not I who
do it, it is that greedy and merciless man,
the employer (my tenant) who does it. I
am a lofty and superior being, dwelling
apart and above such sordid consid�ra-
tions. I would never dream of grinding
these poor labourers, not I ! I h�ve
nothing to do with them at ail, I only
want my rent ?and get it. Like the
lilies of the field I toil not, neither do I
spin, and yet (so kind is Providence !) my
daily bread (well-buttered) cornes to me
of itself. Nay, people bid against each
other for the privil�ge of finding it for
me ; and no one seems to r�alis� tbat the
comfortable income thatfalls to me like the
refreshing dew is dew indeed, but it is the
de w of sweat wrung from the labourer?s toil.
It is the fruit of their labour which they
ought to h�ve ; which they would h�ve if
I did not take it from them.
Is thia caricature 1
Take the farm of 640 acres before re-
fferred to, rented at �l5O, and keeping
ttwo labourers. Oould I, the landlord,
imake �l5O a year net profit out of the
llabour of these two men if they were my
Eslaves, and the tenant my hired overseer,
?working them under the lash 1 I trow
mot.
I should h�ve to pay him, about �l5O a
year as overseer instead of getting it from
Ihim as a tenant, which makes �3OO a year
lleeway to make up, to begin with. I
�should h�ve to find ail the oapita' which
ihe now finds (practioally) for my use ;
tto run ail the risks where I now run
none ; while the men, working in sullen
discontent, would not produce near as
much as they do now. No, thank you !
]lf the lot were offered me as slaves for
nothing, I wouldn?t h�ve them at the
?prioe. I get more out of them as things
are, and I give absolutely nothing in
:return ; ail that Iget is pure blackmail.
Some of these days the labourer will
wake up to the facts of the situation. If
the awakening be sudden and uni versai
he will seize the broom and make a clean
sweep, tabing small aooount of the beetles
he may tread upon, or the crookery he
may break. An awakening of this sort
happened once in France, and we know
what it was like. He had terrible wrongs
to avenge, and he went mad over them,
and in his madness comraitted great
crimes ; but where he swept he swept
clean ; the abuses he swept away h�ve
never shown their heada sinoe.
But thsre was one abuse that he did
not recognise to be an abuse, and so he
left it standing?to his loss.
Next time he sweeps he will clear that
away too.
There is small fear of his ever going
mad over it again, for his knowledge,
and the consciousness of his power are
growing year by year ; and by the time
that he reoognises the facts of the situa-
tion, and sees what the change is that is
wanted, he will be strong enough to
say calmly, ? Let it be done,? and it
will be done forthwith without violence or
wrong.
LAND MONOPOLY NOT ONLY ABSORBS THE
FRUIT OF INDUSTRY, BUT ALSO HINDERS
ITS PROGRESS.
This System of allowing any one person
to obtain absolute ownersMp of as much
land as he oan get, and to use it (or not
use it) in what way he likes, not only


absorba the fruits of industry, keepiug
down employers? profits and labourera?
wages, and making lifo, to ail who h�ve to
live by work, a struggle for existence, but
it also restriots the field of employaient,
locking up the greater part of our re-
sources from full productive use, and so
hindering progress ; and it can only secure
its profit by so doing.
It is claimed in favour of the System
that once the land ia appropriated to an
owner, it becomes that owner?s interest
to aee that it is put to the most productive
use ; and that rent is the test of produo-
tiveness sinoe that form of industry that
can offer the most rent raust be the most
productive.
Never was there a greater mistake.
The man who can afford to give the
highest rent is not he who can make the
land produoe most, but he who can secure
the largest ahare of the produce to him-
self, and he can often more easily do this
by keeping other people off the land than
by engagiug them to make it produoe
more ; lor more produoe generally implies
more hands to produce it, and more
hands imply more daims to a ahare in the
produce.
If by one form of industry (say sheep)
I can make the land produoe �IOO, of
which I can keep 170 to myaelf, I will
evidently prefer it to another (say agri-
culture) by which I oould make the land
produce �2OO, but would h�ve to pay
away �l5O to other people for their share
in the work, and this none the
less that it may take many times more
land to produce the �IOO than it would to
produoe the �2OO
Here is an estate divided into five
farms, each farmer emplo�ing two
labourers the year round, and raising
�4OO worth of produoe apportioned as
follows :
Direct assistance in the shape of wages
to the two labourers, representing
their earnings ... ... ... �IOO
Indirect assistance in the shape of
blacksmiths, saddlers, carriers
work, goods bought, and services
hired of ail sorts, equal to the
earnings of two mea more ... 100
Rent ... ... 100
Profit to farmer 100
�4OO
These five farms together, then pro-
duce annually �2,000 worth of produoe,
and maintain 25 men with their f�rai ies,
viz., one employer, two labourers, and
indirect assistants equal to two men more,
to each farm, besides the landlord, who
receives �SOO.
If now a stockbreeder sees his way,
with the help of one man as shepherd
and g�n�ral assistant, to produce �BOO
worth of wool and fat sheep off the five
farms lumped together, he can offer �550
rent (�SO more than the five agrioultural
farmers put together), and yet, after pay-
ing �SO to his man and �SO more for such
goods and services as he may require
(representing the maintenance of another
man) keep �l5O for himself (half as much
more than any of the agriculturists). His
offer of course will be accepted. and tho
five agriculturists with their retainers will
ail h�ve to go.
The amount of produce raised from the
land will be only �BOO instead of �2,000,
and the numbers of men (with their
familles) will be three instead of 25.
The productiveness of the land will
h�ve been reduced to less than half, and
the population to about J.
But suppose the land instead of being
apportioned amongst five farmera, pro
ducing �4OO and paying ren t �IOO each
had been divided amongst 100 oottier
labourers, produoing only �SO of produce
and paying �3 rent each.
Then tho land would h�ve been pro-
duoing �5,000 worth of produc* instead of
�2 000, and maintaining 100 men (with
their familles) instead of 25 ; but inasmuch
as the landlord would only h�ve been re-
ceiving �3OO rent, this arrangement would
h�ve been even more certainly and
speedily outbid and swept away than that
of the five farmers
? But the 100 cottier labourers could
not h�ve turned the land to account if
they had had it.?
Oould they not ?
Here is a market garden, there an
orohard. The owner in each case, a
man of means making a hand-ome in-
come by the labour of a few men with
common spades and hoes. Would the
land yield any less, or the produce be
worth less if these labourers were working
it for themaelves instead of for an em-
ployer 1
Oould they not buy ail the tools they
want by merely saving up a week or two?s
wages 1
Could they not turn any proportion
they hked of their produce into bacon,
eggs, poultry, butter, things for which
the demand is practically unlimited ?


Could they not sell tor less if need
were, and yet thrive, than an employer,
seeing that wages alone would satisfy
them, while an employer must make a
good profit over and above their wages 2
But as we h�ve aeen, the whole surface ot
the earth (so to speak) is parcelled out
amongst a body of monopolists, who will
not al ow the labourer to produoe any-
thing unlesa he producea a large surplus
over and above for their enrichment.
While the landlord gets ail the profit
(so to speak) ot the mon?s work the oc-
cupier and employer get ail the cr�dit.
He is the produoer. The men are merely
the tools he worka with, like the spades
and hoea.
Produoer ! He produees nothing. It is
the labourera who produce ail, only, ashe
holds the land, he will not allow them
to produce, except for his profit.
There is not a shilling of his inoome
that is not due to their labour.
If he d�cid�s to apply manure they
fetch and spread it ; if he keeps the
ground clean and well worked it is their
arms that do it ; when he sells his pro-
duoa it is they who gather and doliver it.
I count it nothing that he flnds the
tools ; that he arranges the work ; that he
keeps the acoounta ; that he takes the
risk. I count nothing he does as any-
thing which the men could do j ust as well
for themselves, and they could do ail these
things.
?Thenwhy doesn?t the labourer get
the land and do it 2?
Who will sell him the three or four
acres he requ�tes for any price within his
means ? Near a town the labourer would
h�ve to pay �2O to �IOO an acre ; in the
country no estate owner will sell him
what he wants except at an extravagant
fanoy price, hard y at any price at ail.
Owners do not like to out pi�ces out of
their est�tes, nor to h�ve small indepen-
dent settlers about them. They would
rather. sacrifice something generally to
keep them out.
They will let the land no doubt some-
times, but not only do they usually ask
an extravagant price as rent directly a
small piece of land is asked for, groatly
in excess of what they could make off it
themselves, but they offer no secnrity of
tenure, no guarantee for improvements.
What heart will the labourer h�ve in
effeoting the high cultivation which his
System demanda when he may he turned
out anytime at short notice 2 How can
Ihe plant a tree when he has no certainty
cof ever gathering the fruit 2 How build
Ihimself a dwelling when he knows it
?an never he his h 'me 2
How can he throw his heart into his
work with the shadow of an irr�sistible
lhand ever over him ready to turn him
oout and confiscate his improvements
whenever self-interest,caprioe, or a change
?f ownership so d�termines 2
Here is explanation enough why the
llabourer is not in possession of land, but
tthere are other reasons still which it is
mot neeessary here to stay to consider.
I shall be told though that the term
most productive ? does not mean pro-
tducing the greatest bulk or weight or
eeven the greatest gross value, but the
fgreatesc net profit.
Quita trua ; but profit to whom 2 To
orne partioular peraon only, or to ail en-
<gaged in it 2
Take the case of a farm ?
The earnings of ali the blaoksmiths,
ssaddlers, importera, carriers, etc., who
lassist the work, as well as of the labourera
who carry on the work are as much net
iprofit as the earnings of the farmer who
(conducts the work.
AU alika represent services rendered in
ffurthering the work, the production of a
icrop ; and for ail alike there can be no
ireturn from the work till the work is
Iflnished ; till the crop is gathered.
But as there would be great incon-
wenience if ail had to wait for their re-
tturns till the work was finished an
arrangement bas been naturally fallen
iinto by which, while the work is divided
amongst many, the control, the responsi-
Ibility and the risk are concentred in one,
Ithe farmer, who advanoes to each his
sshare, by giving him a fair proportion to
!his service, and makes what he can out of
tthe surplus.
The profit of the crop is the gross value
mf the crop less the seed, manure, and
mther goods consumed and wear and tear
?of tools; ail the rest represents profits
;apportioned amongst a number of people,
tsome of whom receive their ehare in
advance, and others h�ve to wait.
The profit mada by the manager of the
enterprise, (the farmer,) no more repre-
sents the produotiveness of the enterprise
than the salary of Mr. Manager Kayser
represents the produotiveness of Mouut
Bisohoff. Ail the farmer?s or manager?s
profit represents, is that share of the
produce which the comp�tition of his


olass for the office of farmer or manager
compels them to be content with.
Our habit of estimating the productive-
ness of every industry by the profit of
one person, only ont of the many con-
cerne!, viz,, the employer, is about as
sensible as if we estimated the size of a
building by the size of a pavticular brick
in it.
That industry ia the most productive
which couverts raw raaterial into finished
produot to the greatest value and in the
ahortest time, and the greater the number
of people who are engage! in it and the
larger the share of the prooeeds that each
can get the better, but the tendency of
�and monopoly is to allow as few people
as possible to take part in the work, and
to let them get as small a share of the
proceeds as possible ; for in the eyes of
the monopolist, whether owner or occu-
pier, other people and their earnings are
merely so many expenaes to be kept
down.
As the landlord?s interest is for each to
own as large a portion of the earth?s
surface as possible to the s�clusion of
other people so that comp�tition for its
possession shall he stimulated and rents
forced up, so the interest of the occu-
pier is for each to oultivate as small a
portion as possible so that the field of em-
ployment may be restrioted and wages
kept down.
If each ocoupier were to put to f ull pro-
ductive use ail the land in his possession
the demand for labour would run wages
np, and so, though the production of
wealth would be enormously increased, it
would be divided amongst a much larger
number of people ia much larger
shares, ieaving less for himself ; but by
shutting out say 9 lOth of his land from
full productive use and inviting employ-
aient on the l-10th only the field of em-
ployment is narrowed and wages are kept
down.
It is true, as we h�ve seen, that though
he gets the profit of this he cannot keep
it, the landlord taking it from him. Still
the necessities of his position compel him
to try to get it, and in this way
I do not say that either landlord or
ocoupier acts in this way of set design.
Each simply acts for his own in.erest in
what he would call a ??practioal? way ; that
is he guides his oonduot by results, without
troubling himself how the results are
brought about.
The landlord, fer instance, lets his land
in such sized pi�ces as he finds fetch most
rent (that is in large pi�ces) without oaring
why pi�ces of such size fetch most rent,
and, therefora, without being consolons
that the reason is that by this means its
oharacter as a monopoly is kept up and
comp�tition for it stimulated.
Similarly the ocoupier keeps most of
his land under natural pasture, and only
cultiv�tes a small part, the best, beoause
the larger part so used, though it yields
much less, costs nothing, and so he gets
ail the profit there is, and does not see,
or oare to see, that it is his keeping this
larger part out of cultivation, that by
restriotmg the field of employment and
so keeping wages down enables him to
secure to himself the fruits of the
labourer?s toil on the part he does oulti-
vate.
In Great Britain this abuse by which
the rights of the many are sacrifice! for
the profit of one has been carried to such
an extent that whole counties h�ve been
nearly depopu'ated ; and districts in the
Highlands that, as Geo. Macdonald tells
us, once turned out 1,000 fighting men
now only carry a few gamekeepsrs.
The children of the soil h�ve had their
dwellings burnt down before their eyes,
and they themselves bave been driven
forth in thousands to emigrate to distant
lands, to crowd into the already over-
crowded eities, or, as in some cases, to die
on the mountains ; not because they
could not pay their old accustomed rent
but because a foreign millionaire offered
the landlord more for the privil�ge of
turning the country into a wilderness to
shoot deer in than they could give for the
bare permission to live ; a System that
permits such atrooities is self-oondemned.
As to Ireland, her population has
within half a century sunk from 8 millions
to 4 millions, though knowledge and in-
vention h�ve within that period so in-
creased the productiveness of industry
that it ought to h�ve risen to 16 millions ;
and yet the cry is still that it is over-
populated, and her sons h�ve to emigrate
by thousands yearly.
But to see the fruits of land monopoly
in hindering industry and keeping down
population we need not go out of our own
island.
Within five miles of this is an estate
that was once called the granary of Tas-
mania. It is now a sheep run,
First came the absentee landlord, who
living 12,000 miles away cared nothing


for his estate, but to squeeze al! He could
out of it.
Next came a worse form of land'ordahip
still, a landlordship of trust�es, in which
the very possibility of a Personal intereat
was destroyed, and under which the
estate fell into worse and worse condition,
houses ia ruins, fences falling to decay.
Last came the kind of landlord on
whom so many pin their faith, the oc-
cupying landlord, and he swept ail the
farmers off the land, and turned it into a
sheepwalk.
I am not blaming him. He aoted on
his strict l�gal, and in one sense �quit-
able right. The �aw allowed, and we may
say encouraged him to buy the land in
absolute possession to do with it absolutely
as he liked, and he naturally liked to do
with it in the way that paid him beat.
It is the System, not the individual that
is to bl�me.
But to judge of the System by such
cases as these is to get a very inad�quate
idea of the evil of it. To get a true idea
of this we h�ve to consider the cases not
only of cultivation stopped that was
already in existence, but of cultivation
prevented where it has never been allowed
to corne into existence at ail. The holders
of such lands are only doing what every-
body else does, and has a recognised right
to do, making the most they oan for them-
selves out of their capital and their land,
though land is not capital, it is to them the
same thing as capital ; it is what they
h�ve exchanged so much capital for, and
from which therefore they h�ve a right to
draw the best profit they can in the way
that seems best to them.
The wrong was in allowing them to
acquire this right?in selling the people?s
birthright for a mess of pottage?in giving
over, for the trumpery consid�ration oi
�1 an acre or so, to any purchaser the
l�gal power to exclude the whole human
race from as large a portion of the earth?s
surface as he chose to buy.
William Rufus was oonsidered a cruel
despot for turning ail the inhabitants out
of what was afterwards called the New
Forest to make himself ahunting ground,
but the landlords in this free self-
governed country could do the same thing
to-day with the whole of Tasmania if they
liked, and oall in the offioers of the law to
help them to do it.
I am myself a repr�sentative of the
System I denounce. I might sell, no
doubt, and so get out of it ; but what
good would that do ? I can serve the
good cause better in a number of ways
by staying ia than by going out?amongst
other ways, by affording one standing
example of a landlord pleading for land
nationalisation and offeriug his own land,
or, at least, so much of it as may be
wanted as the first to be taken for the
purpose at its actaal value, as may be
deoided on, whatever System may be
adopted.
KEVIEW OF THE SITUATION.
J-/et us review the situation.
Here, ia the primiry industries, are
farmers running rents up to the point at
which they can barely make both ends
meet ; temporary outsiders?men who
h�ve been outbid, vainly Icoking out for
a farm for months, and foroed to take one
at last on almost any tenus ; permanent
outsiders?men brought up to farming
and thoroughly understanding it, but
squeezed completely out of the comp�ti-
tion who are uow dealers, butchers, one
thing to-day and another to-morrow,
soraping up a living as best they can.
And as profits in the secondaries are
determined by profits in the primaries.
The state of affaire is the same in these.
Here are traders, half as many again as
are wanted in every township, running
eaoh other down in pri�es, touting for
custom with travelling agents and flaming
adyertisements, giving reokless cr�dit in
their scramble for customers, and every
now and then the weakest breaking down
and falling out of the ranks only to be
succeeded by fresh aspirants trying to
force themselves into the throng, and
each with capital more or l�sa which he is
eager to invest in the business he is try-
ing to seoure.
This in a country not a oentury old,
containing barely six inhabitants to the
square mile, a country with resources
that ita Press and public speakers are
never weary of extolling, a country con-
taming more natural resources than coun-
tries with ten times its population, with
tens of thousands of acres fit for cultiva-
tion and untouched, with timber in such
quantifies that we pile it in heaps and
burn it to get it out of the way, with
minerais in ahundance, with fish in our
seas, with an equable climate, with every-
thing in our favour ; and yet men struggle
for employment and capital bids for in-
vestment.
Surely if we saw half a dozsn men in a


10-acre field struggling for room and
gasping for breath, we should think it a
.strange spectacle, and wonder what it
meant ; and yet it would not be a bit
more strange than our own condition, and
not half so interesting.
For the production of wealth there are
but three factors required, land, labour,
and capital. Strie tly speaking, two
only ; land and labour (= matter and
force) for capital is but the produot of
labour saved up and accumulated.
Still it is customary to reokon the three,
so we shall continue to do so,
Which of the three is it that is wanting
to us ? Is it land ? The question is
absurd. The land lies ail around us ery-
ing out to be used. Is it capital ? There
is not an enterprise put forlh ofiering
good promise for which capital is not
forthooming in abundanco. Whether it
be a brewery, a trusteeship company, or
a mine, the shares are snapped up at once,
not to speak of that other capital without
praetical limit acrcss the water ready to
pour in at the slightest encouragement.
Is it labour ? Why, the very essence of
our oomplaint is that people are struggling
for work to do, not work languishing for
want of people to do it.
What are chiefly the resources that we
talk so much about ? Sureiy not the un-
trodden forests beyond the farthest roads ;
not the minerais we suspect but h�ve not
yet located ; not the inaccessible and the
undisoovered ; but the resources that lie
ail about us, visible to the eye and pal-
pable to the touch ; the occupied lands
with roads through them and houses on
them of which a mere fraction bas been
oleared, the cleared lands of which a mere
fraction is oultivated, the oultivated lands
that, tilled in the roughest fashion, yield
but a fraction of what they might ba made
to yield.
It is not the want of land on the one
hand, or of labour and capital on the
other that is the matter with us, but the
artifioial barrier of monopoly that keeps
these factors apart.
We spend vast sums in roads and rail-
ways to open up new land, and as fast as
we open it up we sell, for a paltry �1 an
uore or so to anyone who applies, the
right of shutting it ail up again if he
likes, with the certainty that he will like
to shut up the greater part of it.
We try to import labour and entice over
capital. Labour and capital ! into a
country where labour (that is people
trying to earn a living) ia struggling for
every opportunity to live, and capital has
burnt its Angers so often by rushing into
rash ventures that it hangs baok dis-
heartened.
Labour and capital ! As if the way to
ease the pressure of a crowd was to
squeeze more people intoit.
Break down the barrier that confines
the crowd, and let it spread, and then if
there is roora for more, more will corne
of itself, more both of labour and capital,
only too glad of the chance.
How oan labour or capital find employ-
ment when every national resouroe is in
the hands of some monopolist who has got
hold of other people?s shares as well as
his own, and puts the greater part of it to
the mere mockery of a use, while for
the rest he either frightens enter-
prise away by his extravagant de-
manda or forcing comp�tition runs his
blackmail up to the uttermost the
user will give, so that new-oomers, if you
had them by the thousand, would not
offer more ; and if they did, could only
get in by displaoing others.
Take any natural advantage you like to
name?extent of area, minerai deposit,
or commanding situation?and what is
not in reasonable use already is either
looked up for sheep or barred by extrava-
gant demanda for royalties or paid-up
shares ; or, if in use, is let out for the
uttermost it will fetch.
We h�ve now reached the point at
which we can take up the objection, pre-
viously postponed, that ? ail l'arme s are
not tenants,? and the implication that were
they ail to own the land they occupy,
objections must vanish.
But it ought to be olear by this time
that if ail exisiing landlords were swept
away and ail the land in use confirmed
absolutely upon the occupiers, things
would be no better than they are now.
For the evil that weighs upon society,
hinderingprogress, forcing down earnings,
and making life to ail who h�ve to live by
work a struggle for existence is the
monopoly of the land ; and whether it is
A or B who monopolises it, is of no
cons�quence to anybody but A and B.
Wherever one man is allowecl to acquire
more land than he can lise by his own
labour for the purposes of preventing
other people f rom udng it by their labour
except for his profil , that man is master
of the situation, and the clasa of which


He is the repr�sentative has the world at
its feet. And whether the monopolist
turns hia monopoly to aooount aa an
occupying owner by working the labourera
for hia profit direotly, or as a non-ocoupier
by selling to somebody else (called a
tenant) for a yearly payaient (called rent)
the privil�ge of working them, is a diff�r-
ence not worth talking about.
Indeed if the System is to go on, it ia
better, in sonie respecta at any rate, for
society at large and the labourer in par-
ticular that the owner and the oocupier
should be separate persons.
For where the land is in the hands of
a mere tenant he is foroed to put it to
sufficiently effective use, to make it r�alis�
enough to pay his rent over and above his
own profit, whereas, as expsrience shows,
wheh he has no rent to pay, he is often
tempted to take things easily, and work-
ing enough of the land to keep himself
comfortably, put the rest to very poor
use indeed in order to save himself trouble,
expense, and risk.
This is by no means au unusual resuit
of occupying ownership. There are many
occupying owners who, having no rent to
pay, yet make no more off their farma
than other men not more comp�tent,
who h�ve a good stiff rent to meet, and
this merely beoause finding themselves
able to make enough easily to keep them-
selves in the style they h�ve been aoous-
tomed to, they do not trouble themselves
to earn more.
And the eaaier the oocupier takes
matters, and the less use he makea of his
land, the less employaient there is for
labour, the more wages and profits are
kept down, the less raw material is there
raised for the seoondary industries to
conoern themselves with, the more diffi-
cult it is for carriers, artizans, trades-
men, and workers of ail sorts to get a
living, and the keener the struggle for
existence ail round.
No. King Logis worse than King
Stork. The whole System is a legalised
robbery of the publie, and what we want
is not to change the robbers but to stop
the robbery.
In Ireland they are now trying to set
matters right by ohanging their robbers.
The landlord?s rent is to be reduoed bit
by bit till nothing of it is left, but tha
monopoly of the land is to continue. The
tenant is to become the landlord.
What diff�rence will that make to the
labourer, who will still h�ve to compete
for the privil�ge of working for his profit
so much of the land as he graoiously
allows them employaient on ?
What diff�rence to the thousands who
h�ve no land nor employment on the
land, but are forced to struggle for exist-
ence beoause the land is not put toits f ail use 1
What diff�rence to the oouutry whose
natural resource are still left in the
ahsolute power of a class whose iiterestit
is to hold back the greater part of those
resouroes in order to narrow the field of
employment, and so force wages and earn-
ings down and their own profits up.
There is but one remedy for this great
wrong, the nationalisation of the land.
We in Tasmania, like our co-thinkers
in other parts, h�ve established a society
for this purpose, viz , for ? the graduai
nationalisation of the land [as opportunity
of�ers and public opinion ripens ; ? and
my whole purpose in these pages has been
to lead up to the �lucidation and advocacy
of our views, and to give notice and
opportunity to ali who may wish to loin
our ranks.
The State, gradually resuming possession
of the land on �quitable terms, is to apply
the ever-inoreasing unearned incr�ment to
the r�duction of taxation, and the
multiplication of public benefits. The
ocoupier is to become a State tenant, but
on a tenancy that while it seoures to the
State the full value of the land from year
to year and provides for its bona fide use,
yet assures the tenant as perfeot security
of tenure and of the fruits ot his labour
as if the land belonged to him.
The occupation of large tracts by a
single person (exoept for temporary use
in places where it is not yet wanted for
other people) will be done away with, and
the land eventually made so accessible to
ail that every person, even the humblest
shall bave the opportunity if he wishes it
of acquiring, within accessible distance of
a market, of enough land to make him-
self a home and for the exercise of his own
Personal labour.
We are not fanatical enthusiasts ex-
pecting to overtnrn long established insti-
tutions in a day. We reoognise that we
h�ve a long and uphiil work before us,
and that we cannot live to see the full
fruition of our desires, but we are
confident that fruition will corne in time,
and we hope to see the work at least
begun in our day. There are abundant
signs ail over the world of forces at work
in our faveur.


AH our efforts for the pr�sent will be
to elucidate and disseminate our views,
to interest and educate the public, and to
aet with ail the force of a compact
organised party to carry any l�gislative
measures that help to bring us a step
nearer to our end.
OUR PRINCIPLES AND PROPOSALS
Our prinoiple is that the legi�mate use
of the land is as an instrument of produc-
tion, not as a means of extortion, and its
possession to be permitted to secure toits
possessor the fruits of hia own labour, not
the fruits of other people?s.
Our aim is to break down the barrier
that keeps the two faotors of production,
land and labour (the matter and force of
industry) apart, and throw open to full
productive use the resouroes of the
country. To abolish the accursed
monopoly that lives upon industry as the
tiok lives upon the sheep, sucking its juices
and hindering its growth, and thrives, not
by doing a hand?s turn or oontributing a
penny?s worth for the good of society,
but by getting possession of the means
of existence, and making people pay for
the permission to live.
To appropriate the unearned incr�ment
of the future to the State, taking its vast
and constantly aocumulating wealth
from those who do not croate it, and
giving it those who do, by applying it to
the r�duction of taxation and the multi-
plication of public benefits.
Above ail, though unfortunately not
before ail, to give the labourer acoessto the
land, and consequently the choice between
working for himself and working for
another, instead of, as at pr�sent, between
hired employment and starvation.
This last, whioh should be first, we are
obliged to postpone, beoause till the
labourer begins to reoognise hisrights, and
to demand their r�cognition by the State
it is uselesS for others to move on bis
behalf. He must be bis own deliverer.
Others may point out the way for him to
go, his must be the force to break down
the barriers of vested interest and class
pr�judice that bar the way.
For the pr�sent we propose four simple
measures only ; not one of them represent-
ing any new or revolutionary prinoiple,
but giving prinoiples already recognised
and acted on a more extended applica-
tion ; not one of them seeking to con-
fisoate the wealth of any one, no matter
how improperly that wealth may h�ve
been acquired ; not one of them interfer-
ing with the course of industry, but on
the contrary ail together opening out a
thousand fresh channels for it to flow in.
These four proposais are ;??
1. That no more public land be
alienated on any consid�ration
2. Thatthe State beempowered to retake
possessionof any particular landwhichmay
be required in the public interest, giving
fair compensation for the land taken, and
letting this land out in lots of limited
size at a rent subject to periodical r�vi-
sion at stated intervais, and the rent
raised as the value of the land (apart from
its improvements) rises, or �owered if it
should chance to fail, and to give the
occupier the assurance of undisturbed
possession so long as he fulfils the simple
and reasonable conditions of his tenure
(unless it should be required for a railway
or some such very sp�cial purpose) with r�-
cognition of his right to the value of his
improvements (if the land should be taken
from him) at the time of the taking.
3. That it is the surface of the land
only that is let for ordinary productive'
purposes ; ail minerai rights being
reserved.
4. That the absorption by the State of
the unearned incr�ment on lands which
it does not retake in possession be com-
menoed by taxation on the unimproved
value of the land, beginning with a
moderate peroentage, and gradually in-
creasing.
This is ail we propose for the pr�sent.
For the future we will be guided by oir-
cumstances.
Inregai?d to the first proposai?? That
no more public land be alienated,? the
State already exercises its power of re-
serve, often over large areas, as in the
case of minerai lands. We propose to
apply it to ail cases.
In regard to the third, ? The r�ser-
vation of minerai rights,? the praotice of
reserving rights in letting land is so
commou that nothing further need be
said aboutit.
In the case of minerais being discovered,
the State could either let the right of
working them, compensating the occupier
for loss and disturbance, or could leave
them to be worked by the occupier at a
fixed royalty, or on such terms as might
seem best.
In regard to the fcurth. ? The taxa-
tion on unimproved value,? it has been
objeoted that it is a class tax. Well,


there are many class taxes levied for
diff�rent reasons, generally good and
sufficient ; there is (or was) the oarriage
tax, levied as a tax on luxuries ; there is
the auotioneers? license fee, levied as an
indirect way of taxing the transfer of
stock at public sales. There is the
chemists? license fee, a way (in
part) of securing that the making
up of prescriptions and the dispensing of
drugs be confined to properly qualified
persons ; so also we propose a tax on the
unimproyed value of land as a step
towards the graduai abolition of the Sys-
tem of blackmailing industry, and towards
the restoration to the State of what it
should never h�ve parted with.
In regard to the second (kept till the
last because it requires most comment)
the power to the State to retake land
wanted in the public interest, and the re-
letting of it on the conditions sketched
out ; the State already has the power to
take land for railway purposes. But as
there ia nothing specially sacred in the
nature of a railway to raake it an excep-
tion to ail other works of publie utility, as
it is simply a conoern of great public im-
portance, and that is ail the justification
there is for taking the land required for it,
then if we can show (as I think I may
fairly daim to h�ve shown) that the
breaking up of land monopoly and the
throwing open to use of the national
resources is a matter of more cons�quence
than ail the railways in the world, there
seems no conceivable reason why the
State should not take the land for this
purpose too.
As to the circumstanoes under which
the land shall be taken, the manuer in
which compensation shall be determined
and rent re-valued and so on, ail those
are questions of d�tail to be well thought
out and freely and thoronghly disousaed,
but the discussion of whioh would be for
many reasons out of place in a preliminary
address like this. One thing only must
be insisted on ; that the taking, the re-
valuing, the letting, the reoovery of rent
and every process conueoted with the
disposai of the land shall be entirely re-
moved from the control of party politics
and personal influence, and be made
strict processes of law, guided by definite
rules and administered by properly ap-
pointed and independent courts, just as
the valuation of property, the granting of
minerai leases, and the reoovery of rates
and taxes are now.
? But,? we are told, ?you forget the
landl hunger. Man naturally craves for
the labsolute ownership of the soi! hetills,
and: without it loses half the stimulus to
exerrtion. He wants to sit under his own
vin? and fig-tree.?
Hlere are three statements rolled into
one;,
Tfake the last first.
He wants to sit under his own vine
andi fig-tree.?
Unie ; and the resuit of your System
of avbsolute ownership is that 99 men out
of UOO can get no vine or fig-tree to sit
undler, and the hundredth finds that the
vin? and fig-tree under whioh he sits are
not: his but his landlord?s, who charges
himi heavily for the privil�ge, and this
evem though he has planted the tree him-
selff, and watsred it with the sweat of his
toill,
Tear by year, ail over the civilised
woirld the ownership of the land is pass-
ing; out of the hands of the occupier. One
main rears the fruit, another stretehes
fortth his hand and takes it, The very in-
stitution which you defend as securing to
thei produeer the full vajue of his produce
is tihe institution that compels him to part
witsh it.
Iflow cornes this ?
Beoausa the unearned incr�ment,
thoiugh certain, is deferred, and falls,
theirefore, to him who can wait, and who
aociordingly lies in wait.
f�ooner or later the day cornes when a
moirtgage has to be redeemed, or death
brimgs the property into the market, and
thtsn the man of large and independent
meians, who does not mind getting a low
rate of interest for a while in consid�ra-
tion of large profits hereafter, easily out-
bidls the working owner, who has to earn
hisi living, and must h�ve quick returns.
HThus, it is that not only is the rich
nom-oocupying owner fast superseding the
pocorer working owner, but the large non-
oc?upying owners are also eating up the
amiall onea, and the tendency of the times
is ffor the whole land of the country to pass
gnadually into the hands of a few enor-
mcously rich people.
We h�ve not got into this second stage
yeit out here, but we are well on into the
firsst. And so inevitably and steadily land
is ccoming to belong, not to him who has
thce best right toit, not to him who wants
it most, not to him who will put it to the
nuost productive use, or even to any use
at: ail, but to him who can affbrd to give


most for it for the mere purpose of
squeezing other people.
You offer the naine, but you cannot
confer the reality. We withhold the name,
but gaurantee the reality.
For what is the land-hunger ]
It is the natural craving for a perma-
nent home, and for the fruits of our
labour ; and we guarantee both these ;
you do not.
The natural desire of a man is for a
dwelling that he can regard as his home
for so long as he chooses to dwell in it ;
for a piece of land whioh he can culti-
vate and build upon and improve as his
interest may dictate without the fear of
a notice to quit, and the certainty that
when he quits of his own accord he can
r�alis� the full value of his improvements
at the time of his retiring.
If you say further that ail these things
shall be his own you are oonferring no
further privil�ge. You are only summing
up the privil�ges already enumerated in
a compact, sweet-sounding phrase.
That he shall poasess his home so long
as he chooses to dwell in it, his land so
long as he chooses to till it, this is the
land hunger. But to want to own the
land without using it, to leave it and yet
retain the ownership for the mere purpose
of preventing other people from using it
exoept on payraent, this is not the land
hunger at ail.
Direotly a man has lost the desire to
dwell in his home and till his land, and
wants to go elsewhere and live on the
rent, he has lost the land hunger, and
retains only the ordinary desire to make
money.
Therefore, when under these circum-
stances we require him to give up the
land, seouring to him the value of his
improvements, we violate no craving of
his nature ; we only take from him what
he has ceased to value, the land ; and
allow him the one thing he continues to
value, his money, to invest elsewhere.
Further, it is the nature and not the
extent of the occupancy that satisfies the
land hunger. A home and land enough
to afford employaient are ail that is
wanted for the purpose.
The Iriahman's poor oabin is as muoh
his home to him, as the Duke?s palace is
to him ; and an acre or two satisfies the
craving to be working for oneself as
thoroughly as 1,000 acres would. There-
fore so long as we leave a man land
enough to provide him full employaient,
muoh more when we leave him enough to
employ many hired servants, we may take,
at a valuation, the broad acres on which
he merely runs hia flooks without jarring
any legitimate feeling.
CONCLUSION.
Now let us note the r�sulta of our plan
to eaoh of the parties conoerned.
1. lu regard to the disposaessed land-
lord,.
So much land is taken from him, so
muoh money of equal value is returned to
him. He is oertainly no worse off than
before. He is really muoh better off.
Formerly his inoome ceased every time
the land was vacant between one tenanoy
and another, and disappeared altogether
every time a tenant bolted or broke. Now
it is guaranteed to him with absolute
regularity.
Formerly he was oonstantly liable to
demands from his tenants for repairs and
improvements, to whioh he was oom-
pelled, to some extent at any rate, to
attend. Now he is freed from ail this, his
inoome cornes to him without d�ductions.
He is better off ail round for his dis-
possession.
2. In regard to the oooupier,
He holds at pr�sent on (say) a five or
seven years? lease. Ail his op�rations are
bounded by this prospective lirait. No
improvement or enterprise can he attempt
which will not be oompletely repaid with
interest within that evsr narrowing
period. But such a lirait is fatal to the
proper development of the resouroes of
the land. The very first condition neoes-
sary is security of tenure ; not for flve
or seven years, but for so long as the
occupier desires to hoid it, with assur-
ance of full compensation for unexhausted
improvements should he d�cid� to retire.
A hand to mouth System that farms from
year to year is but a step in advance of
the praotice of the savage who supplies
his wants from day to day. To get the
full results from the laud you must im-
prove it. To work the land without beir.g
free to improve it is to work it with one
hand tied. The most valuable works,
those that return the greatest results to a
giveu labour, are those that are most far-
reaohing, but slowest in yielding their re-
sults.
To drain, to plant, to build, for ex-
ample, are things the oooupier must
not dream of. Many a thing that
he sees the land wants, and that


it seems a pity to neglect, must
he leave undone ; and his interest in the
land, little enough at any time, diminishes
daily, till in the last year of his lease he
is in the position of a yearly tenant, a
position proverbially unproduotive and
unsatisfactory for both landlord and
tenant. It is no longer his interest to
manure, to keep down weeds, to effeot
a hand?s turn of tepairs more than
is absolutely and iramediately neoessary.
As the end of the lease approaches he
is further paralysed by the uncertainty
whether his lease will be renewed or not,
on such terres as ho oan accept. He
does not know often whether to fallow
or what orop to sow, or what to under-
take ; and if through the landlord?s ask-
ing too muoh or wanting to r�sum� pos-
session, or for any reason he is obliged
to leave, he has to sell off everything, no
matter whether the times are favourable
or not, and be at a loose end for months
looking out for another farm, wasting his
time and consuming his capital.
Finally he has to take a new, untried
farm, the peculiarities of which he has to
learn by graduai exp�rience, and has
hurriedly to get together fresh stock and
implements. Never has he any abiding
interest in the land ; never ia it anything
more to him than a temporary r�sidence,
and an instrument out of which to squeze
as much money as possible within a given
time.
Turn to State ownership and ail this is
reversed. The tenant is now in as secure
possession of the land as if he owned it
(only subject to a yearly payment) with-
out having to find the capital to buy it.
It is praotically his ; his as a home to
dwell in ; his as an instrument to put to
fullest use ; his as a trust, not as a pos-
session ; but as a trust in which he knows
he will never be disturbed so long
as he faillis its reasonable conditions, con-
ditions devised for the public good not
for the aggrandisement of an individual.
He holds a portion of the public
estate to the exclusion of other people
with equal rights, and therefore he must
pay from year to year the full value of
that privil�ge. As the land rises in value
through the ex�cution of public Works
and the growing prosperity of the oountry
he will naturally h�ve to pay so much the
more for the use of it, but nothing the
more for the improvements he may h�ve
made on it. If from any cause it falls in
value, he will h�ve to pay less. Whatever
its value from time to time, as aaoertained
by periodical valuations, he will h�ve to
pay it.
What could be more reasonable 2
Formerly his hands were tied by the
shortneas and uncertainty of his tenure
and the absence of any daim for improve-
ments. Now his hands are free ; the
i land is praotically his, though nominally
the State?s. It will be less in extent no
doubt ; that is, he caa no longer hold
large areas to the exclusion of other
people, except teraporarily, in remote parta
where the land is not yet wanted for more
productive use.
He can no longer hold more than he oan
personally use for the mere purpose of
preventing other neople from using it ex-
cept for his profit ; but he can hold as
muoh as is his fair share and whereon his
home stands, in perpetuity, and as muoh
more as is not wanted by other people until
it is wanted ; and as the State is not likely
to want it so long as it is being put to
full productive use, and will h�ve to pay
him the full value of his improvements if
it does, the more he improves it the less
likely will he be ever to be disturbed.
Seoure in his tenure, and in the fruits
of his labour the ocoupier will acquire a
permanent interest in his land, and a
pride in and affection for it such as he
has no chance of acquiring now, and will
h�ve every induoemeut rnan eau h�ve to
put it to the fullest use, and draw the
greatest enjoyment from it.
??But as ho has still to pay rent, it
seems ?rent to the full value ?how is he
better off, after ail 1 What diff�rence can
it make to him whether he pays his rent
to the State or to a private landlord 2?
Just the diff�rence between paying
money into the bank to your own acoount
and paying it in to another?s For by so
muoh the more as the State re�oives in
rent the less it requires in taxation.
In paying rent to a private landlord the
tenant pays it away to a stranaer for the
stranger?s enjoyment or enriohment, and
the payer sees it no more. But in paying it
to the State he gets back with oue hand
what he gives with the other ; what he
gives goes to the great public trust�e to be
turned into public benefits of which he
has the full use and enjoyment in corn-
mon with other people.
His payaient to the State, ia short, is not
a payaient away at ail, but an investment,
and generally speaking, the best invest-
ment he makes, There is no outlay from


which we reoeive so many and so great
returns. It seoures for the payer benefits
which he oould not by his own resource,
labour or outlay seoure at ail, and with-
out which he could secure nothing else.
What sort of a living oould any tnan
make if in addition to his ordinary busi-
ness he had to be his own policeman,
road-maker, sohoolmaster, etc. 1
What we pay to the State in taxation
we get in full measure, running
over.
But the returns from State rents are
far greater than the returns from
taxation ; for taxation gives you
those public benefits only in return
for your money, while for State rents
you get the use of a pieoe of land in itself
worth the money, and you h�ve ail the
public benefits thrown in ; or (to put it
differently) for taxation you get your
money baok once only, for the State rent
you get it twioe over.
At the commencement of the System
there may be no imm�diate gain, as far as
mere money payment goes ; for great part
of what the tenant pays to the State in
rent, the State will h�ve to transfer to the
dispossessed landlord as compensation.
It is only as the land increaaes in value
(which it will quiokly begin to do), and
the unearned incr�ment begins to accrue,
that the State revenue will begin to ex-
pand and to go to the r�duction of taxa-
tion and multiplication of public benefits ;
but, from the moment it begins to accrue,
it begins to increase, and inoreases at
aooelerating speed.
3. In regard to the labourer.
As to the labourer?s full rights, which
it is the ultimate aim of our policy to
seoure, that is a subject on which I may
h�ve something to say on another occa-
sion ; but for the pr�sent ail I am con-
cerne! aboutis to show how the par-
tioular initiative measures which our
society proposes will afiect him.
Rent, ss we h�ve seen, devours wages ;
and what enables it chiefly to do sois the
power the landowner or land oooupier has
of restricting the field of employment ; of
keeping back the greater part of the
national resouroes from full productive
use, and compelhng the labourera to com-
pote for the privil�ge of employment on
the small portion which he permits to be
used.
We h�ve but to notice how the opsning
up or enlargement of one particular
department of employment affecta the
labour market to form some idea of the
effeet that would be produced by throwing
open the who�e field.
The undertakiug of a single line of rail-
way sends wages up at once perceptibly
alongthe whole line and for some distance
on each eide. The discovery of minerai
deposits on Crown land, where the
labourer requires nothing but a piok and
shovel and a miner?s right to find employ-
ment for himself at once, sends them up
with a rush.
Throw open ail the land for cultivation
and ail the minerais for development, and
whether the labourer or the capitalist
takes possession, work is wanted ail in
directions ; the labourer either finds work
for his own hand or somebody calling out
for him, and can ask any wages he likes
up to the lirait of the productiveness of
his labour.
If the land is thrown open to the
labourer himself, as m the case of minerais
discovered on Crown land, or of allot-
ments for cultivation on unused land, he
will not work for an employer for less
than he can make for himself ; nor
even for as much, for independenoe is
aweet, and he will rather work for
himself than for another for the sams
money.
To get labour the employer will h�ve to
offer him even more thanhe can make for
himself.
Some people are quite shooked at the
idea of such a State of things. They
think high wages are ruiu to the whole
country, not seeing that the very faot
that wages are so high is a sign that the
country is going, not to ruin, but just in
the opposite direction.
They are so used to seeing the labourer
toiling for a mere subsistenoe, and never
rising above his condition, while the em-
ployer and the landlord share the produoe
of his toil between them, that they h�ve
corne to look upon this as the order of
Nature ; they seem to think that the
people who h�ve money h�ve a right to
the labour of those who h�ve none ;
that the whole purpose of industry
is to provide rent for landlords, interest
for capital, and profits for employers, and
that the wages of the labourer are an
unfortunate necessity of the position, to
be minimised as much as possible ; in
short that Providence has evidently de-
signed and ordained that the fruits of
labour shall go not to him who pro-
duoes them, but to[somebody olse who per


mits or employa him to produce them.
The idea (which you will hear expressed
any day in ail directions) that wages
should be kept down or the abourer for-
bidden to h�ve aoo. ss to the land because
employers in such case could not mske
suffioient profit, means (put in plain
terras) that A, who has little, should get
less, in order that B, who has much,
should get more ; a proposition too absurd
to be di. cussed, but whi-jk jeemsto be a
fondamental article of beliet with almoat
the whole olass of employers.
If the labourer wiil not work for an
employer for wages that will yield the
employer a profit, it is clearly because he
can put his labour to better usehimself,
and if so, it is but just to himself and
good for society that he should so empioy
himself. Indeed it is much better for
society that in such case he should work
for himself rather than for an employer
for it sets the employer?s capital free to
make his own labour more effective, or
his life more comfortab�e.
If I h�ve 1,000 acres and �l,OOO
capital, and h�ve hitherto employed 10
labourers on my land to produee �5OO of
produce, and the land being now thrown
open for s�lection, the labourers can
make the �5OO for themse'ves on half the
land, this siraply sets free the other hal
of the land, and ail the employer?s capital
for other use.
But even if the vast resources which
we propose to throw open are not thrown
open to the labourer personally but are at
once taken up by capitalist employers,
still it will require a greatly iucressed
number of employers and amount of
capital to take them up and put them to
use, and this means a proportionate in-
crease in the demand for labour and con-
s�quent rise in wages.
4. In regard to society.
The throwing open of the resources of
the land means the great increase of both
production and population.
The more farm produce there is raised
and minerai wealth extracted, the mors
commerce, manufactures, and secondary
industries of ail sorts will there be ; for
the greater the produee extracted from the
land, the greater the number of people
must there be required to work up, shift
about, and distribute that produce.
Again, the greater the number of people
in the country, and the greater the
number to the square mile, the greater
the variety of their wants, and the greater
tthe number of trades to satisfy thoae
wants.
Also the more the labourera within a
ggiven area, the greater the opportunity
ffor the division of labour, for the aoquire-
rnient of skill, and for the eoonomy of pro-
c�uction.
The greater the number of people and
tthe more they produee the greater
iwill be amount of rates that can be levied
((if more rates should be wanted) and the
Ibetter the roads, the better and more
mumerous the schools, libraries, hospitals,
;and public conveniences of ali sorts, and
tthe greater the number of people who will
Ibenefit by them.
In short, the advantages to society are
tendless
5. lu regard to Revenue.
The greater the number of people
ssettled on the land, and the greater the
produotiveness of their labour, the greater
the value of the land and the higher the
jrent, and the rent will be State rent, i.e.,
irevenue.
And though this increase of rent will be
ohecked at fiist, and even thrown baok
by the rise of wages (for as rent for-
merly devoured wages, so wages will now
devour rent), Still, this increase of wages
wi l soon reaoh its lirait, while the in-
crease in population and in the produc-
tiveness of labour will be practically
without lirait.
The condition of both employer and
labourer will be continuously xmproviog,
though neither profits nor wages will in-
crease (after the lirait spoken of is
reached.) Increasing rent will swallow
up increasing profits and wages ;
but increasing rent will mean in-
creasing revenue, and increasing re-
venue will mean increasing public benefits
benefiiing ail.
Employers and labourers will continue to
gain, only notas employers and labourers,
but as citizens of the State.
Tax after tax will be kuocked off as in-
creasing State rent swells State revenue
till no taxes are left, and still the increase
will accumulate.
The farmer will h�ve his roads put and
kept wi first-rate order without paying
any rates ; the parent will be able
to get the beat �ducation for his
children without paying any school
fees ; the traveller for a sixpenny
or shilling railway ticket will be able to
go from one end of the island to the

Scholarships and rewards of one kind
or another will by a sort of natural s�lec-
tion pick out al! The sp�cial talent of our
youth and develop it toits utmost pitch,
to the advantage of society and the en-
riohment of its posseasor.
Railways and telegraphs eau be made
in ail directions, libraries established in
every townahip, the best m�dical attend-
ant obt dned at numerous hospitals and
dispensaries at nominal charges/ But the
prospect is boundless. The further wego
the wider it opens out.
Advantages now confined to the wealthy
will be available to the humblest. and yet
no one will be pauperised, beoause the
help that paup�ris�s is that which takes
unjustly from one to give to another, or
takes the form of degrading charity.
But this steady and continuons mul-
tiplication of public benefits will no
more paup�ris� because it is free to ail,
than the rain and the sunshine paup�ris�
because they are free to ail ; for it will
represent neither robbery nor charity. It
will be the produot of the natural growth
of wealth from sources to which ail h�ve
an equal and just daim. It will ail spring
from State rent, and represents the price
paid by eaoh appropriator of natural ad-
vantages for the privil�ge of using those
advantages?advantages to which, being
the free giffc of nature, ail h�ve an equal
right, and for the use of which it can
therefore injure no one?s self-respect to
re�oive payment.
AU that increase of wealth, in short,
which now goes as blackmail to privileged
monopolists will go to public benefits, and
th� amount of that increase will at the
same time be swelled to proportions yet
undreimt of.
This concludes the s�ri�s of letters on
the land.
Hereafter I shall be ready to answer
objections or to give information. But
to those who wish to master the whole
aubject I cannot do better than refer
them to the Works of a far deeper thinker
and better writer than I ; to the man to
whom I owe most that is worth knowing,
Henry George ; and I would recomraend
them to get his ?Irish Land Question ?
price Is., and ? Social Problems ? Is. 6d.,
and if they are prepart d to give their
whole mind and attention toit, but not
otherwise, his great work ? Progreas and
Poverty.?
If any who h�ve read these letters wish
to joiu our society they will please address
Mr. L�o. Susman, Murray-street ; Mr. B.
Ivey, Liverpool and Murray-streets.
