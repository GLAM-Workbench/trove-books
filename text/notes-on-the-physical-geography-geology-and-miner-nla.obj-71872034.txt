per ton, thus conclusively showing a chemical deposit of gold in some post-
miocene tertiary time.
No beds whatever containing marine fauna are known in Victoria
overlying alluvial or drift gold deposits. That there are rich gold drifts,
the result of at least three distinct periods of deposition, is quite certain ;
and it is now almost equally certain that the earliest is not older than
pliocene, while the newest is probably chiefly due to causes still in opera-
tion. In accordance with this view, and for the sake of convenience,
these three auriferous deposits have been provisionally classed as older
pliocene, newer pliocene, and post pliocene (including recent) ?or lower,
middle, and upper drifts ?coloured respectively on the geological maps
yellow, red, and green; the same classification and colouring being also
used to denote deposits, whether marine or fresh water, supposed to belong
to the same age, though not auriferous or derived from auriferous rocks.
The three stages of drift sometimes occur in the same locality without the
intervention of any volcanic rocks, in which case three auriferous
? bottoms,? or gold-bearing strata, are found in one shaft. In
some instances, as in the Ballarat Valley, the oldest auriferous
formation is made up of successive layers of volcanic and sedimen-
tary material, that gradually fill up the old valley and overlap each
other, forming gold drift deposits, or ?washes,? at various elevations,
which are certainly not the result of purely fluviatile action. In following
the ? leads? they are invariably found to deepen in the general direction
of the present surface watershed. Thus, at Ballarat, and other goldfields
on the south side of the dividing range, they deepen in a southerly
direction, whilst at Clunes, Bendigo, &c., they invariably deepen in the
opposite or northerly direction. This fact has given rise to the supposition,
manifestly absurd, that the Ballarat and other deep ? gold leads? will
have a continuous fall till they eventually reach the present sea coast, in
the same manner as existing surface drainage channels. Now, as the
gravels containing the gold deposits are much younger than any rocks
resting on the Silurian along the present sea-board, it is clear that they
cannot pass under the latter, which they must do to reach the sea as
suggested. The facts appear to be that the deposits of pliocene age, of which
the gold drifts are a part, have now a far wider surface range than the
older marine tertiaries that now fringe the sea-board and probably under-
lie a great part if not the whole of the lower Murray plains ; that they have
overlapped the lower and older; and that, though they are richly auriferous
when chiefly derived from, and resting directly on, the Silurian rocks, they
gradually cease to be so when they become underlaid by rocks newer than
Silurian; and thus the points at which the respective leads will die out and
become unprofitable, will probably be determined by the position in the
several districts of such lines of junction. As regards the leads of
Ballarat, and other southern and western goldfields, the points will probably
be found to be roughly along a line where the old slate or ? bed rock?
bottom is not more than between 600 or 700 feet above the present sea
level, which in this district will mark approximately the boundary of the
marine miocene tertiary beds at the epoch of the deposition of the older
pliocene drifts.
Respecting the goldfields on the northern slope of the coast range, Sand-
hurst, Rusbworth, Dunolly, Avoca, &c., there are no data at present from
which to determine the points at which the older gold leads of those dis-


tricts are likely to die out or become unprofitable in their course towards
the Murray. Up to the present time, however, I believe they have in no
instance been followed or found at lower levels than above named, and it
seems probable that similar causes will affect them on both sides of the
coast range.
The absence, before alluded to, of marine, and the prevalence of terres-
trial remains, occurring as they do in the lowest beds of the series, or
where they rest on the bed rock that was once the old land surface, seems
rather to indicate that such land surface, on which plants and animals lived
and died, and considerable masses of loose material had accumulated, existed
prior to the submergence, than that the deposits that now cover those
relics are solely the result of fluviatile or other sub-aerial influences. And
the absence of any evidence of marine life may probably be fully accounted
for by the character of the deposits, which indicate physical conditions
that must have been highly unfavourable to the development of animal
life in the area ; while the wide spread of the formation over hill, plain,
and valley, its uniform character, and the peculiar rounded and water-
worn nature of much of the material composing it, are features that
appear to require for their production some cause, having a much more
extended, uniform, and powerful action than can well be ascribed to river
floods. That very considerable areas, now forming dry land in Victoria,
have been submerged in late tertiary times is unquestionable; and I believe
that most, if not all, the older gold gravels, if not absolutely due to such
cause, have at least been subjected to its influence, and in that sense must
be regarded as marine deposits.
The greatest thickness of these older gold deposits with their associated
beds of lava or ? bluestone? does not exceed 400 feet, but they vary very
greatly in this respect within short distances, and especially where the old
surface was most uneven, as shown in Fig. 2, where a a a represents the
tertiaries and hhh the older beds on which they rest.
Fig. 2.
Referring to the extent and position of what appear to be lower members
of the middle or older tertiary, it has been stated ( ante page 20), that such
deposits, waterworn gravels, &c., have been met with in several localities,
from sea-level to an elevation of 4000 feet. Now, supposing the determina-
tion of the probable age of these deposits to be correct, and also that they,
like the upper gold gravels, are not due to merely fluviatile action, it follows
that portions of the surface of Victoria have been raised at least 4000 feet
since the commencement of miocene tertiary times. Whether the same
area has ever again been completely submerged is a question in tertiary
physical geology that will yet require much careful investigation before
any definite conclusions can be arrived at. At present lam inclined to
believe that no such entire submergence has taken place, and though the
tertiary fossil fauna and flora indicate, as in Europe, a gradually-cooling
climate, no evidence has been found in Victoria of the intense cold of the


glacial period of the northern hemisphere, or that the climate has in earlier
times been colder than it is now.
No tertiary deposits containing marine fossils have been found at a greater
elevation than about 600 feet above the sea. The oldest beds, probably
upper eocene (oligocene), occur on the east shore of Port Phillip Bay, resting on
granite and mesozoic carbonaceous rocks. Very fine collections of fossils,
now in the National Museum, have been procured from them. The beds are
chiefly composed of blue clays and marls with septarian nodules and selenite,
and generally closely resemble the eocene strata of the Hampshire and
London basins. From the western boundary of the colony to the east
shore of Port Phillip Bay the marine tertiaries, chiefly miocene, are well
exposed in the coast cliffs and river banks, and sometimes are found, as at
the Muddy Creek, near Hamilton, upwards of 40 miles inland. Between
Wilson?s Promontory and Cape Howe, the eastern boundary of the colony,
they occupy a long strip of coast country, nowhere, however, exceeding
sixteen miles in width, and form cliffs on the northern shores of the Gipps-
land lakes, and on some of the rivers flowing into them. None of the
lower beds have been recognised east of Wilson?s Promontory, and I
believe I am correct in stating that no tertiary beds whatever containing
marine fossils have been recognised in any part of New South Wales east
of Cape Howe.
IGNEOUS ROCKS.
PLUTONIC, VOLCANIC, AND METAMOEPHIC.
1. Plutonic Rocks ( Hypogene), Granite. ?Rocks of this class occur
in great variety, and the manner of their distribution would seem
to indicate the probability of their existence at no great depth beneath
the entire surface of Victoria.
They are, I believe, without exception, of later date than the close of the
lower Silurian period; but there is no evidence of any being younger than
those formations classed as upper Palaeozoic or lower Mesozoic.
Their exposure at the surface is entirely due to denudations that have
removed the once superincumbent strata; and in most cases no other con-
clusion can be formed than that they are not irrupted ? masses,? but only
completely altered sedimentary deposits, or what Sir William Logan classes
as ? indigenous,? as distinguished from ? exotic? or intruded rocks. The
slaty beds are invariably more or less altered in character for variable
distances from the granite, and occasionally what appears to be a gradual
change from slate into mica schist, gneiss, and granite is observable.
Syenite and syenitic or hornblendic granite are also occasionally met with;
also, pegmatite, or a variety, very coarsely constituted, of orthoclase, quartz,
and silvery-white mica.
In the steep hilly country east of the Snowy River the relation of the
granite to the older rocks is well exhibited. The beds of the creeks and
bottoms of the valleys are all granite, and the tops of the ranges vertical
Silurian slates and sandstones, so that on an accurately constructed geological
map of the district the boundaries between granite and slate would form
contour lines, much the same as in deeply eroded oolitic or other nearly


horizontal strata. Occasionally, the Silurian rocks dip at high angles off
the granite; but, so far as I have observed, this relation is purely accidental,
and occurs only when the line of junction happens to coincide with the
normal more or less meridional strike of the stratified rocks. Quite as
often, the dip is either directly on to or against the granite, or the beds are
vertical and end abruptly along a granite boundary that runs at right
angles to the strike of the Silurian strata. And it appears as if the origin
of the granite had no influence in determining the direction or the amount of
the disturbances that have affected the older rocks; which I conceive could
hardly be the case had it been intruded or irrupted, whether in a fluid,
viscous, or solid state, in such large masses as exist in all parts of Victoria.
It does not occur along any defined axis or line, nor has it apparently
any physical connection with the main geographical axis of the country,
but forms more or less isolated groups of hills, such as Station Peak, Mount
Eliza, Arthur?s Seat, Wilson?s Promontory, &c., on the south, and Mount
Alexander, Mount Tarrangower, the Terrieks, Mount Korong, Mount Cole,
Mount Beckworth, and others on the north.
The physical aspect of the granite areas varies considerably in different
districts, apparently mainly dependent on geographical position. At the
higher elevations, and also generally on the south side of the coast range,
the rock is often covered with a deep soil supporting a dense and varied
vegetation, as at Sealer s Cove, about the sources of the Latrobe and the
Bunyip Rivers, Mount Disappointment, &c.; whereas in all the localities
to the north previously named, as well as many others, it forms rather
poor, hilly or gently undulating country, thinly timbered with gum (euca-
lypti), she-oak (casuarina), wattle (acacia), cherry (exocarpus), and honey-
suckle (banksia), the she-cak and banksia being very characteristic of these
districts, as they are of light sandy soils generally.
The most common mineral character observed is a ternary compound
of quartz, white or pinkish (orthoclase), felspar, and black or white mica
in variable proportions, forming either a coarse and friable or a hard and
fine-grained rock. In some districts, black tourmaline, often in large
crystals, is also a common constituent mineral, but does not replace the mica.
The very frequent friable condition of the surface of the rock causes it to
weather on the flanks and summits of the hills into picturesque piles of
stones, like huge boulders, or into the gigantic isolated rounded pillar-
shaped masses known as Tors in Devon and Cornwall, and generally
characteristic of granite country. On the Coliban River and in other
places, the granite is traversed by two systems of parallel joints nearly
vertical, giving it the appearance of a thick-bedded stratified formation;
and the idea has sometimes suggested itself, whether these divisional planes
may not possibly represent original planes of stratification, their frequent
coincidence in strike and dip, with the adjacent unaltered Silurian rocks,
lending strength to this idea. In almost every district it affords good
durable building stone, but, being more costly to work than ? bluestone?
or basalt, it is not generally used, except for special purposes or where
neither ? bluestone? nor good freestone is available.
Quartz in veins is occasionally found traversing the granite, and some
of these veins have proved to be auriferous. Dykes, from a few inches
to many yards in width, of a very fine-grained granite or elvanite (chiefly
felspar and quartz), are also very common, but no metalliferous deposits have
been found associated with them.


FELSPAR, QUARTZ, AND CLAYSTONE PORPHYRY, FBLSTONE, DIORITE,
DIABASE, ETC.
Rocks referable to one or other of the above species occur through-
out the silurian area, and also associated with the Grampian sandstone
series, either as dykes filling narrow fissures or as intruded masses.
They are probably more recent than most of the granite rocks,
though occasionally a gradual passage is observed from one to the other.
The largest area in Victoria occupied by rocks of this class is that west of,
and parallel to, the course of the Snowy River, Another somewhat-similar
mass, though of much smaller extent, occurs in the valley of the Wannon,
near Hamilton. The Dandenong Ranges, Mount Juliet, Mount Arnold,
&c., on the Wood?s Point road, and Mount Macedon and Dryden?s Rock,
are chiefly composed of varieties of felspar and quartz-porphyries.
The stratified rocks with which they are associated are generally a good
deal hardened, and otherwise altered in character, near the points of
contact, commonly assuming a jaspery or flinty appearance, but never, so far
as I am aware, the micaceous or gneissose character which they do when in
contact with all the larger granite masses. Sometimes no alteration what-
ever appears to have taken place, and we find soft earthy slates containing
well-preserved graptolites in immediate contact with the intrusive rock.
Such a case occurs near Guildford, and is described on the quarter-sheet
map of the survey 15 N.E.
Near Bacchus Marsh, on the Werribee River, at Heathcote, and on the
Back Creek (quarter-sheet 51 S.W.), interesting dykes occur. In the last-
named the rock consists of a whitish rather-earthy felspathic base, thickly
studded with double hexagonal quartz crystals, about the size of small peas,
and orthoclase felspar.
Hornblendic rocks, greenstone, diorite, diabase, &c.,t though not
exclusively confined to, may at any rate certainly be regarded as charac-
teristic, in Victoria, of strata younger than lower silurian. The most
interesting dykes of this nature occur traversing rocks probably equivalents
of the lower portion of the upper silurian, in the Wood?s Point district,
and also in the valleys of the Thomson and Latrobe, in Gippsland. At
Wood?s Point, Raspberry Creek, &c., they are often quite decomposed into
a soft reddish-earthy rock, and this is intersected by bands and layers of
quartz richly auriferous, as at the celebrated Morning Star Hill, Wood?s
Point, and other ? claims? on Gaffney?s Creek, Raspberry Creek, &c. On
the Thomson, native copper and copper ores are found, accompanying
similar diorite dykes. The auriferous quartz veins seem generally con-
fined to the decomposed portions of the dykes ; and this decomposition
appears to be very local and irregular even in the same dyke, which in
some parts is completely decomposed from the surface to 100 or 150
feet down, while in others it shows no sign of decomposition, and is
as solid and crystalline on the surface as below. Plate IV. is a drawing
to scale of a measured section taken in a tunnel on one of these dykes,
and affords a good idea of the peculiar mode in which they are traversed
by the auriferous quartz layers, generally at right angles to the wall of
the dyke.
+ Locally termed ?rotten granite.?


2.?Volcanic Rocks.
BASALT, DOLERITE, AMYGDOLOID, WACKB, ASH, LAVA, ETC.
These rocks are widely distributed in Victoria, and are estimated to
occupy about 6321 square miles of the surface ; none of them are known
to be older than tertiary. They are the result of at least two distinct
periods of eruption. The first, geographically, apparently much the most
extended, marked the close of the miocene epoch, while the second, com-
mencing towards the end of the pliocene epoch, seems to have been
continued into the most recent post-pliocene time.
The district occupied by the newer or pliocene volcanic formation con-
sists chiefly of open or thinly-timbered and well-grassed country, either
quite level, very slightly undulating, or gently rising towards the coast
range or to the more or less isolated hills that are distributed throughout
the volcanic area.
The plains are traversed by deep-cutting, winding, creek and river chan-
nels, with rocky basalt escarpments. These channels occasionally widen
out into very fertile valleys, with alluvial flats, timbered with large red
gum-trees (eucalyptus). The rocks, over which the basaltic lava streams
have flowed, are often cut into, and well exposed in the bottoms and sides
of the valleys, showing that the basalt rests indiscriminately on all the
older formations?granitic, trappean, volcanic, and sedimentary. When
resting on older volcanic rocks, without the intervention of any sedimentary
deposits, the fact is not easily detected except by the generally greater depth
and richness of the soil?a very constant and characteristic feature of the
?older? volcanic rocks; and where the surface is occupied by these, the phy-
sical character of the country generally is very different from that above
described. Instead of the more or less open and level plains traversed by
drainage channels, with abrupt escarpments, it presents an undulating
surface of rounded hills and gently-sloping valleys, evidently due to the
action of long-continued denuding forces, to which the later lava streams
have not been subjected. The rock is commonly covered with a deep
black or chocolate soil, which often supports the rankest vegetation, as on
the road from Melbourne to Gippsland and in parts of Western Port. In
other localities it is lightly timbered, and forms, probably, some of the
finest and most fertile agricultural land in the colony, as at Portarlington,
the Pentland Hills, the Kangaroo Ground, Berwick, Cranbourne, Mount
Ararat on the Gippsland road, Cape Schank, and the shores of Western
Port Bay.
The mineral and lithological characters of the volcanic products of the
two periods present marked similarities and differences. An irregular con-
centric concretionary, or polygonal jointed, structure, is eminently character-
istic of the older, so much so that, though it affords any quantity of
excellent road-making or railway-ballasting material, no building-stone is
ever procured from it. The columnar structure is also not uncommon in
both the older and newer formation. Interbedded with the harder layers
are strata of a very soft, unctuous, amygdoloidal clay or ? wacke,? bluish,
grey, brown, yellow, brick-red, or pure white. Sometimes the section
exposed consists almost wholly of such clay, traversed by ferruginous veins,


and enclosing hard lumps or balls of dense-black basalt. A careful examina-
tion shows that these are only the central nuclei of large concretionary
masses that have decomposed in concentric coats, and have thus formed the
clay matrix in which they are enclosed. Examples of this peculiar structure
are well exhibited in the cuttings through the old Flagstaff-hill, also near
the Survey office and the old Exhibition Building, both of which stand on
this formation covered with a thin capping of gravel, probably miocene.
The Pentland Hills near Bacchus Marsh, Cape Schank, the shores of
Western Port Bay, and the south coast of Phillip Island, offer, however,
the best sections for studying the formation in all its aspects and varieties
of structure. The solid layers are mostly a dense, dark crystalline basalt,
composed chiefly of augite, labradorite, olivine, and specular iron; and,
though some beds present a honeycombed or cellular structure, they are, as
a rule, far more solid and dense than the recent pliocene lavas.*
These latter present a much greater variety in texture than is observed
in the products of the earlier eruptions. The most common and charac-
teristic is the well-known ? bluestone,? so extensively used for building
purposes in Melbourne and throughout the volcanic area. It is a true
dolerite lava, a variable mixture of augite, labradorite, iron, and carbonate
of lime, and presents an infinite variety of texture, often very porous and
vesicular, or honey-combed, or coarsely crystalline and granular, or close
grained, and not unlike a hard calcareous or metamorphic sandstone.
Olivine, specular iron, hyalite, and other minerals are associated with it,
though not as component portions of the stone. Various shades of blue-
grey to almost black are the prevailing colours. It dresses easily, and can
be procured in blocks of the largest dimensions ever required for architec-
tural or engineering purposes.
In some districts it is associated with beds of regularly-stratified ashes.
These are more easily quarried than the bluestone, and when first taken
out the stone is so soft as to be readily sawn into blocks of the dimensions
required. It hardens considerably after exposure, and for local use forms
a very cheap, useful, and tolerably-durable building material. It is a good
deal used in the neighbourhood of Warrnambool, Terang, &c. The Church
of England at Warrnambool is partly constructed of this stone, and is
probably the largest structure in which it has been used.
Scoriae and honeycombed lavas, so cellular and light as to float in water,
are frequently found on the flanks and summits of most of the cones and
crater hills in the volcanic districts. No true trachyte or pumice has been
found. Obsidian is occasionally met with, but not in large quantity.
Basalt is also frequently found in the carbonaceous mesozoic, upper
palaeozoic, and older rocks, occurring in injected bosses and in dykes,
varying in thickness from a few inches to many yards ; sometimes in the
older rocks these dykes are accompanied by quartz-veins occupying the
same fissure as the basalt, which apparently never exercises a metamorphic
influence on the adjacent strata. Faults or dislocations of strata
frequently accompany the dykes, but whether the injection of the lava was
subsequent to the occurrence of the faults, or caused them, has not been
hitherto satisfactorily determined.
* Many interesting minerals have been found associated with the volcanic rocks ;
but as they are fully described in that portion of the paper especially devoted to
this subject, and written by my colleague, Mr. Ulrich, any further notice of them
here is superfluous.


Good examples of these dykes occur on the Cape Paterson coast and
also near Bacchus Marsh. It is not easy to determine their age, but, from
their general character and mode of occurrence, I should imagine them to
belong to the older volcanic period.
The products of both volcanic periods are often contemporaneous and
interstratified with the marine limestones, or with fluviatile and lacustrine
sedimentary deposits, that were forming at the time of their eruption.
The earlier eruptions seem generally to have taken place through long
rents or fissures, of lesser or greater width, and the overflows, once
connected with them probably over large areas, have been more or less
removed by denudation, leaving only the cores or stalks. The newer lavas,
on the other hand, have been erupted and flowed in wide-spreading sheets
from points?with which the sheets are often still connected?now
forming conical or mammaloid hills. In many of these very perfect central
crater-basins still exist. Some are occupied by deep fresh-water lakes or
shallow swampy lagoons, while others are quite dry, well-grassed and
thickly timbered. Mount Gambier, in South Australia, Tower Hill, near
Warrnambooi (the only instance of an insular crater), and Mount Eels are
examples of the former; and Mount Noorat, Mount Rouse, Mount Napier,
Mount Elephant, and Mount Franklin, of the latter class. Many other
mammaloid hills exist which have also probably been formed as points of
eruption, but on which little or no trace now exists of a crater, their
outlines having apparently been considerably modified by subsequent
denudation. In some instances, it seems probable that the same hills have
served as vents for the eruptions of both miocene and pliocene periods.
The light scoriaceous and cellular lava and ashes usually found near all
these eruptive points, and in some of them (of which Mount Gambier and
Tower Hill are good instances), the walls of the crater being formed of strati-
fied layers of ash dipping outwards at a low angle, seem to indicate the
probability that most of them were subaerial volcanic vents, forming low
islands in the tertiary seas, under the waters of which the lava streams
flowed and were consolidated.* Numbers of lakes, lagoons, and shallow
basin-shaped depressions, with rocky basalt margins, occur over the large
volcanic area west of Melbourne. Some of these (such as' Purrumbete,
150 feet deep, and only about 1| mile in diameter?Gnotuk, 300 feet deep,
and still smaller ?Terang and Keilambete; the banks of all of which are
composed chiefly of beds of volcanic ashes) may perhaps also have been
the sites of old craters, but the evidence of their having been so is by no
means so clear as it is respecting the hills. lam rather inclined to think
that many of them are accidental depressions due to other causes, more
especially as lakes and lagoons of somewhat similar character are also
abundant in the extensive level pliocene tertiary area to the north-west,
where the surface shows no indications of volcanic agency. Large quan-
tities of salt (chiefly chloride of sodium) is held in solution in the waters
of some of the lakes, whilst in others in close proximity the water is
perfectly fresh.
So far as I am aware, no lake having a permanent outlet by which its
flood waters can escape to the sea is salt; on the other hand, some that have
no such outlet are, notwithstanding, quite fresh. Many of them are very
shallow, and towards the close of a dry season the water has entirely
Vide appended list of volcanic hills and points of eruption.


evaporated, leaving a deposit, a few inches thick, of crystallised salt resting
on black mud. There are no flowing saltsprings in the districts, though most
of the pliocene tertiary well-water is more or less charged with salt, but not
generally so in the volcanic areas; and it appears not improbable that the sites
of most of these lakes are depressions in the surface, from which the sea-
water could only escape by evaporation, after the last upheaval of
the land. Thus the original amount of saline matter is retained in them
and deposited by evaporation during the summer months, only to be
re-dissolved by the winter rains. On the other hand, where a permanent
outlet exists, accession and escape of fresh-water dissolves and carries off a
portion of saline matter, until the whole has been removed. The fresh-
water basins having no outlet may perhaps either be due to other and
subsequent causes, or may even in earlier times have had outlets since
closed, or possibly their waters may still be slowly drained through sub-
terranean channels.
Mr. Cosmo Newbery, analyst to the survey, has recently examined the
waters of several of the salt lakes, and states: ??The brines, without exception,
were found to contain, besides chloride of sodium, chloride of magnesium
and potassium, and sulphate of soda and lime; chloride of aluminium was
also found in one. They also contained a great quantity of organic
matter.? Chloride of sodium, however, constitutes from 90 to 98 per
cent, of the total solid contents, which in one instance amounted to one
pound seven ounces per gallon, due probably to extreme concentration
through a succession of dry seasons.*
* Since writing the above, Mr. A. J. Skene, District Surveyor, informs me that
he knows several lakes, the waters of which are quite fresh, that have outlets
into swampy lagoons, and that the latter have no outlets and the waters are quite
salt.

Extensive basaltic caves are not uncommon in the western district. One
near Anderson?s Hill, on the east bank of the Mount Emu Creek, south of
Skipton, is especially deserving notice. It contains three large and lofty
chambers, connected with each other by narrow passages. The first and
largest chamber is 48 by 40 yards; the next (connected by a short narrow
passage), 44 by 27 yards; and the farthest from the entrance (connected
with the larger one by a passage 13 yards long) is about 27 by 15 or 20
yards. Thousands of bats inhabit these caves, hanging in clusters from
the roof like a swarm of bees, and on the floor are large conical mounds of
a rich brown earthy matter, containing imbedded pieces of crystallised
gypsum. The deposit itself consists entirely of the excrement of the
animals. The average height of the chambers is from 15 to 20 feet. No
explorations have yet been made in this cave.
Another near Gisborne was explored in 1856, and large quantities of
bones found in it, for particulars of which vide quarter-sheet map of the

clay and sand, 10-427; soluble silica, 0 - 720; water, PBO9 ; organic
matter and loss, 0-054 = 100-00.
6. Freshwater limestone, Coliban River, four miles from Kyneton, colour
dirty white, dense, fracture uneven?Carbonate of lime, 89'33 ; carbonate
of magnesia, 7-45 ; carbonate of iron, trace ; silica and clay, 3-22 = 100-00.
(This limestone, when burnt, yields good building lime).
7. Limestone from the Duck Ponds (tertiary)? Carbonate of lime,
88-38 ; carbonate of magnesia, 0 - 76 ; carbonate of iron, 0-51 ; silica and
clay, 7"02 = 96-67.

iron, 2-29 ; silica and clay, 7*61 =? 97?85.
11. Marble from a cave in the parish of Yering, on the Upper Yarra

Nos. 3, 4, 9, and 12, if occurring in quantity, may be of value in the
manufacture of hydraulic cements, as they contain a high percentage of
clay and silica. No. 5, the septarian limestone from Schnapper Point,
analysed by the late Mr. C. S. Wood, is a sample of the stone used by the
fate Schnapper Point Cement Company. The percentage of siliceous matter
is too low for a good hydraulic lime. Its power of hardening under water


would be considerably increased by the addition of clayey matters in such
proportion as to raise the quantity of silica to about 25 per cent.
Nos. 1, 2, 6, 7, 8, 10, and 11 are limestones, which yield good building
limes, and may be made into cement when mixed with the proper
proportion of clayey matter. That which is best adapted for this purpose
is the decomposed basalt from the older volcanic rocks.
IRON ORES.
1. Ironstone from Moonee Ponds (tertiary), contains 50.68 percent, iron.
2. Ironstone from near Mordialloc (tertiary), contains 24 - 26 per cent, iron.
3. Ironstone from Western Port (tertiary), contains 38 - 598 per cent. iron.
4. Black ironstone gravel from Newbridge, Loddon River, contains 44'34
per cent. iron.
5. R 4 Brown iron ore from Pascoevale-road, west bank of Saltwater
River, contains 46'00 per cent. iron.
6. Brown iron ore from Greenstone Range, east of Lancefield, contains
52-70 per cent. iron.
7. Iron ore from Stony Creek Reservoir, near Steiglitz, similar to
Moonee Ponds.
None of the above ores occur in sufficient bodies to be profitably
worked. Similar ores occur in all parts of the colony, associated with the
newer tertiary formations.

MINERAL SPECIES OF VICTORIA
In the subsequent pages I have attempted to give a list of the various
minerals which have up to the present time been observed in Victoria, and
to state what is known about their modes of occurrence, special characters
and associations, together with the results of experiments and analyses
made in the laboratory of the Geological Survey. As the time for the
preparation of this list has been very limited, doubtless many defects in
the descriptions will be observed, and perhaps also some omissions of
mineral species that have been found in the colony and specimens of which
may be in the hands of private persons, whose collections I have not
been able to examine.
Considering a strictly scientific arrangement in many respects unsuitable
for the objects of these notes, I have classified the species in the following
manner ; 6
Native Metals and Metallic Minerals.
Silicates and precious stones that do not contain Silica.
Carbonates, Sulphates, Phosphates, and Chlorides.
Carbonaceous Minerals.
Adding a short notice of the mineral springs known in Victoria.
A great number of the minerals described, have been found and
determined during the progress of the Geological Survey, and will, together
with nearly all the others, be represented by specimens in the Victorian
collection exhibited at the Intercolonial Exhibition by Mr. R. Brough
Smyth, Secretary for Mines, to whom, as well as to Mr. A. R. C. Selwyn
Director of the Geological Survey, and Mr. C. D?Oyly H. Aplin, formerly
a member of the Survey, I am indebted for much interesting information
regarding many of the minerals.
Formidable as this list of species may look at first glance, the collection
is, comparatively speaking, in a strictly mineralogical point of view, only a
poor one ; especially on account of the rarity or entire absence of finely-
crystallized specimens, of a great number, of the species. This must
appear the more remarkable if we consider the immense number of quartz-
lodes, and the masses and dykes of various plutonic and volcanic rocks
that traverse the country, and have already been extensively explored
Many fine crystals may no doubt be overlooked during the progress of the
quick and energetic working of our miners; still, fine druses�of ores or
other minerals, such as frequently occur in the lodes of other mining
countries, would certainly not have escaped their observation.


As regards the general scarcity of ore-lodes, or of lodes with lode-stones
other than quartz ?calcspar, spathic iron, fluorspar, &c., the principa
bearers of lead, silver, and copper ores?it seems probable that this is in
some measure due to, or at least stands in connection with, the absence in
our Lower Silurian, and the great scarcity in the Upper Silurian; rocks of
those broad bands and masses of limestone which characterise the rock-
formations of the principal known mining countries.
NATIVE METALS AND METALLIC MINERALS.
Gold. ?Occurs mainly in the quartz reefs of the Upper and Lower
Silurian rocks, and in the Upper Tertiary cement and drift deposits, which
owe their origin to abrasion and denudation of the former. Golcl '
Some instances have also been observed of gold being embedded
in sandstone (Prior?s Reef, Wattle Flat, Castlemaine); in slate (Capper s
Reef, Barker?s Creek, Castlemaine); in granite (Nuggetty Reef, Tarran-
gower); in diorite (several of the reefs of Woodspoint and Raspberry
Creek); in limestone (in a calcareous cement at Sandy Creek and Mia
Mia, Tarrangower). Very frequently it is found enclosed in iron and
arsenical pyrites, and in the common, and manganiferous, brown iron-ore .
minerals which are rarely absent in any auriferous quartz reef. Mit
regard to its mode of occurrence in the reefs, it is found by practical
experience that the gold, at and near the surface, is coarser and genera y
more loosely embedded (sometimes in cracks or hollows and in the clayey
and ferruginons casings) than in depth, and although exceptions are kno\vn,
it is by most quartz miners acknowledged, so to speak, as a rule, that the
gold becomes finer and finer, and more intimately mixed with the quartz
and pyrites, the deeper the reefs are worked, and may, in fact, ultimately
be hardly discernible as free gold by the naked eye, but exists, micro-
scopically impregnated, or perhaps mineralized, in the pyrites. Judging
from the character of the alluvial gold, the above rule receives apparently
strong indirect confirmation in the fact that, whilst pieces of above one ounce
in weight are generally of rare occurrence in quartz reefs, they are not so
in the drifts (composed of the denuded portions of the reefs), which have,
besides, yielded the largest masses ever found throughout the world.
The heaviest nugget ? i.e ., connected mass of gold known to have been
found in a quartz reef weighed nearly 13 lbs., and came from a depth of
40 feet from the surface (Old Quartz Hill, Castlemaine). With regard to
the chemical purity or fineness of the Victorian gold, it may doubtless be
taken as nearly, if not the best, of any of the known gold countries, inas-
much as its average fineness ranges between 20-23*5 carats, the Ballarat
gold being of the highest standard. Only from one district, Lake Omeo,
the standard is reported as below 16 carats, the admixture being copper,
with a trace of silver; whilst from the other goldfields the reverse is the
case, silver being the chief admixture. It may also be mentioned that
alloys of gold with bismuth have been reported on good authority from
* See models of nuggets, and statistics of the Victorian gold pyramid.


Kingower and Maldon as a rare occurrence; it being, however, not ascer-
tained at the time, whether this mixture of the two metals was natural,
or whether it happened artificially in course of the process of amalgama-
tion, and was due perhaps to native bismuth?a metal occurring in those
districts?having been originally impregnated in the quartz. A rather
strange peculiarity with regard to the respective standards of fineness of
alluvial and reef gold consists in the fact that the former is generally of
better quality than the latter, though its derivation can frequently?as
for instance, in all ?alluvial? gullies, ? surface? patches, &c., be distinctly
traced from quartz reefs in the immediate neighbourhood.
The forms in which the gold occurs in the drifts are flattened smooth
scales, roundish grains, and irregularly-shaped roundish masses??nuggets?
?the latter frequently coated with manganiferous brown iron-ore, which
has in many instances caused them to be overlooked when first exhumed.
In some leads ?for instance, at Guildford, Daisy Hill, &c.?portions of the
gold are commonly coated with black manganese, or brown iron-ore (?black
gold?), and great care is required on the part of the miner to avoid loss in
washing. In the neighbourhood of quartz reefs the grains and scales of gold
are more angular and often crystalline, characters forming important guides
to the experienced quartz miner in prospecting for the reefs themselves.
As regards the quartz, or reef gold, it appears mostly in hackly grains, thin
plates with ragged edges, often above one inch square, in filiform
shapes and irregularly crystalline masses, but very rarely arborescent and
reticulated. Perfect crystals of gold occur on nearly all the goldfields;
more abundantly, however, on MTvor, Castlemaine, Ballarat, Bendigo, Ac.
They are generally found near the surface, in the clayey, or ferruginous
ochery casings of the reefs, very rarely in hollows of the quartz itself, and
they occur also in the top stratum of the ground (? surface?), in close
proximity to the reefs. At the old Quartz Hill Reef, Castlemaine, the ferru-
ginous casing proved in some places near the surface so rich in gold crystals
that several ounces of them?from a pin?s-head to a pea in size?were saved
by the proprietors of the claim. The forms of the crystals are principally
the cube, modified by small planes of the octahedron and rhombic
dodecahedron, and these crystals appear often tabularly compressed;
the rhombic dodecahedron, as ground figure with replacements by the
cube ; and more rarely the plain octahedron, and the octahedron with
small faces of the cube. Amongst the crystals from the old
Quartz Hill Reef, some were highly modified, exhibiting as ground
figure the octahedron with small planes of the cube, rhombic dodecahedron,
trapezohedron, tetrahexahedron, and hexoctahedron (See Figs. l a , l b ).* Simi-
larly modified crystals with the cube as ground figure are reported
as having been found at MTvor and Maldon. Compound crystals appear
to be very rare. From several experiments made by the late
Dr. L. Becker, by cutting gold crystals in halves, and also by
the established low specific gravity and the loss which crystals
suffer by smelting, it appears to be very probable that gold crystals
generally have a nucleus of quartz, iron pyrites, or of brown iron-
ore (decomposed iron pyrites), or require one for their formation. From
the Nuggetty Reef, Castlemaine, several fine specimens are known of pen-
tagonal dodecahedrons of iron pyrites enclosed in a skeleton of gold in
* For Figs, of Mineral Species, vide Plate V,


the form of the rhombic dodecahedron. At Ballarat many octahedral
crystals have been found with sharp salient edges and a triangular cavity in
place of each plane, in the centre of which a grain of ferruginous quartz, or
brown iron-ore, was clearly observable. With regard to pseudo morph
crystals of gold, or of other minerals after gold, no trustworthy observa-
tions have been recorded as yet. The statement, that at the New Bendigo
goldfield a gold crystal had been found, exhibiting the prism and double
hexagonal pyramid ?apparently a pseudomorph of gold after rock crystal?
has never been satisfactorily corroborated. It has been generally doubted
that gold occurs inside quartz crystals; however, in addition to those
recorded years ago from the MTvor goldfield ?one specimen especially (at
that time in the possession of the late Dr, L. Becker), a splinter of gold
with octahedral faces on both ends, enclosed in a small rock crystal?
several undoubtedly genuine finds have lately been made in the Woods-
point district. A very fine specimen has also been obtained at Redbank :
This is a fine rock crystal, two inches long and above one inch in diameter,
which shows several small particles of gold enclosed, one, the largest, being
delicately filiform, the others of a more solid, hackly character.
Besides the gold specks this crystal shows another curious feature?it
encloses a second rock crystal, which is of a somewhat yellowish hue, hardly
� of an inch long, and lies in a slanting position.
Having in the foregoing given a short statement of the modes of occur-
rence, character, &c., of both reef and alluvial gold, it may, perhaps, not be
out of place to add a few remarks bearing upon the origin of those inte-
resting phenomena, the large nuggets. If we consider that these consist of
the nearly specifically heaviest known matter concentrated into spaces,
offering, comparatively speaking, the smallest surface of attack, it must
appear evident that a tremendous, so to speak, cataclysmic force would be
required to move such lumps, and yet most have been found far removed
from auriferous quartz reefs, which the lay or run of the respective gold
leads in which they occur points out as the source of the gold ; and some
in positions?for instance, in the sand overlying the gravel?which, con-
sidering their weight and the otherwise regular arrangement of the drift
deposit from the surface downward, viz., clay, sand, and fine and coarse
gravel, are quite inexplicable. If we add to this, that nuggets even above
one ounce in weight are of rare occurrence in quartz reefs, a doubt must
naturally arise, whether such ponderous masses, as we now find, have
been actually derived from the reefs; and it becomes of interest to
inquire whether, perhaps, other sources do not "exist, to which they may
owe their origin. Considering the rule of the gradually-decreasing size of
the particles of gold in reefs, from the surface downward, it might no doubt
with just reason be urged that, as the reefs have been extensively denuded
(of which the formation of the drifts furnishes convincing proof), the same
rule would inversely hold good for the denuded portions ? i.e., the particles
of gold were gradually increasing in size towards the original surface of
the reefs; and as instances are known of nuggets several pounds in
Weight having been found in our present reefs, the denuded portions might
have contained them both of larger size and more numerously. However,
sound as this argument may be in certain respects, the general difference in
standard of fineness between alluvial and reef gold bears strongly against
it, and certain facts and results of experiments besides, lend aid to an hypo-
thesis, some time ago advanced by Mr. Selwyn?namely, ? that nuggets


may have been formed, and generally that particles of alluvial gold may
gradually increase in size through the deposition of metallic gold (analogous
to the electro-plating process), from the meteoric waters which circulate
through the drifts, and which must have been, during the time of our
extensive basaltic eruptions, of a thermal, and probably highly saline,
character, favourable to their carrying gold in solution.?
The collateral questions to answer here are ?firstly, is gold contained in
the meteoric drift water ? and, secondly, do agencies exist by which it can
be deposited from that solution in a metallic state ? i.e ., as a solid
coating on nuclei presented to it 1 Both questions are nearly satisfactorily
solved, the first by the auriferous character of iron pyrites, occurring fre-
quently in the leads of Ballarat, Clunes, Daylesford, &c., which shows the
shapes of roots and branches of trees, forms part of and occupies cavities
in driftwood, &c., and is therefore of very recent origin ;* the second, by an
accidental discovery made by Mr. Daintree some time ago, and also by
some recent interesting experiments by Mr. Charles Wilkinson, of
the Geological Survey. Mr. Daintree?s discovery consisted in the
fact that a speck of gold, lying in a solution of chloride of gold,
increased to several times its original size after a small piece of
cork had by accident fallen into the solution. This signifies, therefore,
that organic matter, which is abundantly contained in the drifts, may be
the agent by which gold is deposited from meteoric waters in the manner
required for the solution of the problem. Mr. Wilkinson?s experiments
prove further, that besides gold itself, iron, copper, and arsenical pyrites,
galena, zincblende, molybdenite, wolfram, &c., form likewise favourable
nuclei, which, if immersed in a weak solution of chloride of gold, receive a
solid coating of this metal by agency of organic matter (a small chip of
wood or bark, for instance, swimming in the solution). In addition to
these data, we have the curious coincidence with Mr. Selwyn?s views,
touching the character of the meteoric water in earlier times, that on our
western goldfields only (Ballarat, Daisy Hill, &c.), where evidence of
tremendous basaltic eruptions meets the eye _on every side, all the large
nuggets have hitherto been found j whilst in the eastern and northern
goldfields (Gippsland, Yarra, Ovens, &c.), on which basaltic streams are
either absent, or of very limited extent, the gold is generally very fine
and nuggets above an ounce in weight are of the greatest rarity.
Far as these data tend towards strengthening Mr. Selwyn?s hypothesis,
there are, however, many doubtful points yet to be cleared up. It is, for
instance, of the greatest interest to confirm by careful quantitative analysis of
large quantities of drift water, that gold exists in it; to determine in what
amount; and, though scarcely practicable, yet of high importance, to find
out in what combination. It is certainly most probable that, as our
drift waters generally are saline, gold is in solution as a chloride, but
should this not be found to be the case, it is necessary to examine whether
the new salt (which might, judging from Professor Bischoff s experiments,
perhaps be a silicate of gold) is also decomposable in the required way by
organic matter, or other agencies, existing in the drifts. The most
conclusive test for the confirmation of the hypothesis would no doubt be
to ascertain, by cutting nuggets in halves, and careful appropriate analysis
afterwards, that they contain nuclei of lower standard gold?the portions

Gold and Silver Alloy.? Occurs sparingly as small specks in the silver
reef, St. Arnaud, associated with native gold and silver and chloroblomide
of silver. As its colour varies between yellowish-white and pale yellow,
the two metals are no doubt combined in very variable proportions *
Native Silver. ?Occurs, though very rarely, in the silver reef and the silver!
Wilson?s Reef, St. Arnaud. In the former it appears as small hackly specks,
embedded in hard quartz ; in the latter it is found in cavities, as hairlike
filaments, which are generally encrusted with minute, perfect hexagonal
prisms of white transparent mimetesite.
Chlorobromide of Silver.?This mineral was discovered by Mr. G. cworobro-
Foord in the silver reef, St. Arnaud, where it occurs above the water-level silver,
in cavities, cracks, and joints of the quartz, as small roundish grains and
crystals, which are often loosely aggregated or connected together like beads
on a string. Their colour varies between bright asparagus green and
greyish green when freshly broken from the reef, becoming gradually
darker on exposure to the atmosphere. In size the crystals hardly exceed
a large pin?s head, and they are very seldom perfectly developed, but
exhibit the planes of the cube with octahedron, and more rarely the rhombic
dodecahedron. Their chemical composition is, according to analysis by the
late Mr. Charles Wood, analyst of the Geological Survey, the following :

On account of the occurrence of this ore in some quantity in the silver
reef, its extraction, or rather that of the silver, has become of practical
importance. The methods introduced for this purpose are the Freiberg
amalgamation, in connection with Foord?s improved modification of Percy?s
hyposulphite of soda process. The results hitherto obtained have ranged
from 20 to above 100 ounces of silver per ton of lodestone. From the
disappearance of the mineral beneath the level, where a strongly saline
water circulates through the reef, and where veins and strong impregnations
of a highly argentiferous galena make their first appearance (in a hard solid
quartz which contrasts strongly with the friable cavernous one above), there
can hardly be a doubt that it, as well as ? arseniate? and ? carbonate of
lead,?* with which it is often found associated, have arisen from the decom-
position of galena ; probably in connection or impregnated with sulphide
or sulpho-arsenide of silver, formerly existing above the water level.

Zinc. ?This metal has been found in a basalt quarry at Collingwood, and
in the upper pliocene golddrift of Creswick Creek and Daylesford. The
specimen from the first locality came from a cavity in the basalt (coated
with ?arragonite?) nearly 20 feet beneath the surface,was of flattish, irregular
shape, about 19 ounces in weight, and showed in places a whitish coating of
? carbonate of zinc,? intermixed with ? carbonate of lime? and rose-coloured
dots of ? cobaltbloom/?f The specimens from the other localities were
small nodules, coated also with ? carbonate of zinc and lime.? All the
samples contained only small traces of ? cadmium,? those from Creswick
about 1 per cent., according to an analysis by the late Dr. Macadam.
It may also be mentioned here that several years ago a roundish washed
piece of ? zinc,? above one pound in weight, was shown in Melbourne
as found by miners in the golddrift of the Mitta Mitta River, New South
Wales.
Zinchlende ( Sulphide of Zinc ). ?This mineral ?the ? Black Jack? of

Lead. ?The occurrence of this metal has lately been made known
by Mr. E. Brough Smyth in the older pliocene drift lead of Mount
Greenock and the Avoca main or deep lead. Several ounces have already
been saved in the shape of roundish and flat grains, of all sizes, with a few
small, irregular, nuggetty pieces, weighing several pennyweights. Many
of the particles contain gold specks embedded.
Corusite: Cerusite (Carbonate of Lead). ? Occurs tolerably abundantly in small

also in the outcrop of the Nicholson?s Reef, Castlemaine, associated with
fibrous malachite ? in the Glen Dim Reef, Landsborough, &c. It has, no
doubt, arisen from the decomposition of galena. In the Wilson?s Reef, for
instance, the cavities in which it is found are mostly in galena, and are
generally filled with a blueish-black powder, consisting principally of this
ore. The crystals from these cavities are often well modified and
colourless, transparent, with strong adamantine lustre. Twin-crystals of
the usual cross form are also not rare. (See Figures 2, 3.)

found, presenting perfectly-transparent, thin, needle-shaped, hexagonal
prisms, with adamantine lustre, and modified by planes of the hexagonal
pyramid (see Fig. 4), also specimens with specks of gold enclosed between
the crystals. The crystals from the Chrysolite Reef are generally
colourless and transparent, short, often tabular hexagonal prisms
(see Fig. 5); occasionally some are found of a dark brown colour,
with resinous lustre, and exhibiting the peculiar barrel-shape. It
would, indeed, appear as if this shape were only a characteristic of
the coloured, non-transparent variety ; for at the silver reef, where
the crystals are generally opaque and of light brown or yellow
colour, with resinous lustre, they all exhibit this peculiarity.
Sometimes cavities are found in the latter reef coated with fine,
transparent, acicular crystals ; also specimens showing the mineral closely
associated with chlorobromide of silver and gold. According to a quanti-

in a similar manner in the Glen Dhu Reef, Landsborough.
Galena ( Sulphide of Lead). ? Is generally met with finely impregnated Galena:
in most, perhaps all, auriferous quartz reefs?a circumstance which leads Leia hl<le of
the experienced quartz miner to regard its appearance in the quartz as a
favourable sign for the presence of gold in the neighbourhood. Specimens
of a rather coarse granular character, with ? cerusite ? in small cavities, have
lately been brought from Gippsland, said to be taken from the outcrop of a
well-defined lode of this ore. In the western face of the Wilson?s Reef, St.
Arnaud (300 feet level south of the shaft), it occurs in solid patches,
strings, and irregular veins near two inches thick, also pulverulent, forming
in all, perhaps, three to four per cent, of the ?payably? auriferous portion of
the lode, at this point near 14 feet wide, the whole reef presenting a
width of above 40 feet.?' Strong veins of this ore have also recently been
discovered beneath the water level in the silver reef, St. Arnaud. In
accordance with the characteristics of this mineral in all parts of the world,
it contains here also variable amounts of silver, ranging according to nume-
rous assays from 20 to above 100 ounces per ton of ore. This latter high
yield for galena is _ reported from the silver reef, St. Arnaud, and is most
likely due to some richer silver-ore (perhaps ? proustite,? or ? silver-glance?)
being minutely 7 disseminated through the mass.t It is a singular fact,
that although galena is frequently found associated, and, as for instance at
the Pyrenees Reef, densely impregnated with fine gold, the latter metal,
according to the assays, never assumes the place of the silver, or even con-
jointly occupies it in the composition of the ore. Crystals of galena are
extremely rare, and those which have been as yet observed are small and
very imperfect cubes, with planes of the octahedron.

As shown by these results, the mineral can hardly be considered as a
well-defined species, and there is every reason to suppose that it has
actually been formed, or at least grown in the drift, small particles derived
from quartz reefs in the neighbourhood having perhaps served as nuclei
as several specimens have been discovered, enclosing small specks of alluvial
(waterworn) gold.

ranges from light-yellow to brown and jet-black, and there are sometimes

the pyramid, with replacements by another prism and pyramid?are not
rare at the Ovens. As regards size, the stream tin from all districts
varies generally between fine and coarse sand, pieces as large as a pea or
bean being comparatively rare. Several specimens of above an ounce in
weight, with, in one or two instances, portions of granitic rock attached,
have been found at the Ovens and Strathbogie, yet no veins of the ore,
or rock masses impregnated with it, have hitherto been discovered, though
there can hardly be a doubt that both exist, and that granite is the re-
spective matrix. At the Ovens the locale of such veins, or rock masses,
will most likely be within a narrow zone along the granite and silurian
boundary, as most of the creeks rising in silurian rocks are reported
to be tin-bearing only after they pass that geological line, and the tin-
ore is far coarser near it, than further down the creeks. The ? washing-
stuff? of some of the Ovens creeks affords fine specimens of the so-called
? regenerated granite,? often richly impregnated with gold and tin-ore,
it being granitic detritus, firmly cemented together by hydrous oxide of
iron. The following are results of assays of ? tin,? ?or ? black sand,? ?by
Mr. C. Newbery :
A sample from the Beech worth district gave as a mean of four assays
53 ?5 per cent of tin, which was not, however, quite pure, but contained
some iron, as seen by the crystallised surface of the buttons.
A sample from the Upper Yarra Tin Company?s claim, consisting of
cassiterite, titaniferous iron, schorl, sapphires, and gold, gave about 30
per cent, of pure tin-ore, which yielded 67'5 per cent, of tin.
Meteoric Iron. ?Two large masses, one of half a ton, the other of about Meteoric
four tons in weight, as also several smaller pieces, have been found in the Iron ?
neighbourhood of Cranbourne. The smaller mass is exhibited at the
Public Museum in Melbourne, the larger one at the British Museum.

in the tertiary rocks around the sea coast, at Bacchus Marsh, &c. Both in
the quartz reefs and auriferous conglomerates it is very common, occurring
in the former as small veins, filling crevices and cracks, and often wholly

occurs also occasionally in hollows of quartz reefs.
Bog Iron-ore. ?Occurs in the neighbourhood of Lake Connewarre, in
Batman?s Swamp, and will most likely be found around the margins of
all our lakes and swamps, more especially those which receive the drainage
from country covered by basalt, or where this rock has been denuded.
Clayey and Arenaceous Iron Stones. ?Are the most abundant, both in the
Silurian and tertiary rocks, forming beds, impregnated concretionary
patches, &c. These latter appear in the Silurian as indurated, lenticular
zones across the strike of the rocks (St. Arnaud), or more frequently are
confined to irregular patches, extending only a few feet beneath the surface
(Guildford, Malmsbury, &c.). Their origin appears to be principally due to
percolation of ferruginous water from a former denuded covering of basalt.
A peculiar variety of brown iron-ore, shot-like, or often pea or
bean shaped concretions, is abundantly distributed over the surface
of the basaltic plain of the Loddon valley and the slopes of the neigh-
bouring silurian ranges ; it occurs also in great quantities throughout the
extensive post-basaltic brown loam deposit which appears around the
margin of the Murray River basin, and in the river-valleys of the Werribee,
Loddon, Campaspe, Little River, &c. The following are results of assays
and an analysis, by Mr. C. Newbery, of samples of brown iron-ore from
different parts of the colony :

Attention has frequently been drawn in the newspapers to our various
deposits of iron-ore, and regret expressed at the want of public energy in
their not being made commercially available ; it is, however, to be feared
that this will remain a standing complaint until we can successfully com-
pete, as regards cheapness of production of the metal, with the principal
iron-producing country?Great Britain ?a time which can only arrive on
the discovery of good coal seams, easily accessible from the iron-ore
deposits, combined with a fall in the price of labour.
Titaniferous Iron Sand , Menaccanite, Iserine. ?Titaniferous iron sand
occurs abundantly in the gold drifts of perhaps all our goldfields ; in the
drainage channels from and in the detritus of basalt escarpments, of


which rock it forms no doubt an important component. As far as can be
made out, it consists of the two species, menaccanite and iserine,
Menaccanite. ?Appears mostly as very fine black sand, but is occasionally Menac-
also met with in small tabular crystals, with edges replaced (rhombohedfal), canite-
more frequently in flattish pieces up to the size of a small bean, showing
metallic adamantine cleavage planes, which can also be produced easily
by breaking rounded particles of the ore. Iserine does not occur so iserine.
frequently as the former, but generally also as fine sand; sometimes, how-
ever, as rounded grains of pea-size, and more rarely as small cube-
octahedral crystals. Larger grains on being broken show only imperfect
cleavage planes. It is strongly magnetic, and this property, in addition
to the indistinctness of the cleavage, appears to distinguish the uncrystal
lised mineral (sand or roundish grains), from menaccanite, which,
though closely resembling it in outward appearance and behaviour
before the blowpipe, is not, or only very slightly, magnetic.
Chromic Iron. ? ls found abundantly in the Heathcote Creek and Argyle Chromic
Gully, near MTvor, andreported from Riddell?s Creek, near Mount Macedon, Ir � n '
forming a fine black sand, wholly composed of minute, exceedingly sharp
octahedrons. It also occurs, finely impregnated in quartz reefs and quartzose
rocks, near Heathcote, Strathloddon, &c.
Wolfram. ?Occurs in a quartz reef in the neighbourhood of the Big Wolfram -
Hill railway tunnel, near Sandhurst, also in a quartz reef at Sandy Creek,
Tarrangower, associated with native bismuth, iron-glance, schorl. &c.
Crystals are extremely rare. The gold drifts of the Dandenong and Upper
Yarra goldfields, and more especially the drift of Ramshorn Gully, Sandy
Creek (a gully which heads at the quartz reef just mentioned), contain it
abundantly in small angular and rounded particles.
Chalybite, Spathic Iron (Carbonate of Iron). ? Forms the lodestoue Chalybite,
of the copper pyrites vein in Joss and Co.?s claim, Eagle-hawk carbonS
Reef, Maldon, and occurs also sparingly in small rhombohedrons Iron - Sphse-
with curved faces in crevices and joints of Lisle?s Reef, near Mount rosldcntes-
Tarrangower. Massive patches of this mineral have also been reported
from some of the reefs of St. Arnaud. The variety ? sphcero-
siderite ?? is tolerably abundant in the basalts of many localities (Loddon
outliers, Sunbury, Campaspe Falls, Ballan, &c.), generally those
basalts affected by decomposition, forming globular nobs and botryoidal
coatings of a yellow, or yellowish-brown colour in the cavities. Nodular
masses of this mineral occur also in the mesozoic coal measures near
Geelong.
Pharmacosiderite , Cube-ore (Arseniate of Iron). ? Has lately been found Rbannacosi-
as drusy coatings of brownish-red sub-transparent crystals (cubes), up cublfbre:
to one-eighth of an inch in size, in the Port Phillip Company?s mine, Arseniate o�
Clunes, covering quartz and ?? black manganese ore.? The larger crystals dantite.
show like rhombohedrons of ? brownspar,? a peculiar curvature of the
faces, as recorded of the sub-species of cube-ore ? Beudantite .? On the
smaller crystals, however, this feature is absent, and it would therefore
appear to be a character incident on the growth of the crystals beyond a
certain size. Some of the smaller crystals show Mso hemihedral planes of


the octahedron. Before the blowpipe this cube-ore shows a small trace of
manganese.
Perfect cubes of ? pharmacosiderite? of various shades of green, very
rarely reddish-brown colour, occur associated with arsenical pyrites in
cavities of the Beehive and German Reefs, Maldon, the Armenian Reef,
St. Arnaud, and several of the reefs of Maryborough, Sandhurst, and
Crooked River,
This mineral has, perhaps, in all instances resulted from the decomposi-
tion of arsenical pyrites (an ore which is always found more or less
decomposed in its neighbourhood), and occurs in the Beehive Reef,
Maldon, occasionally associated with, or enclosing, minute specks of gold,
which were no doubt once contained in the pyrites.
Scorodite: Scorodite (Arseniate of Iron). ?Forms drusy coatings of small, well-
Arseniate � f developed leek-green and liver-brown crystals, in cavities of the Abe
Lincoln Reef, Crooked River, always associated with arsenical pyrites.
It also occurs, though rarely, in Blucher?s Reef, Maryborough, and in the
Beehive Reef, Maldon ; in the latter not unfrequently associated with
? pharmacosiderite,? the crystals of both minerals being in close contact, as
if simultaneously formed.
The form of the crystals of scorodite, both from the Abe Lincoln
Reef and Beehive Reef, accords exactly with that of specimens from Saxony
(Fig 6). In some of the claims on the Beehive Reef a pale-greenish
earthy mineral is met with, forming ochreous crusts in cavities of the
quartz, and on arsenical pyrites. As this substance exhibits before the
blowpipe, and also tested in the moist way, all the chemical characters of
scorodite, it might perhaps justly be classed as ? earthy, or ochreous
scorodite .?
Vivianite, Vivianite, Blue Iron Earth ( Phosphate of Iron). ?Occurs in nodular
Earth*-' 011 earthy masses of a pale smalt-blue colour in the older decomposed basalt
Phosphate of Phillip Island, especially in places where recent guano deposits exist on
of iron. fljg surface, its origin in this instance being most probably due to the
water percolating through the guano becoming charged with phosphate of
ammonia, which acted on the iron of the decomposed basalt. Blue Iron
Earth has also been reported from the basalt of Ballarat.
Nontronite Nontronite, Chloropal (Silicate of Iron).? ls found in Brewer?s
chioropai �eef, Maldon, in irregular small seams and patches of light pistachio to
smcate of b o ttl e -g reen colour, mostly soft and earthy. It also occurs in a similar
manner at several places in the first few feet of the Silurian rock bottom
of the ? Pretty Sally?s Lead,? Maldon.
Copperas, Copperas, Green Vitriol (Sulphate of Iron). ?Occurs in groups of light

the blowpipe, it affords small traces of copper.
Copiapite(?): Copiapite (?) (Basic Sulphate of Iron). ?This mineral, which is, no doubt

Iron. is disseminated, through certain beds of the upper miocene formation near


Point Addis, Geelong, to such an extent (above 50 per cent.) as to render it
probably of commercial importance. The beds have the appearance of
yellow sandstone, and an analysis of a sample by Mr. R. Daintree, the
discoverer of the deposit, gave the following results :

According to this latter result the mineral does not (except as regards
sulphuric acid) correspond in chemical composition with any of the species
generally classed under ? Copiapite ? ( Fibroferrite, Stypticite , &c.J; however,
as these latter are not considered well-defined chemical compounds, and
as from its mode of occurrence the mineral under notice could not be
analysed per se, and some of the iron and potassa may therefore have
come from the rock material through which the mineral is disseminated,
we should hardly be justified in naming it as a new species.
Iron Pyrites (Cubic Pyrites).? This mineral?the ? mundic? of the ironPyrite
quartz miner?is the most common ore in auriferous quartz reefs, rites,
occurring in narrow veins, or finely impregnated in many cases to the extent
of 6 to�B per cent, per ton of lodestone. It is always more or less
auriferous ; the results of assays ranging from 1| to 200 ozs. of gold per
ton. Localities where auriferous pyrites especially rich occur are
Morse?s Creek, Ovens district, Mount Blackwood, Crooked River, Tarran-
cower, St. Arnaud, &c. It is sometimes also argentiferous, as, for instance,
at the?Glen Dhu Reef,? Landsborough, from Avhence a sample, assayed by
Mr. C. Newbery, yielded :

Gold 1 4 1 >
Crystals and druses of pyrites are very frequent, presenting mostly cubes
with the planes of the pentagonal dodecahedron. In Bell?s Reef, Tarran-
gower, cubes have been found of half an inch and more in size. The slates,
generally those of a blueish-black colour, and also though more rarely the
sandstones, which form the walls of reefs, contain abundance of small,
perfect, cubical crystals (Wattle Gully Reefs, Castleraaine ; Kangaroo Reef,
Malmsbury ; Mariner?s Reef, Maryborough; Liverpool Reef, Tarilta, &c.);
and more rarely pentagonal dodecahedrons, sometimes flattened (Nuggetty
Reef, South Muckleford), and cubes modified by the latter, and the octa-
hedron (Raspberry Creek Reefs, Garibaldi and Shamrock Reefs, Woods-
point district, &c.). This kind of pyrites has also been proved to be auri-
ferous to the extent of from a quarter to two ounces of gold per ton. It is
more easily decomposed by the action of the atmosphere than the pyrites


of the reefs, and there is this peculiar difference to be observed, that the
pyrites embedded in the slates is generally converted into ? basic-sulphate
of iron,? imparting to the rock in places quite a mottled-yellowish colour
and an alum taste, whilst that of the sandstone seems mostly to change
into ? brown iron-ore.? In the gold drifts (Ballarat, Daylesford, Clunes
leads, Loddon River alluvium, near Vaughan, &c.), pyrites is often found
encrusting or entirely replacing roots and driftwood ; such specimens very
quickly decompose on exposure to the atmosphere, and samples have, on
assay by Messrs. Daintree, Latta, and Newbery, likewise yielded from a
few pennyweights to several ounces of gold per ton. According to Mr.
H. A. Thompson,* ?a beautiful specimen of crystallised iron pyrites,
deposited on a piece of wood, taken from the drift immediately below the
basalt at Ballarat, gave by assay 40 ozs. of gold per ton ; and in another
case, where only the pyrites from the centre *)f an old tree trunk was
examined, the yield was over 30 dwts. of gold per ton. Some of the fine
dust obtained in washing out the gold at the Royal Saxon claim, Ballarat,
yielded by assay over 15 ozs. of gold per ton. When placed under the
microscope, this dust was seen to be composed of minute crystals of pyrites,
aggregated into round pellets from l-300th to 1-100 th of an inch in
diameter, the surface being roughened by the projecting angles of the
crystals and un-waterworn.?
The auriferous character of the pyrites contained in our quartz reefs
(including under this general term the two species next to be noticed, viz.,
arsenical and magnetic pyrites, which also contain gold), has long been
known, and many persons have drawn attention to the great loss (computed
at from 50 75 per cent, of the total loss) which the quartz miner suffers
through the escape of these ores during the process of crushing; still the
experiments made hitherto, to effect their saving, have only been very
limited, and but partially successful, and therefore no comprehensive
system, both for saving and treating them, for the extraction of the gold,
has as yet been generally introduced. The extraction of the gold from the
pyrites is comparatively speaking a simple process, consisting in roasting
the ore sweet and amalgamating the residue ; but there are several cir-
cumstances combining to make the profitable concentration of the pyrites
a most difficult problem to solve. On account of the high price of labour,
it would, for instance, in most cases not pay to allow the crushed material
to settle, and to conduct the extraction of the pyrites as a separate operation.
The machinery for this purpose must commence its action directly the
waste leaves the last gold-saving apparatus, and its working effect
must besides be commensurate with the supply of material from
the stamps. In addition to this there is, however, another the
chief problem to solve?namely, that of acting up to the principle upon
which all known systems of wet ore-dressing are based ? i.e., the making
use of the, in this instance very small, difference in the respective specific
gravities of quartz and pyrites. To effect this, even when the two mine-
rals are in grains of equal size, is extremely difficult, and the difficulty is
here considerably increased owing to the finer state of subdivision as
compared with that of quartz, to which the pyrites is reduced on account
of its greater brittleness, and to obviate the ill effects of which would

require costly classifying apparatus and great care and supervision. On
reviewing all these points in their various bearings, it must be considered
a matter of congratulation on the part of the mining community that
recently a machine has been invented, or rather an old well-known machine
?the percussion table ?rendered capable, by a few simple additions and
by being worked in a certain manner, of easily and satisfactorily saving the
pyrites, as proved by a number of successful experiments on a large scale.
A description of the new method and machine are given by Mr. H. A.
Thompson, the inventor, in the paper cited above, as also a succinct
account of a number of experiments, and of all points connected with the
saving of pyrites and of gold generally.
Arsenical Pyrites (Mispickel) . ?Is, next the former, the most frequent Arsenical
ore in auriferous reefs, occurring in solid veins often several inches thick Mispickel.
(Whip Reef, Sandhurst; Lisle?s and Manton?s Reefs, Tarrangower, &c.),
irregular patches, and finely impregnated. According to numerous assays
it is generally highly auriferous, containing from 2 up to 40 ozs. of gold
per ton. Crystals are not very frequent in the reefs, but occur often, though
of the simplest form, in great abundance in the slate and sandstone walls,
cross-shaped twins being very common amongst them (Fig. 7 and 8). It seems
to decompose easily (though less so than iron pyrites), imparting a greenish
colour to the quartz, casing, and rock walls, and giving rise to the formation
of two species of arseniates of iron, ? pharmacosiderite" and ? scorodite)
which have already been described. Sometimes, especially in sandstone,
it is also found converted into brown iron-ore, or wholly removed, whence
originate those peculiar oblong slits and cross-shaped cavities observable in
the bounding rocks of many reefs (Nimrod Reef and Wattle Gully Reefs,
Castlemaine ; Wilson?s Reef, St. Arnaud, Ac).
Pyrrhotine (Magnetic Pyrites). ?ls tolerably abundant in the reefs of pyrrhotine:
the Howqua river district, also in Specimen Gully Reef, Castlemaine*; p } f?? e e g ic
Nuggetty, Brewer?s, and Tiverton Reefs, Maldon, &c., occurring generally
finely impregnated, more rarely in narrow irregular veins and small solid
patches. At the Tiverton Reef it is densely impregnated through the
metamorphic sandstone which forms the walls of the reef, and small though
imperfect crystals are occasionally met with. It contains according to
assays from two to ten ounces of gold per ton. An analysis by Mr. Charles
Wood of a specimen of the ore from a reef on Mount Timbertop, Howqua
river district, gave ?

Psilomelane (Black Ferro-Manganese-ore).? This ore occurs very Psjmme-
abundantly in mammillary crusts and concretions in the quartz reefs of all Black Ferro

localities the place of the common brown iron-ore in cementing the pebbles

together ?for instance, at the Hard Hills, Strangway?s; the Shakspeare Hill,
Tarilta, &c.?and then often contains specks of gold embedded. In quartz
reefs it appears as one of the most recently-formed minerals : as, wherever
in contact, it forms coatings over most of the others (gold, quartz, chlo-
robromide of silver, iron and arsenical pyrites, &c., ? diallogite ? and
? cube-ore,? which have been found at Clunes coating it, being rare
exceptions.) From certain appearances in the drift-heaps of recent workings
on the Shakspeare Hill and the Hard Hills, its formation seems to be going
on rapidly, even at the present day, as the surface of those heaps is dotted
over with black patches and small concretions, the latter often connected
together in, so to say, solid dendritical shapes. In the sands and clays it
occurs in cylindrical pieces, composed of connected nodules, not unlike a
series of knots on a string, sometimes flattened, sometimes elongated, the
terminal nodules being generally more or less conical or pointed, imparting
the idea that they are slowly growing or creeping onward through the
matrix in which they occur. Frequently several of these cylindrical pieces
are found like dendrites connected together. With regard to the latter in
general, they are found abundantly distributed through the Silurian slates
and sandstones on every goldfield. The following are results of analyses
by Mr. C. Newbery, of Psilomelane, from several different localities :
100*34 100*71 98*87 99*90
I. Specimen from Parkin?s Reef, Tarrangower; forms mammillary crusts in crevices
and joints of the quartz.
11. Specimen from a quartz reef at Ramshorn Gully, Sandy Creek, occurring in
narrow veins and mammillary crusts.
111. Specimen from Strathloddon, forming fine botryoidal crusts in crevices of hard
ferruginous Silurian sandstone.
IV. Specimens from Gipps Land occurs massive, containing cavities filled and coated
with earthy matter.
A comparison of the results of these analyses shows, that the specimens
do not only not agree amongst themselves, but differ still more strongly in
chemical composition from European specimens?the principal distin-
guishing points, as regards the latter, being the considerable amount of iron
and smaller quantity of manganese they contain (No. IV. makes a slight
exception); though in outward appearance and general physical character
there is hardly any apparent difference between the respective specimens.
? Psilomelane? from its variable chemical composition, is, however, generally
not regarded as a well-defined mineral species: and though our colonial ore
differs very greatly from the European one, still it would not be advisable
to separate it as a new species, though as a variety it would certainly
deserve to be called ? Blade Ferro-Manganese-ore .?
Wad, Bog-Manganese. ?Occurs near Merton, in the valley of the Goulbum.


Diallogite (Carbonate of Manganese ). ?Occurs in crevices and cavities Diaiiogite:
in the quartz reefs of the Port Phillip Company?s mine at Chines, forming JgJSJg*
mammillary and botryoidal crusts of rose-red colour over quartz and
psilomelane.
Rutile (Titanic Acid). ?Is occasionally found in the washdirt of the R U tiie:
Blue Mountain and Upper Yarra goldfields, in fiattish, slender pieces, TitamcAcid.
which are sub-transparent, of a brownish-red colour, and show metallic
adamantine cleavage planes. Crystals are very rare; those found are
small, longitudinally striated, eight-sided prisms, modified by well-
developed planes of two dimetric octahedrons (Fig. 9).
Brooldte (Titanic Acid). ?This rare mineral was first identified by Br ookite:
Mr. R. Brough Smyth, in quartz brought by Mr. Gladman from the Baw Titanic Acid
Baw diggings, Gippsland, It forms thin seams of a light chocolate
colour.
Chrome Ochre. ?Is found in thin irregular seams and patches of dark chrome
emerald-green, or sometimes yellowish-green colour, in several quartz <)clne ?
reefs near Heathcote, Strathloddon, and other places. It is apparently
no fixed chemical compound, but simply a clayey material coloured by an
admixture in variable proportions of oxide of chromium, derived from the
decomposition of minute octahedral crystals of chromic iron, scattered
through the quartz. The greenish-coloured spots frequently observable
in the respective reefs have also the same origin.
Molybdenite (Sulphide of Molybdenum).? Fine hexagonal plates ofMoiybde-
this mineral, with the terminal edges replaced (Fig. 10), and of from | inch sulphide of
to i inch diameter, occur thickly embedded in a quartz vein traversing yMe ?
granite at Yackandandah; it also occurs in a similar manner at Reedy
Creek, and very sparingly dispersed in small scales through the granite
at the breweries, near Maldon. The Yackandandah mineral contains,
according to assays, a small percentage of silver.
Cervantite ( Antimonial Ochre). ?Is frequently found in the antimony
reef, Costerfield, forming light-yellow to cream-coloured crusts on grey ochre,
antimony ore ; its origin, as well as that of the two minerals next to be
noticed, being no doubt due to the decomposition of the latter.
Valentinite (White Antimony).? Occurs very sparingly in small light-
yellow and rose-red prismatic crystals, with pearly lustre, in crevices and mony.
hollows of grey antimony at the antimony reef, Costerfield, and the
Morning Star Reef, Woodspoint (Drysdale?s claim).

reefs of Ballarat, Daylesford, Maryborough, Blackwood, Caledonia, and
Anderson?s Creek goldfields, &c. At all the places mentioned, this ore
is always in connection with auriferous quartz, and is itself frequently
visibly impregnated with specks of gold. Assays have shown up to 8 ozs.
of gold and 80 ozs. of silver per ton. It is very rarely found crystallised.
Some specimens from Drysdale?s claim, Morning Star Reef, show slender,
generally curved, four-sided prisms, longitudinally deeply striated, with
very imperfect terminal planes. Costerfield is at present the only locality
where this ore is saved and utilised ; partly for the production of anti-
monium, partly for export to England. The following are results of two
analyses by Mr. Charles Wood of different samples of grey antimony from
Costerfield :

I. Specimen of fine crystalline ore.
11. Specimen of antimony very dense and of pure steel-grey colour.
Washed pieces of grey antimony have repeatedly been found in the
washdirt of some of the deep leads of Ballarat, no doubt derived from
quartz reefs in the neighbourhood.
Native Sulphur. ?Occurs sparingly in small, shining, imperfectly-
developed crystals in crevices and hollows of grey antimony in the antimony
reef, Costerfield, and the Fentiman?s Reef, Maldon. To judge from their
recognisable planes, the crystals from the latter reef would, if perfect, be
apparently very highly modified (see Fig. 11). Native sulphur is also met
with in clear light-yellow grains, scattered through a bluish-black
powdery substance, principally composed of galena, which fills cavities
and crevices in the Wilson?s Reef, St. Arnaud, and the Specimen Gully
Reef, Castlemaine.
SILICATES, AND PRECIOUS STONES THAT DO NOT CONTAIN
SILICA.
Zeolites. ? Analcime. ? Occurs abundantly in druses of fine, mostly trans-
parent, colourless crystals, in the amygdaloidal basalt of Phillip Island,
their form being generally the unmodified trapezohedron ; small planes
of the octahedron occur very rarely. The size of the crystals varies from
a small pin?s-head to that of a pea.
Natrolite , Mesotype. ?ls generally associated with analcime in the basalt of
Phillip Island, forming divergent, interlacing, or mostly stellate bunches of
white or colourless transparent acicular crystals, presenting a combination
of the rectangular prism, surmounted by a pyramid over the faces; only
occasionally crystals are met with, modified by a second pyramid replacing
the terminal edges of the former (Figs. 12 and 13). Nodules of natrolite,

often several inches in diameter, with a fine radiating structure, are also not
rare in this locality.
Chabazite. ?Occurs abundantly in druses of small, yellow, opaque, some- chabazite.
times semi-transparent crystals, in hollows of the decomposed older basalt
of the Pentland Hills, near Bacchus Marsh; also as small white, sub-
transparent crystals in the basalt bordering the Tullaroop Creek, near
Chines. Druses of perfectly transparent, colourless, often highly-modified
single and compound crystals are found in the basalt obtained from the
shaft sunk near De Graves?s mill, Malmsbury. (Figs. 14?16.)
Gmelinite. ?Is found very sparingly in small nests of yellowish or pale Gmeiinite.
flesh-coloured opaque crystals, in the amygdaloidal basalt of Phillip Island.
The form of the crystals is exactly that of European specimens. (Fig. 17.)
Herschelite. ?This rare zeolite was first discovered by Mr. Charles Herscheiite
Wilkinson, of the Geological Survey, in the basalt quarry near Richmond,
where it occurs in fine druses, and occasionally solitary perfect crystals,
white, opaque, or semi-transparent, on a thin deposit of greenish-black
soapy clay, which lines the cavities and cracks of the basalt. The form
of the crystals is a thin hexagonal table, composed of a double six-sided
pyramid, the faces uneven, of fine glassy lustre, truncated by curved, dull,
or roughish-looking planes. The hexagonal prism has not been observed as
yet, but many crystals show small triangular replacements by a second,
more obtuse pyramid, on the terminal corners of the main pyramid ; and it
must also be mentioned that the planes of the latter are broken ? i.e.,
exhibit indented angles?in the direction of the,main axis (see Figs. 18. ab ),
a phenomenon which must lead to the conclusion that the crystals are
individually compounded of several rhombohedrons, with the basal plane
in common. An accurate measurement of angles would be a matter of
great difficulty. The crystals are generally aggregated in fan-shape, or by
crossing each other at various angles, form rosette-like groups, somewhat
resembling double crosses of ?Phillipsite.? (Fig. 19.) Their size seldom
exceeds | of an inch.
Heulandite ?Occurs sparingly as thin drusy coatings, composed of very Heuiandite
small, semi-transparent, yellowish crystals, in the crevices and joints of the
metamorphic sandstone which forms the walls of Lisle?s Reef and Lennox?s
Reef, near Mount Tarrangower. The crystals appear in no way to differ
in form from those obtained in the silver mines of St, Andreasberg, in the
Hartz. (Figs. 20 and 21.)
Feldspars. ? Orthoclase. ?Besides forming the principal component of orthoclase
our granitic rocks, this species occurs in veins, either solid or massively Aduiaria:
associated with quartz, in the neighbourhood of the granite and Silurian Moonstone-
boundaries (Maldon, Elphinstone, Harcourt, &c.). Crystals are compara-
tively rare. Very perfect ones, though partly decomposed, are found in
the detritus of a feldspar porphyry dyke in Timbillica Valley, East Gipps-
laud, and in that of a similar dyke near Kangaroo Flat, Talbot. About
three miles due east of the township of Bradford, near Maldon, a patch
of quartz occurs in the granite, interlaced with pink-coloured orthoclase
crystals in four-sided prisms, some three-quarters of an inch square and


two to three Inches long ; they are, however, terminally, seldom well
developed. From Reid?s Creek, near Beechworth, fine druses have been
exhibited, showing well-developed flesh-coloured crystals of two to three
inches in size; also small pieces of Adularia ( Moonstone), with weak
chatoyant reflections,
Aibite. Alhite. ?Forms narrow veins and druses of fine crystals in the Blacksmith?s
Gully Reef, Fryerstown. At several places the quartz of this reef assumes
quite a porphyritic appearance by embedded crystals of alhite; at other
spots both minerals are mixed in such a manner as to justify the term
? binary granite.? Groups of aibite crystals occur at Eaglehawk Reef,
Sandhurst, also in several quartz reefs, and in a syenitic rock, in the
neighbourhood of Tarilta, A quantitative analysis of aibite from the
Blacksmth?s Gully Reef, by the late Mr. Charles Wood, Geological Survey
analyst, gave the following results: ?
Silica 68'73
Alumina ? - 20'55
Sesquioxide of iron 0-20
Lime trace
Potassa trace
Soda ... 10*43
oiigodase. Oiigodase. ?This species is found in transparent colourless, occasionally
white opaque pieces, with imperfect crystal outline, in the scoriaceous
basalts of Mount Franklin and the Anakies. Round the margin of Lake
Purrumbete washed pieces of similar character, with occasionally crystal
planes, are found in great abundance, no doubt derived from the scoria-
ceous basaltic lava of the neighbourhood. Oiigodase of a pale grey or
greenish colour is also, though rarely, met with in the granite of the Black
Hill near Kyneton, of Tarrangower, Harcourt, &c. According to a quanti-
tative analysis by the late Mr, Wood, the composition of specimens from
the Anakies is the following;?

the neighbourhood of Malmsbury, appearing as slender prismatic, yellowish-
white crystals, which densely interlace the rock. Small, imperfect tabular
crystals are also met with in cavities of this dolerite, and in the anamesite
of Table Hill, near Guildford, and the Loddon basaltic outliers generally.
Kaolin. Kaolin. ?Forms extensive deposits at Bulla Bulla, Dunolly, Govett?s home
station near Kyneton, and other places. An attempt was made by a
company to work the deposit at Bulla Bulla, but, probably on account of
the high price of labour, the undertaking has not proved successful.
Fire Clay. Fire Clay. ?A fine white variety of this material covers, as a bed of
above three feet in thickness, the lignite deposit at Lai Lai, near Ballarat.

coatings, in the Blacksmith?s Gully Reef, Fryerstown; also in a similar
manner in several quartz reefs at Bendigo. At the former locality this
mineral has evidently arisen from the decomposition of ? albite,? which is
always in close contact with it, and more or less of a soft, crumbling
character. According to an analysis by the late Mr. Wood, the composi-
tion of this pholerite is as follows; ?

materially from it by its chemical composition and physical properties,
and therefore forms a new mineral species, which is named after Mr. A.
R. C. Selwyn, the director of the Geological Survey of Victoria. It
occurs massive as a vein in the upper Silurian Rocks, near Heathcote, and
is traversed by thin seams of ? Talc.? The hardness of the mineral is
3-5 ; specific gravity, 2-53. Its colour is a fine emerald green,'which has
caused many persons to mistake it for copper ore. It is translucent on
the edges ; fracture, uneven and splintery ; brittle ; lustre, earthy ; takes
a fair polish, and might perhaps be used for ornamental purposes. Before
the blowpipe it becomes white, and fuses on the edges to a greyish white
blebby glass; gives off water in a mattrass ; colours the beads of borax
and salt of phosphorus faintly chrome-green; it is only partially soluble in
the strong acids. A quantitative analysis by Mr. J, Cosmo Newberry
afforded the following results ?

also been found in the same locality.

The partly-decomposed basalts and the clays of the gold drifts and
fossiliferous tertiaries around the coast are generally very rich in nodules
and veins of amorphous silicates of alumina and magnesia, of uncertain,
i. e., variable, composition; specimens resembling ? allophane,? ? halloysite,?
?meerschaum,? &c., have been found at many places.
Talc. ?Occurs in thin veins of a silvery-white colour and fine lustre in
Selwynite, near Heathcote.
Chlorite. ?Is found very sparingly as thin scaly coatings in Lady Gully
Reef, and in a reef at Wattle Flat, near Castlemaine, also in Blacksmith?s
Gully Reef, Fryerstown, sometimes enclosed in rock-crystal; in this manner
it also occurs at Beechworth, and other places. On the top of the high
range, N.E. of Yandoit, it occurs frequently as scaly coatings in the slate
and sandstone beds, which form the walls of the numerous quartz
reefs traversing the range.
Micas. ? Muscovite Oblique Mica. ?Besides forming one of the principal
components of our granites and grey feldspar porphyries, this species is
found in fine light-green oblique crystals in sandstone at Beechworth ; also
in large plates of dark brown, or sometimes tortoise-shell colour at the
Glenelg, in the neighbourhood of Harrow ; in the granite hills near the
Anakies, Geelong ; at Reid?s Creek, Beechworth, and other places.
Biotite ( Hexagonal Mica). ?Occurs in large hexagonal plates of dark-
brown colour in a basaltic dyke, which forms the hanging wall of the
Eureka Reef, near Castlemaine. The silvery-white mica of a diorite
porphyry dyke at the Castle Reef, Raspberry Creek (Woodspoint
district), may also perhaps belong to this species.
Rubellane. ?Is met with in small very regular hexagonal tables of a
fine brownish-red colour, in decomposed basalt, in the neighbourhood of
Vaughan and Footscray. It seems, according to all appearances, to
have originated from the decomposition of olivine.
Bucholzite Fibrolite (1). ?A mineral of fibrous massive?in places
distinctly prismatic structure ?and with bright pearly lustre, was brought
by the late Mr. M'Millan from the granite of the Moroka Valley,
Gippsland. Besides the outward character, its hardness and behaviour
before the blowpipe accord well with those given for fibrolite, or bucholzite.
Hornblende. ?Only the common black variety is at present known in
Victoria. Large, well-developed crystals (Figs. 22 and 23 a b ,) and
crystalline pieces, with splendent cleavage planes, occur in abundance,
associated with transparent oligoclase, in the scoriaceous basalt of the Ana-
kies. An analysis of a specimen of the same by Mr. R. Daintree afforded?

Large, though imperfect crystals, associated with hexagonal plates of
brown mica, occur in a basaltic dyke at the Eureka Reef, Castlemaine; and
small prismatic crystals are also occasionally met with in the granite of
Mount Alexander, Lancefield, M � lvor, and other places.
Rock?or Mountain ? Leather. ? Occurs occasionally in yellowish-white, Rock or
semi-transparent, thin, paper-like laminae, or sheets, in the joints and
crevices of the white silurian mud-slate which forms the bottom of the
older pliocene gold-drift of Kangaroo Hill and Table Hill, near Tarilta.
Pieces of this mineral have been found nearly as large as a man?s hand,
thin as fine paper, and flexible as leather. At first sight it might easily be
mistaken as of vegetable origin (lichen); its behaviour in fire, which has
no effect upon it beyond burning it perhaps a little brighter, shows,
however, its true mineral character.
Augite. ?Except that this mineral would theoretically form one Aagite.
of the principal components of our basalts, it can, as such, be very seldom
recognised. In the dolerite, at Malmsbury, it occurs in crevices and
cavities in small, black, acicular crystals, associated with small plates of
labradorite and iron-glance, also in imperfect crystals and crystalline pieces
in the scoriaceous basaltic lava of a point of eruption near the Black Hill,
Kyneton. From its appearance, cleavage, &c., and the result of a
quantitative analysis by Mr. C. Newbery, there is also good reason to
suppose that the dark-green component of the greenstone (diabase) of the
Barrabool Hills, near Geelong, is augite.
Obsidian. ?Button-shaped and sphaeroidal pieces of this mineral, from a obsidian,
quarter of an inch to several inches in diameter ?the larger ones sometimes
hollow inside?are found abundantly distributed over the surface of the
basaltic plains round Mount Elephant, Mount Eeles,&c., also, strange enough,
over the tertiary mud-plains of the Wimrnera, far removed from any known
basaltic craters, or points of eruption. It occurs in a basalt quarry near
Geelong, and in the basalt of Broadford, in patches and irregular veins of
an inch and more in thickness, of generally a black to brown, sometimes a
bluish-grey colour. Small button-shaped pieces have also been found in
the post-pliocene gold drift of Spring Creek, near Daylesford. The
following are results of analyses by Mr. C. Newbery of specimens of this
mineral from Geelong and the Wimrnera plains :

Olivine ( Chrysolite ). ?This mineral is so common in the newer basalts
(except where the latter appear as true ? dolerites?) as to deserve to be
regarded as an essential constituent of the rock. It generally appears
disseminated in small angular grains of light apple to blackish-green colour,
but at many places, especially in the neighbourhood of basaltic craters and
points of eruption (Mount Franklin, the Anakies, Gisborne Hill, the
Warrion Hills, &c.), it occurs in irregularly shaped, or sometimes sphse-
roidal, masses, of both fine and coarsely-granular texture, and from one to
five, in some instances (Anakies), to even twelve to eighteen inches, in
diameter. Crystals have not been observed as yet. An analysis by Mr.
Daintree of light-green olivine from the Anakies yielded:?
According to all appearances this mineral easily decomposes through atmos-
pheric influence, assuming at first chatoyant colours, then turning to reddish
brown, and ultimately, beneath a thin coating of hydrous oxide of iron,
changing to a brownish-red mica (? Rubellane?).
Tourmaline (Schorl ). ?Is a very common accessory of the granite of the
Maldon, Beechworth, Dandenong, St. Arnaud, Mount Alexander, &c., dis-
tricts, and occurs also abundantly, often in prisms, more than one inch in
diameter and two to three inches long, in the gold drifts that lie, or have
in earlier tertiary times lain, within the drainage area of those granites.
Fine crystals occur in the Dandenong Ranges, in a porphyritic vein in the
granite near Baynton?s station, Campaspe River, in the Ovens district, at
Wilson?s Promontory, Berwick, &c. (Figs, 24 a&b .) Near Beechworth
pebbles have been found in the gold drift, which consist, singular to say, of
a dense, flesh-coloured chalcedony, thickly interlaced with needles and well-
developed prisms of schorl. At Maldon and in the Ovens district, radiating
sphseroidal masses have been found, from two to six inches in diameter.
Near Peter?s diggings, St. Arnaud district, it occurs in a narrow zone of
metamorphic Silurian sandstone, running along the granite boundary, in such
abundance that the rock might not inaptly be termed, schorlrock. A
crystal of transparent green tourmaline, found in the bed of the River Yarra,
is in the possession o Mr. R. Brough Smyth, and others, from the Beech-
worth district, are in the collection of Dr. Bleasdale.
Topaz. ?Occurs (in tolerable abundance in crystals (Fig. 25 a>b>c ), and
rolled pebbles up to walnut size, colourless, or light yellow, transparent, on
French and Flinder?s Islands, Bass? Straits). In the gold drifts of
Dunolly several rolled specimens have been found above one inch in
diameter, showing a thin, colourless, or glass-like shell, round a nucleus of
light, limpid sky-blue. Similar blue and white topazes, though of small
size, occur also very frequently at the Woolshed, Sebastopol, Eldorado,
and Reid?s Creeks, Beechworth, and more rarely at Pleasant Creek and
Ararat, and in the Castlemaine and Sandhurst districts. A small crystal,
beautifully clear, like the finest rock crystal, and exhibiting all the planes of
Fig. 26, has lately been found at Beechworth. Pink-coloured specimens
are also reported from this locality.


Zircon, Hyacinth, (Jargon),? ls generally abundant in the gold drifts, zircon Hya

Tarilta'; Guildford, Daylesford, Ballan, Upper Yarra, Beechworth, S �?'
Specimens from the first-named locality, though small, are nearly always
transparent, more or less perfect crystals, and of a fine blood-red colour
sometimes approaching to carmine. The drifts of the Hard Hills, Campbell?s
Creek, near Castlemaine ; as well as those of Yandoit, Guildford, Taradale,
&c., afford abundance of small transparent colourless grains, showing ada-
mantine lustre and brilliancy. These are, no doubt, what would bewailed
? Jargons ? in Ceylon. The zircons (hyacinths) from Beechworth, Daylesford,
and the Upper larra are often very fine, and from their size and colour might
be valuable as gems. Small crystals are sometimes found at Daylesford, which
are very interesting, as they exhibit dichroism, appearing colourless or very
light bluish-green at right angles to the prism, and of a beautiful lustrous
emerald-green, with a tinge of blue in the direction of the main axis of the
crystals. As regards the general form of the latter from all localities men-
tioned, it is very simple?dimetric octahedron, with either first or second
prism, the latter the most frequent, or, rarely, both in combination. (Figs.
28-30.) Beechworth is the only locality where more modified crystals
have been found. (Figs. 31 and 32.) At the Blue Mountain goldfield, per-
fect dimetric octahedrons are not rare (see Fig. 22). It seems probable that
the zircons of Daylesford, Guildford, Ballan, the Blue Mountain, &c., are
derived from decomposed basalt, whilst those of Beechworth, the Upper
Yarra, &c., have had their origin in the granitic rocks of those districts.
Garnet (Almandine). ? ? Almandine,? or ?Precious Garnet,? occurs Garnet?

topol, and El Dorado, Beechworth district, also embedded in small roundish
grains in a dioritic dyke near Longwood, and in an euritic dyke on Lady
I ranklin Mountain, Barnawartha Creek. The Beechworth specimens are
generally roundish grains, hardly exceeding a small pea in size, and
their colour is a splendid deep claret-red, with a tinge of blue (pigeon blood).
Ihey would no doubt be valuable as gems if of larger size.
Common Red Garnet. ?Several specimens have been found in the
post-pliocene gold drift of Barker?s Creek, near Castlemaine, of a mica
schist like rock, with crystals (trapezohedrons) of a brownish-red, semi-
transparent, garnet, embedded. The original place of occurrence? i.e., the
rock in dtu?h&s not been discovered as yet. Specimens of mica schist full
of similar small garnets were lately brought from near Mount Murchison
on the Darling.

occurred, their colour is generally a mottled or cloudy mixture of transparent
deep blue, with patches of various shades of green and opaque grey or
black ; but several specimens have also been found with a fine, uniform

size. From the Upper Yarra a stone of a chrysoberyl-like green colour
(Oriental Emearld) was lately exhibited in Melbourne. This gem (now
in the possession of Dr. Bleasdale) has been cut, and being quite free from
cracks and weighing several carats, is valued at about �5O. At Beechworth,
sapphires are also said to be found which show a light amethyst colour
(Oriental Amethyst). Crystals of sapphire are pretty frequent, commonly
in six-sided, often barrel-shaped prisms, with pearly-white, somewhat
rounded basal planes ; sometimes they show also the hexagonal prism, with
pyramid and planes of a rhombohedron (see Fig. 33 and 34). The blue colour
of the lower part of such crystals often changes to colourless near the top.
Hexagonal plates above half an inch in diameter are not rare at Daylesford,
being parts of large crystals broken in the direction of the chief cleavage plane.
Oriental Ruby. ?Appears to be very rare, only one very small specimen of
a fine magenta colour from the Mount Eliza goldfield having as yet been
identified.
Asteria (Star Sapphire ). ?Several of these interesting stones have been
discovered at Beechworth by Dr. Bleasdale. Their ground colour is grey,
or bluish grey, and the six-rayed stars are well developed.
Adamantine Spar. ?Occurs often in washed grains in the drifts of
the Blue Mountain and Beechworth districts, showing a hair-brown
colour, with a silky opalescent lustre on the chief cleavage plane.
Corundum of an opaque dull white (quartz-like) greyish-brown, or occa-
sionally peach-blossom or magenta colour, in irregular roundish or globular
pieces up to nearly a pound in weight, occurs not unfrequently at Reid?s
Creek, Woolshed, Sebastopol, Sheep-station Creek, &c., Beechworth district.
The magenta-coloured variety has been named ? Barklyite? by Mr. Milner
Stephen, after Sir Henry Barkly, a former Governor of Victoria.
Black Corundum . ?Occurs abundantly in the drifts of nearly all the gold-
fields in half-angular or roundish pieces, often near the size of a large bean.
It shows conchoidal fracture, very rarely indistinct crystal and cleavage
planes, its specific gravity is 3 # 98, and its hardness sometimes over 9
scratching the sapphire. According to Mr. J. Cosmo Newbery, the chemical
composition of black corundum from the Dandenong goldfield is :
101*40
Black Spinel (Pleonaste). ?This species was first identifiedj byJMr.
Brough Smyth in ?heavy sand? brought from the Upper Yarra, where
it occurs sparingly in the gold drift, associated with zircon, sapphire, &c.
It has also been found at the Blue Mountain and Ballan (see Fig. 35).
Diamond. ?The genuineness of the occurrence of this precious stone at
the Beechworth goldfield has up to late years been doubted by many
persons here as well as in England ; the repeated finds, however, at the
Woolshed, El Dorado, Sebastopol, Reid?s and Worragee Creeks, of stones


of fine water, and of weights ranging from � to, in one or two instances,
2| carats, have placed the matter entirely beyond doubt. Fifty-six stones
have already (according to the mining statistics issued by the Mining
Department) been found, of which fifteen alone came from the sluicing
claim of Mr. Finn at the Woolshed, their weights varying from | to 1
carat. The colour of the Woolshed specimens was mostly a pale straw
yellow, a few showed a slight tinge of green, and the others were quite
colourless. The ? octahedron,? with small planes of the ? trisoctahedron?
(Fig. 36), appears to be the principal crystalline form of the Beechworth
diamonds. One of the larger stones, exhibited some time ago, was a nearly
perfect trisoctahedron (Fig. 37). Several specimens have also been found
showing quite a globular form, with a rough crust-like surface.
Considering that the diamond often occurs under conditions (covered
with a ferruginous crust, &c.) rendering it unrecognisable, except to the
most experienced eye, and that all those mentioned have been accidentally
found during the operation of ?panning off? the gold, after all pebbles
over about a quarter of an inch in size have been removed by sieve, it is
not improbable that not only a number of small ones, but more especially
the larger, and therefore far more valuable gems, are annually overlooked,
and that a regular systematic search, similar to that carried on in the
Ural, the Brazils, and East Indies, might prove a successful undertaking.
QUARTZ ?VITREOUS VARIETIES.
Quartz . ?Is, as the ? massive variety,? the most common of colonial Quart*:
minerals, represented by the thousands of auriferous and non-auriferous varieties,
reefs that traverse our silurian rocks, and also as extensive beds of quartz-
rock?some near 40 feet in thickness?in the lower miocene tertiary
formation. It is partly, and perhaps more commonly white opaque, or
what might be called ?milky quartz,? partly vitreous, semi-translucent.
Sometimes it shows, especially in veins traversing the granite, a greasy
lustre?? greasy quartz in the Belltopper Reef, Taradale, it is quite
sugary, or fine granular ; in some of the St. Arnaud and Heathcote reefs,
cellular; and in most auriferous reefs there occur opaque patches of a
uniform brown or yellow colour ?? ferruginous quartz.? The term ? good
looking ? is generally applied by the gold miner to quartz of a seamy,
mottled, or marble-like aspect (irrespective of there being any gold
embedded), produced by blueish, greenish, or brownish-coloured veins,
streaks, and patches, due to the decomposition of pyrites or other ores.
Druses of crystals (generally the hexagonal pyramid, with only a small
indication of the prism) occur in all reefs, yet not, as one would have
expected, in such abundance and beauty as in those ore-lodes of European
mining countries, where quartz, as it does here, forms the lode-stone.
Fine, very perfect, opaque white crystals (double hexagonal pyramid, with
narrow planes of the prism) occur in an elvan dyke near Baynton?s station,
on the Campaspe River; also, though less symmetrical and perfect,
in several felspar-porphyry dykes near Mount Tarrangower, and in
the Timbillica Valley, Gippsland. In quartz veins traversing the
granite, near Pigeon Hill, Tarrangower, specimens of the so-called
? Hauben? or ? Hood quartz? (Fig. 38 a & b .) are occasionally found,
and in cavities of the granite, near Baynton?s station, very fine
crystals occur (pyramid and prism), some near two inches in length and
three-quarters of an inch thick, composed of a colourless envelope, with


rather rouglxish dull faces surrounding a white opaque nucleus, formed
by a small crystal, in most instances hardly one-third the size of the
whole specimen. (Fig. 39.)
Quartz occurs also, though generally speaking only in moderate abund-
ance, in a transparent crystallized state, and in coloured varieties fine
Rockerystai. enough to be cut for jewellery. Thus we have: Rock Crystal ,
in fine crystals, occasionally 6 to 8 inches in length and 3 to 4 inches in
thickness, embedded in red clay, in the Blacksmiths? Gully Reef, Fryers-
town. Some of the crystals found are rich in rare planes ; others show
the prism, surmounted by a rhombohedron, and the generality, though
perfect all round, are developed in a peculiarly unsymmetric manner.
(Figs. 40-53.)
Curved and twin-like crystals are also frequent, and several have been
found with filamental tufts of chlorite in the centre. In the quartz of
Dunolly, Sandhurst (Alabama Company), and Inglewood, druses of
rock crystal of superior size and brightness are not uncommon. Fine
crystals occur also in the reefs of Woodspoint and Raspberry Creek, and in
Blacksand Creek, Beechworth. Cavities, with groups of small, colourless
crystals, may, perhaps, be found in all quartz reefs.
Pebbles of rock crystal, though seldom of sufficient size to make them
valuable, are frequently found in the older and newer pliocene gold drifts
of most of the goldfields, more particularly Beechworth, Tarrangower,
Guildford, Avoca, White Hills (Bendigo), &c.
smoky Smoky Topaz and Cairngorm. ?Occur at Beechworth, Tarrangower, the
Cairngorm. Upper Yarra, &c., especially in quartz veins traversing the granite; also,
as pebbles, often several inches in diameter, in the drifts, wholly or partly
derived from such veins: the driftsfof the Beechworth creeks, Blacksand
Creek, &c., and that of the Bradford lead, Tarrangower, deserving special
notice.
Amethyst. ?ls met with in small, perfect crystals (double hexagonal
pyramid, with prism), sometimes of very fine colour and great brightness,
at Sebastopol and El-Dorado, Beechworth, partly in the drift, partly in
narrow veins, traversing the granitic rock bottom. It also occurs in
tolerable abundance in the drifts of the Bradford lead, Tarrangower : the
light colour of specimens from this locality being often of such a character
as to make the designation Rose Quartz more applicable.
Prase. ?This variety is of rather rare occurrence, being sparingly met
with in Lady Gully Reef, Castlemaine, and in some of the reefs near
Heathcote, and those specimens which have been found possess no points
to render them of any value for the lapidary.
CHALCEDONIC VARIETIES.
Chaicedonic . Chalcedony. ? ls tolerably frequent, as mammillary coatings of cavities
varieties; in the basalt, near Keilor and Sunbury. Nodules and pebbles
ace ony. are f oun( j j n g rea t abundance along the shore of Phillip Island,
derived from veins in the older basalt of that locality. The generality
of the specimens are of bluish-white colour, with fine, opaque
white seams, which consist of carbonate of lime. Pebbles of chal-
cedony are also frequent in the drifts of the Beechworth creeks,


and fine specimens have been found at Landsborough. Some fine
geodes of chalcedony have been brought by the late Mr. M?Millan
from the Moroka Valley, Gippsland. Cut in halves, they all present
a pentagonal shape, and exhibit partly concentric alternating striae,
partly irregular mixtures of pale-bluish and opaque white
chalcedony, each of the angles of the pentagon having apparently served as
channels of infiltration for the siliceous water. In Spring Creek, Beech-
worth, a very interesting discovery was made some time ago by Mr. Dunn,
in a vein of felspathic clay traversing granite, and overlain by auriferous
drift. The whole of this clay vein is interspersed with thin, glass-like
plates, scales, angular chips, and numerous unsymmetric, sharp, angular
polyhedrons (? pseudo-crystals ?) of light yellow to dark brownish-red
chalcedony (carnelian 1) A great number of these pseudo-crystals, which
are mostly hollow, contain fluid and air-bubbles in the cavity ; the size of
the bubbles varies from a pin?s-head to that of a bean, and that of the
crystals from a quarter of an inch to three inches cubic. Several specimens
have been found containing each two, and some three fluid cavities, with
air-bubbles ; others, with sharp knife-like edges all round, yet hardly one-
eighth of an inch thick in the centre, show each a large bubble, traversing a
cavity, occupying nearly two-thirds of the length and breadth of the speci-
men. In most of the specimens the inner walls of the cavities are coated with
small quartz crystals, in the others they are quite smooth, and it is clearly
observable that the air-bubbles of these latter travel far slower than those
of the former?a circumstance which might point to the probability of the
fluid in the smooth cavities being still strongly charged with ? silicic acid,?
which in the others has crystallized out. The fluid of one of the stones
with lively air-bubble ? i.e., with quartz crystals inside ?on being subjected
to evaporation by Mr. George Foord, produced a hardly-perceptible deposit
of fine radiating crystals, resembling those of chloride of magnesium. "
Carnelian. ?Occurs sparingly as small pebbles in the drifts of the Beech- cameiian.
worth creeks, the Yarra basin, and several parts of Gippsland, also in the
drifts of the Murray river, near Woodonga.
Agate. ?This stone is very frequent in the localities just mentioned, Agate,
especially at the Woolshed, Sebastopol, and El Dorado, Beechworth.
Specimens of fine size, colour, and pattern are very often found ; banded
varieties, the bands arranged in the peculiar zig-zag shape, ?Fortification
Agate,? as also ?Landscape,? and ? Moss Agate,? being not rare amongst
them. The Cape Otway coast has also furnished some very fine agates.
Catseye, Onyx, and Sardonyx. ? Have been reported from Beechworth catseye,
and the Yarra basin, but seem to be very scarce, sardony
Flint . ?Is found abundantly scattered through the sands along the Cape Flint.
Otway and Warrnambool coast-line, probably derived from tertiary for-
mations.
Silicijied Wood. ?Occurs abundantly in large blocks on the Barrabool Hills smcifled
and the banks of the River Barwon, near Geelong, on the Sutherland?s Wood ?
Creek, near Maude, and in many places of the Bacchus Marsh district, also
in several localities in Gippsland.
* It is a curious fact that the chalcedony of these ?Water Stones? has a
hardness above 8, as the sharp edges scratch topaz easily.


JASPERY VARIETIES.

Lydian- Lydianstone, Touchstone. ? Occurs very frequently in the drifts of the
Touchstone Beechworth creeks, also in the pebble deposit near the mouth of the River
? Gellibrand, Cape Otway coast. Narrow veins in the silurian rocks occur
in the neighbourhood of dioritic greenstone near Wickliffe; also, it is said, at
Joyce?s Creek, near Newstead. Specimens from Beechworth have been
tested by jewellers and pronounced to be of superior quality as ? Touch-
stones.?
OPAL VARIETIES.
Opal. Opal. ?With the exception of the ? precious opal,? reported by Dr.
Bleasdale to occur at Beechworth, all the other varieties of this mineral
Hyalite. are of frequent occurrence. Thus, Hyalite is very common in beautiful
drop-like incrustations of cavities in the basalt near Kyneton, Malmsbury,
Semi-opal Gisborne, Baringhup, and many other localities. Semi-opal occurs in
large nodular masses of a brownish, greyish, or greenish colour, in the basalt
Opal-jasper, near Melbourne, Bacchus Marsh, Gisborne, Keilor, &c. Opal-jaspar is
met with in the basalt near Melbourne, and Riddell?s Creek. Not so
Wood-opal, abundant as the former. Wood-opal occurs in large pieces in the Bass
River, Western Port; in the Grampians, and in the pliocene gold drifts
of several of the leads at Daylesford, Ballarat, &c.
CARBONATES, SULPHATES, PHOSPHATES, CHLORIDES.
Calcite; Calcite, Calcspar (Carbonate of Lime). ?This mineral, so frequent in
Carbonate other mining countries, is very rare in the goldfields of Victoria. In the
olLime. Lennox Reef, Tarrangower, it occurs with the auriferous quartz in druses
of obtuse light-yellow rhombohedrons, frequently dotted over with small
cubes of iron pyrites. Specimens are also met with showing at the obtuse
apex of every rhombohedron a small indentation, occupied by either a
single, or more frequently a group of minute crystals of the latter mineral.
Fine clear crystals of calcite (scalenohedron, with two rhombohedrons,
Fig. 54) are found associated with chahazite in the basalt from the shaft
near Degraves?s mill, Malmsbury ; and, though more sparingly, druses of
deep-yellow, very acute rhombohedrons ?Dogtooth Spar. Small crystals,
perfect all round, composed of an acute scalenohedron, terminated by a
rhombohedron (Fig. 55), are also sometimes found embedded in a bluish-
green soapy clay in the basalt of this locality. Fine rhombohedrons of a rose-
red colour, and in the angles closely approaching the main or cleavage rhom-
bohedron, occur in the amygdaloidal basalt of Phillip Island, associated with,
or often covering analcime and natrolite; sometimes acicular crystals of
the latter are found capped by a calcite rhombohedron. In cakes of
freshwater limestone in the Muckleford Creek, near Newstead, small saddle-
shaped rhombohedrons of calcite are found associated with acicular crystals

of ?arragonite.? Narrow, irregular veins of white calcite are common,
associated with the carbonaceous strata of the Barrabool Hills, Cape Otway,
Western Port, and Traralgon. At Geelong they occur in the conglomerate
drift beds which are interstratified with the carbonaceous rocks of .the
Barrabool Hills, near Geelong, and appear in fine sections along the banks
of the River Barwon.
Marble. ?Large nodular masses of ?marble,? up to several tons in weight* Marble<
and of tolerably good quality, closely resembling superior ?Sienna marble,? are
found embedded in newer pliocene calcareous clays between high and low water
mark of Corio Bay, Geelong. The ill-success of a company some time
ago formed to work this marble was mainly due to the sparingly scattered
manner in which the blocks occur, the promoters of the company having
no doubt supposed it to exist in beds. A very handsome marble occurs at
Yering in the upper Silurian ; there is a cave existing in it 120 feet
in depth. A kind of shell-marble is also found in the miocene tertiary
near Maude.
Common Limestone , Marl , <Scc. ?Compose extensive beds in the tertiaries common
near Geelong, Cape Otway, Point Nepean, &c.; also in the upper Silurian at limestone,
Buchan and Bindi, East Gippsland; near Mansfield on the Devil?s River, &c.
As ? freshwater limestone? it occurs as beds near Geelong (Duck Ponds,
Lime-burners? or Galena Point, &c.), and near Bacchus Marsh; also in
irregular cakes, often several feet in thickness, along the Limestone Creek
near Mount Franklin, the Muckleford Creek near Newstead, at several
places in the Charlotte plains, and the Murray river basin, &c. Nodular
concretions, often many pounds in weight, occur generally in great abun-
dance in basaltic detritus, especially in the brownish tough clays along
basalt escarpments. At the Mia Mia and Sandy Creek, Tarrangower, it
forms at several points the cementing medium of the gold drift, and
contains occasionally alluvial gold embedded. Limestone suitable for
hydraulic mortar (?hydraulic limestone?) occurs at Mansfield, and Hydraulic
nodules of this kind (?septaria?) are abundant in the lower miocene and Limestone,
upper eocene tertiary beds of the Geelong and Schnapperpoint districts. The
following are results of analyses by Messrs. Wood, Daintree, and Newbery
of limestones from several of the localities above mentioned :

11. Yellow limestone, from Barwon Heads.
111. Limestone, from cliffs at Curdie?s Inlet; white granular powder. A little soda was dis-
solved on boiling with water, due, perhaps, to the spray of the waves breaking on the cliffs.

IV. Siliceous limestone, from Fenwick?s Gully, on the Queenscliff road. Forms the typical
rock of the upper miocene series.

V. Sample of hydraulic limestone, from near Mansfield; forms, according to experiments, a
fine hydraulic cement.
VI. Septarian limestone, from Schnapperpoint; forms a moderately good hydraulic cement.
