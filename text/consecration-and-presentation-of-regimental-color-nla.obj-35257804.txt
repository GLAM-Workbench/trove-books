The Consecration Service.
Brightly gleams our banner.
Pointing to the sky,
Cheering toilworn soldiers
On to victory.
Ready for the warfare,
Gladly thus we pray,
And with hearts united,
Take our onward way.
Brightly gleams our banner,
Pointing to the sky,
Cheering toilworn soldiers
On to victory.
All our days direct us
In the way we go,
Lead us on victorious
Over every foe.
Bid thine angels shield us
When the storm clouds low’r,
Pardon, Lord, and save us
In the last dread hour.
Brightly gleams our banner,
Pointing to the sky.
Cheering toilworn soldiers
On to victory.
Amen.
Then shall the Chaplain say:
The Lord’s Prayer. Amen.
Almighty and everlasting God, we are taught by
Thy Holy Word that the hearts of Kings are in Thy rule
and governance, and that Thou dost dispose and turn
them as it seemeth best to Thy Godly wisdom. We
humbly beseech Thee so to dispose and govern the heart
of GEORGE Thy servant, our King and Governor, that
in all his thoughts, words and works he may ever seek
Thy honour and glory, and study to preserve Thy people
committed to his charge, in wealth, peace and godliness.
Grant this, O merciful Father, for Thy dear Son's sake,
Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.
CONSECRATION.
Then shall the Chaplain lay his hands upon the Colours,
and say: —
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
Holy Ghost, we do dedicate and set apart these Colours,
that they may be a sign of our duty towards our King and
Country in the sight of God. Amen.


PRAYER.
O Lord, Who rulest over all things, accept, we be-
seech Thee, our service this day. Bless what we have
blessed in Thy Name. Let Thy gracious favour rest on
those who shall follow the Colours now committed to
their trust. Give them courage, and may their courage
ever rest on their sure confidence in Thee. May they show
self control in the hour of success, patience in the time
of adversity, and may their honour lie in seeking the
honour and glory of Thy great Name. May they walk
worthily in the vocation to which they are called, in
dependence on Thy blessed will, and mindful that with-
out Thee they can do nothing. Guide the councils of
those who shall lead them, and sustain them by help in
the time of need. Grant that they may all serve Thee
faithfully in this life, that they fail not finally to obtain
an entrance into Thy Heavenly Kingdom through the
merits of Thy blessed son, JESUS CHRIST, our Lord.
Amen.
BENEDICTION.
The blessing of God Almighty, the Father, the Son,
and the Holy Ghost, be amongst you and remain with
you always. Amen.

Ist BATTALION A.M.F.
(“The East Sydney Regiment”)
FIRST SINCE 1854.
Affiliated with the Royal Welsh Fusiliers.
Brief War and Peace History of
the Regiment.
(NEW SOUTH WALES TROOPS)
In 1854 the Regiment was first formed and was
called the Ist Sydney Battalion Volunteer Rifles. It con-
sisted of Companies raised in the different suburbs of
Sydney. Some little time later the 2nd Battalion Volun-
teer Rifles was formed from the South Sydney Companies.
The uniform was a dark rifle green, frock coat with
black velvet facings, trousers of rifle green with a black
cloth braid stripe, forage cap to match with the figure 1
and a bugle in front.
By a coincidence the colour patches of the Ist Batta-
lion A.1.F., which are carried by the present Ist Battalion,
are BLACK and GREEN.
Some years later the two units were converted into
Militia and re-named the Ist and 2nd Australian Infantry
Regiments: the strength was increased and country com-
panies added. For a period each regiment consisted of
10 strong companies (the pay was then 10/- per diem
for privates), but were afterwards reduced to what became
the standard establishment of eight companies—four com-
panies each at headquarters (the present hall), and four
in the country districts. “Primus Agate Primas’’ was
adopted as the Ist Regiment’s motto, and “Numero
Secundus Virtute Secundus Nulli” as the 2nd Regiment’s
motto.
The uniform was good and issued on a liberal scale,
each man having a scarlet full dress with white helmet,
a drill serge uniform with regimental colour facings; also


cotton drill uniform for summer wear, side hat, and cap
for night wear.
The facings of the Ist Regiment were royal blue,
and the 2nd Regiment lincoln green (the present infantry
colour).
A private’s pay was at the rate of 8/- per diem at
this period.
(COMMONWEATH TROOPS)
After the inauguration of the Commonwealth the
numbers of districts were organised on a territorial basis,
starting from Queensland. . The Ist A.I.R. became the
21st Infantry Regiment (Woollahra Infantry) ; the 2nd
A.I.R. became the 24th Infantry Regiment (East Sydney
Regiment). The two of them formed with their different
companies, two divisions of troops under the present
organisation. The scarlet and regimental facings were
abolished and the new Commonwealth uniform taken
into use.
In 1912 the first trainees were taken into the Regi-
ments and proceeded to camp. They were of a good type
and keen.
This was the position of the Regiments at the out-
break of the Great War.
During the War period the 26th Infantry Regiment
was absorbed by the 24th, and after the A.I.F. had
immortalised itself it was decided to retain and carry on
the traditions of the A.I.F. Regiments and adopt their
regimental system and territorial Districts, each area form-
ing one Regiment with a number of Battalions according
to strength, the veterans of the A.I.F. to form the Ist
Battalion, the 2nd Battalion being the active Battalion.
The 24th Infantry became the 2nd/Ist Battalion, the
21st Infantry the sth/Ist Battalion.
On the reduction of the forces in consequence of
the peace proposals, the strength of Regiments was reduced
to one Battalion per area, and the abovenamed Regiments
were combined and formed into the Ist Battalion, carry-
ing the honours and traditions of the old Ist and 2nd


Regiments, 26th Regiment, and greatest of all, those of
the Ist Battalion A.1.F., which was one of the original
1914 Battalions forming the famous Ist Australian Divi-
sion, and served with distinction in Egypt, Gallipoli,
France and Belgium.
Amongst the many honours gained by this Battalion
were three VICTORIA CROSSES, as follows:
Cpl. G. J. HOWELL. V.C., M.M.
Private (afterwards Lieut.) L. KEYSOR, V.C.
Captain A. J. SHOUT, V.C., M.C., whose record
of winning the two decorations between the
Landing at Gallipoli and the Battle of Lone
Pine (where he was killed) was outstanding.
Over 100 Officers of the old Regiments served in the
war, as follows;—24th Regt. 44, 26th Regt. 31, and
21st Regt. 29—making a total of 104, five of whom were
• Generals. Brigadier Gen. McLaurin (original Brigadier,
Ist Brigade A.1.F.) was killed at Gallipoli: and Major
General W. Holmes, D. 5.0., killed in France while com-
manding the 2nd Australian Division A.I.F.
Lieut. Colonel McConaghy. C.M.G., D. 5.0., a
popular officer of the 24th Infantry Regiment, was also
killed while temporarily commanding a brigade in France
in 1918.
The response from the rank and file was good, but
no totals are available excepting the fine record of the
signallers, 24th Infantry Regiment. Twenty-one out of
a total of 25 served abroad: of the four remaining, two
were medically unfit.
Members of old regiments served in the New Zealand,
China, Soudan and South African Wars. Of the four
scarfs knitted by H.M. Queen Victoria and presented to
the British forces in the South African War. two were
won by members of the Regiment, as follows:—Private
(afterwards Lieut.) Dufreyer, Ist Regt., and Private
(afterwards Lieut.) Duprez, 2nd Regt. Major Watson,
Ist Regt. (afterwards Colonel), C.M.G., D. 5.0., V.D.,
was the officer selected to carry the white flag into Pretoria
and demand its surrender.


The old Regimental Colours of the Ist and 2nd
Regiments carry the Honours —SUAKIM 1885, SOUTH
AFRICA 1899-1902.
It is expected that the following honours for the
Great War will be approved:—GALLIPOLI THE
LANDING AT ANZAC. THE DEFENCE OF ANZAC,
THE BATTLE OF SARI BAIR. FRANCE—THE
BATTLE OF POZIERES RIDGE, Third Battle of the
Scarpe, 1917, Battle of the Ancre, 1916, BATTLE OF
BULLECOURT, SECOND BATTLE OF PAASCHEN-
DALE. BATTLE OF BROODSEINDE, BATTLE OF
HAZLEBROOK, Kemmell Ridge, BATTLE OF
AMIENS, Battle of Albert, BATTLE OF EPEHY.
Those in capital letters will be carried on the new
Regimental Colours.
The first colours were presented to the Regiment by
Lady Young on behalf of the ladies of Sydney in 1861
(at present framed and hung in the Drill Hall). In 1905
a set of Regimental Colours was presented to the Ist
Regiment by Lord Northcote on behalf of the ladies of
Sydney. In 1907 a set was presented to the 2nd Regi-
ment by its Hon. Colonel, Admiral Sir Harry Rawson,
Goyernor of N.S.W. These Colours were taken over
by the Ist Battalion, the 2nd Regiment’s Colours being
placed in St. Andrew’s Cathedral, Sydney, on Sunday,
15th August, 1926. The Ist Regiment Colours will be
placed there on ANZAC SUNDAY, April 24th, 1927.
One of the two Regimental Colours presented by
the Australian ladies in England during the Great War,
to the Ist Battalion A.1.F., and carried by them in France
and Belgium, is hung in the Regimental Drill Hall.
H.M. King Edward VII. presented a bannerette to
the Ist and 2nd Regiments for their services in the South
African War. These will be placed with the Colours of
the two Regiments.
One of the many field guns captured by the Ist
Battalion in France is placed in the grounds of the Drill
Hall.
The COLONEL-IN-CHIEF of the Battalion is
COLONEL H.R.H. The PRINCE OF WALES AND


DUKE OF CORNWALL, K.G., K.T., P.C., G.C S I
G.C.M.G., G.C.1.E., G.C.V.0., G.8.E., M.C
HONORARY COLONEL Major General Sir
T. W. GLASGOW, K.C.8., C.M.G., D. 5.0., V.D.,
M.P., who commanded the Ist Australian Division in
France and Belgium.
Amongst the distinguished Hon. Colonels of the
Regiment were the late Lord Northcote, Governor-General
of Australia, and the late Admiral Sir Harry Rawson,
Governor of New South Wales.
The shooting records of the Battalion are of a high
standard. The following are some of the trophies won
by the Regiment:—GOVEßNOß’S CUP, RAWSON
CUP, ANDERSON TROPHY, THE CHAMPION
TEAM CUP. THE KNIGHT CHALLENGE
TROPHY, THE KING’S AND QUEEN’S PRIZES.
The first Queen’s Prize was won by the Regiment as far
back as 1881.
The responsibility of carrying on the traditions and
high standard of efficiency of the Battalion is a heavy one
and calls for a united effort on the part of all ranks.

Appreciation.
Liverpool, 27/2/’27.
On behalf of the officers, non-commissioned officers
and men of the Ist Battalion, The East Sydney Regiment,
I have great pleasure in taking this opportunity of thank-
ing very sincerely the ladies and all friends of the Regiment
who by their interest and endeavours have made possible
the presentation of the Regimental Colour to-day.
This Colour will carry in its folds all the memories
and traditions that long years of service have given to
Australia’s oldest Regiment, and greater than all the glories
and honours of the famous Ist Battalion A.I.F. won
during the greatest war in history. Tetl selected battle
honours from the Great War are being placed on the
Colour in addition to the honours already carried.
We appreciate your interest very much, ladies and
gentlemen, and consider that it has been a means of stimu-
lating all ranks of the Regiment to greater efforts in fitting
themselves for the defence of our country.


Please accept our hearty thanks for your interest and
the excellent results attained. do hope your interest
will continue, as it must result in benefit to the service
to which we are proud to belong.
We are indeed pleased to have you with us to-day,
and trust that we may have the pleasure of your com-
pany at our different regimental functions in the future.
Sincerely yours,
G. G. McDONALD,
Lt.-Colonel.
