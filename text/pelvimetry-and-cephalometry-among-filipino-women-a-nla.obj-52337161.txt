PELVIMETRY AND CEPHALOMETRY AMONG FILIPINO
WOMEN AND NEWBORN BABIES
MADE ON ONE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED THIRTY-SEVEN CASES¹
By HONORIA ACOSTA-SISON and FERNANDO CALDERON
(From the Department of Obstetrics, University of the Philippines)
FIVE TEXT FIGURES
This paper is a continuation of the preliminary work which
was presented before this Assembly in 1914, J Our object is to
study in further detail and in a much greater number of cases the
normal Filipino pelvis, its difference from the pelvis of the white
woman, and its efficiency in obstetrics. In this paper we have
increased our investigations. We have determined the available
Space in the posterior triangle of the pelvic outlet and studied
its importance in effective delivery in cases where there is short-
ening of the intertuberal diameter. Moreover, the size of the
full-term newborn child’s head, the length of labor, the length
of the second stage, and the influence of the weight of the baby
and its position on the final outcome of parturition have also been
observed.
MATERIAL
Our studies have been made on one thousand two hundred
thirty-seven cases of the free obstetrical department of the Phil-
ippine General Hospital. For the purpose of investigating the
effect of parity on the length of labor and size of the child,
the data of the multiparse were separated from those of the
primiparse. To obviate any error which might exist in the meas-
urements taken by different persons, one of us (H, A. S.)

exclusively made all the measurements with the exception of
those of the diagonal conjugate, which were determined bjpDoc-
tor Calderon.
METHOD OP MEASUREMENT
The spines, the crests, and Baudelocque’s diameter were meas-
ured from two different points. One is on the outside of the
bone, which is the method practiced by most obstetricians; the
data obtained from these measurements are the figures used in
comparing these diameters with those of other nationalities.
The other point is in-the inner boundary of the bone: namely,
in the spines, the inner part of the anterosuperior spines; in the
crests, the inner border of the ilium; and in the Baudelocque’s
diameter, the upper border of the symphysis.
The diagonal conjugate ha(J been determined in two ways.
One way, which is the method practiced by most investigators
on living subjects, is the introduction of the fore and middle
fingers into the vagina, reaching thereby the promontory of the
sacrum. For one who has a small hand and short fingers, this
method is impracticable; so, in the absence of Doctor Calderon,
another means had to be thought of that could give just as good,
if not better, results. An ordinary uterine sound is bent slightly
near its tip to make it correspond with the natural curve of the
pelvic canal. With the whole gloved and lubricated right hand
in the vagina, the left hand introduces the uterine sound, whose
tip is guided by the internal hand to the promontory where it
is kept in firm position, while the external hand determines the
level on the sound of the lower border of the symphysis pubis.
The firmness of the sound and its freedom from any movement
that the examining hand may have after the important points
have been determined jnake this method, we believe, give more
accurate results. For, one who has a small, short hand, this
method is of special advantage, for it is easily done and causes
relatively less discomfort to the patient.
In the 1917 edition of his text book on obstetrics, Williams
has quoted one of us (H. A. S.) as stating that the Filipino pelvis
corresponds most closely to that of the American Negress. Since
the writer made no such statement, "it seems probable that Wil-
liams arrived at such a conclusion by comparing the Filipino
measurements given by the writer with the Negro measurements
reported by Riggs.
While admitting that the measurements given by the writer
do correspond in a superficial way with those of the Negress, a
closer study shows certain important differences. Such study

also shows that the published pelvic measurements most closely
corresponding to the Filipino average are not those of the Ne-
gress, but those of the average contracted pelvis among white
Americans (see Table II).
Here the authors wish to open a new line of investigation
by asking a question. Eliminating the varieties of pelves caused
by injuries or disease such as rickets, osteomalacia, etc., is it
not possible that this average contracted pelvis among white
Americans represents not an abnormality, but rather the normal
pelvis of the southern European element in the composite Amer-
ican population? The great majority of native-born Americans
are of northern European stock, and the southern European
element would appear as a minor, or abnormal, type. The great
difference between the average Negro pelvis of Riggs and that
of the average white American is at once apparent upon the most
casual comparison of their measurements. Is it not most natural
to suppose, then, that the Asiatic races would present a type or
types of pelvis different from both that of the Negro and that of
the average white American ? It seems to the writers that there
is room here for much fruitful investigation.
Anthropologists have discovered that the publication of
average measurements is the surest way of concealing rather
than of demonstrating racial types. T his is particularly true
where the people measured are unquestionably of mixed race.

The easiest method of
bringing out the mixture
of types is by plotting
measurements in a
graphic way, so that the
resulting curve will show
the proportion or per-
centage of individual
cases of any and all
particular types. The
measurements of the one
thousand two hundred
thirty-seven pelves on
which the present paper
is based have been plot-
ted in such graphic
curves. For the whole
number of cases the
curves for each measure-
ment are shown in figs.
1 to 5.
This investigation has
shown that we are able
to isolate three major,
and two minor, types of
Philippine pelvis, as has
just been demonstrated.
To associate any of these
types of pelvis with par-
ticular racial varieties
of man would be folly in
the present state of our
knowledge (or rather
ignorance) of the other
races of Oriental peoples,
who surround the Philip-
pines.
Anthropologists be-
lieve that the different
racial types of India,
China, Japan, Polynesia,
and Melanesia—in addi-
tion to the late Spanish

mixture from Europe—have all influenced our composite pop-
ulation. If it were possible to compare the measurements
made in our investigation with the considerable series of others
from all the different, racial types just mentioned, we might
hope to arrive at certain tentative conclusions. However, since
practically no pelvic measurements from the regions mentioned

have -been published, the correlation of Philippine types with
those of other oriental peoples must await the results of further
investigations.®
On examining Table 111, we find that the diagonal conjugates
measuring from 11 centimeters to 12.4 centimeters have the
greatest number of cases (which form 85 per cent of the total
ough unable to draw conclusions from our pelvic measurements, it
may be proper to state here that anthropologists have demonstrated from
other sources that the predominant Philippine racial types are two: First,
a type known as the Indonesian, which came into the Islands from the
south and is related to the races of India; and, second, a Mongol-Chinese
type, which came into the Islands chiefly from the north. The so-called
Flll ? 1 . n ° S ° f to ' day are essentially a mixture of these two types,
with the addition of certain minor elements. The most important of the
latter is a type represented by immigrants from .Melanesia. Other minor
types are of course the historical immigrations of Chinese and of" Spanish
Europeans. It is possible, then, that our five pelvic types correspond to
these racial elements; though for the present such a conclusion must be
regarded as mere speculation. (For discussions of Philippine racial types,
see Beyer, Cole, Bean, Koeze, Keane, Montano, and Virchow.)

number) and the greatest percentage of spontaneous labor.
From this it may be inferred that measurements within these
figures represent the normal, Filipino diagonal conjugate. The
curve, fig. 5, shows that most of the cases have diagonal conju-
gates of, respectively, 11, 11.5, and 12 centimeters.

one is
Comparing Table IV with Table 111 on the multiparse, one is
struck with the apparently greater percentage of spontaneous la-
bor in primiparse. The cause of this is that in primiparous cases,
our procedure has been to let nature do all it can before instru-
mental intervention so as to allow sufficient molding of the head.
Moreover, many of the operative cases in primiparse are not
shown here for the reason that we made all of our measurements
during the puerperium, and in order to avoid infection and
relaceration of the repaired wounds, a regrettable occurrence in
many of our earlier cases, we refrained from measuring the
diagonal conjugate in patients who had been delivered instru-
mentally.
It is interesting to note, however, that the number of cases
whose diagonal conjugate measures between 11 and 12.4 centi-
meters forms 87 per cent, which is a slightly greater proportion
than that of the corresponding measurements in the multiparas.
PELVIC OUTLET
An effort was first made to determine the relationship of the
intertuberal diameter and the length of the second stage of labor,
but the results soon demonstrated that this measurement when
considered alone is of little significance. In cases of contracted
intertuberal diameter where a prolonged second stage was ex-
pected it was found that, though the baby was not undersized,
oftentimes the duration of the second stage' was even shorter
than the average normal. In these cases the posterior sagittal

diameter had a compensatory lengthening, so that the index of
the posterior plane of the pelvic outlet was either normal or larger
than normal.' This confirms the view of Williams, Daniels, and
others, that a contracted intertuberal diameter does not neces-
sarily mean a prolonged or operative labor so long as there is a
corresponding lengthening of the posterior sagittal diameter.
Williams has stated that a spontaneous labor is exceptional
with the following measurements (head, average size):
but that, with these measurements, a safe delivery through the
accustomed channel may be effected by instrumental means.
Daniels, however, basing his calculations on the average normal
measurements reported by Klein—namely, intertuberal diameter,
11 centimeters; posterior sagittal, 9.95 or. 10 (Daniels uses 10
instead of 9.95) —has established the following rule: That the
index of the posterior plane of the pelvic outlet in normal cases
should be 55, as in the following equation:
Intertuberal diameter (11) X posterior sagittal (10)
5 v -~ == 55.0
01
Intertuberal diameter X x
■ =55.
2
This index, according to Daniels, may be as low as 33.3 and
no operation needed but perhaps the use of forceps.
Following the formula of Daniels, we find that in Filipino
women, the normal index of the posterior plane of the pelvic
outlet is much lower than what he considers to be normal for
American women. It is
11 X 8.5
=46.75 or 46.8;
and an index as low as 31 may end intspontaneous delivery.

cipito-bregmatic diameters whereas the mento-occipital dia-
meter is almost the same in both cases.
The figures in Table VIII are self-explanatory. As in other
nationalities, the multiparse have a shorter duration of labor,
and longer and heavier babies than those of the primiparse;
also, the female babies are smaller than the male. The influence
on the birth weight of the baby of a week’s sojourn in the hos-
pital before confinement is here well shown. The difference in
the average birth weight of the babies whose mothers stayed
one week or more in the hospital before parturition and those
whose mothers entered the hospital on the day of, or a few days-
before, confinement is 189.35 grams in favor of the former.
From Table IX it is 'evident that, as in women of other coun-
tries, the duration of labor and of the second stage in anterior
vertex presentations is shorter than in the posterior or trans-
verse vertex presentations. Moreover, the length of labor in
left occipito-anterior position is shorter than the duration of nor-
mal labor as taught in most American obstetrical text-books.
The data in Table X indicate that the frequency of the dif-
ferent foetal presentations is much the same as in other coun-
tries; only that, in vertex presentations, there is a relatively
high percentage of those which occur in the left, those occurring
in the right being correspondingly diminished.

rical department of the Philippine General Hospital and one
other similar operation performed at another hospital (Roxas)
are not included in .this report, for only those cases whose babies
were born alive per vaginam were measured. Moreover, in all
Cesarean sections made on Filipino women, only on two occa-
sions was the disproportion of pelvis and child the indication.
One was a case of a primipara whose baby had an enormously
large hydrocephalic head whose mento-occipital diameter mea-
sured 19 centimeters; and the other, a. case of osteomalacia
(Roxas). The rarity of instances in which pelvic contraction,
other than that caused by osteomalacia (which was found only
once), can be an indication to Cesarean section is emphasized by
the fact that of the twenty-seven Cesarean sections performed in
the Philippine General Hospital prior to April, 1918 (Rusti^i),
twenty-four were performed on Filipinas for an indication (ex-
cept in the case of the primipara with a hydrocephalic foetus,
if that should be excluded) other than the disproportion between
the foetal head and the pelvis or pelvic contraction. Whereas
the only Cesarean sections performed on American private pa-
tients (three cases) were necessary on account of dystocia
caused by contracted pelvis.

CONCLUSIONS
1. The Filipino pelvis is of a type different from either the
white American or the Negro pelvis, and its average normal
measurements are similar to those of the 'generally contracted
pelvis of the white American.
2. The index of the posterior pelvic plane in cases of con-
tracted intertuberal diameter is important in the determination
of the probable outcome of labor.
3. Contracted pelvis, except in cases of osteomalacia, is rarely
an indication to Cesarean section among Filipino women.
4. There is practically no difference in the measurements of
the pelvic diameters of multiparse and primaparse,
5. The newborn babies of multiparse are'longer and heavier
than those of the primiparse.
6. The babies of mothers who stayed in the hospital for one
or more weeks before delivery are heavier than those whose
mothers entered the hospital at the time of labor.
7. The male babies are in greater number and are longer and
heavier than the female babies.
8. Labor is longer in primiparse than in multiparse.
ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
We wish to thank all the doctors and nurses of the obstetrical
staff of the Philipine General Hospital for their cordial assist-
ance in making it possible to measure the cases. We thank also
Dr. M. Tracy for her kind help, and in particular we wish to
extend our gratitude to Mr. H. O. Beyer for his valuable sugges-
tions in the interpretation of many of our findings.
