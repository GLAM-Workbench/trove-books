HYMN
No. 685.
I to the hills will lift mine eyes :
From whence doth come mine aid ?
My safety cometh from the Lord,
Who heaven and earth hath made.
The Lord Thee keeps ; the Lord Thy shade
On thy right hand doth stay ;
The moon by night thee shall not smite,
Nor yet the sun by day.
Thy foot He'll not let slide, nor will
He slumber That thee keeps.
Behold, He That keeps Israel,
He slumbers not, nor sleeps.
The Lord shall keep thy soul; He shall
Preserve thee from all ill;
Henceforth thy going out and in
God keep for ever will. Amen.
HYMN
No. 111.
The King of Love my Shepherd is,
Whose goodness faileth never ;
I nothing lack if I am His
And He is mine for ever.
In death's dark vale I fear no ill
With Thee, dear Lord, beside me,
Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
Thy cross before to guide me.
Where streams of living water flow
My ransomed soul He leadeth,
And where the verdant pastures grow
With food celestial feedeth.
Thou spread'st a table in my sight;
Thy unction grace bestoweth ;
And O what transport of delight
From Thy pure chalice floweth !
Perverse and foolish oft I strayed ;
But yet in love He sought me,
And on His shoulder gently laid,
And home rejoicing brought me.
And so, through all the length of days,
Thy goodness faileth never ;
Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise
Within Thy house forever. Amen.
HYMN No* 443*
0 God of Bethel, by Whose hand
Thy people still are fed,
Who through this weary pilgrimage
Hast all our fathers led.
Our vows, our prayers, we now present
Before Thy throne of grace ;
God of our fathers, be the God
Of their succeeding race.
Through each perplexing path of life
Our wandering footsteps guide ;
Give us each day our daily bread,
And raiment fit provide.
O spread Thy covering wings around,
Till all our wanderings cease.
And at our Father's loved abode
Our souls arrive in peace.
Such blessings from Thy gracious hand
Our humble prayers implore,
And Thou shalt be our chosen God
And portion evermore. Amen.
