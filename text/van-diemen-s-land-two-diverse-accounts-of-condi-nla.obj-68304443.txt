that a cask of that description would be taken there,

Lawrence and Joseph Madden in the yard. On forcing
open the cask, it was found to contain the dead bodies
of two men and a woman. Madden and Lawrence,
after undergoing a long examination at the Guildhall
before the mayor and magistrates, were committed for
trial at the next assizes for this county. Madden is an
old offender, and was connected with the notorious

Silk in Bavaria ?Above 2.000,000 of sapling
mulberry-trees are thriving in Bavaria. A full-grown
tree yields 1001b. of leaves, but only one-half is gathered
in a season ; so that the proprietors of these nurseries;
if all the trees attain to maturity, will glean a million
of trees annually. The worms from a pound of eggs,
when properly fed, consume half a ton of leaves, and
yield at least 501b. of cocoons, or olb. of wound silk.
The product of these 2,000,000 of trees, if nothing
hinder their prospering, will therefore amount to
500.0001b. weight of silk, in value from 500,0001. to
1,000,0001. annually.? Foreign Literary Gazette.

The gentleman kept his appointment, and was accosted

should go to an inn together. The gentleman consented,
and, having entered a private room, they both sat down
to a table, when the stranger presented his new friend
with sixty pounds, which he said was his property. The
gentleman refused to take it without an explanation, but
the stranger then presented him with sixty pounds mr re,
and said that w'as also due to him, as interest of the
money (simple and compound) during the time he had
held his property. He afterwards gave the following
explanation:?? More than twenty years a?o you had
an uncle whose property you now possess; his age and
infirmities rendered it requisite for him to have a house-
keeper to manage his affairs. My sister was thnt house-
keeper. Some lime after his death sh� found sixty
pounds folded up in one of her trunks, which she be-
lieved to have belonged to him at the time of his death.
She sent for me, gave it in*o my hands, and requested
that I would restore it to you as the lawful heir of her
master?s property. This I promised to do, but, being
embarrassed in my circumstances at the time, I made
use of it for my own purposes Years have passed away,
and 1 have prospered in business until I am now able to
make the proper restitution. Ido it to the utmost, and
with pleasure, and I assure y A u that this transaction has
taken a very heavy weight from my distressed mind.?

mind which left no doubt of the stranger?s story.? York

RETAIL WINE AND SPIRIT TRADE.
On Wednesday an open meeting of the committee au-
poin ed to watch over the interests of those engaged in
the retail wine and spirit trade took place at the Queen?s
Head Tavern, Newgate-street.
After a lengthened discussion, it was resolved that the
meeting should make application to parliament on the
preca r ious state in which their trade was placed by the
contemplated measures < f the Chancellor of the Exche-
quer, to throw open the trade in beer, and the suspension
of the licenses of several spirit dealers by some- of the
magistrates lately ; not, however, as spirit dealers, but
as licensed victuallers, more particularly engaged in the
wine and spirit trade, and a resolution to that effect being
moved and carried, the meeting separated.

(prom our private correspondent.)
Yesterday, in pursuance of a requisition to the Lord
Mayor, a post assembly of the corporation was held for
the purpose of taking into consideration the general
subject of the Poor Laws, as regards the interest of

tient voice :

han has obtained from the Victualling Board a release
from the liabilities of his contract, and that he will

COURT OF CHANCERY, March IJ.
WELLESLEY V. THE DUKE OF BEAUFORT.
The Lord Chancellor on taking his seat this morn-
ing, inquired of Mr. Horne if be thought he could sub-
stantiate the prayer of this petition, which was to
strike a geatlsnjpn, who had been engaged by Mr.
Wellesley as his solicitor, off the rolls of the Court for
alleged misconduct. The petition yyas presented by
Mr. Wellesley.
~ Mr. Hprne?said that he had read all the papers,_ and
he was bound in candour to say that he was satisfied
that the answer of the defendant was satisfactory and
conclusive. , .
The Lord Chancellor then ordered the petition to be
s�3�issed with ecstf.
that of the murder of an infant child. On the inquiry
before the coroner evidence was given of its having been
still born, and a verdict was returned accordingly. It
afterwards was stated by the mother that this was not
the fact, and a second inquiry was gone into,
the result of which was the sending of three per-
sons for trial, one for the murder, and the other
two as accessories before the fact. They would
inquire diligently into the facts, and endeavour
to ascertain whether any or all of the accused
were implicated |u the murder, and the degree in
which they were implicated, and return a bill accord-
ingly. He also found three individuals stood charged
with no less than five capital offences, they would of
course attend particularly to the evidence in those
cases. There remained for him to notice another most
important case, which had already occupied a great
portion of the public attention. They would dismiss
from their minds all that they had heard and read on
the subject, and confine their attention strictly to the
evidence brought before them. There were three
persons charged, Clewss and Banks as principals, and
Barnett as an accessory to the murder of
a man named Hemming. This murder appeared to
have taken place 24 years ago. At that distance of
time, it would be extremely difficult to get at the truth.
Many persons whose evidence might be important,
were probably dead, and the recollections of others
both as to facts favorable and unfavorable to-the ac-
cused persons, had no doubt, from the long lapse of
time, become imperfect. Still it would be their duty
to investigate the case fully, and see whether there was
sufficient to warrant them in sending any or all of
the parties for trial, and if so, whether as principals
or accessories. They would also see whether there
were any circumstances in the evidence which would
lead them to believe any of the prisoners were in any
manner connected with, or privy to the murder of the
Rev. Mr. Parker, who, as far as could now be col-
lected, appeared to have been murdered by Hemming.
Bhould there be any such evidence, they would return
a bill accordingly. Having said thus much, he would
dismiss them to their labours. The learned judge then
proceeded to address the jury for the city, whom he
congratulated on the light state of their calendar.
OAKHAM, March 6.
Vesterday the commission was opened in this town
by Mr. Baron Garrow.
NEWCOMB V. DRAKARD.
Mr. Homfrey opened the pleadings. It was an ac-
tion, he said, for libel. The declaration stated that the
plaintiff was proprietor and editor of a newspaper
called the Lincoln and Stamford Mercury, and the
defendant was editor and proprietor of a paper pub-
lished in the same town, called Drakard?s News, and
it further alleged that the defendant, intending to
injure in his good name the plaintiff, pub-
lished certain scandalous libels of and concerning him
in his newspaper. The defendant pleaded the general
issue. ?>
Mr. Clarke said that the plaintiff in this case was
Mr. John Newcomb, the principal proprietor and sole
editor of a paper, called the Lincoln Mercury. He
came before a jury to-day to complain of the defend-
ant?s conduct, in publishing a series of scandalous
libels upon him. If the defendant had contented
himself with one or two attacks, however gross or
unfounded, the plaintiff would have passed them
ever in silence, but he continued week after week
repeating his attacks, and adding fresh mat-
ters of accusation against the plaintiff. The defendant
was, as thejury well knew, the proprietor of a news-
paper published at Stamford, and at the top of his paper
he told the world that it was circulated in Lincolnshire,
Northamptonshire, Leicestershire, Buckinghamshire,
Nottinghamshire, and the adjacent counties. So that,
according to the defendant?s account, through all these
counties did he circulate these libels upon the character
of the plaintiff. It apoeared that in the town of Stam-
ford there was a charity called Radcliffe?s Free Gram-
mar School, and to this charity there belonged certain
houses, and the trustees let those houses on leases of 21
years to the highest bidder. The defendant occupied
one of these houses, and an auction took place some
time since at Stamford, and this house, amongst others,
was in the usual way put tip by auction. The plain-
tiff, as he had a right to do, not wishing to see the
charity robbed, bid for these premises, and having
gone as far as he thought they were worth, they
were knocked down to the defendant, and his part-
ner, a Mr. Wilson. Next week this gentleman thought
fit to publish in his paper an account of this transac-
tion, and he attributed the plaintiff?s conduct in thus
bidding for these premises to malignity of the worst
description. (The learned counsel here read the matter
charged as libellous. It consisted principally of a his-
tory of the defeat of the plaintiff, when he became
a candidate for the Aldermanic gown at Stamford,
being, in fact, mere squibs, qf a perfectly local, and
'not very entertaining nature. It was stated in'one of
the extracts that the defendants possessed ground
enough to bury the readers of the Stamford Mercury
for twelve generations, and it was not, therefore, by
putting them to 7001* expense they were to he put
down. Another extract promised that 44 for this 7001.
Mr. Newcombe should have 700 notes from the de-
fendant, for which he would give his note of hand.?)
Here, the learned counsel contended, was a threat
that the defendant would continue his attacks upon
the plaintiff, who, after all, had done nothing to merit
such abuse of his character. He would prove to the
jury that for six months before the plaintiff ha 4
determined to give a certain sum for these
premises for his nephews, who were about to enter
into business, and it would be for the jury to say whe-
ther they would allow such conduct as the defendant
pursued to pass unpunished. He had in the grossest
way libelled the plaintiff, and he had not put a justifi-
cation on the record, so that he admitted he had spoken
<of him that which was not to be justified. He trusted,
that the jury would visit him" with such damages as
would restrain his abuse, and prevent the plaintiff
character from suffering weekly under his unmerited
and malignant censures.
The publication was admitted on the part of the de-
fendant, and the auctioneer proved that six months
the sale of the houses, Mr. Newcomb had men-
tioned to him that hp intended purchasing the premises
then held by Mr, tirakard fop his nephews, if t|iey
were let reasonably.
It was admitted that the plaintiff and defendant
were correct described, and, in fact, all the former
part of the pleadings were not disputed ; and this
closed the plaintiff?s case.
31 r. Sergeant Adams addressed the jury for the de-
fendant.
r |?he learned judge summed up the evidence to the
jury, telling them that, in his opinion, the paragraphs
contained in the very lengthy document on thp table-,
were libellous in their nature ; for they were calcu-
lated to bring the plaintiff into contempt. This, how-
ever, was merely bis opinion ; but it was not upon his
come into her room, who, addressing her by a coarse
epithet, demanded her keys, &c. She was greatly
alarmed, and the none a*oke her servant maid, who
jumped ut of bed, and attempted t� make her escape.
She was stopped, however, in the passage by one of the
men, who swore if slie did not cea c e f creaming out he
would cut her throat j upon which she called out to her
mistress to come to her assistance, as they were going to
murder her. She also called upon a man named North,
who slept in a room over the kitchen to come down, and
bring the other man with him, as there were
thieves in the h-use. The fellow who had hold of
her said, that would do them no good, as he and his com-
panions were four m number. She continued to struggle
however, and at length succeeded in breaking from the
fellow s ho.d, and getting a*ay. On going into North?s
room she found him perfectly awake, although her ap-
peals for assistance had not been successful In the
mean time, Mrs. Radsley and her daughter succeeded in
getting out of a window, and ran to some houses about a
quarter of a mile distant, and alarmed the inhabitants.
One of them, Frederick North, brother to the person of
that name above mentioned, tracked the three men in
ihe > now to within two miles of Boston, a distance of 25
miles. He continued in the pursuit the whole of that
night, and until near 8 o?clock the next morning. There
was a peculiarity in the shape of Oldham?s shoes, by
which his footsteps were identified. On the track
a mustard.spoon was found by North which had be-
longed to the prosecutrix, from whom the thieves had
also carried off some silver spoons, silk handkerchiefs,
aad other property. Another witness proved that on
that morning he met the three prisoners going into
Boston about half-past seven o?clock. They were
in consequence apprehended; and on being taken
hefore a magistrate, the prosecutrix identified
Uidham and Huggins, and the servant girl swore posi-
tively to Caborn as the man who had held her in the
passage. It had been a clear moonlight night, and
the prisoners? faces were fully exp all the time
they were in th� presence of the woman. They had
effected their entrance, it appeared, by breaking a hole
in the wall beside the <*oor, and then, one of them putting
in his arm, shot back the bolt. They were all found
guilty, and sentence of death was recorded again c t
them. *
Ihe learned judge eulogized the conduct of Fre-
derick North, to whom he ordered a reward of 51. to
be paid, under one of the provisions of Mr. Peel?s Act.
J -fin Clarke, butcher, aged 44, was convicted of steal-
ing two sheep, the property of William Poner, of
Boston.
Mr. Baron Garrow, in order to make an example,
and check the crime of sheep stealing in this part of the
country, ordered the prisoner for execution.
There were eight other prisoners convicted of sheep,
stealing, against whom sentence of?dealh was recorded.
The learned judge disposed of all the cases in the ca-
lendar to-day.
IMPORTANT DECISION.
A decision of much importance to the community at
large took place yesterday, at Mary-la-bonne office.
An individual named Cushion, who for upwards of six
years bore an unimpeached character as a beadle of St.
George?s parish, Hanover-square, has, since the new
police act, purchased a fire engine of his own, and
within the last few weeks has been active in quenching
fires at many houses. Last week two fire reward
papers were brought before Mr. Rawlinson, in which
Mr. Cushion?s was the first engine on the spot, and the
order was opposed by Morgan, a fireman belonging to
the Union office, on the ground that Cushion was in-
competent to manage an engine, aud the case was or-
dered to stand over until yesterday, when Cushion ap.
peared, attended by hjs solicitor, who informed the ma-
gistrate that he had commenced an action against
Morgan for defamation of character.
Mr. Rawlinson said it appeared somewhat singular
that Cushion should wear a handsome fireman?s jacket
and badge, he not being actually a fireman.
The solicitor begged to remind the magistrate, that
by the 14th of George 111. any person was allowed to
take an engine to a fire, and nobodv could doubt the
competency of Cushion, as he had for upwards of six
years, while in the service of St. George?s parish, been
managing an engine.
Cushion said that his badge was merely as a pro-
tection to property; it only stated the name and num-
ber of his engine, with his address. He could instantly
give 5001. security if required.
Mr. Rawlinson appeared so convinced of the legality
of Cushion?s claim that he immediately signed the
whole of the rewards.
CORONER?S INQUEST.
Wednesday Mr. Gell and a jury assembled to pursue
the investigation as to the cause o� the death of Amelia
Margaret Dawson. Michael Macloughlin. a private in
the 2d battalion of the Ist regiment of Foot Guards,
deposed that on Thursday last he met the deceased in the
street, close by her father?s house, in a most deplorable
condition. She complained of being exhausted and
hungry, without money. She sold her apros and some
duplicates, which brought her Is 3d., and requested wit-
ness to go to her father, and beg his forgiveness. He
went, but the father would not hear him, saving ? Tell
her to buy a rope and hang herself with it.? Witness,
from mot ves of delicacy, did not tell her what he said,
hut advised her to cheer up, as he was sure to forgive her.
She left witness, saying she had is., with which she
would purchase laudanum and destroy herself. He heard
no mere of her till her death* Several letters were read
to the jury, wnich indicated that the deceased had long
been unhappy in her mind, and the jury returned a
verdict, ? that she poisoned herself while in a state of
mental derangement.??The following letter from the
father was found in the pocket of the deceased :
fi Amelia, ? I am horror-struck at your conduct?l
find 1 shall be obliged to have done with you entirely;
and if you are determined to lead an abominable life
you must, for I understand you ave always after the
soldiers in the tap-room. I should have thought you
had had enough of Knutsford and soldiers?you, how-
ever, seem to have forgot all. But remember, if ever
you transgress again, I shall have done with you for ever.
1 thought you would have reformed. I shall say no
more?but depend if y..u disgrace me again, I shall
never own you more. ? Your father, ?J. D.?
An outrage and jobbery, tender circumstances of
great daring, was comirutted oh Tuesday evening last
in the open space opposite the Bethlehem Hospital, neay
the site of the intended new Fleet prison. As Mrs.
Jones, a lady residing in Wes train s ter-road, (was re-
turning to her house at Vauxhall, she was suddenly
seized by two men, wfio sprang up from behind some
mounds of rubbish. One of them placed his hand on
her rqouth to prevent her cries, while the other delibe-
rately rifled her pockets of one sovereign and several
shillings, and also stole her muff. The ruffians then
darted off in different directions, and escaped. 3lrs.
J ones, who was in infirm health, was conveyed home,
and is now seriously indisposed.
Wednesday, a young woman, passing along Leather-
lane, was knocked down by the falling of a chimney
pot. She was taken to St. Bartholomew?s Hospital,
where it was. thought she could not survive.
C. Neeld, Esq , the rgsiduapy legatee of the late 31 r.
Handle, and inheritor of the greater portion of hi� im-
mense property, took his seat last night in the Hopse of
Commons, for the borough of Qatton,

was at the time a large tire, all in a blaze, and the
brute beating the other bov most unmercifully with a
stick. The ladies being terrified, ran down stairs, and
made the circumstance known to the neighbours, and
a woman, named Divine, ran up stairs, and found the
child had been removed by the fellow, who had placed
it on a chair, wrapped in a blanket, and had absconded.
The woman carried it to Guy?s Hospital, where it was
attended to, and, in the interim, the two ladies had found
where the mother of the unfortunate child worked, and
she came running to the house (the infant haring been
brought home), and, upon seeing the state it was in,
went into a violent paroxysm of madness, using the most
awful imprecations upon her husband. The child lin-
gered in the most excruciating agony till Tuesday after-
noon, when it expired. In about three minutes after
the wretched man came home, and the moment he
heard ofthe death of the infant he staggered off, but
was subsequently apprehended, and lodged in St.
George?s watchhouse.
The little boy states that the moment the child fell
under the grate, its clothes caught fire Immediately;
he seized hold of his father?s hair, and pulled it as hard
as he was able, and, wffien he awoke, he pointed the
infant out to him, when he commenced beating him.
He afterwards took up the child, and, in its burning
state, dipped it two or three times in a pail of dirty
water, he then wrapped it in a blanket, placed it on a
chair, and ran out of the house.
Yesterday an inquest was held on the body, when,
after having heard the evidence of several witnesses
confirmatory of the above statement, the jury ex-
pressed a desire to hear what account Carey gave of the
affair. Readmitted that be was very much intoxicated
at the time, and that the accident arose in consequence
of the deceased having slipped off his knees while he
was asleep He lamented the death of his child, and
declared that he should ever feel remorse as long as he
lived for having been the unfortunate author of the
accident. The jury expressed themselves satisfied that
the child?s death had arisen from accident, and after
the coroner had given Carey a suitable admonition on
the dreadful effects of intoxication, a verdict to the
above effect wrs recorded, seven o?clock in the
evening Carey was discharged by the magistrates of
Union Hall.

SEED MARKET.
Mark-lane, March 10.?We have a very quick sale
for all descriptions of seed; and middling red clover
may be called 3s to 5s per cwt, higher,
, T me attendance or manuracturers and
dealer* from the Yorkshire,. Lancashire, and Leicester,
as well as the neighbouring markets, was rather more
numerous than usual, and a general disposition was
manifested to purchase at the prices given of late, par.
ticiuariy the finer kinds of combing and clothing wools.
1 lie present value of farmers? lots in this neighbour,
hood may be quoted from Gd to 7d per lb., and of the
s J?? lon S wool in Gloucestershire at about 18s per tod
of 281bs. r
Bridgwater fair, on Friday last, showed the
great depression of the times. The sheep were gene,
rally small and a complete drug. Fat stock low, grassers
a better price than at previous markets, yet little busi-
ness dping. 1
At Corsham fair, on Monday, the supply of fat
beasts was limited, and they met with a quick sale at
lOsa score; mutton also sold briskly at 7d a pound.
Very few good horses were exhibited, and those fetched
higher prices; indeed, prices generally appeared to be,
looking up, the fair being more numerously attended
than lor some years past.
Stockport first fair for the month was tolerably well
supplied, but more particularly with lean cattle,
which were but little in demand. A few ealving-cows
were bi-ought, and for them purchasers were readily
obtained at better prices, the average for good ones
being about 161, though, on the whole, but little
business was transacted in them. Of riding horses
there was the usual supply of indifferent ones, with
very few buyers, and the show of cart horses was not
so good as is usual at this fair.
At Truro monthly cattle market, on Wednesday
as, a good number of fat beasts were exhibited, but
tor which there appeared to be but a slack demand at
horn 42s to 48s per cwt. About 200 very fine sheep
were penned, and chiefly sold at 51 d per lb., being a
trifling advance on the prices of late obtained.
\ eovil great market, on Friday, was largely sup-
plied with both fat and lean cattle; but, owing to the
continued scarcity of money, the late prices were with
difficulty maintained. Beef may be quoted from 7s to
, ? er . ? sc . ore ? and a few P rime tots may be reckoned a
shade higher.
At Dorchester cattle market, on Saturday week,
the supply was rather limited ; and, although many of
the heifers and calves exhibited were of a superior
kind, yet the prices at which they were sold were far
below remuneration. Cows and calves averaged
about 91; one or two prime articles, however, fetched
from 111 to 121.
w 6 , , Hanvood toir.?At the fair held here on
Wednesday last, there was very little done ; indeed, it
is said to have been the w.rst March fair ever known
since its establishment, 21 years ago. There were
very few cattle shown, and only about a dozen sold.

LISBON PAPERS.
Opart#, &&? 15.�~Wc have received a letter from
Almeida, dat d the sthinst. which gives a most distressing
account of the damage done by the intense cold of this
winter. It states that oil, milk, and wine, froze even in
the houses; that the water in all kinds of vessels was
frozen into solid masses; that the wells, pond*, and
rivers, were frozen to a great depth ; that a vast number
of lambs and sheep perished ; and that the deaths, par-
ticularly among the pooref classes, were innumerable.
An immense quantity of snsw had fallen.
BRUSSELS PAPERS.
JVarsa.it:, Feb . 23.?We hear that the Russian go-
vernment is going to take against the Jesuits measures
still more powerful than those which we announced
some weeks ago. Several laymen initiated into that
order, and some of Spain and Madrid, have found their
way into the Southern provinces of Russia, especially
those near the Black Sea and Mount Caucasus; there
are many Catholic Armenians among them. The con-
versions which these gentlemen have attempted to
make among the schematic Armenians and the
Georgians, have been discovered by the Russian police
winch has ordered three of these Jesuits to be arrested
one of whom is married, and has his wife to share
his captiviry. It is not yet known what
will be their fate; and it i? affirmed, that
the Russian ministers in the several courts of Europe
have received the roost peremptory orders not to grant
passports for Russia to any person, whether a priest or
layman, who is suspected of belonging to the order of
Jesuits. It is added, that henceforward all persons con-
nected in any manner whatever with the order, who shall
? ndeavour to enter the country clandestinely, shall be
immediately arrested and sent to Beresow in Siberia,
near the Frozen Ocean. ,

VAN DIEMEN?S LAND.
In contemplating the many miseries to which huma-
nity is incident in all parts of the earth, there is none
more calculated to strike the philanthropist with horror
than the fate of the unhappy wretches who are con-
signed to the penal settlement of Macquarie Harbour,
whither the offenders against the laws of society in Van
Diemen?s Land are transported. Leniency forms no
part of the system of Macquarie Harbour, on the con-
trary, such are its rigours that it leads to desperation.
There must be some ray of hope permitted to steal into
the dungeon of the captive, otherwise his seared and
withered spirit, instead of yielding tears of contri-
tion, will give forth only the groans of despair;
and wanting the prospect of meeting mercy he
jriil make no effort to deserve it. Macquarie Harbour
congregates all the horrors most appalling to
man. Jts climate is dreadful. Fogs, rain, and cold
are perpetually aggravating the sufferings of wretches
pinched by a miserable fare, and compelled to rigorous
toil. Thither throng the clouds and storms of the
southern ocean, alternately visiting the black and dis-
mal coast with gloom and fury, banishing every ray of
that bright orb which every where else sheds some lustre
on the toils and afflictions of life. The curse of the
great Author of nature appears to have fallen without
cue mitigative circumstance on this miserable place.
Its geographical position sufficiently proclaims its cli-
mate ; iis melancholy waters, like those of the Dead
Sea, yield no fish; and the brooding spirits of desola-
tion and despair hover over a spot which appears to be
set apart from the rest of the earth, as if deserving to
possess no good thing.
The gaol is situated on an immense insu-

boats, through a stormy sea, in all weathers a dis-
tance of about seven miles, to the scene of
their labours on the main, where they work in chafhs,
gome of them double-ironed. Their toil from six in
the morning till six at night, is incessant; overseers,

exact the t( penalty of their bond.? At six in the
evening, they again take to their boats, and row hack

them. Salt provisions only, and that of an inferior
kind, is the miserable fare of the miserable convict,
and of this he is allowed but two meals a day, viz.?a
breakfast and a supper. To such lengths has the ex-
treme of misery urged the unhappy wretches, that they
have committed murder, in order to make themselves
amenable to capital punishment, and thus put a period
to their sufferings-
The following k an extract of a letter from Van
Diemen?s Land, dated 24th September last, which ar-
rived here on Friday :
%l Hobart Town, Sept. 24, 1829.
(( We have bed a charming % winter; some sharp
cold ; the thermometer throughout the day some
times not rising higher than 36, and up the country it
has stood at 21 ; we have had less rain than usual, and
taken as a whole, the weather has been beautiful. In
point of climate we heat, you hollow, as we shall soon
do i� every thing else. Here are no fags to gloom the
spirits, and as the ladies say, no damp to take out the
hair?no blacks and smokes to soil the skin, and infect
clothes; and, I may add, no sights of deplorable
poverty, such as you describe, to harrow the heart.
? When I read your last picture of dreary, dirty,
distressed London, J thank my stars that I have here
peace, plenty, health, and cleanliness ; and, at the
same time, heartily wish you were here amongst us.
The old and dear friends we have been used to, are all
we want here to make us as happy as it is possible to be
on eaith. Tell , and ??, the only chance of
their ever seeing me again, is their coming out, as I
would not leave the place for any other under the sun,
and in my time I have proved a pretty variety. It is,
without question, the finest climate on the globe. I
never enjoyed such health anywhere as I do here.?
To the EDITOR or the MORNING HERALD.
Sir,?To enable your readers to judge correctly of the
state of this part of England, take the following facts;
-?There are parishes in the county of Norfolk, the
officers and occupiers of which have been, and are, in
the habit of putting tip the labourers to auction. Out
of this have recently arisen great discontents amongst
these degraded labourers ; and, in a parish which I do
not name, because I wish to avoid any tiling tending
to excite particular animosity, a farmer, who seems to
have given more offence than the rest to these labour-
ers, was, about a month ago, punished in the following
manner.
One night, all his ploughs were sawed across the
beam; his wagon and cart wheels had every other
spoke sawed across; and, his other implements ren-
dered, in some way or other, unfit for use. A new
gig was crippled by sawing the shafts and spokes. The
saw, with the help of a little bit of grease, is a very
quiet instrument! No trace of the offender ! But,
good God ! was it ever contemplated, that such a state
of things could ever he! What code of laws can
protect the property of the farmer, in such a state of
things ? Unless his wagons be as safe in his yard, and
his sheep as safe in his fold as his body is in his bed,
he cannot carry on his affairs. There must, there-
fore, he an end to this state of things in some way
or anothei. But, the important circumstance is, that
this numerous class are now beginning to resent this
treatment of them. This auction work has been going
on for ten years, or thereabouts, in almost every
county of the kingdom, without ever exciting any
thing in the way of resistance. For several years, the
House of Commons have had the facts slated to them
in evidence attached to the report of their committees.
The committee of the year before last, had the facts
stated to them by Mr. Boyce, of Baldershaw, in Kent ;
and the committee, though it paid attention in their re-
port to all the Malthusian part of the evidence, paid not
the smallest attention to the evidence of Mr.B. At last,
the consequences appear to be approaching us ; and it
U no t too much, i hope, ta es;psct thai the Duk� of
Richmond, in his intended propositions with regard to
the labourers, will advert to this auction work, and
will endeavour to put an end to the oppressions which
have been practised noon this description of persons.
Your powerful aid in this work, I hope the country
may rely upon, and, in that hope I remain, sir, your
most obedient and most humble servant,
Bury St, Edmunds, Mary 9. Wm. Cobbett,
LEGAL REFORM.
The speech of* Sir J. Scarlett, in moving for
leave to bring in a bill for the better administration of
justice in Wales, was quire characteristic. ?He knew
(he said) that the popular opinion was in favour of de-
stroying all the ancient institutions of the country ;
but he was the furthest from wishing to minister to
that appetite ; he wished as far as possible to adhere to
existing arrangements ; his endeavour was to preserve
ancient forms as nearly as possible ; there was nothing
he more earnestly wished to avoid than giving way to the
visions of wild theorists. The longer the experience,
the more minute the acquaintance with the jurispru-
dence of England, the more apparent were its positive
excellencies, and the more striking its superiority over
the systems of every other nation. It was true that we
had only 15 judges; but those 15 judges tried more
causes, and decided concerning a greater amount of
property, than all the judges of France.? After enu-
merating the different courts, and the number of judges,
&c., lie observed, that ? the whole of the expense,
when turned into English money, at 25 francs to the
pound sterling, amounted to 582,5561. If the house
compared the quantity of business done, he was satis-
fied that it would be found that there was no reason to
complain of what was decided in the English courts.?
In all this there is a great deal of assumption on the
part of Sir James, and a great deal which, if true,
is beside the question.
We do not see how', even supposing the English
system of jurisprudence to be superior to that o �
France, that it is therefore necessarily superior to
the systems of every other nation, because it is
not proved that that of France is better than the
systems of ail other nations; and still less does
it follow, that because the systems of all other
nations are bad, that the system of England is
necessarily good. As far as we can learn, the French
system is worse than that of almost every nation in
Europe. Again, a faulty system may render it neces-
sary to have an immense number,of judges in France;
but that does not justify the denial of justice in England
to ali but those who are able to sue in the King?s courts.
The reason why 15 judges do all the business of
England is because law is a luxury in England, only
within the reach of the rich. The amount of property
decided oh is nothing to the purpose, because England
is a much richer country than Fiance, and the denial of
justice to the mass of the people may still leave a
greater amount of property to be decided on than
is under litigation in the Courts of France. The
idea of comparing the amount of property occurs only
to a man steeped in the prejudices of English aristocracy.
The question ought not to be the amount of properly
decided on, but the number of individuals to whom
justice has been administered ; for the happiness of a
poor man ought to be as dear to the legislature as the
happiness of a rich man, and the happiness of a poor
man may be as much dependent on a question of 101.
value as the happiness of a rich man on a question of a
million. When we see that the whole number of
causes tried in the half-yearly northern circuit, a sec-
tion of England containing a population of between
three and four millions of the most active and intelli-
gent people of the world, amounts only to a few
hundred, it is clear that there is a complete denial of
justice to all but the very rich, and that the descrip-
tion of causes decided in local courts in France and
Scotland (amounting, in the latter country, to twenty
thousand a-year) has no tribunal in England, except
an occasional Court of Conscience in the horrible
county courts. When the sura is large, a suitor will
in England brave the delay and the expense; but the
injust.ee of hall-yeariy delays, and the being com-
pelled to travel with witnesses to a distance, and to
maintain them for weeks at the assize town, when
the whole might often be settled at a small expense in
a local court, are not the less evident Morning

THE WEXFORD ELECTION COMMITTEE.
Wednesday, March 10.
Mr. Sergeant Taddy was heard this day on an ob-
jection made by Mr. Harrison yesterday to the validity
of the votes of those who had*been admitted to their
freedom in batches. The learned sergeant would not
ceny that that mode of admission was irregular, but
the irregularity was remedied vith respect to those
elected in 1795 and 1813, by statutes 38 Geo. 3, c. 2,
which made the title of all persons who had been in the
enjoyment of the franchise for six years unimpeach-
able.
Mr. Harrison observed that the statute did not apply
to the voters here objected to, the words of the statute
were, u that the title of any person to corporate rights
shall be unimpeachable by a quo warranto at the end of
6 years after such person shall have been duly admitted.?
The objection to these voters was, that they had not
been duly admitted. The fact of their names appear-
ing in the corporation books was no proof of their hav-
ing enjoyed or exercised corporate rights. He admitted
that if they had been duly sworn in, however irregu-
larly elected, six years antecedent to the last election,
they would be within the meaning of the statute, and
qualified to vote.
Mr. Sergeant Taddy replied.
The room was cleared, and the committee decided
that all those freemen who had been admitted in
batches were not duly elected, and that the onus of
proving that they were entitled to vote at the last elec-
tion lay with the sitting member.
Mr. Sergeant Taddy was not in a condition to prove
that the voters objected to had been duly sworn in six
years previous to the election ; but he?submitted that
the committee should presume that fact from these
voters having exercised the franchise for 35 vears. In
support of this the learned sergeant cited a decision of
the Drogheda election committee, who, in the absence
of direct evidence of the swearing in of a freeman,
presumed the fact from the freeman having filled an
office in the corporation, on entering into which it was
customary to be sworn.
Mr. Harrison observed that there was this distinction
between the Droghedacase and the present, that in the
former it appeared that no entry of the swearing-in
had been made fur 30 years previously in the corpora-
tion books; consequently no evidence of that fact
could be produced from the hooks ; but in the present
ease it appeared that the names of ali who had been
sworn in were duly entered in the book, and, in the
absence of an entry, the presumption should he against
the swearing-in. Besides, none of the voters objected
to bad been in the enjoyment of any office in the corpo-
ration in which it was necessary to he sworn.
The committee, having deliberated for a short time,
came to a decision that the votes objected to were
invalid.
In consequence of this decision 22 of the sitting mem-
ber?s votes were struck off.
The committee adjourned to eleven o?clock next day.

at Brighton, for a night and a day, and had further to the Committee on the East India Company?s charter,
said that the child with which she was then visibly
pregnant was the offspring of the prince.
Lord Ellenhorough?s solicitor stated that the reason
why proceedings in the Ecclesiastical Court, or in a
court of law, had not been taken sooner was, that he
whs not able till the month of June last to procure suf-
ficient evidence of the adultery. The usual proceedings
had then been commenced in the Consistorial Court,
and a judgment got against her ladyship for a divorce
a mensa et thoro. He had made the proper inquiries as
to whether Prince Swanzenburgh was in England
since he had procured this evidence, but from all he
could learn the Prince was not in England so as to
enable Lord Kllcnborough to bring an action at law
against him.
A servant who lived in the house, No. 11, Harley-
street, opposite to No. 73, where Prince Swanzen-
burgh resided, in 1828, stated that he very frequently
saw a lady driving in a cabriolet to No. 73, sometimes
alone, sometimes with Prince Swartzenburgh;
when she went alone, the Prince was generally
lur king out of the window, and opened the door for
her himself, without her either knocking or ringing;
sometimes the lady came on foot, and the Prince Jet
her in himself in the same manner; the lady usually
drove the cabriolet herself; but she had a servant-boy,
of the name of Carpenter, with her, who sometimes
drove ; the cabriolet sometimes waited for the lady in
Wimpole-street, Holles-street, Portman-square, and
other adjoining places; the prince occupied the first
floor of No. 73, Harley-street, and when standing at
the windows of No. 11, he often saw the lady and the
prince together in the front room ; he could not have
seen them if the door of a back room had not been
open, but there were no blinds up on the middle-win-
duw, and the parties could easily have seen him if they
had looked that way ; he observed nothing improper
between the prince and the lady, except on one occa-
sion, when he saw him lacing her stays.
The Earl of Radnor remarked that there was no
evidence here of the identity of the lady.
The Lord Chancellor observed that there were two
questions here?the conduct of the lady, and her
identity; and the counsel would exercise a sound dis-
cretion in putting questions as to both points.
The witness did not at the time knew who the lady
was, nor did he know yet, except from what he had
heard from the boy Carpenter, and others. He would
know Carpenter if he were to see him.
Examined by Lord Radnor?-The lady on these occa-
sions wore a veil, but she did not in any other respect
evince any desire of concealmen'. This took place
particularly about the months of May, June, and July,
1828. The lady usually came to No. 73, Harley-street,
between the hours of two and five o?cLck in the after-
noon, and she used to stay with the prince from two
hours to two hours and a half. When she came out the
prince came out with her, and went away with her,, or
followed after in two or three minutes. He went with
Carpenter to a coachmaker?s, where he identified the
cabriolet.
Carpenter was then called, and stated that he was
groom to Lady Ellenborough in 1828, and in that year
frequently went with her in the cabriolet to Harley-
street and its vicinity, and sometimes waited for her in
Wimpole-street, Holles-street, Portman-square; and
sometimes she got out and walked away, desiring him
to go home. He described the cabriolet or phaeton in
the same manner as the preceding witness.
Anne Lewis Lived with Prince Swanzenburgh as
servant in 1828 and part of 1829 ; during the former
period he lived at No. 73, Harley-street; daring the
latter period in Holles-street. In 1828, he was fre-
quently visited by a lady; she did not knock
or ring, but was generally let in by the prince
himself; sometimes she came alone, and some-
times with the prince, who let her in with his
own key. The same lady also visited the
prince in Holles-street, to which he removed
in March 1829, but not so frequently as when he lived
in Harley-street; and they behaved in the same man-
ner. The prince and the lady on two occasions came
into the house by a back door, and were let in by means
of the prince?s key; she did not know who the lady
was ; the reason why she thought that something im-
proper had taken place between the lady and the prince,
when they were together, was, that on looking into the
bed-room after they went away, she found it, although
she had made?it in the morning, quite rumpled as if
two persons had been in it, and she had to make it
over again ; this was occasionally observed by her sister
as well as herself.
John Prior was servant at the George?s Arms pub-
lic-house, St. Ann?, -street, and stated that he had often
seen the phaeton or cabriolet, mentioned by some of the
preceding witnesses, about Wimpole-street and Holles-
street, and some other places in the vicinity of Harley-
street, and had seen a lady and the-boy Carpenter in it;
he saw the phaeton drivento No. 73, Harley-street,with
the lady and the boy ; he knew that 73, Harley-street,
was the residence of Prince Swartzenburgh, as he had
been in the habit of serving beer at the house ; he knew
also that the lady was Lady Ellenborough, as he had
seen her at Prince Esterhazy?s, when he was therewith
beer; she arrived at the time he was there, and the
porter announced her as Mrs. Caroline Ellenborough,
and the servant announced her to the porter as such ;
she then came in a large carriage, and not in a phaeton
or cabriolet; he was sure that he heard her named El-
len borough.
Cross-examined by Mr. Dampier, as to whether he
was sure of the name of Caroline or of Ellenborough ;
He said that he was not quite so sure.
William Wheel?Had driven Prince Swartzenburgh
and a lady from 73, Harley-street, t� Putney Common
and Wimbledon, to the house of the Countess St.
Antonio; he did not know at first that the lady was
Lady Ellenborough, but he did soon after; the reason
why iie knew was that the boy Carpenter, who was
waiting with a cabriolet, asked him whether he drove
Lady Ellenborough and the prince from 73, Harley-
street.
Mr. Law proved the hand-writing of Lady Ellen-
borough, which was put in, but not read.
Mr. Rogers, fr.-m the Consistorial Court, produced
office copies of the proceedings in that Court in the
divorce case, at the instance of Lord Ellenborough.
Mr. Dampier, counsel against the bill, observed that
their lordships had heard the evidence, and would
draw' their own conclusions from it. He had only to
observe that in the branch of the evidence that related
to the excursion to Brighton, although the identity of
Lady Ellenborough had been sufficiently proved, that
of Prince Swartzenburgh had not.
The Earl of Rosslyn then observed the evidence ao-
peared to he abundantly sufficient to support the bill,
and moved that it be read a second time.
The bill was read a second time, without a dissentient
voice.

Sir A Grant and others from the Commons, brought

the Bill for the appropriation of certain Revenues
for the Service of the Year 1830, which were read a

The Marquis of LANSDOWN presented a petition
from the Jews of Liverpool, praying to be admitted to
the privileges of the British constitution ; and he
saw no reason why the request should not be complied
with-
His lordship also presented a petition from the
Chamber of Commerce of Glasgow, against the East
India monopoly ; and petitions to the same effect were
presented by other noble lords from the Edinburgh
Chamber of Commerce, and from the tea-dealers of
Manchester.
A petition was presented from the leather dealers of
Linlithgow, praying for a repeal of the remaining
part of the leather duty. The noble lord who presented
it stated that the public had derived no advantage from
the repeal of that part of the leather duty which had
been already repealed, and yet, nearly half a million
had been sacrificed for it. The best plan would be to
repeal the whole ; and if the whole were not repealed,
perhaps the best course would be to resort to the old
scale.

to this country. His right honourable friend had

which they had adopted, and that they would have
acted improperly if they had, under the existing eir.
cumstances, interfered. Why, the history of Portugal,
for the list 30 years, was nothing but the history of
Jajighsh interference; and it could not be other-
wise, in consequence of the engagements which hound
this country to that limited and feeble state. All

traordinary crisis in Portugal will be found in an ac
ceptav.ce, (as immediate as may be suitable with the
importance of the measure) of the charter of Don
Pedro, coupled (as it is) with his abdication of the
throne. Any other course must, as it appears to us, be

Col. BEREsFORD defended the conduct of Lord n)e
Beresford, who had shown the correspondence alluded
to to the Duke of Wellington at the period of its occur- all '
reuce, and the noble duke by no means disapproved P Ol
of it,
Mr. DAVENPORT observed, that it was quite f�
evident that despotism was established in Portu- lfc
gal by our concurrence. We kept our army
in Portugal so long as they served th� cause of
Don Miguel, and withdrew them from it when they a<
should protect the constitutionalists. The hon. mem- ter
ber here passed a censure on the correspondence tr s'
of Lord Beresford, and condemned the conduct of
ministers in surrendering the ports on the Tagus to
Portugal, which they might have retained without an
violating any just principle. He did not know why the t * ia
production of the correspondence moved for was object- rea
ed to. No adequate reason was advanced- for such ob- Ber
jfiedon. This country should pay more attention to tbe
relation in which we stand with foreign nations. They 111
should be cautious. Jest in studying to avoid b war, they
should fall into one. on
Sir F. BURDETT was surprised .that the speech of � n l
the noble mover had not as yet received an answer. It
was discreditable to the house that a motion like that to
which now stood before them, should meet with such a *
fatality. It was very well for those who had confidence aI
in the conduct of ministers, not to be anxious for the ? ia
production of these papers; but it was otherwise with . * 8
those w'ho had not such confidence in ministers. The * mi
conduct of Don Miguel w?as an insult to the Crown of aSI
England, and it was through England he was enabled '- ,ai
to be guilty of such treachery. He w-isbed, indeed use '
they ought to know, what had iu reality taken place.
(Bear, hear.) The country w-as in a state of distress, r^ ei
owing certainly only to a mistaken legislation. It
ought to be in a high state of prosperity, instead of be- ��!
ing as it was, plunged into the deepest condition of dis- aut
tress. England was as able as ever she was to maintain t | ir<
her honour. {Hear, hear.) When he found a mini-
flier of this country getting up in that house, and
stating that this country could not go to Avar, he would * lis
like to know why they should give such large votes for f xc
so large a standing army, (baas?;) that army under the im l
present system would be perfectly useless He did not
see why they should not endeavour to keep their money, staJ
even though they could not take care of their ho- P ea

the highest opinion *;f the sentiments of the late Mr. SM

HOUSE OF LORDS, Thursday, March 11.
Lord KING presented a petition from the corporate
trades of Irving, Scotland, against the East India mono-
poly, in favour of the reduction of taxes, and against
th� corn laws.
The Earl of DERBY presented three petitions for
N throwing the trade to India and China open : from the
Mayor and corporation of Liverpool; the merchants,
manufacturers, and others of that town : and from the
trustees of the dock company. Referred to a select
committee.
Lord WHARNCLIFFE presented a similar petition
from Halifax.
The Duke of WELLINGTON presented a petition
from the inhabitants of St. Pan eras against the Vestry
Act.
STAMPS ON RANK NOTES.
The Duke of WELLINGTON ?My lords, I wish
to take this opportunity of giving an answer to a ques-
tion put to me the other day by my noble friend (Vis-
count Goderich) with respect to a return presented to
the house relative to the number of stamps issued for
bank-notes within a given period. I find that I was
right in what I then said, that I believed the stamps
for the Scotch notes were included. I have now to in-
form my noble friend that it is impossible to ascertain
the number of stamps issued for Scotch notes, except
those for one pound, the account being blended. The
return, I may add, includes the notes of the chartered
banks.
Earl BEAUCHAMP presented a petition from a
parish in Warwickshire, complaining of distress, and
praying relief.
STAMP DUTY.
The Earl of MALMESBURY?My lords, lam de-

which I beg to call your lordships? attention a few mo-

stamp-duty; one of which is of considerable importance
to a class of subjects with which I am connected?l
mean agriculturists. As the day is now approaching in
which his Majesty?s government are ab�ut to state what
are the reductions which they intend to propose, I
think this a fair opportunity of calling their attention
to the subject Of stamp-duty cm conveyances of lifehold
property. In that part of the kingdom where I reside,
in many parts of Dorsetshire? Wiltshire, and the west
of England, it is very usual"for cottagers to hold their
cottages for life. This, I think, is an excellent custom,
and one beneficial to that class of persons. It fre-
quently happens, when they have children, and a life
drops off, that they are anxious of putting in their
children?s. The amount of fine is 51. This is the sum
generally paid in adding one life to two others. The
hardship, however is, that the stamp on the conveyance
is 11. 155., and the stamp on the counterpart 11. 10s.?
for they require, and are right In having that security.
So that in a transaction in which a cottager pays 51., no
less'a sum than 31. ss. is required by government in
stamp-duty. This, my lords, frequently acts as a bar
to such transactions. If they are content to pay a fine
of 51. for that advantage, they are unwilling?and in-
capable, God knows, in the present depressed s ate of
things?to pay the enormous stamp-duty on that trans-
* action. Besides, a landlord may be inclined to take the
fine by instalments, but the stamp-duty must be paid
on the nail?no instalment can be taken for it.
The conveyance of an estate in fee, if it be sold for
less than 1601., only requires a stamp of 11. 10s. Ido
hope that the attention of his Majesty?s ministers may
be directed to this point, and that they will remove
this tax. Now lamon my legs, I will also refer to a
point, where there is a duty imposed, which affects not
only the agriculturists, but all classes?l mean the
policy on what is called the common insurance from
fire. I find, from the calculations made by those who
are willing to insure property from fire, that, in the
year 1815, a policy was only 2s. (on the 1001. insured,)
whilst the duty was 2s. 6d.no less than 125 per
cent, on the policy. The duty, in 1826, was raised to
3s.?thus making 150 per cent, on the policy. From
more accurate calculations, it was now discovered that
Is. 6d, was considered sufficient remuneration for the
risk of losses by fire, and the duty was still 3s,?being
200 per cent., or twice as much as the insurance-office
required. I am perfectly satisfied, my lords, that if
the tax were reduced an increase of revenue would fol-
low ; for many persons would insure who do not now
insure their property. These are points, I think, well
worth the attention of his Majesty?s ministers. I beg
to move for a ? return of the amount �f stamp duty
paid on conveyances of all life-hold property under the
value of 61.** Also (i for a return of the amount of
? stamp-duty paid on all conveyances of property in fee,
under the value of 1501.??Agreed to.
The Duke of MONTROSE presented a petition,
agreed to at a county meeting held at Dunbarton, com-
plaining of distress, and recommending a rigid economy
in the expenditure of government, and praying a reduc-
tion of taxation.
STATE OF THE COUNTRY".
Lord HOLLAND?I received a note, my lords, from
my noble relative (the Duke of Richmond), on my way
to the house, requesting me to give notice that he in-
tends bringing forward the motion on Thursday next,
which he was prevented, by indisposition, from submit-
ting to the house this evening. I now move that the
house be summoned for that day.?Agreed to.
PORTUGAL.
Lord HOLLAND?I now rise, my loros, ifpr the pur-
pose of putting some questions to the noble Secretary for
Foreign Affairs with respect to our relations with Por-
tugal. There appears to me to be but scanty informa-
tion on the subject. In requesting the information of
the noble earl, it will be necessary to refer io the com-
munications from the throne, which we have had from
time to time, connected with the affairs of %hat country.
On the 29th of July, 1828, in the speech from the
throne, his Majesty says, u he relies upon the wisdom of
the august house of Braganza to take the course which
shall be best calculated to maintain the interests and
honour of that illustrious family, and to secure the
peace and happiness of the dominions over which it
reigns ? At the opening of the session of 1829 we are
told that u his Majesty has entered into negotiations
with the head of the house of Braganza, in the hope of
terminating a state of affairs ; ? and at the close of the
session this paragraph is in the speech :?? It is with
increased regret that his Majesty again adverts to the
condition of the Portuguese monarchy; but his Majes-
ty commands us to repeat his determination
to use every effort to reconcile conflicting in-
terests, and to remove the evils which press so heavily
upon a country, the prosperity of which must ever be
an object of his Majesty?s solicitude.? At the com-
mencement of the present session the speech states
that iC his Majesty laments that he is unable to an-
nounce to you the prospect of a reconciliation between
the princes of the house of Braganza.? From these
communications I suppose that a negotiation was es-
tablished with our aliiesj with a view of reconciling
the differences which exist between the branches of the
house of Braganza, for we are led to believe that such
a negotiation was established ; and from the speech
last quoted we learn that his Majesty?s hopes have
been disappointed ; the natural inference is, that the
negotiation failed. But, since this, other circumstances
have occurred, and we are told in a document to which
I know it is not quite regular to allude?nevertheless
the document is made known to all Europe?l mean,
ray lords, the communication of the King of France,
at the opening of the Chambers on the 2d of this
month. In that communication I find the French
King informs his Chambers that u at the present mo-
ment he is, in concert with his allies, carrying on ne-
gotiations, the object of which is to effect-between the
princes of the house of Braganza a reconciliation, ne-
cessary to the tranquillity of the Peninsula.? Now,
my lords, the questions which I wish to put to the
noble earl are these ?First, whether the negotiations
which were originally established in 1829, and alluded
to in the speech at the opening of the present parlia-
ment, are terminated or not ? Secondly, whether, in
the negotiations entered into by his Majesty with his
allies, France entered into negotiations for a similar
purpose, op whether France has some ulterior purpose?
also, whether we are principal parties to the second
negotiation, or have a secondary part in the ne�
gotiation, in which, aa principals, we failed ?
The third question relates to another branch
of the subject equally irregular to allude 2 to, but
to which, nevertheless, I feel it right to call the atten-
tion of the house. My lords, your lordships well
know that his Majesty?s ministers have invariably
given as a reason far not producing papers respecting
negotiations, when pending, that it would be improper
so to do. Now, I wish to know, if the negotiations are
actually pending, whether they are carried on in con-
cert with our allies, and whether the Kings of France
and Spain are parties ? These, my lords, are the ques B
tions I wish to put to the noble earl. There is, I may
add, my lords, some discrepancy between the speech of
the King of France, and that delivered by the lords
! i .. ... ... AtwMi Iti PHI All 4 Vk'Wl I*l rvi nnf
commissioners at the opening of the present parliament
to this house, in one particular. In the speech of the
King of France it is stated ? that the war in the East
is at an end; the moderation of the conqueror, and the
friendly intervention of the powers, by preserving the
Ottoman empire from the disasters which threatened it,
having maintained the balance of Europe, and strength-
ened the ancient relations of the different states,?
Now, in the speech of the commissioners, a satisfaction
is expressed at the conclusion of the war between those
two powers, but I do not understand that it was
brought about on the part of his Majesty. Whether
there is any omission in the commissioners? speech in
that respect I am not able to say.
The Eiri of ABERDEEN?In answer to the ques-
tions which the noble lord has proposed, I beg to ob*

The petition was then brought up and read. It played
that the house would not sanction the trade being thrown
open, and also that they might be heard by counsel against
the bill.
Envoys at the several courts have strict orders to
si cable?they had not been attended with so satisfactory
a result as could have been wished. Properly speaking,
no negotiations had been carried on, inasmuch as our
plenipotentiary went to the Brazils, but was referred
to London, it being considered by the Emperor in-
convenient to carry on negotiations on both sides the
Atlantic at the same moment. With respect to the
negotiations into which we entered with the King of
France, that is a different transaction. We certainly
act in concert with the French government, but by no
means in a secondary manner. Quite the reverse. A
communication has been made, in concert with the
French government, in reference to the reconciliation
of the princes of the house of Braganza, As to the
ulterior purposes of that government I knew nothing,
if any such exist; but Ido not think there are. (The
noble earl here paused.)
Lord HOLLAND suggested an answer respecting
pending negotiations.
The Earl of ABERDEEN?Pending negotiations ?
I beg to say, my lords, that they could scarcely be called
negotiations. A communication has been made, in
concert with the King of France and with our allies, to
the court of Brazil.
Mr BROWNLOW said that the introduction of a refuse passports to any person suspected of be-
longing to this infamous body.

dated Nov. 3, which as usual are flattering. The
forces of Dopo Nigoro are, for the hundredth sime,
wholly annihilated.
Lord HOLLAND?The court of Brazil ?
The Earl of ABERDEEN signified assent. With
respect to what the noble lord has said, that papers are
refused when negotiations are pending, it must be
obvious to your lordships that such a course is the
proper one. When the time comes for the production
of the papers alluded to, the noble lord will see a very
good reason for not producing them at the present mo-
ment. I am not aware whether such a declaration
was made ; but this I feel assured of, that if the pa-
pers were produced whilst negotiations are pending,
it might prove injurious to the parties for whom, the
noble lord is interested. With respect to the passage
in the Speech of the King of France quoted by the noble
lord, I do not think it bears the construction which the
noble lord has given it. Our endeavours to bring about
a peace between the two powers alluded to have been
unceasing, and I think it will be found that we have
been instrumental in causing peace. We have strongly
urged the necessity of peace to both parties, and what
effect our repeated remonstrances have had will be ulti-
mately seen. I will, however, say that neither party
neglected attending to them ; but undoubtedly the
Turkish government appeared a length of time insen-
sible of the situation in which they were placed.
Lord HOLLAND?I am not certainly prepared, my
lords, with any motion on this subject, but I must be
permitted to make one or two observations in conse-
quence of what the noble earl has said. In the speech
from the throne, at the opening of the session of 1829,
it is said that u his Majesty has entered into negotia-
tions with the head of the house of Braganza.? Now,
my lords, I wish to know whether that negotiation is
concluded. I think from what the noble earl has said
that the negotiation is concluded, and the one in con-
junction with the King of France is a separate and new
one.
The Earl of ABERDEEN?The noble lord is not
quite correct in describing this as an entirely new nego-
tiation, inasmuch as the same object is in view in both.
The negotiation entered into immediately with the
Emperor Don Pedro had arrived at that state that
there was very little prospect of a favourable issue.
With respect to the second negotiation with tV.e court
of France and our other allies, I can only say that it
is entered into with perfect concord between the two
countries.
Lord HOLLAND?Then the court of France was
not a party to that negotiation mentioned in the King
of England?s speech, but it is to the negociation now
existing. Ido not wish to ask any improper questions,
but I should like to know whether the court of Spain is
a party ?
TheEarlof ABERDEEN?In answer to the noble
lord, I beg to say that the court of Spain is no party to
the negotiation. The court of Austria has been a party
from the first of the transaction. I may add, my lords,
that through the whole of these negotiations the court
of France has had cognizance of what we have done
from the first.
The conversation here dropped.
Lord Ellenborough?s Divorce Bill was reported with
one amendment, and ordered to be engrossed.
The Marriage Validating Bill passed through a com-
mittee.
In the committee Lord Holland eulogised the right
rev. prelate (the Bishop of London) for bringing in the
bill. A clause was inserted at the suggestion of the
Bishop of Bath and Wells; and an amendment to one
of the clauses by the Bishop of London.

HOUSE OF COMMONS, Thursday, March 10.
Mr. Neeld, the member for Gatton, took the oaths
and seat.
BEER LICENSING SYSTEM.
Mr. Alderman THOMPSON said he rc.se for the
purpose of presenting a petition from a very numerous
and respectable body of persons?the licensed victuallers
of the City of London and its vicinny; the petition was
signed by 11,000 persons interested in the sa?e of beer
hy retail. He considered it unnecessary to state to the
house the large property embarked by these individuals
in their business ; it must be known to every member
present. He would only state the fact thar, in the City
of London and its vicinity, there were about 4,3 O licen-
sed victuallers, and the capital embarked by them could
not be estimated at less than one million sterling. He
would wish to impress this fact on the memory of hon.
members, who would shortly have to decide upon the
important question, whether the beer trade was to be
thrown open or not. If the alteration should take place
he felt convinced that one-half of this industrious and re-
spec'abie class ot persons must be ruined, and the pro-
perty of the other reduced 50 per cent, in value, whilst
the good likely to arise to the public in general was very
uncertain. The consumption of beer had fallen off con-
siderably, he would alow, but he did not attribute this to
any fault of the publicans; it had been produced, in
some degree, by the reduction of the duties on wine,
spirits, and coffee. But, above all, he considered as the
principal cause of this diminished consumption the very
heavy duty upon malt. (Hear, hear.) He considered
that the publicans could not be blamed on account of the
monopoly in the sale of beer ; it was a monopoly which h*d
existed for centuries, and had been the cause of creating
a fictitious pr perty in licensed houses. The publicans
had embarked large sums under the existing state of the
laws, and it was now sought, by a change in those laws,
to deprive them of the greater portion of their property.
The petitioners prayed that they might be hea d by
counsel, and allowed to call evidence against throwing
open the trade.
Mr. Alderman WOOD supported the petition. He
stated that such was the decline in the sale of beer, that
one-half of the publicans had not trade sufficient to live
upon at present. He did not consider that by throwing
open the trade any benefit would arise to the public.
The price ci uld not be reduced so long as the heavy
ma't tax was continued.
Sir J. N EVVPORT was in favour of the trade being
thrown open to fair competition, by which the country
must be benefitted. He considered that this was an
instance in which it was attempted to set up vested in-
terests as a bar to the execution of a measure likely to
be productive, of public good. He felt confident the
opening of the trade would be of great service, not only
in this country, but also in Ireland.
Mr. G. R. DAWSON hoped honourable members
would not be led away by misrepresentations. He should
reserve his arguments for a proper occasion, and reel
satisfied, without protracting the debate, by moving that
the petition be referred to the committee now sitting on
beer licenses.
Mr. F. BUXTON considered that the observations
which had fallen from the honourable baro�et were un-
called for and harsh. If the monopoly in the sale of beer
had been an evil, neither the brewers nor the publicans
were the cause of it. The evil originated in the excessive
taxation of this particular article?one which fell so
heavily, and out of ail proport-on, on those the least able
to bear it. He would nut go so far-as to say that the
public did not suffer in some degree from the monopoly,
but he would merely state whs.t the taxation was, to
show how that monopoly was caused. He would show
that there was nothing taxed so highly as this cheap
beverage of the poor. (Hear.) The tax on the rich
man?s champagne amounted to 27 per cent., that on
claret to 28 per cent., on port wine to 26 per cent.,
whil-t the working man and industrious artizan paid on
beer 165 per cent. ! ( Hear, hear.) If a gentleman con-
sumed in his family a quarter of malt, it cost him 205.,
whilst to the artizan it would amount to 555. (Hear.)
it was to these causes of unequal taxation that he attri-
buted the evil, and not from any imaginary advantages
arising to the publican. With respect to the diminished
consumption of beer, he con-idered that it had been
principally produced by the reduction of the duty on
spiri s. The contemplated change, he, as one of the
porter brewers, was ready to admit, would be attended
with a heavy loss in their trade?but not one but what
they could withstand; and, if the trade was to
be thrown open, the brewers did not fear a fair compe-
tition, But to the publican, who had embarked his
capital in the purchase of the privilege of carrying on
his trade, it must be attended with the most ruinous serious loss to him in the collection of the tolls at the
consequences. If this interference could be at all jus- of Bailinasloe . This sut ,j ec[ he would also submit

Sir FRANCIS BURDETT presented a petition from
numerous inhabitants of the city of Coventry, com-
plaining of the distress prevailing amongst the numer-
ous classes in that city, which they ascribed in some
degree to the contracted state of the currency; and
praying a reform in parliament.
Mr. DENISON presented petitions from the farm-
ers of various places in Surrey, complaining of distress,

Mr. C. P. THOMSON presented a petition from

for freedom of commercial intercourse with India, and
for unrestrained liberty to reside in that country.
Mr. HUSKI6SON presented a petition from 7000
persons of Liverpool, praying that the East India
Company?s monopoly might not be renewed.
Mr. O?CONN ELL presented two petitions in favour

meeting at the Eagle Tavern, City-road, on Monday
last.
General GASCOYNE presented the petition of the
mayor, burgesses, and council of Liverpool, praying
the abolition of the East India Company?s monopoly of
the trade to India.
IRISH POOR.
Mr. S. RICE, in bringing forward his present mo-
tion, wished to remind the house, that this was the
first time that the state of the Irish poor could be con-
sidered without those perplexities which had hung over
Irish subjects for many years. He believed no opposi-
tion to his motion for inquiry was intended, hut still
he wished to give some explanation of his views, lest
any mistake in his intentions, or of the object of the
committee, might go abroad, either in this country or
in Ireland. In the year 1729 the exports of Ireland
were 287,0001., and in the present year 2,163,0001 ,
which would imply a growing prosperity. There was
also evidence before the house of the increasing im-
provement of the people of that country. In the city
which he represented, the number of patients in the
hospital was in 1826, 2781, in 1827, 2977, and in the
last year it was only 692, which implied that misery
and distress were on the decline rather than on the in-
crease. The honourable member had been lately in-
formed that the Earl of Kenmare was expending 5001.
a-year in making improvements in his estates in the
neighbourhood of Killarney, which contributed much
to the comforts of the labouring classes in that county.
The hon. member then proceeded to show that there was
a gradual improvement in the moral conduct of the peo-
ple, and cited in support of this position the number of
committals and convictions for crimes in several years,.
which showed a diminution in every year front 1823 down
to the present period. The charitable institutions of
that country, be observed, were well supported. There
was an hospital in every county except that of Water-
ford, and the expense of supporting those hospitals was
84,0061., 50,0001. of which were the result of private
contributions. Fever hospitals were also abundant;
not less than half a million of poor people last year ex-
perienced relief from those establishments. He wished
the house to institute an inquiry into the subject, and
they would find that charity wqs dispensed there as
amply as in any other country in proportion to its
means. He maintained, that any attempt to introduce
a system of poor-laws into it would prove injurious
to its interests. The hon. member here cited extracts
from several reports made by committees which had
investigated the subject at different periods, all of
which went to show that any system of poor laws
which would hold out to the poor any other prospect of
supporting themselves than by their own* industry,
would be highly impolitic and injurious. There was a
great number of houses of industry in Ireland. The
experiment of such houses had been tried in Dublin on
a large scale ; no less than 800,0001. had been expended
on one of these houses out of the public purse since the
union ; yet, instead of effecting the object which it had
in view, that is, to restrain mendicity, it only served
to increase it, as appeared from the report of a com-
mittee which inquired into the subject. From all this
it should be concluded that bouses of industry, instead
of diminishing misery, only served to increase it, for
wherever such houses were thither beggars flocked, de-
pending on the relief administered in those houses,
rather than on their own industry. There was gene-
rally a physician and a surgeon appointed to such
houses with high salaries. He (Air. Rice) knew of such
physicians prescribing for patients at a distance of a
mile off, merely from a report which had been made to
him of the state of their health. The hon. member
also knew of several persons dying in these houses
through neglect, which showed that these establish-
ments were not as useful as they were expensive. The
hon. member here eulogised the book written by Mr.
Sadler, respecting the state of Ireland, at the*same
time he differed from the hon. member for Newark in
the expediency of introducing the poor-laws into that
country. He (Mr. Rice) was hostile to such poor-
laws, as it would be an inducement to the landlord
to diminish the number of tenants on his eTate.
Such laws would have a tendency to diminish the
demand for labour, for the money to suppor: the poor
would come out of the pockets of the landholders, who
would employ a less number of labourers in proportion
as the taxes they should pay were greater. He
would rather see the poor supported by their own
industry than by charity. Some persons recom-
mended a modification of the English poor laws. He
(Mr. R.) wished to know what was meant by a modifi-
cation ot the English poor laws. The hon. member
here read some extracts from a pamphlet written by Sir
W. Walsh respecting the poor Jaws, in which the hon.
baronet suggested that the law of settlement should not
be admitted into Ireland at all. He then cited an ex-
tract from a speech of Mr. Pitt?s, which recommended
a law of settlement for that country. The hon. gent
observed that it would be impossible to get over-
seers and churchwardens in several parishes in Ire-
land, unless the absentees were compelled to reside
on their estates, and if that were done, the country
would be happy and prosperous without any poor laws.
He maintained that the tendency of the poor laws in
Ireland would be to send the labouring classes over to
this country, for such law?s would diminish the price of
labour in that country, and consequently the induce-
ment to come to this country would be greater. If
the poor laws were established in that .country, the
labourers who should come over here w r ould remit their
earnings to their families, and then apply to a magistrate
to have them sent home at the public expense; even at
present there were many frauds practised in England
in that manner. The hon. member next alluded to the

worse, on account of absenteeism. These taxes were
ail paid by the poor, whereas they ought to be paid by
the landlord, which would afford much relief to the
labouring classes at the expence of absentees. The hon.
member here read extracts from the evidence of Mr.
Telford, before a committee of this house, in 1819,
respecting the state of Scotland, and also extracts
from evidence respecting the state of the poor in
Ireland, with a view to show the g�od effects of the
industry of the labouring classes. The honourable
member then read extracts from the evidence of
Mr. Griffiths, an engineer, who had ? travelled
through the south of Ireland, and described the la-
bouring classes as industrious, but not able to get em-
ployment. He would submit to the committee, if it
were granted, the state of public institutions in that
country, and the laws by which they were regulated ;
there were great restrictions on trade in Ireland ; th*
tolls paid on all commodities brought to market
amounted to five per cent, ad valorem. The exaction
of these tolls was attended with much oppression and
mal-practice; it was attended with fraud auff perjury.
It was stated in the house, two years ago, that oaths
were exacted from the persons called on to pay tolls,
when the Attorney General for Ireland said, that if
he knew any instance of such a practice, he would pro-
secute the party exacting such oaths. In a few days
after the Earl of CJancarty petitioned the house not to
prevent the exaction of such oaths, as it would be a

SITING ASSIZES.
THE (fboiNGLEY MURDERS.
WORCESTER, Thursday, March 11.
At half-past seven o?clock last night, the grand jury
came into court and returned the following biils, viz. :
a true bill against Thomas Clewes, George Banks, and
John Barnet, as accessaries before the fact, in the murder
ol Mr. Parker; a true bill against Thomas Clewt'B
(ignoring it as to the other two prisoners), as acces-
sary after the fact, in the murder of Mr Parker ;
and a true bill against Thomas Clewes (ignoring it as
to the other two prisoners), as principal in the murder
of Hemming.
In consequence of the return of these bills, the trials
were appointed to take place the first thing this morn-
ing, before Mr. Justice Littledale.
The counsel for the prosecution were Messrs. Cur*
wood, Wakeley, and Godson. For the defence, Messrs.
Serjeant Ludlow and Mr, Lee appeared for Clewes;
Me-srs. Cam ( bell, Russel, and Richards for Banks ;
and Messrs. Taunton, Shutt, and Holroyd for Barnet.
At a few minutes after eight o?clock Mr. Justice Lit-
tledale entered the court, and the prisoners were then
put to the bar for the purpose of pleading to the indict-
ments. Clewes appears io be an elderly man, but by no
means decrepit. Banks is a fine tall man, with promi-
nent features, and rather a striking countenance. Barnet
is an older man than Banks, and has a very respectable
appearance.
The clerk of the court then arraigned the prisoners,
who severally pleaded not guilty.
Clewes was then indicted as an accessary after the fact
to the murder of Mr Parker.
Mr. Sergeant Ludlow objected to Clewes?s pleading
to this indictment?Objection allowed.
It was finally arranged ihat Clewes should, in the first
instancei take his trial alone on the indictment, the ques-
tion on the coroner?s inquisition standing over for the
present.
Banks and Barnet were accordingly removed from the
bar; and the jury being sworn, they were charged with
the deliverance of Thomas Clewes for the murder of
Richard Hemming.
Mr. Curwood having stated the case for the prosecu-
tion, ca led his several witnesses.
Charles Burton said: I live in Smikehill, in this
county; I was employed by Mr. Howard to takedown
ft barn on the 28th of December ; 1 tems ber removing
the foundation near a small pool; it was some weeks
a ! ter I began to take down the barn. It was on a
Thursday in January, at four o?clock, 1 removed the
foundation. I found the remains of a human body, a
pair of shoes, and a carpentcr\2-feet slide rule. These
were 2 feet 6 inches below 7 the levei of the bay in which
they were buried. 1 did not proceed with ray work after
finding these things. I covered them up. Next m rn-
ing 1 went to Mr. Allen, at Droitwicb, and stated 1 had
found something. 1 afterwards went to a magistrate
in that borough. He sent me to Mr. Smith, the coroner.
This w'as on Friday, the 22d of January. I remember
Mr. Smith and Mr. Pierpoint coming there on the
Saturday morning 1 have known this barn 30 years.
It is situated on Nether woo'd Fa m. I remember
the Rev. Mr. Parker ; he was shot on the v 4th
June, to the best of my recollection, in 1806; I
knew 7 Richard Hemming ; he was married to my sister ;
he was a carpenter and wheelwright by trade; before
Mr. Parker was shot, Hemming was bving at Droil-
wich, which is nearly three miles from Oddmgley ; Mr.
P. was parson of that pari-h; I never saw R. Hemming
after Mr. Parker was shot: there was a great deal of
inquiry made after him; it was immediately after
Mr. P. was shot; I neve* siw Hemming after Mr. P.
was shot; at the time Mr. P. was shot, T. Clewes occu-
pied Netherwood Farm ; Hemmings.was five feet three
inches high ; he usually carried a basket with tools ; 1
do not know how long ?Clewes occupied this farm after
Mr. Parker?s death ; it might be four or five years ;
there was no fl or on the bay of the barn ; Hemminas
was a short stiff man; there was much stiff clay on the
bay of the barn ; it was loose marie where I found the
remains ; there were no remains of clothes, except part
of a cord breeches and some buttons ; I showed ihe re-
mains of Hemming as they were to Mr. Pierpoint he
surgeon.
Mr. Matthew Pierpoint, a surgeon, described the situ-
ation in which the remains (Tf the deceased were found,
and gave it as his opinion that the several fractures of the
bones of the skull were sufficient to cause instant death.
Eliza Newbury ; In the year 1806 I was the wife of
Richard Hemrnmgs; we then lived in tha borough of
Droitwich, in the parish of St. N cholas; he was a car-
penter and wheelwright; Mr. Pa ker was shot on the
24ih June, 24 years ago, next Midsummer-day ; I saw
my hU'band that morning; he left home about half-past
five in the morning ; he was dressed in a dark blue long-
topped coat; and to the best of my recollection corduroy
breeches ; he carried a rule in his breeches pocket at all
1 heard that Mr. Parker had been shot about
ten o?clock in the evening; 1 never saw my husband
afterwards. [A pair of shoes and a rule were shown to
hr, when she declared her belief that they were her
husband?s. J 1 know the prisoner at the bar ;?he came to
cur house three times to inquire for my husband; this
was some time before the dea h of Mr. Parker; 1 knew
of no cause of enmity between my husband and Mr.
Parker.
Thomas Barber? l live at the parish of Crowle ; I am
a victualler; 1 know Mr. Parker, and remember the
time of his death ; J also know the prisoner Clewes;

just as he was going out, Ciewe. came in, and said some-
thing about Parker in foul language, to the effect shat
there were 501. for any man who would shoot the parson,
Joseph Colley 1 am a little farmer ; in the year 1806
1 Jived in the parish of Hinley, the adjoining parish to
Oddingley; 1 have worked for the prisoner; 1 have seen
Hemmings and Clewes in comp my together at Droit-
wich and at the Chequers public house ; C ewes was
drinking with Hammings, and drinking ?to the death of
Buonaparte of Oddingley;? Hemmings said, 1 have a
nasty job to do at Oddingley, but it was too late to go to
do it then ; he said this to the company in the kitchen ;
this was about five o?clock in the afternoon.
Sarah Rogers?l lived at Oddingley till within these
eight years; 1 remember the time when the Rev. Mr.
Parker was i hot; 1 then knew 1 homes Clewes ; there
was a place called the pigeon-house upon Mr. Barnett?s
farm. There was a cellar under this pigeon house, in
which the cider was kept. 1 heard a great noise, and my
sister and I were sitting up late?about twelve o?clock.
1 sat under the trunk of a tree not forty yards from the
pigeon-house; 1 could hear what was passing there.
There were five people in the pigeon-house; I knew
their voices well enough to know who were there ; Mr.
1. Clewes was one of them ; I heard them drink ohq
another?s health ; and to the parson?s health they drank
fi to him left-handed; this might be about a
month before Mr. Parker wassho�.
(The trial was proceeding when our express left Wor-
cester.)
WORCESTER, March 10.
Michael Toll, aged 29, was placed at the bar, charged
with the wilful murder of a woman with whom he
cohabited, named Ann Cook, by beating her with a
stick, and then throwing her dewn a coai.pit at the
parish of Old Swindford. Evidence was offered, which
dearly established the guilt of the prisoner, and the
jury found him Guilty.
The learned judge put on the black cap, and, after
an impressive address, sentenced the prisener to be.
hanged on Friday next.
The prisoner, on the conclusion of the address, held
up his hand and exclaimed u I don?t deserve it.? He
appeared hut little concerned throughout the trial, and
was repeatedly observed to smile.
M aters v. Chambers. ? This long-litigated case
respecting the Opera House came again before the Vice
Chancellor on Wednesday, to settle the minutes and de-
termine the question of costs. The Solicitor General,
Sir C. Wetherell, Mr. Horne, and most of the leading
counsel were in the case, protecting the interests of
different parties. After a desultory discussion for
nearly two hours, no definite conclusion was arrived
at. Some points" were, however, determined, and the
remainder will either be settled between the parties, or
another day will be fixed for the final arrangement.
? A n(> yel case has been tried at tha Court of Common
1 leas ol Philadelphia. It appeared, that a man named
Pusey # hired a room from a man named August, for 15
dollars, for the purpose of giving a fashionable ball
to the black boiYton of the city. When the landlord
discovered the use to which his?room was to be applied,*
he seised on the refreshments for a balance of the
j-oom hire, which was due by the sub-tenant. These
refreshments were *wo demijohns of gin and six pound of
candles ! The seizure was so made with a view of pre-
venting the ball. The jury gave a verdict of 20 dol-
lars for the plaintiff. ?New York Paper .
Wednesday morning about seven o?clock, a fatal acci.

to the Hamburgh packet, William Jolliffe, off Dep?-
ford. The packet had been lying at Deptford for some-
time, undergoing repairs in her machinery. Mr. At-
kinson had the superintendence of the business, and
was in the act of lowering a Cylinder, when part
of the machinery, called tho ? shears,? gave way, and,
falling upon his head, he was knocked down into the
hold. The unfortunate man was taken on board the
Giampus Hospital-ship, where shortly after he expired,
from a severe fracture of tho head and concussion of
the brain.
