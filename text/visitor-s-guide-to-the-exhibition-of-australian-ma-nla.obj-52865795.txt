Dear Sir, —Please accept the following as a testimonial for
your Vitadatio.
Having suffered for ten years with Indigestion, and having
tried many so-called medicines, also consulted doctors without
getting any relief, I decided to try your Vitadatio, it being
recommended by a friend. After taking four bottles I was
completely cured, and now am in the best of health. I have the
greatest of pleasure in recommending Vitadatio to all who
suffer with Indigestion as an absolute cure. As I meet with many
who suffer with Indigestion, I always advise them to take your
medicine, and guarantee it to cure them. You can deal with
this as you please. Yours faithfully,
J. RUSSELL,

ONE PEOPLE -ONE STARCH.


THE MANUFACTURE OF STARCH.
A GREAT AUSTRALIAN INDUSTRY.
In the early history of the Australian Colonies no Starch was used
other than imported Starch—Belgian, German and English. And
the idea that Australia would ever he able to supply her own require-
ments by turning out a Starch superior to any made in the old world
would, at that time, have been scouted as absurd. But it was
not long before Australian Statesmen recognised the advantages
that would accrue to Australia from the establishment of industrial
enterprises within her boundaries. Facilities were then given to
Australian manufacturers and finally the manufacture of Starch
was commenced. In the early days great difficulty was found
by the first manufacturers in turning out an article thoroughly
satisfactory in quality, and it was, in fact, not until some seventeen
or eighteen years ago, when Messrs. Hobart Harper and Co., the
great inter-State manufacturing firm, took the matter in hand, that
these difficulties were finally overcome.. They commenced then the
manufacture of their well-known Silver Star Starch. Paying special
attention to quality they boldly announced that the Silver Star
Starch would compete not with the inferior lower priced Starches
then offering biit with the best Starches made in any part of the
world. The fight against old-established prejudice was a hard one, and
it was many years before the wail of prejudice was broken, and
it was admitted on all hands that the Australian “ Silver Star” Starch
was superior to any others, whilst the price at which it was sold was
lower than had ever been known for a first-class Starch in the history
of Victoria.
Since then many attempts have been made by foreign manu-
facturers to regain the market. Starches have been sent out here, at
prices very much lower than are charged in Europe, with the object of
capturing this market at any cost. These efforts have come to nought,
partly through the wisdom and farsightedness of our Australian states-
men, partly through the enterprise of the manufacturers engaged in
this industry. Australian women now almost universally use Aus-
tralian Starch, to the benefit of themselves a? housekeepers, wives, and
mothers.

The greatest benefactor to humanity is the individual endowed with special
gifts for relieving suffering and pain of any hind which man is heir to, and who
follows that profession or calling in which his talents lie. He should, however,
declare the fact to the world, so that all may have the opportunity of availing
themselves of his services.
Nota Bena —Mr. J, Rosier desires to call attention to the fact that having been
before the public since 1868, endowed with special aptitude, and with 37 years
of exceptional experience in dealing with all manner of cases, he stands without
a legitimate rival, and takes this opportunity, not of exhibiting specially got-up
samples, but orders made for customers in the ordinary course of trade, and
thanks his thousands of patrons, both past and present, and will endeavour to
merit their goodwill to the end.

cost neither momy nor trouble? How many thousands of
worthy men are there in Australia to-day vainly seeking
the work which is denied them through the thoughtlessness
of those who do not patronise the goods of Australian
manufacture?
How many are there who lament the dearth of employ-
ment and yet spend their lives in producing it?
That permanent prosperity for which we all yearn will
not be achieved until our people manifest their confidence
in themselves and their country by patriotically and wisely
resolving to patronise to the fullest possible extent their
own manufactures and products.
How indefensible it is that many of our manufacturers
dare not brand their excellent work as Australian for fear
of the thoughtless prejudice of their own kinsmen!
This Exhibition lias been organised by a committee of
gentlemen associated with the Civil Service Stores, with a
desire to demonstrate in the most effective manner the
variety and excellence of the manufactures and products
of Australia, and, further, to indicate how truly desirous
civil servants are to lend their aid in promoting the well-
being of the country in whose service they are spending
their lives.

Morris’s Imperial Eye Ointment
This Ointment was first manufactured by the late proprietor, Mr. David
Morris, about the year 1854 at Beechworth, Victoria, and was distributed
gratis to any friends or others who suffered from Sandy Blight or affections of
the eyes, which were so prevalent in those days in the colony. The Ointment
gained great renown in the Ovens and Murray district, and the proprietor was
strongly urged to place it on the market. It was not until the early seventies
that he did so, and the Ointment soon jumped into public favour, and the sales
rapidly exceeded the most sanguine expectations. These have been growing,
and at the present time the Ointment has displaced all imported articles. A
number of ointments and lotions have been placed on the market in competi-
tion, but all have failed, and the “IMPERIAL'’ is now regarded as the
standard eemedy throughout the Commonwealth. The family of the late
Mr. Morris now carry on the business under the style of Morris’s Imperiaj,
Eye Ointment Proprietary Ltd. at Salisbury Buildings, Queen and Bourkc
streets, Melbourne, and have established agencies in India and South Africa,
where the Ointment is freely sold and highly valued. The Proprietary hold
magnificent testimonials from all classes of the community, and readers are
invited to kindly visit the Exhibit and take an envelope containing interesting
information as to the Ointment and its curative qualities.

Extract from the “ INDUSTRIES OF MANCHESTER” 1888.
The high-class Whiskies supplied by this eminent firm have now a world-wide
reputation. The house was established in Glasgow in 1830, and the imprint of
Wm. Teacher & Sons, in the trade in which they occupy such a prominent
position, has become a synonym for purity and excellence. The Manchester
branch was opened about three years ago, and is now approaching in import-
ance the other offices in London and Glasgow. Amongst the prominent brands
of the firm is Teacher’s “Highland Cream,” which is protected by the Trade
Marks Act. The Australian Bonded Highland Cream Whisky is a leading
article in the London trade, and can bo sampled at the Loudon office, 26
Philpot Lane, E.C. The prices charged are moderate, seeing the great age of
their whisky, and the very large stock kept in bond and in duty-paid stores—
in fact the largest in Scotland—enables Messrs. Teacher and Sons to guarantee
a regular supply of a uniform quality, an all-important feature in this vastly
increasing tnide. And this they are enabled to do on account of the system
adopted by them, which is no other than that of laying aside immense stocks
of the best of each year’s make, and holding the same until matured, and
not purchasing odd parcels of the liquors in the market. Samples will be
submitted with confidence, and will merit the most careful consideration
and justify the high character for excellence claimed for the liquors of this
influential firm.

Report on Messrs. Wm. Teacher & Sons’ “HIGHLAND
CREAM” WHISKY.
I have made a minute and careful Analysis of a fair sample of Messrs.
Wm. Teacher and Sons’ “Highland Cream” Whisky, taken by myself from
a stock of about 000 Cases lying in bond ready for shipment, and I find that
it is a pure Whisky which has been matured in Wine Casks, and I am of
opinion that it is of good quality and excellent flavour.

John Fisher, Jun., Gal-
vaniser, &c., manufacturer
of Steel Trunks, Australian
Galvanising Works, 118 and
120 a’Beekett - street, Mel-
bourne. This extensive and
prosperous business was es-
tablished in 1884, a period
during which Victoria
passed through the most
severe depression of her
existence. Commencing on
a small scale, and with a
\ery limited stall' of assist-
ants, Mr. Fisher, Jun., has
since l that time gradually
improved his position as a
manufacturer until his
business has become one of
the leading industries of
the State, This has been
accomplished no loss by bis
zeal and enterprise than by
bis strict commercial integ-
rity and practical knowledge
of the requirements of the
trade in general, as he is
himself a thoroughly prac-
tical workman, with a wide
experience. The chief manu-
factures carried on at the
Australian Galvanizing
Works are galvanizing,sheet-
iron, tinplate, copper, and
brass • working, japanning,
blacksmithing, &c., and the largo and varied stock of all lines carried
enables him to promptly and satisfactorily execute all orders. This is to the
advantage of his numerous clients, who are thus enabled to always procure
fresh and clean goods at the shortest possible notice. Mr. Fisher claims for
his manufactures that they are not only well finished, but so constructed as to
please the eye of intending purchasers, an important factor in the satisfactory
sale of articles for everyday use. His japanned and galvanised goods are the
best in the market, and defy competition ; and he is the only authorised maker
of Hunter’s patent sanitary pans and covers, which are universally used where-
ever the double-pan system has been adopted—i.e., in nearly all Victorian
boroughs and shires, as also in other States. In fact, Mr. Fisher may claim
to have been the promoter of the sealed pan system, which is without doubt a
great improvement upon the old style of removing offensive refuse. The gal-
vanising plant at the works is always in full working operation, as he not only
carries out his own extensive orders in this line, hut those for the trade gene-
rally. A visit to the works, which Mr. Fisher cordially invites at any time,
will prove more effectually than words the extensive lines upon which this
industry is run. Mr. John Fisher, sen., who has had over forty years’ experi-
ence as manager in the galvanising trade, has been connected with the firm
from the commencement thereof, a fact which needs no further comment.
The Australian Galvanizing Works have in hand the largest stock of steel
sheets in the Commonwealth, of which inspection is invited frojn the trade
generally.

“ Yamala,” Franks ton, 29th Aug., 1897.
Dear Mr. Unsworth, —I have waited to see fully how the Bath
Heaters which you erected for me acted, before writing you the
letter which you desired I would write concerning my experience
of them. lam now quite prepared to state that they are in every
respect the best device for heating bath water (where hot water is
not regularly laid on) of which I have any knowledge. They are
simplicity itself as to management. With your little kerosene
attachment they are almost as rapid in firing as a gas heater, and
they are entirely free from the danger of causing death to people
with weak hearts which attends the gas ones when incautiously
used. They produce very hot water in a very short time, and they
are entirely free from danger of causing fire to the room in which
they are. In a word they are, in my opinion, the cheapest and
most real luxury which a country house could have; and I am
entirely satisfied with them. Very truly yours—John Madden.

Local Goods and Local Prejudice.
A prejudice, more or less pronounced, against local goods
obtains in many markets. “ Distance lends enchantment to
the view,” and customers are too ready to assess the value of
an article by the number of miles it has travelled. This is an
unreasoning and often an unwarrantable mode of appraisement.
The local production may be as good as, or even better than
the foreign production. If, as sometimes happens, it lacks the
polish of the outside competing article, it may be more service-
able, so that the buyer, to use the Scottish fisherman’s proverb,
“gains in hake what he loses in herring.” No doubt certain
countries and firms have special facilities or special faculties for
producing particular goods. It may not be possible to compete
with them on the ground which they have made their own, but
in general lines there seems no reason why one country should
not produce as good an article as another.
For some time now in Canada local manufacturers have been
endeavouring to break down any feeling of this kind, and to
foster in its place a patriotic sentiment in favour of native
products. A similar doctrine is beginning to find expression
here in Australia. In Now Zealand there is less need for it.
The products of that colony’s looms and factories are largely
used by the populace, who take some pride in the native output.

In Australia, however, while this prejudice is undoubtedly
dying, it is dying hard. Some manufacturers affirm that the
only way to place their goods is to hide the fact that they are
of local make. They either do not attach their names at all, or
if they label them with their names they have to be careful to
say that the goods are prepared “ for,” not by them. Against
their will, in the words of one local factory owner, they are
compelled “to sneak behind ingeniously worded labels in
order that the people may not suspect that they are buying the
wares which their fellows live by making.”
With a view to show what local factories can do in various
directions, and assist in popularising local manufactures and
products, an exhibition of Australian goods is being arranged in
Melbourne. It will be held in the town hall during the second
week of October. The accommodation is limited, but the space
available will be utilised to the utmost. Addresses by leading
politicians and others will be given during its currency, and
efforts made to secure a visit from the senior scholars of the
metropolitan State schools. It is hoped in this way to give old
and young an object lesson concerning the industries which
have been established in the country. The display is promoted
by several gentlemen connected with the Civil Service Stores,
Mr. T. M. Burke being the honorary secretary. Efforts in the
direction of overcoming the prejudice against locally-made goods
are also being made by the Victorian Chamber of Manufactures.
The council is arranging for addresses on the subject in various
centres of population. —Australasian Hardware a.nd Machinery,

THE
Victoria Varnish Co. Propy. Ltd.
A. J. BORTHWICK, Manager.
QUEEN’S BRIDGE, SOUTH MELBOURNE.
The above Company was founded by the late Mr. Alex.
Borthwick, in 1853, who had for half a century considerable
experience and knowledge of the manufacture of Varnishes,
Paints, &0., and early identified himself with the Painting and
Decorating trade of the States.
The Varnish Works are situated in Sturt Street, South
Melbourne, and the Paint and Dry Colour Works are conducted
at their premises, opposite the Queen’s Bridge. At both of
these premises the latest improvements in all kinds of
Machinery have been added, and the Company is therefore in
the very best position to manufacture and supply every de-
scription of Varnishes, Japans, Polishes, Wood Stains,
Lacquers, Dry Colours (for Painters and Lithographers),
Enamel Paints, Mixed and Ground Paints, Antifouling Com-
positions, &c.
They have been for over 17 years the principal Contractors
for Varnishes, &0., for the Victorian Railways, which Contract
they now hold ; they also supply, under contract, the Common-
wealth and Victorian Governments, and do a large trade with
the States and New Zealand.
At the Melbourne Centennial Exhibition, 1888-9, this
Company held the enviable position of being awarded the only
Gold Medal for Varnishes, in competition against the known
makers of the world, also received numerous medals, including
those of Philadelphia, Sydney, Hobart, &c.

■A.’l U X ill U Phosphated Food for Infants, Invalids and the Aged.
The excessive mortality amongst the infantile portion of our community
(due in the great majority of instances to improper feeding) has induced the
TURNER MANUFACTURING COMPANY LTD. to manufacture and place
on the Australian market an article of diet, the component parts of which
are of the very highest standard of Purity, as well as being absolutely Fresh,
due regard being paid to the climatic conditions of the Australian States.
“Nutrio” is an ideal food for Infants, Invalids and the Aged, and stands un-
rivalled as a Bone and Flesh developer, at the same time being nourishing and
correcting acidity of the stomach. It soothes the bowels, does not curdle,
repairs Wasted Tissue, and Strengthens’ the System generally. It can be used
by persons of all ages, and during convalescence from Diphtheria, Typhoid,
Scarlet Fever, and all wasting diseases, cannot be too highly recommended. As
a diet for persons suffering from Dyspepsia it is simply invaluable.
Sold by all Chemists, Grocers, and Storekeepers throughout the Australian

“ Imperial Shamrock ” Baking

This Baking Powder is introduced after a series of
practical experiments as an adaptable Powder for Scone and
quick light baking. So many of the Baking Powders are
defective in being either too Alkaline or too Acid. This
Baking Powder being neither, is sure to give satisfaction,
and as a quick scone maker, is simply perfect.
The Manufacturers are prepared to give demonstrations
on request to verify their assumption of superiority.

This company (formerly a limited liability company, with

mineral bitumen and allied products for nearly a quarter of
a century. It imports crude mineral asphaltum by cargo
from Trinidad, West India Isles, and refines to suit the con-
ditions of the Australian climate. It works limestone quar-
ries, and uses indigenous rocks and sands from different
States. Samples of its products in various stages of pre-
paration are shown.
Arrangements are in progress for the utilisation of this
company’s Melbourne and Sydney works for the purpose of
preparing bituminous limestones for vehicular road pav-
ings, such as are now employed in London, Paris, and
other old world centres. Samples of this material are
also exhibited.
This company is unprotected by duties. It is the only
Australian industry of its kind. It has an established con-
nection with public departments and corporations, and the
chief private architects.
Since the Melbourne International Exhibition of 1888—-
when it obtained the Gold Medal of its class—it has not
exhibited in Victoria, and it joins in this exhibition as
being one of special nature for the advancement of Aus-
tralian industries. It does not seek to do business with the

The Australian Tesselated Tile Co. Ltd.,
Mitcham, of which B. E. Walker is managing director, ia situated
13 miles from Melbourne, and has for the past seventeen years
carried on the manufacture of tesselated pavements, during which
period its progress has been marked with great success.
The advantages of local manufacture have evidently heen recog-
nised owing to the great support given hy architects and mer-
chants to this industry; the facilities offered enable them to carry
out their designs with the greatest freedom in the treatment of
the various lines, owing to the completeness with which the vari-
ous productions are handled. The beautifully rich and varied
coloured glazes are now extensively used in ail classes of archi-
tecture, and have been recognised as one of the most prominent
and artistic forms of tj*ue decoration. In regard to street archi-
tecture, one only has to look around this city at the buildings
now rising in rapid succession, and he then will fully recognise
the prominence that the glazes occupy in the field of design. In
this respect Melbourne is following in the lead of London and
other large cities of the world, where the COLOUB of architecture
forms such a prominent question, and the feeling that is steadily
growing in this respect calls upon the glazed tile to meet the
want, which it does in a far greater degree than would be possible
in any other composition, and so we find throughout the States
every good reason for the preservation of an industry that carries
with it not only the usual benefits to the employer, employee, and
general public, but in no small degree does it serve as a field for
the encouragement of high and artistic ideas, and for the deve-
lopment of a pure, honest, and decorative ornament.
The question of a suitable pavement for hospital operating
rooms and butter factories has received our special attention, see-
ing that a more serviceable article was required, with the result
that a pavement may now be had that is perfectly vitreous, non-
absorbent, thoroughly germ proof, always sweet in odour, and of a
wearing quality that has never been in doubt. Added to this are
the coves for angles, white glazed for walls, with fittings, which go
towards making the modern hospital and butter factory complete
in nearly every respect. Examples of this work may be seen in
many of our hospitals, including the Melbourne, Homoeopathic,
Women’s, &c„ the underground conveniences for the city council,
Eussell-street, the new central station, and butter factories at
Cobden, Traralgon, and Grasmere, &c.
Terra-cotta also forms an important branch of work for the com-
pletion of buildings; nothing appears to be more general in use
than this material, that lends such a glow to all around it, and
although it is somewhat of a luxury we find our hands kept
steadily busy, owing to the constant demand for this class of work.
In regard to the industry as a whole, we think that this short
review would be incomplete if we did not mark our high apprecia-
tion of the valuable encouragement we have received at the hands
of the public generally, and particularly of the architects, who
almost unanimously declare strongly for the use of the colonial
article. Were it not for this we feel there would be little hope of
any local industry, without good and sound protection, in endea-
vouring to build itself up against the cheapness and the strength
of the old and well-established markets at home.

A CHAT ABOUT . . .
FOOD P RODUCTS.
o
If consumers of food products were alive to their own
interests, the matter of quality would hulk much
more largely in their judgment than price. A
smaller quantity of a good article is more desirable
than a larger quantity of an inferior.
Quality is composed of two elements —form and
material or substance. Form comprises not shape
only, but general appearance, and in connection with
such food products as Biscuits, Cakes, Jams, and
Canned Fruits, it includes daintiness and the
inexpressible something that causes an article to look
toothsome.
Scientific investigation has proved that this
craving for daintiness in appearance of food is
not for the satisfaction of the artistic instinct alone,
for it is partly instigated by the digestive organs,
which perform their functions more efficiently when
the appearance of the food is attractive.


When the best form is united with the finest
materials, then a food is produced which satisfies
the mind and nourishes the body. On the other
hand, food products, when composed of inferior
materials, will in time work irreparable injury to the
human system.
These points should never be forgotten by
consumers of Biscuits, Cakes, Jams, and Canned
Fruits, and they should purchase only SWALLOW
& AEIELL’S, which, both in form and substance,
are undoubtedly the best in the Common-
wealth, the form being admirable and the substance
excellent.

Manager ■ R. A. PRYOR.

Started in 1882, in a small way, with a nucleus of skilled
workers imported from Londonderry, Ireland—chief seat of
British shirt manufactures—it has grown steadily to its present
large proportions by virtue of meritorious productions. Early in
its career, it secured the highest award (gold medal) at the
Melbourne Centennial Exhibition of 1888, and it has ever since
maintained the same high standard of excellence. Although per-
haps not equal in magnitude to the largest factories of its kind in
the Old Country, it has no superior there or elsewhere in up-to-
date equipment of plant and machinery.
But recently the manager toured Europe and America in
quest of the latest and most effective machines, and securing
such as in his experienced judgment would keep him to the
front, he had them installed in an extensive addition to the
premises, purposely designed and constructed for their reception.
With these, operated by a body of skilled workers, selected
after 20 years’ experience, it may be confidently accepted that
the character of its manufactures will incontestably justify the
name it bears—“ The Acme.”
Its manufactures do not reach the public directly, but
through the medium of the leading wholesale houses of the
Commonwealth, whose purchases reflect their opinion of the
best market value, irrespective of the locale of manufacture. It
advances no claim to public support on the plea of “ preference
to native industry,” but it counsels Protectionist and Freetrader-
alike, who desire to obtain the best value possible for their
money, to demand from their mercers, shirts and collars made
by the Acme Factory.

they will keep your room as cool as an icehouse, and free from Flies, Mosquitos,
and other pests, and will never get out of order.
Our Verandah Blinds being fixed on a new principle, are so perfect that a
child could work them even if caught in a storm. Our Patent Wire Roller
Blinds are a great boon and comfort. No intelligent person will use the old
framed blinds after they have seen our Patent Wire Roller Blind. These Wire
Roller Blinds can be rolled up like an ordinary linen blind. They should be in
every house. They will last for many years longer than any other wire blinds.
They can be made any size, from 1 to 25 feet wide, any length.
We can enclose the whole of your Verandah with our Patent Wire Roller
Blinds making it Fly and Mosquito proof. What a comfort would this he to
you. Before purchasing your blinds inspect the Iceberg Sunblinds.
N.B. —Keep this advertisement and present it when ordering blinds, and
you will be allowed 2| per cent, off the account. This is done for the benefit of
those who patronise this Exhibition.

ME. HIEAM JAMES PHILLIPS,
Whip & Thong Manufactures,
295 Lonsdale Street.
Mr. Phillips was born at Heathcote, Victoria. He went to his trade at the
age of fifteen, being apprenticed for five years to Mr. John Keaston, and on
the completion of his indentures remained with that firm for some years. He
then established himself in business on his own account at his present address,
where he has been located for the past ten years. It is a. matter of general
belief that all the best whips are imported from England and America, but this is
not so, and a visit to Mr. Phillips’ factory in Lonsdale-street is alone sufficient
to prove the contrary. At Ins establishment may lie seen the latest and most
up-to-date machinery for the manufacture of whips, of which Mr. Phillips
mates 700 to 1000 varieties, ranging in character and quality from the bullock-
driver’s whip, which is necesssavily of a formidable make and appearance,
to the lightest and daintiest whips for the use of fair equestriennes, and,
intermediately, whips of every possible description. It is only just to Mr.
Phillips to state that the vast experience necessary for the building up
of the seven hundred whips, each with its own particular shape, finish, and
“feel,” has been acquired by downright hard work, much thought aqd strict
detail; and it is owing to these efforts and qualifications that at the present day
he is a thorough master of the whip-making industry, which, through his
instrumentality, has been firmly established in Victoria. When he started
business in 1892 it was in a very small way, and he was thankful to receive an
order for a quarter, or at most a dozen whips at a time; now orders arrive
daily by the gross.

O.NE of tlie most striking illustrations of tlie advances which have been made
in education during recent years is seen in the introduction of manual train -
ing into both primary and secondary schools. Looked at, at first, by teachers,
somewhat askance, its usefulness and value, both educationally and practically,
are so obvious to the thinking* man that it has been rapidly received into
favour, and now forms an essential and much-prized subject of study in the
X>rimary schools of nearly every country in the civilised world.
In all the large towns of England, Canada, and the United States, the boy
attends the local centre as a matter of course, just as he does his lesson in
reading, writing, or any other subject; and so highly is the educational value
of Sloyd wood work axjpreciated in the latter country, that the subject is in-
cluded as an integral part of the curriculum in many of the High Schools, Public
Schools, and other similar establishments which x>rex>are the sons of the well-
to-do for the Universities.
It is, x>erhaps, only a natural fear that two or three hours a week devoted to
manual training might possibly cause a falling-off in some of the other subjects.
Experience, however, shows that not only is this not the case, but that after
the boy has been in attendance at a Sloyd course for some time he does his
other work with greater intelligence, keener interest, and, therefore, with less
trouble to his teachers and more xu'ofit to himself. As the Principal of the
Cleveland University School, one of the finest of its kind in the United States,
said“ The boy does his Greek better, not worse, for the manual training.”
Sloyd wood work was introduced into Victoria in 1902 by Mr. John Byatt, an
exx>ert from London, and at the present moment there are about 4000 boys
under instruction in the several centres scattered throughout the State. The
course includes making the drawings, and from them examines of all the
models shown in the exhibit, the scholar thereby gaining a good xn*actical
acquaintance with some half-a-dozen timbers and all the ordinary tools of a
wood-worker. The Education Department j>rovides all necessary tools and
timbers, and makes the merely nominal charge of twopence per week. Parents
who wish their boys to go through a course of training in Sloyd should com-
municate with the Head Teacher of the local State School, or with the Secre-
tary, Education Department,
All the models shown in this exhibit are the work of children, from ten to
fourteen years of age, attending the centres, and serve to show what a high
pitch of excellence has already been reached by the rising generation, To
consider the work for a moment from a purely practical point of view : The
majority of the boys in our State schools will presently become our craftsmen
and artisans, and looking over the models one cannot help thinking that before
long there will be no necessity to import “hatters” or “potters,” but that
Australian manufactures will be perfectly safe in the hands of Australian work-
men who have had such a splendid preliminary training as this,

' ' SPECIAL NOTE.
The CLOUDY AMMONIA (“RED STAR” Brand) about which you have
heard so much is shown here. It is acknowledged to he absolutely the best
obtainable throughout Australasia, yet sold at about two-thirds the price of the
imported article —its nearest rival. Fortunate are they who patronise local
industry, whereby they not only help their brother Australians, but make a
direct saving of, in this case, fully 50 per cent, themselves.
A Soap which will commend itself to all good housewives is also shown here.
This is known as the “STAR AMMONIATED COLD-WATER SOAP.” The
directions are Soak, Squeeze, Rinse, Wring. Could anything be more easy
yet less harmful* The constant use of this “Star” Soap by Medical Men,
Nurses, Hospitals, and Laundries is itself a sufficient indication of the estima-
tion in which it is held by those who can best judge of its merits.
Stocked by almost all Grocers, Chemists, and Stores throughout the States.
