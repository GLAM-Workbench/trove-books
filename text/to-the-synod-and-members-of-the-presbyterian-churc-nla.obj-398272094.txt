Recent events cause me to place before you some facts
to remind you of certain laws ignored ; of the shrinkage in
our endowments ; the selling of property and the mortgaging
of other beyond redemption.
In November, 1878, an Act of Parliament was passed
severing our connection with the parent church, Church
of Scotland. Under that Act, the following Trustees were
appointed, and in whom all moneys and properties were
vested, viz., James Whyte, James Tulloch, J. T. Robertson,
Alexander Webster, and Donald McKinnon. In the year
1882, James Whyte died, and in his stead Donald
McMillan was appointed. About the year 1882,
were borrowed on the St. John’s Manse and Church,
Macquarie-street, which up to that time had never
had a penny of debt upon it. In the same year, it was
agreed to lease the Glebe for 99 years; it was accordingly
leased ; certain restrictions were placed upon the lessees ;
and at the end of 99 years the whole reverted to the
Church. In the same year it was agreed to borrow upon
the Glebe £3, 500, which was accordingly done in the
year 1887; the borrowers being James Scott, Robert
Henry, and William Todd; the interest to be paid for the
said sum of 500 being ss. per cent, per annum.

In the year 1894 J. T. Robertson died, and Alexander
Riddoch was appointed a Trustee in his stead.
On the 25th March, 1895, application was made to the
Synod, on the motion of James Scott, seconded by the
Rev. Lyell, and carried, “That permission be given to
dispose by sale the interest in the Glebe, and hand over the
proceeds to the St Andrews’ Board of Management, who
were to invest the proceeds for the benefit of St. Andrews
Church, Hobart.”
In June, 1895, a conveyance was given to Mr. E. M.
Fisher of the whole Glebe land, consisting of to acres, for
the sum of ,£6,607 ; reserving, however, two schools and
the ends of several streets. The parties conveying the said
Glebe land, its hereditaments, and all interests therein,
being Samuel Tulloch, Alexander Webster, Donald
McKinnon, Donald McMillan and Alexander Riddoch,
Trustees; James Scott, the minister, and the following (the
Board of Management of St. Andrews Church, Hobart),
viz., J. R. Reid, James Reid, W. G. Hadrill, William Todd,
W. D. Hull, Hugh Hull, and G. A. McMillan.
The above may be obtained by search at the office of the
Registrar of Deeds, on payment of two shillings and six-
pence.
Would any other denomination have sacrificed so valuable
a property, which at the last assessment was valued about
£30,000? Are matters ecclesiastical, now no better than
they were in the days of Esau ? “Necessity knows no law.”
Since the year 1880 there has been a gradual shrinkage
of our endowment. In that year we possessed the sum of
7,866 in Debentures, maturing in the year 1900, and
bearing six per cent, interest and payable at the lieasury
every half year. Interest funded by the Rev. John Storie,
the late Minister of St. Andrew’s Church, Hobart, ajaaat


offered the Church ten per cent, premium to let their
Debentures mature, which was acceded to; and upon an
account given the sum of ,£8,541 was paid to James Beattie
and James Scott, on behalf of the Church. The various
sums above enumerated make the total of which
at five per cent, will realise the handsome sum of 777 P er
annum. I ask is it possible to show a third ot the capital
sum of £rsMs ? If the who,e can be shown > how is it;
that the late Minister of St. John’s Church. Hobart, got
only the beggarly sum of £2 per month, and that at long
intervals ? I know that the Glebe did not legally belong
to other than the St. Andrew’s Church. This, however,
• does not ignore the fact that we ought to have of
Debenture money, and St. John’s Church free of debt.
There are two Trusts held by myself and the late Minister
-of St. Andrew’s Church, Hobart, the Rev. John Storie.
is t The fund for relieving the poor, called the Hoy fund ;
the capital of which is £4s°* with accumulated interest
amounting no\V to about £6OO. 1 his fund should be held
by the Minister and two Elders of St. Andrew’s Church,
Hobart, and the interest thereof distributed by them.
Q uer y —Why is that sum still in our hands ? Has echo any
answer? 2nd —The Drummond fund. Ihis arose from
Mr. Drummond dying aids&t the year the sum
of £3OO, the interest of which was to go to the support of
the Rev. John Storie’s successor. At the present time there
is at least £3OO of accumulated interest. Now if James
Scott is the Minister of St. Andrew’s, I call upon him to
apply for that sum, which cannot be withheld from him.
If he does not require the money himself, surely he has got
a relative not in such lucrative circumstances as himself,
and to whom he can, without ostentation, send it as a
coming “ Christmas gift.” In these times the men are not
so numerous who will allow a legacy of £3°° t°b e a f the bank
to their credit and not apply for it. 1 here is a skeleton in


the cupboard. James Scott was never called, and never
inducted to the charge of St. Andrew’s. Hobart; and if he
cannot sign this short title—how is he giving a title to the
Glebe ?
I will now draw your attention to the laws of the Church,
page 9, rule 10. “ When Presbyteries, after due enquiry, find
a Minister’s usefulness in his congregation has been seriously
injured, the circumstances are reported to the Synod, which
may sever the pastoral connection.
Now if in a city charge, for months and months, only 50
people, and sometimes much less, are found—is that not a
case coming under Rule No. 10, page 9?
Rule ix, page 15. “The minimum stipend approved of
by the Synod is with a Manse.” Is this a rule, or is
it a farce ?
With all vengeance you have put into force Rule 9, page
11. “The Synod has a right to sit with closed doors.’ v
As a Synod have you got the courage to put into force the
seven rules on page 37, and those on page 40 ?
The denomination, as far as I am able to learn, is
absolutely ignorant for what purpose these moneys were
borrowed, and if they have been improperly used, then a
case should be stated and the matter dealt with before our
three Judges in the Supreme Court, and let them decide
whether matters have been carried on and settled according
to our laws, and in equity and good conscience.
Faithfully yours,
JOHN GELLIE,
Elder of St. Andrew’s Church, Hobart
Oct. 25, 1895.
