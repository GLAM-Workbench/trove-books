On the Relative Value oe Specimens oe Native Gold
FROM THE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES WHENCE IT IS BROUGHT TO
Market in these Colonies, Communicated to the Eotal
Society oe Van Diemen’s Land. By His Excellency Sir
W. T. Denison, E.E., E.E.B. [Bead 22 nd March , 1852.]
The circumstances in which these colonies are now placed give a special
interest to communications which may in any way tend to elucidate the structure
and combinations of the metals generally, more especially of that precious metal,
the discovery of which on the Main-land of Australia has been productive of such
serious effects upon the inhabitants of Van Diemen’s Land.
The extent to which Gold is daily bought and sold renders it very desirable to
establish, within as narrow limits as possible, the value of a commodity whose
intrinsic worth, great in itself, is very liable to deterioration by admixture with
foreign bodies.
I propose in this communication to bring before the Society the results of a
series of experiments which I have lately made, the object of which has been to
establish, as far as possible, some simple mode of determining the relative value
of the native Gold from the different countries whence it is brought to market ;
and, secondly, after having established this point in a satisfactory manner, to
point out also a simple mode of determining the value of mixed specimens or
samples of Gold, such as are brought to market, containing generally some
portions of quartz, or other extraneous material, mixed with the Gold, but not
chemically combined with it.
I do not bring these experiments before the Society as in any respect perfect,
but merely as indicating a course of investigation which may be pursued with
advantage; and I trust that others will not only follow up the course herein
marked out, but will turn their attention to the chemical analysis of the materials
found in connection with Gold, for by this only can positive and definite results be
obtained; although by the mode in which I have worked, the deductions are
sufficiently accurate to serve as a guide to persons engaged in the purchase and
sale of Gold, as a matter of mercantile speculation.
The first object to which I turned my attention was the establishment, if
possible, of the average value of the pure native Gold from the different fields, —
and when I use the term 'pure, I mean only that the specimens were free from
any admixture of extraneous matter, as quartz, &c. It is evident that if, by a
well-conducted series of experiments, it could be proved that the Gold from any
given locality was chemically combined in some fixed proportion with some other
metal, while that from another locality was alloyed, not only in different propor-
tions, but perhaps with a different metal, keeping yet its own combination uniform

and regular, within certain narrow limits, much would be done to establish the
mercantile value of the Gold from each of these districts. Again, should the
result of the experiments go to prove that the quality of the Gold varied very
much in the same district, it would be of use, inasmuch as it would prove the
necessity of a special investigation into the quality of each sample.
I think that the experiments which I have made are sufficient to prove, at all
events with regard to the Mount Alexander diggings, such a uniformity of
structure as is quite sufficient to form the basis of some calculations which will
very much facilitate the operations of those who are engaged in the sale or
purchase of Gold; but to this I shall allude more specifically hereafter. Before
I enter into the detail of these experiments, it may be desirable that I should
give some brief explanation of the different forms under which the Gold
generally presents itself. Gold is found in all cases in a metallic form, or,
as it is called, native Gold. In this state, however, it is by no means pure,
being generally combined chemically with some other metals, as platina, silver,
copper, &c.
In many instances it is brought to market in lumps, or “ nuggets ” as they are
called, which contain, besides the Gold alloyed with some metal, portions of
quartz or other extraneous material, forming the matrix in which the Gold was
originally deposited, or with which it had become combined accidentally. In
other cases it is brought to market in dust, or grains of a greater or less
degree of fineness, the product of the washing of the earthy strata in which
the Gold had been deposited, this dust of course containing more or less
extraneous matter, in proportion to the care with which the washing had been
conducted, and consisting very commonly of iron ore, sand, earth, particles of
quartz, &c.
The object of the experiments which I am now about to lay before the Society
was to discover the quantity of the alloy combined with the native Gold, in the
first place; and, having established this, to ascertain the amount of the extraneous
matter either in the lumps or the dust. Should Ibe able to show that this can
be done with facility, I shall have done something towards establishing a standard
by which the dealers in Gold may regulate their transactions.
Now, every material whose structure is definite has a given specific gravity;
that is, a given bulk of such material will weigh a certain number of ounces or
grains. The standard of comparison in all cases is water: a cubic foot of distilled
water, at a temperature of 60° of Fahrenheit, the barometer standing at 30 inches,
will weigh 1000 ounces; and this is taken as the specific gravity of water.
Tables of specific gravities are given for a variety of other substances, and
these tabular values are, in point of fact, the actual weights of a cubic foot
of each: for instance, the specific gravity of pure Gold cast is 19258; of pure
Gold hammered, or laminated, 19361. In point of fact, these numbers represent
in each case the weight in ounces of a cubic foot of this material; the greater
weight of the hammered Gold being due, as may be easily imagined, to the
compression of the particles, a greater number having been crowded into the
same space.
Gold, with the exception of platina, is the heaviest metal with which we are
acquainted : any admixture or alloy of the Gold with other metals will diminish
its specific gravity, and, as a matter of course, its value in some proportion to the
quantity, weight, and value of the metal with which it is combined ;—for instance
Standard Gold, as it is called, that is, the Gold of which the circulating medium


in England is composed, contains 2 parts of copper in 24 ; and the admixture of
this proportion of copper, a metal whose specific gravity is 8878, reduces the
specific gravity of Standard Gold to 17486, if cast; and to 17589, if hammered,
or laminated, as it is when in coin.
These are facts which have been carefully examined and recorded, and they
afford the principal elements which are required in discussing the subject,
affording a standard of comparison not only as regards the specific gravity
of metallic compounds, but as regards the exchangeable value of the precious
metal.
In carrying out a series of experiments as to the specific gravities of various
metallic compounds, my first object was to ascertain the degree of confidence
which I could place on a delicate apparatus which I have used on several occa-
sions for the purpose of ascertaining the specific gravities of bodies. A careful
comparison was first made of the various weights employed, and an experiment of
the amount of accuracy with which the specific gravity of a known material could
be determined gave me every reason to be satisfied with the character and
condition of the balance. The following detail will enable the Society to judge
how far this confidence was well founded. The standard value of Gold is
£3 17s. lOjd. per ounce, and according to this a sovereign should weigh 123'27
grains, and its specific gravity should be, as before stated, 17589.
Every day’s circulation, however, must diminish the weight of a sovereign,
though it does not affect its specific gravity. A sovereign, not of a very old
date, being placed in the scale, its weight was found to be 123T2 grains,
showing a loss of T 5 of a grain, while its specific gravity appeared to be 17588,
a difference from the standard specific gravity of too trifling an amount to
merit notice. Having thus shown that confidence might be placed in the
instruments employed, I will explain the mode in which the experiments were
conducted.
The specimens were first weighed very carefully, the balance being delicate
enough to turn with a very small fraction of a grain when loaded with upwards
of 2 ounces. The smallest weight employed was the -fa of a grain. The weight
being noted, the specimen was then suspended by a fine hair to a hook on the
underside of the scale in a glass of distilled water, care being taken to free it
from any bubbles of air which might perhaps exist in cavities on the metal, or
adhere to its surface. Allowance was made for the hair used in suspending the
specimen, and the weight with the necessary deductions was recorded. The
difference between the weight in air and the weight in water is in point of fact the
weight of a quantity of water equal in bulk to the specimen, and a simple pro-
portion will thus give the specific gravity, or the weight of a cubic foot of the
material experimented on, as follows : —As the difference between the two
weights is to the weight of a cubic foot of water, or 1000, so is the weight of the
specimen in air to its specific gravity; or, more shortly, if Wbe the weight of the
W
specimen in air, w that in water, G the specific gravity G x 1000.
Where the specimen consisted of dust, a small silver scale was suspended by
fine hairs to the under part of the principal scale, and exactly balanced when in
the water by weights, the amount of which was recorded. The dust was then
placed in the scale, and when the whole was accurately balanced, the sum of the
weights in the opposite scale, less the recorded weight of the scale itself, gave the
weight in water of the dust.

On reference to Table No. I, showing the value of alloys of Gold with Silver, it
will be seen that these American coins are not worth more than 10/. ss. 3d. and
41. os. Bid. respectively at the mint price of Gold and Silver; and therefore in
these colonies, where deduction must be made for freight, insurance, and other
charges incidental to the transmission of these coins as bullion, their market value
will be very much reduced : indeed, they appear to be inferior in value to the
ordinary California Gold, if we may judge from the sample, an analysis of which
is given further on in the proportion of 755. 3d. to 775. 2d. per ounce. If these
coins are to be taken as the representatives of a given number of dollars, the value
of that coin in sterling money would appear to be 4s. 1 \d. and 4s. o \d. The
specific gravities of these two coins approximate very nearly to each other, but
their actual value depends upon the character of the metal with which the Gold
is alloyed. This is a matter of importance, and the more so as an impression may
very probably exist that the more valuable the metal combined with the gold the
more valuable the compound will be; whereas the reverse is the case.


I have shown before that the specific gravity of pure Gold which, when cast, is
19258, and when hammered 19361, is reduced to 17486 in the one case, and to
17689 in the other, by an admixture of one-twelfth part of Copper at a specific
gravity of 8878. Now the value of Copper in the state of coin as compared with
Gold may be taken at ; and as the value of 480 grains of Standard Gold,
consisting of 440 grains of pure Gold and 40 of Copper, is 775. 10'5c7 the Gold
in the compound is worth 775. 10‘42 d., while the Copper is not worth more than
•08 of a penny. Pure Gold may then be taken to be worth 2 , 1237 d. per grain, and
in all the calculations into which the value of Gold enters this will be used as
representing it.
When, however, Gold is alloyed with any other metal, of course a separate
calculation will be required; and as the Gold of California and Australia is
combined very generally with Silver, it will be desirable to determine the amount
of that metal which, when mixed with pure Gold, will bring down the specific
gravity to that of the standard, viz., 17486. The specific gravity of Silver is given
in the Tables as 10474 ; and the following formula will, when the proper substitu-
tions are made, give the amount of Silver contained in any specimen of mixed
Silver and Gold whose specific gravity is known. Let xbe put for the weight of
Silver in the compound, S the specific gravity of Gold = 19258, s the specific
gravity of Silver = 10474,/ the specific gravity of the compound in this case
17486, c the weight of the compound, or 480 grains—
x rs —4t c .. xin this case will be equal to 58 grains ; there will therefore
(S — s)j
be 422 grains of Gold and 58 grains of Silver in a specimen of mixed Silver
and Gold weighing 480 grains, and whose specific gravity is 17486. In this
case the Silver is pure; and in order to decide as to the market value of this
ingredient, it will be necessary to ascertain the amount of alloy by which pure
Silver is reduced to standard, the value of which, at the established ratio which
it bears to Gold, namely, 1 to 15£f, is 60 - 78 d., or about 60|d per ounce. The
proportion of Copper which is introduced in order to lower pure Silver to standard
is fa; that is, 37 parts of pure Silver and 3of Copper make 40 parts of Standard
Silver: the value of this compound is, as we have seen, 60’78d. per ounce, of
which 444 grains consist of pure Silver, and 36 of Copper. The value of the
Copper is 36 x ‘OO2 = -072. The value of the Silver is equal to
60-78d—-072 60‘708d ,
7-7*7 = —. . . - 0-13678 of a penny per gram.
444 444
As there are 58 grains of pure Silver and 422 grains of pure Gold in an
ounce of the mixed metal, whose specific gravity is 17486, the actual value of the
compound will be—

And as the value of the same quantity of i
Standard Gold alloyed with Copper is J
The difference, or . . «2 637
is the measure of the inferiority of the value of this alloy of silver as compared
with that of Copper in the Standard Gold coin of England.
This result is easily explained, for it is evident that the lighter the material
combined with the Gold, the less amount will be required to reduce its specific


gravity, and, therefore, that the compound will contain more of the most
valuable metal, and less of the inferior.
Silver, with the exception of platina, is the heaviest of the metals usually found
in combination with Gold ; and as the value of platina is equal, if not superior, to
that of Gold, it is not of importance, in a mercantile point of view, to attempt to
determine a matter which can have little or no effect upon the market price of a
commodity. I have therefore assumed that Silver is the alloy generally found
with the native Gold both of California and these colonies. It is known to be the
case as regards California; and in taking it for granted here, any calculations
which I may make will err in defect rather than in excess.
The following experiments were made for the purpose of determining the
specific gravity of different specimens of Gold completely free from extraneous

It may fairly be assumed from these experiments that the specific gravity of
the Gold from Mount Alexander ranges from 18176 to 18703, and, therefore, that
in its pure state, unmixed with any extraneous matter, its value exceeds that of
Standard Gold; while, as far as can be judged from the few experiments which I
have been able to make, as well as from the returns which have been furnished to
me of the actual chemical analysis of certain specimens, the Gold from California
will range in its specific gravity from 17272 to 17809. I have not data at present
to determine the matter more closely. The following Table has been computed
in order to enable any person to ascertain at once the amount of Gold and Silver
contained in an ounce of mixed metal of various specific gravities ranging from
18500 down to 17100, and at the same time the actual value of the compound at
the rates before stated. The range of the Table is limited, but it is hardly
probable that any native Gold will fall below 17100, or exceed materially 18500.
It would, however, should such a case occur, be easy to extend the Table, for it is
evident from an inspection of the column of differences, that there is a steady
law of progression, the differences being nearly constant.


Having thus arrived at the value of specimens of Gold alloyed with Silver, but
unmixed with any earthy or stony particles, upon the supposition that the
specific gravity of such specimens can be obtained to a moderate degree of
accuracy, the next step is to determine the amount of extraneous matter in
specimens containing evidently masses of quartz, or other analogous material, and
the reduction in value consequent upon such an admixture.
In order to arrive at a reasonable amount of accuracy in such a calculation, it
will be necessary to assume an average specific gravity as that of the unmixed
native Gold of any given district: —

For instance, from the above experiments, it may be assumed that the average
specific gravity of Mount Alexander Gold, is 18338*75, or say 18300. If, then,
this be taken as the starting point, it will be easy to calculate the reduction in the
specific gravity caused by the presence of extraneous matter, on the supposition
that the specific gravity of such matter be known. Now, as a general rule, this
matter may be taken to be quartz, or some material nearly allied to it. Clay and
sand can be removed by washing, and need not, therefore, be noticed. The
stony particles imbedded in the Gold are of such a character as to differ little
from quartz in weight. The following experiments were made in order to deter-
mine the average specific gravity of auriferous quartz:—

the value of the Gold is deduced from
This Table needs but little explanation :
that given in the former Table opposite the specific gravity 18300, which is here
taken as the point of commencement. It will be seen on inspection that a large
decrease in the specific gravity of a sample does not produce a corresponding
diminution in its value; for instance, a decrease in the specific gravity from 18300
to 12000, or upwards of 33 per cent., only takes off about 10 per cent, of the
value.
The following experiments will show the extent to which the Table may be
trusted in determining the quantity of Gold in any mixed specimen :

By referring to the Table it will be seen that a specimen whose specific gravity
is 14000 contains 24"61 grains of quartz in an ounce; as this specimen weighed
1375 grains, the quantity of quartz, according to the Table, would amount to 70 49
grains while by independent calculation the quantity was found to be 69"835 grains,
a difference not worthy of notice.

These same specimens on being fused in a crucible, and when the slag which

This Gold-dust being fused into a button of Gold, and cleaned from the slag,
weighed 955 grains, the difference between this and the original weight being 5 - 43

possible that the specific gravity of the matter in combination with the Gold was
inferior to that of quartz, in which case it would less to require bring down the
specific gravity to the point shown in the experiment.

These specimens being apparently clean, it would appear that there is something
in the arrangement of the particles in a crystalline form which tends to diminish
the specific gravity of the mass; or, what is perhaps more probable, that there is
a central nucleus round which the particles of Gold have arranged themselves in
a crystalline form.
The previous experiments and the deductions from them, especially as regards
the comparative amount of Gold and extraneous matter in mixed specimens, apply
in strictness only to Gold from Mount Alexander; but there is much that will
apply to Gold from California and New South Wales; or, indeed, to that from
any part of the world which is alloyed principally with Silver.
I have not been able to procure specimens from California or from Sydney
sufficient to enable me to carry on a series of experiments with regard to them,
but I am in possession of the analysis of a considerable quantity both from
California and Sydney; and it will be interesting to compare the results obtained
by analysis with those which I have deduced from my experiments, and the
Society will then be able to judge of the amount of confidence which can be
placed in the Tables which form part of this communication.
First, with regard to the Gold from California.
The quantity of metal forwarded to the assayer was 211 b. 9oz. 6 dwts.; this,
when melted and cast into an ingot, weighed 21 lb. 1 oz. Odwts. 12grs., showing
a loss from the presence of extraneous matter of 8 oz. 6 dwts. 12grs. Upon
analysis this quantity of metal was found to contain 527 dwts. of pure Silver, or
at the rate of 21 dwts. 13 grs. in the pound; or the proportion of Gold to Silver
in metal was as 9 - 3 to 1.
If a reference be now made to the first Table to ascertain the specific gravity of
a specimen in which the Gold bears to the Silver the proportion stated above,
which, when ounces are taken as the total weight, will be equivalent to 433'4
grains of Gold to 46‘6 of Silver, we shall find that it lies somewhere between
17700 and 17900; and by making the proper allowance for the difference, the
actual specific gravity will be 17809.
Now, the value given in the Table of an ounce of Gold alloyed with Silver,
whose specific gravity is 17 809, is 775. 2 79 d.; and in reference to the return of
sales it was found that 21 lb. 1 oz. 0 dwts. 12 grs. of mixed metal was valued at
960 Z. ss. 3d., which is at the rate of 755. 10'8d per ounce: the value of the
Standard Gold, however, is taken in this return at 775. 9 d., whereas in the Tables
it is calculated at 775. 10-sd, or lsd, per ounce more. The value too of standard
Silver is taken at 60|, whereas in the Tables it is taken at 60 Making allow-
ances for these differences, the value of the mixed metal will be 775. o‘4 d. per
ounce, which approximates very closely to that given in the Table. From this it
appears that Gold from California, having a specific gravity of 17800 or there-
abouts, is inferior in value to the Standard Gold coinage of England to the extent
of about Is. per ounce.


With regard to the Sydney Gold, the data in my possession are not so precise
as with reference to Californian Gold : they consist of account sales extracted
from the “Sydney Morning Herald,” and republished in the “ Courier newspaper
of 17th March. From this it appears that eleven large pieces of Gold weighed
before melting 4 Ib. 20z.; after melting 31b. 6 oz. 15dwts. 12grs., showing a
loss of 7oz. 4 dwt. 12grs. On assay these were found to be equal to 31b. 7 oz.
17 dwts. 9 grs. of Standard Gold. The quantity of Silver contained in these
specimens is not given, but it may be got at by reference to the I able : thus,
31b. 7 oz. 17 dwts. 9 grs., at the tabular value of 775. is worth a certain
sum, but 3 lb. 6 oz. 15 dwts. 12 grs. of native Gold is of the same value,—there-
fore one ounce of the latter will be worth 795. B‘79d; and on reference to the
Table the specific gravity of Gold alloyed with Silver, worth 795. 8*79 d., is 18255,
and the quantity of Silver contained in an ounce 31'47 grains.
Some small pieces of Gold weighed before melting 11 lb. 3 oz. 18 dwts., and
after melting 101 b. 8 oz. 14 dwts. 12 grs., showing a loss from the presence of
extraneous matter of 7 oz. 3 dwts. 12 grs. On assay these were found to be equal
to 11 lb. 0 oz. 7 dwts. 15grs. of Standard Gold; and the value of an ounce of
metal is from this 80s. 1’04d., and its specific gravity 18319.
Again, two lumps of Australian Gold weighed before melting 5 lb. 4 oz. 0 dwts.
12 grs. After melting 4 lb. 9 oz. 16 dwts. 12 grs.
The difference, 6 oz. 4 dwts., is the amount of extraneous matter. The assay
showed these specimens to be equal to 4 lb. 10 oz. 12 dwts. 22 grs. of Standard
Gold; and the value per ounce will therefore be 795. 11’fid., and the specific
gravity 18300.
These latter results, agreeing as they do with each other, and with those
deduced by experiment upon the Gold from Mount Alexander, establish beyond
a doubt the relative value of the Australian Gold. It would be desirable of
course to ascertain whether the Californian Gold, of which the assay has been
given, was a fair average specimen; but this can only be arrived at by more
detailed experiments. The only two specimens which I have been able to
procure gave specific gravities of 17272 and 17625 respectively; the former
probably containing some small amount of extraneous matter. We have no exact
information as to the character of the extraneous matter in these specimens of
Gold submitted to analysis, but if we assume it to be equal in gravity to
quartz, we shall not be far wrong; and the following comparison will be
interesting:—
The weight of all the specimens of Australian Gold was 201 b. 9oz. 18 dwts.
12 grs.; the weight after melting 191 b. 1 oz. 16 dwts. 12 grs. The weight of
extraneous matter 1 lb. 8 oz. 1 dwt., equal to 38'6 grains to the ounce. On
reference to the second Table, it will be seen that the specific gravity of a mixed
specimen containing 38 - 6 grains of quartz to the ounce will be 12369, and its
value 735. 6‘6d. per ounce. The value given in the return as that of all the
specimens is 913£. 10s. 1 d.\ but Standard Gold is taken at 775. 9cZ., while in the
Table it is valued at 775. Making allowance for the difference, the return
from this Gold would be 914 i. 9s. id., or at the rate of 735. 4 - 46 d. a result very
slightly different from that given in the Table.
The conclusion which I should be disposed to draw from the experiments which
I have here submitted is, that the value of specimens of Gold, carefully washed
and freed by the use of the magnet from magnetic iron ore, can be estimated with
every necessary degree of accuracy by means of delicate scales; the specific


gravity being an accurate test not only of the amount of extraneous matter
mixed with such Gold, but also of the character and value of the metal itself.
The subj ect, however, is far fi’om being exhausted. Accurate experiments on
the specific gravity of Californian Gold are much wanted : analysis of Australian
Gold, showing all the elements which enter into its composition, will be moat
valuable : inquiries into the molecular arrangement of those specimens which
appear to be crystallised will be very interesting.
I trust, therefore, that other members of the Society will turn their attention
to these points, and to such others as may appear to them to be of importance,
and communicate the results to the Society ; while I for my part will continue
the series I have already commenced, extending it so as to include Sydney and
Californian Gold, or that from any other country from which I am able to procure
specimens.
