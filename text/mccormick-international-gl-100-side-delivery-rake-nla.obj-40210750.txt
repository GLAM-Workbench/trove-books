GL-100 SIDE DELIVERY RAKE


TO THE OWNER
The GL-100 Side Delivery Rake is a tractor-drawn machine capable of
fast efficient raking. It places the mown crop in long windrows on a
clean stubble and gives best results when travelling on the same
direction as the mower.
It is equipped with a four bar reel and the angle of the teeth can be
quickly adjusted by means of a ball bearing eccentric controlled by an
adjusting screw. Quick-attachable teeth are provided and should
breakage occur, a tooth-keeper prevents the broken section from falling
in the hay. Tne front or rear end of the reel can be raised or lowered
Independently as required.
The main wheels are equipped with 6.00 x 16 >+ ply pneumatic tyres,
*f.oo x 12 h ply pneumatic tyres are provided on the rear caster wheels.
Two caster wheels are provided as regular equipment.
The main drive bevel gear and pinion are fully enclosed providing
protection from dirt and wear.
The tractor hitch can be shifted to the right or left to give the
desired line of draft, and the length of the front and rear lifting
levers can be adjusted for convenient operation from the tractor seat.
The GL-100 Side Delivery Rake consists of the following:-

INSTRUCTIONS FOR ADJUSTING AND OPERATING
(setting Up Instructions are on page 8)
LUBRICATION
All bearings are provided with grease nipples. Use a grease gun on
these nipples TWICE DAILY.
Grease nipples will S'- at the following polnts:-
V in eccentric arm crank bearings.
8 in reel head bearings.
2 in reel tooth shaft eccentric,
1 in clutch bevel gear. (Remove, gear frame cover)
1 in reel drive sprocket and gear. (Remove gear frame cover)
2 in main axle box.
h in reel shaft centre support bearings.
1 in reel shaft bearing, rear.
1 in gear frame.
1 in countershaft bearing oil pipe.
1 in idler sprocket spindle,
2 in caster wheel axle brackets.
2 in main wheel ratchets.
2 in caster wheels.
Care must be taken to see that all bearings are thoroughly lubricated.
Make sure that all grease nipples are free from paint or dirt so that the
grease can get down into the bearings. Force grease into the bearings
until it begins to appear at the sides. r
GREASE IS CHEAPER THAN REPLACEMENTS.
IMPORTANT
This machine is shipped without oil in the gear-box. Before operating
fill with one pint of SAEI4O, Inspect at regular intervals and replenish
when necessary.
CLUTCH LEVER
The clutch lever has two positions - neutral position, see must. 1,
and raking position, see Illust. 2,
Always stop the machine before shifting the clutch from one position
to the other. s

ILLUST. 3
REEL ADJUSTMENT
REEL
Before starting set the clutch lever in the neutral position and turn
the reel a few times by hand to make sure it moves freely.
The reel can be raised or lowered by means of the front and rear lift
levers. When raking set the front end of the reel slightly lower than
the rear end. Do not set the reel any closer to the ground than is
necessary to gather the hay.
The angle of the teeth is regulated by means of the eccentric
adjusting screw, "A-1", Illust. 3. In normal raking conditions set the
teeth slightly ahead of the vertical position. In heavy conditions set
the teeth further ahead and in light crops set the teeth back. The
operator, however, must use his own Judgement in keeping the teeth at the
proper angle for test results.
When transporting set the teeth back as far as possible,
A tooth keeper, "A-2", is provided for each pair of teeth. Should
accidental breakage occur, the keeper prevents the broken section from
falling into the hay.
SLIP CLUTCH
A slip clutch drive is provided for the reel to prevent damage should
any obstructions be encountered while raking. Before starting a new
machine turn the reel by hand and force the clutch to slip a few times
to make sure it is not stuck with paint. In subsequent seasons make sure
it is not tight with rust. The tension of the slip clutch must be
adjusted Just tightly enough to prevent slippage in normal working
conditions. Tension adjustment is made by tightening or loosening the
horned nut, "A-3", as required. DO NOT TIGHTEN THE CLUTCH UNLESS
POSITIVE THAT IT IS NECESSARY TO DO SO.


ILLUST. 4
GEAR BOX DRIVE CHAIN ADJUSTMENT
DRIVE CHAINS
The drive chains must be adjusted to have a slight amount of slack.
Too much tension causes undue wear on the chain and sprockets, wasteful
friction on the bearings and Increases the draft of the machine. Not
enough tension may allow the chain to jump the sprockets, ride the teeth
and break or whip excessively.
The tension of the reel drive chain is altered by loosening the nuts,
"A-V and adjusting the reel shaft bearing support adjusting bolt, "A-5"
After adjustment is made, tighten nuts securely. Always assemble the
reel drive chain with the hook end forward and the slot side out.
The tension of the gear box drive chain is adjusted by means of the
idler sprocket, Illust. l f.
Always assemble the gear box drive chain with the round end of the
connecting link spring clip facing the direction of travel.
WHEELS
Inflate tyres on main wheels to a maximum pressure of 20 lbs, per
square inch.
Inflate tyres on caster wheels to a maximum pressure of 25 lbs. per
square inch.
If the main wheels should slip when working in greasy conditions,
additional traction can be obtained by filling each tyre with 5 gallons
of water and Inflating to a pressure of 15 lbs. per square inch.
THIS SHOULD NEVER BE NECESSARY IN AVERAGE WORKING CONDITIONS.


IULUST. 5
ADJUSTING LEVERS
HITCH ADJUSTMENT
The tractor hitch can be shifted to the right or left to obtain the
desired lln» of draft by using the holes provided in the draft frame,
must. 5.
TRACTOR LEVERS
After hitching the machine to the tractor adjust the levers, "C-2",
for convenient operation.
This is done by loosening the latch rod clamps. "G-3", and bolting the
levers and lever extensions together at a length that will make the levers
within convenient reach of the operator.
NOTE; Before making any lever adjustments, be sure the lever plungers
fit securely into the notches in the ratchets. After the levers are
adjusted to the required length, tighten the latch rod clamp bolts
securely,
TRANSPORTING THE MACHINE
When transporting the machine make sure the clutch lever is in the
neutral position and the reel is raised to its highest position. Set
the reel teeth as far back as possible.

Avoid Accidents
Most accidents, whether they occur in industry, on the
farm, at home, or on the highway, are caused by the failure
of some individual to follow simple and fundamental safety
rules or precautions. For this reason most accidents can be
prevented by recognizing the real cause and doing something
about it before the accident occurs.
Regardless of the care used in the design and
construction of any type of equipment, there are many
conditions that cannot be completely safeguarded against
without interfering with reasonable accessibility and
efficient operation.
A careful operator is the best insurance against an
accident.
The complete observance of one simple rule would
prevent many serious injuries each year. That rule is:
“Never attempt to clean, oil, or adjust a machine while
it is in motion, or in danger of being put in motion
