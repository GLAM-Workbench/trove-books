“It seems to me certain that
Australia has even more at stake in
this war than has Britain; that her
very existence depends on its being
carried through to a clean finish;
that the worker has more at stake
in the war than any other class in
the community; and that no sacrifice
is too great which will rid the
Empire, to which we owe everything,
of the hideous Teutonic menace.”
—From “Australia and the War"
By ARCHIBALD T. STRONG
(George Robert ton & Co., Publithert).

A MESSAGE.
Fellow Australians—
You are asked to assist in obtaining Reinforcements for
the Australian Army in France. Our Country has during
the course of this war shown great resources in men and
money, but further effort is necessary. For her honour
and for the sake of her sons who are fighting and have died
in a noble cause we must endure to the end.
Our thoughts are with our sons and brothers at all times.
Let us have peace before another Christmas comes.
I ask you to help in bringing this war to an early termina-
tion, and I make this appeal with full reliance upon your
Loyalty and Patriotism.
Director-General of Recruiting,


AUSTRALIA’S PERIL IS REAL.
Nearly two and a half years of war have made the fact
loom up large that Australia’s Peril is Real.
The war is no longer what it was thought to be at first,
a Cakewalk from the German border to Berlin. It is
the actual death-grip of nations fighting against tyranny
and for the maintenance of Freedom.
Great Britain is fighting as much for her Overseas
Dominions as for herself. This is why the Overseas
Dominions should help, and this is where Australia comes
in.
German submarines swarm like sharks in the Northern
Seas. If the Allies are beaten, they will become pilot fish
to steer German Dreadnoughts to the South. That would
be Australia’s doom.
So, not only Australia’s duty, but her welfare —even het
very existence —demand that she should persevere.


A NEW YEAR’S GIFT.
EVERYBODY A VOLUNTEER.
Men and women, old or young, city or country. You
are requested to enroll your name as a member of the
Recruiting Committee in your district. To do so, fill
in this :
To the Hon. Donald Mackinnon,
Director of Recruiting, Melbourne.
I volunteer to be a member of the Recruiting Committee
in my district.
Name
Address
(Fill in enclosed form and post to Director-General of
Recruiting, Victoria Barracks, Melbourne.)
Every man or woman answering this call will do a service
to the Empire. What you will be asked to do :
Ist. Attend a meeting in your district.
2nd. Inform the Chairman of the District Committee
how you can help to win the war.
3rd. Work heartily to obtain recruits.


As Director-General of Recruiting in Australia I am doing
my best to secure volunteers; I cannot succeed if the
people do not answer this call. You are wanted because
you really can help. To forward your name is the least
possible effort you can be called upon to make. Your
name as a volunteer on the local Recruiting Committee
will be of the greatest value. Do not be the judge of your
own value; we know your value; that is why we call on
you. Do not tell anybody, “ I don’t think this is any
good,” because if you do you will be wrong. Do not say,
“ What’s the good of sending my name, lam already help-
ing.” That’s the soundest reason for sending your name.
You will not be asked to do too much, but you are asked
not to fail to forward your name quickly.
DONALD MACKINNON,
Director-General of Recruiting.
Remember —In becoming a soldier you retain in full youl
status as a citizen.


STATE RECRUITING COMMITTEE OF VICTORIA.
Universal Chambers. 325 Collins-street,
Melbourne, 21st December, 1916.
Dear Sir,
The medical examinations carried out under the Procla-
mation issued on 2nd October have removed a good deal
of misunderstanding as to exactly what number of single
fit men are available in Victoria for service abroad.
As you know, it has been decided by the people of
Australia that it is to be left entirely to your own conscience
to say whether you shall throw in your lot with your
fellow-Australians who are now doing such magnificent
work at the Front in defence of Australia and the Empire.
No doubt you appreciate this freedom of thought and
action which the country has granted you, and we con-
fidently appeal to you, in the same way as we appealed
to the 80,000 Victorians who have already left our shores,
to study the present position earnestly and make up your
mind to become a member of the great Australian Imperial
Force with as little delay as possible.
Those of you who have already had training will find
it easier to join the A.I.F. now that you know something


of camp life and have had an opportunity of making friends
with the many fine fellows whom you met with there.
The Australian Army is the best paid force in the world
and the best looked after, apart altogether from the lifelong
honour which is attached to the position.
Can we depend on YOU ? Perhaps you have a mate
who will come along with you. You may be sure that as
volunteers the Anzacs will welcome you into their
battalions ; and the pleasure, interest, and honour of your
experiences abroad will be something to look back on in
after years.
Will you make a New Year resolution to carefully
consider the claims your country has on your services in
this time of national peril ?
If you cannot enlist at once, or if there is any matter
that we can explain to you in connexion with enlistment,
please let us know.
Yours faithfully,
State Recruiting Committee op Victoria,
GEO. H. WISE, M.H.R.,
Chairman.

VOLUNTARY RECRUITING ARRANGEMENTS.
Commonwealth of Australia.
Department of Defence,
Head-Quarters,
Circular No. 7. Melbourne, Bth January, 1917.
Commandants,
All Military Districts.
It is desired that you personally consult with the State
Recruiting Committee on the points referred to below, and
if it is considered that the adoption of these proposals or
any modification of them will be any aid in the furtherance
of recruiting, the necessary action will be taken by you in
such direction, and the matters approved should be given
mil publicity through the press.
1. Each recruit when volunteering is to be asked to
express his preference for the arm of the service
that he wishes to join, and the particular unit to
which he desires to be allotted. This will be
inserted at the head of his attestation sheet and
application form for enlistment. Each recruit
will be allotted to the arm or unit he prefers as
far as vacancies permit. No difficulty in this
respect should occur in the allotment of men as


reinforcements for any particular infantry or
pioneer unit. If the arm of the service preferred
by a recruit is full, volunteers should be urged to
waive their preference so that the urgent need
for men should not suffer.
2. The wishes of friends and companions to be allotted
to the same tent, hut, section, or unit are to be
complied with.
3. Men belonging to the same occupation or in similar
employment, or men from the same locality, are
to be allotted to the same unit, and they may
enlist together provided they can form a rein-
forcement draft of 150 men. Such a draft may
go into camp as a separate reinforcement unit,
be trained together, and embark together. An
appeal should be made to the following classes
to form separate reinforcement units :
Warehousemen, sportsmen, stockmen, far-
mers, artisans and builders, rifle clubs
universities and high schools, saw mil-
lers and timber men, bankers and ac-
countants, labourers, clerks, and so on.
4. To provide for the provision of reinforcements on a
territorial basis, each Federal Electorate Com-
mittee should be informed of its monthly quota


to maintain infantry reinforcements, and as far
as practicable an attempt should be made to
regularly allot recruits from certain electorates
as reinforcements for the same units. In this
manner each electorate (or two or more elec-
torates as necessary) will gradually become iden-
tified with a particular unit abroad. In this
connexion it will also be possible to some extent
to associate this territorial recruiting scheme
with the localities of militia infantry units which
are being re-numbered similar to units now on
active service, according to proposals recently
submitted to District Commandants. It is re-
cognised, however, that this latter idea cannot
be extended to all portions of electorates, owing
to the limitation of battalion areas to closely
settled localities, but as far as practicable those
exempt portions of electorates should be in-
cluded in the militia battalion areas adjoining
them or conveniently situated with regard to
them.
Please refer a copy of this memorandum to each member
and the Secretary of the State Recruiting Committee.
T. H. DODDS, Colonel,
Military Secretary.

SEPARATION ALLOWANCE.
Regarding married members of the Australian Im-
pel- al Force receiving ’ess than Bs. per diem,f Separation
Allowance will be paid from Ist May, 1916, as follows, for
each day for wh ch pay is due, subject to relative instruc-
tions which have been or may be issued :
(a) For wife living at home,* Is. sd. per diem.
( b) For each child under sixteen years of age, 4|d. per
diem.
A similar allowance as in (a) may be paid to the under-
mentioned relatives of members of the Australian Imperial
Force, provided that they are dependent upon such member
for support, and that they are not in receipt of either Invalid,
Old-age, or War Pension :
Mother;
Married sister, who is a widow ;
Invalid father, whose wife is not alive.
Similarly the allowance prescribed in ( b ) may be paid to
the following:—
Brothers and sisters under the age of 16 years ;
Mother;
• Note. —“Living at home” is intended to mean living at the home main-
tained in Australia or New Zealand by the husband for his wife and children,
irrespective of the locality where it may be necessary for the husband to
reside.
■f On and from date of embarkation this includes deferred pay


Children under 16 years of age of a married sister who is a
widow, and of whom the member is the sole
support;
Children under 16 years of age of a member who, after
a legal or mutual separation has been entered
into, continues to maintain them by allotting
a portion of his military pay for such purpose.
Separation allowance at the rate prescribed for the de-
pendant concerned may also be paid in cases in which an
order of a Court has been made for maintenance.
Separation Allowance in all the foregoing cases is subject
to the limitation that the amount thereof, added to the
member’s pay, shall not in any case exceed 10s. per diem.
(а) Commanding Officers are to satisfy themselves that
married members of the Australian Imperial Force make due
provision for the wives and families left behind, in addition
to the two-fifths of their pay as previously provided.
(б) Only one allotment of pay for each member of the
Australian Imper al Force will be accepted and given effect
to by the Defence Department.


Separation allowance may be issued on account of a
member of the Australian Imperial Force to a woman who
stands in the same relationship as a wife to the soldier con-
cerned, provided that the woman has been entirely depen-
dent upon the soldier for her maintenance and would other-
wise be destitute, and provided further that the statutory
allotment required of married soldiers is made in her favour.
In such cases proof will be required that the soldier was
living with the woman to whom the payment is to be made
on a bond fide permanent domestic basis.
Separation allowance may also be issued in respect of
children of the soldier concerned who are in the charge of
such women.
Separation allowance may be issued in respect of adopted
children of members of the Australian Imperial Force, pro-
vided the District Paymaster concerned satisfies himself
by sight of Deed of Adoption or other proof of the actual
adoption.
In cases where there are no dependants, members may
have a proportion of their pay placed to their credit in a
bank, if so desired.

EMBARKATION OF MEMBERS OF A.I.F.
UNDER 19.
It has been represented to Headquarters that some
lads under nineteen years of age who were enlisted on
the understanding that they were not to embark before
they were nineteen years of age, and being embarked
against the wishes of their parents.
It has been alleged that men under nineteen are
paraded and the order is given that those who do not
wish to embark are to stand forward and take their
discharge—thus they are branded as cowards.
No “force ” or “ persuasion ” is to be used to induce
lads under nineteen to embark if their parents or
guardians desire them to remain in camp till nineteen
years of age.
Every effort is to be made to induce lads of eighteen
years to enlist, even though their parents make the
condition that they are not to embark till nineteen
years of age.

Circular No. 70. Melbourne, 21st January, 1916.
Commandants,
All Military Districts.
LEAVE—AUSTRALIAN IMPERIAL FORCE.
The following rules regarding leave for the Australian
Imperial Force are to be strictly observed.
1. Evening Leave. —Evening leave may be granted, after
the end of the day’s work until 11 p.m. at the latest, tp not
more than 20 per cent, of the men in camp, i.e., each man
may be granted this evening leave on one day in five.
This leave is to be by platoon or other similar Training
Units as a whole.
2. Half-holiday Leave. —A half-holiday, with leave until
11 p.pa., may be granted once a week, not necessarily on
Saturdays, commencing not earlier than 1.30 p.m.
3. Sunday Leave. —When leave is given upcler (2) op any
other day than Saturday, general leave fropi not earlier
than 1.30 p.m. to not later than 11 p.m. may be granted.
4. Week-end Leave. —When leave is given under (2) on
Saturday, such leave may be continuous until 11 p.m.
on Sunday. Once a month week-end leave, extending


from 1.30 p.m. on Saturday to not later than 11 p.m.
Sunday, may be granted to those whose half-day leave
per week has been taken under (3) above.
5. Final Leave is to be granted before men go to Camp
of Concentration for embarkation. This leave should,
if possible, give men two clear days at their homes, care
being taken that cases do not occur of misstatement of
destination so as to lengthen leave. Final must not,
however, in any case exceed four complete days.
6. All Officers are to be treated exactly the same as
other ranks in regard to leave.
7. Leave passes with “ forfeiture slips ” are to be invari-
ably issued to Non-commissioned Officers and men when
they are granted leave. A copy of a book containing
such passes in use in the 3rd Military District is forwarded
under separate cover.
Commandants will take this Form of Leave Pass into
use forthwith, arranging for the printing of same locally.
8. With regard to the granting of leave, it should be
impressed upon all concerned that, once they enlist, their
single-minded devotion to training is absolutely essential,
and leave should be looked for only to the extent necessary
to keep them mentally elastic.


RETURNED SOLDIERS.
EMPLOYMENT.
The Commonwealth and the State Governments guarantee
the civil employment of those public servants serving with
the colours who are not permanently incapacitated from
rendering public service, and those public servants who are
so incapacitated as to be unable to take up their former
employment will be provided for in other ways. The Com-
monwealth Government has in addition promised to give
preference to returned soldiers in respect to general employ-
ment. A number of private firms have given assurances
of re-employment to their employees on service, and a
similar obligation should rest on all employers of labour.
Provision to Overcome Physical Disability.
The cases of soldiers so injured as to be unable to resume
the’r usual, or to adopt some other peace calling, will require
careful consideration. It may be found that the incapacity
may be diminished or removed by artificial expedients.
Restoration of efficiency will in such cases probably be a
matter of skill and expense. Many a man, who has lost
an arm or a leg, may be provided artificially with a sub-
stitute ; and, if necessary, can be trained in another avoca-
tion.


Smoke Night.


It may be desirable to appoint a committee of experts
to deal with such cases ; and it may be found necessary to
establish or to afford educational facilities to enable the
injured men to follow their old avocations or qualify for
new ones.
It will, therefore, be the duty of the Central Executive
and the State Councils to make recommendations as found
necessary to the Commonwealth Government or State
Governments on the lines indicated.
12th August, 1910.
PROVISION MADE FOR RETURNED
SOLDIERS.
On his return to Victoria the soldier is met by a Welcome
Home Committee at Port Melbourne, consisting of a number
of patriotic men and women who make it their special
function to meet all incoming boats containing sick and
wounded soldiers. Comforts of various kinds are pro-
vided by this Committee.
On arrival of the boat, a fleet of private motor cars
is waiting to convey the soldiers through the city, led by


a military band, to their various destinations. Subse-
quent motor health trips are arranged to country districts
two or three times a week. These are largely availed of
by the soldier, and assist in restoring him to his former
health.
In addition to the many hospitals which existed in pre-
war days, a large number of special hospitals have pro-
vided for the returned soldier. The best possible attention
is given him by eminent surgeons and medical men and
trained nurses during the time that he is in these various
hospitals.
Rest rooms presided over by patriotic ladies have sprung
Up in various parts of the city, where a returned soldier
may enter at any time and rest, and have light refreshments
provided him and meet with friends. All this is done
free of charge.
The Y.M.C.A. have a very commodious building erected
on St. Ri da-road, opposite the Barracks, whe. j soldiers
can obtain rest and food at a nominal charge.
No. 1 Rest Home at Wirth’s Park has been specially
fitted Up for the convenience and comfort of Soldiers who
are convalescing.
The State War Council has been constituted to assist
soldiers and sailors who have returned from the front in
getting re-established in Civil life. In addition to this


work of repatriation generous monetary aid is given in
necessitous cases. Soldiers who, for various reasons, have
had their pay stopped are provided with sums of money
from time to time to enable them to support themselves
and their dependants. This applies not only to dis-
charged soldiers, but also to undischarged soldiers who
are still hospital and whose dependants may require
temporary help.
The War Council also assists discharged men who are
unable to resume their former occupations to start in small
businesses in various sums up to £l5O. Small debts
owing by the soldier or by his dependants are paid by the
War Council. Furniture for setting up the home is also
provided, and general help to re-establish him in civil life.
Clothing, rent, improvements to small concerns, defraying
the cost of journeys recommended to invalids, and in the
assistance of the hopelessly unfit, in funeral expenses and
cash assis-tance to the wives of our men to tide over
temporary difficulties, are some instances to illustrate the
nature of the assistance given by the War Council.
Soldiers are trained in toy making, boot clicking, wool
classing, &c.; in the cases of others fees for the instruction
in typewriting and accountancy are paid. Men who have
an aptitude for farming, and with a view to their future
settlement on land, are sent to Dookie College, Longere-


nong College, and Werribee Research Farm for the purpose
of being trained in farming pursuits. During the time
that they are at these colleges or farms their maintenance
is paid for by the War Council.
In addition to the above activities there is a compre-
hensive scheme for the settlement of returned soldiers
who are qualified to become farmers. They are provided
with land for agricultural or horticultural purposes or for
poultry or small farms. The Lands Department makes
suitable land available on extremely easy terms. From
funds provided by the Repatriation Trustees advances
are made without interest for the purpose of purchasing
stock and farming implements, seed and plants, and
manure. Advances are also made by the State at a low
rate of interest on improvements, such as buildings,
fencing, clearing. Many returned soldiers have already
been settled upon the land in this way.
Pensions are granted to disabled or partially disabled
men; and pensions are also granted to wives and children
and parents of injured men or of men who unfortunately
lose their lives. The rate of pension varies according to
the particular case. They are on a most liberal scale,
with the result in some cases a man and his wife and family
are receiving sums of money, up to £3 7s. 6d. per week,
and the man may be earning pay in addition of suitable
light labour.




SOLDIERS AND SAILORS’ CLUB HOUSE.
During the past six months 127,000 men have used the
Soldiers and Sailors’ Club House erected by the Y.M.C.A.
on St. Kilda-road. In the same period 91,756 men in
khaki have been served with meals, and 16,500 letters
have been posted. Last Sunday the 428 soldiers who had
dinner and tea at the club house were largely composed of
Inter-State men, who make the Y.M.C.A. centre a home
while in Melbourne.
INSTRUCTIONS FOR THE GUIDANCE OF
RETURNED SOLDIERS RELATIVE TO PAY,
PENSIONS, AND CIVIL - EMPLOYMENT
AFTER DISCHARGE.
General.
Returned soldiers desiring information should apply,
in the case of invalids, to the Staff Officer for Invalids,
or, in the case of all other returned soldiers, to the Staff
Officer for Returned Soldiers.
These officers have offices at District Head-Quarters,
and they will give all possible assistance and advice regard -
ing medical attention, pay, pensions, voluntary aid and
repatriation funds, &c., and they should be advised of any
change of address while on military pay.


Pay.
All Cases other than Disciplinary and Venereal. —Pay of
rank in Australian Imperial Force may be continued, in
the case of invalids, until return to duty, or (where found
unlit for further service) until discharge. In cases of per-
manent incapacity, total or partial, pay will not be con-
tinued for a longer period than two months after confirma-
tion of the recommendation for discharge, when pension
should be available.
As soon as decision regarding discharge has been arrived
at by Principal Medical Officer the soldier will be notified,
and he should immediately apply for pension on the form
provided, which can -be obtained at all Military Hospitals,
or at the office of the Staff Officer for Invalids.
Where the earning capacity in his civil employment of a
soldier is not affected, discharge will take effect and pay
cease fourteen days after confirmation of recommendation
for discharge.
A soldier found unfit for further service may, if he so
desires, be granted his discharge forthwith, on the authority
of the Principal Medical Officer.
All discharged soldiers have the right to apply for pension.
The whole of the pay, including deferred pay, accruing
to a soldier during the period he is placed under stoppage


becomes forfeit, i.e,, be is not entitled to any pay during
such period.
Allotments to dependants may, however, be continued
during the period of stoppage ; but any amounts so paid
are a charge against any credit balance due or becoming
due to the soldier.
Balances at Credit. —Any balance other than deferred
pay at credit of a soldier returned from abroad may be
drawn by the soldier as soon as his statement of account
has been received from the Staff Paymaster abroad.
Deferred Pay is not issuable until after a soldier has
been discharged from the A.I.F.
Allotments made payable to others than dependants may
be revoked if the soldier so desires.
Allotments made payable to dependants are not revocable,
but continue to be issued to’ the allottee as long as the
soldier is borne on the pay roll; in such cases the soldier
can only operate on his net rate of pay.
Pay Books. —The production of pay book is essential,
as otherwise the soldier can only be brought on to the
pay roll from the date on which he reports the loss of pay
book,
The adjustment of any arrears must, in cases where pay
books have been lost, be deferred until statement of accounts
is received from abroad.


Medical Attendance.
On arrival, soldiers may be granted leave of absence
to their own homes for a period of not longer than fourteen
days.
On the expiration of that period they will be admitted
to Military Hospitals and brought before medical officers,
who will decide as to their case.
Soldiers requiring treatment will be detained in Military
Hospitals or homes.
Those not requiring treatment, and those for whom no
further treatment is needed, will be disposed of by dis-
charge or return to duty through Details Camp.
In the event of illness occurring whilst on leave, a report
should be made to the nearest Military Hospital, or, failing
that, to the Staff Officer for Invalids.
The Defence Department is not liable for medical expenses
privately incurred.
Discharged members of the A.1.F., with or without
pension, may during the period of the war receive medical
treatment at Military Hospitals, where such exist, provided
such treatment is required in consequence of a disability,
the result of military service. Discharge certificates must
be produced when making application at Military Hospitals
for this purpose.


Mental Cases.
Special arrangements have been made in regard to
mental which will, on application, be explained to
relatives and friends by the Staff Officer for Invalids.
Pensions.
A soldier partially or totally incapacitated should take
steps to apply for war pension immediately his case shall
have been determined by the Medical Board. Application
must be made by the individual concerned, and must be
submitted to the Deputy Commissioner of Pensions of the
State in which the applicant resides.
The Staff Officer for Invalids will lend any assistance
that may be required in this regard.
Discharge from A.I.F. will take place, and military pay
cease, on the day prior to that on which pension commences,
but military pay will not be continued for more than two
months after a soldier’s case has been adjudged as one for
discharge and Board proceedings confirmed by the P.M-O.
Civil Employment.
With the object of providing employment for returned
soldiers, an Employment Bureau, under the auspices of the
State War Council, has been established in the capital city
of each State.


Partially incapacitated soldiers and those who have been
discharged as medically fit to earn their own livelihoods,
who are desirous of obtaining employment, should apply
to the Officer-in-Charge of the Employment Bureau, whose
address may be obtained from the Staff Officer for Invalids,
or from the Staff Officer for Returned Soldiers.
Repatriation Fund and Patriotic Fund.
The Staff Officer for Invalids and the Staff Officer for
Returned Soldiers will, if desired, explain the steps to be
taken to obtain full particulars in regard to these funds.
Red Cross Society.
Whilst the Department provides all that is necessary
in the direction of medical attention and care of sick and
wounded to restore them, as far as possible, to robust
health, every facility is granted the Red Cross Society to
provide comforts, &c., and the State divisions of the
society invite those in need of the help of the Red Cross
Society to take advantage of the provision made by the
public in this connexion.

Melbourne, August, 1916.


REPATRIATION.
Commonwealth and State Functions.
The Agreement.
At the Premiers’ Conference agreement was reached
on the relations of the Commonwealth and the States
regarding repatriation. The Commonwealth accepts
responsibility for the general scheme, the States for land
settlement, with financial assistance from the Common-
wealth. It was agreed to harmonize the main principles
of land legislation in the several States.
The official statement, issued by Sir Alexander Pea-
cock, president of the Conference, is as follows: — % ,
It was agreed that members of the Australian and
British Naval and Military Forces who have served in
the war should be eligible as land settlers; that the
maximum advance on improvements should be £SOO, up
to 100 per cent, thereon, the improvements to include
fencing, clearing or cultivation, erection of house,
general improvements, implements, stock; the rate of
interest to be charged being not more than per cent,
for the first year, rising by \ per cent, each year up
to the cost price of the money, in the terms of the agree-
ment adapted by the Conference held in February, 1916.
To give effect to this it was decided, where necessary, to
seek amending legislation in the respective States. Sub-
stantial uniformity was obtained in regard to the periods


of repayment and of remission of rent during the initial
stages of settlement. The Prime Minister undertook
that the Commonwealth would finance the scheme of
advances, and make available to the States the amount
necessary for the calendar year 1917. This money to be
used exclusively for advances against improvements to
be effected by or for the soldier settler. (The amount is
understood to be about £2,000,000.)
It was decided (Queensland at present withholding
consent) to constitute a Board, to consist of one Min-
ister from each State and a Commonwealth Minister,
and to be known as " The Soldiers’ Settlement Board
of Australia,” this Board to be empowered to con-
sider and make recommendations in respect to—
(a) The maximum or minimum advances to be
made to each settler, irrespective of land pro-
vision.
(&) The purpose for which advances may be made,
i.e., whether to cover stock, seed, plant, and
implements, as well as fixed improvements.
(c) The percentage of advances which may be
paid as against appraised value of improve-
ments.
(d) The rates of interest that should be paid by
settlers.
(e) The duration of initial period during which in-
terest or instalments will be suspended.


(f) Generally to secure, as far as the varying condi-
tions of each State will allow, uniformity of
conditions throughout the Commonwealth
for soldier land settlement.
(7) To receive, summarize, and circulate a monthly
report, to be furnished by each State, show-
ing the number of applications for land made
by returned soldiers, the number of appli-
cants placed during the period involved, the
number of applications remaining on the
books, and such other information as to pro-
gress of soldier settlement as may be of in-
terest.
( h) To consider all matters in relation to the
scheme, and to make such recommendations
as from time to time may seem necessary for
its successful operation.
The Conference regarding the training of intending
soldier settlers as of the utmost importance in successful
settlement, it was resolved that the Commonwealth Go-
vernment should share equally with the States in the
cost of training, and should accordingly subsidize the
cost of training farms on the basis of a pound for pound
contribution. It was agreed that where the trustees of
the Repatriation Fund have received donations of land
which are considered by the- State authorities to be suit-
able for settlement or building purposes, the State


authorities may take over such land at an approved
valuation, and credit the fund with the amount, which
may be paid in debentures at the option of the State.
It was further decided to recommend to the State Go-
vernments that where returned soldiers desire to
privately purchase land, the Governments make avail-
able the services of a land valuer, and that no claim by
returned soldiers for assistance on improvements on
land privately bought would be entertained unless the
Government valuer had inspected and approved of the
property before purchase.
General Repatriation.
The Conference received from the Repatriation
executive a series of proposals in regard to the general
question of repatriation of returned soldiers. The fol-
lowing resolutions were agreed to:
1. That, with the exception of land settlement and
advances to be made against improvements and for
other purposes under the laws regulating State institu-
tions, the entire question of the re-establishment of
discharged soldiers and sailors, and the care of the de-
pendants of soldiers and sailors generally, be made the
concern of a Commonwealth authority.
2. That it be the business of the central Common-
wealth authority to devise a substantially uniform
system of dealing with returned soldiers and sailors and


the dependants of soldiers and sailors on service, or
of soldiers and sailors who have died as a result of ser-
vice, in respect of— (a) immediate amelioration, • i.e.,
the provision of means for meeting immediate cash
necessities. This either by supplementing the military
or naval pay before discharge, or of sustenance after
discharge until employment or remunerative occupation
can be found; (&) care of the totally incapacitated, to
include housing where necessary; (c) training of the
partially disabled for a useful vocation, to include the
provision and renewal of artificial limbs and other aids,
( d ) employment generally; ( e ) assistance towards per-
manent re-establishment by —(i) sustenance during the
initial period of settlement on the land or establishment
in other avocations; (ii) small businesses, were such
deemed a desirable form of provision; (iii) grants for
tools of trade; (iv) assistance towards house establish-
ment—(a) loans for house building, or purchase (to in-
clude the conversion of existing mortgages where terms
onerous); ( b) grants for furniture to prescribed
amount; (/) care of dependants — (a) of men who die,
( b ) of men on service; (ff) the co-ordination of govern-
mental and private efforts for the expansion of existing,
and the promotion of new, industries to meet the de-
mand for general and special employment; and ( h) the
assembling and administration of funds.


3. That the War Councils of the States shall be con-
stituted Commonwealth bodies operating within broad
lines of policy indicated from time to time by the central
Commonwealth authority; that their staffs be respon-
sible through the War Councils to, and be paid by, the
central Commonwealth authority, and that, where
such staffs consist of members of the State Public Ser-
vices, the State Governments be asked to permit the
continuance in employment of such officers where de-
sirable for a period up to two years after the conclusion
of the war without prejudice to their rights under the
Public Service Regulations of the respective States.
4. That all funds for purposes relating to the war will
be placed under the control of the Commonwealth
authority.
5. That the Commonwealth authority be vested with
power to control all appeals for funds for war purposes,
and to prescribe the conditions governing the adminis-
tration of all funds so raised.
6. That the office of the Commonwealth authority in
each State capital shall act as a registration and clear-
ing centre for all soldiers and sailors on their return,
and that every returned soldier and sailor be obliged
to register there before his discharge, giving particulars
as to his needs (if any).


7. That in regard to general and special employment,
vocations, training, allotments of money for re-estab-
lishment, and for such other purposes as may be deemed
expedient, the practice of associating honorary com-
mittees with the administration may be continued, but
such committees to be advisory only.
8. That the States be asked to agree to a uniform
scale of advances to soldiers and sailors desiring to
build or purchase dwellings in certain areas, or to con-
vert existing mortgages of an onerous character, the
Commonwealth authority to advance 25 per cent, of the
value, the sum so advanced by the Commonwealth not
to exceed £75.
9. That the States be asked to co-operate in the de-
velopment of large national enterprises calculated to
provide employment for men who cannot be otherwise
placed.
10. That on all bodies concerned with the repatriation
of men under the Commonwealth scheme, the repre-
sentation of soldiers and sailors who have been on
active service is desirable.
With a view to minimizing the difficulty of re-estab-
lishing returned soldiers in civil life, it was resolved to
recommend to the Prime Minister that returned solders,
other than those qualified for a pension, should not be
discharged until they are certified physically fit to per-
form some occupation.

mentioned dependants of a member of the Forces, the
following members of his family are entitled to pensions, at
such rates as are assessed, if they were wholly or partly

pension in respect of tlie death or incapacity of any member
of the Forces which resulted from his employment in the


present war, the amount of such State or Imperial pension

war pension which is payable.
PART ll.—How and When to Apply for Pension.
Forms of Application.
22. There are three forms of application, viz.:—
Form Z for incapacitated members of the forces ;
Y for dependants (including wives or widows) over the
age of 16 years ;
„ X for dependants under the age of 16 years.
These may be obtained at post offices or from the Deputy
Commissioner of Pensions. In country districts forms are
obtainable from Clerks of Petty Sessions (who act also as
Registrars of Pensions).
23. In order to save time and trouble all the questions
in the form should be clearly answered. The form should
then be signed and declared before one of the officials
mentioned therein, and forwarded to the Deputy Commis-
sioner if the applicant resides in a metropolitan district, or
to the nearest Registrar of Pensions if the applicant resides
in the country.


Addresses of Deputy Commissioners.
24. The addresses of the various Deputy Commissioners
of Pensions are as under :
Sydney .. 17 Bligh-street.
Melbourne .. Elizabeth House, Elizabeth-street.
Brisbane .. Desmond Chambers, Adelaide-streefc.
Adelaide .. Brookman’s Building, Grenfell-street.
Perth .. A.M.P. Buildings, St. George’s-terrace.
Hobart .. National Mutual Buildings, Macquarie-street.
London .. 72 Victoria-street, Westminster, London, S.W.
On application personally or by letter to a Deputy Com-
missioner, full information will be supplied on any matter
relating to pensions.
Period Allowed for Applying.
25. The time within which incapacitated members and
their dependants should lodge claims is fixed by the War
Pensions Act as six months after discharge.
26. Dependants of a deceased member should malce
application as soon as they become aware of the member’s
death. The time within which their claims should be
lodged is six months after the notification of the death is
published in the Commonwealth Gazette.
27. If the claim is not made within the prescribed period
it must be referred to the Commissioner of Pensions, who
will not approve of pension unless he considers that the
reason given for the delay is adequate.


PART in.— Payment of Pensions.
Method op Collection.
28. Pensions are paid through the Post Office in fort-
nightly instalments, which are due on every second Thurs-
day. Payment, however, may be collected on any day on
which the Post Office is open.
29. If for any reason a pensioner finds it inconvenient
to collect pension personally, he or she may give an order
to some other person over the age of sixteen years to collect
the instalment concerned.
30. In the case of pensioners under the age of sixteen
years the appointment of a “ trustee ”is necessary. The
trustee is usually the mother or father of the pensioners,
or some person who looks after them.
31. Any pensioner over the age of 16 years who is
likely to be unable 5 for a lengthy period, to collect his or
her pension may apply for the appointment of a trustee.
Pension not Assignable.
32. A pension granted to any person cannot be sold or
assigned, or given as security for borrowed money, or
taken by creditors in settlement of their claims.
Payment of Lump Sum.
33. In cases where the incapacity is not more than
30 per cent., a lump sum may be paid in lieu of pension.


This provision is applied in exceptional cases only, because
it is considered to be in the interests of pensioners that
they should receive a regular fortnightly instalment rather
than a lump sum.
PART IV.—How Long Pensions are Payable.
Members of the Forces.
34. The pensions granted to members of the Forces
whose disabilities are specified in the second schedule (see
paragraph 5) are permanent.
35. The pensions granted to other members are payable
as long as they are incapacitated, but cannot be reduced
within six months from the date of commencement.
Children of Deceased Members.
36. Pensions granted to children of deceased members
are payable until they reach the age of sixteen years, or
for two years from the date of commencement —whichever
period is the longer. If, on attaining the age of sixteen
years, any child of a deceased member is not able to earn
a livelihood, an application may be made within the follow-
ing six months for a fresh pension.
Children of Incapacitated Members.
37. Pensions granted to children of incapacitated mem-
bers are subject to the same conditions as pensions granted
to children of deceased members. There is, however, this


additional provision—if the member recovers from his
incapacity before all of his children have attained the age
of sixteen years, his own pension may be cancelled, and
since he is no longer incapacitated, the children under
sixteen years of age will cease to be eligible, and their
pensions also may be cancelled.
Wives of Incapacitated Members.
38. The wife of an incapacitated member receives pension
as long as her husband is incapacitated.
Other Dependants.
39, The following dependants of a member of the Forces
cannot receive pension for more than two years if they
are able to earn a livelihood :—Son, daughter, step-son,
step-daughter, step-father, step-mother, foster-mother,
adopted child, grandson, granddaughter, brother, sister,
half-brother, half-sister, mother-in-law.
Female Dependants who Marry or Re-marry.
40. If any single female pensioner marries, or any widow
re-marries, her pension will not be paid for more than two
years after her marriage or re-marriage.
Suspension or Forfeiture during Imprisonment.
41. If any war pensioner is sentenced to a term of im-
prisonment, his pension may be suspended or forfeited
during the whole of that term. If he has dependants,
any amount forfeited will be paid to them.

FOR THE GUIDANCE OF RETURNED
SOLDIERS.
Australian Military Forces,
Head-Quarters,
Melbourne.
Returned soldiers are enjoined to set an example by their
conduct and discipline, to all men who have not yet been
sent on active service.
Until you are discharged or returned to duty, you must
always have in your possession a current leave pass.
You should be most careful when in uniform to be always
correctly dressed.
Pg,y is available at the office of Returned Soldiers Pay
Office, on presentation of your pay book. A soldier’s
deferred pay cannot, under any circumstances, be drawn
until he is discharged.
You should, on receipt of notice, immediately attend for
your Medical Board, and if you are declared permanently
unfit and assessed for pension, you should make your appli-
cation for pension forthwith, in order to prevent delay and
probable cessation of your pay. Any soldier who neglects
to apply for his pension is liable to be discharged on the


expiration of two months of being declared medically unfit
by the Medical Board.
Every effort will be made on a soldier being discharged
to place him in civil employment, but should the soldier
be sufficiently fit to undertake guard duty, he may be
enlisted for Home Service as a member of the Returned
Soldiers’ section of the Permanent Guard, if there is a
vacancy there.
Advice or information can always be obtained on appli-
cation to the Staff Officer Returned Soldiers, or on medical
matters to the Staff Officer Invalids.
The Repatriation Fund was established by the Federal
Government of Australia, and it is proposed to provide this
fund by means of a tax on wealth. By this tax it is antici-
pated that anything from £10,000,000 to £20,000,000 will
be obtained for the repatriation of our soldiers.
Employment.—There is an Employment Bureau which
is carried on by the State War Council, and is largely
availed of by our returned men. To date over 4,000
positions have been filled through the agency of the State
War Council; and every effort is made to continue and to
extend their operations to make suitable provision for
our men when they have returned from the War.




There is also a Bed Cross Amelioration Fund, which
renders financial assistance to sick and wounded soldiers
and sailors who have been invalided back to Australia
pending their discharge. Through the Red Cross Society
we are enabled also to provide artificial limbs for those
who require them.
HONOURS.
Every soldier who proceeds on active service will receive
a war medal, with a bar for every engagement of importance
in which he may take part.
Every soldier has a prospect of promotion.
Every soldier has a prospect of gaining renown in the
field, and a distinguished badge of honour.
The number of decorations gained by Australian soldiers
is now nearing 900. Officially the Defence authorities have
learned of the following awards :

FIRST AID.
The Honorary Instructors and Demonstrators of The
Royal Life Saving Society are following out the advice
given by General Birdwood, to the Australian Troops, to
take every precaution against gas poisoning, by attending
the various Military Camps, and giving free instruction to
all the soldiers of the Schafer method of resuscitation, to
enable them to be able to combat the ill effects of gas poison-
ing. Instruction has been given to the troops at the City
Baths, and will be continued.
SOLDIERS’ ADVICE BUREAU.
The Soldiers’ Advice Bureau will assist all soldiers
with legal advice, and in the direction of the prepara-
tion of wills, powers of attorney, and other legal docu-
ments. Arrangements have been made with barristers
and solicitors throughout Victoria to co-operate in this
assistance. In Melbourne, communication should be
made with the Honorable Arthur Robinson, M.L.C.,
Law Institute Office, Collins House, Collins-street,
Melbourne, between the hours of 10 a.m. and 4 p.m.,
and at the Melbourne Town Hall from 8 p.m. to
10 p.m.


MORATORIUM.
By Regulations under the War Precautions Act
1914-16, special provision is made in respect to mort-
gages, bills of sale, &c., and particularly for the pro-
tection of soldiers’ dependants. Clause 4 of Statutory
Rule No, 284 reads as follows:
4. (1) A mortgagee shall not, without leave of-
the Court—
(a) call up or demand payment from any
mortgagor of any part of the principal
sum secured by the mortgage;
( b ) exercise any power of sale;
(c) commence any action or proceeding, or
continue any action or proceeding com-
menced after the twentieth day of Sep-
tember, One thousand nine hundred
and sixteen, for breach of any covenant,
agreement, or condition expressed or
implied in any mortgage other than a
covenant, agreement, or condition,
for —
(i) the payment of interest, or
(ii) the insurance, maintenance, or
cultivation of the mortgage
property, or the payment of
rates, taxes, and other charges,
or the doing of any acts for
the preservation of the
security;


(d) commence any action or proceeding, or
continue any action or proceeding com-
menced after the twentieth day of Sep-
tember, One thousand nine hundred
and sixteen, for interest at any rate
higher than the rate provided in the
mortgage or the rate payable under
Sub-regulation (7) of this Regulation,
as the case may be; or
(e) take any steps for obtaining an order for
foreclosure or for possession or occu-
pation.
and Sub-section 7 of the same Rule provides:
(7) In any case where after the due date for re-
payment of the principal sum or any part thereof,
the principal sum or part remains unpaid, the
time for repayment of the principal sum or part
shall, unless and until an application for leave is
dealt with by the Court under this Regulation,
be by force of these Regulations extended upon
the terms that interest shall continue to be payable
at the close of the same intervals of time as are
provided by the mortgage with respect to the in-
terest thereby secured, or, if no provision is so
made, then quarterly, and at the following rate:
(a) in the case of a mortgage of which the
principal sum or unpaid part does not
exceed Two thousand pounds—the rate


provided in the mortgage, or the rate
of 6 per centum per annum, whichever
is the less; and
( b) in the case of a mortgage of which the
principal sum or unpaid part exceeds
Two thousand pounds—the rate pro-
vided in the mortgage, or 6 per centum
per annum, whichever is the greater:
Provided that in the latter case the Court may,
on the application of the mortgagor, fix a lower
rate, not being lower than the rate provided in the
mortgage or 6 per centum per annum, whichever
is the less.
Clause 47a, Statutory Rule No. 47 provides for the
protection of dependants. It reads:
47a. (1) No person shall under a bill of sale, or
writ of execution, or other process issued by a
Court, or by way of distress, seize or take possession
of—
(a) any chattels which are used by any female
dependant of any member of a force
raised for service beyond Australia to
support or assist in supporting herself
or any of the family of such member;
or
( b ) any furniture or wearing apparel belong-
ing to any such member or female de-
pendant; provided that if the furniture


and wearing apparel belonging to such
member and his female dependants ex-
ceed in value £5O, any articles may be
seized and taken possession of under
due authority of law if the articles re-
maining are not less in value than £5O.
(2) If any person contravenes the provisions of
this paragraph, he shall be guilty of an offence
against the Act.
(3) For the purpose of this paragraph female
dependants shall mean any female who is wholly
or partly dependent for her support upon the pay
of a member of a force raised for service beyond
Australia.

“ ACQUIT YE LIKE MEN 1”


LORD KITCHENER’S MESSAGE
Finally, as a general guide to conduct you
cannot do better than learn by heart the
message which Lord Kitchener sent to the
men of the Expeditionary Force :
« Be invariably courteous, considerate, and
kind. Never do anything likely to injure or
destroy property, and always look upon looting
as a disgraceful act. You are sure to meet
with a welcome and to be trusted; your conduct
must justify that welcome and that trust.
Your duty cannot be done unless your health
is sound. So keep constantly on your guard
against any excesses. In this new experience
you may find temptations both in wine and
women. You must entirely resist both tempta-
tions, and, while treating all women with
perfect courtesy, you should avoid any
intimacy.
Do your duty bravely,
Fear God,
Honour the King.’*
