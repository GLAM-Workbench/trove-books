The 1934 receiver programme of Amalgamated Wireless is
designed to suit all requirements in both the popular anti high-
class radio field.
In keeping with its high prestige as Australia’s national wireless
organisation, A.W.A. presents this new range of receivers as being
the finest yet produced by the Company.
The high plane upon which Australia to-day places the Radiola is
due in a very large measure to the technical resources of the Com-
pany and to the modern precision methods of the A.W.A. Radio-
Electric Works.
This year’s receivers incorporate many new worthwhile improve-
ments having for their object finer tonal quality, greater volume
and ease of operation. Rotovision tuning is an advanced feature
showing at a glance the station you want, while high fidelity
performance is an outstanding accomplishment in all sets.

7-VALVE SUPERHETERODYNE
This magnificent seven-valve superheterodyne Radiola
maintains the prestige of A.W.A. in the field of fine
broadcast receivers. It incorporates every worthwhile
improvement in modern radio.
The essential factors of broadcast reception aimed at by
research engineers to-day are high fidelity reproduction,
power and silent operation, and these qualities are
incorporated in this new Radiola in a superlative degree.
Background noises are reduced to a minimum when
bringing in distant stations. Extreme selectivity and
improved fidelity of reproduction are assisted by the
use of a band-pass filter incorporated in the inter-
mediate frequency amplifier.
The new A-B system of amplification gives greatly aug-
mented volume without distortion—fading and blasting
are eliminated by means of an improved volume control.
The specially designed high fidelity loudspeaker repro-
duces a full, clear output of 6 watts undistorted power,
while large baffle areas in the cabinet improve the
acoustic response and eliminate resonance.
The utilisation of multi-purpose valves results in the
performance of this Radiola being equal to that of
receivers equipped with a greater number of valves.
By means of tone control the individual interpretation
of tone can be varied at will. The bass or treble can
be accentuated to suit individual requirements.
A full vision rotovisor tuning dial with a very open,
finely graduated scale is an entirely new feature. The
tuning condenser is operated through a flexible hut
positive vernier drive with gear-friction drive to the
pointer. This combination gives an easy running control
without backlash and with positive tracking of the
pointer, thus ensuring an extremely fine adjustment of
the dial.

The Chairman
Introduces —
THERE is very good reason for
the popularity of our Annual
Electrical and Radio Exhibition.
Electricity, with its array of mod'
ern appliances, appeals to the pro'
gressive and up'to'date housewife and
to the homedoving man as nothing
else can. Its efficiency, cleanliness
and utility and labour'saving quali'
ties clearly ma\e it stand out as one
of the best gifts to mankind.
In this, our Exhibition of 1934, a
massed demonstration of coo\ing by
Electricity is presented. Here may be
found proof conclusive that electric
coo\ing is beyond the experimental
stage and that the electric range is
a fully efficient and valuable servant
in the home. Its economy is marked,
and additionally so now that the
various electricity supply undertake
ings are reducing the price of current
for coo\ing purposes.
An alLelectric home was until re'
cently only for the few who could
afford the enormous cost. To'day,
however, due to modern science, an
electric home is within the reach of
all.
Ta\e, for example, the electric re'
frigerator —another boon. Lfo worry

Test Equipment
Service Instruction.
THE new Slade-Paton Tube
Checkei', although only re-
cently introduced, has created
quite a demand.
It provides the progressive radio
dealer with an up-to-date instru-
ment which will effectively test every
type of old or modern, American or
Continental valve.
A special feature of the tester is
that the condition of the valve is re-
gistered direct on the meter dial. This
simplifies valve selling, as it enables
prospective purchasers to see for
themselves just how good or other-
wise their valves may be.
This tube checker has been sub-
mitted to leading valve manufactur-
ers, and in each case was highly com-
mended.
Housed in a very attractive leather-
ette case, it sells at a price which
should make it a profitable invest-
ment to anyone connected with radio
selling.
The quality of this firm’s test
equipment is now well known all
through Australia and New Zealand,
the A.C.-D.C. Analyser being particu-
larly popular.
It will be interesting to dealers, es-
pecially those from the country, to
know that this firm has arranged to
give practical instruction in the use
of service equipment to every pur-
chaser of their test equipment at their
factory at Croydon.
This affords a unique opportunity
for those not well advanced in radio
serviceing.

The Bunnerong Electric Power Station
Generation and Distribution of Electricity
The purpose of this article is to convey, with as few technical terms as possible, some idea
of the enormous set of circumstances which lie behind the ordinary switch to be found in
our homes. No attempt will be made to describe in detail the entire plant and ramifica-
tions of the Bunnerong Power Station. Such a description would necessarily be lengthy
and of doubtful interest to the majority of people.
THE Bunnerong Power Station,
situated at the north-eastern
corner of Botany Bay, is a fa-
miliar landmark to most of us, but
perhaps very few know why the sta-
tion was erected in its present posi-
tion. In choosing a site for a power
station certain factors have to be con-
sidered, and it was after considera-
tion of those factors that Botany Bay
was chosen. Cooling water condi-
tions are good, coaling facilities for
rail-borne coal are reasonably good,
the reception of sea-borne coal are
practicable, there is ample space for
reserve coal storage, and, considering
these advantages, It is as near as
practicable to the system load centre.
Most people have the idea that
electricity is new. Electricity is not
new. The energy which you are us-
ing to do so much for you to-day is,
after all, but the stored sunlight of
a million years ago, preserved in the
form of good black coal, and it is in
the power station that the potential
energy in the coal is made available
to you. Simply, what happens is this:
Heat is extracted from the coal to
generate, or raise, steam in the boil-
ers, the steam drives the turbines,
which, in turn, drive the alternators,

or generators of electrical energy.
Over 1,000 tons of coal are de-
livered daily at Bunnerong. On arri-
val at the station the coal is emptied
from the railway trucks into troughs
below the tracks; it passes through
crushers to automatic loaders, and
then into a large bucket to be hoist-
ed to a level where it can either be
discharged on to a belt conveyor sup-
plying the boilers, or be passed
through a chute to the reserve pile.
The coal-handling plant at Bunne-
rong is entirely automatic. Once the
gear has been started by the mere
pressing of a button, accelerating,
decelerating, stop and hold in un-
loading position for a set time and
start hoisting again, are automatically
carried out by the control gear.
The belt conveyors are situated at
Bunnerong on the top floor of the
boiler house, and the boiler fires are
gravity fed through large chutes. A
boiler fire consumes on an average
about 128 tons of coal each day, and.
under ordinary , conditions, operates
at a temperature of a,bout 2 700 de-
grees Fah., but variations occur ac-
cording to the load on the boiler.
Throughout the day and night auto-
matic stokers work on the boiler fires
and although the movement of the
stokers is slow as to be hardly
ceptible, their work is done thor-
oughly.
The boiler house at Bunnerong at
present accommodates 18 boilers, ar-
ranged in batteries of three. Each
battery serves its own turbine, but to
provide for any contingencies which
may arise, the steam mains are inter-
connected. Every part of the boiler
is under the constant watchful eyes
of firemen by means of what may be
termed mechanical eyes. In reality,
these are instruments mounted on
panels adjacent to the boilers. They
tell the firemen everything in con-
nection with the operation of the
boilers.
After the heat has been extracted
from, the coal, the remaining ashes
fall from the furnaces into water-
filled pits situated in the basement of
the station. An electric travelling
grab reclaims them from the pits and
they are loaded on to a train and
taken away. The system of ash-
handling requires but little attendance
and the pits are able to accommo-
date all the ash produced over a
week-end.
The visitor to Bunnerong enters
the turbine house immediately after
having inspected the boilers. The

New extra pleasures are yours when you own this
Stromberg-Carlson All-Wave Receiver. Embodying
every worth-while feature of modern radio design, it
offers, even on local stations, new radio enjoyment—
the enjoyment of still finer tone, still easier tuning,
still clearer reproduction. And, besides receiving all
Australian stations better than ever before, it brings
you, on the very same dial, the short wave stations
of the world. Of course, with short wave transmission
at its present stage, it is not always possible to receive
every short wave station—atmospheric conditions affect
reception. But, when these conditions are favourable,
broadcasts from the other side of the world are tuned
in as easily, as clearly as Australian programmes.
There’s twice as much fun in
radio when you own this set.

completed section of the turbine
house contains six 25,000 kilowatt
turbo-alternator sets. To the uniniti-
ated these mighty machines bear no
connection with the humble wind-
mill, but that is what they
really are. The modern tur-
bine is made up of hundreds
of small windmills, but in-
stead of being turned by
gentle breezes, they are turn-
ed by terrific blasts of steam.
Attached to the shaft of the
turbine is the alternator, or
generator, and when it is
realised that a kilowatt is
the equivalent of about 1
l/3rd horse power, some
idea of the immense amount
of power available at Bun-
nerong may be gained. It is
these alternators that sup-
ply , the actual electrical
energy which is available to
you.
In every home or factory electric-
ity supply is controlled by a switch,
and the Bunnerong Power Station is
no exception to this rule; but, notice-
ably, the switches at Bunnerong are
somewhat different to the switches
controlling house and factory sup-
plies of electricity. The 33,000-volt
switch gear at Bunnerong occu-
pies the first and second
floors of the switch house,
and so that some idea of its
massiveness may be gained,
it might be mentioned that
the weight of each complete
switch is approximately Th
tons. Any one of these
switches is capable of con-
trolling the supply of elec-
tricity of an entire suburb.
Throughout the day and
night, man watches this ro-
bot he has created, and in
the control room, situated
on the top floor of the switch
house, he has his finger on
the pulse of all its vitals.
From this room he is able
to wake turbines into action.
Signal lights and bells tell him ex-
Sctly when and where trouble im-
pends, and it is to the amazing array
of instruments to be seen in the con-
+r.r,i that credit is due for the

you have become so used to obtaining

alternator temperatures, speed con-
trol of turbines and the disconnection
of the turbo-alternator unit through
any trouble conditions whatever.
The electricity generated at Bun-
°
nerong is delivered at a high pres-
sure—33,ooo volts—to a number of
large sub-stations by means of cables
laid underground. Any one of these
cables, although measuring only
about four inches across, can deliver
sufficient electricity to supply about
ten thousand homes. The large sub-
stations are distributing cen-
tres where the electricity is
reduced in pressure and sent
by a number of smaller
cables, which radiate in all
directions, to some hundreds
of small sub-stations which
are installed about half a
mile apart over the whole
area supplied.
Nearly 1,000 miles of
high-pressure cable are used
to link up sub-stations and
distributing centres with
Bunnerong. If you were to
take a slice about three feet
thick from the tops of the
roadways in Sydney, you
would expose a complicated
network of cables.
At the small distributing centres
electricity is reduced in pressure to
240 volts and delivered to your homes,
chiefly by means of overhead mains
which you may see in most of the
suburban streets.
There is such a large number of
these small distributing centres that
many of you have, no doubt, noticed
them. Some are mounted
on poles in the streets and
they are easily recognised by
the number of wires radiat-
ing from them, and the
large iron case which con-
tains the appliance called a
transformer for reducing the
pressure. When the demand
for electricity warrants it,
these small distributing cen*
tres on poles are replaced by
larger equipment installed
in neat brick buildings erec-
ted in a line with the
houses.
It has often been asked
why electricity is sent ou*
from the power station at a
high pressure, and why, hav-
mg been sent out at that pressure, it is
not SU ppiied to users at the same pres-
sure; ingtead of being reduced. This
j s ra t ber a difficult matter to explain
without resort to technical terms, but
we know tha without a good pres-
sure of water it takes a long time

Delightful meals with little trouble.
Deliciously tender meat, fresh pure milk
and cream, firm butter—every dish a
delight, every meal a joy—all prepared
with the minimum of effort.
GONE are the days when the
housewife and food dealer were
satisfied with hole-and-corner meth-
ods of food refrigeration.
Clumsy meat safes, inadequate
water-cooling systems and unhygienic
dripping ice chests with all their in-
efficient kith and kin have disap-
peared into the limbo of unwanted
things, or, at best, are tolerated with
an apology and a longing for some-
thing better.
That the public, enlightened and
guided by the corhiparatively new
science of dietetics, is demanding
better and purer food is abundantly
evidenced by the yearly increasing
number of electrical refrigerator in-
stallations in Australian homes and
businesses. New flats and domestic
establishments have now electrical
refrigeration as essential equipment—
a local manufacturer reports having
supplied 5 3 refrigerators in one Syd-
ney building—and prominent food
dealers are featuring their electri-
cal refrigeration equipment as an
important selling point in the ap-
peals to their public.

it is in the home!
Meat always fresh and whole-

Vegetables and fruits stored never lose
their freshness. To-morrow, next day,
they will be as fresh and as good as
when first picked. Nothing decays.
Keeps food fresh indefinitely. Buy your
meat, fruit, vegetables, in larger quan-
tities and use as a storehouse —not an
item will taint or spoil. Everything
will be kept sound until you want it.
Not the least advantage of an elec-
trical refrigerator is the economies
effected in the housekeeping budget.
Food may be bought in larger quan-
tities when prices are low, and stored
for future use, ice bills become a thing
of the past, and “left-overs” can bo
safely kept, confident that no taint or
decay will affect their future use.
No wonder that the modern house-
wife, when asked to name her most
useful domestic appliance, invariably
replies, “My electrical refrigerator.”

petition. Customers prefer to buy
where freshness and purity are ap-
parent, the task of preserving and
storing food is reduced to a mini-
mum, “overhead” comes down be-
cause of the time, work and money
thus saved, and, last, but not least,
food can be attractively displayed at
the point of sale.
The time has almost arrived when
the housewife or food dealer witn-
out electrical refrigeration will be
classed as hopelessly behind the
times.

Mr. C. Lloyd Jones, Chairman
the Commission.
THE AUSTRALIAN
BROADCASTING
COMMISSION
Its Progress and its Goal
Conder, General Manager.
By W. T.
It is to be hoped that those who have
followed with interest the work which
the Australian Broadcasting Commission
has performed since its inception—and
there should be many of them—will have
observed a steady improvement in the
items with which it fills its many pro-
grammes. To the casual observer it may
appear that that improvement has been
haphazard and merely indicative of in-
creasing revenue. That, however, is not
Major W. T. Conder, General
Manager of the Commission.
so, for from the commencement of its activities the Commission has laid
down definite lines of policy and the subsequent development has followed
those lines.
TO set out that policy in short and
simple terms is not an easy task,
fer the ramifications of broadcasting
and the actual geographical intrica-
cies of the National network are such
that the framing of a comprehensive
and detailed policy is almost as cum-
bersome a matter as its exposition. The
physical construction of the National
network is now well enough known,
and the majority of listeners are able
to distinguish the names and situa-
tions of the twelve “A” Class Stations,
although, perhaps, some of them still
regard Rockhampton as being vague-
ly “in the north” and might find diffl-
culty in plotting accurately the posi-
tion of Station 5 CK, Crystal Brook.
The public has begun to realise that
the inter-connection of these stations
alone requires some 4,3 00 odd miles
of land-line cable and that an ordin-
ary telephone line is not sufficient to
carry, without distortion, the finer
notes of music; and those who are
interested in the Commission’s
“ground organisation” do not require
a great deal of thought to understand
the necessity for maintaining com-
plete administrative staffs in each of
the six capitals of the Commonwealth.
Yet, all these things. are obvious
enough to those who care to look for
them, but they are the veriest be-
ginning of the problems which con-
front the Commission. To the more
important of those problems refer-
ence has been made from time to
time—to the widely diversified condi-
. tions of Australian life; to the great
spaces which prevent the clear re-
ception of stations other than those
at least in the same State as the lis-
tener; to the enormous number of
hours which those two factors make
it necessary to supply in a year in
order that all members of the public
may be fairly and adequately served;
to the adverse operation of the time-
factor, which places Adelaide half an
hour and Perth two hours behind the
eastern States (a complication of ma-
terial importance when one is ar-
ranging National relays) to the tern-
porary difficulty which the wise and
long-sighted decision to encourage
local artists involves, when recorded
works of world-famous performers
are available from other sources; to
the distance which separates Austin-
lia from those parts of the worla
where affairs of international import
are decided and where leaders of mu-
sical, liteiaiy and dramatic ait are
wont to congregate; and to the dis-
parity in revenue which must obtain
between the leading broadcasting or-
gamsations of richer nations and t le
Australian Broadcasting Commission,
These difficulties could be elaborated
and magnified ad nauseum, but, when
much is to be & ained by courageous
and determined effort, it is a mistake
to dwell too long on the obstacles
which have to be surmounted,
At all events these conditions were,
along with a host of others, fully op-
preciated by the Commission, and its
general policy was framed with a
view to minimising and at length
overcoming them. But the programme
is, after all, the listener’s chief in-
terest; and one may well, therefore,
confine oneself to what may be
scribed as “programme policy.” For
this, the Commission has laid down
three main objectives, all of which
tend to the logical and progressive
improvement of what is placed before
the public: the first is the employ-

mission, who will conduct a series of

the National Stations.
ment and development of local per-
forming talent (and in this regard
one must, unfortunately, commence
with the assumption that, generally
speaking, the ordinary Australian
artist who remains in Australia
has not, as yet, reached a level of
performance comparable with that
of those who appear at Covent Gar-
den, La Scala, L’Opera. The result is
that, for the time, the standard of
those parts of the programme which
these artists supply must, to some ex-
tent, fall below that of the best re-
cordings, while, of course, the ex-
pense involved is greater; but to ac-
cept this state of affairs as permanent
and unavoidable and consequently to
concentrate upon “potted” music
would reveal a want of faith and a
shortness of sight scarcely worthy of
a national institution. Australia has
shown in the past that, given equal
opportunities, her chosen represen-
tatives need not fear competition from
the most accomplished of interna-
tional rivals, and the Commission has
taken it upon itself to provide those
opportunities in the hope that in a
comparative short space of time it
will have been able to build up in this
country artistic resources which the
rest of the world will envy); the
second is the development of local
creative talent of the types capable
of transmission by wireless, namely,
musical, dramatic and literary. (In
this regard Australia has rather lag-
ged behind the other nations, both
because she is still a very young and
very busy country, and because her
early maturity has coincided with the
time of world-wide unrest and change
—the type of period which, through-
out all history, has proved the least
favourable to artistic production;
again, the Commission has had suffic-
ient faith in the intelligence and
depth of feeling of its fellow coun-
trymen to believe that it is only ne-

certs arranged for May and June.
cessary to give opportunity to local
composers, dramatists and writers to
produce a literature worthy of Eng-
lish traditions, and, above all, imbued
with the spirit of Australia.) The
third, which in reality is little more
than a means of effecting the former
two, is the providing, meanwhile, of
a sufficiently attractive series of pro-
grammes to retain those listeners
which the Commission already has
and to win over yet others to a reali-
sation of the desirability—one might
almost say indispensability—of lis-
tening to them; and at the same time
the keeping before our performing
and creative artists and our ordinary
critical public of those world stand-
ards which we hope eventually to
reach.
If listeners will keep those three
points in mind they should, in think-
ing- back, have little difficulty in ob-
serving the manner in which the
Commission has endeavoured to put
them into effect. It will, however,
do little harm to give some general
indication here.
With regard to local artists, the
Commission employs, and of course
pays, something over 20,000 of them
every year. That, at least, is encour-
agement. In addition, it organises
them into combinations, 'whether en-
gaged permanently or at such inter-
vals as circumstances permit; it urges
them to learn not a haphazard variety
of items, but regular and logical
groups and series of them for pre-
sentation in programmes which have
been carefully arranged to lead nat-
urally and sympathetically from one
to the next—a definite forward step
from the old days when programmes
came into existence in much the same
manner as hash, that is to say, by
having thrown into them whatever
happened to be about provided only
that the quantity did not exceed the
space available; it gives them induce-
ment to learn new numbers, to re-
hearse conscientiously, and, gener-
ally, to seek to better themselves by
intelligent and careful training; and,
incidentally, to doing all these things
it is automatically giving to teachers

of music and of kindred arts similar
encouragement to modernise their
methods and increase their facilities.
In the case of authors, composers
and dramatists, the Commission not
only buys any works which happen
to be suitable, but also gives indica-
tion of the type of composition which
is desired for broadcasting purposes,
even to the extent of suggesting sub-
jects and proposing alterations. In
addition to this, it has already or-
ganised a competition for Australian
composers and is making prepara-
tions to repeat it; and intends, too,
to conduct a further competition for
dramatic productions suitable' for ra-
dio purposes. The Commission’s in-
terest in literary work has not, as yet,
brought it to the stage of organising
a competition, but it has sought far
and wide for suitable Writers, and,
again, offered advice and, perhaps
more important, a ready market,
while it has set itself to the task of
weeding out the promising from the
hopeless.
In regard to the two points of
policy referred to above, the more
critical of listeners may have thought
that little of concrete value has been
achieved in the space of something
over eighteen months, but a moment’s
reflection will show that the pro-
gramme itself is merely the foliage
of the forest; the work of selecting the
best of the trees, of thinning out the
old ones, of pruning away the faulty
branches, of planting new slips and
of tilling, irrigating and enriching
the soil is slow and laborious, and its
effect at first is merely to thin out
the general luxuriance; but it is use-
ful and reproductive work and its re-
sults will, in the course of time, re-
pay the effort a hundredfold, for the
older trees will grow more strongly
and more healthily, and the young
plants, carefully tended, will come up
to support and eventually , outrival
them until, in the end, what was pre-
viously but a jungle becomes a hand-
some and a fruitful forest.
The maintaining of world stand-
ards has been in one way the easiest,
and in another the most difficult, of
the three undertakings enumerated.
Easy because world reputations are
necessarily notorious, difficult because
markets elsewhere are richer and the
value of keeping in the view of those
markets so considerable that leading
men and women hesitate to accept
the comparative obscurity of the two
months’ journey to and from Austra-
lia. None the less, with Captain Ad-
kins and the Commission’s National

Australia, listeners have been able to
follow closely what is being done.
The effect is, of course, less obvious
than the steps, for effects have an
unfortunate habit of being slower
than their causes, but that that effect
will be achieved one who has the will
and the courage to look ahead need
have no cause to doubt.
So much for the Commission, con-
cerning Whom it is earnestly hoped
that these few words have been able
to make plain what possibly some
listeners did not previously realise,
namely, that the admitted improve-
ment in their programmes has been
no mere fortunate combination of
happy chances but the inevitable ful-
filment of a clearly defined and de-
terminedly pursued course of pre-
arranged action. And now, perhaps,
one may be permitted a word or two
about the listeners themselves. Some
may think that all a listener has to
do is to have ears and to hear —-that,
in fact, to demand any effort of those
whom one is entertaining is sheer im-
pertinence. Unfortunately, however,
things in this world have a habit of
being impertinent, and in that class
may be put all entertainment, for it
is an indisputable fact that little is of
real value, even as amusement, if one
does not exert some mental effort to
extract that amusement; in general,
what one takes out of things is in di-
rect proportion to what one puts
into them. In which knowledge
lies one explanation of that con-
stant enigma, the infinite diver-
sity of public taste, for in the end it
partly represents the infinite dis-
parity of human effort. Anyone will
admit that one man will derive con-
siderably greater enjoyment from
hearing a sonata well performed than
will his next-door neighbour; and
most, on making that observation,
will shrug their shoulders and say,
wisely, “You cannot please every-
body.” But if they studied the ques-
tion a little more closely they would
then realise that the reason for the
greater enjoyment of the first man is
that he has put, or is putting (or

probably both) considerably more ef-
fort into the enjoyment of sonatas
than his neighbour. That is one thing
which listeners might bear in mind
while they are writing abusive letters
to the papers. There is another as-
pect, too, which should be remarked
and that concerns something more
obvious and less exacting, namely,
the ordinary public attitude to the
hearing of what the wireless pro-
vides. Some things can be too easy,
and listening is one of them. A few
idle moments to be pleasantly filled
require now little more than the
turning of a switch and the natu-
rally lazy human creature takes ad-
vantage of that fact, with the result
that sometimes he is unable to find
what will fill those few moments
pleasantly for him. The Commission
goes to a great deal of trouble and
expense to have its programmes
printed and made available to the
public weeks in advance of their pre-
sentation; it prepares and rehearses
what it intends to perform and goes
out of its way to find programme-
items of more than normal appeal;
but, none the less, it is safe to say
that the majority of listeners have
not the vaguest idea of what will be
broadcast even to-night, let alone to-

Instrumentalists.
morrow or the next day, and far less
on Wednesday week. If they did
take the trouble to read their pro-
grammes in advance, which is the
purpose for which they are prepared
so far ahead, then they Would learn
of many things which they would like
to hear and would be warned against
all that were to them unsuitable. If
they did that and were still unable to
find sufficient good entertainment to
fill the gaps in their ordinary social
arrangements, then perhaps there
would be good cause for their com-
plaints; but, of course, they do not
do that and consequently are less sat-
isfied; naturally, they do not blame
themselves. Now the Commission is
not objecting to its share of the
blame, but it is advocating to any lis-
teners who happen to be dissatisfied
this policy of looking ahead as a
simple and reasonable manner of
protecting themselves. What is want-
ed is the introduction of the habit of
“going to the wireless,” or, better
still, “going to some particular sta-
tion,” just as one goes to bridge or
the theatre. If the programmes are
not up to expectation and people
waste their evenings, then, again,
they have cause for complaint, but if
their only complaint is that they lis-
tened to some station at five minutes
to nine on Thursday last and heard
a revue (as advertised) instead of
an opera (as not advertised), can
they blame anyone but themselves?
After all, a great number of people
enjoy listening to revues, and, on the
other hand, an opera was probably
broadcast on the preceding evening
while they were visiting Mr. and Mrs.
Thompson. Well, in the circum-
stances, what can the Commission do
except shake its weary head and trust
sincerely that they had a pleasant
evening at Mr. and Mrs. Thompson’s.

What of the Lighting of Your Home?
Contributed by the Illuminating Engineering
Society of Australia
ryi HERE is ample evidence to-day
that the average home is still in
need of a higher standard of illumi-
nation.
When it is remembered that no
less than 75 per cent, of our actions
depend on sight for guidance the
value of preserving this gift cannot
be too highly emphasised. Inade-
quate lighting or lighting ineffective-
ly utilised are insidious dangers to
our well-being and even our health
and life.
The eye was evolved by nature for
use under normal daylight conditions,
where lighting intensities range from
several hundred foot-candles to as
much as ten thousand foot-candles.
To-day, however, we spend about 25
per cent, of our time under arti-
ficial lighting of extremely small re-
lative intensity, often of only one
or two foot-candles. When this
meagre illumination is coupled with
the closer visual tasks which we
perform, as reading or sewing, it is
at once apparent that eye-strain will
be the inevitable result.
Eye-strain may also be caused by
excessive brightness of the light
source in comparison with the sur-
roundings, or “glare,” as it is called,
and any action taken to reduce the
apparent brightness and increase the
area of the source, or
to remove it from the
field of view, will
result in a decrease
in the discomfort and
fatigue experienced.
With the older
forms of electric lamp,
glare w r as not very pro-
nounced, but the pre-
sent-day gas - filled
lamp has a filament
brightness about 13
times that of the
earlier type of lamp
and about 100 times
that of a gas mantle.
By using inside
frosted lamps and
partially or wholly
enclosing the lamp in
a lighting unit which

will satisfactorily diffuse the light
flux, it should be possible to look
directly at the unit without exper-
iencing eye discomfort, or after
images on looking away again. Un-
less a lighting fitting will comply
with this test it should not find any

place in domestic lighting practice.
It is for this reason, if for no other,
that the all too familiar conical opal
glass shade, dangling at the end of
a flexible pendant, should be ban-
ished from the home.
Defective vision—a condition fre-
quently brought about by eye-strain
due to inadequate lighting, glaring
lighting, or excessively uneven
lighting—often results in poor
health, accidents, inferiority com-
plexes and backwardness at school.
On the other hand, every function of
vision, such as speed of reading, ac-
curacy and neatness in manual tasks,
etc., has always shown, under test,
improvement with adequate and
glareless illumination.
We therefore have a duty to pre-
serve and deal kindly with our sight
by providing the very best artificial
lighting that can be produced. Par-
ticularly is this so in the home
where there are children, for im-
mature eyes are extremely susceptible
to injury.
Lighting Principles.
A clear conception of lighting
principles can be obtained from a
study of light and shade in nature.
When the sky is overcast, the whole
of the light received comes from a
huge area. The eyes feel very com-
fortable under this condition of
lighting, there is an
entire absence of glare
and practically no
shadows. So, if in-
doors the lamps are
not visible and are so
arranged that all the
light leaving them is
directed upwards to
light the ceiling and
upper walls, the light-
ing effect will be very
similar to that found
out of doors on an
overcast day.
With this form of
lighting it is not found
necessary to carefully
study the placing of a
chair, or the angle at
which a book is held,
to enjoy comfortable

reading.. The almost complete ab-
sence of shadows, however, makes
the effect for residence lighting some-
what flat, as some degree of light
and shade is necessary to render
objects in their form.
On the other hand, on a clear day
with the sun shining brightly over-
head, very harsh,
clearly-defined shad-
ows will be cast. These
harsh shadows are
brought about by the
very small portion of
the total area of the
sky occupied by the
sun. Although this
condition may be
cheerful, it eventually
proves trying to the
eyes.
Indoors the same
effect is produced by
an unprotected lamp
suspended from the
centre of the room,
although light - col-
oured ceilings and
walls may assist in
softening the effect
by reducing the con-
trast. Reading then
becomes difficult, as unless con-
siderable pains are taken with
regard to the position in which we
sit, or the angle at which we hold
our book, annoying shadows will be
cast on the page, or dazzling reflec-
tions of the small light source from
the surface of the
paper will result.
The position of the
light source is also of
importance. When the
sun is directly over-
head it is in its most
favourable position for
eye comfort. We are
all familiar, however,
with the dazzling ef-
fects of the sun in the
late afternoon.
Our experiences thus
gained out of doors
point out the need for
studying the position
of lighting equipment
and for controlling the
brightness of this
equipment, and it fol-
lows that high mount-
ing, in certain circum-
stances, is preferable, and that
brackets and portable lamps should
be of low brightness.
The importance of the size of the
light giving area and its position can-

not be over-emphasised. The larger

diffusing fitting the lower will be

shadows.
Systems of Lighting.
The two principal lighting sys-

terns for the home are v therefore,
Direct and Indirect. With the direct
system the low;er portion of an in-
terior receives most of its light
directly from a visible lighting fit-
ting. Direct lighting from a singje
unit is not suitable for general il-
lumination in the principal rooms.
There are, however, a
number of special ap-
plications where direct
light can be effective.
With the .indirect sys-
tem the lower' portion
of the room receives
its light, indirectly by
reflection from the
ceiling and' upper
walls, which must
have a light-coloured
finish. The light
sources may be con-
cealed in opaque or
very dense bowls sus-
pended from the ceil-
ing, or in cornices,
wall urns or portable
lamps. The resultant
illumination is evenly
diffused, practically
shadowless and very
desirable in relieving
harshness, but used alone tends to be
uninteresting and monotonous.
To overcome the definite shortcom-
ings in each of these two systems—
harshness in the one and flatness in
the other—modified forms of each
can be combined. This combination
may be attained in
a variety of ways,
thereby providing lati-
tude for the expression
of individuality and
for variation to suit
the furnishing and
decoration of different
rooms. Indirect light-
ing may be enlivened
by the use of wall
brackets, illuminated
ornaments, portable
lamps, or some such
means of introducing
visible light sources
of low brightness some-
where about eye level.
From the combina-
tion of direct and in-
direct lighting

ary forms of illumina-

A.re “Cheap” Camps ?
THE PHOTOMETER SAYS “No!”
EVERY day tests are being carried out with the Philips
Photometer to demonstrate that so-called "cheap” lamps
are in reality a fraud—a wolf in sheep’s clothing. As each
day passes these tests prove more and more conclusively
that there are NO "cheap” lamps which may be relied upon
to give even a reasonable amount of light for current con-
sumed.
The figures on the blackboard are not an exaggeration.
They are the actual results of TESTS carried out with an
instrument which cannot waver in its accuracy.
THIS INSTRUMENT SHOWS BEYOND ALL DOUBT
THAT THE AVERAGE INEFFICIENCY OF "CHEAP”
LAMPS IS BETWEEN 20% AND 25%.
Why not save a quarter or more of the money you pay for lighting?
Better still, why not enjoy 25% extra light which may be
the means of preventing ill-health due to eye-strain?
It is a question of using Philips Lamps of the world’s highest quality,
or "cheap” inferior lamps which may cost a few pence less to buy,
but pounds more to use.
The choice is YOURS —but your pocket and your peace of mind
demand PHILIPS for the answer.

tion, viz., semi-indirect and wffiat may
be termed semi-direct. With semi-
indirect lighting the majority of the
light flux of the lamp is reflected
from the interior surface of the unit
in an upward direction, whilst a
lesser amount of light diffuses into
the room through the material of
which the unit is constructed. In
the semi - direct
form, which is typi-
fied by the totally
enclosed diffusing
unit, the proportion
of light received
directly from the
fitting is greater
than that reflected
from the ceiling
and upper walls.
Quantity of Light.
What size lamps
are required in each
room so that a suf-
ficiently high
lighting intensity
can be obtained?
In order to assist
home owners to a
fuller realisation of
the benefits of elec-
tricity, the Elec-
trical and Radio Development Asso-
ciation has introduced what is known
as the “Red Seal Scheme” of house
wiring, which incorporates recom-
mendations by the Illuminating En-
gineering Society of Australia of mini-
mum wiring requirements for the
lighting of each room. These are
shown in the above table.
It should be realised that these
are minimum requirements, and ad-
ditional outlets should be provided
for wall brackets, etc., and for the
lighting of pantries, cupboards,
closets or other places which are not
properly illuminated by general
lighting.
The colour of the wall and ceiling
finishes will have a considerable in-
fluence on the resultant illumination.
Matt white paints and papers give
the best results, reflecting upwards
of 30 per cent, of the incident light.
Whiteness, however, is rather cheer-
less and is usually confined to bath-
rooms and kitchens. The tones of
yellow between primrose and ivory are
very efficient, reflecting from 68 per
cent, to 77 per cent, of the light
striking them. The lighter shades of
grey also are good reflectors, reach-
ing as high as 72 per cent, for pearl
grey. The darker greys, together
with the browns, reds, blues and
greens, are poor reflectors of light,
varying between 20 and 40 per cent.
In calculating the sizes of the lamps
to be used, therefore, due considera-
tion should be taken of the wall and
ceiling colour, and where necessary,
wattages increased accordingly.
Householders are advised to al--
ways use lamps of recognised and
proved makes, which are guaranteed
to give the greatest light output Cor
current consumed consistent witn
high average life. Lamps for gen-
eral service are made in sizes of 15,
25, 40, 60, 75, 100, 150 and 200
watts. Larger sizes are, of course,
made, but they are not generally used
in the home. Up to and including
the 100 watt size, internally frosted
as well as clear glass lamps are
made, and the former should pre-
ferably be used in all cases. Also, gas-
filled lamps should be used in pre-
ference to the vacuum type, as they
give a greater light output.
Lighting Equipment.
In selecting lighting equipment for
the home, two points must be taken
into consideration:—
1. The Efficiency of the unit.
2. The Effectiveness of the unit.
Unfortunately these two factors
are often diametricaly opposed.
Efficiency of the
unit includes:—
(a) Control of the
light flux to
suit the occu-
pations that
will be car-
ried on in a
room.
(b) The ability to
transmit the
maximum of
light, so that
light is not
trapped i n
the materials
of the fitting
itself. Infer-
ior glass,
highly colour-
ed or orna-
mented, and
shades of silk, parchment and
celluloid absorb a great deal of
the light emitted by the lamp,
(c) The quality of diffusion or
freedom from glare. For opal
glass units the surface area
should not be less than two
sq. inches for each watt of
lamp rating to obtain low
surface brightness, and open
shades should be of such
shape and depth that lignt
cannot pass over or under them,
to strike the eyes.
Of equal importance with efficiency
is effectiveness. Fittings should har-
monise with their surroundings in
proportion, finish, design and posi-
tion, so that they become an unob-
trusive part of the whole, and should
be equally effective whether lighted
or unlighted.
The lighting equipment for the
home may be grouped under three
distinct headings;—
1. Overhead Fittings. These us-
ually constitute the principal light-
ing media in the home, and a limit-
less variety of shapes, styles and
finishes are available.
The semi-indirect fitting is pro-
bably the most effective for the liv-

SUNBEAM MIXMASTER.
The most talked
about and eagerly sought appliance since radio.
Beautiful with its lovely jade green bowls, highly practical for all beating,
whipping, mashing, juicing, creaming jobs, it takes the hard work out
of cooking.
It’s economical too, because it uses no more current than an ordinary light
bulb —and it makes ingredients go much farther.
• SUNBEAM COFFEE MAKER.
A dignified,
handsome appliance, beautifully proportioned—all lovely clear glass and
gleaming Chrome —to set off any table appointments.
Makes perfect coffee on the French drip method, quickly—cleanly. Only
glass, easily rinsed, comes in contact with the coffee. It’s a pleasure to
serve delicious coffee from this splendid Coffee Maker.
SUNBEAM AUTOMATIC IRON.
Beautiful streamline shape, tapering nose, cool, comfortable
handle, and a mirror-smooth soleplate that just glides through
the biggest day’s ironing with only a fraction of the usual effort
required.
This Master Automatic makes ironing easier and quicker too,
because its finger-tip control gives three separate heats. Low
for silks and other light materials, medium for dresses and such,
and high for damp heavy pieces.
Just set the switch at whatever heat you want, and the Sunbeam
itself maintains that heat exactly.

ing rooms, combining as it does effi-
ciency, comfortable lighting and
ample decorative possibilities with-
out detracting from its usefulness as
a lighting unit. It may take the
form of a single diffusing glass bowl
suitable for the larger sizes of lamp,
or a number of smaller bowls —each
containing a 25, 40 or 60 watt lamp
—arranged symmetrically around an
ornamental metal suspension; the
former being the most common.
Bowls which are so designed as to
prevent the free egress of the up-
ward component of light will act
virtually as light traps. The chief
disadvantage of this type of fitting 1
is the rapid accumulation of dust
and insects inside the unit, thus low-
ering its efficiency, but this trouble
may be minimised if the upper por-
tion of the unit is enclosed with clear
glass.
Semi-direct units do not offer the
same possibilities in colour treat-
ment if their usefulness as mediums
for illumination is to be retained,
and must depend entirely on their
form and diffusing treatment to
provide the decorative element. For
the purely utility rooms —bathroom,
kitchen, laundry, etc. —the semi-
direct fitting, in the form of the one
piece totally enclosing unit of opal
glass, provides the best results. In
general, semi-direct fittings should
be mounted high, or on the ceiling.
Straight out direct lighting from
overhead fittings is only suitable for
rooms which are devoted entirely to
meals, and should always be of low
surface brightness and so located and
dimensioned as to prevent direct light
rays from the lamp entering the
eyes.
2. Wall Brackets. —A very definite
need, both for utility and decoration,
is fulfilled by wall brackets. There
are three types—pendant, inverted
and candle. The former is usually
for utilitarian purposes. The in-
verted, or upright type may be in-
tended for either use, and provides a
beautiful method of decoration.
Candle brackets should usually be
depended on solely for decoration,
and unless low wattage tinted lamps
are used, should be well shaded. A
wall bracket on each side of the
dressing table, or of the bathroom
mirror is an excellent means of pro-
viding illumination for these im-
portant positions. It should be
noted that mirror lighting, to be really
useful, requires that a strong light
be directed on to the person using
the mirror, from a point in front
of and slightly above the head of
that person, and not on to the mir-
ror, as is often mistakenly done.
3. Portable Lamps.—A far greater
use should be made of portable
lamps, as they can solve many light-
ing problems in the home. There is
a tendency to select them for their
artistic qualities alone. This should
not be, as floor and table lamps are
obtainable, which, while being beauti-
ful, at the same time perform defi-
nite lighting functions. The shades
have a marked bearing on the use-
fulness of portable lamps. They
should be deep enough to screen the
lamp bulb from view when seated
in a low chair, and shaped to direct
the light where needed. The mater-
ial of which they are made should
be sufficiently diffusing to prevent
the bright line of the lamp filament
showing through. A light-coloured
lining in a silk shade is of consid-
erable value in this respect, as well
as assisting in more comfortable
lighting. Shades of parchment and
the denser types of non-inflammable
Bathroom:
Mirror lit with tubular bracket lamps.
celluloid are the best, and open-top
shades are preferable, as they permit
sufficient general illumination to pre-
vent sharp contrasts when, on occas-
ion, the portable lamp is the sole
light in use in the room.
Care should be taken in the choice
of colours. Red, blue, and green
wastefully absorb a great deal of
light. Generally the lighter toned
tints and mixtures in pink, orange
and yellow will give better results.
Wiring.
In order to enjoy the advantages
of good artificial lighting, adequate
provision of suitable wiring facilities
to convey the electric supply to them
is, of course, necessary.
In new buildings the wiring can
be installed to definitely suit any
type of fitting or lighting scheme de-
cided upon, but it should be kept In
mind that an existing installation
can, in the majority of 'cases, be
readily adapted to suit any addi-
tional or altered requirements.
Extra wiring can readily be car-
ried above the ceiling, or under the
floor, and it is practicable to carry
the conductors in cavity walls to
brackets and switches. Even with
solid wails, in most cases additional
wiring can be largely concealed Dy
running same in conjunction with
picture rails, door and window
frames, skirtings, etc.
For the connecting up of port-
able or semi-portable lights, and
lighting units incorporated in sep-
arate pieces of furniture, such as
dressing tables, beds, wardrobes, etc.,
the usual type of detachable plug
outlet fitted on the skirting is the
most convenient. But if these lights
are to remain in the one position
more or less permanently, a simpler
and cheaper means of connecting
them can be provided by a rosette
attached to the skirting board, to
which a suitable lead is connected,
and these points can be incorporated
in a lighting circuit carrying up tc
10 outlets.
It is felt advisable to stress the
point that as a rule it is not a diffi-
cult matter to alter and extend an ex-
isting installation, if necessary, to
enable advantage to be taken of mod-
ern and efficient systems of lighting,
and so to raise the home lighting
standard to that degree necessary to
preserve the eyesight not only of our-
selves, but of the whole family.

tY T - HEN Mr. Fisk says radio
” he means broadcast as
distinct from what has been
known for many years as com-
mercial wireless.
Considering all the circum-
stances, he says, our pro-
grammes compare favourably
with those of other countries,
and it is to he hoped that the
enthusiasm displayed by all
those responsible for the great
variety of entertainment now
available on the air will con-
tinue.
Power Output.
It is true that many of the sta-
tions abroad have a large power out-
put, such as the British Broadcasting
Commission’s new 150 K.W. instal-
lation at Broitwich, and perhaps we
shall see this tendency in Australia
in the near future.
However, like all problems with
which man has to grapple, these
larger powers present new difficul-
ties, even if they do make the task
of detection easier.
The introduction of broadcasting
has intensified the development of
super-receivers and drawn out the
greatest skill of scientific engineers,
which is apparent in almost every
home to-day.
Mr. Fisk told us at a luncheon re-
cently that he took samples of Aus-
tralian-made receivers to England
and America, and a number of the
leading manufacturers of those coun-
tries agreed that they conformed in
workmanship and performance side
by side with their own.
Needed Quality.
Undoubtedly the most criticised of
the arts to-day is radio, and now
that the novelty has disappeared,
listeners are becoming more discrim-
inating, and talk more about the
quality of the programmes. All the
scientific and manufacturing difflcul-
Broadcasting
A Review of Present and
Future Developments.
According to Mr. E. T. Fisk, Chairman
of Directors of Amalgamated Wireless,
who has just returned from a world tour of
investigation into wireless matters generally
development of the radio art in Australia
is highly satisfactory.
ties are taken for granted, and so
the designer must, amid a maze of
calculation and manufacturing de-
tail, keep paramount in his mind
the only things that really count,
quality and fidelity of reproduction.
There has been considerable ad-
vancement in studio design, and in
many countries very elaborate
schemes have been adopted to
create “atmosphere,” to balance
acoustics and to eliminate outside
interference.
Micro Rays.
Another interesting subject
about which he has been able to
tell us, is the experiments by Mar-
coni with micro rays. The indica-
tions are that a greater measure of
efficiency might be the outcome of
the use of these ultra high fre-
quencies. Already the extraordin-
ary performance of miniature trans-
mitters has been demonstrated, and
perhaps when some of the inherent
difficulties have been overcome,
this system might supersede others
for broadcasting purposes, more
particularly as experiments have
shown that atmospherics appear to
be less troublesome in that portion
of the spectrum. An outstanding
advantage, of course, would be the
accommodation of a vastly greater
number of stations on the air.
Tele vision.
A subject closely allied to
broadcasting as we know it to-
day is the all-important ques-
tion of television. Since the
first barrier has already been
broken down, the ever-expect-
ant humanity with which the
world is peopled to-day, look
forward to its early perfection,
but in Mr. Fisk’s opinion their
patience will be tried for some
appreciable time.
There seems little doubt,
ho'wever, that the first serious
step in the art of television will be
taken in the ultra-short waves owing
to the necessity for such a wide band
of frequencies.
Short Wave Broadcasting.
Considerable research has already
been carried out in Australia with
ultra-short 'wave broadcasting, and a
programme has been sent out at re-
gular intervals over the past two
years, concurrently with the transmis-
sion from VK2ME.
VK2ME is a short-wave Empire
Broadcasting service operating on 31
metres, which has drawn favourable
comments from all parts of the Brit-
ish Empire and other parts of the
world, including Europe and the
United States of America. This sta-
tion has been in operation since 192 7,
and was the first to plan a series of
programmes transmitted at such
hours that they would sychronise 'with
convenient listening times in various
parts of the Empire.
Although only one of the many
phases of wireless, broadcasting is
one of the arts that has been , popu-
larly adopted in every part of the
world, and most countries regard it
very seriously.


IN considering the
Australian National
Broadcasting Sys-
tem from the point of
view of the technical
services, it is perhaps
desirable in the first
instance to subdivide
the various activities,
which comprise the
following:—
(a) The planning of
the system,
(b) The design of the
stations, i.e., the
transmitters, their
installation and
subsequent opera-
tion.
(c) The provision of
the technical ser-
vices at the stu-
dios.
(d) The provision of
a network of lin(«s
suitable for the
transmission o f
programmes over
the whole network
throughout Australia
(c) The reception of broadcast pro-
grammes from overseas for re-
transmission through the Aus-
tralian system.
There are, of course, a number of
other technical activities, for example,
the detection of sources of interfer-
ence in broadcast reception, the ac-
curate measurement of the wave-
lengths or frequencies of all stations,
national, licensed and commercial.
While it is not proposed to discuss
these activities in any detail, they will
be recognised as being of very great
importance from the point of view
of the listener and the broadcasting
service in general.
In considering the planning of a
National Broadcasting System for
Australia, there are two underlying
features that must be remembered.
The first and perhaps more import-
ant is that the National Broadcasting
System is required to give satisfac-
tory service to a population of six
or seven millions of people resident',
over an area nearly equal to that of
Europe and practically equivalent to
that of the United States of America;
the second point is that the income
available for giving this service must

naturally come in the greater part
from the denser centres of popula-
tion around the capital cities in each
of the States.
The problem consequently becomes
one of great economic importance,
and differs substantially from that
with which most other administra-
tions are concerned, and in whose
countries there is a much higher
average density of population and
consequently of prospective listeners.
The broadcasting system for Aus-
tralia has been and is being devel-
oped on a well ordered plan which
necessarily embraces all aspects of
a technical and economic nature. It
will be appreciated that the devising
of such a system entails prolonged
study and the accumulation of data
of a varied character relating ro
the distribution of population, the
social, business and political interests
of the separate areas, the varying
geographical features of the Contin-
ent, the disposition of electric power
and telephone lines, the scientific
allocation of available channels, the
determination of relative radiated
power, and numerous other factors
which may have either a direct or
an indirect influence on the subject.
To fully satisfy all the
requirements is obvi-
ously impracticable,
and consequently the
ultimate plan must be
a compromise and have
for its objective the
National interest.
From time to tim«
there has been a dis-
position to criticise the
failure of the Depart-
ment to adequately
serve the country
areas, from which one
might gather that the
Post Office was ne-
glectful of the inter-
ests of the country,
which everyone must
recognise are vital to
the prosperity of Aus-
tralia, and particularly
to the prosperity of
her cities. By an im-
partial observer, how-
ever, it would be re-
cognised that develop-
ment must start where
the population is considerable and
where the financial and other re-
sources are consequently at a
maximum. Hence the erection of
stations in the capital cities as the
initial step. Unfortunately, the plan
of development has been seriously
interfered with owing to National
economic conditions which need not
be enlarged upon in this article, and
plans which were ready to be put
into execution years ag had to be
deferred until the threat of disaster
could be averted and until money
could be made available to proceed.
As will appear later, the activity
of the Department in this important
branch of its service gives substan-
tial evidence that better conditions
now prevail.
Coming now to the second division
of the work —the design and instal-
lation of stations, a new and entirely
different problem is presented. The
actual site on which the transmitter
is to be located is tentatively sel-
ected after a thorough theoretical
study has determined the probable
location. With this information as
a guide, a detailed survey is under

taken to ear-mark likely sites and,
generally speaking, a portable trans-
mitter is erected on each in order
to determine, by actual masurement
of the radiated energy received at
selected points, the relative suitabil-
ity of each position.
Figure 2: Short Wave Receiver installed
at Mont Park for overseas reception.
The design and provision of the
transmitter, the aerial system, the as-
sociated power plant, and inter-con-
necting programme channels are sim-
ultaneously taken in hand.
As a general rule, the policy of
the Department is to purchase the
transmitter by public tender, and to
provide the labour for the installa-
tion from officers of the Department,
who will be associated with the main-
tenance and operation of the equip-
ment after its service has been in-
augurated.
As already announced, tenders
have been accepted for seven addi-
tional stations, which will be incor-
porated in the National Broadcasting
System, and when these are avail-
able a considerable step forward will
have been taken towards the pro-
vision of a satisfactory service, not
only to the people in the cities, tut
to those in the country and somewhat
remote areas.
The stations now installed and
those proposed to be installed are
shown in Figure 1, and are as fol-
lows:
The next sub-division concerns the
provision of technical services at the
studios, and this, of course, involves
the closest co-operation with the Aus-
tralian Broadcasting Commission to
ensure that the provision made for
the methods of production, presenta-
tion and both programme and tech-
nical conti'ol shall be the best attain-
able. The acoustical properties of
studios are obviously also vital tech-
nical matters concerned with the ul-
timate radiation of a faithful repro-
duction of each class of programme
item.
Although it has been impracticable,
for reasons which will be evident,
to replace equipment and studios
which had to be acquired when the
National Service was inaugurated,
many improvements have been in-
troduced and in important details the
apparatus has been modernised to
bring it into conformity with tech-
nical development. The most mod-
ern types of microphone evolved in
the progressive broadcasting coun-
tries of the world have been tested
and different types have been in-
stalled in the main studios to give the
best results practicable with each
class of transmission that has to be
undertaken.
The provision of programme chan-
nels referred to under heading (d) of
the opening paragraph of this article
is a branch of broadcasting activity
which may not occur to the minds
of many unless they happen to be
intimately associated with the ren-
dering of broadcasting service. The
provision which has been made and
the changes which have been effected
in the electrical characteristics of
the long line telephone services of
the Commonwealth are of an ex-
tensive nature, and have given rise
to the solution of unique problems
made more difficult by the long dis-
tances to be traversed and conse-
quently entailing vital technical and
economic aspects. The peculiar nat-
ure of the problem in Australia has
resulted in technical developments
different from those hitherto utilised
in other parts of the world, but
which are now being adopted in cer-
tain other cases where there is a
similarity of conditions.

point to any group or the whole of
the stations embraced by the sys-
tem.
The services in the past have gen-
erally been provided over open wire
lines, which have satisfactory char-
acteristics in the frequency band
from 35 to 5,000 cycles, and the
transmissions have been at voice fre-
quencies. In the case of the Ade-
laide-Perth line, the cost of a sep-
arate pair of wires would have been
prohibitive, and a carrier telephone
system was designed and installed
on the existing wires between those
places which has enabled the more
important programmes originating in
Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and
Adelaide to be transmitted to Perth,
and thus provide for that area a
choice of programme matter much
more varied than otherwise would
have been possible.
Carrier services have also been in-
troduced to provide for the trans-
mission of a wider band of fre-
quencies for the long distances, and
to-day it is comparatively common
for a single programme to be simul-
taneously radiated through the ex-
tensive network of circuits reaching
from Rockhampton, through the in-
termediate coastal and other reg-
ions, as far as Perth.
Tenders have been invited for the
provision of a submarine cable be-
tween the mainland and Tasmania,
and when the cable is laid a channel
suitable for the transmission of all
types of programmes between the
mainland and Tasmania will be avail-
able. The completion of this work
will place Tasmania in a similar
position to that of Western Australia,
making it possible for the island
State to enjoy locally radiated trans-
missions which have their origin in
the main studios on the mainland.
The last subdivision mentioned in
the opening paragraph relates to the
reception of broadcasting programmes
from overseas, and in this connec-
tion the Department has provided at

distance short-wave services in all
except the most unfavourable cir-
cumstances. The receiver has been
designed so that practically the only
limit to reception of overseas pro-
grammes is that imposed either by
deep fading or, alternatively, too
high a noise level in comparison
with the level of the received signal.
It is connected by suitable pro-
gramme channels so that, when de-
sired, the overseas programmes may
be made available for radiation by
any one or all of the stations in the

T7’ LECTRICITT for Comfort and
Labour Saving, Radio for Com-
plete Entertainment and Happiness—
are again the keynotes of the Elec-
trical and Radio Exhibition of 1934.
It is the ninth annual display or-
ganised by the Electrical and Radio
Development Association, or ERDA,
as it is usually known. In continuing
to bring these latest products of mod-
ern science before the public, it can
be fairly claimed that the Association
is performing a very great service,
and the public’s response on each
occasion is an indication of its ap-
preciation.
In this 1934 Exhibition an even
greater variety of features and en-
tertainment than hitherto has been
planned to amuse the visitor, but, at
the same time, the utility side of
electricity has not been forgotten.
With the constant advance towards
the complete Electric Age there ex-
ists also a continuous need for edu-
cation, and this is one of the im-
portant objects for which the Exhi-
bition is conducted.
Regarding Your Visit.
On your journey round the E'xhi-
bition you will see demonstrations on
most Stands. Do not be afraid to
ask questions, for the attendants are
there to answer all your inquiries
and to advise you.
Cooking by electricity is featured
on a lavish scale this year, permit-
ting of the closest investigation into
the truth of the economy and effi-
ciency claimed. A new departure lies
in the fact that radio receivers may
be demonstrated, giving an unpre-
cedented opportunity to the prospect-
ive purchaser of seeing and hearing
under the one roof all the finest sets
on the Australian market to-day.
Before or after inspecting the ex-
hibits, listen in comfort in the gal-
leries to the splendid broadcast pro-
grammes from the model studio in
the Upper Hall. These have been ar-
ranged by the Australian Broadcast-
ing Commission, and talented artists,
perhaps a favourite, are here for
your entertainment.
Electric Restaurant.
The All-electric Restaurant in the
Lower Hall is an innovation for the
convenience of visitors. Morning and
afternoon teas will be served here at
6d. each person, While a most substan-
tial menu of grills and chip potatoes
or cold collation with salad, either
with roll and butter, tea or coffee, and
ice cream, for 1/-, is available be-
tween noon and 7 p.m. As implied, all
foodstuffs in the Restaurant are
cooked by electricity and, if you so
desire, you may see the chef prepare
your grill or other portion. The
cooking demonstration stand is ad-
jacent, where there are attendants
only too eager to answer your ques-
tions.
Entrances.
In the daytime, that is, between 11
a.m, and 5 p.m., enter the Exhibi-
tion from the Druitt Street side of
the Town Hall —through the porch
above the flight of steps.
During the late afternoon and in
the evening, from 5 p.m. to 10 p.m.,
entry is made by the Main Door on
the George Street side.
There are no other entrances. In-
side the halls there are directional
signs giving guidance to every sec-
tion.

Stand No. 9 Smith, Sons & Rees
Ltd., of 30 Wentworth Avenue,
Sydney, as New South Wales distrib-
utors for the Radio Corporation Pty.
Ltd., Melbourne, have introduced an
altogether new idea of radio enter-
tainment in their 1‘Astor” Mickey
Mouse Set. “Mickey” is amazingly
compact (the size overall is only lOi
x 7 x 51 ins.) and brings in all inter-
state stations without the necessity
of attaching aerial or earth wires. In
addition, the “Mickey” introduces a
companion speaker console (“Min-
nie”) for those who wish their radio
to be a portion of the home furn-
ishings. Operating through this
console, the “Mickey” provides tre-
mendous output of volume through
the Auditorium speaker built into the
floor model cabinet.
Other models on show are the lat-
est release of the well-known "Astor”
Arabian Nights series, namely, the
“Caliph” and the “Sultan.” The “Sul-
tan” incorporates all the latest feat-
ures, including A.V.C. visual tuning,
tone control and noise suppressor. An
inspection of this stand will be
worth-while to intending purchasers.
STAND NO. 10.
EVER-READY CO. (GREAT
BRITAIN) LTD.
A T the Electrical and Radio Exhibi-
tion, Stand No. 10 is occupied by
The Ever-Ready Company (Great
Britain) Limited.
This organisation, with its wide
range of batteries, torches, spotlights
and refills, can always be depended
on for a particularly bright display.
Added Interest attaches to the
fact that this year the New Super-
dyne Radio “B” Battery, 45 volts, is
on view. This battery supersedes the
well-known Super-Service Battery in
their line.
The Superdyne is a bigger and
better battery in every way, yet it
sells at the same price as the Super-
Service did. The Superdyne is big-
ger not only lln actual area, but
every cell is bigger, with increased
space for active working materials.
The result is obviously, greater out-
put and longer life from which it
may be gathered that the instant suc-
cess achieved by this new product
will be continued in an ever-growing
popularity.
STAND NO. 11.
ELECTRICITY METER MEG. CO.

range of very efficient radio, com-
prising all-wave and broadcast re-
ceivers, modern automobile sets, at-
tractive battery sets and compact

ness of everything—new valves, new
circuits, new lay-outs, new dials,
new cabinets, and even new merch-
andising methods which, no doubt,
will arouse considerable interest
among our dealers. The modernising
genius of Emmco is certainly strik-
ingly featured in this conspicuous
show.
Exhibited in conjunction with

display of the Electrice Automatic
Refrigerators manufactured by Em-
mco at Waterloo, Sydney. The

ber.

THE LAWRENCE & HANSON
ELECTRICAL CO LTD.
r IIHE Lawrence & Hanson Electri-
cal Co. are exhibiting a very fine
range of Smith’s Synchronous Elec-
tric Clocks. These clocks are shown

lish manufacture, and unfailingly
give the correct time without winding,
oiling or regulating.
Also on exhibit is the Compleat
Electric Range. This range operates
on 240 volts, but, by means of a
transformer, the voltage on the ele-
ments is reduced to 32 volts. This
gives the advantage of increased ef-
ficiency, and at the same time mak-
ing the stove entirely shockproof. A
tank is fitted under the oven, from
which hot water is always available.

on the Compleat Range, which is
daily demonstrated on the stand.

presenting every well-known and re-
liable make, as well as the models
exclusive to David Jones’. The range

AUSTRALIAN RADIO NEWS.
A S with previous Exhibitions, the
19 34 Radio and Ele'ctrical Ex-
hibition at the Sydney Town Hall
promises to have a large amateur
interest. At no time in the brief his-
tory of Australian Radio has interest
in short-wave radio been more in-
tense than at the present period. The
public now realise that there is some-
thing definitely entertaining about
listening to overseas short-wave pro-
grammes, by reason of vastly im-
proved apparatus for both transmis-
sion and reception. From the fas-
cination of short-wave listening it is
but a short step to amateur trans-
mission, for the listener becomes
more and more interested in , the
ceaseless doings of the amateur
transmitter.
Interesting conditions-, are ar-
ranged with prize money and a Cup
donated by “Australian Ra,dio News.”
A working demonstration of 5 metre
duplex radio-telephony will be in

ELECTRIC LAMP MANUFACTUR-
ERS (AUSTRALIA) LIMITED.
THHIS display features a typical Aus=
traliau-made lamp in every stage
of its evolution and demonstrates
with remarkable clearness the ac-
curacy and meticulous care which are
applied at all points—from the flang-
ing of the glass tubing to the actual
packing of the finished lamp. A par-
ticularly convincing method has been
adopted by this important exhibitor
to illustrate the fallacy that so-called
“cheap” imported lamps are more
economical than the all-Australian
products. In the centre of the Stand
is a “comparison box” showing a 50
candlepower "cheap” Jamp and a 40
watt Standard I.F. lamp of Austral-
ian manufacture. The difference in
the quality of light given is quite
obvious, and it is proved that the
cost of the ‘cheap” lamp over 1,000
hours is £l/0/7i, against 14/6 for the
Australian lamp.
The mechanical strength of Aus-
tralian-made lamps is demonstrated
in a particularly clever and convinc-
ing manner. A burning lamp is
loosely suspended from an arm which
projects from a model lighthouse. A
ball, liin. in diameter, is automati-
cally controlled so that it strikes
the lamp very sharply at regular
intervals. Although the light fails
momentarily from the shock, the lamp
itself is unimpaired and continues to
burn brilliantly.

MAKING RADIO HISTORY
with
A Revolutionary System
of Radio Communication
Pioneered and Developed By
Standard Telephones and Cables
'O
THE first public demonstra-
tion of Micro-Ray com-
munication was given by
Standard Telephones and
Cables Limited to a party of
British and Foreign Govern-
ment officials and Press re-
presentatives on the 31st
March, 1931, when two-way
telephonic communication
was established between
England and France on a
wave length of only 18 centi-
metres.
So highly successful was this
epoch-making demonstration
that the British and French
Air Ministries subsequently
placed an order with Stan-
dard Telephones and Cables
Limited to manufacture and
install Micro-Ray apparatus to
operate between the British
Aerodrome at Lympne and
the French Aerodrome at St.
Inglevert.
This service, which marks a
new era in radio communi-
cation, was officially opened
with complete success on the
27th January last.

THE STORY OF THE MICRO-RAY
A Revolutionary Form of Radio Transmission
(Told by R. S. Beckwith, Technical Director, Standard Telephones and Cables (A’asia.) Ltd., Sydney.)
Fig. 1. Arrangement of Transmitting Aerial and Reflector.
By far the most outstanding development in the art
of radio communication of late years has been the prac-
tical utilisation of what have been termed the ultra-
ultra-short waves, that is, waves of a length of less than
one metre.
In any system of radio communication, excepting such
obsolete systems as the damped-wave or spark system,
the very first essential is a reliable and easily control-
lable generator of a carrier wave of the required fre-
quency. This carrier wave may be modulated by speech
currents, as in broadcasting and radio telephony by a
tone as in C.W. telegraphy or may itself be broken up
as in I.C.W. telegraphy.
The invention of the thermionic valve placed in the
hands of the radio engineer an almost ideal generator
of the type necessary and the later addition of a quartz
crystal to the oscillatory circuit of the valve whereby
extreme accuracy and constancy of frequency were as-
sured appeared finally to solve the question of the car-
rier wave generator for all time. As the more easily
utilised radio frequencies were allocated for one service
or another and still further allocations were boing de-
manded, the radio engineer was constantly driven up-
ward in the scale of frequencies, or what is the ame
thing, downward in the scale of wave lengths and hod
to devise ways and means of making use of “short 1 '
waves down to 15 metres, next of “ultra short” waves
down to one or two metres and finally had to bring
serious thought to bear on the problem of using the
“ultra-ultra-short” waves of length less than one metre.
Here he encountered a serious difficulty in that no type
of thermionic valve available could be made to oscillate
at such high frequencies.
It must be realised that, for a wave length of say 18
centimetres, the valve is required to oscillate at a fre-
quency of over 1600 million cycles per second and it
really appeared that, fast as electrons travel, they had
so far to go in an ordinary valve that they could not
accomplish the round trip required of them in the time
allotted. An attempt was made to shorten the elec-
tronic path by making a valve in which clearances be-
tween electrodes were reduced to microscopic dimensions
—less than one-thousandth of an inch. Such a valve
could not be used practically—its tiny clearances ren-
dered it weak, subject to uncertain variation and unable,
to withstand the necessary voltages applied to it.
Another attempt, known as the Barkhausen system
achieved a result by reversing the polarity of the elec-
trodes in the valve from the usual arrangement—cathode
and anode became negative and grid highly positive.
Still another attempt utilised an external magnetic field
and by inter-action between this field and the electron
stream in the valve high frequency oscillations were
produced. All these attempts, however, failed to pro-
duce anything of any practical value.
The problem was tackled in the London and Paris
laboratories of the world-wide S.T.C. system—the I.T. &
T. Laboratories—and after the usual trials and failures
the “micro-radion” was evolved in 1929, the British pa-
tent being applied for in December of that year. The
micro-radion, while having the dimensions of an ordin-
ary valve, makes use of an entirely new principle—the
inter-action of several electron streams —in producing a
sustained train or
oscillations at the
required high fre-
quency and having
sufficient energy to
be of practical use.
The invention of
this device, while
being a great step
forward, did not
alone solve the
whole problem of
providing a com-
munication system
and research engi-
neers and radio en-
gineers working in
collaboration in the
I.T. & T. Labora-
tories spent many
months in intensive
Fig. 2. Illustrating the action of
Reflector System,
investigation before it was finally possible to stage a
demonstration under practical conditions.
The wonderful demonstration given to a large party
of British and Foreign Government officials, engineers
and ‘press representatives on March 31st, 1931, during
which telephonic speech received at loud speaker strength
was transmitted between Dover and Calais on a radio
wave length of 18 centimetres is, no doubt, still fresh in
the minds of those familiar with "radio matters. This
demonstration marked a definite milestone in the pro-
gress of the communication art and served as an inspira-
tion to investigators throughout the world, giving them
a fresh starting point.
It is impossible to forecast with any certainty the fu-
ture possibilities of this epoch-making invention the
“micro-radion” valve and of the “micro-ray” system.
One aspect alone will appeal to the television enthusiast.
So long as television is restricted to the medium or
short-wave band, the definition and clarity of transmit-
ted pictures will be poor, due to the comparatively nar-
row side bands available,
A distinct advantage of the micro-ray system as ap-
plied to commercial communication use lies in the fact
that there is no need to resort to frequency-inversion,
scrambling or wobbling to ensure secrecy.
That the system has already taken its place as a prac-
tical means of communication is shown by the recent
opening of a micro-ray communication link between the
aerodromes of Lympne, Kent, England, and St. Inglevert,
Boulogne, France, the equipments being supplied by
S.T.C. companies to the orders of the British and French
Air Ministries. The appended illustrations show the
principal parts of the equipment and indicate how com-
pletely micro-ray apparatus differs from the hitherto
standard types of radio transmitters.
