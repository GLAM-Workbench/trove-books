The Unofficial Squeal of D Company 3rd Battalion N. Z. R. B.
DID YOU HEAR
THAT:-
The mermaids are
objecting to the men
using so much salt water.
Please dry up, boys.
None of our officers
have, so far, tripped over
their swords.
Lieuts. Mullany and
Topliss are going to
wrestle; the best out of
three falls. Weights are
not known.
The Marconi man
on board had lodged a
complaint to the skipper.
It is alleged that he was
mistaken for "Sparks"
of " A " Coy.
The officers object to
riflemen on parade, ask-
ing them for matches to
light their cigarettes-
Lieut. Clarke is the
sleeping partner in a
yellow two-seated car in
Albany. We wonder-
"A" Coy. got the
prize for the best kept
dormitory and mess-
room. Good luck," A."
We hear that the
band had two new play-
ers last week for a little
while. One played the
Drum (and) the other
played the side-drum like
a Jolly Rodger.
The band have had
the offer of a lightning
conductor (off the mast.)
One of the firemen
on board, when he saw
the signallers at practice,
asked if they had all got
St. Vitus Dance.
A certain Sergeant
of " B " Company has had
his chevron sewn upon
his shirt sleeve. Is he
afraid the boys would not
recognise him with his
tunic off.
Most of the men
would not hold out their
hands for their wages
last week. They picked
it up with their forefinger
and thumb.
During the rain
storm on the 24th the
Captain of the ship saw
the water running down
the scuppers very black
and dirty. Upon making-
enquiries, he found that
some of the men and
Non-coms, of D " Com
pany had taken advan-
tage of the rain and were
having a fresh water
bath.
Our chaplain advises
all men to have two cold
baths daily. Does he
mean to infer that the
men are dirty ?
The goat has at last
found something diges-
tible : one of "A"
Company's men caught
him eating a last issue
of D/ 3. We always knew
that goat had been well
educated-
"Sniper" Basset of
"B" Coy. has been
promoted to 16th
engineer. He started as
stoker, but now he has
charge of one of the
largest engines on the
boat. He does not know
what the engine is used
for, but he says it goes,
"Snowy" Thompson
of " A " Coy. is dying to
fight someone. What
about Eastgate, Snowy?
He is about your weight.
He does not believe in
your wireless messages.
Do not look for torpedoes
in the dark snow, but
always take a box of
matches with you.

object to smoking.

VALEDICTORY.
It is with the utmost regret that we learn of Chap-
lain Major Burgin's transfer to H. M. N. Z.T. 43 (Mokoia)
at Colombo. Although we have had the pleasure of his
Company for only these last three weeks, we have one
and all learned to thoroughly respect and admire him,
and also to find out for ourselves, how broad-minded and
generous-hearted he is. He was the chief instigator
in forming the Entertainment Committee and has
spared no efforts to make things as pleasant as possible
for all on board. We all feel sure that what is our
temporary loss is the Mokoia's gain. We wish him
Koiora and a safe trip during the remainder of the
voyage, and trust that when we meet him again, he will
still be the same smiling Mr O'Reilly.
His lecture last week is one that will not be for-
gotten by those who heard it; the men are bound to
study it and think for them-
selves the purport of it. We
are sorry for obvious reasons
we cannot publish his lecture.
LEADER.
JUDGING by the favour-
able comments passed upon
our first issue of the D/ 3,
there is no doubt as to the
success of our future numbers.
The Officers and men of the
Company responded nobly,
when asked to subscribe, so as
to enable us to make a financial
success of our paper. We have
also to thank the Officers and
men of the other Companies for
the interest they have dis-
played and also for their help
as subscribers.
We wish to impress upon
our readers the fact that we do
not wish our contemporary,
" The Blast " any ill-will. In
fact, in future we intend to give
them all the assistance we can,
providing it will accept same.
We fully realise its importance
as the 'ship's paper, and as
such, should be supported by
all and sundry with contribu-
tions as well as subscriptions.
We do not propose setting
up as an opposition paper;
nothing is further from our
minds. Our position is that we
feel it our duty towards the
men on board to run a paper
for the men, to chronicle their
doings, also to impart a little
humour from our pages of the
Officers as well as of the men.
We understand and realise that
the Officers, apart from being
gentlemen, are ' jolly good
sports," trusting they will
pardon our saying so.
We will continue to issue
our paper at each port of
call and during our sojourn in Egypt, or wherever
may be sent. All we ask is that each man will do his
best for us so as to enable us to continue our gooc wor
A NATURALISED BRITAIN.
A naturalised Briton, what folly is this ?
A fig for such humour and vapour.
Is Satan made fit for the regions of bliss


By signing a mere scrap of paper "
When morals are lacking or honour is dead,
Pray, what is the worth of parole ?
A small bit of preaching may turn a man's head.
But that doesn't alter his soul.
Apostle or proseylite—both if you like;
It comes to the same in the end,
A double-faced man is far worse than a "tike,"
A turncoat is never a friend.
A man who turns dog on the land of his birth
Is not to be trusted, for sure;
An office-made pedigree what is it worth ?
Will it hold if the blood isn't pure ?
"A wolf in sheep's clothing," is mostly in luck,
And easily comes by a feed.
A hen that is clucking may hatch out a duck.
But that doesn't alter the breed.
You may fit up a dog in the skin of
a goat;
The dog wouldn't bleat if you did ;
But he'd certainly play from a
different note
When bled for a quarter of kid.
Be kind to the stranger that enters
your gate,
But this is the gist of my sermon ;
It is no good to juggle and tinker
with fate —
A German is always a German !
He appearsto be British and loyal,
of course.
While true to the land he was born in,
So don't put a cow-cover over a
horse
And expect to get milk in the
morning.

POET'S CORNER
You ask what of the 15th ? but we hardly like to tell,
For judging by their character
We think they're going to —,well
In camp they were notorious,
So we think they should be barred
For 'tis- known they smuggled whiskey
Past the unsuspecting guard-
Uastly conies the 16th, all poor simple little things,
We think when they're on nights attacks
They should be given wings;
For in the dark they all get lost
And wander o'er the plains,
Until their poor Commander thinks
"Do they ever use their brains." R.G.D.

And " Hock the cellar door"
And its "Do be careful not to

Then their duties are all manned.

They may dwell in the South for a

They may speak the Southron's
tongue;
They may live a life that is free
[from strife,
Their books and desks among.
But conies a day when they hear a
sound,
And again they are fighters all —
For lives there a Scot who answers not
When the pipers call and call.
And none but a Scot can understand
What the skirling bagpipes say
Of the dear, grey North, whence these sons came forth,
The land that is far away.
And out from the office doors they come,
And away from a thousand ties ;
For the skies may fall, but they heed the call,
Or feel that their honour dies.
There's never a Scot but wears the look
That his fighting father's wore,
As he swings his kilt to the mad'ning lilt
Of the pipes that go before.


MOCK COURT.
Saturday, 26th February, 1916.
Great excitement was caused on board when it was
announced that a Mock Court would he held to cele-
brate the crossing of the equator or the " line " as it
is generally spoken of.
The Right Honourable, The Lord Mayor of Tarry -
diddle, officiated as Judge and looked very sedate in
his robes of yellow hue, and judging by the determined
manner which he took his seat, the prisoners had a
very poor chance of having justice meted out to them
(we hear take the liberty of informing our readers who
are ignorant of the true meaning of " Tarrydiddle"
that " Tarry " means to linger, and " diddle," to mess
about.) The Crown Prosecutor, Earle's Court, was at
his best, and when the Clerk of the Court ushered in
his first prisoner " Sgt. Penny" the poisonous "gas
king" he stated the case for the Crown in brilliant
style.
After charging prisoner with his crime, His
Worship asked him if he had anything to say in his
defence. Prisoner replied, "Your Honour, I plead guilty
to having poisonous gas in my possession, but simply
for experimetal purposes." Judge : " Is the gas really
poisonous?" Prisoner: "Why, Your Plonour, it has
just about killed all my mates, but I myself think it
is a failure." In summing up the Judge fined the
prisoner 6d. for it being a failure, 1/- for telling a lie,
as the Crown Prosecutor had proved conclusively
that the poisonous gas had done its fatal work. In
default the prisoner was to be handed over to the Exe-
cutioner. Prisoner gladly paid the fine-
The next case which was of a more serious nature,
was that brought against the Sergeant Cook, in that
he did wilfully and knowingly persist in cooking dead
fish The prisoner with a very worried expression
upon his hard countenance pleaded " not guilty." His
Honour, in addressing the prisoner, said that it was
a most barbarous act. The prisoner was not con-
tent with killing the said fish, but he must needs jump
on them, boil them, and dish them up for human
consumption. The prisoner replied that he did not
cook dead fish. He stated that they were alive as all
the men could attest. The Crown Prosecutor here
further charged him with throwing the dead fish over-
board and cooking the live ones, to which evidence
the prisoner failed to reply. His Plonour, in summing
up, said that he had already expressed his feelings as
regards the inhuman act, and it was altogether a fishy
business, so the prisoner was fined 1/- and a further
fid. for giving the sharks indigestion. .Should the fine
be not forthcoming, the prisoner to be handed over to
the executioners. Needless to say, the prisoner elected
to pay the fine in preference to a bath amidst the
derision of the crowd.
The next prisoner, Q. M. S. Doyle, who was ordered
a ducking for collaborating with the Sergeant Cook in
such a "scaly" job, tried several times to escape but
was eventually thoroughly doused much to the amuse-
ment of the gallery.
Chaplain Major Burgin was next brought before
the bench and charged ("with persistently leading a
hard life, and leading the men astray.) In opening the
case the Crown Prosecutor stated that this was a very
case, inasmuch as the prisoner had been brought up
amidst good surroundings, but in his early youth had
been tempted sorely, and this was his 14th appearance
within twelve months. Asked by His Worship, if
he had anything to say for himself, the prisoner replied
that he had always been badly fed. He also stated
that it was laid down in the Army regulations that
thin men like himself, were entitled to ten meals per
day, whereas he was only getting six. Judge: "You
are fined fid. for being thin, a further 2/- for being such
a notorious character, and a ducking." The excitement
was intense when the jovial chaplain bared his "soles."
Lieut. Rodgers was charged with a most serious
crime which modesty forbids us publishing in this
issue. He was
remanded to a
higher Court
(tennis or
otherwise.)
The next
case was that
of Lieut. Mull-
any, who was
charged with
wilfully refus-
ing marriage
in a West Aus-
tralian port, to
wit, Albany.
This prisoner
who is a rather
delicate - look-
ing specimen
of humanity
was marched
to the Court
under an es-
cort of six


stalwart police and collapsed before the scathing eyes
of the Judge. On being charged the prisoner stated
that he had a small wife and a large family to support
in N. Z. Judge: "You look as though could support
three wives and numerous families. Take him away
and drown him."
6*Other serious charges were brought against:—
Lieut. Gray (censored) for opening his chums letters with
a view to furthering his own ends with the ladies.
S. M.'s Randle and Tansey for going on the Ran Tan
in Wellington.
Major Cowles for impersonating Charley Chaplin with
evil intent.
Lieut Ferriday- For not giving the ladies of Albany
the glad eye.
Lieut. Flemming. Su-
perabundance of dig-
nity and not wearing
enough stars.
C a p t . Drummond.
Charged with having
no visible means of
support.
Lieut. Topliss. For ill-
treating Lieut. Mull-
any (a most cowardly
and brutal action )
Capt. Sare. For not
donning a crown ins-
instead of an extra
star.
Capt. Marlev. For
missuse of hose.
Sergt. Wastney. Com-
mitting bigamy (the
lady was known as
Big Amy.)
Sergt.-Major Smeales.
For working points
on board. (And ne-
glecting to subscribe
to the funds of the
Railwaymen's
Union.)
Sergt. llarley. Wife
desertion and flirt-
ing with Flossie.
Lieut. Cock F or

ports w i th o u t
paying his fare.
Lieut. Scoular. F or
losing both himself
and his temper in
night operations.
Sergt. Bernard. Selling
liquor after!"hours.
(Can't e'en keep so-
ber himself.) -
S. M.'s. McGahan and Isbeiter. Using Samoan
Language and not addressing each other as Sergeant.
Capt. Horsnell. For working his passage and creating
a disturbance.
Capt. Bishop. For smoking on the sly between decks.
As our space is limited we will require to withhold
the other cases until our next issue.
Capt. Magnay as The Right Hon. The Lord
Tarrydiddle made an excellent Judge; his witty re-
marks bringing forth peals of laughter.
Lieut. Closey as Crown Prosecutor proved himself
very efficient, and ably handled the cases brought before
the bench.
Major Murphy as Executioner showed that besides
being a gentleman and a soldier (a really marvellous
combination) that he could manipulate the hose as well
as any fireman (we mean the rubber hose). Needless
to say during his duties as Executioner the Major was
doused equally as much as the prisoners.
The proceedings terminated with Capt. Harley
working a rearguard action with the hose soaking the
Judge, Crown Prosecutor, jury and all present, much
to their consternation.
" WITH THE COMPLIMENTS OF THE
BRIGADIER-GENERAL."
I have the honour
to report that, owing
to a nervous break-
down, the Battalion
will not parade to-
morrow. I would like
your instructions as to
how the fatigue work
of the ship can be ar-
ranged. My suggestion
is:—
2nd Lieuts. in
charge of Lance-Corpls.
Clean the brass work.
Ist Lieuts. in
charge ofßfm.
Canteen Fati-
gue.
Captains in
charge of a de-
tention man.
Guard work.
Sergeants being
used to disci-
pline. No one
in charge clean
decks and at-
tend to all
Rfm. requiring
their assis-
tance.

We have it on good
authority that the
ship's goat is suffering
from acute indigestion
as a result of
swallowing a magazine. We are wondering if the afore-
said mag. was " The Blast" as some of the articles are
rather indigestible; anyway the goat is appearing on
sick parade to-morrow, when the mystery will be solved
with the aid of a stomach pump.

GREAT CAPTURE
THE 3RD BATTALION AT IT AGAIN.
On Wednesday evening, 16th February, the capture
of the first prisoner of war, was made by R. S. M. Smeal
on H. M. Tug-of-War, Blucher, at Albany jetty wharf.
On arrival alongside the Transport N. M. N. Z. T. No. 42,
the enemy completely surrounded the R. S. M. and his
capture, and after some difficulty, assisted by the ship's
Quarter Master, had the prisoner placed in the Battalion
Headquarters Orderly Room under the ever watchful
eye of the Adjutant. Evidently the Adjutant did not like
the evil smell of the brute and had him removed
to the canteen. Now he has stowed away somewhere.
What about a search party to find it (the keg) ? or is it
going by reinforcements to the Officers' mess?
BATTALION ORDERS NO. 2.
LIEUT.-COI.ONEL SCREWBACK, C.B. (10 DAYS.)
1. OFFICERS' MESS. —All officers will parade on
Forecastle Deck half an hour before meals, where they
will be formed up two deep and be marched to the mess.
The Colonel has hopes that by this method an improve-
ment in officers' behaviour will be noticed, as their
conduct in the past has resembled the crowd at a foot-
ball match.
2. BATHING PARADE. —It has been decided that
in future Billy the Goat, the Monkey, the Dog, all Cats
and Cockroaches will be paraded at midnight by the
Adjutant for bathing parade He will then hand t e
squad over to Lieutenant Rogers, who will see that they
all have a thorough hosing.
3. BAD LANGUAGE- —In consequence of a com-
plaint reaching Headquarters that an officer was guilty
of using the word d ... nin front of the men it is re-
quested that any N.C O. or man who has a complaint on
this score should immediately put same in to Battalion
Headquarters in writing.
4. COOLNESS UNDER FIRE. —It must be under-
stood that, under fire, heads must be worn on the top of


the shoulders. The loss of heads may be prevented by— 9
(1) Holding the head on : 66
(2) Keeping the head down : or 67
(3) Removing oneself from the presence of the 62
enemy at the double. 74
Officers must particularly note these instructions. 53
5. BUNKS. —In future these are expected to be 73
tused only as ornaments- Any man found using these at 34
any time but more particularly between Lights Out and gg
Reveille will be severely dealt with. The bunks must 425
be kept perfectly clean as with the monkey, &c., we gg2
have quite enough mascots for one battalion. gig
6 PARADE. —Men reporting sea-sick on parade 4591
will be allowed to fall out and sit down ; the others will
find they have to fall-in and sit-up. 473
7. INSPECTION. —During the remainder of the ggi,
voyage an inspection of the ship will be made daily by 433
the Detention Men ;on no account are the officers to 4QQ
stand to attention or are N.C.O.'s and men to salute 474
when rounds are on 44Q
8. SWEEPING DECKS. —Reference 8.0. 45, part I, 377
Para. 4. "In future the decks will be swept by the ggg
watch at 12-30 p.m. daily." It is requested that the gg 3
men will not use wristlet watches for this purpose. G o g
(Sig: ed) P. Q. R. S. T. McTURK, 706
Adjutant. 575
LOST. —Some few (?) Bugle Notes. As the effi- 579
ciency of the Bugle Band is impaired by this, it is 455
hoped that shoulcj anyone find any of these lying about 424
that they will instantly bring them to Battalion Head- 415
quarters and thus assist in giving us the best bugle 589
band north or south of the line. 584
PROMOTIONS. —Captain Jno. B. to be Lance- 575
Corporal, Lieutenont R. to be Captain with command 594
of Battalion Menagerie. 598
