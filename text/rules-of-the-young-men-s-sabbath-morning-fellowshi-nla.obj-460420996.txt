“ Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way ? By taking heed
thereto according to thy word.” Psalm cxix., 9.
“ Then they that feared the Lord spake often one to another ; and
the Lord hearkened and heard it; and a book of remembrance was
written for them that feared the Lord, and that thought upon his name.”
Malachi iii., 16.


TO YOUNG MEN.
We have much pleasure in intimating to you that we have
a Young Men’s Sabbath Morning Fellowship Association in
connection with our congregation, and we beg cordially to
invite you to become a member of it. You have here pre-
sented to you a copy of the Rules, from a study of which you
will see that our object is to promote the Spiritual and Moral
well-being of each other —by meetings for praise, prayer, and
study of the Scriptures. Each member is afforded an oppor-
tunity of taking part in the exercises, but it is not imperative,
though it is very desirable that he should do so. The
exercises are intended to be of the simplest kind, and although
you may feel a little hesitancy in taking part in them at first,
you will soon get familiar with what is required, and find the
doing of it, easy, pleasant, and profitable. We invite you
then to join us. If you won’t become a member of our
Association, please attend our meetings as a visitor and a
friend. Anyhow, “ Come with us and,we will do thee good,”
—we can assure you of a kindly and hearty greeting.
