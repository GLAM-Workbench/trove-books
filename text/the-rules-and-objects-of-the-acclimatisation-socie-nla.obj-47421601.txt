REPORT
OF THE
PEOVXSIOHAL COMMITTEE
TO THE MEMBERS OF THE
Sffriftjr of Uictorhr.
7th AUGUST.
In coming before you to render up their charge into your
hands, your Provisional Committee beg to present the following
brief sketch of their proceedings since their inauguration on the
25th of February last.
The posts of Hon. Treasurer and Hon. Secretary having been
kindly undertaken respectively by Messrs. T. J. Sumner and W.
H. Archer, one of the first things necessary appeared to be the
appointment of a Collector, who could also undertake clerical
duties; and from a large number of applicants, Mr. W. Coleman
was unanimously appointed to the office.
As it was obviously of the greatest importance that the estab-
lishment of the Society, with its objects, should be made known
as promptly and extensively as possible, a circular was prepared
and forwarded to almost every leading colonist in town and
country. And your Committee congratulate the Members on
the fact, that, even at this early stage, they were enabled to
annex to that circular a very handsome list of Subscriptions and
Donations, which has since been very considerably increased.
Still further to extend a knowledge of the functions of the
Society, a very able lecture, opportunely delivered by Dr. Buck-
land, before the Society of Arts, in London, was reprinted and
circulated gratuitously to the extent of 2000 copies.
Very gratifying responses have been received to these over-
tures from numerous and distant quarters, and it is satisfactory


to know that the existence and intentions of the Society are now
fairly understood in this and the adjacent colonies, —and even at
home, in Prance, India, and other countries of the highest value
as sites for interchanges.
It will he remembered by the Members that the Provisional
Committee of the Acclimatisation Society consisted of the original
Zoological Committee, appointed by the Government; and it will
be necessary, to prevent confusion, to bear in mind the existence
of two bodies, similar in their objects, and exercising like func-
tions—the one appointed by the Government; the other, at
present, nominated by the Members. In the rules prepared for
your approval, it is intended to amalgamate these separate bodies
in one effective council.
As a Zoological Committee, your Provisional Committee learned
that considerable progress had been made in securing a new and
valuable site for their operations in the Eoyal Park, and ener-
getic steps have been taken to acquire so safe a tenure as would
justify your Committee in expending upon the park the funds at
their disposal.
Very serious delays have, however, unfortunately arisen in the
action of the Government, but we have every reason to hope that
we shall shortly be put in possession of the park.
Your Committee would remind you that the arrangement has
long since received Legislative sanction, in a vote of “ £lOOO for
fences and buildings in the Eoyal Park, for zoological purposes.”
To be ready to avail themselves of this concession as soon as it
should be made, your Committee advertised for designs for laying
out the park on a system of landscape gardening, and after due
examination, ably aided by Mr. Skene, of the Hoard of Land and
Works, they awarded the prize of £25 for the best design to Mr.
Alfred Lynch; acknowledging the ability and valuable sugges-
tions contained in several of the other designs submitted.
Other votes than that referred to have passed the Legislature ;
£2OOO, namely, for the introduction of a further supply of pure
Alpacas, £5OO for the introduction of the Salmon, and £5OO for
other animals.
To facilitate the object of the first of these votes, your Com-


mittee invited Mr. Ledger to visit Melbourne, and have arranged
with him to undertake a task for which his local knowledge and
great experience ably qualify him. The £SOO for the Salmon
was remitted, as previously agreed upon, to the Government of
Tasmania, in aid of the very handsome sum of £3OOO granted for
this purpose by that Government; a suggestion being made, that
although it was conceived desirable that the first experiments
should be made in Tasmanian rivers, in the event of large num-
bers of ova or fry being landed, a portion should be at once
placed in the rivers of Gipps Land. The £SOO for other animals
has still to be disposed of.
Your Committee have ventured to nominate two Honorary
Members—Mr, Ledger, in testimony of his great services to the
cause of acclimatisation by the introduction of a large number
of Alpacas to Australia; and Mr. Landells, in part payment of a
male Dromedary, which it was considered desirable to secure for
the purpose of keeping up the breed of this valuable animal, the
great bulk of the herd of which has been taken away for explo-
ration purposes ; and your Committee trust that the nomination
of these gentlemen may meet with the approval and confirmation
of the Members.
Many offers of co-operation and interchange of good offices have
flowed in from various quarters—amongst others from Ceylon,
Madras, Calcutta, California, and other distant places, and from
many of these ports consignments of valuable animals are already
taking place. An effective system of interchange must be or-
ganised at an early day, and for this purpose numerous offers
of native animals are constantly coming in.
The financial condition of the Society is satisfactory, the sub-
scriptions and donations already amounting to £949 ss. 6d.; the
sums actually received to £707 ; the balance in the hands of the
Treasurer amounting to £424 ss. 7d., exclusive of the £5OO voted
for the introduction of animals, the sums voted for fencing t the
Eoyal Park, and for the introduction of the Alpaca.
And the following list of animals, birds, and fishes, already
collected, mainly for acclimatisation purposes, will be found large,
varied, and valuable :

constant services to the Society of Dr. Mueller, the Government
Botanist. Considering the various and important calls upon the
attention of this gentleman, your Committee can only express
their surprise at the time and attention he has been able kindly
to devote to the interests of the Society, and acknowledge, with
gratitude, the incessant zeal exhibited and the valuable assistance
received from him. Upon the continuance of his services will in
no slight measure depend the future success of the Society.
Your Committee have great pleasure in expressing their thanks
to Mr. Edward Wilson for his late very able and interesting


lecture on the objects of this Society, delivered at the Mechanics’
Institution on the 24th ultimo, his Honour the Chief Justice in
the Chair.

Your Committee now beg to lay before you a code of Kules
prepared for your consideration; and in rendering this account
of their proceedings, to beg of you to < undertake the task of
electing a permanent Council, to which shall he delegated the
duty of watching henceforward oyer the interests of the Society.
