LICENSES,


Exercise. —Mental and Bodily Exercise is absolutely es-
sential to Man’s general health and consequently his happi-
ness. Excessive and violent exercise may produce as great
evils as its want occasions. The exact amount of exercise
most beneficial, depends upon the individual capacity.
Temperance. —Those who practice temperance and avoid
extremes seldom have reason to regret it. Let those who
place their heads knowingly in the yoke bear the burden and
let those be deceived who say will follow deceivers.”
Value of Time. —Be ever mindful of the value of time, re-
member, that by rising every morning at six instead of eight,
in the course of forty years you may snatch from loss, ten
years, of eight hour days, and if this be devoted to the culti-
vation and improvement of your mind, you may realize that
which will not only render you infinitely more capable of
carrying out business undertakings, but that which will also
befit you a Bright Ornament of Society, and entitle you to the
admiration and respect of all around you.
Caution. —For every step you gain in position, look more
carefully to your ways-for the fall of the highest, is the great-
est.
Pride. —Beware of Pride ! she seeks to look well in the robes
of the great, but will bring upon you Contempt and many
evils. Her extravagance will lead you to certain ruin.
j Frugality. —Frugality is an unpretending Tree that grows
in the garden of contentment and understanding-her fruit is
Wealth and Happiness.
Contentment. —Pray not so much to have your wants sup-
plied, as for contentment with the supplies that you already
nave. For the more your wants are supplied the greater they
grow in number.
Business Halits. — Be prompt and decisive with your
customers, do not over-trade your capital. Choose short
credits to long ones, cash to credit in buying or selling, and
small profits in credit cases with little risk to better gains
with more hazard. Be clear and explicit in your bargains.
Trust nothing to memory which you can and should commit
to writing. Keep a memorandum-book in your pocket, and


27
note particulars of appointments, addresses and petty cash
matters. Keep copies of all important letters which you write
and send away, keep all papers cf consequence in proper order,
never suffer your desk to be confused by papers. Be always
at the head of your business for, ifyou leave it, be not astonished
if it leaves you. Remember that he whose credit is suspected
is not one to be trusted. Constantly examine your books &
accounts. Be heed fulofyouraffahs always living within your
income. Be cautious how you become security for any per-
son. Beg-onerous when urged by motives of humanity. Wait
not till to-morrow to do that which would be better done to-
day. Wait not on fortune -with arms folded- but seize op-
portunities as they present themselves and make the most of
them.
Inconsistency. —Man is remarkable as a Being that is sus-
ceptible of knowledge-with the facilities that surround him of
acquiring this, and the immense advantages of possessing it-
it seems strange, that be should pay so much more attention to
follies, the nature of which, the so called “ Instinct” of the
Brute Cr-eation-by estimating more truly their worth-disdain!
This only illustrates the consistency of, seeming inconsisten-
cies -where there are two ends to the balance, natural laws
demand that if one end is very high, the othershould be look-
ed for proportionately low. The Balance pictures Judgment.
The greater the capacity of the greater the work-
ing of its ends. There is no such thing as inconsistency in
Nature, throughout reigns perfected ha;mony.
Credit or Cash. —Credit tempts to extravagance. If you
buy on credit you will be induced to purchase more articles
and greater quantities than what you are really in want of.
Cash purchases save misunderstandings, trouble, time and
errors. Cash obtains greater value, and tends to secure
contentment and independence.
Experience. —Experience is dearest bought in practice and
cheapest bought in hooks. It is a knowledge essential to
prosperity —it is sought most eagerly by those who stand least
in need of it, because they have already found it in part ife
know its value in proportion as they have acquired it. It
has the singular great virtue of being better appreciated as
it is better known. It is a thing we must have, and those
who acquire most at least cost, are the richest and strongest.
The Lamp of Experience requires constant trimming-, or its


light becomes weak. Before Printing, knowledge was es-
teemed treasure and power; now, to call it such is sufficient
—else, why so slow to acquire that which is within reach ?
It requires much wisdom to know the value of what we pos-
sess and what we want!
Advice Gatis, is seldom worth more.
Composition. —lf you wish to write successfully, you must
use the natural rein, be guided by no pattern, no patron, give
no heed to paper, press or public. Simply write your own
ideas in your own way. In epistolary correspondence use
great care to avoid a slovenly style. Never omit giving
your full address on the right hand corner of your letters.
Write in as legible a hand as possible. Use as plain language
as though you were speaking, make yourself thoroughly un-
derstood. Touch upon each subject in order. Do not revert
many times to the same thing, but close each subject as you
proceed. Sign your name plain, if you wish it to be deci-
phered. Avoid crossing your letters surely paper is cheap
enough, besides cross letters, make cross readers. Use the
best pens, the best ink, and the best paper and envelopes.
Write straight. See that your paper is perfectly clean and
neatly folded. Due regard to these hints, will greatly
contribute -though you be a poor writer- to make your wri-
ing look and read better.
Charcoal. —The many valuable properties of Charcoal are
not generally known, nor are they appreciated by those who
do know them. Charcoal is a most effectual purifier and re-
storer of bad water, bad air, and will even restore tainted
Fish, Flesh or Fowl. It not only absorbs effluvia and gas-
eous bodies, but especially when in contact with atmospheric
air, it oxidizes and destroys many of the easily alterable ones,
by resolving them into the most simple combinations that they
are capable of forming, chiefly water and carbonic acid. It is
chiefly from the oxidizing property and absorbent power of
Carcoal, that it is rendered so effective as a deodorizing &
disinfecting agent. Charcoal may be easily and profitably
employed for any of the following purposes:—Water in-
tended for drinking, should be first filtered through Charcoal.
Every drain, sink or water-closet should be furnished with
Charcoal Absoibers or Purifiers, which may easily be made by
enclosing a thin layer of Charcoal between two sheets of wire-
gauze. When meat or fowl has become tainted, bury it for


a short time in Charcoal, or when fish has turned, put some
charcoal in the vessel in which you boil it, they may thus be
restored to perfect sweetness. Charcoal may also be profit-
ably used by mixing- it in garden soil. Particular caution
should however, be observed in burning Charcoal in close
compartments, occupied by any living creature, for if there be
no Chimney or proper air vent, stupor, sleep and death, will
be the certain results.
Cockroaches. —Mix one part of well bruised Plaster of Paris
with two parts of Oatmeal. Strew it about the places infest-
ed—in the chinks.
The Chimney on Fire. —The most simple and effectual
way to extinguish burning soot in a Chimney is to throw a
small quantity of powdered brimstone on the fire. The va-
pour from which, ascending the Chimney will completely
smother it. A board or cloth placed in front of the fire-place
will prevent the fumes descending into the room.
Fire Extinguisher —Dissolve in a little hot w*ater £ lb, of
Pearlash, this mixed in a bucket of common water will make
a solution capable of extinguishing instantly, any fire upon
which it is thrown.
To Destroy Ants. —Follow up their train during* the day
to discover their hillock, at evening when they have all re-
turned, pour a good stream of boiling water immediately over
the entrance. They are averse to strong scents —camphor
will prevent their infesting a cupboard. To prevent their
climbing up trees, paint a circle of tar about the trunk. A
chalk circle drawn on an even surface or floor around any
thing will effectually keep them off.
Tost and Impounded Cattle. —Lost cattle should be ad-
vertised as soon as possible in the ‘‘Government Gazette,”
the Impoundings appearing in which peruse carefully. Cat-
tle may be sold out of Pound after the owner has had seven
days notice or after being advertised in the “Gov. Gazette” as
impounded after twenty one days. Impounded Cattle can
only be sold by Auction (by the Poundkeeper) on the Ist.
or drd. W ednesday in the month, at noon after expiration of
Notices. Proceeds of Sales -less fees- go to Government and
if not claimed in two years go to Charitable Institutions. If
Cattle do not realize fees, the Impounder is liable for defici-
ency. Goats may be destroyed if found trespassing on pro-
perly enclosed lands. Half the Fines levied under the Im-
pounding Act go to the Informer and half to Government.


Dissolutions of Partnerships.—AW dissolutions of Part-
nership should lie advertised three times in a leading local
Newspaper and three times in the “Gov. Gazette.”
Corns. —Are simply caused by friction. If you want to
cure them, wear easy boots, pare them carefully and then mb
them with sweet oil every night and morning. Remove all
pressure from off them during* the day and they will soon
disappear.
Effectual Rat Exterminator. —Melt 1 lb. of Lard in a
Bottle plunged in water heated to IbO degrees Fahrenheit,
introduce half an ounce of Phosphorus and 1 pint ot Whiskey,
cork & well shake the bottle as it cools, when cold, pour off the
Whiskey,—it may be used again & again for the same pur-
pose. Spread this Poisoned Lard on bread or mixit with oat-
meal in small dough pellets, which place in or near the rat
holes. The luminous appearance of the Phosphorus attracts
them, whilst the smell and taste fascinates them into eating
it. They immediately suffer from such intense thirst, that if
the precaution be taken, of placing a little water on the floor,
the poisoned ones will come out to it, and die. ffhus pre-
venting the obnoxious and injurious smell consequent upon
their dying between floors or partitions.
Cement for Broken Glass or China. —Half an ounce of
Gum Acacia dissolved in a wine-glass of boiling water
with sufficient Platter of Paris added to form a thick paste.
This applied immediately with a brush to the parts required
will form a most effectual Cement.
Snake Bites. —Four hundred authenticated cases of cure
from the deadly bites of venomous serpents have been
ed in India by the use of Liquor Ammoniae (a solution of
Ammonia.) The Authorities are endeavouring to supply the
Natives with the medicine and instructions lor its use at a
cheap rate.
Heart-Bum. —Mix in a tumbler of water, the juice of an
orange and some sugar, to which add half a tea-spoon-full of
bicarbonate of soda. Ibis makes an agreeable effervescent
drink—cure for heart-burn.
Lemonade. —Four good ripe juicy Lemons, soften them by
rolling, peel and then slice them into two quarts of cold water
sweeten to suit taste, well stir. This makes a wholesome,
delicious and cooling summer beverage.


Ginger Beer. —Boil 12 ounces of bruised Jamaica ginger
in 4 £ gallons of water for a quarter of an hour, then strain &
add 6 lbs. Loaf Sugar 4 whites of eggs well beat, juice of 4
lemons, £ oz. Tartaric acid and 2 ozs. Cream of Tartar, the
whole mixed together & cashed up, will be ready to bottle in
three days.
Double Spruce Beer. —To Twenty gallons of luke-warm
water add one g’allou of treacle or good molasses, half pint of
essence of spruce, half a pint of yeast, 3 ozs. of bruised
Root Ginger and I oz. of Linglass "disolved in a little water.
Letit ferment in a Cask for 12 hours, ihen bung up the Cask
and set it aside for ten hours when it will be fit for use.
To Make Mine. —Procure a well cleaned Cask. Place it,
end up, with head out and a tap near the bottom. Fix a
false bottom having small holes bored in it, or a Strainer
sufficiently deep to allow space between it and the top of the
Cask to hold the grapes, which may be crushed by means of
a lever or otherwise. By this means, the juice will collect in
the bottom of the Cask. In warm weather fermentation will
commence in from 80 to 40 hours, in cool weather it may
take from 2 to 4 days, when some of the skins etc, will begin
to rise to the top and a thick crust be formed, which will rise
gradually to nearly double the original space occupied by the
juice in the vessel. This opperation is accompanied by a hiss-
ing, bubbling noise which discontinues immediately upon the
first fermentation being completed, the whole occupying from
2 to 5 daj’s from time of crushing, according as the atmosphere
may favour the process. Next, draw carefully off, all the clear
juice with which fill another cask, placed on its side with the
bung out. Fermentation wall continue moderately & further
refuse will be thrown off from the bung-hole. Keep the Cask
full & when the refuse discontinues to be thrown off the hiss-
ing sound cannot be heard, bung it up quite full. Then make
agimblethole neart he bung. Through this hole during the
next month, a gas will be emitted strong enough to blow out
a match, and when you find it too weak to do this, stop the
hole with a peg, but this must be occasionally opened. To
fine 5 Gallons of wine, if red, use the well beaten whites of
two eggs, if white, use two table spoons full of isinglass. In
a few weeks, as yonng wine, it will be fit for use. 100 lbs,
of grapes will make about 6 Gallons of wine.


Volcanic Eruptions. —Cotopoxi, in 1738, threw its fiery
rockets 3000 feet above its crater while in 1744 the blazing
mass struggling for an outlet, roared so that its awful voice
was heard a distance of more than 600 miles. In 1797 the
crater of Tunguragua, one of the great peaks of the Andes,
Hung out torrents of mud which dammed up rivers, opened
new lakes, and in valleys of 1000 feet wide made deposits of
600 feet deep. The stream from Vesuvius, which in 1737
passsed through Torre del Greco, contained 33,600,000 cubic
feet of solid matter; and in 1794, when Torre del Greco was
destroyed a second time, the mass of lava amounted to 45,000,
000 cubic feet. In 1679, Etna poured forth a hood which
covered eighty-four square miles of surface, and measured
nearly 100,000,000 cubic feet. On this occasion the sand
and scoriae formed the Monte Rossi, near Nicolisi, a cone two
miles in circumference and 4000 feet high. The stream
thrown out by Etna in 1810 was in motion at the rate of a
yard per day for nine months after the eruption; and it is on
record that the lava of the same mountain, after a terrible
eruption, was not thoroughly cooled and consolidated ten
vears after the event. In the eruption of Vesuvius, A. D., 79,
the scorife and ashes vomited forth far exceeded the entire
bulk of the mountain, while in 1660 Etna disgorged more
than 20 times its own mass. Vesuvius has thrown its ashes
as far as Constantinople, Syria and Egypt; it hurled stones
eight pounds in weight to Pompeii, a distance of six miles,
while similar masses were tossed up 2000 feet above its sum-
mit. Cotopaxi has projected a block of 109 cubic yards in
volume a distance of nine miles, and Sumbawa, in 1815,
during the most terrible emotion on record, sent its ashes as
far as Java, a distance of 300 miles of surface, and out of a
population of 12,000 souls only twenty escaped.
Good Remedies. —For Drunkenness, drink cold water—for
health, rise early — to be happy, be honest—to please all,,
mind your ow T n business.
To Preserve Flowers. —Nitrate of soda, as much as can
be held between the finger and thumb, placed in the water
in which the flowers are to be preserved, will keep them fresh
and blooming for a fortnight.

‘ Volcanic Eruptions. —Cotopoxi, in 1738, threw its fiery
rockets 3()00 feet above its crater while in 1744 the blazing
mass struggling for an outlet, roared so that its awful voice
was heard a distance of more than 600 miles. In 1797 the
crater of Tunguragua, one of the great peaks of the Andes,
fiung out torrents of mud which dammed up rivers, opened
new lakes, and in valleys of 1000 feet wide made deposits of
600 feet deep. The stream from Vesuvius, which in 1737
passsed through Torre del Greco, contained 33,600,000 cubic
feet of solid matter; and in 1794-, when Torre del Greco was
destroyed a second time, the mass of lava amounted to 45,000,
000 cubic feet. In 1679, Etna poured forth a flood which
covered eighty-four square miles of surface, and measured
nearly 100,000,000 cubic feet. On this occasion the sand
and scoriae formed the Monte Rossi, near Nicolisi, a cone two
miles in circumference and 4000 feet high. The stream
thrown out by Etna in 1810 was in motion at the rate of a
yard per day for nine months after the eruption; and it is on
record that the lava of the same mountain, after a terrible
eruption, was not thoroughly cooled and consolidated ten
years after the event. In the eruption of Vesuvius, A. D., 79,
the scorhe and ashes vomited forth far exceeded the entire
bulk of the mountain, while in 1660 Etna disgorged more
than 20 times its own mass. Vesuvius has thrown its ashes
as far as Constantinople, Syria and Egypt; it hurled stones
eight pounds in weight to Pompeii, a distance of six miles,
while similar mosses were tossed up 2000 feet above its sum-
mit. Cotopaxi has projected a block of 109 cubic yards in
volume a distance of nine miles, and Sumbawa, in 1815,
during the most terrible eruption on record, sent its ashes as
far as Java, a distance of 300 miles of surface, and out of a
population of 12,000 souls only twenty escaped.
Good Remedies. —For Drunkenness, drink cold water —for
health, rise early— to be happy, be honest—to please all,,
mind your own business.
To Preserve Flowers. —Nitrate of soda, as much as can
be held between the finger and thumb, placed in the water
in which the flowers are to be preserved, will keep them fresh
and blooming for a fortnight.

As every inhabitant of the Colony, may at some time or other, be interested
in knowing the p- ecis • time of some Birth or Death and as a complete system
of R-gistration will prevent much litigation in future years and otherwise pro-
t ct individual rights of property, besides throwing light on many social ques-

increase of Statistical Science a' d the general advantage of the lull 'blt*nts of

It must be remembered that a very large quantity of Gold—the
yield of this district —does not appear in the above returns, but on the
contrary, has been included in Official returns as from Ballaarat and
other Gold Fields. 'I ho difference in value between the gold of dif-
ferent districts leaves room for fraudulent traffic, indeed at one time
—this was so fully developed and its effects so heavily felt that large
buyers adopted the safer means of ascertaining its fineness previous to
purchase—even at this time, Gold is purchased without this precaution
and largo profits are made by persons selling Castlmaine Gold in other
districts.
