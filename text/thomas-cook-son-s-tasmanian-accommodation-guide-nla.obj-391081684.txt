HOBART AND ITS ENVIRONS.
T77HETHER viewed from the sea approach or land, the City of
Hobart, situated on the broad estuary of the Derwent, pre-
sents an attractive picture during the summer season. There are
coaches and brakes running daily to the Fern Tree Bower and
Brown’s River (Kingston), daily coaches to the Huon, steamer
excursions to New Norfolk, Bridgewater, South Arm, and Brown’s
River, periodical trips in the ocean-going steamers to Port Arthur,
Port Cygnet, and the Huon, coastal steamers plying between
Hobart and Tasman Peninsula, and the Channel Ports and Huon ;
cheap excursions by rail along the Derwent Valley and Sorell
lines, or inland by the Main and Fingal Lines.
| iThe legal scale of Cab Fares is very reasonable, and every cab-
driver must produce on demand, a printed card of the Cab Fare
Regulations. By distance, the fares for the whole cab are Any
distance under one mile, 1/-; for each successive | mile, 6d. up
to five miles. By time, the fares for the whole cab are :—2/- for
any time under half an hour ; 3/6 up to one hour, and so on.
The cars on the three lines of the Electric Tramways commence
running at 7 a.m., and between 8 am. and 11 p.m., the running
is every fifteen minutes upon the New Town line, and every twenty
minutes upon the Cascades and Sandy Bay lines. The fares are :
—2d. to the City boundary, and 3d. beyond ; Children under ten
years, half fares.
LATINOESTON AND ITS STJEP.OTJNDXNGS.
JJIHE City of Launceston is the nearest starting point for such
localities as the Mount Bischoff Tin Mine, the Heaconsfield or
Lefroy Gold Mines, the North West Coast, the Chudleigh and
Mole Creek Limestone Caves, the Great Lake, via Deloraine, the
famous St. Mary’s Pass, the fishing and shooting attractions of
the Scamander, George’s Bay, the fern and forest scenery of the
Denison Gorge, and other points of interest.
The driver of every licensed cab must exhibit a Table of Fares,
and is liable to a fine of £2 for demanding a fare larger than that
shown on the card. The legal fares are very moderate, being, for
one passenger, under | a mile, 6d.; for two or more, 1/- ; above
a mile, and not_ exceeding one mile, for the whole cab, 1/-, and 6d.
for every additional 5 mile, not exceeding 5 miles. By time the
fares are 1/6 for and under half a hour, and 3/- for the first hour.
The “ Lion ” of Launceston is the Cataract Gorge, leading to
the First Basin, on the South Esk River. Prince’s Square con-
tains the handsomest Bronze Fountain in Australia, and the City
Park the nucleus of a Zoological Collection. Amongst the popular
excursion round Launceston are drives to Corra Linn (7 miles),
Rosevears (12 miles), and the Electric Light Generating Station
(about 5 miles), and through the Agricultural Districts of Longford,
Evandale, etc.


TASMANIAN TOURS.
<§\J9)((S)\3
ITIHE following are examples of our Summer Tours in Tasmania,
1 full lists and details of which can be obtained from our
principal offices. In all tours exceeding one day the fare quoted
includes hotel accommodation as well as transport, and in the
majority of cases the tour can be extended at pleasure, on pay-
ment of the extra hotel accommodation. Portions of these tours,
or deviations from the advertised tour, can be arranged if so
desired.
It must be distinctly understood that all quotations for our
advertised Tasmanian Tours are subject to any alterations that
have occurred since the date of publication through changes of
proprietorship in hotels, or of routes and fares in steamer or
coach services.
Travellers holding through railway tickets (issued in con-
junction with steamer tickets) between Hobart and Launceston,
or vice versa , can utilise them for the rail portion of tours to the
Lakes or East Coast, by having them endorsed at our Hobart or
Launceston agencies for the necessary break of journey. This
affords facilities for visiting the Lakes District, the East Coast,
etc. Heavy baggage may be sent forward to the cloak-room at
either the Launceston or Hobart Railway Stations, where it is
safely stored at a very small fee per day, which can be learnt
from the “ Railway Pocket Time Table/’ obtainable at our
principal offices and the Railway Stations.
