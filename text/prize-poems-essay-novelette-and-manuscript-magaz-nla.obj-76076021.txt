PREFACE.
The First Literary Competition that was held in Melbourne in
connection with the Australian Natives? National Fete was on the
26th January, 1891, on the occasion of the Annual Demonstration
held in the Exhibition Building. The competition then consisted of
an essay on ?Australia?s Future,? open to all residents of Australia ;
an essay on ?Outdoor Sports, and their Relation to a Nation?s
Progress,? open to all residents of Australia under 21 years of age;
and a National Ode, to be competed for by those born in Australia
only. The prize contributions resulting from those competitions
were not circulated in pamphlet form, owing to the necessary
arrangements not having been made in time. In 1892 no Literary
Competition was held. The Committee of 1893 appointed to carry
out the demonstration determined upon having all the prize
contributions issued in the present form for circulation amongst the
public, as it was of opinion that by doing so a certain justifiable
prominence would be given to the successful competitors, and such
an act would Ire likely to create a greater interest in any future
attempts that might be made by it to foster a taste for literature.


SENIOR POEM.
?Eucalyptus? (J. Neilson, IMhill).
Zb e pioneers.
The shadows fall on the woodland, the bleating flocks arc
shorn ;
The young moon?s silver sickle shines o?er fields of rip?ning
corn.
The orchards bend. The clust?ring grapes are hanging on
the vine ;
The harvest blessings fill the land with corn, and oil, and
wine.
The Summer-mist floats on the hills ; the days of peace
are here ;
The mountains wear their floral crown in the evening of
the vear.
But where are the men of the early years who hewed the
forest down ?
Whose ploughshares turned the virgin soil, and drew the
furrows brown.
The stout of heart, the strong of hand, who planted the
infant states ;
Who led in the path of the nations, who opened wide the
gates ;
Who led to the distant regions o?er many an inland plain ;
Who trod in the van of the legions that march in Labour?s
train ;
Who kept their flocks, and gathered in.the harvest of the
shears ;
Our sunbronzed, wayworn, manly men?Australia?s Pioneers.
They?ve traced the course of the rivers, they?ve scaled the
mountain chain :
They?ve borne the desert?s burning thirst, hunger, and toil,
and pain :


They?ve trodden the path of peril, taken their lives in their
hands,
To bring us back from that weary track the tale of the
central lands.
Did all return who left us ? We bade them all God-speed,
When they marched north to follow the path their dauntless
leaders? lead.
The long months lengthen into years, and ling?ring hope
is fled,
Let Fame unroll her golden scroll and tell of the honored
dead.
They died in the whirling sand-blast, they sank in the
sultry noon,
Some struggled on with weary feet to the bed of the dry
lagoon.
And none may tell where Leichardt rests, or where his
men repose,
They fell, like Franklin?s gallant crews upon the Arctic
snows.
The gallant Burke has perished with none to spread the
pall,
Where luminous stars of the desert shine and starbeams
softly fall.
And Gordon tells in stirring verse how the ev?ning sun
sank low
When the death mist fell on the brave man?s eyes, ?Gone
where we all must go.?
On Austral?s central mountain Stuart halts his faithful
band,
And rears the flag, whose silken folds have kissed the
yellow sand.
The desert blast has fanned it, the desert sun looks down.
It floats on high?our country?s flag, in the crest of the
mountain brown ;
But the dauntless spirit?s passed away, the noble heart is
still ;
His toils are o?er, who raised the flag upon the central hill.


Though desert-dust has pillowed each noble head to rest;
And faithful hearts have turned to dust within each gallant
breast,
They?ll rise again from the arid waste, in the light that
shall be given,
When glory falls on the jewelled walls, and battlements of
Heaven
When sorrow and sighing shall flee away,? and shadows
all grow dim,
They?ll walk in the light of the perfect day, and see the
face of Him
Who drank the bitter cup, that we might drink of the
healing wave.
Who trod the burning sands, that we might walk the
golden pave.
When Heaven?s last trumpet thrills the earth, and sounds
the knell of the years
O?er desert plain and mountain chain, twill ?waken the
Pioneers.
NOVELETTE.
?Thisbe? (Miss B. B. Cole, Geelong).
v i v
�nip a IRustic /Ifeato.
GUESS I am sorter shy!? the girl said with a rippling
laugh. The strange grafting of New England speech on
Australian scenery struck her companion forcibly.
These two ?a young man and a maiden ?were seated on the
bank of .a river in the North-Western District. All around
was solitude, steeped in the drowsy languor of a summer
afternoon.
Locusts chirruped gladly, revelling in the glorious sun-
shine ; some frogs near added their deep bass to the concert,
and numberless birds of varied plumage flew hither and
thither through eucalyptus and ti-tree, contributing occasional
ecstatic trills and twitterings of short duration. Through the


arching river-trees was visible a sloping vista of vineyards,
where hung already great bunches of grapes, purple and
yellow, awaiting the vintage.
Doubtless it was pleasant to the young man, city-worn and
over-worked, to 1 urge under the shady trees, talking to a
pretty girl?though she was only the daughter of the old
vigneron with whom he was boarding.
Cecil Rattray had just succeeded in passing his final law
examination, and had a brilliant future before him. But his
health had suddenly given way, and by the doctor?s advice
he had come to spend a few weeks on this vineyard farm,
where occasional ? summer boarders ? were received. As he
lounged he could see the clear-cut profile of his companion.
It was a lovely profile, he saw, and the girl?s full face was
perhaps more charming, especially when she laughed. A
pink sun-bonnet, tilted slightly forward, cast a becoming
glow on her pale skin innocent of freckle or sunburn. Little
rings of bright brown hair had escaped from the coil at the
back of her head, and lay in tiny, clinging curls on her broad
forehead. Looking at her thus, one might have deemed her
some city belle masquerading in rustic dress.
The speech to which she had just given utterance was in
answer to Rattray?s suggestion, that he supposed she had been
too shy to attend the nearest school. He had ascertained
that her education had not been acquired at Miss Holmes?
? Academy for Young Ladies ? in the adjacent country town ;
and inwardly he regretted it. For surely, he thought, with
her innate refinement, she could have been made quite a lady
if sent to even a moderately good boarding-school. As far
as that went she was a lady, except for that troublesome
vernacular in which she sometimes talked. With this idea
uppermost in his mind, he next spoke : ? Is your father from
America ? ?


?My father ! Oh, yes ; of course, and Mamsey too ?
why ? ?
? I wonder,? he said, gazing into the clear, grey eyes,
? would you be very vexed if I told you why ? ?
? Try,? she said, laconically.
? Well, because I thought from your way of speaking ?a
sort of accent ?that you were American. Do you know,? he
continued musingly, ? what I thought when I first saw you
? No,? she said.
? That you were a young lady come to board here, like
myself, and I felt half tempted to run aw r ay, for I had
expressly advertised for a place where there were no other
boarders. When a fellow goes away for a complete change,
he does not care to have to make himself agreeable to a
young lady. There?s enough of that sort of thing in town,
by Jove ! ?
As he complacently twirled his dark moustache, Cecil
Rattray smiled, perhaps at the vista of fair damsels awaiting
him in town, for he was a ?? good match ? ?that is, he had a
private income, good prospects, and belonged to one of the
best (and most exclusive) families in Melbourne. All his
people ?father, mother and two sisters?were consumed b}? a
daily dread that Cecil would ?make an unsuitable marriage.?
Cecil himself had no fears on that subject. He was an
eminently cool-headed young man, who prided himself on
never being carried away by his feelings. Many fellows, he
told himself, in his position would have been unable to resist
falling in love with this charming girl beside him, or at least
getting up a flirtation, if she would permit it. Yet here was
he, Cecil Rattray, deliberately seeking her companionship,
and enjoying the piquant freshness of her society without a
tear, secure in his own determination never to make a fool of
himself. And yet a hundred times a day he told himself


abstractedly?it was a pity! Each day he said it more
fervently.
?It was a pity ! ? What was a pity ? Well, briefly, that
this girl of varying moods (which, however, seemed always
to harmonize with his own), this girl who passed so readily
from grave to gay, was one day silent and pensive, and the
next full of merry ?whimsies,? who pleased in everry way but
one his fastidious fancy, should, as far as birth went, be so far
beneath what was ? possible ? for his future wife. For
Rattray did not deny to himself that, had that one thing
been different, she was the very sort of girl whom he could
have loved. But her ? speech bewrayed ? her ?it was out
of the question, impossible. And, having come to this con-
clusion, he somewhat illogically determined to enjoy her
society for the present, never troubling to think whether her
peace of mind was in danger.
Now, as he sat complacently reviewing the many girls who
seemed pleased at his languid attentions, his smile faded, and
died away at an irrepressible roulade of laughter, which
issued from his companion?s rosy lips. For one moment he
looked doubtfully at her ?could she be laughing at him f
But even as he looked the laughter vanished, and a wistful
puzzled expression took its place.
? I s?pose a girl like me don?t count ; ? she said slowly.
?My dear Acacia ! (you said I might call you so) it is not
easy to explain to you. Society girls are so ?so ?exigeantes ;
oh, you will hardly understand what that means?well, they
expect a fellow to be always hanging round, ready to walk
and talk with them, and generally amuse them.?
?And 7,? said Acacia, ?7 don't! There an?t anythin? of
that ?bout me ;is there now ? 7 don?t expect you to be
always round ready to walk and talk but you are often, and
ypu generally amuse me some"


Again a spasm of doubt as to whether he was being laughe
at crossed the young man?s mind ; but a look at the earnest
simplicity of her face dispelled it?? Oh, you ? ?he began, and
then paused. It would never do to let this unsophisticated
maiden see how much she pleased him. ?You see,? he
explained lamely, ?girls in town are quite different. From
the time they ? come out ? they spend their lives in a round of
afternoon teas, tennis parties, dinners and balls, till at last
they care for nothing but excitement. A girl after her first
?or at most her second ?season in town is quite spoilt.?
Acacia gave vent to a prolonged ? O?h ! ? But when
Rattray asked the reason of her ejaculation, she only pointed
to a red spot on one shapely white hand, and said?? Those
mosquitos is real bad just here ; reckon we?ll get eaten up
soon.? And while Rattray was debating whether he might
dare to kiss the pretty, wounded hand so temptingly near,
Acacia rose suddenly.
? I?m goin? right in now,? she said, ? Mamsey?ll be waitin?
on me for tea.?
As she spoke a voice from the farm-house near echoed
through the still summer air, and the figure of Mrs. Lang,
the farmer?s wife, appeared ?? Missy! come ?long in to yer
tea, ?fore it spiles.?
Cecil also rose lazily, asking?? May I have a cup of tea
this afternoon, too ? ? Acacia laughed, ? seems to me you
have on e most afternoons,? she said, ? Come ?long.?
The house was an ordinary Australian farm-house. Around
three sides ran a wide tiled verandah, with long blinds
screening it from the heat of the sun. In the coolest corner
of this ?summer-parlour? stood a table on which was set a
dainty tea tray. Mrs. Lang in her afternoon gown was already
there ; but it was Acacia who presided.


Mrs. Lang was a plain, homely-looking woman of about
fifty, in whom Rattray could trace no resemblance to Acacia.
She must be like her father, he concluded. Mr. Lang he had
never yet seen, as an accident sustained at harvest time had
kept him helpless in the hospital ever since. Acacia had no
brothers or sisters, and it was plain to Rattray that she was
the idol of the household. Everything and everyone in it
was evidently at the service of ? Missy,? as she was called (some
pet name surviving from childhood he supposed). And she
took this devotion as quite her due. Of her father she spoke
with reserve, except at times, when a word or two let fall
would reveal the fact that to her he was the chief person in
the universe. The next day was wet. There had been a
thunderstorm in the night and it was succeeded by heavy
rain showers, which made the prospect out-of-doors unin-
viting. Rattray drummed impatiently on the window-panes,
and wondered vaguely what he should do. It was the first
really wet day since his arrival. Happy thought ! There was
a piano in the front sitting-room. He would go and while
away the time by strumming a little.
He found Acacia already there comfortably ensconced in an
easy-chair. Though the day was not cold, there was a
diminutive fire on the hearth, rather for its cheerful appear-
ance than its warmth. Acacia held a book in her hand, but
was musing rather than reading.
In reply to Rattray?s question?did she play?she admitted
to knowing a little music ; but refused to exhibit her talent.
So Rattray took his place at the piano, and played and sang
for an hour or so?suddenly a thought struck him ??? Perhaps
you sing ! ? he exclaimed, turning to her.
? Mebbe Ido sing some ,? she said with a mischievous smile.
Rattray saw the smile and concluded that the girl had a good
voice, and was aware of it. ? Will you sing to me ?? he


asked eagerly ; and she assented. She chose the sweet old
ballad, ? Robin Adair,? and Rattray listened entranced. He
almost forgot to play the accompaniment in the delight of
hearing the voice of rare sweetness which filled the room with
melody. ?Do you know what a magnificent voice you
have ?? he asked. ?It would make your fortune on the
stage ! ? A crimson flush broke over the girl?s face, then
passed away, and she laughed. ? Tell my father that,? she
said with an amused look ; and the subject dropped. But
Acacia would not again sing to him.
The time wore on till the third week of Rattray?s stay was
almost over. For a ? cool-headed ? young man it was
wonderful how he paced up and down in the moonlight, or
tossed wakefully in bed thinking of this girl, who was so
? impossible ? as a wife for him. No! it would never
do ! he told himself repeatedly, as he rowed up and down the
river with Acacia steering, or walked with her between the
purple and gold-decked vines.
Then came a day ?the last but one before his return to
town ?when this assertion was followed by a modifying word.
?Unless,? he said to himself, ?she could be sent to school
somewhere for a while.? Then she would be cured' of the
frequent lapses into that American vernacular, which, though
natural enough in Mrs. Lang, seemed so incongruous in
Acacia. But how should he broach the subject without
offending her ? She was well read as far as the ordinary
reading of the day went, and probably considered herself quite
sufficiently educated. It was marvellous to him that she had
not learnt to speak correctly from the books she had read.
Yet ?now he thought of it?she sometimes spoke English as
pure as his own. Suddenly a probable solution occurred to
him. To please the old people she might speak as they did.
Diffidently, and after much ? leading up to the question,?


he asked was this so, and was rewarded by the ambiguous
reply, delivered in an ultra-American tone, ? Mebbe ! ? and
another of her enigmatical laughs.
The last day was one of dazzling sunshine, with the faintest
suggestion of a southerly breeze.
Acacia, of her own free will, had proposed an expedition up
the river to some falls, about three miles away. They would
have time, she said, to go there, get some ferns, and return
before the hottest part of the day.
While Rattray stood on the verandah, smoking his morning
cigar, he unintentionally overheard a dialogue which puzzled
him considerably.
The first speaker was Mrs. Lang, ? Oh, missy, dear,? she
said, ?I ?most wish you?d never begun this foolin?. Laud sakes !
the master?d never forgive me if?? But Acacia?s merry
laugh broke like sunshine upon these gloomy forebodings.
??Now, Mamsey ! ? she cried gaily, ?don?t begin to be
disobedient at your age ! You promised me I should do as
I liked.?
?Well ! I dunno?,? said the other doubtfully. ?Anyway,
he?s going away right to-morrow, so I s?pose no harm?s done.?
Then they moved out of the room, leaving Rattray
mystified and wondering who was ?the master!? His
jealous fancy began to picture some local squatter, who loved
Acacia, and considered her already accountable to him for
her actions.
The row up the river was a silent one ; then the ferns were
gathered with scarcely a word spoken, and the journey home
began. Rattray let the boat glide gently down-stream, while
Acacia flicked idly at the water with a long fern frond in a
pensive mood. It was then that Rattray took heart of grace
to propound his scheme. Inwardly he rebelled at fate for
thrusting him into the r6le of mentor.


? Acacia,? he said gently, ? will you promise not to be angry
with me for what I am going to say ??
? Yes,? she said.
?It may vex youhe continued blunderingly, ? but you
must believe it is only my interest in you, my liking?and
affection that prompt me to speak.?
? Affection ! ? she said scornfully, ?after knowin? me four
weeks.?
? Yes,? he said firmly, ?affection?and something more than
affection, but I will speak more of that by-and-bye no,? he
exclaimed hotly, ? I will not defer it. I will tell you the
whole truth. I love you ! I have never cared for any other
girl; but ?how can I tell you without wounding you and
making you hate me ? To me you are perfect, but ?well,
the fact is my people ?now don?t be hurt, dearest ! they are
such?such infernal snobs,? he cried with an irrepressible
burst of anger, ?that they might think, just because you
sometimes (only sometimes, mind) talk in a way different
from themselves ; but I think you are the best and sweete t
girl in the world, and however you were to speak I could
never love you more or less. Do you think you could care
for me ? and you might have lessons?a governess, you know,
or something of that sort,? he broke off lamely.
? Do you mean that you love me, but you couldn?t marry
me unless I learned to speak differently ? ? she asked quietly,
and there was no anger at all, but only an icy coldness and
deliberation (though her face was flushed) which seemed to
Rattray worse.
? No, no !? he answered eagerly, a great passion-wave
impelling him, regardless of his formal plans, ? I would never
think that an obstacle. Have I not said that to me you are
perfect ? I want nothing altered ? (and at that moment at
least it was true).


?But you would not he satisfied with me. No,? she said,
as he broke into passionate asseverances, ? you are carried
away now by your feelings ; but you would not really be
happy with a wife whom people despised for her humble
birth. And remember you have never even seen my
father.?
? No,? he said bravely ; ? but whatever your father may be
he can make no difference to me. When a man marries it
is his wife he thinks of, not her relatives.?
? But,? she said, as the boat touched the river side,? I am
afraid that whoever takes me must take my father too ; ? and
she laughed musically, as if amused at some secret thought.
She sprang lightly to the bank.
?But, Acacia,? exclaimed Rattray, ?you have never given
me an answer. Do you care for me at all ??
In his excitement he seized her hand and held it in his
own.
?Yes,? she said simply, with a rosy flush on her face, and
he saw that her lovely eyes were bright with unshed tears.
?Yes ; I think I do ?some ; but we must both have time to
think it over, especially you must think whether you could
really venture to marry a girl so much beneath you.?
To Rattray?s surprise she followed this speech by a
tremulous laugh, with a suggestion of tears in it, and also?
was it a faint trace of mockery ?
?When will you give me your answer ?? he asked gravely,
and Acacia paused, with downcast eyes, to consider.
? When you return to Melbourne,? she said. ? I shall be
there with my father in a week?s time, and I shall answer
you then.?
? By letter ?? he asked eagerly, resolving to make sure that
she knew his address.


? Perhaps !? she said.
? And when ? ?
? The day of the great ball you were telling me about.?
u Why not till that day,? he queried impatiently ; but she
would only laugh teasingly.
Earlymext morning Rattray departed, without having been
able to win from Acacia any more definite promise.
It was the night- of Madame Lemaurier?s ball.
Madame was a sprightly Frenchwoman, who was at that
time a leader of fashion in Melbourne. Her entertainments
always ? went off? well, and were besides eminently select.
To-night, Madame had promised her friends that they
should meet for the first time a debutante , who was a great
favorite of hers.
<l Such a dear girl,? she explained volubly to Cecil Rattray,
who was also one of her pets ! ? I knew her in Paris, when
she was at school, and afterwards at London, where, by the
way, she came out two years ago, so she is only a debutante
as far as Melbourne is concerned ; but, Oh ! so sweet! so fresh !
and the manners of a veritable ingenue , cried Madame
rapturously, ? you will most certainly fall in love with her ! ?
Cecil shook his head. He felt troubled and ill-used. This
was the day Acacia had promised him her answer, but she had
sent him- no word or sign. She had not kept her promise !
Perhaps the thought of this troubled him almost more than
his disappointment.
He had failed to find anything in town to compensate for
the loss of her presence, and had solaced himself by writing
numerous letters to her. Now, it was hopeless ! This ball,
too, was a dreary affair. He wondered vaguely how he could
ever have cared for balls ?still, if she were here, it might be


different. He could almost have smiled to think how
powerless was Madame Lemaurier?s ?so sweet ! so fresh ! ?
debutante to entrance him, remembering so vividly the
sweetest and most charming girl in the world.
Society spoiled girls, he told himself. It is impossible to
tell what wild fancies floated through his brain of leading
with Acacia an idyllic existence. ? The world forgetting, by
the world forgot.? Then he looked towards where Madame
was welcoming enthusiastically some new new arrivals.
?Ah ! my most sweet Acacia ! ? she cried in her pretty
foreign way.? ?Is is you at last? I was desolated, I assure
you, thinking you were not coming, and the dear Colonel, too.?
None of them noticed a young man pale and distraught,
who was staring with the wild, incredulous eyes of a ghost-seer
at this group. Was it indeed Acacia ? His brain reeled ; but
some faint remnant of consciousness returned to him when
Madame Lemaurier, swiftly beckoning to him, and whispering
?You are the first,? introduced him to ? Miss Acacia Temple
and Colonel Temple.? It was not till Acacia?s hand rested
on his arm, and her beautiful eyes full of concern were turned
to his, that he recovered his senses.
? Was it such a shock ?? she asked remorsefully. ? Come !?
he said in reply, ?Let us go into the conservatory, and you
can explain it all ?I don?t seem able to understand.? In a
very few words it was told. Acacia and her father had just
returned from Europe, where she had been educated. It was
true that they had lived in New England for some years.
The Colonel had gone there soon after Acacia?s birth with
his wife and child ; but Mrs. Temple had died soon, and the
Colonel had then returned to Australia.
?And who is Mrs. Lang ?? asked Rattray.
? She was my nurse till father took me to Paris to school.
Then she married Mr. Lang. She was most devoted to me,
and I always called her ? Mamsey.? When I arrived in


Melbourne the heat knocked me up a little, and father sent
me to the farm for a while to grow strong again before enter-
ing Melbourne Society. Mrs. Lang was going to write and
tell you when you answered her advertisement that she had
already a young lady there ; but I begged her not to do so,
and to allow me to pass as her daughter instead. You see, I
was anxious that she should not lose a chance of letting her
rooms.?
When his curiosity was satisfied, Rattray pressed for her
promised answer. , ?You have only about two hours to
decide,? he said smiling. ?It is nearly ten now and you
promised it should be to-day .?
? But haven?t you changed your mind ? ? asked Acacia
archly, ? now that you know I am a 1 society girl,? and am
? spoilt ? by two seasons in town ? ?
Cecil?s reply to this was so foolish that Acacia begged him
to take her back to the ballroom. It was vain to demur.
? Society,? she said, ? was not so tolerant as Mrs. Lang, and
people would wonder if she did not soon reappear,?
At that moment Madame Lemaurier and Colonel Temple
appeared at the conservatory door.
?There she is, dear Colonel!? cried Madame excitedly.
Then, as an unmistakable something in the faces of both
caught her attention, she exclaimed ?? Why ! 1 believe you
two are old friends ! ?
It was Colonel Temple who was left to explain that this
was the case, for Cecil and Acacia hastily passed into the
ballroom.
As the older couple followed them, Madame Lemaurier
nodded her head sagaciously. ? Ah, my dear friend ! ? she
said, playfully tapping the Colonel with her fan, ? I foresee
that I shall soon have the pleasure of assisting the sweet child
to select her trousseau.?
And Madame?s prophecy was correct.


SENIOR POEM ON ANY SUBJECT.
By ?Tam O?Shanter? (T. C. Milne, Camberwell).
j^arn.
(Dedicated to the Amalgamated Miners * Association.)
? So you?d like to go down the shaft, you say,?
Said a miner old to a youth one day,
Who was visiting Bendigo.
? Well, you?d spoil them clothes if you went like that
Put this ? oiler ? on, and sou?-wester hat,
For 'tis wet there down below.?
w Now stand well into the cage, my lad,
But don?t be skeered though you may feel bad ?
(As he spoke the old man laughed).
Then a candle lit as he took his place,
? All right now, Jim,? to the man on the brace,
And the cage shot down the shaft.
Down, down till it stopped at a chamber dim,
The walls were rugged, and wet, and grim
As the cave of a mountain sprite.
Then they traversed many a winding drive ;
Oh ! that men need toil where no man may thrive
In that dreary, endless night.
While they win from the earth the hoarded gold,
She has treasured long, like a miser old,
Deep down in that living tomb,
A thousand feet from the light of day,
Where the flickering candle?s feeble ray
Scarce pierces the Stygian gloom.


Out from crack and crevice the water fell,
?Till its flood poured into the distant well,
And vile fumes loaded the air.

Well, there?s risk enough,? the old man replied,
? Perhaps more than there be elsewhere.?

Of the dangers that fill the miner?s life,
Worse than soldiers meet in the battle?s strife,

None but God himself could foretell his fate,
As that lad went down for to save his mate
From the very brink o? hell.
It happened just over at Eaglehawk,
You can see the chap, if you card to walk,
Who did what I?m goin? to tell.
Well, he worked in the old Virginny claim?
There was him an his mate, Sam Bray by name
?Twas down ?bout eight hundred feet ;

High up on the list of our heroes,
Whose deeds fill the roll of fame,
With those who wear star and cross, I?d place
This dauntless young miner?s name.

Of one who braved death at Duty?s call,
When he might have shrunk from fear.

May be done by the humblest men,
Though they ne?er carry arms more warlike

ESSAY.
-?Bendigo? (M. A Brennan, North Carlton).
Culture.
IN the discussion of any given subject we are liable to be
beset by difficulties of two very different kinds. The
matter may be one which has been but little investigated,
in which but slight assistance can be derived from the
industry of previous laborers in the same field. Under such
circumstances the enquirer is forced to rely on his own powers
of investigation, and to pick his steps with extreme care. On
the other hand the subject may be one which has been
illuminated by the researches of able enquirers, and upon
which it seems something like presumption for men of feebler


powers to intrude. The difficulties which we are likely to
encounter in the present discussion belong much more to the
latter than to the former class. The subject of culture has
been lucidly treated by some of the brightest of modern
thinkers and writers. Matthew Arnold, in particular, has
elaborated it in considerable detail in that polished style of
which he is the master, and one of the chief aims of the
literary labors of Ruskin and Emerson is to inculcate the
necessity of a proper recognition of the functions of culture
in all the branches of human development.
The doctrine, too, has not been entirely without its
advocates at this end of the world, for one of the most dis-
tinguished of the scholars who adorn our University has
devoted a modest little volume of essays ?some of which were
first delivered before the members of our own Association ?
to the discussion of the same theme.
The knowledge of these facts must necessarily create a
certain amount of diffidence in entering upon a discussion of
the subject of culture, for if one can only repeat what has
been much better said before, it would be preferable to
remain silent. We might, indeed, be deterred altogether by
these considerations from entering upon this discussion, did
we not reflect that the subject, being one which professes to
deal with the principles of human development in all its
phases, is necessarily capable of being viewed in an almost
unlimited variety of aspects. Though we cannot hope to
emulate the talents of some of those who have preceded us,
we may, perhaps, be able to discern some facts which they
have left unnoticed. Some, also, we may be able to look at
from a somewhat different standpoint. The search light of
their keener intellects has doubtless penetrated further than
we can expect to do ; yet, wfith our modest lantern, we may
hope to throw a few rays of light into some nooks and


crannies which they have left uninvestigated. The first
enterprising navigator steers his course boldly from headland
to headland, mapping out in rough outline the newly dis-
covered land ; but after him must come the surveyor and the
draftsman to mark the rocks and shallows, and generally to
fill in the figure which has been sketched.
What then do we mean when we speak of culture ? We
cannot, perhaps, hope for any very precise definition of the
term, but it is necessary to have a tolerably clear conception
of the scope of our subject before entering upon a discussion
of it. It is the more necessary to have such a conception,
because the views which have been entertained as to the
meaning of the term exhibit a remarkable divergence, and
possibly, to some extent, account for the wide variations of
opinion which have been expressed as to the value of the
thing itself.
Mr. John Bright speaks of culture as ? a smattering of the
two dead languages of Greek and Latin,? and Mr. Frederic
Harrison says that it is ? a desirable quality in a critic of new
books * * * but as applied to politics it simply means a
turn for small faultfinding, a love of selfish ease and indecision
in action ; ? and starting with this definition of the term they
are easily able to prove that the pursuit of culture is an object
unworthy of engaging the attention of men of broad minds
and liberal instincts. But the fact that men of broad minds
and liberal instincts have regarded the subject of culture as a
worthy?in fact the worthiest?subject of attention should be
quite sufficient to convince us that they do not regard these
definitions as just or adequate. To the criticisms of Mr. Bright
and Mr. Harrison, they simply reply that that is not what
they mean by culture. And it is only fair that the
advocates of the doctrine should be allowed the privilege of
defining what their doctrine is.


In what light then do its friends regard it ? Matthew
Arnold says of culture that ?it has its origin in the love of
perfection :it is the study of perfection. It moves by the
force, not merely or primarily of the scientific passion for
pure knowledge, but also of the moral and social passion for
doing good ; ? and perfection, he tells us, ? is the harmonious
expansion of all the powers which make the beauty and the
worth of human nature, and is not consistent with the over-
development of any one power at the expense of the rest.?'
Professor Tucker says that ?a man is cultured in the true
sense when his best intellectual and moral faculties have been
brought out and exercised. Ideas in ample range must be
familiar to him * * * associated with the philosophic
spirit and the philosophic method.? Clearly here something
much wider is contemplated than a knowledge of the two
dead languages of Greek and Latin, or an acquirement which
is merely a desirable quality in a crictic of new books.
Now when we conceive of culture, as represented by the
somewhat harsh and narrow definitions of Mr. Bright and
Mr. Harrison, we cannot well deny that their criticisms of the
doctrine are to some extent deserved. On the other hand
taking the broad and liberal definition for which its advocates
contend, we must admit that its aspirations are generous and
noble. But the question remains whether it contains any-
thing more than a series of self-evident propositions as to
conduct and duty, which, though doubtless excellent in them-
selves, are devoid of any suggestions of practical value to
humanity. Are its aims capable of realisation; or, if incapable
cf realisation, are they still worthy of being kept before us
as a guiding star ?as an ideal principle, which, though in itself
unattainable, is nevertheless capable of leading us on to
attainments of the highest importance ? In short, is this
doctrine of the functions of culture a practical doctrine ? Has
it anything to suggest to us that will help us to a solution of


those difficult problems with which mankind is constantly
beset ?problems which seem to become more difficult of
solution at each advance of this complex organisation of
human beings which we call civilisation ?
Now, according to the doctrine of its advocates, it is
capable, when rightly understood, of rendering to humanity
services such as these. Matthew Arnold appears to conceive
of it as a powerful regulative force, impelling us to devote our
energies to the worthiest objects, and restraining us from
putting our ideas into action until we have satisfied ourselves
that the result of our action will be to effect an improvement
in the existing order of things. According to this view it is' of
more importance that we should think than that we should act.
It were better that we should refrain from acting altogether
than that our actions should be imprudent and our energies
misdirected. If we cannot be certain that the action we
contemplate is wise, we must examine further into the matter.
We must seek more light, and, until we have convinced our-
selves that we are upon the right path, we must stay our
steps and endeavour to obtain a clearer conception of the
requirements of our position.
The necessity of constant self-examination and introspection
may be readily admitted. There is little doubt that the world
rarely gets as much out of a man as he is capable of achieving.
Men are too much under the sway of petty conventionalities,
and allow themselves to be too much influenced by circum-
stances. The tendency of mankind is to drift with the current of
events instead of striking out an independent course as the result
of inward conviction. The reason of this is no doubt to some
extent to be found in the fact that the forces tending to draw
us towards conventionality are constantly in operation, whilst
those which make for originality require the exercise of
considerable resolution, and are consequently apt to be


intermittent in their action. As soon as the inward force on
which they depend is withdrawn we tend to drift towards
conventionality, to drop back into the old currents and float
with the stream.
Now the tendency of culture is to weaken those forces
which draw us towards conventionality and to strengthen
those which make for originality and the independent
exercise of our best faculties. It has this tendency because
every advance which we make towards culture tends to
exhibit to us the pettiness of those motives by which, under
ordinary circumstances, the course of human affairs is guided.
It removes us as it where from the influence of those forces
to which we are otherwise constantly subject, and enables us to
see them as they really are and recognise their insignificance.
It tends to impress us with a conviction of the dignity of
human nature and to instil into our minds the idea of our
capacity to rise superior to our surroundings. It helps to
place us under the dominion of our intellectual powers and to
remove us from the influence of the passionate and emotional
side of our nature. This exaltation of the intellectual faculties
is not by any means necessarily at the expense of the moral
qualities of man?s nature, and indeed is quite consistent with
the equal development of the moral qualities. But it
influences this development and submits it to the scrutiny of
the intellect, making it rest upon the rational basis of a
conviction of the superiority of right over wrong, of virtue
over vice, instead of abandoning it to the impulses of passion
or emotion. In the contemplation of some historical character
the thought will often present itself to our minds that, had we
been situated as he was, we should have been able to act more
wisely and avoid the mistakes into which he fell. We can
usually tell with precision how another man ought to have
acted. This feeling does not entirely arise from a self-satisfied
conviction of our own abilities, nor from the wisdom which


comes after the event. It arises at least in part from the fact
that we are able to contemplate the circumstances dispassion-
ately. We see the broad principles of action which should
have operated on his mind and influenced his conduct, but we
neglect to take into account the unseen springs and under-
currents which doubtless exercised important influences.
Now culture helps us to take up this attitude of dispassionate
examination with regard to our conduct. It draws us away
from our own personality, and helps us to contemplate our
personal surroundings without emotion and without bias.
Thus it enables us to judge more rationally and to frame our
actions more philosophically.
Culture, too, ? is inconsistent with the over-development
of any one power at the expense of the rest.? Its lessons are,
therefore, not merely intended for the uninformed. It admon-
ishes us not only that we should seek to acquire knowledge,
but that we should guard against tne danger of incomplete
and partial mental training. That this latter admonition is
very necessarv is exemplified by the fact, that we continually
find men, who, from natural capacity or special training, have
attained eminence in one branch of knowledge, evincing a
tendency to exalt their own particular branch, as if it covered
the whole field of intellectual and moral activity. This mental
one-sidedness would be sufficiently objectionable if it merely
had the effect of inducing in its victims an incapacity to recog-
nise the importance of other branches of knowledge, but when
it takes-the aggressive form of disparaging or ostentatiously
exhibiting indifference to those other branches, it becomes
well nioh intolerable. It is a characteristic of the cultured mind
o
to evince an appreciation of mental eminence or moral worth
in whatever department of human affairs it is manifested. It
is the misfortune of mankind that their limited capacities will
not usually allow of their acquiring a comprehensive know-
ledge of all the arts and sciences. To know ? something of


everything and everything of something ? is the utmost that
any man can now-a-days hope to achieve, and, recognising that
of some things he must necessarily know very little, the man
of culture gladly extends the hand of fellowship to the workers
in other departments of science, and looks with a tolerant eye
upon their unavoidable deficiencies in his own. Hence when
we find men exhibiting a tendency to magnify abnormally
their own particular art, and at the same time manifesting an
intolerant and hypercritical spirit towards the ? Philistines ,r
who devote themselves to other branches of knowledge, we
may safely conclude that, however eminent such men may be
in their own particular sphere, we cannot allow their claim
to rank themselves as men of culture.
Now viewed solely in this light the doctrine of culture appears
to be unexceptionable. Its tendency clearly is to exercise a
humanising influence on mankind by exalting in them those
intellectual and moral faculties which differentiate men from the
unreasoning animals. But so far we have regarded it mainly
as an ideal theory, and when we come to examine the question
of its applicability to the existing state of society we are com-
pelled to take into account a number of circumstances to
which we have as yet given little or no consideration, for we
must remember that its chief exponents have insisted upon
its applicability to practical affairs?to politics and the social
sciences, no less than to religion and morals.
The main difficulty which arises in the application of the
doctrine springs from the fact that there is at present no
general recognition of its principles. It is not enough that
the doctrine should be theoretically perfect ; it must also be
applicable to the state of society in which it is proposed to be
introduced, and not unsuited to the agencies through which
it is intended to operate. As long as the recognition of its
functions is confined to a few persons no great results can be
anticipated. The only hope for it lies in the general accept


ance of the belief in its beneficent influence which its advocates
entertain. The mass of mankind will not surrender the con-
duct of their affairs to a few, however enlightened those few
may be ; or however much better fitted they may be to con-
duct those affairs than the majority of their fellow men. There-
fore, if culture is ever to be an effective force in the world it
must be general.
The bulk of mankind are not averse to culture, but they
are indifferent to it. They never think about it all, or if they
ever cast a thought upon it, the thought is speedily driven
out by the pressure of more immediate concerns. With large
masses of mankind the provision of the bare necessaries of
existence engrosses all their care ; and, whilst this is so, all
thoughts of culture are necessarily removed from their minds.
For the study of perfection, which culture contemplates,
almost necessarily involves an amount of time for leisure
and reflection, which in the present state of society is quite
beyond the reach of large numbers of men. Of course it is
quite true that many men are quite uncultured, who have
abundance of time for leisure and reflection, but this is in
many cases due to the fact that they are influenced by their
surroundings, and unconsciously take the tone of the society
in which they live. With the poor the all-absorbing idea is
how to become rich and independent, and the idea remains
predominant long after the circumstances which called it into
existence have ceased to operate. lamby no means an advo-
cate of-the virtue of riches, but I think that it cannot be
denied that in so far as they relieve men from the pressure of
their more imperious necessities, and s6t their minds free for
the contemplation of more refining thoughts, they must, as
things at present go, be counted amongst the important aids
to culture. Poverty and ignorance proverbially go hand in
hand, and the fact that some great souls are capable of rising
superior to their poverty, if not the exception which is popu-


larly supposed to prove the rule, is at any rate in no way
inconsistent with the general principle.
It would be satisfactory to find some means of reconciling
the demands which culture make upon its votaries with the
restricted opportunities which poverty imposes.' And such a
reconciliation is by no means impossible. For it is not so
much the disabilities under which the poor actually labour
which hinder the growth of icfined sentiment amongst them,
as the sense of insecurity and hopelessness which their position
engenders. A state of society in which the fear of actual
privation was removed, even though there was little affluence
in it. might be even more favourable to the development of
men?s better nature, than a state of society in which much
luxury prevailed. It may seem somewhat incongruous to
introduce the problem of supplying man?s material wants into
a discussion of the principles of culture, but if we desire to
take a comprehensive view of the circumstances, I think we
cannot shut our eyes to the connection between the two.
Culture strives after the perfection of the intellectual and
moral faculties, and if we desire to face the difficulties of the
situation fairly we must recognise the fact, that numbers of
our fellow men have as yet barely emerged from the barbarous
state ?the state in which man?s whole energies are devoted to
the satisfaction of his animal wants. Of course Ido not
contend that culture has no place in the world until these
material problems are solved, nor do I deny that in the
solution of the problems themselves culture may render us
most important services. But I think it well that we should
obtain a thorough conception of the difficulties of the situation.
By doing so we shall have a better understanding of how to
direct our energies, and shall thereby avoid many errors and
disappointments.
In examining the doctrine of culture as usually expounded,
we cannot help being to some extent impressed with a feeling


of its incongruity with existing facts. There seems to be a
suggestion of mere idealistic theorising about it ; a want of
applicability to our present needs. If we try to discover the
origin of this feeling, I think it will be found to have its root
in the fact that its expounders have little or no suggestions
to offer as to the methods by which their ideas are to be
realised. They have themselves, probably, a thorough grasp
of the doctrine which they inculcate ; they contemplate the
essential attributes of their theory and recognise its beauty.
The weakness of their position seems to be that they manifest
a certain inability, or unwillingness, to suggest any scheme
by which an approach might be made to the realisation of
their ideas. At present there are numerous agencies at work
in the world which are diametrically opposed to the doctrines
of culture, and there are many more which tend to obscure
them, and divert men?s thoughts in other directions. It,
therefore, appears to me to be essential that its votaries should
not content themselves with a mere statement of principles,
however excellent, but that they should labour diligently for
the fulfilment of their designs. The man of culture must not
be a mere idealist or dreamer ; it is essential that he should
be conversant with mankind and have some knowledge of
practical affairs. For, since culture demands the full and
harmonious development of the mental and moral faculties,
it follows that the truly cultured man should have a proper
appreciation of the forces which run counter to his designs.
We must be very careful that in striving after the ideal we
do not overlook the necessities of the moment. Each day
brings with it its own problems ?problems which will not
wait for solution, but must be answered at once. Mankind is
constantly beset by the necessity of moving in some direction,
and if the enlightened spirits amongst men will not lead us ?
if they must contemplate and remain inactive ?we are inevit-
ably thrust under the leadership of the rude and uneducated.


It is impossible for us to remain stationary, and the only
question is in what direction our course is to be taken.
Now, clearly, if this conception of human affairs is correct,,
it would be better that the wise and judicious should be our
leaders, however faltering and uncertain, than that we should
trust to the guidance of the uninformed, however self-satisfied
and confident.
It is from this point of view that the doctrine has hitherto
been most open to criticism. Great problems are pre-
senting themselves at the present time, and, indeed, at all
times, for solution, and it is somewhat of a reproach to the
advocates of culture, not that they are unable to solve them,
but that many of them seem to regard it as no part of their
duty to offer any suggestions for their solution. The doctrine,
as hitherto expounded, has been too negative, too conservative
to kindle the sympathetic interest of mankind. This seems
to me quite the opposite to what it should be. Culture
obviously contemplates a state of society vastly different from
that at present existing. Consequently, culture should not
oppose itself to change, but should rather place itself at the
head of the movement and endeavor to control and direct it.
It is one of the misfortunes of mankind that the necessity
of change is always most keenly felt by those classes which
are least qualified to effect it judiciously. In every reform
the moving impulse seems to come from below. The lower
strata of society, impelled by force of circumstances, goad the
whole social organism into movement, whilst those who from
their position and attainments, are the natural leaders of men,
move reluctantly under the pressure of forces which they are
unable to resist. The advance of mankind is hardly ever the
outcome of a well-devised preconcerted plan, but usually the
result of a blind groping for relief from the pressure of
remorseless circumstances. Hence it is that so many move-


merits of society are not really advances at all, but retro-
gressions, or at best merely useless innovatious.
The change in our methods of thought which culture contem-
plates must necessarily be very gradually effected. For it
rejects, or at least subordinates, those emotional forces by
which great revolutions are sometimes rapidly effected in
men?s minds. It aims at effecting its objects mainly through
the intellectual side of man?s nature, for though it is far from
disregarding spiritual and moral influences, it endeavours to
approach them also from the intellectual side.
Such being the agencies by which it seeks to operate, it
follows of necessity that the recognition of the truth of its
principles can only be slowly evolved. It must be content
to diffuse itself slowly from intellect to intellect and from
generation to generation, until in the due order of pro-
gression it secures the predominance of its ideas. But the
votaries of culture must recognise that between the ideal
standard of excellence which they set before us and the real
existing standard of to-day there is a wide chasm, and they
must also recognise that the work of bridging this chasm
mainly rests with them. They must not wait in contem-
plative inactivity until the world has risen to the standard of
their ideal. They must show the earnestness of their faith
by working for the realisation of their designs, by manifesting
their sympathy with the difficulties and the weaknesses of
humanity.
It would appear then that one of the functions of culture
at the present time is to contemplate men as they actually
are, and to consider in what way a wider knowledge of its
principles can be diffused.
The most obvious method is by the spread of education,
using the term in the somewhat narrow signification in which
it is popularly employed. It is true that the advocates of


culture frequently take exception to our existing methods of
education. It is urged that much of what at present passes
for education is merely a shallow and superficial intellectual
polish, destitute of culture and refinement, and conveying
no suggestions of the higher possibilities of life.
It may, no doubt, be admitted that this charge of shallow-
ness and superficiality is not entirely devoid of foundation.
It may also be admitted that numbers of people appear to
expect from this superficial mental training results quite
beyond what it is capable of producing. But, when so much
has been admitted, it may still be questioned whether the
present system must not be regarded as an indispensable pre-
liminary?as a first step which must be taken before the
perfection of the mental and moral faculties can be even con-
templated. Even the greatest scholar had at some period of
his career to learn laboriously the letters of the alphabet.
1 here is no royal road to learning. All the stages of the
journey must be traversed before the destination can be
reached.
It is in this aspect that we are justified in looking hopefully
to the spread of education, even of elementary education.
U A little learning is a dangerous thing,? says Pope;
and he is doubtless right. But no learning at all is
still more dangerous, if not absolutely fatal. Only teach
a man to read, and what possibilities are at once opened
up to him ! It is like the acquirement of a new sense.
An appeal is made to his intelligence, to his moral nature,
through a hundred channels which before were closed to him.
It may be that the extension of his powers effects no very
marked alteration in the man himself, that he apparently
remains as he was, unenlightened and unrefined. Yet it can
hardly be that he is not in some way the better for his new
acquirement.


There cannot be any general conception of culture until
education is widely diffused, and this process of diffusion can-
not be carried out without at times running the risk of
shallowness and superficiality. We must learn to grasp the
fact that this perfection, to the study of which culture calls
us, is the final stage in a long course of progression. We will
then understand that many agencies may be working towards
this goal without our perceiving at the moment that they
are so working. Their sphere of action is perhaps widely
removed from that of the idealist, yet they may be working
in the direction in which the idealist desires to guide them ?
may be doing work which must be accomplished before the
idealist?s conceptions have any chance of being realised.
It may be, too, that it is an error to institute a contrast
between the men of thought and the men of action. Each
have their peculiar functions in society, which cannot be dis-
charged by the other. Many men are by nature and by
training endowed with ideas of the highest order, but they
are hampered in the diffusion of their ideas by the fact that
they move in an entirely different plane of thought from the
average man. Their circumstances and surroundings are not
the same, and since nothing but actual experience can supply
a thorough insight into the requirements of mankind, there
is apt to be a want of sympathy between them and their
fellows This want of sympathy is alike injurious to both,
for it deprives the men of culture of the means of realising
their ideas, and it deprives the mass of the uncultured of that
enlightenment and encouragement which they need so much.
In this emergency we require the assistance of the men of
action, the men of the world, who, while having a thorough
grasp of the wants and weaknesses of their fellow men, are
not without some conception of a higher order of things to
which it may eventually be possible to attain. Thus the

men of thought supply the beacon fires to guide their fellows,
whilst the men of action, placing themselves at the head of
the movement, show how to overcome the obstacles that
intervene.
In this way the men of culture, without exercising any very
perceptible immediate influence on their fellows, may supply
the inspiration to those by whom the masses are guided, and
thus in the due course of events may secure the fulfilment of
their designs. The ameliorating influence of a great idea is
never entirely lost though its influence may not be imme-
diately apparent. It percolates gradually through all the
strata of society until at length it reaches even the lowest.

All it?s madd?ning cares and crosses,
As its plays it?s little part,

AMONG the many poems descriptive of modem English
life in its homely aspects, with which Tennyson has
enriched our literature, perhaps none is more widely
known and appreciated than Enoch Arden.
Many, who find little to enchain their interest in the
reasoning of such poems as ? The Two Voices,? or ? In
Meraoriam,? or in that exquisite modern version of the
old parable of Dives and Lazarus, contained in the ? Palace
of Art,??and whose sympathies are but partly enlisted by
the beautiful ? Idylls of the King,? which treat of times, and
scenes, and lives so far removed from ours, half-veiled in the
mists of tradition, ?would turn with a keen sense of enjoy-
ment to such sketches of simple everyday life as are contained
in ?Ihe Miller?s Daughter,? ?The May Queen,? ?The
Grandmother,? ?The Gardener?s Daughter,? and? ? Enoch
Arden.? Each of the several groups or classes into which
Tennyson?s poems might be divided, has a distinct beauty of
its own, and comparisons between them are as unwise as
between such types of womanhood as his ? Princess Ida.?
Mrs. Browning?s ?My Kate,? Whittier?s ?Maud Muller,?
and last, but not least, Lowell?s exquisite portraiture of ? My
Love.?
Each of these heroines has her own special merits, probably
also, her own particular failings, and they are not capable of
comparison, the one with the other, it is just a question of
individual taste.


Those who are disposed to make their selection among the
class to which ? Enoch Arden ?? belongs, may find pleasure
in the knowledge that it was the poems of ? The Miller?s
Daughter? and ?Lady Clara Vere de Vere? which first
awakened the interest of Royalty in Alfred Tennyson.
The story of ? Enoch Arden ? is too well known to require
outlining here. All will agree as to its naturalness. There
is nothing strained or improbable about it from start to
finish.
The materials out of which it is woven are of the simplest
and most commonplace description ?if indeed, we dare apply
that word to any life ?however prosaic its incidents may
appear.
After all, the wonder is, that, all lives being so largely
composed of the same threads, the patterns should vary so
much as they do.
Into the lives of Enoch, Philip, and Annie, came, at
different times, and in varying proportions ?
?Love?s blue, joy?s gold, and fair between, hope?s shifting rays of
emerald green.
With either side in bright relief, a crimson, pain; a violet, grief.
Yet are- we sure, that whatsoe?er, the changing hues each life
may wear.
It needs them all, that, pure and white, God?s hand may weave the
perfect light.?
How the childhood of these three foreshadow their future,
as they play at housekeeping on the beach, and Annie is
always mistress, while Philip and Enoch strive for sole
possession of home and wife, and Annie would fain make
peace and satisfy both.
Between these two, in after years, ? the balance of joy and
sorrow is held with an even hand.?
When the time comes for Annie to make choice for life
between them, Enoch?s happiness is his friend?s doom, and


Philip, in the golden light of an autumnal sunset, turning
from all the merry-making,
? Had his dark hour unseen, and rose, and past
Bearing a life-long hunger in his heart.?
Our sympathies go out to him, the devoted son, the unselfish
chivalrous friend, and we can scarcely help grudging to Enoch
the success that involves such loss and suffering to him.
But wait a little ; turn over the pages, pass over the years;
there is a companion picture.
The golden autumnal sunset lights it up. Winter is here ;
and Enoch, shivering under something colder than the sharp
November blast, gazes from without at the firelight flickering
and dancing on a scene of domestic comfort and happiness,
which gives the final touch to his loneliness and misery.
The wheel of fortune has gone round indeed.
Which of these men has suffered most, who shall say ?
Annie seems a more ordinary character than either of her
husbands. That such men are to be found there is no
question, only they are not as plentiful as blackberries. But
such women as Annie can be found by the score. In not
ranking her above the average, we are, of course, paying a
high compliment to the average woman, in what are known
as the lower walks of life. But is it undeserved ? Do we not
all know many who might have sat for her likeness ?
Strong though the love between herself and her husband is r
her opinions and judgments do not weigh with him at all.
Womanlike, she urges against his proposed course of action
no reasonable objection, but her own presentiments, fears,
and intuitions ; and manlike, he laughs at them, yet cannot
laugh her out of them, however tenderly he tries to do it.
To all his reasonings and assurances she only answers?
? Oh, Enoch ! you are wise.
And yet, for all your wisdom, well I know
That I shall look upon your face no more.?


One can hardly help just here, questioning whether there
was not a side to Annie?s nature which Enoch did not and
could not understand, and which Philip would have been
much more capable of responding to and sympathising with.
However, as Longfellow says,
The men that women marry ?
And why they marry them will always be
A marvel and a mystery to the world/"
And if Enoch could not understand his wife?s fears and fancies,
he at least points out to her in loving and hearty fashion the
two best remedies for all trouble, real or imaginary?work
and prayer.
?Look to the babes, and, ?till I come again
Keep everything ship-shape, for I must go.
And fear no more for me, or if yon fear
Cast all your cares on God ?that anchor holds.?
And, in the long years that followed, through
? The hope, the fear, and the sorrow
All the aching of heart, the restless, unsatisfied longing.
All the dull, deep pain and constant anguish of patience.?
and in the shock, the utter misery and loneliness of that deso-
late long-deferred home-coming, when wife and children in
sight, within reach, must be renounced utterly, and for ever,
?through all this Enoch proved that he knew how to
follow his own prescription.
Nevertheless, the strain, the shock, the absolute emptiness
of his life, the total extinction of all his hopes, and the
burden of his self-imposed vow of silence, undermined his
already impaired health, and one year after his return to
England ? the strong, heroic soul ? of Enoch Arden passed
away.
?A shipwrecked sailor,? verily, for in that tropical storm
that sunk his vessel, home, love, hope, and everything that
made life worth having, perished too.


There is wonderful pathos in that passage where,anticipating
a meeting in heaven with their child, he sends Annie the lock
of hair he has treasured, to comfort her, and be to her a
token that he was truly Enoch.
And how beautiful the death scene, when answering the
mighty calling of the sea, he cries
? A sail, a sail, I am saved/?
And then u crosses the bar ? into the desired haven ?
? To wait his treasures on that far-off shore
Where Death, his friend, will give them back to him.?
Without detracting one iota from Enoch?s strength or
heroism, some, and not a few, might feel inclined to award a
yet higher place to Philip Ray, just as many are disposed to
love Jonathan better than David. This point, however,
which would make a debate as interesting as some we have
heard, must be left for the present.
In this, as in all Tennyson?s poems, the descriptions of
scenery are perfect as to detail, and exquisitely beautiful.
For instance ?the opening passage ?how it brings before us
the little village where this life-drama is enacted ; its long
lines of cliff and yellow sands, where the children play, and
build castles in the sand, aye, and in less substantial materials
too, sometimes ; the mouldering church, which yet knew how
to send forth its merry peal of bells for the bridals celebrated
within its walls ; the long street, climbing to the tail-towered
mill that sheltered a knight as true as ever received the
accolade ; and the grey down and hazelwood where both
Enoch and Philip did their courting.
For a complete contrast, take the account of the loveliness
and luxuriance, yet the desolation and loneliness, of Enoch?s
island refuge.
Little enough he cared for the beauty so lavishly spread
around him. ? His eyes were with his heart, and that was


far away.? How perfect the description of this ?shipwrecked
sailor waiting for a sail.?
Psychologists might find much to interest them in this poem.
There is Annie, with her premonitions of evil, her
instinctive feeling that Enoch is not dead, though the
probabilities, almost amounting to certainties, are all against
her. Even the favourite old device of seeking a sign, and its
apparent confirmation by a dream, fail to satisfy her heart,
or lull her fears to rest. Women like Annie are not reason-
able beings, but they sometimes make marvellously near
guesses at the truth.
And the shipwrecked Enoch, unimaginative and matter-of-
fact as he once was, we find living among the visions and
phantoms of other days ; his wife and children and early
home seem to haunt him continually.
Here, doubtless on the day when Annie, perceiving that
? there is no reason ? why she and Philip should not wed,
has stifled her own feelings and intuitions, and married him
?her mind so acts on Enoch?s that he hears the pealing of
his parish bells, which bring no joy to Annie?s heart, and
makes him shudder, he knows not why, in sympathy.
And we, who have read this simple and pathetic story of
humble life, have not we to own at its close that after all its
strongest influence upon us has come, not from the beauty of
the language or the spell of the poetry, though these are
potent, but from the deeper feelings excited by sympathy
and the belief that in admiring and pitying the characters
herein described we are not paying a sentimental tribute to
the mere creations of a poet?s fancy, but yielding their just
meed of honour and loving recognition to real men and
women, who by patient toil and self-sacrifice have done what
they could to leave earth the richer and better for their living
and dying.


Concernma Cburcb Morfc.
PERHAPS one of the most hopeful signs of the present
day is the spirit of inquiry, of restlessness, which is
pervading all ranks.
Everywhere there is an anxiety to find the very best
methods of teaching and working in all departments, and
time-honoured methods are being discarded for others
supposed to be quicker and better than the old.
Nowhere is this trend of modern thought more plainly
shown than in connection with our churches.
But this paper is not to deal with the revision of creeds and
dogmas, but to occupy itself for a little while with the
practical side of the question.
What are our Churches here in Australia doing for the
great bulk of the non-church-going population ?
Their duties are plainly stated in that Book from which the
Church Universal professes to take her instructions, and yet
how imperfectly have they been carried out ?in many cases
how shamefully neglected !
Ask the average Church member and Bible student what
is the duty of the Church to the world, and he will probably
reply, ?To preach the gospel, of course ! ? Inquire further
as to how he thinks his share of the duty is to be carried out,
and you are told of a mission fund and annual collection to
which your informant contributes, more or less willingly, his
guinea, half-crown, or threepenny-bit, and feels that he, at
least, has done his part.
That there are many exceptions to this rule we know, but
they form only a small minority, even among church members.
At the present time, when the Salvation Army, after its own
fashion, and East End Missions and Sisterhoods, in their way,


are showing the world how to care for the bodies as well as
the souls of men, is it not a fact that to the great bulk of
Australian church-goers the thought of going and doing
likewise never occurs.
Perhaps we, like our American cousins, are a little too apt
to despise the day of small things, and wait for something
big. Perhaps, instead of each church setting to work in its
own immediate locality, they are waiting for some grand
united plan of attack on the city slums, with a Sisterhood,
and a cluster of specially adapted buildings. Doubtless the
above is a very desirable state of things ; union is strength,
and such a federated mission could do a great deal, but great
bodies move slowly, and while they wait for this, time is
flying on.
What is most urgently needed is that those within the pale
of the churches should awake to their individual duties.
Organizations and Committees are all very well in their way,
but the crying want of the world to-day is for individual help
and sympathy.
The Bible -enjoins this in scores of passages, such as the
parable of the Good Samaritan ; the injunction to feed the
hungry, clothe the naked, and visit the sick and imprisoned ;
making no distinction of class or creed, but dealing to good
and evil alike the measure of love and help they need, ouf of
a heart overflowing with pity and sympathy for all humanity.
No one denies that such a line of action is strictly enjoined,
and yet many who profess Christianity make not the slightest
effort to carry out these precepts.
In every suburb, lying within easy reach of its churches,
may be found scores of families, principally of the working
class, who are to all intents and purposes heathens.
What are the Churches doing for these ? In many cases
nothing 5 within the Churches there is constant activity.


Literary and debating societies, temperance organisations,
socials, and meetings of a strictly religious character, follow
each other in quick succession ; the Sunday services are
made as attractive, the Sunday-school teaching as efficient, as
possible.
When the yearly report is read, and all these various
societies and branches are enumerated, and an account of
their various achievements set down in black and white, it
seems as if the Church is a veritable hive of industry. And
so it is, but, for the most part, within its own boundary and
among its own adherents solely.
It is a sort of social club. Parents are glad for their young
folks to join the Literary Society, the Glee Club, or some one of
the other forms of safe amusement affiliated to the Church,
and so this social side of church-work, as it is called, grows
and prospers. Energetic and often highly-gifted members
throw themselves heartily into it, and there is no question
but that by it much good is done in preventing the children
of the Church going further afield in search of amusement,
and forming undesirable and questionable associations.
But, while all who come are very gladly welcomed, there
are but few who go into the highways and hedges in search
of waifs and strays. I here is a general impression that
church-going is ? a duty." Ought it not to be looked upon
still more in the light of a privilege ? There is a common
idea too that attendance at public service?say twice on
Sunday?alone constitutes ? a very religious ?? person. For
such an idea there is no Bible warrant. Doing , not only
hearing, God?s will is there required.
Is there not a real danger too of such people becoming
gorged, so to speak, with spiritual and mental food, getting
more than they can properly assimilate or digest if they
never take any spiritual exercise. They receive everything


and give out nothing. Disastrous, we know, would be the
results of such action in the physical world ; can they be less
so in the spiritual ?
What sort of obedience is theirs to the Master, who said
? Inasmuch as ye have done it unto one of the least of these,
ye have done it to Me," and whose whole life was spent in
helping, blessing and comforting ?not the souls alone, nor
even, we think chiefly ?but the bodies of men, His brethren
and ours ?
Here and there, men and women are awaking to the fact
that it is the sorrowing who need solace, the benighted who
need light, that it is their business to carry the gospel to
those who will not come to it. A wide field for labour exists
among those who, while fairly honest, yet, through pressure
of poverty, and ignorance, furnish constant recruits to the
lower strata, the criminal classes.
But while something?would that it were a hundredfold
more ?is being done, it is unquestionably true that long years
of neglect and indifference are bearing their legitimate fruit,
and those whom we, like the Levite, have so long ? passed
by on the other side,? find considerable difficulty in believing,
all at once in our good intentions.
The churches have so long queried ? Can any good thing
come out of Nazareth ?? that Nazareth now retaliates, and
many, confident of their own purity of purpose and desire to
help, find themselves coldly received and their motives mis-
interpreted, till they are in danger of withdrawing from the
work, permanently discouraged. Much tact, patience, and
love are necessary in beginning to labour among the artisan
and poorer classes, but when persevered in, these will almost
invariably win the day.
Of course, every member of a church could not spare time
for such work. For many it would be impossible, and an


impossibility can never be a duty. But if each, according to
his power or ability would so work, we should count hundreds
where we now have units.
At present we think of a nonconformist church in a
Melbourne suburb where several branches of outside work are
engaged in. For instance, districts were allotted to certain
volunteers, and house to house visitation undertaken, with a
view of ascertaining the families who attended some place of
worship. Those who neither went anywhere nor expressed
any special preference the visitors invited to their own
church ; and children, under the same circumstances, were
invited to Sunday-school.
Many cases of sore distress, arising from lack of employ-
ment or sickness were discovered ?often among those who
shrank from applying to the local Benevolent Society ?and
helped in whatever way they needed, quite irrespective of
creed or sect. This visiting goes on systematically. Some
have been induced to attend church ; many others cannot or
will not as yet do so, but welcome the visitor heartily, consult
with her, and give her their confidence. On many of these
families an uplifting influence has been exerted, and a per-
ceptible improvement has taken place in the homes.
Among some who do come to church, a ludicrous misunder-
standing has been found to exist, namely, that the visitor
gets so much per head for each person induced to attend.
Disinterested labour on the part of the churches is very hard
for them to believe in.
The chief aim of these workers, however, is not to obtain
new adherents, but to find those who need help, who have
? fallen by the wayside,? and succour them. By another
section of workers a weekly meeting is held for married
women who are glad of assistance in sewing, in which so few
workmen?s wives are proficient. Materials are purchased at


wholesale prices, any garment desired is cut out, and the
making supervised by a competent person. There is no
desire to pauperise the women, so they pay the cost price of
material in instalments, as convenient. These are entered in
a book, and the garment taken home when paid for. During
the sewing-time an interesting story is read aloud, afterwards
a short bright service is held lasting about 15 to 20 minutes,
conducted by one of the elder ladies of the church ; some-
times alternating with a ?musical afternoon,? and always
followed by ? afternoon tea ? and scones.
Several creeds and sects are here represented. They are
invited to bring their infants with them, and the children
are taken charge of for the afternoon ?after the fashion of a
creche, only without payment. To many of these poor
mothers, this, their solitary weekly outing, is the one bright
spot in their lives, and they are rarely absent.
This church is fortunate in numbering among its attendants
a well-known Melbourne doctor, who, having made his
fortune, retired from practice some three or four years ago,
and settled down in the suburb of . He has, of his
own free will, offered to visit gratuitously any necessitous
cases which the church-workers may recommend to him, and
to supply them with medicine free of charge. This, notwith-
standing its fairy-tale sound, is perfectly true, and there
are very few weeks wherein his kind offer is not taken
advantage of.
On the Christmas-eve just past, ten families, of various
denominations, but all in extreme poverty, were made glad
by each receiving a parcel containing beef, with suet and
sausages, a plum-pudding, a Christmas cake, tea, sugar, and
sweets for the children. The whole involved an outlay of
about and caused an amount of joy and thankfulness
which those who were privileged to witness them will not


soon forget. All this work has been done in a locality which
is not considered an especially poor one, yet urgently needs
many more workers.
Indeed, the beauty of this particular sanctuary and the
respectability of its congregations is constantly made the
excuse for non-attendance by those invited, and one can
hardly wonder at the feeling. Collection-plates and pew-
rents too, are very sore points, and again we are not surprised,
yet what is to be done ?
Mission-halls are by some supposed to solve the difficulty,
but is there not a kind of second-class-carriage-feeling about
that arrangement ? the church for the rich, the hall for the
poor. But love is fertile in expedients ; if every man and
woman inside the churches would resolve to do that which
lies nearest to their hand?just at their door?and which,
indeed, they cannot neglect without sin, giving not money
alone but their time and themselves, where possible, instead
of waiting for that untangible abstraction called ?The
Church,? to take the initiative, there would be far less of the
bitter class-feeling, which shows itself from time to time so
painfully. How are the poor to believe in the existence of
a love to our neighbour which never finds expression in action ?
And doubt of man engenders distrust of God,
? For God?s possible is shown by His world?s loving
And the toilers doubt of each.?
Here in Australia, under happier conditions still , despite all
our troubles, than those which prevail in older lands, there is
a grand opportunity for individual members of individual
churches to work out their creed, and help to bring about
days like those of which Macaulay sings in the lines??
? Then the great man helped the poor
And the poor man loved the great.
And Romans were like brothers
In the brave days of old.?


H IDiolin
? AT OW,? said the old Violin, ? If I agree to tell you some of
i- M my history and experience, you must understand that
I shall follow no set rules, but will just say what I like, how
I like. Let us call our talk a fantasia, there is something in
a suitable name, and I have been such a wanderer that my
thoughts have got the habit of roving, and could never settle
down to a single theme, even with variations.?
??Certainly, tell your story your own way,? I answered, as
I settled myself comfortably, with my hand on its neck, and
waited in the fast gathering twilight for it to begin.
Presently a soft, sweet sound stole to my ears, nor articulate
speech exactly, and yet not only a strain of music, but a
marvellous blending of both impossible to describe.
? Do not be impatient,? it said, ??if I am tedious, or if my
reminiscences go back to scenes and days that have little
interest for the present generation. Old things, and I am
very old, are being pushed aside, and are but lightly thought
?of in the'world to-day.?
? Nay,? I said, ? there are some old things and people that
we only love the better and value the more for their age.
Great knowledge, increase of usefulness, deeper sympathies,
?come with the years to some, and such an old age can never
fail to win veneration and love.?
? Is it so in your world,? it answered, ? It was long ago, in
the old Bavarian forest of which I once formed a part. There
the old trees were kings among their fellows, how grand they
were, and how perfect. I have heard from your Holy Book
that when Earth first came from its Creator?s hands He said
everything was very good, and the trees still carry out their
.Maker?s plan for them. They girdle the globe with health


and beauty ; they climb steep hill-tops with messages of
courage and endurance ; they go down into the valleys,
teaching humility and contentment ; they provide food, drink
and shelter for the half-fainting traveller in the desert ; and
supply dwellers in tropical islands with all the necessaries of
life ; while at the cry of human weakness or pain they yield
up cheerfully whatever it is in their power to give, to
strengthen, soothe or heal.
? Well for the world if men, in their higher life, with its
more varied gifts and powers, would but half as perfectly fulfil
the purposes of their creation, and endeavor to by love serve
one another.?
I moved uneasily, and it stopped. ?Where was I? Oh yes,
in the forest. How delicious it was there. Oh ! the rush of
the storm wind down the icy sides of the Karwendel or
Wetterstein mountains ; and then, in Summertime, how
delightful the play of the breezes what ethereal melodies
they sang to the pines, how sweetly the musical murmur of
the Iser blended with the hum of insect life all around ; then,
at night, what wonderful sights the trees looked down upon,
the revels of the fairies, sprites and gnomes, who dwelt in
that old wood ; sometimes, in winter, the dread and terrible
Erl-king passed through.
? Sometimes, in the Summer moonlight, we saw the lovely
lady of the Karwendel flit past, with her white, beseeching
face. She was imprisoned in the heart of the mountain
centuries since by the king of the gnomes, and guarded by
dragons keeping sleepless watch at the door of her palace,
which was surrounded by a fiery lake. At certain periods
she was liberated for a brief space, and then sought to find a
child, or one of pure heart, who making the sign of the cross
showing no fear, might safely pass the fiery lake and terrible
dragons, and so, gainingflhe palace, would find therein a magic


sword wherewith to slay them and free the lady, who would
richly reward the service with mountain treasure.
? Often I think of her, and wonder is she a captive still, or
has some brave knight or heroic maiden, strong in faith and
purity, set her free ?
? Ah, well ! That part of my existence, with its storms and
sunshine, is over long, long ago. I did not know it at the
time, but all those years were only part of my training.
? The day came when pine and maple lay with their crowns
in the dust, and through every fibre of their being, thrillechan
intensity of anguish and despair, but the end was not yet.
? But the other trees of the forest did not know this, and
over their fallen comrades they wailed and sobbed, and rocked,,
moaning bitterly.
u ?Was it for this,? they said, ?ye grew so fair and strong,
and stately?for this ? ?
? True, we have seen some of our number fall ere now,,
crashing down before the victorious path of the storm-fiend,
and have sung their requiem ; yet we know that to those he
spares he gives increased strength and endurance ; besides he
is our master, and only destroys those who will not bow in
allegiance to him.
?But to die thus ?smitten to death by a tool in the hand of
a pigmy who would not dare to walk alone through the
forest at night. What can it mean ? Does the Creator
know? Would He permit such wanton destruction of life,
His own gift ??
? So,? said the violin tremulously, ?I left the forest for
ever, and terrible days followed. Sharp tools wrought upon
upon me, and existence was one prolonged agony. There
is not one of my 58 different pieces that has not quivered
with intense suffering, or the torturing anticipation of it. I


looked on men, my tormentors, as fiends, and oh ! how I
hated them. I scorned, as a fable, all that I had heard in the
forest of a Creator, who is good to all that His hands have
made.
? How foolish I was, and ignorant, in those days ! I have
learned much since then ! I know that you, too, have to
endure hardness, and be fitted by suffering and discipline for
another life, a wider sphere. But human spirits have teaching
and knowledge ; if I had had these I think I could have
endured all patiently, buoyed up by the thought cf the
after-time, when I should be a perfect instrument, fit
for the hand of the master.
? Shall I ever forget the hour when first I knew what I was ?
It was a glorious summer day, and I, with numbers of objects
like myself, had been placed in the air, hanging in a line,
freshly varnished, to dry.
,l Presently, down the village street, came a youth, in the
picturesque dress of that country, still dearer to me than all
others. Over his shoulders hung a wallet, from which anon
he drew a facsimile of myself, except that what I took for
gossamer threads of great thickness were fastened across it.
? Taking in his right hand a wand he drew it back and
forward over the strings, as I now know them to be.
? I have heard other and far better music since, but never
has anything ?not even excepting my own first notes ?stirred
in me the tumult of delight produced by the performance of
that poor mountain artist.
? For then, by a swift intuition, I knew and understood the
purpose of all I had gone through, and felt in full and perfect
accord with it. This, then, was the solution of that mystery
of pain I had longed so fruitlessly to understand. I tried to
cry out in my joy, but I was still dumb, though conscious of a
soul and a power within me that seemed as if it must find voice


? 1 Patience ! ? said a summer-breeze close to me, as it felt
and swayed to the passionate vibrations quivering through
my frame, ? a little longer, and thou shalt find voice, and tell
the world what is stirring thy spirit now. Thou art not yet
completed, and when thou art, there still is needed a human
heart and hand to interpret thy dreams for thee.?
? With such a hope how could Ibe impatient. Day after
day I mused peacefully on the possibilities of the future, half
awed to think that I should have been chosen and fitted for
this work. If I had one intense wish it was that the trees
in my old forest should know what had happened. This desire
my friend, the breeze, undertook to gratify, but came back
sighing to me, saying she could not make them understand,
yet, they said, if indeed happiness were possible oat of the
the forest, they were glad I had found it.
?Here, thinking the violin disposed to linger too long
amid the scenes of its youth, I whispered, 1 But at last the
interpreter came, did he not, who was he ? ?
? What a hurry you nineteenth century people are always
in ! ? rejoined the speaker. Even the largos and adagios
of the great masters have to be hurried to suit your taste.
We shall come all in good time to the interpreter.?
? My maker, I afterwards found, was a very celebrated man,
pupil of Nicholas Amati, of Cremona, and whether my
patience had imparted to me a sweetness unshared by my com-
rades, or whether my many parts were better adapted to
each other than was usual, even in that famous workshop, I
know not, but, on the day when 1 was tried for the first
time, to me was awarded the highest place among all the
instruments of that season.
? Still can I vividly remember how I felt when my maker
took me up, and, first praising my shape, reached his hand for
the bow ; how dread lest he should be disappointed mingled


with the keen delight of expectation ; how my whole soul
gathered itself into one sense of hearing as I listened for the
sound of my own voice, freed for the first time.
? You mortals have many joys, but none, I think, like this.
To me it is perfect happiness, when through one who loves
me and whom I love, I speak to those who love to listen. At
such times I cannot tell whether the player controls me, or I
him, there seems a transfusion of soul between us. I tell him
things I heard and learned in a former existence.
Old summers in my memory glow; I hear the April-loosened Spring;
The secrets of the wind I sing ; and mingle with my mood
All that I dreamed when I stood in the murmurous pine wood.
Long ago.?
?Those are pretty lines,? I said. ? Did you or your master
compose them ? ?
? No ! ? said the Violin, ? someone read them out of a book
with 1 Lowell 1 on the cover.?
?Ah! then you should have said so,?I remarked,? Plagiarism
is a very bad thing.?
? Nonsense !? it replied, quite sharply. ? Literary people
say so, I believe, but musicians don?t mind. Did not Handel
transfer whole movements from other composer?s to his own
works without acknowledgment ? Musicians who are really
original don?t mind, but literary folk have so little originality
about them that they guard it jealously. As your poet,
Campbell, says:
4 I fear I have nothing original in me
Excepting original sin/ 99
Not feeling inclined for an argument, I remained silent.
But my interruption had broken the thread of its musings,
and I got no account of its first purchase.
? My earliest master,? it went on presently. ? had several
valuable violins, but of them all I soon became his favorite.


?He was a quiet, grave man, and an exquisite player. I
soon grew to love him, which was no wonder, for he lavished
on me every endearing name. Amongst other titles he
sometimes spoke of me as his second wife, which mystified
me greatly. His home and wife were the first I had ever
seen, and the lady seemed to me only a superior sort of
servant. She looked well to his household, mended his
clothes, and presided at meals ; but in all this I could trace
no analogy between her and myself. If he was long away
from me he always came back with fresh expressions of joy.
He would neglect rest, food, sleep, everything, for my company,
/was his friend and confidant, his delight and solace, part of
himself. She was something quite apart from us both,
to be treated kindly and courteously, but never confided in,
or made a companion of.
? Later, I saw what some wives were to their husbands,
and understood that it was the ideal, not the actual wife I
represented to him.
? I learned, too, that he had been left guardian to an old
friend?s only daughter, and, in his perplexity, had thought
the easiest way to fulfil the charge was to marry his ward ;
then, finding her display no aptitude for the performance of
music, he concluded she had no love for it, and, quietly
shutting her out of his world, lived his life and went on his
way as before.
? She had not courage or self-assertion to alter things, and
settled down to keep his home-life smooth and happy, that
he might live untroubled in the beautiful world she could not
enter. Often I watched her, and saw that though the soul
within her might be dumb it was not absent. I knew from
my own experience somewhat of her feelings, and longed
to be able to comfort her. Yet what could Ido ? She, like
me, needed the sympathetic human touch, or, peradventure.


the touch of one as far above humanity ?while in sympathy
with it ?as my master was above me.
? Well, I am lingering too long in this, my first home, only
?you will like to know ?she died before her husband, who
missed her sadly, and mourned her deeply?l wonder if she
knew that. Subsequently to his death, which occurred
many years later, I found myself after several changes, in the
possession of a strolling Italian who took me all over his
native land, to fairs, weddings, and the like. I did not always
enjoy the company, either human or musical, that he brought
me into, but the free, roving life was very pleasant. Some-
times, especially in spring, the chords of memory were set
vibrating very strongly, and when the tempest shrieked,
or, again, ? the south wind blew softly/ I lived over again the
days when I rocked in the breeze, or heard the forest voices
sing lullabies to me.
? The Italian finally gave me up to a priest, in payment for
masses to be said for the soul of his brother, a bandit.
?My new owner was pastor of a little village near the sea,
and was dearly loved by his flock. Often has he sat by his
door, in just such a twilight as this, playing solemn and
beautiful music, while from below the evening hymn of the
fishermen floated up, softened by distance, rising, falling,
dying away ??Ave Maria, ora pro nobis ! ? He would play on
till the red sun dropped into his ocean bed, and gradually
the sunset glow faded away from sea, and land, and sky ;
then the fireflies lent their lamps till the moon came out and
flooded everything with her soft, silvery light, and no sound
broke the stillness save the lapping of the waters on the sands
below, and the exquisite melodies he called forth from me
rising up to heaven like incense, bearing his prayers with them.
? The little room where I lay in the day-time ?when he
never touched me?was really his confessional, and how


many secrets I heard there. But they are safe with me.
However. I may say I learned there more of life?s conflicts,
griefs and trials, and also of its romances, tragedies, and even
comedies, than otherwise I should ever have known. I can
laugh and cry better ever since.
?In a hard winter the priest sold me to obtain food and
warmth for his people, and I saw him and the village by the
sea no more. Since then I have been in brilliant assemblages
and celebrated gatherings. In European capitals royalty
has listened to my strains, and many a time have I felt the
hand that held me tremble with the intoxication of high
hopes fulfilled, cherished dreams realised, as round after
round of applause rent the air, which a moment before had
vibrated only to my voice.
? I have lived too, in a garret, where, day after day, a thin
hand grasped me, and wrought patiently for weeks and
months to conquer the difficulties that lay between it and
fame.
? Talk of your great artists ! I could tell you of many just
as gifted who have perished, bravely climbing up the hill
? difficulty,? for want of a human hand or voice to aid or
sympathize.
? I played at the great ball in Brussels, from which so many
cf England?s brave sons went out to fight and fall at
Waterloo. After that, for a long time I played in York
Minster, and grew to love the cathedral and its services, and
the quiet life. But to this also the end came. The hand or
the player lost its cunning, and I was shut up for many years,
living my chequered past over again, and wondering what
the future held in store for me. At last gentle hands lifted
me into the air once more. I found myself in the possession
of the granddaughter of the cathedral musician, who wished
to give me to her son. My new master was an amateur


with considerable talent and plenty of capacity for hard work.
Ere long he became to me the dearest of all my many
owners. What pleasant evenings we spent together in that
happy English home, sometimes indoors, sometimes out on
the beautiful lawns in front of the house. Well, I must not
stay here too long. I saw him in the fatal uniform. I
heard them say he was gone to the Crimea, and immediately
after, it seemed to me, a shadow fell upon everything. The
rooms were darkened ; everyone wore black, and soon I knew
that another chapter in my life was ended.
? I shall only show you one more of my owners. I cannot
tell?for when not playing I take no account of time ?how
long had passed, when one day my late master?s mother put
me into the hands of a young lady I had never seen before,
saying, ? You must take this too ; he loved it very dearly and
would have liked you to have it.? Wondering greatly why
she should part with anything dear to her son, I looked at
my new mistress?-her face reminded me of lines T had
once heard?
f Beauty born of murmuring sound
Did pass into her face.?
? She was dressed in deep mourning, and wore, as her only
ornaments, a locket containing my master?s likeness, sur-
rounded with pearls, a pearl ring, and over that a mourning
ring, with letters engraved thereon. She took me to her
home when she returned, and I found to my surprise that she
could play me, and, also to my surprise, that I liked her to do
it. This was partly because she never brought disgrace upon
me by attempting too much, but also, and chiefly, because,
somehow, I felt nearer to my dead master when with her.
?Often I think of her standing, as she frequently did, at
twilight, just under a large portrait of him in his regimentals,
playing softly, perhaps ? I waited for the Lord,? or ?O, rest
in the Lord,? for she loved Mendelssohn ; and then when she


could play no longer, looking up to the likeness above her,
then away out to where the sunset hues were dying out of
the sky, and whispering in my mother tongue, partly to her-
self, partly as if she spoke it to another too ?Auf wieciersehen
(?Till we meet again.)?
BmiUa.
(Othello and Desdemona.)
THE character with which this paper is briefly to deal is
that of a waiting-woman, but it is not to be, on that
account, held in low estimation, or looked upon as
necessarily a subordinate one.
What romantic story of olden time is complete without
this part ?
What would the Greek or Roman lady of rank have done
without her favourite slave, often brought, by the fortunes
of war, from a station not inferior to that of her mistress,
into the slave market ?
And the high-born maiden
? In a palace tower"
of feudal times, how necessary to her happiness was her faith-
ful attendant and companion.
In those days, when an icy barrier of formality and
restraint rose up between parent and child, when women, or
at least women of rank, were denied that freedom of which
their sisters to-day claim and receive so large a share, we
cannot wonder that the waiting-maiden, often brought up
from childhood with her young mistress, should in many
cases become the confidant of those hopes and fears, likings
and antipathies, dreams and misgivings, which could be told
to no one else.


Her freedom from many of the trammels of etiquette by
which her mistress was bound made her doubly useful.
While the heiress sat enthroned as Queen of Beauty, look-
ing down from her lofty height at the tournament, the maid
could find her way to hall or courtyard, bearing her lady?s
token to her chosen knight ; or could, perhaps, elicit from
the page of some unknown Sir Launcelot, fighting miracu-
lously with his vizor down, the details craved by her mistress?
curiosity. Indeed, there was scarcely any limit to the service
to be rendered, and the influence for good or evil to be
exerted by a waiting-woman of the Middle Ages over her
lady?s life and fortune.
The honorable estimate in which the position was held is
shown by the fact that lago?who considered himself eligible
for the post Cassio obtained, and whose annoyance at being
passed over, combined apparently with an old jealousy of
Othello?s friendship for Emilia, urged him to his diabolical
scheme for wrecking the Moor?s happiness? yet seemed in
nowise offended at Othello?s off-hand request, made in court,
? 1 prithee, let thy wife attend on her.?
The writer of this paper, who has not read any criticism
of the characters in this play, has conscientiously tried to get
up a good opinion of Emilia, but in vain ; yet one cannot
regard her with that unmitigated hatred and loathing which
lago inspires.
Standing beside him, in his double-dyed blackness-of-soul
attire, her raiment appears?well, not more than dust-coloured
and travel ?stained.
Desdemona, on the other hand, makes a very white back-
ground to throw up the heroine of this paper.
Perhaps Emilia may be intended as a kind of foil for the
virtues and vices of the other chief actors in the drama.


She seems to belong to that very large class of people
whose characters are neither very good nor very bad, but
contain a considerable and often perplexing mixture of both
elements.
According to 'her husband, her powers of language were
not inconsiderable, and though ?honest lago v is not always
a creditable witness, we find ample proof of the truth of this
assertion in the course of the tragedy.
Only?if she were indeed an Italian edition of Xantippe,
Mrs. Poyser, or Mrs. Caudle?one can scarcely help ponder-
ing regretfully over A what might have been ? had she by a
judicious use of her one talent, exercised a wholesome and
restraining influence on her husband.
1 he manner of the pair toward each other would lead the
reader to imagine there was not much love lost between them.
lago?s taunts do not appear to sting his wife as they would
have done if she had cared much foi* him. She bears them
most philosophically. Witness her cool rejoinder, ?? Oh ! is
that all ? ? when he says?
? It is a common thing.
To have a foolish wife/?
Her opinion of her husband?s character is not a lofty one,
but her evident suspicion of his shortcomings is not to her
the poignant grief that it would be to a woman with a higher
moral standard, or to one whose love for her husband would
make her desire that he should be worthy of her respect.
A question might be raised as to whether cowardice was
one of Emilia?s faults, and the cause of her obedience to lago
in the matter of the handkerchief. If that were so she might
deserve some blame, but more pity.
But can we fairly come to such a conclusion ? Would a
woman who feared her husband speak so plainly to him ?
Rather it would seem that she was too inert, too mentally


lazy to resist ; that with the indolence characteristic of so
many Southern races, she yielded to her husband?s stronger
will, and obeyed his commands, less from love and desire to
please him, than from disinclination to go to the trouble of
thwarting him.
Her best trait is her evident love for Desdemona. Yet
even in it her selfishness appears. She will not expose herself
to blame even to save the latter from Othello?s wrath ; and
has the effrontery to point to his passionate words and
manner, of which she knows herself to be the cause, as
proofs of her own sagacity in declaring him jealous.
Her opinion of men and women in general is not a high
one, yet she seems quite content to put up with things as
they are, and not worry herself by lamenting that they are
not what they should be.
Perhaps had she cared more for lago, and taken greater
interest in his doings she might have suspected and prevented
at least some of his mischief, instead of, by her easy-going
indolence, helping it on.
Possibly it may be from selfish motives that she keeps the
peace so long. Perhaps she thinks ? Where ignorance is
bliss, ?tis folly to be wise,? and knowing that her fortunes are
bound up in his, lets him go on his way unquestioned, hoping
to reap the benefit of his schemes, without inquiring too
closely into his method of accomplishing them.
Yet prepared, as she doubtless is, for unscrupulous dealing
on lago?s part, the full revelation of his wickedness takes her
by surprise, and there can be no question as to the genuine-
ness of her grief and horror when she hears Othello?s story,
with no words but the reiterated ?My husband,? till his
angry rejoinder loosens her voluble tongue. Then love for
her dead mistress, passionate indignation against her master,


horror and contempt for her husband, mingled surely with
sharp self-reproach for her own share in the matter, open the
flood-gates of her wrath, and on and on her words flow,
breaking down the restrictions imposed by the presence of
strangers, and heedless of Othello?s and lago?s commands to
be silent, till at length her husband?s steel calls death to stop
the torrent, and speaking, as she thinks, ? Emilia dies.?
And so we leave her, by the side of her dead mistress, liking
her far better at the last than ever before, and regretting that
she, like so many of us, should have so long shut her eyes to
opportunities of doing good by preventing evil.
Memories of Cono Bap.
I am dreaming of thy beauty, oh, beloved Corio Bay,
Would that I could watch the sunbeams dance upon thy breast
to-day ;
Would that I again might wander, as I have in days of yore,
Halcyon days of happy memory, on thy sandy wave-washed
shore.
Not a summer-day that passes, but I long and yearn to be
Sitting on that verdant hillside, some loved book upon my
knee;
With a cloudless sky above me, while the soft winds come
and go,
And a wordless anthem rises from the rippling waves below.
Though ?mid other scenes I?m dwelling, yet my heart goes
back to thee,
Altho? other shores I visit, none seem fair as thine to me ;
Twined art thou with loving memories of my childhood?s
happy years
When the past held nought to grieve for, and the future
caused no fears


So I love to shut my eyes, and fancy I can see thee still,
Dream that I once more am gazing on that beach and tree-
decked hill ;
With the waters laughing gaily where the merry sunbeams fall,
While the mountains guard the background, and God?s blue
sky watcheth all.
?As a dream when one awaketh,? so my picture melts away,
Like a rainbow?s bright hues fading, changing into sober grey ;
So my lovely vision fadeth, but the yearning leaves me not,
?Mid those fairy scenes to wander, that may never be forgot.
H Sfcetcb of tbe Ibistorp of Sbortbanb.
AT the present time when Shorthand is receiving so much
public attention, when it is being introduced into our
schools, and the merits of rival systems are being so
eagerly explained by their respective champions ?a brief
sketch of its history may fittingly find place in an Australian
magazine.
That its birthplace was no less than the eternal city, Rome,
itself, there seems little need to doubt, although some claim
that Xenophon first took down notes of Socrates? addresses,
but the weight of evidence is on the Latin side.
As to the actual inventor of this form of swift writing,
Ennius, Moecenas and Cicero are all mentioned, but probably
the honor belongs to Tiro, the freedman of Cicero, who,
according to the custom of the times, was credited with that
which was really the work of his servant. This system, although
appearing, in the light of present day achievements, very
defective, was hailed with delight by the Romans, and
Cicero made considerable use of it for obtaining fuller reports
of the speeches in the senate. His plan was to place a num-
ber of notarii, or reporters, as we should call them, in different


parts of the building, and by a comparison of their respective
notes a tolerable idea of the speech could be obtained.
The whole of Cato?s oration relative to the Cataline con-
spiracy was secured in this manner.
Under the Empire, no less than the Republic, stenography
flourished. Augustus and Titus both used it, and Julius
Caesar wrote letters in it to his friends?a fact which seems to
point to its wide-spread adoption.
Many authors of the period refer to it, ?some in terms of
highly exaggerated praise, even asserting the power of short-
hand writers to anticipate an orator?s thoughts and write
them down ere he had expressed them. So much for poetic
license ! This much-praised system was based on abbrevia-
tions of the letters of the Roman alphabet, with the omission
of vowels and such consonants as were not absolutely
necessary, and the addition of some arbitrary signs.
In Nero?s reign no less a person than the philosopher,
Seneca, studied Tiro?s system, and added 5000 characters to
it. These he published, and the book became the standard
work of reference for these old-time reporters. In course of
time many additions were made to it by competent writers,
the last being Cyprian, the Christian Bishop of Carthage,
who added to the book a good deal relating to Scripture
names and Christian words.
The great Justinian was less liberal in his views than the
Christian Bishop, for he strongly objected to his Codex being
taken down in Shorthand ?and, in fact, forbade it. Strange
to say, Stenography seems to have eventually died out
among the Romans, and it was only after a prolonged and
diligent search that specimens of writing in this character
could be found in the fifteenth century, and even these were
looked upon with great suspicion as the work of magic.


The celebrated ??Notes? of Tiro and Seneca were, however,
rescued from oblivion, and copies made by Gruter about the
year 1600.
This book shows that Roman Stenographers made use of
over 12,000 characters.
In writing, one might consider they had the advantage
over modern reporters, for, as it will be remembered, they used
waxen tablets on which characters were easily and rapidly
traced with an iron pen, known as a stylus. These tablets
could be rubbed smooth after use, and were then ready to
receive fresh impressions. To this ease in obliteration we
probably owe the fact that celebrated speeches which we
know were thus reported have been lost to the world, with
one exception.
During the Middle Ages the art of Shorthand was practically
lost, and to England belongs the honour of reviving it, and
also of bringing it to a higher degree of perfection than any
other country.
In France attempts were made to introduce a system based
on the Roman, but as those who studied or practised it were
suspected and sometimes accused of witchcraft or magic, the
enthusiasm of its votaries was not sufficient to induce them
to brave torture or the stake for it, and it never flourished.
In more enlightened times, in the eighteenth century,
several systems were invented, and early in the nineteenth
the Academy of Science encouraged it by offering prizes.
In Germany Shorthand first appears in the year 1666,
and the two systems most in repute at present are those of
Gabelsberger and Stolze.
Crossing to England, we find Timothy Bright in 1588
publishing a work on Shorthand under the quaint title,
? Characterie.? Of this only the copy in the Bodleian Library


is now known to exist. It is dedicated to Oueen Elizabeth,
and in the preface the reader is informed that two months?
diligent study and practice will make him proficient in this art.
It is to be feared that the writer?s anxiety to push his
invention made-him over-sanguine concerning the abilities of
his readers, for though his system was exceedingly ingenious,
it was far too difficult, and imposed too great a strain on the
memory, to ever become popular or general. It is usually
stated that Bright?s system comprised only arbitrary
characters, but this is incorrect. It contained an alphabet,
which, however, was not used according to modern methods.
Like most inventors, Bright had followers and imitators,
but in 1602 an original thinker again appeared in the person
of John Willis. In his book an alphabet based on geometrical
forms is used, and he was the first of the modern school of
Shorthand.
From this time onward books and systems multiplied, and
as nearly every one coined a special name for his system, a
large number of curious and high-sounding titles might be
collected.
Some of the chief inventors were Mason, Taylor, Rich,
Byrom Tiffin (first phonetic stenographer), and others too
numerous to notice here, but of whom each contributed
something to the advancement of Shorthand.
No doubt the interest felt in theological and religious
questions during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries
largely accounts for the spread of stenography. The long
sermons preached by leading divines on the debated points of
those times were in this manner preserved by and for their
admirers. There is still extant a small notebook of 168 pages
written in Rich?s system, and containing five sermons by
Dr. Stillingfleet, three by Robert Chilcott, and one by each
of four other divines.


Yet, strange to say, this system was not applied to other
public meetings, parliamentary speeches, etc., till more than
a century later.
In Or. Johnson?s time, reports of debates were furnished
him b)'' William Guthrie and forwarded by the former to
The Gentleman's Magazine under the name of ? The Senate
of Lilliput.?
Johnson used to compose most of the speeches, and is said
to have made all the debaters use the Johnsonese English
with which Boswell's Life has familiarized us, and also to
have boasted that he took good care never to let the Whig
dogs get the best of the argument !
Not till 1780 do we find the stenographer in parliament,
and a corps of reporters organised by Mr. Perry of The
Morning Chronicle.
The present century has witnessed an enormous increase
in the number of Shorthand systems and students. In 1837
appeared Isaac Pitman?s system, known as Phonography,
which is the one most widely known and practised at present,
As its name implies, it professes to write phonetically. Its
extreme popularity is shown by the fact that by many the
term ?Phonography? is used indiscriminately for Shorthand
in general, though really it only applies to Pitman?s system.
Besides this, a recent discussion in an English magazine
revealed the fact that in the eyes of competent critics there
are at least ten other systems worthy of front rank extensively
practised, and each possessing, in the opinion of many
votaries, advantages superior to all others.
One thing which can hardly fail to strike any student of
the history of Stenography is the way in which the invention
or adaptation of a Shorthand system appears to develop a
man?s self-esteem, to use a mild term.


Since John Willis published in 1623 his corrected edition,
warranted by its author to be not only the first of its kind
but to outlast all others, down to the year 1885, scores of
systems have been given to the English world, and almost
without exception each is asserted by its author to outshine
all others, as the sun does the planets.
Side by side with this vein of ?shall we say conceit ??runs
one of sanguine belief in the powers of humanity ; for their
readers are generally promised that if they work well, this
particular system will be mastered in a few months? time.
As yet, no purely Australian system has been given to
the world. That is yet to come. Perhaps some day the
Parliament of Federated Australia may follow the example of
the Scandinavian Parliament and offer a prize for the best
system by an Australian. Can we doubt that, in the presence
of the successful production, Taylor?s, Gurney?s, Pitman?s,
Pocknell?s, Guest?s and all others, would have to hide their
diminished heads ?
No ! As countrymen and women of Searle and Spofforth,
of Madame Melba and Adda Knight, we have unbounded
faith in Australia?s ability to lead the world in yet another
department, if she tries. But we confess that we do look
forward with some slight degree of trepidation to the effect
on the inventor?s own character.
If the production of a new Shorthand system has such an
extraordinary result in the case of the modest and retiring
John Bull, what sort of a character can an Australian be
expected to evolve during the process ?

H ipoet.
What is a poet ? A man who holds
An angel?s harp, with the skill
To strike its chords with a master-hand,
Evoking music sublime and grand
From the sounding strings at will.
Harmonies wondrous, with power to pierce
The souls of the listening throng ;
Deep and majestic as ocean?s roar,
Thrilling each heart to its inmost core,
As the billows sweep along,
Melodies marvellous, fresh and sweet
As song of the nightingale ;
Falling on bleeding hearts like balm.
Leaving behind them a sense of calm, ?
Stilling the mourner?s wail.
What is a poet ? ?Tis one who bears
The nectar of Pciesie
In a golden chalice of glowing thought,
With many a language-jewel wrought,
Welling up ceaselessly.
Magical draughts from that cup he pours,
Cooling and comfort rife ;
Soothing the spirit, anguished-tossed,
Strengthening the failing faith, half lost
?Mid the buffettings of life.
What is a poet ? A soul on whom
God has bestowed the dower
Of uttering words that flame and glow,
And melt cold hearts by their lava flow
Of eloquent truth and power.
Words to ring out, like a battle shout,
In the glorious cause of right ;
To thrill men?s souls like an organ peal,
Till each their import and truth should feel
And yield to their force and might
Is not the poet a seer indeed ?
With soul-vision clear and keen ;


Reading, in one quick flash of the eye,
Many a sad life history,
Many a ? might have been.?
Looking beyond the ?outer court,?
Which others only see ;
To the ?.Holy of Holies,? the inner cel!
Where silent and still, doth the spirit dwell,
Alone with its mystery.
He hath looked, too, into nature?s heart,
And woven into his song,
The magical secrets that she will tell
To those alone who have loved her well,
And knelt at her shrine for long
C>
Others have taught to him sterner truths?
Spirits of graver mien?
Labour and sorrow?doubt and pain?
Loss that leads on to the highest gain?
These have his teachers been.
Then ?as he tells what his soul hath learned
From all it hath felt and known ;
The men who hear him are stirred to find
An answering thought in a stranger?s mind,
To the problems of their own.
A stranger ? Nay?but a brother he
In sympathy?s links fast bound
By a mighty Faith and a deathless Love
And a Hope as steadfast as heaven above
To all men the wide world round.
Forth from his vision tower he looks
Out on the coming days,
Till the mist-wove veil of Futurity
Is lifted, and wonders yet to be
Revealed to his earnest gaze.
Such a true poet, and who shall dare
To usurp that royal name ?
Or think?if perchance they own the power
To weave smooth rhymes in an idle hour
That title they too may claim ?

JUNIOR POEM.
By ? Xantippe? (Miss Alice M, Sampson, Kangaroo Flat.)
�n ?XTenupson.?
Softly as the moonlight hovered
O?er the poet's dying bed ?
Like a Heavenly benediction
Falling on that pillowed head.
Like an earnest of Heaven?s glory
Lighting up that noble face ?
Just as softly let our sorrows
Hover o?er his resting-place.
Let not grief by him forbidden
In our hearts for him have room,
Let no tears of farewell sadness
Fall upon that quiet tomb.
If for him our hearts should sorrow,
If for him our tears should flow,
?Twould disturb that quiet slumber
Softly being slept below.
Weep not ?all unmete is sorrow
Where his silent ashes lie,
Death hath no dominion o?er him
For the poet cannot die.
Through those eyes by death unshrouded
Coming ages still may look,
And with magic, borrowed vision
Read in nature?s mystic book.
Thus to all will be unfolded
Nature?s mysteries untold,
Thus to all men will be given
Hidden beauty to behold,
And to look on care and sorrow
With a spirit pure and calm,
Seeing in the seeming turmoil
Hidden workings of God?s arm.


In the moments when the creaking
Of life's myriad wheels is lulled,
Will the future ages, listening
With those ears by death undulled,
Catch the sounds of mystic music
Pealing clear and pure and strong,
Fragments of the heavenly anthem,
Snatches of the angels? song.
And that voice with all the sweetness,
All the strength of magic rhyme,
Shall be heard throughout the ages,
Echoing through the vaults of time,
Leading mankind one step God- ward,
Cheering spirits sorrow-fraught.
Stirring up the sluggish spirit
With unwonted noble thought.
Bring your wreaths of useless laurel,
I wine them on cold marble now,
For a crown of brighter beauty
Shines upon that lofty brow,
As with countless brother singers
With their harps around the throne,
Singeth he with wondrous sweetness
E?en to him before unknown.
