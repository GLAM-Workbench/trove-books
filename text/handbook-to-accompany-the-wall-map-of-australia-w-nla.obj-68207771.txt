REMARKS
TEACHING MAP-GEOGRAPHY.
AN
INSPECTOR OF SCHOOLS
Unskilful beginners in the art of teaching are very apt to make
three fundamental errors in their treatment of map-geography.
I. They do not distinguish between the two uses of a map?
Reference and Instruction; and, bewildered by the multitude
of names necessary for the former purpose, they fail to discern
those desirable for the latter. It is evident that every map
contains many geographical facts, of which we should master a
greater or a less number, according as we propose to ourselves a
higher or a lower standard of proficiency in the subject. But it
is also evident that most maps contain a tenfold greater number
of topographical facts, of purely special interest; facts useful
when planning an expedition, or tracing the operations of a
campaign: but facts with which otherwise it is not desirable to
burden the memory, and which are therefore unsuitable for
general instruction. As well attempt to make a boy a good
Greek scholar by setting him to read a Lexicon from beginning
to end, as try to teach him geography by giving him all the
names on the map to learn by heart.
11. They confound Ex amination and Instruction. In ascer-
taining within a limited time the proficiency of a class, an
examiner naturally tests their knowledge of all the bays, rivers,
towns, etc., of any given map, by one or two questions on each.
Next day, it is by no means rare to find the young teacher, in
imparting knowledge, jumping from a cape to a mountain, and


REMARKS ON TEACHING
perhaps, if he is very clever, taking a flying shot on his way at
all the sciences and ologies. He confounds the methods of
examination and instruction; forgetting how fatal to the acqui-
sition of knowledge is the varied and desultory procedure most
convenient for its test.
111. They reject the aid of the memory. This is only a
particular example of a very prevalent error of the times; dis-
gusted by the abuse of rote-learning, we neglect its legitimate
use. In the sciences, as grammar and arithmetic, we cannot
appeal too constantly to the intellect; but in branches of mere
knowledge, which are mainly collections of facts (and what else
are history and geography, except to the politician and the
cosmologist), Ave cannot too attentively study the laws of asso-
ciation, or too systematically avail ourselves of every aid Avliich
memory affords.
With a vieAV to assist young teachers in the correction of
these faults, I have compiled lists Avhich I think Avill he found
generally useful. Trom their comparatiA'e copiousness it might
at first sight appear that I attach an exaggerated importance to
the study of geography; Avhereas my chief object in offering
these suggestions is to economise, as much as possible, the time
devoted to the subject. The lists doubtless contain at least
twice as much as teachers generally consider it necessary to
imparl to their classes, but it must be remembered that the time
required for their acquisition is very much less than half that
usually expended on the study. I shall now proceed to describe
the lists with a minuteness which, while necessary for mere
beginners, will, I fear, appear ridiculous to experienced teachers.
To give a class a good knowledge of the map-geography of
any country, take the list, and let each boy repeat the first three
or four items, pointing out their position on the map with a rod
sufficiently long to prevent him getting so near as to be able to
read the printed names. When the whole class can do this with
rapidity and correctness, proceed to the next three or four items.
Then recapitulate the Avhole six, or eight, from the beginning.


In this manner let them go on, mastering a few additional
items, and repeating constantly from the beginning, till they
have thoroughly acquired say one-half, or one-third, or any
well defined division of the list. In the Map of Ireland, for
example, very suitable divisions would be :
First. Boundaries, etc., Capes, Islands, and Mountains .
Second. Bays, Lakes, and Rivers.
Third. Counties and Towns.
Every alternate lesson may now commence by each boy
rapidly running over the divisions already acquired. The re-
mainder of these alternate lessons, and the whole of the time on
the intermediate days, may be devoted xo the similar acquisition
of the next division of the list.
When the whole is learned (which will not be until every
pupil can run through the whole list, and point out the position
of each place, quite as rapidly and correctly as he could dis-
tinguish the letters of the alphabet), that map may be consigned
to a fortnightly or monthly repetition, and the geography of
another country taken up, or other subjects proceeded with.
Two cautions before I have done. Pointing on the wall
map should never be omitted. Without intelligent pointing
accompanying the repetition, the system would degenerate into
a mere mechanical parrot-like plan, as it is now very apt to be
considered hy those who do not try it.
Again, before the teacher is satisfied that his class have fully
mastered a map, he should test their knowledge of every part of
the list, as carefully as a miner would examine each link of the
chain to which he was about to commit himself.
In doing this, he will find that extra attention is needed as
he approaches the end of any division. To show how this may
best be met, let us take an example. Let us suppose the division
in question to consist of the Capes, Islands, and Mountains, of
any given map ; in all, say thirty items, which have been taken
by threes. Let us also suppose that the mental calibre of any
one boy required that each set of three should be repeated five
times before he could be said to know them. It is plain that
while the first set, in being ? learned,? will have been repeated


five times; in being ? rehearsed ? with the nine following sets,
it will have been repeated forty-five times; making a total of
fifty times that the boy will have said the first three items. On
the other hand, the last three items will have been said but
ten times; ?five times when being ?learned,? and other five
when being ? rehearsed ? with the nine preceding sets.
To correct this error, in proportion as the end of any division
is approached, each set should receive an increasing number of
repetitions.
A word in conclusion as to the amount of advantage afforded
by this system. Not very long ago I examined a youth of
fifteen, who for more than seven years had been receiving
lessons in geography, at the rate of three or four in the week.
Of his own country he knew the names of the counties, three
or four towns, two rivers, and one cape. Of the map of Europe,
he knew the capitals (because they had been taught from a
list), and a very few other facts. Of the map of the world he
had long ago forgotten the most meagre outlines; he did not
even know the relative positions of all the continents and
oceans. In fact, he knew about as much as a child of eight
years of age might well be taught in three lessons. Now, I
have not the slightest hesitation in affirming that upon my
plan, with the same expenditure of time, at the end of two
years, he could have answered two-thirds of the most difficult
paper upon map-geography ever proposed by the Civil Service
Commissioners; and at the end of seven years, if he chose to
spend so much time upon the subject, he would have been a
very respectable Gazetteer of the whole World.

Islands 10
AUSTRALIA, a colony of the B
Hemisphere, is bounded on the
British
Empire, situated in the Southern
l by the Arafura Sea and Torres
north
Strait, which separates it from New Guinea; on the east by the Pacific
Ocean, and on the west by the Indian Ocean. Its southern shores are
washed by the South Pacific Ocean, and by Bass Strait, which divides it
from Tasmania. It is the largest island on the surface of the earth, and
is from its vast size generally termed a continent. Its extreme points are?
on the N., Cape York, in 10� 40' S. lat.; on the S., Cape Wilson, in 39� 10'
S. lat.; on the W., Steep Point, in 113�8' E. long.; and on the E., Cape
Byron, in 153� 35' E. long.
Greatest breadth from N. to S., 1971 miles; greatest length from E. to
W., 2500. Area, 2,983,200 sq. miles. Pop, (1877), 2,503,217.
The earliest discovery of Australia has been attributed to the Portuguese in 1606.
About the same time parts of the N. eoast'were sighted by the Dutch. In 1619 and
1622 the W. and S.W. coasts were descried, but the E. shores remained unknown till
Captain Cook?s first voyage in 1770. He named the new territory New South Wales.
The first settlement was made here by the English, in 1788, at Botany Bay.
Queensland, originally a portion of New South Wales, was made an inde-
pendent colony in 1859; the remaining colonies were founded at the follow-
ing dates Tasmania, 1825; Western Australia, 1829; South Australia,
1836; and Victoria, 1851. The tract of country stretching north from the
26th parallel of S. lat. to the Indian Ocean, and known as ? Northern
Territory,? was ceded to South Australia in 1864.
Coasts.? The coast-line is estimated at about 13,000 miles. With the
exception of the Gulf of Carpentaria on the N. E., which penetrates inland
about 500 miles, and Spencer Gulf, and the Gulf of St. Yincent on the S.,


there are no inlets of importance. The E. coast is regular in outline, but
possesses some good natural harbours; the W. is steep and barren, indented
with bays and fringed with islets and rocks. The Great Barrier Beef, the
largest extent of coral in the world, stretches for about 1200 miles along
the N.E. coast, and renders the navigation of these seas extremely
dangerous.
Physical Features.?Australia differs in its physical features from all
other continents. It may be described, in a few words, as a vast interior
plain or basin, from which no water escapes to the ocean, surrounded by
an outer circle of higher land. The most elevated part of the continent is
a series of mountain ranges, rising close to the eastern coast, beginning in
Victoria as the Australian Alps, and dying out towards Cape York. Their
inner slopes descend gradually into extensive plains, or ? Downs,? through
which, in the south, flows the Murray, the largest river of the country. The
shores of the Gulf of Carpentaria are flat, but inland, from the south of it,
the downs of the east coast are continued in the fertile ? Plains of Promise. ?
The north-west margin has been only partially explored, but seems to rise,
at a distance of from 100 to 200 miles from the sea, in green and well-
watered terraces. To the south-west the mountains ascend at once from
the shores of the Indian Ocean, with an interior table-land of wide, grassy
plains, which degenerate inland into shallow salt lakes, swamps, and sandy
tracts. The Great Australian Bight, extending along the south coast from
Cape Arid to Spencer Gulf, is a riverless and desert region, rising from 300
to 600 feet above the sea. Beyond Spencer Gulf a long series of parallel
ridges, known as Flinders, Range, extends inwards for about 300 miles.
Since the beginning of this century numerous explorers have traversed this
continent in all directions, and a great part of it has been described, and,
notwithstanding the barren central region and want of navigable rivers,
large areas of land have been found suitable for settlement, and a wide
field is yet open for emigration.
Climate.?ln the large mass of land forming Australia, there is naturally
a great variety of climate, but, as a whole, the country is remarkably
healthy and adapted to Europeans, and the air is everywhere drier and
warmer than that of England. The extent of surface, lying in the Torrid
zone, gives to the north a tropical character, and subjects it to periodical
rains and a high temperature. The rest of the continent, situated in the
temperate zone, enjoys a mild and agreeable climate, but the rainfall
is uncertain, and the land is exposed to the extremes of withering droughts
and violent rains which inundate the plains. Oppressive, scorching winds,


blowing from the interior, are experienced on the coasts. They occur three
or four times each summer, and last from two to three days at a time.
Flora and Fauna.?The Flora of the country presents some peculiar
features. The trees are evergreen, with scanty foliage of a sombre hue,
and seldom grow in forests, but scattered as in a park. The various
species of Eucalyptidae (gum-trees) and Casuarinse (shea-oak) yield strong
and durable timber ; acacias and a variety of heaths are among the
indigenous shrubs, and in the north, palms and other tropical foliage
prevails. The native fruits are unimportant, but both European and
tropical grains, fruits, and vegetables have been readily naturalized.
The indigenous Fauna belongs, with few exceptions, to the order of
marsupial or pouched animals, the most characteristic of which are the
kangaroo, wombat, and opossum. The dingo, or wild dog, the ornitho-
rhynchus, or duck-bill, and many varieties of bats, rats, and mice are
peculiar to this continent. The emeu, parrot, cockatoo, falcon, black
swan, duck, etc., are among the many and beautiful varieties of birds ; the
surrounding seas are inhabited by the whale, shark, seal, turtle, and
various edible kinds of fish, and crocodiles 'are found in the northern
rivers. Reptiles are numerous, but present no marked peculiarities.
All the most useful European animals have been introduced, and have
multiplied largely. Recent attempts to colonize the rivers with salmon
and trout have met with only partial success.
Population.?The population of Australia was estimated in 1874 at
1,840,000. By far the larger proportion are of British descent, but there
are several colonies of Germans in South Australia, numbering altogether
about 10,000. Since the discovery of the goldfields the Chinese have
entered Australia in considerable numbers. No satisfactory estimate has
been formed of the aboriginals, but by the latest calculation they now
number only 55,000. They are allied to the Papuan race of negroes, and
rank very low in the scale of the human race. They practise polygamy,
and live in bark huts of the rudest construction. Philanthropic efforts on
their behalf have met with slight success, and the race is fast dying out
before the progress of colonization. In Tasmania it is now extinct.
Productions and Commerce. ?Wool, meat, and gold are the staple pro-
ductions of Australia. The latter was first discovered in New South
Wales in 1851, and has been found since in the other colonies. Wheat is
the chief agricultural product; cotton, tobacco, sugar, indigo, coffee,
rice, maize, etc., are cultivated in Queensland and New South Wales,
and the vine is raised in South Australia and Victoria. Mining gives


occupation to a great number. New South Wales has extensive coal fields,
and copper, iron, lead, manganese, antimony, quicksilver, etc., are found
abundantly in different parts of the continent, as well as precious stones.
The chief imports are?cotton and woollen manufactured goods, hard-
ware, machinery, glass, jewellery, clothing, stationery, and fermented
liquors. The exports?wool, tallow, and preserved meat, gold, and horses
for India.
Lines of railway connect all the colonies except West Australia, where a branch is
in course of formation. About 1500 miles are now in use, and extensions are con-
tinually being made. Telegraph wires also link the capitals together, and a line 200
miles in length was lately constructed across the continent to Port Darwin, by means
of which there is direct communication with the mother country. A submarine cable
is now being laid between New South Wales and New Zealand. 1
Peninsulas.?The chief are: York Peninsula, in the north of Queens-
land ; on the south coast, Yorke Peninsula, separating Spencer Gulf and
the Gulf of St. Yincent, and Syria Peninsula, forming the east side of
Spencer Gulf ; on the north coast, Coburg Peninsula, and on the south,
Wilson Promontory, the most southern point of Australia. Tasman Penin-
sula is on the south-west coast of Tasmania.
Capes.?North-east on Torres Strait, Cape York. On the east, or
Pacfic coast, going southwards? Cape Melville, Cape Flattery, Gape Tribula-
tion, Cape Palmerston; Sandy Cape, on the north of Sandy Island; Point
Danger; Cape Byron, the most easterly point of Australia ; Sugar Loaj
Point, and Cape Howe, on the south limit of New South Wales. On the
south coast? Cape Otway, with a lighthouse; Cape Nelson, Gape Northum-
berland, Gape Jervis, Cape Spencer, Cape Catastrophe, terminating the
Eyria Peninsula. Cape Adieu and Cape Arid, forming the east and west
extremities of the Great Australian Bight; Point D'Entrecasteaux and Gape
Leeuwin and Cape Naturaliste to the south-west. On the west? Cape
Inscription, the extremity of Dirk Hartog Island; North- West Cape, Gape
Leveque, Cape Bougainville, and Gape Londonderry on the north-west
coast. On the north? Gape Van Dieman on Melville Island, Cape
Wessel on Wessel Island, and Cape Arnhem to the east of Arnhem Land.
The most prominent capes in Tasmania are: Cape Grim in the north-west,
South- West Cape, Cape Pillar on Tasman Peninsula, and Cape Portland on
the north-east.
1 In 1793 eight merino sheep were introduced into Australia, which in 1861 had
multiplied to 17,000,000. The annual produce of wool is stated at 70,000,000 lbs., value
�5,000,000. The annual produce of gold is estimated at about �10,000,000, and of coper
at �5,000,000.


Gulfs, Bays, and Straits.?Australia resembles Africa in the regularity of
its outline, and is broken up by comparatively few inlets. Of these the
largest is the Gulf of Carpentaria, on the north coast, about 600 miles in
length and breadth. Torres Strait, which divides Australia from New
Guinea, is 90 miles across ; its coral reefs render navigation dangerous.
The east coast, though without any large inlet, has some good harbours.
Of those the chief are in Queensland ?Princess Charlotte Bay, which receives
the Kennedy river; Trinity Bay, Rockingham Bay, Halifax Bay, Upstart
Bay, Port Denison, Repulse Bay, Broad Sound ; Keppel Bay, receiving the
Fitzroy river ; Port Curtis; Hervey Bay, sheltered by Sandy Island ; and
Moreton Bay, protected by islands, and receiving the Brisbane and Swan
rivers. On the coast of New South Wales are : Shoal Bay; Trial Bay,
estuary of the Macleay river ; Port Macquarie, at the mouth of the Hastings
river; Port Stephens; Port Hunter, which receives the river of that name;
Broken Bay; Port Jackson, on which Sydney stands, one of the finest
natural harbours in the world, extending inland about 15 miles; and
Botany Bay, where the first penal settlement was founded in 1787; Bate-
man Bay, and Twofold Bay.
The chief Inlets of Victoria are : Corner Inlet, Port Western; Port
Phillip, with a lighthouse, a deep bay about 35 miles in length and
breadth ; on its west side is Geelong Harbour, and on its north, Hobson Bay,
serving as the Port of Melbourne.
Portland Bay, frequented by whaling vessels, Bass Strait, which
separates Tasmania from Australia, is 150 miles in width, and is studded
with coral reefs. The largest Inlet on the south coast is Spencer Gulf,
stretching inland for 200 miles, and containing Port Lincoln and Hard-
wicke Bay, The Gulf of St. Vincent also penetrates deeply inland, and
Encounter Bay has wide, barren shores. Investigator Strait separates
Kangaroo Island from Yorke Peninsula. To the west of the Great
Australian Bight lies King George Sound, a fine harbour in West Australia.
Giographe Bay and Shark Bay are also on the west coast.
The Bays on the north-west and north have been but little visited, the
chief are : King Sound, Admiralty Gulf, Cambridge Gulf, and Queen?s
Channel, into which the Victoria river flows. Bund as Strait leads into
Van Dieman Gulf; on the north of Coburg Peninsula is Port Essington,
and on the west side of the Gulf of Carpentaria are Arnhem Bay, Blue-
mud Bay, and Limmen Bight.
Tasmania abounds with fine bays and harbours. On the north are Port
Frederick and Port Dalrymple, which leads up to Launceston ; on the east
are Oyster Bay and Storm Bay, which gives Hobart Town, one of the finest


harbours in the world; and on the west are the fine openings of Port Davey
and Macquarie Harbour.
Islands.?Australia is possessed of a few large islands, and many groups
of small ones.
Melville Island, 80 miles in length, and Bathurst Island, 30 miles, are
on the north coast; Groote Eylandt, about 40 miles in extent, Sir Edward
Pellew Group, and Wellesley Group are in the Gulf of Carpentaria. Of the
many islands in Torres Strait, Prince of Wales Island and Banks Island
are the largest.
On the coast of Queensland are : Hinchinbrooke Island, the Cumberland
and Northumberland Islands, Curtis Island, Great Sandy Island, Morcton
Island, and Stradbroke Island.
In Bass Strait, to the north of the Island of Tasmania, are : the Fur-
neaux Group, the largest 46 miles long, and King Island. At the mouth
of St. Vincent Gulf is Kangaroo Island, about 100 miles in length. East
and west of the Great Australian Bight are the groups of Nuyts Archipelago
and Recherche Archipelago. Off the west coast are Dirk Hartog Island,
45 miles in length, and further north the Dampier Archipelago.
Rivers.?Compared with its vast extent, Australia is singularly de-
ficient in large and navigable rivers. Those on the east coast have short
courses, owing to the proximity to the shore of the range which forms the
main watershed. On the south coast, for a distance of 800 miles, not a
stream reaches the ocean. With the exception of the Murray, none of the
interior rivers flow into the sea, but are either evaporated, or terminate in
salt lakes and marshes. Of those that flow into the Gulf of Carpentaria
the chief are : the Roper, which has several branches, and is navigable for
some distance, and the Nicholson, Lexchardt, Flinders , and Norm.an, which
cross the Plains of Promise. The Gilbert and Mitchell enter the Gulf on the
east side.
Queensland is watered by many fine rivers, of which the principal are : the Burdekin,
850 miles in length, with two tributaries, which flows into Upstart Bay. The Fitzroy,
formed by the junction of the Dawson and Mackenzie, with a course of 420 miles, which
falls into Keppel Bay. It is navigable for 60 miles from its mouth. The Burnett falls
into Hervey Bay, and the Brisbane into Moreton Bay, and is navigable for 15 miles.
The other rivers of Queensland flow inland. Of these the Ballone or Condamine (350
miles) and the Warrego (460) are tributaries of the Murray.
The Cooper or Bareoo, with its tributary the Thompson, is received into Lake Eyre.
In New South Wales the rivers are short, rapid, and in general tortuous and subject
to great variation from frequent floods. In the north the Richmond rises in M'Pherson
Range, and forms a broad estuary at its mouth. The Clarence, formed by numerous
branches, and navigable for 70 miles, falls into Shoal Haven Bay. The Macleay enters
the sea at Trial Bay, and the Hastings at Port Macquarie. The Hunter rises in the


Liverpool Range, and flows south and south-east for 300 miles through a fertile district,
receiving numerous tributaries; navigable for 30 miles. The Hawkesbury is formed bj
the union of many affluents, and after a winding course of 300 miles, it enters the sea at
Broken Bay.
The Murray, the great river of Australia, rises on the west slopes of the Australian
Alps, flows north-west for about 800 miles, forming the boundary between New South
Wales and Victoria; entering South Australia it bends south, and expanding into Lake
Alexandria, enters the sea at Encounter Bay. Its mouth is shallow, but it is navigable
from Goolwa to Albury. Its total course is 1120 miles.
Its principal affluents are: the Darling, which Joins it in lat. 34 S.; it has a course of
about 1050 miles, and receives as tributaries the Kindur or Gwydir (450), the Peel (600),
the Castlereagh (365), the Macquarie (750), the Bogan (450), and the Warrego (460).
The next great branch of the Murray is the Lachlan or Colare, rising in the Blue
Mountains, and with a course of 700 miles.
The MurrumUdgee, also a large branch, joins the Lachlan in lat. 34� 20' S. Its total
course is 1300 miles, and it is navigable for 500.
The southern tributaries of the Murray all take their rise in Victoria; the chief are
the Loddon, Goulburn, and Ovens. The Avoca and WintVnera also flow north, but end in
lakes. Of the coast rivers in Victoria the largest is the Snowy river, 210 miles in length.
The Yarra Yarra enters the sea five miles below Melbourne. Gipps? Land is also
watered by the Mitchell, M'Allister, and Latrdbe.
Besides the lower course of the Murray, South Australia has the Cooper Creek and
Frome rivers falling into Lake Eyre.
The chief river of West Australia is the Swan or Avon, with a general north-west
course of 320 miles. Perth, the capital, is at its mouth. Further north is the Murchi-
son, with a south-west course of 800 miles; 'the Gascoyne, falling into Shark Bay; and the
Ashburton.
Flowing north-west to the Indian Ocean are the Fortesque (250), and the De Grev
(200).
In North Australia the Victoria enters the sea at Queen?s Channel after a course of
350 miles; it is navigable for 100 miles. The Adelaide and Alligator flow into Van Die-
man?s Gulf.
The principal rivers of Tasmania are the Derwent, which issues from Lake St. Clair,
and flows south-east to Storm Bay, receiving numerous tributaries; the Huon, falling
into D?Entrecasteaux Bay; the Gordon, into Macquarie Harbour; and the Tamar, formed
by the confluence of the North and South Esk with their tributaries, and which flows into
Bass Strait.
Lakes.?With the exception of the salt lakes and marshes of the south
and west, Australia is very deficient in lakes. In New South Wales, Lake
George is the most important. It is 2129 feet above the sea, is 25 miles
in length and 8 in breadth, and is hemmed in on all sides by high land.
It has no visible outlet, and its waters are saline. Other lakes in the same
colony are: Lake Cowal, near the Lachlan river; Lake Urana, in the
south, and Lakes Gawndilla and Victoria , near the Darling river
In Victoria are: on the north-west, Lake Hindmarsh and Lake Tyrrell;
on the south, Lake Corangamite, covering about 48,000 acres; it is ex-
tremely saline. Victoria Lake, on the east coast, is only divided by a
sand-bar from the sea.


South Australia has by far the largest lakes. Lake Torrens is a vast
inland lake or salt marsh, about 130 miles long and 15 broad, divided by
a neck of land from Spencer Gulf. North of it is Lake Eyre, of much
greater extent, and also saline; and to the east, Lake Frame and Lake
Gregory. To the west of Lake Torrens there is a group of marshy lakes,
the largest of which is Lake Gairdner. Lake Victoria or Alexandrina,
the embouchure of the Murray river, is a shallow sheet of water, 30 miles
by 15 in extent, communicating with the sea.
Salt lakes are also abundant in West Australia. The largest are -ALake
Austin, 75 miles by 15, Lake Moore, and Lake Cow-Cowing. More recently
Lake Barlee, Lake Mongor, and Lake Lefroy have been discovered. They
are salt, and are sometimes dry.
Mountains. ?The principal mountain range of Australia is the Eastern
Cordillera, or Dividing Kange, a nearly continuous chain running parallel
with the east coast, at an average distance from it of from 60 to 150 miles.
The highest portion of the range is the Warragon or Australian Alps, in
the south, where Mount Kosciusko, the culminating point of the continent,
rises to the height of 7176 feet, and Mount Hotham to 6414 feet. The
central portion of the range near Sydney, named the Blue Mountains, is
rugged and precipitous, and averages 3000 feet in height. Further to the
north is the New England Eange, culminating in Ben Lomond, 5000 feet
high. The Gourock Range constitutes the southern portion of the chain.
Transverse to the main chain runs the Liverpool Range, a chain of rugged
heights of from 3000 to 4000 feet in elevation, and crossed by the noted
Pandora Pass and Murrurundi Gap. Other lateral branches are the
M?Pherson Range, here forming the boundary between Queensland and
New South Wales, and the Denham Range, in Queensland. The Barrier,
or Stanley Range, and the Grey Range, are isolated ranges in the west of
New South Wales.
In Victoria are the Pyrennees, with the Grampian Mountains, where Mount William
rises to 4500 feet. In South Australia is Flinders Range, running north, and rising in
Mount Serle to 3000 feet; Stuart Range, north-west of Lake Torrens, and Gawler Range,
south of Lake Gairdner. In West Australia is the Darling Range, skirting the coast
from C. Leeuwin to the Murchison river. Highest peak. Mount William, 3600 feet.
No active volcanoes exist in Australia, but there are evidences of extinct ones in the
ranges of Victoria. Mount Wingan, in the Liverpool Range, is not a volcano, but a
bituminous hill, emitting great heat and sulphurous vapours. Tasmania is a high
table-land, sloping on all sides to the coast, with bold mountain ranges on the outer
edge, reaching an elevation of from 4000 to 5000 feet. The culminating peak of the
island is Mount Humboldt, on the western side which is 5520 feet above the sea. Ben
Lomond, on the north-east, is 5019 feet in height.


COLONIES AND TOWNS.
NEW SOUTH WALES.
The five colonies of Australia have been subdivided into counties ; but
a more usual and simple arrangement adopted is that of Pastoral Districts,
each embracing a large extent of country.
New South Wales contains 118 counties and 13 such districts, as follows Albert, in the
north-west, with an area of 60,000 square miles; Warrego, to the east of it, 10,000;
Clarence, in the north-east, 5000; Macleay, on the north-east coast, 3180; New England,
on the north table-land, 13,000; Bligh, near the Macquarie river, 7800; Liverpool Plains,
a rich pastoral district, 16,910; Gwydir, north of it, 11,075; WeUington, to the north-
west, 16,695; Mumunbldgee, to the south-west, 26,897; Lachlan, north of it, 22,800;
Darling, at the south-west extremity, 50,000; and Monaro, a high table-land near the
south-east coast, 8335.
Eiverina is the name given to the country between the Murray and Lachlan rivers, a
fine pastoral district. New South Wales originally gave its name to a very wide extent
of country, but was limited by the erection of Queensland and Victoria into separate
colonies. Its present boundaries are : north, the M'Pherson Range, Dumaresq and
M?lntyre rivers, and the 2 9th parallel of S. lat. dividing it from Queensland; south, the
river Murray cuts it off from Victoria; on the east is the Pacific ; and on the west the
141 st meridian divides it from South Australia. Area, 323,437 square miles. Pop.
(1877), 662,212. The Dividing Range separates it into two unequal parts, a narrow belt
on the east, and extensive plains on the west. The climate varies according to locality,
but is extreme!ysalubrious,and the atmosphere is generally characterized by great light-
ness and purity. The staple products are; wool, gold, timber, hides, and tallow; meat
preserving is a great industry, and sheep, cattle, and horses are extensively reared. The
agricultural products include maize, the most productive crop, wheat, barley, oats, rye,
hay, potatoes, cotton, tobacco, and sugar and ride are successfully grown on the lowlands
by the coast. Considerable attention is also given to the cultivation of the vine, and
the wines of the Murray district are now well known in the colony.
Seri-culture is also practised, and silk may soon become an article of export.
All European fruits are reared, and the orange-groves round Sydney are very fertile.
The mineral resources of the colony are abundant. Gold is found in many parts, and
mining is now carried on as a settled industry. New leads are frequently discovered.
Silver and lead are found in parts, but are not much worked. Copper, iron, and tin
especially are in great abundance. The coal measures are extensive, and promise to
become a source of great wealth.
Manufactures are now progressing, and include woollen mills, shipbuilding, and iron-
foundry work. The value of its imports for 1873 was �11,088,388, and of the exports,
�11,815,829.
New South Wales is self-governed, having a Governor appointed by the Queen, acting
through a responsible Ministry. The two Houses of Parliament consist of a Legislative
Council or Upper Chamber, composed of 21 members nominated by the Crown, and of
a House of Assembly, consisting of 72 members elected by ballot.
Education is supplied by means of numerous primary schools throughout the colony,
supplemented by grants from the State, with the grammar schools and university of
Sydney, founded and supported by State aid.


TOWNS.
Sydney, the capital, is beautifully situated on the south shore of the flue harbour of
Port Jackson, 5 miles from the entrance. It has a handsome appearance, and contains
several fine public buildings, including the University, Roman Catholic Cathedral, Post-
Office, Government House, Museum, etc. Sydney is the oldest town in Australia, being
founded in 1778, but modem improvements are fast removing the older portions. It
has an extensive foreign and inland trade, and gives employment to a large fleet of
steamers and coasting vessels. Pop. with suburbs, 134,758.
Paramatta, the next oldest town, is 14 miles west of Sydney, and communicates with
it by means of steamer and rail; the district is chiefly devoted to the growth of fruit,
and its orangeries and orchards are widely celebrated. Pop. with suburbs, 11,560.
Newcastle, at the mouth of the Hunter, is the chief shipping port of the north coast,
and exports vast quantities of coal, averaging 1,000,000 tons annually. The land all
round is under cultivation, maize being the chief crop. Pop. about 10,000.
Maitland is also on the Hunter river, and to this it owes its productive soil and
abundant grain crops and vineyards, the latter yield 10,000 gallons of wine annually.
Pop. 12,364.
Singleton, 30 miles north of Maitland, is well laid out, and has a large trade with the
surrounding district.
Grafton, North and South, is situated on both sides of the Clarence, 55 miles from its
mouth, and is a steadily rising place. The gold fields of the Upper Clarence, and the
rich agricultural land, chiefly devoted to the growth of sugar-cane, are the sources of its
wealth. Pop. with suburbs, 3456.
Windsor, north-west of Sydney, and Liverpool, south of it, are two of the oldest
settled places in the colony.
Bathurst, on the south bank of the Macquarie, is the chief town of the western dis-
trict, 122 miles west from Sydney, and is increasing in importance. Mining is exten-
sively carried on in the surrounding district, where gold and copper are worked. Pop.,
city and vicinity, 5030.
Goulbum, 128 miles south-west of Sydney, is also in the gold district, and has copper
mines near it, but its prosperity chiefly depends on the cultivation of cereals. It is
connected with Sydney by rail. Pop. 4453.
Kcton is about halfway between Goulburn and Sydney.
Wollongong, on the east coast, 64 miles south of Sydney, has an important trade in
coal and Kerosine oil. The district is noted for dairy produce.
Braidwood, 186 miles south-west of Sydney, is the chief town of the south gold field
district, and is a thriving place.
Albury, on the Murray, is a flourishing town. Quartz mining is carried on in the
district, and tobacco and vines are largely grown. The wines from the latter are
well known. The Murray is navigable up to Albury by steamers. Pop. 3000.
Deniliqain is the capital of the Riverina district, 448 miles south-west of Sydney.
The surrounding country is entirely pastoral.
Hay, on the Murrumbidgee, is also on the Riverina, and has a fine iron bridge
over the river.
VICTORIA,
Victoria, which originally formed a portion of New South Wales under
the name of Port Phillip, became a separate colony in 1851, when it
received the name it now bears. Although almost the smallest of the
Australian group, it is the most important, and, with the exception of India,


ranks before all other British Colonies. It occupies the south-east corner
of Australia, having New South Wales to the north and east, South
Australia to the west, and Bass Strait for its southern boundary. It is
divided into 4 districts and 37 counties.
The Districts are : the Murray, in the north-east, a mountainous but
well-watered country; Wimmera, occupying the whole of the north-west of
the colony, with an area of 25,000 sq. miles; the Loddon or North Central
district, fertile and pastoral; and Gipps? Land to the south-east, rugged and
mountainous, but with large tracts of productive land. The area is
88,198 sq. miles, and the population in 1877, 867,634, including Germans
and Chinese, who form about one-tenth of the whole. The native popula-
tion in 1871 was estimated at 1330, ?
The climate is on the whole healthful and agreeable, except for the hot
north winds blowing from the interior. Snow falls during an unusually
severe winter, but rarely lies. The chief pursuits of the colonists are
sheep-farming, agriculture, and gold-mining. The latest return (1875)
gives the number of sheep as 11,221,036, and cattle, 958,658. Agriculture
is rapidly extending, and embraces an immense variety of crops. Every-
thing which grows in England flourishes in Victoria, but wheat and oats
are the cereals most cultivated. The tobacco culture is increasing, and
hemp, hops, chicory, sugar, etc,, have been tried with success. The growth
of the vine is now general, and seri-culture promises well, the climate
being suited to the mulberry.
The mineral resources of Victoria are remarkable for wealth and variety, and mining
is now one of the great industries of the colony.
Gold was first discovered in 1851, when the colony was flooded with emigrants from
all parts of the world. It is now divided into' 7 mining districts. The total amount of
gold exported from the discovery to December 1874 was 44,414,177 oz., value,
�177,821,125. Silver, lead, antimony, tin, coal, and precious stones are found in paying
quantities.
Manufactures are encouraged by Government, and include the making of steam-
engines, and agricultural implements, brewing, [ distilling, tanning, spinning, paper-
making, etc. The value of the imports for 1874 was �16,953,985, and of the exports,
�15,441,109. Self-government was conceded to Victoria in 1855. The Governor is
nominated by the Crown, and acts along with an Executive Council and two Houses of
Legislature, the two latter composed of 30 and 78 members. Since 1873 a system of
national education has been in force, and the instruction given in State schools is free,
secular, and compulsory. The total number of schools in that year was 1936.
TOWNS.
Melbourne, the capital and seat of Government, stands on the north bank of the Yarra
Yarra, not far from its outlet. It is the largest and most important city of Australia;
its streets are wide and regular, and its public buildings, including the Parliament
House, Treasury, Post-Office, University, Mint, Custom House, etc., are handsome and
substantial.


Sandrldge, 2J miles distant on Hobson Bay, is the port of Melbourne, and is connected
with it by road and rail. The Yarra Yarra is also navigable up to Melbourne. Churches,
charitable institutions, and places of amusement are very numerous, and manufactures
are now extensively carried on. Several lines of rail connect the capital with north
and south. Pop. nearly 200,000.
Geelong is 45 miles south-west of Melbourne, situated on an arm of Port Philip, and is
a place of large shipping trade. The first woollen mill in Victoria was established here,
and has been followed by others; meat preserving and tanning are also important
industries. Pop. 23,200.
The other ports west of Melbourne are: Warnambool, 175 miles south-west, with a
large export trade; Belfast, 186 miles to the south-west; and Portland, 255 miles distant
from Melbourne, with a very large trade from the great agricultural and pastoral district
round it. A railway is being constructed, which will place it in direct communication
with the capital.
Ballarat, Bast and West, the leading gold field town, is 96 miles north-west of Melbourne,
and next to it in size and importance. Gold was first discovered here in 1851, and is
still unrivalled for quality. In 1875, 10,075 miners were employed. In addition to
mining and manufactures, farming and sheep-breeding are carried on in the district.
Pop., including a large number of Chinese, 47,156.
Kilmore, on the railway, 39 miles north-east of Melbourne, is a thriving town, situated
in the midst of a wheat-growing district.
Castlemaine, north-west of it, 77 miles from Melbourne, important in the early days of
gold, is still a scene of mining activity, and gives occupation to 6790 miners. Pop. 7308.
Sandhurst or Bendigo, 100 miles north-west of Melbourne, stands in a richly auriferous
country of quartz ranges. Mining operations extend over 141 square miles, and give
employment to 7263 miners. The town is well built, and supplied with all modern
improvements, and has numerous industries.
Echnca, at the junction of the Murray and Campaspe, is a thriving and increasing
town, with a large river trade. Wheat and vines are grown in the neighbourhood, and
the red-gum timber is an important article of commerce.
Ararat, 152 miles south-east of Melbourne, is the commercial centre of a great grain
and wool-producing district, and has famous quartz and alluvial mines. It has a large
trade in timber, and wine-making is now an established industry. Pop. 4000, and of
miners, 3321.
Hamilton, south-west of it, is the chief town in the western district; the land round
it is principally pastoral. Pop. 4000.
Sale, on the Thompson, 140 miles south-east of Melbourne, is the most important
town in Gipps? Land. The population of 3000 are chiefly occupied in agriculture and
mining.
Port Albert, south-west of Sale, is a seaport, and has steamers plying to Melbourne.
Beechworth, 185 miles north-east of Melbourne, is the chief town of the Ovens gold
fields, and is an important and thriving place. The district produces grain and wine,
besides employing 6000 miners. Pop. 3167.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The colony of South Australia was founded in 1836, and originally
comprised the portion lying between the Southern Ocean and the 26th
parallel of S. lat. In 1861 a strip of territoiy, known as ?No Man?s
Land/? between 129� and 132, � was added, and in 1863 the vast region
extending to the north coast, named North Territory, was ceded to South


Australia. It thus includes the entire centre of the continent between
the Southern and Indian Oceans, and the 129 th and 141rf degrees of E.
long. The settled portion of the colony is divided into 23 counties and
6 pastoral districts? Western, Northern, North-Eastern, South-Eastern,
Yorke Peninsula, and Kangaroo Land. Total area, 903,690 sq. miles.
Pop. in 1877, 225,677. Excepting German, the foreign element in South
Australia is small. By a late census there were in the settled district
3369 aborigines. So large a country has naturally a great diversity of
physical features and climates. Dryness is the great characteristic of the
climate, and the hot winds and dust storms render the three summer months
very trying, but for the remainder of the year the climate is genial,
pleasant, and healthy. The north portion of the colony enjoys an abundant
rainfall, and fertile soil, suited to tropical productions of all kinds.
The central region lately opened up has been found well adapted to
pastoral purposes; and in the productive south, wheat, the vine, and olive
flourish; and the mulberry, flax, and hops are cultivated with success.
In 1874 there were 6,120,211 sheep and 185,342 cattle in the colony, and
the wheat crop was valued at �2,219,103.
The mineral resources consist of large deposits of copper, iron of fine quality, lead,
bismuth, silver, and gold in small quantities, precious stones, etc. Marble and slate quarries
are worked, and brick-yards are in operation, and manufacturing industry ingeneral is in
a very flourishing condition.
The value of the imports in 1875 was �4,200,000, and exports, �4,800,000.
The legislative power, as in the other colonies, is vested in a Parliament of two
Houses, and the Executive in a Governor appointed by the Crown. By a recent Act
public education is now undertaken by Government, and its management placed in the
hands of a Council of Education. It is secular, free to those who cannot pay a small
fee. and compulsory. The total number of schools in 1874 was 320.
TOWNS.
Adelaide, the capital, is situated on both sides of the river Torrens, about 7 miles from
the Gulf of St. Vincent. It is built in the form of a square, the stream dividing it into
two portions. North and South Adelaide. The public buildings are numerous, and com-
prise the Government House and Offices, the House of Legislature, Court Houses
Institute, an Episcopal Cathedral in the course of erection, and numerous other edifices!
Round the city is a public demesne called the Parklands, and there is also a fine
Botanic Garden. The Mount Lofty range is about 5 miles distant. Pop. 30,000.
Port Adelaide, as its name implies, is the seaport of the city, with which a line of rail
connects it. It has sheltered and good shipping accommodation, and has a fine light-
house at the entrance to the Gulf.
Glenelg, 6 miles south of Adelaide is a favourite watering-place. The P. and O. Com-
pany?s steamers call at it for the embarking and landing of the South Australian Mails.
Gawler, 24 miles north of Adelaide, is the prosperous centre of a great wheat-growing
district, the neighbouring ranges yield silver, copper, lead, and gold, and several
mining companies have been started. Pop. 1652.
Kapunda, 48 miles north-east of Adelaide is a mining township, the copper mines


near it being famous. They were discovered in 1843, and still yield large returns. A
new and rich mine has recently been opened. Pop. 2273.
Koorlnga, on the Burra Creek, 50 miles north from Kapunda, has the noted Burra
Burra copper mine in its immediate vicinity. It yields on an average 2500 tons of pure
copper yearly, value, �200,000, and employs about 1000 miners; north of the town large
tracts are under cultivation.
Wallaroo, near the shores of Spencer Gulf, 91 miles north of Adelaide, has also
valuable copper mines. Smelting is carried on on a large scale.
Kadina, and Moonta south of it, also owe their prosperity to their copper mines, which
are of great value, and give employment to large numbers. The supply promises to last
for many years, and fresh discoveries are constantly being made. The population of
Kapunda is 4000, and of Moonta, 5000. The proximity of all three places to Spencer Gulf
affords great shipping facilities.
Port Augusta, at the head of Spencer Gulf, has a considerable export trade in wool,
hides, tallow, and copper ore.
Goolwa, on the Murray, 7 miles from its mouth, has a river trade, which would be
largely increased but for the dangerous and shifting channels at the Murray mouth,
which render navigation difficult, and full of risk.
Port Elliot, and Victor Harbour are connected with it by an iron tramway.
Kingston, 169 miles south-east of Adelaide, has a safe and commodious harbour.
Robe Town, south-west of it, is also a seaport, and is picturesquely situated. It has
a fine jetty, and good anchorage in the bay.
Naracoorte, north-east of Robe, is a thriving place in the midst of a pastoral district
Pop. 1500.
Palmerston is the capital of the new settlement in Nothern Territory, and is on the
north side of Port Darwin. It is the headquarters of the overland telegraph officials,
and is fast increasing in size. The harbour is spacious, and has anchorage for the largest
vessels. In order to encourage trade. Port Darwin has been made a free port.
South Port, about 24 miles south of Palmerston, is the chief inland dep6t for landing
goods for the gold fields, which are now known to be very abundant and extensive in
North Territory. A number of stations have been formed along the line of telegraph
for its maintenance.
WEST AUSTRALIA.
The colony of West Austalia, formerly known as Swan River Settlement,
was formed in 1829, and embraces the whole of the continent west of the
129 th. meridian. It is bounded on the north, south, and west by the sea.
The occupied portion lies between the Murchison River on the north, and
King George Sound on the south, but settlements are now being formed
further north. In 1849, at the request of the colonists, West Australia
was made a convict settlement, and received a great impetus in con-
sequence of the increased traffic and large money circulation, but in 1868,
on the petition of the other colonies, transportation was discontinued.
The area is 1,057,250 square miles, and the population (1877) 27,876.
Though the coast-line has been more or less explored, much of the interior
remains unknown. The climate of the known portion is admitted to be
one of the best and healthiest in the world, the heat being free from


moisture, and tempered by cool breezes. The wet season begins in April,
and lasts till September, but the periodic droughts and floods of the other
colonies are unknown. Climate and soil are well adapted to the growth
of wheat and vines, and the amount of wine made in the colony is yearly
increasing. It is expected that sugar can be cultivated in the north.
Timber of a durable nature is abundant, and sandal-wood forms a valuable
export. The pearl fisheries of the north-west increase yearly in value, the
take of the season in 1874 being estimated at �74,162. Tortoise-shell is
also exported.
Fine pasture land is not wanting, buc the vast central desert renders the area
limited. The number of sheep in 1874 was 777,861, and of cattle, 47,637. A trade in
horses has lately sprung up with India, which promises success. The mineral re-
sources have not yet been fully developed; but gold, silver, iron, and zinc have been
found, and copper and lead exist in large quantities. Communication is kept up by
means of steamers recently introduced; no railways at present exist, but two are about
to be constructed. In 1874 the imports were valued at �364,262, and the exports at
�428,836. The administration of the colony is under a Governor, aided by an
Executive Council; there is also a Legislative Council, consisting of 18 members.
State aid is granted to religion and to private schools under Government inspection.
Public schools are maintained at the cost of the colony, and are under the control of a
Board of Education.
TOWNS.
Perth, the capital, is pleasantly situated on the left bank of the Swan river. The
chief building is the Town Hall, built by convict labour. There are also handsome
Government Offices and two Cathedrals, etc. Population, not including convicts, 6000.
Freemantle, the Port of Perth, is 12 miles south of it, and communicates with it by
means of a fine high road, the work of the convicts, of whom there are 300 in the
establishment. The harbour is not good, but its improvement is contemplated. There
is also a penal establishment on Rottnest Island, 14 miles west of Freemantle.
York, 60 miles east of Perth, is a thriving place. The chief supply of sandal-wood
comes from the district round it. Pop. 2566.
Bunbnry, 112 miles south-west of Perth, is the chief port of the west, and has a con-
siderable trade in timber, sandal-wood, and horses.
Albany, 261 miles south-east of Perth, is on the shore of Princess Royal Harbour, a
line and well-sheltered bay, and is a depot of the P. and O. Company?s steamers.
Mining is carried on in the vicinity.
Qeraldton, on Champion Bay, is the chief port of the north. It has a good harbour,
and exports wool, copper and lead from the mines near it.
QUEENSLAND.
Queensland occupies the north-east portion of Australia, and was
formerly known as Moreton Bay district, being thus named by Captain
Cook. Its first settlement took place at Brisbane, as a penal outpost of
New South Wales, but in 1842 convict immigration was discontinued,
and in 1859 it was detached from New South Wales, and erected into an
independent colony.


It is bounded on the north by the Gulf of Carpentaria and Torres
Strait, on the east by the Pacific Ocean, south by New South Wales, and
west by South Australia, Area, 669,520 sq. miles, and population (1877),
195,092. Queensland is divided into 12 large districts. On the east, or
Pacific side, are Moreton, area, 7700 sq. miles; Burnett, 7050; Port Curtis,
14,000; Leichardt; Kennedy, 10,200; and East Cook. Burke is by the
Gulf of Carpentaria ; area, 7000. Gregory and Mitchell are the western
plains, and Warrego, Maranoa, and Darling Downs, 6000, the richest
pasture land of the colony, lie to the south-west.
The climate has been compared to that of Madeira. The heat,
especially in the north, is great, but the air is dry and elastic, and malaria
is unknown. The winter season, without frost or snow, is genial and
exhilarating.
Soil and climate unite in the production of almost everything that can
be grown in any part of the world : bananas, arrowroot, pine-apples,
ginger, tobacco, sago, coffee, vines, etc., grow in abundance. Wheat
succeeds well, but maize is the chief crop. Flax is also successfully
grown, and opium, dates, vanilla, rice, etc., may soon become exports.
Great progress has been made of late in the cultivation of cotton, and the
growth of sugar-cane is also rapidly extending.
Queensland is also a great pastoral country; the finest sheep stations in Australia
are found on the rich Darling Downs, and horses and cattle are profitably reared on the
hotter plains within the tropics. Cattle runs have risen much in price since the meat
preserving industry became general. In 1873 the returns were: 7,268,946 sheep and
1,343,093 cattle in the colony.
Mining prospects are very hopeful. The chief seat of gold is in the north, but there
are diggings in the central and southern districts also. Copper and coal are the other
chief mineral products, and of late years tin has been discovered in great quantities.
Precious stones, such as diamonds and sapphires, are found, and the pearl fisheries of the
north are now attracting much attention, and promise success.
Manufactures and mills are encouraged by State bonuses, and are making good pro-
gress. The chief articles of export are wool, tallow, gold, copper, cotton, hides, livestock,
and timber. Their value in 1874 was �3,542,513, and that of the Imports, �2,833,814.
Queensland is governed on the same principle as the other Australian colonies. An
excellent system of free, primary education is u operation, and State aid is granted to
higher class schools. In 1873 there were 163 schools, and 15 schools of art throughout
the colony.
TOWNS.
Brisbane, the capital, stands on the Brisbane river, 25 miles from its outlet in
Moreton Bay. It is divided into two portions. North and South, which are connected
by the Victoria Bridge, a fine iron structure. The Houses of Legislature, Post-Office,
and other handsome buildings, adorn the town. The wharf is very commodious, but a
bar at the mouth of the river prevents vessels of large tonnage from entering the port.
Brisbane is now the terminus of several lines of railway. Pop. (1871), 19,413.
Ipswich on the Bremner, 25 miles south-west of Brisbane, is a thriving and important


town. Cotton, maize, and sugar-cane are largely cultivated in the district. A railway
to Brisbane was opened in 1875. Pop. 6000.
Maryborough, on the Mary, 180 miles north of Brisbane, has a thriving export trade
from the Burnett district. There are large sugar plantations in the vicinity, which give
employment to twelve sugar factories.
Rockhampton, on the Fitzroy, 45 miles from its mouth, ranks next in importance to
Brisbane, and is a well-planned city with substantial buildings. It is the shipping port
for a large extent of country. The gold and copper mines near it, and the fine grazing
land round it, add much to its trade. Pop. 5497. Bowen, at the mouth of the Bur-
dekin, 725 miles north-west of Brisbane, and Townsville, on Cleveland Bay, are shipping
ports. Cotton and sugar-cane are cultivated in the districts round them.
Cardwell, on Rockingham Bay, has a fine harbour, and is the terminus of a line of
telegraph carried across the colony to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Norman Town, at the
other extremity of the line, is a newly-formed settlement on the Norman river.
The principal mining townships are: Cooktown, on the Endeavour river, 1050 miles
north-west of Brisbane, a newly-risen and increasing place in an important gold centre;
Normanby, 45 miles south-west of Cooktown, and Palmer, on the river of that name, 136
miles west of Cooktown, are newly-discovered gold fields of much promise. In 1875 the
latter had attracted 4000 Europeans, and 10,000 Chinese.
Ollberton, on the Gilbert, 290 miles north-west of Townsville, is rich in quartz reefs,
which are being steadily worked.
Bavenawood, 770 miles north-west of Brisbane, has valuable quartz reefs. Copper
and galena are also found. Clermont, 240 miles north-west of Rockhampton, has the
famous Peak Down copper mines close to it; gold is also found in the district. Fyfe-
Barnett, in Bowen county, 110 miles from Maryborough, is the centre of a rich gold and
copper district, and has eight mines in constant work. Pop. 6000. Oymple, 54 miles
south of Maryborough, has numerous reefs. Gold was first discovered in 1867, and the
yield up to 1873 was valued at �1,057,963. Pop. 5793.
Stanthorpe, in Bentinck county, 182 miles south-west of Brisbane, is a newly-risen
town in the tin-mining district. The yield of metal is very large. Toowoomba is the
principal town of the Darling Downs; it is 102 miles west of Brisbane. The district is
mainly pastoral. Pop. 3628. Warwick, on the Condamine, close to the border of New
South Wales, is a picturesque and attractive-town, in the midst of a fine wheat-growing
district. It is connected by railway with Brisbane. Pop. 3000.
TASMANIA.
The island of Tasmania was discovered in 1642 by Tasman, a Dutch
navigator, who named it Van Diemen?s Land. His visit was followed by
that of many others, but the first attempt at colonization was made in
1804, when a penal settlement was established on the banks of the
Derwent.
The colony made small progress at first; the natives proved trouble-
some, and bushrangers infested the country, but in 1853 convict trans-
portation was discontinued, and the colony became gradually settled and
prosperous. It lies to the south of Victoria, divided from it by Bass
Strait. It is 170 miles in length, and 160 in breadth, and has an area of
26,215 square miles. The population in 1877 was 107,104; the natives,
with one exception, are quite extinct. It is divided into eighteen counties.


The climate is remarkably healthy and invigorating, and the atmosphere
very pure. The high temperature of summer is moderated by sea and
mountain breezes; snow falls but rarely, and the rainfall in the settled
districts is moderate.
Extensive and dense forests of blue-gum, huon-pine, etc., clothe the west coast, and
ferns are to be found everywhere. The fauna is to a great extent the same as that of
Australia; but two species of marsupials, the ?tiger-wolf? and ?native devil,? are peculiar
to the island. Agriculture is chiefly practised in the colony, as the greater portion of
the island is unfit for pastoral purposes. The principal crops are: wheat, oats, barley,
hay, potatoes, pease, and beans. Hops are cultivated to a large extent, and fruit of all
kinds, not tropical, grows abundantly. Mining interests have not yet been greatly de-
veloped; tin and iron exist in large quantities, gold is not plentiful, and coni, though
abundant, is difficult of access.
Large quarries of freestone are worked, and the material exported to Australia for
building purposes. Brewing is one of the chief industries of Tasmania, and the ale is
exported; fruit-preserving is also an important branch of trade.
The chief exports are: baric, bran, dairy produce, wool, grain, hides, hops, fruit, ale,
etc. They amounted in 1874 to �925,325, and the imports to �1,257,785.
A line of telegraph, and three lines of railway, two of them in course of construction,
afford means of communication, and there are excellent high-roads, the work of the
convicts.
As in the Australian colonies, the Executive power is vested in a Governor appointed
by the Queen.
The Legislative Council is composed of 16 members, and the House of Assembly of
82. Instruction is superintended by a Council of Education, and is free and compulsory.
In 1874, 147 schools were in operation.
TOWNS.
Hobart Town, the capital of Tasmania, at the foot of Mount Wellington, is situated on
the Derwent, about 12 miles from its mouth, and has a spacious and sheltered harbour.
It is built on a succession of hills, and has broad streets adorned with several handsome
public buildings. It is a favourite summer residence of visitors from Adelaide, Mel-
bourne, and Sydney. Pop. 20,000.
Port Arthur, 64 miles south-east of Hobart Town, is the penal establishment of the
26 miles south-west of Hobart Town, is in a thickly-timbered region. Fruit
is much cultivated. . . ..
New Norfolk, 21 miles north-west of Hobart Town, on the bank of the Derwent, in the
centre of a great hop-growing district. On the Upper Derwent near it there are
salmon ponds. _ ......
Launceston is the second town of the island, and stands on the Tamar, about 40 miles
from its mouth. Steamers ply between it and Melbourne twice a week, and the rail-
way connecting it with Hobart Town is nearly completed. Pop. 10,668.
Deloraine, 30 miles south-west of Launceston, is connected with it by railway.
Campbelltown, 40 miles south-east, is the centre of a pastoral district. Pop. 1600.
Fingal, 66 miles south-east of Launceston, is a mining township. Gold, and also coal.
are worked. Pop. 2261. .
Stanley, or Circular Head, 142 miles north-west of Launceston, is a large and important
seaport, and has a thriving trade with Victoria. '
Bathunt is oh Port Davey, at the south-west of the island. The harbour is much
frequented by whaling vessels. >
