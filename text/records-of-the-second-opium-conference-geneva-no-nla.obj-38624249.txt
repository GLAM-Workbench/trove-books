I. OPENING SPEECH BY M. AVENOL,
DEPUTY SECRETARY GENERAL OF
THE LEAGUE.
M. Avenol (Deputy Secretary-General of the
League of Nations) :
Translation : Ladies and gentlemen I have
the honour, on behalf of the Council of the League
of Nations, to welcome the delegations which
have met here this morning for the important
Conference on Opium.
It is my hope that your work will lead to
definite results, which will mark an important
advance in the great work begun some years
ago by the Hague Convention.
You may rely on the wholehearted co-ope-
ration of all the services of the Secretariat to
aid you in your work.
As in the case of preceding international con-
ferences convened under the auspices of the
League of Nations, the Council was anxious to
entrust the direction of your proceedings to
a President whose competence and impartiality
would be universally recognised. The Council's
choice fell on His Excellency M. Herluf Zahle.
I have no need to introduce M. Zahle to you.
As first delegate of Denmark he has attended
all the Assemblies of the League. He has
been a member of the General Committee of
those Assemblies, and again this year, as
Chairman of the Fifth Committee, which dealt
mainly with humanitarian questions, more par-
ticularly with the opium question, his ability,
authority and impartiality were appreciated
by all his colleagues. I feel sure, therefore,
that all the delegations will warmly approve
the choice made by the Council of the League.
I request His Excellency M. Zahle to take the
Chair. [Applause.)
2. PRESIDENCY OF THE CONFERENCE :
WELCOME TO THE PRESIDENT.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States of
America) :
On behalf of the delegates of the United States
of America, it gives me the greatest pleasure to
express our hearty approval of the election of
M. Zahle as President of this Conference.
M. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation : The Japanese delegation greatly
appreciates the choice of the distinguished
Chairman of the Fifth Committee of the fifth
Assembly to conduct our debates on the
complex question of dangerous drugs. M. Zahle,
with his abilities, his lofty aspirations, and his
ideal of international solidarity, is the best
possible representative of the noble Danish
nation. Our proceedings will thus take place
under the lofty standard of justice and humanity.
We may therefore feel every gratification in
the judicious choice made by the Council
of the League.
M. von Eckardt (Germany) :
Translation : Three years ago, in reply to
the invitation from the League of Nations, the
German Government sent a representative to
the Advisory Committee on the Traffic in
Opium. It gladly avails itself of this further
opportunity of assisting in so far as it is
able in the solution of the problems with
which this Conference is called upon to deal.
Germany?s recent legislation is evidence of
her desire and resolution to co-operate with
all countries in the campaign against the abuse
of opium and narcotics. Her legislation, which
was originally based on the Hague Convention,
has been substantially amended, full use having
been made of the work of the Advisory Commit-
tee, of the recommendations of the League, and
of the experience gained by the authorities
appointed to supervise the traffic in the drugs
in question.
I am happy to be able to state, without any
reservation whatever, that Germany will make
every endeavour to render effective any mea-
sures which this Conference may deem expe-
dient for controlling and combating all forms
of illegal trading in narcotics. This humani-
tarian work, which is due to the praiseworthy


initiative of the United States, will, I am sure,
result in a Convention that will be approved
and acclaimed by the entire world. If the
text of this Convention is drawn up in clear
terms, it will obviate the results due to divergent
or erroneous interpretations which are liable
to jeopardise the success of a task that
unites all countries in a lofty and disin-
terested ideal.
M. Comnene (Roumania)
Translation : Ladies and gentlemen ?Many
of the delegates present in this room have taken
part in previous conferences and have had
an opportunity of becoming acquainted with
M. Zahle and of appreciating his abilities and
character. I shall therefore only be voicing
the unanimous opinion of all those who are
acquainted with M. Zahle if I ask him to be
good enough to accept the Presidency of the
Conference, if I offer our thanks to the Council
of the League for its admirable choice. On
behalf of my own delegation, I warmly and
cordially support the proposal which has been
made to us.
IYI. Falcioni (Italy) :
Translation : I desire, on behalf of the
Italian delegation, to welcome the President
and members of the Conference. Italy has
loyally observed the Hague Convention and
has enacted a law containing severe regulations
for preventing the illegitimate sale of opium.
She feels greatly honoured in co-operating with
the distinguished representatives of the various
nations to whom I tender cordial greetings
in the study and solution of a problem which
is of the most urgent character from the material,
intellectual and, more particularly, the moral
point of view.
Italy?s interest in this question is mainly
objective and humanitarian, and she hopes and
believes that the Conference will obtain concrete
and useful results.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba) :
Translation : I have asked leave to speak
on a question which is virtually a point of
order. Now that some of the delegations to
the Conference have expressed their warm
approval of the selection of M. Zahle as Pre-
sident, we should, I think, afford him an oppor-
tunity of addressing the Conference himself,
so that he may tell us what is in his mind and
what are his desires and recommendations.
Personally, Mr. President, I shall content
myself with reminding you that you and I
are the veterans of the League. I need not
therefore offer you my congratulations, but
I may say that the Cuban delegation warmly
welcomes you as President. [Applause.)
IVI. Sze (China)
Mr. President, gentlemen It is with
great pleasure that we welcome M. Zahle
to the Chair. lam sure that this Conference,
under his wise and able guidance, will not fail
to obtain the successful results for which
humanity is looking.
3. OPENING SPEECH BY THE PRESIDENT.
The President :
Translation : Ladies and gentlemen
The Council of the League of Nations has done
me a great honour in appointing me President
of this Conference which it has convened, and
I wish to say here how much I appreciate the
great compliment which the League has paid
me by selecting me to direct the work of so
important a meeting. I am also deeply touched
by the kind way in which this nomination has
been accepted by the members of the Confe-
rence. On this occasion I adopt as my own
the words spoken by the distinguished President
of the second Assembly of the League, His
Excellency M. van Karnebeek : ?Called upon
to direct your work, I shall endeavour to be
your devoted servant?.
In wishing you all a hearty welcome, gentle-
men, let me assure you that I will do my utmost
to merit the confidence which has been shown
in me.
We are met here to accomplish a task of
great difficulty ; but I am firmly convinced that
we are all here to do our best and that we shall
leave no stone unturned to bring our work
to a successful conclusion. In order to show
you the full importance of this task, with
your permission I will briefly survey the main
points of the problem of opium and dangerous
drugs.
It was about the year 1906 that certain
Governments resolved to come to the assistance
of China and to help her in the struggle against
the evil of opium smoking, which had so long
been the scourge of her people. As a conse-
quence of the movement against this evil
which was thus taking shape, an Interna-
tional Opium Commission was constituted
in 1909 at Shanghai, on the initiative of the
United States Government. The President
of the Shanghai Commission was an American,
Bishop Brent, one of the men who has done most
to combat the traffic in narcotics and who was
destined later to become the President of the
First International Conference at The Hague.
I am particularly glad to see Bishop Brent
among us to-day as a member of the United
States delegation. His great experience in the
question of narcotics will be of inestimable
value to the Conference. I wish to lay special
emphasis on the devoted work which certain
American citizens have done in this connection
and on the keen interest taken by the American
public in the campaign against the drug evil,
as, indeed, in all other humanitarian activities.
The first Conference at The Hague which
was also convened on the initiative of the United
States of America, although the invitations
were issued by the Netherlands Government,
profiting by the experience gained by the
Shanghai Commission, succeeded in drawing up
an International Opium Convention which
has, up to now, been the basis of all the legis-
lative measures taken by countries wishing to
combat effectively the grave danger constituted
by the abuse of narcotics.
The first Opium Conference was followed
by two other Conferences, also held at The
Heague, in 1913 and 1914 respectively. After
the third Conference, a Protocol was drawn
up at The Hague with a view to the application
of the 1912 Convention. This Protocol could
be signed by any Power which, having signed
and ratified the Agreement of 1912, declared
its intention of considering this Agreement
as coming into force as far as that Power
was concerned.
The 1912 Convention, which is termed the
International Opium Convention, contains much


more than its title would seem to imply. It
deals not only with opium proper but also
with its derivatives ; it even also lays down
provisions in regard to cocaine, which has
nothing to do with opium. The Convention
also gives an exact definition of the drugs
which it proposes to control.
As regards the entry into force of the Conven-
tion, however, the position remained somewhat
unsatisfactory during the first eight years ;
a change took place when the Peace Conference
in 1919 decided to insert in the Treaty of Ver-
sailles a special clause regarding the ratification
of the Hague Convention. This clause, which
constitutes Article 295 of the Treaty of Ver-
sailles, stipulates that those of the Contracting
Parties which have not yet signed, or which have
signed but not yet ratified, the Hague Conven-
tion agree to bring the said Convention into
force and for this purpose to enact the necessary
legislation without delay, and in any case
within a period of twelve months from the
coming into force of the Treaty. Further-
more, the Contracting Parties agreed that
ratification of the Treaty of Peace should be
deemed in all respects equivalent to the rati-
fication of that Convention and to the signature
of the Special Protocol which was opened at The
Hague in accordance with the resolutions adop-
ted by the third Opium Conference in 1914 for
bringing the said Convention into force.
A similar article was inserted in the Treaties
of St. Germain, Neuilly and Trianon. An
immense step forward was thus made ; while
on the outbreak of hostilities no Power had
signed the Protocol for bringing the Convention
into force and only five signatures were affixed
between 1914 and 1918, the Protocol has now
been signed by about forty countries.
In virtue of Article 23 (c) of the Covenant
of the League of Nations, the League has been
entrusted with the general supervision over the
execution of agreements with regard to the
traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs.
The campaign against the abuse of these drugs
thus entered a new phase.
The first Assembly of the League of Nations
organised this work of supervision on a per-
manent basis. A permanent Advisory Com-
mittee on the Traffic in Opium and other
Dangerous Drugs was constituted to assist the
Council and the Assembly of the League in
all questions relating to narcotics. I will
mention later the activities of this Committee,
but I would like to draw attention here to the
remarkable work done during the various
sessions of the Committee towards the great
end for which we are all working.
The States particularly interested in this
question were asked to nominate members on
this Committee. In addition, the Committee
also includes three assessors, selected for their
special qualifications, their wide experience
and their admirable zeal. I refer to Mrs.
Hamilton Wright, Sir John Jordan and
M. Henri Brenier. As its name implies, the Advi-
sory Committee?s task is to give advice to
the Council and the Assembly of the League,
which are the bodies competent to take any
final decisions in questions of this kind.
The Committee first of all directed its
efforts into the two foiling channels:
(a) Steps taken to ensure the application
of the provisions of the International
Convention of 1912 ;
( b ) Steps taken with a view to supple-
menting these provisions ;
for experience has shown that the Convention
requires a number of additions.
In respect of the first part of the Committee?s
work, I must refer to the efforts which it has
made, through the Council and the Assemblies,
to persuade all States to ratify the Convention
of 1912. These efforts have been crowned
with success. A large number of States have
adhered to the Convention, and many of them
have already taken the necessary steps to
bring their internal legislation into line with
the provisions of the Convention.
I should also make particular reference to
the work accomplished by the Committee as
regards import certificates ; the system recom-
mended by the Committee in 1922 has now
been adopted by most of the signatory Gov-
ernments.
I should also refer to the important work
accomplished in the way of controlling traffic
in free ports, and the transit trade.
With a view to obtaining the maximum of
international co-operation in the campaign
against the drug peril, it has been decided that
Governments should exchange information con-
cerning the seizures of drugs in their territory.
Naturally, such an exchange is of the highest
importance when it is a question of prosecuting
and punishing individuals carrying on unlawful
traffic.
In this connection we should also refer to the
work accomplished by the Committee with a
view to giving full effect to Article 21 [h) of
the Hague Convention concerning the "exchange
of statistical information as regards the trade
in raw opium, prepared opium, morphine,
cocaine, and their respective salts, as well as
in the other drugs or their salts or preparations
referred to in the present Convention?. The
Secretariat also receives information in regard
to the laws, regulations and ordinances con-
cerning narcotics which are in force in the
various countries.
In order to make good the omissions in the
Convention of 1912, the Advisory Committee
found that it was necessary to adopt a policy
of limiting the production of raw materials
from which narcotic drugs are manufactured.
The information in its possession shows that
there is an enormous over-production of opium.
It has even been calculated that present pro-
duction is ninety per cent in excess of the
world?s medical and scientific needs.
Such a restriction of the production of raw
materials will involve great sacrifice on the
part of countries in which the poppy and the
coca leaf are cultivated, such as China, India,
Turkey, Persia and certain Balkan States,
and as regards the coca leaf such as Java,
Peru and Bolivia. Any restriction involving
the sacrifice to which I have referred can
naturally only prove effective if an international
agreement is reached between all producing and
consuming countries. In order to reach this
agreement, we must all be really desirous of
attaining a result. We must be resolute in
overcoming the difficulties which we shall
perhaps encounter, but which are not insupe-
rable.
During its fifth session the Advisory Com-
mittee, on the proposal of the United States
delegation, adopted certain resolutions for the


limitation of the quantities of narcotics which in the production of coca leaves. The French
may be manufactured. These resolutions were
submitted to the fourth Assembly of the League.
The Assembly approved the proposals of the
Advisory Committee, suggesting that the various
Governments should examine the question of
limiting the manufacture of drugs and the pro-
duction of raw materials, with a view to con-
cluding an agreement for this purpose.
In December 1923, the Council of the League
approved the decision of the Assembly and
decided that two Conferences should be con-
vened at Geneva in November 1924. It was
decided that all Governments of States Members
of the League or parties to the Convention
of 1912 should be invited to send delegates
to the second of these Conferences. A Prepa-
ratory Committee was instructed to draw up
a draft programme for this Conference and
to submit the draft to all States invited to
participate.
The Preparatory Committee held several
meetings under the Presidency of M. van
Wettum (Netherlands) and examined all the
information which had been collected since it
became the duty of the League of Nations
to supervise any agreements concluded. These
documents furnished a certain amount of infor-
mation concerning both present production and
the world's legitimate requirements in narcotics.
A Mixed Sub-Committee had been formed
by the Advisory Committee on the Traffic in
Opium and the Health Committee of the League
to consider the question of the legitimate
requirements of all countries in the matter
of drugs. This Mixed Sub-Committee reported
that it considered 600 milligrammes per
inhabitant per annum might be regarded as the
maximum quantity of raw opium required
for medicinal and scientific needs. The Health
Committee took note of this report and expressed
the opinion that 450 milligrammes would be
a more correct estimate for countries possessing
an adequate medical system. On examining
these figures, the Preparatory Committee decided
to request further information on this subject,
particularly as regards the methods by which
the figures in question had been obtained.
The Health Committee replied by a letter in
which the figures were considerably reduced,
but as this letter was received after the disso-
lution of the Preparatory Committee, the latter
was not able to examine it. It has, however,
been distributed to the former members of
this Committee and, if you think it necessary,
I will have it distributed to the present Con-
ference.
The report of the Preparatory Committee was
sent to all Governments and also to the Advisory
Committee during its session held in August this
year (Annex I). The Preparatory Committee
was unable to submit a single draft programme
for the Second Conference. The American,
British, French and Dutch members had each
framed a separate draft Convention. The
proposals of the British and American delegates
aimed at the conclusion of a formal agreement
between the producing and manufacturing
States, under which the latter would themselves
restrict their manufacture of narcotics in
accordance with an estimate, to be fixed by the
Governments, of their medical requirements.
The Netherlands proposals had as their object
the indirect limitation of the manufacture of
cocaine, to be effected by a gradual decrease
proposals provided for the application of more
effective measures than those at present in
force for national and international control,
with a view to effecting a reduction in the output
of the manufactured products.
As the Preparatory Committee had been
unable to agree upon a uniform plan, the
Advisory Committee, which met in August,
decided to effect a compromise between the
different schemes ; for this purpose, it drew
up a series of measures which might furnish
a satisfactory basis for the work of the Confe-
rence and prepare the way for a final agreement.
(Annex 2).
The measures contemplated by the Advisory
Committee may be summarised as follows :
(1) The conclusion of a number of agree-
ments for restricting imports and ex-
ports of narcotics and raw materials to
such quantities as are required for
medical and scientific purposes;
(2) The framing of a number of proposals
for strengthening the provisions of the
Hague Convention, more especially
those relating to the control of imports
and exports.
The adoption of these proposed measures
does not imply that all members of the Prepa-
ratory Committee have withdrawn their original
proposals. But as these measures submitted
by the Advisory Committee were adopted
after the Committee had taken cognisance of
the schemes drawn up by several members of
the Preparatory Committee, it might perhaps
be possible first to examine whether the draft
could be used as a basis of our preliminary
discussions.
I have one more thing to say before I con-
clude. A proposal was made that the repre-
sentatives of private associations should be
admitted to the Conference and should give
their opinion on the questions under discussion.
This would create no precedent ; by adopting
this proposal we should establish no new prin-
ciple. At the 1912 International Conference
at The Hague, and also at other international
conferences, representatives of philanthropic
associations were admitted and expressed
their views and their wishes on thejpoints which
concerned them. I therefore submit this matter
to my colleagues in order that we may take a
decision on it as soon as possible.
In commencing our work you will, I hope,
remember that the aim we have in view is to
provide a really effective weapon to fight a
scourge which has become increasingly danger-
ous to mankind. The evil which we are here
to combat has spread to all classes of society and
to almost all countries. I need not say that
we must attempt to cure those who have al-
ready contracted the pernicious habit of mor-
phinomania and cocainomania. But our main
endeavour must be to prevent these vices from
claiming new victims. I would beg you more
especially to think of their danger for the young ;
if we have the desire that future generations
shall be really well armed for life?s struggle,
we must protect them against a peril which,
in these years following the world war, has
become an even greater menace and is certainly
not unconnected with the economic and moral
disturbances resulting from the terrible disaster
of 1914.


Let me remind you that our aims can only be opium. The Hague Convention lays the res-
attained if all States co-operate. National
measures are insufficient to suppress the dan-
gerous traffic in narcotics. We must endeavour
to regard this international programme in
its true aspect, which is humanitarian and
social. We must not jeopardise the well-
being of thousands of mankind for material
reasons.
It is in this spirit and in the hope that our
work may mark a definite step forward towards
the solution of this complex problem that I
declare open the Second Opium Conference
convoked under the auspices of the League of
Nations. [Applause.)
4. ADOPTION OF THE AGENDA
OF THE CONFERENCE.
The President :
Translation : The first subject we have to
consider is the adoption of the agenda for the
Conference, which is as follows :
1, Election of Vice-President ; officers of
the Conference and Commissions ; adop-
tion of Rules of Procedure.
2. Consideration of the measures which can
be taken to carry out the Opium Con-
vention of 1912 with regard to : (1) a
limitation of the amounts of morphine,
heroin or cocaine and their respective
salts to be manufactured ; (2) a limi-
tation of the amounts of raw opium
and the coca leaf to be imported for that
purpose and for other medicinal and
scientific purposes; (3) a limitation of the
production of raw opium and the coca
leaf for export to the amount required
for such medicinal and scientific pur-
poses.
I will ask the delegates to let me know
whether I may consider the general agenda
for the Conference as adopted.
As there is no objection, I take it that the
agenda is adopted.
The agenda was adopted.
The Hon. Stephen Q. Porter (United States
of America) :
Mr. President, I desire to file a reservation
on the agenda.
The United States delegation respectfully
reserves the right to move that the agenda
be amended in the event of the First Conference
not providing an effective means for the sup-
pression of the traffic in prepared opium or
failing to reach an agreement.
We are confronted with an unfortunate
situation which cannot be solved by an appeal
to technicalities. Whether or not the findings
of the First Conference were to have been
reported directly to the Second Conference, the
latter at least needs to know them in order to
deal effectively with the subject of production.
The First Conference has thus far reached no
agreement, and we have nothing before us.
The dictates of commonsense demand a
frank admission of the dilemma in which this
failure to reach an agreement has placed the
Second Conference and a consideration of the
possibility and wisdom of widening the scope
of our discussion to include the subject of the
progressive suppression of the traffic in prepared
ponsibility for this matter upon all the contract-
ing Powers without distinction.
It is only fair to state that the representatives
of the United States, foreseeing the possibi-
lity of such a situation as has arisen, consis-
tently contended at the meetings of the Fifth
Committee of the Assembly of 1923 f� r one
instead of two Conferences. In view of these
facts, the United States delegation respectfully
reserves the right to move the amendment
of the agenda in the event of the First Confe-
rence not providing an effective means for the
suppression of the traffic in prepared opium
or failing to reach an agreement.
The President :
Translation : The members of the Conference
take note of the statement made by the first
delegate of the United States ; it will be inserted
in the record of the present meeting.
5. ELECTION OF THE VICE-PRESIDENTS
OF THE CONFERENCE.
The President:
Translation : With reference to the next
item on the agenda, namely, the election of a
Vice-President, I would venture to suggest
that we should appoint two Vice-Presidents.
When I speak of two Vice-Presidents I do
not mean a first and second Vice-President ;
my idea is that we should have two Vice-
Presidents who would be on an equal footing.
Unfortunately, there is too little space on this
platform to allow two Vice-Presidents to take
their seats beside me. I would therefore
propose that the Vice-Presidents whom we
elect should sit in turn on the platform in
their official capacity.
M. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : The Japanese delegation pro-
poses as Vice-Presidents M. de Aguero y
Bethancourt (Cuba) and M. Sze (China). The
long and brilliant careers of the first delegates
of Cuba and China are known to all. I need
not therefore make any observation on this
proposal. America and Asia will be happy
to see representatives of all that is best in
those two continents elected as Vice-Presidents
of the Conference.
The President :
Translation : Has any delegate any other
proposal to make concerning the nomination
of the Vice-Presidents ?
As the matter now stands, we have before
us a proposal made by the Japanese delegation,
and I am in complete sympathy with M.
Sugimura?s intentions in proposing two repre-
sentatives, one for the American continent
and the other for Asia.
As no one else has any proposal to make, I
may take it that you are in favour of the Japa-
nese delegate?s motion. According to the usual
rules of procedure, however though these
rules have not yet been voted motions on
such questions are generally decided by ballot.
As the rule regarding voting has not yet
been determined, we might, with your consent,
elect by acclamation the two candidates pro-
posed by the Japanese delegation. If anyone,
however, desires a ballot, we will proceed to
hold one at once. [Applause.)


Your applause is convincing evidence that immediately, as some delegates may not yet
we need not hold a ballot. I have therefore
the honour to declare that His Excellency
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt, delegate of Cuba,
and His Excellency M. Sze, first delegate of
China, are elected Vice-Presidents of the Second
Opium Conference. I offer them a hearty
welcome upon their appointment as Vice-Pre-
sidents and shall be happy to work in close
co-operation with them.
I will request M. de Aguero y Bethancourt,
who was nominated first by the Japanese
delegation, to be good enough to take his seat
on my right. [Applause.)
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba)
Translation : I wish to thank my colleagues
very sincerely for the honour which they
have done my country and for the mark of
distinction which they have just conferred
upon myself. [Applause.)
M. Sze (China)
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen I
am deeply touched by the honour you have
conferred upon me by electing me as one of
the Vice-Presidents of this Conference. I inter-
pret your kind action less as a tribute to
myself personally than as an honour that you
wish to show to my country and to my people.
In their name I express my deep appreciation,
coupled with my personal thanks. [Applause.)
6. APPOINTMENT OF THE COMMITTEE
ON CREDENTIALS.
The President :
Translation : The next item on the agenda
is the appointment of the Committee on Cre-
dentials. You are aware that, according to
the invitations sent out to the different Govern-
ments, this Conference is composed of pleni-
potentiary delegates, and that all delegates
are provided or shortly will be with full
powers.
By the rules of procedure, these full powers
should be forwarded to the Secretary-General
of the League and then transmitted by him
to a Committee. At the Assembly of the
League this Committee consists of eight mem-
bers, but, as the present Conference is smaller,
I think five members would suffice. The
Committee will examine the credentials of
delegates and draw up a report. It will
perhaps facilitate the proceedings if I submit
a list of the members whom I would propose
for the Committee. [Assent.)
As you agree with my suggestion, I will
propose the following names :
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba), Vice-
President, Prince Charoon (Siam), M. Clin-
chant (France), M. von Eckardt (Germany)
and M. Jovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes).
The reason why I put M. de Aguero y Bethan-
court?s name first on the list is not because his
name begins with ?A" nor because he is
Vice-President of the Conference, but because
he has, unless I am mistaken, been Rapporteur
at each Assembly for the Committee on
Credentials. He has therefore the widest
possible experience on this matter.
I would suggest to the Committee that it
would be better not to draw up its report
be in possession of the necessary papers.
I leave the Committee, however, entirely free
to act as it considers best.
The Conference approved the list of members for
the Committee on Credentials submitted by the
President.
7. CONSIDERATION OF THE DRAFT RULES
OF PROCEDURE.
The President :
Translation : The next item on the agenda is
the examination of the draft rules of procedure,
which are contained in Document O. D. C. 9
(Annex 3).
Does any delegate desire to speak on this
question ?
M. Dendramis (Greece)
Translation : I would like to ask for one
or two explanations. The rules of procedure
contain no reference to the question of voting
on a motion. We should, I think, lay down
a rule that, when it is a question of modifying
a clause in the Hague Convention, all the
Members signatories of that Convention should
be unanimous.
The President
Translation : Do the members of the Confe-
rence desire that the draft rules should be
examined by a Committee, which might also
consider the question raised by M. Dendramis ?
M. Dendramis (Greece) :
Translation : That was my intention. I
should like, if possible, to have the rules referred
for examination to a Committee which could
push forward its work and submit a report
without delay.
The President
Translation : We have before us a proposal
by the Greek delegation that the draft rules
of procedure should be referred to a Committee
for examination. If no delegate desires to
speak on the motion, I will request the Con-
ference to appoint a Committee of seven
members to investigate the question and report
as speedily as possible.
Does any delegate desire to make a proposal
regarding the membership of the Committee ?
Or are you prepared again to allow me to
select certain names ?
As no suggestions are forthcoming, I propose
the following seven delegates as members of
the Committee : Dr. F. Bustamente (Spain),
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire), M.
Dinichert (Switzerland), M. Pinto-Escalier
(Bolivia), Dr. E. R. Sjostrand (Sweden), M. Sze
(China) and M. Veverka (Czechoslovakia).
The list was approved.
The President :
Translation: I would request the Committee
on the Rules of Procedure to be good enough
to meet as soon as possible to examine this
question and draw up a report for submission
to the Conference.
The Committee will be able to meet this
afternoon, as there will be no plenary meeting
of the Second Conference.


8. QUESTION OF THE AUDITION OF THE
FI ERR ES ENT AT IVES OF PRIVATE
ASSOCIATIONS.
Tne President
Translation : In the speech with which
I had the honour to open the meeting, I ven-
tured to submit two suggestions, the first of
which was that we should hear the represen-
tatives of various private associations who
are present at Geneva. I should be glad to
have the views of the Conference on this matter.
Should these representatives be heard by the
Conference at a semi-official meeting, the records
of which would be annexed to the records of
the Conference ?
I should add that the following have asked
to address you on behalf of the organisations
which they represent ; M. Koo, representative
of the National Anti-Opium Association of
China : M. Warnshuis, representative of the
International Missionary Council ; Mr. Mac-
Lennan, representative of the Conference of
Missionary Societies.
The Foreign Policy Association, represented
by Mrs. Helen Moorhead, and the Catholic
Students? Union, represented by Mgr. Eugene
Beaupin and M. Louis Vogt, have also asked
that their representatives should be permitted
to attend the Second Opium Conference, and,
if necessary, give any relevant information on
the subjects under discussion.
I should like to know whether the Conference
considers that these representatives should be
heard before the opening of our general dis-
cussion or in the course of that discussion.
We might perhaps hear some representatives
before the discussion and others later. I
should like to know my colleagues? views on
this point.
M. Buero (Uruguay) :
Translation : May I venture to remind
you of a precedent created at last year?s
Conference on the Simplification of Customs
Formalities ? Certain representatives of the
International Chamber of Commerce partici-
pated in the Conference and took their seats
among the delegates in the capacity of experts.
They asked to be allowed to address the Con-
ference on the points which interested them
and the Conference took their opinions into
consideration. These representatives, however,
were not entitled to vote. The present Confe-
rence might adopt the same procedure regarding
the private organisations represented here.
The Right Rev. Charles H. Brent (United
States of America) ;
My recollection of the Hague Conference is
that we admitted six representatives of pri-
vate associations at an informal meeting which
unfortunately was held in the middle of our
deliberations and not at the beginning of the
Conference.
It seems to me highly desirable that repre-
sentatives of these various associations should
address the Conference, but I am of the opinion
that it would be very unfortunate to have them
sitting with the delegations, or for them to
have the right of speaking during the Confe-
rence. It would seem to be much wiser to
fix a date on which they should appear, when
they would all have an opportunity of putting
their views before the Conference.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba), Vice-
President
Translation : As the delegate of Uruguay
and Bishop Brent have just pointed out, there
are precedents in connection with this matter.
The representatives of different associations
or organisations have been heard by other inter-
national conferences. At the International
Conference on Transit and at the London Confe-
rence on Maritime Navigation, which I attended,
we heard a number of associations which gave
their views in an expert capacity and afforded
us valuable assistance.
It may not, perhaps, be possible to ask
the representatives of all the associations to
remain here throughout the session ; some of
them probably will not have time to do so.
It would be both courteous to these orga-
nisations and helpful to the Conference in
its work for the humanitarian object which
it has in view if we were to fix two dates
between which the representatives of private
associations would be heard or, alterna-
tively, we might permit them to take their seats
among us throughout the session. It is for
the associations to decide whether their repre-
sentatives will be able to remain here until
the end of the session. If, however, their
representatives attended only some of our
debates and, if after their departure, discussions
arose on subjects regarding which the Confe-
rence might have need of their assistance, it
would be regrettable that it should be deprived
of this advantage.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I entirely agree with the views expressed
by Bishop Brent. If the representatives of the
private associations are to be permitted to address
the Conference, I think it would be the right
course for them to speak on a certain day. These
associations are private associations ; their
representatives are private individuals, and it
seems to me that it would be inconsistent
with the constitution of this Conference to
allow them to sit among us and to give them
the right to speak.
I understand that the representatives of
these associations desire to be allowed formally
to state their views at a meeting of the Con-
ference. I think we shall all agree that this
proposal is a desirable one and I suggest that
it should be adopted and that the represen-
tatives of the associations should be heard at
the begining of our session and before the
general discussion takes place.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
I most warmly support the suggestion made
by Bishop Brent and seconded by Sir Malcolm
Delevingne. We are here as plenipotentiary dele-
gates, and it does not seem to me to be possible
for the representatives of private associations
to take part in our discussions.
M. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : The Japanese delegation en-
tirely supports the views expressed by M. Buero
and M. de Aguero y Bethancourt. Their
opinion is based on their personal experience
and on the traditions of the League. The
constitution of this Conference does not pre-
vent us from attaching value to the opinions
of the representatives of private associations.
It might even be necessary for us to co-operate
with them, for they represent public opinion.


In so far as it is possible, I think it desirable
that they should take part in the discussions,
without, of course, having the right to vote.
IVIr. Campbell (India)
May I say that I entirely agree with the views
expressed by Bishop Brent, Sir Malcolm
Delevingne and M. van Wettum ? It seems to me,
however, that it is perhaps undesirable to con-
tinue the discussion.
If it were continued, I should like to press
a formal point as to the constitution of the
Conference, but one of the representatives
concerned has explained to me, on his own
behalf, and he thinks he is speaking on behalf
of the representatives of the other associations,
that they do not desire to sit in the Conference
and take part in the dicsussion on the same
footing as the other delegates, with the only
difference that they have no right to vote.
This is not part of their request.
I gather that the proposal made by Bishop
Brent is acceptable to the representatives
and that they would actually prefer it.
M. Ferreira (Portugal) :
Translation : In view of my experience at
the first Hague Conference, I desire to support
Bishop Brent?s proposal.
M. Clinchant (France)
Translation : I whole-heartedly concur in
the views of Bishop Brent, Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne, Mr. Campbell and M. Ferreira, on the
grounds which they have given.
ML El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : The private associations were
asked if they could send delegates to sit through-
out the Conference. We have not yet had
any definite information on the point. We
might, I think, therefore postpone a decision
until we know the situation.
IVI. Buero (Uruguay)
Translation : I should like to point out
that I have not made any definite proposal.
The President asked the members of the Confe-
rence to express their views on this question.
I made a reference to what was done at the
Customs Conference last December and, in
order to hasten the proceedings, I ventured
to make a simple suggestion, but I wish to
repeat that it is not a formal proposal.
The President
Translation : I should be glad to know
whether M. Sugimura?s proposal should be
considered as a formal motion or as an obser-
vation of a general nature.
IVI. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : Mr. Campbell, delegate of
India, has informed us that the representatives
of the private associations do not desire to
sit in the Conference on the same footing as the
representatives of the Governments. There
is, therefore, no reason for further discussion
and I am prepared to withdraw my motion.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba) :
Translation : We have two questions to
settle ; first, a question of courtesy towards
the private associations, and, secondly, the
question whether it would be helpful for the
?Conference to hear the views of their represen-
tatives.
I was in agreement with Bishop Brent?s
opinion, but I had no intention of implying
that the associations should be given the same
rights as the accredited delegates to the Con-
ference.
The President
Translation : I may conclude from the
discussion that the members of the Conference
desire to hear the representatives of the pri-
vate associations.
We have now to decide upon the day on
which they will be heard. Should we hear
them before we begin the general discussion
or would it be better to set aside a day after
the general discussion has been concluded ?
I have just been informed that the represen-
tatives themselves would prefer to state their
views at the end of this week.
It may perhaps be difficult to decide the
question at the present moment, and 1 propose
that we should leave it in abeyance. We might,
however, begin the general discussion. This
would enable delegates to get into touch with
the private associations.
IVI. Dendramis (Greece)
Translation : I suggest that the General
Committee of the Conference should be left free
to decide upon the day on which the represen-
tatives of the private associations should be
heard by the Conference.
The President
Translation : There is no General Committee
in the strict sense of the term. I presume that
the Greek delegate?s proposal refers to the
President and Vice-Presidents.
Mr. Campbell (India)
I understand that representatives of the
private associations would prefer not to speak
at the beginning of the Conference, and would
appreciate it if a date could be fixed later on
by arrangement with them. They are, of
course, desirous to meet the convenience of
the Conference in this matter, and possibly
a date could be fixed later by direct communi-
cation with the President or with the Secre-
tariat.
The President
Translation : Most delegates are, I think,
in favour of the proposal that the President and
Vice-Presidents should get into touch with the
representatives of the private associations and
attempt to come to an arrangement which
would suit them and the Conference.
The above proposal was adopted.
ADOPTION AS A BASIS FOR PRELIMI-
NARY DISCUSSION OF THE SERIES
OF MEASURES ELABORATED BY
THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON THE
TRAFFIC IN OPIUM AND OTHER
DANGEROUS DRUGS.
The President
Translation : There is only one other point
on which I have to consult you. In my open-
ing speech I ventured to suggest that we
should take as a basis for our preliminary
discussions the series of measures adopted by
the Advisory Committee on the Traffic in


Opium at its last session. You all know
what these measures are. I propose that we
should hold only a short discussion on this
point, but it is, I think, necessary to have a
base from which to start. Delegates are, of
course, perfectly free to make any other
proposal.
Does anyone else wish to speak on this point ?
As no one has raised any objection to my
proposal, I take it as adopted.
The proposal was adopted.
The Conference rose at 1.40 p.m.
SECOND MEETING
Held at Geneva on Tuesday, November iBth, 1924, at 3.30 p.m.
CONTENTS.
10. Provisional Adoption of the Draft
Rules of Procedure of the Confe-
rence.
11. Vice-Presidency of the Meeting.
12. Preliminary Discussion on the Basis of
the Series of Measures adopted by
the Advisory Committee on the
Traffic in Opium and Other Danger-
ous Drugs.
President : M. Herluf Zahle.
10. PROVISIONAL ADOPTION OF THE
DRAFT RULES OF PROCEDURE OF
THE CONFERENCE.
The President
Translation : The Committee which we
appointed yesterday to examine the rules
of procedure has not yet concluded its work.
I hope that it will be able to do so to-day and
that the Conference will be in possession of its
report at our next meeting.
As I am unable to preside over a Conference
without rules of procedure, I propose that,
as a pure formality I would stress this
point we should provisionally adopt the
draft rules of procedure submitted to us yes-
terday (Annex 3).
If there is no objection, I shall consider the
draft rules of procedure adopted for to-day?s
meeting. [Assent).
11. VICE-PRESIDENCY OF THE MEETING.
The President
Translation : I will request M. Sze, first
delegate of China, to take his place on my
right.
M. Sze (China)
May I ask permission to request my honoured
colleague from Cuba to take that seat ? In
China we always respect age, because age
means experience and experience means wisdom.
I think you have in the West the expression,
?Age before beauty??. My honoured colleague
from Cuba is a combination of both age and
beauty. I am more accustomed to speak
from a lower level, while aiming to keep my
ideals on a high plane.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba), Vice-
President ;
Translation : lam very deeply touched
by M. Sze?s words, especially by his words
regarding my personal appearance. The rules
of procedure, however, are rules of procedure,
and we must adhere to them. Although
I fully appreciate M. Sze?s courtesy, I must
insist on his taking his place beside the Pre-
sident. That place belongs to him to-day,
for we decided that it should be occupied by
the Vice-Presidents at alternate meetings.
The President
1 ranslation : The point is a purely private
one, and I have no desire to interfere. I should
prefer, however, that the decisions which we
have taken should be maintained. I will
again ask the first delegate of China to take
his place on the platform.
{M. Sze, delegate of China, took his place, as
Vice-President, on the platform.)
12. PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION ON THE
BASIS OF THE SERIES OF MEASURES
ADOPTED BY THE ADVISORY COM-
MITTEE ON THE TRAFFIC IN OPIUM
AND OTHER DANGEROUS DRUGS.
The President
Translation : lam not able to submit a
formal agenda to-day, but all delegates will,
I think, agree that we should begin the general
discussion on the basis of the so-called measures
adopted by the Advisory Committee, but without
any restriction as to the different points.
The discussion will be entirely general and free.
If there is no objection, the general discussion
will now be opened. (Assent.)
The general discussion is open. The first
delegate of Persia will address the Con-
ference.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia) :
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen In the four years during which
I have had the honour to represent my country
on the League of Nations, I have on several
occasions set forth my Government?s opinion
on the opium question before the Fifth Com-
mittee and the Assembly. I have shown the
great interest taken by the Persian Government
in this question and the endeavours which
it has made to limit the cultivation of the poppy
and to restrict the use of its pernicious product.


Last September 1 told the Fifth Committee by illustrated lectures and by suitable cinema-
of the energetic and effective measures which
our Government is taking for this humanitarian
purpose. I shall not weary you by repeating them
here. I shall merely give you a brief account
of the introduction of opium into Persia and
of the development of its use and traffic.
Opium, as is generally known, was imported
into China and India by Arabs in the fifteenth
century. Later, the poppy was brought from
India to Persia. In recalling this fact of his-
tory, I do not intend to censure the Arabs or
Indians for sending us this treacherous plant,
the lovely flowers of which enchant the eye
but the juice of which poisons the blood. On
the other hand, their purpose was a humanita-
rian one. For many centuries opium was
used as a perfectly legitimate remedy to assuage
pain. Our climate is dry and favourable to
the poppy, and Persian opium, owing to its
superior quality and moderate price, has gia-
dually conquered a high place on the world
market. Buyers come from all countries to
purchase opium from us for medical needs.
Farmers in our southern provinces naturally
were glad to undertake the cultivation of the
poppy and thousands of families lived solely by
producing this plant. Unfortunately, the spirit
of evil has discovered a second quality in opium
over and above its beneficial one : a devilish
quality which unbalanced men in the Fast
and West alike have begun to abuse in such
a manner that the Governments have taken
alarm and have convened several international
conferences of which the present is the
most important to discover a remedy against
this scourge of mankind.
On behalf of our Government, we strongly
desire that this distinguished Conference shall
succeed in its arduous, difficult and human!-
tarian task.
We are happy to be able to state that our
Government is in agreement with the League
of Nations and warmly appreciates its splendid
efforts to seek a means of saving the world
from the danger of intoxicating drugs.
Our Government is in agreement with the
principles contained in the proposals of the
United States delegates and it is ready to give
its adherence to Article 3 of the Hague Con-
vention as well as to the system of impoit and
export certificates for opium.
But, Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,
you in your turn will agree with us that it is
impossible by a single stroke of the pen to
deprive thousands of farmers and other persons
of their livelihood. We must think, too, of
the fate of the innumerable families of pro-
ducers and workmen and replace the cultivation
of the poppy by something else. Serious
reflection must be given as to how to effect
this change. All these questions must be
seriously examined.
We have detailed proposals to put before
the Conference and we hope that it and the
League of Nations will look favourably upon
our righteous claims.
In conclusion, I venture to add a few opi-
nions of my own, which I have had the honour
to express to the Committees and to the Assembly.
In addition to all administrative measures, it
would be of the utmost expediency to employ
an intensive and untiring propaganda through
the distribution of pamphlets in all languages,
by the placarding of notices, through the Press,
tographic films.
Consumers of opium have yielded to this
vice of their own accord. Their eyes, therefore,
must be opened in order that they may also,
of their own accord, renounce this mischie-
vous habit. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. Sugimura, delegate of
Japan, will adress the Conference.
IVI. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation : The guiding principle of the
Japanese delegation at the present Conference
is as clear and unambiguous as that by which
it was guided at the preceding Conference,
namely, that considerations of a humanitarian
nature and public health are paramount. No
effort will be spared to attain our ideal. I
have great pleasure in being able to tell the
Conference that the illegal consumption of
narcotics does not exist in Japan itself, in
Formosa, in the leased territory of Kwantung,
or in Korea.
Our chief interest in this matter, from the
practical point of view, concerns the possi-
bility of strictly limiting imports and manu-
factures of dangerous drugs to the quantities
required for medical and scientific purposes.
If we keep steadily before us certain lofty
considerations of humanity and social hygiene,
we shall find no great difficulty in reaching
an agreement. The Japanese delegation will
warmly welcome any proposal which the other
delegations may make for attaining our
ideal.
Before we begin to discuss in detail the
problem before us, the first delegate of Japan,
M. Kaku, former Civil Governor of Formosa,
would like to make a general statement based
on long personal experience. M. Kaku is
indeed the highest authority in Japan on these
questions. He is at the head of the adminis-
tration specially appointed for this purpose.
The Japanese Government and people rely
upon him for an effective solution of the prob-
lem of the illegal traffic in narcotics.
M. Kaku will speak in Japanese, but he will
be interpreted into English and French by the
able interpreters of the Secretariat of the League
who do so much to facilitate relations between
delegates. [Applause.)
M. Kaku (Japan), speaking in Japanese
Translation : The problem of narcotic drugs
to-day has ceased to be a local problem of
any one country, and is becoming a question
of concern to the whole world. It is intimately
connected with the problem of opium smoking,
which was the chief concern of the First
Conference.
The fundamental problem dealt with by the
First and Second Conferences is in many
respects the same, namely, the problem of
addiction to the habitual use of opium and other
narcotic drugs. It is therefore evident that
it is difficult to separate these two phases of
the problem entirely, and the proposal which
I presented to the First Conference will natu-
rally form part of this statement. When the
problem includes the question of the legitimate
use of drugs for medical and scientific needs
and, at the same time, the abusive use of nar


cotics, the question of control becomes extremely
complicated.
The Japanese Government, recognising the
danger of these habit-forming drugs, had pro-
mulgated laws, long before the first Interna-
tional Opium Conference met at The Hague in
1912, to prevent the abuse of opium and other
narcotic drugs. The regulations for control-
ling the drugs were enforced so strictly and so
effectively that to-day the Japanese are entirely
free from this evil habit.
As the Japanese Government ratified the
International Opium Convention, the laws
and regulations were amended on January Ist,
1921, in conformity with its provisions, so
that the importation of raw materials and of
the substances covered by the Convention and
the manufacture of the drugs were limited to
the quantity required for legitimate use.
As regards the exportation of narcotics drugs,
the Government has not only faithfully and
energetically observed the provisions of the
Opium Convention, which is considered to be
based on humanitarian principles, but has also
exercised a strict control over the means
adopted for securing the quantities of drugs
required for medical and scientific use in the
country.
Fortunately, as the result of measures of
strict control and of social education, the Japa-
nese have kept themselves entirely free from
the drug habit. But, unfortunately, in many
parts of the world, they have found themselves
in danger from these drugs.
What are the causes of the habitual use of
narcotic drugs ? A careful study of the causes
and of the subsequent development of addiction
to narcotic drugs shows that they may be
roughly classed in two groups.
First, there are the causes which are found
among the habitual opium smokers. These
addicts sought relief in narcotics when they
were forcibly deprived of opportunities of
opium smoking to which they were accustomed.
This fact may account for the total absence of
narcotic addicts among the opium smokers in
Formosa, where there exists a strict Govern-
ment control under which addicts are permitted
to smoke.
Secondly, there are the narcotic drug addicts
who must have gradually acquired the habit
largely by long-continued use of the narcotics
for remedial purposes, or who, for some other
incidental reasons, were led to abuse them.
If these observations are correct, we must
find a solution of the problem of the abuse of
narcotic drugs, not only in suppressive measures
for the control of the traffic in the drugs, but
also in a rational scheme for the treatment of
addicts who are already victims of the drug
habit.
In my personal opinion, we may effectively
solve the problem of dealing with the first
group, a problem intimately connected with
the policy of the suppression of opium smoking,
by adopting measures similar to those which
have been considered at the First Conference.
In regard to the second group, the nature
and extent of the social evil involved has
occupied the attention of the entire world and
it is clearly realised that this complicated
problem must be seriously considered. In
order to find a permanent solution, it would seem
necessary to adopt measures varying according
to different local conditions.
In a country where the narcotic drug problem
is an acute and grave one, measures may be
adopted, first, by means of strict control
and social education, to prevent people from
falling into the evil habit, and, secondly, to
treat adequately those who have already become
victims of the drugs.
The latter measures should have a direct
bearing on the clandestine use of drugs, which
are generally obtained by contraband. So
long as the narcotic drug addicts are left free
to indulge their propensities, the demand for
narcotic drugs, whatever preventive measures
we may take, will somehow be satisfied, just
as water inevitably finds its own level. Unless
rational measures are adopted to check the
demand, sooner or later there will be an
abundance of contraband supplies. Moreover,
it is essential, in the name of humanity, to
adopt rational measures for dealing with the
victims of the drugs, who othervise, sooner
or later, will find their satisfaction in drugs
illicitly obtained.
The real value of international agreement
depends on good-will and on the spirit of co-ope-
ration. There must be confidence in the good
faith of each of the signatory Powers assembled
here at the Conference if we are to reach an
effective arrangement for a solution of this
grave problem of narcotic drugs.
In this spirit the Japanese delegation moved,
by the same ideals which animate all delegations
assembled here, declares that it will co-operate
to the best of its ability towards the attain-
ment of the object of the Conference in
finding a solution for the problem of narcotic
drugs.
The President
Translation : M. Dendramis, delegate of
Greece, will address the Conference.
M. Dendramis (Greece)
Translation : Mr. President On behalf
of my Government, I have the honour to
submit a memorandum on the opium traffic
question. As the document will in due time
be distributed, I need not read it. Vide
Minutes of Sub-Committee F, Annex 2. I desire,
however, to state that the Greek Government
is at present considering the ways and means
of accelerating the progress of Greek legislation
in this matter, and it hopes that the experience
obtained as a result of the present Conference
and the resolutions adopted by it will furnish
invaluable assistance in developing further
legislative improvements.
I am confident that all countries represented
here are of a like mind.
I wish to state that my Government feels
great satisfaction in taking part in this Confe-
rence organised by the League, which has so
consistently endeavoured to promote the inte-
rests and ideals of mankind.
The establishment of the League of Nations
has resulted in an entirely new international
situation, and we must all feel deeply grateful
to the League for having paid special attention
to this problem and for having placed its social
and humanitarian work in the forefront of
its policy.
The Greek delegation sincerely hopes that
the endeavours of this Conference will be
crowned with complete success. [Applause.)


Translation : Will the Greek delegate be
good enough to give a copy of his memorandum
to the Secretariat ? It will then be roneoed,
translated into English, and distributed to the
delegates. It will be annexed to the record
of the present meeting.
The last speaker on my list, M. Chodzko,
delegate of Poland and of the Free City of
Danzig, will address the Conference.
IVI. Chodzko (Poland and the Free City of
Danzig)
Translation : The Polish Government, with
which is associated the Senate of the Free City
of Danzig, is desirous of co-operating energe-
tically in all humanitarian and social work of
international scope, and has accordingly decided
to take part in the discussions and assist in
the decisions of the Second International Opium
Conference, convened under the auspices of
the League of Nations with a view to averting
the ever-growing danger of moral and physical
degeneration due to the poisonous effects of
narcotic drugs.
Although there can be no question as regards
the good intentions of those who conceived
the Hague Convention of 1912, its stipulations
have been found ineffective for suppressing
this scourge. This, no doubt, was the consi-
deration which led the great author of the
Covenant of the League of Nations to entrust
to that body the duty of undertaking this task.
We may dwell with feelings of the greatest
satisfaction upon the enthusiasm shown by
the first Assembly of the League, which, by
its resolution of December 15th, 1920, paved
the way for this important work. In pursuance
of that resolution, there were set up a permanent
committee, namely, the Advisory Committee
on the Traffic in Opium, and a special section
in the Secretariat of the League. In the three
years that have elapsed since its creation, the
Advisory Committee has achieved a great deal
of preparatory work, for which it deserves our
thanks. It must, however, be frankly admitted
that the progress of its work has been handi-
capped in many matters owing to the absence
of representatives of non-producing countries
and of medical experts on the Committee.
The very greatest benefits have been derived
from the participation of representatives of
the United States of America in the Committee?s
proceedings and from the assistance given by
the League?s Health Committee, which the
Advisory Committee has consulted on various
medical points.
I need not say that, as the League, by virtue of
Article 23 of the Covenant, has assumed the
direction of and responsibility for the work,
the final goal of which is the suppression of
the abuse of narcotics, this difficult task can
only be brought to a successful conclusion
through the inspiration of the lofty humanitarian
and social principles upon which the League
tself is founded.
The question of narcotics is intimately con-
nected with that of the physical and moral
well-being of mankind, and cannot, therefore,
be treated either as a commercial or as an admi-
nistrative question, for these two aspects are
merely of secondary importance. It is a purely
medical and social problem. The only legi-
timate requirements as regards narcotics are
medical and scientific requirements. All others
?if such exist constitute abuses. This is
the general principle adopted by the Health
Committee of the League and is the principle on
which are based among others the Polish
law of June 22nd, 1923, on narcotics, and the
similar laws of the Free City of Danzig of
June 20th, 1920, and October 9th, 1924. Unless
this definite principle, which is the only equitable
one, be adopted, the work for which the League
has convened the present Conference is con-
demned to failure, while public opinion in all
countries will be sorely disillusioned and the
universal prestige enjoyed by the League will
suffer serious damage.
If there are abuses which, owing to the
varying conditions of life in the different
countries, can only be gradually suppressed
we must quite frankly admit the fact, and
point out the ways and means which we think
effective for rescuing as speedily as possible
the unhappy people who are the victims of
those abuses.
You will all agree that no State, no commu-
nity, no individual is entitled to found its pros-
perity upon the misfortunes of any human
being of whatever race, religion, or class.
The essential object, therefore, towards which
this Conference should direct its work is to
find a categorical definition of what we mean
by legitimate requirements as regards narcotics
and what we consider to be abuses.
That, in the view of my Government and of
the Free City, is the main consideration. It
is in the hope that this principle will be realised
that the Governments of Poland and Danzig
have instructed me to offer their warmest
wishes for the complete success of the work of
this important International Conference, wishes
with which they couple the expression of their
gratitude towards the League for convening
the Conference. {Applause.)
The President
Translation : There are no more speakers
on my list. We will therefore,, not prolong the
meeting to-day. The next meeting of the Confe-
rence will be held to-morrow morning, as an
exception at 11 o?clock, as the Drafting Com-
mittee has to meet before the Conference.
Normally, we shall meet at half-past ten.
The agenda includes the reports by the
Committee on the Rules of Procedure and by
the Committee on Credentials. After examining
these two reports, we shall resume the general
discussion, for which I have already one
speaker on my list.

THIRD MEETING
Held at Geneva on Wednesday, November 19 th, 1924, at 11 a.m.
CONTENTS :
13. Examination of the Report of the
Committee on Credentials.
14. Examination of the Report of the
Committee on the Rules of Proce-
dure.
President : M. Herluf Zahle.
13. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
THE COMMITTEE ON CREDENTIALS.
The President
Translation : Ladies and gentlemen
The first item on the agenda for the present
meeting is the consideration of the report of
the Committee on Credentials.
I will request the Vice-President, M. de
Aguero y Bethancourt, Rapporteur of the
Committee on Credentials, to take his place
upon the platform.
(;M. de Aguero y Bethancourt, Rapporteur of
the Committee on Credentials, took his place on
the platform.)
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba), Rap-
porteur, then read his report (Annex 4) and
concluded as follows ;
Translation : I wish to point out that I
have not mentioned all the delegates by name
in my report. The list would have been too
long and members may refer to the full list
which has already been distributed to each
delegate.
The Committee on Credentials trusts that
the Conference will approve the manner in
which it has examined the full powers conferred
by Governments on delegates and also the
resolution of the Committee.
The President
Translation : Does anyone wish to speak
on the report of the Committee on Credentials ?
As no one wishes to speak, I take it that you
approve the report.
The report of the Committee on Credentials
was adopted.
14. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
THE COMMITTEE ON THE RULES
OF PROCEDURE.
The President
Translation : We will now pass to the second
item on the agenda.
I will request Sir Malcolm Delevingne, Rap-
porteur of the Committee on the Rules of Pro-
cedure, to read his report.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Chairman and Rapporteur of the Committee
on the Rules of Procedure ;
As the report of the Committee on the Rules
of Procedure has been distributed to the Con-
ference both in French and in English (Annex 5),
I do not propose to read it, but I wish to draw
the attention of the Conference to the fact that,
by an inadvertence, at the end of the fourth para-
graph a blank has been left which must be filled
in in order to make the report complete. It
was intended to complete the sentence by an
addition in the same terms as the second para-
graph of Article 5. May I ask the Conference,
therefore, to read the report as though, in the
place where the blank appears, these words
were inserted ;
?To make proposals to the Conference for
the arrangement of the business of the
Conference, to nominate for the approval
of the Conference, should occasion arise,
the members of any Committee which shall
be constituted by the Conference, to exa-
mine and report on communications made
to the Conference by private organisations
or individuals, to approve of communiques
issued to the Press, and to consider and
report on any other matters which may be
referred to them by the Conference.?
With that addition, the report is complete.
There are only two matters on which I need
make any remarks. The first is the proposal
in the new Article 5 which the Committee has
suggested for the consideration of the Confe-
rence. That new article proposes the establish-
ment of a Business Committee. Its functions
are described in the words which I have just
read.
The purpose of the establishment of such a
Committee is twofold. In the first place, we
think it will facilitate the work of the Confe-
rence, as it will avoid, or at any rate shorten,
discussions which might possibly be very long
in the full Conference on matters which relate
only to the procedure or business of the Con-
ference. In the second place, the President has
been good enough to say that the appointment
of such a Committee will greatly assist him
in his heavy task of directing the work of the
Conference.
This proposal is not a novel one. It has
been adopted in other Conferences and has
been found to work very satisfactorily. In the
International Labour Conferences, which are
held at Geneva under the auspices of the
League of Nations, that method is always
adopted, and I can speak from personal expe-
rience as to its value.
The other matter to which I think it neces-
sary to refer arises on Article 11 of the revised
draft Article 10 in the original draft. A
difficulty arose in the First Opium Conference
as to the interpretation of the corresponding
article in the Rules of Procedure of that Confe-
rence, and the Committee has accordingly
re-drafted the original Article 10 in order to
make its meaning quite clear. We have also


made an amendment in the article which will allow me to speak, I may perhaps venture to
allow a motion or resolution which has not
been distributed beforehand to be discussed
if but only if the Conference agrees by
a unanimous vote.
The Committee hopes that the Conference will
approve its report and the revised draft rules
which it submits.
M. Clinchant (France)
Translation : I desire to propose a slight
modification in Rule 5. The number of mem-
bers of the Business Committee should be in-
creased from ten to eleven. My idea is not
merely to increase the number of representatives
on the Committee but to avoid offending the
superstitious. If the number is fixed at ten,
the total number of members, including the
President and two Vice-Presidents, will be
thirteen. If we adopt the number eleven, we
shall have fourteen members.
The President
Translation : I will request M. Clinchant to
be good enough to submit his amendment in wri-
ting in conformity with paragraph 2 of Rule 11.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I should like to make a
remark, which perhaps may not be of any great
importance', regarding the first paragraph of
Rule 1. This reads : ?delegates duly
supplied with plenipotentiary powers?. Accor-
ding to the decision which we have just adopted,
however, delegates, need only be in possession
of plenipotentiary powers when they come
to sign the Convention. There is here, I
think, an inconsistency. It would be better
to state that delegates must be furnished with
adequate powers ; this would conform with
the opinion of the Committee on Credentials.
I may add that if my proposal is not unanimously
accepted, I will withdraw it.
Secondly, the second paragraph of the same
rule reads : ?The delegate of each Government
may be accompanied by technical delegates.
These words convey the impression that each
Government may send only one delegate to
the Conference. The principle, however, has
been admitted that Governments may send
several delegates. The paragraph might be
re-drafted as follows : ?Each delegate may be
accompanied by technical delegates. .
IV!. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I wish to second the proposal
which has just been made by the delegate of
Spain. In the Committee appointed by the
Conference to consider the Rules of Procedure
I proposed the words ?delegates should be
furnished with the necessary powers?. The
other members of the Committee did not seem
to attach much importance to the matter and
I did not press my point. We have, however,
just approved the official report of the Committee
on Credentials, in which a distinction has been
drawn between powers and plenipotentiary
powers. It is then, I think, desirable, if not
essential, that the two texts should be consistent.
We should, therefore, adopt M. Palacios?
proposal and alter the text to read ?the
delegates duly furnished with powers?
or ?with the necessary powers?.
As the President has been good enough to
support also the proposal submitted just now
by the first French delegate, namely, that the
number of members of the Business Committee
should be eleven. Even with fourteen instead
of ten members, not all delegations will be
represented on the Committee. There is no
objection to this as a matter of principle, but
it might be found inconvenient if, taking, for
instance, the question of business procedure,
each delegation was unable to submit all the
proposals which it might think desirable for
the Conference. We can give each other this
assurance, namely, that all delegations repre-
sented on the Conference would, of course,
retain the right to submit proposals regarding
business procedure ; if therefore, proposals
are not examined by the Business Committee,
they may be raised at the plenary meeting.
Sir SVlalcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Chairman and Rapporteur of the Committee
on the Rules of Procedure :
The first suggestion made for the modification
of the revised rules was that of the delegate of
France. I have no objection whatever to his
desire to avoid the superstitious number of thir-
teen and, if the rest of the Conference shares his
fears, I am quite prepared to agree to the substi-
tution of eleven members for ten.
The second suggestion was that of the dele-
gate of Spain. The point ?he raised, as M.
Dinichert has said, was discussed in the Com-
mittee. It was also discussed at the First
Opium Conference. The First Conference de-
cided that the rule should stand as it appears
in this draft, and yesterday the Committee of
your Conference came to the same decision. The
point is one of real substance. The invitation
sent out by the Council of the League, on
the recommendation of the Assembly, was
that the Governments concerned ?should send
representatives with plenipotentiary powers to
a conference? (I quote from the text of
the Assembly resolution of September 27th,
I9 2 3).
This Conference was intended to be a Confe-
rence of delegates with plenipotentiary powers ;
each Government was invited to send a dele-
gation with those powers to meet delegations
from other Governments possessing similar
powers. In my opinion, therefore, we have no
power to draft, or at any rate it would create a
precedent if we drafted, our Rules of Procedure
so as to alter the constitution of the Confe-
rence.
The delegates of Spain and Switzerland re-
ferred to the fact that a number of the delegations
at present are only provided with ??pouvoirs?
and not with ?pleins pouvoirs?. The admis-
sion of delegates with simple powers instead
of full powers, however, was only intended,
I think, to be a temporary measure pending
the receipt by the delegations of the necessary
full powers, and it was also understood, I
think, that the full powers would be obtained
before the Conference was concluded and the
time arrived to sign a Convention. This seems
to me to be a satisfactory solution. All dele-
gations are admitted as they were at the First
Opium Conference, to take part in the proceed-
ings of the Conference on the simple nomination
of their Governments, but the full powers which
are contemplated by the invitation to the Con-
ference will be obtained, presumably, before


the close of the Conference and the signature examine the credentials to see which are in
of the Convention.
I therefore hope that the Conference will
decide to maintain this rule in its present form,
so as to permit of the compromise, which
worked very well in the First Conference, and
which, I imagine, will work equally well in the
Second Conference the arrangement by
which all delegations which have been duly ap-
pointed by their Governments to attend the
Conference will be admitted and have the right
to take full part in the discussion, on the
understanding that, before the close of the
Conference and the signature of the Conven-
tion, the necessary full powers will be obtained.
As regards M. Dinichert?s suggestion that,
if the Business Committee is appointed, it
should be understood that every delegation
retains its full right and liberty to submit
proposals in regard to the work of the Confe-
rence which it considers desirable, that, of
course, is understood. The Business Committee
is only designed to facilitate the work of the
Conference by allowing the consideration of
matters of business and procedure to take place,
as much as possible, in Committee, with the
full reservation to the Conference and to indi-
vidual delegations to pronounce on these
matters in plenary meeting.
[VI. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : The Japanese delegation ac-
cepts and warmly seconds everything which
has just been said by the delegate of the British
Empire.
IVI. Dinichert
Translation : I hardly like to press my
point, but if a question of this nature appears
to be worth consideration by the Conference
it had better be solved in a logical manner.
It is true that the letter of invitation from
the Council of the League invited our Govern-
ments to send delegates ?supplied with pleni-
potentiary powers?. So long as this, quali-
fication was considered to be rather a ques-
tion of drafting, there was no need to attach
great importance to it. It was for this reason
that I decided yesterday in the Committee not
to maintain my original proposal.
The delegate of the British Empire has just
told us that the question is one of principle.
If it is a question of principle, since the Committee
on Credentials has drawn a distinction between
?powers? and ?plenipotentiary powers?, we
must be logical and in that case must inform
delegates who only have ?powers? that they
are not qualified to take part in the Conference.
The Conference has just taken a contrary
decision. It has said that delegates who have
?powers? and those who have ?plenipotentiary
powers? are both admitted to the discussions,
that they are on an exactly identical footing
and that there is no distinction between dele-
gates of the first and second categories. The
question of principle should have been raised
when the Conference took this decision. It
cannot arise now since the Conference has de-
cided, on the advise of the Committee on Cre-
dentials, that both categories should be entitled
to take their seats here.
The Rules of Procedure which we are submit-
ting to the Conference will be the rules govern-
ing our discussions, it being understood that
when we come to sign a Convention we shall
order and which are not. If there is any
question of principle, it has been settled by your
acceptance just now of the report of the Com-
mittee on Credentials. Personally, lam not
raising a question of principle, but a question
of order, method and logic.
IV!. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I should be glad if I could
meet the wishes of the Chairman of the Com-
mittee on the Rules of Procedure by withdraw-
ing my proposal. Truth, however, compels
me to state that I am more and more con-
vinced that it should be adopted. The words
?delegates duly supplied with
the necessary powers? would be read as cover-
ing both plenipotentiary powers and other
powers. The words ?supplied with plenipo-
tentiary powers? cannot be retained in rules
which have to' be applied during the discus-
sions, and when the majority of members have
not been provided with plenipotentiary powers.
Thirteen members are supplied with plenipo-
tentiary powers and twenty-three with simple
powers ; the latter would, therefore, find them-
selves placed in a different position from that
of the other members, and, in my opinion,
this should be avoided.
The Chairman of the Committee on the
Rules of Procedure has referred to a precedent
which is perfectly legitimate and on which he
based his views. He has told us that the
First Opium Conference settled the question on
the lines which he proposes that we should
adopt. I fully realise the authoritative nature
of the decision taken b}/ the First Conference,
but I must state emphatically that I do not
regard myself as in any way bound by any
decision of that Conference. The present Confe-
rence, which is altogether different in composi-
tion, is free to settle the question at its own
discretion.
IVIr. Mac White (Irish Free State) ;
Translation : From a legal point of view,
we cannot, of course, make any alteration in the
wording of the rule. As, however, only thirteen
countries have sent delegates who are furnished
with plenipotentiary powers, I would enquire
what will be the position, at the end of the
Conference, of those delegates wdio have not
been furnished with plenipotentiary powers ?
IV3. Comnene (Roumania)
Translation : Gentlemen I wish to dwell,
though quite briefly, on one point. It would,
I think, be extremely dangerous to make, as
the Swiss delegate has just said, a distinction
between the delegates, that is to say, to lay
down which of them will and which will
not be entitled to speak during the discussions
in the various Committees.
There can be no doubt that only delegates
who have plenipotentiary powers can sign a
Convention. Consequently, when the time
comes for signing the Convention, we shall have
to enquire whether each delegate affixing his
signature to the document is in possession of
plenipotentiary powers or no.
May I remind the Chairman of the Committee
who has on several occasions been one of
the most valuable members of the Inter-
national Labour Conference, and who has
been instrumental in getting adopted a very


large number of Conventions as well as recom- to their Governments for such powers.
mendations that the majority of the dele-
gates taking part in that Conference were not
provided with plenipotentiary powers, but
merely with letters either from their respective
Governments or from their accredited Legations
in Switzerland.
I had the honour to be the Chairman of the
Committee on Credentials at the last Assem-
bly of the League, and I had occasion to note
once again that this principle was confirmed.
It would, therefore, in my opinion, be positively
dangerous to call in question a matter which
has been unanimously accepted by the Members
of the League.
The President
Translation : The Chairman of the Com-
mittee on Credentials, who has had great expe-
rience in this matter in the Assemblies of the
League, will address the Conference.
IVI. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba), Vice-
President :
Translation : Being, as the Chairman has
said, the senior member here, I may perhaps
venture to draw the attention of the Conference
to this question, the intricacy of which has
been pointed out by M. Dinichert and M.
Comnene.
It is extremely difficult to make a distinction,
and even more difficult to accept one, between
the delegates present at the Conference. They
represent Governments which are equal in the
eyes of international law. Therefore, all dele-
gates present are equal.
As regards the distinction between plenipo-
tentiary powers and powers, I may point out
that the Committee on Credentials merely
recognised a de facto situation. Some Govern-
ments have furnished their delegates with
plenipotentiary powers, while others have merely
appointed a representative. The fact is not
unprecedented. I have frequently come across it,
having for five years acted as Chairman of the
Committee on Credentials during the Assemblies
of the League.
The following procedure was adopted on
those occasions. Delegates furnished with ple-
nipotentiary powers signed the Conventions,
while those who were merely appointed as
representatiues of their Governments applied
to the latter for the necessary plenipotentiary
powers. In support of what I have just said, I
will refer you to the report of the Committee on
Credentials, in which the following paragraph
occurs :
?The Committee for the examination
of credentials considers that all the dele-
gates whose names appear above are duly
authorised to represent their countries at
the Conference. The Committee presumes
that, prior to the signature of any convention
or agreement which may be adopted by the
Conference, delegates not yet in possession
of their full powers will obtain the necessary
authorisation to that effect from their
Governments.?
Delegates present at the Conference are
undoubtedly on an equal footing, they have
the right to take part in the proceedings and
to state their views, but, if a Convention is to
be signed, those in possession of plenipotentiary
powers will sign it and the others will then apply
cannot be argued that delegates who are accre-
dited by their Governments are unable to take
an active part in the proceedings of the Confe-
rence or sign a Convention. It is for them to
regularise their position, and the Conference
has no need to deal with details of this nature.
M. Buero (Uruguay)
Translation : Mr. President I will not
occupy the attention of the meeting for more
than a few moments, but I wish to support the
remarks just made by M. de Palacios, M. Dini-
chert, M. Comnene and also M. de Aguero,
as regards the discrepancy between the deci-
sion which we have just taken on the report
of the Committee of Credentials and Article I
of the report on the Rules of Procedure.
At the same time, I should like to make
more precise one point to which M. de Aguero
referred. He told us just now that the Com-
mittee on Credentials had examined the papers
forwarded by the Government and found, for
example, that one Government appointed M. X.
as delegate and another, M. Y, as delegate
with full powers. I think there is some slight
confusion here. I may observe that full powers
are conferred by an instrument which may fol-
low the appointment of the delegates. Although
I do not speak with the authority of a veteran
like M. de Aguero, I may say that it has fre-
quently happened at committees or confe-
rences in which I have taken part that a Govern-
ment has appointed as its delegate a minister,
an ambassador or an attache and that only
some eight to ten days later has it forwarded
the document empowering its delegate to sign
the Convention.
I think, therefore, Mr. President, that this
consideration is in favour of the solution
proposed by M. de Palacios because it is cus-
tomary in the case of all Conventions to fix a
certain date, even subsequent to the closing
of the Conference, by which members who have
sat on Committees or Conferences may receive
full powers to sign the Convention.
In these circumstances, a Convention, if
we are able to conclude one, may be accepted
and voted by the majority of the delegates
here present, whatever their powers, and may
be signed by the delegates furnished with full
powers and also by those who receive these
powers later.
I consider that the solution proposed by M. de
Palacios is fair and reconciles the various
points of view by laying down that the
delegate must be provided with the necessary
powers, and by necessary powers we under-
stand, in the first place, the powers necessary
for discussion.
IV!. Ferreira (Portugal)
Translation : Ido not claim to elucidate
the question entirely, but I venture to submit
to you my point of view in the form of a short
illustration. Suppose that three travellers take
the train for Berne ; each of them takes a
ticket, one first class, another second class,
and the third, third class. All three travellers
have full powers to proceed to Berne, but in
order to eat in the restaurant they require
special full powers.
The President
Translation: As there are no other speakers.
?? 26


on the list, I declare the discussion closed and nor, I think, will there be any tendency to regard
I call upon Sir Malcolm Delevingne, Chairman
of the Committee on the Rules of Procedure,
to address the Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Chairman and Rapporteur of the Committee
on the Rules of Procedure :
My feeling is that too much importance has
been attached to this point. Whichever way
the matter is decided, the work of the Conte-
rence will proceed on exactly the same lines.
A similar situation arises, I believe, at almost
every International Conference which, like this
Conference, is assembled for the purpose of
arriving at a Convention or an Agreement.
There are always some delegates who arrive
without their full powers, and whose full
powers do not turn up till quite late in the
proceedings. No difficulty is ever raised. They
have been nominated by their Governments,
it is presumed that the full powers will come,
and they are regarded, if not as actual pleni-
potentiaries, as potential plenipotentiaries.
This is surely the situation here. The Council
has invited the Governments to send plenipo-
tentiaries ; the Governments represented here
have accepted that invitation and have sent
delegates. We presume that, if their full powers
are not here yet, they will eventually be here.
The delegates are plenipotentiaries potentially,
if they are not actually.
I think the delegate from Spain repudiated
the precedent which I quoted, namely, the deci-
sion of the First Opium Conference. Of course,
I had no desire to suggest that the present
Conference was bound by any precedent what-
ever. I merely quoted it as one of many
instances. lam informed, and I believe it is
the case, that the course which your Committee
has ventured to recommend is supported by
numerous precedents ; in fact, it is, I think,
the usual procedure.
Certain precedents were quoted on the other
side by the delegate of Roumania and by our
Vice-President. The delegate of Roumania
referred to the International Labour Conference ;
our Vice-President referred, among other bodies,
to the Assemblies of the League. It seems to
me that in neither case do we get an exact
parallel to our own situation.
The International Labour Conference is not
a Conference of plenipotentiaries ; it does not
meet to sign Conventions. It meets to adopt
draft Conventions under an entirely different
procedure, which was especially established
by the Labour Chapter of the Treaty of Peace
of Versailles. There is therefore no question
of sending delegates with plenipotentiary powers
in the case of the International Labour Confe-
rence.
In the case of the Assembly, I think it is much
the same. The delegates to the Assembly
do not come with the same object as that which
we have in view here. We are assembled to
conclude, if possible, an Agreement, and that
Agreement, if concluded, will be signed by all
those who approve it. This is not what takes
place generally speaking at an Assembly
of the League.
If the suggestion of your Committee is
adopted, there will be no danger at any rate, in
my view, and I thought it was the view of
all the members of the Committee until M.
Dinichert spoke of there being two categories,
a delegate who has not yet received his full
powers as only a third-class passenger. Every-
body will be on the same footing ; everybody
will be regarded, as I said just now, as a poten-
tial plenipotentiary, and in practice no diffi-
culty, no inconvenience, will, I am convinced,
arise.
Xt was suggested, I think, by our Vice-Pre-
sident that we can very well wait for the full
powers till the Convention is ready for signa-
ture or, at any rate, till towards the end of the
Conference. I do not quite see how delegations
who come from the other end of the world are
to obtain their full powers if they wait till the
end of the Conference. I think there is here
a practical difficulty which emphasises the
importance of full powers being obtained as
early as possible.
I appeal to the delegate of Spain not to press
his suggestion. I personally regard this matter
as a real question of principle, as I explained
in my previous remarks. We are summoned
as a Conference of plenipotentiaries. The invi-
tation was sent to each Government in that
sense. I submit, with all respect to the Confe-
rence, that it does not rest with us to alter the
constitution of the Conference. We ought to
meet one another on the basis of perfect equa-
lity, and we shall, I think, meet one another
on that basis if we treat the Conference as
a Conference of plenipotentiaries, assuming, as
we are entitled to assume, that those delegates
which have not yet received their full powers
will receive them before the end of the Confe-
rence.
As I said just now, we have ample precedent
for adopting this course. Precedents are not
always logical, but they are very convenient ;
and if we once get entangled in the meshes of
logic I am afraid it will be a long time before
we get out.
I therefore appeal to the Spanish delegate to
be so good as to avoid pushing the matter to
a vote, because I am sure some of us would
feel obliged to maintain the point of view of
your Committee. The Committee has consi-
dered the point very carefully, and I think it
will be more generally satisfactory if no vote
is taken but the matter is allowed to drop, on
the understanding which I have mentioned.
The President
Translation : I will now sum up the dis-
cussion. We have before us three different
proposals :
First, the proposal of the French delegation,
to raise the number of the members of the
Business Committee provided for in Rule 5,
from ten to eleven.
I take it that this amendment has been
accepted by the Chairman of the Committee
on the Rules of Procedure and by the Committee
itself, and that there is therefore no necessity
to vote upon it.
Secondly, there is the proposal of the Spanish
delegation, to modify the second paragraph of
Rule 1 as follows : ?Each delegate may be
accompanied by technical delegates?.
This modification, too, I consider to have been
adopted by the Chairman of the Committee
and there is therefore no need to vote upon it.
Before I speak of the other proposal of the
Spanish delegate, which has given rise to some
discussion, the Chairman of the Committee


Conference.
There remains the hrst proposal of the Spanish
delegation, which refers to the hrst paragraph
of Rule i. The wording proposed by the
Committee on the Rules of Procedure is as
follows : ?delegates supplied with pleni-
will allow me to draw the Committee?s attention
to the second paragraph of Rule 5. This
paragraph enumerates the functions of the
Business Committee and contains these words :
?To report to the Conference to
approve all communiques issued to the Press .
This formula seems to me to be too wide. The
meetings of the Conference are public, the Press
is present, and it seems to me very difficult,
if not impossible, to restrict the rights of the
Press to the records of the official meetings.
The Committee, in using this phrase, was
thinking perhaps of the communiques sent to
the Press, which do not consist of records of
the meetings. I should be glad of an expla-
nation on this point.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Chairman and Rapporteur of the Committee
on the Rules of Procedure :
There was, of course, no intention on the part
of the Committee to interfere in any way with the
full liberty of the Press to send to their organs
whatever accounts they chose of the proceedings
at the plenary meetings of the Conference
which are, of course, open to the Press, as are the
Verbatim Reports prepared by the Secretariat.
What the Committee had in mind was that, if
communiques are issued to the Press by the
Conference, those communiques should be sub-
mitted to and approved by the Business Com-
mittee. I believe your Committee on the Rules
of Procedure attached importance to a full
and authoritative communique of the proceed-
ings of the Conference being given to the Press
that is, communiques issued to the Press
for use if they so desire ; communiques of the
proceedings of the Conference which would be
authoritative. This was the intention of the
Committee. Its proposal was not designed in
any way to interfere with the liberty of the
Press. We have, of course, no power whatever
to do that.
The President
Translation : Ido not yet quite understand.
Does the Committee intend that this paragraph
should refer to the communiques issued by
the Information Section of the Secretariat
and sent to the countries or newspapers which
are not represented here ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Chairman and Rapporteur of the Committee
on the Rules of Procedure :
Yes, I think the Committee had in mind any
communication issued officially by the Secreta-
riat. We were not distinguishing between the
different organs of the Secretariat, which we
regarded as one indivisible whole for this purpose.
We thought that any communications issued
officially to the Press by the Secretariat should
be examined and approved by the Business
Committee.
The President
Translation : It is not for me to express an
opinion on this matter, but I am somewhat
doubtful. It will involve a considerable amount
of work, which will have to be performed at
great speed and which may be unnecessary
ninety-nine times out of a hundred. This duty
will, I think, be difficult to carry out in accor-
dance with the interpretation of the Chairman
of the Committee, but I am prepared to acquiesce.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Chairman and Rapporteur of the Committee
on the Rules of Procedure :
That point was raised and discussed in the
Committee, and we all agreed that in those
cases where it was not convenient for the
Business Committee to meet, the task of
approving the communiques to the Press should
be entrusted to the President of the Confe-
rence, if he were willing to undertake it.
M. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation : In my opinion, the Conference
should not be in any way dependent upon the
Business Committee. The Plenary Conference
must be supreme in the matters with which it
has to deal. We have full freedom of action
in the important task entrusted to us.
The President
Translation : Ido not think it is necessary
to open a general discussion on this point. I
would draw the attention of the Japanese
delegate to the fact that the intention of the
Committee on the Rules of Procedure was
certainly not that which he has imputed to it.
The second paragraph of the new Rule 5 says ;
?The functions of the Committee shall be to
make proposals to the Conference.? It will
therefore make proposals to the Conference
and the latter will decide on its own authority
upon any action to be taken in regard to those
proposals. The function of the Business Com-
mittee is, in fact, to organise the work of the
potentiary powers?. The text proposed by the
Spanish delegation runs ; ?delegates.... sup-
plied with the necessary powers?. As this
amendment has been discussed at length by the
Conference, the only method of settling the
question is to put it to the vote.
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : I would express to Sir Malcolm
Delevingne once more my regret at being
unable to withdraw my proposal. The words
?the necessary powers? do not exclude full
powers.
The President
Translation : I propose to put the Spanish
amendment to the vote. Shall we vote by
roll-call or by members rising in their seats ?
M. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : lam against putting this
question to the vote. We can find a suitable
solution by friendly agreement. Lucidity is,
undoubtedly, a special attribute of the great
Spanish nation, as everybody knows. But there
are times when we must acknowledge the
common-sense which characterises the British.
With the help of a conciliatory spirit, we
can all agree to enter upon an active campaign
against this scourge of the illicit use of opium.
The representatives of all civilised Governments
are animated by the same desire and without
voting we can arrive at an agreement if we
adopt the rules as they now stand.


IVI. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : I have been very much touched
by the words of the Japanese delegate. But
I am disappointed. I had hoped, from the
conciliatory spirit which M. Sugimura always
brings to the work of the League, that he would
propose to us a suitable formula which would
reconcile the Committee?s point of view with
my own. He has perhaps forgotten to submit
this formula to us. If he has found it, I shall
be glad to accept it.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba), Vice-
President :
Translation : I desire to make a direct
appeal to that British common-sense to which
our Japanese colleague has just referred. Does
not Sir Malcolm Deievingne consider that the
French wording ?pouvoirs necessaires? includes
full powers and other powers ? The words
?necessary powers? include everything. If we
simply say "supplied with plenipotentiary
powers?, the delegates who are only furnished
with simple powers and who will be permitted
to join in the discussion with us will feel them-
selves at a disadvantage if it has been decided
that full powers are required.
The phrase ?necessary powers? is general.
It includes every kind of powers, whereas the
phrase ?full powers? is specific, since it only
refers to one particular kind.
The President
Translation : I did not wish to interrupt
the Vice-President, but the discussion on the
general question is closed. If anyone wishes
to address an appeal to M. de Palacios or Sir
Malcolm Deievingne, I will grant their request
to speak, but only in this case.
M. Veverka (Czechoslovakia)
Translation : I ask leave to speak on
a point of order. I fear that this discussion is
beginning to have a dangerous and narcotic
effect, and I suggest that the question be re-
ferred back to the Committee.
IVS. Dendramis (Greece)
Translation : I have the honour to suggest
the following motion, which will, I hope, be
acceptable to both delegations. I propose that
the wording shall be as follows ; ?delegates. . . .
supplied with powers for the work of the Confe-
rence and with full powers to sign any agree-
ments which may be concluded as a result of
the work of the Conference?.
The President
Translation : Before we continue the discus-
sion, we must take a decision with regard to
the proposal of the Czechoslovak delegate
that the question be referred back to the
Committee.
Sir IVlalcoim Deievingne (British Empire),
Chairman and Rapporteur of the Committee
on the Rules of Procedure ;
I heartily support the suggestion of the dele-
gate of Czechoslovakia. The Conference must
be heartily tired of this discussion, and his
suggestion appears to be the best way out
of the difficulty. In the interval we shall be
able to discuss the matter with the distin-
guished delegate of Spain and arrive at a solution
which will be generally satisfactory.
The President
Translation : If the Conference agrees, I
for my part accept the referring back of this
question to the Committee. Have any dele-
gations any objections to the Czechoslovak
proposal ?
The proposal to refer the question hack to the
Committee was unanimously adopted by the
Conference.
The Conference rose at 1.5 p.m.

15. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
THE COMMITTEE ON THE RULES
OF PROCEDURE : CONTINUATION
OF THE DISCUSSION : ADOPTION OF
THE RULES OF PROCEDURE.
The President
Translation : In pursuance of the decision
taken by the Conference at the end of this
morning?s meeting, the revised draft of the
Rules of Procedure was referred back to the
Committee which had prepared it. This Com-
mittee has since met and I call upon Sir Malcolm
Deievingne, Chairman of the Committee, to


inform the Conference of the conclusions
reached.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Chairman and Rapporteur of the Committee on
the Rules of Procedure :
Mr. President, the Committee has unanimously
agreed to recommend that the Conference should
settle the question by omitting paragraph i
of Rule i regarding which the difficulty arose.
This solution cuts the Cxordian knot, but we
are all agreed that it is the best way out of
the difficulty.
The President
Translation : Does anyone wish to speak ?
If no one wishes to speak, I shall declare the
debate on the draft Rules of Procedure closed
and we will proceed to the vote.
Ihe first paragraph of Rule i is suppressed,
while the Spanish delegation?s amendment, to
the effect that the first sentence of paragraph 2
of Rule 1 should read : ?Each delegate may
be accompanied by technical delegates ?,
and the French delegation?s amendment, to
the effect that the number of members of the
Business Committee should be increased from
ten to eleven (Rule 5, first paragraph), may be
regarded as adopted.
It is not possible to distribute copies of the
revised rules before we vote, but I think that
all my colleagues know on what the vote will
be taken, namely, the draft Rules of Procedure,
with the amendments which I have just men-
tioned.
M. Buero (Uruguay)
Translation : I should like to ask for an
explanation regarding the Committee mentioned
in Rule 5 of the Rules of Procedure. As the
Committee on the Rules of Procedure has given
no reason for the creation of this Committee
and no information regarding the scope of its
work, I should like to know what its exact
duties will be. I ask this question because
the majority of the countries will not be repre-
sented on this Committee since the number
of members has been fixed at fourteen
and they will therefore be left out of the dis-
cussions. I shall consider my apprehensions
more or less justified according to the extent
of this Committee?s duties.
Before the draft Rules of Procedure are put
to the vote, I would therefore like to ask the
Rapporteur of the Committee to give us some
explanation on this point. I reserve the right
after hearing his explanations, either to propose
an amendment or to accept the rule as it stands.
The President
Translation : I thought that the discussion
on this point, which has already been raised
by the Japanese delegate, had been concluded.
When the Japanese delegate raised the question,
I made a reply which he accepted ; moreover,
the duties of this Committee seem to me to be
sufficiently clearly explained in the text of
the rule.
As the first delegate of Uruguay desires
further explanations, however, I will ask Sir
Malcolm Delevingne to give them after M.
de Aguero y Bethancourt has spoken.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba), Vice
President :
Translation : I ask the President to correct
me if I am wrong, but I understand that the
discussion on the draft rules is not yet closed
and that members are still entitled to submit
observations thereon.
The President
Translation : It is for the Conference to
decide.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba), Vice-
President :
7 ranslation : I asked the President if
he had closed the discussion, as he had said
that we were going to vote on the draft Rules of
Procedure, together with the amendments men-
tioned. All the articles, however, have not
yet been discussed. We have merely discussed
the amendments submitted by the French and
Spanish delegations and the reply made by
Sir Malcolm Delevingne.
For my part, I had an observation to put
forward, which I had no time to make this
morning. It concerns the Business Committee?s
right of approving all communiques issued to
the Press. I would like to ask Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne to what Press communiques this sentence
refers. Is the Business Committee going to
approve the records of the meetings ? The
Press, of course, attends all the meetings, since
they are public. As certain journalists will
be able to send reports to their papers quite
freely without having them passed by this
Committee, why must journalists who are
unable to attend all the meetings obtain the
Committee?s sanction ? If they have to wire
to their papers, they are placed at a disadvan-
tage on account of the time they will lose.
All journalists ought to be placed on an equal
footing, and we ought not to raise any difficulties.
At all the Conferences and Assemblies the
Information Section of the Secretariat of the
Teague has always been allowed to give infor-
mation to journalists asking for it. By adopting
the procedure proposed in Rule 5, we shall be
delaying the communications of journalists
who have been unable to attend our meetings.
Our work is of such humanitarian importance
that it ought to be known throughout the world.
Public opinion should be kept accurately
informed of the progress of our work. Why
create difficulties ?
I wish to ask the Chairman of the Committee
on the Rules of Procedure to what kind of
communique the sentence in Rule 5 refers.
{Applause.)
The President
Translation : Before calling upon Sir Malcolm
Delevingne, I would request the members of
the Conference to bring forward all the questions
they wish to ask, in order that the Chairman
of the Committee may answer them all together.
M. Clinchant (France)
1 ranslation : I entirely agree with the honour-
able delegate of Cuba. I ask that the proce-
dure which has always been followed since the
Feague of Nations came into existence should
continue to be observed and that the commu-
nique should be drafted by the Information
Section in the usual way.
M. von Eckardt (Germany) :
Translation : In view of the wishes expressed
by the representatives of the German Press


attending this Conference, I wish to associate
myself with the Cuban delegate?s proposal.
{Applause.)
The President
Translation : Does any other delegate wish
to speak on this question or on any other point
connected with the Rules of Procedure ?
IVI. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : As the discussion is still open,
I would like to draw my colleagues? attention
to a question which appears to be one of form,
but which may easily turn out to be a question
of principle.
This morning we unanimously approved the
French delegate?s proposal to increase the num-
ber of members of the Business Committee to
fourteen. This decision was adopted unani-
mously and we cannot go back on it. I would
like to draw the Conference?s attention, however,
to the possibility of there being an equality
of votes. In this eventuality, I propose that,
the Chairman should have the casting vote.
The President
Translation : Does the delegate of Italy
ask for an amendment of the text on this point
or does he regard the statement he has made
as a kind of official interpretation ?
IVI. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : I regard it as an interpreta-
tion. There is no need to make an amendment
in the text.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Chairman and Rapporteur of the Committee
on the Rules of Procedure :
I think it is rather hard on the unfortunate
Chairman of your Committee on the Rules of
Procedure that he should be asked to explain
and re-explain the same point. In my opening
remarks this morning, and in subsequent remarks
which I had to make in reply to questions from
the Chair and from other delegates, I dealt with
all the points which have been raised this
afternoon, except the last point raised by the
delegate of Italy.
I attempted to explain in a few words the
scope of the Committee proposed under Rule 5.
I do not think I can add anything, as regards
this point, to what, I said this morning. It
seems to me that the wording of Rule 5 is
perfectly clear. There is no intention of allow-
ing this Business Committee to usurp the
functions of the Conference. It is merely an
organ of the Conference. Its proposals
and they will only be proposals in regard
to the arrangements of business will be submitted
to the Conference for its approval, so that
every delegation will have the full right and
every opportunity of expressing its views
on any matter on which the Business Committee
may have a suggestion to make. Surely the
rights and the sovereign Powers of this Confe-
rence are thereby amply safeguarded.
As regards the point which has been raised
by the delegate of Cuba, I gave an explanation
this morning in reply to an enquiry from the
Chair. I said that the Committee on the
Rules of Procedure desired that the official
communiques of the proceedings of this Confe-
rence should be authoritative in the best
sense, that is, that the world should be given
every day an official account, an official resume,
of the proceedings of the Conference which
would be authoritative.
We all know that Press reports are not always
as full as they might be, and they do not
always give a really accurate summing up
of what has taken place. Sometimes promi-
nence is given to the picturesque incidents
rather than to the real business ; and the
Committee thought it useful, important indeed,
that an authoritative communique on what is
done here should be issued to the world every
day.
There is no question at all, as I said this
morning, of our interfering with the liberties
of the representatives of the Press. 1 see no
objection to the representatives of the Press
who cannot spend all the day here applying
for information as to what has taken place ;
but the point upon which the Committee desired
to insist was that the official communique of
the proceedings of the day should be authori-
tative, and for that purpose should be reviewed
by the Business Committee. We thought,
however, that when the Business Committee
was not sitting the communique might be
reviewed by our President, if he was prepared
to undertake the task. I should have thought
that this explanation would meet the point
raised by the delegate of Cuba and would also
meet the wishes of the journalists.
As regards the point raised by the delegate
of Italy, I do not think I am competent to
express an opinion. I should have thought,
according to the ordinary Rules of Procedure,
that the President would not vote except
when there was an equality of votes, and there
cannot of course be an equality of votes when
there are only thirteen members in addition
to the President, unless somebody abstains.
As I say, however, that is not a question for
me to decide. It is rather, I think, a question
of the usual procedure of Committees of this
kind. I should have thought that it was not
necessary to make any provision about it
in the Rules of Procedure.
The President
Translation : As the Chairman of the Com-
mittee on the Rules of Procedure has referred
to me in connection with the official communique
to the Press, I will venture to make a few
remarks. It is very difficult for me, as Pre-
sident, to take, an absolutely impartial view of
this question, because it seems to me that, in
practice, the programme outlined by the Chair-
man of the Committee will be very difficult
to carry out.
The morning plenary meetings close at about
1.15 p.m. To make a report of the meeting,
notes must be taken, dictated, and submitted
to a ? responsible member of the Information
Section. This would take half-an-hour or
three-quarters of an hour. Obviously, the
Business Committee cannot sit three-quarters
of an hour after the end of each meeting to
wait for the communique. It would be asking
too much of the President, not only from the
point of view of work but from that of respon-
sibility. The same applies to the afternoon
meetings. We shall probably rise towards
7.30 p.m. What is proposed is materially
almost impossible. I ventured to draw the
Chairman?s attention to this point at this
morning?s meeting.


I am perfectly certain that the reason for
which this question was raised by the Business
Committee is that the communiques issued by
the Information Section have not always been
found satisfactory ; this may be true, but I
am no judge of the matter.
If the Conference asks the Secretariat to
draft its communiques in a more satisfactory
way, it seems to me that they would then meet
with general approval. If a serious mistake
is made, it can always be corrected by a fresh
communique. The Conference is not now res-
ponsible for the communiques, but it would
be if we adopted the proposed text. I repeat
that the work will be exceedingly difficult
and, in the long run, impossible.
SVI. von Eckardt (Germany) :
Translation : We might very well dispense
at the beginning with an official communique.
If in practice we meet with difficulties, we can
always reconsider the question.
Sir IVlalcoSm Delevingne (British Empire),
Chairman and Rapporteur of the Committee
on the Rules of Procedure :
If the other members of the Committee on
the Rules of Procedure agree, I suggest that
the words relating to the communiques in
Rule 5 be omitted.
The President
Translation : It is proposed to strike out
the words "to approve all communiques issued
to the Press?.
Does any member object to this proposal ?
IVI. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba), Vice-
President :
Translation : This is what I myself would pro-
pose, and I am very grateful to the British
delegate for this suggestion.
The President
Translation : The debate on the Rules of
Procedure is closed.
We are all acquainted with the text on which
we are about to vote. I do not think we need
vote by roll-call or by delegates rising in their
seats.
If there is no objection, I take it that the
Conference unanimously accepts the Rules of
Procedure as now amended.
The Rules of Procedure were adopted by the
Conference. (Annex 5 a).
16. CONSTITUTION AND APPOINTM ENT OF
THE BUSINESS COIVIIVHTTEE.
The President
Translation : Rule sof the Rules of Pro-
cedure lays down that a Business Committee
shall be appointed by the Conference, consisting
of the President of the Conference, the two
Vice-Presidents and eleven other members.
As this Business Committee is the most
important organ of the Conference, I think
we should appoint it as soon as possible. We
have therefore to elect eleven persons. There
should be no voting for countries.
I think the best procedure will be to vote
by secret ballot. I will therefore ask the first
delegate of each Government to write down
the names of eleven persons on his voting paper.
M. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : If we are going to vote for
individuals rather than for States, I would like
to propose that the Conference should adjourn
for live minutes in order that the delegations
may be able to think over the names they
wish to propose.
M. Clinchant (France)
Translation : I would like to propose that we
should not vote for persons but for countries.
The delegations elected can then decide which
of their members will serve on the Business
Committee.
jVI. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba), Vice-
President :
Translation : I would like to point out that
the method of voting for persons presents cer-
tain disadvantages. The different members of the
delegations do not yet know each other very well,
but everyone knows which countries are most
interested in the opium problem. In my opi-
nion, it would therefore be better to elect coun-
tries and each delegation can then choose the
member it considers most competent to serve
on the Committee.
IV!. Comnene (Roumania)
Translation : I entirely agree with the pro-
posal put forward by M. Clinchant and M. de
Aguero for the reasons they have stated and
also because in each delegation some of the
members are more expert than others in this
subject. Again, the question might be raised
as to whether a delegation is or is not entitled
to send another delegate, who was more compe-
tent do deal with any particular problem, to
sit on the Business Committee.
I would therefore also like to propose that
we should vote for countries, and that each
delegation should then inform the President
which of its members will serve on the Business
Committee, while retaining the right to replace
him by the member most competent to discuss
any given question on the agenda.
The President
Translation : I would like to ask for an
explanation. Does the French delegate?s pro-
posal mean that the delegation elected can
appoint its member on the Business Committee
once and for all, or does it mean that it can
appoint a different member for each question ?
IVI. Clinchant (France)
Translation : When the delegation has been
elected, it can depute any one of its members
to serve on the Committee.
The President
Translation : I take it that the French, Cuban
and Roumanian delegates are voicing the
general opinion of the Conference, to which
I willingly defer. The voting will therefore
be for countries.
Does the Polish delegate stand by his pro-
posal ?
IVI. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I do.
The President
Translation : M. Chodzko?s proposal is
that the meeting should adjourn for five minutes.
Does the Conference agree? {Assent.)

Mr. Campbell (India)
Before we separate, there is one point I should
like to have made clear. I understand that
we have eleven votes, but that not more than
one vote can be given to any one country. Is
that correct ?
The President
Translation : That is quite correct.
{1 he Conference adjourned for five minutes)
The President
Translation : In conformity with the usual
procedure of the Assembly of the League, I
will appoint two tellers. I propose Mr. Beland,
first delegate of Canada, and M. Comnene, first
delegate of Roumania. I will ask these two
gentlemen to be good enough to take their
places near the ballot box.
Before we proceed to the vote, I will read
you the Rules of Procedure regarding the secret
ballot as followed by the Assembly :
"When a number of elective places of
the same nature are to be filled at one time,
those persons who obtain an absolute
majority at the first ballot shall be elected.
If the number of persons obtaining such
majority is less than the number of persons
to be elected, there shall be a second ballot
to fill the remaining places, the voting
being restricted to the unsuccessful can-
didates who obtained the greatest number
of votes at the first ballot, not more than
double in number the places remaining to
be filled. Those candidates, to the number
required to be elected, who receive the
greatest number of votes at the second
ballot, shall be declared elected.?
I take it that you are prepared to accept
these rules. We will now proceed to the roll-
call of the different countries.
The roll of the delegations was called.
The President
Translation : The result of the voting is
as follows : 39 delegations voted and the
absolute majority is therefore 20. The following
countries obtained an absolute majority at
the first ballot and are therefore elected members
As the Business Committee is to consist of
eleven members and as only ten have been elec-
ted at the first ballot, a second ballot must
be held for the election of the eleventh member.
After the countries which I have just named,
the following countries obtained most votes :
while a number of other countries received
isolated votes.
According to the Rules of Procedure which
we have just adopted, a second ballot must
be held.
As there remains one place to be filled, this
ballot must be taken on the two candidates
who obtained the greatest number of votes ;
in this case, Spain and Bolivia.
We will therefore proceed to a second ballot.
I will ask the Secretary to be good enough to
call the roll of States.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I thank the delegations which
voted for Spain, but I would like to ask
them to vote this time for Bolivia. Bolivia
is more interested in this question than Spain,
and Spain will consider herself to be very well
represented on the Committee by Bolivia.
The President
Translation : In that case it is doubtful
whether a ballot is necessary. The Rules of
Procedure, however, leave no alternative, and
we will proceed to a second ballot if no proposal
is made to the contrary.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba), Vice-
President :
Translation : As M. de Palacios has with-
drawn in favour of Bolivia, and considers that
she will worthily represent Spain, it seems to
me that the question is settled and that a
second ballot is unnecessary.
The President
Translation : Unless M. de Palacios? pro-
posal is unanimously accepted, I must hold a
second ballot.
Have any delegates any objections to make ?
As there is no objection, I declare the ten
countries mentioned above, together with Boli-
via, elected members of the Business Committee.
M. Pinto-Escalier (Bolivia) :
I would like to thank M. de Palacios most
warmly for the honour he has done my country
by withdrawing in its favour. I also want to
thank all the delegates who supported the
Spanish delegate?s proposal.
The President
Translation : The Business Committee is
thus constituted according to the procedure
adopted.
I now ask each delegation elected to appoint
its member on this Committee. The final consti-
tution of the Business Committee will be settled
in this room at the close of this afternoon?s

17. PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION ON THE
BASIS OF THESERIESOF MEASURES
ADOPTED BY THE ADVISORY COM-
MITTEE ON THE TRAFFIC IN OPIUM
AND OTHER DANGEROUS DRUGS:
SUGGESTIONS OF THE UNITED STA-
TES OF AMERICA.
The President
Translation : The Rt. Rev. Charles Brent
delegate of the United States of America, will
address the Conference.


The Rt. Rev. Charles Brent (United States
of America) :
On behalf of the delegation of the United
States of America, I have the honour to submit
to the Conference the programme embodying
not only the mind of the delegation but also
the mind of the nation which we represent
(Annex 6). I place this in your hands now
informally in order you may have an oppor-
tunity to study, criticise and amend the propo-
sals which it contains.
You will note that we call our programme
?suggestions??. It is an attempt to translate
the ideals for which we stand into terms of
national and international practice. It is
couched, not in terms of immediacy or expe-
diency, but of a purpose to which every signatory
of the Hague Convention is pledged the ulti-
mate suppression of the abuse of opium, cocaine
nd their derivatives, and the restriction of their
production and manufacture within the require-
ments of medicine and science. The thought
that we have had in mind is not how little
we may do and call it progress, but how great
a stride forward we may take, not ignoring that
degree of risk which is invariably a companion
of forward movement.
The delegation of the United States would
be acting beyond its province in presenting
such a programme as is being placed in your
hands were it not that we are voicing not
merely an Act of Congress and the instructions
of the Government, but also the popular
demand. We carry with us written documents
pledging the unsolicited support of societies
and organisations representative of the whole
country, from the American Red Cross Society,
the American Chamber of Commerce, the
Grotto (a Masonic organisation), the Mystic
Shrine (another Masonic organisation), and
fraternal orders representing five million people,
from international missionary societies, 700
schools and colleges and hundreds of churches
and religious organisations.
It seemed to us wise to formulate our posi-
tion in terms of The Hague Convention amen-
ded and enlarged. If it be urged that we are
expecting to cover too much ground at a stride,
we would answer that such a course would be
far less dangerous to the interests of the human
race than an attempt merely to mark time or
dally. The popular mind is beginning to be
sufficiently informed of the peril of the situation
to require some forceful action under the terms
of a Convention that has now been in existence
for twelve years and thus far produced relatively
little fruit.
As I shall point out later, there is far more at
stake than the immediate question before
us. The whole principle of international action
and the value of the international treaty is
involved. When the time comes, in the course
of the Conference, for formal and definitive
action, the American delegation will put before
the Conference in the shape of amendments or
substitutes to proposals made, or as a complete
plan, as occasion may advise, the various
suggestions contained in their programme.
For the present we are laying our whole
case before the Conference without reserve
and ulterior motive. There is nothing we
do not say. There is no guile hidden beneath
the surface. If we are bold in our proposals,
we are frank in our presentation of them. No
longer can we honestly say of the slavery of
addiction what Canning once said of chattel
slavery : ?I abjure the principle of perpetual
slavery but I am not prepared now to state
in what way I would set about its abolition .
Our clear business is to prepare for action.
From the beginning it has been clear that
no single nation can combat the peril and ruin
with which habit-forming drugs threaten, not
one nation, but all nations. I venture to
repeat words advocating international action
which were written in 1906 relative to the
nation, both then and now, most troubled by
the abuse of opium :
?The sole hope for the Chinese is in
concerted action. As a side issue, but
as a consideration that would in my mind
enhance the value of the movement, it
would tend to unify in some measuie
nations that are Oriental either by natuie
or through the possession of dependencies
in the Orient. Nothing tends to promote
peace more than a common aim.??
At that very moment there was beginning a
bold adventure in China entailing much risk,
where nation stood beside nation in a common
endeavour to reach a seemingly impossible goal.
The goal was reached, and had it not been for
the universal upheaval of the world which has
turned back the clock of progress, China would
probably have consolidated the victory she
had won over her worst internal enemy. What
was done before must be done again. China
does not desire, nor will she be benefited by,
the pity, the cynicism or the criticism of sister
nations. She needs their encouragement and
active aid.
I speak of China thus early because the Chinese,
either in their own territory or in the depen-
dencies of other nations, are the chief victims
of a notorious form of narcotic abuse. The
courageous treatment of this question in coun-
tries where the Chinese are resident in large
numbers could not fail to have its effect on
China. The representatives of China are them-
selves asking why the profit received from the
sale of prepared opium in countries where such
sale is legalised cannot be used to combat in
one way or another the victims of addiction.
This is a question which must be frankly
answered, especially by such countries as claim
that traffic in prepared opium is not practised
for the purpose of making revenue. The whole
world waits for the answer.
When it comes to the consideration of the
restriction of production and manufacture within
the limits of medical and scientific needs let
us be frank the crux of the matter is money.
Eliminate economic difficulties and the rest
would be easy. When I speak in this way, I
recognise and appreciate the grave difficulties
which confront many countries. The reduction of
production and manufacture would mean eco-
nomic embarrassment. Whatever steps are
taken, this should be kept in full view. We must
determine on forward movement, forward move-
ment that is steady and will not cease until
the goal has been reached.
Among those who are perplexed by such prac-
tical problems as I have indicated, there is some-
times an inclination to irritation and impatience
because of the unpractical side of idealists, but,
let us not forget it, the hope of the world is in
idealism that breaks the bonds of conventional
thought and practice and challenges the impos-


sible to defend its claims. No movement for each customer as everybody else did. They
the betterment of the human race ever yet adopted this practice because they held it as
cnoonorlAd o i did � A. liXi 1 J j_ .. 1 i i ? i i?i,. - _ _ _
the betterment of the human race ever yet
succeeded that did not lift its standard high
and even have a valiant disregard for many
of the maxims of commonsense.
Science is the watchword of the day. Science
is head without heart. Emotion, on the other
hand, is heart without head. In this business
we need as much heart as head. A biologist
has recently claimed that the Golden Rule
without science would wreck the world that
tried it. How does he know ? It has never
been tried. This we do know : that science
without the Golden Rule has wrecked the
world and we stand amidst the wreckage.
The League of Nations and the last compact
signed within these walls, I mean the Protocol
for the Pacific Settlement of International
Disputes, are both distinguished instances of
adventure in the realm of the seemingly impos-
sible, ventures of the heart quite as much as
of the head. That they are discounted and
feared and criticised does not pale the real
brilliance of their respective stars. It is better
far to live in the freedom of bold experiment,
pressing upward into the realm of the untried,
than to abide in the doubtful security of the
castle of self-interest and the stagnant pool
of the status quo.
The story of the advancement of the human
race is a story of adventure and of refusal to
stand still because there is a lion in the way.
Two things destroy the power and beauty of
an ideal ; the one, a refusal to make adven-
tures ; the other, admiration without imitation.
Both dangers threaten this Conference.
The delegation of the United States asks of
you but one thing at this time, and it asks for
that thing in the spirit of brotherhood and kindli-
ness and faith in human nature. Let this Confe-
rence not adjourn without declaring in a prac-
tical way before the world that it is set on pur-
suing the ideal we have accepted until it has
been realised.
If you will allow one, who has laboured for
nearly a quarter of a century in our common
cause, to lay before you the principles which
have actuated him, permit him to do so by
suggesting certain guides that should determine
our procedure during the days of our fellowship
in this Conference.
i. The ethical must determine and inspire
the practical. This is not a question where
there can be a great deal of difference of opi-
nion among men of principle and honour.
That which we would count an evil and a pest
in our own family must be considered an evil
and a pest in the family of another. What
applies to families applies also to nations. In
other words, we must aim at that difficult task
of treating others and the interests of others on
the same plane as ourselves and our own
interests. Probably we are only kept from
adopting this practice by some subtile fear that
we shall in the end lose thereby.
It has been truly said that ?the people who
do most completely what is, in effect, to their
interest to do are those who, on moral grounds,
do what they believe to be against their interest?.
Bertrand Russell gives as an illustration how
among early Quakers ?there were a number
of shopkeepers who adopted the practice of
asking no more for their goods than they were
willing to accept, instead of bargaining with
a lie to ask more than they would take, but the
convenience to customers was so great that
everybody came to their shops and they grew
rich.?
Similarly, it has been recorded by an eminent
statistician that in New England out of 100
commercial houses founded for the pursuit of
gain and self-interest, which existed 100 years
ago, but five have survived. On the other hand,
out of ioo philanthropic organisations created
for the benefit of others, in existence ioo years
ago, 95 survive.
2. We must somehow find the courage and
the wisdom that will enable us to speak the
truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the
truth. Open diplomacy is beginning to assert
its reality and power in international negotia-
tions. Open diplomacy alone, however, will
not suffice. We must also have frank diplo-
macy. Let us not dwell on technicalities or
run off on side issues in order to evade the main
question. Evasion is a form of cowardice and
is headed for ultimate defeat. Dialectic clever-
ness usually leads to a hollow triumph and is
a degradation of the truth.
3- In spite of any checks that we may have
had in the mutual rapprochement of nations,
in spite of the mistakes of Governments that
have unnecessarily aroused hostilities, in spite
of the suspicions and fears which still mar free
intercourse in the family of nations, we must
recognise the essential unity of the human
race. There is no white or yellow or brown or
black human nature. We see the same material,
the same substance, under every colour, whether
in Africa, Asia, Europe or America. God never
made one nation to be exploited or despised
by another.
The story goes that one man of eminence met
another man of eminence. They accidently
jostled one another. Both turned and each
looked fiercely at his neighbour. Then one
of them said ; ?Why do you eye me so ? God
made me?. To which the other responded :
?Then He is falling off sadly in His work?. A
humorous way of indicating one of the chief
reasons why the world is at odds with itself
mutual disrespect and arrogance.
Mutual respect is the sole basis of fellowship,
whether among individuals or among nations.
There are various phases of human nature and
varying degrees of capacity in human nature.
But there is only one human nature. I speak
as a humble follower of Jesus Christ.
I made reference earlier in my address to the
fact that more was involved in this Conference
than the settlement of a single question. Inter-
national treaties are as yet relatively few and
the particular one by which most of the nations
represented here are bound is among the earliest.
In international treaties we have the chief
instrument by which the nations of the world
are to be firmly bound together.
Individual treaties are of small account as
compared with a treaty where a large number
of nations are all bound by a common compact.
One country may have individual treaties with
fifty others, but that fact does not prevent those
fifty countries being all at odds with one another.
I look upon the Hague Opium Convention as a
test convention. If we can prove to a world,
which is apt to be cynical, that this is an


effective agent for mutual understanding and
co-operative action, we shall be doing a service
which is valuable beyond computation for the
peace of mankind.
I would add, however, that I recognise that
conferences and treaties are but agencies that
must be taken out of the realm of mere mecha-
nism into that of organic life by the spirit
infused into them. We must start and we must
end with kindliness. Again, to quote that
versatile and brilliant publicist, Bertrand Russell:
?Only kindliness can save the world, and even
if we know how to produce kindliness we should
not do so unless we are already kindly.??
In conclusion, I would say this. You and
I are launched on an undertaking which will
not brook delays, pretences, or backsliding. We
are a gathering of men pledged on behalf of
our respective nations to the pursuit of an ideal
until it is realised. We must be true to our
trust. There are those already who have finished
their course without seeing the triumph of
their cause and ours. They have handed on the
torch for us to carry high and with blazing flame.
My friends and colleagues, Hamilton Wright,
representing the West, and Tang Kwo An,
representing the Orient, have finished their
work and we are the richer because of the heri-
tage that they have passed on to us. Sir John
Jordan, that fine old warrior, is still with us,
but he is at the eventide of his life. Of him
may it be aptly said as was said of another
crusader of his sort : ?Singleness of purpose
is the crusader?s characteristic virtue and the
secret of his power??.
In a book that is wise beyond all books to
the Christian, it is written concerning the idea-
lists of old : ?These all died in faith, not having
received the promises, but having seen them
and greeted them from afar??. It may be our
fate and, if it be so, we shall not complain.
Eventually, the victory will be won by other
hands if not by ours. But I cannot but feel
that the moment of victory is not far distant.
It is ready to arrive when the nations will it
to arrive.
The record of the last moments of the life
of William Wilberforce is an antidote to those
who are faint-hearted and who are too eager
for personal triumph in the cause which after
all is not our own except so far as we serve it
and make our contribution to it. In an inter-
val of consciousness he told his son that he
was in a very distressed state. ?Yes?, replied
his son, ?but you have your feet on the Rock?.
The dying man?s last words were : ?I do not
venture to speak so positively, but I hope I
have.? It was not until a year later that 800,000
slaves became free.
We, too, believe that we have our feet upon the
Rock and we earnestly hope that when the
Convention, which will close this Conference,
is signed it will mean a near approach to the
emancipation of the countless slaves now in
bondage to the ruthless master of addiction.
[Applause.)
The President
Translation : The memorandum submitted
by the United States delegation will be distri-
buted shortly. I intend later to make a commu-
nication in regard to it.
M. von Eckardt, delegate of Germany, will
address the Conference.
M. von Eckardt (Germany) :
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen If I venture to speak after so
eminent an authority as Bishop Brent, it is
Decause I am strongly impressed by the depth
of his sincerity. His lofty views and high aspi-
rations set our hearts beating faster. We
have had the good fortune to listen to a speech
that will find an enthusiastic echo throughout
the world, one that will show that oui Conference
is concerned, not with fine phrases, but with
deeds, with efforts undertaken to save the lives
of thousands of unhappy misguided human
beings, to save, as our President said so well
the day before yesterday, the generations
which succeed us. ?Where there?s a will
there?s a way??. We are all inspired with the
passionate desire of fulfilling the sacred duty
of doing everything possible to discover some
means of combating the horrible ravages of
opium and other narcotics.
I am certain, too, that we shall find the right
way, that we shall agree as to the methods
and measures which we ought to adopt, and that
the Governments of all the nations will act enei-
getically and drastically.
Last Monday I had the honour to state
Germany?s intentions. Bishop Brent?s words
will not only be welcomed in our country, as
indeed they will throughout the world, but
they will stimulate all those in whose hearts
the love of one?s neighbour is stronger and more
potent than the low instincts of selfishness.
A witty person once said to me : We are
all heroes when we are bearing the misfortunes
of others??. Bishop Brent tells us to be heroes
in combating the misfortunes which threaten
humanity.
The President
Translation : M. Veverka, delegate of Cze-
choslovakia, will address the Conference.
M. Veverka (Czechoslovakia) ;
Translation : lam happy to be able to
speak in the name of a country which the terrible
problem of opium does not directly affect.
Czechoslovakia is not, and never will be, a
producer State or a consumer State in the dispar-
aging sense of the word. At the most, it might
be possible some day or other, in view of Czecho-
slovakia?s climate, to introduce poppy culture
to meet the medical and scientific requirements
of the country and to free Czechoslovakia
from foreign imports.
This privileged position makes it possible
for my country to view the situation quite
calmly and impartially.
After careful consideration, the Czechoslo-
vak Government has once more come to_ the
conclusion that the vast problem of opium,
which is of importance to the progress of civi-
lisation and humanity, cannot be solved unless
all States loyally participate in its solution.
The Czechoslovak Government indeed shares
the opinion of those who believed that the first
Hague Convention provided it were applied
in a spirit of absolute solidarity by all nations
and races would suffice to a very large extent,
if not entirely, to remedy the havoc caused by
the abuse of narcotics. Good faith is the most
indispensable condition of all.
Needless to say, production must be restricted
to medicinal and scientific purposes. That
is the first thing. To lay down certain general


principles, my Government is of the opinion solidarity and progress, upon which the whole
that it would be necessary to supervise rigo-
rously, in particular, the manufacture, import,
export, distribution and sale of drugs ; to
forbid the trade in opium derivatives in any
shape or form ; to render the opium trade
subject to the granting of individual concessions ;
to ensure that the holders of these concessions
furnish returns which must be properly con-
trolled ; to establish special certificates for
import and export ; only to grant export
licences with the consent of the State to which
the goods are consigned and to inflict upon
offenders severe penalties, for example, heavy
fines, withdrawal of the concession, etc.
If every country were to apply loyally the
suggestions that I have just made, the problem
would soon cease to exist.
I have the honour to speak in the name
of a people which, in the course of its history,
has sacrificed itself for a great ideal. For the
freedom of conscience which it proclaimed
before the world through the mouth of John
Huss, my country suffered three centuries of
thraldom. She has thus the right to raise her
voice when the opium problem is discussed, the
more so since, stripped of all that is not essential,
it has become fundamentally a humanitarian
problem. It is even doubly so, for its solution
will contribute to the physical and moral
welfare of mankind. This solution, however, can
only be reached by the firm determination
of the representatives of humanity as a whole.
The responsibility is a collective one, from
which no nation can escape.
It is with this conviction that I express the
most sincere wishes of my Government for the
success of the Opium Conference.
Czechoslovakia?s devotion to the ideas of
structure of the League of Nations is based,
has become, if I may say so, proverbial.
For this reason she is able to appreciate,
better perhaps than most other countries,
the importance of our present proceedings.
She cannot forget that the prestige of the
League of Nations may be affected if this
Conference does not fulfil the high hopes that
it has aroused.
Let us remember that more and more through-
out the world public opinion is becoming
the supreme judge and that it is inspired
by an idealism that is invincible. It is no
sterile idealism, but an idealism essentially
constructive and anxious to express itself,
an idealism of such dynamic force that even
great material interests have to bow before
it. It proved its power during the war ; it
exists to-day and it is eager to achieve results.
We Czechoslovaks are sometimes accused of
having become too materialistic. The reproach
is undeserved. Our long sufferings have taught
us to seek the iaeal only in order to realise
it, and it is this motto, which has been so dearly
won, that I would like to see exalted at this
Conference.
The Hague Conference met under the banner
of idealism. The task of the Geneva Conference
is to achieve positive results ; for the noblest
of all ideals is an ideal achieved.
The President
Translation : I propose that the general
discussion be adjourned until to-morrow at
10.30 a.m. [Assent.)

18. PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION ON THE
BASISOFTHESERIESOF MEASURES
ADOPTED BY THE ADVISORY COM-
MITTEE ON TH E TRAFFIC IN OPIUM
AND OTHER DANGEROUS DRUGS :
CONTINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
The President
Translation : We will now continue the
general discussion. I call upon the Hon. Henri
Beland to address the Conference.
The Hon. Henri Beland (Canada)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gentle-
men The Canadian delegation wishes to
express its deep satisfaction at the spectacle of
a Conference which has brought together repre-
sentatives from almost every nation of the earth
with the object of discussing the important
question of the control of the production and
distribution of narcotic drugs. The reason for
this lies in the fact that in Canada, as in other
countries, the ravages caused by the abuse of
narcotics are assuming alarming proportions.
There, as elsewhere, the evil is spreading quietly,
insidiously ; it invades, with hardly an exception,
all classes of the community. Although the
drastic legislation adopted by the Canadian
Parliament has, in a certain measure, checked
its progress, yet it must be admitted that the


problem in my country, as elsewhere, has not
yet been solved.
A fact, however, that strikes us is that in
Europe, as well as in North America, the sub-
stances most to be dreaded are not opium in
the natural form and coca leaves but their
derivatives, the alkaloids. Indeed, were the
illicit use confined to the raw material, it might
be considered in these continents, at least,, as
insignificant.
Cocaine, morphine and heroine, these are the
enemies we must combat. Is there an effective
means of restricting their use to the sole needs
of medicine and science ? Let us look at
these three alkaloids which I have just men-
tioned. Are they not the products of elaborate
processes of manufacture ? Is it not a fact
that an industrial undertaking which has for its
object the extraction, in appreciable quantities,
of alkaloids from opium and coca leaves
requires a large plant and involved machinery,
considerations which make clandestine manufac-
ture well nigh impossible ? Moreover, have not
the nations, where such industries are in opera-
tion, adhered to the Hague Convention of 1912 ?
These facts being well known, I ask the follow-
ing question : Is it an insuperable task for
each country, for each Government, to control
the manufacture and distribution of these three
alkaloids ? Evidently not. This is the crux
of the whole question.
I do not desire to enter into details which at
this stage might and would rightly appear as
superfluous. Suffice it to point out that the
United States, whose delegate spoke so eloquently
yesterday, have enacted laws the enforce-
ment of which would be sufficient to eradicate
the evil if clandestine importation or, in other
words, organised contraband did not flood their
land with heroin, morphine and cocaine.
On the other hand, it would appear to be
as difficult to produce clandestinely these
alkaloids as it is to manufacture arms or tobacco
clandestinely. Therefore, in a given country,
the effective control of the production is possible,
if it is sincerely desired.
The remedy for this invading plague is in the
hands of this Conference. The nations can
join in a common movement of world-w r ide
patriotism, of humanitarian endeavour, and
free humanity from this hideous monster of
narcotism.
One of our honourable colleagues expressed
yesterday the idea that no individual prosperity
should be achieved at the expense of the
moral, intellectual and physical welfare of any
human being. This beautiful thought should
be the torch that should serve to light the Con-
ference on its way towards the accomplishment
of its noble task.
The Government and the people of Canada
earnestly request the co-operation of other
nations with a view to arriving at an interna-
tional agreement. They desire, in the first place,
that each country be requested to make known
the quantity of narcotics required annually for
its medicinal and scientific needs. They desire,
further, that the Agreement, which is to be
concluded, should provide for legislation stipula-
ting the effective control of the manufacture,
sale, importation and exportation of the narcotic
alkaloids. This international Convention is
highly desirable and it can be worked out.
In any case the Conference can be assured of
the most hearty and generous support on the
part of Canada. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. Sze, delegate of China, will
address the Conference.
M. Sze (China), Vice-President :
I was greatly impressed yesterday as I
sat next to our distinguished President and
listened to the eloquent address of Bishop
Brent. Since then the more I think of it,
the more profoundly lam impressed. I desire
to say that the Chinese Government and the
Chinese people will, I know, concur in what
he has said.
Yesterday, Bishop Brent, the day on which
you spoke, was the first day in two weeks on
which we saw bright sunshine and to-day we
continue to follow the lead you have given
in the general discussion. The sun continues
to shine and we see bright light all around us.
This is a happy augury.
Especially do I thank you, Bishop Brent,
for saying : ?China does not desire, nor will
she be benefited by, the pity, the cynicism or
the criticism of sister nations. She needs their
encouragement and active aid?. I also thank
you for the statement that ?the courageous
treatment of this question (of opium), in coun-
tries where the Chinese are resident in large
numbers, could not fail to have its effect on
China?.
I note also that, regarding the proposition
that I had the honour to make in the First
Conference to the effect that the Governments
which derive profits from the sale of prepared
opium to persons addicted to opium smoking
should use these revenues in one way or another
for the benefit of those unfortunates from
whom the revenues are derived, you say :
?This is a question which must be frankly
answered, especially by such countries as claim
that the traffic in prepared opium is not practised
for the purpose of making revenue.? I also
note that you say : ?The whole world waits
for the answer?.
China has suffered, and is now suffering, more
than other nations from the misuse of opium
and of narcotic drugs, but what I wish to say
now relates more to the general humanitarian
aspects of the questions, which must appeal
to all right-thinking peoples and to their Govern-
ments, than to the special sufferings of the
Chinese people.
The last century saw the disappearance
among all civilised people of the institution of
human slavery and the outlawing of the slave
trade, so as to place it in the same category
as piracy upon the high seas. The world is
now awakened to the debasing effects, physical
and moral, of the use of opium and its derivatives
and of other narcotic drugs for other than
strictly medicinal and scientific uses.
Surely this Conference will not disappoint
the hope of the peoples of the world that, so
far as is possible by common action on the
part of the Powers, steps, far in advance of those
made obligatory by the Hague Convention of
1912, will be taken by this Conference towards
the suppression of this scourge which now so
generally and so grievously afflicts humanity.
Surely we will not allow it to be said that the
nations of the world, now gathered in friendly


union in this room, will be willing for it to be the misuse of opium, of its derivatives, and of
said that they were not able to come to an agree-
ment as to the action to be taken by them
individually or in co-operation with one another
in order that, by progressive steps, mankind
may be freed from the curse which now afflicts
it.
I, of course, recognise that the regulation of
the consumption of opium and drugs in any
form or in any way by the people of a given
State is, from the standpoint of public law, a
matter for itself to determine and without any
responsibility towards other nations, save from
the broad humanitarian point of view, which,
being ethical in character, rises above legal
considerations. On behalf of the Chinese Gov-
ernment and of the Chinese people, however,
I am able to pledge their support of any action,
that may be agreed to by the Powers, which will
tend to secure the results which are the purpose
of this Conference.
Nearly twenty years ago, the Chinese Govern-
ment, supported by the efforts of the most
enlightened of its subjects, determined that the
production and use of opium, save for strictly
medicinal and scientific purposes, should cease
throughout the broad territories of China.
This aim was, within a period of ten years of
heroic effort, substantially achieved. Since
then, most regrettably, there has been a certain
recrudescence of the cultivation of the poppy
due to disturbed political conditions. The
Chinese Government, however, has never de-
parted, nor will it depart, from the policy
declared in 1906.
When, happily, the Government at Peking is
again able to exert full executive and adminis-
trative authority, it will, as one of its first acti-
vities, take steps to the full extent of its powers,
to free the country once more from the misuse
of opium, of its derivatives and of other nar-
cotic drugs drugs which, it may be said,
are not manufactured in China and which may
not be legally introduced into the country save
for strictly medicinal and scientific purposes.
The Chinese Government, when it is able to
act with efficiency, will certainly have the sup-
port of the best classes of its people.
There is a rapidly rising flood of public opinion,
far surpassing what has ever before existed,
which demands that the present production
and consumption of opium within China,
which is illegal under the Chinese law, shall
cease. I have already had the honour to lay
before the First Conference some of the evidence
showing the spread of this determination among
the most intelligent of the Chinese people
In this connection, I would refer also to the
letter of Mr. Koo, the representative of the
recently organised National Anti-Opium Asso-
ciation of China. Only two days ago, I received
a cablegram from the Secretary of that Associa-
tion informing me that there are now represented
in it thirteen hundred organisations, representing
two million people.
My present purpose in stating these facts
regarding China is solely in order to show the
approval with which the views of Bishop Brent
will be received by the Chinese Government
and by the Chinese people. So far as they
are concerned, the Conference may count upon
their full co-operation in any action that may
be taken by the Powers in general to lessen
and, if possible , to bring to a complete end the
evils now afflicting mankind by reason of
other narcotics drugs.
The President
Translation : M. Comnene, delegate of Rou-
mania will address the Conference.
IVI. Comnene (Roumania)
Translation : The Roumanian delegation
regards the present Conference as one of the
most important ever held under the auspices
of the League of Nations, not only because of
the humanitarian objects which it hopes to
attain but also by reason of the number of
Governments represented and the qualifications
of the delegates that have been selected. Some
of the greatest nations and, I may say, the most
powerful public opinion throughout the world,
are following our proceedings with interest,
and at times not without anxiety.
The success which we are all convinced must
crown our work will have far-reaching effects,
for it will show that the League of Nations is
something more than a vague ideal or an attempt
at concerted action on the part of a benevo-
lent, but exploded, sentimentality, as its detrac-
tors are wont to urge. Failure, on the other
hand let me speak quite candidly might
have an incalculable effect upon the future of
the League.
The Roumanian Government has given con-
vincing proof of its confidence in the great part
which the League is called upon to play, and it is
prepared to consider favourably any draft
Convention for the suppression of the abuse
of narcotic drugs a Convention, moreover,
which will furnish further proof of the impor-
tance and utility of the League. {Applause.)
The President
Translation : Dr. El Guindy, delegate of
Egypt, will address the Conference.
Dr. El Guindy (Egypt.)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gen-
tlemen As this is the first time that Egypt
has been represented by a purely Egyptian
delegation at an international conference held
under the auspices of the League of Nations,
I take this opportunity of offering this assembly,
which includes so many distinguished men, the
best wishes of my Government for the success
of its work.
Conscious of her duty towards the whole
human race, independent Egypt will do all
that lies in her power to co-operate loyally
and disinterestedly in the work which is
before us.
The illicit use of opium and its derivatives
and of the other substances mentioned in the
Advisory Committee's report is universally
condemned by public opinion.
There is, however, another product which
is at least as harmful as opium, if not more so,
and which my Government would be glad to
see included in the same category as the other
narcotics already mentioned I refer to hashish,
the product of the Cannabis indica or sativa.
This substance and its derivatives work such
havoc that the Egyptian Government has
for a long time past prohibited their introduc-
tion into the country (except, of course, the
trifling quantity required for medical purposes).
I cannot sufficiently emphasise the importance


of including this product in the list of narcotics practically unknown in Ireland. Ihe amount of
the use of which is to be regulated by this
Conference.
I hope soon to be in a position to submit to
this Conference a short memorandum on this
question, which is of such importance to my
country.
It should be an accepted principle that all
narcotic substances which are already known
and which, although not classed among inju-
rious drugs, may yet be regarded as such,
together with all other narcotic products which
may be discovered or produced in the future,
should fall automatically within the scope of
the measures of the Convention which we
hope to conclude. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. Vermaire, delegate of
Luxemburg, will address the Conference.
M. Vermaire (Luxemburg)
Translation : On behalf of the Government
of the Grand Duchy of Luxemburg, I have the
honour to thank the League of Nations for orga-
nising this Conference, the paramount object
of which is the conclusion, in so far as that is
possible, of an international Convention for the
speedy and effective suppression of the use
of opium and of all other drugs which are
injurious to public health.
It will, of course, seem easier for the European
States to conclude a convention of this nature
than for the producing countries of the East,
where the poppy is grown by thousands of
human beings and where, as the Persian dele-
gate, Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh, has shown in
his admirable statement, these people earn
their living by this means. Although we can-
not suddenly deprive these people of their
means of livelihood, the Conference must devise
methods for abolishing, in one way or another,
the trade in narcotics which so gravely threa-
tens public health.
The Luxemburg delegation will whole-
heartedly adhere to any measures which may
be taken to suppress the traffic in and use of
narcotics for other than medical or scientific
purposes.
Various methods for attaining this end have
been suggested by delegates intensive and
continuous propaganda by means of lecturers,
the Press, books, posters, films, and so forth.
The Luxemburg delegation will be prepared to
undertake propaganda of this kind, but it is
doubtful whether these measures will suffice.
We share the opinion of those members of the
Conference who hold that the best method
of effectively arresting the traffic in dangerous
drugs is the adoption of an international con-
vention which will absolutely prohibit any
trade or traffic in drugs over and above the
amounts required by each country for strictly
medical and scientific purposes. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : Mr. Mac White, delegate of the
Irish Free State, will address the Conference.
Mr. IVlichael IVlacWhite (Irish Free State)
Translation : I have the honour to represent
a country where the use of opium and other
dangerous drugs is restricted to medical and
scientific needs. The traffic in narcotics is
raw opium imported into the Irish Free State
in 1922 and 1923 did not exceed half a pound.
You might, then, infer that we would not show
any exceptional interest in this question. But
such is not the case. It is true that we have
no material interests at stake, but there are
other considerations which we regard as above
material interests, however important the
latter may be I mean humanitarian consi-
derations.
The United States of America, the promoters
of this Conference, who were guided by a lofty
ideal, have shown that they have faith in the
spirit of good-will and in concerted international
action under the auspices of the League with a
view to improving the condition of mankind.
Let us trust that they will not be disappointed.
The Government of the Irish Free State sincerely
desires to co-operate in any and every endeavour
for ensuring the progress and well-being of the
race.
In the name of the ideal which gave birth
to the League, let us bring this spirit of good-will
to the task before us. Let us attempt, whilst
committing no injustice, to put an end to this
terrible scourge, which, if not suppressed, will
decimate mankind more speedily than any war.
The facts supplied to us by experts are evi-
dence of the ravages caused by the abuse of
narcotics. Statistics show the ever-growing
number of crimes committed by the victims of
drugs ; but there are no exact figures, and we
are not yet able to form a correct idea of the
numbers who have been relegated to lunatic
asylums or driven to suicide owing to this
pernicious habit.
With these facts in mind, it is our plain duty
to find the most, effective means of putting
an end to the use of dangerous drugs ; but
we can only achieve this aim if we have regard
to the special interests of those States which
are mainly concerned in the production of raw
opium and the coca leaf. In spite of the
efforts we may make and the good-will we
may display, we cannot, for obvious reasons,
restrict this production with a stroke of the pen.
The question affects too many nations and too
many States ; moreover, the revenue which
they derive from the industry is the most serious
obstacle to the solution of the problem.
I hold that those States which exploit human
weakness for pecuniary profit are guilty of
immorality and crime. The consumption of
opium, however, is an ingrained habit in the
East, and experience has proved the danger
of sudden changes. Each nation has its own
customs and its own traditions. In the eyes
of some nations these customs may seem abuses
and these traditions may appear wrong. But
we can do nothing if the knowledge of the
truth is confined to a limited circle ; public
opinion in all countries must be enlightened,
so that it may judge and condemn with a full
knowledge of the facts. Only then will it be
possible to find an effective remedy for the
present state of affairs.
While we await, however, the results of the
propaganda that is now being carried on, we
trust that the countries directly concerned in
the production of narcotics will not hesitate
to make the necessary sacrifices which we ask
of them in the name of mankind. Personally,
I have sufficient confidence in the good faith


of the countries concerned to hope that our which, indeed, are as yet unknown to us.
appeal will not be in vain.
It has been suggested that the production of
raw opium and of the coca leaf should be reduced
gradually, so that the crops would in a few years
be limited to strictly medical and scientific
needs. This suggestion merits full considera-
tion. We must first, however, come to a defi-
nite understanding as to how many years will
be required and what should be the annual
progressive reduction in order to effect our
object. Again, if satisfactory results are to
be obtained, a system of control must be estab-
lished accurately defining the medical and
scientific needs of the different countries.
{Applause.)
The President
Translation : Dr. Betances, delegate of the
Dominican Republic, will address the Conference.
Dr. Betances (Dominican Republic)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen There can, I think, be no question
that all the representatives of the different
countries who have come to this International
Opium Conference have one and the same object,
namely, the great humanitarian object of
speedily and permanently abolishing this evil
which has for many years made man the most
unhappy and the feeblest of God?s creatures.
There is no one among us, I am sure, wdio
considers that the most effective measures for
attaining this purpose should be applied only
in countries where opium, morphine and cocaine
have claimed a large number of victims. It
is quite possible that at an early date countries
where this scourge is as yet unknown may,
little by little and perhaps by the contagion
of fashion, contract this deadly habit and that
useful members of society may be transformed
into useless burdens on their fellow-men.
The humanitarian aspect of this Conference
is not, if I may say so, a restricted object ; it
is a universal object. Again, the measures
which we shall be called upon to take must not be
theoretical or partially effective measures ;
they must be real measures stringent and
energetic measures. Yet when we consider that
these measures must be taken, not only in
countries where the evil exists but also in
countries where it is unknown, and that they
must be as energetic as possible, we are forced
at the outset to enquire whether if I may
take a general example in order to suppress
slaughter, we must first remove the slayers or,
in other terms, whether we must, in order to
suppress this scourge, create an even greater
evil.
The whole world is aware that, although
opium and other narcotics have claimed and are
still claiming many victims, and although these
drugs are responsible for the misfortunes of
men of weak character and feeble will, they
have yet brought happiness and relieved
suffering and have even preserved great num-
bers from death.
Further, we do not yet know what the future
has in store for us in the world of science, nor
what we may expect from the experiments and
researches of numerous scientists who are enqui-
ring into the utility, the advantages, and even
the specific properties of these drugs when
judiciously employed in definite cases, some of
Nor do we yet know how far they can help us
in explaining many phenomena connected with
human life.
To suppress these drugs altogether and thus
prevent unhappy wretches from perishing
through their abuse is a truly philanthropic task ;
but it would be cruel to abandon children,
mothers, entire families, to suffering and anguish
by entirely suppressing these narcotics.
The Dominican Republic, which has invariably
contributed, sometimes by a supreme effort of
self-denial, to all humanitarian endeavours,
whether local or word-wide, and which spon-
taneously signed the Hague Convention of 1912,
will whole-heartedly co-operate in the pro-
ceedings of our Conference with a view to
reaching an international agreement that will
rescue the nations from the scourge of narcotics
by which they are afflicted.
Nevertheless, although the representative of
the Dominican Republic accepts and complies
with the Convention which his country has
signed, he feels it his duty to state here and now
that, while his object is the same humanitarian
object as that pursued by his colleagues, he
can only accept proposals which will in no way
hamper the free employment of opium and its
derivatives for medical and scientific purposes
and provided that these drugs are placed in
unlimited quantities at the disposal of duly
authorised professional men.
This statement will convince the President
and my colleagues that, even if I do not ask
to intervene frequently in the discussions, I am
prepared to vote for all proposals which they
may make, provided they do not conflict with
the principles which I have just laid down.
Sir IVlalcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
Mr. President I wish to say a few words,
and a few words only, about the British Gov-
ernment?s position in regard to the question
which has be considered by this Conference.
Great Britain stands by the view that, so long
as the drugs are produced in quantities greatly
in excess of the world?s legitimate requirements,
illicit traffic in and abuse of the drugs will
continue.
I may interpose here that this is the view
which has been held, since its first session in
1921, by the Opium Advisory Committee of
the League. From the start, that Committee
has worked with this conviction in its mind.
At its first session it initiated an enquiry into
the world?s legitimate requirements, and it
was as the result of the information which it
accumulated on this subject that the Committee
felt at its session in 1923 that it was in a posi-
tion to submit to the Council of the League its
proposal for the holding of this Conference.
The British Government is of the opinion that
we can never expect to eliminate entirely the
illicit traffic in or abuse of these drugs, any more
than we can expect to eliminate crime. While,
therefore, the strongest possible measures for
both the national and international control
of the trade are and will continue to be neces-
sary, it is essential that measures should be
taken by the producing countries in concert
for the direct limitation of the production of the
drugs.
It is probably known to most of the delegates
that Great Britain has put forward in the Pre-
paratory Committee a scheme for the limitation


of production. This scheme has not been with-
drawn, but in view of the fact that a scheme
drawn up on somewhat different and somewhat
simpler lines was prepared by the Opium Advi-
sory Committee at its recent session, and in
view of the fact that that scheme received a
large measure of agreement in the Committee,
Great Britain is prepared to withdraw its own
scheme, if the scheme of the Advisory Committee
is found to be generally acceptable to this
Conference.
I had hoped that we should have heard,
during the general discussion which has been
taking place, the views of the different delega-
tions on the schemes that have been put for-
ward in the reports of the Preparatory Committee
and the Advisory Committee and that we should
have learnt what was the attitude of their
respective Governments towards them. We
have had many general expressions of good-
will, but we are very much in the dark at pre-
sent as to the views entertained with regard
to the several schemes which have so far been
worked out.
I do not, of course, wish to pretend that the
British scheme is perfect or that it is not atten-
ded with serious difficulties, nor do I wish to
minimise those difficulties nor to evade their
discussion. But we believe that, with good-will
and a sincere effort on the part of all countries
to co-operate, a scheme for the direct limitation
of the production of the drugs is practicable.
The problem is partly a medical one and partly
an administrative one. The Advisory Committee
has suggested that any scheme which is put
into force must be based on some estimate of
the world?s medical requirements, and that
estimate itself must be based upon the estimates
of the medical requirements of the countries
individually. These requirements are not uni-
form over the whole world ; they vary from
country to country according to the progress
made in medicine, differences in medical practice,
climatic conditions and other circumstances.
Assuming, as we think this Conference may
assume, the possibility that estimates of medical
requirements can be framed, the problem then
becomes an administrative one. It is a problem
of a kind which I believe has never been attemp-
ted before, the difficulties of which are evident,
but which we believe can be solved.
Before I close, I venture to deprecate any
tendency to under-estimate the value of the
progress which has already been achie\ ed.
Remember that the Hague Convention only
came into force three and a half years ago and
that the task before the League has been to
secure'its effective application thioughout the
world, and not only to secure its effective appli-
cation but to devise the machinery on which
that application could be based. Remember,
too, that the nations are faced with an illicit
traffic, carried on by organisations which
are possessed of huge resources and the ope-
rations of which are world-wide. There have
been disappointments I do not wish to dis-
guise this fact but I believe it is correct to
say that the amount of progress that has been
achieved under the auspices of the League
and as a result of the efforts of individual nations
during those three and a half years, both in the
national and international spheres, can hardly be
paralleled in any previous international move-
ment. [Applause.)
Translation : M. Pernambuco, delegate
Brazil, will address the Conference,
m. Pernambuco (Brazil)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gen-
tlemen Brazil was one of the signatories of
the Hague Convention and in execution of the
obligation which she then assumed she has
promulgated special laws and regulations concer-
ning the importation and sale of dangerous
drugs. These laws and regulations, which
received the assent of the President of the Repub-
lic, have been in operation since 1921, and
every possible endeavour has been made since
that date to ensure their rigorous observance.
Extremely strict measures have been taken
to control all imports of dangerous drugs with
a view to ensuring that persons carrying on
illicit trade shall be punished very severely
by imprisonment for not less than a year, by
heavy fines and even by the closing-down of
their businesses.
I was glad to notice that M. Kaku, the Japa-
nese delegate, stated in his speech that we
should not merely adopt suppressive measures,
but also treat, by scientific methods, persons
who have contracted this pernicious habit.
In promulgating the laws to which I have
referred, Brazil made the treatment of drug
addicts compulsory and has established sana-
toria for the purpose. The Government quickly
realised that addicts were the chief propagators
of the vice, more especially in countries where
the supervision of drugs-stores and pharmacies
by Government medical officers makes it almost
impossible to buy dangerous drugs without
a medical prescription. In these countries
addicts can only obtain the poison that is
slowly killing them from persons engaging
in illicit sale and, as they alone know where the
drugs can be found, they are the first to pass
them on to new victims. It is for this reason
that our Government has made the treatment of
addicts compulsory. They can obtain treat-
ment in one of two ways : they can apply to
a magistrate to be sent to a special establish-
ment or, if they are arrested by the police or
reported to the authorities by members of
their families, they are compulsory detained
in sanatoria or homes under Government super-
vision until they are permanently cured.
Measures have been recently taken to pre-
vent any dangerous drug entering Brazil un-
accompanied by the import certificates establis-
hed by the League of Nations. If a consignment
of drugs is not accompanied by the proper papers,
the drugs are burnt. They are never sold.
You will realise, therefore, that Brazil takes a
special interest in the humanitarian campaign
which we are undertaking here. On behalf
of my country, I express my sincerest wish
that we may arrive at a tangible result which
will check this social scourge and benefit
mankind.
If the members of the Conference so desire,
I am ready to place the laws and regulations of
my country in this matter at their disposal.
[Applause.)
The President
Translation : Dr. Duarte, delegate of Vene-
zuela, will address the Conference.
The President


Dr. Duarte (Venezuela)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen The Government of Venezuela,
which signed the International Opium Conven-
tion and ratified it in 1913, takes a keen interest
in the humanitarian question for which this
Conference has been convened. Although
Venezuela neither produces nor manufactures
narcotics, and although instances of the abuse of
dangerous drugs are rare in our countrjq the
Government, in pursuance of the Hague Conven-
tion, enacted in 1920 very severe regulations to
prevent the illegal traffic in opium and cocaine.
I do not propose to weary you by enumera-
ting the provisions of these regulations, as a
summary will be duly distributed to the Confe-
rence. I wish merely to say that the Venezue-
lan Government has rigorously applied the regu-
lations which it has enacted, as it believes that
the framing of laws is not enough these laws
must be energetically enforced.
In conclusion, I desire, on behalf of my
Government, to express our best wishes for
the success of the Conference, which will be the
crowning effort of the League of Nations in
the arduous humanitarian work which it has
undertaken. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : Mehmed Sureya Bey, delegate
of Turkey, will address the Conference.
Mehmed Sureya Bey (Turkey) :
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gen-
tlemen The Government of the Turkish Re-
public is extremely glad to take part, for the first
time, in a Conference convened for a humani-
tarian object under the auspices of the League
of Nations. Turkey will loyally collaborate
in the work of the Conference and will conform
to any decisions which ma}/ be taken.
I wish, however, to point out that the country
which I have the honour to represent is merely
a producer of opium, and that there is no
danger in Turkey of the abuse of that product,
as the peasants who cultivate the poppy do
not consume the drug. Consequently, I shall
reserve my right to make further observations
m due time as regards the cultivation of the
poppy, of which Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh, the
Persian delegate, has already spoken.
There is in the case of Turkey another ques-
tion, namely, that of hashish. There are special
laws in Turkey to prevent the cultivation of,
and trade in, hashish. In order, however, to
meet the wishes of our colleague on the Egyp-
tian delegation, I will request you, Mr. Presi-
dent to be good enough to place this question
on the agenda of the Conference.
The President
1 ranslation : I call upon Mr. Campbell, dele-
gate of India, to speak.
Mr. Campbell (India)
I did not intend to take part in the general
discussion, as there will, I imagine, be many
opportunities in the course of the Conference
of explaining in detail the policy of the Govern-
ment of India, but I should like to say at once,
with reference to the remark made by Sir
Malcolm Delevingne, that the Government of
India is prepared to accept the scheme drawn up
by the Opium Advisory Committee.
The President
Translation : M. Peltzer, delegate of Belgium,
will address the Conference.
M. Peltzer (Belgium)
Translation : Mr. President I wish to
state that the Belgian Government has issued
detailed regulations for the execution of the
provisions of the Hague Convention and of the
recommendations of the League of Nations.
These provisions are strictly and most success-
fully enforced.
I need say no more to show you that Belgium
heartily sympathises in the humanitarian work
for which this Conference is convened.
The President
Translation : There are no more speakers
on my list for the general discussion.
If no other delegate desires to speak, I
declare the general discussion closed.
19. REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON
CREDENTIALS : CREDENTIALS OF
THE CHINESE DELEGATION.
The President
Translation : I now ask the Chairman of
the Committee on Credentials to speak.
M, de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba), Chairman
of the Committee on Credentials :
Translation : The Secretary-General of the
League has to-day received a telegram from

of China to. the First and Second Opium Confe-
rences, with full powers.
The Committee on Credentials consequently
considers the members of the Chinese delegation
duly authorised to take their seats in the Confe-
rence and to sign any Convention which may
be prepared.

The President
Translation : Eadies and gentlemen
I think I am expressing the views of all the
members of the Second Opium Conference when,
in the name of that Conference, I thank all the
representatives of the private associations who
have addressed us to-day.
They have given us a very clear impression
of the important work that is being done by
the different organisations in various countries.
The lofty ideals which are the object of this
international gathering can only be achieved
if public opinion in all nations is adequately
prepared, and if all classes among the various
nations are made acquainted with the serious
danger from narcotics. The voluntary orga-
nisations which are represented before us to-day
are carrying out this preparatory and educational
work. The Second Opium Conference extends
to-day to these associations its greetings as
its collaborators in the moral aspect of this
work. It much appreciates the efforts which
the associations have made and expresses to
them its warm thanks.

diately.
Mr. Campbell (India)
I have no objection to the immediate dis-
cussion of the proposal if you consider it advi-
sable, but I am not in favour of it.
The President
Translation : Do any other delegates desire
to speak on the proposal ?
It is true that I omitted to ask the members
of the Conference whether or no they would
prefer to adjourn the discussion which it appears
we shall be obliged to have on this subject.
I infer that all delegates are in favour of
continuing the discussion on the Spanish pro-
posal.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : My proposal is quite simple
and I did not expect that there would be any
objection to it. I am prepared to give reasons
in support of it, but it would perhaps be better
if the delegate of India were to state the grounds
on which he is unable to accept it.
Mr. Campbell (India)
Mr. President, I suggest that we are rather
inverting the usual order of things. I expected
that the author of the proposal would first
of all have given us the reasons for it. But
as I do not desire to avoid discussion, I am
prepared to deal with the matter at once.
My first point is a practical one. I call the
attention of the Conference to the fact that
there are about 40 States represented here,
a number which does not render discussion
very easy. We have five schemes prepared
by five different experts as the result of long
discussion. None of those schemes has been
withdrawn, and they are all based upon very
wide knowledge of the subject. I presume
that sooner or later those schemes will, or
may, come under discussion at this Conference.
We have another scheme, also fairly long, I
am afraid, which was prepared by the Opium
Advisory Committee as the result of about a
fortnight?s work. We have also another
scheme, certainly not less long, which has been
presented by the American delegation. Now
all these schemes, seven in number, have to
be discussed and decided on, unless we can
come to an agreement regarding the acceptance
I again submit that these
schemes have been framed by experts, with
a profound knowledge of the subject. I do
not imply any disrespect to the ladies and
gentlemen who have spoken to-day when I
say that their knowledge of the subject is,
I think, admittedly much less profound.
Translation : I would point out to the dele-
gate of India that Rule 5 of the rules of proce-
dure, which we adopted yesterday, lays down
that ?A Business Committee shall be appoin-
ted by the Conference, consisting of the Presi-
dent of the Conference...? and so on. ?The
functions of the Committee shall be to make
proposals to the Conference for the arrange-
ment of the business of the Conference?, and,
further, that this Committee is ?to examine
and report on communications made to the
Conference by private organisations or indi-
viduals?. The Business Committee is there-
fore called upon to deal with and make a report
on these communications.
I merely wish to call Mr. Campbell?s attention
to this point.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : The delegate of India is
perfectly right in saying that the usual order
of things has been inverted. I should first
have explained the proposal which I had the
honour to submit to the Conference, but I am
glad I did not do so because, as things are,
1 am now able to reply to the objections which
Mr. Campbell has just made and which he
will, I hope, withdraw when he has heard the
explanations which I am able to give.
The first observation which I desire to make
concerns the schemes which we are required
to consider. We have indeed a superabun-
dance of schemes before us, but I wish to point
out that I have made no proposal to add another
one to those at present before us. The object
of my motion was to avail ourselves of the
benefit of the work of the private organisations
and the information which they have supplied
at the present meeting, We have many
matters to investigate, and we shall endeavour
to go into the details of the communications
which have been made to us. The Secretariat,
however, could, I think, be of great assistance
to us if it were to present the conclusions so
as to facilitate the task of the Committees which
will be set up during our proceedings to report
to the Conference on definite subjects.
I do not say that the conclusions to which
we have listened will in any way constitute a
final opinion on my part ; they will serve as
arguments to assist us in forming a judgment.
We have come to Geneva as delegates of our
Governments, and our Conference is an official
Conference. We cannot therefore permit dis-
cussion on a scheme submitted by a private
association.
I trust that Mr. Campbell will be satisfied
with my explanation, for I had no intention of
placing the conclusions of any particular Com-
mittee on the same footing as the proposals
now before us.
I have already answered Mr. Campbell?s
second objection that certain suggestions could
not be discussed in this place. I concur in
his opinion. I have no intention of proposing
that the Conference should discuss the argu


ments which have been put forward. We will
each of us bear them in mind in order to help
us in forming our personal opinions.
In these circumstances I hope that the dele-
gate of India will be good enough to accept
my explanations.
IVSr*. Campbell (India)
May I say at once, with regard to the remarks
which have been made by the honourable
delegate for Spain, that I have no objection
whatever to his proposal. I understand that
he wishes the Secretariat to prepare a resume
of the various suggestions which have been made,
that resume to be for the personal information
of the delegates and not to be included in our
agenda, nor discussed. On that basis I have, of
course, no objection whatever to his suggestion.
The President
Translation : The Spanish delegate has
himself explained the resolution which he sub-
mitted and his explanation has, moreover,
been endorsed by the delegate of India. As
the Spanish delegate has not asked to speak
again after the explanation made by the dele-
gate of India, I presume that he agrees with
the interpretation given to his motion.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I am entirely in agreement
wifh it. The delegate of India has only repea-
ted what I myself said.
The President
Translation : The present discussion is not
governed by our rules of procedure. The
proposal can be voted on by the Conference if
it so desires.
Before we vote, I wish to draw the atten-
tion of the Conference to the fact that it has
already been decided to annex the text of this
afternoon?s speeches to the verbatim record
of our meeting. The rules of procedure have
been adopted, and Rule 5 applies to the question
raised in the Spanish delegation?s proposal.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : The observations which the
President has just made are perfectly well
founded, but to my mind the question is
raised in a slightly different manner in my
proposal from that in which it occurs in the
rules of procedure. This is a special case, and
it is on these grounds that I submitted it to the
Conference for an opinion. We have decided to
annex the speeches which we have just heard
to the verbatim record of the meeting, and I
accordingly proposed that the conclusions of
those speeches should be summarised in order
to assist us in forming an opinion on them.
Mr. Campbell (India)
Might I suggest that the matter should be
adjourned until to-morrow, when I have very
little doubt that the honourable delegate for
Spain and myself will probably be able to
present an agreed resolution ?
The President
Translation : The proposal is now made that
the Conference should adjourn taking a deci-
sion on the Spanish delegation?s proposal.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I accept this suggestion.
The President
Translation : The discussion on the Spanish
proposal is adjourned to the next meeting.
Before we go, I wish to draw your attention
to Rule 10 of the rules of procedure concerning
the translation and distribution of documents
for the Conference. May I again request dele-
gates to hand in all such documents to the
official permanently on duty in the Conference
Hall at the right-hand side of the exit ? This
is the only procedure by which errors and delays
can be prevented.
The Conference rose at 7.10 p.m.
SEVENTH MEETING
Held at Geneva on Saturday, Novvember 22nd, 1924, at 10.30 a.m.
CONTENTS.
23. Examination of the First Report of the
Business Committee.
President : M. Herluf Zahle.
23. EXAMINATION OF THE FIRST REPORT
OF THE BUSINESS COMMITTEE.
The President
Translation : In accordance with Rule sof
the Rules of Procedure, which you have adopted
the Business Committee held two meetings
yesterday in order that it might be able to sub-
mit a plan of work to you this morning.
This plan, which has been distributed to
you in French and in English, forms the first
report of the Business Committee (Annex 15).
I call upon Sir Malcolm Delevingne, Rappor-
teur of the Business Committee, to address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Rapporteur of the Business Committee :
I must begin by apologising to the Confe-
rence for appearing before it again in the capa-
city of Rapporteur. The position was not
coveted by me, as the Conference may imagine,
but I was asked by the Business Committee to
undertake it and I felt that I could not refuse
any task which might help to forward the
work of the Conference.


The scheme for conducting the work of the scheme of the Opium Advisory Committee, or
Conference, which I have the honour to submit
on behalf of the Business Committee, is the
result of long and careful consideration on its
part. The task before the Conference is both
difficult and complicated, and many questions
will come up for consideration. Naturally,
there have been differences of opinion as to the
best methods to be adopted for carrying on our
work. The scheme which we put before you
is a combination of several proposals ; it may
seem long ,but it is in reality simple.
The problem before the Conference falls into
two main divisions. The first of these comprises
the specific task indicated in the resolution
of the Assembly in pursuance of which this
Conference has been summoned ; that is,
the task of devising a scheme for the limitation
of the amounts of morphine, heroin and cocaine
to be manufactured, and the limitation of the
production for export of raw materials from
which those drugs are made, to the quantity
required for medical and scientific purposes.
The second is the revision of the Hague
Convention which must necessarily follow on
the adoption of any scheme for the limitation
of the manufacture of the drugs, or the produc-
tion of the raw materials, or both. The neces-
sity for such revision of the Hague Convention
will be obvious. If the manufacture of the
drugs is to be limited to the quantities required
for medical and scientific purposes, it is neces-
sary for measures to be taken to control the
export, the import and the distribution of the
manufactured drugs so as to ensure that the
supplies of the drugs are used only for such
purposes and are not diverted to illegitimate
uses, otherwise the world?s medical and scien-
tific requirements will not be met.
The draft project put forward by the Opium
Advisory Committee, which the Conference has
adopted as a basis for discussion, deals with
the problem in two parts corresponding to the
two main divisions which I have indicated.
The Business Committee therefore proposes,
in the first place, that two general Committees
shall be appointed by the Conference, to deal
respectively with the first and second parts of
our task. Every 'delegation will be entitled
to be represented on each of these Committees.
The Business Committee is also of the opinion
that it will be necessary to appoint a number of
Sub-Committeestodeal with particular problems.
Both the extent and the character of the work,
in our opinion, require the adoption of this step.
For instance, the problem of the limitation ot
the manufacture of the drugs, or the problem
of the limitation of the production of the raw
materials for export, can only be solved by
securing agreement between the manufacturing
countries or the producing countries, as the case
may be.
Again, the first of these problems the
limitation of manufacture is a different one
from the second the limitation of the produc-
tion of raw materials and different groups
of countries are concerned in them. Again,
the problems have to be considered from the
point of view of the consuming countries.
The scheme of limitation put forward by the
Opium Advisory Committee of the League is
based on estimates of their requirements for
medical and scientific purposes furnished by
the consuming countries. The question will
arise whether the arrangements proposed in the
in any other scheme that may be submitted,
are satisfactory so far as the consuming coun-
tries are concerned. 1 need not elaborate the
point further.
The business of the Conference will, in our
view, proceed most rapidly and effectively if
these special problems, which are both important
and difficult and which lie at the very centre
of our task, are dealt with by special Sub-Com-
mittees. In the proposal which the Business
Committee puts before the Conference, we indi-
cate what Sub-Committees we think should be
appointed and in what manner we think they
should be constituted. The Sub-Committees
will report to the general Committees. The
general Committees will have the important
task of co-ordinating the results of their work
and presenting the conclusions to this Confe-
rence.
I would say one word in conclusion. Appre-
hensions have been expressed as to whether
some subjects may be included which, in the
opinion of some members, ought to be excluded,
and, on the other hand, whether some subjects
may be excluded which, in the opinion of some,
ought to be included. The proposal of the
Business Committee follows the wording of
our agenda as it is contained in the resolution
of the Assembly. The question whether
any particular subject is included or excluded
is therefore not prejudged.
In his eloquent speech the other day, Bishop
Brent told us not to be frightened because we
might find a lion in the way. I would add to
that by saying, ?Do not let us worry about
the lions until they appear. Let us get on
with the work which the world is expecting
us to do, and deal with the difficulties as and
when they arise?.
The President
Translation : As you all have the text of
the proposal before you in both official lan-
guages, I do not think it is necessary to read it.
I beg to state that the project contained in
the first report of the Business Committee is
now open for discussion. I call upon the first
speaker, M. El Guindy, to address the Confe-
rence.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : I think that, before beginning
our work, it would be advisable to make an
addition to the list of drugs. ?Hashish? is
not mentioned, and I think it is essential that
it should be included.
The President
Translation : I would ask the Egyptian
delegate to submit his proposal in writing.
M. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : I made the proposal in the
course of my speech.
The President
Translation : It is preferable that your
proposal, which is a formal one, should be
handed in to the Chair in writing.
In order to save the Rapporteur of the Busi-
ness Commitee unnecessary work, I propose that
the speakers should make their remarks in
turn, and that Sir Malcolm Delevingne should
reply to them altogether.


Has anyone any observations to make in
regard to the plan of work ?
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I have just one brief remark
to make in connection with a passage in the
statement made by the Rapporteur of the
Business Committee, of which I myself was
a member. I feel that attention should be
drawn to this passage, more especially as I
do not think that the point referred to in it
was established in the course of our discussions
yesterday.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne said, if I understood
him aright, that the First Committee will deal,
in general, with questions relating to what
is called the ?limitation? of products, and that
the Second Committee will deal with such revi-
sion of the Hague Convention as may be neces-
sary after the work of the First Committee has
been completed. It would therefore deal with
modifications shown to be necessary as a result
of the work of the First Committee.
This is correct to a certain extent, but it is
not absolutely correct, for, as you know, we now
have before us, under the provisions of the gene-
ral scheme of the Advisory Committee, an entire
programme for the revision of the Hague
Convention, a scheme which has been carefully
prepared and which, as regards certain points,
may have an important bearing upon the object
which we have in view. Accordingly, this
Second Committee, which has to deal more
especially with the revision of the Flague Con-
vention, has already even though the First
Committee has not yet reached any conclusions
-?? a programme on which to work. If such
were not the case, we should, logically have had
to wait before setting up our Second Committee
to see what the First Committee would have
for it to do.
I feel sure that Sir Malcolm Delevingne agrees
with me, but I thought that the point should
be raised by a member of the Business Committee
in order to avoid any misunderstanding.
M. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : At the meeting of the Busi-
ness Committee, I voted in favour of the pro-
gramme submitted this morning. I quite
agree with M. de Aguero y Bethancourt :
the first thing to be done is to determine the
procedure and constitution of the Committees,
Sub-Committees and Committees of Experts
to be set up.
As regards the exact competence of the Second
Opium Conference, I feel that it should be inter-
preted with a certain breadth of view and that
the various proposals which will be submitted
to us should be given the fullest consideration.
The Business Committee did not succeed,
in the course of its discussion yesterday, in
coming to any definite conclusion as regards
this point. I myself formally reserved the
right to raise the question at a plenary meeting
of the Conference.
I have made an exhaustive examination of
all the documents relating to our competence,
They are not drafted in strictly legal terms ;
they allow of very wide latitude in interpre-
tation. Such being the case, I wish to speak
frankly and to give you my personal view,
which is based not exclusively on legal, but
even more, on moral and ethical considera-
tions.
The Governments which we represent here are
all animated by one desire, the desiie to put
an end to the scourge of dangerous drugs :
as regards this point, there can be no doubt
whatsoever. But if our lofty ideals of huma-
nity and social justice are to become practical
realities, we must manifest both goodwill and
common sense.
[a) It is the imperative duty of our Confe-
rence to profit by the unique and decisive
opportunity offered it by the present meeting
of eminent representatives of all the States
concerned and of the ablest experts in the
various continents, and to discuss any serious
suggestion designed to bring about the suppres-
sion of dangerous drugs. We are met together
at the instance of the League of Nations, under
whose general supervision the traffic in opium
and other dangerous drugs is placed by Article 23
of the Covenant. This being so, it is our
duty to deal with the Egyptian proposal
supported by the Turkish delegation con-
cerning hashish. Too strict a juridical inter-
pretation of our competence might run counter
to the lofty purpose which we have in view.
The Conference must bring to bear, along with
the cold logic of the brain, the creative gene-
rosity of the heart and must even, if need be,
give the latter preference.
(b) On the other hand, we must not lose sight
of the practical side of the matter. We can
only do what lies within our power ; if we are
not in possession of the necessary instructions
or if any subject has not been sufficiently pre-
pared, it will be impossible for us to conclude
an effective convention within the short period
of time at our disposal. If this should prove
to be the case, we should be obliged to con-
fine ourselves to making a recommendation or
expressing a desire, or even perhaps to referring
to the matter in the Minutes ; delegations will
also be able to adhere to an agreement subject
to reservations. All this, however, must not
prevent us from exchanging views and discussing
matters in order to decide whether or not the
difficulties are insurmountable at the present
time.
The Conference might take as a general basis
for discussion the programme prepared by the
Opium Advisory Committee. Every delega-
tion, however, retains the right to interpret
the terms of this programme in its own way
and to submit such amendments or additions
as it may think fit.
The proposal of the American delegation
becomes, in accordance with the resolution of
the fourth Assembly, ipso facto part of the pro-
gramme of the Conference.
The question of the competence of the Confe-
rence is certainly a delicate one. If, however,
we continue to hold a high ideal of humanity,
justice and social charity, if we act throughout
alike with good-will and common-sense, our
difficulties will not be insurmountable. The
letter kills, the spirit animates. To much
legal technicality or cold logic would be a sad
disappointment to public opinion, which expects
great things from us. The success of our
work would be endangered and it would be a
blow to the moral prestige of the League.
The President
Translation : Dr. Chodzko, delegate of Poland,
will address the Conference.


Dr. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation ' : In the name of the Polish
delegation, I congratulate the Business Com-
mittee on having submitted to us the plan
now before us, a plan which makes it possible
for us to discuss the question of drugs in all
its bearings.
As regards this plan, we have been struck by
the fact that the consuming countries, that is
to say, the countries which bear the full burden
of the opium traffic, are to be admitted to colla-
borate with the producing countries in the
first three Sub-Committees which have been
proposed.
I venture, however, to note one or two points.
The project now submitted to us appears in the
nature of a heavy and unwieldy piece of mecha-
nism. It is proposed that we should appoint
two general Committees, on which all the
delegations at the Conference would be represent-
ed, and six fairly large Sub-Committees. If this
is done, I am afraid that our work will not
proceed very rapidly. In my opinion, the sug-
gestion just made by the Swiss delegate in
regard to the second general Committee is a
wise one. The task to be entrusted to the
second general Committee might be handed
over to a Drafting Committee. Moreover, the
appointment of a second general Committee
is not necessary at present, as this Committee
cannot start its work until it is in possession
of the results of the first Committee?s proceed-
ings.
As regards the special Sub-Committees, six
appears to me to be a somewhat excessive num-
ber, and I have a few remarks to make in regard
to the composition of these Sub-Committees.
The First Sub-Committee, the duty of which
will be to consider all suggestions for the limi-
tation of the manufacture of drugs, is to consist
of ten members, including six representatives of
the producing countries, three representatives
of the consuming countries and a representa-
tive of the United States.
The Second Sub-Committee, which is to
consider suggestions for the limitation of the
production of opium for export, is composed of
five representatives of the producing countries
and two representatives of the consuming
countries.
The Third Sub-Committee, which is to consi-
der suggestions for the limitation of the produc-
tion of the coca-leaf for export, consists of three
representatives of the producing countries and
only one representative of the consuming
countries.
On what basis has the Business Committee
proceeded in fixing these figures ? Why, in
these first three Sub-Committees, are the
producing countries more fully represented
than the consuming countries ? It is the con-
suming countries which bear all the burdens
and experience all the disadvantages arising
from the traffic in dangerous drugs ; it would
be only just, in my opinion, to give them, in
each of these Sub-Committees, a number of
places at least equal to that of the producing
countries.
I venture, therefore, to lay the following pro-
posal before the Conference : that each of the
Sub-Committees shall include the same number
of representatives of the consuming countries
as of the producing countries.
If my proposal is adopted, the work of the
Conference will be expedited.
Lastly, no member of this assembly could
explain to me why the interests of one group
of producers, for example, the coca planters,
should be better protected than those of another
group, such as the cultivators of the poppy,
vis-d-vis the consumer.
I would strongly urge the adoption of my
proposal, which is inspired by a desire for jus-
tice and equality.
This is all that I have to say regarding the
report now before us. I have no objection to
the principle underlying the project, and, in
order not to delay the work of the Conference,
I accept it as a whole, though I hope at the same
time that my remarks will receive considera-
tion.
I also support the proposal of the first Egyp-
tian delegate that hashish should be included
in the programme of the Conference.
The President
Translation : I will ask the first Polish
delegate to be good enough to hand in in
writing his proposals for the modification of
the Sub-Committees.
M. Sze, delegate of China, will address the
Conference.
M. Sze (China)
Mr. President, members of the Conference
I was one of the members of the Sub-Committee
who voted against the proposal that has been
laid before you by the delegate of the British
Empire. I therefore feel it my duty to say a
few words as to the reason why I did not find
it possible to subscribe to the proposition which
is now before you.
First of all, let me tell you that the Sub-
Committee sat yesterday morning from half-
past ten to one o?clock and it met again in the
afternoon from half-past three till eight o?clock ;
in other words, the Sub-Committee sat for
seven hours. This fact shows you that the
Sub-Committee considered that the matter
entrusted to it was one of supreme importance,
so much so that it found it necessary to ask the
President to adjourn the plenary meeting
yesterday afternoon in order that ample time
might be given to the subject of most supreme
importance. A summary has been distributed
to you of what happened in the morning.
The President ;
Translation : I beg your pardon. That short
summary was only sent to the members of the
Committee.
tVI. Sze (China)
I beg your pardon. I am wrong. A short
summary has been distributed to the members of
the Committee.
This is what happened. Various proposals
were put forward as to the manner in which
the Business Committee ought to make its
report. Ihe different views were put before
the Committee in detail, but up till one o?clock
there was no tangible result.
There was first the proposal submitted by the
British delegation, and secondly, that submit-
ted by my honourable friend from Switzerland ;
there were also other proposals, notably one by my
friend the delegate of the Netherlands, supported
by France and India.
At the beginning of the afternoon meeting
my friend from Holland with-drew his proposal,


so that finally there remained only two proposals
before the Committee, the Swiss and the
British. It was then suggested that a small
Drafting Committee should be formed in
order to reduce the proposals to writing,
and if possible to prepare one proposal only.
After an adjournment, the Committee met
again, and there were two texts before it one
the British proposal as presented to you this
morning, and another one drafted by the
Swiss delegate. Later, the delegate o e
United States asked a question, but he did not
put his question into the form of a resolution
or any definite proposal. He asked a question
with reference to the scope of this Conference,
whether amendments to the Hague Convention
of 1912 could be presented to the Conference
and discussed. ,
If you read carefully the proposal presented
to you this morning by the delegate for the
British Empire, you will see that it is to the
effect that, to a limited degree, this Conference
can discuss and amend the 1912 Convention ,
the limitation, however, is this, that the dis-
cussion must remain strictly within the limits
of the agenda as distributed in the form of an
invitation to the different Governments. The
President of our Conference, who was also the
Chairman of the Business Committee, called
attention to Resolution VI, adopted by the
fourth Assembly of the League of Nations,
which reads as follows ;
?The Assembly... requests the Council,
as a means of giving effect to the principles
submitted by the representatives of the
United States of America, and to the policy
which the League, on the recommendation
of the Advisory Committee, has adopted, to
invite the Governments concerned to send
representatives?, etc.
Let me tell you in a few words what the diffe-
rence of opinion was in the Committee. There
was one trend of opinion which said that tins
Conference should rigidly limit itself to the terms
of the invitation. The President, however, pointed
out as I have said, that this was somewhat
qualified by the terms of Resolution VI, adopted
bv the fourth Assembly. There was another
school, led by my friend Mr. Porter which said
that on humanitarian grounds there should
be a certain elasticity, and that the Conference
should have the right to discuss any of the
articles of the Hague Convention of 191 2_
That is the crux of the whole question, it i
am wrong, I should like my friends the dele-
gates of the British Empire and of the United
States to correct me.
I will now ask leave to read to you a written
statement explaining why I voted against the
proposal presented to you this morning y
the delegate of the British Empire.
The Chinese delegation has this to say with
regard to the scope of this Conference. My
delegation understands that this Conference has
been called in order that the Powers represented
here may agree upon common action lor the
full realisation of the aims of the Hague Con-
vention ; these aims have been officially declared
in the two American resolutions presented
to the Opium Advisory Committee at its fifth
session, and, with certain reservations as to
legitimacy, under the Hague Convention of
the use of prepared opium, approved by the
Assembly of the League of Nations.
These resolutions read as follows ;
?i. If the purpose of the Hague Opium
Convention is to be achieved according to
its spirit and true intent, it must be recog-
nised that the use of opium products tor
other than medicinal and scientific purposes
is an abuse and not legitimate
?2 In order to prevent the abuse ot
these drugs, it is necessary to exercise the
control of the production of raw opium in
such a manner that there will be no surplus
available for non-medicinal and non-scien-
tific purposes.?
The determination of the League to invite all
the nations of the world to assemble, through
their representatives on this Conference, was
predicated upon the American proposals. n
its report of June 16th, 1923, to the Council of
the League, the Advisory Committee says ;
?These proposals were amplified by the
United States representatives, who, in com-
menting on them, showed that they were
in full accordance with both the letter and
the spirit of the International Opium
Convention of 1912. .
?The Committee very fully examined the
proposals of the United States. It would
be difficult in a short space to summarise
the discussions which took place, but a
full report of them is included in the Min-
utes of the meetings and refei ence should be
made to them.
?After a long discussion, and on the pro-
posal of a Drafting Committee, which was
appointed to prepare the final text, the
Committee adopted unanimously the follow-
ing resolution.?
Then follows the resolution, the fourth para-
graph of which reads '.
?As a means of giving effect to the prin-
ciples submitted by the representatives of
the United States and the policy which the
League, on the recommendation of the
Committee, has adopted, and having regard
to the information now available, the Advi-
sory Committee recommends to the Council
the advisability of inviting the Govern-
ments to enter into immediate negotia
tlons to consider whether, with a view
to giving the fullest possible effect to the
Convention of 1912, agreements could not
now be reached between them.?
There then follows in the resolution of the
Advisory Committee a statement of the various
points upon which it is desirable that agree-
ment should be reached. No statement or
suggestion is made by the Committee, nor by
the Assembly of the League which approved the
resolution, that the points thus enumerated
exhausted all those that might be involved in
any common agreement which might be reached
by the nations with a view to giving the
fullest possible effect to the purposes of the
Hague Convention as defined in the American
resolutions.
This Conference would be controlled by an
extraordinarily technical, not to say strained,
interpretation of its province and powers were
it to decide that it could examine, and come to
agreement, only upon those points which, by
way of description rather than by way of
limitation, the Advisory Committee and the


Assembly deemed desirable to refer to in their I have advocated the representation of all the
O /"'vl ii4-l /~�ci ..i. n - 1 1 J 1 1 i 1, 1 -i . ? , .
resolutions. Certainly it had not occurred to
the Chinese delegation that the Conference would
consider itself competent to consider only
measures directly relating to the points enu-
merated by the Advisory Committee and by
the Assembly of the League.
Certainly, also, it has been the expectation of
the peoples of the world that the Conference
should seek in every way possible to abate, and
if possible wholly to correct, the evils that now
result from the abuse of opium, of cocaine, of
their derivatives, and of other similar narcotic
drugs.
Apart from other and more general considera-
tions, the Chinese delegation is concerned with
the matter at issue, since it desires that the Confe-
rence should give its favourable consideration
to certain proposals which the delegation will
make for carrying out effectively the provisions
of Chapter IV of the Hague Convention.
{Applause.)
The President :
Translation : I did not wish to interrupt
the first part of M. Sze?s speech, but I venture
now most courteously to remind the first
Chinese delegate that it is not in accordance with
the procedure of the League to mention at a
public meeting any names or facts connected
with the proceedings of a private Committee.
Although there is nothing secret about the
work of the Business Committee, it seems to
me to be unfortunate that its proceedings should
be referred to here publicly. I would ask the
Chinese delegate, with all courtesy, to avoid this
in future.
M, Sze (China) :
If I have contravened the policy adopted by
previous Conferences, I beg your pardon. I
thought that if I gave my statement to the
newspapers last night I should be abusing the
confidence of the Business Committee, but I
believed that matters would be on a different
plane if I only brought the point before my
colleagues. If my idea is wrong, I am ready
to submit to anything you may decide.
The President
Translation : I beg to thank the Chinese
delegate for his courteous remark.
IV!. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : I wished a moment ago to
remove a misunderstanding which I thought
might possibly arise in regard to the report
of our Committee. lam sorry to find from the
remarks of my Polish colleague that I was not
completely successful.
I repeat, therefore, that, in the opinion of all
the members of the Business Committee, the
Second Committee has an independent task
which it can begin at any moment. If you will
refer to the programme of the Advisory Com-
mittee, you will see the useful and well-consi-
dered proposals which have already been placed
before us by that Committee for strengthening
the Hague Convention. This is quite indepen-
dent of any questions coming within the compe-
tence of the First Committee.
The question before us is not, therefore, that
of a Sub-Committee or of a Drafting Committee,
but rather of an important Committee, and I
would remind you that from the very beginning
delegations on this Committee ; for lam con-
vinced that its programme concerns all the
delegations though perhaps in varying
degrees and that this programme is of
sufficient moment to every one of them for their
collaboration to be most desirable.
M. Emmanuel (Greece) :
Translation: Mr. President I wish to sup-
port the proposal of the Egyptian delegate.
We hear continually of opium, morphine and
heroin as drugs. Unfortunately, these are
not the only ones. There are, besides, a certain
number which are not mentioned (other opium
alkaloids and derivatives ; pantopon, hashish,
ether, psycaine, etc.) ; it would be better there-
fore if the word "drug? were taken to mean
any harmful drug already known or which may
be discovered.
I suggest that the Sixth Sub-Committee be
asked to define all these drugs.
The President :
Translation : Ido not think that the Greek
delegate?s proposal involves any amendment
of the plan of work. The First Committee
would appear to be the proper body to deal
with this proposal. Does the Greek delegate
accept this view ?
M. Dendramis (Greece)
Translation : The Greek delegation requests
that this suggestion be referred to the First
Committee for examination.
The President :
Translation : This question cannot be re-
ferred to the First Committee until the latter
has been appointed. The simplest procedure ap-
pears to me to be that, at the first meeting of
the First Committee, the Greek delegation
should submit the proposal put forward here.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) ;
In the opinion of the delegates of the United
States, the report of the Business Committee
seems to curtail the scope of the Conference.
It may not do so, but, on the other hand, it
may. We have no desire to delay matters,
and therefore I shall put on record a statement
in the nature of a reservation :
It is the opinion of the Unites States delega-
tion that the report of the Business Committee
may unduly curtail the scope of the Conference,
and my delegation, having no desire to delay the
work, will vote in favour of the adoption of
the report, but on the express condition that
it will be permitted to present to the Conference,
or to the appropriate Committees thereof, for
consideration on their merits, the suggestions
of the United States, or such portions thereof
as it may deem germane to the purpose of the
Conference. Our instructions are such that
we should find it difficult to proceed further in
the Conference without this clear understand-
ing.
The President :
Translation : I regard the statement of
the United States delegate as a statement
affecting his vote ; it will be entered in the
record of the meeting.


Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia) :
Translation : I should like to thank the
Business Committee for its recep-
tion of my proposal and also to thank tne Pre-
sident for his courteous reply.
I consider that the proposal of the Polish
delegation, that the producing and consuming
countries should be equally represented on the
Sub-Committees, is both fair and reasonable
and I heartily support it.
IVSr. Mac White (Irish Free State) :
Translation : I wish to support the proposal
of Dr. Chodzko, the Polish delegate. It was
my intention to submit a similar proposal.
I am glad to find that there are other delegates
of my opinion at this Conference. \Ve must
take advantage of the experience of the Inst
Conference and not arrive at the same resu | ts .j
Non-producing countries are also interested
in the matter and we should take this fact in o
account in order that the Conference ma}
able to draw up a Convention.
IVSr. Campbell (India) :
I should like to call the attention of
ference to the remark made by Sir Mako
Delevingne in introducing the report ,
Committee, when he pointed out that the w r -
ing adopted in the programme submitted to the
Conference did not prejudge m any way t
question of competence. It is for that reas
that I have not intervened m the deb atm
For the moment, I merely wish to make it
nuite clear that the Indian delegation reserves
the right to discuss and speak on the question
at a later stage. If the Conference wishes to
raise the question of competence now, wei are
of course, prepared to discuss it , lf I Y Y
so however, I think it would be much more
convenient if that question, which has only
been raised incidentally and which, as I have
pointed out, is not relevant, or at any rate no
strictly relevant, to the question now under
discussion, were postponed. ? j the
My only object in speaking is to remind t
Conference that the programme presented by
Sir Malcolm Delevingne can be accepted w
out prejudging in any way the question o
competence^anti to reserve to my dekga ton. the
right to discuss that question of competence at
a later stage.
The President :
Translation :As no one else widest 0 speak,
I now declare the general discussion on th
port of the Business Committee closed. I w
therefore ask the Rapporteur of the?
to replv to the various observations that have
Un made, and I think that
discussion should be confined to the points raise
this morning by the various delegations.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Rapporteur of the Business Committee .
Before I reply, may I ask what motions for
the amendment of the proposals made by the
Business Committee have been hande
The President :
Translation : The only proposal submitted
in writing is the Polish proposal. ? There is
in addition, the Egyptian delegation s proposal
with regard to hashish. As this matter, hov
ever, does not come within the scope of our
discussion, I have not yet had it roneoed for
distribution
SVS. Sugimura (Japan) ;
Translation : To sum up the Japanese
point of view, we want a wider interpretati
of the phrase in the third paragraph of the
report ? ? or which may be submitted by
any delegation?.
The President :
Translation : Is M. Sugimura proposing an
amendment to the text ?
IV!. Sugimura (Japan) ;
Translation :I am not proposing an amend-
ment to the text, but I wish again to emphasise
our hope that it will be interpreted more widely.
The President
Translation: I ask Sir Malcolm Delevingne to
be good enough to reply as regards the principle
of the Polish proposal. The actual text will be
distributed shortly.
Sir EVlalcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Rapporteur of the Business Committee .
As there is only one motion before the Con-
ference for the amendment of the scheme sub-
mitted by the Business Committee, namely, the
Polish amendment, I will deal with that first.
The Polish delegate asked the reason for the
inequality in the numbers of the First, Second and
Third special Sub-Committees as between the
manufacturing or producing countries on the
one hand and the consuming countries on the
other; he complained, or alleged, that the repre-
sentation of the consuming countries was ina-
dequate. His proposal is that as many repre-
sentatives of the consuming countries should
be placed on these Sub-Committees as there
are representatives of the manufac curing or
producing countries.
The reason for the inequality (if it may be
called inequality) is this. The chief difficulty
in the problem of securing an agreement as to
the limitation of the manufacture of the drugs,
morphine, heroin and cocaine, and the chief
difficulty in connection with the problem of
securing a limitation of the production, for
export of raw opium or the coca-leaf, as the case
may be, is the difficulty of getting the manufac-
turing or producing countries to come to an
agreement between themselves.
The manufacturing countries, in the case ot
drugs, and the producing countries, in the case
of the raw material, compete among them-
selves for the world markets, and the great
difficulty with which the Preparatory Committee,
in the first place, and the Advisory Committee,
in the second place, have been faced throughout
their consideration of the subject since the
beginning of this year, has been this difficulty
of securing an agreement between the nations
which are competitors in the world markets
for the drugs or for the raw material, as the case
may be. ?
That is why the chief elements in these first
three Sub-Committees which are suggested for
dealing with this problem of limitation are the
groups of competing countries in regard to
these respective matters.
The consuming countries, naturally, have a
very considerable interest in the matter. Their


interest is to see that neither the limitation of
the manufacture of the drugs, nor the produc-
tion of the raw material, nor the restrictions
placed on import, export or distribution is
carried to such lengths as to deprive them
of the supplies which they require for medical
and scientific purposes in their own countries.
From the necessities of the case, they can
obviously have no part in any agreement which
may be reached between the manufacturing or
producing countries.
The terms on which the manufacturing or
producing countries may agree upon a joint
scheme of limitation is not a matter on which the
votes of the consuming countries would have
a decisive influence. Their interest, as I have
said, lies in seeing that the supplies of the drugs
which are produced for the world?s consumption
reach them in sufficient quantities for their
medical and scientific requirements.
The representatives of the consuming coun-
tries, therefore, hold what in England is called
a watching brief, and I thought (and I think
the Committee generally thought) that the
interests of the consuming countries, which
are obviously very largely the same in all
cases, would be adequately represented on these
Sub-Committees by the number of representa-
tives we have suggested. Their function will be to
see that the point of view of the consuming
countries is not lost sight of in these nego-
tiations.
May I point out another thing, namely, that
the interests of the consuming countries are
also adequately protected by the appointment
of a fourth special Sub-Committee, which, as I
explained in the report I submitted to the Con-
ference this morning, will regard these problems
of limitation from the point of view of the con-
sumer. The consumers will thus have a special
Sub-Committee of their own, which will exa-
mine, from the point of view of the consumer,
the suggestions which have been put forward
by the Opium Advisory Committee with regard
to the limitation of manufacture, the restric-
tions on export and so forth. Surely, this is
the most adequate safeguard for the interests
of the consuming countries ?
I need hardly add that the larger a committee,
the more conversation there will be, the longer
the discussions will take and, I might almost
sav, the less likely it is that the Committee
will come to a conclusion. In view of that ex-
planation, I would suggest to the Polish dele-
gate that he need not press his amendment,
and that the scheme of the Business Committee
might be allowed to stand as it is.
Various points were raised and suggestions
made by delegations which have not moved
formal amendments, but courtesy demands
that I should make, quite briefly, a few obser-
vations on the points raised. First let me say
that I have no wish to enter and no intention of
entering into the general question of competence.
As*the President has pointed out, it is a pro-
posal for a programme and method of work
which has been submitted by your Business
Committee.
In my report to the Conference I studiously
avoided any question of competence. This
question is of so much importance, and will
give rise to so much discussion if it is ever
raised, that, surely, on every ground, as well
as those of convenience and expedition, we
should avoid it this morning. I do not therefore
propose to raise and discuss the general ques-
tion of competence which has been referred
to by some of the delegates.
A very interesting proposal has, however,
been put forward by the delegate of Egypt, and
supported by the delegate of Greece, in regard
to the subject of hashish. This proposal raises
two questions, the question of competence, into
which I do not propose to enter, and the ques-
tion of merit. The Conference as a whole
may not know, but, certainly, many of the
delegations present do know, that this
matter has been under consideration by the
Opium Advisory Committee of the League.
The South African Government, I think, last
year sent to the League a suggestion to the
effect that Indian hemp, which is the plant
from which hashish is obtained, should be treated
as one of the habit-forming drugs and that
it should be brought within the scope of the
Hague Convention.
The Advisory Committee considered the
matter at its session this year and passed this
resolution :
?With reference to the proposal of the
Government of the Union of South Africa
that Indian hemp should be treated as
one of the habit-forming drugs, the Advi-
sory Committee recommends the Council
that, in the first instance, the Governments
should be invited to furnish to the League
information as to the production and use
of, and traffic in, this substance in their
territories, together with their observa-
tions on the proposal of the Government
of the Union of South Africa. The Com-
mittee further recommends that the ques-
tion should be considered at the annual
session of the Advisory Committee to be
held in 1925.??
The Council sent, this month, a letter to the
Governments to that effect, and the replies,
of course, have not yet been received. But
when the replies have come in, they will
be referred to the Advisory Committee for
consideration. I suggest to the delegates of
Egypt and Greece that this Conference has not
in its possession the materials which will enable
it to deal with the subject at the present time.
Therefore, any discussion which might arise in
the Conference could only be very one-sided
and very incomplete, and, accordingly, we should
not be able to arrive at any definite conclusion.
I see no objection at all to an interchange
of views on this subject ; I see no reason
why the delegates of Egypt and Greece
should not put before the Conference, either in
Committee or otherwise, all the information
they have upon the subject of the use and abuse
of hashish. It would be very interesting and
very useful to the members of the Conference,
and especially to the Advisory Committee
when it meets next year, if that information
is given.
Some of us know that the question of hashish
is a very important one. We know that it
is especially important in Egypt, and Great
Britain has co-operated already with the Egyp-
tian authorities in regard to this matter. I
have in mind, in particular, one attempt to
smuggle a very large amount of Indian hemp,
I think amounting to ten tons, into Egyptian
territories, and it is a matter which does deserve
very careful consideration and action. I do


not deal at more length with it now because, j
as the President has suggested, and I think his
suggestion has been accepted by the delegates of
Greece and Egypt, the matter should be raised
in Committee, if at all, and not on our present
programme of business.
The delegate of Switzerland desired to remove !
what he thought was a misunderstanding to
which my report this morning might rise.
In my report I did not use the words ? such
revision of the Hague Convention as may be
necessitated by any scheme of limitation?.
I thought that the appointment of a General
Committee to consider the revision of the Hague
Convention was a matter which, as the subject
is not specifically included in our agenda,
needed some explanation. I desired therefore
to point out that any scheme of limitation of
manufacture or production would involve the
revision of the Hague Convention, and I think
the delegate of Switzerland will find that all
the matters which are included in the scheme
of the Opium Advisory Committee, and prob-
ably almost any matter which is within the
scope of the existing Hague Convention, can
be raised in that Committee.
I do not think I have anything to say in parti-
cular with regard to the general observations
which were made by the delegations of Japan
and China. They covered largely the same
ground as we covered yesterday in the Business
Committee and I do not think it would be useful
for me to enter into any general discussion,
since those delegations have moved no formal
motion.
Finally, there is the important reservation
handed in by the delegation of the United States
of America, which says that it will vote ?in
favour of the adoption of the report of the
Business Committee, on the express condition
that it will be permitted to present to the Con-
ference or appropriate Committees thereof,
for consideration on their merits, the suggestions
of the United States, or such portions thereof
as it may deem germane to the purpose of the
Conference?.
I understand that the last ?it? really refers
to the American delegation, which makes a
condition ?that it will be permitted to present
to the Conference or appropriate Committees
thereof, for consideration on their merits, the
suggestions of the United States, or such por-
tions thereof as the delegation of the United
States may deem germane to the purpose of
the Conference?. This reserve, of course, raises
the general question of competence which we
have tried to avoid the question whether any
particular subject is or is not included in our
agenda. I do not therefore propose to say
anything on that point at the moment. The
President has pointed out that it is possible
to raise all these questions in the Committees,
and they will have to be decided there. (
Dr. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : I wish to thank the Rapporteur
of the Business Committee for his frankness,
which was just what I desired. I understand
that the object in view in appointing the Sub-
Committees is to bring about an understanding
between the producing countries. If this is
the object in view, why should the consuming
countries be represented on those Sub-Commit-
tees ? It is these countries, according to Sir
Malcolm Delevingne, that prevent the producing
countries from arriving at an understanding.
We have already had examples of this.
The Irish delegate stated that representatives
of the producing countries had been summoned
by the League to Geneva four times during
the course of this year. The First Conference
consists only of representatives of the produc-
ing countries and no understanding has been
reached.
If the producing countries predominate on
the Sub-Committees, there is no guarantee
that the latter will arrive at an agreement, for,
as the Rapporteur most truly said, they are
competitors in the world?s markets and are
looking for the best market for their products.
What is meant by a market ? It is a place
where the consumption of opium and cocaine
is very heavy. All the consuming countries,
as you know, complain that it is very difficult
to suppress smuggling. The reason is that in
the producing countries the manufacture of
opium and cocaine is in excess of the legitimate
requirements.
We have also been told that the production
of opium is nine or ten times in excess of the
legitimate requirements. If, then, the over-
production of opium is so enormous, smuggling
will never be suppressed. This must be can-
didly stated. If, then, the producing countries
represented on this Sub-Committee cannot
arrive at any conclusion, the question we have
to ask ourselves is what means we are to employ
to come to an understanding in the future.
A great danger threatens the fate of our Con-
ference. I think, therefore, that it is essential,
on the contrary, that the consuming countries
should be represented on this Sub-Committee.
It will be easier, in my opinion, to reach an
agreement. The interests of the consumers
j are the most important. I must maintain
this view, and I think that the majority of
my colleagues will be of the same opinion.
Consumers must be put on the same footing
as producers. I would not place them in the
majority, although to do so would be quite
legitimate. I make this conciliatory proposal
as I wish the two groups of countries to be
placed on an equal footing.
But, according to what the Rapporteur says,
the consuming countries will merely be obser-
vers. I ask you, therefore, gentlemen, if
three-quarters of the members of this Conference
are only observers, what result shall we reach ?
We are here not to observe but to decide. We
have definite instructions from our Govern-
ments. We do not wish our rights to be
impaired and I emphatically protest against
this weakening of our powers.
The Rapporteur tells us that if we wish to
discuss our interests, we can do so in the Fourth
Sub-Committee, which consists of representa-
tives of the consuming countries. But I
ask you what motions or proposals could ever
reach this Fourth Sub-Committee if in the three
other Sub-Committees the producing countries
were in a majority. It would be purely orna-
mental and would not be a real working Sub-
Committee.
If therefore I propose that these three Sub-
Committees be constituted in a more equitable
fashion, it is to spare our Conference the fate
of the First Conference. A few days ago there
appeared in one of the Geneva papers a very
witty article in which it was stated that the
First Conference was dying an ungraceful death.


X do not wish the Second Conference also to
die an ungraceful death, nor do I wish the
League I will not say to die but to have
its vitality weakened as a result of the failure
of our Conference.
Let me state, in conclusion, that I would
emphatically urge my proposal, which I beg
the President to put to the vote. I also wish
to thank the Persian and the Irish delegates
for supporting my suggestion.
The President :
Translation : Before calling upon the two
remaining speakers on my list, I wish to take
the opinion of the members of the Conference
and to ask if it is their desire that we should
continue our discussion at the present meeting
or adjourn it to the next meeting, which will
take place this afternoon at 3.30 p.m.
In addition to the speeches of the two dele-
gates on my list, we have to hear the reply of
the Rapporteur. We also have to continue our
discussion of the Polish delegation's proposal:
we may have to take a vote and we have to
examine afresh the Spanish proposal.
Mr. Campbell (India) ;
May I ask if any arrangements have been
made with regard to the First Conference meet-
ing this afternoon ?
The President :
Translation : The First Conference will not
meet until Monday afternoon.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba) :
Translation : The remark just made by the
President seems to me a very important one.
We have been sitting since 10.30 and it is now
1 o?clock. The discussions have been carried
on in French and English, and there are limits
to our powers of attention. Moreover, I am
afraid that, if we continue this discussion
now, the important point raised by the Polish
delegate may not receive all the attention
which it deserves. I therefore think that we
should adjourn the meeting now and meet
again this afternoon. [Applause.)
The President :
Translation : The Cuban delegate has
placed before you the very reasons which led
me to suggest the adjournment of our meeting.
The next meeting will therefore take place at
3.30 p.m.
The Conference rose at 1. p.m.

24. EXAMINATION OF THE FIRST REPORT
OF THE BUSINESS COMMITTEE : CON-
TINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
The President :
Translation : We will continue the discus-
sion on the first report of the Business Committee.
The only speaker on my list is H.E. Dr. El Guindy,
Egyptian delegate.
Dr. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen I thank the honourable Rappor-
teur of the Business Committee for what he
has said regarding my proposal to add hashish
to the list of the narcotics with which we are
concerned. In my opinion, we ought not to
regulate the use of opium and its derivatives
only, but of all noxious drugs.
The Rapporteur added that the Advisory
Committee had proposed that the question of
hashish should be considered ; I do not
know whether it wil 1 have been considered in
its entirety by 1925. Am I to understand by
this that, if, after reading the short statement
I am preparing upon this question, the majority
of the delegates of the Governments repre-
sented at this Conference were in favour of my
proposal, it would nevertheless be impossible
for us to take a decision in the matter at this
Conference ?
In the meantime, by agreement with the
President, I will submit my proposal to the
competent Committee, and also another pro-
posal, which runs as follows :
?It should be henceforth understood
that any narcotic substance already known
and not at present classed among drugs,
but which, nevertheless, may be regarded
as a drug, and any other narcotic product
which may in future be discovered or manu-
factured shall automatically (that is to
say, without it being necessary to have
recourse to a further Conference) be subject
to the provisions of the Convention which
we desire to conclude.?


The President :
Translation : I understand that the dele-
gate of Egypt will in due time submit to the
competent Committee the other proposal which
he has just mentioned 1 .
Mehmed Sureya Bey (Turkey) :
Translation : I heartily support the sug-
gestion of our distinguished Egyptian colleague.
During the general discussion, I alluded to
another scourge in addition to opium from
which certain countries suffer. The proposal
of the Egyptian delegate makes provision for
this.
The President
Translation : There are no further names on
the list of speakers for the general discussion.
Do any other members of the Conference wish
to speak ?
Dr. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I apologise for speaking again,
but it is on a personal point.
In my speech this morning I quoted words
which had appeared in a Geneva paper with
reference to the First Opium Conference. I
gathered that some of my colleagues who
participated in the First Conference took ex-
ception to this quotation. The great respect
which I have for my colleagues of the First
Conference impels me to withdraw my words.
The President :
Translation : The Conference takes note
of the statement of the Polish delegate and it
will be recorded in the record of the meeting.
M. Pinto-Escalier (Bolivia)
Translation : Mr. President, I wish to make
a statement with regard to my vote. The
delegate of Poland, in referring to the report
of the Business Committee, of which I have
the honour to be a member, expressed the opi-
nion, if I understood him aright, that the Com-
mittee was not treating consuming and pro-
ducing countries on terms of equality, but that
the latter were represented too largely on the
Sub-Committees provided for in the report.
This would seem to suggest that the producing
countries have taken care to safeguard their
interests.
For my part, speaking as a delegate of a
country which produces raw materials, I feel
called upon to state that I am in agreement
with my honourable Polish colleague in claim-
ing equality of treatment for producing and
consuming countries.
I claim no privilege. On the contrary, I
desire that the problem confronting my country
and the point of view of my Government should
be made known and discussed freely and openly
and with no mental reservations.
The President :
Translation : The statement of the first
delegate of Bolivia is not merely a statement
explaining his vote, but constitutes positive
support of this amendment. This statement
will be recorded in the record of the present
meeting.
1 The proposal was examined by Sub-Committee
F. See Annex 29.
Mr. Campbell (India)
I had not intended to speak, but I think, I
ought to explain that, in the discussions before
the Business Committee, India took the same
point of view as has just been expressed by
the Bolivian delegation. India would have
no objection whatever to an equal number of
consuming countries being on the Sub-Commit-
tees where the producing countries are repre-
sented.
The President :
Translation : Before we proceed to vote, I
will ask the Rapporteur of the Business Com-
mittee whether he has anything to add.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Rapporteur of the Business Committee :
I should like to express my satisfaction
that the delegate of Poland has withdrawn his
reference to the work of the First Opium Confe-
rence. I am sure his action will be appreciated
by the members of the First Opium Conference.
As regards the Polish amendment, I have
no wish to prolong the discussion. I should
just like in passing, however, to correct two
points on which, I think, the Polish delegate
was a little inaccurate. The first point was
the statement that the manufacturing and pro-
ducing countries had already met and failed
to come to an agreement. That is not correct,
even as regards the manufacturing countries.
There has been no meeting, up to the present,
of all the manufacturing countries concerned,
and there has been no meeting at all of the
producing countries. I just say this in passing
in order to remove any misconception as to the
situation.
The second point was with regard to the
position of the consuming pountries on these
three Sub-Committees. He seemed to think
that the suggestion of the Business Committee
was that they should act as observers only.
That was certainly not its intention. Perhaps
his misunderstanding was due to a remark I
made this morning about the consuming coun-
tries holding a ?watching brief?. That may
have misled him, but it certainly was not
intended to imply that those countries occupied
the position of observers only.
I think it is quite clear from the discussion
which has taken place that the majority of
the members of the Conference is in favour of
the Polish amendment, and, in those circum-
stances, I am prepared, if the other members
of the Business Committee concur, to accept it.
In that way we might avoid taking a vote.
There is one other point which I want to
mention, but I do not know if I am in order
in mentioning it now. I should like to make
a small amendment to the proposal of the
Business Committee. Perhaps I might men-
tion it now, and, if it were considered prefe-
rable to discuss it later, we could adjourn it.
It is proposed that the second Sub-Committee,
which deals with the question of the production
of raw opium, should include, as producing coun-
tries, only the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes, Greece, Turkey, Persia and India.
We had overlooked the fact that Egypt was
a producing country not on a large scale
but still a producing country. lam informed
by the Egyptian delegation that production
is increasing there. I would therefore suggest


that the Egyptian delegation be represented
on that Sub-Committee.
The President :
Translation : As no objection has been raised
to the Polish proposal by the members of the
Business Committee, and as none of them
appears to oppose its acceptance by the Rappor-
teur, Sir Malcolm Delevingne, I may conclude
that the Business Committee accepts the Pol-
ish proposal. It seems to me therefore unne
cessary to take a vote on the amendment put
by Sir Malcolm Delevingne. We can vote
on the first report of the Business Committee
in its entirety.
At the same time, I venture to mention to
the Polish delegate that the draft text of his
proposal does not meet the end in view. I
suggest therefore that the necessary corrections
should be made.
In my opinion, the Polish amendment should
be repeated three times, that is' to say, that
after the enumeration of the members of the
first, second and third Sub-Committees it
would be expedient to add the following :
?and an equal number of representatives of
the consuming countries?.
Does the Polish delegate accept this change
of wording ?
M. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : Willingly
The President :
Translation : The Rapporteur of the Busi-
ness Committee himself proposed the addition
of Egypt to the countries represented on the
second Sub-Committee. As no member of the
Business Committee has objected to this pro-
posal, I conclude that all the members of the
Conference are in agreement.
We will therefore vote upon the whole report
of the Business Committee, and not specially
upon the amendment proposed by Sir Malcolm
Delevingne, it being understood that Egypt
will also be represented on the second Sub-
Committee.
The second paragraph of Rule 13 of the Rules
of Procedure for our Conference lays down that
?Voting on resolutions to be taken by the
Conference shall be taken by a record vote,
the delegations being called in the French alpha-
betical order , unless the Conference decide
otherwise.?
I will ask the Secretary to take the roll-call
of the countries in the French alphabetical order,
and I ask the first delegate of each Government
to reply in the affirmative if he accepts the
report as a whole, and in the negative if he
does not wish to accept it.
[The roll was called.)

Mr. President I wish to make a reservation.
On the basis that I accept the British proposal,
I reserve to myself the right to present, for the
consideration and action of the Conference, any
proposal that I make under the Hague Conven-
tion of 1912. It is in that sense that I vote
?Yes?.
The President
Translation : 1 would point out to the Chi-
nese delegate that the proposal does not ema-
nate from the British Government but from the
Business Committee as a whole, which is an
organ of the Conference.
IV!. Sze (China)
Then I am ready to modify to that extent
what I have just said.
The President
Translation : The report of the Business
Committee is accordingly accepted in its en-
tirety by 31 votes, with two abstentions.
The report was adopted.
The President
Translation : I will call the attention of
the members of the Conference to page 2 of
the text of the report of the Business Committee
and to the paragraph referring to the second
Sub-Committee.
The wording is as follows : ?La deuxieme
Sous-Commission comprendrait les represen-
tants du Royaume des Serbes, Creates et Slove-
nes, de la Serbie, de la Grece, etc...? I will ask
the Secretariat to make the necessary correc-
tion by deleting the words ?de la Serbie?.
25. APPOINTMENT OF PRESIDENTS
OF COMMITTEES.
IV!. van Wettum (Netherlands)
As the work entrusted to both the Committees
is of equally great interest and as much depends
upon the ability of the Presidents of those
Committees, I propose, and I think I am speaking
in the name of all delegations, that our able
President, if he is prepared to do so, should
preside over the meetings of both Committees.
[Applause.)
The President :
Translation : I am very grateful for the kind
words of the delegate of the Netherlands, and
I am extremely grateful to the members of the
Conference for the way in which they have
welcomed his proposal. As everyone is agreed,
I consider that I have no choice but to accede and
to accept the chairmanship of the two chief Com-
mittees. I would only point out to you that
this double duty will prevent the Committees
from meeting at the same time.
As it may happen that towards the end of
our Conference we shall find it necessary to
summon meetings of the two Committees for
the same time, I will wait till [then before
proposing some other arrangement. L T ntil that
time I will fulfil the duties of President as best
I can, and I will ask you to grant me your
indulgence. [Applause.)


26. METHOD OF WORK OF THE COMMIT-
TEES AND SUB-COMMITTEES : COM-
MUNICATION BY THE PRESIDENT.
The President
Translation : Before proceeding to the next
item on our agenda, I should like, in closing
the discussion with regard to the Committees,
to ask you to give consideration to the compo-
sition of these Committees. I think they should
be formed as soon as possible, and, since you
have done me the honour of appointing me
President, I feel called upon to make a few
suggestions to you.
I think that we may expect that these Com-
mittees should begin their meetings by Monday
next. As the First Conference will be holding
its last meeting on Monday afternoon, I will
ask you to agree to a meeting of the First Com-
mittee on Monday morning, and of the Second
Committee on Tuesday morning, both meetings
at 10.30 a.m. At their preliminary meetings these
Committees will first have to decide whether
their meetings are to be public or private.
The rule of the Assembly of the League is,
as you know, that all meetings are held in public.
In the absence of a special provision, however,
the meetings of the Committees are private.
At the same time, we are free as regards our
Committees to make the meetings public.
I would like to draw your attention to one
last point. Do you want to enter upon a gene-
ral discussion regarding the various questions
coming before the Committees, or do you
prefer to establish as soon as possible the Sub-
committees provided for in the programme of
business which you have just adopted and which
are mainly to be created by the First Committee ?
Further, before we break up to-day, I should
like to fix the date of the meetings for the two
Committees.
You know that every delegation has the
right to be represented on these two Committees.
It is necessary, however, as far as possible, to
restrict the number of delegates. Each dele-
gation has to notify the name of its delegate,
and I would ask you to comply with this forma-
lity.
Although, according to the usage at all
meetings of the League of Nations, a delegate
may, if necessary, be accompanied by a secretary,
I venture to urge the need of restricting, as
far as possible, the number of persons sitting
upon these Committees.
27. CLASSIFICATION AND CONSIDERATION
OFTHE PROPOSALS AND SUGGESTIONS
MADE BY THE REPRESENTATIVES OF
THE PRIVATE ASSOCIATIONS: PRO-
POSAL BY THE SPANISH DELEGATION:
CONTINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
The President :
Translation : The second item on our
agenda concern the draft resolution submitted
by the Spanish delegation.
You will remember that at the sixth meeting
the Spanish delegation proposed the following :
"The Secretariat is instructed to collect
and classify the proposals and suggestions
made by the representatives of the private
organisations, and to communicate them
to the Business Committee in order that
the latter may submit them to the Commit-
tees to be formed during the Conference ;
these proposals and suggestions will be
distributed among the respective Commit-
tees which are competent to deal with
them.?
Does the Spanish delegate wish to speak
further in support of this proposal ?
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : Mr. President When I had
the honour to submit this proposal, several
delegates were absent. I would therefore like
to summarise the arguments which I put
forward at the time, and I would like to add
to-day the reasons why I think that my proposal
should be modified.
In listening to the very interesting statements
made by the representatives of the private
organisations, I was much struck by the poten-
tial value of their proposals and suggestions.
At the same time, I was struck by the difficulty
we should have in utilising them. If every
delegation were called upon to read all the
documents which have been distributed to us
and to deduce from them what they may
consider practical conclusions, they would be
faced with a heavy task.
If every delegation is to do this work it will
have to be done thirty-nine times, since there
are thirty-nine delegations. I consider that
it would be better for the Secretariat to under-
take this duty : this would have the double
advantage of saving us work and co-ordinating
the information received by the delegates. The
suggestion having been made simply to estab-
lish limited Committees, I had drafted my
proposal on the lines with which you are already
familiar. This morning I asked the President
to postpone the discussion, because I had taken
note of the first report of the Business Commit-
tee, which proposed to us the creation of gene-
ral Committees.
I consider therefore that the aspect of the ques-
tion has changed and I have accordingly re-
drafted my proposal as follows :
"The Secretariat is instructed to collect
and classify the proposals and suggestions
made by the representatives of the private
organisations and to communicate them
to the members of the Conference.?
Our documentation will thus be made more
easy and more uniform.
The President :
Translation : If I consider this last text to
be an amendment to the Spanish proposal,
I can, in conformity with Rule n, paragraph 3,
of our Rules of Procedure, authorise an immediate
discussion and the putting of the amendment
to the vote. If, however, we are to consider this
text as a fresh proposal, it cannot be discussed,
according to paragraph 2 of the same rule, until
it has been communicated to the delegates
in writing. In my opinion, it is more in the
nature of an amendment, and if the Conference
agrees, I will permit an immediate discussion
and vote.
As there is no opposition to this suggestion,
the discussion on this point is now open.


I just want to ask one question for informa-
tion. If the amendment proposed by the Span-
ish delegate to his own proposal is accepted
by the Conference, does Rule 5 of the Rules of
Procedure still stand ? Because it seems to
me they are in conflict.
IVI. de Palacios (.Spain)
Translation : I do not see any possible
conflict between our amended proposal and
Rule 5 of the Rules of Procedure. The dele-
gate of China is probably referring to the
second paragraph in this rule, which begins :
?The functions of the Committee shall be to
make proposals to the Conference for the ar-
rangement of the business of the Conference...?
I will examine the phrases in this paragraph
one after the other. As regards the first, w r e
have not granted to the Committee any exclu-
sive right of making proposals. The Conference
has not renounced its right to make any pro-
posals it may think fit. The next phrase runs :
?To nominate for the approval of the Confe-
rence, should occasion arise, the members of
any Committee which shall be constituted by
the Conference ; to examine and report on
communications made to the Conference by
private associations or individuals ; and to
report to the Conference.? I have proposed
that the Secretariat should prepare an analysis
and not a report. Ido not see how my proposal
can be regarded as conflicting with the compe-
tence of the Business Committee.
Mr. Campbell (India) ;
In the hope that it may perhaps shorten the
discussion, I should like to recall to the Confe-
rence the fact that, when the proposal was
presented by the delegate of Spain, the Indian
delegation was, I think, the only one which
objected to it. I should therefore like to say
at once that I am in agreement with the pro-
posal in its present form.
The President:
Translation : I should like to say a few
words in reply to M. Sze?s remarks, since his
words were addressed to a certain extent to
the President.
I, too, do not see any contradiction between
the two texts. The Business Committee has
to examine the proposals made by the private
associations. This paragraph remains unaffec-
ted, but, in order to facilitate the work of the
members of the Conference, the Spanish dele-
gate proposes that the Secretariat should exa-
mine and co-ordinate all the information that
reaches it. There is, therefore, no contradic-
tion between the Rules of Procedure and the
proposal of the Spanish delegate.
As there is no other speaker on the list, the
discussion is closed. We will now take the
vote. If the Conference has no objection,
we can vote by a show of hands. (Agreed.)
The Spanish proposal as amended was 'una-
nimously adopted by the Conference. 1
The Hon. Henri S. Beiand (Canada)
Translation : I should like to know whether
it is possible for a delegation to appoint one of
its members for one Committee and another
member for another Committee ?
The President.
Translation : In my opinion, such a proce-
dure would be in order.
SVI. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba) :
Translation : According to a precedent
furnished by the Assembly of the League, each
delegation appoints the delegate it desires to
represent it on the Committees. This prece-
dent might be observed in our case.
The President :
Translation : With regard to this matter,
I may add that, if the member appointed by a
delegation is prevented from being present at
a meeting and has to be replaced by another
member, it would be convenient to inform the
President.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : I only wish to say one word
which may serve to conclude this first, short,
but important part of our work. Last year,
when the United States Government drew the
attention of the Advisory Committee to the
growing danger of narcotics, the French Govern-
ment concurred in recognising the necessity
of completing the Hague Convention by new
international engagements.
After an agreement had been reached as
regards the ends in view, there arose differences
as regards the means. There were then signs
of anxiety, but yesterday, when the remarkable
draft of the United States delegation was read
to us, I became not merely hopeful, but certain,
that an agreement will be comparatively easy
and that the work of the Conference will be
crowned with success.
The Conference rose at 4.50 p.m.

28. EXAMINATION OF THE SECOND RE-
PORT OF THE BUS IN ESS COMM ITT EE.
The President
Translation : The first item on our agenda
is the discussion of the second report of the
Business Committee. In accordance with my
suggestion, to which you agreed, the Business


Committee met yesterday, and in the course
of its two meetings drew up a plan for the divi-
sion of the work between the two general
Committees. M. Dinichert, Swiss delegate, is
Rapporteur. I call upon him to address the
meeting and to give us certain explanations in
regard to this plan. After the report has been
adopted by the Conference there will be a
short discussion on certain other points. I
think that a plenary meeting of the First Confe-
rence can still be held this morning.
I call upon M. Dinichert, Rapporteur of the
Business Committee, to address the Conference.
IVI, Dinichert (Switzerland), Rapporteur of
the Business Committee:
Translation : You have before you, though per-
haps you have not yet had time to consider it,
the second report submitted by the Business
Committee (Annex 17). If you have found
time to glance through it, you will have seen
that it is, perhaps, of a somewhat tedious
nature. I beg to apologise, but would ask you
to consider that the matter under considera-
tion did not lend itself to attractive treatment.
I even thought it my duty in this report to
stress the fact that the Business Committee
met yesterday morning and again in the after-
noon, for I thought that one would hardly
gather this from reading the report. This is
the explanation :
You know that our President, with his usual
forethought, invited the Chairmen of the Sub-
Committees to be present at our discussion
yesterday. Our Committee was, therefore, larger
than usual and our President, who, fortunately
for us, possesses the virtue of patience among
his other qualities, gave us an opportunity
for full discussion. He, no doubt, thought that,
out of the clash of ideas a perfectly amicable
and courteous clash of ideas, needless to say
light would come.
Yesterday, towards dusk light did come but
in the form of a torch which had already been
lighted for several days. We remembered that
in our first report we had submitted to you a
suggestion that all questions contained in Part 1
of the Advisory Committee?s programme should
be referred to a First Committee and all those
grouped together in Part II to a Second Com-
mittee. We thought that, as these two Commit-
tees had been set up for this purpose, we would
refer the first group of questions to the First
Committee and the second group to the Second
Committee. You will realise that lam summa-
rising somewhat what happened in the Com-
mittee.
There are also, in the proposals submitted
to the Conference, certain questions which are
not explicitly included in the resolution of the
Assembly of the League of Nations of Septem-
ber 1923, nor in the Advisory Committee?s
programme which was accepted by the Govern-
ments. The Business Committee, therefore, had
to consider how these remaining questions
could be properly distributed between the two
Committees.
After a long discussion, we arrived at this
conclusion, which is a not unimportant one.
We decided that it was neither expedient nor
necessary at present to come to any final
decision as to the exact Committee to which
these questions should be referred : both Com-
mittees already have before them a programme
sufficiently heavy to keep them busy for some
time. They will not in any sense be idle, because
certain questions are not at present referred
to them.
You will realise, moreover, that any questions
pending would gain by being discussed la,ter
on when our work will be further advanced.
We shall be in possession of fuller information
and better able to judge of their importance,
and perhaps to foresee the consequences which
they involve. This, in short, is the reason why
these questions have been held over and have
not been definitely included in the plan for
the division of work now before you. I have
already informed you that Part I of the Advi-
sory Committee?s programme will be referred to
the First Committee and Part II to the Second
Committee.
Having decided this point, the Business
Committee proceeded to consider the draft
submitted by the United States delegation.
I think that many of us felt some regret at
being obliged ?if I might so express it to
dissect such an admirably constructed plan.
As it had been decided that questions coming
under Part I of the Advisory Committee s
programme should be referred to the First
Committee and those under Part II to the
Second Committee, it naturally followed that the
American draft should be distributed in the
same way. After discussion, we decided upon
the proposal which there is no need for me
to repeat, as it is included in the second report
of the Business Committee which is already
before you.
The Business Committee decided to leave on
one side for the time being the Preamble of the
American draft, interesting though it was, for
it felt that any Preamble was simply a sum-
mary of the contents of an agreement, and
it thought it better, before dealing with
the Preamble, to see what there was in the
agreement to which it was an introduction.
If you read through Article 1, you will note
that the subject with which it deals belongs
to the group of questions which we propose
to hold over. The same applies to Part 11,
which corresponds to Chapter II of the Hague
Convention. As regards the provisions which
follow, I think that our proposals explain
themselves. If this is not the case, I am of
course ready to give members of the Conference
any information which they may require.
In addition to the United States draft, a
number of proposals have been submitted to us
by other Governments. They are enumerated
in the report, and there is no need for me to
repeat them 1 .
These proposals have also been allocated
between the two Committees. The same applies
to the proposal submitted by the Chinese
delegation, with the proviso that, should diffi-
culties arise as to the admissibility of discussing
it, it should be referred to the Plenary Confe-
rence.
The substance of my last remark is also
briefly referred to in the report of the Business
Committee. It applies to all questions in
connection with which difficulties may arise
regarding their admissibility for discussion.
Such questions may always be referred to the
Plenary Conference.
If my colleagues on the Business Committee
1 Vide Annex 18 (with Appendix) and Annexes
18 a, 18 b, i 3 c.


will allow me, I should like to suggest one or
two alterations in the allocation of the work
between the different Committees. My first
proposal is in connection with Article XIII
of Part 11 of the Advisory Committee?s pro-
gramme, which as follows ;
?In the case of a country which is not
a party to this Agreement, the Governments
undertake not to allow the export to such
a country of any of the substances covered
by the Convention as amended by this
Agreement except such amounts as may
be fixed by the Central Board as being
reasonably required for the medical and
scientific needs of the country.?
I think that Article XIII should form part
of Part I and be referred, in consequence, to
the First Committee.
Article 20 L, of the draft submitted by
the United States delegation, reads as follows :
?In the case of a geographical area the
Government of which is not a party to
this Convention, the Contracting Parties
undertake to allow the export to such
geographical area of any of the substances
covered by this Convention only in such
amounts as may be fixed by the Central
Board as being reasonably required for
the medical and scientific needs of such
an area. The Central Board shall commu-
nicate periodically to all the Parties to
this Convention the amount fixed in res-
pect of each geographical area and the
situation as regards the exports and re-
exports thereto.?
I think that this article comes within the
competence of the First Committee and not
of the Second Committee as suggested in our
report.
I have one last remark to make. The Aus-
trian Government?s proposals, which were re-
ferred as a whole and somewhat hastily to the
First Committee, deal with export licences on
the one hand and questions of transit on the
other. Both these questions should properly
be referred to the Second rather than to the
First Committee.
These are the three slight modifications
which I wished to suggest to you, subject to
the approval of my colleagues on the Business
Committee, and which I should like to see
included in your plan for the allocation of the
work.
I would point out, in conclusion, that the Busi-
ness Committee invites your approval of the
plan which we have had the honour to submit
to you. [Applause.)
The President :
Translation : The Rapporteur has just
explained the plan submitted by the Business
Committee. I would ask the members of the
Conference to confine their remarks to a dis-
cussion of this plan.
Prince Arfa-ed- Dowleh (Persia) :
Translation: Mr. President. The Persian
delegation had the honour to submit a memo-
randum on opium which was distributed last
Sunday in French and English to all the dele-
gations. I think the delegates have had time
to read it 1 .
1 Vide Minutes of Sub-Committee B, Annex 7.
I should be grateful if the President would
tell me which Committee or Sub-Committee
has been instructed to deal with the proposals
submitted in this memorandum by my Govern-
ment with a view to its adhesion to the Hague
Convention and to its acceptance of the prin-
ciples put forward by the United States of
America.
The President
Translation : In reply to the Persian dele-
gate?s question, I have to inform you that the
Persian memorandum, consisting as it does of
37 pages and an annex of 33 pages, has not
yet been referred by the Business Committee
either to the First or to the Second Committee.
This document could not have received the
attention it deserves if it had been read at
yesterday?s meeting : I therefore held it
over, together with two other documents, in
order that it might be dealt with at a subse-
quent meeting, when the necessary time could
be devoted to it.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dow!eh (Persia) :
Translation : I am much obliged for your
explanation. I hope that the Business Com-
mittee will be able, as you have suggested, to
deal with the Persian memorandum and that
it will refer it to the competent Sub-Committee.
The President :
Translation : I think that the Persian me-
morandum will be dealt with at the next meet-
ing of the Business Committee.
M. Sze (China)
Mr. President and members of the Confe-
rence The Business Committee was most
fortunate in being able to get so distinguished
and so eloquent a member as the Swiss delegate
for its Rapporteur. He has explained to you in
a very lucid manner the work which was done
morning and yesterday afternoon in
the Committee.
I wish to say just one word with reference to
the report. At the bottom of page 3 there
is a note with reference to the Chinese proposal
which says that it was referred to the Second
Committee, with the reservation that, if a ques-
tion of competence should arise, the proposal
would be brought before the Plenary Conference.
Unless my memory has failed me badly, I
beg to say that that is not quite accurate.
One other delegation, in supporting my propo-
sal, said that it should be submitted to the
appropriate Committee or to the Plenary
Conference if any question of competence
should arise.
When the voting took place, nobody made
such a reservation, with the exception of one
delegate, who said that he would vote ?Yes?
on the understanding of the reservation made
previously. So far as I understand, no vote
was taken on that express reservation. Of
course, when the question of competence comes
up, it is to be referred either to the appropriate
Committee or to the Plenary Conference.
But, in view of the wording of the report, I thought
there was a possibility that the delegates
might receive a wrong impression, so I thought
it better to give you a personal explanation.
I did not hear exactly what the honourable
delegate for Switzerland said in his original
speech, but as I heard the interpretation, he said


As regards the second point, my recollection
of the matter agrees with that of M. Sze. A
vote was taken, but first of all, one delegation
made a reservation and during the vote another
delegate stated : ?I agree, subject to the
reservation made by I think, therefore,
that my proposals were sent in almost at the last
moment. I do not accept that statement as
being very accurate.
The President
Translation : Does the Rapporteur wish
to reply to M. Sze now, or would he prefer to
answer all the speakers at once ?
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : As the point raised by M. Sze
is of a special character, we might settle it
at once.
I would first of all point out that I am quite
sure that I did not say in my speech that the
Chinese proposal had been submitted to us
at the last moment. When my speech was
translated into English, I noticed a slight
discrepancy. I think I said that we had
before us a number of proposals from various
Governments and also a proposal submitted by
the Chinese delegation. I wished to direct special
attention to this latter proposal on account
of its intrinsic importance, and also of the
remarks to which it gave rise. I trust that
I shall be meeting the views of the Chinese
delegate if I inform you that I had no occasion,
as Rapporteur, to say that this proposal was
submitted to us at the last moment ; it was
dealt with in the same way as the other pro-
posals.
A more important point seems to me to be
the question of the reservation which I men-
tioned and to which I felt it necessary to refer
in the report. M. Sze is quite correct in what
he says regarding the objection to which reference
has been made in other words, the question
whether our Conference was to deal with this pro-
posal in the event of any question of compe-
tence being raised in Committee. If I remember
rightly, I think that the President of our
Committee stated in conclusion that this ques-
tion would be referred to the Second Committee,
subject to the reservation made. Personally,
I am quite prepared to meet the views of the
Committee in regard to this question of the
reservation.
IVI. Sze (China)
I wish to thank the honourable Rapporteur
for correcting the misunderstanding which
arose in my mind as a result of the interpretation
of his speech. As far as I remember, however,
a vote was taken by a show of hands, and one
delegate hesitated and finally said that he
would vote ?Yes? on the understanding of the
reservation made previously. The President
said that, in view of the fact that the majority
had voted in favour of referring it to the
Second Committee, there was no object in
asking those who might vote against it.
The President :
Translation : I wish to reply to the two
points raised by the Chinese delegate.
As regards the Chinese memorandum, the
position is perfectly clear. This document
was handed in to the Secretariat to be roneoed
on November 25th. It was distributed by the
Secretariat that same evening, so that the diffe-
rent delegations were in possession of it the
following morning. The Business Committee
held two meetings on that day, one in the morn-
ing and one in the afternoon ; we had the
document in time, but it was difficult to exa-
mine it thoroughly in so short a time.
that it would be more correct to modify the
paragraph referred to by M. Sze and to say
?subject to the reservations made by two dele-
gations?. The phrase is somewhat vague and
might be accepted by everybody. I will ask
the Rapporteur to re-draft this paragraph.
Does the Rapporteur wish to give any fur-
ther explanations in regard to the report ?
M. Dinichert (Switzerland) ;
Translation : If no one wishes for any
further explanations, it must be assumed that
everybody is agreed as to the proposals sub-
mitted to the Conference.
The President
Translation : It only remains for me, then,
to propose the adoption of the second report
of the Business Committee. If you have no
objection, we will vote by a show of hands rather
then by a roll-call.
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands) ;
Before we vote, may we know the exact
wording of the paragraph which has been re-
ferred to by M. Sze ?
The President
Translation : Will the Rapporteur be good
enough to draft this paragraph ?
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : If I have understood you
correctly, Mr. President, this paragraph should
read as follows : ?The Chinese proposal is
referred to the Second Committee, with a reser-
vation, formulated by two delegations, as
regards the competence of the Conference in
the matter.?
The President
Translation : I think this wording meets
the case.
Does anyone wish to speak on this text ?
Mr. Neville (United States of America) :
May I ask the Rapporteur if we are still
discussing the point raised by the delegate
for the Netherlands ? If that matter has been
satisfactorily cleared up, I have another ques-
tion which I should like to ask.
The President
Translation : The question raised by the
Chinese delegate has been settled. Does the
Netherlands delegate approve the drafting pro-
posed by he Rapporteur ?
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands)
Yes, certainly.
The President
Translation : The question raised by the
Netherlands delegate is also settled.
Mr. Neville (United States of America) :
I only want to ask one question. Am I
right in thinking that the Rapporteur has sug-
gested that paragraph XIII, which is in Part II


of the Advisory Committee?s scheme and which
carries with it the corresponding Article 20-L
of the American proposals, should be transferred
from the Second Committee to the First ?
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland), Rapporteur :
Translation : Yes; that was what I pro-
posed.
The President
Translation : The heads of the delegations
in favour of the adoption of the plan recom-
mended by the Business Committee are asked
to hold up their hands.
The second report of the Business Committee
and the plan contained therein for the division
of the work of the Conference were unanimously
adopted.
29. PRELIMINARY DISCUSSION ON TH E BA-
SIS OF THE SERIES OF MEASURES
ADOPTED BY THE ADVISORY COMMIT-
TEE ON THE TRAFFIC IN OPIUM AND
OTHER DANGEROUS DRUGS ; CONTI-
NUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
The President
Translation : The second item on our agenda
is the continuation of the general discussion.
I call upon the first delegate of Bolivia to address
the Conference.
M. Pinto-Escalier (Bolivia):
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gentle-
men I do not propose to give a detailed
statement of my Government?s attitude in regard
to the problem of narcotics as a whole or to the
programme submitted by the Advisory Com-
mittee on the Traffic in Opium. I will confine
myself to stating certain facts which corrobo-
rate my Government?s point of view in regard
to this programme and which may be summa-
rised as follows :
1. Bolivia is not a centre for the consumption
of or traffic in narcotics and it is hardly necessary
to say that my country does not produce or
manufacture opium or its derivatives.
2. Bolivia produces coca leaf, the moderate
use of which by natives cannot be considered
as harmful ; but she does not manufacture or
consume cocaine.
3. Almost her entire exports of coca leaf
are sent to countries which do not manufacture
cocaine and which do not re-export the coca
leaf.
These are the three principal points with
which I propose to deal as briefly as possible.
Perhaps, owing to circumstances which I
can hardly describe as fortunate, since they are
due, above all, to the fact that my country is
entirely cut off from the sea Bolivia has
hitherto been among the rare countries totally
free from the drug habit. It is possible also
that the same circumstances, which from other
points of view are so regrettable, have rendered
Bolivia an unfavourable market for the illicit
trade in narcotics. The consumption of cocaine
salts and of opium derivatives is extremely small
and is exclusively confined to medical uses.
During the year 1922 the importation of cocaine
totalled 260 grammes, a figure which will cer-
tainly not alarm the Conference.
This has not prevented Bolivia, as a signatory
of the Hague Convention, from taking an
interest in the grave problems of all kinds which
are being considered by the Second Opium
Conference for the success of which I beg
to tender my Government?s best wishes.
As Bolivia, however, is one of the countries
which produce the raw material required for
the manufacture of one of the narcotics with
which our Conference is dealing, and as, more-
over, my Government has stated its point of view
in the memorandum 1 , which I had the honour
to lay before the Advisory Committee at its
last session, I wish to-day to summarise once
more this point of view, which is in no respect
incompatible with the statements I have just
made.
Confining my attention to documents which
my honourable colleagues can easily consult,
I will refer to the communications my Govern-
ment has sent to the Secretariat of the League
of Nations.
One of these documents (O. C. 158) states that
Bolivia has confined herself from time immemo-
rial to producing coca leaf and has never
employed any process to obtain alkaloids from
these leaves.
The total production of coca leaf in Bolivia
may be estimated at 5.000 tons, and this quantity
is almost entirely consumed by the Indians in
the western part of the country. This coca
leaf is consumed in the raw state, i.e. without
having been treated in any way.
It should also be noted, as my Government
had the honour to state in the above-mentioned
memorandum, that the experience of several
centuries has shown the mastication of coca
leaf and the absorption of its juice to be per-
fectly innocuous.
The quantity of coca leaf chewed by an Indian
of the high plateaux of the Andes during his
lifetime may be estimated at hundreds of
kilogrammes. Nevertheless, these Indians are
hardy show extraordinary powers of end-
urance, and often live to a very advanced
age without suffering from the premature
decay which attacks organisms undermined by
the drug habit.
I would also like to point out that it is only
the Indians and never the whites or half-
castes who are in the habit of chewing the
leaves of what has been termed ?the divine
plant of the Incas?. This fact goes to show
that the habit has neither the contagiousness
nor the attraction which are the the characteri-
stics of all vices and particularly that of drug-
taking.
It is therefore not rash to assert that the use
of the coca leaf presents no social danger, that,
as I have already pointed out, it has no cor-
rupting influence morally and that physically
it does not weaken either the virility or the
vitality of those who consume it.
On the contrary, its use is, perhaps, a source
of energy and endurance to those whose lot
has been cast by nature on the highest portions
of the globe, often at an altitude almost prohi-
bitive of human life and comparable to that of
the top of Mont Blanc.
But, it will be urged, the coca leaf which
Bolivia exports is used to a large extent for the

manufacture of cocaine and this is what we
wish to avoid, or at least to control.
I accept the objection. But I wish to point
out, first, that we do not export the coca leaf
to countries which manufacture cocaine, and
secondly, as is shown by the table given below,
that the figures of our exports of coca leaf
have not followed the upward tendency of the
consumption of and traffic in narcotics.
The following are the figures for the last ten
years
In the course of the last four years, 1920-1923,
which were not dealt with in my report to the
Advisory Committee, Bolivia exported 1,396,399
kilos, of coca leaf to the following countries ;
negligible.
These tables demonstrate two facts which in
my opinion cannot be called in question and
which support my Government?s point of view.
1. The exportation of Bolivian coca leaf is
not increasing, although it is encouraged by
the demand of the foreign markets ; this
fact must not be attributed to any lack of ini-
tiative or activity on our part, but to the natural
conditions of the soil which, by preventing the
cultivation from being extended, have in prac-
tice limited the production.
2. More than 8/ioths of these exports go
to the Argentine Republic, which, according
to official information communicated to me by
the Argentine authorities, does not manufacture
cocaine and does not re-export coca leaf. Almost
all the remainder goes to Chile, which also
does not manufacture cocaine, according to
information I have received from an equally
authoritative source.
It is clear, therefore, that the question of
the production of coca leaf in Bolivia, which,
I repeat, has no influence on the cocaine market,
is a mere phantom which, on closer examination,
is found to have no terrors.
It also appears clear from what I have said
that it would be going too far to place the cul-
tivation of the coca leaf in the same category
as that of the poppy, as proposed in the pro-
gramme drawn up by the Advisory Committee,
which proposes to extend to the coca leaf,
without modification, the provisions of the
Hague Convention regarding opium. On this
point the attitude of my Government is very
clear, and it wishes an essential distinction
to be made, at least as far as Bolivia is con-
cerned, between the production and consumption
of opium on the one hand and of coca leaf on
the other. The consumption of coca leaf in
the raw state produces none of the ill effects
of which opium, narcotic alkaloids and other
Oriental drugs are accused.
I wish to state here my conviction that, if
the use of coca leaf had been recognised as per-
nicious, mv Government would not have hesi-
tated to combat its use, as it combats alcoholism
and as it will always combat any vice which
constitutes a threat to the health and welfare
of the Bolivian people.
I wish to add a point to which I would draw
the special attention of my colleagues, namely,
that the cocaine industry is not a source of
revenue to my country. Its exportation is
entirelv free and its production is only subject
to local taxes of negligible importance.
Such are the facts which in all sincerity I
desire to put before you.
I consider that the question of the production
of coca leaf in Bolivia is an exceptional one,
which I do not wish to compare with that which
arises in the other countries producing the same
raw material. Since Bolivia is in so exceptional
a position, my Government, to its great regret,
would be unable to accept any measure tend-
ing to prevent the use of the coca leaf in confor-
mity with the established custom of Bolivia,
or to hamper either its production or its expor-
tation for use in this way.
My Government is quite prepared, however,
to apply to its territory in the most liberal
spirit of co-operation all other measures in
keeping with the aspirations of our Conference.
In view of the importance attached by my
Government to the question of the production
of coca leaf, I venture to ask the President to
have the French text and the English transla-
tion of my statement distributed as a separate
document by the Secretariat. {Applause).
The President
Translation : The Bolivian delegate s state-
ment will now be interpreted. In view of
its importance, however, the official English
translation will be distributed later to the
members of the Conference.
I call upon M. Buero, delegate of Uruguay,
to address the Conference.
IVI. Buero (Uruguay) :
Translation : The Uruguayan delegation
avails itself of the opening of this general
discussion in order to make the following
statement;
The Uruguayan delegation will give its enthu-
siastic support to any measures which may be
proposed at this Conference with a view to
freeing mankind from the scourge of narcotic
drugs. As regards the limitation of the pro-
duction of raw materials, the supervision of the
traffic in these raw materials and their deriva-
tives, the control of importation and exportation,
re-exportation, storage, transit, shipment and
transhipment, supervision by means of tran-
sires, certificates, etc., it will help by every
means in its power, provided, of course, that
the said measures are practicable and compa-
tible with the international responsibility of
States.
The Uruguayan delegation is therefore pre-
pared to give its careful consideration to any
observations which may be made by the dele-
gates to this Conference with regard to the
whole or part of the measures proposed by the
Advisory Committee, the American delegation,
or any other delegation.
The Uruguayan delegation desires formally to
state that it will support any measure for con-


trolling the traffic in drugs which requires
serious financial guarantees from persons or firms
engaged in such traffic. The Uruguayan dele-
gation is of opinion that this is one of the most
effective means of suppressing the clandestine
traffic in these drugs, whether of a national or
international character.
Ihe Uruguayan delegation reserves the right
to submit a proposal on this subject and, at the
same time, to suggest the limitations to which
the freedom of transit and the despatch of natio-
nal and international consignments by post
should be subjected.
Uruguay ratified the Convention of 1912 and
has already issued strict regulations regarding
the internal traffic in, and use of, narcotics ;
she now proposes to complete these regulations
by instituting an official monopoly in respect
of all imports, thus enabling the State to dis-
tribute the quantities of opium required by the
persons and institutions entitled thereto.
As Uruguay is a small country, the communi-
cations are excellent. Moreover, it is easy to
carry out frequent inspections, with the help
of a large public health personnel specially
entrusted with the task of supervision, etc.
So far, all the restrictive measures which have-
been adopted have proved effective and they
will be still more so in the future when the mono-
poly system has been established.
Uruguay does not re-export narcotics and if
she were guided by selfish considerations she
might refrain from taking part in this Confe-
rence. But her statesmen and administrators
are influenced by a higher ideal ; the fact that
Uruguay has been able, by her own efforts, to
prevent the development of the abuse of nar-
cotics within the country will not prevent her
from giving her help to other nations which
are called upon to engage in the struggle under
the handicap of less favourable circumstances,
such as the density of the industrial popula-
tion, proximity to centres of production, exten-
sive frontiers difficult to guard, organised smug-
gling on a large scale, etc.
The Uruguayan delegation considers that
lofty considerations of humanity impose upon
it the duty of acting in a spirit of most sincere
co-operation, and it trusts that the efforts of
the forty-three delegates assembled here, repre-
senting as many nations threatened by the drug
evil, will not be without avail.
It is not without the most careful conside-
ration that I use the word ?threatened?, and
I sincerely ask the countries represented here
to consider, in their turn, what would be the
results of a development of the abuse of nar-
cotic drugs, not merely in institutions such as
the army and navy, but in the industrial and
university centres upon which the very life of
a country is based. {Applause.)
The President ;
Translation : The Uruguayan delegate?s
statement will be translated into English and
distributed to the members of the Conference.
It will also be included in the record of the
meeting.
I call upon M. Sugimura, delegate of Japan,
to address the Conference.
M. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : Consumption, manufacture
and production constitute the three essential
factors of the problem of harmful drugs. The
question of trade and distribution is doubtless
very important, but it is, in our opinion, subsi-
diary to the three main questions. The curing
of addicts and other public health problems may
be dealt with under the heading of consumption.
Having made this general observation, I will
venture briefly to define the point of view of
the Japanese delegation.
I. Consumption.
With a view to obtaining a definite result,
we think it advisable and necessary to adopt
the following measures :
i. We must first of all fix the legitimate
needs of each country. This question is the
keystone of the whole edifice which we are
attempting to build. If the Conference does
not succeed in solving this problem by one
means or another, I feel that our efforts will end
in failure.
2. When the legitimate needs of each coun-
try have been fixed, the contracting States
must make every endeavour completely to
eliminate cases of intoxication caused by the
abusive use of dangerous drugs and opium. I
think that we are bound to follow this course
if we really desire to conclude an effective inter-
national agreement and not merely the vain
semblance thereof.
3. From the point of view of the consumer
which is a question of secondary importance
the price of the drugs must be kept as low
as possible, seeing that they are to be used
for a legitimate purpose.
Consuming countries must be assured that
they will be able to find these drugs, which
are so useful for relieving human suffering
and for the development of science, on the
world market without undue difficulty. This
is justified not only for economic reasons but
also primarily, in fact for the sake of hu-
manity and civilisation.
4. We should also make allowance for the
possible occurrence of great epidemics or other
unforeseen and serious eventualities, which
would bring about a sudden increase in the
medical use of narcotics.
11. Manufacture.
As regards general principles, it is not pos-
sible to guarantee exclusive economic privileges
to the countries which at present manufacture
these drugs or to set up in their favour what
would be a veritable monopoly. Nor can we
recognise absolutely the proportional distribution
of manufacture at present existing between the
various countries concerned. Such theoretical
rigidity would be contrary to economic laws
and the principle of that natural and inevitable
evolution of peoples which is a feature of
scientific progress and industrial development.
From a practical point of view, however, it is
urgently necessary to take steps effectively to
reduce the enormous existing world stocks.
The first step a very energetic one must
be to reduce effectively the illicit use of narcotics.
Subsequently, manufacture must be diminished
and existing quantities reduced. After a few
years, we should be in a position fairly to esti-
mate the results obtained and to adopt fresh
measures with all the facts before us. It is


continuity which we desire, first in the progres-
sive elimination of illicit consumers and addicts
an indispensable reform and, subsequently,
in a corresponding reduction in the manufac-
ture of dangerous drugs. By adopting such a
procedure and advancing by natural progres-
sive stages, we feel sure that we can finally
obtain a really satisfactory and beneficial result.
Our long experience in Formosa justifies our
belief in the efficacy of a sure, organic evolu-
tion, inspired by ideals but based on realities.
111. Production.
All that we have said concerning manufacture
applies, in general, to production. We shall,
however, add two observations of secondary
importance ;
i. From the point of view of international
relations, we have only to make provision for
the limitation of production for export purposes.
But as opium for export can also be utilised
for domestic consumption, we should not make
two distinct categories. A far-reaching and
thorough examination of this question is neces-
sary in order to dispel all misunderstanding, and
to guard against any weakness in the structure
we are erecting, which might lead to its collapse.
2. In order to limit the production of opium,
Governments must gradually but entirely sup-
press the pernicious habit of indulging in the
illicit use of opium and other dangerous drugs,
always keeping in view the final aim to be at-
tained. But as circumstances are different in
different countries and communities, we cannot
fix a uniform date for all countries. We should,
however, definitely proclaim that the final
object which we hope to attain is absolute
abolition ; we should not be content merely
with pointing the way to gradual suppression.
We must not lose sight of our ideal.
IV. Trade.
From the economic point of view, narcotics
used for legitimate purposes are primarily a
form of merchandise. For this reason we must,
up to a certain point, recognise the normal
freedom of commerce. Every purchasing coun-
try must maintain intact its right freely to
select the market in which economic conditions
are most advantageous. This may perhaps
lead to practical difficulties. In order to over-
come these difficulties, we must, in the first
place, strengthen the control exercised by Cus-
toms and other authorities. Moreover, with
a view to rendering the international agree-
ment more effective and to giving it active and
visible expression, it would be highly desirable
to set up an international organisation. This
organisation would collect all necessary infor-
mation and would, if necessary, be instructed
to take effective steps to protect the general
interests of humanity and combat the illicit
traffic.
V. International Organisation.
We are in favour of setting up an internatio-
nal organisation which would collect all useful
information and all necessary statistics, which
it would carefully examine. It would, however,
exert, above all, a moral influence, for the prob-
lem of the illicit use of narcotics is primarily
a question for the individual as well as the
public conscience. If a country did not keep
all its engagements, or did not fulfil all its various
obligations arising under the international agree-
ment, the organisation in question would merely
publish the facts, together with its opinion,
if it thought such a course necessary or advi-
sable. This power of publicity would have a
very considerable influence on enlightened public
opinion throughout the world, and public opi-
nion would thus bring a strong moral pressure
to bear on the Governments concerned, but
mutual respect for the legitimate sovereign rights
of the various contracting States continues to be
the solid foundation of our work.
An international organisation possessing the
character of a super-State would run the risk
of seriously compromising good relations be-
tween the nations concerned. We are whole-
heartedly in favour of abolishing the evil of
dangerous drugs, but we are also determined
to uphold the fundamental principle of interna-
tional law and the spirit of the League of Nations,
which is a free association of free nations,
pursuing in common an ideal of justice and mu-
tual good-will. The international organisation,
moreover, will consist of men distinguished not
only for their knowledge and high moral stand-
ing but also for their impartiality, because
they will be independent of their respective
Governments. We should attempt to create
an international institution, permeated with
a true international spirit, a combination of
lofty ideals and far-seeing realism.
The President :
Translation : The procedure adopted in the
case of the other speeches will be followed as
regards M. Sugimura?s speech.
The general discussion is now closed.
The plenary meetings of the Conference will
be adjourned until further notice.

DELEGATION ON SUB-COIVIIVIITTEE F ;
COMMUNICATION BY THE PRESIDENT.
The President :
Translation : In conformity with Rule 7
of the Rules of Procedure, I must make a commu-
nication to you before we discuss the questions
on our agenda.
I have just received a letter from the first
delegate for Poland, M. Chodzko, which reads
as follows :
Translation : ?I have the honour to
inform you that, when necessary, I shall be
replaced at the meetings of Sub-Committee
F by Dr. Stade, expert on the delegation
of Poland and the Free City of Danzig.?
I take note of M. Chodzko?s letter. His
reason for making this communication is that
Sub-Committee F, of which he is a member,
and Sub-Committee E, of which he is the
Chairman, may possibly have to meet at the
same time.
31. CONSTITUTION OF SUB-COIVIIVIITTEE E:
PARTICIPATION OF PORTUGAL.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I desire to bring forward a proposal of which
I have given no previous notice, but which I
hope the Conference will agree to consider and
accept this afternoon.
A desire has been expressed by one of the
delegations at this Conference to be represen-
ted on Sub-Committee E, which deals with
the international control of transport, expor-
tation, importation and so on. The delegation
in question is the delegation from Portugal.
Portugal is represented on the Advisory Com-
mittee of the League, and also took part in the
Hague and previous Conferences. As this desire
has been expressed, and as Portugal has an inte-
rest in this matter, I think it will be the wish
of the Conference generally to accede to that
desire. It would involve raising the number
of the Committee from 15 to 16, which is not
a very large matter. In the special circum-
stances, I hope that the Conference will agree
to do this, and agree to do it now, as the Sub-
Committee in question meets to-morrow morn-
ing for the first time.
Translation : I see no reason why we should
not take a decision forthwith on the proposal
of the first delegate for Great Britain.
In conformity with Rule 11 of our Rules of
Procedure, the Conference may decide by a
unanimous vote to adopt either a draft reso-
lution or a motion proposed at the meeting.
The decision to increase the number of the
members of Sub-Committee E therefore rests
with our plenary Conference.
Does any member of the Conference wish
to speak on this subject ?
We have, in reality, two proposals before iis.
The first is, no doubt, within the competence of
the plenary Conference ; the other is rather a
matter for the Second Committee. But, as the
members of that Committee are assembled
here, I think we can without any difficulty
pronounce upon the two proposals together.
Do you wish to vote formally or to vote by
roll-call on the proposal to offer a seat on Sub-
Committee E to the Portuguese delegation ?
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba) :
Translation : As no one has objected to Sir
Malcolm Delevingne?s proposal, I think that
the President may assume that we are all in
favour of it. Portugal?s collaboration cannot
but be of value to Sub-Committee E.
The President :
Translation : The silence that followed the
remarks of the first delegate for Cuba leads
me to suppose that the Conference is unanimous
in its approval. I therefore have the honour
to declare Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s proposal
adopted.
The proposal was adopted.
IVI. Ferreira (Portugal)
Translation : I have the honour to thank
Sir Malcolm Delevingne for his proposal and
the members of the Conference for accepting
32. CONSUMPTION OF DANGEROUS DRUGS
IN THE UNITED KINGDOM : MEMO-
RANDUM BY THE BRITISH DELEGA-
TION : REFERENCE TO SUB-COM-
MITTEE F.
The President
Translation : I received yesterday from the
first delegate of the British Empire a note accom-
panying a memorandum on the consumption
of dangerous drugs in the United Kingdom.
I have requested the Secretariat to follow
the usual procedure, that is, to translate the
document into French and distribute it to the
members of the Conference.
To avoid the formality of referring it to the
First Committee, I propose that the Conference
should herewith decide to refer this memo-
randum directly to Sub-Committee F. 1 I may
add that this is also the wish of Sir Malcolm
Delevingne.
As no one has any objection, I regard this
proposal as adopted.
The proposal was adopted.

OR REGULATIONS : ( a ) PROHIBITING
THE MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBU-

CONTROL OF THE PRODUCTION AND
DISTRIBUTION OF RAW OPIUM AND
COCA LEAVES : PROPOSALS SUBMIT-
TED BY THE DELEGATION OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA : COM-
MUNICATION BY THE PRESIDENT.
The President
Translation : Ladies and gentlemen The
plenary meeting of to-day was fixed by a deci-
sion of the First Committee on the suggestion
of your President. The reason for the convo-
cation is known to the various delegations,
but I will remind you that we are concerned
with the two proposals of the American delega-
tion which were placed on the agenda of the
First Committee yesterday.
As only forty-eight hours have elapsed since
the decision was taken, the Conference will
remember that it decided to leave to its Busi-
ness Committee the duty of preparing a pro-
gramme of work. Your Business Committee
has applied itself to its task and, after a very
thorough examination, has been able to submit
to you a programme of work. Some of the
questions which concern this Conference are
distributed between the First and Second
Committees, while certain parts of other ques-
tions are held back by the Business Committee.
This programme of work was submitted to
the Conference by the Rapporteur of the Busi-
ness Committee, the distinguished delegate for
Switzerland, and you accepted the programme
and the distribution of work proposed in it.
We have to deal with two proposals which
have been submitted to the Conference by the
United States delegation.
The first proposal is as follows :
"The Contracting Parties shall enact
effective laws or regulations prohibiting the
manufacture and distribution of heroin.
I venture to draw the attention of the mem-
bers of the Conference to the fact that the French
translation does not absolutely correspond to
the official text of the American draft, but the
changes do not alter the sense of the proposal.
The second proposal of the American dele-
gation is as follows :
"The Contracting Parties shall enact
effective laws or regulations for the control
of the production and distribution of raw
opium and coca leaves so that there will
be no surplus available for purposes not
strictly medical or scientific.
"The foregoing provision shall not ope-
rate to prevent the production for expor-
tation, or exportation, of raw opium for the
purpose of making prepared opium, into
those territories where the use of prepared
opium is still temporarily permitted under
Chapter II of this Convention, so long
as such exportation is in conformity with
the provisions of this Convention.?
My remarks as to the translation of the first
proposal apply also to this proposal.
These two proposals will, of course, be dis-
cussed separately. We will begin with the
first.
OR REGULATIONS PROHIBITING THE
MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION
OF HEROIN : PROPOSAL SUBMITTED
BY THE DELEGATION OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
"The Contracting Parties shall enact
effective laws or regulations prohibiting
the manufacture and distribution of heroin".
The President
Translation : Does the first delegate for the
United States desire to explain his delegation?s
point of view concerning this proposal ?
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America)
I have no desire to do so. Any explanation
I may have to offer I should like to make when
I put my motion. If lam permitted to do so
now, perhaps it will meet the views of the Pre-
sident.
The President
Translation : We will now discuss the first
proposal concerning Article 9 a in the American
draft.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America)
The question of competency in regard to
Article 9-A was raised in the Business Committee,
and, so that it may be brought before the Con-
ference in plenary meeting, I have here a motion
suggesting that the matter be referred to the
First Committee for consideration.
With your permission, I will read the motion :
?On behalf of the delegation of the United
States of America, I hereby present for
the consideration of the Conference, Ar-
ticle 9-A of the suggestions of the United
States of America, which reads as follows ;
?The Contracting Parties shall enact-
effective laws or regulations prohibit-
ing the manufacture and distribution
of heroin,?
and move that it be referred to the First
Committee for consideration."
I take it, Mr. President, that that is the proper
way to raise the question of competency, so that
if anyone present desires to raise the point we
are prepared to meet it. If you will note the
motion closely, you will see that it does not ask
the Conference to consider the matter on its
merits at all. It merely asks the Conference to
refer the question to the appropriate Committee.
The President
Translation : I quite agree with the first
delegate for the United States. A few days
ago reservations were made concerning Article
9-A of the American draft. The United States
delegation is now asking the Conference to take
another resolution with regard to this article.
It is desired and it is the simplest course
to refer the examination of this article to the
competent Committee, that is to say, the First
Committee. The United States delegate added
that he did not ask the Conference to discuss
the matter on its merits ; all he wished the
Conference to do was to discuss the question of


referring this proposal to the competent Com-
mittee.
I hope therefore that the Conference will
adopt this view.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) :
Mr. President, as I have already stated, the
motion is so framed that it will raise the ques-
tion of competence ; that is to say, it will give
any delegate here the right to raise that ques-
tion. But if nobody raises it, I hardly see
that there is anything more to say. I am perfectly
willing to discuss the matter, but if nobody raises
a point (and I trust they will not do so at
least, I am quite hopeful that they will not
and I shall be very grateful if they do not), I
do not see any reason for saying anything in
support of the motion.
The President :
Translation : Does any delegation desire
to speak on the question before us ?
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
I do not raise the question of competence ;
but I cannot express any opinion on the ques-
tion of prohibiting the manufacture and distri-
bution of heroin, as my Government did not
consider that this problem was within the scope
of the Conference. I have therefore no instruc-
tions on this matter.
The President
Translation : The declaration made by the
Netherlands delegation will be included in the
record of the present meeting.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
Without going at all into the question of
competence, I only wish to say that I have no
objection to offer to this matter being referred
to the First Committee for discussion.
The President
Translation : There are no other speakers
on my list. The Conference has now to decide
whether Article q-A of the American draft should
be referred to the First Committee.
As the members of the Conference offer no
objection, I take it that the discussion of Article
y-A in the draft of the American delegation
is referred to the First Committee of the Con-
ference.
The proposal was adopted.
The Hon. Henri S. Beland (Canada)
Translation : 1 desire to ask for an expla-
nation. We are now in plenary meeting of
the Conference and we have decided to refer the
proposal of the delegation of the United States
to the First Committee. Does this signify
that the competence of the Conference in regard
to this question is admitted ?
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba) :
Translation: As the American proposal was
submitted to the plenary Conference in order to
determine whether the latter was or was not
competent, and as the delegations here present
raised no objections on the question of this com-
petence, except for the reservations by the
delegations of the Netherlands and British
Empire, I think it must be understood that the
Conference declares its competence with regard
to the proposal submitted by the United States.
The First Committee will have to discuss the
question whether the American proposal is to
be accepted or not, but it has not to discuss
the question of competence.
The President
Translation : The first delegate for Canada
asked me a question, and I would like to give
him in reply my personal opinion.
In referring the American proposal to the
First Committee, the plenary Conference has
decided that the First Committee is competent
to discuss this proposal. This is also the view
of the first delegate for Cuba.
35. ENACTMENT OF EFFECTIVE LAWS OR
REGULATIONS FOR THE CONTROL OF
THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
OF RAW OPIUM AND COCA LEAVES :
PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BYTHE DELE-
GATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
The President
Translation : We now proceed to the exami-
nation of the second proposal of the United
States delegation :
?The Contracting Parties shall enact
effective laws or regulations for the control
of the production and distribution of raw
opium and coca leaves so that there will
be no surplus available for purposes not
strictly medical or scientific.
?The foregoing provision shall not operate
to prevent the production for exportation,
or exportation, of raw opium for the pur-
pose of making prepared opium, into those
territories where the use of prepared opium
is still temporarily permitted under Chap-
ter II of this Convention, so long as such
exportation is in conformity with the
provisions of this Convention.?
I have already drawn the attention of the
Conference to a slight difference in the French
translation of this document. Does the delegation
of the United States wish to speak on its pro-
posal before the general discussion is opened ?
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) :
Mr. President ? I desire to put forward a mo-
tion on this matter similar to the one with regard
to heroin. The motion reads as follows :
?On behalf of the delegation of the Uni-
ted States of America, I hereby present for
consideration by the Conference Article 1
of the suggestions of the United States of
America, which reads as follows ;
?The Contracting Parties shall enact
effective laws or regulations for the
control of the production and distri-
bution of raw opium and coca leaves
so that there will be no surplus avail-
able for purposes not strictly medical
or scientific.
?The foregoing provision shall not
operate to prevent the production for
exportation, or exportation, of raw
opium for the purpose of making pre-
pared opium, into those territories


where the use of prepared opium is still
temporarily permitted under Chapter
II of this Convention, so long as such
exportation is in conformity with the
provisions of this Convention?,
and move that it be referred to the First
Committee for consideration?.
The President :
Translation : A proposal has been sub-
mitted to the Conference by the American dele-
gation to refer Article i of its draft proposals to
the First Committee. This point is now open
for general discussion.
!Vlr. Clayton (India) :
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen ?The mo-
tion just proposed by the delegation of the
United States of America asks that the Confe-
rence should consider a proposal relating to the
control of the production and distribution of
raw opium and coca leaves within a producing
country.
According to the agenda of this Conference
imposed upon it by the convening authorities
and accepted by the Conference, this latter
is empowered to deal with the production of
raw opium and coca leaves for export. It is
not entitled to deal with the control of raw
opium and coca leaves produced for internal
consumption.
It is my duty, therefore, to ask you, Sir, to rule
the present motion out of order and ultra vires of
this Conference. Before I do so, however, I
desire, with your permission, to make a few
remarks in support of my contention.
There is no delegate, I think, present at this
Conference who is not aware that this is a ques-
tion of great importance to the Government
which I represent; moreover, the decision which is
taken upon it may largely decide the part
which the Indian delegation can take both
in the deliberations of this Conference and in its
results.
It is one of several questions which were not
only not included in the agenda of this Confe-
rence, but were, after the fullest possible consi-
deration, deliberately excluded by the conven-
ing authorities namely, the Assembly and
the Council of the League of Nations. The
reason for this deliberate exclusion will be
perfectly obvious to anyone who has studied
the papers which describe the preliminary work
undertaken in connection with the prepara-
tion of our agenda. This reason is that on
these subjects there is no possibility of agree-
ment between the nations represented here,
and the inclusion of these subjects therefore
would necessarily involve the Conference in
failure. Such a failure would, and this I desire
to state in the most emphatic manner, be re-
gretted by no one more deeply than by the
Government of India a Government which,
for generations, and long before the Hague
Convention was even thought of, has stood in
the forefront of the campaign against the abuse
of opium, and has achieved results which chal-
lenge comparison with those obtained by any
other nation.
The subject of the present motion, I repeat,
vitally affects the position of India. The
position of the Government of India on the
opium question is as follows : It holds
that the present system of opium control in
India is legitimate, in the fullest sense of the
word, under the Hague Convention of 1912.
It also holds that this system is the best and
most effective method of putting into force,
under the conditions that prevail in India, the
principles which underlie that Convention.
This position the Government of India is
prepared to discuss and defend aye, and
successfully defend in the future as in the
past, whenever and wherever the correctness
of that position is at issue. It is not prepared
to discuss that position at a Conference where
it is not at issue and from the agenda of which
it has deliberately, and after the fullest conside-
ration, been excluded by the convening autho-
rities.
So much by way of preliminary. I now come
to the technical point of order. This is a point
which you, Sir, will have to decide. We hold
that it is a general rule, universally applied,
that a Conference summoned by the invitation
of a convening authority is strictly bound by
the agenda imposed by that authority. I do
not propose to argue this point at length
it appears to us to be so clear as to require
only to be stated for it to command universal
approbation.
There is a further question also for you, Sir,
as President, to decide, as a point of order.
A Conference is bound by the agenda which
it has itself formally accepted, and I would
note that, in the case of the agenda of this
present Conference, it has been so worded as
definitely to exclude all possibility of argument
either as to the objects or the intentions of our
meeting.
This second point of order is, I think, deserving
of consideration. It is not, however, in our
view, of such importance as the first, and there-
fore we do not lay the same stress upon it ;
but I desire to point out that the rule upon
which it is based is one which has already
behind it the authority of the League in impor-
tant cases. In view, therefore, of the existence
of these precedents in favour of our case, I
venture to think that it should not be lightly
disregarded. Further, the delegation of the
United States itself has, in the course of the
proceedings of this very Conference, adopted,
by implication at any rate, this view.
When you, Sir, put the agenda before the
Conference at the first plenary meeting on No-
vember 17th, Mr. Porter made a reservation.
That reservation referred to the agenda of the
First Conference, which, in the event of that
Conference not coming to a satisfactory agree-
ment, he desired to see added to our own.
If the Second Conference is untrammelled by
its agenda and is at liberty to range over the
whole question of opium, there was no need
for such a reservation and, by making it,
Mr. Porter himself, by implication, agreed that
the agenda, once accepted, binds the Confe-
rence.
I have said that the Indian view had behind
it the authority of League precedents. To me
it is natural that the League should support the
principles which we are urging here, for, I
venture to suggest, the maintenance of those
principles is vital to the continued existence of
the League. The object of the League of Na-
tions is not to magnify the points of difference
between nations, but to concentrate on the
points on which an agreement is in sight, or
may ultimately prove possible, in the hope that


the sphere of agreement may gradually be ex-
tended to cover all international relations.
Nothing is more incompatible with these
objects or more likely to breed distrust and pro-
vide opportunities for disputes between nations
than uncertainty as to the agenda of League
Conferences. I put it to you, Sir, and to the
Conference, that the position of a nation in
the League will become wholly impossible if,
after accepting the invitation to a Conference
to discuss a specific agenda, it is to find itself
confronted at that Conference with other sub-
jects raised without notice subjects which, if it
had had notice of them, might have caused that
country to refuse to attend the Conference
at all. Such action, in many cases which I
leave it to the delegates to imagine, would go
far to bring about the complete break-up of
the League of Nations.
I now pass to the history of this agenda, and
I ask the Conference to note that every stage
of its development is clear, precise and definite.
I must ask the Conference to go back with me
to the meetings of the Advisory Committee
held in May 1923. And if lam asked why so,
I would quote certain words used by Mr. Porter
himself in the course of the discussions.
Mr. Porter said on June 4th, 1923 1 : ?The Ame-
rican delegation was trying to ascertain whether
or not a workable plan could be agreed upon for
combating the traffic in dangerous drugs.? I
lay stress on the two words ?workable? and
?agreed?. This was exactly the business upon
which the Advisory Committee was engaged.
The American delegation and the Advisory
Committee set out upon their work together,
and I hope to show that the plan contained in
our agenda is the plan upon which agreement
was finally reached. It is to be remarked that
the mere affirmation of principles is not a plan.
Absolute? agreement on all matters of principle
was not necessary. What was necessary was
agreement on some practical plan which would
be effective in combating the traffic in dangerous
drugs.
The Advisory Committee met on June 2nd,
1923 2 . It discussed the American principles ;
certain reservations were made, but the prac-
tical plan which the Committee recommended
is to be found in Resolution IV, which proposed
the calling of two Conferences for the conside-
ration of certain specified and limited questions.
The resolution of the Advisory Committee
was discussed with the American delegation
at its eighteenth meeting on June 4th 3 . It
was referred to a Drafting Committee, and
emerged therefrom in a somewhat modified form.
In essence, it remained the same. The Ameri-
can principles were accepted, with the same reser-
vations as had been made in the Committee,
though these were rearranged in a different
order. The practical plan to be recommended
to the Assembly remained exactly the same,
though the wording was slightly altered. That
plan, so far as this Conference is concerned,
consisted in inviting the Governments of the
1 See Minutes of the Fifth Session of the Advisory
Committee on the Traffic in Opium and other Danger-
ous Drugs (page in).
2 See Minutes of the Fifth Session of the Advisory
Committee on the Traffic in Opium and other Danger-
ous Drugs (pages 95-105).
3 See Minutes of the Fifth Session of the Advisory
Commission on the Traffic in Opium and other Dan-
gerous Drugs (page 109).
States in which morphine, heroin, or cocaine
and their respective salts are manufactured,
and the Governments of the States in which raw
opium or the coca leaf are produced for export
for the purposes of such manufacture, to enter
into immediate negotiation to consider whether
an agreement could not be reached on certain
definite points, namely, the specific points which
are mentioned in our agenda.
Such was the plan that the Advisory Com-
mittee recommended to the Assembly. Such was
the plan which the Fifth Committee of that
Assembly approved, though it recommended
the enlargement of the Conference, not for the
purpose of altering the plan, but in order to
secure the adhesion of all Members of the League
or signatories to the Convention of I9 I2 > to
the principles that might be embodied in any
agreement reached.
The plan, together with the proposal for the
enlargement of the Conference, but with the
same agenda, was accepted by the Assembly,
and distributed to all Governments when the
invitations were issued. No objections or cri-
ticisms on the part of any of the Governments
have been made public and we are entitled to
assume that none were in fact made. The
plan is again embodied in the agenda which was
placed before the Conference by the League and
accepted by it.
The plan has thus been before most of the
States here represented some three or four times,
and on no occasion has any objection to it been
raised.
If the Conference has followed me thus far,
the reasons for the form of the agenda will be
obvious :
(a) The agenda was, in fact, designed to
take note of all the reservations made. It
does so !
( b ) It had to limit the field of discussion to
subjects on which agreement was possible,
otherwise the projected Conference would be
likely to fail. It does so !
(c) It had to give the Governments of the
nations, to which invitations were issued and
which are represented here, a definite limited pro-
gramme on which to base their instructions to
their plenipotentiaries. It does so ! The pleni-
potentiaries are assembled here and have
received their instructions. It follows, there-
fore, that the agenda offers a complete and satis-
factory basis on which the Conference can build
?an agreed and workable plan? for controlling
the traffic in dangerous drugs.
The only argument against the view put for-
ward by my delegation, that has been urged in this
Conference, is based on the reference in the sixth
resolution of the Assembly, dated September
27th. 1923, to the principles submitted by the
representatives of the United States of America.
The answer to this argument is to be found
in the history of the agenda, details of which
I have given, and in the series of resolutions
which the Assembly adopted.
Resolution I adopted by the fourth Assembly
is so precise as to allow of no possibility of
doubt or dispute. It ?adopts the report and
resolutions of the Advisory Committee, taking
note of the reservations contained therein, and
asks the Council to take the necessary steps
to put these resolutions into effect .In the
resolution of the Advisory Committee the refe-


rence to the American principles comes at the
beginning and has no relation with the defi-
nite agenda proposed.
Resolution VI, adopted by the fourth Assem-
bly, on which stress is laid, is fully covered by
Resolution I. Resolution VI is obviously a
redraft (and, with all due respect to the League
Secretariat, an unsatisfactory and inaccurate
redraft) of Resolution IV pf the Advisory
Committee. It omits, for instance, the impor-
tant reference to the Hague Convention of
1912 a reference which has rightly been res-
tored in the agenda as formally adopted by
this Conference. Further, this reference to the
United States principles, it should be noted,
is not confined to these principles. It also
places equal stress on the policy which the
League, on the recommendation of the Advi-
sory Committee, has adopted ; and as to the
recommendation made by the Advisory Com-
mittee there can, as I have shown, be no possible
doubt whatever.
Surely this argument is altogether too weak
and insubstantial for it to be possible to justify
by it the course proposed namely, the com-
plete scrapping of all the preliminary work
undertaken in 1923 and thereaiter ; the rejec-
tion of the agreed and workable plan accepted
by the Advisory Committee, the Fifth Committee
of the fourth Assembly and by the Assembly
itself ; and the replacing of the whole posi-
tion as it was before the Advisory Committee
started work in May 1923. If this was the in-
tention of the Assembly, one is left to wonder
why any preliminary work was ever undertaken
at all.
The point of order which has been raised must,
for the purpose of this Conference, be decided
by you, Sir, our President. You derive your
authority from the League of Nations, which
convened our Conference, and you, therefore,
alone among us, are in a position to decide the
subjects which that authority desired us to
discuss.
But if the case be put, Mr. President, for your
decision, it must necessarily be a decision be-
tween conflicting views. India, however, would
prefer another and better way of obtaining a
decision, namely, that, if possible, the question
should be settled by agreement, without the
intervention of the President.
The proposition now moved is not the only
one on which the same point of order can be
raised. There are others. But as things now
stand, the principal, and possibly the only, pro-
positions before the Conference which are out-
side the accepted agenda are to be found in the
American suggestions. I therefore now, on
behalf of the Indian delegation, and the Govern-
ment which it represents, make a solemn appeal
to the delegation of the United States of Ame-
rica, in the name of the great principles which
underlie the Covenant of the League of Nations
in the name of the spirit of brotherhood,
friendliness and faith in human nature, to
which Bishop Brent has already so eloquently
appealed before this Conference in the name
of our common cause, our common desire to
find an agreed and workable scheme for com-
bating the traffic in dangerous drugs, our com-
mon hope for a successful issue to the work
of this Conference I appeal to the delegation
of the United States to accept the view I have
put forward, that this Conference is only com-
petent to discuss and deal with its accepted
agenda, that is to say, the agreed and workable
plan which earned its assent last year.
If that appeal is accepted as I hope it
will be in the spirit in which it is made, our
difficulties will disappear, and we can at once settle
down, with every hope that a final agreement
will be reached, to the discussion of the proposals
of the Advisory Committee, the amendments
to be suggested to them, and such other pro-
posals as may be in order.
There may be difficulties in the way ;
the speech of the French delegate the other day
indicated, indeed, that those difficulties may
be considerable but I share with him the
view that there is no reason to suppose that
a common basis of agreement cannot be found.
If, however, this appeal now made by my dele-
gation is rejected, if it is made clear that the
object in view is not to reach an agreed and
workable plan, but to push the views held by
a portion of the Conference to such lengths as to
destroy all chance of an agreement being reached,
it will be necessary in order that India?s
position in the matter may be made perfectly
clear, more clear than I have been able to make
it in this speech for our delegation to make
a further statement.
The President
Translation : Does anyone wish to speak ?
I call upon the Hon. Stephen G. Porter, dele-
gate of the United .States of America, to address
the Conference.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) :
There is nothing peculiarly sacred about an
agenda. It has but one function to perform,
that is, to furnish a means of giving force and
effect to matters stated in the convocation.
The agenda for this Conference and the convo-
cation of this Conference are contemporaneous
documents. They must be read together. It
would have been quite easy for someone to have
moved, on the day when we first met, the
substitution of Resolution VI for the agenda
as prepared by the League of Nations. I confess
frankly that I did not give the matter a second
thought, because I recognised the principle that
the agenda is merely to give force and effect to the
call. I might also say, in passing, that this is my
third visit to Geneva, and my contact with
the Secretariat has been such as to inspire un-
limited confidence in their ability and in their
accuracy. When this agenda is presented to
me as the work of the Secretariat of the League
of Nations, I assume that it has carried out the
invitation which the League has issued.
It may not be out of place to give a short
history of this matter, because, if I have not
already said so, I have at least had it in my mind
to say, that the delegates from the United States
are firmly convinced that, if this Conference
becomes involved in a maze of sharp technica-
lities, the result will be disappointment to all.
It is only by meeting this situation upon a
broad ground, by meeting it upon its merits,
that we can hope to bring relief to the nr 1 lions
of people throughout this world that are suffer-
ing from the effects of these ghastly drugs.
ihe International Opium Convention con-
cluded at The Hague on January 23rd, 1912,
and which forms the basis of the present
international control of the traffic in opium,
coca leaves, and their narcotic derivatives, dele-


gated certain administrative functions to the
Netherlands Government, and that Govern-
ment in 1913 and 1914 called two Internationa]
Conferences to consider problems arising out
of the execution of that Convention. It is
perhaps accurate to state that, prior to the estab-
lishment of the League of Nations, the Nether-
lands Government was generally recognised by
the signatory Powers as the agent for the
execution of a number of the provisions of that
Convention.
Subsequently, however, certain Powers signa-
tory to the Convention of 1912, through their
acceptance of the Covenant of the League of
Nations, agreed, in accordance with Article 23
of that instrument, as follows :
?Subject to, and in accordance with, the
provisions of International Conventions
existing or hereafter to be agreed upon, the
Members of the League
(c) will entrust the League with the
general supervision over the execution of
agreements with regard to the traffic in
women and children, and the traffic in
opium and other dangerous drugs.?
The League has since assumed, with respect
to its Members, the duties entrusted to the
Netherlands Government by the International
Opium Convention of 1912. It is unnecessary
to mention that the United States is not a
Member of the League of Nations, and there-
fore looks to the Netherlands Government for
the discharge of the administrative functions
entrusted to that Government by the Conven-
tion of 1912.
In 1922, however, the League of Nations in-
vited the Government of the United States to
participate in the work of the Advisory Com-
mittee on the Traffic in Opium, which had been
established by the League to carry out the
obligations undertaken under Article 23 of
the Covenant. The United States, being of
the opinion that the world-wide traffic in habit-
forming narcotic drugs could only be suppressed
by international co-operation, and recognis-
ing that it was bound by the Hague Conven-
tion to work towards this end, accepted the
invitation, and in May 1923 designated three
representatives to appear, in a consultative capa-
city, before the Advisory Committee with in-
structions to present for consideration certain
proposals which embodied the views of the
United States Government with regard to the
obligations undertaken under the Convention
of 1912 and the means by which the purpose of
the Convention might be achieved.
In accordance with the instructions received,
the representatives of the United States presen-
ted for the consideration of the Advisory Com-
mittee the two following proposals ;
?1. If the purpose of the Hague Opium
Convention is to be achieved according to
its spirit and true intent, it must be recog-
nised that the use of opium products for
other than medicinal and scientific pur-
poses is an abuse and not legitimate.
?2. In order to prevent the abuse of
these drugs, it is necessary to exercise the
control of the production of raw opium in
such a manner that there will be no sur-
plus available for non-medicinal and non-
scientific purposes.?
After considerable discussion, the Opium Advi-
sory Committee adopted a resolution accepting
and recommending to the League of Nations the
proposals of the representatives of the United
States. It considered that the resolution em-
bodied the general principles by which the Govern-
ments should be guided in dealing with the
question of the abuse of dangerous drugs, and
on which, in fact, the International Convention
of 1912 is based, subject, however, to the fact
that the following reservation was made by
the representatives of the Governments of
France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Siam :
?The use of prepared opium and the
production, export and import of raw opium
for that purpose are legitimate so long as
that use is subject to and in accordance
with the provisions of Chapter II of the
Convention.?
The representatives of the United States Go-
vernment, in September 1923, appeared before the
Fifth Committee of the fourth Assembly of the
League, which had been convened for the pur-
pose of considering the recommendations of the
Advisory Committee to which I have referred.
On September 26th, 1923, the Fifth Committee
of the Assembly adopted (among other things)
the following resolutions :
?Resolution V. The Assembly approves
the proposal of the Advisory Committee
that the Governments concerned should
be invited immediately to enter into nego-
tiations with a view to the conclusion of
an agreement as to the measures for giving
effective application in the Far Eastern
territories to Part II of the Convention
and as to a reduction of the amount of
raw opium to be imported for the purpose
of smoking in those territories where it is
temporarily continued, and as to the mea-
sures which should be taken by the Govern-
ment of the Republic of China to bring
about the suppression of the illegal produc-
tion and use of opium in China, and requests
the Council to invite those Governments to
send representatives with plenipotentiary
powers to a Conference for the purpose and
to report to the Council at the earliest
possible date.?
I take it that Resolution VI may be regarded
as in effect the agenda for this Conference.
It reads as follows :
?Resolution VI. The Assembly, having
noted with satisfaction that, in accordance
with the hope expressed in the fourth
resolution adopted by the Assembly in
1922, the Advisory Committee has re-
ported that the information now available
makes it possible for the Governments con-
cerned to examine, with a view to the
conclusion of an agreement, the question
of the limitation of the amounts of mor-
phine, heroin or cocaine and their respec-
tive salts to be manufactured ; of the limi-
tation of the amounts of raw opium and the
coca leaf to be imported for that purpose
and for other medicinal and scientific pur-
poses ; and of the limitation of the pro-
duction of raw opium and the coca leaf
for export to the amount required for such
medicinal and scientific purposes, requests


the Council, as a means of giving effect to
the principles submitted by the represen-
tatives of the United States of America,
and to the policy which the League, on
the recommendation of the Advisory Com-
mittee, has adopted, to invite the Govern-
ments concerned to send representatives
with plenipotentiary powers to a Confe-
rence for this purpose, to be held, if pos-
sible, immediately after the Conference
mentioned in Resolution V.
?The Assembly also suggests, for the
consideration of the Council, the advisa-
bility of enlarging this Conference so as
to include within its scope all countries
which are Members of the League, or
Parties to the Convention of iqi2, with a
view to securing their adhesion to the prin-
ciples that may be embodied in any agree-
ment reached.?
May I digress a moment and suggest here
that, if the contention of the distinguished
gentleman from India is correct, and we are
absolutely bound by the words of this agenda,
the United States, not being a Member of the
League, would be in the position of working
here as an uninvited guest.
The Council of the League, in accordance
with the resolutions to which I have referred,
invited the various Governments concerned
to send representatives with full plenipoten-
tiary powers to attend at Geneva the two
International Conferences provided for by the
resolutions in question. The Government of
the United States did not receive an invita-
tion to attend the Conference called in
pursuance of Resolution V, and it was there-
fore not represented at that Conference. In
accepting the invitation extended by the Coun-
cil of the League to participate in the Confe-
rence called in pursuance of Resolution VI,
the United States did so with the knowledge
that its proposals respecting the use of opium
were embodied in the two proposals brought
to the attention of the Advisory Committee in
May 1923 and had received the approval of
the Advisory Committee, the Fifth Committee
of the fourth Assembly, the Assembly itself
and the Council of the League of Nations, and
with the intention to present for consideration
certain measures designed to give concrete
expression to the proposals which the League
had accepted as being in accordance with its
policy.
The United States did not feel that it had
completely discharged its responsibilities or
fulfilled its obligations in merely presenting
two proposals for adoption, but considered that
the various Governments concerned had the
right to ask that the United States should
submit for their consideration concrete measures
which would give practical effect to the general
proposals previously accepted. It was only
on this understanding, which is clearly war-
ranted under the circumstances related, that the
United States agreed to participate in the pre-
sent Conference.
While Resolution VI specifically mentions
that the Governments concerned may examine,
with the view to a conclusion of an agreement :
{a) The question of the limitation of
the amounts of morphine, heroin, or co-
caine, and their respective salts, to be
maunfactured ;
{b) The limitation of the amounts of
raw opium and the coca leaf to be imported
for that purpose and for other medicinal
and scientific purposes ;
(c) The limitation of the production of
raw opium and the coca leaf for export to
the amount required for such medicinal
and scientific purposes,
it will be noted that these questions are to be
considered as a means of giving effect to the
principles submitted by the representatives
of the United States and to the policy which
the League, on the recommendation of the
Advisory Committee, has adopted.
Is any argument necessary to establish that
the questions referred to in Resolution VI are
merely mentioned by way of description and
not of limitation, or, as the President of the Con-
ference pointed out in his opening address
with regard to the adoption of the agenda, as
merely a starting point or basis for discussion ?
The suggestion that a Conference composed of
representatives with full plenipotentiary powers,
called to consider measures to be adopted as
a means of giving effect to the United States
proposals, does not possess the power to examine
any question presented germane to the general
subject under discussion appears to be unten-
able. Every Government here represented
was aware of the purpose for which the Confe-
rence was called and it is to be presumed that
each representative received instructions co-
extensive with the terms of the invitation re-
ceived and accepted.
I may add that the United States, in the sug-
gestions which are before you for consideration,
has not endeavoured to broaden the scope of
the Conference as set forth in the invitation
received from the League of Nations. Every
proposal or suggestion embodied in the pro-
gramme which has been placed at your disposal
is, in our judgment, within the competence of
the Conference.
Article 1 of the suggestions of the United
States, the one in question, proposes that the
Contracting Parties shall enact effective laws
or regulations for the control of the production
and distribution of raw opium and coca leaves
so that there will be no surplus available for
purposes not strictly medical or scientific. This
suggestion merely embodies in the Convention
a principle which has already been accepted by
the League. Recognising, however, the force
of the reservation made by certain countries
with regard to the use of prepared opium under
Chapter II of the Convention, we have inserted
in Article 1 that the foregoing provision shall
not operate to prevent the production for expor-
tation, or the exportation of raw opium for the
purpose of making prepared opium, into those
territories where the use of prepared opium is
still temporarily permitted under Chapter II of
the Convention, so long as such exportation
is in conformity with the provisions of the
Convention. Article 1, therefore, which merely
gives expression to the American proposals,
subject to the reservations made by certain
countries, is clearly within the scope of the
discussion of the present Conference.
I desire to make it perfectly clear that the
Conference is not at this time deciding whether
it shall adopt Article 1 of the suggestions of
the United States, but merely whether, under the
terms of Resolution VI of the Assembly


and the agenda of the Conference, the United
States may properly present for consideration
by the Conference the proposal contained in
Article 1 of the suggestions of the United States,
supported by such arguments and facts as the
United States may consider germane to the
proposal.
In case of the acceptance of the proposal,
ample protection is to be found in the right which
each Government has to file reservations to
any measure with which it is not in accord.
Should the Conference, after examination of
the subject under discussion, finally decide to
place within the Convention provisions on the
lines of Article 1 of the suggestions of the
United States, any Government represented here
which cannot give its approval to proposals
of the character indicated may appropriately,
and without question, make such reservations
thereto as may in its judgment be deemed
advisable.
The distinguished gentleman from India
appeals to the delegation of the United States,
in the name of all that is sacred, to recede
from its position, the position which my Govern-
ment has maintained throughout. For my
part, I would also make an appeal and ask
him to recede from the position he has taken
up and agree with us that these drugs, these
soul-destroying drugs, shall be limited, that their
production shall be limited, to the quantities
needed for medicinal purposes. If we can
bring that about, we shall bring sunshine and
happiness into millions of homes in this
world where misery and squalor exist to-day.
(Applause.)
IVIr. Campbell (India)
Mr. President I regret that I do not find in
Mr. Porter?s speech any reply to the closely
reasoned arguments which my colleague pre-
sented. I regret also that Mr. Porter did not
see fit to respond to the appeal which Mr.
Clayton made.
This matter is not, for India, a question of
sharp technicalities. It is a question of fun-
damental importance, and I think and believe
that the other delegations here present, when
they reflect on the piinciple which is at stake,
will share that view.
I do not propose to reply in detail to the
various points raised by Mr. Porter I think it
is perhaps unnecessary. Mr. Porter?s speech
appears to have been prepared before M.
Clayton?s speech was read, and for that reason,
perhaps, he did not deal with the points which
the Indian delegation presented.
However that may be, there is one point in
Mr. Porter?s remarks to which I should like to
direct special attention. He mentioned the
reservations made by various Governments ;
he did not mention the reservation made by
the Government of India. In this matter, the
question of Article 1, the only reservation which
is relevant, is the reservation made by the Go-
vernment of India. That reservation occurs
in a resolution of the Opium Advisory Com-
mittee, which resolution is, according to the
Assembly resolution, the basis of our agenda.
The reason why the reservation was separated
from the other reservations I will shortly ex-
plain to you.
There is one other point, of what I think is
fundamental importance, to which I should like
to allude. It has been customary here to talk
of the American principles. I should like to
point out and I wish to emphasise the point as
much as possible that these are not prin-
ciples. They are an interpretation of the Hague
Convention put forward by the Government of
the United States. If the members of the Con-
ference will refer to the Minutes of the Fifth
Session of the Advisory Opium Committee, they
will find on page 14, which contains the statement
made by Mr. Porter, the following remarks :
?The United States has no wish to enter
into a discussion of the powers and duties
of this Committee, but feels that it is due
to itself and to the Governments here
assembled to state clearly what it under-
stands the Hague Convention to mean.?
These are the words I wish to emphasise
?To state clearly what it understands the Hague
Convention to mean?.
On page 15, also in Mr. Porter?s speech, you
will find the following statement :
"As a concrete expression of these prin-
ciples so far as concerns opium and its
derivatives, the following propositions are
submitted to the Opium Advisory Com-
mittee?
these are the proposals which are embodied
in the preamble to the American suggestions
?in the earnest hope that they will be agreed
to and their adoption recommended to the
Council and Assembly of the League of
Nations?
and again I wish to emphasise the words which
follow ;
?in order that the doubts, if any, which
now exist as to the true intent and meaning
of the Hague Opium Convention shall be
permanently removed.?
Then follow the two principles in exactly the
same wording as they now appear in the Ame-
rican scheme.
It follows that the so-called American prin-
ciples are not principles. They are, as directly
stated by Mr. Porter, the official interpretation
by the United .States Government of the mean-
ing of an existing International Convention.
Now, in an assembly of this kind, I do not sup-
pose it is necessary for me to state that the
United States Government has clearly no right
whatever to attempt to impose its interpretation
of the Hague Convention upon other Govern,
ments. This is what would be done if we ac-
cept the American scheme in its present form-
with the preamble. If we accept that scheme,
the effect would be to give to the American
interpretation of the Hague Convention re-
trospective effect for twelve years.
The Advisory Committee has no power to
interpret the Hague Convention. This Con-
ference has no power to interpret the Hague
Convention. The League of Nations has no
power to interpret the Hague Convention.
There are only two means by which the Hague
Convention, if doubts exist on the subject, can
be interpreted. One is a reference to the Per-
manent Court of International Justice ; the
other is to adopt the machinery which the
Hague Convention itself sets up for that pur-
pose. The reference will be found in Article
24 of the Convention.


I should like to inform the Conference that,
when this question arose, I put both these sug-
gestions to Mr. Porter. They will be found
in the Minutes of the Advisory Committee.
So far as my Government was concerned, I
said that I had no specific instructions but I
was willing to make a proposal. I suggested
that the question should be referred to the
Permanent Court of International Justice.
That suggestion was not accepted.
I then suggested that the question should be
dealt with under Article 24 of the Hague
Convention. That suggestion was not ac-
cepted. I wish all the members of the Conference
thoroughly to understand what the acceptance
of the American scheme in its present form
means . It means that this Conference will
commit itself to accept, with retrospective effect,
the interpretation which a particular Govern-
ment places upon an International Convention,
now signed by fifty-two countries.
There is yet another point to which I wish
to refer. A special position exists in respect
of this matter as between the Indian and the
American delegations.
I do not desire to enter into details, but I
trust that the Conference will accept my word
when I say that the Indian delegation has
made every effort to avoid, and has most
carefully considered every possible means of
avoiding, the necessity of making a statement
such as that I am about to make.
If the members of the Conference will refer
to page 104 of the Minutes of the Fifth Session
of the Advisory Committee on the Traffic in
Opium, they will find the definitive text of
the resolution as unanimously adopted by that
Committee. In paragraph 1 of this resolution
the Committee accepted the principles stated
by the American delegation, subject to the
fact that certain stated reservations had been
made by States represented on the Com-
mittee. All these reservations were made on
exactly the same basis.
This resolution was sent to the American
delegation, which replied officially, forwarding-
certain observations regarding it. In the note
from the American delegation dealing with
these reservations the following passages occur :
?In regard to Reservation 1 [which
was the reservation made by India and
which, as I have explained, is the only
reservation relevant to the present ques-
tion] it may be stated that the internal
affairs of other nations are their own con-
cern, and there is no desire to indicate
what particular measures should be adop-
ted in any country to deal with the opium
traffic. It is none the less certain, how-
ever, that it would be most unwise, and
would, moreover, open the door to a demand
for international approval of many unde-
sirable practices, to admit that the domes-
tic usages of any particular States are legi-
timate under the Convention. It amounts
to a demand for special privilege, which
would not seem to be in accord with the
usually accepted usages of international
relations. The British, Indian and German
representatives, however, appear to believe
that the acceptance of the propositions
without this reservation would involve the
alteration of a practice which they consider
legal.?
I now come to a further extract from the same
document
"It would seem quite undesirable to
pass upon the legitimacy of the production
of raw opium for use according to the estab-
lished usages in India. The statement
made in regard to Reservation i seems to
cover this point.?
That is the statement which I have just read.
The American letter went on further :
?Neither you nor we desire to dissemble
in this matter. It would not mark pro-
gress to accept the proposals of the United
States representatives with such reserva-
tions as would destroy their intent.?
On receipt of this letter, the question was
re-discussed by the Advisory Committee, with
the American delegation, and it was found
impossible to arrive at an agreement. The
matter was then referred to a small Drafting
Committee, constituted as follows : Mr. Porter
(United States), Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British
Empire), M. van Wettum (Netherlands), M.
Brenier (Assessor), M. Bourgois (France), Mr.
Neville (United States) and myself.
The meeting of the Drafting Committee
was very short ; it was not open to the public.
In stating what occurred, I desire to remind
the members of the Conference that I am speak-
ing in the presence of five of the gentlemen
who were present on that occasion. There
are others here also who were present at the
meeting, and I may add that I have also
referred to a formal report written by me to
my Government very soon after the meeting
was held.
Mr. Porter was informed by me that no
agreement could be reached and that India
absolutely refused to enter into any negotia-
tions whatsoever except upon two conditions
first, that his official letter containing the
passages which I have read above, chal-
lenging India?s position, must be unreservedly
withdrawn ; the second condition was that the
reservation made by India must not be chal-
lenged or adversely commented on in any way.
Mr. Porter refused to accept these conditions,
and the meeting broke up at approximately
1.30 p.m.
After lunch at about 3 o?clock I was
informed that the Committee had reassembled
and that my presence was desired. On my
arrival in the Committee-room the American
delegation agreed to withdraw its official
letter challenging India?s position and agreed
also that the reservation by the Government of
India should pass without comment or chal-
lenge. The official letter of the American dele-
gation challenging the Government of India?s
position was, in fact, withdrawn at once ; and
the resolution unanimously adopted by the
Advisory Committee (which members will find
on page 118 of the Minutes of the fifth session
of the Committee to which I have already refer-
red) contains no comment or challenge of the
Indian reservation. On the contrary, on page
119 will be found a statement by Bishop Brent
where he stated that; ?Another step forward had
been taken, and he thought that the degree of
unanimity which had been attained in the Com-
mittee marked perhaps the greatest progress
which had been made since the question had first


become an international responsibility.? Both
India?s conditions were accepted and both
were complied with there and then.
That resolution established in the way I
have described forms, under paragraph 1 of
the Assembly resolution of September 27th, 1923,
the basis of this Conference. The Assembly,
as you will observe, adopted the report and reso-
lutions of the Advisory Committee, took note
of the reservations contained therein and
asked the Council to take the necessary steps
to put these resolutions into effect.
There is still a further point to which I must
refer before the story is complete : the American
delegation appeared before the Fifth Committee
of the Assembly of 1923. When the reso-
lution to which I have just referred was adop-
ted, Mr. Porter approached Lord Hardinge (the
chief delegate for India) with a typewritten
document. This document, which was only
in Lord Hardinge?s hands and mine for a matter
of a few minutes and of which we did not at
any time receive a copy contained a state-
ment, or a resolution, or a motion, which Mr.
Porter proposed to make in the Fifth Committee.
He asked Lord Hardinge if he had any objec-
tion. Lord Hardinge decided that, if Mr. Porter
took the action which he said he intended to
take, it would again raise the question which
had been decided before the Advisory Committee
in May 1923 ; it would again challenge India?s
position in that matter ; and it would be con-
trary to the understanding reached between
the American and Indian delegations at the
session of the Advisory Committee. Lord Har-
dinge informed Mr. Porter verbally to this
effect.
Mr. Porter took no action in the direction he
had at first indicated, but he explained the posi-
tion of his Government with reference to the
reservation made by the Government of India.
That, I would again remind you, is the reser-
vation now directly and immediately in ques-
tion. Mr. Porter?s words were : ?He did not
desire to discuss questions of purely domestic
legislation in connection with the use of opium.?
He went on to state that his Government did
not regard as legitimate, and now I quote his
exact words again, ?any international traffic
in opium for other than medical and scientific
purposes, except under the conditions explicitly
laid down in the Hague Convention?.
This statement, as you will observe, in no way
challenges the attitude which India has consis-
tently assumed in respect of this matter. It
in no way challenges the reservation which the
Government of India made ; it is, in fact,
entirely in conformity with the position which
the Government of India has always adopted
and, as such, no reply was made by Lord
Hardinge.
You have now before you the facts regarding
this matter. To my mind, the position is
perfectly clear. Mr. Porter withdrew at once
the official letter challenging the Government
of India?s position, in circumstances which I
have already explained. Mr. Porter allowed
the Government of India?s reservation to pass
without challenge or comment. When an
attempt was made to reopen the question
again at the fifth Assembly, that attempt was
abandoned on India pointing out that such
action was opposed to the agreement already
reached. As a consequence, the reservation
of the Government of India was noted by the
Assembly, and,, in accordance with the recom-
mendation of the Advisory Committee, the
agenda of this Conference was so worded as
definitely to prevent the established usage in
India being discussed in the course of its delibe-
rations.
To my mind, the reservation made by the
Government of India cannot now, in view of
these circumstances, be challenged by the Ame-
rican delegation. The question cannot again be
reopened before this Conference and we can-
not be thrown back to the position in which we
stood at the beginning of May 1923, before the
American delegation did in fact accept and
comply with India?s conditions. That, how-
ever, is the effect of the preamble of the Ameri-
can proposals, read with Article 1 of the
draft.
India entered this Conference on the basis
of the agreement reached by the Advisory
Committee and re-affirmed at the Fifth Com-
mittee of the Assembly of 1923. In his speech
at the Assembly relative to this question, His
Highness the Maharajah Jam Saheb of Nawa-
nagar again made the position clear beyond all
doubt. He said and this, I may remind you,
was at the Assembly, when the resolutions to
which reference has so often been made were
adopted : ?India cannot regard as illegitimate
the use of opium as a home-made medicine
which is general throughout India. India will
not allow the deleterious use of opium within
its territory, so far as stringent laws and effi-
cient administration can prevent it.?
Mr. Hasan Imam (one of the Indian delegates
to the Assembly) also made it clear that this
reservation was a vital matter for India?s
honour. He pointed out that ;
?Neither in the spirit nor in the letter
of our obligations can we be accused of
having departed, even by a hair?s breadth,
from our international engagements
We have more than fulfilled our internatio-
nal obligations The high dictates of
a principle, the commands of morals, and,
above all, our religious belief in doing
good to all, prevailed with us against our
interests ; and, without any dictation from
anyone, we complied with the Convention,
fulfilled the obligations in their entirety,
and with integrity we carried out the pro-
mise that we made to the world.?
There is a further point of importance. I
desire to state that the Indian delegates have
no instructions on any subject outside the pro-
gramme of the Conference as accepted formally
by the Conference itself, as stated in the reso-
lution of the Advisory Committee and as ac-
cepted by the Council and the Assembly. They
will not discuss any proposals which are out-
side that programme. They will sign no Con-
vention containing provisions which do not
fall within that programme, and, should it be
decided that the Conference is not limited by
its imposed and accepted agenda, the Indian
delegation considers that it will be extremely
difficult, and may be impossible, for it to con-
tinue to attend the Conference.
The President
Translation : I call upon the Right Rev.
C. H. Brent, delegate of the United States of
America, to address the Conference.


The Right Rev. C. H. Brent (United States of bilities on all signatories alike, except when
America)
The question of honour, national and per-
sonal, has been raised. The distinguished dele-
gate of India has recounted certain events and
put his own construction upon them, a construc-
tion which the American delegation can in no
wise accept. He has appealed to documents ;
to documents he shall go. We take our stand
on the records of the League of Nations, which
are available to all.
I regret extremely that it seemed necessary
to Mr. Campbell to raise the question of honour.
We attribute no evil motives or conscious unfair-
ness to him. It is a matter of interpretation.
We consider he is honest in the meaning he has
attached to our conversations, just as we, on
the other hand, are honest in our interpretation,
which is radically different.
Until a few nights ago, I did not understand
his contention, nor am I sure that I clearly
understand it now. This may be due to con-
genital stupidity, or it may be because of a lack
of legal subtlety, but it is not due to a lack of
honesty, straightforwardness or truthfulness.
My understanding of a reservation is that it
is an expedient by means of which one who
cannot accept an entire document can associate
himself with the terms of the document in
every respect except those covered by the reser-
vation. It is a concession to the dissident by
those who accept the document in its entirety.
The distinguished delegate for India agrees
thus far, but, as I understand him, he says he
made the reservation on the basis of a compact.
That there are no written documents giving any
agreement officially does not concern me. I
believe in a gentleman?s agreement. My word
is as good as my bond, so is that of my country,
so that the fact that no written compact exists
is not one that I would press. Had a document
bearing the clear, unequivocal proposal of the
distinguished delegate for India been presented
to me for my signature, I would immediately
have refused to sign it. Had our delegation
signed such a proposal and reported to our
Government, it would have been immediately
repudiated by the Government. Had we consi-
dered that we had made any such compact,
either verbally or in writing, we should have
so reported formally to our Government.
As I say, I do not yet quite understand the
proposal of the distinguished delegate for
India. He says we may not challenge his posi-
tion. If his contention is that we may not
officially attack the domestic habits of India
(however much we may condemn them pri-
vately, or on scientific grounds), I agree. If his
contention is that we may not single out India
for an attack because of its domestic use of
opium, I agree. If his contention is that, in
dealing with general questions, I may not pro-
ceed, because there is a danger or a necessity
of involving India, I do not hesitate to say that
his position is unreasonable, unfair and unten-
able.
I have no desire to interfere with India?s
purely internal opium practice, even if I had the
right or the ability. I possess neither of these.
Science can and will effectively deal with it.
I would go out of my way to take a course that
would exclude India?s domestic business from
my purview, but if, in carrying out, or in the
honest attempt to carry out, the provisions of
the Hague Convention, which lay responsi-
otherwise specified, I have indirectly to touch
India, either as a producing country or as one
of the group, I shall not hesitate.
India?s exception is not sacrosanct and to be
considered separately from all reservations. It
is a reservation, and must be treated on the
plane of reservations. The claim that it is so
exceptional that it stands by itself, or in a class
by itself, will not hold water. Unless the excep-
tion were to overflow its banks and directly
threaten other nations, I would keep silent. I
would keep silence now if the distinguished dele-
gate for India had not forced me to speak. His
exception may or may not get in the way
of general discussion as part of a general ques-
tion affecting other countries. But if, in such
a discussion on a general question, India hap-
pens to be in the way, that is her concern and
not mine. She can at once retreat behind hei
reservation.
At this Conference we have an opportunity,
under the decision of the Assembly, as we view
it, of considering on its merits everything that
is within the scope of the American principles
and the Hague Convention, and it is our duty,
as I view it, to encourage, not to impede, open
and frank discussion. The privilege of reser-
vation is inherent in the rights of a nation when
conclusions are reached.
The delegation of the United States has in
good faith offered a complete document in such
terms as may present an advanced effort to
be true to our purpose and agreement. We
admit that it is an advanced effort; we intended
it to be so. I am happy to think that many
of its provisions will meet with unanimous appro-
val, but it is such an agreement as eventually
must be accepted in toto by the nations of the
world if our work is to bear full fruit.
We do not wish to impose our will on others
in the matters which are challenged. If they
have something equally good or better, we will
welcome it. But we desire that the worth of
our proposals be discussed and acted upon on
their intrinsic merits. All of us here are armed
with instructions, and, in taking the course we
are pursuing, we are simply doing what we are
bidden to do by our Government. We cannot
take any back track, because an Act of our Fede-
ral Legislature requires us to proceed on definite
lines.
To us, at any rate, it appears that the Confe-
rence is competent to deal with the proposal
under Article i of our suggestions and that the
moment has come when we should be bold.
The League of Nations has brought us to this
stage by its steady and effective efforts. It is
our hope and purpose to collaborate closely
with the League in this matter, in the future as
in the past. It is our contention that Article
i is carrying out the express purpose of the
Assembly as stated in the resolution which it
adopted.
To us it seems as though we are at the part-
ing of the ways. The question is : Shall we
try to make a compact with an evil, or shall
we declare a war of extermination upon it in
terms that admit of no compromise ?
There is increasing caution among physicians
in their use of habit-forming drugs. The menace
of their abuse is admitted and recognised by all
the delegations present. An alliance with the
enemy would be as an alliance between a lamb
and a tiger or a cobra and its victim. Were


our gallery in this room composed of addicts [ the attitude of the Indian delegation perfectly
of every country forcibly separated from their
drug, I do not hesitate to say that the charac-
ter of the document we would sign would be
far more drastic than anything contained in
the American suggestions. I repeat, we can-
not compromise with a curse. The timid voice
of bureaucracy and the plans to protect busi-
ness interests must be dismissed as false guides.
Some of our colleagues may think that I
cannot see the trees for the wood, a charge
frequently brought against idealists. My reply
is changing my simile from there being a
lion in the way that there are others who
cannot see the wood for the trees or even for
one tree. My delegation asks that there may be
honest and square treatment of an honest and
square document, that the controverted sec-
tions may be treated on their merits ; if, here
and there, advanced proposals are made, for
which practical measures cannot be devised im-
mediately, it will be easy enough to make a
reservation in regard to such a proposal and
then proceed to work out, as soon as possible,
means by which to make it practicable.
I trust, as I said in my speech at the begin-
ning of the Conference, that free discussion
will not be impeded nor honest proposals side-
tracked by legalism and technicalities. Should
this happen, it would be a misfortune for this
Conference, for the countries represented, and
for the League of Nations.
I speak with equanimity, for the cause we
espouse cannot be defeated. Postponement of
effective action will react on the highest inte-
rests of those who advocate it, store up new
sorrows and troubles for all of us, and leave a
new trail of misery behind its lagging steps.
But victory is sure to come in the end. After
all, the jury in this case is the world of thinking
men and women, whose interests we are serv-
ing. Those of us whose purpose is set and who
believe that we are in the right will not be
daunted by obstructions. With William Lloyd
Garrison, we say, in the words of his great libe-
ration challenge to the bureaucrats and vested
interests of his day : "I will not retract.
I will not retreat an inch. I will not equivocate.
I will not compromise. I will not be silent.
And I will be heard?. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : I call upon Mr. Campbell,
delegate of India, to address the Conference.
Mr. Campbell (India)
Mr. President In the speech which I have
just made, I stated the facts, and, of set pur-
pose, I stated the facts in as cold and frigid a
manner as possible. I did not state the facts
until, in the considered opinion of our delega-
tion, it was necessary to do so in order that
India?s position in this matter should be made
perfectly clear.
As I have already told the Conference, and as
I desire to repeat now, the Indian delegation
considered every possible means of avoiding the
necessity for making this declaration. I ask
the Conference to believe me when I say this.
As I have said, I have stated the facts. Are those
facts challenged ? If not, they are there for the
members of this Conference and for the world
at large to form their own opinion regarding
them. In drawing my conclusions, I again limi-
ted myself of set purpose to the conclusions
which it was essential to draw in order to make
clear.
There is one other point to which I wish to refer.
Bishop Brent, in the course of his speech, made,
on at least two occasions, a somewhat pointed
reference to business and vested interests. I
think, if I may say so, that that was somewhat
ungenerous on Bishop Brent?s part. Bishop
Brent is, I believe, fully aware of the position
of the Government of India in respect of this
matter. The Government of India has for-
mally declared that its opium policy is not ac-
tuated by financial or economic motives. That
declaration I have repeated here upon several
occasions,speaking as the delegate of the Govern-
ment of India. To anyone who knows the
facts and who studies the facts, the truth of
that declaration is proved beyond all possibi-
lity of doubt. Ido not think therefore that it
should be lightly challenged.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. de Aguero y
Bethancourt, delegate of Cuba, to address the
Conference.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba) :
Translation : I have asked to speak in
order to raise a point of order. I request the
President and all my colleagues at this Confe-
rence to adjourn the meeting. The reasons
which lead me to make this request are very
weighty ones. We have to decide here whether
the Conference is competent to accept or reject
the proposals of the American delegation.
We have just listened to the eloquent words
of the two delegates of India and the two dele-
gates of the United States. The four speeches
which we have heard are filled with references,
dates, quotations, etc. We cannot, in a few
moments, analyse, examine and assimilate all
the arguments which have been put before us
and then record a conscientious vote.
We must have time for reflection, before we
can gain a clear and fair appreciation of the prob-
lem before us, a problem which is a grave one,
since it involves the prestige of the League of
Nations as well as the prestige and success of
this Conference.
If the resolution that we take here is influenced
by our personal sympathies, or if we have not
sufficiently studied the arguments submitted
by the two parties, we run the risk of being
universally condemned. Let us not forget that
the question with which we have to deal affects
the happiness of mankind and that public
opinion is closely following our work.
I will not venture at this moment to give a
definitive opinion upon the statements made by
the delegations of India and the United States
of America. Indeed, I could not do so with any
clearness, and I think that my honourable
colleagues are in the same position.
If we adjourn the meeting until to-morrow,
we shall have time to reflect, to study the matter
and also to consider it dispassionately.
I would request the President and my honour-
able colleagues to adjourn the discussion.
The President
Translation : The Cuban delegate has moved
that the Conference adjourn the discussion. I do
not think that this motion must necessarily be
submitted to the meeting ; as President, I can
take the decision myself. I would prefer,


however, to act with the approval of the mem- Sub-Committees can bear it in mind during
bers of the Conference. I think that the majo-
rity is in favour of adjourning the discussion
until to-morrow.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba)
Translation : When I asked for the adjourn-
ment of the discussion, I forgot two things:
(i) to explain to Mr. Campbell that I had asked
to speak in order to suggest the adjournment of
the discussion ; and (2) to indicate an approxi-
mate date for the continuation of this meeting.
In my opinion, it would be too soon to resume
the discussion to-morrow. We must wait until
our minds are somewhat calmer, and until we
have had time to reflect. There is no doubt
that the thirty-nine delegations here present
are animated by the best intentions, and we
shall certainly find among our number experts
who will succeed in drafting a formula which
will bring this debate to an end, a formula of
agreement which will lead to the withdrawal
of the reservations made by India and the
United States. A resolution containing such
important reservations would be harmful to
our work.
It would be well, Mr. President, to allow more
time and not to meet until Monday next.
The President
Translation : Two proposals are before the
Conference, one to adjourn the discussion, and
the other to continue it next Monday. I ima-
gine that the first proposal has already been
accepted.
iVI. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : I understood that the adjourn-
ment was approved by the Conference. I
think it would be wiser not to meet until Monday
next. It is for the President to decide.
IVI. Buero (Uruguay)
Translation % : I agree with M. de Palacios.
Before taking any decision on the second pro-
posal of M. de Aguero y Bethancourt, I would
suggest that the Conference appoint a small
Committee to examine the question of the com-
petence of the Conference. This Committee
might report to the Conference at the begin-
ning of the next meeting, the day and hour of
which would be fixed by the President.
My second proposal supplements that of M. de
Aguero, and M. de Palacios will doubtless be
willing to accept it.
The President
Translation : M. Buero?s proposal is a sepa-
rate one. We have two proposals to consider ;
that of M. de Palacios suggests an adjournment
sine die, that is to say, till the President decides.
As this plenary meeting was summoned on
the initiative of a delegation here present, I
think I have the right to ask the opinion of
that delegation as to the question which is now
put to us.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) :
I have no desire to hurry the Conference.
This is, however, a very important matter ;
it is, in fact the vital part of the proposals of
the United States. It seems to me that we ought
to decide it as promptly as possible, so that the
?their deliberations.
I am inclined to agree to the proposal to
adjourn till Monday. If I consulted my per-
sonal wishes, I believe I would. It is a matter
which rests entirely with the persons who want
to adjourn until to-morrow. It suits us either
to adjourn till to-morrow or until Monday, but I
would not like to see the next meeting postponed
later than Monday. I feel that this is a matter
which is really part of the foundation of the Con-
ference, and has got to be determined promptly
so that the Sub-Committees will have ample
opportunity to take it into consideration during
their deliberations.
The President :
Translation : We have now to discuss M.
Buero?s proposal. It is hardly a point of order,
since we have only to pronounce as to the forma-
tion of a special Committee to deal with this
very definite question. In my opinion, it would
be better not to consider this proposal for the
moment, although it is a very interesting one.
I therefore propose to adjourn the plenary
Conference until Monday next at 10.30 a.m.
If you accept my view and do not feel called
upon to discuss M. Buero?s proposal, I can
adjourn the meeting.
I call upon M. Sze, the last speaker on my
list, to address the Conference.
IVI. Sze (China) :
Mr. President I shall not address the Confe-
rence in view of the explanation you have just
given. You have anticipated what I was
going to say.
M. Buero (Uruguay)
Translation : I apologise for causing this
discussion, but I feel bound to observe that the
question is one of vital importance. We have
appointed Sub-Committees for less important
problems, and I think the creation of a special
Sub-Committee is essential to deal with so
serious a question.
If the Conference does not consider a special
Sub-Committee necessary, I propose that the
matter be submitted to the Business Committee,
which would then give us its impartial opinion.
It would also be well to hear the two parties
concerned the United States and India.
The President
Translation : I submit M. Buero?s amended
proposal to the members of the Conference.
I would remind the delegate for Uruguay that
the question he proposes to submit to the Business
Committee is not quite new to it. The Com-
mittee has devoted much time to it at several
meetings. You will find evidence of this in
the programme drawn up by that Committee,
since it referred this very question to a Sub-
Committee.
IVI. Buero (Uruguay)
Translation : I was quite unaware of this
fact, and I accordingly withdraw my proposal.
The President
Translation : The proposal to adjourn the
Conference is accepted. I therefore have the
honour to convene the plenary Conference for
Monday next at 10.30 a.m.
The Conference rose at 7.50 p.m.


ELEVENTH MEETING

CONTENTS.
36. Composition of the French Delegation
and its Representation on Sub-Com-
mittee F.
37. Enactment of Effective Laws or Regu-
lations for the Control of the Pro-
duction and Distribution of Raw
Opium and Coca Leaves : Proposal
SUBMITTED BY THE DELEGATION OF THE
United States of America.
Continuation of the discussion.
President : M. Herluf Zahle.
36. COMPOSITION OF THE FRENCH DELE-
GATION AND ITS REPRESENTATION
ON SUB-COMMITTEE F.
The President
Translation : Before beginning our agenda,
which contains only one item, I will call upon
M. van Wettum, the Netherlands delegate, to
speak.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
The French delegation has been enlarged
by a new member, M. Perrot, Inspector of Phar-
macies, Vice-Dean of the Paris Faculty and
Director of ?TOffice national des Matieres pre-
mieres vegetales pour la Droguerie et la Phar-
macie? (Ministry of Commerce). I have the
honour to propose that the membership of Sub-
Committee F, consisting of medical and phar-
maceutical experts, be increased from fifteen to
sixteen to afford M. Perrot the opportunity of
taking part in the work of that Sub-Committee.
The President
Translation : The proposal submitted to
the Conference by the Netherlands delegate is
similar to one submitted at a previous meeting
by the head of another delegation and adopted
by the Conference. It consists of two parts :
(1) that the membership of Sub-Committee F
be increased; and (2) that M. Perrot be elected
member of that Sub-Committee.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba)
Translation : I beg to support M. van
Wettum?s proposal.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I beg to second the proposal.
The President
Translation : As no one has any objection,
both parts of the above proposal are adopted.
The Chairman of Sub-Committee F will be
informed in due course, [Agreed).
37. ENACTMENT OF EFECTIVE LAWS OR
REGULATIONS FOR THE CONTROL OF
THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION
OF RAW OPIUM AND COCA LEAVES :
PROPOSAL SUBMITTED BYTHE DELE-
GATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA : CONTINUATION OF THE
DISCUSSION.
The President
1 ranslation : We now ha,ve to discuss the
only item on our agenda, the American proposal
concerning Article 1 of the American draft.
I call upon Mr. Clayton, delegate of India, to
address the Conference.
Mr. Clayton (India)
Mr. President I wish to thank you for the
speedy response which you have given to my
request for an opportunity to withdraw a mis-
statement in my speech last Friday. In that
speech I attributed to the League Secretariat
the responsibility for the drafting of a certain
Assembly resolution. I have since discovered
that the Secretariat does not draft Assembly
resolutions. I desire, therefore, to withdraw
unreservedly the imputation which I made and
to express my regret that, in my inexperience
of League procedure, this being my first visit to
Geneva, I should have erroneously assumed that
the resolution in question was drafted by the
League Secretariat.
The President
Translation : The Secretary-General of the
League has requested me to thank the delegate
of India for the prompt withdrawal of his remark.
His statement will be mentioned in the record
of this meeting.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne, delegate of the Bri-
tish Empire, will address the Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
Mr. President?The question before us is the
proposal of the United States delegation that
the suggestion in Article 1 of the United States
draft be referred to the First Committee for
consideration. In regard to this matter, the
question of the competence of the Conference
to deal with it has been raised and argued at
some length. The question of competence is
one of considerable importance, because other
proposals have been laid, and are intended to
be laid before the Conference, on which the
same question may be raised, and the course
which the Conference decides to take in regard
to the particular matter now before us will
have an important bearing upon the proceedings
of the Conference, the results of the Conference,
and, I may add, its length.
I think I am right in saying that two dif-
ferent lines have been taken in regard to this
question of competence. On the one hand, the
contention has been put forward that the Con-


ference has power to settle its own agenda
and, if it desires, to enlarge the agenda con-
tained in the Assembly resolution of 1923. I do
not think that that line was taken in Friday?s
debate, but it has been taken on other occasions.
On the other hand, it has been contended that
the particular question now before us is within
the scope of the agenda as contained in the
Assembly resolution.
As regards the first contention, I should have
thought the, point was clear. When a Conference
of plenipotentiaries has been convoked to con-
sider a particular question or group of questions
with a view to arriving at an international
agreement, and the Governments interested have
sent their plenipotentiaries with powers to deal
with that question or group of questions only,
the scope of the Conference can only be en-
larged by mutual consent, that is to say, with
the consent of the Governments represented,
who would have to give their delegates the addi-
tional powers necessary, and, I imagine, also
with the consent of the convoking authority,
in this instance the Council of the League.
The second contention is a different one. It
has been argued at length, and different dele-
gations take different views. Ido not propose
to go over the ground again. I desire to take
a different ground in what I have to say to
the Conference this morning ; but I think it
is worth while to lay stress on the point upon
which the issue arises so that it may be clearly
before the minds of the Conference.
The Assembly resolution recommends that a
Conference of plenipotentiaries should be called
to consider, among other things, the possibi-
lity of limiting the production of raw opium and
the coca leaf for export to the amount required
for medicinal and scientific purposes. The sug-
gestion of the United States delegation is not
limited to the production for export, but it
covers alike production for export and produc-
tion for domestic use in the producing country,
and it suggests that both kinds of production
should be so limited that there would be no
surplus available for purposes not strictly
medical or scientific.
If that suggestion is interpreted literally and
strictly, it seems to mean that the use of opium
in India, in Persia, and possibly in other coun-
tries, for what are called semi-medicinal pur-
poses would have to be prohibited, and it
would mean that the similar use of the coca
leaf in Bolivia and, I believe, Peru and pos-
sibly other South American countries, would
also have to be prohibited. There is no doubt
in my own mind that this would be outside
the scope of our agenda. But a doubt, has oc-
curred to me whether that is really the intention
of the suggestion of the United States delega-
tion.
We know that the United States of America
has a great domestic problem in regard to this
matter, that large quantities of the drugs are
smuggled into its territories, which greatly
hamper it in dealing with this problem, that the
over-production of the raw material and the
drugs, which enables large quantities of the drugs
to be diverted into the illicit international trade,
is a matter of great and legitimate concern to
the United States Government, and it is of
the first importance to it that over-pro-
duction shall be reduced so that there shall be
no surplus available for the illicit international
traffic.
If the purpose of the United States proposal
is that the production of the raw material shall
be so limited that there shall be no surplus
available which can be sent out of the producing
country beyond the quantities required for
medicinal and scientific purposes, then, so far as
I can see, there is really no difference of opinion in
the Conference as to the desirability of such
limitation, whether it is actually practicable to
secure such limitation or not ?the practicability
is one of the questions which the Conference has
been convoked to consider. The question which
has arisen would, in that case, be settled at once.
I should be very glad, and I believe the Confe-
rence would be very glad if,, later on in the
debate, the United States delegation would make
its intention on this point quite clear to us.
I said just now that I did not propose, in
what I had to say to the Conference, to go
over the ground again in regard to the question
of competence, but that I wished to take diffe-
rent ground.
Assuming (as I must for the moment)
that the United States of America?s suggestion
is intended to bear the strict literal interpret-
ation I have mentioned above, I wish to ask
whether, quite apart from the question of com-
petence, it is desirable, whether it is in the best
interests of the Conference, of the work we
are assembled here to do and the great step
forward that we are hoping to make, that the
question of the use of opium or the coca leaf
for domestic consumption in the producing
countries should be raised now. The stand
I wish to take is that, undeniably, it has been
understood by a number of the Governments
represented here that this question would not
be raised at the Conference.
Now, I am not going into any controversial
matters, but, in order to make my point clear,
I must touch briefly on the history of the ques-
tion. I have taken part from the start in the
investigations and discussions which have led
up to this Conference. In particular, I was
present at the session of the Opium Advisory
Committee in 1923, at the meeting of the Assem-
bly in 1923, at all the sessions of the Prepara-
tory Committee, which was entrusted by the
Council with the task of preparing a programme
for this Conference, and at the session of the
Opium Advisory Committee last August.
As everybody knows, the matter first took
shape at the session of the Opium Advisory
Committee held in 1923, as the result both of
the work which the Opium Advisory Committee
had been doing during the two preceding years
and of the proposals of the United States.
There were long discussions the particular
question before us was much debated and a
resolution was finally adopted by general con-
sent.
I have no right, of course, to speak of the im-
pression left on the minds of the United States
representatives. We all know how easy it is for
different impressions to be left on different
minds. I can only speak of the impression
that was left on my mind and, I believe, on the
minds of others in the Opium Advisory Com-
mittee. That impression certainly was that this
question of the use of opium and the coca leaf
for domestic purposes in the producing countries
was not going to be raised at this Conference.
I should like to quote a few extracts from the
Minutes of the proceedings of the Opium Advi-
sory Committee to satisfy the Conference that


there was a really honest and not unjustifiable
impression to that effect. In a somewhat
lengthy speech which I ventured to make to
the Committee during its fifth session, after the
United States representatives had temporarily
left the meeting, I said this 1 :
?I think there has been especially a great
deal of misunderstanding in the United
States on the subject ; but in the conver-
sations which I have had with Mr. Porter,
and to which I think I may fairly refer, he
has made it quite clear to me that it is not
the intention of the American delegation
or of the American Government to dictate
or interfere in any way with what the Indian
Government or any other Government simi-
larly situated may regard as a proper semi-
medicinal use of the drugs in countries
where conditions such as that exist.?
I quote this only in order to show the impres-
sion which was left upon my mind. At a later
meeting of the Committee, Sir John Jordan,
whose name is well known to every member
of the Conference, said much the same thing 2 .
He said : ?He had been led to believe, in conver-
sations with Mr. Porter, that the American dele-
gation had no intention of interfering with the
internal practice in India or any other Oriental
country. It was indeed unfortunate that the
Committee did not possess full explanations on
this subject by Mr. Porter, but all the impres-
sions which he had gathered pointed to the fact
that the American delegation did not intend
to interfere with the well-established use of
raw opium in India.?
I need not quote further extmcts. I think
those two extracts alone will convince this Con-
ference that there was what I have called a
real, an honest and a not unjustifiable impres-
sion that this matter was not going to be raised.
It seems to me also that the resolution
which was finally adopted by the Advisory
Committee, and which limits the subject to be
discussed to the production for export, confirms
the impression I have mentioned.
Later on, the resolution of the Advisory
Committee was considered by the Assembly in
September 1923. I took part in those pro-
ceedings, and I am quite sure that there was
no intention then to make any alteration in the
scope of the Conference as suggested by the
Advisory Committee. The resolutions of the
Advisory Committee and the recommenda-
tions of the Advisory Committee were ap-
proved en bloc. The wording of the sixth resolu-
tion of the Assembly somewhat altered the
arrangement of the words, but I am quite sure
that there was no intention of changing the
sense. Had there been such an intention, it
would have been clearly set out. A change was
suggested by the Assembly in the composition
of the Conference and that change is expressly
mentioned, as you know, in the Assembly
resolution.
There then followed the proceedings in the
Preparatory Committee and the Advisory Com-
mittee this year. I think the members of these
1 Minutes of the Fifth Session of the Advisory
Committee on the Traffic in Opium and other Dan-
gerous Drugs (page 84).
2 Minutes of the Fifth Session of the Advisory Com-
mittee on the Traffic in Opium and other Dangerous
Drugs (page 96).
Committees will agree with me that the whole
of their work was concentrated on producing
a scheme for limiting the manufacture of the
drugs and the production of the raw material
for export. I need only refer to the British
scheme, which is appended to the report of the
Preparatory Committee, to show what, in the
mind of the British Government at any rate,
was understood to be the scope of the Confe-
rence.
I have said all this in order to make it clear
to the Conference that there has been a definite
impression or understanding on the part of
certain Governments represented here and
some of the Governments most interested in the
matter ?in regard to this question. In par-
ticular, my own Government believed that this
matter was outside the scope of the Confe-
rence. It has had no notice that the question
was going to be raised ; it has accordingly had
no opportunity of considering the question or
of giving me any instructions in regard to it.
We all know that the question is one about
which there has been much controversy and
on which very different opinions are enter-
tained, both by medical men and others. If it
had been understood that it was going to be
discussed, my Government would certainly
have had to consider its position very carefully
and to consult with the Government of India
on the subject. Neither Great Britain nor any
of its Dominions, apart from the Dominion of
India, are, as you know, countries which pro-
duce either raw opium or the coca leaf, but such
a proposal as has been put forward now does,
of course, interest the British Government very
closely, and as I say, it would have had to consi-
der the matter very carefully. It has not been able
to do so, and I am here without any authority
to negotiate in regard to the matter. I imagine
that there must be other delegations here who
are in the same position.
In these circumstances, my position and the
position of other delegations being what they
are, I wish to ask the Conference whether it is
really quite reasonable to ask us to deal with
this matter at this Conference. I have heard
it asked, ?Why not discuss the question ?
This is a world-Conference. The experts of
the different countries are here. Why not hear
what they have to say ??
I am not quite sure what is meant by ?dis-
cussion?. Is it merely that the delegations should
state their views and experiences ? Personally,
I should be very much interested to hear the
grounds on which the United States delegation
bases its proposal as regards domestic consump-
tion in India, Persia, Bolivia and elsewhere, and
the manner in which it would propose that the
habits of centuries should be stamped out. I
imagine also, though I have no authority to
speak for it, that the delegation from India
would be quite ready to give any information
the Conference may desire with regard to the
position in India. But is it going to be worth
while ?
We are not an academic debating society but
a Conference assembled to conclude an inter-
national Convention. Will such a discussion
really get us any further ? May it not in fact
do positive harm by shortening the time at our
disposal, which is none too long for reaching
a settlement on the big questions included in
the agenda, and possibly, by producing a contro-
versial atmosphere, render the conclusion of


agreements, already difficult enough, much
more difficult ?
If, on the other hand, by ?discussion? is meant
negotiation, what can the Conference, I ask,
usefully do ? This is a matter which prima-
rily concerns the producing countries. The
solution rests with them. Unless they can agree
we can get no result. We know that India
cannot here and now change her policy. We
have had before us the Persian memorandum,
which is not very much more hopeful. We
have heard from the Bolivian delegate that
he cannot agree to the prohibition of the domest
tic use of the coca leaf in Bolivia. Peru is nos
here. Is it too much to say that an agreement
on this matter is not within sight ?
It has been said that individual Government-
may attach reservations, but on this point
reservations mean failure. As I have said
more than once, unless an agreement can be
reached between all the manufacturing coun-
tries with regard to the limitation of the
manufacture, or between all the producing coun-
tries with regard to the limitation of the produc-
tion of the raw material, we have in effect failed.
Bishop Brent referred the other day to
vested interests and bureaucrats. I personally
do not represent any vested interest, and, though
I am an official, I do not think I am a bureau-
crat. Those who have worked with me on the
Opium Advisory Committee and the Prepara-
tory Committee will not, I venture to say,
accuse me of any want of interest or sympathy
in regard to this question of suppressing the
abuse of opium and drugs. I am afraid,
however, that, if this matter is raised, we run
the risk of losing the results of all the work
that we here in Europe and the United States
Government have been doing on this question
of the limitation of manufacture for the last
two or three years.
I believe there is so large a measure of agree-
ment in this Conference on the limitation, at
any rate, of the manufacture of the drugs, that it
is possible to get an agreement which will
mark a most important advance. But I fear
that, if this other subject is raised, which is a
controversial subject, on which some of the
Governments most interested are not prepared
at the moment to come to any decision, we run
the risk of losing everything.
We all know the old fable of /Esop about
the dog which had a leg of mutton in his mouth
and which saw in a reflection in the water
another dog with another leg of mutton in his
mouth, and thereupon dropped his leg of mut-
ton in order to secure that of the other dog.
Shall we not be in much the same position if,
having got something within our grasp, we let
it go in order to reach out for something which,
I am afraid, we cannot possibly attain at this
Conference ? {Applause.)

delegate of the Netherlands, to address the Con-
ference.

As regards the proposal of the delegation of
the United States to limit the production of
raw opium and coca leaves, so that there will
be no surplus available for purposes not strictly
medical or scientific, I have to point out that
the invitation of the Council of the League is
far more limited, as it concerns only a limitation
of production for export. These words ?for
export? have been omitted in the United States
proposal, by which fact the Conference, in con-
sidering this proposal, would enlarge its ori-
ginally intended scope to such an extent as to
make it impossible for me to express an
opinion on the matter.
As a member of the Advisory Committee, I
have myself proposed to extend the Hague
Convention so as to cover the control of the
export of coca leaves and the Governments
represented here may rest assured that no Java
leaf will be exported into their territories unless
an import certificate has been previously issued
by them.
We cannot, however, limit in Java the grow-
ing of coca-shrubs, which are used by the
natives as hedges and the leaves of which are
never used or exported. My Government was
not and could not be aware that the question
of the limitation of production of coca leaves
would come up at this Conference in this form.
As regards the question of the limitation of raw
opium, there is a similar difference between
the invitation of the Council of the League and
the American proposal, as the latter disregards
the words ?for export?, which figure in the said
invitation. I entirely support Sir Malcolm
Delevingne?s statement that the understanding
on the part of a number of members of the Advi-
sory Committee, amongst whom I may mention
myself, was that this question would not be
raised at this Conference.
As regards what passed during the fifth session
of the Advisory Committee, as regards the express
reservation of India made and accepted on that
occasion, and also as regards the wording of the
invitation of the Council, my Government has
not, in preparing for this Conference, considered
the possibility of the question of raw opium
coming up in this form. I have therefore no
instructions on this point and am not able to
express an opinion on the matter.
As to the second part of the American proposal,
in which an exception is made for prepared
opium, I want to ask for an explanation from
the delegation of the United States whether
the words ?Chapter II of this Convention?
refer to the Convention of 1912.
In conclusion, I desire to express the hope
that the interpretation given by Sir Malcolm
Delevingne to the proposal of the United States
may prove to be the right one, as in that case
the Conference, in my opinion, will have found
the solution of the controversy which has arisen
and which threatens the success of our work.

gate of Japan, to address the Conference.
M. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : Mr, President, ladies and gen-
tlemen The Conference decided last Friday
that it was competent to deal with Article 9-A
of the American scheme, so that I cannot
see why there should be such a heated discus-
sion on Article 1. It is quite true that the prohi-
bition of the manufacture and distribution of
heroin is not expressly mentioned in the Ame-
rican suggestions, but the Conference decided
that it could discuss it, as heroin occupied an
important place among dangerous drugs and
was therefore deserving of our attention. The


question of competence is fundamental and international point of view, to limit production,
the Japanese delegation desires again to make
its point of view on this matter perfectly
clear.
It was perhaps a mistake to embark on long
discussions regarding the strictly legal compe-
tence of the Conference, for our duty is rather
to carry out the task imposed upon us by con-
siderations of a humanitarian order. It is in
pursuit of a regular crusade against dangerous
drugs that all these eminent delegates are met
here under the auspices of the League. En-
lightened public opinion throughout the world
expects something more from us than long dis-
cussions on legal points. It expects of us a
work of humanity, justice and philanthropy.
This obviously does not prevent us from deal-
ing with the legal side of the question. That
aspect of the matter is also included in the
invitation addressed by the Secretary-General
of the League to the various Governments.
The purpose of the Second Conference is stated
in Resolution VI adopted by the fourth Assem-
bly regarding the traffic in opium and other
dangerous drugs. For all the delegates assem-
bled here, this resolution is the only document
defining the limits of our work.
The preparatory documents and private con-
versations have perhaps a certain historical
value. But the majority of the Governments,
which did not take part in these conversations
and did not collaborate in the preparation of
these documents, cannot regard themselves as
absolutely bound by them.
According to the Sixth Resolution, to which
I have just referred, the Conference has a dual
purpose :
1. To give effect to the principles sub-
mitted by the representatives of the United
States of America ;
2. To give effect to the policy adopted
by the League of Nations on the recommen-
dation of the Advisory Committee.
As regards the first point, the American prin-
ciples set forth on page 202 of the Minutes of
the Fifth Session of the Advisory Committee are
as follows :
(a) ?It must be recognised that the use
of opium products for other than medicinal
and scientific purposes is an abuse and not
legitimate.??
(b) ?In order to prevent the abuse of
these drugs, it is necessary to exercise the
control of the production of raw opium in
such a manner that there will be no sur-
plus available for non-medicinal and non-
scientific purposes.?
1 need not enumerate the Advisory Commit-
tee?s recommendations, as you have them before
you.
I propose now to enter into an exhaustive expla-
nation of my point of view as regards the com-
petence of the Conference and Article 1 of the
American suggestions.
1. Article 1 says expressly ??the control of
the production of raw opium?. This question is
therefore quite within our competence, and
there can be no doubt on the point.
2. As regards the distribution of raw opium,
there is no express mention in the American sug-
gestions. But when measures are taken, from an
this necessarily involves the question of the
control of production for export, which leads
on to the problem of distribution. If there is
any doubt, it is only necessary to refer to
paragraphs i and 2 of Part I of the Advisory
Committee?s project, which deal with this
matter.
3. Coca leaves are referred to indirectly
and by implication in the Preamble to the
American suggestions, and Part I, paragraphs 1
and 2, of the Advisory Committee?s project
deal expressly with this question. Such being
the case, there is no reason for not discussing
it.
Throughout our discussions, we must con-
stantly bear in mind the fact that the question of
drugs forms one indivisible whole. If we prevent
victims of opium from obtaining this drug, but
do not protect them against others, they will
simply turn to some different narcotic. Instead
of opium they will take morphine, and instead
of morphine, heroin, etc.
If our Conference is to arrive at really satis-
factory results, we must try to provide against
every possible means by which this evil could
re-invade the moral system. We must ensure
that, after having dealt with one danger, another
one, equally serious, shall not confront us.
This does not mean, however, that all our dis-
cussions are to result in an international Con-
vention between the Powers concerned. 1
should consider it a happy omen for the future
if we could now lay the foundations of an agree-
ment and thus proceed one step along the road
towards our ultimate aim the liberation of
humanity, for all time, from the scourge of
dangerous drugs.
In days gone by, when science was in its
infancy and the human race was uncorrupted,
religion, morality and law were one, working
for the betterment of humanity. But now,
unhappily, they are divided and law appears
to shun religion and to be indifferent to moral-
ity. If the dignity of human life is to be pro-
tected, if justice is to be maintained in interna-
tional relations, these three great forces must
unite the need is greater than ever. A law
not based on religion, an international agree-
ment not founded on a moral principle, is a
mere soul-less creation. We are all met here,
engaged in a holy war, but we can never hope
for victory unless we rely on the great moral and
religious forces which alone make conquest just
and permanent. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : I call upon Dr. Chodzko, dele-
gate of Poland, to address the Conference.
Dr. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gen-
tlemen At our last meeting we were witnesses,
silent, but not unmoved, of a contest in which
one side revealed to us the great purpose of
our Conference, calling for liberty of discussion
and a clear statement of views, while the other en-
deavoured to seek refuge in purely formal argu-
ments, without succeeding, however, in proving
the soundness of its standpoint, and contended
that we had no right to discuss the question of
the abuse of drugs in all its bearings.
I propose, without going into the reasons
which prompted this determined opposition to


the freedom of our debates, to deal with the
main arguments upon which it is based.
The chief point brought forward by the two
delegates of India was that this Conference
had to discuss a certain programme of work
and that it might not exceed the narrow limits
laid down in that programme. Ido not think
that they have read the documents submitted
to us with sufficient care.
Our Conference, which is called the Second
Opium Conference ( I do not think the word
"Second? is appropriate, since the present Con-
ference is the only one which has brought to-
gether all the nations concerned, and the only
one that can be called international in the widest
sense), was convened in virtue of an official docu-
ment of the League entitled ?Invitation to the
Second Opium Conference?. This document,
then, to use the apt expression employed by the
Czechoslovak delegate, M. Veverka, is the
Charter of our Conference.
It states that the essential object of the pre-
sent Conference is set forth in the sixth reso-
lution of the fourth Assembly of the League, a
copy of which was addressed to you for pur-
poses of reference. It was on the basis of this
resolution, therefore, that the programme of the
Conference had to be drawn up. This task
was entrusted by the Council of the League
to the Preparatory Committee appointed by the
Opium Advisory Committee.
What happened, as we read in the official
League document A. 32. 1924. XT, page 2, was
that, "in view of the fact that the Preparatory
Committee had not been able to present one ge-
neral plan for the consideration of the Second Con-
ference, it was decided, on the proposal of Mrs.
Hamilton Wright (i.e. of a United States repre-
sentative), that a Sub-Committee should
try once more to prepare a draft programme
for that Conference?. It may readily be ima-
gined that Mrs. Hamilton Wright?s task on the
Advisory Committee was not an easy one.
A special Sub-Committee then made a fresh
effort to draw up a programme, but the conclu-
sions of this Sub-Committee doubtless ap-
peared unsatisfactory to the Advisory Com-
mittee, as the latter felt unable to describe them
as the "programme? of the Second Conference.
Instead, it adopted, with comprehensible
modesty, the following resolution :
"The Advisory Committee decides to
transmit to the Council and to the Govern-
ments summoned to the Second Interna-
tional Conference, as a supplement to the
report of the Preparatory Committee, the
series of measures attached hereto (An-
nexes 1 and 2), which, in the opinion of
the Advisory Committee, furnish a satis-
factory basis for the work of the Confe-
rence and may prepare the way for a final
agreement.?
You see the immense distance which sepa-
rates this modest ?series of measures? which,
in the opinion of the Advisory Committee,
?furnish a satisfactory basis for the work of the
Conference? from what the delegates for India
describe with exaggerated emphasis as the only
authorised programme of an International Con-
ference of the scope of the present one.
It is in virtue of this unfortunate "series of
measures?, the very wording of which gives
rise to objections on the part of those members
of the Advisory Committee who assisted in
drawing them up, that we are asked to keep
silent. Even Mrs. Hamilton Wright, whose
intervention saved the work of the Prepara-
tory Committee from certain and lamentable
failure, is not to be allowed to speak. Can we
regard ourselves as bound by a document
which even its authors dare not call a definite
programme ?
But there is another aspect of the question
a consideration which will prove beyond doubt
that the document submitted to our Conference
by the Preparatory Committee does not possess
the authority of a programme. especially when
we come to consider how far the Preparatory
Committee has accomplished the task entrusted
to it at the request of the Council of the League.
As I have already pointed out, the special
purpose of our Conference is set forth, in the
opinion of the Council itself, in the sixth resolu-
tion of the fourth Assembly, which is annexed
to the official invitation addressed to the Govern-
ments.
Let us read carefully this document, which is
of such importance from our point of view.
If you look at Assembly Resolution VI, you
will see that it is composed of two parts.
In the first part, the fourth Assembly notes
that the Advisory Committee has reported that
the information available makes it possible for
the Governments concerned to examine, with
a view to the conclusion of an agreement,
the following questions :
i. The limitation of the amounts of
certain drugs to be manufactured ;
2. The limitation of the amounts of raw
opium and the coca leaf to be imported ;
3. The limitation of the production of
raw opium and the coca leaf for export to
the amount required for medicinal and
scientific purposes.
If we come to analyse the text of the first
part of the sixth resolution, we find simply
that the Advisory Committee thinks that it is
in possession of information, which might be
of use to our Conference, with regard to the
questions enumerated. It is a mere statement ;
it does not exclude anything or prevent delega-
tions in possession of information concerning
other questions in this domain from laying such
information before the Conference. I think
that this was the view held by our President when
he drew our attention, at one of our first meet-
ings, to the suggestions of the United States
and other delegations.
After this statement of fact, the Assembly
resolution, in the second part, gives us clear
directions as to the line we should follow when
examining the questions enumerated in the first
part. It is expressly stated in the text of the
resolution that these questions shall be exa-
mined ?as a means of giving effect to the prin-
ciples submitted by the representatives of the
United States of America?. This passage means
that the principles by which we are to be guided
in our work are those formulated by the United
States delegation.
But how is it possible for us to respond to the
Assembly?s appeal if those very principles,
which have been recommended to use as a
guide, cannot be discussed by this Conference ?
If, according to Mr. Campbell?s interpreta-
tion, the latter part of the resolution, which
speaks of giving effect to "the policy which the


League, on the recommendation of the Advisory course of its fifth session. I think that I shall
Committee, has adopted?, means that the
principles submitted by the United States can-
not be discussed, then one must suppose that
it was the deliberate intention of the Assembly
to nullify the part of the sixth resolution rela-
ting to the position of the United States repre-
sentative at our Conference a state of affairs
which is impossible and inadmissible as regards
both the Council and the Assembly of the League,
since the only policy which can be followed
by the League in matters relating to opium is
the one adopted by the United States delega-
tion, the only just one and the one which is in
keeping with the spirit of the Covenant. Ac-
cording to the sixth resolution, therefore, we
must be guided in our work by the principles
submitted by the United States delegation.
The delegate for India might object that this
is my own personal interpretation of the Council
document. I think, however, that, as a pleni-
potentiary, I am fully entitled to my own
interpretation of the document upon which my
work is to be based and that our Conference
is free to interpret that document as it thinks
fit. I declare that there is no authority in the
world that can deprive of this right an interna-
tional Assembly of plenipotentiaries.
I think that the misunderstanding in which
we are still involved is due to the indisputable
fact that the Preparatory Committee did not
deal sufficiently fully with all the aspects of
the sixth resolution of the Assembly, and did
not adequately carry out its duties towards
the Council and the Assembly.
To take just one example, I would ask you
to refer to Document A. 32, and to read through
Parts I, II and 111 of Annex I (pp. 5, 6 and 7),
comparing the text with that of Assembty
Resolution VI.
You will see that Part I relates to manufac-
tured drugs and part 11, mainly, to the system
of import and export licences. These two
parts might be regarded as corresponding roughly
to the first and second points in the first part of
the Assembly Resolution VI, but I would ask
what mention there is by the Preparatory
Committee of the limitation of the production
of raw opium and coca leaves an important
question involving the control of production and
one which was referred to by the Assembly ?
What measures has the Preparatory Com-
mittee proposed in this connection ? It would be
an idle task to look for a reply in the conclu-
sions submitted by that Committee. We are
entitled to ask the reason for this omission,
to ask by what right it has left undone a task
expressly entrusted to it under the terms of
the sixth resolution of the Assembly.
Moreover, even if we admit the view of the
delegates of India, if we agree to take the Pre-
paratory Committee?s conclusions as the sole
basis for the work of our Conference, we must
none the less record the fact that this ?pro-
gramme.? is incomplete through the fault of the
Preparatory Committee. It is our duty to
supplement it as we think fit.
I must apologise for having taken up so much
of your time, but would ask you, in conclusion,
to allow me to comment on some of the other
arguments submitted by the delegates of India.
Mr. Campbell appears 'to attach great impor-
tance to what he calls facts, namely, the conver-
sations held and the letters exchanged between
members of the Advisory Committee in the
be expressing the views of the majority of my
colleagues here when I declare that these let-
ters and these interviews whether they took
place before or after lunch do not affect us
as members of an International Conference.
Even if we examine in detail the document
referred to by Mr. Campbell, the Minutes of the
Fifth Session of the Opium Advisory Committee
(pages 118 and 119), we have the definite impres-
sion that the American representatives present
at that session made every effort to arrive at an
agreement and that Mr. Campbell associated
himself with the resolution passed. It is ob-
vious that if a unanimous agreement has been
reached in any Assembly (as Mr. Campbell
himself emphasised), it is inadmissible that
one of the parties to the agreement should still
make reservations. If we consult the docu-
ment referred to, we find, on page no, after
the resolutions unanimously adopted (page 118),
the words :
?Reservation by the representative of
the Government of India ;
?The use of raw opium, according to the
established practice in India, and its pro-
duction for such use are not illegitimate
under the Convention.?
Can this be called a unanimous agreement
when the very principle underlying the agree-
ment is nullified by a reservation ? '
Again, among the minor arguments sub-
mitted by the delegates for India, there is one
which strikes me particularly and about which
I feel bound to speak.
Mr. Campbell, when recommending the unre-
stricted use of opium by the people of India,
quoted the opinion of His Highness the Maha-
rajah of Nawanagar, according to whom opium
is regarded in India as a housewife?s remedy,
a domestic remedy, which has no ill effects on
the health or well-being of the native popula-
tion. I think that, if Mr. Campbell wanted
to start a medical discussion on the effects of
opium, he should quote medical experts
among whom His Highness the Maharajah could
not, I imagine, be included. In any case, I
reserve the-right to take part in such a discus-
sion, which would, no doubt, be most interesting.
I also wish to make a few remarks regarding
the speech of the British delegate, who advocates
the semi-medical use of drugs in India. This
question is also open to discussion, and ought
I think, to be left to medical experts, the only
persons who are competent to deal with it.
In any case, independent medical opinion is
unanimous in the matter.
I might mention a further fact which appears
to me to be of some importance. India, as
you know, is not the only centre for the pro-
duction of raw opium. Large quantities are
produced in Persia, Turkey, China, Indo-
China, etc. None of the delegates of these
countries have asked us to refrain from discuss
ing the opium question in all its aspects
quite the contrary, as may be seen from the
excellent report on Persian opium submitted by
the Persian delegation, in which the present
position is described with the utmost frankness
and sincerity and in which the firm intention is
manifested to put a stop to the abuse of opium
in Persia. It is clear that justice and equity
alike preclude any country represented at this
Conference from laying claim to a privilege


which other countries in the same position have neighbouring country which should never have
abandoned.
The arguments brought forward by the
Indian delegation have not caused me to change
my opinion, and I have the honour, therefore,
in the name of the Polish Government, to give
my full support to the proposal of the United
States delegation that Article i of the American
suggestions be referred to the First Committee
of the Conference.
It goes without saying that the Polish dele-
gation would welcome any agreement that could
be reached between the United States delega-
tion and the delegation for India.
I am authorised to state that the Senate of
the Free City of Danzig is in entire agreement
with the views of the Polish Government.
The President :
Translation : There are still three speakers on
my list and there will probably be others. I myself
propose, at the close of the discussion, to sum-
marise the statements of the different speakers,
so that we shall have to devote some consi-
derable time to the discussion of the question
now before the plenary meeting. I propose,
therefore, that we adjourn at i o?clock and meet
again at 3.30 p.m.
The Bolivian and Chinese delegates are down
to speak. The Bolivian delegate should speak
first, but I suggest, if he will allow me, that, in
order to give the interpreter a rest, I should
call first upon M. Sze.
M. Sze (China)
Mr. President, members of the Conference
I want first of all to thank the delegate of
Bolivia for his courtesy in allowing me to speak
before him.
The paper that I am about to read to you was
prepared yesterday before I had had the advan-
tage of listening to the speeches made this
morning ; therefore, Ido not propose to touch
upon these recent speeches except to say one
or two words of appreciation in respect of one
or two of the speakers.
I want to tell you all that I have always
believed in the sincerity of the distinguished
delegate of the British Empire. I have been
associated with him in the First Conference.
I need only remind you that he was the author
of the programme for that Conference. I have
followed him most closely and have seen how
he tried to put through the programme which
he proposed. For that very reason I asked
him, begged him, implored him again and again,
in the First Conference to get his programme
through and, if possible, to get through more
than he had proposed to the Advisory Com-
mittee.
As to the remarks made by the delegate for
the Netherlands, I noticed that he emphasised
his point regarding opium for export. In dis-
cussing the question of opium for export, it will
be difficult not to touch upon one or two aspects
of opium declared and even certified for domestic
use only. We all know that some of the opium
imported into the Far Eastern territories and
possessions of the European Powers for local
consumption has found channels by which to
leave such territories and possessions and go
to other countries. The memorandum of the
Persian delegation also throws considerable
interesting light on opium exported from a
left the borders of that producing country.
I fully subscribe to the principle that nations
assembled in a Conference should not attempt
to dictate to one of their members the domestic
policies it should pursue. Especially in the
case of India, as we were told by its distinguished
delegate in the First Opium Conference, the
Government operates under the peculiar
disadvantage that such efforts as it might be
disposed to make to educate its subjects regard-
ing the evils of the misuse of opium would be
worse than futile. He quoted as an instance
an instance which was within his personal and
official knowledge the experience of his Govern-
ment at a time when plague was raging. The
people were exhorted by the Government to
take preventive measures and they refused
to do so. When, however, the Government
ceased its efforts, the people themselves, feeling
that they were acting without governmental
compulsion, at once took action to free them-
selves from the scourge from which they were
suffering.
While thus agreeing with the distinguished
delegate of India that a country must determine
for itself what is feasible and desirable for it
to do in regard to the production and use of
opium, I am not able to agree with him, but,
rather, must agree with the views of the dele-
gation of the United States of America, that,
when an International Conference is considering
a matter of world-wide importance, it is proper
that it should examine that matter in all its
aspects, even though, incidentally, it becomes
necessary to consider conditions in a particular
country, provided, of course, that that consi-
deration is controlled by a spirit of friendli-
ness and fairness.
In the First Conference the distinguished dele-
gate of the Government of India did not hesi-
tate indeed, he seemed to show at times even
an eagerness to animadvert upon conditions
in my own country. To this I raised no objec-
tion, save when I thought that he had been mis-
led, by a too credulous mind, to accept as true
statements for which, in fact, there was no
adequate supporting evidence.
It seems to me that, as was said by the
distinguished first delegate of the United States
of America, the Indian Government should
not be too apprehensive of what may be the
outcome of a discussion regarding the possi-
bility of so limiting the production of the
world?s opium as to leave no surplus for other
than strictly medicinal and scientific uses.
Should the Conference, as a result of that dis-
cussion, embody in the Convention which it
drafts proposals which are not acceptable to
the Indian Government, that Government can,
by express reservations, relieve itself from
obligation to enforce them within its own juris-
diction.
It is a strange proposition that a single parti-
cipating Government may demand that an
International Conference shall exclude from its
consideration a subject of general and great
importance, simply because that Government
fears that, incidentally, references may be made
to conditions of fact existing within its territo-
ries and because it is apprehensive that agree-
ments may be reached by the other Powers
to which it may have to make reservations.
As regards technical questions regarding the
competence of this Conference, I have no desire


to speak at length. Ihe issue has been some-
what confused by the allegation upon the part
of the distinguished first delegate of the Govern
ment of India of an understanding, based, in
part at least, upon unrecorded events and upon
his personal interpretation of them, that the
proposition contained in Article 1 of the American
scheme would not be presented to this Conference
by that delegation.
It seems, however, from the statement made
by the American delegation that there was no
such understanding. At any rate, this side
issue is of no importance to the Conference, for,
even had such an understanding existed be-
tween the representatives of the American and
Indian Governments, it would still be within
the right of any other Government represented
at this Conference to make the same proposal as
that which the American delegation has made
in Article 1 of its programme.
This, then, brings us back to the real question
of what may be termed the constitutional com-
petence of this Conference, and this question is
a very simple one. The Conference, as is ad-
mitted by all, derives its competence from the
invitation that called it into being. That in-
vitation was issued by the League of Nations in
pursuance of a resolution adopted on September
27th, 1923, which stated that the Conference
should be called to devise measures to be taken
as a means of giving effect to the principles
submitted by the representatives of the LTnited
States of America and to the policy which the
League, on the recommendation of the Advisory
Committee, has adopted?. These American
proposals, which the Assembly of the League
itself denominates as ?principles?, although
the first delegate of the Government of India
objects to the term, state, in so many words,
that, if the purpose of the Hague Convention is
to be achieved according to its spirit and true
intent, the use of opium products for other than
medicinal and scientific purposes is an abuse and
is not legitimate, and that, if this abuse and
illegitimate use is to be prevented, the produc-
tion of raw opium must be so controlled that
there will be no surplus available for non-medi-
cinal and non-scientific purposes.
It has been said that it was not within the
jurisdiction of the Advisory Committee, not
even of the League itself, to construe the mean-
ing of the Hague Convention. This jis true
in the sense that neither the Advisory Com-
mittee nor the League can give to the Hague
Convention a construction that will legally
determine the obligations under it of the Powers
signatory to it. But it was fully within the
competence of the Advisory Committee of the
League and of the League itself to announce to
the world what was its own construction of the
purpose of the Hague Convention, and, in the
light of that construction, to invite the nations
of the world to meet again in order to agree,
by common action, upon means, further than
those already in operation, for realising the
aims thus declared.
The nature of this Conference or of its com-
petence would not have been changed if the
League had simply affirmed, without reference
to the Hague Convention, that the use of
opium products for other than medicinal and
scientific purposes is an abuse and that, for
the correction of that abuse, it seemed to the
League that the production of opium should
be so controlled that there would be no surplus
available for non-medicinal and non-scientific
purposes, and that, based upon that proposal,
the Powers should assemble in order to deter-
mine concerted means for giving effect to it.
The honourable delegate of the Government
of India has called attention to the fact that,
in the Advisory Committee, at the time when the
American proposals were accepted, he made the
reservation that the use of raw opium accord-
ing to established practice in India, and its
production for such use, were not to be deemed
illegitimate under the Hague Convention.
No reference is made in the resolutions adopted
by the Assembly of the League to this reser-
vation, but, whatever significance, little or
great, may be attached to this omission, it is
to be observed that the reservation in question
has, by its very terms, no further force than to
assert that the established use of opium in
India, and its production for that use, do not
come under the ban of the Hague Convention. The
reservation does not assert that the established
use of opium in India is legitimate in the
broader and intrinsic sense of being physically
and morally harmless. Despite the world?s me-
dical and scientific opinion, the Indian Govern-
ment may maintain that, as used in India, opium
is harmless, but this proposal is not con-
tained in the reservation made by the Indian
representative in the Advisory Committee.
In June 1921, upon the motion of the re-
presentative of the Republic of China, Dr.
Wellington Koo, the Council of the League of
Nations resolved :
1 hat, in view of the world-wide interest
in the attitude of the League toward the
opium question, and of the general desire to
reduce and restrict the cultivation and pro-
duction of opium to strictly medicinal and
scientific purposes, the Advisory Committee
on Traffic in Opium be requested to consi-
der and report, at its next session, on the
possibility of instituting an enquiry to de-
termine approximately the average require-
ments of raw and prepared opium specified
in Chapters I and II of the [Hague] Con-
vention for medical and scientific purposes
in different countries.?
In view, then, of this resolution, proposed by
the representative of China more than three
years ago and adopted by the Council, and in
view of what I have just now had occasion to
say, the Chinese delegation to this Conference
declares that it supports the proposition that
this Conference is competent to discuss and act
upon the proposal contained in Article 1 of the
American programme, and is, therefore, pre-
pared to support the motion made by Mr.
Porter that this proposal be referred to the First
Committee .

discussion which we began this morning on the
question of referring the proposal submitted by
the United States delegation to the First Com-
mittee.
The Bolivian delegate will address the Confe-
rence.
M. Pinto-Escaiier (Bolivia)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gen-
tlemen The proposal of the honourable Ameri-
can delegate raises a question which, from my
Government?s point of view, cannot be allowed
to pass without comment, notwithstanding the
respect due to the ideal which inspires the pro-
posal an ideal to which I wish to pay a
sincere tribute.
Article 1 of the American delegation?s sugges-
tions appears, both as regards raw opium and
coca leaves, to take account only of medical
and scientific uses.
I think that I dwelt sufficiently in my first
statement to the Conference on the use to which
coca leaves are put by a large number of Boli-
vian natives without their acquiring a ?per-
nicious habit? which, if I rightly understand
the spirit of Article 14 of the American sugges-
tions, is taken to be one of the characteristics
of addiction to drugs. I think therefore that,
so far as coca leaves are concerned, experience
should be taken as a guide.
I may add that, judging by enquiries which
have been addressed to me by some of my
honourable colleagues, the question of the mas-
tication of coca leaf does not yet appear to be
sufficiently understood.
I do not want a problem to which my country
attaches such great importance to be settled
until all possible steps have been taken to
investigate it and to arrive at an equitable
solution.
For this reason, without raising the question
of the Conference's competence, I wish to make
the most express reservations, and I maintain my
Government?s point of view as set forth in my
previous statement.
The President
Translation : I call upon the Hon. Stephen
G. Porter, delegate of the United States of
America, to address the Conference.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) :
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen I shall
detain you but a moment because it seems to us
that we have gone far afield in this debate.
The question before the Conference is not
that of the merits of Article 1 nor is it a
question of amending the article. It is a very
simple question ; Will the Conference consider
the article ?
In this connection, I do not think it would be
out of place to read the motion which is now
pending ;
?On behalf of the delegation of the
United States of America, I hereby present
for consideration by the Conference Article
1 of the suggestions of the United States
of America, which reads as follows ;
?The Contracting Parties shall enact
effective laws or regulations for the control
of the production and distribution of raw
opium and coca leaves so that there will
be no surplus available for purposes not
strictly medical or scientific?.?
Then follows a limitation in regard to prepared
opium and we move that it be referred to the
First Committee for consideration. Tim only
question therefore before the Conference is the
question whether or not the Conference desires
to consider that phase of the matter. It may
not be out of place perhaps it will aid us
in reaching a sound conclusion to recite a
few .of the facts leading up to this situation.
Under the Covenant of the League of Nations
certain powers are delegated to the League in
reference to the traffic in opium and other dan-
gerous drugs, and the League is given power
in connection with the execution of the Hague
Opium Convention. In the discharge of that
duty, the League organised the Opium Advisory
Committee and many Sub-Committees. I am
only too happy to state that all of those organis-
ations connected with the League have earnestly
and sincerely attempted to find a solution for this
most perplexing problem. Many meetings were
held and many resolutions were passed. On June
sth, 1923, the Opium Advisory Committee,
after protracted meetings, adopted a resolution
which accepted the interpretation of the Hague
Opium Convention which was urged by the
United States of America.
The action of the Advisory Committee was
ratified by the Fifth Committee of the fourth


Assembly on September 23rd, 1923. It was
verified by the Assembly in October 1923,
and, the Assembly being in a sense the Court
of last resort, its action is really the only one
before us.
Then what followed ? There follows the
invitation to the Conference by the Council,
which says :
?The Council notes the adoption by the
Assembly of the report and resolutions of
the Advisory Committee on Traffic in
Opium and the resolutions of the fourth
Assembly. It instructs the Secretary-Gene-
ral to take all the action required by
these resolutions and decides that the First
Conference, consisting of countries having
possessions where the smoking of opium is
continued, should be convened at Geneva
on the first Monday in November 1924 and
the Second Conference in Geneva on the
third Monday in November 1924.?
What further does it say ? The special pur-
pose of the Second Conference is set forth in
Assembly Resolution VI. That Assembly
Resolution VI represents the final action of
the League of Nations upon this question,
and the Conference is called for the purpose of
considering well, many, perhaps, know it by
heart, but it would do no harm to read it
now. It says ;
?The Assembly?having noted with satis-
faction that, in accordance with the hope
expressed in the fourth resolution adopted
by the Assembly in 1922, the Advisory
Committee has reported that the informa-
tion now available makes it possible for the
Governments concerned to examine, with
a view to the conclusion of an agreement,
the question of the limitation of the amounts
of morphine, heroin or cocaine and their
respective salts to be manufactured ; of
the limitation of the amounts of raw
opium and the coca leaf to be imported
for that purpose and for other medical
and scientific purposes ; and of the limita-
tion of the production of raw opium and
the coca leaf for export to the amount
required for such medicinal and scientific
purposes requests the Council [and note
this language], as a means of giving
effect to the principles submitted by the
representatives of the United States of
America, and to the policy which the
League, on the recommendation of the
Advisory Committee, has adopted, to invite
the Governments concerned to send their
representatives with plenipotentiary powers
to a Conference for this purpose, to be
held, if possible, immediately after the
Conference mentioned in Resolution V.?
There is the call, and the basis of it is this
Assembly Resolution VI. It seems too plain
for argument that Resolution VI is the very
foundation of our work.
The distinguished delegate of the British
Empire referred to the fable of the dog and the
leg of mutton. In my humble judgment, the
leg of mutton in this Conference is this Resolu-
tion VI of the Assembly of the League of
Nations, and if we drop it there will be nothing
left to work with but the shadow.
It has been contended that, because the word
?export? appears in that resolution, our work is
therefore limited. At the first glance, it might
be subject to that construction, but after a care-
full examination of the resolution it will be
found that the words ?for export? do not con-
stitute a limitation ; they are merely descrip-
tive.
I might repeat what I said on Friday on that
question. Resolution VI specifically men-
tions that the Governments concerned may
examine, with a view to the conclusion of an
agreement : ( a ) the question of the limitation of
the amount of morphine, heroin, or cocaine, and
their respective salts, to be manufactured ;
[h) the limitation of the amounts of raw opium
and the coca leaf to be imported for that pur-
pose and for other medicinal and scientific pur-
poses ; (c) the limitation of the production of
raw opium and the coca leaf for export to the
amount required for such medicinal and scien-
tific purposes. It will be noted, however, that
these questions are to be considered as a means
of giving effect to the principles submitted by
the representatives of the United States and to
the policy which the League, on the recom-
mendation of the Advisory Committee, has
adopted.
Is any argument necessary in order to estab-
lish the fact that the questions referred to
in Resolution VI are merely mentioned by way
of description and not of limitation, or, as the
President of the Conference pointed out in his
opening address with regard to the adoption
of the agenda, as merely a starting point or
basis for discussion ? The proposal that a
Conference composed of representatives with
full plenipotentiary powers, called to consider
measures to be adopted as a means of giving
effect to the United States proposals, does not
possess the power to examine any question pre-
sented which is germane to the general subject
under discussion appears to be untenable.
Every Government here represented was aware
of the purpose for which the Conference was
called, and it is to be presumed that each dele-
gate received instructions co-extensive with the
terms of the invitation received and accepted.
In other words, the League of Nations, after
four or five years of patient study and indus-
trious work, called this Conference and asked
us to consider Assembly Resolution VI. There
are some things which are too plain for argu-
ment, but I might reply with a question ; If
we are not here to consider this resolution, for
what purpose are we here ? It is the vital
part of the whole matter. So much for that.
I consider, Mr. President, that the matter has
already been decided by the Conference.
I desire to make it clear that the Government
of the United States is not the only one which
interpreted the invitation received from the
League to mean that proposals for the limita-
tion of the world production of opium and
narcotics to the medicinal and scientific needs
of the world might properly be considered by
the present Conference.
I refer you to the following proposal
presented by the Cuban Government ;
?Make following proposal regarding prac-
tical measures for limiting use narcotics
and preventing abuse : World production
of opium and narcotics should be exactly
proportionate to requirements of each
country for medical and scientific purposes
estimated on a bona-fide basis.?


Turning to the second report of the Business
Committee (Annex 17), we find that the Business
Committee also took cognisance of a number
of other proposals. The Cuban proposal was
referred to the First Committee. This proposal,
providing that the world production of opium
and narcotics should be exactly proportionate
to the requirements of each country for medical
and scientific purposes estimated on a bona-
fuie basis, does not differ, in principle, from the
proposal which the delegation of the United
States has presented.
The Indian delegation did not see fit to object
on the grounds of competence to the considera-
tion of the proposal presented by Cuba, which
was referred by the First Committee to Sub-
Committee B for discussion. The delegation
of the United States is therefore at a loss to
understand why the Indian delegation is using
every means at its disposal to prevent the consi-
deration of our proposal, when, as a matter of
fact, a proposal of a similar nature has properly
been referred to Sub-Committee B, where it
will be considered upon its merits.
As I say, there has been a great deal of debate
that is not germane to the matter before the
Conference. The distinguished delegate of the
British Empire presented a very interesting
argument, but if you will reflect on it you will
find that it refers to the merits of the case;
we are not considering its merits at the
present time. He asked me what should be
done in the case of India. Well, I was over
here last May for a month and I was back again
last October for two or three weeks, and I
know that on every possible occasion, both
publicly and privately, I stated that the United
States had no desire whatever to interfere
with the internal affairs of India or any other
country. We have nothing to suggest to
India. It is India?s problem ; it is not ours.
I do hope that that man-of-straw will be finished
with to-day, because if I had the power I
would like to take it and bury it in the deepest
hole in Lake Geneva.
We have not the least intention and I
desire to impress this upon all the delegates
of interfering in any manner, shape or form
with the internal affairs of any country. We are
merely here with a proposal that seems to
meet with the approval of the majority of the
delegates, a proposal that we hope will solve
this great problem.
I might go further and refer to Persia. I
am quite sympathetic with Persia as regards her
present position. She is producing enormous
quantities of opium ; her revenues are low,
partly as a result of the restrictions which have
been placed upon her sovereignty. There is
no reason why this Conference cannot reach an
agreement and allow these three or four or
five nations that do not feel now that they can
agree with the principle laid down by the
League of Nations to make reservations. We
can then all be good and neighbourly and try
and help them solve their problems.
I do not know that I have anything further
to say on the matter except to repeat that the
problem before us is this : Are we going to
consider the resolution of the League of Nations,
which represents the earnest and sincere work
of, I might say, hundreds of men and women
during the last three or four years, or are we
going to discard it and say that it is unworkable
or useless ?
I believe this debate is drawing to a close,
and I desire at the end of the debate to have a
roll-call. I make this request for two reasons.
I want to put the Government of the United
States on record as being in favour of this
resolution. Moreover, I do not feel that it
would be quite right to discard it in the manner
which is now being attempted.
Let me conclude. Much has been said about
the internal affairs of India, the internal affairs
of Peru, and Bolivia, and other countries. We
have no desire to interfere with them at all.
The only ambition we have, or rather the hope
we have, and it is a sincere and earnest hope,
is that we will be in some way helpful to those
people in solving their great problems. {Applause.)
The President
Translation : I call upon Prince Arfa-ed-
Dowleh, delegate of Persia, to address the Con-
ference.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia)
Translation : Mr. President, I desire to
thank the United States delegate most warmly
for his cordial remarks in regard to Persia.
In my speeches, in my letters and in my state-
ments to the Sub-Committees I have already
explained several times my Government?s view
on the question with which we are dealing.
In fact, we declared in our memorandum that
Persia was absolutely in agreement with the
proposal of the United States.
But we think that the discussion which has
now lasted for a fortnight ought to come to
an end, for it is being asked what we have done
during that time. I think my colleagues will
agree that the time has come to take a decision
and to continue the discussion on the United
States proposal in order that the producing
countries may know where they stand.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba) ;
Translation : I must apologise for occupying
your attention for a few minutes, but I feel
compelled to say a few words in reply to
Mr. Porter.
I think that the question of competence is
clearly before this plenary Conference ; we are
not concerned with anything else. I will not
go back and examine the history of the events
which led up to the sixth resolution of the
1923 Assembly, nor will I revert to the invita-
tion addressed to the States Members of the
League or signatories of the Hague Conven-
tion of 1912. These events are known to all
of us. You have had time to form your own
opinion and, if the reading of the documents is
not enough, you have had the brilliant speeches
of this Conference to help you.
Allow me to say that the question appears
to me to present two aspects : (1) constitutio-
nal ; (2) moral.
From the constitutional point of view, I do
not think there can be any doubt, if we consider
the question calmly. The States represented
at the Conference were invited by the Council
of the League of Nations. Why did the Council
invite them ? In virtue of the sixth resolu-
tion of the Assembly of 1923, which contains
the following words : ?Requests the Council,
as a means of giving effect to the principles
submitted by the representatives of the United
States of America and to the policy which the
League, on the recommendation of the Advisory


Committee, has adopted, to invite the Govern-
ments concerned to send representatives with
plenipotentiary powers to a Conference to be
held for this purpose,'? etc.
Accordingly, the invitation was sent in con-
formity with the principles established by the
Assembly of the League of Nations. The pro-
posals of the United States have long been known
to us, and are therefore in no sense a revelation
to us. In adopting the above-mentioned reso-
lution, the Assembly acted with a full knowledge
of the facts. The Assembly is the supreme
authority. There is, however, one other autho-
rity in the League of Nations which might
modify a resolution taken by the Assembly :
that authority is the Council. This latter
authority, however, would not do so, since it
is an established rule that a question which has
been dealt with by the Assembly shall not be
examined by the Council and vice versa. We
have therefore to refer to the sixth resolution
of the Assembly.
We were told that the Preparatory Committee
had drawn up a programme for the Conference.
This is not so, gentlemen. It only provided
us with a basis for our discussions.
I can give you a number of facts which will
certainly be corroborated by several members
here present and by the Secretary-General
himself. An agenda is drawn up for the As-
sembly ; it is transmitted to the Governments
of the Members of the League, but the drafting
of this agenda does not fix its limits. Every
country concerned has the right to submit a
proposal bearing upon the subjects included
in this agenda. Such proposal is simply re-
ferred to the Agenda Committee, which submits it
to the Assembly; the latter then transmits it
to the Committee entrusted with the examina-
tion of such questions. That is the procedure
at the Assemblies of the League.
As regards our own Conference, I can give
you a similar precedent. On Friday we referred
Article q-A of the American proposals to the
First Committee of our Conference. Now, the
proposal contained in Article q-A was not
included in the agenda submitted to you, nor in
the sixth resolution of the Assembly, for the
reason that this article dealt with the question
of the manufacture of heroin, whereas Resolu-
tion VI only mentions limiting the production
of morphine, cocaine, heroin, etc.
Once we have admitted that a delegation may
make proposals regarding the suppression of
the manufacture of heroin, and once we have
adopted them, as we do by allowing them to
be referred to the First Committee, how can we
object to a question which has been included in
a resolution adopted by the Assembly, and how
can we even discuss the competence of the
Assembly ?
I cannot admit such a thing.
After deep reflection, after examining all that
has been said at the present Conference and
after analysing Resolution VI of the Assem-
bly, I am of opinion that we are competent to
examine the proposals of the United States.
I will put yet another point to you. I do
not think that all the Governments have under-
stood the invitation which was sent to them.
It is not a fixed programme that we have to
discuss. As I said just now, the Preparatory
Committee has only furnished us with a basis
for subsequent discussion. Accordingly, we have
the right to discuss and the right to speak and
it is our duty from the constitutional point
of view to recognise the competence of the
Assembly.
1 will now turn to the moral aspect of the
problem. Is this Conference bound by inflex-
ible rules ? Are we enclosed in such a tight
casing of steel-plate armour that we cannot
escape from it ?
I cannot accept the idea of a plenary Confe-
rence, consisting of plenipotentiaries from all
countries in the world interested in the campaign
against the drug habit, the members of which
are not at liberty to express their opinions.
What is the League of Nations ? It is a
collection of States which, by close international
co-operation, are seeking to promote the moral
and material welfare of humanity.
Granted, then, that the Members present at
this Conference are here to further the well-
being of humanity, can they be denied the
liberty to express their opinions ? I should
understand it if they were making proposals
which were not in accordance with the object
of this Conference, for example, a proposal
relating to river transit.
But this is not the case. We are here in the
position of a man who desires to arrive at an
agreement with another and who is prevented
from speaking. I have the greatest respect
for the observations made by the honourable
delegates for India and the Netherlands ;
but between material and moral considerations,
I can have no hesitation and I strongly sup-
port those arguments which are based on the
moral welfare of humanity.
I would also like to say that we cannot remain
within the narrow limits of the powers con-
ferred upon us by our Governments. There are
occasions when it is necessary to expand these
limits. I will give you an example. At one of
the Assemblies of the League of Nations I had
received exceedingly strict instructions from
my Government in regard to the questions of
interest to my country which were to be dis-
cussed. During the deliberations, however, I
found that the instructions which I had received,
and to which, in the normal course of events,
I had to conform, might, when it came to the
vote, lead to a negative result, the future conse-
quences of which would have been very serious.
I telegraphed to my Government, fully explain-
ing the situation. When it understood the
gravity of the case, my Government imme-
diately sent me the necessary full powers.
I will leave it to the delegations from India
and the Netherlands to estimate the value of
this example, but I do not propose to make any
suggestion. I will venture, however, to observe
that, if we do not achieve the results expected
of us, profound moral disillusionment will be
spread among all the States Members of the
League of Nations.
I will conclude by quoting to you the case
of Themistocles, the Greek general. Once, when
he was arguing with the commander-in-chief
of the Athenian forces, the Spartan Eurybiades,
at a council of war, he stopped the latter with
the famous words, ?Strike me, but listen to
me.? Reversing this phrase, I will say, ?Listen
and then strike.? (Prolonged applause.)
The President
Translation : I call upon Mr. Campbell,
delegate of India, to address the Conference.


Mr. Campbell (India)
I do not propose to occupy the time of the
Conference for long. As the delegate of the
United States and the delegate of Cuba have
said, the only question before the Conference
at the present time is that of competence.
On that question the Indian delegation has
already stated its position very fully, and the
whole ground has been very faithfully covered
in the course of the debate. There are only a
few points which have arisen in that connection
regarding which I desire to make some remarks.
The first is the statement made by Mr. Porter,
that the American interpretation of the mean-
ing of the Hague Convention has been accepted
by the Advisory Committee, by the Fifth
Committee of the Assembly, and by the As-
sembly itself. Not in any controversial spirit,
but simply in order to prevent any possibility
of a misunderstanding on this subject, I desire
to say that I cannot admit that statement.
At the Advisory Committee, the American inter-
pretation of the Hague Convention was ac-
cepted by no nation except China. The reser-
vations made by all the Governments appear
in the resolution of the Advisory Committee,
and were duly noted by the Assembly.
The second point refers to the argument that,
in not taking exception when the proposal of
the Government of Cuba was referred to a
Committee, we were, if I may use a legal
term, estopped from further argument that
we were prevented, in fact, from raising our
point.
I think it is within the recollection of everyone
here that India?s position was fully covered by
formal reserves made not only in the plenary
Conference but also before the Business Comm-
ittee. Indeed, I made the reserves on so many
occasions that I think quite possibly some of my
colleagues began to regard me as a nuisance.
Another argument of a similar kind has been
put forward by the delegate of the United States
of America and by the delegate of Japan. It
was suggested that the discussion on the heroin
proposal (Article g-A of the American draft)
raised the question of competence, and that
India should have spoken on the question at
that time.
I hope all the delegates will appreciate the
great sense of restraint shown by the delegation
of the Government of India in not speaking on
the subject at that time. Our point of view
was that the question of competence was not
directly and immediately at issue at that mo-
ment. As the members of the Conference know,
the agenda of the Conference has, as one of its
items, a discussion of the proposal to limit
the use of heroin, and it seemed to us that limi-
tation might go as far as prohibition. Ihe point
is, I think, a perfectly valid one, and was pre-
sent not only in our mind but in the minds of
other delegations also.
There is one further point which I desire to
make clear. The Indian delegation has, of
course, no objection to a vote by roll-call being
taken, if the object of that roll-call is to ascer-
tain the opinions of the delegates here present
on the question now before the Conference.
If there is some other object, however if the
suggestion is that the result of that roll-call
should be taken as deciding the question of com-
petence then you, Mr. President, will recol-
lect that such was not the position taken up
by the Indian delegation. We consider that,
for the purpose of this Conference, that question
can be decided by you, Sir, and by you alone.
There is also another point I should like to
make clear. The delegate of Cuba suggested that
it would be quite possible for the Indian delega-
tion to obtain quickly the views of its Govern-
ment regarding this proposal Article i.
The political position in India is rather compli-
cated ; in some respects it approaches fairly
closely to the federal position in America. We
have, I shduld think, at least ten Governments
which now have power to deal with the question
of the domestic use of opium. The Secretary
of State does not deal with it ; the Government
of India does not deal with it. It is dealt with
by the local Governments, and there is only
one local Government in India where the
domestic consumption of opium remains under
the direct control of the Central Government.
I should like the Conference to appreciate
the point that, before instructions on this
subject could reach me, it would be necessary
for the Secretary of State to communicate with
the Government of India, and it would be
necessary for the Government of India to com-
municate with ten (I am not quite certain of the
figure, but I think it is ten) local Governments
scattered over a country as large, I think, as
Europe.
One last point. I have already stated that
the question under discussion is the question
of competence, and that question only ; but, as I
think the Hon. Mr. Porter said, the discussion
has in fact ranged over a very wide field.
Some of the remarks made regarding India
were remarks to which I should very much like
to reply, but, again acting under that same
sense of restraint, I do not propose to do so.
There is only one point I should like to make
clear. It was suggested, in the course of the
discussions, that the Government of India had
some desire to avoid and to stifle discussion on
this question. It was even suggested by one
delegate that it feared discussion. I want to
state, in the most emphatic manner possible,
that that is not so.
Those delegates who have been present at
the various Assemblies of the League will, I
think, bear me out when I say that India has
never shown the least inclination to avoid the
discussion of this subject ; she most certainly
has never feared the discussion of it. Lord
Chelmsford has spoken on it at length, both in
Committee and in the full Assembly. Lord
Hardinge has spoken on the subject twice.
His Highness the Jam Saheb of Nawanagar
has spoken on it. Mr. Hasan Imam has spoken
on it. Other Indian delegates have also spoken
on it, and, lest any doubt should remain, I
would like to call the attention of the Confe-
rence to the fact that they have before them the
Minutes of the Fifth Session of the Advisory
Committee, which consist of 214 printed fools-
cap pages, most of which relate to the position
in India.
The President
Translation : There are no more speakers
on my list. Does anyone else wish to speak ?
I call upon M. Ferreira, delegate of Portugal, to
speak.
M. Ferreira (Portugal) :
Translation: The Portuguese delegation feels
bound to endorse the declarations made by


Sir Malcolm Delevingne at the fifth session of opinion of the United States delegation, there
the Advisory Committee and repeated by the
British delegate this morning. These decla-
rations will be found in the Minutes of the Fifth
Session of the Advisory Committee (Docu-
ment C. 418. M. 184. 1923. XI, page 84) :
?There was one other difficulty which
at first also seemed to be serious. There
was some discussion, on one of the early
days of the present session of the Committee,
on the use of opium in India and other
Oriental countries, not for smoking, but
for what has been described here and at
meetings of the Assembly as semi-medicinal
purposes. There has been a great deal of
misunderstanding about the attitude of
the League on the subject. I think there
has been especially a great deal of misun-
derstanding in the United States on the
subject ; but in the conversations which
I have had with Mr. Porter, and to which
I think I may fairly refer, he has made it
quite clear to me that it is not the intention
of the American delegation or of the Ame-
rican Government to dictate or interfere
in any way with what the Indian Govern-
ment or any other Government similarly
situated may regard as a proper semi-
medicinal use of the drugs in countries
where conditions such as that exist. The
American problem, as we all know, is a
problem in the main almost entirely, one
might say of the production of opium
and the coca leaf for the manufacture of
the drugs to which Part 111 of the Conven-
tion applies.??
The prevention of the abuse of narcotics
must, in our opinion, be the great purpose of
our Conference. If we are animated by this
ideal, we will succeed in finding effective means
of action. Otherwise we run a serious danger ;
we might come to an agreement which w r ould
be signed by the majority of the countries repre-
sented, but which would only be signed subject
to reservations by the countries directly inte-
rested, and the whole Convention would thus
be rendered useless.
The President
Translation : There are no more speakers
on the list. If no one else wishes to address
the Conference, I will endeavour to summarise
the various points of the discussion.
The United States delegation has submitted
to this Conference a series of proposals con-
cerning the subject with which we are dealing.
These proposals were referred by the Confe-
rence to the Business Committee ; the latter
reserved its decision in regard to certain proposals
but submitted to you a plan for the allocation
of the work a plan which you adopted.
Subsequently, the United States delegation sub-
mitted two of the proposals in regard to which
the decision had been reserved, asking that they
should be sent to the First Committee. The
first proposal has been referred to the First
Committee without opposition ; it concerns
Article 9-A of the series of American suggestions.
It is the second of these proposals, that which
refers to Article 1 of the series, which is now
before the Conference, and the request has been
made that it should be sent for discussion to
the First Committee.
This request is based on the fact that, in the
cannot be the slightest doubt that discussion
of a Conventional clause, such as Article 1 of
the American proposal, is within the competence
of the Second International Conference on
Opium.
The Indian delegation has opposed the Ame-
rican delegation?s point of view. It bases its
opposition to referring this concrete proposal
to one of the Committees on the fact that at
least part of the provisions contained in the
above-mentioned article are not within the com-
petence of this Conference as defined in its
agenda. With a view to settling this point,
which it considers to be doubtful, the Indian
delegation has appealed, in the last instance, to
the President of the Conference as being alone
empowered to decide the question of competence.
I will not go in detail into the question of the
Conference?s procedure of simply adopting the
agenda without discussion, for reasons which I
shall state presently.
Other delegations have to-day expressed their
views on this subject. I will summarise them
as briefly as possible.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne, first British delegate,
has given us a very clear statement. He first
of all considered the principle of widening the
range of subjects which this Conference may
have to consider. He was rather inclined to
think that the scope of the Conference could
not thus be enlarged without the permission
of the Council, and possibly that of the various
Governments which have accepted the Council?s
invitation to this Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne then proceeded to
consider wdiether the discussion of the proposal
before us would, in his opinion, constitute
such an extension. Pie preferred not to enter
into details regarding the principle of the
Conference?s competence. He said that, if
we wished strictly to follow the lines laid
down in the American proposal, we should run
the risk of interfering in matters which were
exclusively within the domestic competence of
the various sovereign States.
That would be the case, for instance, if w r e
decided to discuss here the semi-medicinal use
of opium and coca leaves in India, Bolivia and
Peru. He asked whether the United States
delegation understood these to be questions
which the Conference could discuss.
If, on the contrary, the American delegation
only took into consideration the surplus produc-
tion used for purposes which were not strictly
medical or scientific, he stated that certain
delegations would have to make reservations
and reservations were always a source of weak-
ness. He added that we should run the risk
of becoming involved in a discussion which
might compromise the results of our work. In
this connection he quoted the fable of the dog
with the leg of mutton in its mouth and which,
seeing its reflection in the water arid thinking
that the piece of meat in the reflection was big-
ger, dropped its own piece. I shall come back
to Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s dog later.
M. van Wettum, first delegate of the Nether-
lands, supported Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s view
and said that his Government had not under-
stood the invitation to the Conference in the
same light as the Government of the United
States of America, and that, consequently, he
had no instructions which would enable him
to deal with this category of questions.


M. Sugimura, first Japanese delegate, laid
special emphasis on the necessity of treating the
question as a whole and on the danger of
leaving gaps. He was inclined to think that
it would be better to leave a certain elasticity,
which would allow of the discussion of the article
of the American draft which we have before us.
M. Chodzko, the first delegate of Poland,
saw in the official title of this Conference," The
International Opium Conference", an argument
against the Indian delegation?s point of view
and in favour of enlarging the sphere of our
activities. Moreover, recapitulating the pre-
paratory work of this Conference, he pointed
out that the various Committees which had
been endeavouring to draw up a plan of work
had not succeeded in their task. The com-
petence of the Conference was therefore unlimi-
ted. He also found arguments in support of
his opinion in an interpretation of Resolution
VI of the fourth Assembly, and particularly in
the fact that this resolution mentions the prin-
ciples laid down by the delegates of the United
States of America. He drew the same conclu-
sion from Document A. 32, which contains all
the measures drawn up by the Advisory Com-
mittee.
The first delegate of China, M. Sze, agreed
with the point of view of the United States
delegation regarding the question of competence.
The Polish delegate, the Chinese delegate,
and, I think, the Japanese delegate also, were
in favour of the plenary Conference deciding
to refer the United States proposal concerning
Article 1 of the American scheme to the First
Committee.
This afternoon we have also heard several
speakers. The first delegate of Bolivia made
a reservation concerning coca leaves based on
the same considerations as the reservation
made by the Netherlands delegation. We then
heard Mr. Porter, delegate of the United States
of America, the first delegate of Persia, the first
delegate of Cuba and of Portugal, and Mr.
Campbell. Their arguments are so fresh in our
memory that I eed not recapitulate them.
Further, in order to explain its point of view
regarding the question of competence, the Indian
delegation submitted to the Conference at
Friday?s meeting a detailed account of the
various phases of the work preparatory to the
Convention and the opening of this Conference.
Most of the delegates here present will, I think,
find the arguments brought forward in this
connection too difficult to follow and to esti-
mate, since they have not had cognisance of
the facts adduced.
In view of what has occurred subsequently, I
am also inclined to think that the value of the
arguments as regards the question of prin-
ciple is of secondary importance at the pre-
sent juncture.
You are here, gentlemen, as official represen-
tatives of your Governments. They sent
you to Geneva in compliance with an invitation
from the League of Nations. As far as the aims
of this Conference are concerned, your Govern-
ments based their acceptance on the text of
the letter of invitation and its annexes. On
the basis of this text they sent you to this
Conference, gave you instructions, and, in some
cases, entrusted you with definite proposals.
These instructions and proposals are the result
of the conception which your Governments have
ormed of the scope of the various problems t
be dealt with and, if possible, solved by us here.
Accordingly I think it is quite clear that the
question of competence involved in the simple
request that the proposal before us should be
referred to a Committee can only be properly
decided by the representatives of these Govern-
ments, that is to say, by a majority vote of
this Conference.
If it is of any interest to you to hear my opinion
on this one question of competence which we
have before us to-day, I will tell you what it is.
I think that the discussion of Article i of the
American scheme is within the competence of
this Conference as defined in the- agenda. I will,
if you desire, state my reasons for this point of
view. I am not sure, however, whether, in giving
these reasons, I am not exceeding my presi-
dential powers. Consequently I will wait until
the Conference definitely asks me to state my
reasons.
As you will perhaps have observed, I have par-
ticularly emphasised the words "the discussion
of Article 1?. I have done so because each of
the delegations, acting in conformity with the
instructions given by its Government, is, of
course, entirely and beyond all doubt, free to
refrain from participating in any particular dis-
cussion, and to state or refrain from stating its
reasons for so doing, to reserve its Government?s
point of view regarding the trend or conclusions
of such a discussion, or even to state in advance
that its Government can never accept or even
consider any proposals which may be made as
a result of such discussion. In so doing, it
will not in any way lay itself open to criticism
on the part of the other delegations.
If, in these circumstances, the Conference or
one of the Committees considers it advisable
to open or continue a discussion on a proposal
of this kind, the point will have to be decided
by the Conference or the Committee in question.
Cases might also arise in which a discussion,
even if it were entirely one-sided, might throw
light on certain problems. In other cases, dis-
cussion without the participation of the other
party would doubtless be a waste of time. No
member of any delegation here present has the
intention of interfering in questions which are
matters of purely domestic jurisdiction.
I now come back to the "dog" of the fable
quoted by Sir Malcolm Delevingne, but I pro-
pose to give the story another moral : I think
we can rely on the wisdom and experience of
the delegates to choose the best and most equit-
able line of conduct.
Before concluding, I will venture, with all due
deference, to make a respectful but earnest
appeal to the Conference.
You are here in order to further the solution
of a question which is of vital importance to
mankind. You are aware that no result can
be obtained without international collaboration.
We all know, however, that international colla-
boration invariably entails sacrifices. Let us
make these sacrifices, which are bound in any
case to be insignificant in comparison with the
noble object which I know you are all, without
exception, seeking to attain. (Prolonged applause.)
We will now proceed to the vote on the refe-
rence of the American proposal to the First
Committee.
I would like to make it quite clear that this
vote is being taken solely on the question
whether the proposal in Secretariat Document
0 No. 47 should be referred to the Committee.


The vote was taken by roll-call.
In favour: Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile
China, Cuba, Danzig, Denmark, Dominican Re-
public, Egypt, Finland, Germany, Hungary
Irish Free State, Italy, Japan, Luxemburg
Persia, Poland, Siam, Spain, Sweden, Switzer
land, United States of America, Uruguay
Venezuela.
Total ; 26.
Against : India.
Total : 1.
Abstentions : Australia, Bolivia, British
Empire, France, Greece, Netherlands, Portugal,
Serb-Croat-Slovene Kingdom, Turkey.
Total : 9.
[VI. von Eckardt (Germany) :
Translation : We decide to vote in favour
of referring the American proposal to the pro-
per Committee in view of our distinguished
President?s appeal.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : We are voting in favour for
the same reasons as the delegate of Germany.
The President :
Translation : The statements of the German
and Spanish delegates will be entered in the
record of the present meeting.
The reference of the American proposal to
the First Committee was therefore carried. [Ap-
plause.)
The President:
Translation : Mr. Campbell has a formal
declaration to make on behalf of his Government.
Mr. Campbell (India)
I have received formal instructions from my
Government regarding a certain reserve which
it wishes to make. I wish to make that reserve
now.
There is also a request which I wish to make
regarding the postponement of the discussion
of this question until we can receive instruc-
tions from our Government.
The President
Translation : You can communicate your
Government?s reserve now.
IVIr. Campbell (India)
I have received formal instructions to reserve
the right of the Government of India to raise
this question the question which has just
been decided before the Assembly of the
League of Nations. I request that that formal
reserve may be taken note of and entered in
the proceedings of the Conference.
The second point regarding which I desire to
speak is to make the request that, if possible,
the discussion of Article 1 of the American pro-
posals may be postponed, as far as that is con-
sistent with the work of the Conference, to as
late a date as possible. I have explained the
difficulties which will arise in obtaining instruc-
tions from India on this subject. I have also
explained that I have at present no instructions
on the subject. In these circumstances, if the
Conference desires that the question should be
fully discussed, I think everyone will agree
that it would be desirable to postpone the discus-
sion to as late a date as possible in order to
enable the Indian delegation to receive instruc-
tions from its Government.
The President
Translation : As regards the first part of
the statement of the honourable delegate for
India, we will accede to his request, and his
reserve shall be noted in the record of the pre-
sent meeting.
As regards the second request which he has
made, I venture to point out that there would
seem to be some difficulty in discussing the ques-
tion here. As the reference of the American
proposal has been adopted, the proposal itself
will naturally be discussed in the First Committee,
and, consequently, the request of the honour-
able delegate for India will be examined in this
Committee, which I think although I do not
wish to prophesy will see the force of the
considerations on which Mr. Campbell?s request
is based.

40. WELCOME TO THE CHILIAN DELE-
GATE : LETTER OF THANKS TO THE
PRESIDENT.
The President
Translation : Before beginning the discus-
sion of our agenda, I have the honour to inform
the members of the Conference, in accordance
with our Rules of Procedure, that I have just
received the following letter fiom the Chilian
delegate, in which he expresses his regret at
not being able before to thank the Conference
for the welcome extended to him :
[' Translation ]
?I was prevented by my recent illness
from thanking the President and the Con-
ference at the last meeting for their cor-
dial welcome. I wish to thank you all
now.
?The same reason prevented me from
taking part earlier in the work of the Con-
ference. I should not, however, have been
satisfied if I had failed to contribute
what help I could ; nor could I haye
allowed my country to be behindhand in
lending its aid to further the efforts now
being made for the suppression of the
evils caused by dangerous drugs.
?The humanitarian principles inspiring
the delegates to this Conference are a
guarantee of its success. There can be
no doubt as to the outcome of the Confe-
rence, which has met after many difficulties
and at which there are delegates of 39 coun-
tries, who have travelled far and made
great sacrifices in order to be present.
?The question of the competence of the
Conference has been discussed. The coun-
tries represented here knew beforehand
that the Conference had been convened to
give practical effect to the humanitarian
ideals of the League of Nations, ideals to
which the League in reality owes its
existence. The delegates have made great
sacrifices in order to come to Geneva, and
I think that we have come with full powers
to discuss all questions relating to the
restriction, or rather the suppression, os
the evils caused by the abuse of dangerouf
drugs, evils which are at the same time
a peril and a disgrace to civilisation.
?I have used mild words to brand, in a
century which will go down to history
as the century of the League of Nations
rather than the century of the Great War,
the traffic in dangerous drugs, which is at
present destroying a large section of huma-
nity, and this simply because there are
men who desire to make great profits from
the trade. There could be no more shame-
ful form of selfishness.
?It is obvious that if this illicit traffic
is suppressed, many material interests must
suffer. I do not~ call them respectable
interests, great though they are, for inte-
rests by which such havoc is wrought and
which lead to physical and racial degene-
ration, madness and crime have no claim
to be so called.
?We must bear in mind, as the President
has so happily phrased it, that it is impos-
sible to do good without making sacrifices ;
but we must submit to these sacrifices,
which will ennoble us and mankind alike.
41. THE QUESTION OF THE COMPETENCE
OF THE CONFERENCE : RESERVATION
MADE BY THE INDIAN DELEGATION.
The President
Translation : A few days ago I received
the following letter from the Indian delegation :
?With a view to facilitate the work of
the Conference, while guarding at the same
time the position of the Indian delegation,
we desire, if you see no objection, that a
protest be recorded in the proceedings
of the Conference, on the part of the Indian
delegation, against the Conference discus-
sing any question not specifically covered
by the terms of the Conference?s accepted
agenda.
?We exclude from this general protest
Article I of the scheme presented by the
American delegation, as our attitude on
that point has already been fully explain-
ed to the Conference. A decision has been
taken on that subject, and the Government
of India has formally reserved its right
to raise the question in the Assembly. It
is, of course, understood that the Indian
delegation reserves the right to speak on
the question of competence in any par-
ticular case when the circumstances appear
to it to render this desirable, and that
the right of the Government of India to
raise the whole question in the Assembly
is reserved.
(Signed ) I. Campbell.
H. Clayton.'


Translation : This letter will be inserted in
the record of the meeting. I consider it
as a general reservation.
As regards the question of competence, I
think there need be no discussion, as everyone
knows the interpretation to be placed upon
this letter from that point of view. We must
take care, whenever a question of this sort
arises, that it is not followed by a long discus-
sion which may waste the time of the Confe-
rence. If any delegation, however, wishes
to speak, it is, of course, at liberty to do so.
If no one wishes to speak, we will pass to
our agenda.
42. MODIFICATION OF THE FIRST REPORT
OF THE BUSINESS COMMITTEE.
The President
Translation : You have before you the
following amendment to the first report of
the Business Committee which I wish to pro-
pose :
?The Sub-Committees will report direct
to the Full Conference?.
Before inviting a discussion on this proposal,
I should like to make a few remarks. When
adopting the first report of the Business Com-
mittee, you decided to set up two main Com-
mittees. The latter in their turn have set up
Sub-Committees. The First Committee has
appointed five Sub-Committees and the Second
Committee only one up to the present.
According to the Rules of Procedure which
you have adopted, the Sub-Committees? reports
should be submitted and their proceedings
communicated to the principal Committee.
The principal Committee then reports to the
full Conference. You have decided that repre-
sentatives of all the various delegations should
sit on the Committees. It may be taken, there-
fore, that the latter practically amount to
plenary meetings of the Conference. In order
to do away with the formality of discussions
on questions of principle, I have ventured to
submit the above proposal.
If, in future, the Sub-Committees report
directly to the full Conference, we may regard
the two Committees as no longer in existence.
This would enable us to expedite our work.
This system would in reality be more practical
and would admit of the discussion at plenary
meetings of questions hitherto kept in the
hands of the Second Committee. You will
see on the agenda that I have submitted three
questions which were to have been discussed
in the First and Second Committees. I have
marked these questions (1) and (2) to show
which Committee would have had to deal
with them. If you agree to my proposal, I
shall continue to adopt this system.
My proposal has already been accepted by the
Business Committee. If you adopt it, there
will be no further meetings of the Committees
but only plenary meetings of the Conference,
and the Sub-Committees? reports, which I hope
to receive in the course of this week, can be
discussed directly by the full Conference.
Does anyone wish to speak on this point ?
Translation : I agree in principle with your
proposal, as I did when it came before the
Business Committee, that the Sub-Committees
should in future report direct to the plenary
Conference.
I should like, however, to make one remark.
You will remember that, of the questions refer-
red by the plenary Conference to the Second
Committee which is now to disappear
some have not yet been referred by the latter
to any Sub-Committee, and among these there
is in particular the question relating to Item 4
on our agenda (proposals of the United States
delegation : Articles 10, n, 20 and 20-F.)
When these subjects come up for consideration,
the point may arise as to whether it is desirable
that they should be examined and discussed
direct by the plenary Conference. If the latter
decided not to discuss them but to wait for
a proposal or a report to be submitted to it,
I think it should be understood that the ple-
nary Conference would be competent as
the Committees previously were to refer
the report or proposal to the existing Sub-
Committees, or even to set up new Sub-Com-
mittees for the purpose.
My observation is therefore merely intended
to make it possible for questions which are
now before the two principal Committees
to come, under the new system, before the
plenary Conference.
The President
Translation : I quite agree with the first
Swiss delegate?s interpretation of my proposal.
I wished to make it as short and concise as
possible, for I took it for granted that the
Conference would retain full liberty, under Rule
4 of our Rules of Procedure, to discuss any
questions at plenary meetings or to appoint
special Sub-Committees.
If no one wishes to speak on my proposal,
I shall regard it as adopted.
Adopted.
43. CO-ORDINATION OF THE WORK OF
SUB-COMMITTEES A, B, C, AND D AND
APPOINTMENT OF A DRAFTING COM-
MITTEE : PROPOSALS OF THE BRI-
TISH DELEGATION : APPOINTMENT
OF A SUB-COMMITTEE.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
Mr. President, perhaps it would be conve-
nient if the Conference would agree to deal
now with the motion which I have proposed and
which has been distributed to the delegates
this morning. This motion refers to the arrange-
ments to be made with regard to the work
of the Conference, and reads as follows ;
In order that the Conference may ter-
minate not later than the afternoon of
Saturday, December 20th, it is decided :
?1. That all Sub-Committees be asked
to finish their work and have their reports
ready at latest by the afternoon of Friday,
December 12th.
?2. That a joint meeting of representa-
tives of Sub-Committees A, B, C and D


be held on Saturday, December 13th, pletion of our work, and that we can only
for the purpose of co-ordinating the con-
clusions of these Sub-Committees and
presenting a joint report to the Plenary
Conference on Monday, December 15th.
?Sub-Committees A, B, and D shall each
nominate two members in addition to the
Chairman, and Sub-Committee Cone member
in addition to the Chairman, to represent
them at the meeting.
?3. That a Drafting Committee (Comite
de redaction) be appointed forthwith, consis-
ting of the President of the Conference
and five persons to be nominated by the
President, and that this Committee com-
mence its work as soon as the report of
any of the Sub-Committees has been appro-
ved by the Conference."
The President
Translation : I think that the proposal
can be submitted to the Conference now.
It has been distributed to the members in
accordance with the Rules of Procedure, and
there is no reason why it should not be dealt
with at once.
I call upon Sir Malcolm Delevingne to sub-
mit his proposal.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
Mr. President, I have brought forward this
motion as a matter of urgency, entirely on
my own responsibility, but I should not have
ventured to do so unless I had first consulted
you and ascertained that you saw no objection
to its being brought forward and considered
at this meeting.
I have brought the proposal forward for
two reasons. In the first place, it has seemed
to me that it would be a great convenience to
all the delegations to know when the woik
of the Conference is likely to be finished and
on what day they will be able to leave Geneva.
The second reason, however, is a much more
important one. I take it that most of the
delegations desire to return to their homes before
Christmas, and if that happy result is to be
secured, the latest date to which we can prolong
our work will, I suggest, be Saturday, Decem-
ber 20th. We have therefore exactly a
fortnight in which to conclude our work.
It goes without saying, I think, that, when
once we separate, it will not be possible, or at
any rate it will be extremely difficult, to re-
assemble this Conference, and we should there-
fore conclude our work before we leave. The
position in regard to our work seems to be
rather serious. We are starting on our fourth
week and we have not yet received any of the re-
ports of the Sub-Committees. There are five sta-
ges of work still to be covered. The Sub-Commit-
tees have to conclude their work. The results
of their work, or at any rate that of the first
four Sub-Committees, have to be co-ordinated
in some way before they can be presented to
the Conference. The reports on the work of
the Sub-Committees have to be considered in
plenary meeting. When that has been done
and the decisions of the Conference have been
taken on those reports, the Drafting Committee
will have to draw up the draft Convention ;
lastly, the draft Convention will have to be
considered in plenary meeting.
I think the Conference will agree that a
ortnight is not too long a time for the com-
complete it in that time if we keep to some sort
of time-table.
My motion consists of two parts : first,
that we should adopt a time-table, and, secondly,
that we should make arrangements this mor-
ning for the co-ordination of the results of
the work of the different Sub-Committees and
for the drafting, or preparing the draft of, the
Convention.
As regards the time-table of our work, my
suggestion would be that all the Sub-Committees
should be asked to finish their work and have
their reports ready at the latest by the after-
noon of Friday of this week, December 12th,
and that there should be a joint meeting of
the representatives of the first four Sub-Com-
mittees A, B, C and D on Saturday, December
13th, for the purpose of co-ordinating the con-
clusions of those Sub-Committees, and, if
possible, of presenting a joint report to the
plenary Conference on Monday, Decembre
15th.
If the plenary Conference meets on Monday
and possibly Tuesday of next week and finishes
the task of considering the reports of those
Sub-Committees, the Drafting Committee would
then have Wednesday and Thursday of next
week for completing the drafting of the Con-
vention. That would leave Friday and Satur-
day of next week for the final consideration
of the draft Convention and its signa-
ture.
It has seemed to me that, as regards the co-
ordination of the results of the work of the
Sub-Committees, the method which I have
suggested in my motion would be the best :
namely, that each of the four Sub-Committees
should appoint two representatives, in addi-
tion to their Chairman, to meet together for
the purpose of considering and co-ordinating
the results of their work and, if possible, pre-
senting a joint report.
I have not suggested the inclusion of Sub-
Committees E and F, because their work stands
rather apart and can be considered separately.
I hope that .Sub-Committee E will be in a posi-
tion to present its report about the middle of
this week and that the Conference will be able
to consider it at once. In order to save time, I
would suggest, though I have not inserted the
suggestion in my motion, that this joint meeting
of representatives of Sub-Committees A, B,
C and D to be held next Saturday should be
presided over by the Chairman of Sub-Com-
mittee A, the first delegate of Canada. I
think that I need say no more about the work
of co-ordination.
There remains the work of drafting, or the
preparation, of the draft Convention. This is
a matter which requires the services of persons
experienced in that kind of work. I have not
ventured therefore to make any suggestion
myself. It seemed to me that the best course
would be to ask the President to consider the
matter and nominate the members of the
Drafting Committee himself. I think this
motion, if adopted, ought to bring about the
result, which, I am sure, we all desire, of seeing
the end of our work and bringing it to a
successful conclusion. It is an expedient which
has been adopted in previous International
Conferences when the work has been getting
into arrears and it has been desired to finish
by a. definite date. I hope the members of the


Conference will excuse my having brought
forward the motion at such short notice, and
I hope that they will adopt it.
The President
Translation : Before inviting a discussion
on Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s proposals, I should
like to say that I myself am in favour of the
first two.
The first proposal calls upon the Sub-Com-
mittees to accelerate their work with a view
to concluding it on Friday, December 12th.
The second proposal deals with the appoint-
ment of a Committee of Co-ordination, consisting
of eleven members under the chairmanship
of the Chairman of Sub-Committee A.
For my own part, I recommend the adoption
of both these proposals.
I shall not express any opinion on the third
proposal, the purpose of which is to give me
certain powers, which I shall be quite ready
to accept if that is the wish of the Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s proposals are open
for discussion.
M. Sze, delegate of China, will address the
Conference.
IVI. Sze (China) :
Mr. President and members of the Confe-
rence, I have, in the time at my disposal, care-
fully examined the proposals submitted by the
British delegation to the Conference this mor-
ning. lam quite in agreement with Sir Malcolm
Delevingne that we should proceed with the
work as speedily as possible, and also that the
Conference should conclude its work with
fruitful results.
The President has pointed out that the
first of the British proposals is only an invitation
to the Sub-Committees to finish their work.
While I am as anxious as the British delegation
and other members of this Conference that
our work shall finish as speedily as possible,
I should also like to say, as I have said in another
place, that we should never sacrifice efficiency
for speed.
As I read the first proposal, it is something
more than an invitation to the Sub-Committees ;
it contains more or less a mandate, because it
reads that they should "have their reports ready
at latest by the afternoon of Friday, December
12th". The words "at latest" seem to me
to constitute a mandate. I propose, therefore,
with your permission, Mr. President' and gentle-
men, to move a slight amendment. I propose
to add in the first proposal, after the words
"to finish their work", the following words :
"as quickly as possible?, and substitute ?if
possible" for ?at latest?. While keeping in
view the wish of the British delegation, which
I think is excellent, we shall not, if my amend-
ments are adopted, be giving a mandate to the
Sub-Committees.
I am only attending one Sub-Committee
and have a half-membership in another, and
I do not exactly know what progress the Sub-
Committees have made. In Sub-Committee B,
the meetings of which I have been attending
every day, we have been avoiding touching at
any time on questions which are liable to lead
to long discussions. When I say ?long dis-
cussions", do not get alarmed, because some-
times long discussions are necessary in order
to know exactly what are our views on the
different points.
On the other Sub-Committee, I consider that
I have only a half-membership, because we
had one meeting and then a Sub-Sub-Committee
of five was appointed and that Sub-Sub-
Committee assured us that it would report to
the Sub-Committee section by section ; that
is to say, every time a certain section of the
work was done it would call the Sub-Committee
together to consider the results. May I be
permitted to point out that that Sub-Sub-
Committee has not, up to the present, finished
even one section of its work, or at least so
I suppose, as it has not yet invited the full Sub-
Committee to meet.
I think, therefore, that it is unnecessary to
give any mandate to the Sub-Committees to
the effect that their work must finish by
a certain date, but that we should tell them
that they must work as quickly as possible,
and, I may add, that they must, if necessary,
hold longer meetings, sitting earlier and break-
ing up later, and, if necessary, hold meetings
at night. We should not, however, tell them
that they must finish by a certain date, because
by doing so our action may lead to unsatis-
factory results, by putting an end to necessary
discussion and by preventing certain delegations
from giving their points of view, a procedure
which is not only necessary but beneficial to
those who want to follow the work and to
see some good results come out of this Con-
ference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne has said that in his
experience International Conferences have always
a fixed programme laid out.
Sir IVlalcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
No, I did not say so. I said there are pre-
cedents for it.
IVI. Sze (China)
Sir Malcolm Delevingne said there were
precedents for a full programme being prepared.
We had a programme for another Conference
which preceded this, which was supposed
to finish in two weeks, and the programme of
which has not been carried through. Of course,
it is a good thing to have a programme so as
to have something to work on, but we should
not make our programmes too rigid, because
if we do we shall sacrifice efficiency for speed.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne has given us as
one of his reasons for the necessity for an early
conclusion that honourable members want to
go back home for Christmas. 1 know that
Christmas is a very important festival among
Christians, but I myself, in order to see the
work speedily done by this Conference and in
order not to delay its work, have not asked
even once that a holiday be given to me when
there was a great Confucian festival. I think,
therefore, it is only right that we should conti-
nue our work and not let any holidays interfere
with it. First, let us have efficiency and not
sacrifice it for speed, and, secondly, let us put
duty above pleasure.
The President
Translation : I call upon the Hon. Stephen
G. Porter, delegate of the United States of
America, to address the Conference.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America)
Mr. President, I am sorry that I canno-
share the optimism of the distinguished delet
gate of the British Empire as to the ability


of this Conference to complete its work in the
time fixed in the proposed resolution.
It is true that we are all anxious to spend
the Christmas holidays with our families. In
fact, this will be the first time in my life when
I shall be denied that most heartening of all
pleasures. But we are here engaged in a work
of world wide importance, a work that means
much for millions of human beings who, by
reason of their helplessness, are really charges
upon world society. It will be sad "indeed if
this Conference, in its desire to adjourn, should
neglect to perform this duty in the highest
possible way.
I realise the necessity for a programme :
I have no objection to one ; but I hope that
this Conference will not tie its hands by
passing this resolution so that we must
adjourn at a fixed date. I therefore propose
an amendment. I suggest that, after the words
?December? in line 2, the resolution should
be amended by inserting the words ?provided
it has completed its work?. It seems to us
that that is a reasonable proposition.
None of the Sub-Committees has reported
to the Conference. I know that you will all
agree with me that this is a most complicated
subject with endless ramifications which can
be ironed out in the Sub-Committees if we
but have the time to do so. But I think
that it would be a very serious mistake for
this Conference, which, I may say, has the
eyes of the world upon it, to fix a time for
adjournment which would, in all probability,
put us in the position of doing ineffective
work.
I also agree with the distinguished delegate
of China regarding his construction of para-
graph 1, which is to the effect that it is man-
datory upon the Sub-Committees. I do not
think that we should adopt this proposal, because
it will hurry them and may result in reports
that would not be as satisfactory as if we gave
the Sub-Committees the amount of time necess-
ary properly to decide upon them.
May I repeat that we are here from all over
the world and that we are all earnestly trying
to solve this grave international problem. I
know your anxiety to return for Christmas. I
have)no objection whatever to that. In fact,
I am inclined to suggest that we adjourn
for a week or ten days during the Christmas
holidays if that meets with the approval of
the delegates. I am agreeable to anything
as far as the holidays are concerned ; but
I do hope that this Conference will not tie
itsj hands so that it must complete its work
by a fixed time, whether it is able to do so
properly or not.
The President
Translation : I call upon Dr. Chodzko,
delegate of Poland, to address the Conference.
Dr. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : We have hitherto followed
the advice given us by Sir Malcolm Delevingne
as Rapporteur of the Business Committee.
In my first speech, however, I pointed out that
the method of work proposed by Sir Malcolm
Delevingne necessarily involved delay. The
responsibility for this does not, I think, rest
entirely with the Business Committee, as the
Conference agreed to the method suggested.
It is quite true that the Sub-Committees
have not yet submitted any reports, but I
would remind the Conference that three out
of the four weeks during which it has been
sitting have been devoted to preparatory work,
and that the Sub-Committees only began their
work a week ago. It is unthinkable that an
international conference so important as ours
should devote three weeks to questions of
detail and only one week to the real matter
in hand.
I beg to inform you, as Chairman of Sub-
committee B, that it appears to us to be impos-
sible to finish our work by the date proposed
by Sir Malcolm Delevingne.
I quite agree with the remarks of the Chinese
and United States delegates, and I suggest that
a vote be taken on Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s
proposal. I repeat that, so far as Sub-Com-
mittee B is concerned, it will be impossible
to conclude the work by the date suggested.
The Sub-Committees of the Conference are
not ordinary Sub-Committees. Speakers can-
not be limited as to time. Such being the
case, I do not think that it is possible to adopt
Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s proposal as it stands.
It might perhaps be accepted subject to the
amendments proposed by the United States
and Chinese delegates.
I think that we ought not to accept any task
which is beyond our powers, and I feel that if
we were to approve this proposal, we should
be adopting a very cumbrous machinery. A
few minutes ago the Conference decided to do
away with the two Committees which it had
set up : it is now proposed to create two new
ones: the Co-ordination Committee and the
Drafting Committee. I think that we could
quite well do without the first of these and
simply have the Drafting Committee. The
latter should, in my opinion, include all the
Chairmen of the Sub-Committees and would
thus serve the purpose of a Committee of
Co-ordination. This would simplify the pro-
cedure. If you approve of my proposals,
I hope that you will support them.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Sugimura,
delegate of Japan, to address the Conference.
M. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : Mr. President, Sir Malcolm
Delevingne has said that we must hasten our
work. I quite agree with him. Sir Malcolm
wishes to work on a time-table : that is an
excellent method. As to the question of
co-ordination, I think that that point is equally
important. I am therefore quite in agreement
with Sir Malcolm Delevingne in principle, but
I have a few objections to urge as to the methods *
which he suggests for putting these various
proposals into effect.
The lines upon which Sub-Committee A is
to work are not yet fixed ; Ido not know if
the same applies to Sub-Committee B and the
other Sub-Committees. The question before
us is difficult and complex : we are engaged
in drawing up an agreement which would be
in force for ten years or even longer : ours
is a great responsibility, and I do not see how
we can say that our work will be concluded
by any given date. It is impossible to judge
beforehand how long it will take.
Apart from the current questions before us,
we have to 'deal with those raised by the Chinese


delegation, and certain of the American dele- agreement. I feel sure, too, that Sir Malcolm
gation?s suggestions have not yet been assigned
to the Sub-Committees. Moreover, our deli-
berations must be such that when the time
comes to sign the Protocol and the Agreement,
we must not have too many reservations or
declarations. I think it is most important that
there should be as many signatures as possible
without reservations, and there is the danger
that if our discussions are hasty or incomplete,
we may not achieve this result.
Precedents already exist for Conferences ad-
journing before Christmas and meeting again
after the New Year. Why should we not do
the same ? It is quite easy for Sir Malcolm
Delevingne to cross the Channel and return a
few days later. He is not in the same position
as our first delegate, who cannot get home in
ten days. We must have a rest, and although
I admire the courage of the Chinese delegate,
I do not share it. We are all tired.
As I said before, I quite agree in principle
with Sir Malcolm Delevingne, but I think that
it is premature to discuss details and decide
everything now.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Bourgois, dele-
gate of France, to address the Conference.
IYI. Bourgois (France)
Translation : I quite agree with the views
expressed by the delegates of the United States,
Poland and Japan.
I think that the time spent in preparation
is out of all proportion to the time suggested
for completing the work. We do not know,
moreover, the exact extent of the work.
1 do not wish to bring up the question of compe-
tence again, but I should like to give just one
example : namely, the very complicated question
of China. Sir Malcolm Delevingne knows all
about the Chinese proposals and the discussions
of the Diplomatic Corps at Pekin (the documents
consist of more than 150 pages).
I support what M. Sugimura says about Sub-
Committee A, which does not yet know upon
what lines it is to work. As regards the
Sub-Committee of which I have the honour
to be Chairman, we have not yet touched the
question of free ports, nor have the countries
directly interested in this question of free ports
and free zones ever been heard either in the
Preparatory Committee or in the Advisory
Committee.
I therefore agree with M. Sugimura that we
must be very careful in making estimates and
forecasts which are somewhat dangerous.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. de Aguero y
Bethancourt, delegate of Cuba, to address
the Conference.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba) :
Translation : We have to deal with several
proposals : Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s proposal,
M. Sze?s amendment and the proposals made
by Dr. Chodzko and Mr. Porter. If we go
on in this way, we may wander from the point
and waste time. So far as I can see, the pro-
posals submitted by Mr. Porter, Dr. Chodzko
and M. Sze and supported by M. Sugimura
and M. Bourgois are practically identical,
and these delegates could easily come to an
Delevingne will make concessions. I suggest
therefore that, to avoid unnecessary discussion,
the meeting should adjourn for ten minutes or
so and that these gentlemen should form a
small Sub-Committee. A joint proposal might
then be submitted, upon which we could take
a decision. {Applause.)
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I have no objection to the adoption of the sug-
gestion of our Vice-President if that is likely
to produce an agreed result. I am a little
doubtful whether it will, but I am quite willing
to try.
The President
Translation : I wish to thank the Cuban
delegate for his proposal. He is quite right.
Our discussion might wander from the point.
In my opinion, however, we have to deal only
with two proposals : those submitted by
the Chinese and the United States delegates
respectively. We can adjourn our discussion
for ten minutes and a Sub-Committee can dis-
cuss the matter if you wish.
I am sure that Sir Malcolm Delevingne had
no desire to propose anything impossible. It
never occurred to him that the Conference should
be adjourned before it had completed its work.
Subject to your approval, I suggest therefore that
M. de Aguero?s proposal be adopted and the
meeting adjourned for ten minutes. Sir Mal-
colm Delevingne, Mr. Porter and M. Sze might
discuss the matter and submit a proposal.
We might even ask these gentlemen to meet
without the meeting being adjourned. We still
have to deal with the remaining items on our
agenda. Item 3 concerns the United States
proposals, and i should like to ask the United
States delegation if it is agreeable that this
proposal should be dealt with while the Sub-
Committee is meeting. Another member of
the .delegation might take Mr. Porter?s place
for the time being.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) :
I have no objection to the appointment of
this Sub-Committee, and certainly no objection
to the Conference continuing its work during
my absence. May I suggest, however, that,
in view of the fact that the delegates for Poland,
Japan, France and Cuba have spoken on this
subject, the Sub-Committee be enlarged so
as to have the benefit of their judgment in its
deliberations.
M. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation : We are entirely in favour of
Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s proposal in principle,
and would therefore accept it if he would
agree to the two amendments submitted. This
would satisfy everybody.
Dr. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : Neither the President nor Sir
Malcolm Delevingne has raised any objection
to the two amendments proposed, so that I
think the matter might be put differently.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne thought that we would
finish our work before Christmas. We are agreed
now that that is impossible. The Conference will
therefore have to meet again after the New Year.
I propose, therefore, that we say quite frankly


that, as we cannot finish our work before
Christmas, we shall adjourn on December 18th,
so that we can all go home and meet again
about January 3rd or 4th, 1925, This would
settle the point definitely.
The President
Translation : Ido not think we can decide
to-day whether the Conference will be able
to finish its work before Christmas.
I must also point out that no credits were
voted for the Conference for 1925 under the
League Budget. Credits were voted for prin-
ting and documents but not for meetings.
IVB. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I did not propose to take
part in this discussion, but I have changed
my mind in view of the President?s remarks.
The Spanish delegation is of opinion that the
Conference should conclude its work as speedily
as possible and that we should therefore urge
the Sub-Committees to hasten their work. In
another week, we can judge how much has
been done, and each delegation can express
its wishes and inform the President whether
or not it thinks the work of the Conference
should be suspended.
My personal opinion is that we should go
on sitting if necessary until the end of December,
in order to finish our work this year ; if the
majority of the Conference, however, is in
favour of adjourning, we might address a request
to the Council of the League for the necessary
funds to allow of our meeting again in 1925.
The President
Translation : I cannot say at the moment
if the Council is competent to settle the question,
but I am prepared to accept the Spanish dele-
gate s statement. If the Council were unable
to settle the question, we could doubtless come
to some agreement. The Secretariat might, if
necessary, communicate with the Council.,
I understand that the Spanish delegate is
unable to accept Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s
proposal with the American and Chinese amend-
ments.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : Yes, that is so.
The President
Translation : I propose therefore, that Sir
Malcolm Delevingne, M. Sze, Mr. Porter, M.
Sugimura, M. Bourgois, Dr. Chodzko and? the
First Cuban delegate should meet for a quarter
of an hour in order to draft a formula to cover
the first proposals submitted by the British
delegation.
As the Conference has no objection, I declare
the proposal to set up this small Sub-Committee
adopted. It is now 12.18. p.m., and we shall
hope to see them back in a quarter of an hour.
In the meantime, we will resume the discussion
of our agenda.
44. ENACTMENT OF EFFECTIVE LAWS OR
REGULATIONS PROHIBITING THE
MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTION
OF HEROIN : PROPOSAL OFTHE DELE-
GATION OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA: REFERENCE OF THE PRO-
POSAL TO SUB-COMMITTEE F.
Translation : The third point on our agenda
is the American delegation?s proposal concer-
ning Article 9-A of its suggestions. We
decided not to refer this question to a Sub-
Committee before discussing it at a plenary
meeting. The discussion is now open.
I call upon Surgeon-General Blue, delegate
of the United States of America, to address the
Conference.
Surgeon-General Blue (United States of
America)
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, some
days ago the Conference, by a unanimous vote,
with the exception of a reservation noted by the
Netherlands delegation, referred Article 9-A
of the suggestions of the United States, provi-
ding for the suppression of the manufacture
and distribution of heroin, to the First Committee
for consideration, and I desire briefly to draw
attention to the reasons which impelled the
Government of the United States to make
this suggestion.
Although for several years the importation
into the United States of heroin and other nar-
cotic drugs had been prohibited by law, it was
not until last June that Congress enacted
legislation providing that no crude opium
might be imported into the United States for
the manufacture of heroin. Since no crude
opium is produced in the United States, the
Act effectively prohibits, so far as the United
States is concerned, the manufacture and distri-
bution of heroin.
Referring for the moment to Article 9-A
of the suggestions of the United States, you
will see that there is a footnote reading ?See
Hearings of the Congress of the United States
accompanying this document??. By way of
explanation, I may say that when a Bill is
introduced in either branch of Congress
the usual practice is to refer the Bill to the
appropriate Committee for consideration. This
Committee holds hearings which for the most
part are open to the public and at which any
persons interested may appear and present
arguments either in favour of or against the
proposed legislation.
The hearings to which I have referred are
those before the Committee on Ways and
Means of the House of Representatives to which
the Bill prohibiting the manufacture of heroin
had been referred. Upon conclusion of the
hearings, that Committee reported unanimously
in favour of the proposed legislation, and, by
the Act of Congress approved June 7th, 1924,
(the vote in both Houses of Congress being
unanimous), the manufacture of heroin was
prohibited in the United States.
Need I assure you that the Congress, in sup-
pressing the manufacture of heroin in the United
States, did not act hastily but only after mature
deliberation and in response to the will of the
American people ? As early as 1916, the United
States Public Health Service, considering that
the administration of heroin was dangerous
and that the need for a respiratory sedative
in medicine might be met by the use of other
less dangerous drugs, prohibited the use of
heroin in the United States Marine Hospitals
and Dispensaries under its control.
Other medical services of the Government
of the United States were not long in following
the example set by the Public Health Service,
The President :


so that prior to the passage of the Act of June
7th last, the Army, Navy and the Veterans?
Bureau had prohibited the? use of heroin on the
ground that it was a dangerous drug and could
be replaced by one of the other alkaloids of
opium with the same therapeutic results and
with less danger of creating habituation.
The medical services of the United States,
however, were not alone in their condemnation
of the drug. In 1920 the House of Delegates
of the American Medical Association, with a
membership totalling 90,000, representing 80
per cent of the medical profession in the United
States, unanimously adopted the following
resolution :
?That heroin be eliminated from all
medicinal preparations, and that it should
not be administered, prescribed, nor dis-
pensed, and that the importation, manu-
facture, and sale of heroin should be prohi-
bited in the United States??.
The action of the American Medical Associa
tion was not hastily taken but was a result of
calm deliberation by a body of scientific men
who, in the light of their judgment and
experience, condemned the use of heroin on
the ground that the end did not justify the
means.
It is, of course, impossible in this brief state-
ment to dwell at length upon the medical and
scientific aspects of this question, but I shall
endeavour briefly to summarise the reasons
impelling the medical profession of the United
States to condemn the use of this pernicious
drug. For many years, the medical profession
had been endeavouring to find a substitute
for morphia, and in 1898 a German chemist
subjected morphia to the action of acetic
acid and produced heroin or, as the drug is
scientifically known, diacetyl-morphine hydro-
chloride. It is a most significant fact that, at
the time when the drug was being widely
heralded as the long-sought-for substitute for
morphia, German pharmacologists warned phy-
sicians, from the beginning, against the use
of heroin and pronounced it to be not indis-
pensable.
If we can accept the opinion of medical autho-
rities of the highest character, heroin possesses
the double action of cocaine and morphia ;
it produces the excitation of cocaine together
with the sedative effects of morphia. Heroin
cuts off the sense of moral responsibility much
quicker than morphine does, and for that reason
heroin addicts will the more quickly commit
crime with no sense of regret or responsibility.
While heroin obliterates responsibility as does
also cocaine, the muscular reaction is quicker
than in the case of the latter drug. From a
physiological standpoint, the effect of the drug
is to benumb the inhibitor and to make of
moral cowards, brutal brainless men without
fear and without conscience. As an eminent
physician has stated : ?It inflates the personality
and exaggerates the ego?.
At the hearing on the Bill to prohibit the
manufacture of heroin, the chief physician of
one of the largest prisons in the United States
testified that 96 per cent of the men admitted
to the prison who were drug addicts were
heroin addicts and that the average age of the
heroin addict was younger than that of other
prisoners. He further stated that, in the
light of years of observation and experience.
he was of the opinion that a very great per-
centage of men convicted of crime were drug
addicts who, had they not been influenced by
the drug habit, would not have become
criminals. The magistrate of the largest city
in the United States has gone on record as
stating that 98 per cent of drug addicts are
using heroin and that an addict using morphine
or cocaine is so rare as to attract attention.
The small dose and bulk of heroin facilitates
smuggling and secret addiction. Because of its
potency and solubility, the drug may be snuffed,
with the result that the habit may be readily
acquired and easily concealed.
On account of its poisonous qualities, which
act upon respiration, heroin has been declared
to be the most toxic of all drugs of addiction.
When you consider that, in the opinion of the
medical profession, the use of heroin may be
discontinued without interfering with the treat-
ment of disease, since it performs no function
which cannot be supplied by other alkaloids
of opium, you can readily understand why, in
the light of the abuses of which the drug is
susceptible, the Congress of the United States
has prohibited its manufacture and distribution.
The suppression, however, of the manufac-
ture of heroin in the United States is of little
value unless the other manufacturing nations
are prepared to take similar action, because
the. heroin abusively used in the United
States is for the most part manufactured
abroad and enters the country through illicit
channels.
While we have every desire to protect, so
far as may be possible, the people of the United
States from the baneful influences of heroin,
it is not for this reason alone that we are
appealing to the other manufacturing countries
represented here to suppress the manufacture
and distribution of this most pernicious of
all drugs. Drug addiction knows no barrier
or limitation. The problem of the United
States to-day will be your problem to-morrow,
and we therefore appeal to you to join us in
a common cause against a common enemy.
M. Beland (Canada)
Translation : I heartily support the pro-
posals submitted to the Conference by the Uni-
ted States delegation. Heroin is not considered
indispensable by the medical profession. Seve-
ral well-known hospitals in Canada have given
up using it entirely. Its place can be taken
by codein or morphine if a sedative drug is
wanted. The abuse of heroin leads to results
which are far worse than those caused by other
drugs.
We have several enemies with which to con-
tend. If we can get rid of one to start with,
we may hope to dispose of the others more
easily.
M. de Rflytienaere (Belgium)
Translation : I think the Conference will
have realised from the first Canadian delegate?s
remarks that the question before us is a medical
one. To save time, I propose that the question
of heroin be referred to Sub-Committee F.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba)
Translation : I beg to support the Belgian
delegate?s proposal.


IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I also support the Belgian
proposal.
IVI. von Eckardt (Germany)
Translation : lam in entire agreement with
the Belgian proposal.
IVI. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : I also support the Belgian
proposal.
The President
Translation : As there is no one else on
my list to speak, I declare the discussion closed.
We have before us a proposal of the Belgian
delegation, supported by M. de Aguero y
Bethancourt, M. de Palacios, M. von Eckardt
and M. Falcioni, that the question of heroin
be referred to Sub-Committee F.
Do any members of the Conference still wish
to speak on this question, or may we regard
the Belgian proposal as adopted ?
Surgeon-General Blue (United States of
America)
On behalf of the delegation of the United
States, I want to say we very gladly accept the
suggestion of the honourable delegate for
Belgium.
The President
Translation : As there is no objection, the
Conference accepts the proposal that this
question be referred to Sub-Committee F.
Adopted.
45. CONTROL OF PERSONS MANUFACTU-
RING, IMPORTING, SELLING, DISTRIBU-
TING OR EXPORTING MORPHINE, CO-
CAINE OR THEIR RESPECTIVE SALTS
OR DERIVATIVES, AS WELL AS THE
BUILDINGS IN WHICH THESE PER-
SONS CARRY ON SUCH INDUSTRY OR
TRADE : PENALTIES FOR THE IL-
LEGAL POSSESSION OFTHESE DRUGS :
ARTICLES 10, 11, 20 AND 20-F OF
THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
The President
Translation : The fourth item on our agenda
concerns Articles 10, 11, 20 and 20-F of the
United States? proposal.
The articles in question were referred for
discussion to the Second Committee, which
did not send them on to the competent Sub-
Committees as the opinion had been expressed
in the Business Committee that it would be
advisable for a Committee to discuss them
before sending them to the Sub-Committees.
I suggest, therefore, that a general discussion
be opened or that a proposal be submitted that
these articles be referred to one of the Sub-
Committees.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I venture, as ex-Rapporteur
of the Business Committee, to make a sugges-
tion. It seems to me that we should gain time
if we did not discuss these articles now in
the plenary Conference but reserved that
discussion until a proposal has been submitted
by the Sub-Committee competent to deal with
them.
If my suggestion meets with the approval
of members of the Conference, our President
might perhaps ask the Chairman of Sub-
Committee E if that Sub-Committee could
undertake to examine the articles in question
or refer them to the special Drafting Committee
appointed by Sub-Committee E.
The President
Translation : The Chairman of Sub-Com-
mittee E has heard M. Dinichert?s proposal
and I now ask him if his Sub-Committee can
deal with Articles 10, n, 20 and 20-F, which
cover the whole of the American proposal ?
IVI. Bourgois (France) :
Translation : Articles 10 and 11 are ob-
viously within the competence of Sub-Committee
E. We could also undertake to deal with
Articles 20 and 20-F.
The President
Translation: The first Swiss delegate?s propo-
sal to refer the discussion of the articles cove-
red by the American proposal to Sub-Commit-
tee E is agreed to by the Chairman of that Sub-
Committee.
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
Translation : I beg to point out that the
Netherlands delegation has no instructions
regarding the derivatives referred to in Articles
10 and 11.
The President
Translation : The remark of the Nether-
lands delegate will be mentioned in the record
of the present meeting.
IVIr. Edwin Neville (United States of Ame-
rica) :
Article 10 of the American proposals is only
a little widening of paragraph 6 of the second
part of the Advisory Committee?s draft. I
suggest that Articles 10 and 11 might be sent
to Sub-Committee A if the Chairman of Sub-Com-
mittee E thinks that he is not in a position to
take charge of them.
The President
Translation : Does the United States dele-
gate wish these articles to be referred to Sub-
Committee A now or after discussion by Sub-
Committee E ?
Mr. Edwin Neville (United States of Ame-
rica) :
I understood the Chairman of Sub-Committee
E to say that that Sub-Committee could only
take charge of Articles 20 and 20-F. If I
misunderstood, him, of course I withdraw
my proposal.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : On the contrary, I said that
we were entitled to discuss Articles 10 and 11,
which come within the competence of Sub-
Committee E.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I wish to supplement the
proposal which I have just made. The Nether-
lands delegation has, at the right moment,
directed our attention, as regards articles
10 and 11, to the fact that, apart from the new
and stricter wording of the corresponding pro-
visions of the Hague Convention, the United


States suggestions involve an extension of these
two articles, in that the provisions of the Hague
Convention and all subsequent provisions would
apply not only to the products and salts men-
tioned in the Hague Convention but also
to derivatives of such. The question of the
stricter application of the Hague Convention
involved in these articles might be referred
to Sub-Committee E and the question of their
extension to Sub-Committee F. I see no
point, however, in referring Articles 10 and n
to Sub-Committee A, as was suggested, I
think, by the United States delegation.
IVI. Perrot (France)
Translation : In Articles 10 and 11, there
are two distinct points to be considered :
the question of control in general and the ques-
tion of definition involved by control. In the
first article the word "derivatives? should be
more clearly defined and emphasised. We
ask that this special point should be submitted
to Sub-Committee F in order that, whenever
this word occurs, we may know exactly what
is meant by it. I think this was what the
Netherlands and Swiss delegates had in mind.
The President
Translation : We have before us a proposal
that these articles or at least part of them
be referred to Sub-Committee E and that the
definition of the word ?derivatives? which
occurs in certain of these articles be referred
to Sub-Committee F. The Chairman of Sub-
Committee F is not here to-day ; but I feel
sure the Swiss delegate will be good enough
to explain to him our reasons for referring
these articles to the Sub-Committee in ques-
tion.
IVI. von Eckardt (Germany) :
Translation : M. Anselrnino, the Vice-Chair-
man of Sub-Committee F, is here. He could
give an opinion.
The President
Translation : I did not know that the Vice-
Chairman was present. I call upon him now
to speak.
IV!. Anselrnino (Germany)
I ranslation : As Vice-Chairman of Sub-
Committee F, and as substitute for Dr. Carriere,
I beg to inform you that Article 14, which
is connected with Articles g, 10, 12 and 13,
was dealt with by Sub-Committee F. The
latter can therefore discuss the American
suggestions.
The President
Translation : If no one has any objection,
it is agreed, then, that these proposals be refer-
red to Sub-Committees E and F.
{Agreed).
40. PROPOSALS OF THE NORWEGIAN GO-
VERNIVIENT REGARDING . (a)THE SUB-
MISSION OF QUARTERLY STATISTICS;
(b) THE APPLICATION OF CHAPTER 111
OFTHE HAGUE CONVENT lON TO ECGO-
NINE ; (c) THE PROPOSED DELETION
OF THE LAST SENTENCE OF ARTICLE
10 OF THE HAGUE CONVENTION.
Translation : The following observations
have been received from the Norwegian Govern-
ment regarding the measures suggested by
the Advisory Committee as a basis for the
discussions of the Second Conference (Document
A. 32 {a)) :
?Part I.
"IV. The Norwegian Government cannot
accede to the provision in accordance with
which Governments would have to submit
quarterly statistics of the amounts of the
substances in question imported and expor-
ted by them instead of furnishing an annual
report, as has hitherto been the practice.
"As pharmacies are specially inspected
at regular intervals in Norway and as,
moreover, conditions in that country render
supervision of the traffic in these drugs
an easy matter, the Royal Government is
of opinion that the annual statistics are
amply sufficient for the requirements of
control. There is accordingly every reason
to believe that any serious abuse would
speedily be discovered. The Government
therefore considers that, as regards Norway,
quarterly reports which would, moreover,
entail a considerable amount of work
cannot be regarded as necessary.
?Part 11.
"V. The Norwegian Government has
no objection to the inclusion of eegonine.
"VI ( conclusion ). The Norwegian Go-
vernment cannot accede to the proposal
for the deletion of the last sentence in
Article 10 of the Hague Convention, if
that is to be taken to mean that chemists
would have to enter in their books, toge-
ther with the name of the purchaser,
each consignment of opium, etc., or of drugs
containing the foregoing substances, and
to notify the authorities of the facts. Such
a provision would be too drastic and is
not essential for the purposes of control.
It would, moreover, appear to be imprac-
ticable.
?While dealing with this subject, we
desire to state that pharmacies in Norway
are regularly inspected by the authorities
and that the licence system at present
governing the opening of pharmacies in
that country is, from the standpoint of
control, equivalent to a State monopoly.?
I think that Part II comes within the com-
petence of Sub-Committee E, but as I do not feel
qualified to express an opinion, I will call
upon M. Bourgois, the Chairman of the Sub-
Committee, to state his views.
IVI. Bourgois (France) :
Translation : Sub-Committee F has already
taken a decision concerning eegonine. This
question is within the competence of Sub-
Committee E, as also is paragraph VI.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : There seems to be some mis-
take. I think that the Norwegian proposal before
us is the one concerning the books to be kept
by chemists. It seems to me that this question
should be dealt with first by Sub-Committee E
or its Drafting Committee. I think 1 heard
The President


some mention of referring it to Sub-Committee
F.
The President
Translation : There has been some misun-
derstanding. The first part of the Norwegian
proposal has already been referred to one of the
Sub-Committees, and it is with the second part
that we are dealing now.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : The first part of the Norwegian
proposal was referred some time ago to the
First Committee, which has probably passed it
on to one of its Sub-Committees. The second
part, however, with which we are dealing now,
and which was previously referred to the Second
Committee, seems to me to come within the
competence of Sub-Committee E and not of
Sub-Committee F.
The President
Translation : Part 11, ?the Government has
no objection to the inclusion of ecgonine?,
has not yet been referred to any Sub-Committee.
I think it should be dealt with by Sub-Committee
F.
IV!. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : That is quite correct. We
did not discuss that point, as we did not regard
it as a proposal but simply as information,
which there was no need to refer to any Sub-
Committee. We might, however, do so now
if it is considered desirable.
The President
Translation : Are you speaking of the end
of paragraph VI ?
EVI. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : Yes. This paragraph should
be referred to Sub-Committee E. Its Chairman
approves of this proposal.
The President
Translation : What do you suggest should
be done with the last part : ?While dealing
with this subject, we desire to state that
pharmacies in Norway ? ?
IV!. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : That part is included in
paragraph VI.
The President
Translation : We are agreed, then, that
this proposal should be referred to Sub-Com-
mittee E.
If the Conference has no objection, I declare
this proposal adopted.
{Agreed).
47. CO ORDINATION OF THE WORK OF
SUB COM IV! ITT EES A, B, C AND D
AND APPOINTMENT OF A DRAFTING
COIVIIVS ITT EE : PROPOSALS OF THE
? BRITISH DELEGATION : REPORT OF
THE SUB-COmmiTTEE.
Translation : I have just heard the result
of the Sub-Committee?s discussion. The sug-
gestion is that the Conference should accept
the proposals mentioned in paragraphs 2 and 3
concerning the appointment of a Committee of
Co-ordination and a Drafting Committee, and
that no dates should be mentioned. The firts
part of Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s proposal
is withdrawn for the time being. The discussion
will be resumed later, probably on Thursday.
The Sub-Committee has also asked me to
request the Chairmen of the various Sub-
Committees to expedite their work as far as
possible. I hereby do so.
In reply to the Polish delegate?s remarks
concerning the formalities of this Conference,
I may say that the organisation of the work
of an International Conference has never been
so difficult. I do not know the reason for
this, but I must defend the Chair against
the Polish delegate?s reproach. Moreover, the
purpose of these formalities was to facilitate
our work and to enable the Conference to
conclude its work more speedily.
Dr Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I had no idea of criticising
our President, who has the esteem and confi-
dence of the whole Conference. I simply
wished to emphasise the fact that, as our pre-
paratory work had taken three weeks, we must
leave plenty of time for the real work of the
Conference.
The President
Translation : Three weeks is rather an
exaggeration. But I do not wish to prolong
the discussion.
As no one has any objection to offer, I declare
Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s proposal, as amended
by the Sub-Committee, adopted. The amen-
ded text read as follows :
?1. That a joint meeting of represen-
tatives of Sub-Committees A, B, C and D
be held for the purpose of co-ordinating
the conclusions of these Sub-Committees
and presenting a joint report to the ple-
nary Conference.
?Sub-Committees A, B and D shall each
nominate two members in addition to the
Chairman and Committee C one member
in addition to the Chairman, to represent
them at the meeting.
?2. That a Drafting Committee be
appointed forthwith, consisting of the
President of the Conference and five per-
sons to be nominated by the President, and
that this Committee commence its work
as soon as the report of any of the Sub-
Committees has been approved by the
Conference.??
The proposal wa.s adopted.
I wish to thank the Conference for this
mark of confidence. I cannot appoint the
members of the Drafting Committee now, but
I intend to make a statement later.
The Conference rose at T. 15 p.m.


FOURTEENTH MEETING
Held at Geneva on Friday, December 12 th, 1924, at 3.30 p.m.
CONTENTS :
48. Petition from the White Cross Inter-
national Anti-Narcotic Society.
49. Composition of the Drafting Committee.
50. Composition of the Indian Delegation :
Departure of Mr. J. Campbell and
Appointment of Mr. J. C. Walton.
51. Composition of the Turkish Delegation
and its Representation on Sub-Com-
mittee F.
52. Imposition of Penalties for Offences
AGAINST THE PROVISIONS OF THE CON-
VENTION TO BE CONCLUDED BY THE
Conference ; Proposal of the Egyp-
tian Delegation : Reference to the
Co-ordination Committee.
53. Question of the Possible Adjournment
of the Conference.
54. Prepared Opium : Chapter II of the
Suggestions of the United States
of America : Motion submitted by the

President : M. Herluf Zahle.
48. PETITION FROiVI THE WHITE CROSS
INTERNATIONAL ANTI-NARCOTIC SO-
CIETY.
The President
Translation : Ladies and gentlemen, be-
fore we begin the discussion of the items on
our agenda, Mrs. Hamilton Wright has asked
me to allow her to read a petition signed by a
large number of American citizens.
I call upon Mrs. Hamilton Wright to speak.
Mrs. Hamilton Wright (United States of
America)
Mr. President and honourable delegates
of the Conference, I have been asked to pre-
sent this petition from the White Cross of
America, which Mrs. Sturges was to have pre-
sented, together with this letter which she has
written. In the letter she says :
?On November 20th, when I presented
to the Conference the petition from the
White Cross of America, I asked permission
to add the thousands of names that were
on their way here. At that time I had
no idea that instead of thousands of these
names there would be millions. I am
now prepared to inform the Conference
that enough millions of Americans have
signed this petition to represent over one-
half of the population of the United States.
As only persons over 21 years of age
could sign the petition, these numbers are
significant. They mean that nearly all the
adult population of the United States is
solidly behind Mr. Porter and the American
delegation, and these millions are following
closely what is being done here at Geneva,
through the Press despatches which reach
our country day by day.
?Our country is united in its desire to
see the production of opium and dangerous
drugs reduced to the actual medical require-
ments of the world, with no surplus left
over for abuse.
?Some idea of the kinds of people and
organisations that are asking for this
reduction may be gained from my mention-
ing just a few of the largest bodies that
have signed the petition : the American
Federation of Labour, representing twenty
millions ; Chambers of Commerce in the
various States ; the American Legion ;
the Salvation Army ; the Federation of
Women?s Clubs (five millions) ; the Knights
of Columbus, and other Catholic organisa-
tions, etc., which means that there is a
vast public sentiment in America which
is urging this Conference to take positive
and decisive steps to put down the opium
traffic.??
The petition from the White Cross of America
reads as follows :
?Petition from the White Cross Inter-
national Anti-Narcotic Society, Seattle,
Washington, U.S.A., to the International
Opium Conference.
?The undersigned, viewing in the grow-
ing addiction to narcotic drugs a deadly
menace to individuals and to nations,
an insidious rapidly-spreading poisoning
of the human race, which can be overcome
only by the co-operation among all nations,
respectfully petition the International
Opium Conference assembling in November
1924 to adopt measures adequate for total
extirpation of the plants from which they
originate, except as found necessary for
medicine and science in the judgment of
the best medical opinion of the world,??
and then there follow the names.
The President
Translation : This letter and petition will
be included in the record of the meeting. The
signatures will be deposited with the Secreta-
riat and may be inspected by the members
of the Conference.
49. COMPOSITION OF THE DRAFTING
COMMITTEE.
The President
Translation : The first item on our agenda
concerns the nomination of the members of
the Drafting Committee. At its last meeting
the Conference passed a resolution authorising
me as President to appoint these members
without delay.


1 have to inform you that I have appointed
the following ;
M. Arturo PintoEscalier (Bolivia).
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire).
M. Bourgois (France).
M. Sugimura (Japan).
Mr. Porter (United States of America).
All these delegates have agreed to serve on
the Committee.
50. COMPOSITION OF THE INDIAN DELE-
GATION : DEPARTURE OF Mr. J.
CAMPBELL AND APPOINTMENT OF
Mr. J. C. WALTON.
The President
Translation : I have just received the follow-
ing letter from the India Office :
?Your Excellency is aware that Mr.
J. Campbell, C.5.1., 0.8. E., who was
appointed one of the delegates of India at
the International Conference on Drugs,
now in session, is obliged to return to
Greece in connection with his duties as
British member of the Greek Refugee
Settlement Commission.
?I have the honour to inform you, on
behalf of the Secretary of State for India,
that Mr. J. C. Walton has been appointed
as a representative of the Government of
India in addition to Mr. H. Clayton,
C.1.E., for the remainder of the session
of the Conference.?
The letter from the India Office was noted.
51. COMPOSITION OF THE TURKISH DE-
LEGATION AND ITS REPRESENTATION
ON SUB-COMMITTEE F.
The President
Translation : I have just received the
following letter from the Turkish delegation :
(Translation) ?I have the honour to
inform you that M. Nuriddin Bey, Pro-
fessor of Agricultural Chemistry at the
Agricultural College, Constantinople, joined
the Turkish delegation yesterday as a
member and technical expert in chemis-
try.?
?I propose that he should join Sub-Com-
mittee F.?
I read the last part of this letter to your
Business Committee this afternoon. That Com-
mittee decided to propose to the Conference
that the new Turkish delegate be appointed to
Sub-Committee F. I hope that you have no
objection to this proposal.
The proposal was adopted.
52. IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES FOR OF-
FENCES AGAINST THE PROVISIONS OF
THE CONVENTION TO BE CONCLUDED
BY THE CONFERENCE : PROPOSALOF
THE EGYPTIAN DELEGATION ; REFE-
RENCE TO THE CO-ORDINATION COM-
MITTEE.
The President
Translation : The Business Co remittee has
to-day examined the following recommendation
proposed by the Egyptian delegation :
?That the Powers signatories of the
Convention impose uniform penalties for
offences against the provisions of the Con-
vention to be concluded by this Conference,
or at least that they should mention in
the Convention that the penalty will not
be less than that provided for misde-
meanours.?
The Business Committee proposes that this
recommendation be referred to the Co-ordina-
tion Committee.
Does anyone wish to speak on this question ?
As no one desires to speak, I declare the pro-
posal adopted.
A dopted.
53. QUESTION OF THE POSSIBLE AD-
JOURNMENT OF THE CONFERENCE.
The President
Translation : The next item on the agenda
refers to the possible adjournment of the
Conference. I included this question on the
agenda in order that you might have an oppor-
tunity of discussing the matter if you wished.
You may perhaps remember that a Sub-Com-
mittee was appointed at the last meeting
to consider a proposal submitted by the first
British delegate ; following the discussions
of that Sub-Committee, two resolutions were
submitted to the Conference concerning the
Co-ordination Committee and the Drafting Com-
mittee, the members of which latter Committee
I have just nominated.
The Sub-Committee did not come to any
agreement as regards the adjournment of the
Conference ; it simply stated that the matter
would have to be discussed later. I visited the
different Sub-Committees and informed them
that I had no intention, at all events for the
moment, of suggesting an adjournment. If the
Conference wishes to discuss the question, now
is the time ; otherwise we will proceed with
the discussion on the other items of the agenda.
Does anyone wish to speak on this point ?
As no one wishes to speak, the discussion is
closed. The question will be dealt with when-
ever any delegation wishes to raise it.
54. PREPARED OPIUM : CHAPTER II OF
THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA : MOTION SUB-
MITTED BY THE UNITED STATES
DELEGATION.
The President
Translation : The following motion has
been submitted by the United States delegation
and is now open for discussion :
?On behalf of the delegation of the
United States of America, I hereby present
for the consideration of the Conference
Chapter II of the Suggestions of the United
States of America, and move that the
proposals contained in this Chapter be
referred by the Conference to an appro-
priate Committee for consideration.?
I call upon the Hon. Stephen G. Porter to
address the Conference.


The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States of
America)
Mr. President and members of the Confe-
rence, in submitting my motion a brief word
may not be out of place, merely in order to
show that we are following a precedent already
established in this Conference.
On November 22nd the first report of the
Business Committee was adopted. On behalf
of the delegation of the United States, I made
the following declaration :
?In the opinion of the delegates of the
United States, the report of the Business
Committee seems to curtail the scope of
the Conference. It may not do so, but,
on the other hand, it may. We have no
desire to delay matters, and therefore I
shall put on record a statement in the
nature of a reservation.
?It is the opinion of the United States
delegation that the report of the Business
Committee may unduly curtail the scope
of the Conference, and my delegation,
having no desire to delay the work, will
vote in favour of the adoption of the report,
but on the express condition that it will
be permitted to present to the Conference,
or to the appropriate Committees thereof,
for consideration on their merits, the
suggestions of the United States, or such
portions thereof as it may deem germane
to the purpose of the Conference. Our
instructions are such that we would find
it difficult to proceed further in the Confe-
rence without this clear understanding.?
At the ninth plenary meeting, held on Novem-
ber 27th, the Rapporteur of the Business
Committee, after explaining the reference of
the programme of the Advisory Committee
to the various Committees of the Conference,
made this statement ;
?The Business Committee proceeded to
consider the draft submitted by the United
States delegation. I think that many of
us felt some regret at being obliged if
I might so express it to dissect such
an admirably constructed plan.
?As it had been decided that questions
coming under Part I of the Advisory Com-
mittee?s programme should be referred to
the First Committee and those under Part
II to the Second Committee, it naturally
followed that the American draft should be
distributed in the same way. After dis-
cussion, we decided upon the proposal,
which there is no need for me to repeat
as it is included in the second report of
the Business Committee which is already
before you.
?The Business Committee decided to
leave on one side for the time being the
Preamble of the American draft, interesting
though it was, for it felt that any preamble
was simply a summary of the contents of
an agreement, and it thought that it was
better, before dealing with the Preamble,
to see what there was in the agreement to
which it was an introduction.
?If you read through Article 1, you will
note that the subject with which it deals
belongs to the group of questions which
we propose to hold over. The same applies
to Part 11, which corresponds to Chapter II
of the Hague Convention.?
In the second report of the Business Committee
(Annex 17), referring to the complete scheme
submitted by the United States delegation, the
following statements are made :
?The first article is reserved, that is
to say, it is not for the moment referred
to either of the Committees. The United
States delegation, however, has reserved
the right to raise the question dealt with
in the first article of the draft, either in
Committee or at a plenary meeting of the
Conference.?
?Chapter 11, including the definition of
prepared opium and Articles 6, 7 and 8,
has been reserved under the same condi-
tions as Article 1.?
?Article q-A, dealing with heroin, is
also reserved.?
At the tenth plenary meeting held on Novem-
ber 28th, the President said :
?The plenary meeting of to-day was
fixed by a decision of the First Committee....
the Conference will remember that it
decided to leave to its Business Committee
the duty of preparing a programme of
work. Your Business Committee has ap-
plied itself to its task, and, after a very
thorough examination, has been able to sub-
mit to you a programme of work. Some
of the questions which concern this Confe-
rence are distributed between the First
and Second Committees, while certain parts
of other questions are held back by the
Business Committee.
?This programme of work was submitted
to the Conference by the Rapporteur of the
Business Committee, the distinguished dele-
gate for Switzerland, and you accepted the
programme and the distribution of work
proposed in it.
?We have to deal with two proposals
which have been submitted to the Confe-
rence by the United States delegation. The
first proposal presents for considera-
tion by the Conference Article q-A of
the suggestions of the United States of
America. The other proposal presents
for consideration by the Conference Article
1.?
The Conference will recall that, in regard to
Articles 1 and q-A, action was taken. Follow-
ing that practice, I now desire to bring up
for consideration the remaining item in the
American programme.
On behalf of the delegation of the United
States of America, I hereby present for the
consideration of the Conference Chapter II
of the suggestions of the United States of
America, and move that the proposals contained
in this Chapter be referred by the Conference
to an appropriate Committee for considera-
tion.
If there is no objection, I shall not read the
immaterial parts of Chapter 11, as they relate
only to minor amendments. I will only call
attention to the point which, to our mind, is
the vital part of the work of this Conference,
namely, Article 8 :
?Each Contracting Party in whose ter-
ritory the use of prepared opium is now
temporarily permitted agrees to reduce its
imports of raw opium for the purpose


of making prepared opium by ten per cent
of its present importation each year for
a period of ten years beginning with the
date of ratification of this Convention by
it, and further agrees not to supplement the
reduction by domestically produced opium ;
and further agrees that at the end of such
period of ten years it will prohibit the
importation of raw opium for the purpose
of making prepared opium. By ?present
importation? is understood the impor-
tation during the twelve months imme-
diately preceding the date the Contrac-
ting Party ratifies this Convention.?
I therefore move that the foregoing proposals
be referred by the Conference to an appropriate
Committee for consideration.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. van Wettum,
delegate of the Netherlands, to address the
Conference.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, if the pro-
posal of the United States delegation be taken
up by the Conference, a situation will arise
which, in my opinion, is without precedent
in the history of international conferences.
I do not desire to enter into an examination
of legal or juridical points to show that this
question is outside the scope of the Conference,
nor do I wish to explain here the enormous
difficulties which will confront the Conference
if it decides to add to its task a larger and even
more intricate 'programme, the work of the
Conference already being so heavy that most
of us feel tired after four weeks of strenuous
effort.
Under a sense of restraint, I shall keep silent
upon these points. I do, however, want the Confe-
rence to understand that it would be preposte-
rous for it to declare null and void the results
reached by another Conference and recklessly
to embark on an endeavour to draft a new
Convention concerning a problem of which most
of the members here assembled have had no
experience. Such a course would, in my opinion,
not only show an insufficient sense of respon-
sibility, but would also mean the passing of
a verdict on the members of the First Confe-
rence and the Governments which they repre-
sent. Such a situation is both impossible and
intolerable.
If such a regrettable precedent were once
established by a Conference held under the
auspices of the League, most Governments will
in future have grave and well-justified mis-
givings regarding the desirability of being repre-
sented at such international meetings.
Gentlemen, you have been working for four
weeks. You know now the difficulties that must
be overcome before our goal can be reached.
You also will find that the results of your
work will not satisfy those who wish to reform
the world in one day.
As the President of the First Conference,
I can assure the present Conference that the
Convention agreed upon after three weeks of
strenuous work, and which will be signed to-
morrow, is an important step forward. Cir-
cumstances explicitly mentioned in the Preamble
of that agreement have made it impossible for
us to make more progress at this time. But
we hope that those circumstances, over which we
have now no control, will disappear and will
give us a chance to advance another step.
For that reason we have bound ourselves to
re-assemble again at the latest in 1929 with the
firm intention to continue the struggle with
every means at our disposal.
In conclusion, I would say one word to those
idealists who are throwing stones at men
who are no less honest and sincere, no less
desirous than they are to fight against the evil.
I would ask them to continue to give us the
encouragement of their lofty ideals, of their
unceasing call to persevere, but I would also
ask them to have some consideration for those
who, plodding their way along the difficult
uphill path, have to translate ideals into
efficient action.
I do not want to say more at present on the
subject. In my opinion, this Conference has
no right or qualification to go over the ground
which has been exhausted by the First Con-
ference. If, unhappily, a decision to the contrary
were taken, I should be obliged, acting under
the instructions of my Government, formally to
protest against such procedure and to abstain
from taking part in your discussions on the
subject.
The President
Translation: I call upon Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne, delegate of the British Empire, to
address the Conference.
Sir IV*a!colm Beievingne (British Empire)
Mr. President, the proposal before us suggests
that seven Governments having territories
in the Far East in which the use of opium for
smoking is temporarily permitted in pursuance
of and in accordance with Chapter II of the
Hague Convention shall take certain measures
for the purpose of carrying out their obliga-
tions under that Chapter. The proposal is
brought forward by the delegation of a Govern-
ment which is not one of those seven Govern-
ments, and it is submitted to a Conference
which has been summoned for a different pur-
pose, the Governments represented on that
Conference having for the most part no connec-
tion with the matter. Moreover, the subject
in question has been referred to another and
a separate Conference, also summoned by the
Council of the League, and composed of repre-
sentatives of the interested countries. The
view of the British delegation with regard to
the proposal is quite clear. It is that the matter
is not within the competence of this Conference
and is not the concern of this Conference.
The British delegation can take no part in the
discussion of the question.
The consideration of competence is the domi-
nating consideration in regard to this proposal,
and, in our view, the subject could only be added
to the agenda of the Conference by a unanimous
decision of all the delegations assembled here.
There is another consideration which I think
should carry great weight with the Conference
in dealing with this proposal. The First Con-
ference has, with considerable difficulty, arrived
at an agreement. Ido not wish to pretend that
that agreement is all, or nearly all, that we could
have desired. It is a matter for great regret
to the British delegation, and I have no doubt
to other delegations also, that we have been
unable to go further, and, in particular, that


no proposals for direct limitation have been
found to be possible, under the conditions at
present existing in the Far East.
The reasons why they have not been found
to be possible were explained and discussed at
the First Conference, and it would be out of
place for me to go into them in detail here.
I cannot, however, for a moment admit that
the work of the First Conference, and the agree-
ment which it has reached, deserves the attack
which I am sorry to see Bishop Brent has
distributed to the members of this Conference.
It would be a great mistake if (as he suggested
in his appeal) that agreement were not signed
or ratified.
The delegate of the United States of America
in his speech has given us no reason for bringing
forward the proposal at this Conference. The
United States delegation, which was present at
Geneva last year, intimated that it was not con-
cerned with the subject of the First Conference,
and the United States Government has not given
any notice to the interested Governments that
it proposed to raise this question at this
Conference. I cannot understand why, in
these circumstances, such a proposal (which
I am afraid will have the effects that the dele-
gate for the Netherlands has suggested) has
been brought forward.
I have one thing more to say, and it is this.
One of the chief difficulties with which the
Governments which have to deal with this
matter are confronted is the fact that the
question has been surrounded by a cloud of
prejudice and misrepresentation. My own
Government has been made the subject of
continual attacks, based on such prejudice
and misrepresentation, which it deeply resents.
My Government has nothing to conceal. It
has laid before the First Conference the reports
of the enquiries conducted in the Colonies for
the purpose of the First Conference, in regard
to the question of the use of opium for smoking.
My Government, moreover, has no wish to
take up an obstructive attitude in this matter,
and I am instructed by it to declare that the
British Government is perfectly willing that
a small and impartial Commission of Enquiry,
on which none of the interested Powers would
be represented, should be appointed by the
Council of the League and should make a
thorough examination of this question: such
a Commission would visit, for the purpose,
the Far Eastern territories in which the use
of opium for smoking is still permitted ; it
would visit the Philippines, in which a measure of
prohibition was introduced some years ago ;
it would visit China, where the existing condi-
tions constitute one of the great difficulties
which the Far Eastern Powers have to face in
dealing with this subject ; and it would make
a report to the Council as to what further
measures, if any, could be usefully taken in
order to bring about the effective and gradual
suppression of the use of opium for smoking
which is provided for in Chapter II of the Hague
Convention.
I make no formal proposal, of course, to this
Conference. We do not regard the matter as
one for this Conference. The assent of the
other States interested would have to be
obtained. The British Government wishes me,
however, to take this opportunity of making
its attitude in this matter clear to the world.
Translation : I call upon M. Buero, dele-
gate of Uruguay, to address the Conference.
M ? Buero (Uruguay)
7 ranslation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, the Uruguayan delegation has once
more great pleasure in supporting the proposal
submitted by the United States delegation.
We cannot be indifferent to the failure of the
First Conference, as the questions with which
it dealt come within the general scheme of
our work.
The Hague Convention of 1912 is a complete
whole, and the principles underlying it should,
at all events theoretically, guide us as well as
the First Conference.
It was decided to invite only the States
directly concerned to discuss the measures to
be taken by countries in which the use of pre-
pared opium is authorised under Chapter II
of the 1912 Convention, and there is a simple
and logical explanation for this procedure. The
object was to arrive more rapidly at an agree-
ment, by avoiding a long discussion in which
the delegates of those countries would take the
chief part.
This, in my opinion, in no way justifies the
assumption that our Conference was not to
have the right to deal with the 1912 Convention
as a whole, and with Chapter II in particular.
It must not be forgotten that the 1912 Conven-
tion was signed by States which were not
invited to be present at the First Conference,
and it is natural that such States, when taking
part in the Second Conference, should wish to
discuss questions relating to the application or
amendment of that Convention. A distinction
as regards terminology was made between
the First and Second Conferences, but this
must not be regarded as a fundamental dis-
tinction, and none of the States represented
here which signed the Hague Convention can
consent to a division of its provisions.
It was agreed provisionally that the questions
referred to in Chapter II of the Hague Conven-
tion should be discussed first by a group consist-
ing only of members representing the eight
countries directly concerned, but it was under-
stood that the delegates of those countries
would submit to the Second Conference an
agreement for the application of the decisions
or principles contained in Chapter II of the
Hague Convention, and that this agreement
would be examined, with a view to its adoption,
by all the countries concerned that is to say,?
by all the members of this Conference.
If satisfactory rules for the application of
Chapter II of the Convention had been esta-
blished by the First Conference, there would
have been no need for us to discuss them, or
the discussion would, at all events, have been
very short.
This explains why it was decided to convene
the two Conferences almost at the same time.
Unfortunately, matters did not turn out as
was hoped, and, despite the preparatory work
done by the First Conference, the whole ques-
tion has to be dealt with by our Conference.
There can be no technical objection to the
proposal that the Second Conference should
discuss all the questions relating to opium that
are included in the 1912 Convention, especially
as questions such as that of opium for chewing


and of coca leaves were not dealt with by the
First Conference.
Our Conference was convened for two specific
purposes to give effect to the principles sub-
mitted by the United States delegation and
to give effect to the policy adopted by the
League on the recommendation of the Advisory
Committee.
We know what these principles are. They
are to be found on page 202 of Document C.
418. M. 184.
?1. If the purpose of the Hague Opium
Convention is to be achieved according to
its spirit and true intent, it must be recog-
nised that the use of opium products for
other than medicinal and scientific pur-
poses is an abuse and not legitimate.
?2. In order to prevent the abuse of
these drugs, it is necessary to exercise
the control of the production of raw opium
in such a manner that there will be no sur-
plus available for non-medicinal and non-
scientific purposes.?
If I have alluded to these principles, it is
not in order to raise the question of compe-
tence, but simply to confirm my statement that
no decision of the Council or Assembly exists
which sets arbitrary limits to the problem before
us. Otherwise, the present Conference would
have been convened in order to study this or
that article of the Hague Convention, and not
to study the Convention as a whole in the light
of the American principles.
I repeat it would be a different matter if the
provisions of Chapter II were signed only by
the eight States directly concerned. This is
not the case, and the States signatories to the
1912 Convention which are represented at the
Second Conference are competent to discuss
matters relating to the execution, the future and
the amendment of the Convention, and have
a right to insist upon examining the conclusions
reached by the States represented at the First
Conference.
I shall quote a sentence of the United States
delegate, Mr. Porter, who said ; ?There is
nothing sacrosanct in the terms of the invita-
tion addressed to these participating States?.
I think it would be a misfortune if the efforts
of our Second Conference to reach its humani-
tarian goal were to meet with obstacles of a
purely technical character. Practical idealists
have fixed their hopes on this Conference ;
they believe that the outcome will be for the
betterment of humanity and the physical
and moral well-being of suffering mankind.
[Applause.)
The President
Translation : I call upon the Hon. Stephen
G. Porter, delegate of the United States, to
address the Conference.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America)
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the
distinguished delegate for the Netherlands re-
ferred to the fact that we were trying to reform
the world in one day. I must dissent from
that statement, because we are merely asking
that the day be fixed when the performance
of an obligation, solemnly made years ago,
will begin. Idealism has helped the world
a good deal. I do not know whether I am
an idealist or not ; that is a matter for my asso-
ciates and friends.
The Hague Opium Convention was, as a
matter of fact, executed many years ago, and
it has been put into effect, so far as prepared
opium is concerned, by a large majority of the
signatories to that Convention ; we are
merely asking here, not that you pass judgment
upon the merits of this matter, but that you
should consider whether or not the time is
ripe when we have the right to demand that
the nations which have not complied with
Chapter II of the Convention shall fix a defi-
nite date for that compliance.
The Conference will recall that, at its first
plenary meeting, I filed, immediately after
the adoption of the agenda, a declaration on
behalf of the delegation of the United States
of America ; that declaration was noted and
placed on record in the proceedings of the Con-
ference. The declaration to which I refer
reads as follows :
?The United States delegation respect-
fully reserves the right to move that the
agenda be amended in the event of the
First Conference not providing an effective
means for the suppression of the traffic in
prepared opium or failing to reach an
agreement.
?We are confronted with an unfortu-
nate situation which cannot be solved by
an appeal to technicalities. Whether or
not the findings of the First Conference were
to have been reported directly to the
Second Conference, the latter at least
needs to know them in order to deal
effectively with the subject of production.
The First Conference has thus far reached
no agreement, and we have nothing before
us.
? The dictates of common-sense demand
a frank admission of the dilemma in which
this failure to reach an agreement has
placed the Second Conference, and a con-
sideration of the possibility and wisdom
of widening the scope of our discussion to
include the subject of the progressive sup-
pression of the traffic in prepared opium.
The Hague Convention lays the responsi-
bility for this matter upon all the contract-
ing Powers without distinction.
?It is only fair to state that the represen-
tatives of the United States, foreseeing
the possibility of such a situation as has
arisen, consistently contended at the meet-
ings of the Fifth Committee of the Assem-
bly of 1923 for one instead of two Confe-
rences. In view of these facts, the United
States delegation respectfully reserves the
right to move the amendment of the
agenda in the event of the First Conference
not providing an effective means for the
suppression of the traffic in prepared
opium or failing to reach an agreement.?
At the time when the foregoing decluoi}B.re
was made, a doubt existed whether the
First Conference would be able to reach an
agreement with regard to the means to be
adopted for the effective suppression of the
traffic in prepared opium. It now appears
from the draft Convention that the First Con-
ference has finally concluded an agreement
to which, I understand, the signatures are to
be formally affixed on December 13th, 1924.


Since, therefore, the First Conference has gradual and effective suppression of the traffic
practically concluded its work, it becomes
pertinent to enquire whether the agreement
reached accomplishes the purpose for which
the Conference was called.
The United States was not represented at
the First Conference and the question may
naturally arise why the United States is parti-
cularly concerned with what transpired there.
The United States, and most of the Powers
represented here, as well as the countries
represented at the First Conference, are parties
to the International Opium Convention of
1912, which forms the basis of the present
international control of the traffic in opium,
cocaine and their narcotic derivatives. Under
Article 6 of that Convention, the Contracting
Powers solemnly undertake to ?take measures
for the gradual and effective suppression of
the manufacture of, internal trade in, and use
of, prepared opium, with due regard to the
varying circumstances of each country con-
cerned, unless regulations on the subject are
already in existence".
Prior to the conclusion of the Convention,
the importation of prepared opium into the
United States was prohibited by law. This
law, however, did not prevent the importation
of raw opium into the United States for the
purpose of manufacturing prepared opium, and
in many of our large cities prepared opium
was so extensively used as to present a real
problem. In 1914, however, the Congress,
with a view to carrying out the provisions
of the Hague Convention, enacted legislation
which in effect prohibited the use of prepared
opium in the United States, and, to-day, the
prepared opium problem, so far as the United
States is concerned, no longer exists.
I would not have you infer that the United
States is the only nation to take effective mea-
sures to carry out the obligations undertaken
under Article 6 of the Hague Convention,
for it is a matter of common knowledge that
a number of other nations signatory to the Con-
vention have likewise carried out their part
of the agreement. It may, perhaps, be accu-
rate to state that the use of prepared opium
has been effectively stamped out in every
country except in the Far Eastern terri-
tories of the countries represented at the First
Conference.
Ihe United States, or, in fact, any nation
signatory to the Hague Convention which
has fulfilled in good faith the obligations under
that Convention, may, without question, not
only ascertain whether the other signatory
Powers have fulfilled their obligations but may
also insist, should occasion arise, that such
Powers take the steps necessary to that end.
Moreover, a Power which is signatory to the
Hague Convention possesses the further right
to insist that other signatory Powers do not,
by means of supplementary agreements
between themselves or by other means, weaken
the Hague Convention in such a manner as
to release themselves from the fulfilment of
obligations undertaken under that Convention.
The United States cannot admit that any
Power signatory to the Hague Convention
has the right, so long as that Convention
remains in full force, to release itself by a
supplementary agreement from the obligations
undertaken under Article 6 of the Convention,
whereby measures are to be taken for the
in prepared opium.
The United States, and perhaps other
nations, are seriously suffering from ill-effects due
to the leakage in the distribution of enormous
quantities of raw and prepared opium in the
Far Eastern territories, and the only remedy
we have is the right to demand that the nations
represented at the First Conference shall comply
with their agreement, in Chapter II of the
Convention, progressively to suppress this traffic.
Moreover, this is an international conference
through which it would be extremely unfair
to throw every conceivable safeguard around
our own homes and yet leave unprotected the
homes of the peoples described in Article 22
of the Covenant of the League of Nations as
follows ;
? peoples not yet able to stand by
themselves under the strenuous conditions
of the modern world, there should be
applied the principle that the well-being
and development of such peoples form
a sacred trust of civilisation ?
As stated by the distinguished delegate for
Poland
"If there are abuses which can only be
gradually suppressed by making due allow-
ance for the varying conditions of life
in the different countries, we must quite
frankly admit the fact, and point out the
ways and means which we think effective
for rescuing as speedily as possible the
unhappy people who are the victims of
those abuses.
"You will all agree that no State, no
community, no individual is entitled to
found its prosperity upon the misfortunes
of any human being of whatever race,
religion or class."
Or, as stated at an earlier meeting of this Con-
ference, "there must be only one standard
of morality for the world and not two stan-
dards. Not one for the West and another for
the East What is forbidden and punished
with severity in Western lands must not be
excused and defended and promoted in the
East." Such injustice would disturb the peace
of the world.
I desire at this point to invite attention to
Resolution V of the fourth Assembly, which
clearly defines the purposes for which the First
Conference was called. That resolution reads :
"The Assembly approves the proposal of
the Advisory Committee that the Govern-
ments concerned should be invited imme-
diately to enter into negotiations with a
view to the conclusion of an agreement as
to the measures for giving effective appli-
cation in the Far Eastern Territories to
Chapter II of the Convention and as to a
reduction of the amount of raw opium to
be imported for the purpose of smoking
in those territories where it is temporarily
continued, and as to the measures which
should be taken by the Government of the
Republic of China to bring about the sup-
pression of the illegal production and use
of opium in China, and requests the Council
to invite those Governments to send repre-
sentatives with plenipotentiary powers to
a Conference for the purpose and to report
to the Council at the earliest possible date.?


I shall not attempt a detailed analysis of the
effect of the agreement reached by the First
Conference.
In a general way, we have understood from
incomplete reports received from time to
time that the traffic in prepared opium has
appeared to increase rather than decrease as
the years have gone by. As an exception, we
note? from the reports received by the First
Conference, that in Formosa, under the regu-
lations of the Japanese Government, the quan-
tities of prepared opium manufactured have
materially decreased. We have further noted
that, in the opinion of Sir John Jordan, pro-
bably the most eminent authority on the opium
traffic in the Far East, notwithstanding the
Hague Convention, traffic in prepared opium
has not been effectively suppressed and we
expectantly turned to the agreement reached
by the First Conference to ascertain the reason.
It is most significant that the parties to the
agreement concluded by the First Conference
note the fact that the increase of the smuggling
of opium in the greater part of the territory
of the Far East since the ratification of the
Hague Convention is hampering greatly the
accomplishment of the gradual and effective
suppression of the traffic. Is it right that this
should be used as an excuse by these Powers
for their failure to fulfil the obligations under-
taken under the Hague Convention ?
As Sir John Jordan has stated
?The argument will doubtless be urged,
and urged with perfect good reason, that
the widespread recrudescence of poppy
cultivation in China has added immensely
to the difficulties of the problem. That
I freely admit, and no one has more reason
to regret the Chinese relapse than I, who
devoted ten years of my life to the work
of opium suppression. But I would ask
in all earnestness if the fact that China
has fallen into a state of political disorder
is sufficient reason for the other Powers
to evade the obligations which they under-
took under Article 6 of the Hague Conven-
tion. I do not think so.?'
We are in accord with the view of Sir John
Jordan that the failure of China, or any other
country, through internal disorder or other-
wise, to prevent effectively the illicit traffic in
opium does not relieve other Powers signatory
to that instrument from the fulfilment of the
obligations which they have solemnly under-
taken.
Resolution V adopted by the fourth Assem-
bly places squarely before the Governments
represented at the First Conference the consi-
deration of measures which should be taken
by China to bring about the suppression of the
illegal production and use of opium in that
country. What measures were adopted with
that end in view ? None. If China is the
cause of the failure of certain countries to
suppress progressively the traffic in prepared
opium, is it too much to expect that they would
lend China such assistance as might be appro-
priate with a view to suppressing the illegal
production of opium in China, particularly
since that question was upon the agenda of the
Conference ? Yet nothing has been done.
I desire to invite your attention to another
significant fact. Article 6 of the Hague Con-
vention provides that the Powers shall take
measures for the gradual and effective suppres-
sion of the use of prepared opium, with due
regard to the varying circumstances of each
country concerned. The article recognises that
the conditions in one country were not neces-
sarily similar to those obtaining in other coun-
tries and were, if necessary, to be met by diffe-
rent means. Here, however, we have a group
of the most influential nations in the world
accepting an agreement professing to provide
for the adoption of measures for the suppression
of the traffic in prepared opium, many of which
are known to be less effective than the measures
now in operation in several of the countries
represented at the First Conference.
May I ask what country would be proud
of an educational system in which the progress
of a group or class is measured by the intellectual
capabilities of the more inferior individuals
in the class ?
Although the acceptance, by nations furthest
advanced in the effort to suppress the
traffic, of the standards of the nations which
are less advanced in that respect is to be
regretted, the agreement reached by the First
Conference menaces in even a more serious way
the ultimate success of the effort to suppress
effectively the use of prepared opium.
As a result of the agreement, there has been
created a prepared opium ?bloc? or group
consisting of some six or more of the most
powerful nations in the world, all of which under
the agreement agree to establish an almost com-
plete Government monopoly with regard to
the importation, sale and distribution of opium.
I do not here intend to discuss the question
of a Government monopoly as a temporary
expedient for stamping out the prepared opium
traffic or to suggest the internal measures
which a nation should adopt to carry out Article
6 of the Hague Convention. I am, however,
not altogether unfamiliar with the working
of ?blocs? or groups and with the results
which naturally may be expected to follow
their organisation, and I do not hesitate to
say that, so far as I personally am concerned,
I regard the conclusion of an agreement pro-
viding for the organisation of a prepared
opium ?bloc? or group as a decided step
backward in our endeavour to suppress the
traffic in prepared opium and that, by reason
of this agreement, the world is no nearer to-
day, in fact, is further from, its goal than it
was on that fateful day of January 23rd, 1912,
when the nations of the world, for the first
time in history, collectively agreed that the
use of prepared opium should be permitted only
temporarily and decided to take progressive
measures for its effective suppression.
I would again remind the Conference that
Resolution V of the fourth Assembly directed
the First Conference to give consideration
to the measures to be adopted for the reduction
of raw opium to be imported for smoking.
Did the First Conference consider this question ?
Does the agreement reached offer any assurance
that there will be a reduction in the importation
of raw opium to be used for smoking ? If no
such measures have been adopted, if China has
not received the assistance with regard to the
prevention of the illicit production of opium
to which she is justly entitled, if the agreement
does not give effective application in the Far
Eastern Territories to Chapter II of the Hague


Convention, are we not prepared to say that
the First Conference has not satisfactorily
handled the problems which were referred to
it for consideration ?
If the agreement reached is unsatisfactory
to the world at large, is it in fact completely
satisfactory to the Powers which are to sign it ?
Does it in their judgment mark such an advance
in the matter of the suppression of the traffic
in prepared opium that they are justly proud
of the fruitful results which are expected to
flow from their efforts ? If, on the other hand,
the agreement does not afford the most effec-
tive means possible of suppressing the traffic
in prepared opium, if the delegates to the First
Conference are not entirely satisfied with the
agreement that was reached, will they not join
us in the Second Conference in a reconsidera-
tion of the question of the most effective mea-
sures to be taken for the suppression of the
traffic ?
This brings me to the question of competence.
On every occasion when the delegation of
the United States or other delegations have
brought forward proposals aimed at disturbing
the established order, the question of compe-
tence has been raised. The word has lost its
terrors, and I have no hesitation in stating
that the Second Conference, under Resolution
VI of the Assembly, has the competence
to consider the question of prepared opium.
The Conference was called to adopt measures
as a means of giving effect to the following
principle ;
?i. If the purpose of the Hague Opium
Convention is to be achieved according to
its spirit and true intent, it must be recog-
nised that the use of opium products for
other than medicinal and scientific pur-
poses is an abuse and not legitimate.
"2. In order to prevent the abuse of
these drugs, it is necessary to exercise the
control of the production of raw opium
in such a manner that there will be no
surplus available for non-medicinal and
non-scientific purposes/?
It is now no longer proper to speak of these
principles as American, if indeed it was ever
proper to do so. The interpretation urged by
the representatives of the United States before
the Advisory Committee was of course accep-
table to many of the nations signatory to the
Hague Convention. But if, in the beginning,
the foregoing proposals were rightly termed
American, they can no longer be so regarded.
Accepted by the Advisory Committee, by the
Assembly, by the Council, and, I am happy
to say, by the greater number of the nations
here represented, as the principles upon which
the Hague Convention is based, they have
become the principles of this Conference, and
as such I shall hereafter refer to them.
Bearing in mind that we are here under
an invitation extended by the League to carry
these principles into practical effect, how can
we hope to accomplish this result without
consideration of the question of prepared opium ?
In the programme before us we are aiming to
set up elaborate machinery for determining
the medical and scientific needs of the world.
But of what avail will this be unless we know
definitely the amount of raw opium which
is produced for the manufacture of prepared
opium and the definite time when the use of
prepared opium shall come to an end ? Opium
produced for medicinal and scientific purposes
represents but a small part of the total opium
production of the world, and what success
can be hoped to crown our efforts if we merely
endeavour to control the production of medi-
cinal opium and disregard prepared opium ?
We may assume, I believe, that we have been
granted sufficient powers to handle the question
confronting us ; that such powers, expressed
or implied, are sufficient to enable us to consider
and adopt any measures which in our judgment
afford a satisfactory solution of the problems
confronting the Second Conference.
Apart from technical considerations, how-
ever, it must be remembered that the subject
of prepared opium is covered by the Hague
Convention and must be regarded as a phase
of the general problem to which we are called
upon to give attention, and that the delegates who
attended the First Conference are also present
at this Conference. It may, of course, be
urged that a duplication of work would result
if the Second Conference should endeavour
to consider a problem that was fully discussed
in the First Conference. However, I would
remind you that the First Conference, at which
were represented only countries in whose terri-
tories the use of prepared opium is temporarily
permitted, necessarily must have considered
the question of the suppression of the traffic
from a different standpoint from that of this
Conference, at which all nations are represented.
I appeal to the delegates of the First
Conference to lay aside technicalities and to
join us in considering this important problem to
the end that together we may reach a decision
that will not only be satisfactory to ourselves
but will merit the approval of the world at
large.
The President
Translation : M. Bourgois, delegate of
France, will address the Conference.
IVi. Bourgois (France)
Translation : The questions raised by the
proposal of the United States delegation were
dealt with by the First Conference. The
latter arrived at an agreement, which will be
open for signature to-morrow. I think that
these questions could hardly be dealt with
again by the Second Conference on the very
day after the signature of the agreement, with-
out giving rise to an extremely awkward
situation. I agree, therefore, with my collea-
gues who were members of the First Confe-
rence that it will be impossible for us to take
part in any fresh discussion of these matters
in this present Conference.
The President
Translation : M. Ferreira, delegate of Por-
tugal, will address the Conference.
IVJ. Ferreira (Portugal)
Translation : The Portuguese delegation is
of opinion that the proposal submitted by the
United States delegation does not come within
the scope of the programme of the Second
Conference. It begs to state, therefore, that
should this proposal be discussed by the Second
Conference it will be unable like the French,
British and Netherlands delegations to take
part in the proceedings.


Translation : M. Sugimura, delegate of
Japan, will address the Conference.
IVI. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : The Japanese delegation wishes
to make its attitude, as regards this important
matter, perfectly clear.
1 propose to deal first with the position of
the Japanese delegation and the other delega-
tions who took part in the First Opium Confe-
rence. I shall then go on to consider the juri-
dical position of the many delegations which
are members of the Second Conference alone.
In the invitation addressed to the Japanese
Government by the Secretary-General of the
League, a distinction was made between the
First and Second Opium Conferences. The
First Conference was convened in virtue of
the fourth Assembly?s fifth resolution, the
Second Conference in virtue of the sixth reso-
lution. The Japanese Government, therefore,
gave separate instructions as regards the two
Conferences.
It is true that Japan is represented by the
same delegates at both these Conferences, but
juridically their mission is not the same in
both cases. As members of the Second Confer-
ence, we have no power to interfere with the
decisions of the First Conference. If it were
decided now to make any change whatsoever
in the provisions of the Agreement or Protocol
drawn up by the First Conference, the Japanese
delegation could take no part in such a decision.
The same applies, I think, to all the delegations
who were members of the First Conference.
As regards the many delegations taking part
only in the work of the Second Conference, their
juridical position is not quite the same. I
would point out, however, that the invitation
addressed by the League to their Governments
referred only to the fourth Assembly?s sixth
resolution. States Members of the League
are all acquainted with the terms of the fifth
resolution, which their delegates collaborated
in drafting. They are therefore implicitly
bound by it.
The position is different as regards non-
Members of the League. They have before
them only the fourth Assembly?s sixth reso-
lution and the Hague Convention. That great
charter of humanitarian effort against the
scourge of opium and other drugs includes
all drugs. There is no distinction between
Chapter II and other chapters of the Conven-
tion. It is natural, therefore, that these dele-
gations, whose work is based on the principles
of the Hague Convention, should place a wide
interpretation on the terms of the sixth reso-
lution of the fourth Assembly.
From the point of view of humanitarian
idealism, they are perhaps the more fully jus-
tified, in that the First Conference did not
achieve the desired results, namely, the total
suppression of the opium scourge. It did not
even succeed in creating a really effective
system for the progressive abolition of opium.
The drafting of a second charter would consti-
tute a further obstacle. I feel morally bound,
therefore, to congratulate the supporters of
this humanitarian view, though I must main-
tain my position as regards the legal aspect of
the matter. I shall listen in silence, but with
the keenest interest and sympathy, to their
opinions, which are inspired by a truly huma-
nitarian spirit.
No delegate has the right to restrict the deli-
berations which are being pursued here in the
interests of all mankind. Compassion and
magnanimity are the supreme virtues of the
great religious leaders of mankind, such as
Buddha, Mahomet and, above all, Christ. They
bid us show generosity in the accomplishment
of the great task of justice and social welfare
entrusted to us by the League. [Applause).
The President
Translation : M. Pernambuco, delegate of
Brazil, will address the Conference.
IV!. Pernambuco (Brazil) :
Translation : The Brazilian delegation sup-
ports the United States proposal. As a signa-
tory to the Hague Convention, Brazil has taken
strict measures to suppress the use of drugs
and we are working side by side with those
who are fighting against the abuse of these
substances. We have come here determined to
co-operate in arriving at a decision.
The United States delegate declared that it
would be most unfair to surround homes in
Europe and America with every possible safe-
guard while those in Asia were left unprotected.
There must be only one standard for the world,
and not one for the West and another for the
East. He declared, too, that in spite of the
Hague Convention, ?the traffic in prepared
opium appeared to increase rather than decrease
as the years have gone by??.
We must keep our humanitarian object
before us and use every means in our power
to save the unhappy victims of drugs. If
we can do this, we shall have done our duty.
[Applause).
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Sze, delegate
of China, to address the Conference.
IV!. Sze (China)
Mr. President and members of the Confe-
rence, owing to the lateness of the hour I
do not propose this afternoon to discuss the
many points which have been raised by the
different speakers to-day. I shall reserve that
pleasure for a subsequent occasion.
When I received a copy of the agenda this
morning, I did not expect that there would
be so much of a tempest in the teacup this
afternoon. I thought that questions of a
similar nature had been discussed before when
the American delegation submitted Article i
and Article g-A of their proposals to this Con-
ference. I therefore thought it would be
unnecessary for me to trespass upon your
time by preparing a set speech to read to you.
As I am not going to read any special paper,
I just want to put on record one or two state-
ments which I think I ought to make clear to
you. ,
First of all, I consider that the First Confe-
rence, unhappily and unfortunately, has not
come to the conclusions that we all would have
liked to see. Even so distinguished and so
expert an authority as my distinguished friend
the chief delegate of the British Empire told
you this afternoon that the work of the First
Conference was not as satisfactory as he could
have wished ; I would like to ask any and
The President


every member of the First Conference if they
do not agree with the distinguished chief dele-
gate of the British Empire. I certainly do.
It would be unfair on my part if I did not tell
you so. My distinguished friend from Great
Britain, however, has preceded me, so I simply
want to confirm what he has said, namely,
that the work of the First Conference has,
unfortunately and unhappily, been very unsatis-
factory.
My second point is this. The present Confe-
rence is fully competent to take up the question
of Chapter II of the Hague Convention or
Chapter II of the American proposals. I need
not dwell upon any of the arguments which
have been brought forward. Some arguments
were given the other day by some of the
speakers who are more eloquent than I am, so I
content myself by simply repeating in one
single sentence that I consider that this Confe-
rence is fully competent to consider Chapter II
of the American proposals.
While I do not propose, in view of the late-
ness of the hour, to discuss the various points
which have been raised by the different dele-
gations, there is one point which was raised
by Mr. Porter about which I must lose no time
in saying a few words, in order that there may
be no misunderstanding.
Mr. Porter read to you the fifth resolution of
the fourth Assembly, in which are mentioned
the measures to be taken by China. If we
all read carefully the wording of that resolu-
tion, we shall see that it was for China herself to
take the measures. I want that fact to be
clearly understood, and I beg those of you
who have not yet read Resolution V care-
fully to do so now. The measures were mea-
sures to be taken by China herself, and that
question was thoroughly discussed in the First
Conference when I gave an assurance in
language which was as clear and definite as pos-
sible ; that assurance was accepted by the
First Conference.
In order to prove to you that the assurance I
gave to the First Conference has already had
good results and to prove that what I say is
true as regards China, I beg to read to you a
telegram which has been received by the
Chinese people?s representative to the Opium Con-
ference. Yesterday, he handed me a telegram
which he had received from the National Anti-
Opium Association of Shanghai dated December
10th, 1924. That telegram states that, accor-
ding to the latest statistics, 750 cities are now
participating in the anti-opium work and that
in this campaign there are now three thousand
organisations with a membership of three
million people. May Ibe permitted to remind
you that, within the last month, Mr. Koo,
our people?s representative, received another
telegram giving statistics, and instead of 750
cities there were then only 300 ; instead of
3,000 organisations, there were only 2,000 at
that time, and instead of three million people,
there were then only one million people parti-
cipating in anti-opium work. Is that not a
miracle ?
I want to ask you if there is any other country
represented in this room which is taking so
active and so earnest a part in endeavouring
to put an end to opium, drugs and other evils ?
I challenge anybody to say that, in their coun-
try, so much has been done within so short
a time.
Further information is given in the telegram
to which I have just referred and I want
to mention one more point, which is this ;
Since the result of the First Conference has
been known in China, mass meetings have
been held, and those mass meetings have ex-
pressed in clear language what they think of the
results of the First Conference. You will be
surprised to hear, but nevertheless it is the
fact, that more space is given in the Chinese
Press to-day, with the possible exception of the
American Press, to the work of the Opium
Conference at Geneva than is given in the Press
of any other country. Is that not a remarkable
fact ? Although we have not so many repor-
ters at this Conference as some of the other
nations, I am proud to say that China is giving
careful attention to the work of this Confe-
rence and is watching it with an attention
which is perhaps only surpassed by the United
States of America.
Mr. Porter has made an appeal to the Second
Conference, inviting it to deal with Chapter II
of the United States suggestions. Mr. Porter,
I want to assure you, and I want to assure other
delegations who spoke in favour of the proposal,
that China is ready to second the efforts of
any delegation in order that the evils from
which this world has been suffering, and from
which it is suffering now, may be removed. My in-
structions are explicit that I am to come here
and co-operate with everybody and anybody
whose aim is to put an end to these drug and
opium evils.
Mr. Porter mentioned the help that other
Powers might give to China. China will appre-
ciate any help which is really a help ; but
the only form of help which, I think, the Powers
can give to China in this great campaign is
by taking some measures in their own terri-
tories which will react beneficially on China.
There is the line of action ; that is the point.
I appeal to those Powers who have participated
in the First Conference that this is the road
to follow.
One of the speakers to-day placed the mem
bers of the Conference more or less in two
classes. One class he mentioned as idealists
and another class as experts. I do not know
whether he has in mind a third class, ?indif-
ferents.? I would rather any day be called
an idealist than be an expert who will not
help the world to put an end to this opium
and drug evil. I would rather any day be
called an idealist than shut my eyes to the suf-
ferings of large numbers of my countrymen
who are now residing in the territories and the
possessions of European Powers in the Far
East and who have the opportunity of lega-
lised opium-smoking. The number is not small.
They are not counted by tens, by hundreds of
thousands, or by tens of thousands ; they
are counted by hundreds of thousands. I
am willing any day to be called an idealist rather
than an expert if I can help some of my poor
countrymen.
In one of the official reports presented by
one of the delegations, it was stated that many
of my unfortunate countrymen had acquired
the opium habit abroad, and that the percen-
tage was in some cases as high as 85.
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, you
cannot blame me for being solicitous about
my afflicted fellow-countrymen, especially when
I tell you that the number is not counted by


tens or hundreds or thousands or tens of
thousands, but by hundreds of thousands.
Therefore, Mr. Porter, and you, gentlemen, who
are supporting him, I wish to say that I am
ready, with you, to urge this Conference that
something should be done in regard to this
matter. Do not let technicalities block our
way. Let us listen to and follow the demand
of humanity. Let us have a conscience and
say that something shall be done.
The President :
Translation: M. Clayton, delegate of India,
will address the Conference.
IVIr. Clayton (India)
Mr. President and gentlemen, the question
which is to be discussed here is, as I see it,
purely one of technicality and of procedure.
I do not therefore propose to follow, in all
its details, the speech of the honourable dele-
gate of the United States, although, were it
in order so to do, I might have much to say
upon it.
The particular proposal before the Conference
does not concern India closely ; but I come
from the one among the provinces of India
which has been, in the American proposals,
even more hardly treated or, shall we say, has
been asked to reach an even higher level of
idealism than the ideal which Mr. Porter has
held up before other countries now temporarily
consuming opium. I come from the province
of Burma, which possesses a very efficient
system partly of prohibition and partly of
control. Under Mr. Porter?s proposal, from
the date on which the Convention is signed,
prepared opium will be prohibited in Burma.
Now, Sir, I venture, with great diffidence,
to criticise the knowledge of League procedure
possessed by other delegations. The represen-
tatives of the United States hold a great posi-
tion in their country. They have been fre-
quent visitors to Geneva. They are, I
may say, steeped in the League atmosphere.
I am a newcomer. This is my first visit to
Geneva. But I must say that, when I first
came here, I thought that it would be the reso-
lutions of the Assembly that would govern
Conferences called by the Council of the League.
I find that I was mistaken. I set forth in
some detail, in a speech I made a week or so
ago, arguments to that end. I have never
heard a reply to them. They have been com-
pletely and absolutely ignored.
But while I have been at Geneva my education
has been progressing and I have discovered that,
if there is any doubt or uncertainty here as
to the terms of a resolution, one calls in the
Rapporteur. I have before me the report sub-
mitted by the Fifth Committee to the fourth
Assembly. The Rapporteur was Mile. Bonnevie,
delegate of Norway. .1 think that if there should
be, as there apparently is, some doubt in the
minds of some of the members as to what the
actual meaning of the resolution is, they will,
when they have read the particularly clear report
of Mile. Bonnevie, understand it more clearly.
On page 355 of the Official Journal of the
League of Nations, Special Supplement No. 13,
the following paragraph occurs :
?The Fifth Committee has learned from
the reports of the Advisory Committee
that it has found the time ripe for taking
measures towards a more effective appli-
cation of Chapter II of the Opium Con-
vention concerning the 'gradual suppres-
sion? of the use of prepared opium in
territories where such use has not yet been
prohibited, as well as to a reduction of
the quantity of raw opium imported into
these territories for the purpose of smoking.
?Basing itself on a resolution passed by
the Advisory Committee, the Fifth Com-
mittee proposes that a Conference should
be called for this purpose (Resolution 5).?
Resolution 5 says
? representatives with plenipotentiary
powers to a conference for the purpose and
to report to the Council.??
Mr. President, I have never yet heard that
plenipotentiaries were required to report to
other plenipotentiaries. It appears to be the
contention of the United States delegation that
the duty of the First Conference, composed of
delegates armed with plenipotentiary powers,
was to report to the Second Conference, com-
posed of delegates also armed with plenipoten-
tiary powers. The First Conference was
specifically ordered to report not to the Second
Conference but to the Council, and I suggest
that this Conference, if it proposes itself to
intervene between the First Conference and the
Council, will commit what I can only describe
as an impertinence.
The next paragraph (g) of Mile. Bonnevie?s
report reads as follows :
?With great satisfaction, we read in
the report that the Advisory Committee,
in reviewing the work carried out during
the past two years, has found that the infor-
mation now available makes it possible to
take steps towards a limitation of the pro-
duction of the drugs. It has proposed that
the Governments concerned in such pro-
duction should enter into immediate nego-
tiations to consider whether an agreement
could be reached on this point.??
The Fifth Committee recommended that a
resolution should be passed to the effect that
a Conference should be called and also suggested
that the Council should consider ?the advisa-
bility of enlarging the Conference so as to
include within its scope all countries which are
Members of the League or Parties to the Con-
vention of 1912, with a view to securing their
adhesion to the principles that may be embodied
in any agreement reached.??
If it had been the intention of the Fifth
Committee of the Assembly that the Second
Conference should call under review the whole
operation of the Hague Convention, frankly,
I cannot imagine why the Rapporteur should
not have said so in her report. It seems per-
fectly clear that Mile. Bonnevie was under the
impression that the agenda of this Conference
should be entirely concerned with the limitation
of the production of drugs. It seems to me
that, in view of the statements of the Rappor-
teur, no other interpretation of the resolutions
than that held by the honourable delegate
of Great Britain, and by those delegates who
have agreed with him, can possibly be admitted.
It is further to be noted that the United
States representatives were present throughout
the proceedings of the Fifth Committee, and


I cannot imagine that Mile. Bonnevie?s report effective as she considered our response to her.
can have been submitted to the Assembly
without the United States delegation being
perfectly well aware of what w T as contained
in it. I suggest, in fact I feel convinced, that
the extracts from the report- which I have just
read definitely settle the matter and show that
this Second Conference has no competence
whatever to deal with the subjects assigned
to the First Conference.
There is only one further point to which
I wish to allude. The honourable delegate
for China has taken this opportunity to express
the wish of his country to help her co-nationals
in the territories of other Powers. At the First
Conference China expressed good-will. We all
recognise that, under the unfortunate circum-
stances prevailing in that country, it was
extremely difficult for her to express anything else
but good-will. She laboured under the same
difficulties as ourselves. When we, in our turn,
had to ask China to help us in our difficulties,
I am afraid the response of China was as in-
I would remind M. Sze that he was asked by
the delegation of India whether he could suggest
any steps that could be taken at once to stop
smuggling across her borders. M. Sze replied
that his answer would be given at another
time. I have not yet heard that answer.
Frankly, I agree with him that, probably in
the conditions that at present prevail, it would
be extremely difficult to suggest any effective
measures. The fact is that, in the First
Conference, China and the other Powers were
in the same case. We all did our best, and the
Convention which will be signed to-morrow is
the result of our work.
The President
Translation : There- are still four delegates
who desire to speak. I think that, as it is so
late, it would be best to adjourn the meeting
and to meet again to-morrow at 10.30 a.m.
{Assent.)
The Conference rose at 7 p.m.
FIFTEENTH MEETING

DELEGATION : CONTINUATION OF
THE DISCUSSION.
The President
Translation : Ladies and gentlemen, the
meeting is now open.
The first member on the list of speakers this
morning is the Chilian delegate. As he is
prevented by illness from being present, he
has asked to have his statement read by the
Secretary.
{The Secretary of the Conference read the fol-
lowing statement from the Chilian delegate) :
?The Chilian delegation is entirely in
favour of the United States proposal,
which it considers gives perfect expression
to the humanitarian ideals of the Second
Conference, the object of which is to sup-
press the illicit use of opium, cocaine
and other dangerous drugs. These ideals
have the support of all the American
peoples.
?The Chilian delegation hereby declares,
in the name of its Government, that it is
firmly resolved loyally to co-operate in
the practical realisation of the humanitarian
ideals expressed in the United States
proposal.
?We have arrived at a stage of civili-
sation at which it is impossible for us to
remain indifferent to the problem before
the Conference, and for the sake of the
welfare of mankind it is impossible for
us to reject the solution proposed by the
United States delegation. To do so would
be fatal not only to the Conference but
to the League of Nations itself.? {Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. Chodzko, delegate of Po-
land, will address the Conference.
IVS. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gen-
tlemen, our discussion yesterday dealt with the
Agreement reached by the First Conference.
Nearly all the delegates have explained their
point of view regarding the matter. As I
have the greatest respect for the members
of the First Conference, I do not propose to
offer any criticism of the Agreement, especially
as I share the views of the Japanese and
Chinese delegates, who are among those mem-
bers and have said all there is to be said. The
British delegate, with the sincerity which
we all appreciate, expressed his regret that the
First Conference had not dealt, among other
questions, with that of the limitation of produc-
tion. I think that he was quite right and
venture to direct your attention to this point.
In the Agreement drawn up by the First
Conference there is no mention of the limitation
of production, of measures to be taken in re-
gard to opium for eating or of the limitation


of production of coca leaves, the scourge of principle should not be applied at the Second
modern times. I would ask you, then, what
Conference is competent to deal with these
questions ? The Uruguayan delegate raised
this point yesterday. It is still pending. We
have not yet received any information on the
matter.
If you read Article II of the Agreement, you
will see that it refers to the prohibition of the
sale of opium to minors. I think it should be
stated whether opium for smoking or opium
for eating is meant, for the question of opium
for smoking does not appear to me to be so
important in the case of minors.
In the same article we read that all possible
measures will be taken by the Contracting
Powers to prevent the spread of the habit of
opium smoking among minors.
Article 111 provides that ?No minor shall
be permitted to enter any smoking divan.?
We may conclude, therefore, that what is
meant is opium for smoking. It is well known,
however, that in India, for example, minors
do not smoke opium but chew it, and even very
young children take it. At Bombay there is
an administrative regulation permitting the
preparation of special opium pills, ?bala
gooli?, which are sold for children with the
permission of the authorities. In India chil-
dren are given opium at the age of two months
and continue to take it up to the age of three
or four years.
Does Article II of the Agreement cover this
use or not ? If it does not, the question of
opium for eating is still unsettled, and I should
like to know what Conference is supposed to
deal with it. Perhaps a third !
As you will see, there are still other questions
which were not dealt with by the First Confe-
rence, but none the less are included in Chapter
II of the Hague Convention and are specifi-
cally mentioned in Article 6. If these questions
were not dealt with by the First Conference,
they should be discussed by the Second Confe-
rence.
In the British delegate?s speech, there was
a passage which led me to hope that we might
perhaps find a means of conciliation as regards
this difficult problem, which our colleagues
who are members of the First Conference refuse
even to discuss with us. Their attitude places
us in a difficult position, for it makes it impos-
sible to arrive at any agreement.
The British delegation has informed us that
its Government would agree to commissions
of investigation being sent to the various pro-
ducing countries.
The President
Translation : I would venture to point out
to the Polish delegate that Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne?s remarks should not be taken as a
formal declaration.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : In that case, I shall take Sir
Malcolm?s statement as a declaration of prin-
ciple.
I have no reason to depart from the attitude
which I explained to you at our meeting on
December ist. Since, at the Hague Conference,
the States now represented at the First Confe-
rence raised no objection to the question of
prepared opium being discussed by the States
not directly concerned, I do not see why this
Conference, which is an International Confe-
rence just as the Hague Conference was.
I therefore support the United States pro-
posal. ( Applause .)
The President
Translation : I call upon Prince Arfa-ed-
Dowleh, delegate of Persia, to address the
Conference,
Prince Arfa-Ed-Dowleh (Persia)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, the proposal of the United States
delegation has been before us for two days.
Each of the delegations has given its opinion
on this important question and I hope I may
also be allowed to say a few words on it.
The position of Persia towards the United
States is quite clear. As I have stated on more
than one occasion, my Government is in agree-
ment with the principles submitted by the
United States delegation, whose humanitarian
proposals we fully support. We have no further
reservations to add to those set forth in the
memorandum which I submitted to the Confe-
rence about a month ago. We do not yet know,
unfortunately, what will be the outcome of
our request.
We would not for a moment delude the Confe-
rence by empty words or vain promises. We
have come here with the firm intention of
co-operating sincerely with all the members,
on the basis of the principles submitted by the
United States delegation. Whatever promises
we make, we mean to keep. We have in no
way concealed the difficulty of our position.
It is useless to ask a country to perform more
than is within its power. The Conference
and the United States must help us to emerge
victorious from the fight against opium
that universal scourge. It is no use sending
soldiers against the enemy without arming them
for the fray ; if the Conference really wishes
to get to work and destroy this enemy of
mankind, it must give us the means of con-
ducting the campaign. We have come in all
sincerity to offer our services and have shown
the kind of battle in which we are prepared to
engage. The enemy has designs not only on
Persia but also on Europe and America and
on Asia, Africa and Australia. No one can
remain neutral in this struggle ; all must
join forces against the common foe.
I hope that the Conference and the Committees
and Sub-Committees will not delay discussion
of our proposal and that Sub-Committee B will
deal with our memorandum as soon as possible
and endeavour to find a means of crushing
this world enemy. {Applause.)

Dr. Duarte (Venezuela)
Translation : Mr. President, I wish to
make the following statement :
The Venezuelan delegation supports the Uni-
ted States proposal without reservation, for the
reasons set forth by the distinguished delegates
who have already spoken. I think that there
are no legal grounds for prohibiting discussion
of the American proposal and I feel that, if
it were removed from our agenda and not


fully discussed, it would mean the failure of
the Second Conference.

gate of the United States of America, will address

Mrs. Hamilton Wright (United States of
America)
Many of us have often wondered why it takes
so long to solve the opium problem. It has
been bothering the conscience of the right-
minded people of the world for a century and
a-half, and during the discussions that have
recently taken place at Geneva it has seemed
not improbable that another century might
elapse before we arrive at any definite results.
There is something wrong somewhere
either in the method or in the spirit in which
the problem is being approached.
Sixty years ago we were faced in America
with a problem which was just as grave as
the opium problem, just as injurious to human
beings, and just as deeply entrenched in the
financial fabric of the nation. At the critical
moment, however, there came a man named
Lincoln, into whose hands the problem passed
for solution a very wise and human man
who insisted always that the slavery question
could never be solved until it was rightly solved,
that it was no use groping for some middle
course between right and wrong.
I believe that this is the answer to the
opium riddle. The reason why it has never been
solved is because we have never tried to solve
it rightly. Just as the Government in America
could not, in Lincoln?s opinion, endure half-
slave and half-free man, so the opium problem
will never be solved while one-half the world is
in bondage and the other half free.
This opium problem has imposed definite
and dual obligations upon us- ?one towards our
own people of the West and one towards those
peoples of the East, or as we have often heard
quoted ?those colonies and territories
which are inhabited by peoples not yet able
to stand by themselves, whose well-being and
development should form a sacred trust of
civilisation??. We believe that the time has
come to put these principles into effect.
There can be no question that what is poison
to a man in the West is also poison to a man in
the East. We have the word of science that
there is no difference, in the reaction to drugs,
between Orientals and Occidentals. We must
therefore have common regulations, mutually
enforced. There can be no moral right in one
man making a slave of another, and the man
who is a slave to drugs is the most pitiful of
all bondmen. It is an untenable theory of
taxation that a people can thrive and endure
on their own moral and physical degradation
a paradox that men should live on their own
death.
I believe that we shall never solve this problem
until we change our standards, until we are
prepared to view it not in isolated fragments
but as a complete whole until we are as
anxious to guard the health and well-being
of the East as of the West, until we apply
the same laws and safeguards to the one as to
the other. The secondary and futile restric-
tions which are discussed day after day and
year after year are the regulations to be applied
to the ordinary merchandise of everyday com-
merce. Always the question is dealt with in
terms of dollars and cents, of weights and mea-
sures. This is why we make no progress, why
the opium problem has never been solved.
The methods we have chosen, the terms in
which we speak, are applicable to things in
bulk, to inanimate matter, not to the welfare of
human beings, who in the final analysis, have
become the commodity with which this pro-
blem deals.
Is it not fair to ask why we have met here
at Geneva ? Is it to put into effect the Hague
Convention to amend it, if necessary to
hasten in fact its execution and so rid the world
of a recognised curse and evil ? Or is it through
one excuse or another to evade our obligations
for another century and a-half ?
Is the ?effective suppression?? of that per-
nicious form of opium known as smoking
opium to be finally terminated, as was the inten-
tion of the Convention ? Cannot we fix some
approximate time-limit, or are we to take advan-
tage of the inability of others to carry out
their obligations, to continue for a further inde-
finite period of time the leisurely course of the
?gradual suppression?? of this obnoxious form
of opium ?
Are we to reduce the present huge over-
cultivation of opium to the medical and scien-
tific needs of the world, as the Assembly pro-
posed, and, if so, how and when ? We know
that it cannot be done immediately, but, frankly,
is the attempt to be made ?
These are the fundamental questions with
which it was understood that the present Con-
ference was to deal, the questions which the
world is insistently asking to have answered.
It is because we hoped and expected to have
them answered that the Government of the
United States sent delegates to participate in
this Conference at Geneva. (Loud applause.)
The President
Translation : M. Bourgois, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : Last year the French Govern-
ment, foreseeing what is actually taking place
now, proposed that there should only be one
Conference. It urged this view with some
insistence in the Advisory Committee, before
the Council and at the Fifth Committee of
the fourth Assembly, and gave way only in
face of the otherwise unanimous decision of
the latter.
In spite of this, when the American delega-
tion submitted its proposal yesterday, I had
not the slightest hesitation in supporting my
colleagues on the First Conference.
My attitude is explained by the fact that
since last year the position has changed. The
French Government bowed before the unani-
mous decision of the Assembly, sent represen-
tatives to both Conferences and even, yesterday,
concluded an agreement. My duty was perfectly
simple and perfectly clear. I could not allow
that agreement to be broken, as it would be
if all the questions submitted to the First Con-
ference were brought up again here. An agree-
ment is an agreement. Once our word has
been given, it cannot be broken.
But is it really necessary for me to try to
convince you of the justice of my views ? I


give you the solemn assurance that never for
one moment did it occur to me that any one
of you, placed in the same position as myself
and my colleagues of the First Conference,
would not have acted exactly as we have done.
You, too, would have said, as we have said,
that an agreement is an agreement and that
the pledged word cannot be broken. What we
have all done, you would have done. It
would be an insult to suppose otherwise.
I make no effort, therefore, to convince you ;
it would be superfluous. I simply wish to ask
you to bear in mind the difficulties of our posi-
tion, when you come to take your decision.
Your sense of statesmanship cannot fail to
find a solution.
The President
Translation : M. Pinto-Escalier, delegate
of Bolivia, will address the Conference.
ML Pinto-Escalier (Bolivia)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, I shall not keep you long. The
motion of the United States delegation con-
cerning the Agreement drawn up by the First
Opium Conference has raised a question which
most of the speakers have considered from its
dual aspect legal and moral.
The legal aspect has been discussed at length
by persons qualified to speak on the matter.
I do not therefore propose to refer to it again.
The moral aspect, however, has become of
such importance that it can hardly be made
subordinate to purely formal or legal conside-
rations, without jeopardising the fundamental
principles which led to the convening of this
Conference.
I venture to think that, in the present case,
the legal factor, important though it is, must
not be allowed to keep us from the real aim for
which we are striving.
I think that all possible light should be
thrown upon the questions submitted to us,
whether explicitly or by implication. My only
fear is that decisions may be taken before all
means of arriving at the truth have been ex-
hausted. If, as the outcome of our joint proceed-
ings, we are called upon to make sacrifices, we
must accept those sacrifices as a duty towards
society.
The Bolivian delegation therefore supports the
proposal submitted by the United States dele-
gation. {Applause).
The President :
Translation: M. de Aguero y Bethancourt,
delegate of Cuba, will address the Conference.
Ml. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, there are debates upon which one
enters with a light heart and in an eager and
alert, combative spirit. That is not the case
with us at present. One enters upon this debate
at least I do not for the pleasure of addres-
sing you, but solely from a sense of duty. If
my conscience did not urge me to take part in
this discussion, I can assure you that I would
have remained passive, content to listen to the
eloquent speeches of those who have preceded
me on this platform. But I cannot remain
silent at a moment of such decisive importance
for this Conference.
I feel that the time has come when each of
us must examine his conscience, put in the scales
the constitutional and the moral factors of
the question and take a decision inspired by
the highest principles of equity and justice.
It is in a calm frame of mind that we ought
to approach the detailed analysis of this ques-
tion, for we are walking on a road bordered to
the right and to the left by precipices. We
have before us two conflicting principles :
the American proposals, on the one hand, and
the firm resistance which I respect of the
members of the First Conference, on the other.
It would seem, ladies and gentlemen, that
we are classified by this divergence. Yet it
is very difficult to establish a classification of
political and social organisations such as
ours. Even as regards scientific principles,
classifications have never attained perfection.
From the old classification of matter into four ele-
ments to the periodical classification of Mende-
leff, who groups the elements in series accor-
ding to their atomic weight, no chemical clas-
sification has attained absolute accuracy. The
same is true of natural history and other sciences.
Flere we have been classified in two groups
the group of experts and the group of idealists.
Other classifications might indeed be established,
or different names might be given to these
two groups. The importance given to the
humanitarian aspect of the question by each
of the two groups might again be expressed
synthetically by means of two equations,
namely :
Humanitarian interest material inte-
rest = x for the experts,
Humanitarian interest = x -\~ material
interest for the idealists.
These equations, of which one is negative
and the other positive, express exactly, from
the mathematical point of view, the attitude of
each of the two groups towards the question
which we are discussing.
But I do not desire to enter into the question
of classification. I accept the classification
willingly and declare my readiness to belong
to the idealist group. After all, this group
constitutes the majority of the present meeting.
Why does it constitute that majority ? Because
all the countries of America, Asia and Europe,
which have no material interests to defend in
the matter and which, indeed, have no material
interests at stake in the League of Nations,
have joined the League and have taken part
in this Conference solely for the good of huma-
nity and under the inspiration of the ideals
of peace and justice.
We are proud to be called idealists, for many
great men have been so called before us for
having had the courage of their opinions. The
appellation was given to Christopher Columbus
because, in spite of the warnings of the scien-
tific authorities of his day, he was resolved to
traverse the stormy sea to discover a continent,
in the existence of which people refused to believe,
but which has since contributed to the pro-
gress and welfare of the old continents of
Europe and Asia.
The idealists, again, include Fernando Cortez,
Nunez de Balboa, Valdivia, Pizarro and the other
?conquistadors? who became the masters of
Mexico and of the rest of the Hispano-American
continent, while pursuing their noble ideal of
propagating the Christian faith and conquering


an empire of which Charles V could say : ?The
sun does not set upon my dominions??.
Other idealists were the men of the Mayflower,
who, abandoning their homes, separating them-
selves from their families and renouncing the
pleasures of Old England, risked their lives and
crossed the Atlantic to settle in unknown lands,
where they were exposed to the rigours of the
climate, the attacks of native tribes and privations
consequent upon lack of resources, in order that
they might realise their noble ideal and practise
their religion and their faith in freedom.
Idealists, again, are all those who have sacri-
ficed themselves for the advancement of science
or its application, such as Dr. Bergonier, who
has just been decorated with the Grand Cross
of the Legion of Honour for having deliberately
sacrificed his life by giving radium treatment
to his patients. Idealists also are all innovators
who have endeavoured to fight against the
prejudices of their time, in order to establish
new theories by which scientific phenomena
might be explained or philosophical problems
solved.
Among them we may mention the great
Lavoisier, the author of the principle of
the conservation of matter and the first to
use the balance in laboratory experiments.
Thanks to his work, the foundations of
the science which we call Chemistry were
laid. Lammarck was called an idealist when
he submitted to the Academy of Science at
Paris his theories concerning heredity and
adaptation to environment. Darwin was
another idealist when he formulated his theory
concerning natural selection and the origin
of species. Pasteur, again, was called an ideal-
ist by the medical leaders of his time and
met with violent opposition for having put
forward his theory on fermentation, which
made it possible to manufacture wine and beer
more rapidly and more cheaply, for having, by
this theory, laid the foundations of bacteriology,
whereby medical science was revolutionised
and great progress was made in the diagnosis,
treatment and prophylaxis of infectious diseases,
and whereby it has been made possible in
agriculture to subject land to the process of
nitrification by the action of nitrifying bacilli.
Christ himself was called an idealist for having
preached the love of one?s neighbour, for having
upheld the principles of justice and equality,
for having overthrown paganism and for having
raised the moral and social position of women.
This idealism reached its culminating point
when, before expiring on the cross of Golgotha,
Jesus, in order to save those who had tortured
him, cried out ; ?Father, forgive them, for
they know not what they do!??
We also have been called idealists, but as we
are following in the footsteps of such glorious
predecessors, we may, fortified by their example,
approach without hesitation the examination
of the American proposal that the Second
Conference be declared competent to discuss
Article 8 of the suggestions of the United States.
The principle involved is, as you are aware,
supported by all the idealist members of this
Conference.
We ought now to analyse this point of view.
I do not claim to be able to lay any fresh argu-
ments before you, for the question has already
been discussed with great eloquence by preced-
ing speakers. I must, however, express my
astonishment that the competence of the Second
Conference should again be under discussion.
The invitation was addressed by the League
of Nations to the various Powers ?as a means
of giving effect to the principles submitted by
the representatives of the United States of
America??. Article 8 forms part of these prin-
ciples and therefore falls within the sphere
of our competence. If the Assembly had
wished to restrict our sphere of action, instead
of saying in its sixth resolution, ?as a means
of giving effect to the principles submitted by
the United States of America??, it would have
said ?as a means of giving effect to the principles
submitted by the United States of America
with the exception of the articles which relate
to the programme of the First Conference?,
i.e., the articles relating to Chapter II of the
Hague Convention of 1912. There is no
mention of any exception in the sixth resolution ;
we are therefore clearly within the limits of
our competence.
If to-day we were to refuse to permit the
discussion of Article 8, we should not be acting
logically, because, a few days ago, we permitted
the discussion of Article 1 and referred it for
examination to one of our Sub-Committees.
Article 1 directly relates to Chapter II of the
Hague Convention of 1912. That means, there-
fore, that we have also permitted the discus-
sion of questions connected with Chapter 11.
There is yet a further precedent. You agreed
to consider the proposal of the Cuban Govern-
ment, which also relates to the same chapter,
because it says that, in order to combat the
scourge of toxicomania, it is essential to restrict
the production of raw materials and the manu-
racture of narcotics to the scientific and medical
fequirements as declared by each State. This
proposal has been referred to Sub-Committees
A, B and D.
I have now finished my examination of the
constitutional aspect of the problem and I
shall pass to the question of formal procedure,
which I consider to be quite as important.
I have listened attentively to the speeches
of the members of the First Conference, and
particularly to that of the Japanese delegate,
M. Sugimura, whose wisdom, moderation and
courtesy profoundly impressed me. The sin-
cerity with which the members of the First
Conference have expressed their feelings deserves
our respect and consideration. They have
urged the special position in which their coun-
tries are placed from the legal point of view.
M. Sugimura went further : he declared that
he understood how it was that the other dele-
gations present, who were not members of the
First Conference, believed that the programme
of the Second Conference was wider in scope
and enabled them to discuss in detail all the
articles of the American proposals. The First
Conference consisted only of eight members,
while the Second consists of 40 delegations, of
whom 32 did not take part in the work of the
First Conference. They have, however, come
from all parts of the world to co-operate in
an enterprise the sole object of which is to
protect mankind against the ravages caused
by the use of those narcotics that bring about
degeneration and depravity.
Ought the delegations which do not belong
to the First Conference to remain silent regard-
ing Article 8 of the American proposals and
be unable to express their opinion, merely
because this article closely affects the programme


work, and,
consequently, to examine also all
the points raised by the American suggestions.
The words
?if possible, immediately after the
conference.
?? show clearly that the Second
of the First Conference ? Such an idea seems
to me to be inadmissible, and I am sure that
the Assembly never intended to prevent the
delegations from expressing their views on this
point. I would refer you, in this connection,
to the end of the sixth resolution of the Assem-
bly of 1923 : ? to invite the Governments
concerned to send representatives with pleni-
potentiary powers to a conference for this
purpose, to be held, if possible, immediately
after the conference mentioned in Resolution V?.
In view of these words, I think I may say
that the Assembly was of the opinion that the
Second Conference was bound to consider the
resolutions of the First in the execution of its
Conference is perfectly free to examine the
agreements at which the First Conference might
arrive, and, if it thought fit, to take account of
them in any Convention which it might frame.
This seems to me just and reasonable, for
examining does not mean criticising nor pas-
sing judgment on the work of the earlier Confe-
rence, but only implies that, by taking account
of the resolutions of the First Conference, we
can draft the articles of the Convention in
accordance with our own ideals.
Furthermore, the delimitation of the spheres
of action of the two Conferences is very hard
to establish with accuracy. Just as we cannot
determine with mathematical precision the
dividing line between light and darkness, and
just as no one is capable of exactly indicating
the skyline when the weather is not clear, in
the same way the Hague Convention is made
up of several chapters, of which the First
Conference was called upon to examine the
second, and the Second Conference the others.
Nevertheless, these chapters make up a homo-
geneous whole, like the limbs of the human body,
which, though only connected by joints, cannot
suffer any change without affecting all the
others, because they belong to the same orga-
nism. Similarly, in our present situation, it
is very hard to say just how far the sphere
of the Second Conference extends and where
the sphere of the First begins, because the
question of the production of raw opium and
the question of the traffic in prepared opium are
closely associated with the proposals with which
we are dealing at this Conference.
There is, however, another consideration of
a formal character to which I would like to
draw the attention of the members of the First
Conference. If I remember rightly, the dele-
gate for India said that the agreement concluded
by the First Conference could not be submitted
to the Second, because a gathering of plenipo-
tentiaries did not submit the resolutions which
it had adopted to another gathering of pleni-
potentiaries. But we are not concerned in
this case with submitting the resolutions of the
First Conference to the examination and
criticism of the Second. I could not criticise
the work of the First Conference, nor do I
think that it would occur to the American dele-
gation to do so, for this delegation, in expressing
certain opinions upon the agreements concluded
at the First Conference, did so solely with the
object of supporting its proposals and asking
this Conference to accept Article 8 proposed by
the United States delegation.
What we idealists desire is simply the exami-
nation of Article 8 of the American suggestions,
in spite of the fact that it touches upon questions
dealt with by the First Conference, and we wish
to make this examination because, according
to our interpretation of the scope of our pro-
gramme, we have not only a formal legal right,
but a moral right, to do so. Looking at the
problem in this way, that is to say, holding the
opinion that the Second Conference will not
proceed to judge or criticise the agreements
reached by the First, but that we shall confine
ourselves exclusively to examining Article 8
of the American proposals, we feel sure that we
shall be sparing the susceptibilities of the dele-
gates of the First Conference with regard to
their prestige, while satisfying their scruples
from the legal point of view.
I think that we may now consider the prac-
tical aspect of the problem. I have told you
already that we are following a road with an
abyss on each side, into which the slightest
false step will precipitate us. It seems to me
very hard to find a practical solution of the
problem, since, on the one hand, if we discuss
the American proposals, we are threatened
not in an offensive manner, it is true by the
categorical reservation of the members of the
First Conference. On the other hand, we run
the risk of the possible abstention of the
American delegation, if Article 8 with its purely
humanitarian object is not examined ; and
the very enthusiasm of those of us the
idealists who support this article, the
enthusiasm which braced us to co-operate in
the humanitarian task that we are seeking
to accomplish here, may fail, if we find that
our efforts towards a high ideal are obstructed
at all points by formal or legal considerations
which have nothing to do with the vital object
of our Conference. Disillusioned, we should
be forced to conclude ?summum jus, summa
injuria.?
For a long time I have looked for a solution
equally satisfactory to both parties. I have
wondered whether it would be well to appoint
a Mixed Commission to which we could entrust
the examination of these questions, or whether
it would be better to submit this dispute to the
Council. A Mixed Commission, however, would
find itself in the same difficulty as ourselves ;
the Council?s session is already ended, and to
refer these questions to it would only mean the
indefinite postponement of the work of our
Conference.
In view of the impossibility of reconciling
the two opposing views, I think that we should
decide in favour of the view which has the prior
claim. The object of the Conference is to
combat the drug habit by all possible means.
We must therefore attack the root and not the
branches. In cases of disease, a doctor does
not apply external medicaments simply to
destroy the symptoms of the complaint, but
studies and seeks to overcome the causes, for
otherwise he could not save his patient and
would expose himself to severe criticism.
We are in the same position. The experience
of long years, during which we have confined
our efforts to combating the drug habit by
half-measures, has shown us that, in this ques-
tion of opium, we must act in the way in which
a doctor deals with an infectious disease.
We must attack the evil at the roots, that is
to say, the production of the raw materials


and the traffic in prepared opium, if we wish
to have done once and for all with this problem
which is such a disgrace to mankind.
The honourable members of the First Confe-
rence formulated a reservation which obviously
deserves all our respect and attention, but 1
hope that I shall have satisfied them by the
reply that I have given on this subject. The
interests of humanity alone should prevail,
and we can, I am sure, continue upon our
idealistic path, and with a clear conscience
complete the task which has been entrusted
to us.
One more point. Is it compatible with our
dignity, with common honesty, to be seated
here, beside the delegations of the Asiatic
States which are honouring us with their pre-
sence, and not to give these countries the
support which they need in their distress ? Can
we ask them to come and co-operate with us for
the welfare of humanity, and then, with the
sight of their sufferings before our eyes, aban-
don them to insufficient methods for combating
the scourge which rages among them still
more violently than among ourselves, at the
same time declaring ourselves content with
measures which ensure the welfare of the Wes-
tern countries only ?
Since human solidarity is the alpha and omega
of the League of Nations, since the League has
proclaimed equality, it is our duty to grant to
the Orientals that which we claim for ourselves.
Here there is neither white nor black, neither
yellow nor red ; there are only men. The
League of Nations has proclaimed the equality
not only of States but of races and religions.
Let us take Nature?s way as an example.
Nature extends her bounties on every side and to
each one of us. Every day the sun shines
upon us all, and no one has the right to prevent
any other from receiving the whole or part of
its light. Accordingly, it is our moral duty to
share with our brothers of the East the bene-
fits that we enjoy in the West.
The strict application in certain countries of
the measures that we think fit to take against
the drug habit is opposed by arguments legal,
formal, economic or political. I shall not
enter into details with which you are familiar,
but I shall say, with all that respect which
I owe to the members of the First Conference,
with whose work we are not concerned, that
the weight of the legal arguments advanced
against us is great ; great is the interest of the
formal principles which should regulate the
diplomatic relations between the two Confe-
rences ; great, too, is the consideration which
the economic or political interests of certain
countries deserve ; great, as we may be re-
minded, is the principle of sovereignty. But
the conception of our moral duty is greater ;
still greater the sentiment of human solidarity
and brotherhood, and greater and higher still
the supreme ideal of the League of Nations, an
ideal based upon truth, goodness, justice the
good of humanity. ( Long and sustained applause.)
The President

will address the Conference.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gentle-
men, in view of this fresh proof of the humani-
tarian ideals which are so characteristic of
members of this Conference, and of the state-
ments made by the United States delegation,
I can only express my admiration for the pur-
pose of those who desire to save the victims
of this horrible drug in every country of the
world. I most heartily support the American
proposal. {Applause.)
The President
Translation : Mr. J. C. Walton, delegate of
India, will address the Conference.
Mr. Walton (India)
I wish to intervene for a few minutes only
in order to answer a question raised in the course
of the discussion by the honourable delegate
for Poland. He made an enquiry as to
opium eating and he asked which Conference
is competent to discuss that question. In the
view of the Indian delegation, this question
is within the competence of neither Conference.
The question of opium eating in India we regard
as a question of domestic jurisdiction, and,
moreover (this is an important point), a question
within the jurisdiction not even of the Central
Government in India but within the jurisdic-
tion of the Provincial Governments, because
India, under her new constitution, is a Federal
State.
Although we regard the question as one of
domestic jurisdiction, the Indian delegation
is willing and even anxious to give this Confe-
rence, not now, but on a proper occasion, all
possible information about opium eating in
India that is to say, all the information which
we ourselves possess, because, since the sub-
ject is one not even within the competence of
the Government of India itself, it necessarily
follows that our own information is strictly
limited.
At the present moment I desire merely to
refer to the statement made by the honourable
and distinguished delegate for Poland to the
effect, if I understood him aright, that in one
of the provinces of India, namely, the Province
of Bombay, there is a special institution under
the control of the authorities for making opium
pills for children. I desire merely to say that
the honourable delegate must be under some
misapprehension, because so far is such a state-
ment removed from any of the facts within
our knowledge that we cannot even conjecture
the origin of the misapprehension under which
he is obviously labouring.
The President
Translation : M. Falcioni, delegate of Italy,
will address the Conference.
M. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : I wish to make a short state-
ment on behalf of the Italian delegation. Italy,
whose interest in this grave problem is a purely
moral one, supports the United States proposal.
We have, however, followed with close attention
the important legal discussion as to the compe-
tence of our Conference to deal with this ques-
tion. Our attitude in this respect has not
changed. We think that there are questions
which cannot be settled in the same way as an
ordinary legal dispute. They must be dealt with,
as M. de Aguero has pointed out, on an ideal-
istic basis. When a moral or humanitarian
problem arises, it must be settled at all costs,
for the world looks to us for help and would


never understand if purely formal difficulties
were allowed to stand in our way.
I beg to state that the Italian delegation,
while expressing no opinion on the attitude
of the First Conference, which made every
effort to achieve its object, desires to support
the proposal of the United States delegation.
[Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gen-
tlemen, my remarks will be as brief and as explicit
as those of the Italian delegate. The motion
submitted by the United States delegate
deserves the full sympathy of the Spanish delega-
tion. We are convinced that the opium pro-
blem will never be solved until control covers
production, traffic, manufacture and consump-
tion. This is the ideal towards which we must
work. We must keep that ideal in view, but
we must also take actual circumstances into
account. I do not know what our President
proposes ; Ido not know if this question will
be put to the vote to-day. If it should be so,
I ask whether any vote taken by the Conference
to-day can possibly settle the question. No !
We have heard the unanimous views of the
majority of the members of the First Conference,
who declare, for reasons which there is no need
for me to analyse now, that, should the Confe-
rence deal with the United States proposal, the
delegations of France, the British Empire,
Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal and India
would take no part in the discussion. Do you
think that any agreement reached in such
circumstances, without the representatives
of the producing Powers, would be effective ?
Such a view would truly be too optimistic.
It is clear, from the statements which we have
heard hitherto, that the weight of opinion in
the Conference, apart from that of the delega-
tions which I have named, is in favour of the
United States proposal. Such a situation has
never arisen before ; this is an unprecedented
occasion, which no one could foresee.
Should we not give the Governments time
to consider the consequences of this fresh fact,
and adjourn our discussion while our col-
leagues lay it before their Governments and
ask for fresh instructions ?
I have no wish to waste time ; we can
continue our work on the other questions,
which have already been accepted. In this way
we may perhaps arrive at the understanding
which is so important for the welfare of huma-
nity. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : Am I to regard the Spanish
delegate?s speech and suggestion as a motion
of adjournment ? If such is the case, I must
ask him to hand in his motion in writing.
IV!. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I think it would be better not
to draft my proposal until the conclusion of
the general discussion on the United States
proposals. The delegations can consider, before
the close of the discussion, whether my proposal
is likely to lead to good results ; that will
depend upon the attitude of the other dele-
gations.
Translation : I call upon M. Chodzko, dele-
gate of Poland, to address the Conference.
SVI. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : I asked to be allowed to
speak on a personal question. I would reply
to the observation made by the delegate for India
concerning the pills for children manufactured
at Bombay. I obtained the following infor-
mation from an official document, ?The Final
Report of the Royal Commission on Opium?
(1895, page 144) ; ?In Bombay there is an
extensive use of bala gooli, that is, pills made of
opium mixed with other drugs and spices for
the use of children. This is at present carried
on under the sanction of the authorities.?
I have also received information from another
source to the effect that bala gooli pills are
now being made in large quantities. They
contain one-sixth, and sometimes even as
much as one-third, of a grain of opium. This
is all the information I am able to give to the
delegate for India on this matter.
The President
Translation : I will give the delegate for
India an opportunity to reply to the Polish
delegate. After that, I must ask delegates
not to discuss this question of detail.
Dr. Betances (Dominican Republic) :
Translation : I simply wish to say a word
in explanation of my vote. The delegation of
the Dominican Republic supports any proposal
made by any delegation, no matter when,
with a view to the limitation of the use of drugs
of any description to medical and scientific
requirements. [Applause.)
IVS. Bourgois (France)
Translation : I have only one thing to say.
Although at the present stage no arguments
will influence the voting, it is right that they
should be submitted and recorded.
The Assembly charged the First Conference
to consider the question of prepared opium and
to arrive at an agreement on that question.
How can anyone present imagine that it
occurred to members of the Assembly to instruct
the Second Conference to deal with the same
problems a fortnight later and to draw up
an agreement which might be at variance with
the first ?
The President
Translation : The delegate for India has just
informed me that, in order not to prolong the
discussion, he will not reply to M. Chodzko now,
but will have a private conversation with
him.
Does anyone else wish to take part in the
general discussion ?
As no one else wishes to speak on the general
question, I think that we can now deal with
the point raised by the first delegate of Spain.
I call upon M. de Palacios to speak.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I have not heard any opinion
on the proposal which I have submitted. As
it was inspired simply by a spirit of conciliation
and the desire to obtain the collaboration of
those competent to deal with the problem before
us, in order to make a success of a task which
? ? 128
The President


should receive universal support, I beg to
inform you that I wish my motion to stand.
I have drafted it to read as follows :
?That the discussion on the motion
submitted by the delegation of the United
States of America on December nth, 1924,
be adjourned.?
There can naturally be no question of inde-
finite adjournment, but I think that it would
be dangerous to fix a date now. We should
leave it to the President, who might consult the
delegations most directly concerned in the
matter.
The President
Translation : Discussion will therefore be
confined to the motion submitted by the first
delegate of Spain.
M. Sugimura, delegate of Japan, will address
the Conference.
IV!. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : I do not propose to enter
into a lengthy or profound discussion of the
thorny problem of the competence of the Second
Conference, for I am convinced that such dis-
cussions merely serve to complicate our work and
make the realisation of our common ideal
more difficult.
Nor do I wish at this point to criticise the
results of the work of the First Conference ; I
wish simply to look towards the future in the
hope that by successive improvements that
future may tend to become ever better. It
is in this spirit that I venture to suggest a few
measures which may help us to solve our present
dilemma and reconcile the divergent views
expressed.
As regards the resolutions of the First Con-
ference, it appears to me indisputable that, from
the juridical point of view, they are of a special
and, regional character. The agreement con-
cluded is binding only on the eight Contracting
States, and for the other States constitutes
what would be called in legal terminology
?res inter alios acta?. States not parties to
the agreement cannot modify the provisions
of that agreement.
From the practical point of view, however, the
problem of opium and other drugs forms one
single whole, and is so considered in the Hague
Convention.
The work was divided between the two Confe-
rences for practical reasons. There is, however,
a certain interdependence between the two
Conferences, and their results, therefore, are
bound to react upon one another. Such being
the case, it would surely be of value to devise
some means of co-ordination such as already
exists between the various Committees of the
present Conference.
The task of co-ordinating the results of the
work of the two Conferences does not fall, strictly
speaking, within the legal competence of either
the First or the Second Conference. It can
only be begun after this present assembly has
concluded its work.
I venture to suggest the following course :
1. That we should first hear the opi-
nions of certain delegations which took
no part either in the work of the First
Conference or in the drafting of the reso-
lution of the fourth Assembly.
2. If, at the end of the present Confe-
rence, we find that it is desirable that the
results of the work of the two Conferences
should be co-ordinated, we can ask our
President to insert a recommendation to
this effect in his report to the Council of
the League.
3. We might then set up a special Com-
mittee consisting of delegates of the eight
States which took part in the work of
the First Conference and an equal number
of delegates of States which did not take
part in it. After considering the results
of the work of both Conferences, this Com-
mittee might submit a report to the Council
on the modifications which it might appear
desirable to make in the work of the First
Conference.
4. The Council, after discussing the
desirability of the modifications proposed,
might then convene a Conference of all
the States signatories to the Hague Con-
vention or communicate with all the States
concerned, in order to obtain their adhe-
sion to these modifications.
My suggestions have only one object, and
that is to meet, as far as possible, the view's of
the States represented at the Second Conference,
to safeguard the legitimate rights of the States
signatories to the Hague Convention and to
arrive at an agreement such as will meet the
lawful claims of the various States and satisfy
enlightened public opinion throughout the world.
I have only one desire conciliation coupled
with justice.
I venture therefore to submit the following
motion :
?The Japanese delegation proposes that
the Conference should submit to the Busi-
ness Committee the American proposal,
together with the Japanese suggestion
and the British proposal submitted yester-
day by Sir Malcolm Delevingne, and that
the Business Committee should report to
the full Conference.?
The President
Translation : I venture to direct the Japa-
nese delegate?s attention to the fact that the
President of the Second Conference is not called
upon, under the terms of the fourth Assembly?s
sixth resolution, to report to the Council. I
am not aw'are of any such duty, though it exists,
I believe, in the case of the First Conference
IVI. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation : You are quite right.
The President
Translation : The Conference now has before
it the two motions submitted by the Spanish
and Japanese delegations.
It is very difficult to discuss the Japanese
proposal, unless we have it before us in writing.
We want not only the exact text of the proposal,
but also the reasons set forth by M. Sugimura
in his speech. It is hardly possible, therefore,
to discuss it now, and I think that it would be
better to have both proposals roneoed, together
with the addition to the Japanese proposal
which I suggested, and to discuss them this
afternoon. We might discuss M. de Palacios?
motion now, but not the Japanese proposal.


IVI. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : In order to simplify the dis-
cussion then, I beg to withdraw my motion
for the time being and to support the Spanish
delegate?s proposal.
The President
Translation : The Spanish delegation?s pro-
posal concerning the question of adjournment
is the only one now before us for discussion.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I simply wish to emphasise
some explanations which I have already given.
I have been asked by certain delegates what the
real purpose of my proposal was. As I drafted
it hastily, I am quite prepared to have it re-
drafted, but I wish to make it quite clear that
its purpose is simply an adjournment and not
the burial of the American proposal. I wanted
to find a means of giving certain delegates time
to consult their Governments. Naturally, I
can only urge that those delegates who were
members of the First Conference should be
asked to explain to their Governments the pre-
sent position of this Conference.
The President
Translation : Do members wish to discuss
this question ?
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands)
I wish to ask the following question : Does the
Spanish delegate?s proposal mean that we
have to ask our Governments for fresh instruc-
tions ?
The President
Translation : I am not quite sure of the
interpretation to be placed on the Spanish
proposal, but I do not think that it imposes
any obligation on delegates to ask for fresh in-
structions ; it leaves it to their discretion.
IVI. Sze (China) :
Mr. President and members of the Conference,
I greatly appreciate the suggestion which has
been made by the distinguished delegate for
Spain, and I want to support his motion because,
as I understand it, that motion was put forward
with a view to conciliation and with the idea
that the points of view of the different parties
might be co-ordinated. As I see the discussion
to-day, we are all, I think, idealists, as the
delegate for Cuba has said. The only thing
that some of the delegations lack is instructions
from their Governments, and the proposition
put forward by the delegate for Spain will solve
that difficulty. I wish therefore to put it on
record that I am in favour of his motion.
On the other hand, I hope I may be permitted
to ask you, Mr. President, if you will be good
enough to read us the exact terms of the pro-
posal of the Spanish delegate, because it is of
some importance to some of us to know exactly
the extent of that adjournment. I think that
this whole question is of some importance and
requires consideration, so it does not seem to
me wise that' we should discuss the subject
immediately and take a decision. I think that
some of the delegates here, like myself, while
being in favour of the proposal, would like
to have a little more time in which to consider
the matter and to examine the terms of the
resolution. Unless, therefore, you would like
to deal with the other items on the agenda,
I propose that the meeting should be adjourned
until the President summons it again.
The President
Translation : lam quite prepared to meet
the wishes of the Chinese delegate. This is
the text of the Spanish delegate?s proposal :
?That the discussion on the motion
submitted by the delegation of the United
States of America on December nth,
1924, be adjourned.?
I would emphasise the word ?discussion?,
which means that the matter is not yet settled.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : We might even say ?the
continuation of the discussion?.
IVI. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I would ask the first Spanish
delegate to add to the proposal a few words
to the effect that, as he has just said, the pur-
pose of the adjournment is to endeavour to
arrive at an agreement. This would make it
quite clear to everybody.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : The proposal might begin as
follows : ?That, in order that an agreement
may be reached...?
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America)
It is needless to express our earnest desire
for an amicable adjustment of this contro-
versy. The motion of the distinguished dele-
gate from Spain contemplates the adjournment
of this discussion without date. The reason
given is that the delegates of the First Confe-
rence shall have time to ask for new instructions.
I have no objection to this proposal, provided
we know that those delegates intend to ask
for new instructions ; if they do not intend to
do so, the adjournment would be useless. I
suggest therefore that we fix a time-limit for
the adjournment, say, until Monday or Tuesday
of next week. As the proposal now stands, the
adjournment has no time-limit and the chances
are that, as the Conference will be going on
with its other work, there will be no time left
in which to discuss this very important matter.
We have now spent one whole day discussing
this question, and I personally have no desire
to shorten that discussion. I would much
rather see it prolonged, but I have no objec-
tion to an adjournment. Ido hope, however,
that the Conference will take into consideration
the fact that an adjournment without time-
limit is very dangerous, especially in view of
the fact that we have not the slightest inti-
mation from any of the delegates on the First
Conference that they even intend to ask for
new instructions.
I therefore propose an amendment, which
is a very simple orie, namely, that we adjourn
the matter till Tuesday next.
IVI. Sze (China)
I do not propose to take up any more of
the time of the Conference. I had intended
to say something more or less on the same lines
as Mr. Porter, but that is no longer necessary.


1 ranslation : We now have the proposal,
with two amendments. You all know how
it reads :
that, in order that an agreement may
be reached, the continuation of the discus-
sion on the motion submitted by the
delegation of the United States of America
on December nth, 1924, be adjourned till
Tuesday next.?
The Spanish delegate has accepted the amend
ments. Shall I take a vote ?
(VI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I agree to a date being fixed
but I think that Tuesday is too soon.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios does not accept
the United States amendment. We are left
with two proposals ; that the Conference be
adjourned sine die and alternatively that a
day be fixed.
I think that it would be advisable to confine
the discussion and the vote to M. de Palacios?
proposal.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
I do not know at the moment the exact
wording of the proposal which has been brought
forward by the Spanish delegate, but I would
like to know whether it implies that I have
to ask for new instructions from my Government.
I can never accept a decision from this Confe-
rence to the effect that I have to ask for new
instructions. Moreover, I cannot agree to
an adjournment for the purpose of coming to
an agreement. Why do we not say that the
meeting is adjourned until Monday or Tuesday,
and not mention the purpose of the adjourn-
ment ? I should have no objection to such a
procedure.
The President
Translation : The first part of the French
text has not yet been drafted. It was M.
Chodzko who proposed the amendment ; I
will therefore consult him. What he meant
was, I think : ?In order that an agreement
may be reached ? The proposal covers
the question of adjournment and nothing else.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) ;
It seems to us that the amendment which I
suggested is germane to the motion of the dis-
tinguished delegate from Spain, and, if that
be the fact, the vote should be taken on that
amendment. Moreover, I desire again to point
out that we are adjourning in the hope that
something may result from it, in the hope that
some of the delegates of the First Conference
will, during the interim, ask for new instructions.
Those delegates are all here ; none of them
has given us the slightest intimation that they
intend to take any such action.
An indefinite adjournment therefore prac-
tically kills this American proposal. It can
have no other effect. I think everyone will
admit that. I have no desire to hurry anyone,
but I think I have the right to insist that, if
this discussion is postponed in the hope that
something may happen in the meantime, it
should be postponed to a definite date, not
later than next Tuesday.
This Conference is drawing to a close. The
matters in connection with Chapter II of the
American proposal are very important. Let
me say again that the nations represented at
the First Conference have no more rights in
the matter of prepared opium than the other
nations signatories to the Hague Convention.
The mere fact that many of the other nations
ha\ e suppressed this traffic does not relieve them
of their rights in the matter.l do hope that
you will not now, when we are almost at the
end of the Conference, again postpone even the
consideration of a vital element in the propo-
sals of the United States in this matter.
The President
Translation : Mr. Porter and I are not quite
agreed as regards the vote on the amendment.
The latter can be interpreted in various ways,
according to whether it is regarded as a limi-
tation Oi, or an addition to, the proposal.
If the Conference wishes a vote to be taken
I am prepared to take it, but I am not sure
that we are right in doing so.
IVS. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
Translation : I agree to the Conference
being adjourned until Monday or Tuesday,
but I do not wish the reasons for that adjourn-
ment to be included in the resolution, nor
that the adjournment should imply that I am
obliged to ask for new instructions from my
Government.
The President
Translation : In order not to prolong this
discussion, which has already been sufficiently
long, I propose, as President, that the conti-
nuation of the discussion of the American pro-
posal be adjourned until Tuesday next.
If it is the wish of the Conference, I will put
the Spanish proposal to the vote. Otherwise,
it is decided that the continuation of the
discussion on the American proposal will be
adjourned until Tuesday next.
(VI. de Palacios (Spain) ;
Translation : It is clear that mv proposal
is approved, even by the Chair. It does not
appear to be necessary to put it to the vote.
I have to thank the Conference for adopting
the course which I suggested.
The President
1 ranslation : Then I may assume that the
Conference accepts my proposal.
The proposal was adopted.
The President
Translation : M, Sugimura?s motion has
still to be discussed.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) :
I understand that only the American pro-
posal has been adjourned until Tuesday next.
I did not want to interfere with any other
matter before the Conference.
The President
Translation : There is still one item on the
agenda. I do not think that we can discuss
it now, as it is so late. If the Committees and
The President


Sub-Committees are not meeting this afternoon,
I suggest that the Second Conference should do
so.
IV!. Sze (China) ;
While I like to do everything you desire,
Mr. President, I regret to say that, so far as the
Chinese delegation is concerned, it will not be pos-
sible for it to be represented at the Second Con-
ference this afternoon, because the Secretariat
has notified us that there is to be a meeting
of the First Conference. It is an important
meeting, at which I shall have the honour of
presenting a statement. I would like to have
as much time as possible before that meeting.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands) President of
the First Conference :
The meeting of the First Conference, which
was originally fixed for 3.3� P- m -> has been put
off till 5.30 p.m.
The President
Translation : If the First Conference meets
at 5.30 p.m., we shall have very little time.
I should like to know the feeling of the Confe-
rence on this matter. I suggest that we meet
this afternoon at 4 o?clock.
M. Sze (China) :
Mr. President, it is now twenty-two minutes
before two, and I have to consult my delegation
before we go to the First Conference, to which
I have promised to make an important statement,
and I do not want to disappoint it. In order,
therefore, to meet your wishes, may I suggest
that this Conference should meet at half-past
four instead of at four o?clock, so that I may
have another hour in which to consult my
delegation and put my statement into a final
form.
JVJ. van Wettum (Netherlands), President of
the First Conference :
Translation : I propose that the hirst Con-
ference should meet at 6 p.m.
The President
Translation : The Second Conference will
meet at 4.30 p.m. and the First Conference at
6 p.m.
The Conference rose at 1.40 p.m.
SIXTEENTH MEETING
Held at Geneva on Saturday, December 13th, 1924, at 4.30 p.m.
CONTENTS:
36. Hashish : Proposal of the Egyptian
Delegation that Hashish should be
INCLUDED IN THE LIST OF NARCOTICS
WITH WHICH THE CONFERENCE HAS TO
DEAL.
President ; M. Herluf Zahle.
<6. HASHISH : PROPOSAL OF THE EGYP-
TIAN DELEGATION THAT HASHISH
SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE LIST
OF NARCOTICS WITH WHICH THE
CONFERENCE HAS TO DEAL.
The President :
Translation : Ladies and gentlemen, the
meeting is open. _ .
The first item on the agenda is the proposal
submitted by the Egyptian delegation to he
effect that hashish should be included in the
list of narcotics with which the Conference has
?VcTll upon Dr. El Guindy, first delegate of
Egypt, to address the Conference.
iVS. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : As I promised in my speech,
I have the honour to submit to the Conference
in as concise a form as possible a memorandum
on hashish. In doing so, I hope that I may
be able to arouse the interest of the Conference
in this important question.
I do not wish it to be thought, however, that I
am only dealing with this question in so far as
it concerns Egypt alone. It is true that in our
country we have taken the strictest measures
against the contraband traffic in this drug,
but there are other peoples also which suffer
from its ravages. Egypt is not the only nation
concerned, and I therefore wish to ask you to
examine the problem of hashish with all the
attention that it deserves, since it is a problem
of capital importance for a large number of
Eastern peoples.
The cannabis indica or sativa, called also by
the name of hashish (English Indian hemp ;
German indianischer Hanj ; French chanvre
indien), was known even to antiquity.
It was originally cultivated on the plateau
of Persia and Turkestan. Later, it was intro-
duced into Asia Minor and Egypt, where it
was mentioned by chroniclers of the time of
the Crusades. At present, the countries which
produce it are Siberia, Russia, the Caucasus,
Persia, the western plateau of the Himalayas,
Kashmir, India and also South-Eastern Europe.
Researches undertaken with a view to deter-
mining the active agent of this plant led to the
discovery of a product called cannabine, a
kind of soft and brownish resin. An aromatic
oil of an amber colour, the inhalation of which
causes dizziness and giddiness, is also derived
from cannabis indica by distillation. In addition,
it has been found to contain a certain quantity
of nicotine x .

cates by Dechambre and Lereboullet, Paris 1886,

The flowers, the tender shoots and the fruits sents symptoms very similar to those of hys-
of the cannabis are specially utilised. Only
the unfertilised female flowers, however, are
able to produce the resinous matter, as ferti-
lisation destroys the active principle of the
plant.
Hashish, prepared in various forms, is used
principally in the following ways :
teria 1 .
From the therapeutic point of view, science
has not made much use of hashish with good
results. It has, however, been administered
with some success in certain cases of delirium
tremens.
Taken thus occasionally and in small doses,
hashish perhaps does not offer much danger,
but there is always the risk that once a person
begins to take it, he will continue. He acquires
the habit and becomes addicted to the drug,
and, once this has happened, it is very difficult
to escape. Notwithstanding the humiliations
and penalties inflicted on addicts in Egypt
they always return to their vice. They are
known as ?hashashees?, which is a term of
reproach in our country, and they are regarded
as useless derelicts.
( a) In the form of a paste made from
the resin obtained from the crushed leaves
and flowers, which is mixed with sugar and
cooked with butter and aromatic substances
and is used to make sweets, confectionery,
etc. ; known in Egypt by the names of
manzul, maagun and garawish.
( b) Cut into small fragments, it is mixed
with tobacco for smoking, in cigarettes.
(c) The Indian hemp is simply smoked
in special hookahs, called gozah.
Chronic hashishism is extremely serious,
since hashish is a toxic substance, a poison
against which no effective antidote is known.
It exercises a sedative and hypnotic effect, and
is prescribed in the following doses :
We must next consider the effects which are
produced by the use of hashish and distinguish
between :
(1) Acute hashishism, and
(2) Chronic hashishism.
The extract, from 0.015 g r - t� 0.06 gr.
The tincture, from 5 to 15 drops.
Acute hashishism occurs when the consumer
uses hashish irregularly.
Generally speaking, hashish is not very much
used in medical practice, and its results are a
matter of controversy.
In view of the great danger involved by the
consumption of hashish, special measures have
been taken by the Egyptian Government.
As early as 1868, Dr. Mohammed Ali Bey
made a report to the competent authorities
regarding the accidents caused by the abuse
of hashish. In 1884, the cultivation of this
plant was forbidden. The cafes (or mashhashas )
in which hashish was consumed by smoking
in special hookahs were closed, and are still
mercilessly sought out by the police.
Measures were taken to prevent the produc-
tion and importation of cannabis indica; the
following are the chief of these measures :
All cultivation of cannabis indica is prohi-
bited, and the cultivator is liable to a fine of
� E 50 (equal to about 26 gold francs) per
feddau or fraction of a feddau (the feddau
is equal to 4,200.83 square metres).
Let us study the effects of this intoxication :
Taken in small doses, hashish at first produces
an agreeable inebriation, a sensation of well-
being and a desire to smile ; the mind is
stimulated. A slightly stronger dose brings a
feeling of oppression and of discomfort. There
follows a kind of hilarious and noisy delirium
in persons of a cheerful disposition, but the
delirium takes a violent form in persons of
violent character. It should be noted that
behaviour under the influence of the delirium
is always related to the character of the indi-
vidual. This state of inebriation or delirium
is followed by slumber, which is usually peaceful
but sometimes broken by nightmares. The
awakening is not unpleasant ; there is a
slight feeling of fatigue, but it soon passes C
Hashish absorbed in large doses produces a
furious delirium and strong physical agitation ;
it predisposes to acts of violence and produces
a characteristic strident laugh. This condition
is followed by a veritable stupor, which cannot
be called sleep. Great fatigue is felt on awaken-
ing, and the feeling of depression may last for
several days.
The habitual use of hashish brings on chronic
hashishism, which is much more serious than
acute hashishism.
As regards importation, smuggled hashish
used a few years ago to be confiscated and
resold to agents for exportation. At present,
the goods confiscated are destroyed and a fine
of � E 10 per kilogramme is imposed on the
clandestine importer. However small may be
the quantity imported, the fine cannot be
less than � E 2.
The countenance of the addict becomes
gloomy, his eye is wild and the expression of his
face is stupid. He is silent ; has no muscular
power ; suffers from physical ailments, heart
troubles, digestive troubles, etc. ; his intellectual
faculties gradually weaken and the whole or-
ganism decays. The addict very frequently
becomes neurasthenic and, eventually, insane.
In general, the absorption of hashish pro-
duces hallucinations, illusions as to time and
place, fits of trembling, and convulsions 2 .
It is interesting to note the quantities of
hashish that have been confiscated as a result
of the measures taken by the Egyptian Govern-
ment.
The following quantities were seized by the
Customs Administration :

Kg. of Hashish
Unfortunately, I have no information regard-
ing the quantities seized by the police, which
must certainly be greater than the above-men-
tioned figures. There can be no doubt, how-
ever, that the goods confiscated represent only
a small fraction of what is introduced clandes-
tinely.
It is known, for example, that in a single year
(about 1909) more than 140,000 pounds of
hashish were consumed in Egypt 1 .
Some idea of the ravages produced by
these enormous quantities of hashish clandes-
tinely consumed may be gained from the fact
that the real requirements of the country hardly
ever exceed 20-30 kilogrammes annually.
For example, the requirements of hashish for
medical purposes in an average year may be
estimated at
11.165 kilos of extract,
1.331 ~ of soft extract,
1:2.375 � of tincture.
In 1919, the Egyptian Government allowed
the importation of 65 kilogrammes of hashish
for medical purposes and in 1920 of 23 kilo-
grammes.
The illicit use of hashish is the principal cause
of most of the cases of insanity occurring in
Egypt. In support of this contention, it may
be observed that there are three times as many
cases of mental alienation among men as among
women, and it is an established fact that men
are much more addicted to hashish than
women. (In Europe, on the contrary, it is
significant that a greater proportion of cases
of insanity occur among women than among men.)
Generally speaking, the proportion of cases
of insanity caused by the use of hashish varies
from 30 to 60 per cent of the total number of
cases occurring in Egypt.
My Government is giving increasing attention
to finding the best method of eradicating this
social evil. Other countries are also taking
an interest in this question. In the British
House of Commons on February 19th, 1924,
for example, Mr. Gilbert asked the Government
a question regarding hashish and its uses. He
expressed surprise that hashish was not inclu-
ded in the list of dangerous drugs which were
subject to import restrictions in Great Britain.
He asked whether the Government had any
information regarding the use of the drug in
certain seaport towns, and whether it proposed
to take any steps to add this drug to the list
of dangerous drugs and place it under the
same restrictions as applied to them.
Mr. Rhys Davies replied that indulgence in
the use of hashish was rare in Great Britain,
though it was possible that it was practised
to a certain extent among Oriental seamen
visiting her ports. Hashish was not one of

the drugs to which the International Opium
Convention of 1912 applied, though the Hague
Conference recommended that its use should
be investigated and stated that any proposal
for the extension to hashish of the restrictions
relating to the drugs included in the Convention
would have to be considered from the internatio-
nal standpoint. He understood that the League
of Nations, which by the Treaty of Peace was
entrusted with the general supervision over the
traffic in dangerous drugs, had not yet considered
the question.
He added : ?The question is one in which other
countries are more closely concerned than this
country, but the position is being watched by
my department and, if it appears desirable,
steps will be taken to raise the question before
the Opium Advisory Committee of the League?? C
I was very glad to hear that the South Afri-
can Government had made the same proposal
as myself. I should also specially like to thank
the honourable delegates of the United States,
Turkey, Japan, Brazil, Poland, Greece and
other countries, who have assured me that this
subject was also included in their programmes.
Further, I should like to thank all the delegates
to whom I have spoken on this question and
who have promised me their support.
I do not see why we should wait until 1925
to take a decision on this question, since a
large number of countries have pronounced in
favour of my proposal through their delegates.
The day before yesterday evening, on the
advice of the President, I had an interview
with the honourable delegates of France, the
British Empire and India in the hope of gaining
a decision in favour of my proposal without
being forced to submit the point to the Confe-
rence and to raise once more the question of
competence.
All these distinguished delegates were in
agreement with me as regards the terrible and
injurious effects of this drug, and none of them
denied that it was a dangerous narcotic and a
habit-forming drug. In spite of that, however,
we were unfortunately unable to reach an
agreement as to how the question could be
settled forthwith.
I was told that a special paragraph had been
inserted in the report of the Advisory Committee
concerning the cannabis indica or cannabis
saliva, or, to give it its more usual name,
hashish. But my Government, which received
this report at the same time as the invitation
to take part in this Conference, did not find
in it any more than I have myself been able
to find any serious obstacle to the addition
of hashish (which is the resin obtained from the
flowers, the leaves, or the hairs on the extremi-
ties of the cannabis indica or cannabis saliva,
to the list of narcotics and injurious drugs
with which we are now dealing. That this
addition may be made is the chief request
which my Government makes to this Conference.
From the economic point of view, I do not
think that Indian hemp is of appreciable
importance to the finances of any State.
As regards the industrial point of view, I
do not think this plant has any qualities which
cannot be found elsewhere. Even if the contrary
were the case, it would be easy to employ it
if the precaution were taken of letting the
female flowers be fertilised by increasing the

quantity of plants producing male flowers in
the fields under cultivation.
In a moment, I shall ask our friend and
distinguished Vice-President, H.E. M. de
Aguero y Bethancourt, to tell you how hashish
also leads many of its addicts to absorb viru-
lent poisons which they would never have
dreamed of taking if they had not fallen under
the influence of this pernicious drug.
Personally, even at the risk of seeming
importunate, I insist, and shall continue to
insist, on the importance of this question,
being confident that in this respect I am voicing
the views of the entire Egyptian people, from
His Majesty King Fuad I, our august and well-
beloved sovereign, who takes a special interest
in the question, down to the humblest fellah
of the Nile valley.
I earnestly beg all the delegates to give this
question their best attention, for I know the
mentality of Oriental peoples, and lam afraid
that it will be said that the question was not
dealt with because it did not affect the safety
of Europeans. I am in full agreement with
my eminent colleague, Dr. Chodzko, who said
that considerations of religion, of race or of
nationality must never be allowed to stand in
the way of the humanitarian work which the
League of Nations undertakes.
Moreover, I am sure that, if we take a deci-
sion regarding opium and the drugs mentioned
in the schedule of the Advisory Committee,
without adding hashish, the latter will soon
replace the other narcotics and will then
become a terrible menace to the whole world.
It seems to me that it is better to prevent a
disease than to cure it.
The League of Nations aims at safeguarding
the liberty of man. It is an arbiter guaranteeing
the rights of every nation.
The League wants all the citizens of the world
to be able to live their lives in freedom and good
health, and therefore I am sure that it will
give its attention to the havoc wrought by
hashish among our population. It will save
the thousands of human beings who lose their
reason every year as a consequence of the exces-
sive use of hashish.
The League of Nations will earn the grati-
tude of all those it will have rescued from the
hashish habit, and it will thus swell the ranks
of those who wish to fight under its banner in
the good cause.
I am certain that you, gentlemen, who work
under the aegis of the League of Nations, will
help us in the struggle we have undertaken
against this scourge, which reduces man to
the level of the brute and deprives him of
health and reason, self-control and honour.
[Prolonged applause.)
The President
Translation: The discussion on the Egyptian
delegation?s proposal is open. Does anyone
wish to speak on this subject ?
M. Sze, delegate of China, will address the
Conference.
IYS. Sze (China) ;
Mr. President and members of the Confe-
rence, I am greatly moved by the statement
made by the honourable delegate of Egypt.
While I know next to nothing about the subject,
I wish, in view of the statement the Egyptian
delegate has made about the danger which this
drug is to humanity, to second his request
that this Conference should make a study
of the question and do everything possible to
put an end to this dangerous form of drug
named hashish. On behalf of my delegation,
I wish to assure the Egyptian delegate that it
can count on us to do all we can to support its
efforts. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : The Hon. Stephen G. Porter,
delegate of the United States of America, will
address the Conference.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) :
Mr. President and members of the Conference,
I have read with care and interest the statement
of the distinguished delegate of Egypt and I
have also read the statement which was made
by the delegate of Turkey.
My knowledge of hashish and its use is quite
limited. The very carefully prepared state-
ment of the delegate of Egypt, together with
my own knowledge on the subject, have satis-
fied me that we are under an obligation in
this Conference to do everything we can to
assist the Egyptian and Turkish people to
rid themselves of this vice. We are asking
them to help us to destroy the vice of opium,
coca leaves and their derivatives, and I believe
that this is a good time to practise a little reci-
procity. They have their troubles and we have
ours, and I can see no reason why this Confe-
rence, aided as it is by the distinguished men
on Sub-Committee F, should not deal with
this question. Happily, as I understand it,
no question of revenue is involved. That fact
ought to make the solution much easier, and
I earnestly urge the delegates to give to the
suggestion of the delegate of Egypt the same
patient hearing as they would give to other
matters. I shall conclude by saying that
many countries of the world have their own
problems ; by helping each other we can
make the world much happier and much
better. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : Mr. Clayton, delegate of India,
will address the Conference.
IY!r. Clayton (India) : Mr. President, at the
beginning of the present year the Government
of India commenced an enquiry on its own
initiative into the possibility of bringing Indian
hemp within the Hague Convention. It had,
for that purpose, to consult its Provincial
Governments, and I am not in a position to
speak as to the actual stage which the enquiry
has reached.
The Government of India was not aware
that the question of hashish would be raised
at this Conference, and consequently the Indian
delegation is entirely without instructions.
There is no doubt, however, in view of the
action which it is now taking, that the Govern-
ment of India would regard the Egyptian pro-
posal with sympathy. We are, however, pre-
paring here a Convention as the result of which
we shall enter into definite engagements. The
Government of India can only enter into
engagements which it knows it can effectively
carry out. In the state of its present know-
ledge, in the present state of the enquiry in


India, it will be very difficult for my Govern- cability of all the provisions of the Hague
ment to enter into any precise engagement at
this moment. Moreover, as I have already said,
I have no instructions.
I have not the least desire to put any obstacle
in the way of the delegation of the Government
of Egypt in the pursuance of its desire to
control this drug, but I think that the Egyptian
Government should recognise that our diffi-
culties are to some extent the result of their
own inaction, if I may use the word.
The League particularly asked that any country
invited to this Conference having any proposal
to place before it should send that proposal
to the Secretariat in time for the Preparatory
Committee. I understand that this proposal
with regard to hashish was not sent in in time
for the Preparatory Committee to deal with
it. We have none of us, therefore, had time
to consider the matter, and I think it would
be very difficult to give the subject that
unanimous vote of admission which would be
necessary for it to be included in the agenda of
the Conference.
In these circumstances, I suggest that the
Egyptian delegation should be ready to avail
itself of the machinery now being prepared by
Sub-Committee F, which will enable other
noxious drugs than those specifically mentioned
in the Hague Convention to be brought within
its terms. It would be possible then for all
Governments which sympathise with the aims
of the Egyptian delegation, as the Government
of India does, to work with the Egyptian Govern-
ment with a view to the inclusion of hashish
within the terms of the Convention, within as
short a delay as possible. It seems to me that
the only other way in which it could be dealt
with would be to have a vceu in the Protocol
of the Convention. In my view, the administra-
tive obstacles in the way of including any
specific article dealing with hashish, are, under
the circumstances, extraordinarily great.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
Mr. President, so far as I understand it, the
proposal before us is that hashish should be
brought within the full provisions of the Hague
Convention. On previous occasions during the
course of this Conference on which the matter
has been discussed, I hope I have made it
clear that Great Britain is not only willing
but desirous that this question should be
considered. The British Government has
already been taking steps to investigate it ; it
has also been taking steps to prevent illicit
traffic in this drug, and has been collaborating
to some extent with the Egyptian authorities
in the matter. I may again mention here a
point to which I think I have already referred,
namely, that this question was brought for the
first time to the attention of the League by the
Government of one of the British Dominions.
There are, however, difficulties in the way
of dealing with the matter here and now. I
think we must all agree that we cannot take
the decisive step which the Egyptian delegate
desires us to take without being quite clear
as to the facts and quite clear as to the appli-
Convention.
The difficulty is that the enquiries which
have already been initiated at the instance of
the Advisory Committee of the League are
not yet complete, and the delegations of the
States which have to deal with the question
I understand the States particularly inte-
rested are India and France have not come
prepared with the necessary information and
instructions.
This fact brings us back again to the old
question of competence. It was not intended,
when this Conference was summoned, that
hashish should be discussed, and I do not
think that all the ingenuity which different
delegations have displayed in reading certain
subjects into the agenda will enable even them
to find hashish there. That is the reason why
the matter is still, if I may use the expression,
in an unprepared state. It seems impossible
in those circumstances for us to do what the
Egyptian delegate wishes us to do, namely, by
an agreement at this Conference to decide to
bring hashish under the full provisions of the
Hague Convention.
The question therefore arises Can anything
short of this be done which is useful and prac-
ticable ? I think there can. Mr. Clayton has
already referred to the fact that new machinery
is under consideration for bringing new drugs,
which are liable to produce the same ill-effects
as those already under the Convention, within
the Convention, without the necessity of
calling a fresh Conference on each occasion.
That machinery, if adopted by this Conference,
will be available for bringing hashish, in due time,
under the Convention.
Then, again, I think it might be possible
for the interested Powers to continue the con-
versations which have already been begun in
private, to exchange their views and informa-
tion and experiences, and to arrive at an under-
standing so far as possible as to the measures
which are desirable and the points on which
it may be necessary to obtain further informa-
tion. Personally, I should have no objection
at all to the appointment of a small Committee
for continuing that work.
It might very well happen that, if such a
small Committee were appointed and the ques-
tion fully discussed, so far as is possible with
the limited information at our disposal, between
the delegations of the countries interested,
the Committee might find itself in a position
to present some vceu, some recommendation,
which could be appended to the Convention
resulting from the work of this Conference, as
to the measures which seem practicable and
desirable. That recommendation, if adopted,
would be submitted to the Governments,
and I have no doubt the Governments would
be prepared to act upon it to the utmost of
their power.
The President
Translation : M. Bourgois, delegate of
France, will address the Conference.
SV3. Bourgois (France) ;
Translation : I would like to associate
myself with the remarks and conclusions of
Sir Malcolm Delevingne.
From the medical point of view, there can
be no doubt that hashish is very dangerous,


and there is also no doubt that the Govern-
ments wish to remove this danger.
In France, hashish is treated in exactly the
same way as the drugs to which the Hague
Convention applies. Each colony has its
own regulations, based, in the first place, on
local conditions and, in the second, on adminis-
trative possibilities.
I would like to draw your attention to the
difficulties encountered on both these points.
Without going into the subject in detail,
I may quote the fact that in the Congo, for
example, there are several tribes of savages
and even cannibals among whom the habit
is very prevalent. It would therefore be
hypocritical on my part to sign a Convention
laying down strict measures in this respect.
I can undertake to have these measures
applied in France, because this would be a
practical proposition, but the same does not
apply to the Congo.
In pursuance of the Advisory Committee?s
decision, an enquiry has been ordered by the
competent ministerial departments. In con-
sequence, I associate myself with Sir Malcolm
Delevingne?s proposal to appoint a Committee,
which, in my opinion, will not be able to do
more in practice than make recommenda-
tions.
The President
Translation : Docs anyone else wish to
speak on this point ?
M. El. Guindy, delegate of Egypt, will address
the Conference.
!VI. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : The delegates who have
spoken on the question of hashish have all
expressed more or less the same opinion.
A member of the Conference has stated
that my Government did not sent its report
in time ; but to my knowledge no time-limit
was fixed.
The same speaker said that he had received
no instructions from his Government re-
specting the question before us. I would like
to point out that, as regards several subjects
which have been discussed, either at a ple-
nary meeting or in a Committee or Sub-
Committee, several delegates had not received
instructions from their Governments, but
this did not prevent them from taking part
in the discussion and even from taking
decisions.
We are told that further enquiries and inves-
tigations into the question of hashish are
necessary. But surely we all agree that has-
hish is a very dangerous narcotic and a habit-
forming drug. Consequently, I do not see
what additional investigations can be made,
since the fact to which I refer is recognised
by all.
It may be necessary to take into account
the objections which have been raised from
the administrative point of view. Ido not
think, however, that the Conference will
oblige a State to do anything which the Central
Board recognises to be impossible.
When a State signs an agreement, it. can
always make reservations if it finds it imposs-
ible to exercise complete control over one of
its possessions. It could give us the reasons
for these difficulties, and I imagine that the
Central Board would fully appreciate the
situation and would give a certain latitude
to such a State. I therefore consider that
the objections which have been put forward
do not constitute a real obstacle to the
addition of hashish ot the list of narcotics.
It has been proposed that Sub-Committee
F should extend the Hague Convention to
cover all the dangerous drugs to which it
did not originally apply. I really see no
plausible reason why hashish should not be
included here and now.
The time-limit which will be allowed
to carry out the obligations we may incur
by signing the Convention will perhaps be
sufficient to enable the States which make
these objections to study the best way of
restricting the production and exportation
of hashish.
The President
Translation : It seems to me that the
discussion is becoming a little confused.
One speaker said that hashish did not
come within the competence of the Conference.
I notice that this statement raised no protest
on the part of the members present. Yet
everyone seems to agree that this question
should be dealt with in some way or another.
If I have rightly understood the discussion
which has just taken place, we have two
proposals before us, one put forward by Mr.
Porter to the effect that the question should
be referred to Sub-Committee F, and the
other, put forward by Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne and seconded by M. Bourgois and
Mr. Clayton, to the effect that a special
Committee should be constituted to study it.
It seems that Dr. El Guindy is not satisfied
with either proposal. I did not gather the
exact conclusions he wished to be drawn
from his speech, and I would like to know
whether he accepts the British or the Ame-
rican suggestion.
As you know, Sub-Committee F proposes
to extend the schedule of narcotics covered
by the Hague Convention.
SVI. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : That was also one of my
proposals, Mr. President, but it is not the
result that I really want. My main point was
that hashish ought to be included in the
list of narcotics, since it has been recognised
as such by all the members of the Conference.
The President
Translation : If lam not mistaken, seve-
ral delegates who have just spoken are not
in a position to assume international obliga-
tions to suppress the use of hashish, because
the information hitherto available is not
sufficiently conclusive. These Governments
are doubtful of their ability to observe such
obligations as they might incur in this respect.
1 would like to draw the honourable Egyp-
tian delegate?s attention to the fact that he
has not pronounced an opinion with regard
to the proposals submitted by the American
and British delegations respectively. I should
be glad to know his views on these two pro-
posals.
!�!. El Guindy (Egypt) ;
Translation : I accept the American pro-
posal to refer the question to Sub-Committee


F, on the understanding that I reserve the
right to raise the question again before the
plenary Conference.
The President
Translation : Does anyone wish to speak
on this subject ?
As no one wishes to speak, the Egyptian
proposal regarding hashish may be consi-
dered as unanimously referred to Sub-Com-
mittee F.
As regards the Egyptian delegate?s wish
to reserve the right to raise the question again
in a plenary meeting, I venture to think that
his reservation is superfluous, as Sub-Com-
mittee F will have to make a report to the
Conference.
IV!. van Wettum (Netherlands)
I am sorry to say that I have no instructions
to discuss the question.
Translation : I request the Chairman of
Sub-Committee F to take note of this discus-
sion. I see he is not here himself, so I shall
ask the honourable delegate of Switzerland
to take note of the statements that have
been made here and communicate them to
him.
IV!. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : Egypt is represented on
Sub-Committee F by Dr. Mahfooz. As I
am not entitled to attend the meetings of
this Sub-Committee, may I ask the Confe-
rence?s special permission to do so, as I
would like to take part in the discussion ?
The President
Translation : As first delegate you are
entitled to sit on any of the Sub-Committees.
The Conference rose at 5.55 p.m.
SEVENTEENTH MEETING
Held at Geneva, Tuesday, December 16th, 1924, at 3.30 p.m.
CONTENTS:
57. Question of the Adjournment of the
Conference : Motion submitted by
the President.
President : M. Herluf Zahle.
57. QUESTION OF THE ADJO U RNIV! ENT
OF THE CONFERENCE : MOTION
SUBMITTED BY THE PRESIDENT.
The President
Translation : Ladies and gentlemen, the
meeting is open.
You have before you a motion for the adjourn-
ment of our Conference. You know that, when
this question was first raised, it seemed to me
premature to fix a date for the conclusion of
our work. Now, however, I think that I
can submit a proposal which I hope will meet
with your approval.
It has become clear, from the meetings of
the Sub-Committees, especially during the past
week, that it is impossible for us to complete
the important work of this Conference before
Christmas. If we adjourn, as I suggest, it
will enable all the delegates to have a few days?
holiday and to consult their Governments on
the questions which will appear on the agenda
when the Conference reassembles.
I do not wish to enter into the details of the
work of the Conference or of the Sub-Committees.
It is my personal conviction that their efforts
are bringing us steadily nearer to our goal,
and, although the Sub-Committees have not
yet submitted reports to the plenary Confe-
rence for discussion, a number of important
proposals have been drafted, which 1 am sure
the Conference will be prepared to adopt.
Sub-Committees A, B and C have not yet
concluded their work, but Sub-Committees
D and F have finished their meetings for the
time being, and the work of Sub-Committee
E is completed, although the official text of its
report has not yet been adopted by the members.
In the motion which I have submitted, it
is suggested that, before the adjournment of
the Sub-Committees at the end of this week,
the results of their work should be summarised
and distributed to all the delegates before they
leave Geneva. If this is done, the Committee
of Co-ordination will have full information, at
all events as regards certain questions, and
will be able to resume its discussions directly
the Conference meets again.
My proposal, as you will see, is that we ad-
journ until January 12th, 1925. I know
that this means a great sacrifice for seve-
ral of the members, for there are representatives
here who have come from distant countries
and who naturally wish to return home and
resume their usual occupations.
My proposal is drafted as follows :
?The Second Opium Conference consis-
ting of States invited by the Council of the
League of Nations to consider problems
connected with the extension of the Hague
Convention
"Considering that the Conference has
now been in session for a month ;
?Considering that certain important ques-
tions have arisen in the Conference :
?Decides
?(1) To take advantage of the coming
holiday season to adjourn all plenary
meetings until January 12th, 1925, when
the first order of business shall be the con-
tinuation of the discussion of the motion
of the delegation of the United States of
America ;


( 2 ) To ask its various Sub-Committees know if I shall be able to find an aeroplane
to continue during this week the discussion
of the subjects now under consideration, in
order that the results at which they have
arrived may be distributed at the earliest
possible moment and thoroughly considered
during the period of adjournment,
reserving, however, the right to the Chair-
men of the Sub-Committees to adjourn the
debates according to the wishes of the
members.?
This is the motion which I have the honour
to submit, and which is now open for discussion.
1 call upon M. Sugimura to address the Con-
ference.
ML Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation: The Japanese delegation heartily
supports the motion submitted by the President.
His suggestion is a wise one, and is the only
means of ensuring success. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. Buero, delegate of Uru-
guay, will address the Conference.
Ml. Buero (Uruguay)
Translation : The Uruguayan delegation
is in full agreement with the proposal submitted
by the President.
I most earnestly hope that, on the resumption
of our work, all the difficulties which have arisen
in the Second Conference will have been over-
come, so that we may have every reason to
hope for a successful outcome to our work
a result which is of vital importance to the cause
of humanity and to the prestige of the League.
[Applause.)
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the Con-
ference.
Sir Mlalcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
Mr. President, I desire to support the motion
for adjournment which you have presented to
the Conference. We believe that an adjourn-
ment has become not only desirable but neces-
sary, if the Conference is to reach a satisfac-
tory conclusion of its work.
In accepting the motion as drafted, I wish,
however, to make it clear that our acceptance
must not be taken to imply that the British
delegation has departed from the attitude which
it assumed with regard to the American motion
referred to in paragraph I, or that we admit
that that motion is within the scope of the
Conference.
We associate ourselves with the hopes which
have been expressed that, as a result of the
adjournment, the Conference will be enabled, on
its reassembling, to obtain results which will
be satisfactorv to all.
The President
Translation : Dr. Betances, delegate of the
Dominican Republic, will address the Conference.
IV!. Betances (Dominican Republic)
Translation : I quite understand the reasons
for adjourning the Conference, but I wish
to state that I am unable to accept the Presi-
dent?s proposal. In the first place, I do not
to take me to San Domingo and bring me back
in January. In the second place, I do not
know if my Government will be willing for me
to remain idle in Geneva or Paris for a month.
I regret, therefore, that I am unable to accept
the proposal. I am prepared, if necessary, to
work all through the months of December and
January, in order that the Conference may
arrive at satisfactory results.
The President
Translation : Mr. Clayton, delegate of India,
will address the Conference.
IVlr. Clayton (India)
On behalf of the Indian delegation, 1 desire
to support the motion that has been read to
the Conference, but with the same reserve as
regards the motion of the United States dele-
gation as that made by the honourable delegate
of Great Britain. With him, I hope that, as
the result of the adjournment, this Conference
will finally end successfully.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Bourgois, dele-
gate of France, to address the Conference.
IVI. Bourgois (France)
Translation : The French delegation is in
favour of the motion of adjournment. It
wishes to make it clear, however, that its sup-
port in no way affects its attitude towards the
American motion. It cannot agree to the inclu-
sion of that motion in the programme of the
Conference. I share the hope expressed by my
colleague, Sir Malcolm Delevingne, that the
results of the Conference may prove successful.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Assembly.
SYI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I fully understand the atti-
tude of the Dominican delegate. About two
weeks ago, when the question of adjournment
was raised, I stated that I was in favour of
continuing the work without interruption.
The President?s proposal, however, is a further
proof of the spirit of conciliation which prompted
the Spanish delegation to submit a motion of
adjournment. I therefore support the motion,
which will, I hope, be adopted by the Confe-
rence.
The President
Translation : M. van Wettum, delegate of
the Netherlands, will address the Conference.
IV?. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
I shall vote for the motion submitted by the
President, on the clear understanding that,
while accepting it, the Netherlands delegation
fully maintains its attitude as regards the motion
of the United States delegation. My delegation
cannot admit that the proposal contained therein
falls within the competence of the Conference.
The President
Translation : M. Sze, delegate of China,
will address the Conference.


I should like to say a few words to explain
my vote on the proposal which our distinguished
President has placed before us. I am going
to vote in favour of it. You may perhaps
want me to explain my attitude, for there may
seem to be some inconsistency in my now voting
in favour of the motion when I have always
been against any prolonged adjournment and
in favour of speedy and efficient work.
You will recall that the President said, at the
beginning of this meeting, that he proposed an
adjournment for two reasons : first, to enable
members to have the pleasure of going home and
spending some time with their families, and to
rest before continuing the hard work which lies
before them, and, secondly, that while they are
at home they may have the advantage of dis-
cussing various questions with their Govern-
ments. It is because of this understanding
and assurance, gentlemen, that I appeal to
any of you who may be hesitating about voting
in favour of this motion to support it and
adopt the suggestion which our President has
made.
Although we are to have a rather long adjourn-
ment three weeks those three weeks will
not be wasted, because the members who are
going home will be able to obtain what seems
in some cases to be lacking at present, namely,
further instructions, so that when the Conference
meets again we shall not be delayed by such
excuses as lack of instructions or lack of com-
petence.
1 personally have always been in favour of
going on with our work until it is finished and
against any prolonged adjournment ; in a
case like this, however, when we are dealing
with matters which are of such importance to
the whole world and to future generations,
and when an adjournment would seem to be
of such importance to the whole Conference,
I suppose I can be excused for subordinating
my own convenience to the welfare of huma-
nity. I am therefore willing to disregard my
own convenience and to postpone the discus-
sion of the problems before the Opium Confe-
rence for three weeks. lam sure that, when
we return, we shall be able to arrive
quickly and effectively at the results we all
desire, and that the work we shall accomplish
will be acceptable to all and be such that not
only we, but future generations, may regard it
with satisfaction and pride.
The President has rightly said that there are
many important questions still before the Con-
ference, one of them being, of course, Chapter II
of the American suggestions. There are many
others, however, which have given rise to-diffi-
culties during their discussion by this Conference,
and among these I may mention the one in
which I am most interested, Chapter IV of the
Hague Convention.
I have had the honour of meeting a number
of delegates on this Conference and discussing
Chapter IV with them, and I think I have
fully convinced them that I do not wish to
take advantage of this Conference to raise the
question of extra-territoriality, although I have
always maintained, and still maintain, that
it is unjust and unfair. I do not propose to
raise the question, however, in this Conference.
Before I sit down, let me add one word. I
do not ask those Powers which still possess
extra-territorial rights in China to make any
concession whatsoever ; I simply ask them so
to adjust their measures as to bring them into
harmony with the Chinese laws, thus enabling
China to carry out, not only in the letter but
in the spirit, the Hague Convention. That
result will not only benefit China herself but also
the nationals of those Powers possessing extra-
territorial rights in China and will maintain
the good name of those Powers, besides bene-
fiting humanity at large. For these reasons,
I shall vote in favour of the proposal laid before
us by our distinguished President.
The President
Translation : M. Falcioni, delegate of Italy,
will address the Conference.
IVI. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : In the name of the Italian
delegation, I beg to support the President?s
motion.
I think that I shall be interpreting the feeling
of this Conference if, before we part, I express
our admiration for the manner in which he
has presided over our discussions. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : I call upon the Hon. Stephen
G. Porter, delegate of the United States, to
address the Conference.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America)
The delegation of the United States desires
to join with others in supporting this resolution
proposed by the President. We all feel that a
short adjournment will be helpful in many
ways. This is the season of the year when we
like to be at home, if we can, and I know a
great many of you will be able to return to
your homes. Our delegation will do every-
thing we can to help you to do so. We shall
vote for the resolution. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. Peltzer, delegate of Bel-
gium, will address the Conference.
M. Peltzer (Belgium)
Translation : The Belgian delegation heartily
supports the proposal for adjournment now
before us. It has no reservation to make and
hopes that the issue of the Conference may
prove successful. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. Ferreira, delegate of Por-
tugal, will address the Conference.
ML Ferreira (Portugal) :
Translation : I also wish to support the
President?s proposal. This is the season for
good wishes, and my wish is that the Confe-
rence may prove a complete success.
The President
Translation : Does anyone else desire to
speak on the motion of adjournment now before
us ?
No one wishes to speak.
In submitting this motion, I know that I
am demanding sacrifices from certain members
of the Conference. lam sorry to find that in
the case of the Dominican delegate they
appear unduly great. It is not surprising; I
M. Sze (China)


myself should certainly not risk travelling to you have shown in me throughout our discus-
such distant countries by aeroplane. I hope,
however, that the Dominican Government will
realise the importance of his mission, and that
it will be its desire, as it is that of all of his collea-
gues, that he shall remain with us.
Does anyone desire a vote by roll-call to be
taken on my motion ?
(,Several delegates replied in the negative.)
The President
Translation : Although the Dominican dele-
gate does not, perhaps, desire vote by roll-
call, I understand that he feels it his duty to
vote against my motion ?
M. Betances (Dominican Republic)
Translation : The Dominican delegate has
made sacrifices, as has the Dominican Republic.
I shall be delighted if the latter is prepared to
go on doing so.
The President
Translation : I regard this reply as a reser-
vation.
The statements and reservations of the various
delegations will be noted in the record of this
meeting.
I declare the motion of adjournment unani-
mously adopted.
Adopted.
The President
Translation : Before closing this meeting,
I wish to thank you for the confidence which
sions. I should like especially to thank the
first Italian delegate for his kind remarks, and
the other members of the Conference for their
approval of them.
As I have said, the work already accomplished
has been and will be of the greatest help in
attaining the objects of our Conference. It
is clear from our discussions, and you have seen
for yourselves, that, despite our good-will, we
are faced with great difficulties. Notwith-
standing, I am optimistic ; but my optimism
is of a modest character. Ido not think it is
possible for any one person or any one genera-
tion to succeed in the full attainment of the ideals
which we have in view.
It is the duty of every responsible Govern-
ment and every responsible individual to do all
that is possible under present conditions to
further the ideals of life. Often we shall have
to be content to advance one step at a time along
the road of human progress ; but we shall
advance along that road in a spirit of toleration,
under the aegis of the League, which leads the
way in the great movement of international
co-operation.
The ideal is not like a rocket, which soars
into the air and blazes for a second, only to be
lost in darkness ; it is the steady flame which
burns above the altar in the temple of human-
ity. ( Prolonged applause.)
I offer the members of the Conference all good
wishes for Christmas and the New Year.
[Applause).
The Conference rose at 4.30 p.m.
EIGHTEENTH MEETING
Held at Geneva on Monday, January 12th, 1925, at 3 p .m.
CONTENTS ;
58. Composition of the Canadian Delega-
tion : Departure of M. Beland.
59. Adjournment of the Conference until
January 19th, 1925 : Motion proposed
by the President.
60. Telegram of Sympathy to the Marquis
of Salisbury : Proposal by the Japa-
nese DELEGATION.
President : M. Herluf Zahle.
58. COMPOSITION OF THE CANADIAN
DELEGATION : DEPARTURE OF M.
BELAND.
The President
Translation : I have just received from
M. Beland, first delegate of Canada, a letter
in which he informs me that his Government
has recalled him and that he will therefore
not be able to take further part in the work
of the Second Conference. He tells me at the
same time that he has telegraphed to his
Government asking it to appoint Mr. Riddell
as his successor. The Canadian Government?s
decision will be cabled to us. This cablegram
has not yet arrived.
I must express, for my own part, the regret
that I feel at the departure of M. Beland, who
has been a distinguished member of the Confe-
rence and a most able Chairman of Sub-Com-
mittee A. I think that you will all agree with
me. [Assent.)
59. ADJOURNMENT OF THE CONFERENCE
UNTIL JANUARY 19th, 1925 : MOTION
PROPOSED BY THE PRESIDENT.
The President
Translation : At the meeting of December
16th, 1924, you decided to adjourn the
Conference until to-day. In conformity with
this decision I have therefore convened a
meeting for to-day.
On the Bth of this month I received, through
the Secretary-General of the League, a telegram
from the British Government asking me to
extend this adjournment until January 19th.
As you all know, the British Government has
appointed a member of the British Cabinet,
Lord Salisbury, to take part as first British
delegate in the further work of the Second
Conference. Unfortunately, Lord Salisbury has


just met with a hunting accident which prevents Secretariat. So far, I have received no such tele-
him from being with us to-day. The British
Government attaches great importance to being
represented at the Second Opium Conference
by a member who is so well known and bearing
so illustrious a name. For this reason it
has requested the adjournment of the Confe-
rence until Monday, January 19th, in order to
await Lord Salisbury?s recovery.
As soon as we received this telegram, we
communicated with the different delegations
represented at the Conference, and we have
already received answers from most of them.
Replies have been received from twenty-nine
Governments, all of which, I think, accept the
proposal made by the British Government.
Ten delegations have not replied.
In view of the above circumstances, I beg
to propose the adjournment of the Conference
and the adoption of the following motion :
?The Second Opium Conference decides
to adjourn until Monday, January 19th,
at 3 p.m.??
As this is a motion of order, the discussion of
the question should take place forthwith. I
therefore have the honour to open the discus-
sion on this matter. First, however, I must
tell you that the British Government has in-
formed us that, even if Lord Salisbury were
unable to come to Geneva on Monday next, it
would delegate for that date another member
of the British Cabinet. The British Government
has further expressed its deep regret at the delay
it is causing to the work of this Conference.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh, delegate of Persia,
will address the Conference.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia)
Translation : Mr. President, in summoning
the Conference to discuss the British request to
adjourn the Conference until January 19th, you
have not only acted loyally and correctly but
you have enhanced the prestige of the Conference.
Accordingly, I support your proposal for ad-
journment, particularly as the question con-
cerns the health of one of our colleagues, Lord
Salisbury. We wish him a speedy recovery
and hope to see him among us soon. [Applause.)
The President :
Translation: M. Sze, delegate of China, will
address the Conference.
M. Sze (China)
Before I speak on the motion which the Presi-
dent has placed before the Conference, I should
like to ask for certain information in order to com-
plete my dossier. I understand the President
to say that, before he received the request for
adjournment from the British Government, it
was known that it was the intention of that
Government to appoint a member of the Cabinet
as head of its delegation to this Conference.
May I ask whether the President or the Secre-
tariat has received official information that
Lord Salisbury has been so appointed, and, if so,
on what date they received it ?
There is another point in regard to which
I should like to ask for information in order
to complete my file. The President was good
enough to take the Conference into his confi-
dence and say that the Secretariat, on his
behalf, had sent telegrams to those delegations
the addresses of which had been left with the
gram, and I should therefore like to ask the
President that it may be read to us together
with the request addressed to him or to the
Secretariat by the British Government.
The President
Translation : I must to some extent correct
the statement that I made just now. I was
under the impression that telegrams had
been sent to everyone, but I have just been
told that those delegations which were in
Geneva were informed either by word of
mouth or by telephone.
With regard to the text of the British Govern-
ment's telegram, I have here, not the text
itself, but a summary comprising the most
important points. It reads as follows :
?As the delegations are aware, the Bri-
tish Government telegraphed, on the even-
ing of January 7th, to the Secretary-
General to request that the re-opening of
the Conference should be postponed until
January 19th. The telegram states that
the principal British delegate, Lord Salis-
bury, has met with an accident which
would make it essential for him to take a
week?s rest before undertaking the journey.
The British Government adds that it
intends in any case to send a member of
the Cabinet, even if Lord Salisbury?s
accident should prove more serious than
was anticipated, but that this could not
possibly be arranged at such short notice.
Further, owing to Lord Salisbury?s know-
ledge of the subject, it is very anxious
that he should be retained as principal
delegate. The British Government expresses
its deep regret at the inconvenience caused
to other Governments concerned, but feels
that the only course open to it is to submit
a request for a week?s adjournment.??
I think that I omitted to reply to one of the
questions put to me by the Chinese delegate
concerning the date of Lord Salisbury?s appoint-
ment. lam sorry to have to say that Ido not
know this date, but the Secretariat has asked
for information on the subject.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : Mr. President, I have no
objection to offer to the motion of order which
you are submitting to us at the request of the
British Government. As I was unable to
send a reply before this meeting, I hasten to
declare that I accept the proposed adjournment.
The President
Translation: Does anyone else wish to speak
on the proposal that I have submitted to you ?
M. Sze, delegate of China, will address the
Conference.
ML Sze (China) :
Mr. President and members of the Confe-
rence, the President has just read to you a
motion that the request of the British Govern-
ment for an adjournment for one week should
be granted, that is to say, that this Conference
shall immediately adjourn and shall not meet
again until Monday, January 19th.
I shall not attempt to conceal from you the
mixed feelings, with which I regard your
motion, Mr. President. First of all, I think


that this Conference ought to feel that the British
Government has paid us a great compliment in
appointing as its chief delegate so distinguished
a member of the Cabinet as the Marquis of
Salisbury. I am sure that I am voicing the
sentiment of everybody here when I say that
we all heartily welcome the news and wish
Lord Salisbury a speedy recovery. I hope
that he will soon be able to come among us
and give us the benefit of his knowledge of the
question that we now have before us.
I say that I regard the motion before us with
mixed feelings, because the members of the
Conference are well aware of the desire which
I have expressed again and again, not only here
but elsewhere, that this Conference and the
First Conference should bring their work to
an end as quickly as is consistent with efficiency,
and shall achieve a result of which we shall
be proud and which our descendants will
look upon with admiration.
In spite of that desire, as I am asking for
results, I am in favour of the motion for
adjournment. First of all, I think it is a matter
of international courtesy to grant the request,
when one Government asks other Governments
for an adjournment and, speaking on behalf
of the Chinese delegation, I gladly agree that
we should comply with the wish of the British
Government. In order that we may work
with success and obtain results of which we
shall all be proud, we ought to welcome and
await with patience the coming of the Marquis
of Salisbury to this Conference.
But while favouring and endorsing your
motion, Mr. President, I may say that some
of my friends will tell me that I am taking a
great risk in doing so. It will be remembered
that, during the third meeting of the First Con-
ference, it was proposed that the order of the
agenda should be reversed. I then asked the
President and members of the Conference that
the work should be continued and that, in
view of the suddenness of the proposal, the
change of agenda should be delayed two days
in order that I might communicate with my
Government on certain points that had arisen
since my arrival here.
The first delegate of India immediately rose
and read me a lesson. He said that, if this
Conference did not agree to what was asked
of it, M. Sze would be held responsible for the
delay, and an English newspaper agency
thought that the incident was of sufficient value
to send it round the world. Further, the late
first delegate of the British Empire expressed
his agreement with the views of the Indian
delegate.
In spite of that, if people ask me why, seeing
that two months ago others were not even
willing to tolerate such a reasonable request
on my part, I come here to-day and express
myself as being in favour of your proposal,
my answer would be that it is a matter of inter-
national courtesy which one Government owes
to another, that when one Government makes
to the other Governments such a request as
that made by the British Government, those
Governments should, as I am doing now, go
out of their way to agree to it, even at conside-
rable inconvenience.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Sugimura, dele-
gate of Japan, to address the Conference.
M. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation : As the Japanese delegation
has not been able to reply sooner to the tele-
gram from our distinguished President, I shall
venture to explain in a few words our point
of view with regard to the question at issue.
At our last meeting before Christmas, the
Conference decided that the first question to
be dealt with on resuming our meetings would
be the American draft relating to the suppres-
sion after ten years of opium-smoking. Conse-
quently, our discussions cannot deal with any
other matter.
As divergent views arose concerning the
American proposal, it was very wisely decided
to adjourn our work during the Christmas and
New Year holidays.
The British delegation, supported by other
delegations, took part in the discussion and
maintained its point of view energetically.
For this reason its participation in the conti-
nuation of our discussions is necessary. No
fruitful and practical work can be accomplished
by the League of Nations apart from the Bri-
tish Empire and without its valuable assistance.
This is an imperative reason for accepting the
request for a temporary adjournment, which
we are at present considering.
It is certainly a pity that a large number of
delegations are gathered here and are unable
to re-open the questions which still remain
to be settled. More important, however, than
the question of time is that of the success of
this Conference. In order to achieve this, we
must be ready to make sacrifices in that spirit
of conciliation without which no big interna-
tional work can be accomplished. If all
delegations continue to be animated by this spirit
of conciliation as far as the limits of justice
allow, I am convinced that our work, once
resumed, will reach a speedy conclusion. It
rests with us during this week of waiting to
help forward the success of the Conference
by employing our leisure in carefully consider-
ing the questions at issue and in seeking the
best means to be adopted in order that our
work may prove a benefit to humanity and a
source of moral satisfaction to ourselves, who
should be humanity?s champions. {Applause.)
The President
Translation M. Peltzer, delegate of Bel-
gium, will address the Conference.
IV!. Peltzer (Belgium) :
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, instead of merely replying by tele-
gram, I have made a point of coming to Geneva
in order to acquaint the Conference with the
views of the Belgian Government on the request
for adjournment made by the British Govern-
ment. In taking this journey, I was moved
by feelings of very real sympathy with our
colleagues who are already assembled at Geneva.
I fully realise that it is extremely inconvenient
for many of them to be here at this time of
year without any definite occupation while
urgent work is awaiting them elsewhere.
As soon as I received Sir Eric Drummond?s
first telegram, I informed our President that
the Belgian Government had no objection to
the postponement of our meetings for a few
days. I see in the request of the British Govern-
ment a happy omen for the realisation of the
objects for which the Opium Conference was


convened. Accordingly, I support the proposal
just submitted to us by the President.
The President
Translation : M. Pernambuco, delegate of
Brazil, will address the Conference.
IV!. Pernambuco (Brazil)
Translation : The Brazilian delegation was
not informed of the British delegation s request
for the adjournment of the Conference. It
was for this reason that it did not express an
opinion. We feel, however, that out of courtesy
towards our colleagues, as the Chinese delegate
has just said, we should agree to the adjourn-
ment. I therefore beg to support the Presi-
dent?s proposal.
The President
Translation : I regret that the Brazilian
delegation should not have received the tele-
gram, which was sent to the address which
you yourself had given. If you remained at
that address and the telegram did not reach
you, there must have been some mistake.
Mr. Shepherd (Australia) :
Unfortunately, the telegram did not reach
me before I left for Geneva, and therefore I
was unable to reply to your enquiry. I have
no objection to offer to the proposed adjourn-
ment, although I very much regret the cause
of and necessity for it.
IV!. de Palacios (Spain) ;
Translation : W 7 e now know the views of
the delegations from whom no answer to the
telegram was received. Perhaps it would also
be useful to know which delegations did send
replies.
The President
Translation : I shall be very glad to comply
with the first Spanish delegate?s request. The
following countries have agreed to the adjourn-
ment of the Conference ; Albania, Belgium,
Bolivia, Bulgaria, Canada, Chile, Cuba, Czecho-
slovakia, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece,
Hungary, India, Irish Free State, Italy, Luxem-
burg, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Persia, Siam,
Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, Uruguay
and Venezuela. .
The United States of America signified their
acceptance verbally, but not foimally, the dele-
gation still being at Geneva. Poitugal has
also agreed to the adjournment and has made
the following statement :
"Portugal agrees to an adjournment, pro-
vided that it is not extended beyond March
10th. M. Ferreira proposes that, as a
certain number of the delegates are here
at Geneva, part of the time between
January 12th and 19th should be employed
in co-ordinating the work of the different
Sub-Committees and exchanging views in
order to ascertain the opinions of the
various delegations.??
Brazil and Australia have just agreed to the
adjournment, as has Egypt, which was among
the countries from which no reply had been
received up to to-day. Japan has just agreed
to the adjournment. Finland and 1 oland
have not yet replied. Roumania and the King-
dom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes are not
represented here to-day. dhe Dominican Re-
public has not yet given a formal reply, nor
has any reply been received from the Free City
of Danzig.
m. Sze (China) ;
I notice that China is on the list of those
States which have accepted. I regret to state
that in the reply which I sent to the Secretary
I did not say that I accepted or that I did not
accept. I simply said that the question of
adjournment was decided by the Conference
at the last meeting and therefore any question
with reference to a further adjournment was
in the hands of the Conference itself. May
I make that correction ?
The President
Translation : I mentioned that I had added
to my list, in pencil, the names of the delegations
which had to-day agreed to the adjournment.
That is why China is included in the list.
IV!. Sze (China)
I beg your pardon. I wish to ask one ques-
tion for information. If we adjourn to-day,
does it mean that at the next meeting of this
Conference on January 19th the first order of
business will be, as it is to-day, the discussion
of Chapter II of the American proposals ?
The President
Translation : I understand that M. Sze s
question is addressed to me as President. _ In
my view, the answer is in the affirmative.
I had the text of the American motion distri-
buted to-day, because the Conference, when it
adjourned before Christmas, decided that the
first item on its agenda should be the conti-
nuation of the discussion of that motion.
IVI. Toivola (Finland) :
Translation : In view of the President s
statement, I feel that the attitude of Finland
should be put on record. I beg to accept the
President?s proposal for adjournment.
The President
Translation : Does anyone else wish to
speak on the motion for adjournment ?
IV!. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : In the name of Poland and
the Free City of Danzig, I beg to accept the
President?s motion.
IVI. Falcioni (Italy) :
Translation : As this may be regarded as
a matter of international courtesy, I think
the decision should be taken by a vote of the
Conference. It would be an excellent oppor-
tunity of proving not only to Great Britain but
also to the whole world that courtesy is the
ruling factor in the Second Conference.
IVI. Betances (Dominican Republic)
Translation : I beg to support the President?s
motion, inspired as it is by a spirit of interna-
tional courtesy. I should like to give the
Secretariat my addresses in Paris and Geneva
in order that they may be duly noted, for
I did not receive the telegram about the
adjournment.


1 ranslation : The telegram sent to the
Dominican delegate was addressed to him at
Geneva. The Secretariat informs me that
it had no address in Paris. lam exceedingly
sorry for the mistake.
M, El Guindy (Egypt) ;
Translation : We left our addresses with
the Secretariat in order that we might be
informed of any urgent matters, but when I
returned to Geneva I found a letter from the
Secretary-General, not a telegram.
The President
Translation : The mistake was probably
owing to the fact that when you left Geneva
you were asked to give your address, and you
no doubt gave the address to which you wished
documents to be sent.
IVI. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : The letter to which I refer
was sent to an address which I had not given
and at which I had never been.
The President
Translation : I hope that the Egyptian
delegate will accept my apologies.
Does anyone else wish to speak on my
motion ?
Since no one else wishes to speak, the dis
cussion on this motion is closed.
In reply to M. Sze?s question as to the date
of Lord Salisbury?s appointment as first
British delegate to the Second Conference, I
shall now read an official letter, dated January
7th, from His Britannic Majesty?s Vice-Consul
at Geneva.
?I have the honour to inform you, in
accordance with telegraphic instructions
received from His Majesty?s Principal
Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, that
the Most Honourable the Marquis of
Salisbury, G.C.V.0., has been appointed
first British delegate for the remaining
sessions of the International Conference
on Opium.?
I cannot tell M. Sze the date upon which the
British Cabinet took this decision.
IVI. Sze (China)
Will you permit me to say a word with refe-
rence to the additional information that you
have been good enough to give us ? What
I really wanted to know, Mr. President, was
whether you had received a note from the
British Government and, if so, when, because
you said that the whole Conference knew that
the British Government had the intention of
appointing a Cabinet Minister.
That fact was not known to me and that
was why I asked you whether a note had been
received and, if so, on what date. The additional
information you have just given us, unless'my
lack of knowledge of the French language gives
me a wrong impression, is liable to convey
something which I had not in my mind. My
reason for asking the question was that Sir
Malcolm Delevingne was not only chief of the
British delegation to this Conference but he was
also head of the British delegation to the First
Conference, and it is a matter of interest to me,
in view of the fact that the First Conference
has not yet terminated its work.
I would therefore like to know whether it
is stated in the note from the British Govern-
ment that the appointment of the noble Marquis
is to be for this Conference only, or also for the
First Conference. I did not ask you nor did
I intimate a desire to know when that appoint-
ment was decided upon by the British Cabinet.
I am sure you will permit me to make this
explanation in order that there may not be
ascribed to me a motive which was not in
my mind.
The President
Translation : I did not think that there
was an unexpressed motive behind the Chinese
delegate?s question ; I realised that he simply
wished for information.
As regards the second question, which I
now understand, I have the honour to inform
him that the only communication brought
to my notice was the letter signed by the British
\ ice-Consul, in which the following English
phrase occurs : ?for the remaining sessions
of the International Conference on Opium?.
This presumably refers to the Second Confe-
rence. Ido not think that it refers to the British
delegation or to representatives of the British
delegation to the First Conference.
Before taking a vote on the motion for ad-
journment, I wish to direct your attention to
a suggestion made by the Polish delegate, who
is Chairman of Sub-Committee B. He won-
dered if it would not be possible for the latter
to go on with its work this week, if a sufficient
number of its members could meet together.
Should you agree to his suggestion, my motion
for adjournment should be amended so as to
read : ?The Second Opium Conference decides
to postpone its plenary meetings until Monday,
January 19th?, for, if you adopted my motion
as it stands at present, it would be impossible
for Sub-Committee B to meet this week.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : Mr. President, Sub-Committee
B includes representatives of all the producing
countries. Neither the Turkish nor Greek
delegates are present, nor is the Kingdom
of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes represented,
so that I think that, setting aside the question
of courtesy, there is no object in Sub-Committee
B starting work, as it would have to begin over
again when those delegates, who are now absent,
return.
The President
Translation : No formal proposal was sub-
mitted either by me or by the Polish delegate ;
it was simply a suggestion. I think that what
the Egyptian delegate says is very true. We
could hardly arrange for a meeting of Sub-
Committee B when some of the members are
not present, as they were counting on an adjourn-
ment until next week. This question will
therefore be dropped.
We shall now vote on the motion for adjourn-
ment. Do you wish for a vote by roll-call ?
IVI. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : I propose that we vote by a
show of hands, if that is possible.
The President


The President
Translation : Personally, I am not in
favour of that method.
As no objection has been raised to my motion
for adjournment, I beg to announce that the
Conference will resume its work at 3 p.m. on
January 19th. [Applause.)
60. TELEGRAM OF SYMPATHY TO THE
MARQUIS OF SALISBURY; PROPOSAL
BY THE JAPANESE DELEGATION.
The President
Translation : I have much pleasure in read-
ing the following proposal, which has been
submitted by the Japanese delegation :
?The Japanese delegation proposes that
the Conference should request the Presi-
dent to send to the Marquis of Salisbury
a telegram conveying its sympathy and
expressing its best wishes for his speedy
recovery.?
I have not had the text of this proposal dis-
tributed, as I did not think there would be any
discussion on the matter. May I take it as
agreed to by all my colleagues ? [Assent.)
I shall communicate this resolution to the
British Government as soon as possible.
The Conference rose at 4.25 p.m.

61. REPLY FROM THE MARQUIS OF
SALISBURY TO THE TELEGRAM OF
SYMPATHY SENT BY THE CONFE-
RENCE.
The President
Translation : I declare the meeting open.
At our last meeting, on January 12th, the
Conference, on the proposal of the Japanese
delegation, instructed me to send a telegram
of sympathy to the Marquis of Salisbury. I
carried out that very welcome task on the same
day and I have just received a reply which
reads as follows :
?I have received the kind telegram sent
me on behalf of the Second Opium Confe-
rence and wish to express deep gratitude
to Your Excellency and members of Confe-
rence for good'wishes, and I regret deeply
that my accident has prevented me having
the honour of meeting the delegates and
taking part in their work.?
The telegram was noted.
62. WELCOME TO THE NEW DELEGATES
TO THE CONFERENCE.
The President
Translation : Before beginning our work,
I think I shall be voicing the views of all the
members of the Second Opium Conference
when I extend a welcome to the new chief
delegates who have joined us to-day. I wel-
come Viscount Cecil, one of the most prominent
figures of the League of Nations. I welcome
a member of the French Government, M.
Daladier, Minister for the Colonies, whom we are
very glad to see among us, and also His Excel-
lency M. Loudon, who is very well known
and very popular in Geneva. I offer our
warm greetings to all these gentlemen.
Last Monday, I announced that the first
delegate for Canada had left and that he
would be replaced by Mr. Riddell. I welcome
that gentleman also. I beg the new delegates
to hand in their credentials to the Secretary-
General of the League of Nations. I would
also ask the Vice-President of the Conference,
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt, who is Chairman
of the Committee on Credentials, to take_ the
necessary steps for convening that Committee
in order to examine the full powers in question
and to inform me in due course at what date
he will be able to report to the Conference on
this subject.
I would also ask those delegates who have
not yet done so to notify their addresses to
the Secretary of the Conference.
At our meeting held on December 16th, we
decided to adjourn our plenary meetings until
January 12th. You know that there was a
further postponement at that date and you
know the reasons for it.
The first question on our agenda is the con-
tinuation of the discussion on the motion sub-
mitted by the delegation of the United States.
We shall, therefore, resume our discussion on
this question, which is the only one on the
agenda of this meeting.
63. PREPARED OPIUM : CHAPTER II OF
THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA MOTION SUB-
MITTED BYTHE DELEGATION OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA : CON-
TINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.


Translation : I call on Viscount Cecil, first
delegate of the British Empire, to address the
Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, in the
first place I have to appeal for your indulgence,
because I have not had the great advantage
of being present at your previous discussions.
It is therefore quite probable that I shall say
things which are commonplaces to you, who
are much more familiar with your work than
I can hope to be. But thus early I want to
make clear the position which my Government
takes on the question which is now before you.
The question before the Conference is a motion
submitted by the delegation of the United
States of America to the effect that the propo-
sals contained in Chapter II of their suggestions
should be referred by the Conference to the
appropriate Committee. Those proposals deal
with the question of opium-smoking, and the
representatives of my country and of other
countries immediately raised the question whe-
ther this Conference was competent to consider
them. I do not think that I need say very
much on the technical aspect of that question,
because it has already been dealt with very
fully. I shall merely repeat ?for lam afraid
that it must be a repetition the main argu-
ment which seems to me to bear on the subject,
and which, with the greatest respect, appears
to me, I confess, to be conclusive.
We sit here to discharge certain duties which
are defined in resolutions of the Assembly of
the League of Nations. We came here on the
suggestion of that body, and it was on its
resolutions and on the terms of its resolutions
that the various Governments accepted the
invitation to the Conference and sent their
delegates. The question of competence there-
fore appears to me to depend on the true
construction of those resolutions and on nothing
else.
It is quite clear at least I venture to think
it is quite clear that the Conference cannot
extend its mandate except by unanimous con-
sent ; it can only deal with and decide questions
which are contained in the document which
summons it ; and it would be a precedent,
as it appears to me, of the greatest gravity if a
Conference were to take upon itself to extend
a mandate that has been given to it. The
whole question therefore, and the only question,
as I venture very respectfully to submit to
my colleagues, is, What is the true construction
of the resolutions by virtue of which we are
meeting here ?
The Conference is very well aware that there
are two resolutions which are important, one in
virtue of which what is called the First Confe-
rence was summoned, and one in virtue of
which the Second Conference was summoned.
I submit that, taking these resolutions as they
stand and construing them in their grammatical
sense, it is fairly clear that it was intended to
divide the problems that we have to consider
into two parts, and to give one part to the First
Conference and the other to the Second
Conference.
I had better read the whole resolution in
virtue of which the First Conference was
summoned :
?The Assembly approves the proposal
of the Advisory Committee that the Govern-
ments concerned should be invited imme-
diately to enter into negotiations with
a view to the conclusion of an agreement
as to the measures for giving effective
application in the Far Eastern territories
to Part II of the Convention [that is
the Hague Convention, and Part II is
the part which deals with opium-smoking ]
and as to a reduction of the amount of
raw opium to be imported for the purpose
of smoking in those territories where
it is temporarily continued, and as to the
measures which should be taken by the
Government of the Republic of China to
bring about the suppression of the illegal
production and use of opium in China, and
requests the Council to invite those
Governments to send representatives with
plenipotentiary powers to a Conference
for the purpose [ that is, for the purpose
quoted ] and to report to the Council at
the earliest possible date.?
That is the mandate of the First Conference.
It seems quite clear that it is to deal with the
question of opium-smoking.
Then comes the mandate of the Second
Conference :
?The Assembly, having noted with satis-
faction that, in accordance with the hope
expressed in the fourth resolution adopted
by the Assembly in 1922, the Advisory
Committee has reported that the informa-
tion now available makes it possible for the
Governments concerned to examine, with
a view to the conclusion of an agreement, the
question of the limitation of the amounts of
morphine, heroin or cocaine and their
respective salts to be manufactured ; of
the limitation of the amounts of raw opium
and the coca leaf to be imported for that
purpose and for other medicinal and scien-
tific purposes ; and of the limitation of
the production of raw opium and the coca
leaf for export to the amount required
for such medicinal and scientific purposes,
requests the Council, as a means of giving
effect to the principles submitted by the
representatives of the United States of
America, and to the policy which the
League, on the recommendation of the
Advisory Committee, has adopted, to invite
the Governments concerned to send repre-
sentatives with plenipotentiary powers to
a Conference for this purpose [ that is,
the purpose of limitation already quoted,
namely, limitation in connection with the
manufacture of morphine, heroin and co-
caine ] to be held, if possible, imme-
diately after the conference mentioned in
Resolution V.?
I confess, therefore, that it seems to me to be
quite plain I may be wrong, but it seems
to me quite plain that the intention of
the Assembly, or the intention of those resolu-
tions, for that is what we have to consider,
was to give the question of opium-smoking
to the First Conference, and the question,
broadly speaking, of drugs to the Second Con-
ference, and that that was the division of
work which was arranged by the Assembly
in order to arrive at practical results. The
The President


British Government of course may be wrong
that may happen to any Government . but
that is its very strong view, and we have
no instructions to take part in the Conference
except upon that basis.
That is all that I propose to say on the tech-
nical question of competence, but I desire to
add some observations to show that this divi-
sion of the subject into two parts is in accord-
ance with what has previously taken place,
and is a probable and likely construction of
the resolution, having regard to the whole
history of the question so far as it is germane
to this subject.
I naturally do not propose to go fully into
the whole of the questions involved ; that
would take you too long and me too long.
My object is merely to go sufficiently into them
for the purposes of the argument I am present-
ing to you.
As I ~ apprehend the. question we have to
consider, there are four uses of opium, hirst,
the medical and scientific use. No question
arises on that point because, naturally, we all
recognise that, from a medical and scientific
point of view, the use of opium is, or ought to
be, beneficial, and nothing else.
Secondly, there is the question of eating
opium. I think we may say that, generally
speaking, that practice is regarded as undesir-
able ; but in one quarter of the globe, and so
far as I know in one quarter only, it is habitual
and has been habitual for very many centuries ;
that region is India. As I understand the
evidence that has been before you, it is cer-
tainly true that, when taken in moderation
under the conditions that prevail in India,
opium is probably harmless, and, according to
a good many opinions, it may even be useful.
There is, I am quite aware, a great deal of
dispute and discussion on this point. I per-
sonally do not wish to express any opinion ;
indeed, my opinion would be quite valueless ;
but it is probable, it seems to me, that this
is a question of degree. Undoubtedly, ad least
so it seems to me, there is a use of opium in
India which may be called quasi-medical,
where it is used in order to combat physical
disabilities and physical disease without actual
medical prescription, but still really for medical
purposes, and there its use certainly seems
to be unobjectionable.
Thirdly, there is opium-smoking, Speaking
personally, I am prepared to say that, so fai
as I can see, opium-smoking is never beneficial ;
it is almost always harmful and, if pursued
to excess, is highly deleterious. That certainly
is the view of the British Parliament, which
has made it a criminal offence to smoke opium
in England, and it is certainly the policy of
the British Government to bring opium-smoking
to an end throughout the Empire at the earliest
possible moment.
I venture to think that any fair, candid and
impartial examination of the conduct of the
British Empire during the last few years will
confirm that statement, and I may refer, as a
striking example of what has been done, to
the action taken by the Indian Government
in Burma, where it has very actively pursued
its object of suppressing opium-smoking and
has reduced it to something like one-seventh,
I think it is, of what it was a year or two ago
and has done it, I may remark incidentally
I am ashamed to have to say such a thing
without the slightest consideration of the
pecuniary consequences involved in such a
policy.
The fourth use of opium, and I venture very
respectfully to remind the Conference that
this is by far the most important question that
we have to consider, is what is called drug-
addiction ; that is to say, the habitual use
not of opium, prepared or raw, but of its
derivatives, morphine and heroin. I should, of
course, include also the. derivative of coca,
cocaine, which undoubtedly is the gravest
possible evil. This is much the most serious
aspect of the case that we have to consider.
I was amazed to read or hear the other day
that this was a question in which the West
was interested but not the East. I cannot
imagine who could have thought such a foolish
thing. It is an evil which unfortunately afflicts
both the East and the West, the countries
which believe themselves to be the most
advanced in civilisation no less than the coun-
tries which are less advanced. It is a terrible
social evil, producing physical and moral degra-
dation, and I understand from the represen-
tatives of the United States that it is one of
the evils which is, I will not say particularly,
but markedly, bad in America, where it is caus-
ing the American Government the greatest
anxiety ; indeed, I have seen figures stating
that the consumption of opium per head is
very much greater in America than in India.
It is undoubtedly a very terrible thing and though
it may be, and I think is, less in my own country
than in some others, yet wherever it exists
it is a very serious evil. It is of the utmost
importance that this Conference, whatever
view you may take of its mandate, which was
primarily called to deal with that evil, should
not be led astray from dealing with it. This
is by far the greatest evil with which we have
to deal and it would be criminal to allow our-
selves to be diverted in any way from doing
our utmost to suppress it.
Further, I venture very respectfully to say
that, if we are really usefully to approach
this question and incidentally the question
of competence, we must very clearly keep in
our minds the distinction between the various
problems. All of them are important and,
as I say, the question of drug-addiction is
of the gravest possible importance.
I venture to say that these questions
are entirely distinct. That fact is very
important from the point of view of the argu-
ment that I am presenting. Take first the
eating of raw opium. This is, as I have already
indicated, purely an Indian question. As far
as I know, it is exclusively an Indian custom,
and whereas there are, as I have said, grave
differences of opinion as to its harmfulness,
there can be no difference of opinion as _to
the fact that it is a purely domestic question
in India. It is for the Indian Government to
decide under what restrictions and what condi-
tions Indian opium should be used by the
Indian population under its control.
As far as that part of the matter is concerned,
it does not appear to me to be a question for
international interference at all. I am one
of those who think that international inter-
ference in such domestic questions would be
a very dangerous precedent to establish, and
one that we should guard against with the
utmost care ; one which, if we were not to


guard against it, might well bring all inter-
national action into disrepute as an intolerable
interference with national sovereignty.
I venture to remind the Conference that this
is the view taken of this question in the Hague
Convention. I shall not trouble the Conference
by reading the actual wording of the Conven-
tion, but I think that this is an accurate state-
ment of it : that the provisions dealing with
raw opium only require the Governments to
control the production and distribution of the
raw opium and to regulate the export and
import of it. There are no provisions deter-
mining the uses to which raw opium is or is
not to be put, or requiring other things with
regard to it.
This is quite reasonable. It is reasonable
that there should be international regulations
as to the import and export of raw opium, for
at the moment when export or import takes
place it becomes, or may become, an inter-
national question ; but what is done inside
a country with a drug grown in that country
is a domestic question and not one for inter-
national interference, though it may well be a
matter for national agitation or national action.
The word ?control? is therefore absolutely
right, and it is control which we have a right,
as an international body, to require from the
Indian Government ; that it should so far
control the raw opium as to make it quite
certain that none of it is exported save for those
purposes which are allowed by international
agreement. Unless that control is established,
it is evident that grave abuses may occur.
Although I am not in any way representing
the Indian Government, I am interested, as
representing the British Empire, in what goes
on in India, and as a matter of fact, as far
as I am concerned, I am here to say that the
control of raw opium in India is excellent. It
is the only really effective control there can
be ; the opium is controlled from the moment
it is planted until the moment its fruit is ga-
thered. The production of these drugs is
controlled, and this, I venture to think (and I
believe it is generally agreed now), is the
really effective method to adopt. Unless growth
and production are controlled, it will be very
difficult to control the use of the drugs.
In India the whole process is controlled
the growth of the opium, the collection of it
the distribution of it everything is controlled
by the Government, and controlled effectively.
No opium is exported except on the authority
or at the request of other Governments. There
is no commercial export as such. There is
no hawking of opium in order to sell it to anyone
who is willing to buy it. lam not going into
the details of the control now, because that
question will possibly arise at a later stage
of our discussions. In any case, it would not
be appropriate here.
There is only one other point which I wish
to raise as regards opium in India, but it is
a very important point. Indian opium is
not in practice used (I am not dealing, of course,
with exceptional use) for the production of
those, harmful drugs heroin, morphine and
the like. This is due to technical reasons, the
chief of which, I am told, is that the morphia
content of Indian opium is so much lower
than the morphia content of Persian or Turkish
opium that it does not pay to use Indian
opium for producing morphine, heroin, etc.
Whatever the reason may be whether the
above explanation is correct or not is of no
importance the fact remains that Indian
opium is not used for the production of these
drugs, and therefore it has nothing whatever
to do with the great problem, the very terrible
problem, of drug-addiction, which is, I venture
to repeat, the main subject which this Confe-
rence, at any rate, has to consider.
I pass now to the smoking of opium. Just
as the eating of opium is almost exclusively
an Indian question, so the smoking of opium
is almost exclusively, though not quite, a
Chinese question. I believe indeed, I know
that there are some people in Burma, and
some, I believe, in Siam, who smoke opium ;
but, broadly speaking, it so happens that the
Chinese are the only people who smoke opium,
apart from the two exceptions to which I have
just referred. It is not possible to account
for the habits and customs which grow up in
one nation and not in another. The above
fact is due, however, to. these inexplicable
customs, which may perhaps have some physio-
logical basis, of which, however, I know
nothing.
Undoubtedly, those countries which have
subjects or residents of Chinese race within their
borders are anxious to diminish the smoking
of opium. The British Government is most
anxious to do so, and the Chinese Government
also. I wish to make it quite clear that, as
far as I am concerned, I accept to the full the
assurances of the Chinese Government that it
is most anxious to put an end to the smoking
of opium.
As I have just mentioned India, I want to
make it clear that India has nothing to do
with this problem of opium-smoking as such.
It is quite true that a good deal of Indian
opium is exported for the purpose of smoking,
but there is practically no smoking in India,
except in Burma, where, as I say, drastic
steps have been taken to reduce it. There
is no export from India except at the direct
request of other Governments. India supplies
the opium which other Governments ask it
to supply, and does nothing else.
As a member of the British Government, I
can testify that neither the Indian Government
in Calcutta nor the India Office at home has
ever taken any part whatever in the discussion
of what should be the policy of the British
Empire in regard to the suppression of opium-
smoking. They have left it entirely to the
British Imperial authorities, acting on the advice
of the local governments.
Although I do not think any member of
this Conference has ever said so, it has been
said outside this Conference that India has
been anxious to keep opium-smoking alive for
her own interests. There is not the least
truth in that suggestion. On the contrary,
the Indian Government has always shown
itself absolutely impartial in the matter, and
has not intervened (as, indeed, it is not its
duty to intervene) in the policy of the British
Empire outside its own limits.
I wish to repeat again that this question of
opium-smoking has nothing whatever to do
with the question of drug-addiction, but is
an entirely separate question. The opium used
for smoking is, broadly speaking, either Indian
opium of Chinese opium. In both cases, for
the reasons that I have already given, the


opium, whether it comes from China or India,
is not used for the manufacture of those
poisonous drugs morphine, heroin and the like.
If opium-smoking were stopped altogether,
there would be no effect whatever on the ques-
tion of drug-addiction, which is the serious
question with which we have to deal. I
venture to impress that point rather strongly
on the Conference, because I think iT serves
to show how entirely separate these questions
are, and that they ought to be treated as such.
If one wanted to press that argument to its
logical conclusion and I am not afraid of its
logical conclusion one would be forced to say
that if the opium production, as it at present
exists, were maintained and if all opium-
smoking were stopped, the markets of the world
would be flooded with a vast quantity of opium
which would not be at all suitable for the manu-
facture of drugs and which, in such circum-
stances, might conceivably be turned to that pur-
pose. I do not want to press that argument,
because it is a purely hypothetical one. It
is enough for me to say at the present stage
that opium-smoking and drug-addiction are
two entirely distinct problems which have to
be dealt with separately and cannot be mixed
up if we want to keep our minds clear on the
subject.
Indeed, these two problems are so treated in
the Hague Convention. They are all included
in one Convention but are treated entirely
separately. I am informed though I will
not pledge myself to this that, when the
Hague Convention was being drawn up, it
was suggested, I believe by one of the American
delegates, that there should be two Conventions
to deal with the two subjects separately.
Whether that is so or not, it is a fact that they
are dealt with absolutely separately in the
Convention itself.
In this connection, I trust that the Confe-
rence will bear with me if I explain the British
attitude on this point. I have already said
that the British Government desires to suppress
opium-smoking. If it did not so desire, as
in fact it does, in the interests of good govern-
ment and for the benefit of its subjects, it is
bound to do so under the terms of the Hague
Convention, It entered into the obligation
to suppress the use of prepared opium, that is,
opium for smoking, under the terms of the
second chapter of the Hague Convention.
It was recognised, however, that it could not
be suppressed at once and provision was made
for its gradual and effective suppression, with
due regard to the varying circumstances of
the countries concerned.
I want to say most explicitly and I was
amazed to hear that in responsible quarters
there was some misapprehansion on the point -
that the British Government fully accepts that
obligation. It has no intention of withdrawing
or receding from it in any degree, and its object
is to suppress the smoking of opium, but to
do so practically and effectively.
It is quite true that the smoking of opium
is not a custom in England ; it does not there-
fore affect the English people, that is to say,
the people living in Great Britain ; but it
does affect the subjects of the British Empire,
and in this matter the British Government natu-
rally makes no distinction between one group
of people and another. We regard this ques-
tion as an extremely serious one, and we are
most anxious to co-operate in every possible
way that we regard as useful and practicable,
with a view to the suppression of opium-
smoking. I beg all my colleagues in the Con-
ference to accept that assurance as representing
absolutely the intention and desire of the British
Government.
I venture to think that our past conduct has
shown that it is our desire. Ido not want to
draw any comparisons, naturally, but we
have always been among those who are most
active in the suppression of the evils of the
opium traffic.
As the members of the Conference are per-
fectly well aware, it was only on the signature
of the Treaty of Versailles that the Hague
Convention came into operation, and I think
I am not wrong in saying that it was at the
instance of the British representatives at the
Peace Conference it was certainly with
their full support that the relevant provi-
sion was included in the Treaty of Versailles.
Since that date the British Government has
done what it could indeed, it began to take
action before to suppress what has been one
of the chief causes of the abuse of the opium
traffic namely, the farming of opium for pri-
vate profit. It has thought it right to make the
Governments of its Possessions responsible for
dealing with this matter so as to avoid the
trade being pushed by people with a view to
making an undue or increased profit out of the
sale of opium. It has greatly increased through-
out its own direct Dominions and, I believe
I may add, throughout the self-governing
Empire, the severity of the legislation against
the abuse of the opium traffic. It has enacted
or caused to be enacted more than one law in
all parts of the Empire, with the object of
diminishing the use of opium for smoking.
There is yet another thing which we in this
room are entitled to consider. It was, I believe,
at the instance of the British member on the
Advisory Commission that the whole of this
movement, in which we are now taking part,
was initiated. The British Government, I
venture to submit, has shown itself most
anxious throughout to see opium-smoking
suppressed. It has never allowed, and never
dreamed of allowing, financial considerations
not that any financial consideration could affect
Great Britain, as it would not matter at all to
Great Britain whatever happened to the opium
traffic which might affect its various Colo-
nies and Possessions to interfere for a moment
with the policy of suppressing this evil.
I may remind the Conference of the action
which the Indian Government took, with the
full support and approval of the British Govern-
ment, in abandoning the very considerable
revenue it used to derive from the sale of
opium to China.
You will remember that, as soon as the Indian
Government was satisfied that the Chinese
Government had suppressed the growth of
opium throughout the provinces of China, it
agreed to abandon the export of opium to
China at an earlier date than that to which
it was bound by the agreement into which
it had entered.
I want to say, and I hope my Chinese
colleague will believe me when I say, that
there is nothing further from my wish than
to make any criticism of or attack on the
Chinese Government. On the contrary, the


British Government has the greatest pos- that it is the unanimous view of the British
sible admiration for the action taken by the
Chinese Government on that occasion and for
its very wonderful achievement. By energy,
vigour and self-sacrifice it put a stop, practi-
cally throughout the whole dominion of China,
to the growth of opium. Had it been possible
for that state of things to continue, there is
not the slightest doubt that the position would
be very different from and very much more
hopeful than it is at the present time.
Unhappily, and through no fault of the
Chinese Government, its results have been over-
clouded by the civil disorders which have
taken place in China. That is no peculiarity
of China. Where civil disorders occur in any
country, progress comes to an end, and indeed
a civil Government has great difficulty in acting
at all. My friend who represents the Irish
Free State will agree with me that, so long as
disorders were rampant in Ireland, it was very
difficult to carry on the duties of civil Govern-
ment and very great disasters took place.
It is a matter of common knowledge that
such happenings result wherever civil disturb-
ances exist. It is therefore not a matter for
surprise, nor can there be any criticism of
the Government of China, if, as a result of these
civil disorders, there has been a recrudescence
of poppy cultivation. I hope and believe that
the present situation is merely a temporary
phase in the history of an ancient Empire
and that, in the course of a very short time
the shorter the better the Central Government
will be fully re-established throughout the
country. I can say with the utmost convic-
tion that I feel sure that one of the first acts
of that Central Government, when and so
far as its authority is restored, will be to resume
the old opium policy of the Chinese Government
and to suppress the growth of the poppy as
rapidly as possible. It is therefore with great
confidence that I look forward to future
developments in China in this respect.
We have, however, to deal with the present
situation. I am not in a position ?no one
is in a position to know exactly what is
the production of opium in China at this
moment, but it is certainly very considerable.
I have seen it estimated I do not know with
what accuracy at about 15,000 tons, as
compared with a total production in India,
for instance, of something like 800 or 900 tons.
While that rate of production - unhappily, the
growth and product of civil dissension goes
on, the British Government feels very strongly
that any proposals such as those which the
American delegation is anxious to submit to
this Conference are impracticable. It feels
very strongly that, as long as such large quan-
tities of opium are being produced, to forbid
opium-smoking in the British Far East Domi-
nions either immediately or in a period of
years would merely result in putting so much
extra profit into the pockets of those who
are at present smuggling opium into those
territories.
The British Government is quite ready to take
any step that will help to stop opium-smoking,
but it is not ready to take a step which will
not put an end to opium-smoking but will
increase the profits of what is, after all, one
of the most worthless sections of the human
race. Such is the view of the British Govern-
ment, and I am bound to tell the Conference
experts that it has consulted.
Perhaps I may be allowed to remind the
Conference that in England it is a tradition,
and 1 believe a very wholesome tradition, to
give full weight, as regards questions relating
to the administration of the distant Possessions
of the British Empire, to the advice of the
man who is called ?the man on the spot.?
This is a maxim which has passed into the
common language of the British people
?Trust the man on the spot? and it merely
embodies a very fundamental principle of
British Colonial Administration.
The colonies are administered according to
the ideas of those who live there and, as far
as possible, for their benefit. One of the prin-
ciples, therefore, on which the British Empire
is very largely based is that we are bound to
give, and rightly do give, the fullest possible
weight to the advice that we receive from the
men who are fully conversant with the local
conditions and are in a position to give us
highly skilled and entirely impartial advice.
Let me remind the Conference that the advice
of such men is absolutely unbiassed. It does
not matter at all to them personally, or
from the pecuniary point of view, whether the
opium traffic continues or not. They are paid
by the British Treasury and their salaries will
continue just the same whatever happens to
the opium traffic. Their advice, 1 repeat,
is absolutely unbiassed, and I should not be
discharging my duty as a representative of the
British Government if I did not take this
opportunity of paying the very warmest pos-
sible tribute to the British Civil Service and
to the British Colonial Service. I myself
have the highest admiration for the members
of those services. I believe that there is no
body of men in the world I do not care what
nation you take who more nobly and more
disinterestedly discharge their difficult duties
and with such great skill, great justice and great
impartiality. There is no body of men who
do better service than the colonial adminis-
trators, and indeed the whole Civil Service of
my country, and I admit that I hear, with
something like impatience, criticisms suggesting
that these men are biassed by some utterly,
unmentionably corrupt motives in giving their
advice advice which, I am quite certain,
is dictated solely by what men of great skill,
great experience, and absolute disinterestedness
think is the best for the populations under their
control.
Such is the advice which the British Govern-
ment has received, and on which it feels bound
to act. That does not mean that we are going
to do nothing. Not at all ! We are prepared
to do a great deal. In the first place, we at
home are perpetually urging that everything
that can be done should be done, and the autho-
rities in the various Possessions are always
advising such means as appear to them to be
possible, such as the holding of enquiries and
the appointment of committees ; they leave
no stone unturned to ascertain what further
can be done for the suppression of this evil.
Even here at Geneva it is the fashion, I
understand, to deride and condemn what hsa
been accomplished by the First Conference.
Ido not take that view at all. I quite admit
that the achievements of the First Conference
are not spectacular, but it is not always the most


spectacular reforms that are the most useful,
and I believe that the reforms recommended
by the First Conference will do a great deal to
advance the cause which we all have at heart.
1 have drawn up a short summary of what that
First Conference has accomplished.
The farming system, under which the right
to deal in opium was granted to the highest
bidder, who then made as much profit as he
could out of the trade, is to be eliminated, and
the whole business of importing, selling and
distributing opium is to be placed in the hands
of the Governments, with certain exceptions
in regard to jretail sale. It is represented that
this provision is a reactionary step, the pur-
pose of which is to secure revenues for the
Governments, and one which will have the
effect of creating a ?bloc? of Governments
financially interested in the opium trade.
As a matter of fact, the object is to eschew
the private trader and to secure what is called
in connection with another, though very
closely allied, social reform, disinterested
management.
It is also proposed to eliminate as far as
possible the private retailer, who has a financial
interest in pushing the sales of opium. The
export of opium from the territories concerned
is to be prohibited entirely. This, as well as
the two preceding measures, should be very
useful in checking the illicit traffic that is
going on in the Far East.
The Governments concerned also undertake
in every possible way to discourage the use
of prepared opium and to assist one another
in their efforts to suppress the illicit traffic.
Great Britain also urged that the other Powers
should follow its example in making punishable
illegitimate transactions which are carried on
in another country by a person residing within
their territory. This is an extremely valuable
provision for dealing with the gangs of illicit
traffickers who carry on their operations all
over the world.
There seems to have been some difficulty
on this point, but everyone undertook to
examine in the most favourable spirit the pos-
sibility of taking such measures.
Lastly, it was agreed to review jointly from
time to time the position in regard to the
application of Chapter II of the Hague Conven-
tion, and the first meeting was fixed to take
place at latest in 1929, less than five years
hence.
Although it is quite true that some of these
provisions have already been enforced in the
British Possessions and in other Possessions,
their general enforcement will do a great deal
to diminish the use of opium for smoking, and I
think that it would be a mistake to suppose that
the work done by the First Conference does
not constitute an extremely valuable step
towards the suppression of the opium traffic.
Now what else can be done ? The British
Government has been considering that ques-
tion very carefully, and I was myself very
much impressed by a document issued by a
very distinguished member of this Conference,
Bishop Brent, who, to our deep regret, has been
called away by private affairs and is no longer
able to take part in our discussions.
I find in that document a passage which,
though it is a little long, I shall venture to
read to the Conference, because it seems to
me to include at least one suggestion which
is of great value. He is criticising very strongly
the results of the First Conference, and he
says :
?The Agreement has nothing in it touch-
ing the last part of Resolution V of the
Assembly which called for ?An agreement...
as to the measures which should be taken
by the Government of the Republic of
China to bring about the suppression of the
illegal production and use of opium in
China? .?
Then he says
?That China is blameless in the matter
is a claim which the Chinese themselves
would not advance. The members of the
Chinese delegation who sat in the First
Conference and also sit in the Second
represent a Central Government whose
laws respecting the use of prepared opium
are so uncompromising as to be unequalled
for their severity by those of any other
Government. That they are not carried
into effect is due for the most part to a
condition of affairs over which the Central
Government has no present control. The
Chinese delegation deplores the fact and
have asked that its assurances of good
faith and fixed determination to be
loyal to their principles and purposes be
accepted.?
That has already been said, of course, and
the British Government accepts it fully.
Bishop Brent continues :
?Its Government is pledged to practical
action to the summit of its executive and
administrative ability. Some article em-
bracing the foregoing would have been
desirable, and at any rate no more vague
than some at least of the articles of the
Agreement as it stands. Though the
Chinese, like every other nation, are jealous
of their sovereignty and suspect anything
which might threaten to impinge upon it,
I cannot but feel that some reasonable
offer of a co-operative character from
neighbouring countries which are, in greater
or lesser degree, dependent upon Chinese
resident in them for labour, would have
been an encouragement and a part solution
of the problem.?
Then I call special attention to the passage
which follows :
?For instance, that they would move pari
passu with China in the matter of suppres-
sion, whether by immediate prohibition
or graduated stages, from the moment the
Chinese Government was in a position to
take effective action ; that they would
refuse admission into their territories of
Chinese addicts ; that they would look
on addiction as disease and treat addicts
accordingly ; that they would adopt the
system of licensing and rationing, inviting
China to do the same ; that the most
vigorous and wise propaganda against
the use of prepared opium be organised
by all countries concerned, beginning with
children and extending to every section
of society ; that they would use as much
of their opium revenue as was necessary
for carrying out effectively the foregoing


measures. China might not have liked
some of these proposals. Never mind ;
for the balance of the eight countries it
would have placed the shoe on the other
foot. Granting, as I freely do, the enor-
mous handicap which conditions in China
impose on nations holding Oriental posses-
ions where the Chinese are a large and
indispensable factor, we must not allow
ourselves to forget that we Western nations
have had some share in making China
what she is. We cannot therefore sit
passive.?
That is a very interesting and important decla-
ration. Ido not know whether all the proposals
of Bishop Brent are practicable I am rather
afraid that they are not but with the general
spirit and object which they display I find
myself in a very large degree in sympathy, and
I am prepared on behalf of the British Govern-
ment to make this declaration of policy :
(i) His Majesty?s Government under-
takes that opium-smoking shall be abo-
lished in the British Far Eastern terri-
tories in which such smoking is temporarily
authorised, within a period of not more than
fifteen years from the date on which the
effective execution of the measures taken
by. China to suppress the growth of the
opium poppy has reached such a stage as
to remove the danger of opium smuggling
from China into those territories.
(2) As soon as it is established in the
manner indicated in the following para-
graph that the effective execution of the
said measures has reached the stage re-
ferred to above, the necessary measures will
be initiated to enable the complete prohi-
bition of smoking to be effective at the
end of the said period.
(3) The question when the effective
execution of the measures mentioned
in paragraph (1) has reached the stage
referred to in that paragraph shall be
decided by a Commission to be appointed
by the Council of the League of Nations,
whose decision shall be final.
Then comes an explanatory paragraph
(4) It is understood (a) that, as soon
as the period of fifteen years referred to in
paragraph (1) has begun to run, opium-
smoking by persons who are not smokers
at that date shall forthwith be prohibited :
( b) that the complete prohibition of opium-
smoking to be effective by the end of the
said period of fifteen years is not inconsistent
with special and temporary provisions for
persons in whose case it is certified by the
medical authorities of the State concerned
that they cannot be completely deprived
of the drug without serious danger to life
or health.
That last provision, I am told, is absolutely
essential, because without it there would be
great danger of these unhappy people dying.
I am very reluctant to introduce into this
discussion the name of anyone who is not
actually present, but since, outside this room,
and to some extent inside this room, the name
of Sir John Jordan has been freely used to the
effect that he is divergent from British policy,
I think it right to say that this document was
shown to Sir John Jordan before I left London,
and he says : ?After careful perusal I find
that these proposals represent the views I
hold on the subject. They appear to me to
constitute a practical and satisfactory solution
of the question.?
Such is the proposal which the British Govern-
ment, after consulting all its advisers, ventures
to make. It is quite true that it will not be
satisfactory to those who are very anxious
on this subject, and I respect their convictions
and sympathise with them. After all, the
British Government is in a position of great
responsibility in this matter. It has to do
what it thinks is right, not only what is pleasing
to those it respects, but what it believes will
be effective for the purposes in hand and what
it believes can be carried out without gravely
disturbing the territories over which it rules.
This is the view of the British Government,
though it does not claim infallibility in this
matter. It quite recognises that it and all
its experts may be mistaken. It may be that
what appears to be the opinion of Bishop Brent
and Sir John Jordan is as wrong as that held
by the rest of the experts.
It recognises that, and is prepared therefore
to hold by the offer, which I understand was
made before the Christmas vacation, that, if
it is so desired, it will recommend and urge upon
the Council of the League of Nations the nomi-
nation of a small impartial Commission. As far as
the British Government is concerned, it may be
presided over by an American Chairman, and
the Commission may go to the territories in
question, investigate them and see whether
the proposals and offers which the British
Government has made or is prepared to make
can be improved upon. If that Commission
reports to the Council, and the latter adopts
its report, to the effect that something more
ought to be done, then undoubtedly a different
situation would arise and the British Govern-
ment would be disposed to carry out whatever
is recommended.
I have detained the Conference at some little
length on this subject because it is of very
great controversial importance ; but. before
I sit down I want to remind you that this
question, important as it is, is not the main
question that we have to consider ; it is not
the really vital thing which affects not only
the Western peoples but the Eastern peoples ;
it is not the vice which threatens to undermine
the manhood of those who indulge in it. Drug-
addiction is the great question with which we
have to deal. Whatever the view you take of the
mandate of the Conference, drug-addiction
is its primary, but not its exclusive, business.
I must impress upon you very strongly that
we should not be diverted from dealing with
that question, on which the Hague Convention
contains very important provisions.
We have done a great deal, and I am bound
to say with great success, in suppressing the
evil in our own land and among our own people
by the application of various measures and by
practical education. We are very anxious
to get on with this business, but we are most
particularly anxious that this Conference should
not come to an end without having done some-
thing to help on this very essential work
for the good of humanity.
We feel that the proposals which have been


submitted to the Conference are of the greatest
possible value and ought to be most carefully
considered. They seem to the British Govern-
ment to promise a very great advance.
Let me remind the Conference what they are.
i. Sub-Committee A has been working
out a scheme for the limitation of the manufac-
ture of and trade in narcotic drugs. The original
schemes for limiting the world manufacture
of the drugs to a definite amount each year had
to be given up and a compromise scheme (which
was based on a limitation of imports) proposed
by the Advisory Committee last August was
then put forward ; ultimately a scheme on
the following lines was suggested and is being-
considered.
An independent Central Board will be estab-
lished to keep a watch on the international
traffic. It will receive from each country every
two months particulars of its exports and imports
of each of the drugs to and from every country.
Each country will also furnish the Board at the
beginning of the year with an estimate of its
probable requirements during the year, the
estimate to serve as a guide to the Board in its
supervision over the traffic, but not to be regar-
ded as binding on the country furnishing it.
Every country will also furnish the Board at
the end of the year with full statistics of pro-
duction, manufacture, etc. If the Board finds
that the drugs are going in excessive quantities
to a particular country, it will have the right
to ask for an explanation ; in the event of no
explanation being furnished, or no satisfactory
explanation, it will then be able to make a recom-
mendation to the other Governments and to the
Council of the League that no further exports
should be made to that country until the situa-
tion was satisfactorily cleared up. If a country
did not wish to act on this recommendation,
it would be bound to inform the Council of
the League, giving, if possible, its reasons.
It is thought that a scheme of this kind would
constitute a very valuable check on excessive
exports to any particular part of the world,
and a comparison of the imports and exports
with the figures of annual production and
manufacture, which will be furnished at the
end of the year, would show if the drugs were
being manufactured by any country in exces-
sive quantities.
2. The proposals made by the Advisory
Committee last August for the impiovement
of the machinery of control over the interna-
tional trade [i.e., export and import) have been
accepted by Sub-Committee E, to which they
were referred. These include the export and
import certificate system, the requirement of
a separate export or import licence for each
consignment, control over the drugs in transit,
including transhipment (and prevention of
unauthorised diversion), and in bonded ware-
houses, and control over free ports.
3. There are proposals for extending Chapter
I of the Hague Convention to include the coca
leaf as well as raw opium, for strengthening the
definitions of the narcotic drugs, providing
machinery for extending the Convention to
new narcotic drugs not at present covered, and
some other proposals of a minor character.
There is also a proposal under consideration for
extending the Convention to hashish.
4. Restriction of the production of raw
opium and the coca leaf. At present we have
not been able to deal with that question.
We consider that these proposals are of
great value, and I may say here and now, on
behalf of the British Government, that we are
prepared to co-operate with any delegation to
strengthen those provisions and to make them
more effective for the object which they have
in view, provided, of course, that the proposals
are of a reasonable and practical character.
As regards eating opium, there may be diffe-
rences of opinion. We regret as much as anyone
that the progress of the suppression of opium-
smoking has been slow. It will be simply
disastrous if we do nothing effective to deal
with the drug traffic. I have learnt with great
pain, not from what has gone on in the Confe-
rence but from what has transpired outside,
that there is a measure of distrust of this nation
and of that nation, and, for all I know, parti-
cularly of my own in this matter. I earnestly
protest against that attitude, which does not
make for progress, and which is not of any use
whatever. If we want to get on with this work,
we must abandon recrimination and adopt the
policy of co-operation. Co-operation and not
recrimination is the instrument of progress.
I venture very respectively to suggest tl at
we should by all means lay aside the controver-
sial method and spirit which appear to have
grown up, and devote ourselves to the really
important task which lies before us. The most
important part of that task is to deal with the
traffic and manufacture of these dangerous
drugs by which so much misery to humanity
has been caused and is being caused at the
present time. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. Loudon, delegate of the
Netherlands, will address the Conference.
M. Loudon (Netherlands)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, after the detailed statement which
the first delegate of the British Empire has
just made, I do not intend to speak on the opium
problem as a whole. So far as my country is
concerned, the reasons for which our delegation
last December thought it its duty to oppose
the resumption by the Second Conference of
the discussion of the question of prepared
opium, a question which had been dealt with
by the First Conference, have been fully ex-
plained to you.
If I, nevertheless, once more refer to this
point, it is only to tell you that the Government
of the Netherlands, after a very careful exami-
nation of the question of competence which
was raised in the Second Conference, altogether
upholds the views expressed by its delegation.
In order to avoid any misunderstanding and
to clear up a question which is constantly
becoming confused as a result of erroneous inter-
pretations, I think that I should give you a
very brief explanation of the policy pursued
in the Dutch East Indies so far as opium is
concerned. This statement will, I hope, go
some way towards convincing the world that
our attitude towards the American proposals
will in no way interfere with the realisation
in practice of the ideal that we have at heart,
i and will show you that the adoption of these
I proposals would in no way further our aims,


but would on the contrary lead to fresh diffi
culties.
The systems which have been suggested with
a view to combating the abuse in question are
all inspired by the same ideal, that is to say,
that of raising the moral and social level of
the populations. The only difference lies in
the methods by which it is sought to realise
this ideal.
In view of the results obtained by a close
study of the problem and by many years?
experience, my Government cannot abandon
its policy in order to adopt another the success
of which is not, under present conditions,
guaranteed in any way. The example of the
Philippine Islands does not convince us. The
figures which have been published with regard
to the consumption of opium in these Islands,
where the position, after all, is an exceptionally
favourable one, as a result of the immigration
policy figures which do not go further than
the year 1921 in no way prove that the policy
of prohibition has produced the satisfactory
results that were expected from it. I should
be very glad if the American delegation would
give us the figures for the years 1922 and
1923.
Immediate prohibition and the American
scheme of diminishing the annual importation of
raw opium by 10 per cent, with absolute prohi-
bition after the tenth year, are arbitrary and
artificial measures. It is more than doubtful
whether it would be possible to maintain them,
and, once it is not certain whether it will be
possible to maintain such measures, we consider
it far preferable to leave them alone ; they would
reduce legitimate traffic to the sole benefit
of the illicit traffic, the volume of which is
thereby increased. When once hasty mea-
sures have led to a well-organised smuggling
trade, it becomes almost impossible to suppress
this trade. The smuggler who desires to increase
his profits daily will lose no chance of extending
his sphere of action.
The Dutch Government is convinced that
the above-mentioned restrictive measures are
only effective when they are based on a syste-
matic moral education and on an improvement
of social and hygienic conditions. In the Dutch
Indies we have devoted all our attention to these
aspects of the problem. We have further
checked the spread of the evil by the institution,
wherever it appeared possible, of prohibition
centres. It has been noted that in native
villages the consumption of opium is very
limited (33 centigrammes per year per head.)
In the large ports, the maintenance of re-
strictive measures is much more difficult. This
is partly due to the existence of very large
foreign colonies, mainly Chinese, but in these
centres also nothing has been left undone so
far as restriction of consumption is concerned.
I must admit that, in these localities, measures
have been taken which appear to be even too
drastic. It is true that the restrictive measures
applied in the Indies have resulted in a consi-
derable decrease in the legitimate traffic. The
traffic during the year 1923 decreased by about
50 per cent as compared with the figures foi
1920, and the figures for 1924 are still lower.
On the other hand, various symptoms show
that, during the same period, illicit traffic
increased. As soon as such an increase becomes
marked, it is desirable to moderate the regime
applied, or at least not to apply it more drasti-
cally, so as to avoid driving consumers into the
arms of the smugglers. In a large part of our
possessions, we apply the system of licences
and rationing of smokers. It is probable that
these very restrictions, which are somewhat too
drastic, and also the excessive increase in
prices with a view to making purchase difficult,
have been responsible for the increased acti-
vities of the smugglers.
These facts prove even to laymen with what
caution restrictive measures should be applied,
the more so since it is to be feared that these
smugglers might carry on a propaganda in favour
of even more noxious drugs, such as morphine,
cocaine, heroin, etc. Smuggling, once it has been
organised, nullifies the effect of restrictive
measures previously decreed, destroys respect
for the law, and inevitably leads to corruption
among Customs and police authorities.
We must, therefore, particularly in large
centres where prohibition measures could not
be permanently maintained, take account of
a real present need for opium which it is the
duty of the Government to meet, though
subject to a very strict control. The consump-
tion of opium is very strictly controlled. The
re-export of raw opium or the export of pre-
pared opium are absolutely forbidden. Opium
is not cultivated in the Dutch Indies. Illicit
re-export is virtually non-existent and the
supply of raw opium, to be turned into prepared
opium, is obtained solely by purchase from
another Government. Therefore, opium does
not enter into international traffic and the
problem is hence of a purely internal character.
Propaganda against the use of opium is
supported by all means in our power, and carried
out by instruction in schools, by the distribu-
tion of pamphlets and by the exclusion of
opium-smokers from all Government services,
including the army and the navy.
As regards a system such as that of the gra-
dual limitation of imports which is proposed
by America, it would be absolutely necessary
first to set up a system of licences and of ration-
ing. Otherwise, it would be impossible to pro-
vide for a reduction which would affect all
consumers equally. A licensing system in
its turn presupposes an absolute Government
monopoly. I beg to draw your attention to
the fact that these are the very two measures
which are to be found as the guiding principles
in the Agreement arrived at by the First
Conference that Agreement which, as Viscount
Cecil observed with truth, has been too severely
criticised. It is true that it has not been possible
to ensure the immediate application of these
principles, in view of the excessive growth of
smuggling as a result of conditions in the
countries producing raw opium.
Provisions were therefore inserted in this
Agreement which are absolutely indispensable
to pave the way for measures such as the United
States advocate. I would draw the special
attention of the Conference to this fact, which
proves that, when this Convention was drawn
up, a real step forward was made, all the more
so since it is understood that the object of
Article 12 is to complete this Agreement by
fresh restrictive measures as soon as the smug-
gling trade shall have sufficiently decreased.
From an international point of view, this
draft Convention contains the maximum that
can be achieved under present circumstances,
which does not mean a maximum from the


domestic point of view of each of the Contract-
ing Parties. For instance, so far as the
Dutch Indies are concerned, I can give you an
assurance that, not only shall we strictly observe
the obligations provided for by this regional
agreement, but we shall go yet further in our
campaign against this scourge in our own
territories by means of an increasingly strict
control.
A memorandum regarding the policy of the
Dutch East Indies in respect of opium, which
contains all information on the action taken
by my Government in this matter, is at the
disposal of the members of the Conference.
I request the Secretariat to be so good as to
distribute this document. In it you will find
what a Government, having long experience,
having continuously studied this question and
having been guided, not by the lure of financial
gain but by high moral principles, and most
important of all by commonsense, has accom-
plished in its attempt gradually to stamp out
the opium evil.
In conclusion, I should like to draw your
attention to the fact that, in order to achieve
more speedily the object which was aimed at
in Article XII of the Agreement drawn up
by the First Conference, we consider it abso-
lutely indispensable that smuggling should be
reduced to a minimum by measures designed
forthwith to limit the cultivation of raw opium
in the producing countries so that there shall
be no further surplus of the raw material avail-
able for export over and above the quantity
necessary for consumption as authorised by the
iql 2 Convention in Chapters II and 111.
Once this limitation has been achieved and
the producing countries have thus shown that
they are in a position effectively to control
production in their territory, the Conference
referred to in Article XlTwill, we are sure, have
no difficulty in coming to an agreement with
regard to the limitation of imports of raw
opium intended for the manufacture of pre-
pared opium into the territories of the Powers
represented.
Finally, I would say that, in my view, this
is the only way in which the consumption of
prepared opium can be abolished within a
short period. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. Daladier, delegate of
France, will address the Conference.
IVi = Oaladier (France)
Translation: In the name of the Government of
the Republic, it is my duty to state that France
is firmly resolved to carry on the campaign
against drugs, that is to say, I wholly associate
myself with the lofty sentiments which have
just been enunciated by Viscount Cecil and
M. Loudon. I also desire to express my sympathy
with Mr. Porter and his friends of the United
States delegation who have been high-minded
enough to undertake a veritable apostolate
throughout the world, a real crusade against
the abuse of narcotics.
It is also [my duty, in reply to a ques-
tion that Viscount Cecil did me the honour
of asking, to state that the French Govern-
ment is indeed wholly in agreement with
the views of the British Government and of
the Dutch Government so far as the
question of competence is concerned ; we are
all the more glad to state this since, whatever
may be said, this Conference has arrived at
proposals which have ' been inspired by really
practical ideas, proposals which, I sincerely
trust, will produce most valuable results when
they are put into practice throughout the world.
I should also like to take up the thread of
Viscount Cecil?s argument and, more or less
following the plan that he laid before us,
acknowledge that narcotics may be divided
into four classes. First, those which are useful
for the treatment of the sick. Secondly,
those which are absorbed in the form of opium
and which come under the heading of opium-
eating, with regard to which arguments have
occasionally arisen, some people regarding
it as very harmful, others as the least harmful
of drug habits, but of which, I think, we may
say that it cannot be recommended to anyone.
Thirdly, there is opium for smoking, which
is undoubtedly dangerous, especially when it
is smoked by white men, and in any case when
consumers, without distinction of race, con-
tract a habit which becomes inveterate and as
a result of which they are led to absorb a larger
dose every day.
Lastly, and I personally should desire that
the Conference be unanimous on this point,
the fourth category includes alkaloids, that
is to say, morphine, cocaine, heroin, etc.,
which, whatever may have been said on
certain occasions, are really by far the
most dangerous of all narcotic drugs. I
hope that this point will not be lost sight of
and that, instead of spending a possibly dispro-
portionate amount of time on theoretical dis-
cussions, we shall unanimously agree that
the most imperative duty of this. Conference is
to contrive to prohibit altogether and as soon
as possible I would wish that it could be
done to-day the use of these alkaloids which
constitute a real scourge, which are both a
dishonour and a source of sorrow to humanity.
If you accept this point of view, I may say
that our chief object here is to use all means
in our power to limit the consumption of narco-
tics and particularly of alkaloids to purely
medical purposes, and to see to it that the
consumption of such drugs, apart from medical
purposes, be totally and effectively prohibited.
France, as I have already had the honour
to state, is firmly resolved to support all effec-
tive and practical measures which may be
taken with this object in view. I may, perhaps,
be allowed to point out that France, in her
own territory, produces merely a few hundred
kilogrammes of cocaine, that is to say, merely
the quantity which is absolutely necessary
for medical purposes, and that she does not
produce and never has produced a single
gramme of drugs for other countries. I may
perhaps also point out that France has adopted
a domestic legislation which all countries agree
in recognising as very severe, and if there are
countries where the drug evil is rampant, France
is entitled to say that she is in no way respons-
ible for it.
When I say this, when I refer to the domestic
legislation of France, it means that I wholly
agree with those members, whoever they may
be in this assembly, who might hold that this
legislation's inadequate ; that I readily agree
to any measures which may result in strengthen-
ing such legislation and making it yet more
rigid and drastic. But if we really desire to


face the problem, to take a decision based on
exact knowledge, should we not say that in
reality the restriction of the use of narcotics,
under whatever form, the restriction or the
total abolition of the illicit consumption of
all narcotics without distinction, is only really
practical and possible in so far as production
and manufacture have been suppressed or
totally abolished ? On this point, I should like
to state that 1 personally consider, and that
France considers, that if we limit our efforts to
a reduction in the consumption of narcotics,
we shall be labouring at a task which, in practice,
is likely to be both vain and illusory.
On this point, speaking candidly of those
aspects of the problem which interest France,
I should like to prove the statement I have just
made by submitting the Indo-China problem
clearly and frankly to the Conference. This
problem of the consumption of opium in Indo-
China was not touched upon by my honour-
able predecessors, doubtless from a feeling
of discretion to which I should like to pay a
tribute; but the best tribute I can pay is to
endeavour to lay the truth openly before you,
as is fitting when one has the honour of addres-
sing an assembly such as this. When laying
this problem before you, I would beg you in all
good faith to consider the geographical posi-
tion of that country, which only produces a
small quantity of opium, in mountainous dis-
tricts, moreover, on frontiers which are inha-
bited by half-savage tribes.
Opium is consumed throughout the whole
of the country, whereas only very small quan-
tities are produced ; the amount necessary for
consumption must therefore come from foreign
countries. From the geographical point of
view, that territory is entirely surrounded by
countries some of which are producers on a very
large scale and others which are large consumers
of opium. Whenever an attempt has been made
in those neighbouring countries to reduce the
production of opium, a parallel attempt has
been made to reduce the consumption in that
territory. It is my duty to state this, and thus
in my turn to pay a tribute to the French
Governors of Indo-China. But the figures are
even more eloquent than words. In 1906, the
Chinese Government issued a decree for-
bidding the cultivation of the poppy and, after
an admirable effort made by the Chinese people
to which we must pay this tribute, the
production of China, which previously exceeded
30.000 tons of opium per year, fell in 1917 to a
few kilogrammes. This is an admirable effort
and a highly successful one.
What action was then taken by the French
Government ? What did the Government of
Indo-China do ? It immediately took steps
to respond to the effort made by China, and
Indo-China, which had previously consumed
more than 125,000 and even more than 130,000
kilogrammes, found its production at the end
of the period not even reaching a figure of
70.000 kilogrammes.
We are determined to increase our efforts,
but I believe and it is a question of good
faith that what we are determined to do
with a view to first reducing and then abolishing
the consumption of opium can only have satis-
factory results if production also is really
controlled, supervised, limited and held in
check.
How shall we be able to guard the three thou-
sand kilometres of land frontier between Indo-
China and countries which are opium producers
or consumers on a large scale ? Where could
we get an army of Customs officials and gen-
darmes to hunt down the innumerable armed
smugglers who will cross the frontier should
we in Indo-China make an effort to reduce or
suppress consumption, thus putting a high
premium on the smuggling of opium ?
This is the question which I ask the Confe-
rence to consider in a judicial spirit. If we
agree on this point, we must contrive to apply
the two sets of measures side by side on the
one hand, restriction of production and manu-
facture and, on the other, a simultaneous re-
striction of consumption. These are proposals
which are both concrete, practical and honest.
I now propose to conclude in my turn with
a brief written statement :
?In the name of the French delegation,
and as a member of the French Govern-
ment, I desire to declare that my count y
is firmly resolved energetically to combat
the use of drugs of any kind. I think it
my duty to remind you that it was with
the support of France that, in 1923, the
League of Nations decided to convene
here two Conferences, one of representa-
tives of States which produce and consume
opium, and the other of representatives
of all countries which may be interested
in the measures calculated to stamp out
the drug evil throughout the world.
?France immediately decided to take
an active part in the work of these two
Conferences. In the First Conference, the
resolutions adopted provide for measures
of two kinds ; first, measures which show,
on the part of the Contracting States, a
very real desire gradually to restrict, and
as soon as possible altogether to abolish,
the consumption of opium in their terri-
tories ; the second, one of a worldwide
nature, designed by a very strict regulation
of trade to prevent any export of the drug,
or any diversion of supplies into other
channels, which might prove a danger to
other countries. In both cases, the French
Government has given its full consent to
the provisions adopted.
?It is in the same spirit that France is
participating in the work of this Conference.
We associate ourselves beforehand with
all the resolutions which may be taken in
order to control production, manufacture
and distribution of all drugs in the raw
state or prepared, the use of which is dan-
gerous to the human race. France has
already, on her own initiative, issued at
home and in the territories under her
authority a legislation which goes as far
as possible in this direction. Our regu-
lations are so strict that all dangerous
substances up to the last gramme are
kept in sight, without there being any
practical possibility of evasion from the
moment at which they cross our frontier
until they are delivered to the consumer.
Should it still appear of advantage to
issue yet stricter regulations giving further
guarantees, France, I repeat, is already
prepared to do so. Our Government does
not intend to raise any objection to yet
stricter measures, whether it be a case of


imports, exports or consumption, in so far
as they apply to our Continental territory
or to the whole of our possessions outside
Europe.
?So far as Indo-China is more particu-
larly concerned, although the draft Con-
vention prepared by the First Conference
already meets our point of view, it may
be of some use if I add that the French
Government is firmly resolved to arrive,
in the shortest possible time, at the com-
plete abolition of all consumption of opium.
In view, however, of the geographical posi-
tion of French Indo-China, it is impossible
for us to state exactly within what period
of time this happy result will be altogether
achieved.
?Indo-China is surrounded by countries
which produce far more than they them-
selves require of opium, which is easy to
sell at a low price. It is therefore abso-
lutely essential that the gradual reduction
and eventual abolition of the consumption
of opium in Indo-China should be accom-
panied by the gradual restriction and event-
ual abolition of the production of the drug in
the neighbouring countries. The question
of opium-addiction in Indo-China is neces-
sarily, to put it somewhat differently, less
a question of domestic consumption than
a question of foreign production. I have
no doubt that all will agree in recognising
the consequences of such a state of things
and in admitting that the French Govern-
ment, whatever be its good intentions, is
obliged to take these practical difficulties
into account. France reserves the right,
if necessary, to move a concrete proposal
based on these ideas and providing for
effective and practical measures to put them
into force.? [Applause.)
The President
Translation : No other members have asked
to speak. I think the reason for this is probably
that the delegations desire to think over the
very interesting statements which have just
been made by various delegates. I therefore
think I shall meet the wishes of the Conference
by closing the meeting.
The next meeting will take place to-morrow
morning at 10.30 a.m.

THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE UNITED

SUBMITTED BY THE DELEGATION OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA :
CONTINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
The President

The only item on the agenda of this meeting
is the continuation of the discussion on the
motion submitted by the United States dele-
gation.
M. Sugimura, delegate of Japan, will address
the Conference.
M. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, on behalf of the Japanese delegation,
I wish to state my views solely on the American
proposal at present under discussion.
I have listened with the greatest interest to
the important statements made by the honour-
able delegates of the British Empire, France,
and the Netherlands, but in the interests of
clearness, simplicity, and precision, I think it
preferable to refrain from dealing immediately
with their points of view, to which I shall have
much pleasure in reverting on another occasion.
We shall thus obviate all possibility of confusion
in the discussion. Flaving said this, I shall
proceed with my statement.
I wish to state first of all that I am in favour
of the American scheme concerning the total
abolition, within ten years, of the use of opium
for smoking.
The lessons gained by the experience in Japan,
however, force me to adopt a passive rather than
an active attitude. I have the greatest sym-
pathy and respect for the American scheme,
but I am unable to go so far myself as to support
it with a feeling of conviction and responsibility.
Moreover, certain points, both fundamental
and points of form, must be further defined. In
my opinion, the drafting of Article 8 of the
American suggestions does not satisfactorily re-
flect the real intentions of its author. When
this has been done, I shall be ready to accept
the American suggestion, which is radical
in its application but reasonable from the point
of view of the intimate correlation of all the
measures which have been proposed for carry-
ing out our task.
The method proposed by the American dele-
gation has already been applied in various
countries with or without success, or again
with some appearance of success, but wit-


hout really satisfactory results, at any is by no means the same thing as the proposed
rate, as far as the neighbouring countries are
concerned.
The Japanese Government itself has employed
a similar method in Kwantung, but I must
admit that the results did not justify our hopes.
Twenty-four years? experience in Formosa
has shown us that our system is, in practice,
excellent.
As regards ordinary smokers, the method is
to enforce absolute and complete prohibition
from the beginning. In the case of inveterate
smokers, however, we do not lay down any
definite limit for complete abolition. We grant
the licence with a daily ration which places these
smokers under the very strict control of the
police authorities. In so doing we do not carry
out gradual suppression as it is ordinarily
understood, that is to say, by equal stages,
but we obtain, nevertheless, the same excellent
result.
Twenty-four years of persevering effort have
brought about a decrease of over 80 per cent
in the number of inveterate smokers. At the
present time, this number represents only
slightly more than i per cent of the total popu-
lation.
Our confidence, therefore, in the system we
have established in Foimosa is based on con-
clusive experiments and undeniable facts. That
is why it is not at all easy for us, when our system
is on the point of attaining the result which
we all desire, to change our methods and apply
another system which, as far as we are concer-
ned, has not given good results.
Consequently, our attitude towards the Ame-
rican scheme is bound to be passive. We can
neither actively defend this radical system nor
urge other States to accept it. We possess
absolutely no data to enable us to say that it
is really superior or, in practice, effective. I
would venture to add that it will cause us much
sorrow if we have to sacrifice the fruit of our
own efforts for twenty-four years, efforts of
which the Japanese nation is justly proud and
which furnish a striking proof of our success.
As we are all responsible before the world for
the effective character of our resolutions, I
should be glad to learn in as much detail as
possible the methods and measures which the
American delegation proposes to apply in
order to obtain effective and absolute suppres-
sion within ten years. We should not be
satisfied with words ; we should insist upon
definite realities. Japan, when once she has
accepted an international engagement, is accus-
tomed to observe it with the utmost sincerity
and loyalty.
I shall deal now with the question of substance.
In obtaining abolition, it is not the act of
abolition itself which is difficult, but rather the
conservation of the result obtained and the
effective maintenance of the new situation so
happily brought about. Naturally, it is, above
all, necessary to prevent the habit from claiming
new victims, particularly among young people.
But how are we to treat inveterate smokers ?
That is the Gordian knot, the really vital point
of the problem.
If appropriate steps are not taken, inveterate
smokers who are slaves to their vice will go
abroad and will take refuge in a country in
which the administrative power does not possess
sufficient authority. There are already regret-
table examples of this change of habitat, which
abolition.
Moreover, if the number of inveterate smokers
is very high in a country, and the adminis-
trative authorities weak, contraband is sure
to flourish, since intoxication is for these unfor-
tunate people a question of life and death,
and they will seek by every means and at any
cost to satisfy their craving.
Several methods may be considered by which
the desired result may be obtained ;
[a) We may attempt to cure inveterate
smokers in special hospitals. This would be
an excellent method, although it would entail
considerable expenditure if the addicts were
very numerous.
Our own experience has shown that it is
quite possible in hospitals to cure inveterate
smokers, but as soon as they return to ordinary
life there is a great tendency among them to
return to their former bad habits.
{h) It is in order to prevent this undesirable
eventuality that, in Formosa, the Japanese
Government has established a system of licences
and strict daily rationing. This system has
made it possible to obtain a gradual diminution
of the daily consumption. In certain cases,
and under the influence of appropriate moral
education, there has not only been diminution,
but actually a complete disappearance of the
baneful habit of smoking opium.
These are the results produced by our sys-
tem, in which we feel absolute confidence and of
which we are justly proud. If, now, we are prepa-
red to modify these prudent, wise and effective
regulations in order to adopt a very radical
system, we naturally desire a number of further
details and guarantees. It is for this reason
that we ask for definite explanations and effec-
tive guarantees as to the method in which
we may, in ten years? time, obtain radical and
complete abolition.
I wish also to draw your attention to the
exact meaning of the words ?gradual and effec-
tive suppression??, the whole aim of which is
not only complete suppression, but also a sup-
pression carried out by fixed stages.
In Formosa, we have divided smokers into
two categories according to the seriousness of
their condition. In regard to ordinary smokers
who are able to abandon their wretched habit
without too much suffering, we applied a system
of complete and immediate prohibition twenty-
five years ago. There only remain, therefore,
the inveterate smokers, recognised as such after
a very careful examination by a Government
medical officer. In our opinion, these are
cases for treatment of a medical nature. These
unfortunate persons are dealt with as medical
patients. In their case we do not proceed to
suppress the drug by fixed stages, but we never-
theless obtain a good result.
It is true that nature often follows its course
and death supervenes ; but in other cases we
succeed in diminishing the daily ration. In
exceptional cases the patient is induced to
abandon the habit of opium-smoking.
In my opinion, where only inveterate smokers
are concerned, the number of which is known
as well as the amount they consume, the impor-
tance of fixing a strict limit for the attainment
of total abolition and the establishment of
definite stages is greatly diminished. We should
not forget that, in the case of ordinary smokers,


complete abolition has, by our policy, been
obtained from the very beginning. The case we
are now considering is that of a very small
proportion of the population, who may be
likened to sick persons, and whose requirements
grow less each year.
The underlying principle of the Hague Con-
vention is undoubtedly progressive and effec-
tive suppression, but when we in any way
advance beyond this principle, we must take
due account of the sincere and effective efforts
which have already been made.
In order to attain the object which the Ame-
rican proposals have in view, we require an
effective and practical system. Is the Ame-
rican delegation in favour of the system of
licences and rationing, that is to say, immediate
abolition in the case of ordinary smokers and
an annual 10 per cent reduction in the case of
habitual smokers, or does it, on the contrary,
contemplate a progressive reduction applied
indiscriminately to ordinary smokers and to
habitual addicts ? If we adopt the latter point
of view, we shall create unfortunate confusion
and shall even be taking a step backwards.
Such a system would hardly be in keeping with
our humanitarian aims.
Perhaps it is the intention of the American
delegation to leave all these details to the
sovereign decision of each Government, which
would be free to adopt such measures as
circumstances warrant. In my opinion, the
fate of the American scheme depends on the
solution adopted in this respect. Of course, I
would not venture to insist on my opinion as
opposed to that of others, but it is important
for us to obtain a definite explanation.
If our work is to attain universal success, it
must be based on clear and definite conceptions
in which all the Contracting Powers will find
the necessary reciprocal guarantees both in
law and in fact.
I pass now to the question of form.
Article 8 of the American suggestions provides
that : . . for a period of ten years beginning
with the date of ratification of this Convention
by it [i.e. each Contracting Party).
From this text it follows that :
i. The starting-point for the proposed 10
per cent reduction varies according to the
country unless the Contracting Parties agree
to ratify the Convention simultaneously.
2. The Convention does not apply to terri-
tories excluded by the Contracting Parties from
the ratification (see Agreement of the First
Opium Conference, Article XIII). This leaves
a loophole.
To sum up, under the formula proposed, it
hardly seems possible to bring about general
and simultaneous abolition. I venture there-
fore to direct your attention to this point.
Article 8 refers only to importation. It does
not include, and hence places no restriction on,
the manufacture of opium products prepared
from opium grown by any country within its
own territory, although it prohibits the supple-
menting of any reduction in imports by domes-
tically produced opium.
The word ?importation? does not apply to
traffic between the mother-country and its
colonies and dominions or to the commercial
relations which may exist between the latter.
As I understand the matter, it is the inten-
tion of the American delegation to abolish
opium-smoking completely at the end of ten
years. If this view is correct, some amend-
ment is required in the draft as it stands.
The American suggestions contain three
essential provisions :
{a) The confirmation of the principle
of absolute and complete abolition ;
{b) The fixing of a definite period foj
such abolition ;
(c) The fixing of a definite number of
years for such period.
As regards the first provision ( a ), no Power
which is a signatory to the Hague Convention
has the right to raise objections of any sort
whatsoever, as the provision in question merely
expresses the fundamental principle under-
lying that Convention. The necessary corollary
of the gradual and effective abolition advocated
at The Hague, is complete and absolute sup-
pression. It is not within the power, therefore,
of either the First or the Second Conference to
draw up any agreement at variance with this
principle.
The third provision (c) appears to me to be
of secondary importance. The period fixed
might be ten years or any other number of
years which seems suitable in the circumstances.
The second provision appears to me to be a
reasonable one, as the idea of complete aboli-
tion would be meaningless unless the question
of time were taken into account. It must not
be forgotten, however, that it constitutes an
innovation in the Hague Convention, in that it
fixes a definite uniform period (see Article 6
of the Hague Convention).
The suggestion that abolition shall be effected
within ten years, a suggestion which is entirely
new, constitutes, together with the project
for the limitation of production, manufacture
and importation, the vast American scheme
which is based on the principles underlying
the Hague Convention and is an effort to hasten
the realisation of that ideal. All these measures
form one indivisible whole. It is essential that
their interdependence should be maintained,
and that their development should progress
evenly. It is this interdependence, this soli-
darity which exists between the various mea-
sures, that must be borne in mind. If the
Second Conference reaches the happy results
aimed at by the American suggestions, the
First Conference must model its work on that
of the Second Conference.
If all the other radical measures contemplated
in the American scheme are accepted by the
Second Conference, the Agreement arrived at
by the First Conference will, it seems to me, be
at variance with, and will prevent the logical
execution of, the Agreement reached by the
Second Conference. It is our bounden duty
to co-ordinate our work in such a way as to
produce a harmonious and homogeneous whole.
With this purpose in view, I now declare that
we are prepared to sacrifice our present system
in the interests of the solidarity of this great
social work. We are prepared to accept the
American proposals in order to give the world
a striking and unmistakable proof of our earnest
desire* for international co-operation for the
welfare of humanity.
The Agreement reached by the First Conference
refers especially to Chapter II of the Hague


Convention, and is concluded as between the
States most directly concerned. Hence :
i. It does not constitute any real modi-
fication of the Convention, as such modi-
fication would necessitate the consent of
all the Signatory States.
2. It is conditional on the said Conven-
tion, which implies ;
(a) That it places no obstacle in the
way of the application of the Convention,
or of any modifications consistent with
the fundamental principle underlying it ;
( h) That, should any discrepancy become
apparent between the Agreement reached
by the First Conference and the work of
the Second Conference, it would be neces-
sary to co-ordinate and harmonise the two
in conformity with the fundamental prin-
ciple of the 1912 Convention.
I have already had occasion to explain how,
from the legal point of view, each of the Confe-
rences is of an independent character, but I must
point out also that, from the practical point
of view, the two form one whole. It was the
intention of the Powers represented at the
First Conference to perfect the work done at
The Hague. I need hardly state that it was
never their wish to place obstacles, in any guise,
in the way of improving any provision of the
1912 Convention. The work of co-ordination
which I now venture to propose would thus
serve the double purpose of revealing the mani-
fest good-will of the members of the First
Conference, and at the same time of safeguard-
ing the legitimate rights of the other Parties
signatory to the Hague Convention.
Both Opium Conferences have the same pur-
pose to improve and perfect the work begun
at The Hague. If the two Conventions fail
to satisfy the essential requirement of gradual
and effective suppression, they will not be
in keeping with the spirit which should inspire
all our resolutions. This the American dele-
gation understood clearly-, and is therefore
deserving of all praise. It is the moral duty,
therefore, of the Conference to examine with
the greatest sympathy the point of view of this
great friendly Power, which is as anxious as
we are to accomplish a work of humanity,
justice and morality. Should the First Confe-
rence find itself unable to accept the American
scheme, it would be necessary to arrive at a
compromise which should meet the present
situation and at the same time be in keeping
with justice and equity.
I have submitted these few remarks simply
in order to make my attitude perfectly clear,
to define my responsibility, to throw as much
light as possible on the situation, and to show
the way of future development. I am in
favour of the American suggestions, and am
prepared to accept them in agreement with the
other delegations. The work to be done forms
one homogeneous whole, of which the various
parts are interdependent. One single defect
may mean the collapse of the whole structure.
There must be an absolute balancing of the
different parts. There must be perfect har-
mony and absolute cohesion. Prepared opium
must be made subject to regulations as strict
as those which apply to other dangerous drugs.
It is only right that an attempt should be
made to put a stop as soon as possible to the
use of prepared opium, which seriously impedes
the realisation of our work, our aim being to
limit to strictly medical and scientific purposes
the production, manufacture and importation
of narcotic drugs, to create a Central Board
for this purpose, and to impose on the Powers
an obligation to furnish information and esti-
mates.
From the humanitarian point of view, the
two Conferences are of equal importance as
steps towards the realisation of the same ideal.
It is only a united front that can ensure the
glorious victory towards which all the dele-
gations aspire with equal fervour.
The President
Translahon : The Hon. Stephen Porter,
delegate of the United States of America, will
address the Conference.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States of
America)
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the
delegation from the United States has been at
Geneva two months and three days, and I
still find myself pleading for a hearing on the
most important item in the suggestions made
by my Government. I rise for the last time
to ask for a hearing, because it should be per-
fectly obvious to all of us that the spirit that
forbids a hearing will never bring about a suc-
cessful Conference.
It has been a source of regret to me that
I have not felt it prudent to follow the usual
rough-and-tumble method of the body of
which I have been a member for many years,
namely, to speak extemporaneously, for I
have felt that it was the duty of every delegate
to lay before the Conference not only his own
judgment but the deliberate and well-thought-
out judgment of his colleagues. I have there-
fore always followed the rule of putting our
arguments into writing so that there would not
be the slightest doubt about the position of
the entire delegation.
I thank the distinguished delegate from Japan
for the manner in which he has met this situa-
tion. I also congratulate Japan upon the
way in which she has honestly and sincerely
tried to suppress this ghastly traffic. Japan?s
policy is founded upon the proper principle,
namely, suppression without regard to revenue.
As Bishop Brent has so well said, when it was
discovered how lucrative a method it is for pur-
poses of revenue, Governments easily dissembled
with themselves and postponed reform inde-
finitely.
It is not our purpose to suggest the methods
by which this traffic shall be suppressed. We
are merely asking that a solemn compact
made between the nations of the world many
years ago shall be performed. It is not for
us to say how it shall be done. Those who
entered into that compact did so with full
knowledge of the responsibilities involved, and
if it were impossible of performance it was known
then just as well as it is known now.
The distinguished gentleman from Japan
knows more about the way of handling this
situation in a moment than I do in a lifetime,
and a method which would be effective in Japan
might be perfectly useless in Hong-Kong or
Singapore. I desire, therefore, to impress upon
the Conference that the delegation from the
United States has not the slightest intention


of interfering with the method to be used for
the suppression of this traffic. All we ask
is that this solemn compact, which means so
much to mankind, shall be carried out.
I have not had the opportunity of examining
closely the record of the speech of the distin-
guished delegate of the British Empire, but
he made one statement that I feel it is my duty,
in the interest of the people which I represent, to
challenge at the hrst opportunity. The state-
ment was that the per capita consumption of
opium ip the United States of America, accord-
ing to information which had been furnished
to him, was greater than that in India. Let
me read it to you. Speaking of the ill-effects
of these drugs he said : ?It is a terrible social
evil? I agree with him ?producing phy-
sical and moral degradation and 1 understand
from the representatives of the United States
that it is one of the evils which is, I will not
say particularly, but markedly bad in America,
where it is giving the American Government the
greatest anxiety; indeed, I have seen figures
stat ing that the consumption of opium per head is
very much greater in America than it is in India.
It is undoubtedly a very terrible thing and though
it may be, and I think is, less in my own country
than it is in some others, yet wherever it
exists it is a very serious evil ; it is of the
utmost importance that this Conference, what-
ever view you may take of its mandate, which
was primarily called to deal with this evil,
should not be led astray from dealing with
it.?
Later the same distinguished gentleman said,
?I have learned with great pain, not from what
has gone on in the Conference, but from what
has transpired outside, that there is a measure
of distrust of this nation and of that nation
and, for all I know, particularly of my own in
this matter. I earnestly protest against that
attitude, which does not make for progress,
nor is it of any use whatever. If we want to
get on with this work, we must abandon recri-
mination and adopt the policy of co-operation.
With all due respect to the distinguished
delegate of the British Empire, I must suggest
that he is hardly practising what he preaches
when he states that the use of opium in the
United States of America is greater than in
India. If he can utter a greater slander against
any people than that I would like to know what
it is.
Now what are the facts? Unfortunately,
some four or five years ago someone connected
with our Government issued a semi-official
report to the effect that the per capita consump-
tion of opium in the United States was 36
grains per annum. By looking at the figures
it is perfectly obvious to anyone that the total
imports for that year were taken and divided
by the population, without any reduction
whatever for exports, and for opium that
passed through the United States. It is said
that one can never catch up with a falsehood.
I have been trying to catch up with this one
for many years. It has been contradicted
in every manner, shape and form, and I want
now and for ever to denounce it as a vile slander
upon the people of the United States.
(Viscount Cecil (British Empire) here rose
to reply).
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States of
America)
Let me just go a step farther ; you will have
plenty of time to reply.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
I was only going to withdraw my statement.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States of
America) :
Let me continue my argument. I do not
for a moment suggest that you knew it was
untrue. Far be it from me to suggest anything
of that sort, but I do say that it is a curious
fact that your advisers did not know that it was
untrue.
I call your attention to Part I of Document
O.D.C. i (i) prepared for the Second Opium
Conference, in the composition of which the
distinguished gentleman from the British Em-
pire, Sir Malcolm Delevingne, took an active
part. Surely this Conference should be willing
to accept whatever its own record says. That
document states : ?the United States of
America, estimated requirements, 0.56. That
is a little less than 8 grains per capita. ?Great
Britain 0.54.? The difference is negligible-
? Canada 0.58 ; Denmark 0.89 ; Finland 0.6 ;
New Zealand 0.51 ; the Netherlands 0.41,?
showing that the annual per capita consumption
in the United States of America is practically
the same as in nearly all the European countries.
It is to the credit of the Teutonic and Slavic
races that their annual per capita consumption
is much lower than ours. Such is the record?a
record which Was prepared for the Opium Advi-
sory Committee, of which the distinguished
delegate from the British Empire, Sir Malcolm
Delevingne, is an active member. It seems
strange to me that that statement, that vile
reflection upon the morals of the people of the
United States, should have been repeated in
this Conference, held under the auspices of the
League of Nations, which many hope to become
some day the Parliament of the world.
One other thing. The distinguished dele-
gate from the Netherlands requests the figures
of our seizures in the Philippine Islands for
the years 1923-4. In May 1923 Bishop Brent
made a speech in which he gave the figures
for 1920, 1921 and 1922. That is a year and
a-half ago. If at any time the distinguished
gentleman from the Netherlands desired later
figures he should have asked for them and not
have waited until the last moment when it is
impossible to furnish them.
The purpose of the request is perfectly
obvious. It is to intimate that we have not
been successful in the suppression of this
traffic in the Philippine Islands. We have
not been completely successful there or in
the continental United States, and we never
will be until this traffic is attacked at the
source. But I would like to remind you of
this : when the Philippine Islands passed
into the possession of the United States, the
smoking of opium was almost as rampant as
it is in any of the possessions of the nations
which are here to-day defending it. Later on,
one of our great Presidents, one of our greatest
Presidents, who is now among the immortals
of the Republic, Theodore Roosevelt, said that
it must stop, and it did stop. In 19�3 we
imported 254,000 lbs. of opium, and we had
revenue from it. We took our loss of revenue,
but I am happy to say to you that ,we did not
experience an entire loss, for we gained in the


giatitude and affection of the Philippine people.
Let us see the effect. In 1918 the imports
amounted to approximately 235 lbs ; in 1919
to 237 lbs ; in 1920 to 150 lbs., and in 1921
to 192 lbs.
I admit that opium does enter the Philippine
Islands. I wish to say to you, however, that
we are spending immense sums of money in
Lying to keep it out, but we find it impossible.
From where does that opium come ?
I will put the record of the United States in
the Philippines, where we are spending great
sums of money to protect our people and
where the pallid face, the hollow eyes, the
abscesses upon the body caused by the hypo-
dermic syringe which is used by the victims
of these drugs, are seldom if ever seen I
will put that record before the world beside
the record of the Netherlands in the
Netherlands East Indies.
The distinguished delegate of the British
Empire has suggested that he is willing to
withdraw his statement in regard to the per
capita consumption. I did not ask him to do
so, because I felt he would do it as a matter
of justice to a people many of whom admire
and respect him to the fullest extent.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
I greatly regret that anything I said in my
speech could be regarded by anyone, and above
all by the distinguished delegate of the United
States of America, as an attack upon his people
or his country. I accept absolutely, of course,
the figures he has given of the consumption
in the United States, and I regret that in
reading the great mass of papers before me I
was misled into using figures which are appar-
ently devoid of foundation.
I, of course, withdraw the allegation abso-
lutely, but I wish to say that I did not intend
my remarks as an allegation against the United
States of America or their people. I merely
meant them as an illustration of the terrible
extent to which, even in so very great, so very
distinguished and so highly civilised a country,
this evil had spread, and to show the importance
of dealing with the drug evil as revealed by
this state of affairs.
I withdraw the allegation absolutely, but
I understand that there is no difference of
opinion between us as to the importance of
dealing with the consumption of heroin, mor-
phine, etc.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) :
Ihe motion proposed by the delegation of
the United States reads as follows :
t ?On behalf of the delegation of the
United States of America, I hereby present
for the consideration of the Conference
Chapter II of the suggestions of the United
States of America, and move that the
proposals contained in this Chapter be
referred by the Conference to an appropriate
Committee for consideration.?
I desire to make it clear that, under this
motion, the question of the merits of the proposal
submitted by the delegation of the United States
xegarding the suppression of the traffic in pre-
pared opium is not before the Conference.
The only question with which the Conference is
now to deal is whether we are to be permitted
to present our suggestions to the Conference
and whether the Conference will refer them
to an appropriate Committee where they can
be considered upon their merits. A favourable
vote on this motion, therefore, means that the
Conference will refer Chapter 11 of our suggestions
to an appropriate Committee, and does not
necessarily imply that our proposals will be
adopted by the Conference.
I might say, however, that I do not subscribe
to the view that a unanimous vote is necessary
in order that the Conference may consider the
question of the suppression of the traffic in
prepared opium. On the contrary, it is our
view that the Conference may, by a majority
vote, undertake to consider the proposals.
The distinguished delegate of the British
Empire took occasion yesterday to express the
view that the British Government could not
concede that the question of the measures to
be adopted for the suppression of the traffic in
prepared opium was within the competence of
the Second Conference. The question of
competence has heretofore been discussed at some
length, and I shall not, therefore, repeat in
detail the arguments that we have advanced
in support of our position. Succinctly stated,
our view is that, under Assembly Resolution
VI, the present Conference was called as a
means of giving effect to the principles sub-
mitted by the representatives of the United
States and to the policy which the League, on
the recommendation of the Advisory Committee,
has adopted.
Allow me to quote those principles with
which you are all familiar :
?i; If the purpose of the Hague Con-
vention is to be achieved according to its
spirit and true intent, it must be recognised
that the use of opium products for other
than medicinal and scientific purposes is
an abuse and not legitimate.
?2. In order to prevent the abuse of
these drugs, it is necessary to exercise the
control of the production of raw opium in
such a manner that there will be no surplus
available for non-medicinal and non-scien-
tific purposes.?
It cannot be denied and the Conference so
decided in connection with the presentation of
Article I of our suggestions?that, under the prin-
ciples stated, the present Conference may con-
sider measures for the control of the production
of raw opium in such a manner that there will
be no surplus available for non-medicinal and
non-scientific purposes. If the production of
raw opium is controlled so that there will be
no surplus available for non-medicinal and
non-scientific purposes, it necessarily follows
that no raw opium shall be produced for the
manufacture of prepared opium, since all must
concede that smoking-opium is not used for a
medicinal or scientific purpose. In Chapter
II of our suggestions we therefore have fixed
a definite period after which the use of opium
for smoking purposes shall no longer be per-
mitted.
So much for the question of competence.
At best it is only a technical answer, and the
arguments advanced in its support are not as
important as the reasons which impel such a
defence to be offered. Every nation here
represented can, if it will, agree that the ques-


tion of the traffic in prepared opium shall be
thrown open for discussion.
The delegate of the British Empire read
yesterday a declaration on behalf of the British
Government which, in substance, provides that
the British Government undertakes that opium-
smoking is temporarily authorised within a
period of not more than 15 years from the
date on which the effective execution of the
measures taken by China to suppress the
growth of the opium poppy has reached such
a stage as to remove the danger mark that
language of opium-smuggling from C hina
into these territories. The question when the
effective execution of the measures has reached
the stage referred to shall, it is provided, be
decided by a Commission to be appointed by
the Council of the League of Nations, whose
decision shall be final. Other conditions are
contained in the proposal, but as I shall discuss
them later they need not be referred to here.
While the distinguished delegate from the
British Empire did not formally present the
declaration to the Conference for consideration,
which I very deeply regret, I shall discuss the
declaration as though this had been done,
as I feel that the Conference is entitled to
know the attitude of the delegation of the Uni-
ted States in the matter.
On a former occasion I took the opportunity
of pointing out to the Conference that the
United States of America and other nations
have in good faith fulfilled the obligations under-
taken under Chapter II of the Hague Conven-
tion and that they therefore have the unques-
tioned right to insist that nations which have
not taken the steps contemplated by the Con-
vention likewise take measures for the effective
and 'progressive suppression of the traffic in
prepared opium and that such nations do not,
by supplementary agreements between them-
selves or otherwise, weaken the Hague Con-
vention in such a manner as to release them-
selves directly or indirectly from the fulfilment
of obligations undertaken under that Con-
vention.
A treaty or convention is, in effect, a contract
between independent States and depends, for
the most part, for the enforcement of its pro-
visions on the honour and the interest of the
Governments parties thereto. As stated by
Vattel in his admirable work on the Law of
Nations (page 229)
?Who can doubt that treaties are in the
number of those things that are to be
held sacred by nations ? By treaties the
most important _ affairs are determined ;
by them the pretensions of sovereigns are
regulated ; on them nations are to depend
for the acknowledgment of their rights
and the security of their dearest interests.
Between bodies politic between sove-
reigns who acknowledge no superior on
earth treaties are the only means of
adjusting their various pretensions of
establishing fixed rules of conduct of
ascertaining what they are entitled to
expect and what they have to depend on.
But treaties are no better than empty
words if nations do not consider them as
respectable engagements as rules which
are to be inviolably observed by sove-
reigns and held sacred throughout the
whole earth.
?The faith of treaties that firm and
sincere resolution that invariable
constancy fulfilling our engagements of
which we make profession in a treaty, is
therefore to be held sacred and inviolable
between the nations of the earth, whose
safety and repose it secures. . .
As Hyde points out in his recent woik
on International Law (pages i and 2, Vol. II) :
?The disposition of States to contract
with each other, and their habitual re-
course to such action, have been due to
a wide perception of the common advan-
tage derivable from undertakings to limit
reciprocally individual freedom of action,
and to confidence in the efficacy of such
means to fix restraints not otheiwise
to be established save by the sword.
?The number of agreements concluded
since the beginning of the 19th centuiy
testifies to the conviction of statesmen
that international compacts are capable
of operating as such a deterrent. Because
there has been found to be a readiness on
the part of States to acknowledge that an
obligation of an essentially legal character
possessing the quality which the law
familiarly attaches to contracts between
individuals should be deemed to be impres-
sed upon public international agreements,
it has proven desirable as well as feasible
for nations to negotiate them. Treaties
are thus concluded because, in the mind
of the contracting parties, their under-
takings are to be performed and because the
right of non-performance is given up.?
If a treaty is in effect a contract between
States, and if the legal rights and obligations
arising therefrom may generally be regarded
as analogous to those arising from contracts
between individuals, it is clear that the rights
of nations signatory to the Hague Convention
which have fulfilled their part of the agreement
and the obligations of those nations which have
as yet to take measures for the effective and
progressive suppression of the traffic in prepa-
red opium are well defined.
I shall therefore, with your permission, dis-
cuss in some detail the declaration offered on
behalf of the British Government.
Paragraph 1 provides
?His Majesty?s Government undertakes
that opium-smoking shall be abolished
in the British Far Eastern territories in
which such smoking is temporarily autho-
rised, within a period of not more than
fifteen years from the date on which the
effective execution of the measures taken
by China to suppress the growth of the
opium poppy has reached such a stage as
to remove the danger of opium-smuggling
from China into those territories.?
Our objection to the foregoing provision is
not based upon considerations of a technical
nature. We are not prepared to accept this
proposal because we cannot give our assent to
the principle involved. We cannot admit that
the obligation to take effective and progres-
sive steps for the suppression of the traffic in
prepared opium which each nation signatory
to the Hague Convention undertook to enforce
can be held in abeyance pending the occurrence


of an event as uncertain and as indefinite as
the one suggested by the British Government.
We are of the opinion that the obligation to
take progressive and effective measures for
the* suppression of the prepared opium traffic
is a continuous one and cannot even tempo-
rarily be arrested.
May I also invite attention to the subtlety
of the language used in paragraph 1. You
will note that the period of fifteen years is not
to run from the date on which China has effec-
tively suppressed the growth of the poppy but
from that time when such effective suppression
has reached such a stage as to remove the danger
of opium-smuggling from China into the terri-
tories. Is it not a fact that, so long as opium
is produced, the danger exists that it will
enter the illicit traffic ?
Smuggling is a crime like homicide, like
burglary, like larceny. Crimes have existed
for centuries, and it is likely that they will exist
for centuries to come. To predicate the
performance of this solemn obligation upon the
removal of the danger of smuggling puts the
execution of that obligation so far in the future
that all of us who are here will have passed on
and those who come after will have joined us.
I do not know whether, when we reach the
millennium, there will be any danger of the com-
mission of crime, but I fancy it might exist
even then.
I want to impress that language upon the
Conference ?the danger of smuggling remo-
ved". Who is to determine that fact ? We
are all in danger every moment of our lives of
crime being committed against us. Uncertain
as is the date when China will be in a position
to execute effective measures for the suppres-
sion of the growth of the opinm poppy, still
more indefinite is the time when these measures
shall be such as to remove all danger of opium-
smuggling.
I may mention a further point, namely, that
since the period of fifteen years is not to run
until China has taken the steps suggested,
the effect of the proposal, if adopted, would be
that if any nation should be desirous of main-
taining the traffic in prepared opium for pur-
poses of revenue, or otherwise, it would not
endeavour to assist China in any way in her
effort to adopt the measures contemplated,
but, on the contrary, the incentive would be
to discourage and even in some cases to throw
obstacles in the way of China?s earnest endea-
vours in this direction.
Paragraph 2 of the proposal provides
?As soon as it is established in the manner
indicated in the following paragraph that
the effective execution of the said measures
has reached the stage referred to above,
the necessary measures will be initiated
to enable the complete prohibition of
smoking to be effected at the end of the
said period.?
This paragraph is indefinite that ?neces-
sary measures will be initiated to enable the
complete prohibition of smoking to be effected
at the end of the said period". The First
Conference, after long discussion, was unable
to come to an agreement with respect to the
adoption of any measures reasonably calculated
to accomplish the purpose desired. If the
British delegation is in a position to state what
measures are necessary to accomplish the
purpose sought for it would seem advisable
for the sake of clarity to enumerate them in the
paragraph.
Paragraph 3 provides :
?The question when the effective exe-
cution of the measures mentioned in para-
graph 1 has reached the stage referred to
in that paragraph shall be decided by a
Commission to be appointed by the Council
of the League of Nations, whose decision
shall be final."
Aside from the question of the manner of
the appointment of the Commission, this para-
graph is objectionable for the reason that it
is, in effect, an attempt to suspend the perfor-
mance of obligations undertaken under the
Hague Convention until a Commission has found
it advantageous for such obligations to be
performed. To this principle we cannot sub-
scribe. Moreover, are we to expect that China
would be willing to permit any Commission to
pass final determination upon the question
whether the measures adopted by China for
the suppression of the poppy have reached such
a stage as to remove the danger of opium-
smuggling from China ?
Paragraph 4 provides :
?It is understood (1) that, as soon as the
period of fifteen years referred to in para-
graph 1 has begun to run, opium-smoking by
persons who are not smokers at that date
shall forthwith be prohibited."
I desire you to note that paragraph.
?(2) That the complete prohibition of
opium-smoking to be effected by the end
of the said period of fifteen years is not
inconsistent with special and temporary
provisions for persons in whose case it
is certified by the medical authorities of
the State concerned that they cannot be
completely deprived of the drug without
serious danger to life or health."
This is a most interesting provision. The
nations in the territories of which the use of
prepared opium is still temporarily permitted are
not to take any steps to prevent any increase
in the ranks of opium-smokers until the fifteen-
year period shall begin to run. We would
naturally have thought, and certainly we should
have had the right to expect, that one of the
first measures to be adopted by the Powers
after ratification of the Hague Convention would
have been the enactment of laws or regulations
to ensure that no new recruits would enter the
ranks of opium-smokers.
To our astonishment we find, years after
the obligation to suppress the traffic in pre-
pared opium was undertaken, that we are asked
to give our assent to a proposal that the Powers
concerned shall not immediately take steps to
prevent new recruits entering the ranks of
opium-smokers, but that such steps shall not
be taken until the occurrence of an event as
uncertain and as indefinite as the day when
homicide, burglary, larceny and smuggling
shall cease. It is unnecessary for me to state
that the delegation of the United States
cannot even acquiesce in such a proposal.
Mr. President, with regard to the provision
in the second part of paragraph 4 that special
provision be made for persons who cannot, in


the opinion of the medical authorities, be com-
pletely deprived of the drug without serious
danger to life or health, we find it unnecessary
to offer any comment, as this provision is
dependent upon the acceptance or rejection of
the preceding four paragraphs.
While we are aware that large quantities of
opium are being produced illicitly in China, I
might state that I am not prepared to accept
the view that China is alone in her failure to
fulfil the obligations undertaken under the
Hague Convention. Even if China is an offender,
this in itself does not excuse the other nations
from fulfilling their obligations.
On a former occasion, I drew attention to
the fact that the agreement concluded by the
First Conference noted that the increase of the
smuggling of opium in the greater part of the
territories of the Far East since the ratification
of the Hague Convention is hampering greatly
the accomplishment of the gradual and effec-
tive suppression of the traffic. No question
can arise as to what nation the Governments
represented at the First Conference had in
mind. It was, of course, China.
In my remarks just prior to adjournment I
quoted the following excerpt from a speech
made by Sir John Jordan :
?The argument will doubtless be urged,
and urged with perfect good reason, that
the widespread recrudescence of poppy
cultivation in China has added immensely
to the difficulties of the problem. That
I freely admit, and no one has more reason
to regret the Chinese relapse than I, who
devoted ten years of my life to the work
of opium suppression. But I would ask
in all earnestness if the fact that China has
fallen into a state of political disorder is
sufficient reason for the other Powers to
evade the obligations which they undertook
under Article 6 of the Hague Convention.
I do not think so.?
I added that the delegation of the United
States was in accord with the view of Sir John
Jordan that the failure of China or any other
country, through internal disorder or otherwise,
to prevent effectively the illicit traffic in opium
does not relieve other Powers signatory to
the Hague Convention from the duty of ful-
filling the obligations which they have solemnly
undertaken.
In view of the foregoing, I am under the
necessity of informing the Conference that the
delegation of the United States cannot give
its approval to the declaration presented by
the British Government. We cannot admit
that justification exists for even a tempo-
rary suspension of the obligation which rests
upon every nation signatory to the Hague
Convention to take effective measures for the
progressive suppression of the traffic in prepared
opium. The Hague Convention is clear and
explicit as to the nature of the obligations
undertaken, and we are not prepared to forego
any right which, under that Convention, we
are entitled to enjoy.
The distinguished delegate of the British
Empire also referred in his remarks to the desi-
rability of organising a Commission of enquiry
to investigate conditions in the har East. He
doubtless had in mind the suggestion made
by Sir Malcolm Delevingne just prior to
the adjournment of the Conference in Decem-
ber.
At the fourteenth meeting of the Conference,
which was held on Friday, December 12th,
1924, Sir Malcolm Delevingne stated that'the
British Government had no desire to take up
an obstructive attitude with regard to the
buestion of prepared opium, and that it
was therefore willing that a small and impartial
Commission of enquiry, on which none of the
interested Powers would be represented, should
be appointed by the Council of the League of
Nations for the purpose of making a thorough
examination into the subject of prepared opium ;
that this commission would visit the Far Eastern
territories in which the use of opium for smoking
is still permitted China and the Philippine
Islands and would thereupon report to the
Council as to what further measures, if any,
could be usefully taken in order to bring about
the effective and gradual suppression of the
use of opium for smoking which is provided
for in Chapter II of the Hague Convention.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne added, however,
that he was not making a formal proposal on
behalf of the British Government, as the matter
was not considered one for the Second Confe-
rence, but, under instructions from his Govern-
ment, he took this opportunity of making known
the attitude of the British Government in the
matter.
Objections of a more or less serious nature
may be made to the organisation of the Com-
mission, to the nature of the duties
which it is intended that it shall perform,
and to the absence of any assurance that
the nations, the conditions in the territories
of which are to be the subject of examination,
will take the steps suggested by the Commission
with a view to the suppression of the traffic
in prepared opium.
Important as these and other objections of a
similar character may be, I do not desire to
take the time of the Conference to discuss them
in detail, as I am under the necessity of stating
that the delegation of the United States cannot
accept in principle the proposal offered by the
British Government. We cannot admit that
nations which, under the Hague Convention,
agreed to take measures for the progressive and
effective suppression of the traffic in prepared
opium are now entitled to have a commission
of enquiry appointed to ascertain whether they
shall at some future time undertake to perform
an obligation which they solemnly engaged
themselves to carry out more than ten years
ago.
During the years which have elapsed since
the foregoing obligation was undertaken, the
traffic in prepared opium does not, judging
from the facts brought to our notice, appear to
have been progressively and effectively sup-
pressed. That difficulties stand in the way
of the effective suppression of the traffic we
are prepared to recognise, but they are not of
such a character as to render impossible the
fulfilment of the obligations undertaken under
the Hague Convention. On the contrary, we
have the right to assume that the nations, at
the time when they ratified that Convention,
understood the nature and extent of the. diffi-
culties to be encountered. We therefore look
to them to take measures for the progressive
and effective suppression of the traffic in pre-
pared opium.


It may, of course, be urged that circumstances
or conditions have arisen, which could not have
been foreseen in 1912 or at the time of rati-
fication of the Convention, and which render it
extremely difficult for certain nations effectively
to suppress the use of prepared opium in the
territories under their jurisdiction.
Irrespective, however, of any change in con-
ditions or circumstances since the ratification
of the Convention, the performance of obliga-
tions by the contracting nations falls squarely
within the generally accepted principle of inter-
national as well as municipal law, namely, that
nations or individuals, as the case may be, who
solemnly undertake in an agreement to perform
an obligation are presumed to know, and if
necessary to anticipate, any difficulties which,
subsequently arising, may stand in the way of the
successful accomplishment of the purpose for
which the agreement was concluded. This
generally accepted principle needs no argument
in its support.
It is stated by Chitty in his work on Contracts
(page 821) and, by the way, I might say in
passing that, in my judgment, this is the best
work upon the subject that was ever written :
?And where the contract is to do a thing
which is possible in itself or where it is
conditional on an event which happens, the
promiser will be liable for a breach there-
of, notwithstanding that the occurrence
of an accident or other contingency which,
although it was not foreseen by or within
the control of the party, might have been
provided against by his contract, has put
it beyond his power to perform it.?
Since the manifest purpose of the Commission
of enquiry proposed by the British Government
is to investigate conditions in the Far Eastern
territories with the view to determine what
measures, if any, the nations concerned may
take to discharge obligations undertaken a
number of years ago, the delegation of the United
States must, for the reasons heretofore stated,
withhold its support from the proposal put
forward by the British Government. In view
of the fact that the traffic in prepared opium,
notwithstanding the obligations undertaken
under Chapter II of the Hague Convention, does
not appear to have been effectively and progres-
sively suppressed, and in the light of the facts
disclosed before the First Conference, the
Government of the United States is strongly
of the opinion that the time has come to place
in the Convention a definite time-limit aftex-
tile expiration of which the use of prepared
opium throughout the world shall no longer
be permitted. We therefore have inserted in
Chapter II of our suggestions a provision which,
if adopted and carried out, will ensure that
after ten years the traffic in prepared opium
will no longer exist.
Recognising, however, the difficulties con-
fronting a number of the nations in their desire
to stamp out effectively the traffic in prepared
opium, and being as desirous as any Government
here represented not to maintain an arbitrary
and obstructive attitude, the delegation of the
United States is willing to increase from ten
to fifteen years the period contained in Chapter
II of the suggestions, after the termination of
which the use of opium for smoking shall not
be permitted, and to leave entirely to the various
Governments concerned the question of the
internal measures to be adopted by them in
carrying out the obligation undertaken.
Article 8 of our suggestions might therefore
be amended to read somewhat as follows ;
?The Contracting Parties in whose ter-
ritories the use of prepared opium is now
temporarily permitted under the Hague
Convention agree that, within fifteen years
from the ratification of this Convention,
the importation, exportation, sale, manu-
facture, distribution, and use of prepared
opium in all territories subject to their
jurisdiction shall not be permitted.?
We are also not unwilling that the Convention
shall recognise, and if necessary make adequate
provision, with appropriate safeguards, for
persons in whose case it is certified by the compe-
tent medical authorities of the State concerned
that they cannot be completely deprived of
the drug without serious danger to life and
health.
I desire to apologise for speaking at such
great length, but I know we all realise the
tremendous importance of our duties to these
unfortunate people, these millions of unfortunate
fellow human beings. But it means more than
that; it means much for peace in the world. To
establish one law for the West, to safeguard
our own homes against these insidious drugs
and to leave the homes of the Oriental open
to exploitation is hardly conducive to peace.
Why should not they be treated as we are
treated ? Are not their children as near and
dear to them as ours are to us ? Away with
this nonsense one law for the East and another
for the West. Make it one law for the whole
world, and you will take a step that will bring
the world much nearer the goal that we all
hope for, namely, universal peace among the
peoples of the world.
The world is threatened with Bolshevism.
I have stood up and I have no objection to
stating it here and opposed the recognition
by the United States of the Government of
Russia, not so much on account of my own
country but because I appreciate the danger
to Europe of the recognition of Russia. I
realise that it would put in the hands of the
Bolsheviks a propaganda that might do great
harm. Yes, if we fail at this Conference we
put into their hands a propaganda for use in
the Far East that will do irreparable injury to
the peace of the world.
I have spoken much longer than I intended
and I hope you will pardon me, but I have spoken
from the heart. I have been interested in this
matter for a long time, and that interest will
never cease. We were cursed in America for
over a century and a half by human slavery.
It took a great war, that almost destroyed our
Republic, to suppress it.
Opium is only another form of slavery, and
may I not say that it is the worst form, because
the master who owned slaves had a financial inte-
rest in their physical welfare and they at least
received good care. John Brown, with a few
followers, left the State of Kansas in the late
fifties in a hopeless effort to suppress human
slavery. He was captured at Harper?s Ferry,
Virginia ; he was tried and hanged ; and
a poetess, writing of his cause, said : ?Right is
ever upon the scaffold ; wrong is ever upon


the throne?. Why cannot we dedicate our-
selves here and now to reverse the order and
put right upon the throne and wrong upon the
scaffold ? [Applause.)

THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA ; MOTION
SUBMITTED BY THE DELEGATION OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA :
CONTINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
The President
Translation : Ladies and gentlemen, the
meeting is open.
I call upon Mr. Clayton, the delegate of
India, to speak.
Mr. Clayton (India)
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, we
heard during the debate which took place
before the adjournment a good deal about
idealism. I for one do not complain of that,
for one must remember all that this movement
for the suppression of opium owes to the
enthusiasm and inspiration of idealists, among
whom I desire to mention Bishop Brent.
But, Sir, it occurs to me, and it has occurred
to me throughout this debate, that we are
here as practical administrators. If we are
not ourselves practical administrators, it is
our duty to produce something which practical
administrators can carry out, and, from the
point of view of a practical administrator, I
venture to suggest that idealism pure and simple
is but a poor guide and, if implicitly relied upon,
is likely to become a will-o?-the-wisp, which
will lead us all into a morass.
There is a higher quality than idealism for
this workaday world I mean statesmanship.
That is a quality which has been defined by
a great English publicist in the following
words : ?Idealism without illusions, and real-
ism with faith.? It is in that spirit that I
would ask this Conference to consider the
question which is now before it.
In a former speech made during this same
debate, I ventured to put forward certain juri-
dical arguments which seemed to me to be
apposite and satisfactory. I do not propose
to repeat them now, but I desire to affirm them.
I wish at the same time to say that I have lis-
tened to the arguments on the other side which
were reaffirmed this morning, but they appear
to me to have no more validity than they
appeared to have when they were first uttered.
1 do not wish, however, to deal with juridical
arguments, for I realise that there are many dele-
gates present in this room who are impatient
of them. They did not come here to be stopped
in their enquiry ; they came here to do some-
thing, to take any practical step which they
may think advisable for the advancement of the
cause which they have at heart, and when the
representative of India, or any other delegate,
rises in his place and pleads the question of
competence, they regard him as a man who
stands with his back against a closed door and
refuses to allow them to enter. They draw
the conclusion that because the door is closed
there must be something hidden behind that
closed door, something unfit for disclosure.
If any member of this Conference, during the
earlier part of this debate, has ever had any
such thought, surely his fears must have been dis-
sipated after hearing the speeches made yester-
day. Could there be anything more open and
straightforward than the explanations which
were then given ? If those explanations are
not satisfactory, I feel certain that members
have only to ask for more details and the fullest
possible explanations will be given by every
delegation concerned.
India is not closely affected by the motion
now before the Conference. In most provinces
in India, smoking is regarded as a vice, and is
practically non-existent. In Burma, all smokers
are now registered and every possible step is
being taken to eradicate smoking. As India,
however, is the country from which several
other Governments derive their supplies of
opium for smoking purposes, I think it right
to say a word or two the fewest possible
words, in view of the speech of the British dele-
gate yesterday as to the Indian position.
The Indian Government claims that, so far
as the opium produced within its borders is
concerned, India is absolutely water-tight.
Only in infinitesimal quantities can Indian
opium escape its close internal control. Exports
are only sent to Governments which want them,
and only in the amounts covered by impotr
certificates, and the Indian Government further
reserves to itself the right to refuse exports,


even on a certificate, if it is not satisfied as
to the demands. The Government of India
is prepared to stop exports as soon as the import-
ing countries cease to require them.
We claim that our system is watertight even
as regards contraband. As far as drugs are
concerned, we have this extra evidence to
support that view. In the first place, as Vis-
count Cecil pointed out yesterday, the use of
Indian opium for the manufacture of drugs is
not, under existing circumstances, a commercial
proposition. Secondly, so far as the Govern-
ment of India is aware, no seizures of Indian
opium have been effected in the contraband
trade.
Having briefly described the Indian position,
I now wish to address you on the question before
the Conference. I ask you to look at the facts'
and in what I am going to say I wish to make
it clear that I am not addressing the delega-
tions of those Governments which have repre-
sentatives upon the Advisory Committee on
the traffic in Opium and other Dangerous
Drugs. know the facts, or could know
them. There are other delegations who have
come here, however, whose Governments are
not closely concerned with the very intricate
and difficult question of opium, and who have
come here with open minds, anxious to learn the
truth, and, I venture to say, perfectly ready to
support any course which may be proved to
them to be the right one. To them I say : Lay
aside your illusions, and face the facts with
faith !
If we are going to face the facts, what is the
main one which overshadows the whole ques-
tion of opium ? Surely, it is the question of
contraband. Contraband dominated the First
Conference, and, if we consider the matter
aright, it seems to me that it equally dominates
the Second. East and West, it is the same.
We have heard from the delegation of the Uni-
ted States what a serious trouble to its adminis-
tration is the question of contraband.
I was talking the other day to the delegate of
Canada, and he spoke to me of the enormous sums
of money which the Canadian Government has
to spend on the prevention of contraband. If
we cross the Pacific ,to China, we find that
China has its difficulties as regards contraband
production and also its difficulties as regards
contraband imports. A few words spoken by
the delegate for Japan this morning indicate
that Japan, in spite of her success in many
fields, is not altogether free from the difficulties
of contraband. As regards the Philippines,
we have heard from Bishop Brent of the diffi-
culties in that field. Moving nearer to my
own country, and coming to Indo-China, I
would refer you to the speech of the French
delegate yesterday.
Let us now pass to India. It is true that, in
India proper, our system prevents contraband,
except to an infinitesimal extent, as regards
ouj locally grown opium, but it is not so with
regard to imported drugs. The problem in that
respect is serious. In Burma, where we have
a long land-frontier, the problem of contraband
is also great.
I shall not delay the Conference further. You
might take almost any country in the world and
find that all of them (except, I think, one or
two happy countries in South America, whose
representatives assured us before the adjourn-
ment that they had no such trouble) have
difficulties m regard to contraband. Those
countries in South America apart, the whole
world groans under this trouble.
It seems to me, therefore, that it is really a
matter of very small importance whether our
agenda was restricted by the convening autho-
rity or not, for, whether or not it was so res-
tricted, it is definitely and most absolutely
restricted for us by the facts of the case. We
have to deal with contraband, and only when
we have dealt with contraband can we possibly
deal with domestic consumption or any other
such subject.
I put it to this Conference again that it is
impossible effectively to deal with domestic
consumption until contraband is controlled.
What does that mean ? It means that the
primary duty of this Conference is to make
every country watertight against contraband,
either proceeding from within or entering from
without. If we can do that, the .Second Opium
Conference will have succeeded. If we do
not do that, it will have failed, whether it
leads to any number of recommendations that
we should do this, that or the other in ten
years or not.
The engagements undertaken by the various
countries under the present Hague -Convention
seem to me to be perfectly adequate. I will
not accept in respect of my own country,
and I venture to think that there is no repre-
sentative of any country here who will accept
in respect of his, that those engagements
are not being fulfilled. The obligations that
we have undertaken are, as regards internal
matters, that we shall control our production
and our consumption and that we shall prevent
abuses ; as regards external matters, that we
shall prevent exports adversely affecting other
countries. I put it to the Conference that,
if one had to describe the real effect of the Hague
Convention in one sentence, it could not be
described more effectivelv than I have just
done.
All countries have been endeavouring, not
necessarily for many years the obligation has
only been on them since the ratification of the
Hague Convention to apply these principles.
Some countries began to apply them a long time
before that Convention was ratified ; India
began 112 years ago. At any rate, since the
ratification of the Hague Convention, all
countries have been engaged in trying to apply
its principles. What has been the difficulty ?
In every case the question of contraband has
been in the way. It appears to me that, in
order to make every country watertight, it
is our duty, as I have said, to improve our
international machinery so as to enable in
all cases the exporting and the importing
country to co-operate for the purpose of making
each other watertight.
I wish to be quite frank with this Conference,
and therefore, in giving an example of the
impossibility of reducing consumption before
the control of contraband, I propose to take
that province of India which I know best and
in which I have myself spent twenty-six years.
I do not know if the members of the Confe-
rence are aware of it, but we pride ourselves in
Burma on our opium administration. We have
a system of rationing and registration which we
regard as very successful, and we have recently
started a special system for the registration of
smokers.


In 1017-IQIB our licit opium consumption sident ; the more so when, like you Sir, the
was 40.000 kilogrammes. We reckon our illicit Uvenine
vv cvo O , 1 . r
traffic on the basis of ten times the amount ot
seizures. I think that this is an accepted cal-
culation. In 1917-1918, on that basis, our
illicit consumption was 8,000 kilogrammes,
the total opium in the province being 48,000
kilogrammes. In igiy-iQiS, as the Conference
is aware, the situation across our borders was
satisfactory. In 1923, as a result of five yearn
hard work, the licit consumption was reduced
to 32,000 kilogrammes. We might readily
claim that such a result was extraordinarily
satisfactory, representing as it does a reduction
by one-fifth in five years. But meanwhile our
seizures increased. We reckon that the illicit
trade in 1923 had risen to 36,000 kilogrammes,
making our total consumption 68,000 kilo-
grammes. Where was the advantage of our
reduction ? The control was as good as it had
been before, but the difference was in the
leakage across our borders.
Let me put another case, perhaps a more
simple one and one which, possibly, may appeal
to Mr. Porter. Suppose that I am interested
in fishing and lease a river. I then find that
the stock of fish is gravely depleted, partly
because the previous owner brought many
friends to fish and partly because the local people
helped themselves at night. I suggest that I
should not first take the step of reducing the
invitations to my friends, but that I should
first deal with the illicit fishing, with the poach-
ing, with the contraband. I think that all
members of the Conference will agree that they
would do the same. In the case of opium as
of the fish, the contraband must be our first
aim.
There is a further point. The proposal of
the United States raises the question of the
right of each country to control its own domes-
tic consumption. In that regard I have only
this to say ; the exclusion of internal affairs
from international intervention is a cardinal
principle in the Hague Convention, and I ven-
ture to think it is also a cardinal principle of
the League of Nations. That principle has been
reaffirmed in this Conference by several Sub-
Committes and I think that, in the 01 dinary
sphere of the world?s politics, it has no greater,
no stronger supporter than the great nation
from which Mr. Porter and his friends come and
which they represent so successfully in our
midst.
When, therefore, the delegation of the United
States comes here and asks that we shall inter-
fere with domestic consumption and turn aside
from our real duty that of controlling inter,
national contraband I can only say that-
although I respect its idealism and appreciate
its enthusiasm, I feel bound to suggest that
its idealism is still tinged with illusion and that
it has not yet learned to face the facts with
faith.
Some seven weeks ago, this same question of
competence was debated here with reference
to another proposal. The view I urged then
as to the authority which was alone empowered
to decide the question, I venture to urge now.
When an international conference is unanimous,
it may legitimately enlarge its agenda. When
it is not unanimous, the only authority which
has the power to decide what matters do or
do not fall within the purposes for which that
Conference was summoned is, surely, the Pre-
and acclaimed nominee of our convening
authority.
On the last occasion you did, indeed, put
the question to the Conference , but before
doin� so you announced your own decision and
it was clear that many delegates held the same
view as the Indian delegation and regarded
your finding, Sir, as decisive. On that occa-
sion, moreover, no opportunity was given for the
discussion of the practical merits of the proposal.
You, however, found that the juridical argu-
ments and the practical arguments coincided,
though in a manner hostile to the contention of
my delegation, and you decided accordingly.
That decision, for the purposes of this Confe-
rence and its discussions, the Government of
India has accepted.
On the present occasion, another method nas
been adopted. The door to the discussion o
the practical merits of the proposal has been
thrown open and you, Sir, were in a position
to judge, with the fullest knowledge, the facts
of the case from every point of view. I venture
to think once more that, not only in your
opinion but in the opinion of every delegation
present, the juridical arguments and the prac-
tical arguments will be found to coincide.
Mav I express the hope that the delegation o
the'' United States of America may recognise
this fact ? It has secured the full discussion
of its proposal. If its case has not yet been
fullv presented, it has still an opportunity
to fill all the gaps it may wish to fill. It has
obtained the fullest explanations explana-
tions which I hope it will find satisfactory when
it has had time to read the speeches delivered
yesterday. If any further explanations are
desired, I feel sure that they will be given as
readily as possible. I ask the United States
delegation. Will it not now be satisfied and
consent to withdraw its proposal ?
If, however, it cannot see its way to take this
course, it will be for you, Sir, again to
take the decision. We know that it will be
taken in a spirit of the highest statesmanship
and we trust that it will be one which can be
accepted, not with abstentions, not with the
opposition of a few or of a minority, however
small, but with the unanimous approval ot
all the delegations present.
The President :
Translation : M. Sze, delegate of China, will
address the Conference.
SVI. Sze (China) ;
Mr. President and members of the Conference,
before I address you, 1 wish to ask your per-
mission to preface what I have to say by one
or two remarks.
First of all, members of the Conference, i
wish to assure you that I treat you all alike,
whether you are among those who only came
yesterday or are among those who were heie
at the beginning of the Conference, or among
those with whom I had the pleasure of working at
the First Conference. I treat you all alike.
We are all on an equal footing ; we are all
plenipotentiaries. -
Secondly, I wish to make a remark which i
had the honour of making in the First Confe-
rence. Remarks were made here yesterday,
and there have been others to-day, which icier


to my country ; in some of them the name of
my country was specifically mentioned and in
others there were insinuations.
I do not propose to-day for various reasons
to take issue with regard to those remarks or
to correct them. My first reason is that the
statement which I am about to read to you,
particularly with reference to the subject now
before us, is sufficiently long, and I do not
wish to take up too much of your time by other
matters. Secondly, some of the remarks were
so absurd, so manifestly absurd, that it would
reflect on your intelligence if I were to take up
your time by telling you that they are wrong.
This is obvious from the facts of the case;
therefore I shall not deal with those remarks.
I have already taken up the time of the First
Conference on this issue, and the falsity of
these allegations has been explained to it
and no challenge has been made as to their
disproof either by members of the First Confe-
rence or by anybody else. Since that time,
no lady or gentleman, whether a newcomer or
an old member, has pointed out to me that
I was wrong. I shall therefore content myself
by at once reading to you the paper that I
have prepared.
Mr. President and members of the Confe-
rence, I shall not conceal the concern that I
felt when, four weeks ago, this Conference found
itself compelled to adjourn in order to prevent
a confession upon its part of its inability to
effect the purpose for which it had been con-
vened. Now that we have been again convened,
my concern has been deepened by reason of the
declarations that have been made by certain
of the delegations, and especially by that of
the British Empire.
In the address that was made yesterday by
Viscount Cecil, the chief of the British delega-
tion, a number of assertions were made the
correctness of which might easily be challenged ;
but I shall not now take up the time of the Con-
ference by dealing with them, since I am anxious
to keep our discussion above the level of dis-
putable matters of fact, and to have it deal
with broader and more fundamental issues.
When I come to deal with the specific proposal
which Viscount Cecil has made on behalf of
his Government, I shall likewise consider its
essential character rather than its accidental
or specific features.
Before doing this, however, I wish to express
personally and on behalf of my Government and
people, my and their appreciation of the state-
ment of His Lordship that his Government
accepts, with full confidence in their sincerity,
the assurances that the Chinese delegation has
given to the effect that the Chinese Government
will not depart from its policy of absolute prohibi-
tion of the production and consumption of opium
in China save for strictly medicinal and scien-
tific purposes, and that when its authority
is again completely established throughout the
provinces it will, as one of its first measures,
take effective steps, to the extent of its adminis-
trative and executive power, to bring to an
end that production and consumption of opium
within China which, though illegal under
Chinese law, the Government is now not able
to suppress.
The proposal presented by Viscount Cecil on
behalf of the British Government is in effect a
proposal that the obligation unqualifiedly
assumed by the Powers in Chapter II of the
Hague Convention shall be transformed into a
conditional and contingent one. These Powers,
which still legalise the use of prepared opium
within their several territories or possessions,
obtain their opium for this use from abroad.
If we examine the purposes especially
enumerated by the League of Nations, for
the attainment of which we were invited
to assemble at Geneva, it is found that one
of them is ?the conclusion of an agreement as
to the measures for giving effective application
in the Far East to Part II of the (Hague)
Convention and as to a reduction of the amount
of raw opium to be imported for the purpose
of smoking in those territories where it is tem-
porarily continued?.
In the face of this admonition, contained
in the resolutions of the Assembly, and which
furnishes us with the official basis for our work,
we are now asked to weaken rather than to
strengthen the obligations which the Powers
solemnly assumed when they signed and ratified
the Hague Convention ; to avoid the exe-
cution of an obligation unqualified in its terms,
and in its place to assume an obligation the
fulfilment of which is to be dependent upon the
coming into existence of certain conditions in
another country. Convened to do a certain
thing, we are asked to do the opposite. In-
stead of proposing measures which will give
effective application to the obligations assumed
by the Powers in Chapter II of the Hague
Convention, it is proposed that we shall impair
and weaken those obligations.
For these reasons, fundamental in their
nature, and relating directly to the sanctity
of international contracts, the Chinese dele-
gation is constrained to express its dissent from
the proposal which the delegation of the British
Empire has presented. This opposition is thus
in no wise based upon a fear that the Govern-
ment of China will not be able, in the near
future, to bring to an end within its borders
the present production and consumption of
opium, which are illegal under the Chinese law.
On the contrary, the rapidly rising tide of anti-
opium public opinion in China gives assurance
that this can and will be done. What the
Chinese delegation does object to and it is
convinced that the other delegations will also
object is that an unqualified obligation shall
be transmuted into a conditional or contingent one
and thus that authorisation shall be given by this
Conference to a retreat from, instead of an
advance towards, that goal which we are striving
to reach.
It would be difficult, if not impossible, to
explain our action before the world should we
take such a backward step. In China it would
be difficult, indeed I may say that it would be
impossible, to explain and justify such action.
Ihe Chinese people, who fully appreciate the
opium evils which now so unfortunately beset
them, though discouraged by the failure upon
the part of the Powers with Far Eastern pos-
sessions to take effective steps to suppress the
smoking of opium by the thousands and hundreds
of thousands of Chinese who dwell in these pos-
sessions, have had their hopes again raised by
the convening of the two Conferences at Geneva.
If it shall appear from the attitude taken
by these Western Powers at this Conference
that, so far from undertaking to take steps
to bring to an end, within a brief or definite
period of years, the legalised smoking of opium


within their several possessions, it is their
desire to postpone to an indefinite date such
a suppression, my people will be greatly
shocked.
These Powers have repeatedly declared their
desire to give to China such aid as they properly
can in order to enable her to correct the opium
evils which now afflict her. If this aid is to
be given, Mr. President, it should be given now
and not at some uncertain date. This present
aid, which China eagerly desires, can be given
in its most effective and, possibly, its only
wholly acceptable form by action upon the
part of the Powers so to control the manufac-
ture and exportation of narcotic drugs that an
end will be put to the contraband trade in those
drugs and therefore to the flood of illicit mor-
phine, heroin and cocaine which is now enter-
ing China and doing such dire damage to her
people, and by such action upon the part of
the Powers which have Far Eastern posses-
sions as will bring to an early termination the
traffic in prepared opium a traffic which
especially affects, and, in some cases, exclu-
sively affects, the Chinese residents in those
possessions.
My delegation, Mr. President, has not attemp-
ted to deny the existence of contraband trade
in opium, some of which opium, though by no
means all of it, is of Chinese origin ; nor has
my delegation sought to assert that this illicit
trade has not increased the task of progres-
sively reducing the licit traffic in those posses-
sions in which the use of prepared opium is still
permitted by law. But what the Chinese dele-
gation has objected to has been the magni-
fication of the extent of this illicit trade, and
the bringing forward of its existence by the
Powers as a reason why they should be released
from the performance of the solemn interna-
tional obligation which they assumed when they
signed or gave their adherence to the Hague
Convention. Especially does the Chinese dele-
gation object to this attempt to evade a contrac-
tual obligation upon this ground in view of
the fact that the Governments concerned have
made no serious attempt to demonstrate that
they have themselves made every effort that
is reasonably possible to check that contraband
trade.
But, however that may be, and it is to be
admitted that it is a matter upon which it is
impossible to speak with precision, it is not
proper that the Powers which still permit the
use of prepared opium in their Far Eastern
possessions should seek to excuse themselves
from doing what they can to reduce this use
within these territories because of unsatisfactory
conditions that prevail in China. There has
already been quoted to you the statement of
Sir John Jordan, to the effect that he could not
believe that the Powers of the West would be
willing to shelter themselves behind the plea
that they were absolved from performing their
part of the obligations assumed by them under the
Hague Convention because of disordered condi-
tions in countries like China, Persia and Turkey.
Mr. President, I do not desire to-day to
quote to you and the members of the Confe-
rence too many passages from the Minutes of
the Advisory Committee, but, in view of the
fact that some members joined this Conference
late and have not had the time to consult
those Minutes, perhaps I might be permitted
to quote one only.
I am about to quote a passage from the Minutes
of the fourth session of that Committee, page 41;
?Sir John Jordan, replying to Mr. Camp-
bell?s remarks at the previous meeting, said
that he had no intention of criticising the
internal administration of the opium pro-
blem in India.
Mr. Campbell had assured the Committee
once more that the Indian Government would
never undertake the suppression of opium in
India. The Assembly had sanctioned this
decision, and he did not desire to question its
wisdom. He only referred to India as a pro-
ducing and exporting country. Turkey, Persia
and India were the three principal producing
and exporting countries. He hoped that both
Turkey and-Persia would be represented
at the next session of the Committee, and
he suggested that the three countries might
come to an understanding to reduce pro-
portionally their present exports of opium
to the Far Eastern possessions of European
Powers. His suggestion struck at the root
of the whole question, i.e., at production.
The Committee had always interpreted the
Hague Convention in the sense that that
instrument placed no limitation on the
production of raw opium, while another of
its clauses provided for the gradual and
effective suppression of prepared opium.
India or Persia could not, under the terms
of the Convention, export prepared opium,
but they could export without limit raw
opium to Ceylon, Singapore, or to any other
place, where it was all converted into pre-
pared opium. This was, in his opinion, an
absurd position. There seemed to be a
joker in the Convention pack of cards. For
this reason, he had frequently impressed
upon the Committee that the limitation
of production was the only real solution.
?Mr. Campbell had shown that there had
been a reduction of exports to two out of
seven or eight Far Eastern possessions.
In Singapore, on the other hand, there had
been an increase in the years 1918-1920.
Since 1918, the consumption in the Fede-
rated Malay States had remained constant.
It was the same in Siam. The reduction
in Hong-Kong was more apparent than
real, since Indian opium had there been
supplanted to some extent by Chinese
opium, and Persian opium had elsewhere
taken the place of Indian.
?It was quite true that the Indian Govern-
ment did not export a single ounce of
opium to a country which did not ask for
it. The Committee, however, must remem-
ber that the Far Eastern possessions of
European Powers were not in the position
of self-governing countries. They were
Crown colonies ruled by Governments in
Europe, and the responsibility for what
happened attached to those Governments.
This reponsibility was all the greater
because the people concerned were not
nationals of the countries holding Far
Eastern possessions but were Chinese settlers
who carried back the habit to China.
?One thing was quite clear : whatever
the amount of opium produced it would all
be consumed. The amount produced was
the amount consumed, and unless produc-
tion was reduced the problem would never


be solved. His opinion was based on expe-
rience. He had dealt with the problem
in China for ten years from 1907-1917.
In China, during that period, the question
had been attacked from the standpoint of
production. Consumption had been consi-
dered a secondary question. The Com-
mittee had reversed this procedure. For
ten years production was gradually reduced
in China, and had been, in the end, prac-
tically suppressed. Despite the present
very disturbed state in China, most of the
reform which had been accomplished by
1917 still remained. The International
Opium Association at Peking went so far
as to say nine-tenths of it. In his own
opinion, at least three-quarters of it
remained. The reduction, therefore, in
China was far greater in proportion than the
reduction in the Eastern possessions of
other Powers, and that meant that the
overseas Chinese that was to say, the Chi-
nese living under Western rule-?were in a
far worse position as regards opium than
the Chinese living in their own country.
This was not to the credit of the Western
countries concerned.?
Such are the words of Sir John Jordan.
So much for the plea of confession and
avoidance which the British delegation has
presented.
The United States delegation, as you have
heard, has sought to meet, as far as possible,
the wishes of the Governments of the Powers
with Far Eastern possessions by agreeing to
modify its original proposal to the extent of
extending from ten to fifteen years the period
during which those Powers are to bring about
that effective suppression of the legalised use
of prepared opium which is promised in the
Hague Convention. To such a liberal proposi-
tion as this there would seem to be no reasonable
ground for objection, and I urge, in the most
solemn manner, that it be accepted. The pos-
sible consequences of a rejection of it will be
most serious in character, and of these possible
consequences I feel constrained to speak.
The general problem with which this Confe-
rence has to deal would be one of great impor-
tance even if it were regarded simply as a
matter of securing a more effective regulation
of the traffic in narcotic drugs and the control
of tho production of the raw material out of
which these drugs are manufactured. But,
when viewed in its larger aspects, the problem
is seen to be a far greater one, for, by necessity,
it involves the great question whether the
Governments of the world have reached that
degree of enlightenment and that stage of
ethical development which enable them to deter-
mine their policy by principles of justice and
right, and which dispose them to sacrifice imme-
diate and sordid interests in order that the
ultimate welfare of humanity may be secured.
Co-operation between sovereign Powers is
possible only when these Powers are willing
to sacrifice their own selfish interests in order
that some larger and more general good may be
achieved. The results reached by this Confe-
rence will show whether this stage of interna-
tionalism has been reached. There have been
other Conferences assembled at the invitation
and under the auspices of the League of Nations,
but, in one respect, the one in which we are
now gathered exceeds in significance those that
have preceded it. This special significance is
due to the fact that we have to deal with a
problem which is essentially a moral one. It
has political implications only in so far as the
confidence in the good-will of Governments
will be judged by what they do here ; it has
economic or financial aspects only in so far as
there are vested interests which will profit by
a continuance of the evil which this Conference
has been convened to abolish.
It is not necessary for me to speak of the moral
aspects of our problem. They speak for them-
selves. It is upon some other broader aspects
of it that I wish, for a moment, to dwell.
Of one thing we may be sure, and that is, that,
should we fail in the task that has been assigned
to us, those Powers which, by their refusal to
subordinate materialistic and sordid conside-
rations to ethical obligations, cause this failure
will be held responsible by the other nations
of the world. They will be regarded as nations
which have not yet moralised their public
policies. They will, therefore, have to pay a
heavy price for whatever immediate or mate-
rialistic interests they manage to conserve
to themselves, and it is not unlikely that this
price will be measured not only in terms of
moral prestige but also in terms of those very
financial and economic interests upon which
they will have shown that they set such store.
As to these possibilities, in so far as they
relate to the future relations between the four
hundred millions of Chinese and the Western
Powers that possess territories in the Far East,
I am, perhaps, being myself a Chinese, in a better
position to speak than most of you, and, there-
fore, to these possibilities I feel myself jus-
tified in calling your attention.
Among the features which have specially
characterised traditional Chinese thought and
civilisation, two have stood out with especial
clearness. One of these has been the emphasis
that has been laid upon the moral aspects of
life. Until recently, indeed, almost the whole
purpose of the Chinese educational system was
the inculcation of the ethical duties of man.
The other feature has been the extent to which
the Chinese people have relied upon reason
rather than upon force, with the result that
the Chinese Government, even when nominally
autocratic, has depended, in order to obtain
obedience to its laws, rather upon persuasion
than upon compulsion, and, therefore, has
promulgated its laws in hortatory rather than
mandatory form.
I speak of these matters because they have
become ingrained in the Chinese people, and,
therefore, should they become convinced that
certain of the Western Powers are not disposed
to have regard for the moral and physical
welfare of the hundreds of thousands of their
fellow-countrymen dwelling within their Far
Eastern possessions, and do in fact unjustly
discriminate between them and their own
subjects or citizens, they, the Chinese in China,
will be moved by a profound moral indignation.
Instances of the results to trade and com-
merce, not to speak of other less material but
more important consequences, that have followed
within recent years from a sense, upon the part
of the Chinese people, of right outraged will
occur to you all. They indicate to you what
may result should my people find that certain
of the Western Powers are determined to


continue to derive large public revenues from
the sale of prepared opium to Chinese living
in their Far Eastern possessions, or from the
exportation to those possessions of the raw
opium from which the prepared opium is to
be manufactured.
I do not wish to dwell too much upon the
economic or commercial consequences that
may possibly result from the action that the
Powers may take in this Conference, but it
is a phase of our problem that cannot be wholly
ignored. The significance of the trade of
China to the other trading nations of the world
needs no emphasis by me. Only a few days
ago in the London Times of January 3rd, 1925,
there appeared a message from its own Peking
correspondent in which it was pointed out that,
although the year just ended had been, for
China, one of the most troublous in her history,
the Customs duties collected had exceeded,
by over six million taels, all previous records,
and that the total duties collected had repre-
sented a foreign trade of more than two hundred
million pounds, of which something like forty
per cent had been British.
The recent strikes of sailors and workmen
in Hong-Kong and Shameen show that Chinese
labourers are rapidly grouping themselves into
effective unions, and thus are able, upon occa-
sion, to exert an influence that cannot be
lightly regarded. I would also recall to your
memory the evidence contained in the address
made to the Conference by Mr. T. Z. Koo, and
in other communications to which I have had
occasion to refer, as to the enormous interest
that the Chinese people are taking in the whole
opium question, and the anxiety with which
they are watching the procedure of this Confe-
rence. This means that if they feel that they
have cause for indignation at the position taken
by any of the Powers in this Conference, that
indignation may lead to popular movements
which the authorities might find it difficult to
counteract, much as they might desire to do so,
and which will have an influence upon the trade
of the countries concerned, and also upon the
free flow of labourers to the Far Eastern pos-
sessions of the European Powers.
I gladly leave, however, these materialistic
implications of our problem and turn to a phase
of it which, because more cultural or spiritual
in character, is of still greater importance.
This aspect of the question has to do with the
future relations of the Eastern and Western
peoples.
For many years past, the peoples of the West
have proceeded upon the conviction that their
civilisation, and especially their religions and
the codes of morality founded upon them, are
superior to the systems of thought and conduct
of the East. Based upon this assumption, the
peoples of the West, encouraged and supported
in many instances by their Governments, have
sought by educational propaganda and mis-
sionary effort to persuade the Orientals to accept
the Western ideas and ideals in place of those
of their own.
I shall not attempt to discuss how far this
conviction upon the part of the Western peoples
has a firm foundation of fact, but this
much can certainly be said, that, whatever be
the opinion held upon these points, a princi-
ple of right and justice to the Oriental as to
the Occidental, must, from its very nature,
be as valid when applied in the East as when
applied in the West. Hence it must result that
if, when put to the practical test, it be found
that Western Powers, which claim to enjoy
the benefits of Western civilisation carried
to its highest point of development, are deter-
mined to continue indefinitely in their Far
Eastern possessions a traffic which admittedly
debauches the hundreds of thousands of Chinese
who dwell in their possessions, there can be
but one result ; not only will Western
systems of ethics be deprived of much of the
respect which they command from the peoples
of the East, but the Governments of the West
will lose somewhat the regard which they now
enjoy in Eastern Asia. By this 1 mean that
it will henceforth be more difficult for them to
convince the Powers of the East of the sincerity
of their professions of good-will.
It may be thought by some of you that I
have unduly trespassed upon your time by
speaking at such length. But I ask you to
believe that I have been moved by a strong
conviction of the profound importance of the
matters which I have brought to your attention.
Having this conviction, I have felt that I could
not do otherwise than I have done in urging
that the problem with which we are attempting
to deal should be considered not only in its
immediate and obvious aspects, but also in its
broader and ultimate implications.
For these reasons, I earnestly appeal to my
colleagues to agree to refer the American pro-
posal without further hesitation to a special
Sub-Committee for discussion and action, and
subsequent report of its conclusions to this
Conference. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : Mr. Mac White, delegate of
the Irish Free State, will address the Conference.
SVIr. Mac White (Irish Free State)
Mr. President and fellow delegates, when this
motion came before us last month I had some
scruples about intervening in the debate as
we were then assured by some of the delegates
who took part in the First Conference that
a Convention had been adopted which was
worthy of merit and which, in the course of a
day or two, would receive its baptismal cer-
tificate bearing the signatures of the represen-
tatives of those Powers which participated in
its framing.
Six weeks have since gone by, during which
time I have hae ample opportunity of studying
this Convention, which has not yet been signed.
It does not require a high degree of intellectual
acumen to realise that it lays no flloral tributes on
the altar of the ideal, neither does it introduce any
radical or revolutionary change into the exist-
ing order of things, nor does it adversely
affect the material advantages that many of
the interested Powers derive from the opium
traffic. It certainly marks no satisfactory
progress. That is why my scruples have been
dissipated and why, to-day, I feel it my duty
to support the proposal of the ETrited States
delegation so that some practical measures may
be devised for the gradual suppression of the
traffic in prepared opium.
In this respect, Japan has already given us
a praiseworthy example. From the statistics
which were laid before us by the Japanese
delegation, we can see how effective and success-
ful are the steps which were taken by the


Governor of Formosa in combating the narcotic in face of the present difficulty, but lam afraid
drug evil which was decimating the inhabitants
of that island. Our congratulations are due
to Japan and to the Governor of Formosa,
who, I am happy to say, is one of our colleagues
at this Conference, more especially as Japan did
not wait for the moral pressure of an international
convention before she set her hand to this
great humanitarian work. She has given a
lead to some of the Powers of the Occident,
which I trust they will not be slow in
following.
I do not want to criticise the First Conference
or its work. I cannot, however, be blind
to the result of that work. Neither can I
remain indifferent to the fact that the ground
for both the First and the Second Conference
was badly prepared a fact which I attribute
not to the Advisory Committee but to those
who are responsible for the composition of
that body.
If, as a result of our post-war economic
conditions, in order to combat the high cost
of living, a municipality appointed a Committee
of Master Bakers to fix the price of bread, the
latter could scarcely be blamed, however
honest they may be, if they put their own inte-
rests first.
I admit that in the present case there were
extenuating circumstances and I do not deny
the right of countries principally concerned in
the traffic in opium and coca leaves to adequate
representation, but countries having higher and
holier interests at stake the interests of
mankind in general should be equally repre-
sented. Furthermore, it is apparent to all
that the holding of two Conferences for tackling
the narcotic drug evil was a mistake, which
is responsible for some of the difficulties with
which we are confronted to-day.
In view, however, of the situation created by
the failure of the First Conference, it would be
nothing less than farcical for us to continue
building an edifice on a foundation that has
already sapped. We must examine this diffi-
culty from the bed-rock up, for in no other way
can we emancipate the millions who are now
victims or prospective victims of the narcotic
drug evil. We want all doors thrown open
so that the light of day may simplify our work,
for, up to the present, some of us at all events
have been given the impression that something
is being kept in the dark and that efforts were
being made to thwart free and wholesome
discussion.
If we allow technical or legal quibbles to
stand in our path, the position of the Second
Opium Conference will become just as farcical
as that of the First, and the League of Nations,
under whose auspices we are here assembled,
cannot escape some of the odium that will
inevitably fall on the shoulders of those pri-
marily responsible for such a result.
Because I wish to raise the moral prestige of
the League and to fortify in every sphere the
policy for which the League stands, so that this
Conference may reach a successful issue, I
repeat, that to seek refuge in diplomatic subtle-
ties and legal technicalities on the present occa-
sion would be to show a lack of statesmanship
which would earn for the delegates to this
Conference the scorn and contempt of future
generations.
1 am not here to judge or to contemm the
motives of those who employ negative tactics
there are some who do not realise what the
heart of the problem is. Their thoughts are
perhaps lurking in a past when the calculation
was always of national advantage, and they
have not yet come to see the light of day
when men are thinking of the common advan-
tage and safety of mankind. Negations are not
going to construct the policies of the future,
neither will they help us to bring this Conference
to a happy and fruitful issue. It is next to
impossible, however, to make progress in face
of the nations who say ; ?We won't play?. The
pursuit of such a policy would not only impede
the onward march of our civilisation but it
would throw the world back again into the
obscurity of mediaeval night.
In bringing forward its proposal, the dele-
gation of the United States has not only done
a good day?s work for the great moral principles
upon which our civilisation is founded, but it
has done a good day s work for the Teague of
Nations. According to the late President Wil-
son, the League of Nations revolutionised
international law by putting morals into it.
Nobody can deny that the presence here of
representatives of the United States Govern-
ment has had a very salubrious and highly
moral effect on this Conference. Without them,
it would already have been classified in the
limbo of forgotten things. We have further
reason to be grateful to them when we look
around and see the distinguished statesmen
who have come, even at this eleventh hour,
to help us out of the morass in which the
Conference has been floundering. This is a
happy omen from which we begin to realise
that the Great Powers of Europe have been
awakened to the importance of the problem
which we have been called upon to solve.
I need make no apology for stating that what
the United States have achieved by co-ope-
rating with the League in the field of humani-
tarian endeavour they can more effectually
achieve by extending that co-operation to
the economic and political domain. That,
however, is for the people of the United States
and not for us to decide.
At our last meeting in December, one of our
colleagues told us that if the United States
proposition were adopted, a situation would
arise which was without precedent in the history
of international conferences. Ido not think
we fear such a situation. I, for one, gladly
welcome it. The whole fabric of international
law, such as it is to-day, has been laboriously
constructed from the alpha to the omega by
the creation of precedents.
The Covenant of the League of Nations is a
document unique in the history of the world,
and principles were written into it which were
never written into any great- international
agreement before. Matters were drawn into
it which affected the peace and happiness of
the whole Continent of Europe, of forlorn
populations in Africa and of peoples in Asia
of whom we have hardly heard. It was because
of the unprecedented precedents created by
the Peace Conference in writing Article 23 into
the Covenant that we are assembled here to-day.
If the pioneers of our civilisation had been
waiting for the creation of precedents before
proceeding with their work, there would be
no need to hold Opium Conferences, for mankind
would not yet have emerged from the darkness


of the palaeolithic age. Instead of appealing
to precedents, let us divorce ourselves for a
moment from the worn-out arguments of another
age and join hands in an appeal to common sense.
For, though not expressly mentioned in our
legal text-books, it has settled many a thorny
problem in the past, and there is little like-
lihood of its being disdained in the future.
If we look again at Resolution VI of the
fourth Assembly through our commonsense
glasses, we shall read therein that the Council
is requested, amongst other things, ?as a
means of giving effect to the principles sub-
mitted by the representatives of the United
States of America and to the policy which
the League has adopted??, to summon a Confe-
rence with a view to the conclusion of an agree-
ment on the subject for which we have been
called together. How in the name of Provi-
dence can we give effect to those principles
unless we have an opportunity of discussing
them ? Our duty in the matter is clear. We
can only give effect to the American principles
by voting for the proposition before the Chair.
By doing so, we are well within our terms of
reference and we shall merit, not only the appro-
val of the Assembly and the Council of the
League of Nations, but of the many millions of
our fellow creatures in the Orient as in the
Occident who eagerly await the result of
our deliberations. ( Loud applause.)
The President
Translation : Ladies and gentlemen, there
are still four delegates down to speak and I
understand that two of them the first cer-
tainly wish to make fairly long speeches.
I think, therefore, that, as the plenary meetings
have lasted for five and a-half hours to-day,
I shall be interpreting the general feeling if
I adjourn our work until to-morrow.
The next meeting of the Conference will take
place to-morrow, Wednesday, at 10.30 a.m.

THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE UNITED

UNITED STATES OF AMERICA : CON-
TINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
The President
Translation : The discussion is open.
I call upon the first delegate of the British
Empire, Viscount Cecil, to address the Con-
ference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I have
addressed a good many international gatherings
during the last four or five years, but I do not
recollect any occasion on which I have risen
to speak with a greater and more urgent sense
of responsibility than on the present occasion.
I cannot conceal from myself the fact that
the position of this Conference is critical and
that it has not become less critical in the last
day or two. In consequence, lam well aware
that even a casual and unintended expression
on my part may produce results which I should
be the first to deplore. I therefore beg my col-
leagues on this Conference to extend to me their
utmost assistance and good-will and to do
their best to construe what I have to say in
the most favourable light and to believe that
what I say is said under an imperative sense of
duty and with the greatest possible desire to
bring the work of this Conference to a successful
issue.
Compliments and an appreciation of the
idealism which actuates the United States
delegation have been paid to that delegation,
and I entirely agree with everything that has
been said. I recognise its deep sincerity and
its anxiety to achieve serious and important
results. I have never joined I hope I shall


never join in the thoughtless gibes that
are sometimes levelled at the American people.
I have had the great honour and privilege of
visiting their country and I have been received
with the utmost kindness by every class and
by every section of the American people with
whom I have come in contact. I should be
both stupid and ungrateful if I did not recognise
to the full their splendid qualities and their
anxiety to do what they believe to be right,
an anxiety which, I believe, is second to that of
no other nation in the world.
If, then, I venture on the present occasion
to make some criticism, and even, if I may be
permitted to do so, to utter some warning, I
trust it will be understood that it is with a pro-
found sense of the many great qualities of that
people and without the slightest intention to
say anything that could possibly wound or hurt
their sensibilities or those of their Government.
Let me begin with a very deeply felt warning.
I have sometimes been called by critics an
idealist and I have always welcomed the charge
as a great compliment ; but Ido recognise that
what my critics really mean is that I am too
prone to be guided by aspirations and senti-
ments, however noble, without sufficient regard
to the practical considerations which must go-
vern all our actions in this world.
I hope that that charge is untrue in my case,
but I recognise that, if it is true, it is a serious
charge, because idealism of that description
not only does no good but is apt to bring
discredit upon the cause in which it is engaged.
I say this because I most earnestly desire every
member of the Conference to believe that the
British Government in general, and myself in
particular, are as anxious, as burningly anxious,
to put an end to the evils of the opium traffic
whether it is connected with smoking or the
far more serious evil of drug addiction as
any nation and as any person can be in the
whole world.
If we have felt compelled to take up an attitude
which is inconsistent with, and opposed to,
what are known as the American suggestions,
it is solely and entirely because we believe that
those suggestions would not accomplish the
object that they have in view, would not
diminish the evil that they are intended to
combat, and might even increase and make
more serious that evil. We may, of course, be
mistaken. Ido not pretend that we are infal-
lible or that anybody else is infallible. That
is the honest, sincere and definite belief of the
British Government, of which I am the repre-
sentative, and I ask that the same courtesy
which in international gatherings has always
been extended, as far as my experience goes,
to the declarations of any Government may be
extended now to my Government.
What are the broad lines of our case ? They
are very simple. We believe that simply to
cut off from these districts the supply of
what has been called Government opium, unless
at the same time, and as part of the reform,
action is taken regarding smuggled opium, will
be of no value whatever, will merely increase the
profits of the smugglers and urge them to still
greater exertions, which may easily result
not in diminishing the amount of opium that
is consumed in these districts but in actually
increasing it.
Such are the broad outlines of the case that
we submit, and it is based, as I venture very
respectfully to think, on solid ground. It is
the result of the absolutely unanimous advice
that we have received, and other Govern-
ments in a similar position have received, I
gather, from their experts. We have no reason
whatever to doubt the complete good faith, and
no one can doubt the knowledge and skill of
those experts. We are bound, unless we see
strong reason to doubt it, to accept their
advice. And so far from seeing any strong
reason to doubt that advice, we feel that all
the attendant facts and circumstances that
have been brought to our knowledge confirm it.
Unquestionably, there is a vast production
of opium going on. Ido not want to use any
figures which may be disputed. I see in looking
over my last observations that I used the
figure of 15,000 tons. It has since been brought
to my notice that that figure is not accepted by
the representatives of the Chinese Government.
Ido not wish to insist on it. I quite recognise
that these are matters of speculation and that
it is impossible to tell how much is produced.
It may well be that the figure of 15,000 tons is
an exaggeration, and I earnestly trust that it is.
As far as I am concerned, I wish to assure
the Chinese delegation that I merely used that
figure because it was the only one that I
happened to have come across. If the Chinese
delegation has any objection to it, I hasten to
say, as I would say to any other Government
that objected to anything that I said, that of
course I do not insist on that figure. I only
used it as an illustration of what everyone
admits: that, unfortunately, there is at present
a vast production of opium in the territories
of the great Chinese Empire, contrary to the
wishes and contrary to the efforts of the Central
Government. All that opium thus produced
is, let me remind the Conference, used for smok-
ing ; it is not used for the production of
drugs ; it is not used for eating ; it is all
used, or almost all, for smoking. This, at
least, is the information which I have received.
Then there is the actual geographical position,
which must be taken into account. We in our
territories are unfortunately or fortunately
actually touching or in the close neighbourhood
of this great production. As regards Hong-
Kong, for instance, which, as you know, is an
island just close to the coast of China, there is
a constant flow of population to and from the
mainland, and for all geographical purposes
the island is almost or quite a part of the main-
land itself.
Malaya, the other most important of our
Far Eastern possessions, is further removed,
but it has a coast-line of some 1,230 miles, inter-
sected very frequently by creeks and rivers,
a coast-line which, even if the whole country
were completely settled and under the most
highly centralised and civilised form of Govern-
ment, it would be almost impossible to watch,
and which, under the existing circumstances,
since the country is very largely unsettled at
present, it is impossible adequately to guard.
The next fact which the British Government
had to consider was that in the few years that
immediately followed the acceptance by Great
Britain of the principles of the Hague Conven-
tion of 1912 (before, indeed, it had become a
definite part of the international legislation on
the subject by the Treaty of 1920), when the
British Government was acting fully in the
spirit of that Convention, a very large amount


of success was achieved. The opium-smoking
evil was very considerably reduced in conse-
quence of those efforts. I purposely do not
trouble the Conference with detailed figures.
It was only coincidently with the great recru-
descence of the growth of the poppy in China
that this desirable result appeared to receive a
serious check.
Again, there are the actual figures as regards
smuggling. Of course, we can only obtain
figures which result from actual seizures. I
cannot give nobody can give the complete
figures as to the amount of successful undetected
smuggling which goes on, but the figures of de-
tected smuggling, the actual seizures, are serious
enough.
I see that in Malaya, in 1923, 229 steamers
coming from China with opium on board
were seized. There was a certain numbei of
other steamers, about 36, but in practically
every case, with the most insignificant excep-
tions, the opium seized was Chinese opium.
In the first eight months of 1924 this figure of
229 steamers had increased to 345- You will
observe a great increase a very large amount
in itself and a great increase almost double,
allowing for the eight months of 1924*
the smuggling which took place in 1924 as
compared with 1923- What does that mean ?
It means, unfortunately, that in spite of the
utmost efforts and the utmost efforts have
been made, for there was every reason to
do everything possible to stop this smuggling
in spite of those efforts, smuggling is so
prosperous and so lucrative that it has greatly
increased and is greatly increasing. This fact
indicates that, apart from the seizures which
have been made, a very considerable quantity
of opium gets through and reaches its unhappy
victims.
As regards Hong-Kong, the figures are even
more striking. The total yearly consumption
of what is called Government opium in Hong-
Kong is about 22 y 2 tons. A single smuggling
syndicate was recently discovered to be ope-
rating in Hong-Kong. Its premises were raided,
its books were seized and examined, and it was
found that that single syndicate, in the course
of a year, had been importing smuggled opium
which was equal in amount to the total amount
of the Government opium consumed. Of course,
that means that other syndicates and there
are a great many people engaged in this illicit
traffic were also importing large quantities.
The official estimate (which seems to me, I
confess, bringing such common sense as I have
to bear upon the matter, a very conservative
estimate) is that not less than twice that quan-
tity of smuggled opium was imported. That
is to say, for every ounce of opium which ori-
ginates from Government sources not less than
two smuggled ounces originate from other
sources. Of course, all this opium is Chinese
opium. That fact is not surprising if we take
into consideration the conditions of life in Hong-
Kong, where an immense floating population
passes to and fro from the island to the mainland.
I have seen it stated this as many as 15,000
or 16,000 persons pass to and fro every day,
and I can easily believe it.
Anyone who has been to Hong-Kong and
seen that vast port, one of the greatest ports
in the world, operated entirely by Chinese
labour (the number of other nationals in Hong-
Kong is always negligible), will realise that the
great flow of industrial persons from the main-
land to the island must be enormous, Under
those conditions, it is obvious that when dealing
with an article like opium, which we have heard
on all hands is so easily sold, it is almost impos-
sible to combat the contraband traffic unless it can
be cut off at the source, namely, at the point
of production. This was another factor which
the British Government had to take into conside-
ration.
There is yet another matter which I am
sure the experts of the British Government have
considered ? I cannot say that I had until I came
here, as I did not know anything it and that
is the result of the early experiments which
have been carried out on the lines now recom-
mended by the American delegation. I do not
know, but I understood from what Mr. Porter
siad yesterday that the experiments began by a
decision of President Roosevelt. President
Roosevelt went out of office in 1912, I think.
I may be wrong about the exact date and, if so,
I hope I shall be corrected. I presume, however,
that the experiment began somewhere about
that date. Ido not know whether lam right
on that point.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America)
It was 1905 or 1906, I think.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
I accept everything you tell me. lam most
anxious only to make a statement if it is accurate.
1 am told that the experiment was begun in
1906 or somewhere about that date, nearly
twenty years ago. Absolute prohibition has
been in operation for twenty years, not ten
years, and Mr. Porter very candidly and fairly
said that, though he thought it had produced
a very good result, he was bound to say that
even in that period, and enforced as it was by
the United States Government, it had not, so
far, been completely successful. The figures
he was able to give us I do not complain at
all went no further than 1922. We have
no ground, at any rate, for saying that the
experiment has been more successful during the
last two years.
Such is the result of this experiment, and,
of course, the geographical situation of the
Philippines is entirely different from that of
Hong-Kong. The Philippines are further from
the source of the opium production, and there is
not, of course, a tithe of the facilities for smug-
gling there which exist in the case of Hong-
Kong. . , ? A
We all listened, with great admiration and
interest, to the very striking speech made by
one of the delegates of Japan. He did not
give us the details I am not complaining
but he told us that an experiment on those lines,
if I understood him rightly again I ask foi
correction if I am in any way mis-stating what
he said had been tried in Kwantung and that
the Japanese Government was not satisfied
with the success of that experiment.
Again, we had the statement of the delegate
of India, Mr. Clayton, a very interesting speech
explaining what had happened in Burma.
Whatever may be said about the British
Government, no one who has any sense of
fairness can doubt that the most determined
efforts have been made to put a stop to opium-
smoking in Burma, and with very great success


indeed, taking Burma as a whole. But what
did he tell us ? He said that the efforts made
and the measures taken were very successful
in those parts of Burma which, by their geo-
graphical situation, were not exposed seriously
to the danger of smuggling; they were too
far removed. The country is very difficult for
travel, as a good many of you know, and the
southern part of Burma is a long way from the
Chinese frontier. But the delegate of India
has told us that in the northern part, near
the Chinese frontier, the efforts of the Indian
Government had been unsuccessful, because
it had not been found possible to cope with the
smuggling, which was so rife there that it
had entirely obliterated the efforts made to
reduce the opium-smoking.
I venture very respectfully to ask my collea-
gues on the Conference to consider all these
facts. I think that each one of them is impor-
tant and worthy of consideration, and I venture
to think that the accumulative effect of them is
enormous. I approached this question with
the great disadvantage of knowing very little
about it, but with the great advantage of being,
as I honestly believe, entirely unprejudiced
in the matter. It was only about a fortnight
ago that I returned from America, and up to
that time I had no idea that I was going to be
asked to take part in this Conference.
I have no parti pris at all in favour of, or
against, the American proposal. I confess,
however, that when I came to consider all these
arguments and all the circumstances of the
case, I could not refuse, and I do not see how
any reasonable man could refuse, to admit that
the strength of the case against the American
proposal was very, very great. It is only
too probable that those who opposed it were
right when they said that it would do no good
and that the only result of it would be to
increase the profits of those who lived by the
very disreputable trade of opium-smuggling.
I wish I could leave the matter there, but
I am bound to refer to the way in which these
arguments were disposed of by the delegate of
the United States. He swept them aside. My
hearing may have been defective, but I did
not hear any attempt to deal with any one of
them. They were merely dismissed and, instead
of dealing with them, the delegate of the United
States confined himself to making and
in the plainest language he said it a charge
against the British and other Governments,
that were unable to accept the American point
of view. The charge he made was that, in
the first place, they had altogether disregarded
the international obligation they had accepted
under the Hague Convention, that is to say,
that the pledged word of the British Government
had been treated like a scrap of paper and that
its new suggestion, or rather the declaration
which I was empowered to make, urging a
different method of dealing with the problem,
was not an honest and sincere proposal for
dealing with this great evil, but was merely
an attempt to avoid our obligations.
I am very sorry to have to say it, but I am
sure that the Conference will see that a member
of a self-respecting country cannot allow such
charges to be made in an international gathe-
ring without repudiating them. It was also
alleged that this disregard of our obligation and
proposed evasion were motived by financial
considerations Government administrative
financial considerations of a sordid description.
Such is the charge, and I am sure that I am
not exaggerating when I say and I imagine
that 1 shall have the sympathy of other Govern-
ments which are in the same position as the
British Government that such a charge can
only be regarded as very wounding indeed.
I have tried to imagine what such a charge
would look like if it were made between
private individuals. Suppose somebody came
to me and said : ?We had a contract to fulfil,
an object which we both professed to have at
heart, and you entered into certain obligations.
We negotiated for that and now we want to
enter into a further contract?. Suppose that
I replied ; ?Well, your contract may have
merit, but I do not think it will succeed, and
I suggest to you an alternative method of
dealing with the matter? ; and thereupon the
negotiator said ; ?Oh ! that is because you
have always ignored your obligations under the
previous contract, and you are now anxious to
evade them completely by a new contract which
is entirely illusory. The reason why you are
anxious to do this is some pecuniary consi-
deration of a not very respectable kind?.
I may be unduly sensitive, but if an individual
negotiating with me in a private matter were
to use language of that kind I should take up my
hat and leave the room and I should decline to
have anythingfurther to do with the negotiations.
I am certainly not going to advise my Govern-
ment to take any such course in reference to
the present position, because I consider that,
however hurt we may feel and we are deeply
hurt by these charges, we have no right to
allow national feeling and national reputation
and national honour to stand in the way
of trying to do something to forward the great
task of fighting against this opium evil and
protecting the many hundreds of thousands
of people who are its victims. I must say,
however, with the greatest respect, that to
me, at any rate, it is just as wounding to have
a charge of that kind made against my country
as if the charge had been made against me
personally.
I hesitate to elaborate what was said, but
the Conference will remember that, on behalf
of the British Government, I made a certain
declaration of policy. I thought it was right
to do that, in order to remove the slightest
excuse for any doubt as to the complete good
faith of the British Government. It was received
by a criticism of the most meticulous cha-
racter, suggesting that it was a complete fraud
(in very slightly veiled language) and that it
was subtly phrased (I remember that that
was one of the adjectives used) and that its
only purpose was to suspend and help us to get
out of the obligations of the Hague Convention
and to make the position worse than it was before
the declaration had been made.
That line of criticism ignored altogether the
fact that, in putting forward that declaration, I
said, in the most emphatic and explicit lan-
guage that was at my command, that the Bri-
tish Government recognised to the full its
obligations under the Hague Convention, that it
was determined to carry them out, and that this
proposal, this suggestion, this declaration
call it what you will was made, not with a
view to diminishing our obligations in any way,
but merely in order to point out one method
by which we thought those obligations could


be most effectively and properly fulfilled. But
I said that if there were any other methods
and there are other methods in operation
we should go on practising them to the full ;
we should do our utmost ; we should do every-
thing we could ; we should spare no expense
and no effort to carry out what we believed to
be our duty under the Hague Convention.
We tried to give a pledge of our good faith
in the matter by suggesting that, since sugges-
tions had been made that those who had been
examining this matter for us were perhaps
unconsciously biassed by national conside-
rations, we were quite ready that a Commission
should be appointed, presided over by an Ame-
rican citizen to be chosen by the Council of the
League of Nations, to examine the matter, not
to suspend what we were doing, not to delay
what we were doing under the Hague Conven-
tion, but to tell us, if so it might be,
what further might usefully be done in order
to carry out those obligations.
I confess I do not see how a Government could
give a greater proof of its good-will than by
making that offer. How was it received ?
It was received simply as a deliberate attempt
to evade our obligations and to suspend them,
so that we should no longer feel ourselves bound
to do anything until the Commission had
reported.
I am afraid I have spoken, as I did not intend
to do, with some warmth. I hope my collea-
gues, and even my American colleagues, will
pardon me. I hope they will consider how
they would feel if, in an important international
gathering, a charge, such as that which has been
made against my Government, had been made
against theirs. I earnestly trust that, if I
have spoken with warmth, it may be understood
that it is not due to anything except my
feeling that I should not be discharging my
duty as a British citizen, much less as a British
Minister, if I did not take the earliest possible
opportunity to repudiate, in the most emphatic
language at my command, the very grave charge
that has been made against my country.
I have one word to add, and then I will pass,
if I may, from that aspect of the question. I
am constrained to make this further observa-
tion. I told the Conference that I had atten-
ded a great many international gatherings here
and elsewhere, but particularly at Geneva.
The thing that has struck me most perhaps
among all the achievements and I myself
regard them as very remarkable of the League
of Nations at Geneva has been the creation of
what has been well called the Geneva atmosphere.
There has been no greater achievement than
the creation of this atmosphere. What is the
Geneva atmosphere ? If I understand it, it
is this : That all who take part in gatherings,
which are ruled by that atmosphere, take part
in them with one desire and one desire only ;
to reach an agreement in furtherance of the
cause for which the gathering has been sum-
moned. There is no idea of national victory.
National interest is, as far as it is possible for
human beings to do it, put on one side in those
gatherings, and the one object of those
who have come together has been to reach an
agreement a fair, honest and straightforward
agreement regarding the cause which they
have in hand.
I believe that this is very largely true. I
have seen the most thorny and difficult
questions discussed. I have seen those questions
solved and an agreement reached with no
trace of bitterness left by the discussion.
There has been no symptom of national anta-
gonism, but all have combined together to try
to find a solution of the difficulty that was laid
before them.
I believe it is only in that spirit, and by
making full allowances for one another, by
attributing to everybody who attends confe-
rences of this kind the best motives and the
most earnest desire to reach a sound and honou-
rable conclusion, that any real international
progress can be made. If it be true, as I
have heard in this room, that this Conference
has lasted many days and has not reached an
agreement, I cannot help wondering whether
one reason for that unhappy result may be
that this principle, this atmosphere, has been
lost sight of, and that we have degenerated into
a kind of recriminatory rivalry which is cer-
tainly less likely than anything else to lead to
the solution of the problems that are submitted
to us.
After all, we must recognise that agreements
between sovereign and independent States must
be agreements. We are all representatives
of sovereign and independent States. We are
none of us prepared to submit to the domination
or the dictation of others. We are all anxious
to reach a solution by agreement, not by a
majority vote ; for, believe me, in inter-
national matters majority votes will do very
little. We can only make progress by a real
agreement, making such concessions to one
another as are unavoidable, having in mind the
common object that has brought us together
and only that. It is only in that way, and in
no other possible way, that an advance can
be made.
That, as everyone who is aware of the
procedure and of the Covenant of the League
of Nations will agree, is the principle on which
the League is built. It is the contrary prin-
ciple to the super-State, the organisation which
gives orders to sovereign and independent
countries. It depends upon bringing the coun-
tries together and inducing agreement, and
not on any attempt to force countries to do that
which they honestly and sincerely believe it is
not in the interests of their people to do.
I cannot help concluding this part of my
observations by appealing to all my colleagues
to return to the Geneva atmosphere and see
whether, even at this eleventh hour, the proceed-
ings of this Conference may not be saved, and
whether real results for the advancement of
human prosperity and humanity generally
may not yet be secured if we can only try to
look at things, not only from our own point of
view, but also from the point of view of each
and all of us who are engaged in this dis-
cussion.
Finally, I now come to the actual question,
the question whether this proposal put forward
by the American delegation ought to be adopted.
I do not pretend to try to impose my view on
anybody else ; I can only state it and ask that
it shall be accepted as a perfectly honest and
sincere view. I cannot convince myself that
this matter is within the competence of this
Conference. I observed, in some of the very
interesting speeches we heard yesterday, that
there was a tendency to sweep that aside as a
merely technical and formal objection. I am


afraid I regard it as something more. lam
deeply impressed with the importance of pro-
ceeding, in international gatherings, with absolute
regularity. The general system of such
gatherings is still in its infancy, and it is very
important not to do anything which may seem to
those who take part in them likely to be
dangerous and uncertain. I think it is very
important, therefore, that we should not
attempt, whatever the motive may be, to extend
beyond onr mandate the competence of this
Conference.
It may well be 1 do not know that it
would have been a better plan if there had been,
not two Conferences, but one. I do not express
any opinion on that point. It is very likely
that it would have been better. We must,
however, take the facts as they are. The
Assembly decided to call two Conferences.
I have read and re-read those resolutions.
Again I may be quite wrong, but I cannot myself
doubt, what is said in those resolutions, that
applying the ordinary rules of construction to
the intention was that the opium-smoking
problem should be referred to one of those
Conferences, and other aspects of the opium
evil to the other Conference. That is also the
view of the Government that I represent.
It may be said, it has been said, that this is
a formal or technical matter. I cannot help
feeling that it is of great importance that in
international gatherings we should proceed
with regularity. It may be said that we are
wrong in the view we take of the meaning of
these resolutions. It may well be so. Every
sovereign and independent State is bound to
act and can only act on its view of the mandate
which it has obeyed. The British Government
came to this Conference believing, and honestly
believing, that that is the meaning of the sum-
mons. It cannot be a party to an extension
of that meaning beyond the limits to which it
believes it should fairly go. It feels very
strongly that to do so would be to import
into gatherings of this kind an irregularity
and an uncertainty which in the end might
have very serious consequences for the whole
system of international conferences. It believes
that it is of the utmost importance that nations,
when they accept an invitation to attend a
conference, may be in a position to be absolutely
certain that no attempt will be made to extend
the ambit of the Conference beyond the terms
of the invitation which has been addressed to
them.
Such is the view of my Government. It is
most anxious to find a solution of this problem.
It is most anxious that this Conference should
not separate without achieving some definite
progress. But I am bound to explain to you
the view of the British Government a view
to which I, of course, adhere upon this
point, and I beg you earnestly to believe, whe-
ther you agree with it or disagree with it, that
it is an opinion profoundly and genuinely held,
and one which I cannot, therefore, disregard
as a representative of that Government. For
my part, if any means can be found of getting
round this difficulty which lies before us, I
shall be most happy to adopt it ; but I have
not heard of any suggestion at present.
That being so, I can only say, as representing
the British Government, that I shall feel bound
to vote against the motion that is now before
the Conference. (Loud applause.)
Translation : His Excellency Jonkheer
Loudon, delegate of the Netherlands, will
address the Conference.
H.E. Jonkheer J. Loudon (Netherlands) :
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, 1 would like to reply briefly to some
of the remarks made yesterday by Mr. Porter,
first delegate of the United States.
The question I addressed to Mr. Porter with
regard to the figures for the Philippine Islands
in 1922-23 - I did not say 1924 was not
intended to throw an unfavourable light on
the position in the Philippines, but merely
to discover whether the result of the measures
adopted by the United States were still as
unsatisfactory as they were shown to be by
the figures published in 1921.
I am familiar with the speech of Bishop
Brent to which Mr. Porter referred. The infe-
rence which we drew from it was that the quan-
tity of opium confiscated in the Philippine
Islands was on an average 100 times that of the
opium imported legally, whereas in the Dutch
Indies the value of the quantities seized only
constitutes a one hundred and fifty-thousandth
part of that of the legal consumption. I
fully recognise the entire disinterestedness of
the opium policy pursued by the American
Government in the Philippine Islands, but my
point was to know whether the method employed
had succeeded, and how far it deserved to be
held up as an example for other countries to
follow.
I said, the day before yesterday, that the
measures adopted by our Government in the
Dutch Indies were not inspired by any desire
for gain. They used to be, but since the end
of last century this reproach no longer
holds good. I am therefore surprised to hear Mr.
Porter continually repeating that other coun-
tries seek financial advantages from their
opium policy. I confess that lam particularly
surprised at the disparaging terms in which he
speaks of these countries. I do not know
whether he alludes to the Dutch Indies, but,
if he places them in this category, I may, for
example, point out that, according to the
latest statistics which refer to the years from
1920 to 1923, the measures we have taken,
though they involved considerable expenditure,
have resulted in a diminution of 30 per cent in
the Government receipts from opium. This
constitutes a considerable reduction, even allow-
ing for a certain falling off in the use of opium
owing to the unrest which was then prevalent.
Mr. Porter?s accusation if I have under-
stood it aright that we do not apply the same
principles in the East as in Europe I find rather
amusing. It is quite obvious that in Europe
there is only an extremely small number of
opium-smokers, and that, happily, the measures
we apply are merely preventive in character.
My country?s legislation as regards narcotic
drugs, however, is quite as severe in the mother-
country as in the overseas colonies.
Mr. Porter also gave us his views as to the
value of treaties.
I would be the last to gainsay him on this
point, but when he accuses the signatories
of the Hague Convention of having evaded
their obligations, I must emphatically repudiate
the suggestion that my country has not done
all that lay in its power to carry them out.
The President


The statement which I have already made in
regard to our policy in the Dutch Indies proves,
on the contrary, that we have done all that was
possible in the circumstances, taking into
account the increasing contraband trade from
other countries. We are prepared to go even
further. The part played by our delegation
at the First Conference is sufficient evidence
of that. Our delegation is ready to co-operate
most energetically in the elaboration of the par-
ticularly important Agreement which this Second
Conference is preparing with a view to stamping
out the pernicious and demoralising traffic in
drugs. I think that this Agreement would have
been easy to reach if the American proposal had
not complicated matters. I do not, however,
despair. The attitude of the Netherlands to-
wards the question of competence which has
been raised here is well known to you, and, like
Viscount Cecil, I am obliged to say that I
will vote against the American proposal if it
is put to the vote.
Let us all give full reflection to this problem.
If we are all determined to solve it, we shall
succeed. But, to be quite frank, I consider
that our discussions should be abridged and,
above all, should be carried on in a less com-
bative spirit. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. Chodzko, delegate of Po-
land, will address the Conference.
IVI. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, I do not propose to go into the
details of the proposals before the Conference.
I will confine myself to referring you to my
speech of December 13th, and I merely wish to
state, on behalf of the Polish Government, that I
support the American delegation?s motion to
refer Chapter II of the American suggestions
to the competent Sub-Committee for conside-
ration, and I also support the other proposals
relating to this motion. I allude particularly
to the proposal made by the honourable dele-
gate of the British Empire.
I also welcome the conciliatory suggestions
of the Japanese delegate and I am gratified
that they have been so favourably received by
the United States delegation, because I think
that this shows the possibility of finding a
satisfactory issue from the dilemma in which
we are placed.
I sincerely trust that all the members of this
Conference will collaborate to the fullest pos-
sible extent in the work of conciliation and
mutual agreement, which is so important for the
peace and prosperity of the world. I think
that, against all appearances, the discussion
which has taken place gives us some grounds
to hope for a solution.
The President
Translation : I must ask the honourable
delegate for Poland for an explanation, as I
do not think I have quite understood his
meaning. He first refers us to his speech of
December 13th and he renews his support of
the proposal which was then being discussed. But
he adds that the proposal to which he alludes
is that of referring Chapter II to the competent
Sub-Committee. At the same time, he suggests
consideration of a British draft or declaration
and he also supports a suggestion made by
the Japanese delegation. 1 must point out;
however, that I have no proposal before me
either from the first delegate of the British
Empire or from the Japanese delegation.
I am at a loss to know exactly what the ho-
nourable Polish delegate means, since no new
proposal has been formulated but merely a
recommendation that the competence of a
Committee which has not yet been formed should
be extended.
I should therefore be glad if the honourable
Polish delegate would give me an explanation
on these points.
IV!, Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : Mr. President, I understood
that the honourable British delegate?s declara-
tion was in the nature of an amendment to the
American proposal, since it is closely related
thereto ; it deals with the same question and
indeed has already been discussed here. I
therefore supposed that it would be quite
possible to refer it to the same Committee as
considered Chapter II of the American proposal.
In the course of the discussion which has
just taken place, I gathered that the American
delegate accepted certain parts of Viscount
Cecil?s proposals. I was, therefore, under the
impression that this acceptance constituted,
an amendment.
As regards my reference to the Japanese
delegate?s proposal, I repeat that I support his
general suggestions.
The President
Translation : Have the British and Japanese
delegates any observations to make in regard to
the interpretation placed on their suggestions
by the first delegate of Poland ?
Viscount Cecil, delegate of the British Empire,
will address the Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
I am extremely sorry that the honourable
delegate for Poland misunderstood what I said,
and I am grateful to him for giving me an
opportunity of clearing up the misunderstanding,
The position of the British Government is now
what it always has been, namely, that this
Conference is not competent to deal with the
question of opium-smoking, and my Govern-
ment is therefore opposed to the American pro-
posal to refer its suggestion for dealing with
that proposal to a Sub-Committee, because such
a decision would admit that this Conference
was competent.
Nevertheless, in order to show the good faith
of the British Government and its anxiety to
make its position quite clear, I was instructed
to make a declaration of what is, in fact, the
policy of the British Government, not by way
of amendment or dealing with the American
proposal, but as a unilateral declaration.
That is the position, and I do not regard my
proposal as in any respect an amendment to
the American proposal, because I do not think,
and 1 cannot admit, that this Conference has
any competence to deal with the matter.
IVI. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : As far as the Japanese dele-
gation is concerned, I entirely accept the Polish
delegate?s interpretation and I thank him for
his sympathetic reference to my proposal.


Translation : Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh, dele-
gate of Persia, will address the Conference.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia) :
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, I have already had the honour to
put before you my Government?s point of
view in regard to the reduction of the cultiva-
tion of the poppy, the limitation of its use, and
particularly in regard to the last proposal of
the United States delegation.
I had not intended to weary the Conference
by repeating what I have already told them.
Yesterday, however, Lord Cecil and the honou-
rable delegate for China made some allusions
to Persian opium which have made it necessary
for me to add a few remarks to the general
discussion.
The thorny question of the suppression of
opium, or rather of its reduction to the strict
limits of medical and scientific needs, is not
one of yesterday. In 1909 we had the First
International Commission at Shanghai, and
in 1912 the First International Conference was
held at The Hague. Persia was represented at
both these humanitarian conferences.
For the past four years, I have had the honour
to represent my country at the League of
Nations, although not on the Advisory Com-
mittee on the Traffic in Opium and other
Dangerous Drugs. As a member of the Fifth
Committee, however, I have taken part in all
the discussions on the question of opium.
I have heard many enthusiastically applauded
speeches ; much ink has been spilt and many
fine sentiments have been pronounced. But
I think we must all admit that there is very
little to show in the way of results.
While some countries have slightly reduced
their cultivation of the poppy, others have
doubled or trebled theirs, and the evil is con-
tinually assuming more alarming proportions.
Need I say more ? Look at the statistics of
raw opium in the Far East and you will see
that, in spite of the most praiseworthy efforts,
the quantity of raw opium is on the increase.
Indo-China and China have reduced their
production of opium, but Turkestan, Bokhara,
Khiva and Turkman have trebled theirs, and
hundreds of tons of opium are sent via Siberia
and Vladivostok to Mongolia, China and the
Far East, naturally, as contraband.
1 do not make these remarks in order to dis-
courage the Conference. On the contrary, I
do so simply to point out the true facts of the
situation and to enable you to combat this
evil more effectively. In the interests of hu-
manity, I will be perfectly frank and 1 will tell
you my impressions of the debates in the Com-
mittees of the Assembly of the League of Nations.
Most of the members of these Committees
belonged to those fortunate countries where
the cultivation of the poppy is unknown and
where nobody earns a living by producing it.
It was easy for them to make eloquent speeches
and energetically to demand that the League of
Nations should control the cultivation of the
poppy and that its production should be reduced
to strictly medical and scientific needs. I appre-
ciate their efforts and I admire their concern
for the unhappy fate of the opium addicts, but,
unfortunately, their concern brought no remedy
for the evil, and the impression made by their
speeches soon evaporated.
But, in Asia, gentlemen, apart from India,
China and Persia, there are other countries
which are great producers of opium, such as
Turkey, Afganistan, Egypt, Turkestan, Bokhara,
Khiva and Turkman, which do not yet belong
to the League of Nations and were not repre-
sented on the Opium Committees. In my
opinion, it is most important that the opinion
of the opium-producing countries should be
asked at all Committees and Conferences deal-
ing with the opium question. The represen-
tative of Persia was present at all the Committees
but no one asked him what was the position
of his country in relation to this thorny ques-
tion or how they could help Persia out of her
difficulties. The only question that was asked
was why Persia did not destroy her poppy
plantations once and for all and deliver the
human race from the opium scourge. No one
seemed to realise that we could not decree the
starvation of thousands of men, women and
children employed in the cultivation of opium,
which for centuries had been their sole means
of livelihood. These people are not to blame,
because they genuinely believed they were
selling opium as a medicine to relieve suffering.
Fortunately, the United States delegation,
after a careful examination, grasped the true
import of our memorandum and, taking the
view that our arguments were just and well
founded, their delegate in Sub-Committee B
proposed that a Committee of Enquiry com-
posed of agricultural, engineering and financial
experts should be sent to Persia under the
auspices of the League of Nations to study the
question on the spot and to seek the best method
of giving us effective assistance and of reducing
the cultivation of opium to strictly medical
and scientific needs.
At the request of the United States delega-
tion, I telegraphed to Teheran the text of
their proposal, and I am happy to be able to
inform the Conference that I have just received
a cable from H.E. the Minister for Foreign
Affairs informing me that the Persian Govern-
ment accepts the proposal of the United States
delegation.
.The first step has thus been taken towards
the solution of the opium question in Persia,
and I hope that the Conference, the Council
and the Assembly of the League of Nations
will adopt a favourable attitude towards the
proposal of the United States delegation,
thus rendering a great service to humanity
and to the noble aims which inspire this Confe-
rence. {Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. Daladier, delegate of
France, will address the Conference.
IV!. Daladier (France)
Translation : Ladies and gentlemen, my
first duty is to associate myself fully, on behalf
of the French delegation, with the noble sen-
timents which have been expressed here by
Viscount Cecil and M. Loudon. I feel that
it is incumbent on us to express, in particular
our profound respect for Viscount Cecil, whose
unremitting efforts for so many years in the
cause of international understanding have
earned our profoundest gratitude. {Applause.)
I would now like to lay before the Conference
a few observations which are not guided by
political considerations but rather by a desire to
The President


bring the discussion back to the precise point
from which, I think, it has strayed under the
influence of these very political considerations
and to treat this problem of narcotics as it
should be treated, that is to say, in a practical
spirit and with the determination to attain real
and effective results.
After hearing all the eloquent speeches which
have been made here in the last two days, I
can only say that I still hold to the observa-
tion which I made in my first speech, namely,
that the primary consideration is still the cam-
paign against alkaloids. I regret that the
question of prepared opium has been, in some
sort, treated separately, for I have gained the
conviction both from the work of experts and
from the experience of practical men that, to
use a colloquial expression, the hypodermic
syringe is a much graver danger to humanity
than the opium-smoker?s pipe.
It is a matter of regret to me that, while we
have been engaged in this great debate on opium,
we appear to have forgotten that in many of
our leading newspapers there appear, daily,
advertisements publicly offering quantities of
alkaloids corresponding to millions and hun-
dreds of millions of those injections which are
both so degrading and so fatal in their effects.
I have felt it incumbent on me to make this
statement, ladies and gentlemen, but needless to
say, that does not mean that France has any
desire to turn a deaf ear to the invitation which
is extended to her here ; on the contrary, she is
resolved to deal with this problem of opium and
of opium consumption in all sincerity and loyalty.
I listened with great interest to the declara-
tion made by the Japanese delegate, a decla-
ration inspired alike by the highest idealism
and by a keen sense of reality. His country
has made a very considerable effort against
the abuse of opium, and I note from my honou-
rable colleague?s statement that the result
of the experiment has been to suppress, or
at least to reduce very considerably, the con-
sumption of opium in Formosa, but that most
of these energetic and disinterested measures
failed when they were applied in Kwantung.
The Japanese delegation has thus placed the
problem in its true light, and the conclusion
it has put before you is that in Formosa, an
island of three million inhabitants, which is
easy to control, Japan has succeeded in res-
tricting considerably the use of opium for
smoking, but that in Kwantung, where geo-
graphical conditions are different, she has been
unable to attain this result, because she has
been the victim of contraband and of the illicit
traffic in opium.
Contraband, illicit traffic ; these are the
difficulties which dominate the problem and
which the delegates of all the countries repre-
sented here have emphasised and of which they
have spoken to the practical man and to those
who are anxious as regards realities. When I hear
and read the declarations of the honourable
delegate for Japan, I am particularly struck
by the lesson they contain, namely, that the
chief difficulty is to deal with inveterate smokers.
He particularly emphasised that the peril was
a serious one and that innumerable inveterate
smokers, rather than give up their vice, would
emigrate to countries where opium-smoking
was still tolerated. This is a problem which
very closely affects France, because 70 per cent
of the opium-smokers in Indo-China are Chinese.
I also listened with deep interest to the honou-
rable delegate of the United States. I have the
greatest admiration for the fervour with which
his great country is pursuing the struggle against
narcotics and the energy with which he himself
defended his point of view. But I venture to
say that, treating this problem on its merits, I
cannot think that the American proposals would
have the results which the United States dele-
gation anticipates. And why ? Because they
only deal with the question of imports. The
experience of so many of the delegations
assembled here is that, if it is desired to reduce
consumption, it is necessary to take a series
of co-ordinated measures dealing simultaneously
with all the aspects of the problem : produc-
tion, traffic, importation and consumption.
If any evidence is needed in support of this
view which for my part I will never cease
to maintain I can give you a few definite
facts for which, if any delegations desire expla-
nations, I can quote chapter and verse.
In the documents which I have here, and on
which I invite the Conference?s comments, I
see that the Chinese people between 1906 and
1917 succeeded in suppressing almost entirely
the production of opium. Since the civil war
which has unfortunately overtaken that great
country, the measures adopted, although they
correspond to the aspirations of the best ele-
ments in the population, have not been respected
in practice. We, as neighbours of that country,
know that the generals, the governors of the
provinces and the army chiefs, whatever may
be the intentions of the Central Government,
at present derive the greater part of their
revenue from the traffic in opium.
In reality, China is gradually cultivating the
poppy once more on a very large scale, although
in 1917 its production had almost ceased. The
cultivation of the poppy has even been intro-
duced into provinces where it was unknown before
the prohibition era. In the regions of Yung-chin,
Pao-ling, Shung-shan and Chiun-ching, ?opium
trains? are run under military guard. At
Kwo-gang, Fai-Ho, Ying-Chow-Fu and Su-
Chow-Fu, one-tenth of the land is covered
with poppy; the tax levied on cultivation in a
single locality attains the figure of 400,000
piastres.
I might multiply examples, and if it proves to
be necessary later on in the discussion, I will
quote others, which we can compare with those
I have just mentioned. But for the moment
the point I wish to mention again is that, at the
very doors of the French possessions in the
Far East, the cultivation of the poppy has
been resumed on a considerable scale. It
would therefore be hypocritical of me to accept
a formal and strict undertaking, when, on our
very frontiers, no steps are being taken to
prohibit or even strictly to reduce the cultiva-
tion of the poppy.
If, gentlemen, you grant me these premises,
you will recognise that production, traffic, impor-
tation and consumption are problems which
cannot be treated separately ; they can only
be considered and dealt with as a whole. I
find a theoretical justification of this point of
view in the official declarations of American
statesmen. In ?Hearings before the Committee
on Foreign Affairs House of Representatives,
U.S.A., February 21st, 1924?, I find Resolu-
tion N� 20 of the 68th Congress, which reads
as follows :


?In order to prevent the abuse of these
products, it is necessary to exercise the
control of the production of raw opium in
such a manner that there will be no surplus
available for non-medical and non-scien-
tific purposes.?
I may also quote an extremely eloquent and
moving speech made by Mr. Porter at the fifth
session of the Advisory Committee on Opium,
which was also held here at Geneva from May
to June 1923. Mr. Porter said :
?The United States feels that the unres-
tricted production of raw opium inevitably
results in a surplus of the drug over and
above that required for medicinal and
scientific purposes, and the diversion of it
or its derivatives morphine, cocaine
and codeine into illicit channels of
international traffic, thereby creating a
problem of universal international concern.?
I would also like to add this sentence, the
importance of which will not escape you. Mr.
Porter continues in these terms :
?. . .and making impossible the exe-
cution of laws adopted by the several
Governments under the terms of the Con-
vention.?
I think it would be bad taste on my part if
I pressed this point any further. 1 would like
to say, however, that, if certain somewhat strong
remarks which have been made were levelled
at my country, I feel that it is unnecessary for
me to answer them, first, because I consider
that history sufficiently proves that France has
always honoured her signature, and, secondly,
because, as regards this question of raw opium
and its consumption, France, on her own ini-
tiative and without waiting for the convocation
of any international conference, has reduced the
consumption of opium for smoking by more than
50 per cent since 1906.
I recognise, however, that the strong criti-
cisms so ably formulated by Mr. Porter contain
a number of definite objections, some of which,
at least, appear to me to be well founded. I
think that it is the duty of all the countries
represented at this Conference to take careful
note of these objections. I understand fully
Mr. Porter?s objection when he states that if
no undertaking is entered into with regard to
the enquiry of which he has spoken, with a
view to the suppression of opium for smoking
within a specified period, it will look as if all
action in this matter is being put off to the
Greek Kalends. This was not, in fact, the
intention of those who put forward these pro-
posals, but I recognise that on this point Mr.
Porter should obtain satisfaction.
To be faithful to the methods of conciliation,
peace and mutual concession, which are symbolic
of the very atmosphere of Geneva, and to follow
the numerous examples of co-operation and har-
mony which have been given to the whole
world in this very room, the French delegation
therefore desires to make a declaration in
which it has endeavoured to conciliate the often
conflicting views which have been put forward
in this Conference.
With your permission, ladies and gentlemen,
I will read it ;
?The Government of the French Republic,
being firmly resolved to fight against the
use of opium and other narcotics, under any
form, in the countries placed under its
authority ;
?But considering, as it has already stated,
that the consumption of these drugs in its
possessions in Indo-China is closely depen-
dent on the production in the neighbouring
countries :
"Undertakes to abolish completely the
use of prepared opium in its territory
within the periods and subject to the con-
ditions specified below :
"Within a period of two years from the
date of ratification of this Convention,
the States exercising authority in ter-
ritories contiguous to French Indo-China
will suppress the cultivation of the poppy,
or will effect a very considerable reduc-
tion therein, for all purposes other than
medical and scientific ;
"During the third year and following
years, the Council of the League of
Nations will officially note the effective
disappearance, or very considerable re-
duction, of the cultivation of the poppy
in these territories.
"The Government of the French Repub-
lic undertakes, as soon as the Council
of the League of Nations has notified it
of its decision, to suppress progressively
and completely the use of prepared opium
in Indo-China within a maximum period
of fifteen years.?
As regards the scope and meaning of this decla-
ration, I of course entirely agree with what Visco-
unt Cecil said in regard to the legal aspect, and I
have therefore added the following paragraph :
"In the view of the French Government,
these provisions confirm and complete
those adopted in virtue of the Hague Con-
vention of 1912, and those inserted in the
draft Final Protocol adopted by the First
Opium Conference, which met at Geneva
on November 3rd, 1924.?
Gentlemen, I trust that in this way, if I
have not had the good fortune to gain your con-
viction and your adherence, I have at any rate
done my best to respond on behalf of my country
to the appeal which has been addressed to us
in this Conference.
We have been reminded of the difficulties
encountered in the fight against slavery and of
the final success gained in that field. Allow
me to say that France was the first country to
abolish slavery and to endeavour to establish
equality as between the races of mankind.
She considers that the equality of men does
not depend on colour but on the sincerity of
their efforts to achieve justice.
In this question of opium, we are determined
to remain loyal to our traditions and to the
example which has been set by our forefathers.
Accordingly, now that the time has come, as
we hope, to begin an active and effective crusade
against opium, the French people are ready and
willing to respond to the call. (Loud applause.)
The President
Translation : There are still four speakers
on my list ; I will therefore postpone the
discussion on the proposal submitted by the
United States delegation to the next meeting,
which will take place this afternoon at 4 o?clock
punctually.
The Conference rose at 1.25 p.m.

THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA : MOTION SUB-
MITTED BY THE DELEGATION OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . CONTI-
NUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
The President
Translation : The meeting is open.
I call upon M. El Guindy, first delegate for
Egypt, to address the Conference.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gentle-
men, I did not think I should be called upon
to take part in this discussion, especially as
I had, on the eve of our adjournment, expres-
sed my admiration for the laudable and praise-
worthy efforts of the United States delegation
and my approval of the motion which it had
put forward, and which forms the subject of
our present discussion.
Is hould be glad to concur in the suggestion
made in this connection by the Japanese dele-
gation, but there is one important word, a
word of decisive importance, if I may say so,
which has been used and frequently repeated,
and which causes me to intervene in the
discussion. That word is ?smuggling.? In this
connection, I may affirm that, as far as I know,
no country in the world has suffered more than
Egypt. Smuggling, on a vast scale, of all
narcotic substances (hashish, morphine, heroin,
cocaine and their derivatives) is assuming ever
larger dimensions in our country, in spite of
the great efforts made by all the competent
authorities.
In consequence, the situation has become so
alarming that the whole nation, with the excep-
tion, of course, of the addicts themselves, is
aroused to the utmost indignation, and from
all sides, from religious and educational bodies
and from administrative circles, moving and
eloquent appeals are reaching us pointing out
the ravages of these drugs and calling upon us
to put a stop to them. The newspapers,
both Egyptian and foreign, are every day
devoting important space in their columns to
this subject. A quite recent communique from
the Chief of Police in Cairo shows that 85 per
cent of lunacy cases are due to the abuse of
these drugs.
This does not mean that the Egyptian
Government is doing nothing to stop smuggling.
No country has to bear such heavy charges
in its budget for this purpose as Egypt, but
in spite of this, varying quantities of hashish,
cocaine, morphine and heroin, etc. are daily
being confiscated. At one time we thought
that this evil this terrible epidemic, rather
would remain confined to the big towns.
Unhappily this is not the case. In the Egyptian
countryside the fellah, who is the Egyptian
peasant, used only to think of working for
himself, his family and his bit of land. At the
present time, one of the most intelligent and
hardest-working peasantries in the world is
threatened with the loss of its fine qualities
through the effects of these drugs. From being
a valuable factor in society and civilisation, it
is likely to become a danger and an enemy to
humanity.
As I have had the honour to explain to you,
we have not failed in our task. Like all of
you, we are doing our best practically and
morally to combat smuggling. At the same time,
I must confess with sorrow and regret that the
results are neither decisive nor re-assuring, nor,
indeed, even satisfactory. The smugglers will
beat us and will certainly gain the upper hand,
thanks to their financial resources and their
unscrupulousness. The more we work to stamp
out smuggling, the more the smugglers will
increase their efforts. This is what I have
always said and what I have remarked to my
colleagues in our conversations concerning
hashish and the other drugs.
In order to remedy this deplorable state of
affairs, we have only one single radical means,
namely, to attack the evil at its source, to
strike at the root of the matter, as our colleagues
and predecessors in the debate have so well
said. The smuggler must be deprived of' the
opportunity to employ his skill in doing evil ;
at any price, the production of these narcotics
must be reduced, both as regards their culti-
vation and manufacture, and then we shall
attain our object. Let us forbid absolutely
the production of hashish, opium or coca
leaves, their salts and their derivatives for
other purposes than medical and scientific
use.
At the beginning, no doubt, we shall be faced
with various difficulties, but we shall overcome
them without suffering much loss. Let us
have the courage of our convictions. Let us
all do some practical work toward this humani-
tarian end. Let us all contribute our disin-
terested and effective co-operation, as we have
many times promised to do. Let us stand
side by side and paralyse this terrible evil;
let us destroy the common enemy.
Let each for his part make the great and
heavy sacrifice, which will not be very great


nor very heavy in comparison with the results
so much desired and hoped for. Otherwise, it
seems to me that we should be wasting our
time and that our efforts would be in vain, since
the results would be nil. Let us therefore
reduce the production of all drugs, and we shall
then realise our common aim. By this reduc-
tion, which is the only remedy, we shall save
the victims themselves as well as the criminal
smugglers and their propaganda agents.
Let us allow men to live free, independent
and healthy lives, that is to say, to live in peace
and with good-will one towards the other, with
feelings of friendliness and mutual confidence,
instead of being nourished on hatred, rancour
and distrust.
In this way we shall show ourselves doubly
worthy of our country, of humanity and the
whole of civilisation. [Applause.)
The President
Translation: M. Veverka, delegate of Czecho
Slovakia, will address the Conference.
M. Veverka (Czechoslovakia)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gen-
tlemen, two months ago the Conference started
with a general discussion. We all stated our
opinions, made our declarations of good-will, and
only after long and laborious discussion did
we succeed in drawing up a plan of work and
finally start upon it.
To-day we are resuming the general discus-
sion, for it was necessary to provide an oppor-
tunity of stating their views for those who
have come among us for the first time to give
us their support and assistance. We are glad
to find that these newcomers are inspired
with the same idealism and the same wish to
succeed as ourselves. Their names and their
records are a guarantee that we shall arrive
at a happy result.
I am not afraid to speak of idealism, even
after the exhortation of the honourable dele-
gate for India. The realist methods of which
he spoke will doubtless be applied when we
are seeking to devise effective machinery to
organise the campaign against drugs, but in
order to find courage to create this effective
and practical machinery, apart from all mate-
rial considerations, we must be guided by idea-
lism, an idealism which must be as enthusiastic
as it is militant and constructive, as noble and
as pure as it is laborious an idealism of which
we have a shining example among us I
mean Viscount Cecil, the great apostle of
human solidarity.
If we want to succeed we must get to work.
One of my colleagues said to me, in all sincerity,
that it was very hard for him to discuss prob-
lems here which the others sometimes did
not understand. I confess my ignorance, but
I do not despair, because all the great social
and political problems of humanity, such as
freedom of conscience, serfdom, slavery, and
the problem of political liberty, have been solved
by men who, in the opinion of contemporary
experts, did not understand them.
To come to the chief point of the present
discussion, that is to say, the proposal made
by the United States delegation to refer their
suggestions for discussion to a competent
vSub-Committee, I support the word ?discus-
sion but not the word ?adoption?. Ido not
see for my part, as a good democrat, that it
is possible to give a blank refusal to this request?
whatever interpretation may be put upon the
resolutions of the Assembly.
The distinguished President of my country,
Thomas Masaryk, when he returned from exile,
stated his whole programme in three words :
?Democracy means discussion?. It seems dif-
ficult for us not to accept this maxim as our
guiding principle, after we have called a Confe-
rence of such high moral authority and such
technical competence. It seems the more diffi-
cult since the delegates of the British Empire
and France have made declarations on the
same subject. It would seem logical to put
these statements together and refer them to a
competent Sub-Committee, but we have also
before us a suggestion by the Polish delegation
and a very concrete proposal by the Indian
delegation, the latter asking that the question
of reference should be settled by the authority
of the President. We also have the French
statement, which might in my opinion serve
as a basis for reconciling these various sugges-
tions.
After two months? experience, we must say
to ourselves "dicimus justiciam moniti?, and
after so much discussion "et post tot crimina
rerum?. All these proposals deserve to be
considered with attention. We must find a
solution which will allow us to continue our
efforts to arrive at a just and equitable settle-
ment amid this maze of suggestions. In order
to obtain this result we need time, and, if this
is granted to us, I am convinced that we shall
succeed, since I cannot imagine that there is
any statesman, no matter what position he
may occupy among the great of this world,
who would dare to-day to assume and take
upon himself the tremendous responsibility of
destroying this Conference, which was convoked
under the auspices of the League of Nations
and the brotherhood of peoples. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : I call upon Dr. Sjostrand,
delegate of Sweden, to speak.
IVI. Sjostrand (Sweden)
Mr. President and fellow-delegates, I feel
convinced that the majority of representatives
from States not directly concerned in the matter
under debate would like to have time to form
an opinion about the different proposals, decla-
rations and suggestions which we have received.
On the one hand, there is the United States
proposal, demanding a straight vote on the refer-
ence of the matter to a Sub-Committee of the
Conference. On the other hand, there is a
declaration from the British delegate, also
relating to the matter under debate, and, further,
a declaration from the French delegate. The
delegate of the United States seems to be
willing to make some concessions as to the
substance covered by his motion, and perhaps
the same willingness might be found on the
other side.
For my part, I cannot see why these proposals
and declarations could not be used as a basis
for discussion, with a view to reaching an agree-
ment which would satisfy all the members of
the Conference. Some of us have the impres-
sion that if a vote were taken here and now it
would mean a breakdown of the Conference,
which would indeed be very regrettable. Two
or three days are not wasted if during that time


a way could be found out of the present dilemma.
In the meantime it may perhaps not be impos-
sible to find a means of co-ordinating the diffe-
rent proposals and suggestions and of placing
them before the Conference in such a form as
will enable us to resume our work and to
arrive finally at a satisfactory conclusion.
For instance, it might be useful to lay the
proposals, declarations and suggestions before
a body or a delegation composed of an equal
number of delegates from the First and Second
Conferences. Of course, different suggestions
may be made for the composition of such a
body, and I do not lay any special stress upon
that point now. But what Ido lay stress upon
is the importance of leaving nothing untried
in order to find a solution.
It would really be a disgrace if, after the League
has passed through five years of constructive
work, during which no Conference and no
Commission has failed to arrive, at all events,
at some measure of general agreement, this
Conference should break up. In the numerous
other Conferences, even where questions closely
touching the national honour were involved,
an agreement has been found possible. Prob-
lems of fundamental interest, such as frontier
and minorities questions, and even the question
of security, involving political difficulties infi-
nitely greater than those with which this
Conference is concerned, have been solved. It
would surely be a calamity if the hopes which
millions of people throughout the world have
based on the League of Nations were to be
prejudiced, if not destroyed, by the failure of
this Conference to find some way out of its
present difficulties.
The issue at stake is not whether we shall find
a solution of the technical problem with which
we are confronted but whether we are to check
the whole development of the League and
diminish the faith and the hope which the demo-
cracies of the world have placed in it.
It is for this reason that I urge the Conference
to consider my suggestion, and I am certain that
it corresponds to the feelings of all the countries
not directly interested in the question and, I
believe also, to the feelings of those whose
interests are directly involved.
I therefore move that the discussion of the
United States proposal be adjourned until
Saturday, January 24th, in order that we may
try to find a means of elucidating and co-ordi-
nating the proposals, declarations and sugges-
tions before the Conference, perhaps by means of
a delegation created from the two Conferences.
The President
Translation : We now have before us
a proposal by the honourable delegate for
Sweden, which is certainly inspired by the
most sincere desire for the success of this
Conference. I do not think there can be
any objection to the discussion of this proposal
to-day. To save time, I will request the Secre-
tariat to be so good as to have Dr. Sjostrand?s
proposal distributed. In the meantime, we
will continue the discussion on the motion
submitted by the American delegation. When
the delegates are fully acquainted with the
Swedish proposal, I will open the discussion
on this motion of order.
Has anyone any objection ?
1 call upon M. Toivola, delegate of Finland,
to speak.
[VI. Toivola (Finland)
I rise to second the motion put by my
Swedish friend. Before saying a single word
on the question which is before us now, I wish
to make it quite clear that the country which
I have the honour to represent here is disinte-
rested in the question of opium-smoking. We
are not producing opium and we do not smoke
it, even if we are very fond of a good English
pipe.
But, disinterested as we are in that question,
we are not altogether disinterested in the future
of this Conference. I agree with my Swedish
friend that the breakdown of this Conference
would be perhaps fatal for the League of Nations.
I think that every Member of the League
would be happy to see this Conference lead to
some tangible result. A few days would, in
my opinion, be long enough in which to show
whether there is the possibility of a concilia-
tion between the different points of view.
I have the impression, for my own part, that
such a basis for conciliation exists. The United
States delegation, which has with great enthu-
siasm taken part in our work since the middle
of November last, has, I believe, come here to
do business. I think, in the same way, that
the British delegation has not come here to
make obstructions, and the declaration made
by the head of the French delegation this
morning shows, to my mind, that good-will
exists on the part of France. Well, that
good-will must be explored.
I think that the proposal made by my
Swedish friend opens the door for the Confe-
rence to find a solution. To my mind, the
only condition for success is that we grasp the
facts and the realities that have been pointed
out to us, and in my opinion the most real
fact is that not everything we have asked for
can be obtained at this Conference. If we are
asking for a pound of flesh, we cannot get it,
but a body created in the way suggested by
Dr. Sjostrand might give us half a pound, and
personally I should be quite content with
that. {Applause.)
The President
Translation : Mr. Shepherd, delegate of
Australia, will address the Conference.
Mr. Shepherd (Australia)
Mr. President, I had no desire to take part
in this debate, and probably would not have
done so but for a statement in the Journal de
Geneve that I was going to vote for the United
States proposal. I wish at once to correct
that statement. I do not intend to vote for
the United States proposal for various reasons :
because I believe it to be outside the scope of
this Conference and because the United States
delegation has repeatedly stated that what it
wanted was to have its proposal discussed. Well,
so far as I can see, its proposal has been very fully
discussed ; in fact, it seems to me that we have
done very little else but discuss it for some time
past. These discussions have clearly and defi-
nitely demonstrated the fact that a number of
countries most concerned cannot see their way
to accept them for reasons which appear to be
clear and justifiable under existing conditions.
Even if the American suggestions were
within the competence of this Conference, they
would be referred to a Committee composed
of exactly the same elements as the full Confe-


rence. The discussion in the full Conference would not effectively suppress this traffic
VIQC cVtr�xxrr* 4- /-* 4- 1 _ 1 C T C X I*l t *-T * * - .
has clearly shown that there is no prospect of
unanimity, as several of the countries most
concerned have definitely stated their views.
No good purpose would therefore be served by
again stating them in a Committee.
It is therefore perfectly obvious that there
is no prospect whatever of agreement. I have
no desire to see the Conference destroyed,
because I am most anxious to see progress made
in the direction of stopping the traffic in the
derivatives of opium and coca, which was the
principal duty entrusted to this Conference.
I hope, therefore, that wiser counsels will
prevail and that the American delegation
will be satisfied with having achieved its object,
namely, the full discussion of its proposals.
The President
Translation : I call upon the Hon. Stephen
Porter, delegate of the United States, to speak.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) :
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen of the
Conference, the distinguished delegate from
Australia is entirely mistaken. Apparently
he has not read the pending motion ; it does
not ask for the discussion of this item in the
American suggestions ; it asks for the consi-
deration of it in the same way that all other
items have been, or I hope will be, considered.
We certainly did not cross the Atlantic Ocean
for the purpose of hearing it discussed and
having the matter end there. We came here
in good faith in the hope that the proposal
would be considered by the Conference and
passed upon either adopted or rejected.
We first met on the 17th of last November.
I believe that is now sixty-four days ago, and
I still find myself knocking at the door of the
Conference for a hearing on this particular item.
It may be that I am now in the vestibule
I am not sure but I am certain that the
door-bell must be out of order.
I would be delighted if the Conference would
take the suggestion of the distinguished dele-
gate from Czechoslovakia and refer all these
matters to an appropriate Committee. Nothing
would please me more, because we are only
asking to be heard in the ordinary way.
A motion of adjournment until next Saturr
day has been put before the Conference. Well,
1 like Geneva ; I have met many delightful
people here ; but I am afraid that if I stop
here much longer I shall forget my home in
the smoky city. I am perfectly willing to
wait. I think everyone will grant that I
have been quite patient in regard to the matter.
And why ? Because we all recognise the impor-
tance of this matter to the whole world, and
because we have been hoping against hope that
we can reach a satisfactory agreement.
I must confess that I feel very much discour-
aged in regard to the situation. However, the
position can change quite rapidly in conferences.
The present situation may change, and I
have no objection to an adjournment until
Saturday, because I have always been willing
to confer with anybody on every occasion in
the hope of reaching an amicable adjustment
of this matter. I have, however, one guide-
post which frankness and candour compel
me to state, and that is this: that I should
not feel justified in agreeing to a treaty that
If I did so, I should be unfair and unjust to
every delegate here. If I signed such an
agreement, the chances are that I would not
be able to secure its ratification by the Senate
of the United States. I do not want to put
myself in that position, and I know you do not
want me to do so.
I might go a step further and say that it
has been somewhat humiliating for us that we
have not been able to be heard on this problem,
but, notwithstanding that, I have no objection
to adjourning it until Saturday. I beg, however,
that on Saturday we may dispose of the matter
once and for all.
The President
Translation : The last speaker began speak-
ing on the proposal for adjournment put by
the first delegate for Sweden. Although this
motion has not yet been distributed to the
members of the Conference, I have nothing to
urge against its immediate discussion. I will
therefore open the discussion on this motion
for adjournment.
Viscount Cecil, delegate of the British Empire,
will address the Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
I have only a few words to say. I am pre-
pared to accept the motion put forward by the
Swedish delegate, and I think that on the whole,
it represents the best course we could pursue!
It will be, of course, for the President to decide,
but I trust that the intervening days may not
be entirely lost by the Conference, and that
we may possibly be able to go on with other
parts of our work in the meanwhile.
I do not really need to add anything, except
that, as regards the other suggestions which
were included in the Swedish delegate?s speech,
I can only say that I will give them my most
earnest consideration. My object is to arrive
at a solution of the deadlock in which we
find ourselves, and, if I may be permitted to
say so to Mr. Porter, I make no declaration as
to what I will or will not ultimately accept.
The President
Translation : M. Sze, delegate of China,
will address the Conference.
M. Sze (China)
I rise with all seriousness to say a few words
with reference to the proposal submitted to
the Conference by the distinguished delegate
of Sweden. This is not the first time that I
have had the honour of addressing the Confe-
rence on the desirability, necessity or wisdom
of an adjournment. When the last adjourn-
ment was proposed, before the Christmas
vacation, it was with much concern, as 1
told you yesterday, that I gave my assent. It
is with no less concern that I rise to-day to
give my assent ; I hope that this adjournment,
though only for a space of two days, will
bring us results acceptable to all, results
upon which we may look with pride and admi-
ration.
In giving my assent to the proposal that there
should be an adjournment in order to afford
an opportunity for a possible harmonising of
the several proposals or suggestions that have
been made regarding the control of the traffic
in prepared opium, it is appropriate that I


should say that any proposal that may be
presented to this Conference, in order to be
acceptable to my country, will have to be
one that gives definite assurances that within
a reasonable period of time, the termination
of which can be clearly foreseen, the legalised
traffic in prepared opium in those territories
and possessions where it is now temporarily
permitted by law will be brought to an end.
It is my duty, in giving my assent to the new
proposal of adjournment, to state my position
clearly.
The President
Translation : M. Loudon, delegate of the
Netherlands, will address the Conference.
IVI. Loudon (Netherlands)
Translation : May I be allowed to address
a few words more particularly to Viscount Cecil ?
I do not know if I have rightly understood
what he said. Did Viscount Cecil say that he
agreed to the adjournment of the Conference
pure and simple or that he agreed to submitting
this question to a Committee or a delegation
of the two Conferences ?
The President
Translation : I think that the first dele-
gate for the Netherlands has slightly misun-
derstood what was said. The proposal made
by the first delegate for Sweden referred simply
to the adjournment, in order that we might
in this way try to effect a co-ordination of the
different suggestions and proposals. It con-
tained no suggestions as to the methods to be
employed in this co-ordination. Is the first
delegate for the Netherlands satisfied with this
explanation ?
M. Loudon (Netherlands)
Translation : Perfectly.
The President
Translation : Viscount Cecil, delegate of
the British Empire, will address the Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
I should like to reply out of courtesy to my
friend the delegate of the Netherlands. The
President has very accurately expressed my
intention. I intended to assent to the adjourn-
ment, and to the adjournment only. As to
the other matter, I will, of course, consider
most carefully what the Swedish delegate has
said, but it would evidently be improper, on the
spur of the moment, to express any opinion
upon it, favourable or unfavourable.
The President
Translation : M. Daladier, delegate of
France, will address the Conference.
M. Daladier (France)
Translation : On behalf of the French dele-
gation, I gladly concur in the proposal that has
been put before us. At the same time, I would
observe that, in my opinion, Saturday, the date
proposed, should be the latest date. I mean
that, if the delegates find themselves in a posi-
tion to resume the Conference sooner, it should
be understood that we might meet, say, on
Friday. Subject to this reservation, the French
delegation gladly adheres to the Swedish pro-
posal.
Translation : As I interpret the remark of
the French delegation, the question of resuming
the meetings should be left to my discretion.
M. Daladier (France)
Translation : Certainly, Mr. President.
The President
Translation : Does the delegate of Sweden
wish to give any supplementary information
regarding his proposal ?
IVI. Sjostrand (Sweden)
I only wish to confirm the fact that the inter-
pretation the President has given to my inten-
tions is quite correct.
The President
Translation : Do any members of the Con-
ference wish to add anything in regard to the
Swedish proposal for adjournment ? Does any-
one want a formal vote on this proposal ?
As no one has asked to speak, I declare the
proposal by the Swedish delegation unanimously
accepted, it being understood that it is inter-
preted in the way just explained by the first
delegate of France.
The proposal was adopted.
69. IVIETHOD OF WORK OF THE COMMIT-
TEES AND SUB-COMMITTEES AND
APPOINTMENT OF THE CO-ORDINA-
TION COMMITTEE.
The President
Translation : Previously to this meeting
I had intended to propose an adjournment, not
in connection with the question with which
we have dealt to-day but in order to dispose
of the other outstanding work of the Confe-
rence. To-morrow at 10.30 a.m. there will
be a meeting of the Business Committee, of
which I have the honour to be the Chairman.
I must ask the Chairmen of the different
Sub-Committees for information as to how the
work of their respective Sub-Committees stands.
I do not know whether these gentlemen desire
to give this information at once or whether they
prefer to communicate it to me in writing. As
no one has asked to speak, I presume that
these gentlemen will inform me in the manner
they think best. I must, however, draw your
attention to several points.
As I have already said, we have had the mis-
fortune to lose a very distinguished represen-
tative in the first delegate for Canada, Dr.
Beland, Chairman of Sub-Committee A. This
Sub-Committee will therefore have to appoint
a new Chairman. Accordingly, I would ask
the Vice-Chairman, the delegate for Sweden,
to be so good as to take the necessary steps to
summon a meeting of the Sub-Committee for
the purpose of appointing its Chairman.
I have a question to put with regard to the
reports of the Sub-Committees. The Chairmen
of the Sub-Committees need not answer this
question now if they do not wish to do so.
The reports which were distributed before the
Christmas adjournment are ?provisional re-
ports? and I cannot judge whether the Sub-
Committees do or do not desire to revise these
reports prior to their discussion. I believe
The President


that the report of Sub-Committee B, of which
the Polish delegate is Chairman, is not yet
complete.
1 will ask the V ice-Chairman of Sub-Committee
A, and the Chairmen of the other Sub-Commit-
tees, to be so good as to inform me on this
point.
Before the Christmas adjournment the Con-
ference had decided to create a Co-ordination
Committee. In consequence of a proposal by
the British delegation, it had been agreed that
this Co-ordination Committee should be made
up of two members of Sub-Committees A, B
and D and one member of Sub-Committee C.
1 therefore request the Vice-Chairman of Sub-
Committee A and the Chairmen of the other
three Sub-Committees to be so good as to
summon their respective Sub-Committees in
order to nominate the members who are to
form the Co-ordination Committee.
After these appointments are made, I will
ask the elected members to meet and select
a Chairman.
Further, I would like to put a question to the
members of the Business Committee, a rather
important question, because it affects the arrange-
ment of the work which remains to be done.
When the reports of the different Sub-Commit-
tees are finally completed, should they be dis-
cussed here in plenary session before being
submitted to the Co-ordination Committee or
is it better that they should first be submitted
to the Co-ordination Committee before being
discussed in plenary meeting ? I do not wish
to express an opinion on this subject, but I
will ask the members of the Business Committee
to consider the point. If my second suggestion
is accepted, the plenary Conference will have
a definitive text for its discussion, and the dele-
gations which are not in agreement with the
views adopted by the Co-ordination Committee
will be able to formulate proposals or suggest
modifications as regards the final work of the
Co-ordination Committee.
M. de Palacios, delegate of Spain, will address
the Conference.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : Mr. President, I should like
to make one practical observation. According
to what you have just said, Sub-Committees
A, B, C and D will doubtless meet to-morrow
in order to appoint one or two of their members,
as the case may be, to serve on the Co-ordina-
tion Committee. Thus it is certain that several
representatives of the same nationality will
serve on the Co-ordination Committee. Do
you not think that we could apply to that
Committee the same system as was adopted
in constituting the Sub-Committees of the
Conference, which consists in providing as far
as possible for the representation of producing
countries, consuming countries and countries
not directly concerned in the problem ?
This seems to be an important point to con-
sider. If we refer to our Rules of Procedure,
we should perhaps find a better solution, for
example, in Article 5, which lays down that,
among other things, the Business Committee
shall nominate for the approval of the Confe-
rence, should occasion arise, the members of any
C ommittee which shall be constituted by the
Conference. It seems to me, therefore, that,
in conformity with our Rules of Procedure,
we could entrust to the Business Committee
the duty of establishing the Co-ordination
Committee.
The President
Translation : I thank M. de Palacios for
his suggestion. 1 quite agree that our Rules
of Procedure seem to entitle us to entrust to
the Business Committee the duty of making
the proposals to the Conference as regards the
nomination of members.
If there is no opinion to the contrary, I
will venture, in my capacity as Chairman of
the Business Committee, to propose the dis-
cussion of this point with my colleagues at
to-morrow morning?s meeting.
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : Mr. President, may I say a
word with regard to the question raised, or
would you prefer that I should defer my remark
till the next meeting of the Business Committee ?
The President
Translation : If you think that the obser-
vation you desire to make may be helpful from
the general aspect of the question, I will ask
you to speak.
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I shall not take up the time
of the Conference very long. I simply wish
to say this : I quite appreciate M. de
Palacios? apprehensions, but I do not think
that they are quite justified. The different
members of the Sub-Committees are also repre-
sentatives of their delegations. On the Co-ordi-
nation Committee, however, at least so far as
I understand the matter, the representatives
of the different Sub-Committees are the manda-
tories and spokesmen of those Sub-Committees.
They have to set forth and explain within the
Co-ordination Committee the work done by
the Sub-Committees. Consequently, I do not
think that there is any conflict of interests, if
I may say so, since on the one hand we have
the representatives of the delegations and on
the other the authorised representatives of the
Sub-Committees, who have worked for weeks
at the study of the different problems submitted
to them.
I think, therefore, that we should leave to
the Sub-Committees the free choice of their
representatives on the Co-ordination Committee,
since they are in the best position to choose
from among persons who have participated
most actively in the work.
However, this question could, of course,
be discussed by the Business Committee. As
M. de Palacios is not a member of that Committee,
I wanted to put this objection to him to-day.
The President
Translation : M. Chodzko, delegate of Po-
land, will address the Conference.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I have no objection to the
discussion of this question by the Business Com-
mittee. I ought, however, to draw your
attention to the fact that in Sub-Committee B,
for example, we have already appointed two
representatives, of whom one is the Rapporteur
of that Sub-Committee. I imagine that this
case might also arise as regards the other Sub-


Committees, for the Rapporteurs are best able
to give information on the course of the work
and will be most suited to defend a point of
view before the Co-ordination Committee.
The President
Translation : I thank M. ( hodzko for his
observation. Account will naturally be taken
of his point of view in to-morrow?s discussion
by the Business Committee. The Sub-Com-
mittees will, of course, at all times have the
right to appoint their members.
The Business Committee will accordingly
meet to-morrow morning at n a.m.
The Conference rose at 5.40 p.m.

70. WITHDRAWAL OF THE DELEGATION
OF THE FREE CITY OF DANZIG
FROM THE CONFERENCE : NOTE
FROM THE POLISH DELEGATION.
The President
Translation : Before opening the discussion
on the first item on our agenda, I wish to read
this note which I have just received from the
first Polish delegate :
[Translation]
?The Senate of the Free City of Danzig
has expressed its desire to recall its dele-
gation from the Second Opium Conference
now meeting at Geneva under the auspices
of the League of Nations, and, the Polish
Government having agreed to the Senate?s
request, I have the honour to notify you
herewith that the Danzig delegation has
been recalled by my Government.
?I have to inform you that the delega-
tion will therefore take no further part in
the Conference.?
The communication from the Polish delegation
was noted.
PREPARED OPIUM : CHAPTER II OF
THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA : MOTION SUB-
MITTED BY THE DELEGATION OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA:
CONTINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
The President
Translation : You will remember that we
adjourned two days ago on a motion submitted
by the Swedish delegation in order that we
might endeavour to find a means of elucidating
and co-ordinating so far as possible the various
proposals, suggestions and declarations submit-
ted during our discussions.
We will now continue the discussion on the
motion proposed by the United States delega-
tion. I call upon M. Toivola, the Finnish dele-
gate, to speak.
M. Toivola (Finland)
When we adjourned last Wednesday, we
all hoped that the adjournment would help
us to find a way out of the difficulties which
have been confronting us since the middle of
November. I can assure you that during the
two days that have elapsed since last we met
no avenue likely to lead to a solution of the
opposing views has been left unexplored. On
every side there has been most sincere good-will
in seeking a compromise which would enable
the Conference to continue its work and to
reach a happy conclusion.
After having discussed this question with
a great many of my fellow-delegates, I am able
to propose an amendment to the motion of
the delegation of the United States of America,
an amendment which I hope will be carried
by this Conference.
I will read the amendment, which is as
follows :
?In suggesting that the First Opium
Conference meet in order to take a corres-
ponding decision, identical in its object,
and on condition that that corresponding
decision be adopted :
"The Second Opium Conference decides:
?To name eight delegates representative
of Governments, which have not participat-
ed in the First Conference, to form a
Committee with eight members designated
by the latter ;
?That that Committee shall be entrusted


with examining the aforementioned pro-
posal of the delegation of the United States
ot America, together with the various
suggestions and declarations presented du-
ring the recent discussions of the Second
Conference. The Committee shall present
a report to the two Conferences on the
result of its work with the least possible
delay."
I have very few words to add. I think that,
if this amendment to the American motion is
accepted, it would provide a basis for the colla-
boration of all the delegations in this Confe-
rence. I may say that, in my opinion, this
amendment has been made in the spirit that
has always prevailed in the assemblies of the
League of Nations, and I think all my colleagues
here agree that international collaboration
cannot be made to yield good results without
that very spirit.
The President
Translation : Under paragraph 2of Article
11 of the Rules of Procedure, I may, during the
debate, allow any amendment or resolution
to be discussed or voted upon if the text has
been submitted to me in writing beforehand.
As this formality has been complied with in the
present case, I now declare open the discussion
on the Finnish amendment.
I call upon M. Sze, delegate of China, to
address the Conference.
IVI. Sze (China)
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I wish,
� n m Y delegation, to congratulate
the delegate of Finland on the result of the
efforts that have been made during the last
two days. Nothing is further from our desire
than that this Conference should find the excel-
lent result of those efforts unacceptable to it.
This motion, however, has come so suddenly
and unexpectedly before us that I would ask
the President to be good enough to cause it
to be distributed so that we may be able to
examine and discuss it intelligently. Moreover,
in view of the fact of its sudden appearance,
may I ask that the vote on, the subject may not
be taken until this afternoon, after a full dis-
cussion this morning.
The President
Translation: In anticipation of the wishes of
members of the Conference, I have given in-
structions for the amendment to be roneoed
and distributed at once.
If I have understood the Chinese delegate
correctly, he has no objection to the amendment
being discussed now, but simply asks that a
vote should not be taken until this afternoon.
In any case, I think that we can hardly
ask the Conference to vote on the amendment
now, as certain members may perhaps wish to
submit further amendments. If the discussion
is concluded this morning, I will remember
M. Sze?s request.
I call upon Viscount Cecil, delegate of the
British Empire, to speak.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
We all, of course, knew that some proposal
of this kind would be presented to the Confe-
rence, because the Swedish delegate, in making
his motion, indicated that it was in his mind.
It does not therefore come altogether as a
surprise to any of us that suclua motion has
been presented. At the same time, I think
there is a great deal to be said for the Presi-
dent s suggestion that we might adjourn for a
quarter of an hour until the text has been roneod
and distributed.
I will reserve my general observations, if
that is the desire of the Conference. All I
will say now is that I hope the Conference will
consider this proposal very seriously. It seems
me 1 t0 be designed to meet a very giave
difficulty in which we are placed, without
requiring any of those who have taken strong
views on this matter to withdraw from the posi-
tion they have taken up. I think that this is
always a very desirable way of meeting diffi-
culties. It is nearly always extremely diffi-
cult for the representative of a sovereign Govern-
ment to abandon a position which he has
taken up ; but if he can find means of meeting
the other view without abandoning that posi-
tion, that is the wise course to adopt.
I should have thought that this resolution
leaves undecided the question of the competence
of this Conference to deal with the matter.
It puts that question on one side. On the
other hand, it provides for a very careful and
detailed consideration of the proposals of the
united States and of the declarations of the
intentions of particular Governments with re-
gard to this question. This seems to me to be
a practical commonsense way of dealing with
| be sifua-tion, and as far as lam concerned,
though I would like to reserve my final opinion
until I have seen the texts more closely in
nghsh and French, my first inclination is to
accept the proposal that has been put forward,
because it seems to me to meet the case in
a practical and commonsense fashion without
victory to either side. I have always asserted,
and still believe, that the great secret of the
success of the League of Nations is that it aims
at securing agreement without victory. I
therefore move that we do now adjourn for a
quarter of an hour pending the distribution
ot the resolution in English and French.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
ot America) :
I second the motion.
[ The meeting was adjourned at 11.10 a.m.
and resumed at 11.30 a.m. j
The President
. Translation : We will continue the discus-
sion _on the amendment submitted bv the
hmmsh delegation.
I call upon M. Sjostrand, the Swedish dele-
gate, to speak.
IVI. Sjostrand (Sweden) :
Mr. President and fellow-delegates, I rise
to support the amendment to the American
proposal It is evident to all members of
this Conference that we have arrived at a point
where we have to take a decision of the most
vital chaiacter. In such a situation, I rise
to plead not for theoretical distinctions, nor
01 haid and fast rules, but for practical co-
operation Ihis is perhaps a new method of
work in this Conference, but we ought not to
separate before having tried it, for the stakes
are enormous.
People outside the Conference cannot grasp


the theoretical aspect of the question, nor can
they understand the subleties of division,
but what they see is that there is a lack of
ability to come to a reasonable conclusion, to
a practical result. This is the test to which
we are put ; this is the measure according to
which our work is to be judged, and not only
the work of this Conference but the whole
humanitarian work of the League, so admirably
performed up till now.
May I also remind you that it is the first
Conference of the League where duly accredited
representatives of the great American Republic
are taking part. This great fact is more than a
revelation: it is a revolution. It marks the
end of a period, and it depends upon us if it
will mark the beginning of a new.
What has brought us into our present posi-
tion ? the separate mandates given by the
Assembly of the League to the two Conferences.
But the object of the whole work undertaken
by the League is evidently to develop and
make more effective the measures provided for
or indicated in the Hague Convention. It can
never have been the intention of the Assembly
to split the Hague Convention into two parts
and thus to weaken instead of reinforcing it.
In that case, it must have been in the minds
of the authors of Resolutions V and VI that
the results achieved by both Conferences should
be co-ordinated and made a whole.
In my opinion, it is up to both Conferences
to take in hand that work of co-ordination,
as was foreshadowed in a suggestion made by
the Japanese delegation before the adjournment
last year. What would, in effect, have been
the difference if this division of mandates had
not been laid down by the Assembly and if
the whole work had been entrusted to one
single Conference ? In reality I cannot see
very much difference, if any. If there had
been one single Conference, Chapter II of the
Hague Convention would presumably have
been referred to a Committee or Sub-Committee,
in which both parties, those directly concerned
and those not directly interested, would have
been represented in equal numbers. Now we
can refer this question to a delegation of both
Conferences, where both Conferences are equally
represented.
You all know now the main lines upon which
the proposal is based. They are consistent
with the decisions taken by the League and
they do not seem to impair, but rather to further,
the realisation of the principles upon which
the Hague Convention is based and which it is
the solemn obligation of all signatory Powers
to bring into effect.
The President
Translation : M. Loudon, delegate of the
Netherlands, will address the Conference.
M. Loudon (Netherlands) :
Translation : I merely wish to submit a
slight amendment to the Finnish proposal.
In the Swedish proposal which we adopted
three days ago, the word ?delegation? was
used instead of the word ?commission? . I
think that it would be more correct to use in
the Finnish proposal the term ?delegation? ,
and I believe that the French delegate will
agree with me. I propose, therefore, that the
word ?commission? be replaced by the word
?delegation ? or even ?delegation mixte?.
Translation : M. Sugimura, delegate of
Japan, will address the Conference.
IVJ. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation: In order to prevent unnecessary
confusion, I wish to state at once that I am
in favour of the Finnish proposal. I should like,
however, to submit two minor points ;
(i) I should like to ask the Finnish delegate
if the Committee will as a matter of course
examine not only the various suggestions
submitted during the recent discussions of the
Second Conference but also any proposals
which may be put forward subsequently.
IVJ. Toivola (Finland) :
Translation : Certainly.
IVJ. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : If that is so, I need not dwell
on the point.
(2) Sweden, like Japan, assisted in the draft-
ing of the fourth Assembly?s resolution. As
regards the actual principle, I agree with the
Swedish delegate that, according to the spirit
of the Hague Convention, all the various ques-
tions form one single whole.
There remains, however, a question of form :
I refer to the juridical independence of the
two Conferences, this being a point which has
been stressed by many of the delegations.
If the question of principle is satisfactorily
settled, the question of form, although it is
of secondary importance, will still have to
be dealt with.
I think that we must maintain the juridical
independence of the two Conferences, in order
that the force of the fourth Assembly?s resolu-
tions may not be weakened. On this point,
I do not suggest that there is any difference
of opinion between the Swedish delegate and
myself ; I merely wish to give my opinion.
The President
Translation : Viscount Cecil, delegate of
the British Empire, will address the Confe-
rence.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
In the first place, I should like to ask the dele-
gate from the Netherlands whether it is really
necessary for him to insist on his amendment.
I will tell him my difficulty. I do not think
there is any way of rendering in English the
distinction between a delegation and a commis-
sion. Our poor, heavy, insular minds fail to
perceive the distinction between the two,
though possibly the Scotch, who are better
metaphysicians than we are, might be able to
grasp it. Therefore, as far as I can see, even
if the word were changed in French, it would
have to remain the same in English. You can
put anything in the French text you like,
because you understand that language far
better than I do, and if in French it is more
satisfactory to use the word ?delegation? rather
than ?commission? I have no objection. As far
as the English text is concerned, however,
I object strongly a tony change in the wording,
because it would raise all sorts of questions
and doubts, whereas ?committee? is a word
which is perfectly well understood in English.
As to the point raised by the Japanese dele-
The President :


gate, I entirely agree with him that his proposals,
to which I know he has been giving a great
deal of time, ought to come before this ?Mixed
Committee?. That is clear, and I imagine
the whole Conference agrees that this Committee
is not to be confined to anything that has
actually been proposed but that any concilia-
tory proposal will be open to its consideration.
In this connection, there is just one slight
criticism of the wording which I make merely
in order to avoid any misunderstanding after-
wards. The text says : ?That Committee
shall be entrusted with examining the afore-
mentioned proposal...? What is intended, of
course, is not merely the proposal of the
American delegation but the substance of the
American suggestions dealing with the whole
question of prepared opium. The ?aforementioned
proposal , as it reads, might be construed in
a narrower sense. We desire to have the whole
matter submitted to the Committee.
I only mention that point so as to avoid any
misunderstanding. The only proposal that has
been aforementioned in this document is the
proposal to refer the matter to a Committee,
but we want all the suggestions of the American
delegation so referred, in order that they
can be compared and dealt with in view of
the discussion which has been held and the
other observations which have been made.
As to the latter part of the observations of
the Japanese delegate, I hope he will not press
this matter any further. The whole object
of this proposal is to leave on one side for the
time being the controversy that has arisen
about competence. It can be raised later if
necessary, but for the time being we do not
want to decide that question one way or the
other but to reach a practical solution in regard
to the substance of the difficulty. I agree
with him most fully that, if we can reach a
practical solution in regard to the substance
of the problem, it will be found that the
form will present very little difficulty indeed.
I hope therefore that we may now adopt this
resolution, which seems to me to command the
general assent of the Conference.
The President
Translation: I should be glad if Viscount Cecil
would state whether his proposal concerning
the amendment is a formal one.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
I did not mean to propose any modification.
I merely meant to make a declaration before
the Conference to the effect that it was not
suggested that the duties of the Mixed Committee
should be confined to dealing with the American
proposal to refer this matter to a Committee,
but rather that it should consider the whole
merits of the American proposal which was
referred to it.
The President
Translation : Then the text stands ?
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
Yes. If the word ?aforementioned? were
struck out, the text would be quite clear. I
do not care whether there is any actual amend-
ment or not, provided we are clear that no
formal or narrow restriction will be placed on
the work of this Committee but that it will
leally try to get to the bottom of the question.
(VI. Toivola (Finland)
It seems to me that, if the word ?aforemeri-
tioned is omitted, the text becomes very
much clearer. In that case, I think we ought
to say "proposals of the delegation of the United
States of America?.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) ;
I agree.
The President
Translation : M. Sze, delegate of China,
will address the Conference.
(VI. Sze (China)
Mr. President and members of the Confe-
rence, I rise to say one word and to give one
assurance to the Conference. I should like
to suggest a slight amendment to the motion
which is now before the Conference, an amend-
ment which, I am sure, will cause no difficulty
to the Conference. It is to add at the end of
the motion of the delegation of Finland the
words for consideration by these Conferences?.
Then I wish to assure the Conference as
earnestly, as sincerely and as expressly as the
words at my command will permit me, that, so
far as my delegation is concerned, we shall
make, without hesitation and without reser-
vation, the utmost efforts to work together
with the other members of the Committee and
try our best to bring its work to a successful
conclusion. I say that for several reasons.
The first is that it is only right that we should
all work for success. The second is that lam
very solicitous for the hundreds of thousands
of Chinese who are now resident in the territories
and possessions of European Powers in the
Far East where prepared opium, the use of
which is temporarily legalised, is sold, if not
exclusively, at any rate mainly, to Chinese
subjects. There is the further reason that
any improvement which is made in the condi-
tion of things in those territories and possessions
will have a most beneficial reaction on the anti-
opium work in China itself. I need not dwell
upon that point, because the first delegate of
Japan has said again and again speaking
from a rich experience that anti-opium work
done in one country reacts on the anti-opium
work in another country.
In conclusion, may I repeat that my dele-
gation will do its utmost to assist in bringing
the work of the Mixed Committee to a successful
conclusion.
The President
Translation : M. Sjostrand, delegate of
Sweden, will address the Conference.
(VI. Sjostrand (Sweden)
I rise to answer the question put to me by
the delegate of Japan. I think that the inde-
pendence of both Conferences is adequately
safeguarded in the proposal. This body of
co-ordination which has been suggested is a
delegation of both Conferences. That means
that each Conference has delegated its powers
in certain respects to that body without either
Conference sacrificing its own independence.
Of course, the decision of the Assembly stands,
and the proposal represents an effort to recon-
cile the decision of the Assembly with our
intentions in this Conference.


Translation : As no one else wishes to
speak, I call upon the Finnish delegate to give
his views on the amendment submitted by the
first Chinese delegate.
M. Toivola (Finland)
In my view, the few words that the delegate
of China would like to add at the end of the
amendment would in no way change the
substance of the amendment.
Personally, I cannot see any necessity for
adopting his amendment, but if he presses for
its adoption, I hope that we shall be able
to accept it. Its adoption would mean that,
instead of the motion ending with the words
?with the least possible delay?, the concluding
words would be ?with the least possible delay,
for the consideration of these Conferences?.
It must be understood, if the amendment is
adopted, that the added words would in no way
change our position as to the question of com-
petence.
The President
Translation : M. Loudon, delegate of the
Netherlands, will address the Conference.
M. Loudon (Netherlands) :
Translation : Mr. President, as regards the
amendment submitted by the first Chinese
delegate, I share the Finnish delegate?s opinion.
This amendment would serve no useful pur-
pose ; I would go even further and say that
it is not quite logical. If anything is to be
added, it seems to me the text should read :
?This Committee shall, with the least possible
delay, present a report to the two Conferences
in order that each Conference may examine
it?.
The President
Translation : M. Sze, delegate of China,
will address the Conference.
M. Sze (China)
Mr. President, of course lam not an expert
in European languages and Ido not always
see the finesse, the fine points, that are raised.
I submitted this little amendment in view of
what Viscount Cecil has said, unless I have
misunderstood him, and I beg him to correct
me if I have done so. I thought he said it
was understood that the result would be
reported to the Conferences and duly considered,
and therefore I that thought my amendment
was entirely in order. In order to avoid any
misunderstanding, especially as I am doing
nothing except following the lead taken by
the distinguished delegate of the British Empire,
1 think I may be pardoned for introducing this
and for asking its acceptance by the Confe-
rence.
The President
Translation : Viscount Cecil, delegate of
the British Empire, will address the Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
Out of courtesy to M. Sze, I feel bound to
reply. I find myself in entire agreement with
what was said by the delegate of Finland. I do
not think that the addition of these words makes
the slightest change in the sense of the original
proposition. I agree with him that as long
as it is understood that they have no hidden
and undisclosed meaning, which I am sure
would be far from the wish of the delegate of
China, I see no objection to their being inserted.
Personally, however, I share the view of the
representative of Finland that, as a matter
of drafting, his original phrase is better and
clearer than it would be if these words were
added. But if anyone doubts it, by all means
let them be added. Ido not mind. Of course,
if the addition were made, it would be on the
understanding expressed by the delegate of
Finland at the end of his speech.
The President
Translation : M. Daladier, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
M. Daladier (France)
Translation : I think that it would be advi-
sable, in the interests of the work upon which
we are engaged, to terminate as soon as possible
these calculations of addition, substraction and
multiplication which have perhaps taken up too
much of our time. I think I may say, without
hurting the feelings of anyone present, that
tqe Finnish delegate?s proposal came as a surprise
to no one, and that if we all searched our
pockets we should find a number of motions
designed to effect a compromise, for there is,
I think, one point on which we are unanimous :
all delegations are agreed that we must make
a determined effort if the hopes which world
opinion has placed in this Conference are not
to be deceived.
I therefore ask the Conference to take a vote
at once. If each of us, regretting that his own
motion cannot be adopted, endeavours to have
part of it inserted in the Finnish delegation?s
text, there is every likelihood that we shall
remain here for months.
I propose, then, that we should sacrifice our
own ambitions, however noble and reasonable
they may be, and should make the effort re-
quired of all assemblies, unanimously adopting,
without reservations, the text so admirably
and explicitly drawn up by the Finnish dele-
gate. Finally, I would request the Conference
to agtee that, should the text require further
elucidation, the Finnish delegation should be
left to give such explanations freely and without
hindrance.
Without, of course, venturing to advise our
President, I would ask him to put the Finnish
motion to the vote as it stands. ( Prolonged
applause.)
The President
Translation : I call upon the Hon. Stephen
G. Porter, delegate of the United States, to
address the Conference.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) :
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the
proposal offered by the distinguished delegate
from Finland meets with my approval, although
I would very much like to see it amended
as suggested by the distinguished delegate
from China.
There is, however, one enquiry which I
would like to make before stating that I am
going to vote for the resolution. As I have
repeatedly said, all that the delegation of the
United States has ever asked was that it should
The President


be heard before an appropriate Committee,
and that its proposals should be considered
by this Conference. We believe there is
nothing unreasonable in that request.
I recognise the situation in which we are as
fully as any other delegate. I would like
to enquire and so that there should be no
doubt about it I have reduced it to writing
I would like to enquire whether it is the under-
standing of the distinguished delegates of the
British Empire, France, the Netherlands, Japan,
China, India, Siam and Portugal that, if this
proposal is adopted, the Second Conference may
consider the report and may take appropriate
action in regard to it.
In other words, I can see nothing to be gained
by referring this matter to this Committee if
no action is to be taken by the Conference.
It would be time wasted and labour lost. I
make this enquiry because I am not as familiar
with your parliamentary rules as I should be.
I am assuming that the resolution contemplates
the consideration of this report by the Confe-
rence. If I am correct in that assumption,
it will be a pleasure to vote for the resolution.
The President
Translation : Viscount Cecil, delegate of
the British Empire, will address the Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
As the delegate of the United States was
good enough to address this question to me,
among other people, I can only say that, in
my own mind, it is quite clear that the
report will be considered by the Conferences.
There would be no purpose in having a report
if it were not to be considered by the Confe-
rences. It is equally clear, however, that any
objection to the proposals in that report,
whether on the ground of competence or on
any other ground, will be as much open to the
Conference or any member of it as it is at the
present time.
I do not think that the matter can be put
more clearly than that. The whole object
was to have a detailed examination and to see
whether it is possible to reach an agreement
with reference to this subject. I trust that
no questions or observations will be made
which will render it less likely that such an
agreement should be reached.
The President
Translation : I would gladly adopt the
first French delegate?s suggestion, but we must
act in accordance with the procedure generally
followed at assemblies of the League of Nations.
As I understand the position, we have to deal
with only one amendment, the Chinese amend-
ment. The substitution of the word ?delega-
tion?? for the word ?commission?? appears
to me a matter of translation rather than an
amendment. As regards the words which Lord
Cecil suggests amending, that point has been
settled, as the Finnish delegate, who submitted
the amendment in question, introduced a
modification in the text by making the word
?proposal?? plural.
The third amendment, and the only formal
one, is the amendment submitted by the Chinese
delegation, which is to the effect that the words
?for consideration by this Conference?? should be
added at the end of the last paragraph. I cannot
quite grasp the reason for this proposal. A
definite procedure is followed in all Conferences
of this kind ; reports drawn up by the organi-
sations specially appointed for the purpose
are referred to the Conference for examination.
The Chinese amendment appears to me, there-
fore, to be unnecessary.
I would ask the Chinese delegate to withdraw
it, in order to facilitate the proceedings. If
he is unable to agree to this suggestion, we
must first put the additional amendment to
the vote.
IV!. Sze (China)
Mr. President and members of the Confe-
rence, I shall be glad to agree to the request you
make and withdraw the amendment which I
proposed. I have been told by you that in
these Conferences of the League of Nations you
are guided by certain rules. I have tried to
the best of my ability to follow the Rules of
Procedure adopted by the Conference, but if
I am ignorant of any of the rules beyond those
in the rules of procedure I ask your indulgence,
should I come in conflict with those rules.
May I also be permitted to say one thing
before we vote on the proposal of the Finnish
delegation ? Since the honourable delegate for
the United States has included China among
the delegations of which he asks the question,
I wish to tell him that I believe, as has been
said by so many delegations, that when the
report comes before this Conference it will be
within the scope of the Conference to discuss
it and take appropriate action. Such is my
understanding of the position, and if that
understanding is correct 1 gladly withdraw
anything you may wish.
The President
Translation : M. Sze was acting quite in
accordance with the Rules of Procedure of the
Conference. He had every right to propose an
amendment, but it was my duty to apply to
it the ordinary rules governing assemblies.
I was entitled to ask M. Sze to withdraw his
amendment ; and, if he had been unwilling
to do so, I should have had to put it to the
vote.
IYI. Loudon (Netherlands) :
Translation : I beg to support the British
delegate?s reply to the first delegate of the
United States.
The President
Translation : If no one else wishes to speak,
we will now take a vote. Does the Conference
wish for a roll-call vote ?
{No !)
The President
Translation : I will read the text in English,
as the amendment was originally drafted in
that language :
?In suggesting that the First Opium
Conference meet in order to take a corre-
sponding decision, identical in its object,
and on condition that that corresponding
decision be adopted,
?The Second Opium Conference decides ;
?To name eight delegates, representative
of Governments who have not participated
in the First Conference, to form a Committee
with eight members designated by the
latter ;


"That Committee shall be entrusted with
examining the proposals of the delegation
of the United States of America, together
with the various suggestions and declara-
tions presented during the recent discus-
sions of the Second Conference. The Com-
mittee shall present a report to the two
Conferences on the result of its work with
the least possible delay.?
May I regard the first Finnish delegate?s
proposal as adopted, subject to the slight
amendment which he accepted, but without.
M. Sze?s amendment ?
The proposal was unanimously adopted.
The President
Translation : According to the terms of the
resolution just adopted, the second Conference
has to appoint eight delegates to sit on the Com-
mittee. I do not think that we can proceed
to the election of these delegates until we have
heard the views Conference on the subject.
I will not submit any proposal, therefore, for
the election of these members.
72. CO-ORDINATION OF THE WORK OF
SUB- COMMITTEES A, B, C AND D AND
APPOINTMENT OF A DRAFTING COM-
MITTEE : AMENDMENT PROPOSED BY
THE PRESIDENTTOTHE RESOLUTION
SUBMITTED BY THE BRITISH DELE-
GATE AND ADOPTED BY THE CONFE-
RENCE ON DECEMBER Bth ? 1924?.
The President
7 ranslation : There are still two items on
our agenda. The second is connected with
an amendment which I have the honour to
submit to you and which, I hope, will not require
discussion. It is on behalf of the Business Com-
mittee that I am submitting this amendment
to the resolution proposed by the British delega-
tion and adopted by the Conference on Decem-
ber Bth, 1924- It refers to the composition
of the Co-ordination Committee. According to
the terms of the present resolution, the Co-
ordination Committee was to be composed
of representatives of Sub-Committees A, B, C
and D, which deal more especially with tech-
nical questions. The Business Committee, how-
ever, after discussing the matter, came to
the conclusion that it would be desirable to ap-
point representatives of all the Sub-Committees
to sit on the Co-ordination Committee, and
thus widen the scope of the latter?s work.
I think the Conference will agree as to the
advisability of this measure, and I propose,
therefore, that you should modify the resolu-
tion in order that Sub-Committees E and F
may be represented on the Co-ordination Com-
mittee in the same way as the other Sub-
Committees.
Ihe text of the amendment which I propose
reads as follows :
1. That a joint meeting of represen-
tatives of Sub-Committees A, B, C, D, E
and F be held for the purpose of co-ordi-
nating the conclusions of these Sub-Com-
mittees and presenting a joint report to
the plenary Conference.
1 See Verbatim Record of the thirteenth meeting.
"Sub-Committees A, B, D, E and F shall
each nominate two members in addi-
tion to the Chairman, and Sub-Committee
C one member in addition to the Chair-
man, to represent them at the meeting.
?2. That a Drafting Committee {Co-
mite de Redaction) be appointed forthwith,
consisting of the President of the Confe-
rence and five persons to be nominated by
the President, and that this Committee
commence its work as soon as the report
of any of the Sub-Committees has been
approved by the Conference.
The amendment was unanimously adopted.
I would ask the Chairmen of Sub-Committees
E and F to nominate their members to sit
on the Co-ordination Committee.
I would also ask the Chairmen of Sub-Com-
mittees B and D to come to an understanding
with regard to one point of their decision.
Mr. Shepherd, the Australian delegate, has been
chosen by both Sub-Committees to represent
them on the Co-ordination Committee. I think
that it would be better if one of these Sub-
Committees chose another representative.
M, Chodzko (Poland) :
7 ranslation : I have discussed the matter
with Mr. Shepherd, and we have agreed that
he shall represent Sub-Committee D, v/hile the
Turkish delegate will represent Sub-Committee B.
The President
Translation : The latter therefore becomes
a member of the Co-ordination Committee.
Viscount Cecil, delegate of the British Empire,
will address the Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) ;
I want to express the hope that the Confe-
rence, notwithstanding the meeting of the
Mixed Committee which we have just appointed,
may be able to get on with the rest of its
work. I share Mr. Porter?s reluctance to tres-
pass too long on the hospitality of Geneva,
and I hope, therefore, that we may be able
to get on with our work while that matter is
being considered. I particularly hope we shall
be able to make progress with the Convention
on the use of drugs, because that is really the
most vital matter we have to consider.
I should like also to express the hope if
I may do so without impertinence, because I
am not a member of the First Conference
that the First Conference will be able to meet
without delay (either this morning or this
afternoon), so that we may be able to proceed
with the election of the members of the Mixed
Commutee this afternoon, as soon as we know
whether the First Conference, in the words of
our resolution, has taken "a corresponding deci-
sion . In that event, Ido not see why we should
not be able to elect our members this afternoon,
as it is not a complicated matter.
The President
Translation : I share Viscount Cecil?s views
as to the desirability of getting on with our
work.
1 would ask Sub-Committees E and F to
inform me of the names of the members appoint-
ed to represent them on the Co-ordination
Committee. When I have this information
1 shall be able to call a meeting of the Committee.


As regards Viscount Cecil?s second obser-
vation, I shall, of course, ask the First Confe-
rence to meet as soon as possible, in order that
it may elect the eight members to represent
it on the Mixed Committee.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I share the general desire
a very legitimate desire of members of
the Conference that we should get on with
our work, and I would venture to point out
that unless a decision is taken to the contrary
and so far no such decision has been taken
the eight members who are to represent the
Second Conference on the Mixed Committee
can only be elected by that Conference on
the proposal of the Business Committee. I
propose, therefore, in accordance with Rule 5
of the Rules of Procedure, that the Business
Committe should meet for this purpose.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios is quite right.
The Business Committee is entitled to be con-
sulted on the question now before us, but the
Rules of Procedure make no express provision
to this effect ; they simply state that the
Business Committee shall meet ? should occasion
arise?.
Dr. Carriere (Switzerland) :
Translation : I have asked permission to
address the Conference but it is not in connection
with the question now under discussion. I
simply wished to inform you that, at its meeting
yesterday, Sub-Committee F appointed two
representatives to sit on the Co-ordination
Committee ; they are M. Perrot (France) and
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium). I have already
handed in these names to you.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : What I said was that the
members of the Mixed Committee should
be appointed by the Second Conference on the
proposal of the Business Committee, unless
a decision was taken to the contrary, and that so
far no such decision had been taken. Unless a
special decision is taken, the Rules of Procedure
should be adhered to, but I do not raise any
objection to members being appointed direct
by the Conference.
Dr. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : I have just been informed that
the First Conference is to meet at 4 o?clock.
It will therefore reach some decision. This
being so, I would suggest that the Second Confe-
rence should meet in order to take cognisance
of the decision, and to vote if necessary.
The President
Translation : 1 cannot give an opinion on
that point without consulting the President
of this First Conference.
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands) (President of
the First Conference) :
There is no objection on the part of the First
Conference, which is meeting at 4 o?clock this
afternoon. Perhaps you would be able, Sir, to
convene a meeting of the Second Conference
at 6 o?clock.
Translation : I do not think that there is
any need to call a meeting of the Business
Committee for the purpose of proposing the
names of eight delegates to represent the Con-
ference on the Mixed Committee. The Confer-
ence can modify its Rules of Procedure as it
pleases, and there is no express provision
which necessitates a meeting of the Business
Committee to deal with the question now
before us. I am quite ready, however, to
accept any suggestion from members of the
Conference.
M. de Aguero y Bethancourt, delegate of
Cuba, will address the Conference.
IVI. de Aguero y Bethancourt (Cuba)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, I think that the Spanish delegate?s
remark is very much to the point. The Busi-
ness Committee could certainly submit a pro-
posal to the plenary meeting, but as we wish to
gain time and not trespass too long on the hospi-
tality of Geneva, to quote Viscount Cecil, I
think that the best plan would be for our
Conference to proceed at once to elect its dele-
gates. In deciding this, we shall not be violating
the Rules of Procedure, as this is a plenary
meeting. I propose, therefore, that the mem-
bers of the Conference should elect representa-
tives at once without consulting the Business
Committee.
There is another reason for this, and a most
important one. This Committee, which is
about to undertake a very heavy responsibility,
will have in its hands the whole fate of our
Conference. It is this Committee which must
deliver us from the deadlock that has now
existed for a month and a-half. The members
who are to sit on the Committee must search
their consciences, and each delegation must
know exactly by whom it is going to be repre-
sented.
For the above reasons, I propose that our
Conference should elect its members direct.
[Applause.)
The President
Translation : I call upon the Hon. Stephen
G. Porter, delegate of the United States of
America, to speak.
The Hon. Stephen G. Porter (United States
of America) :
I am in entire accord with the suggestion of
the distinguished delegate from Cuba. I feel
that we should follow the words of the resolution
we have just passed. It says that the
Conference is to name eight delegates represen-
tative of Governments who have not partici-
pated in the First Conference. If it was our
intention to delegate that authority to any
other body, we should have so stated it. In
the interests of accuracy, I think that we should
follow the letter of the resolution and that this
election should be made by the Conference.
The President
I think there has been some misunderstand-
ing. M. de Palacios simply pointed out that,
under the Rules of Procedure of the Conference,
the delegates could be nominated by the Busi-
ness Committee, but that as the Conference had
plenary powers it had a right to nominate
them itself.


The proposal of M. de Aguero y Bethancourt
is now before the Conference. It is that the
Conference shall nominate the eight members of
the Mixed Committee. I think that no vote
is necessary and I take it that it is unanimously
accepted.
A greed.
The next plenary meeting of the Conference
will be held at six o?clock this afternoon, and
the only item on the agenda will be the
election of the eight representatives on the
Mixed Committee.
M. Loudon (Netherlands)
Translation : I wish to ask a question. Will
the election be by countries or by individuals ?
The President
Translation : By countries.

of the First and Second Opium Con-
ferences (Committee of Sixteen) ;

73. APPOINTMENT OF THE MIXED COM-
MITTEE OF THE FIRST AND SECOND
OPIUM CONFERENCES (COMMITTEE
OF SIXTEEN) : LETTER FROM THE
PRESIDENT OF THE FIRST OPIUM
CONFERENCE.
The President
Translation : Immediately after our deci-
sion of this morning, I wrote to the President
of the First Conference, communicating to
him the resolution you had passed. I have
just received a reply from him, which reads
as follows :
?1 have the honour to acknowledge the
receipt of your letter of to-day?s date
informing me of the resolution adopted
this morning by the Second International
Opium Conference, and to acquaint you
with the fact that the First International
Opium Conference has adopted a resolution,
a copy of which I enclose, accepting the
invitation of the Second Conference to
appoint a delegation to meet a delegation
of the latter Conference.
?The delegation of the First Conference
will consist of the first delegate of each
delegation appointed to that Conference.
In the event of his absence, he may appoint
a substitute.
{Signed) van Wettum.?
Ihe text of the resolution adopted by the
First Opium Conference reads as follows :
?The First International Opium Con-
ference,
"Taking note of the resolution adopted
this morning by the Second International
Opium Conference,
Accepts the invitation to appoint a
delegation to form with a delegation of
the Second Conference a Joint Committee
which shall examine the proposals, decla-
rations and suggestions which have been
put forward by the American, British,
French and other delegations on the latter
Conference, and shall report the results
of their work to the two Conferences as
soon as possible.?
74. ELECTION OF THE DELEGATION OF
EIGHT MEMBERS TO REPRESENT
THE SECOND CONFERENCE ON THE
COMMITTEE OF SIXTEEN.
The President
Translation : The Second Conference might
immediately proceed to the election of the eight
members to represent it on the Committee of
Sixteen.
As regards the procedure for the election,
the voting will take place by secret ballot and
by roll-call.
The Rules of Procedure of our Conference
do not contain any special provisions regarding
elections. I would propose, therefore, that
we adopt the procedure already followed on
similar occasions during our debates ; this
procedure is defined in Rule 21 of the Rules
of Procedure of the Assembly of the League
of Nations, and reads as follows :
?When a number of elective places of
the same nature are to be filled at one
time, those persons who obtain an absolute
majority at the first ballot shall be elected.
If the number of persons obtaining such
majority is less than the number of per-
sons to be elected, there shall be a second
ballot to fill the remaining places, the
voting being restricted to the unsuccessful
candidates who obtained the greatest num-
ber of votes at the first ballot, not more
than double in number the places remain-
ing to be filled. Those candidates, to
the number required to be elected, who
receive the greatest number of votes at the
second ballot shall be declared elected.?


States voting
35
Absolute majority
18
The following States have obtained the follow-
ing numbers of votes :
United States
30
Brazil
Cuba
23
Egypt
23
Finland
29
Italy
25
Persia
29
Poland
I presume that you will have no objection before the Sub-Committees have completed
to adopting this procedure, as you have done theirs. The work of at least one of these
so on previous occasions.
I would draw your attention to the fact that
the voting will be for countries and not for
persons. Voting papers bearing the names of
persons will be regarded as null and void.
I have the honour to request the first dele-
gate of Persia and the delegates of Portugal
and Canada to be so good as to assist me as
tellers.
I request the Secretary-General of the Confe-
rence to take the roll-call by countries.
(The Conference then proceeded to a vote by
roll-call .)
The President
Translation : The ballot is closed. I beg
the Secretary of the Conference to be so good
as to count the voting papers.
The following is the result of the ballot :
Eight States have therefore obtained an abso-
lute majority in the first ballot. I declare these
eight States elected by the Second Conference
to be members of the Committee of Sixteen.
I will detain you only for a few minutes longer
before closing the meeting. Our work is now
distributed between three groups of Committees :
the Committee which you have just appointed,
the Sub-Committees which have not entirely
completed their work, and the Co-ordination
Committee, which cannot begin its work
Sub-Committees will be affected by the results
of the deliberations of the Committee of which
you have just elected the members. I would
therefore suggest to the eight members of the
Committee which has just been appointed that
a constituent meeting should be held as soon
as possible to elect the President and draw up
the programme of the Committee. In my
opinion, its work should not be interrupted by
the ordinary work of the Conference.
If you have any proposals to put forward,
I shall be glad to hear them.
Since nobody desires to speak, I propose that
the new Committee should meet on Monday
morning at 10 a.m.
The President?s proposal was accepted.
The President
Translation : Before closing the meeting, I
would, with the permission of the first delegate
of France, quote the memorable words spoken
by another French Minister some eighty years
ago at a time of crisis. I refer to M. Guizot,
at that time Prime Minister, ? who possessed
great wisdom and a profound knowledge of
human nature :
?The crisis is at an end ; but lam one
of those who know that in this world
nothing is ever at an end. Unceasing
work, frequently unsatisfactory, for results
which are often doubtful and always incom-
plete, such is life. I accept it without
illusions, but also without despondency.?
It is with these words that I desire to close
to-day?s meeting. I further desire to express
my sincerest good wishes for the success of
the Committee we have just appointed, and the
earnest hope that the work we have done to-day
will mark the beginning of a new era in our
Conference. ( Applause .)
The Conference rose at 6.50 p.m.

CONTENTS :
75. Withdrawal of the Delegation of the
United States of America from the

States Delegation and reply from
the President.

75. WITHDRAWAL OF THE DELEGATION
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
FROM THE CONFERENCE : LETTER
FROM THE UNITED STATES DELE-
GATION AND REPLY FROM THE PRE-
SIDENT.
The President
Translation : Yesterday, as you know, I
received a letter and note dated February 6th
from the first delegate of the United States:
It reads as follows ;
?I have the honour to inform you that, in
pursuance of authorisation of the President
of the United States, this delegation, to its
deep regret, finds itself unable longer to
participate in the deliberations of the
Opium Conference. The reasons for this
action are more fully set forth in the enclo-
sed memorandum.
?In taking leave, permit me, on behalf
of the delegation, to say that we are deeply
sensible of the consideration and kindness
of our colleagues in the Conference, and to
express to you and to the officers and Secre-
tariat our appreciation of the uniform


courtesy and the cheerful, untiring and
efficient service which have been shown to
the delegation.
{Signed) Stephen G. Porter,
Chairman.?
Memorandum.
?The League of Nations, on October
18th, 1923, extended an invitation to the
Powers signatory to the Hague Convention,
including the United States, to participate
in an International Conference which was
called for the purpose of giving effect to
the following principles, subject to reser-
vations made by certain nations regarding
smoking-opium ;
?1. If the purpose of the Hague
Opium Convention is to be achieved
according to its spirit and true intent,
it must be recognised that the use of
opium products for other than medical
and scientific purposes is an abuse and
not legitimate.
?2. In order to prevent the abuse of
these products it is necessary to exercise
the control of the production of raw
opium in such a manner that there will
be no surplus available for non-medical
and non-scientific purposes.
?The joint resolution adopted by the
Congress of the United States on May 15th,
1924, authorising our participation in the
present Conference, quoted the principles
referred to in the preamble and expressly
stipulated :
?That the representatives of the United
States shall sign no agreement which
does not fulfill the conditions necessary
for the suppression of the narcotic drug
traffic as set forth in the preamble.?
?Despite more than two months of dis-
cussion and repeated adjournments, it
now clearly appears that the purpose for
which the Conference was called cannot be
accomplished.
The reports of the various Committees
of the Conference plainly indicate that
there is no likelihood under present
conditions that the production of raw
opium and coca leaves will be restricted
to the medicinal and scientific needs of the
world. In fact, the nature of the reser-
vations made show that no appreciable
reduction in raw opium may be expected.
?It was hoped that if the nations in
whose territories the use of smoking-opium is
temporarily permitted would, in pursuance
of the obligation undertaken under Chapter
II of the Hague Convention, adopt measures
restricting the importation of raw opium
for the manufacture of smoking-opium or
would agree to suppress the traffic within
a definite period, such action would mate-
rially reduce the market for raw opium anc
an extensive limitation of production would,
inevitably follow. Unfortunately, however,
these nations, with the exception of Japan,
are not prepared to reduce the consumption
of smoking-opium unless the producing
nations agree to reduce production anc.
prevent smuggling from their territories,
and then only in the event of an adequate
guarantee being given that the obligations
undertaken by the producing nations would
be effectively and promptly fulfilled. No
restriction of the production of raw opium
under such conditions can be expected.
?In the matter of manufactured drugs and
the control of transportation, an improve-
ment over the Hague Convention is
noticeable. There is, however, no like-
lihood of obtaining a complete control
of all opium and coca-leaf derivatives.
Irrespective of the measure of control pro-
vided for manufactured drugs, it is believed
that, by reason of the very small bulk,
the ease of transportation with mini-
mum risk of detection and the large finan-
cial gains to be obtained from their illicit
handling, such drugs and their derivatives
can only be effectively controlled if the
production of the raw opium and coca
leaves from which they are obtained is
strictly limited to medical and scientific
purposes. This the Conference is unable
to accomplish.
?In the circumstances, the delegation
of the United States, in pursuance of
instructions received from its Government,
has no alternative, under the terms of
the joint resolution authorising partici-
pation in the Conference, other than to
withdraw, as it could not sign the Agree-
ment which it is proposed to conclude.
We desire to make it clear that withdrawal
from the present Conference does not
mean that the United States will cease
its efforts, through international co-ope-
ration, for the suppression of the illicit
traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs.
The United States recognises that the
world-wide traffic in habit-forming drugs
can be suppressed only by international
co-operation, but believes that for the
present, at least, greater strides in the control
of the traffic may be hoped for if it should
continue to work toward this end upon the
basis of the Hague Convention of 1912.??
I am sure that you all deeply regret the com-
munication I have just made. The first United
States delegate is leaving Geneva to-day.
By replying to his letter before his departure
and before I could notify you I felt sure
that I should be acting in accordance with the
unanimous feeling of the Conference.
This is the text of the letter which I addressed
to him :
?I have the honour to acknowledge the
receipt of your letter of to-day?s date, in
which you have communicated to me that
the delegation of the United States of
America, in pursuance of the authorisation
of the President of the United States, finds
itself unable to participate any longer in
the deliberations of the Opium Conference.
?I beg, at the same time, to acknowledge
the receipt of the memorandum enclosed
with your letter, in which you have set
forth the reason for this action. The letter
and its annex have at once been officially
circulated to all the members of the Second
Conference and sent to the Secretary-
General of the League of Nations. I shall, of
course, in the plenary meeting of the Confe-
rence which will be held to-morrow morn-
ing, draw the attention of its members to
the contents of your communications.


?I am fully convinced that this decision
taken by the United States Government
will be received with the profoundest regret
by all the delegations assembled at Geneva,
who, I feel sure, must still retain the hope
that some effective solution may be found
for the problems to which so much conside-
ration has been given during these past
weeks by us all, and, in particular, by the
American delegation.
I shall take the first opportunity of
conveying to the Conference the friendly
words you have spoken on behalf of the
delegation of the United States as to the
kindness of your colleagues at the Confe-
rence, and I shall express to the Secretary-
General and to the whole staff which has
been engaged in the work of this Conference
your appreciation of the efficient services
rendered.
?May I finally, on my own behalf, thank
you for the kind words expressed to me
personally. I am most grateful for the
loyal and efficient collaboration you have
given me in my capacity as President. I
hope that you will keep as friendly a
remembrance of our relations as I shall.
1 beg also to transmit to your colleagues
in the delegation my warmest thanks.
{Signed) Zahle,
?President of the Second Opium
Conference.?
Our co-operation with the United States
delegation has been inspired throughout these
long weeks by the most profound interest in
our work and by the most sincere desire to
attain the object at which all the delegations
here are aiming, and to accomplish a truly
humanitarian work under the auspices of the
League by perfecting what others before us
had already begun.
We have voyaged over stormy seas, but all
the members of our crew have toiled night and
day to overcome the elements to reconcile
views divergent through the very force of
facts and circumstances and by unselfish
co-operation to bring our ship safe into port.
We are within sight of land, and I even dare
to hope that we shall enter port with colours
flying. But just at this important moment
one of the most energetic of our fellow-workers
has left us. We feel his departure deeply, but
I trust that, even without his valuable aid,
we may succeed in finding an effective solution
for those grave problems with which the Confe-
rence is concerned. Our front is still unbroken
in this battle against opium. Much has been
done and much remains to be done.
We are all determined to maintain this front
intact and to make even greater efforts, acting
on the Latin adage that nothing has been done
as long as something still remains undone.
We hope, therefore, that sooner or later we
shall find ourselves again co-operating with
that great Republic in a work worthy of the
highest ideals of civilisation. {Loud applause .)
76. WITHDRAWAL OF THE CHINESE
DELEGATION FROIVI THE CONFE-
RENCE : LETTER FROM THE CHINESE
DELEGATION.
Translation : On my arrival here, a few
minutes ago, I received the following letter
from the first Chinese delegate :
?I have the honour to inform you that,
for reasons given in the memorandum
herein enclosed, the Chinese delegation is
convinced that its further participation in
the Second Opium Conference will serve
no useful purpose. May I ask that this
memorandum be communicated to the
Conference ?
It is with profound regret that my
delegation has felt constrained to take
up this position, but, in view of the failure
of the Conference to arrive at any satis-
factory agreement with regard to the mea-
sures to be taken for the suppression of the
use of prepared opium, it has felt that no
other course is open to it.
?Permit me to avail myself of this
opportunity, on behalf of my delegation,
to assure you and the members of the
Conference and the members of the Secre-
tariat of the League of Nations of our
appreciation of, and thanks for, the.courte-
sies shown to us.
{Signed) Sao-Ke Alfred Sze.?
Memorandum.
?At the twenty-third meeting of the
Conference, at the time when an adjourn-
ment of this body was moved in order that
opportunity might be given to find, if
possible, some means of elucidating and
co-ordinating the various proposals, decla-
rations, and suggestions that had been
made by different delegations with refe-
rence to the measures to be agreed upon
by the Powers here represented for the
progressive suppression of the use of pre-
pared opium in those territories and posses-
sions in which such use is still permitted
by law, the Chinese delegation had the
honour to say that, in giving its assent to
the motion, no proposal which might be
presented to the Conference would be
acceptable to China which did not give
definite assurance that, within a reasonable
period of time, the termination of which
could be clearly foreseen, the legalised
traffic in prepared opium would be brought
to an end.
?It is now apparent from the formal
proposals that have been made by the
delegations of Great Britain, France, the
Netherlands, and Portugal, and insisted
upon in the Committee of Sixteen and the
Sub-Committee of Five of that Committee,
that the Governments they represent are
not, at this time, prepared to agree to
adopt measures which will meet the desires
of the Chinese Government as thus stated.
? It is the sincere hope of China that, in the
near future, the policies of these Govern-
ments will have so altered that they can
see their way to the common adoption of
measures that will lead to the early and
total suppression of that legalised traffic
which is now bringing such misery and
moral degradation to the hundreds of
The President


thousands of the citizens of China living
within their respective territories and pos-
sessions. When that time comes, the
Government and the people of China will
be glad to co-operate to the extent of their
ability.
?The present conditions in China, which,
unfortunately, have made it impossible
for the Government of China to obtain
effective enforcement of its policy of prohi-
biting the production of opium and its
use for other than medicinal and scientific
purposes, are temporary in character. The
Government of China gives the assurance
that it will not depart from this policy
with regard to opium, and that it will, at all
times, exert all the executive and adminis-
trative power possessed by it to enforce that
policy. This the Government of China now
does, and will continue to do, independently
and without regard to the action of other
Powers. It is the hope of the Government
and the people of China that, reciprocally
with their independent effort to suppress
the production and control the use of
opium within the borders of China, the
other Powers will, on their part, make
every effort to prevent illegal traffic in
opium and narcotic drugs and progres-
sively to suppress the legalised use of
prepared opium.
?Inasmuch as it appears that those
Powers within whose territories or posses-
sions the use of prepared opium is still
permitted by law are not prepared to agree
to the inclusion, within the Convention
to be adopted by this Conference, of any
undertakings whatsoever regarding the pro-
gressive suppression of such use, and inas-
much as it is the opinion of the Chinese
delegation that the adoption of such
undertakings is essential in order fully to
effect the purposes which, as declared in
Resolution VI of the fourth Assembly
of the League of Nations, this Conference
was assembled to achieve, the Chinese
delegation deems no good purpose will be
served by its further continuance in the
Conference, and it is therefore constrained
to cease its participation therein.??
I am sure that in expressing my deep regret
at the communication just received from the
Chinese delegation, I am interpreting the una-
nimous feeling of the Conference.
I feel it my duty, in view of the terms of this
letter, to make a few observations;
M. Sze informs us that, by order of his Govern-
ment, the Chinese delegation will take no further
part in the work of the Second Opium Confe-
rence. The reasons for which the Chinese
delegation is obliged to withdraw are mentioned
in the second paragraph of the letter which
I have just read. This paragraph speaks of :
?The measures to be taken for the suppression
of the use of prepared opium
The reason for the withdrawal of the Chinese
delegation appears, therefore, to be that the
Conference seems unable to arrive at an agree-
ment with regard to the suppression of the use
of prepared opium. This reason is connected
with the question of competence, which has
never been settled by our Conference, but is
based, if I am not mistaken, on a view of the
matter different from that underlying the two
Assembly resolutions of 1923. Under the terms
of paragraph V of the first resolution, a special
conference of representatives with plenipoten-
tiary powers was convened in order to arrive
at an agreement on the question of prepared
opium. There is no need to go into further
details for the moment, but I felt it my duty,
when reading a letter which dealt with the
question of competence, to make certain obser-
vations.
I call upon M. Loudon, delegate of the
Netherlands, to speak.
IV!. Loudon (Netherlands) :
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gen-
tlemen, the news which we received yesterday
from the delegation of the United States filled
us all with consternation. The great Republic,
which since 1909 has played so large a part in
the question of opium and whose active idea-
lism is personified in such men as the late
Dr. Hamilton Wright and the worthy Bishop
Brent, has suddenly deprived us of its co-ope-
ration.
I shall always be the first to recognise the
great debt we owe to American idealism, which
the world has to thank for many noble acts
and admirable institutions. How valuable the
co-operation of the United States would have
been in bringing to a successful conclusion
the work we have undertaken here, in pursuing
which we all have the same end in view and differ
only as to the best means of combating the
scourge ! Such co-operation might have been
continued to the very end if, two years ago,
at the fifth session of the Advisory Committee
on the Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous
Drugs, a misunderstanding had not arisen
between America and ourselves concerning
the Opium Conferences. This misunderstanding
still exists. The memorandum annexed to
Mr. Porter?s letter proves it.
According to the American view, the work
of this Conference should cover the first three
chapters of the 1912 Convention, that is to
say, the questions of raw opium, prepared
opium and narcotics. The United States Go-
vernment has evidently not realised that the
reservations regarding the Advisory Committee?s
first resolution, formulated in 1923 by India,
as regards raw opium, and by the Powers which
still permit smoking, as regards prepared opium,
were intended to show that the American
principles were unacceptable to the Powers in
so far as they referred to Chapters I and II
of the Hague Convention. In practice, our
Conference could apply the American principles
only to Chapter 111, and to Chapter I in so far
as it is connected with Chapter 111, that is to
say, in so far as it concerns narcotic drugs.
Mr. Porter?s instructions, however, involved
the application of these principles to all three
chapters. India?s reservation was ignored. The
United States did not take into account the
fact that India had not accepted the American
interpretation, and, while noting the reser-
vation made by the seven Powers which still
allow opium for smoking, she insisted at this
Conference despite the fact that this last-named
reservation meant that Article 6 of the Hague
Convention (the principle of the gradual sup-
pression of prepared opium) should not be
touched that suppression should be brought
about within a fixed period. The very points
upon which an agreement was impossible formed,


in fact, the essential features of the American
proposals.
The difficulty of reaching an agreement was
still further increased by the fact that the
United States delegation was bound by rigid
instructions which admitted of no deviation
during the discussions. May I express the
opinion here at Geneva, where other similar
meetings will be held, that an international
conference necessarily implies mutual conces-
sions, frank discussion and good-will on either
side. Any international conference is doomed
to failure if one of the parties insists on imposing
its will on the others by threatening to break up
the conference instead of being prepared to
meet the divergent views and arguments
which those other parties may submit. {Ap-
plause.)
Our proceedings here have been rendered still
more difficult and almost sterile by the fact
that Mr. Porter has never taken the trouble to
explain his point of view or even to answer
the arguments of his opponents.
One point which particularly struck me in
Mr. Porter?s memorandum is that, in the case
of the consumption of drugs, he demands the
co-operation of producing countries, while, in
that of prepared opium, he not only ignores
the possibility of such co-operation but even
goes so far as to say that if production were
to be reduced the consuming countries ought
to be the first to adopt restrictive measures.
It is generally agreed that this is not in accor-
dance with the experience of the Powers
concerned, not even of Japan, as M. Sugimura
expressly stated.
The impression might very naturally be
created in League circles where, thanks to
that admirable spirit of conciliation so aptly
named ?the Geneva spirit?, so many great
international works have been set on foot
that this regrettable incident will have a detri-
mental effect on the League. This, in my
opinion, is by no means the case. Any impar-
tial and intelligent observer with a full know-
ledge of the facts must realise that, in the ques-
tion now before us, conciliation has been the
dominant feature of the whole Conference, with
the single exception of the delegation which
retired when it saw that its proposals were
definitely unacceptable to the majority. It
withdrew despite the many concessions made
in its favour and without recognising the pro-
gress which the proposals formulated at the
Conference represented in the anti-opium cam-
paign. My personal view is that if the Con-
ference, despite the reasoned objections of
so many delegations to the American propo-
sals, had gone any further as regards conces-
sions, such a sign of weakness would have
done great injury to the League.
The United States have left us, but there
is nothing to prevent our continuing our work.
It is nearing its conclusion and, in my view,
thinking people throughout the world will
realise that, despite this regrettable incident, the
two Opium Conferences have accomplished a
work which denotes real progress and which,
far from injuring the League, enhances its
prestige. {Applause.)
The President
Translation : Viscount Cecil, delegate of the
British Empire, will address the Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) ;
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, we
have had two communications read to us. With
regard to that from the Chinese delegation, the
Conference, while deeply regretting the with-
drawal of the delegation, will doubtless take
note of its assurance that the Chinese Govern-
ment intends to pursue its efforts to suppress
.the growth of the poppy, for on the success
of those efforts much depends.
With regard to the communication from the
United States delegation, I have the follow-
ing declaration to make :
The withdrawal of the members of the United
States delegation before a decision of the Opium
Conference had been given on their proposals
is much to be regretted. Their assistance in
the earlier stages of the Conference was greatly
appreciated, and it is recognised that some of
the most valuable achievements at Geneva owe
much to the vigour of American advocacy.
The statement in the American memorandum
that the Conference was called to give effect
to the principles cited therein requires modi-
fication.
It was called in pursuance of the following
resolution of the fourth Assembly of the League
of Nations :
?The Assembly, having noted with satisfac-
tion that, in accordance with the hope ex-
pressed in the fourth resolution adopted
by the Assembly in 1922, the Advisory
Committee has reported that the informa-
tion now available makes it possible for the
Governments concerned to examine, with a
view to the conclusion of an agreement, the
question of the limitation of the amounts of
morphine, heroin or cocaine and their
respective salts to be manufactured ; of the
limitation of the amounts of raw opium
and the coca leaf to be imported for that
purpose and for other medicinal and scien-
tific purposes ; and of the limitation of
the production of raw opium and the coca
leaf for export to the amount required for
such medicinal and scientific purposes,
requests the Council, as a means of giving
effect to the principles submitted by the
representatives of the United States of
America, and to the policy which the
League, on the recommendation of the
Advisory Committee, has adopted, to invite
the Governments concerned to send repre-
sentatives with plenipotentiary powers to
a conference for this purpose.?
In other words, the chief, if not the only,
object of the Conference was to discover some
means of arresting the traffic in narcotic and
other drugs of addiction, and this object has
been in a large measure attained.
The American memorandum, on the contrary,
contends that the purpose for which the Confe-
rence was called cannot be accomplished. For
this, two specific reasons, and only two, are
given. In the first place, it is said that the Powers
in whose possessions opium-smoking was tem-
porarily permitted under the Hague Convention
have, with the exception of Japan, refused to
reduce the consumption of smoking-opium
unless the producing nations agree to reduce
production and prevent smuggling from their
territories. That is a complete misapprehension.
No such refusal has ever been made or suggested.
On the contrary, the countries concerned have


repeatedly stated their purpose to reduce,
or rather to abolish, opium-smoking in their
territories, and are taking energetic steps to
that end. Unfortunately, their efforts in that
direction are nullified by the immense contra-
band trade which is done from neighbouring
countries and which, without the co-operation
of those countries, they are, in existing cir-
cumstances, powerless to prevent. This is not,
and never has been, denied. Indeed, the facts
and figures quoted as to the smuggling now
going on would make any denial hopeless.
In these circumstances, the countries concer-
ned have declined to make themselves parties
to a paper prohibition, which would be quite
ineffective until smuggling can be stopped by
the limitation of production by their neighbours.
This is in accordance with the second principle
quoted in the American memorandum, which
lays down that, in order to prevent the abuse
of opium products, the production of raw opium
must be controlled. It is also in accordance
with the best expert opinion, such as that of
Sir John Jordan, and with the experience of
the failure of attempts, in the face of smuggling,
to stop opium-smoking by prohibition, as,
for instance in the Philippines.
But the countries concerned are quite ready
to supplement the somewhat nebulous obli-
gations of the Hague Convention for the gra-
dual suppression of opium-smoking by a defi-
nite undertaking to suppress it in fifteen years
from the date when over-production of opium
by their neighbours has been so limited that
smuggling is no longer an obstacle to such sup-
pression. They are further ready to leave it
to an impartial international authority to say
when the fifteen years should start, and they
suggest that the producing countries should,
on their side, attain the required limit of
production within a definite period of years.
In the meantime, the consuming countries
will continue their utmost efforts to bring
opium-smoking to an end efforts which will be
increasingly successful as smuggling diminishes.
Moreover, the stoppage of opium-smoking among
the one or two per cent of Chinese outside
China has no bearing on the drug problem.
The other ground on which it is alleged that
the purpose of the Conference has failed is that,
without control of the production of raw opium
and coca leaves, drugs and their derivatives
cannot be effectively controlled owing to the
ease with which they can be smuggled, No
practical proposal for the control of the growth
of coca leaves has been made by anyone. The
plant grows wild in certain countries of South
America and Java, and in their present condi-
tion of population and development it is not
seen how its growth can be prevented. Beyond
the suggestion to stopping opium-smoking
which has already been discussed, only one
suggestion for controlling the growth of opium
has been made by the American delegation,
and that is a declaration that opium ought
only to be produced for medical and scientific
purposes, apart from its temporary use as
prepared opium for smoking purposes in certain
countries. On this principle there is no diffe-
rence of opinion, though, without the co-ope-
ration of the producing countries, it evidently
cannot be carried into effect. There has been
a little difficulty in adjusting it to the centuries-
old practice of eating opium in India for
semi-medical and other purposes. That diffi-
culty has not yet been dealt with by the Confe-
rence, but there is no reason to suppose that it
cannot be settled satisfactorily to all concerned.
But it is an error to suppose that the traffic
can only be controlled by controlling the pro-
duction of raw opium and coca leaves. A far
more effective way of dealing with this terrific
evil is by controlling drug manufacture. It
is therefore the more surprising that only a
passing reference is made by the American
memorandum to the great work of the Con-
ference in elaborating a Convention for the control
of the manufacture and traffic in the drugs.
That, after all, is the question which chiefly
concerns humanity, and which is first referred
to in the resolution above quoted.
In a document of some thirty or forty arti-
cles, a whole new system is to be set up whereby
the output of the various factories is to be
reported, the movement of drugs from one
country to another is to be followed and the
international traffic in them at every point
is to be closely controlled. All this is to be
under the supervision of a new international
board, which is to be empowered, if the amount
of drugs going to any particular country seems
excessive, to make recommendations to the
signatories of the Convention that no more
should be allowed by them to go there. Under
this system, it is believed that the illicit traffic
in drugs will be much more effectively brought
under control, and it is admitted that it is this
illicit traffic that is at the bottom of the appal-
ling evils of drug addiction which it is the great
object of all countries, including the United
States, to suppress. Whether this plan will
succeed, time alone can show. It is, at any rate,
a great common effort against a world evil.
All the nations which have been scourged by
the evil have combined against it. We had
hoped that that combination might have con-
tinued till the end of the Conference. Unfor-
tunately, that is not to be so. One of the
leading spirits in this cause has felt unable to
accept the solutions which we recommend.
We profoundly regret it, while recognising the
high ideals which have dictated the course
pursued by the American delegation. We should
have been stronger with them, but without
them we will still continue, confident that in
the end right will triumph
The President
Translation: M. Daladier, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
IVI. Daladier (France) :
Translation: Mr. President, ladies and gen-
tlemen, the French delegation deeply regrets
the United States delegation?s sudden refusal
to continue to co-operate in the work of the
Second Opium Conference. This decision is
the more regrettable as we have had opportunities
of appreciating the generous views and lofty ideals
of the Chairman and members of that delega-
tion. Our regret at their departure must not be
allowed to prevent us from expressing our
personal esteem and our sincere admiration for
the energy which they have displayed in their
campaign against the scourges devastating
the human race. We deplore the fact that they
decided to leave before we had really exhausted
all the possibilities of arriving at a practical
agreement combining the real and the ideal,
and before we had really considered all the


means of reconciling views divergent rather
than fundamentally different.
Nevertheless, as our President so eloquently
said, however regrettable the American deci-
sion may be, it must not, and indeed cannot,
be allowed to discourage us. Our duty towards
the whole world is clear, and the need for our
efforts is as great as ever indeed, even greater.
When I weigh the full meaning of the United
States memorandum and take into account the
criticisms and objections, as well as the posi-
tive principles set forth in it, I find fresh reasons
for encouragement and action. It is easy to
understand that the United States delegation,
holding the views that it did, was unlikely
to adapt itself to an international conference
intended not only to proclaim the higher inte-
rests of civilisation but also to take into account
the very concrete and various realities which even
the noblest idealism must respect if it is not
to result in mere illusions and vain hopes.
Mr. Porter hoped to obtain a threefold result
at Geneva :
(i) An immediate and considerable re-
duction in the quantity of raw opium and
coca leaves produced throughout the world,
pending the strict limitation of such pro-
duction to medical and scientific require-
ments ;
(2) An immediate reduction in, and the
gradual abolition of, the consumption of
prepared opium, pending total abolition ;
(3) A strict control of the manufacture
and distribution of narcotic drugs, in order
that the present abuses might immediately
be rendered virtually impossible.
But a thorough investigation of these three
great problems revealed to Mr. Porter obstacles
which, despite our best efforts, he too hastily
concluded were insurmountable. The countries
in which the poppy and coca are grown explained
that they could not put a stop to this production
too suddenly and thus deprive their nationals
of their means of livelihood, without risking
economic and agrarian disturbances, the poli-
tical consequences of which might be very
serious.
As it is impossible suddenly to put a stop to
the free and in some cases unlimited
production of raw opium, the consumption of
prepared opium must necessarily continue for
some time to come. No doubt, in the view of
the United States delegate, if it were agreed
?to suppress the traffic within a definite period,
such action would materially reduce the market
for raw opium, and an extensive limitation of
production would inevitably follow?. Mr.
Porter, however, does not take into account the
illicit traffic in opium from which the consuming
countries bordering on the producing countries
have so often suffered in the past and are still
suffering to-day. ? It was only too easy to show
him, by means of facts and figures, to which no
reply has yet been made, that this illicit traffic,
as long as it persisted to any considerable
extent, would render any measures taken to
restrict consumption not only futile but even
dangerous.
Yesterday, again, I quoted facts and referred
to official Chinese documents in my possession
proving that the Chinese authorities compel
the population, on pain of fines, imprisonment
and even worse penalities, to extend the culti-
vation of the poppy.
1 had hoped that Dr. Sze, the first Chinese
delegate, would give an answer this morning
to these specific facts, which cannot be denied.
Unfortunately, the Chinese delegate has also
withdrawn from the Conference. My regret
is threefold : that this Conference should be
deprived of the assistance of so remarkable
an orator ; that I should not have his reply
to my questions, and, above all, that I should
now be unable to deliver a little speech I had
intended for his ears.
However this may be, the lengthy discus-
sions to which these difficult questions gave rise
led Mr. Porter and M. Sze to think that this
Conference was not able to bring about ?a
complete control of all opium and coca-leaf
derivatives?.
We who have considered these problems in
the light of more positive data and who think
that progress is to be achieved not by a stroke
of the magician?s wand but step by step are
in no wise discouraged. We did not place our
hopes so high and thus do not share the American
delegation?s disappointment. We feel, on the
contrary, that we are on the eve of great results,
and our regret at Mr. Porter?s departure is
the greater on that account. He himself admits
that, as regards manufactured drugs, marked
progress has been made on the Hague Conven-
tion. That Convention, which has formed the
basis of our discussions, will be strengthened
not only as regards drugs but also as regards the
limitation of the production of raw opium and
the use of prepared opium.
I am convinced that it is the firm intention
of the producing countries from this time on-
ward to control, to restrict and eventually
to suppress cultivation intended for illicit
purposes, and I most sincerely hope that Chap-
ter I of the American proposals may be inclu-
ded and accepted, without too serious modifi-
cations., in the conclusions of this Conference.
As regards the consuming countries, they
will undertake to abolish, within a fixed period,
and under the vigilant control of the League,
the use of prepared opium ; if they can go no
further now, it is because it is their duty not
to enter into any obligations which the cannot
conscientiously promise to fulfil.
Let us, then, continue our work, which is
nearing a successful conclusion and will
undoubtedly render great service to all mankind.
[Applause)
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Veverka, the
Czechoslovak delegate, to address the Confe-
rence.
M. Veverka (Czechoslovakia)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, I feel a certain diffidence in rising
after hearing the eloquent speeches which so
clearly describe the present position and make
all recapitulation and unfortunately all
recrimination superfluous.
Certainly, the net results of the Conference
up to date are far from unsatisfactory. We have
done a good piece of work in drafting with the
active co-operation of all the delegations, the
Convention against dangerous drugs. This, in
my opinion, was the real purpose of our Con-
ference.


On occasion we have also served, if I may so
put it, as a corrective to the final proceedings
of the First Conference, by allowing the complex
and difficult question of the production of
opium and prepared opium to mature. I am
persuaded that we have brought the accom-
plishment of our ideal many years nearer.
This I have no doubt is the view of all pre-
sent. There remains for us, however, another
task, the difficulties of which I will not seek to
conceal : it is to convince public opinion
throughout the world that our work has been
successful. Public opinion is a very uncertain
factor and is sometimes too much inclined to
judge by appearances and to form hasty conclu-
sions on false analogies. It is our duty to take
active steps to dissipate any such misunder-
standings.
I appeal, therefore, first and foremost to our
colleagues and fellow-workers, the journalists
present here, who play so great a part in forming
public opinion throughout the world. I call
upon them to lend us their valuable aid in this
difficult task. I am sure, Mr. President, that
we delegates will do all that lies in our power,
by stating the facts fairly and frankly, to pre-
vent public opinion from being misled, and that
we shall thus dispel the disappointment which
might so easily arise. Our duty is the more
imperative inasmuch as this disappointment
would be proportionate to the hopes placed
in the Conference. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Buero, the
delegate of Uruguay, to address the Conference.
IVI. Buero (Uruguay) :
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gen-
tlemen, the Uruguayan delegation is in full
agreement with the views of the British, French
and Czechoslovak delegates and associates
itself with their expressions of regret at the
absence of the United States delegation just
when its co-operation was most required to
bring our difficult work to a successful conclu-
sion.
My object in speaking now is not only to
associate myself with the unanimous views of
the Conference concerning the regrettable
departure of the United States delegation.
It is rather to submit a reservation on the
remarks which we have just heard here concerning
the interpretation to be placed on the action
of the United States.
I have the greatest respect for the views
expressed, but I think that this is hardly the
moment just when the United States
delegation is leaving Geneva to give an
opinion on its attitude or the admissibility of
its interpretation of the question of competence,
as it is not present and cannot reply with
regard to questions which it considers should
be dealt with differently. Such discretion
is the more desirable as I am perfectly sure
that the United States Government and people
will not refuse to give us their co-operation in
the near future when further efforts are made
to set the world free from the drug scourge.
[Applause.)
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Ferreira, the
Portuguese delegate, to address the Conference.
IVI. Ferreira (Portugal)
Translation: Mr. President, ladies and gen-
tlemen, the Netherlands, French and British
delegates have summed up the situation with
such precision that further comment is super-
fluous. I would simply ask you to note that the
Portuguese delegation has tried to make some
contribution to the humanitarian and practical
work with which we are dealing, by submitting
to the Committee of Sixteen a proposal
representing a compromise between the different
points of view.
At the present juncture, we cannot do better
than support what has been said by the represen-
tatives of the countries more directly interested
than ourselves in the question of opium.
In all fairness, however, we must do justice
to the idealism of the great American Republic,
which is revealed in the principles laid before
us by its delegation. Our discussions have proved
that those principles are accepted by all of us.
It is only the question of the means to be employed
that divides us. We trust that the differences
of opinion existing between the various countries
will disappear in the course of subsequent mee-
tings, after we have gone more deeply into the
problems for which we are seeking a solution.
The President
Translation : There is no one else on my
list to speak, and if no one else wishes to do so,
I shall regard the discussion on the first item
of our agenda as closed. I think that it would
be best to adjourn the other two items until
this afternoon.
Before concluding the proceedings, I would
add that I consider myself authorised by the
Conference to reply to the first Chinese dele-
gate?s letter on the lines of my reply to the
American delegation?s letter. [Assent.)
The Conference rose at 12.50 p.m.

77. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORTS OF
THE SUB-COMMITTEES : STATEMENT
BY THE PRESIDENT.
The President
Translation : This afternoon we will proceed
to the discussion of the second item on our agenda,
namely, the examination of the reports of the
Sub-Committees.
Before we begin this examination, permit
me to say that, in my opinion, to-day?s discus-
sion on these reports must refer to the principles
embodied in them and not to their actual
texts. Any votes that are taken will be taken
on the principles involved.
In accordance with the resolution adopted
by the Conference it is necessary that the
reports should be adopted in order that the
Drafting Committee may officially begin its
work. It is therefore of the greatest import-
ance for the result of the work of this Confe-
rence that the Drafting Committee should
know that you approve the principles embodied
in these reports.
This should, therefore, in my opinion, be
the object of our work to-day.
A greed.
78. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
SUB-COMMITTEE A.
The President
Translation : Let us begin with the exami-
nation of the report of Sub-Committee A
(Annex 19).
I call on Sir Malcolm Delevingne, the Rap-
porteur of this Sub-Committee, to address
the Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Rapporteur :
As the Sub-Committee, which was entrusted
with the consideration of the first part of the
Advisory Committee?s proposals, was forced
to abandon the scheme suggested by the
Advisory Committee and to substitute a new
scheme framed on different lines, it has sub-
mitted for the consideration of the Conference
a rather full report explaining both the general
outlines of the scheme and commenting on the
more important details of it. It is unnecessary,
therefore, for me to say anything by way of
explanation regarding the proposals of the
Sub-Committee at this moment ; but, of
course, as Rapporteur, I shall be happy to deal,
if I can, with any question which may be raised
upon the report.
I ought to say, however, that there are some
differences on points of detail in regard to the
constitution of the proposed Central Board
and the supply of statistics by the signatory
Governments, between the recommendations of
Sub-Committee A and the recommendations of
Sub-Committees B and D. Those differences
have been discussed at a meeting of the Co-
ordination Committee and, I believe, have been
satisfactorily settled. I understand that Sub-
Committees B and D are prepared to accept
the recommendations as contained in the report
of Sub-Committee A.
The President
Translation : The discussion is open on the
report of Sub-Committee A. Does anyone
wish to speak on the principles contained in
this report ?
As no one has any remarks to make, I will
consider the report of Sub-Committee A adopted
in principle by the Conference.
This report will be forwarded to the Drafting
Committee.
79. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORTS OF
SUB-COMMITTEE B.
The President
Translation : We have two reports of
Sub-Committee B to examine (Annexes 20 and
21).
I call on M. Dinichert, Rapporteur for the
first report, to address the Conference.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland), Rapporteur :
Translation: The report before you (Annex 20)
has the doubtful privilege of seniority. It is
indeed by far the oldest of the reports which
you will be called upon to consider this after-
noon. I only point out this fact in order to
excuse its antiquated appearance.
You will notice or you would notice if
you were reading it that a part of the report,
Items 3, 4, 5 and 6, have merely a documentary
interest, because, at the beginning of December
last year, when this part was discussed, Sub-
Committee B had to deal with a certain number
of proposals put forward by the Advisory
Committee and also by the delegation of the
United States of America. These proposals,
however, have now merely an historic value,
because subsequent investigations, particularly
in Sub-Committee A, appear to show that these
proposals could not and should not be retained.
With regard to the points to which I have to
refer, there are, in fact, only two of interest,
and these agree in their essentials with two
proposals also submitted by Sub-Committee A.
These refer, on the one hand, to Customs sta-
tistics, and, on the other, to statistics relating
to stocks.
As our President has rightly requested us
not to enter into unnecessary details but to
refer only to general principles, I think I may
conclude by stating that these two questions,
which were adopted in principle as regards
Sub-Committee A, may be considered as accep-
ted also with regard to the work of Sub-
Committee B. It is true that there are diffe-
rences as regards the period of grace, and there-
fore this report is the only one that has been
discussed by the Co-ordination Commission ; but
the Conference may possibly consider that this


question of the period of grace, without being a
drafting matter, may, in present circumstances,
be referred to the Drafting Committee. It will
rest with this Committee then to find the best
solution among the various periods of grace
proposed, perhaps an average period. We
shall then be able to go into the question of
periods of grace more fully when the Drafting-
Committee brings us its proposals.
If you are of my opinion, I may consider my
statement as concluded. I should like to add,
like Sir Malcolm Delevingne, that if you wish
for more detailed information I shall be glad
to see that this report has aroused a certain
interest and shall be entirely at your disposal
to answer any questions that may be raised.
The President :
Translation : Ihe discussion on the first
report of Sub-Committee B is open. Does
anyone wish to speak on this report ?
As no one wishes to speak, I regard it as
adopted in principle by the Conference and
referred to the Drafting Committee.
We will now examine the second report of
Sub-Committee B (Annex 21). I call on Mr.
Shepherd, the Rapporteur, to speak.
Mr. Shepherd (Australia), Rapporteur :
I do not think it is necessary for me to make
any comments on this report. It speaks for
itself. . ......
There are only two points which will require
specail consideration the proposal for the
appointment of a commission of enquiry and
investigation of a general character, and the
proposal for the appointment of a committee
of enquiry in regard to the Persian position,
in particulra. At this stage of the proceedings,
I do not think it is necessary for me to make any
further remarks on the report.
The President
Translation : The discussion on this report
isopen. , T ... , ,
Mr. Clayton, delegate of India, will address
the Conference.
Mr. Clayton (India) :
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Sub-
Committee B has altogether failed to come to
any definite decision on an important pait of
its agenda and that, I piesume, is why the
Rapporteur did not mention that point in
speaking just now. There is, in consequence,
no recommendation before the Conference as
to the amendment of Chapter I of the Hague
Convention. The delegation which put for-
ward a proposal for the amendment of Article
I has, to the great regret of us all, a regret
which the Indian delegation shares to_ the full,
ceased to take part in our deliberations. In
those circumstances, some statement seems
desirable from the Indian delegation explaining
why, though the present world position as
regards opium production is admittedly most
unsatisfactory, that delegation has taken the
lead in opposing any alteration of the present
Article I.
I have no wish to reopen the question of
competence. I simply say that, had India
been given full warning that the question of
the production and internal consumption of
raw opium would be raised in the Confeience,
she might have examined the question and
might have been able possibly to make useful
auggestions. Faced suddenly with a question
which goes to the very root of the opium admi-
nistration in a country containing 320 million
people, it was impossible for the delegation
to do more than defend the present position.
I desire to say very clearly that that position
of defence concerns only the internal ques-
tion.
As regards the external question, the ques-
tion of external trade, I wish to say as clearly
as I can that if, at any time in the course of the
discussions in Sub-Committee B, there had
been any indication that the addition of the
two words ?for export?? to the American
proposal would have proved acceptable, they
would have been readily accepted by my
delegation. I desire to say again that, if it
is desired to make the same proposal here, no
objection will be raised on the part of the Indian
delegation.
I would ask the Conference to consider for
a moment the world position when the Hague
Conference first met. There were two main
producing countries, India and China. India
had been slowly evolving her monopoly system
for a hundred years and was steadily improving
it. Good results were being obtained. Only
twenty years before, her methods had been
thoroughly approved by a Royal Commission.
China was embarking on a policy of prohibition
apparently with success. Two different policies
working on different lines were before the Hague
Conference. The policy adopted by the Confer-
ence was to trust the producing nations to
work out their own systems. They were asked
to control production and consumption, to
suppress abuses and to prevent contraband.
That obligation India accepted and has always
fulfilled.
Now, after twelve years, China, for unfortu-
nate reasons of which we know, has gone back,
but India has made progress. Her control
over opium consumption in her vast territories
is equal to that of European nations. Her
contraband is insignificant. Her internal con-
sumption has been very greatly reduced. If
you will turn to the summary of information
supplied to this Conference (Document O. D.
C. 1. (1) ), you will see that the consumption
per head has fallen to 1.14 grammes that is, to
17.72 grains. Now, the morphine content of
Indian opium is about 8 per cent as against
12, 14 or 16 per cent in the case of opium used
in Western countries. For the purposes of
comparison, the Indian figure should there-
fore be reduced by one-third and stand at
about 0.74 grammes, that is, nearly 0.5 grammes
less than Switzerland, and less also than several
other countries, in none of which has there
ever been any suggestion that a drug problem
exists.
This is not all. India is predominantly an
agricultural country. Her stock of cattle is
enormous. The Government regularly takes
a cattle census, a thing which, I think, is not
done in most European countries. We know,
therefore, that there is in India to every two
of the human population one head of cattle
or horses.
Opium is the main veterinary drug used by
the Indian people. The dose in the case of
horses or cattle, which in India are liable to
colic and other diseases, is larger than in the
case of human beings. It is fair, therefore,
to make a further reduction, and if we put


that reduction at one-third vve get the figure
of actual human consumption of approximately
half a gramme per head per annum.
I do not want to make any invidious com-
parisons, but it is worth noting that this figure
is less than the figures reported in the document,
to which I have just referred, for the United
States, for England, for Sweden, Canada,
Finland or New Zealand, and it is only a few
hundredths of a gramme more than the figure
fixed the other day by Sub-Committee F of
this Conference for the legitimate needs of
European countries possessing a highly deve-
loped system of medical assistance.
These are the results obtained by the Indian
system, of which the Indian Government and
the Indian people are justly proud. The other
day one of the delegations made a remark
which I did not take up then, nor do I wish
to take it up now. I only wish to say that
if any nation thinks that there is any discredit
in standing side by side with India in achieve-
ment under the Hague Convention it is a dis-
credit which that nation will have to bear.
For, Mr. President and gentlemen, we are
already by the side of Western nations, and
we propose to stop there. If anything, we hope
to outdistance them.
I have said that the international position
with regard to opium production is unsatis-
factory. I do not deny that, but what is
the cause of it ? I venture to say it is due to
the fact that other nations have either not
signed the Hague Convention or, having signed
it, have found it impossible to carry it out.
Certain nations have signed it so recently that
they have not had time to evolve any efficient
system for fulfilling their obligations. I suggest
that the right course is not to make India alter
her system but to ask these other producing
nations to follow the Indian example in their
own way. Let them work out their own
system, and they will, we hope, have the same
success as we have had in India.
I have been asked why, if India has so nearly
reached the medical standard of Western
countries, she cannot now accept the medical
and scientific test of consumption.
That is a fair question. If I am to answer
it, the Conference must pardon me if I describe
for a moment the position as it is in India.
A great English statesman has said that one
should use large maps. If you desire to con-
sider the question of opium in India you will
require a large map. India is not a country ;
it is a continent. It has a population of 320
million people. It is not a country of towns ;
it is a country of villages scattered about in
all parts of that vast territory, inhabited to
a large extent by small agriculturists, each
working a tiny holding, or by persons engaged
in occupations subsidiary to agriculture, who
are subject to all the hundred-and-one tropical
diseases which infest undeveloped tropical lands.
As the Conference is well aware, there are not
only diseases like fever and malaria but also
diseases of the intestines, such as cholera,
dysentery, diarrhoea, colic, and many others
which I might mention, and these diseases
are very, very frequent. For all these diseases
during the last 400 years the Indian peasants
and the Indian population generally have
found in opium a household remedy.
In the course of this Conference the utility
of opium as a medicine for such diseases has
been disputed. As regards malaria, those who
wish to dispute its utility would do well, I
think, to read a most interesting account of
the use of opium in this connection which is
contained in the report of the Royal Commission
on Opium. It was there pointed out that Indian
opium contains a large proportion of anarcotine,
a product which is so valuable as a febrifuge
that about a hundred years ago, when there
was a shortage of quinine, the Government of
India actually extracted that anarcotine and
served it in bulk to its dispensaries as a febri-
fuge. With regard to other diseases, the value
of opium is admitted everywhere. If further
proof were needed, I could point to a reference
in an official report issued in 1924 in the United
States. In remarking on the large number of
opium addicts in the southern States of America,
it is especially noted that this large number can
be accounted for by the known value of
opiates in treating diarrhoeal diseases.
There is a further point which I would like
to mention, and that is the experience of
Europeans in India. Young Europeans going
out to India for the first time are subjected
to a very strict medical examination, and I
suppose the same thing applies in all other
tropical countries. It might therefore be
said that they represent plus Ai class among
the human population of their homeland.
Nevertheless, the mortality from these tropical
diseases among young men who go out and
not only young men but men who live in the
East at all stages of their lives and stay out
there is very large. One of the first
recommendations made to any young man who
goes to India is that he should keep a bottle of
chlorodyne in his pocket for treatment in
diseases. I have here a one-ounce bottle
of chlorodyne which I purchased, in Geneva
the other day ; it contains 300 milligrammes
of morphine, equal to 3 grammes of Indian
opium. That is the amount consumed in one
year by six average Indians.
Speaking for myself personally, so long as
I am in England, I do not bother to keep a
supply of opium. After all, one can always
find a chemist, and tropical diseases are not
common. I expect a good many members of
this Conference, when they require medicine,
go and buy it at the chemist?s. In India the
chemist is far away ; one cannot be sure of
him ; and therefore one always keeps some
chlorodyne at hand.
One of the first things I do on arriving in the
East is to pay a visit to a chemist?s shop,
so that I may be sure that, whatever else may
be or may not be among my household drugs,
at any rate opium will be there.
Now, if that is the rule for the European
population living temporarily in the East, why
should it not also be the rule for the indigenous
inhabitants of the same country ?
That is the basis of the medical or semi-
medical use of opium in India. There is
further what might be called the non-medical
use. We call it non-medical, because it is
difficult strictly to bring it within any medical
definition. It may be compared with the use
of alcohol in Western countries. Many elderly
men, or men as they advance towards middle
age, find it increasingly difficult to keep up
with younger men, and in India they take a
small dose of opium in the evening. Again, a
man comes in tired, worn out, wet through,


and cold from his work ; he is a poor man and
he has to be ready for work next day. Well,
he takes a little opium in the evening, and the
result is that he is fit for work next day. Many
such cases could be quoted. It is difficult to
bring them under the heading of ?medical?,
though in a sense they are medical, but they
occur with great frequency all over India.
I will not go further into the question of the
non-medical use of opium. Let me summarise
it by repeating to the Conference the actual
findings of the Royal Commission on Opium
in 1893. I would point out to the Conference
that one of the members of that Commission,
which published a unanimous report, was one
of the leading members of the Council of the
British Anti-Opium Society. These are the
words of the report :
?We have made exhaustive enquiry into
the consumption of opium in India and its
effects. We find no evidence of extensive
moral or physical degradation from its use.
?Opium is extensively used for non-
medical and quasi-medical purposes, in
some cases with benefit, and for the most
part without injurious consequences. The
non-medical uses are so interwoven with
the medical uses that it would not be
practicable to draw a distinction between
them in the distribution and sale of the
drug.?
Then there are certain social and religious
customs in which opium plays a part. These,
as might be expected, are very various when
the population is as large as that of India. I
will not go into them in detail. The Conference
will understand that it is very difficult, if not
impossible, for a central Government to interfere
with such customs.
These remarks, I think, will give the Confe-
rence some idea of the position in 1813 1813,
not 1913- Prohibition had then been tried
and failed. There was a very strong public
opinion against the abuse of opium. There
is still. The Government started work on the
lines of public opinion and introduced a strict
monopoly control from the producer to the ulti-
mate consumer.
At the present time, all opium in British India
is grown on account of the Government and it
is sold to the local Governments by the central
Government. The local Governments supply it
to the Government licensees, and from the
Government licensees it reaches the actual
consumer. The system is a Government system,
an official system, throughout.
It has been suggested that we are wrong
because we have a Government system and not
a system working through medical or veterinary
practitioners and chemists. No alternative
system is practicable in the situation that now
prevails. There are no doctors, strictly speak-
ing. I know of administrative districts con-
taining sometimes more than a million souls
in which there may be one, and perhaps not
even one, doctor qualified according to Western
standards, and his time is fully Occupied in
the hospital in the central town. Over a very
large portion of its area there are no doctors
as doctors are understood in Europe, and I
would point out to those who are pressing for
this system of control by doctors and chemists
that the acceptance of a doctor or a chemist
as the judge of what drugs a man should take
is, even in Western lands, of very recent growth.
Even now it is not entirely accepted. There
are anti-vaccinationists, who do not accept
the doctor?s opinion, and there are Christian
scientists who are known to disregard it. There
are many other sects who by no means have
agreed to surrender their right of choice to that
of the doctor or the chemist.
It is true, however, that in the West people
do accept doctors and chemists as a reliable
agency for supplying them with drugs. At the
same time, you will find everywhere and
in the papers before this Conference the demand
is clear a demand that drugs in small quan-
tities, even opium in small quantities, shall
be available for those who want them, without
any great restriction, and that chemists should
be able to sell them in small quantities to people
who want them for urgent treatment. The
urgency of the treatment is an important matter.
If the distances are enormous, as they are in
India, if the doctor is fifty or a hundred miles
off, he is of no use to you. The treatment for
all these tropical diseases has to be given
quickly. Whether the patient be an animal or
a human being, it will be too late if the remedy
cannot be applied here and now 7 . The result
is that, where there are no doctors or chemists,
the only control possible is the control of the
Government ; the only doctor known to
the people is Dr. Custom. They treat them-
selves as their forefathers taught them, and
there is no other method which they will
accept. It seems to me that there is no objec-
tion to that so long as no abuses occur, and the
Government of India has found that by close
Government control, by raising prices, and by
perfecting its monopoly it has by slow degrees
so reduced the abusive use that it could finally
arrive at the results which have been obtained
to-day, that is to say, that the human per capita
consumption is on a level with that in European
countries.
The only question, to my mind, appears to
be whether the system is in fact efficient. I
have told you the results, and given figures for
the human per capita consumption. I have
told you that in 1893 the Indian system was
examined and approved by a Royal Commission.
You are aware that in 1912 the position was
explained to the Hague Conference and the
Indian system was accepted by that Confe-
rence.
Further, I can tell you that during the past
year a careful examination of the whole system
was carried out on behalf of the Servants of
India, a nationalist society of moderate views,
by no means dependent upon the Government.
The articles in which the results of that enquiry
are contained appeared in the Servants of India
newspaper and are very interesting. The gene-
ral conclusion of the author, Mr. Kodanda Rao,
was that there was nothing to find fault with
in the Indian Government?s policy. He admit-
ted that everything was not perfect, and in
that the Government of India would agree.
There are still, no doubt, some abuses, but in
what country are there not abuses ? He points
out what is perfectly true, that the remedy
for those abuses lies in the hands of the Legis-
lative Councils of the various provinces, to
which, by the Government of India, the control
of opium has now been transferred. If, there-
fore, in any province in India public opinion
desires to go further than the present Indian


system, that opinion has only to make itself felt
through the polls and it will be in a position
to obtain the end desired.
I do not claim that there are no abuses of
opium in India. No doubt there is much to
be done ; we have still a long way to go.
What I do claim, however, and I desire to
claim it with all the assurance at my command,
is that, inasmuch as in India contraband has
been reduced to very small proportions, all
such abuses as exist are definitely and closely
confined within the average human consumption
of half a gramme per annum, or one-sixth of
the opium contained in an ounce bottle of
chlorodyne. In view of this fact, I put it to
the Conference that no case whatever can be
established for scrapping the well-established
system of control in India. On the contrary,
from considerations of efficiency and humanity,
there appears to be every reason why that system
should be retained.
I have not exhausted the case of the Govern-
ment of India, but I fear that I have exhausted
the patience of the Conference. Before I sit
down, I desire to make an appeal to my
colleagues not to their idealism, but to their
statesmanship. Is it even a priori probable
that an identical system of control can be applied
with equal efficiency alike in producing and
consuming countries, in countries of the West
and in countries of the East, in countries with a
highly developed social organisation and in
countries where the life of the people proceeds
on much more primitive lines ?
It has been shown that in the case of India
(and it is probably true also of other producing
countries) the medical organisation, which is
the very foundation of the method proposed
by the United States and other Western coun-
tries, is almost wholly non-existent. It has
been shown that in India, by another method,
by direct Government control, results equal to
those of the United States have been obtained.
Surely, then, the only statesmanlike plan open
to the Conference is that, in producing countries
at any rate, the choice of method should be left
to the decision of the particular State concerned.
Let there be a universal aim the suppres-
sion of the abuse of opium. Let there be a
universal obligation to enact effective laws and
regulations to secure that aim. Let there be
a universal test of the efficiency of these laws
and regulations, namely, the figure of annual
consumption per head of human beings. Let
a central board, if necessary, apply that test
and publish the results for the world to know.
But, as to the actual tenor of the laws and regu-
lations to be enacted, let each State be free to
enact them in the manner which is best applic-
able to its own particular local circumstances.
That, gentlemen, was the conclusion of the
Conference which preluded the Hague Conven-
tion of 1912, and it will, I trust, also be the deci-
sion of the Second Opium Conference of I9 2 4~
1925.
The President
Translation : If 1 have understood you
correctly, you wish to ask the Drafting Com-
mittee to prepare the text for putting into force
Chapter 1 of the Hague Convention, adding the
words "for export" to the proposal that has
been made.
Mr. Clayton (India) ;
The view of the Indian delegation is that, as
no recommendation has been made by the Sub-
Committee, no change will be made in the
present wording. That is the position which
the Indian delegation would prefer.
In the course of my speech, I stated that if,
at any moment in the past, anyone had
expressed, or if in the future anyone should
express, the desire to move the United States
proposal, plus the words "for export", then
in that case the Indian delegation would have
no objection.
The President
Translation : M. Falcioni, delegate of Italy,
will address the Conference.
M. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : I appreciate the statements
made by the Indian delegate, who has accepted
the United States proposal with regard to the
first article. I understand perfectly the special
conditions obtaining in India which suggested
the amendment proposed, but, in view of the
fact that these conditions do not exist in other
countries, I would request him not to insist on
this amendment in the interest of the
success of this Conference.
On behalf of the Italian delegation, I beg to
submit the following declaration :
"The Italian delegation regrets its inabili-
ty to associate itself with the Indian
delegate?s proposal, and is of opinion that
no change should be made in the text of
the American proposal, although each State
should have the right of adhering thereto
with any reservations it may judge advis-
able."
The President
Translation : 1 understand the Italian decla-
ration to mean that the Italian delegation
endorses the American proposal.
IYI. Falcioni (Italy) ;
Translation : That is so.
The President
Translation : M. Chodzko, delegate of
Poland, will address the Conference.
IVI. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : I wish to state at the outset,
with regard to the discussion on the work of
Sub-Committee B, that as this work is finished,
I regret to say, not very happily, I resume my
freedom of action.
I have some remarks to make in reply to
Mr. Clayton?s speech, for, as a delegate of my
Government and as a doctor, I cannot pass
over in silence some of his remarks. I recently
stated that it is very dangerous to enter into
medical discussions in the plenary meetings
of this Conference. As my humble advice
was not accepted, I am compelled to speak on
this subject.
Mr. Clayton bases his arguments on quota-
tions from the report of the Royal Commission
of 1893. As you see, this is an old report, and
since that time medical science has made great
progress. Naturally, I do not deny the good
intentions of the members of that Commission,
but the results of their work correspond with the
state of science at that period. Now, however,
the question has assumed a different aspect.
Moreover, after examining this report care-


fully, I cannot agree with Mr. Clayton that it
was adopted unanimously, and I would like to
draw attention to the adverse vote of one
member of the Royal Commission, Mr. Wilson,
member of the British Parliament. This vote
is of particular interest.
I will pass over many questions which are
of no interest to this Conference, and will merely
draw attention to the passage relating to the
effect of opium on malaria. Mr. Clayton men-
tioned a certain product called ?anarcotine.?
In this same report we read that the Indian
Medical Department had, even at that time,
put a stop to the production of this prepa-
ration, because quinine was recognised as a
much more effective remedy against malaria.
We read in this report that the doctor who
had discovered this drug, which was a consti-
tuent of opium, had first called it ?narcotine?.
As this name had given rise to suspicion among
the people, he changed it and called the drug
?anarcotine?, as you may see on page no of
the report. This fact is characteristic, and
shows us the real sentiments of the people
with regard to narcotic drugs.
I will pass over the other arguments regard-
ing dysentery, etc. This disease is known
in every country, but it is no justification for
free traffic in opium. I would also like to
draw your attention to an expression which
appears to me to be somewhat strange, viz.,
?semi-medical?. I must point out that this
expression is not known to medical science ;
a thing is either medical or non-medical, and
I think even the inventor of this word could
not give it an exact meaning. This expression
cannot be admitted by any Government which
wishes to base its opinions on modern science,
and I think that there is no Government which
does not wish so to base them.
I would like to say that, if Mr. Clayton had sub-
mitted his views and added that he was speak-
ing of Indian internal questions, I should not
have raised any objection. But, since he has
introduced medical arguments, I feel that I
have a right to reply to him. He said, inter
alia, that there was not a sufficient number of
doctors in India, and that this forms a serious
obstacle to the supervision of the distribution
of drugs in general. I believe that there are in
India a great number of dispensaries, and it
might be possible to use them for organising
a much more stringent control. This remark,
moreover, merely refers to a question of detail.
Finally, I must admit that I experience a
certain feeling of disappointment and regret when
1 see Mr. Clayton, for whom I have the highest
respect, defending questions which are outside
his competence and a cause which -is not even
defensible.
In the report of the Royal Commission there
is a very interesting passage, which reads as
follows : ?On October 24th, 1817 (that is more
than a hundred years ago), the Directors of the
East India Company, writing to the Governor-
General of India, referred to their desire ?to
restrain the use of this pernicious drug?.?
It is stated further on that ?were it possible
to prevent the use of the drug altogether,
except strictly for the purpose of medicine,
we would gladly do it in compassion to man-
kind.? This is what officials of the East India
Company wrote a hundred years ago. I regret
that to-day the arguments used are very
different.
But, returning to the immediate question
before us, I wish to state simply that I support
the proposal submitted by the Italian delegate
that is to say, that Article I of the United
States proposals should be adopted as it stands,
without amendment. {Applause.)
The President
Translation : I understand the last remark
of the Polish delegate to mean that he accepts
the Italian proposal, which includes not only
the adoption pure and simple of the United
States proposals but also special terms, giving
each State the right to adhere to them with any
reservations that it may think necessary.
Dr. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : Yes, that is so.
The President
Translation : Mehmed Sureya Bey, dele-
gate of Turkey, will address the Conference.
IVlehmed Sureya Bey (Turkey)
Translation : In the memorandum which
the Secretariat has distributed to the members
of the Conference 1 , and in the course of the
sittings of Sub-Committee B, I have endeav-
oured to show the difficulties in the way of
limiting the cultivation of the poppy in Turkey,
and my declaration to Sub-Committee B has
clearly shown my Government?s view on this
question.
In the present state of affairs, this question
can be regarded from two angles :
(i) That of countries which suffer from
the improper use of morphine and
its derivatives ;
(2) That of countries which export raw
opium for use in morphine factories.
Countries belonging to the first category are
victims of illicit traffic, in spite of all rules made
to suppress it. These countries cannot arrive
at a satisfactory result. They propose that
the producing countries should enact effective
laws or regulations for controlling the produc-
tion of opium.
The argument of the producing countries is
that they are purely agricultural countries,
in which industry and trade are not developed,
and that their export consists principally
of agricultural raw materials. This is, for
instance, the case as regards Turkey.
It will be impossible to obtain a positive
result in Turkey by enacting laws restricting
the cultivation of the poppy ; it is a very
important agricultural product. The peasant
must obtain some other resource before such
a measure could be taken, and this would
require time and money. Anyone undertaking
to defend the interests of the peasants and to
explain their point of view would say : ?I know
that the opium produced by the peasants is
necessary for medical and scientific require-
ments ; I know also that this production gives
rise to abuses ; as you propose that 1 should
reduce it and co-operate in the task of reform,
1 agree to limit my cultivation of the poppy on
condition that you, in turn, will assist me to
make good the loss which this limitation will

involve.? That is exactly the position in my of this plant and the lack of capital necessary
country.
Viscount Cecil has said on various occasions
that Great Britain cannot enter into any
engagement which it would not be able effectively
to fulfil. Similarly, the Turkish Government
cannot sign a document the provisions of
which it considers to be inapplicable. The
Turkish Government cannot consider the
limitation of the production of opium so long as
it has received no assurance that the proposals
which it formulated in Sub-Committee B will
be adopted in principle.
The President
Translation : M. Yovanovitch, delegate of
the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes,
will address the Conference.
M. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) ;
Translation : I had no intention of explain-
ing my Government?s point of view, but
since the other producing countries have
expressed their views, 1 take the liberty, in my
turn, of acquainting you with the present
situation regarding opium in my country.
In a document distributed to the members
of the Conference 1 , the Serb-Croat-Slovene
delegation has given all the necessary information
regarding the cultivation of the poppy in the
Kingdom and has at the same time expressed the
point of view of its Government.
I venture to give quite frankly the reasons for
which we are unable to agree to the proposals
regarding the limitation of the cultivation of
the poppy in our country.
Before the war we produced about 200 tons
of opium ; at present the production has fallen
to half this amount. If it is taken into account
that before the war our country had only four
million inhabitants and that it has at present
thirteen millions that is to say, three times as
many as before the war the reduction in the
production of opium in comparison with the
number of inhabitants is still greater. Conse-
quently, the production of opium has been
effectively reduced in the Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes.
There can be no further reduction for the
following reasons :
(1) The districts producing raw opium are
restricted to soil which, by its nature, cannot
be usefully employed for other crops.
The cultivation of the poppy could only be
replaced by that of tobacco, vines, or cotton.
With regard to tobacco and vines, it would be
impossible to substitute them, for they are
already over-produced in the country, and no
adequate markets have been found for the
surplus. For example, the Government has
been obliged to purchase about 15 million kilo-
grammes of tobacco which could not be sold.
The position in the wine market is still more
serious, on account of the large production, on
the one hand, and, on the other, the prohibition
of consumption and the importation of wine
into certain States ; as a result, a large portion of
the wine produced in the country has not been
sold. With regard to the cultivation of cotton,
there are two practical difficulties ; the insuf-
ficient knowledge of the intensive cultivation
1 Vide Minutes of Sub-Committee B, annex 9.
for operations which must be carried out pre-
paratory to actual cultivation, such as irrigation
and other work.
(2) Any further reduction in the cultivation
of the poppy, which has already reached its
minimum, would cause social disturbances, as
the producers of opium would be deprived of
their principal resources. The cultivation of
the poppy alone supplies these people with
sufficient means of existence, and the peasants
producing opium employ their wives and chil-
dren in the work and thus save a part of the
cost of production. If we deprived these pro-
ducers of their principal means of livelihood,
we should create a social proletariat, always
liable to being increased by economic crises.
Moreover, we must take into consideration
the fact that the districts in question were
the scene of constant fighting from 1912 to
1919, and that the population still suffers severe
hardships. Any fresh economic crisis would
involve very grave consequences.
(3) If the approximate world production of
raw opium is taken as 16,000 tons, the produc-
tion in our country (100-150 tons) does not
represent even one per cent of the total. If
our entire production were stopped, therefore,
it would have hardly any effect on the world
production, and any measures that we might
take would have no influence on the aim which
we have in view.
By restricting our production we should be
depriving a certain number of our nationals
of their livelihood ; such sacrifices would in
no way benefit the general cause but would
merely favour our competitors.
(4) In support of our case, we consider it
important to state that the abuse of opium is
quite unknown in our country, and our opium
is exclusively used for the manufacture of
products for medical and scientific require-
ments. Our opium is exported for the most
part to the United States of America, England,
Germany and Switzerland. It is generally
known that no opium is exported from our
country as contraband.
To these observations, which apply solely to
our country, I may add a few remarks of a
general nature.
In the opinion of my delegation, the struggle
against this scourge of humanity cannot be
successfully carried on simply by limiting the
cultivation of the poppy, in view of the fact that
it is impossible to organise an effective control
in all countries on account of the great extent of
the territory of some and the lack of technical
staff for exercising the control.
Moreover, it is evident that in certain countries,
in spite of the good-will shown by the Govern-
ments and the measures adopted, the produc-
tion of opium has considerably increased.
In drawing up a Convention, it is not suffi-
cient to stipulate its provisions ; we must see
that they are loyally carried out. We could
not sign a Convention unless we were convinced
that it would be successfully applied and would
attain the object which we all have in view.
I would here refer to Viscount Cecil?s speech
before the Committee of Sixteen. The British
delegate pointed out that perfectly definite
obligations binding the producing countries
are already provided for by the Hague Con-
vention ; these provisions did not give the


expected result, simply because they were
not applied and not because they were bad.
The first French delegate, in the remarkable
speech which he made this morning, stated that
he had received detailed information to the
effect that the cultivation of the poppy was
increasing in the largest producing country,
and that, moreover, the authorities compelled
the peasants to undertake the cultivation of
this plant.
Under these circumstances, it would be
impossible for our country, which has already
reduced its production by half, to sign a
Convention which would compel it to make a
fresh reduction in the production of opium.
As a proof of the spirit of international co-
operation with which my Government is
inspired, it is prepared to give an undertaking
not to exceed the present limit of production in
the country.
The President
Translation : M. Loudon, delegate of the
Netherlands, will address the Conference.
IVI. Loudon (Netherlands) :
Translation : Permit me to ask a question.
I do not quite understand where we are. I
think we should be discussing the report of
the Sub-Committee, which states that there
was not a unanimous vote in favour of the
United States proposal. It appears to me,
however, that we are really discussing the
question whether the first article of the United
States proposals should be adopted or not.
The President
Translation : I am of opinion that as the
Sub-Committee was not unanimous on the
various points of view, these views must be
clearly stated so as to be a guide for the Drafting
Committee. I think I cannot interrupt the
present discussion.
I call on Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh, the Persian
delegate, to address the Conference.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia) ;
Translation : The Persian delegation had
the honour to adhere to the first article of the
United States proposals, with the definite
reservation that the conditions set forth in the
Persian memorandum *, which was dis-
tributed to the Conference at the beginning
of our work, should receive due consideration.
I can only repeat the statement that I made in
Sub-Committee B.
The President
Translation : I call on M. Dendramis, the
Greek delegate, to speak.
IVI. Dendramis (Greece)
Translation : Among the producing coun-
tries, Greece is the one that produces the smallest
quantity of opium. Its production plays a
very small part in the world market. Greece
is therefore prepared to adhere entirely to the
first article of the United States proposals only
when all the great producing countries have
adopted it without reservation.
The President
1 ranslation : I call on M. Pinto-Escalier,
the Bolivian delegate, to speak.
1 Vide Minutes of Sub-Committee B, annex 7
IVI. Pinto-Escalier (Bolivia)
Translation : I should merely like to ask if
the Italian delegation, in proposing that the
first article of the American proposals should
be adopted, wishes to adopt it in its entirety,
i.e., also in respect of coca leaves.
The President
Translation : In my opinion, we are not
now discussing the question of coca.
M. Pinto-Escalier (Bolivia)
Translation : We are discussing the first
article, and I asked the Italian delegate if he
intended to discuss this particular point. He
replied in the affirmative.
The President
Translation : M. Falcioni, delegate of Italy,
will address the Conference.
IVI. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : The proposal to accept the
first article was made by the Indian delegate,
but he proposed an amendment, i.e., that the
words "for export?? be added. I again beg
the Indian delegate not to insist on this amend-
ment.
I should like to repeat the declaration that I
had the honour to make just now, so that every-
one may be aware of the reservations that it
contains and of their importance :
"The Italian delegation regrets its ina-
bility to associate itself with the Indian
delegate?s proposal, and is of opinion that
no change should be made in the text of
the American proposal, although each
State should have the right of adhering
thereto with any reservations it may
judge advisable.??
I have nothing to add, except that I should
like to see the first article accepted as it stands.
The President
Translation : Mr. Clayton, delegate of India,
will address the Conference.
IVlr. Clayton (India) :
I should like to make a personal explanation.
As I explained before, my motion was that
Article i of the Hague Convention should
remain as it stands. In the course of my
speech, I said that, if a motion were proposed
to add the words "for export?? to the United
States proposals, I should be ready to accept it,
but the actual form in which I would like to
see Article i adopted is the form in which it
stands in the Hague Convention.
The President
Translation : We have before us the Italian
proposal ; we are not discussing the question
of coca leaves, as this point was not touched
upon in the report of Sub-Committee B.
I call upon Viscount Cecil, delegate of the
British Umpire, to address the Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
I feel in a good deal of difficulty about the
present position, because I think we are all
anxious to lay down as a general principle, as
far as we can, that opium ought to be used for
medical and scientific purposes only, at any rate
as far as the traffic in opium is concerned.


The difficulties, as I see them, are consider-
able. In the first place, there is the question of
coca leaves. I do not quite understand the
Italian proposal, because, undoubtedly if we
simply adopt the American Article i, it does
apply to coca leaves ; yet Sub-Committee C
has reported definitely that it is impracticable
to deal with coca in the same way as with
opium, because coca grows wild and there is
no possibility of controlling its production in
a number of countries. That is one matter
we have to consider.
There is yet another difficulty. The Italian
proposal is that we should adopt the article
as proposed by the United States without
amendment, any State having the right to make
reserves. Ido not know what our legal advisers
would say, but I think that, if we put the
American article into the Convention without
a reserve, any State which was unable to accept
that article would have to decline to sign and
ratify the whole Convention. It is not pos-
sible to sign and ratify a Convention and make
reserves unless all the other parties to the
Convention agree to accept those reserves, and
if any single country refused to accept a reserve
it would make it impossible for the State to
sign the Convention in that form. This seems
to me to be a great practical difficulty in the
way of the proposal as it stands.
There is also a suggestion not a formal
proposal which was made by the Indian
delegate that possibly the difficulty could be
overcome if we laid down the principle that no
traffic in opium should take place except for
medical and scientific purposes. That is to
say, by putting in the words ?Tor export?
we should make it quite clear that no opium
was to be exported from a producing country
which was not for medical and scientific pur-
poses.
As I understand the other speeches that
have been made, and particularly the speech
made by the delegate of the Kingdom of the
Serbs, Croats and Slovenes and that made by the
delegate of Turkey, I am not quite sure whether
even that would satisfy them. It did not seem
to me to be quite clear whether they would be
able to support the amendment. It is quite
evident that it is not much use including a
provision of this kind in our Convention unless
it is one which the producing countries are ready
to accept.
In those circumstances, 1 venture to suggest
that we might adjourn this discussion until
Tuesday next, or some such date the next
date, at any rate, on which the plenary Con-
ference meets. By that time, I think it is
possible that some solution may be found which
will meet the views of all parties. I think
it would be a very good thing if we could arrive
at a solution of that kind, and could find some
way of embodying this principle, which is a
very desirable one, in our Convention. I there-
fore beg to move that the debate be now
adjourned.
If I may add one w r ord, allow me to say that
I do not make this suggestion entirely en I?air.
I really have some ground for thinking that we
may be able to arrive at a solution satisfactory
to all parties, or at any rate that there is a
fair chance of our doing so. 1 therefore
earnestly beg the Conference to adjourn the
discussion for the moment.
Translation: I wish to ask the opinion of the
Conference on the proposal for an adjournment
of the discussion on this point, while continuing
the discussion of the other parts of the report.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
My motion is simply to adjourn the debate
until the next meeting of the plenary Confe-
rence. I did not mean necessarily until Tues-
day. That is a matter for the President to
decide.
The President
Do you mean the next meeting or a subse-
quent meeting ?
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
A subsequent meeting.
The President
Translation : I propose therefore that the
discussion be adjourned until a subsequent
meeting. That does not signify a postponement
sine die ; it means that we can renew the dis-
cussion, for instance, to-morrow or this even-
ing, but not exclusively on Tuesday as at
first indicated by Viscount Cecil.
IVI. Daladier (France)
Translation : If the Conference considers
an adjournment necessary for my part, I
share this opinion I suggest that we do not
lose too much time and that we should fix the
next meeting for Monday at 3 or 4 p.m. I
should like to save 24 hours on the date pro-
posed by Viscount Cecil.
The President
Translation : Ido not wish to fix the time
of the next meeting, as I cannot foresee what
the programme of the Conference will be
without knowing what stage our work will
reach to-day. 1 propose to fix the time of
the next meeting later.
As no opinion has been expressed to the
contrary, I consider the proposal for adjourn-
ment adopted by the Conference and I declare
the discussion closed on this part of Sub-
committee B?s report. [Adopted.)
We will now proceed to the discussion of the
other points in the report.
1 have no speaker on my list. Does any
member wish to speak ?
As no member wishes to speak, I will con-
sider the other parts of this report adopted in
principle by the Conference and referred to the
Drafting Committee. The only question that
is referred to a future meeting is that which
we have just discussed. [Assent.)
80. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
SUB COMMITTEE C.
The President
Translation : We now pass to the report
of Sub-Committee C (Annex 22).
I call upon the Chairman and Rapporteur
of this Sub-Committee, the first German dele-
gate, M. von Eckardt, to address the Conference.
M. von Eckardt (Germany), Rapporteur ;
Translation : The examination of the con-
trol of the production and distribution of coca
The President


leaves, Article I of the United States proposals,
was entrusted to Sub-Committee C, composed
of the delegations of Bolivia, the Netherlands,
Japan and Peru. Our work was necessarily
incomplete on account of the regrettable absence
of the delegate of Pera, a country which
produces and exports coca leaves and manufac-
tures cocaine. The delegates of Bolivia and
the Netherlands have already furnished at
previous meetings some detailed information
on the subject. Sub-Committee C proposes
that the Conference should adopt the follow-
ing conclusions, in conformity with the sug-
gestions of the Advisory Committee :
i. Article 2 of the Hague Convention
of 1912 shall be extended to coca leaves.
2. The system of import and export
licences shall be extended to coca leaves.
The President
Translation : The discussion on this report is
open. Does anyone wish to speak ?
As no member wishes to speak. I may regard
the questions of principle contained in the
report as adopted by the Conference and
referred to the Drafting Committee. {Adopted.)
81. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
SUB-COMMITTEE D.
The President
Translation : We will now consider the
report of Sub-Committee D (Annex 23.)
I call on Mr. Shepherd, Rapporteur of Sub-
Committee D, to address the Conference.
Mr. Shepherd (Australia), Rapporteur :
Sub-Committee D considered the various
articles of the Advisory Committee?s report
and accepted in principle Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
and 13. Several amendments were suggested
by the Sub-Committee, but these were sub-
sequently covered (or most of them) by agree-
ments reached in the Co-ordination Committee,
and Sub-Committee D finds itself in general
agreement, in principle, with the recommenda-
tions of Sub-Committee A.
The only point which it is perhaps necessary
for me to make is that Sub-Committee D
expressed the wish that non-producing countries
should be represented on the Central Board.
That is not referred to in the report of the
Co-ordination Committee, and I mention it
here for the sake of record.
I would like also to refer to the decision in
regard to the Australian, Cuban and Austrian
proposals 1 . I very much regret to find that the
Australian proposal has not been adopted by
Sub-Committee B. It was passed by Sub-
committee D with slight amendments, which
were not acceptable to the members of Sub-
Committee B. The producing countries on
that Sub-Committee unanimously adopted the
proposal submitted by Australia that all countries
which do not at present produce should be
prohibited from doing so, but unfortunately they
were not able to accept the conditions submitted
by Sub-Committee D.
The only other point to which 1 wish to
draw attention is the Portuguese memorandum 2
1 Vide annex 18.
2 Vide Minutes of Sub-Committe D, annex 2.
which the Sub-Committee wished to submit to
the Conference, but on which it makes no
recommendation.
The President
Translation : There appears to be a diffe-
rence of opinion between Sub-Committees B
and D according to the remarks just made
by the Rapporteur.
Mr. Shepherd (Australia)
Well, I presume there is a difference of opi-
nion, as Sub-Committee B did not accept the
recommendations of Sub-Committee D on the
Australian and Cuban proposals.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
What did the Co-ordination Committee do ?
The President
Translation : Can the Chairman of the
Co-ordination Committee give us any informa-
tion on this point ?
M. Sjdstrand (Sweden)
I remember asking in the Co-ordination
Committee whether there was any such dif-
ference of opinion, but I received no answer to
the question. I have therefore no information
with regard to any such difference of opinion.
As the question seems to be one of some impor-
tance, it might be referred to the Drafting
Committee.
The President :
Translation : M. Shepherd, delegate of
Australia, will address the Conference.
Mr. Shepherd (Australia)
I do not think that any good purpose would
be served by debating this question. The prin-
ciple on which we could not agree was the one
on which the whole Conference has failed
to agree : that is, that the producing countries,
on their part, should undertake to reduce their
production. As the Conference has failed to
come to an agreement on that point, I do not
think much advantage would be gained by
again discussing it here.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
May I suggest that there is not really a
divergence of views between the two Sub-
Committees on this point ? Sub-Committee D,
as I understand its report, recommended that
the Australian proposal should be accepted,
provided the producing countries were willing
to undertake a certain obligation. The pro-
ducing countries which were represented on
Sub-Committee B did not see their way to
undertake that obligation. The position,
therefore, is that, as the producing countries
represented on Sub-Committee B were not
willing to undertake the obligation referred to,
the recommendation of Sub-Committee D drops.
The President
Translation : I hope that this information
will make the matter sufficiently clear to the
Drafting Committee.
I declare the report of Sub-Committee D
adopted in principle and referred to the Draf-
ting Committee. {Assent.)


82. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
SUB-COMMITTEE E.
The President
7 ranslation : We now come to the report
of Sub-Committee E (Annex 24). I call upon the
Rapporteur, Sir Malcolm Delevingne, to speak.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Rapporteur :
I have very little to add to what is said in
the report, which enters fully into all the pro-
posals contained in the Appendix. I would
merely like to say that the proposals were unani-
mously accepted in each case and, I think,
without any reservation by any delegation
except on one or two very small points of detail.
I think that, in those circumstances, it is
unnecessary for me to detain the Conference
in connection with this report.
The President
7 ranslation : The discussion on the report is
open.
1 call on M. Chodzko, the Polish delegate,
to speak.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I take the opportunity of
submitting a proposal which is, I think, within
the competence of Sub-Committee E.
So far we may say that the Conference has
been engaged rather with the question of con-
trolling the legitimate trade in opium and its
derivatives than with that of clandestine inter-
national traffic. We have not endeavoured to
study seriously or even superficially the reason
for the existence and development of this clan-
destine traffic, this scourge which is responsible
for so much suffering and so many deaths.
While searching for a practical solution of
this problem, I found in the minutes of the
sixth session of the Advisory Committee on
the Traffic in Opium, page 77, the words ?the
incentive for illicit traffic in dangerous drugs
is to be found in the profits derived therefrom?.
If this is true and it is difficult to deny it
it would appear that the best means of pre-
venting this traffic and restricting its develop-
ment must be to find a system which will
render it impossible to make such illicit profits.
Tt is generally admitted that it is neither the
manufacturer nor the chemist who engages in
clandestine trade. These are firmly established
in the country where they have their business
and therefore are too much under the control
of the authorities to engage in wholesale clan-
destine trade. This clandestine and illicit
international traffic is of such dimensions that
as recently as January 27th a quantity of
morphine was seized at Brooklyn which was
valued at about 450,000 gold dollars (see
The Times of January 28th, 1925).
The reason for this extensive clandestine
traffic is that there is nothing in the present
legislation to prevent a person, authorised, to
carry on a wholesale trade in drugs, from
selling his stock which may amount to several
tons to a clandestine trader. Having gained the
enormous profits which such a transaction would
bring, the wholesale dealer has merely to cross
the frontier in order to be safe from any pro-
secution. Tempted by one of the numerous
agents of this international organisation for
clandestine traffic in drugs, the wholesale dealer
sells his goods, takes his profit and disappears.
The remedy would appear to lie in a system
of ?bonds with cash surety? or ?cash deposits?,
the amount of which might be in proportion
to the total quantity which the wholesal dealer
should be authorised to have in stock. As
the average illicit profit obtainable on 1 kilo
of morphine or cocaine is known, everyone
authorised to deal in these products would,
on receiving his licence or trading certificate,
pay a cash deposit which would be so large as
to remove all desire to engage in clandestine
trade. With the knowledge that his deposit
might be confiscated by the authorities, such
a wholesale dealer would not be tempted by
the profits obtainable from illicit trade.
I should like to add that in Poland it is only
the large pharmaceutical merchants who have
the right to engage in the wholesale trade in
narcotics.
Taking as our starting point the fact that
this clandestine trade in narcotics exists solely
on account of the profit which it brings in,
I think the remedy can be found, while awaiting
the limitation of manufacture to the strict
medical and scientific requirements, in a system
of bonds with cash surety, and I therefore have
the honour to propose the following resolution:
?The High Contracting Parties under-
take not to deliver licences for stocking,
purchasing or selling narcotics to wholesale
or semi-wholesale dealers, other than manu-
facturers, without imposing on such dealers
the system of cash deposits or of surety
for their good faith. The amount of the
deposit to be paid on delivery of the licences
shall be equal to the difference between the
average profit obtainable in lawful trade
on the maximum quantity authorised
by the licence and the average profit that
could be realised by the sale of the same
quantity in illicit traffic.?
The President
Translation : I believe the proposal made
by the Polish delegate has never been discussed
by Sub-Committee E.
1 request the Rapporteur of this Sub-Com-
mittee to give us his opinion on the subject.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Rapporteur ;
I do not know what grounds the delegate for
Poland has for thinking that the system of
bonds or ?cautions? which he suggests is the
only remedy for preventing the illicit traffic.
As a matter of fact, the system was mentioned
in Sub-Committee E, but it was not accepted
by the Sub-Committee because it was considered
that the question of the methods to be adopted
by each Government for exercising control
over the dealers and manufacturers in its
country was a matter for its own determina-
tion.
The question as to what is the most effective
method of dealing with a trader who engages
in illicit traffic is one on which several views
can be held. The view which is taken by most
Governments, and the view which was taken, I
think, by Sub-Committee E, was that the most
effective method was the imposition of very heavy
penalties, and the Conference will find at the
end of the report of the Sub-Committee a refe-
rence to that point and a recommendation that
a provision should be inserted in the Convention
to be concluded by this Conference that the


Government should undertake to impose ades
quate penalties for all breaches of the provision-
contained in the Convention.
It seems to me that if it can be proved that
a particular trader has been engaging in illicit
trade and for the purpose of enforcing the
system which the delegate for Poland re-
commends it would be necessary to prove that
fact a very severe penalty of imprisonment
or a very heavy fine is quite as effective as, if not
much more effective than, the forfeiture of a
bond.
In Great Britain, for example, the maximum
penalty which can be imposed for breaches of
the law in regard to dangerous drugs is as much
as ten years penal servitude and a fine of �l,OOO.
That, surely, is quite as effective as the for-
feiture of a bond.
Again, I do not quite see how the amount of
the bond is to be ascertained, because, if it is
to be equal to the difference between the profits
to be obtained in the licit trade and the profits
in the illicit trade, you have to ascertain what
the profits of the illicit trade are, and I venture
to say that this is not a matter which is known
to anybody but the illicit traders themselves.
I would suggest, therefore, to the Conference
that this is a matter which must be left to each
Government to determine for itself. If a
Government thinks that a system of bonds is
a good one, it can adopt it. If it thinks that
a system of very heavy penalties is a better
one, it should be left to decide the matter for
itself. I think it is impossible at this stage to
ask a Government to undertake to adopt a
particular system which it may not think is
as good as the one it has already adopted in
its own legislation.
The President
Translation : M. Chodzko, delegate of Po-
land, will address the Conference.
IVI. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : I regret that I cannot share
the opinion of Sir Malcolm Delevingne it
is not the first time that this has happened
but we must refer to Article 10 of the Hague
Convention ; ?The Contracting Powers shall
use their best endeavours to control, or cause
to be controlled, all persons manufacturing,
importing, selling, distributing and exporting
morphine, cocaine, etc.... as well as the buil-
dings...?? It appears from the wording of
this article that the dealers are obliged to have
a building specially intended for this trade, but
this is not actually the case.
If we follow the chain of persons through
whom the narcotic passes from the manufac-
turer to the chemist, we find in the middle a
wholesale dealer. This dealer may or may not
give sufficient material guarantees. At the
present time, in most States, he does not give
any such guarantees.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne informs us that
English legislation provides for heavy fines
and ten years penal servitude, but how can
a fine be imposed on a person who has no pos-
sessions, or penal servitude be inflicted on some-
one who has been able to leave immediately
the country that gave him the licence ? It is
important that these penalities should exist,
but in many cases they are ineffective, as I
have just shown.
There is the question of the interpretation of
Article 10. If, as Sir Malcolm Delevingne tells
us, we should leave it to the various States to
take what measures they think fit, that is a
good principle, but in that case why should
we suggest that these States should introduce
import and export certificates ? That is also
a matter dependent on the sovereignty of the
State, but we nevertheless propose it.
I do not see, therefore, why we should not
propose a mecasure which might be useful.
Most States at present grant licences to anyone
who asks for them and who can pay a few francs,
provided no previous conviction has been re-
corded against the applicant. Under this sys-
tem the countries have no material guarantees.
They cannot be sure of being able to punish
cases of infringement, because they cannot
seize property which the person in question
does not possess. With regard to the sum
that should be fixed as a deposit, this is still
a vague proposal, and if Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne can make some other suggestion I shall
be very glad.
The President
Translation : I do not think the plenary
Conference is a suitable place for discussing this
question. Would the Chairman of the Sub-
Committee be prepared to convene his Sub-
Committee ? He could do that, for instance,
on Monday next, without altering the programme
of the Conference.
IV!. Bourgois (France)
Translation : I think it is unnecessary to
refer this question to Sub-Committee E. All
the members have already considered it at
length and studied it from every aspect, so
that it might be possible to take a vote on
it here and now.
The President
Translation : The discussion of the Polish
delegate?s proposal is open.
M. Dinichert, delegate of Switzerland, will
address the Conference.
IV!. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I should like to say a few
words on this proposal, because I think it is
of interest and is inspired by a very justifiable
anxiety. I wish, however, to point out that the
precaution which the Polish delegate proposes
should be taken by the various Governments
applies less to manufacturers than to traders,
and we are therefore all equally interested in
this proposal. It is not a measure which
should be taken specially by the countries
manufacturing narcotics but by all countries
in some way, since, in certain circumstances,
all take part in the trade in these substances.
Therefore we should all consider whether
we are able to take upon ourselves a contractual
obligation of this kind in the same manner as
the other obligations which have already been
embodied in Article 10 of the Hague Convention.
I think that probably even the author of this
proposal never intended that we should ask
the forty delegations representing their Govern-
ments here to embody a formal obligation of
this kind in a Convention. I do not think that
many of us are able to bind ourselves in this
manner. But I repeat that the proposal is
of interest, and I think it would deserve to


be brought to the notice of our Governments
as a recommendation in favour of a measure
which, in certain countries and circumstances,
might be effective.
I agree with Sir Malcolm Delevingne that
we should leave it to our Governments to take
in their respective countries what measures
they may think fit in order to fulfil the
obligations assumed, but he will not deny
perhaps, that these measures might prove very
useful. I am therefore in favour of this
proposal to the extent that I should like the
idea to be submitted to our Governments as
a recommendation for their consideration.
The President
Translation : We have before us a proposal
to make the Polish resolution into a recommen-
dation. The discussion is open also on this
point.
I call upon M. Bourgois, delegate of France,
to address the Conference.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : My Government had already
considered this question of sureties, but after
some hesitation it refrained from making pro-
posals of this nature to the Conference, think-
ing that it would be better to leave this ques-
tion to be settled by each of the Governments
concerned.
It is on account of this very question that,
on the suggestion of the French Government,
one of the clauses of the Hague Convention
was strengthened. Up to the present, under
the Hague Convention, a simple declaration
was sufficient in order to engage in traffic of this
kind, whereas we have inserted in the future
Convention a clause providing for the necessity
of an authorisation. This is a much more
serious engagement. It imposes upon the
Government the moral obligation to satisfy
itself, before granting this authorisation, of
the trustworthy character of the person to
whom it is granted. The Government must
obtain certain guarantees.
It appeared to the French Government that
this authorisation would replace and might
even be more effective than any purely pecu-
niary guarantee. This moral obligation on
the part of a Government, which itself chooses
the persons permitted to engage in the traffic
and obtains all the guarantees which it thinks
fit, should re-assure the Polish delegate. I
am not, however, opposed to a proposal of this
kind being made as a suggestion to the Govern-
ments.
Nevertheless, I would propose a slight amend-
ment. In respect of wholesale or semi-whole-
sale dealers who have shops or warehouses,
and for manufacturers, the guarantees given
by a Government are quite adequate, because
the fact that the dealer?s establishment is
within reach of the Government makes it
certain that the guilty person will not escape.
This is to some extent a question of drafting.
The President
Translation : Does the Polish delegate,
M. Chodzko, who made this proposal, wish to
speak ?
M. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : I have no objections to the
Swiss delegate?s suggestion to give my proposal
the form of a recommendation. As regards the
form of this proposal, I think it would be better
to request the Drafting Committee to draw it
up, taking into account M. Bourgois? obser-
vations.
The President
Translation : M. Sugimura, delegate of
Japan, will address the Conference :
M. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation : I fully recognise the effective-
ness of the measures proposed by the Polish
delegate. In numerous cases such a system for
controlling illicit trade has been adopted and has
proved effective. Nevertheless, Japan wishes to
go further and to take still more energetic mea-
sures. For this reason, I cannot recommend to
my Government a solution which is not ade-
quate and measures which are not sufficiently
effective. I therefore reserve my support on
this point.
The President
Translation : I think I may regard the
Polish proposal as having been withdrawn.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : No, I have not withdrawn my
proposal ; I have simply transformed it into
a recommendation.
The President
Translation : Viscount Cecil, delegate of
the British Empire, will address the Conference,
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
Speaking for the British Government, I
could not accept this as a recommendation,
because to accept it would mean that we thought
it was a good plan, whereas our advisers doubt
very much whether it is so. If, however, it
can be treated just as a suggestion to go before
the Governments, we shall have no objection.
But we cannot approve it. lam sure that the
delegate of Poland will see how impossible it
is at this stage of the Conference and at this
hour of the evening to approve a complicated
proposal of this kind. We are quite willing,
however, that it should be placed before the
Governments in the form of a suggestion.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation: I agree with Viscount Cecil?s
views that is to say, that we should try to
find a formula corresponding to the proposal
but I should like to observe that I do not think
the expression ?suggestion? should be used.
It is an expression belonging rather to psycho-
logy than to the realm of international rela-
tions. If we wish to change the word ?recom-
mendation?, could we not use the expression
?proposal? or ?opinion? ?
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
That is a matter which might be left to the
Drafting Committee.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : I agree to your suggestion.
The President
Translation : I understand that the unani-
mous feeling of the Conference is that this
Polish-Swiss proposal should be referred to the


Drafting Committee with a request that the
Committee should hnd a formula to submit to
us, taking into account the various remarks
which have been made.
Does any other member wish to speak on
the report of Sub-Committee E ?
As no one wishes to speak, I consider the
general principles contained in this report adop-
ted by the Conference. The report will be sent
to the Drafting Committee with the request I
have just mentioned. [Adopted.)
83. EXAM IN AT lON OF THE REPORTS OF
SUB-COMMITTEE F. 25, 26, 27, 28, 29.
The President
Translation : We have now to consider the
reports of Sub-Committee F (Annexes 25, 26, 27,
28, 29). M. Carriere, who was Rapporteur of this
Committee, is absent from Geneva at present.
Professor Perrot, who had been appointed to
replace him as Rapporteur, is also absent. I have
therefore appealed to M. de Myttenaere, who
has agreed to present the report.
I call on M. de Myttenaere, in his capacity
as Rapporteur, to speak.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium), Rapporteur :
Translation : Sub-Committee F, called the
Sub-Committee of Experts, was entrusted with :
(1) The determination of legitimate require-
ments of opium and opium alkaloids (which it
is agreed to call the opium figure per head of
the population for countries with a properly
developed medical organisation.)
It accepted the figure of 450 milligrammes
with certain reservations.
(2) The determination of the same figure
for cocaine. The figure of 7 milligrammes was
accepted.
(3) Modifications to be made in the draf-
ting of the definitions in Chapters 1 and 11 of
the Suggestions of the United States of America.
(4) The examination of the questions raised
by the application of the provisions of the
Convention to various known narcotic substan-
ces referred to and to such substances as may
be subsequently discovered by science and having
analogous properties.
(5) The examination of the Egyptian pro-
posal regarding Indian hemp.
I do not wish to speak at length on this
summary, as the subject has been fully dis-
cussed in the report of Sub-Committee F. In
the absence of the Rapporteur, I should like
to ask those who may wish to oppose certain
points in the report to postpone their discussion.
The President
Translation: Mr. Walton, delegate of India,
will address the Conference.
Mr. Walton (India)
I desire merely to say a word with reference
to the question of Indian hemp dealt with in
the report of M. Perrot 1 . The Indian delega-
tion would find it impossible to accept the
particular methods of controlling the use of
this drug which are mentioned in that report.
1 Annex 28.
The reasons of our inability to do so are fully
explained in the note which is circulated with
the report.
I wish only to add that the proposal for
dealing with this drug has, of course, only
been considered from the point of view of
Sub-Committee F, that is, from the expert
medical point of view, because it was not
referred to any other Sub-Committee. Con-
sequently, the question of the control of Indian
hemp has not been examined from the admi-
nistrative point of view.
Unfortunately, there are very considerable
administrative difficulties which really ought
to be taken into account if we are to do anything
practical towards the control of the drug. One
of the greatest difficulties is, of course, that the
plant from which the drug is prepared grows
wild, and the drug is prepared by very simple
processes. Consequently, it is difficult to control
the preparation of the drug, and the particular
proposal to confine its use entirely to medical
and scientific purposes becomes a very diffi-
cult matter from the administrative point of
view.
A step that could usefully be taken, or so it
appears to the Indian delegation and to the
Government of India, from which we asked
instructions, would be to apply the import
certificate system to the international traffic
in this drug to the full extent to which that
system has been elaborated by Sub-Committee
E. In that way, no export of Indian hemp
would be allowed except on the production of
the import certificate from the Government
of the importing country. This would effectively
control the international traffic, which is what
we all desire to do and which is a practical
step.
The Government of India, therefore, would
be able to co-operate in measures of that kind
and the Indian delegation would be able to
accept the application of the new Convention
to Indian hemp, in so far as the import certi-
ficate system is concerned.
It would be premature, perhaps, to deal in
greater detail now with this question, but the
Indian delegation thought it right to explain
its point of view and will possibly ask leave
to deal further with the matter when we come
to consider the Convention itself.
The President
Translation : Before calling on any of the
speakers on my list, I wish to state that the
author of this proposal, the delegate for Egypt,
has written to me to-day to say that he is
unable to take part in our discussions before
Tuesday. He therefore asks us to adjourn the
discussion of this proposal until then. In
these circumstances, I think it would be advi-
sable not to continue the discussion.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium)
Translation : When I asked to be allowed
to speak it was my intention to make the very
proposal that you have just submitted.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation: I withdraw my request to speak.
The President
Translation : This question is therefore
reserved for subsequent discussion. Does


anyone wish to speak on any other point in
the report of Sub-Committee F ?
M. Bustamante, delegate of Spain, will
address the Conference.
M. Bustamante (Spain) :
Translation : With reference to the first
report of Sub-Committee F (Annex 25) which deals
with the question of the legitimate doses of
opium and cocaine, I wish to say that, even if we
admit that the only remedy, and the one that
has been the most recommended, is to reduce
the cultivation of the poppy and of the coca
leaf and to restrict the manufacture of their
alkaloids in order that, a close relationship
having been established between the substances
available and their lawful use, the existing
surplus of these products which serves to develop
vice and is a powerful cause of degeneration
will automatically disappear, we are at the
moment still very far from being able to use
this method.
The statistics available are incomplete and
of small range, and some of their factors have
even been omitted. In order that statistics
may serve as a basis for deducing medical and
scientific requirements, they must refer to
a minimum period of three years and include
all the preparations which require the use of the
raw materials.
For this reason, the figure of 0.45 grammes
for opiates indicated in terms of opium con-
stitutes such a vague indication that it cannot
be seriously considered. As far as our own
country is concerned, it is possible that the
quantity of 0.45 grammes is excessive, but
as it has been possible for various reasons to
arrive at the exact consumption of opiates and
cocaine in Spain we can only accept it with
the reservation that it represents our legitimate
requirements.
We can admit more easily the figure of 0.007
grammes of cocaine per head of the population,
in view of the fact that its therapeutic effects
can be easily obtained by synthetic substitutes
as is shown in practice more and more every
day. As the great French chemist Fourneau
has proved in his work on the synthesis of
organic medicine, these substitutes would have
entirely taken the place of cocaine if the illicit
use of this drug had not represented its prin-
cipal commercial value.
The President
Translation : M. de Myttenaere, delegate
of Belgium, will address the Conference.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium), Rapporteur :
Translation : I think it is not part of my
duty as Rapporteur to speak in defence of
Sub-Committee F. There was no intention,
as M. Bustamante has said, to do more than
fix a figure which might, if necessary, be taken
as an average for the medical requirements
of different countries. There was never any
question of imposing the figure of 450 milli-
grammes on any country. The discussion was
purely tentative, as no section based any cal-
culations on the figure of 450 milligrammes
fixed by the Committee of Experts nor on the
figure of 7 milligrammes fixed for cocaine.
Under these circumstances, it would be a waste
of time both for the Rapporteur and for the
Conference to speak in defence of figures which
are of no importance.
1 ranslation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
I wish to say one word with reference to the
recommendation of the Sub-Committee, which
says that certain preparations containing dan-
gerous drugs may be supplied to the public
by a chemist without a medical prescription.
That was opposed in the Sub-Committee by
the British representative, and I notice that
the fact of his opposition, which was stated in
the earlier drafts of the report, has been somehow
omitted from the final text.
The British delegation opposed this recom-
mendation very strongly on the ground
which seemed to us a sufficient ground that
under it a drug addict would be able to go
from one chemist to another and obtain exces-
sive quantities of the drug for his use. It
seems to us to be a very dangerous weakening
of the provision in the Hague Convention.
Certainly, it is at present illegal under the provi-
sions of the British law and, I imagine, under
the law of most countries.
I do not wish to detain the Conference at any
length on the subject at the present moment,
but we shall feel bound to oppose it when it
comes before the Conference during the consi-
deration of the draft Convention.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium), Rapporteur :
Translation : The Rapporteur has no res-
ponsibility for any inaccuracies in the report.
I am aware of the reservation made by the
British delegation, and I propose to reply to
it subsequently.
The President
Translation : The Drafting Committee will
take into account the first observation made by
Sir Malcolm Delevingne, and there will be a
discussion on this subject in the plenary Con-
ference.
M. Bourgois (France) :
Translation : We have reserved the question
of hashish. I should like to ask that the ques-
tion of heroin should also be reserved on account
of the absence of M. Perrot, who has dealt spe-
cially with this point.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium), Rapporteur :
Translation : In spite of the absence of the
Rapporteur and of the Chairman, I think we
should nevertheless accept the reports of Sub-
Committee F in principle, in the same way as
we have accepted the other reports. The points
of view of the various Governments can then
be made known when we come to the discus-
sion of the different points.
The President
Translation : I propose, therefore, that we
accept in principle the reports of Sub-Committee
F and refer them to the Drafting Committee.
I should perhaps specially reserve the question
of hashish, but after the remarks which have
just been made it does not appear to be neces-
sary to reserve the question of heroin.
I declare the reports adopted and referred to
the Drafting Committee. {Assent.)


84. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
THE COMMITTEE OF SIXTEEN.
The President
Translation : We now come to the last
item of our agenda : the report of the Committee
of Sixteen (Annex 30). I do not think it necessary
to call on the Rapporteur to speak, as the report
has already been distributed to all the members
of the Conference.
I call on M. Toivola, delegate of Finland,
to address the Conference.
M. Toivola (Finland)
Translation : Although I am not the Rap-
porteur of the Committee of Sixteen, I think
it advisable to say a few words with regard
to this Committee?s report.
When the Second Conference decided two
weeks ago to form a special Committee to
consider the United States proposals and cer-
tain other declarations, we all hoped that this
Committee would come to an agreement with
regard to the suppression of prepared opium.
You know that this hope has not been realised
and that it has been impossible to come to an
agreement.
We regret this fact. We all regret the
departure of the United States delegation, and
I think I may say that the presence of this
delegation has had a good effect on our work.
In international co-operation, as in all human
activity, the essential point is to make progress.
The means is of secondary importance. The
report submitted by the Committee of Sixteen
to the Conference only records a failure, but
it is a failure that is more apparent than real.
The Committee of Sixteen was unable to
agree unanimously with regard to what we
may call the frame of the picture. The exis-
tence of the Committee of Sixteen and the
efforts made by the members of this Committee,
together with the perseverance shown by the
distinguished representative of the United
States, have led the interested countries to
prepare plans which if realised will put an
end to the scourge against which the United
States delegation has fought with such energy.
Reference was made in the report to steps
which certain Governments might take with
a view to arriving at a definite solution of the
question of prepared opium. Permit me to
draw the attention of the Conference to the
declarations made this morning by the distin-
guished delegates of the British Empire, France
and the Netherlands. These declarations con-
firm very distinctly and clearly that these
Governments are prepared to take definite
steps to suppress prepared opium. They are
willing to leave it to the League of Nations to
fix the date from which the period of fifteen
years should commence.
As the delegate of a country which is not
interested in this question, 1 cannot deny the
reality of the progress that has been made in
these'discussions. Let the producing countries
take a similar attitude and the problem of
prepared opium will be definitely solved in
a very short time.
Mr. Porter, with whom I have had the plea-
sure of working on several occasions, said that
it is impossible to suppress an age-long vice
in a few days. Let the producing countries
do their duty towards humanity and the day
will approach with almost incredible rapidity
when prepared opium will cease to be used as
it is used to-day. Fifteen years or twenty
years is only a day in the life of nations. This
Conference has helped us to see the first dawn
of this day.
Let each one of us realise his responsibility.
Let the producing countries, which should help
the countries that are still consumers of pre-
pared opium, take advantage of the opportune
moment.
The existing conditions in China, which at
present prevent definite measures being taken
against this scourge, cannot continue for ever.
The time is approaching when China will
take measures against the cultivation of the
poppy. Let us be prepared in all countries for
this time. Let us be prepared to make simul-
taneous efforts against this scourge and it
will disappear from the world.
The President
Translation : Viscount Cecil, delegate of
the British Empire, will address the Confe-
rence.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
M. Toivola alluded to the proceedings of
the Committee of Sixteen, and it was pointed
out that, by the declarations which certain
Governments made this morning, it is quite
clear that they are determined to do their best
to bring opium-smoking to an end. The Con-
ference will remember that one of the proposals
put before the Committee of Sixteen was that
there should be two additional Protocols; one
which would be adopted, if it thought right,
by the First Conference and which would
oblige the parties to it to put an end to opium-
smoking within fifteen years after such progress
had been made in the suppression of smuggling
as to render it no longer an obstacle to their
measures. With that Protocol, of course, I do
not propose to trouble this Conference, as it is
a matter for the other Conference.
It was also part of the same scheme that
the producing countries should be asked to
accept another Protocol by which they, in
their turn, should undertake so to control the
production and distribution of raw opium
as to prevent opium-smuggling constituting a
serious obstacle to the effective prohibition of
the use of prepared opium in those countries
where such use is temporarily permitted.
The point which I am now laying before the
Conference is contained in four clauses which
are of a simple character. Perhaps I might read
them to the Conference :
?I. The States signatories of the pre-
sent Protocol recognise that Chapter I
of the Hague Convention of 1912 involves
an obligation so to limit and control within
their territories the production and distri-
bution of raw opium as to prevent opium-
smuggling constituting a serious obstacle
to the effective prohibition of the use of
prepared opium in those territories where
such use is temporarily authorised.
?11. Each of the signatory States agrees
to take the necessary measures, so far as
this has not already been done, to ensure
the complete execution of its obligation
under Article I of the present Protocol,
within five years from the present date.


?111. The question whether the obli-
gation referred to in Article I has been
completely executed shall be decided, at
the end of the said period of five yearsi by
a Commission to be appointed by the League
of Nations, whose decision shall be final.
?IV. The present Protocol shall come
into force for each of the signatory States
at the same time as the Convention rela-
ting to Dangerous Drugs signed this day.?
Well, I do not know that I need elaborate any
argument in favour of that Protocol, because it
has constantly been discussed in various forms
both before this Conference and before the
Committee of Sixteen. I have had some doubt
whether it was desirable to proceed with it in
the absence of the delegate of China, but I did
venture to put to him once or twice the question
whether he was prepared, on behalf of his
Government, to assent to this Protocol. Un-
fortunately, he has left the Conference before
he was able to give an answer to that question.
With regard to the other producing countries
now present, I understand that, in principle,
they do not object or I think that I am right
in saying that they do not object to the pre-
sent Protocol, although some of them would
desire a change in the wording of Article I.
That change seems to me one which I could
quite well support. I do not know exactly
what procedure would be right at this stage,
but, unless I am out of order, perhaps I might
read the draft amendment to Article I. I gather
that no producing country here present would
oppose it three of them would be prepared
to undertake to sign it, a fourth would be able
to sign it ad referendum, and a fifth would be
favourable, though he is, at present, 1 under-
stand, without definite instructions on the
point ; there are no other producing coun-
tries.
If I am right in this, I also would be prepared
to accept the amended text, which reads as
follows :
?The Contracting Parties recognise that
Chapter I of the Hague Convention of 1912
involves an obligation to exercise within
their territories an effective control over
the production and distribution of raw
opium, so as to prevent all smuggling of
opium, which constitutes a serious obstacle
to the effective prohibition of the use of
prepared opium in the territories where
such use is temporarily authorised.?
As I understand it, the substantial change
proposed in the article is that the w'ords ?limit
and? are suppressed. I see no objection to
that, because there does not seem to me to be
any real difference in the sense of the two
words. The other modification is that instead
of undertaking to stop opium-smuggling, so
as to prevent its constituting a serious obstacle,
the Contracting Parties undertake a general
obligation to prevent opium-smuggling, recog-
nising that at the present time it is a serious
obstacle. This is a fine distinction, and again
I do not think it substantially interferes with
the effect of the Protocol.
If, therefore, the Conference should be of
opinion that this Protocol is a desirable one
to be presented to the producing countries for
signature, I should be very glad to receive the
support of the Conference in that respect.
I think myself that such a step would consti-
tute real progress towards the stoppage of the
use of prepared opium and it would mean that
the matter would then be recognised definitely
as one which the producing countries of the
world, with the exception of China, had under-
taken to deal with, and one would hope that,
m view of the declaration from the Chinese
delegation which was read this morning, although
the Chinese Government would not be strictly
bound by these obligations, it would be morally
bound by that declaration. Under these cir-
cumstances, I hope that the Conference will
adopt this Protocol.
The President
Translation : M. Sugimura, delegate of
Japan, will address the Conference.
?VI. Sugimura (Japan) :
7 ranslation : The British proposal and the
report of the Committee of Sixteen are two
distinct questions. 1 should prefer to dis-
cuss the leport first and the British proposal
aftei wards, as the latter is very important ;
The President
7 ranslation : I accept the suggestion of the
Japanese delegate and I open the discussion
of the report of the Committee of Sixteen.
Does anyone wish to speak ?
As no one wishes to speak, I propose that
the Conference take note of this report. (Assent.)
85. CONSIDERATION OF THE DRAFT
PROTOCOL TO BE SIGNED SIMULTA-
NEOUSLY WITH THE CONVENTION
AND TO FORM PART OF THE PRO-
CEEDINGS OF THE SECOND OPIUM
CONFERENCE : PROPOSAL OF THE
BRITISH DELEGATION.
The President
7 ranslation : I open the discussion on the
British pioposal 1 with a reservation as regards
the drafting of the first article, which must
be referred to the Drafting Committee. The
discussion is open on the question of principle.
We shall have a further discussion later on
the various articles when we have received the
definite draft prepared by the Drafting Com-
mittee.
M. Sugimura, delegate of Japan, will address
the Conference.
M. Sugimura (Japan)
7 ranslation : I have studied the British
proposal very carefully and I am familiar
with all its clauses, but as the Chinese delegate
is absent and as it is advisable that a decision
should only be taken with the co-operation
of us all, I suggest that the discussion of the
British proposal should be postponed until
next week, particularly as we shall then have
further questions to consider. That will also
give me an opportunity of discussing this
question with my own colleagues.
The President
Translation : Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh, dele-
gate of Persia, will address the Conference.
1 See previous page (Viscount Cecil's speech).


Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia)
Translation : The representatives of cer-
tain of the producing countries, such as Turkey,
Egypt and the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats
and Slovenes, are absent ; moreover, we have
not the text of the proposal before us. In these
circumstances, I think it is useless to open the
discussion.
IVI. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation: I wish to point out that, though
I was absent for a moment, my substitute was
here.
The President
Translation : Viscount Cecil, delegate of
the British Empire, will address the Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
May I say that, of course, I should not think
of pressing any delegate to proceed with the
discussion if he wanted further time to consider it.
I only submit it as a possible course to adopt
and am ready to withdraw from it if any
delegate does not think it is right.
I should have thought that, since the general
principle of this Protocol has now been before
the Conference for some days, and as the
Japanese delegate has been kind enough to
say that he has studied it (I know that he has
studied it with the greatest care), we might have
gone as far as to accept the principle of it to-
day, leaving all discussions of detail and final
acceptance until the next plenary meeting of
the Conference, when we shall have the defi-
nitive text before us.
I am extremely sorry that the delegate for
Persia has not studied the alternative text, and
I see that my friend the delegate of the King-
dom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes is now
in his place. He knows quite well that the
proposal was not mine but his. I was quite
content to stand by my original draft, but as
he was called away on urgent business I ven-
tured to put his proposal before the Conference
as my own. In these circumstances, I should
have thought though I do not, as I say,
want to press the matter an inch if any dele-
gate would prefer to adjourn it we could get
as far as accepting the general principle, subject
to a consideration of the details and subject
to a final acceptance of the proposal, which,
of course, must be reserved until we have exa-
mined the details of the draft.
The President
Translation : M. Yovanovitch, delegate of
the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes,
will address the Conference.
IVI. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation : The above proposal is the
only basis on which we, as a producing country,
can discuss the Convention and eventually
adhere to it. It is to our interest to find a
formula which all the producing countries
can accept. All these countries have accepted
Viscount Cecil?s proposal on another basis, and it
is in the interest of the Conference that a for-
mula should be found which would bring
together all the delegates.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia) ;
Translation : I should like to point out to
the delegate of the Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes that I have only accepted
the proposal ad referendum.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) ;
1 understand that.
The President
Translation: M. Daladier, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
M. Daladier (France) ;
Translation : I should like to support the
proposal that the Conference should adopt, at
any rate, the principle of the additional Pro-
tocol. The Japanese delegate said just now
that, since the Chairman of the Chinese delega-
tion had left, it would be difficult to discuss
certain questions in his absence. I do not
think, however, that M. Sugiraura intends to
lay down the principle that we must await the
return of the first Chinese delegate before con-
tinuing our work and bringing it to the conclu-
sion which all the world is expecting.
I do not see why we should not accept Viscount
Cecil?s proposal, while reserving the right to
amend it on any particular point. The French
delegation also has drafts of an additional Pro-
tocol, which call for discussion and amalga-
mation with the proposals made by other dele-
gations. We should save valuable time if
we took this decision to-night, with the reser-
vation that the views of all the Powers should
receive legitimate satisfaction in order to arrive
at a really uniform agreement.
If I correctly understood Viscount Cecil?s
remarks, the idea expressed regarding this point
appeared to me wholly just and in conformity
with the general idea of the Protocol which
the French delegation wishes to submit to this
Conference. In this connection, I desire to
state, in reply to the objections raised by the
delegate of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats
and Slovenes, that France does not ask the
European States to take measures of such a
radical and drastic nature as to produce the
disastrous results to which I myself drew atten-
tion this morning. In a general way, what we
ask the producing countries to do is to take
such measures that the illicit export of raw
opium from their territory should not paralyse
the efforts which we are determined to make
in our Far Eastern territories with a view to
reducing the consumption of prepared opium
until it finally disappears.
Since this principle, which the French dele-
gation has always considered as fundamental,
is also so considered by the British delegation,
and since the delegate of the Kingdom of the
Serbs, Croats and Slovenes has stated that,
in the circumstances in which it is proposed, he
is able to accept it, together with all the other
producing countries, except those of the Far
East, I should like to ask why the Conference
should not take an immediate decision. At this
moment it is in a position to take a reasonable
decision.
I associate myself with the remarks made by
Viscount Cecil, and I request the Conference to
adopt the principle of the Protocol submitted
by him. {Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. Sugimura, delegate of
Japan, will address the Conference.
IVI. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation: I should like to make our point


of view clear in order to avoid any subsequent
misunderstanding. We are in favour of any
kind of improvement which might be made
in the Hague Convention. We desired to go
even further than the British proposal, but we
naturally accept the principle contained in this
proposal, with possibly some reservations
which equity or the ideals of justice and huma-
nity might demand.
The President
Translation : Does any member wish to
express any objections to the principles laid
down in the British proposal ?
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh, delegate of Persia,
will address the Conference.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia)
Translation : I will propose the following
text for Article i, which may possibly give satis-
faction to everybody :
?The Contracting Powers recognise that
Chapter I of the Hague Convention of 1912
involves for each of them an obligation to
exercise in their territory such an effective
control over the production and distribu-
tion of raw opium as to prevent opium-
smuggling, which constitutes a serious obs-
tacle to the effective prohibition of the
use of prepared opium in those territories
where such use is temporarily authorised.?
I could accept that without reservation.
The President
Translation : I request the Persian dele-
gate to send me this text for transmission to
the Drafting Committee.
As regards the question of principle, I think
there is no difference of opinion regarding the
British proposal, which will subsequently be
submitted to the Conference. {Assent.)
I am obliged to ask the Drafting Committee
to hold its first official meeting to-morrow
morning at n o?clock.
As regards the next plenary meeting, I
shall make a definite announcement later. This
meeting, however, will not take place on
Monday.
The Conference rose at 7.45 p.m.

86. CONSIDERATION OF THE DRAFT PRO-
TOCOLTO BE SIGN ED SIIVIULTAN EOUS-
LY WITH THE CONVENTION AND TO
FORM PART OF THE PROCEEDINGS
OF THE SECOND OPIUM CONFERENCE:
REVISED TEXT SUBMITTED BY THE
DRAFTING COMMITTEE.
The President
Translation : The meeting is open. The
first item on our agenda is the examination of
the revised text of the draft Protocol.
I venture first to draw your attention to the
fact that certain corrections should be made in
the text which you have before you.
As regards Article I, the text drawn up by
the Drafting Committee is not quite in con-
formity with the proposal submitted by the
Serb-Croat-Slovene delegate. The change to
be made in the present text has been accepted
by the author of the draft, and consequently
I do not think it will be necessary to go into
details.
As regards Article 11, you will see in the
third and fourth lines the words : ?... its obli-
gation under Article I of the present Protocol?.
This expression is not correct, because the
"obligation? does not arise in virtue of Article I
of the Protocol but in virtue of the Hague
Convention. This passage should therefore
read : ?. . . its obligation referred to in Article I
of the present Protocol . . .?
We have also made a small addition to Ar-
ticl?d IV : we have decided that Articles
33 an d ?35? of the Convention are appli-
cable and not Articles ?23? and ?25?.
I would beg you to be good enough to make
these corrections in the draft Protocol.
As you will remember, the Protocol has al-
ready been accepted in principle. I now declare
the discussion open on the text with the changes
which I have just indicated.
I call upon Viscount Cecil, delegate of the
British Empire, to speak.
Preamble.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I think
that, subject to the President?s direction, the
best course would be for us to take this Pro-
tocol paragraph by paragraph and deal with
any amendments that are made as we come
to them.
I will therefore first of all read the preamble
and ask whether there is any amendment
to it :
"The undersigned representatives of cer-
tain States signatory to the Convention
relating to dangerous drugs signed this
day, duly authorised to that effect ;
"Taking note of the Protocol signed
this day by the representatives of the
States signatories of the Convention rela-
ting to the use of prepared opium :
"Hereby agree as follows ...?
The first paragraph requires no explanation.


The second paragraph is, I think I may call on whether we receive satisfaction from the Con-
it, the compromise suggestion whereby this
Conference takes note of what the First Con-
ference is doing with reference to the stoppage
of the use of prepared opium for smoking.
I shall be very glad to answer any questions
which any delegate desires to put to me on
these two paragraphs.
The President
Translation : I would like to point out that,
in the French text, instead of ? drogues nui-
sibles? we should read ? stupe fiants?.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
I agree.
The President
Translation : Secondly, I take it that the
adoption of this Protocol by the Second Con-
ference is dependent on the acceptance by
the First Conference of the other Protocol.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
I suppose that strictly and logically the two
Protocols are quite independent, but I agree
that they form part of one common scheme,
and I should never put this Protocol before
this Conference except upon the understanding
that the First Conference was going to adopt
the other Protocol. I would not like to say
that they were absolutely dependent on one
another, but in any case, whether this Protocol
is adopted or not, the First Conference will
adopt the other Protocol, which is not depen-
dent upon this one.
The President
Translation : In any case we should take
into consideration the words ?taking note...?
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh, delegate of Persia,
will address the Conference.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia)
Translation : Mr. President, in the record
of the twenty-seventh meeting of the Conference,
held on Saturday, February 7th, I read at the
end of my proposal the following sentence :
?I could accept that without reservation ( sans
reserve)?.
As you will remember, I did not say ?sans
reserve? ; I only said that if my proposal
were agreed to 1 would accept it ad referendum.
Thereupon, certain colleagues having pointed
out that I could accept this quite harmless
proposal even sans referendum, I repeated their
words.
If you ask me what is the difference between the
expression ?sans referendum? and ?sans reserve?
I will venture briefly to explain my view. The
difference, as you are doubtless aware, is that
one can accept a proposal without asking for
new instructions which means ?sans refe-
rendum? while remaining free to make
reservations later. That is not the case, however,
if a proposal is accepted ?without reservation?,
which 1 have not the right to do and which was
not my intention.
I will ask you to allow me to state here in
the plenary Conference what I stated at the
last meeting of our Sub-Committee E. ?The
Persian delegation has participated in the
proceedings of the Committees and Sub-Commit-
tees, subject to all reservations. Our adhesion to
the resolutions of the Sub-Committees, and even
to the resolutions of the Conference, will depend
ference regarding our legitimate demand, which
has been clearly set out in our memorandum.
The members of the Conference _ know these
conditions, for we had the honour to submit
our memorandum to them at the commence-
ment of the Conference.?
This is the statement which I would request
Your Excellency to note.
Subject to this reservation, I adhere to the
Protocol which is now under discussion.
The President
Translation : I had already understood the
proposal of the Persian delegation in the sense
now indicated by the first delegate. The
modification which he desires will be made in the
Minutes, and I would request the Secretariat
to note this.
Do any members of the Conference wish to
speak on this proposal ?
Mr. Mac White, delegate of the Irish Free
State, will address the Conference.
Mr. Mac White (Irish Free State)
I would like to know whether the object of
the second paragraph of the preamble is to make
the signatories of this Convention accept res-
ponsibility for the Convention elaborated by the
First Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
No ; it only applies, and is only intended
to apply, to the specific Protocol which is
part of this arrangement. The action of the
other Conference apart from that Protocol must
be entirely on the responsilibity of that Con-
ference.
Mr. Mac White (Irish Free State)
In that case I think this second paragraph
would lead to a certain amount of misunder-
standing, and I do not see that it serves any
useful purpose. I would like to propose that
it be deleted.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
Personally, I have no particular feeling
about this paragraph. It was inserted en-
tirely to meet the views of the members of this
Conference who were anxious not altogether to
dissociate themselves from what the First
Conference might do with reference to the
suppression of opium-smoking. If there is a
feeling in the Conference that it would be better
to delete this paragraph I do not attach any
importance to it one way or another.
I might point out to the delegate of the Irish
Free State that it does not do more than take
note of the other Protocol. It does not accept
even any direct responsibility for its terms.
It is merely calling the attention of this Con-
ference to the fact that there is another Protocol
which deals with the subject of opium-smoking.
I think that it is mainly a matter of form.
Whatever the Conference desires I should accept,
though personally I would rather prefer to
leave it as it is. Ido not, however, feel very
strongly on the point.
The President
Translation : I would ask the delegate of
the Irish Free State to be good enough to put
the amendment he has just proposed into
writing. The discussion can continue.


M. El Guindy, delegate of Egypt, will
address the Conference.
?The Contracting Parties shall enact
laws or regulations for the control of the
production and distribution of raw opium
unless laws or regulations on the subject
are already in existence.?
M. El Guindy (Egypt) ;
Translation : While the delegate of the
Irish Free State is putting his amendment into
writing could we not now take a vote ?
If we take the text of the article before us,
we read
The President
?The States signatories of the present
Protocol recognise that Chapter I of the
Hague Convention of 1912 involves an obli-
gation to exercise within their territories
an effective control over the production,
distribution and exportation of raw opium
so as to prevent the smuggling of opium
from constituting a serious obstacle to the
effective suppression of the use of prepared
opium in those territories where such use
is temporarily authorised.?
Translation : We might continue the discus-
sion on Article I.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
I will do anything the President directs me
to do. On the other hand, lam a little afraid
of the discussion getting confused. Personally,
1 am quite ready to waive the putting into
writing of this amendment, because it is quite
clear that the amendment proposed is the
suppression of a paragraph.
If we analyse this article we find that it
consists of two parts. In the first, the provi-
sions of Article I of the Hague Convention
are faithfully reproduced, but in the second
part a subordinate sentence is added which
weakens the force of the Hague Convention.
The obligations of producing countries are
reduced enormously. It is stated that the
only obligation on producing countries is to
prevent the smuggling of opium from consti-
tuting a serious obstacle to the effective sup-
pression of prepared opium in those territories
where such use is temporarily authorised.
1 think that juridically this sentence is not
in its proper place. The producing countries
are not placed under any obligation whatever
to control production in their own territory.
In Article I of the Hague Convention that obli-
gation is absolute ; all smuggling must be
entirely controlled.
In my opinion the proper place for this res-
triction is in Article 11.
The President
Translation : If you agree that we can
discuss the amendment of the first delegate
of Ireland without having it in writing I will
authorise the discussion.
Mr. IVlacWhite (Irish Free State) :
After the explanation I have just heard from
Viscount Cecil I wish to withdraw the amend-
ment.
The President
Translation : Since we no longer have a
proposal for an amendment we can now vote
on the Preamble.
Are there any objections ? As there are none,
I declare the text of the Preamble adopted.
A dopted.
Articles I and 11.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
Article I reads as follows :
Article I should be worded as follows :
?The States signatories of the present
Protocol recognise that Chapter I of the
Hague Convention of 1912 involves an
obligation to exercise within their terri-
tories an effective control over the pro-
duction, distribution and exportation of
raw opium, so as to prevent the smuggling
of opium from constituting a serious
obstacle to the effective suppression of the
use of prepared opium in those territories
where such use is temporarily authorised.?
?The States signatories of the present
Protocol recognise that Chapter I of the
Hague Convention of 1912 involves an
obligation to exercise within their terri-
tories an effective control over the produc-
tion, distribution and exportation of raw
opium.
This provision is quite in conformity with
Article I of the Hague Convention. The
proper place for the supplementary sentence is,
as I have already said, in Article II of the
Protocol. Consequently Article II should be
worded as follows :
The Hague Convention provides for effective
control, as cited here. The only importance
of this paragraph is to draw the attention of
those who have signed it to the special impor-
tance of preventing smuggling. It is an aspect
of their obligation under Chapter 1 of the Hague
Convention.
?Each of the signatory States agrees to
take the necessary measures, so far as this
has not already been done, to ensure the
complete execution of its obligation under
Article I of the present Protocol so as to
prevent the smuggling of opium from
constituting a serious obstacle to the effec-
tive suppression of prepared opium in those
territories where such use is temporarily
authorised.?
The President
Translation : The discussion on Article I
is open.
M. Kircher, delegate of France, will address
the Conference.
IVI. Kircher (France)
This change in the wording would lead to
two good results : the first being that the spi-
rit of Article I of the Hague Convention would
be respected ; the second, that it would make
more clear the meaning of the new engagements
which the producing countries were willing
to take as regards the limitation of the
Translation : The French delegation has
the honour to point out that the drafting of
Articles I and II is not quite in conformity with
the spirit of the Hague Convention. This
is particularly so in the case of Article I. Article
I of the Hague Convention reads as follows :


production of opium a limitation which these
producing countries are to undertake hie et
nunc.
The President :
Translation : In order that there may be
no misunderstanding, I would request M. Kircher
to be good enough to tell me whether the phrase
?within five years from the present date?
should be inserted at the beginning or the end
of the article. If we insert part of Article I
in Article II it seems to me that the phrase is
not in its proper place at the end of the article.
It would perhaps be better to put it at the
beginning, which would then read as follows:
?Each of the signatory States agrees,
within five years from the present date . . .?
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
I think the interruption you have been good
enough to make, Mr. President, indicates,
if my friend M. Kircher will allow me to say
so, the slight inconvenience in the course
he has pursued. He has proposed an entirely
new draft for the Protocol. There is no diffe-
rence in the sense between his proposal and that
which was intended in the British draft.
Personally, I am quite content to accept
the decision of the Drafting Committee as to
which was the best drafting. I suppose it
was unavoidable for some reason which
I do not quite understand but this suggestion
was not made by the French member of the
Drafting Committee yesterday. Had it been
made, it could have been discussed then.
In the circumstances, I propose that the
suggestion made by M. Kircher should be refer-
red to the Drafting Committee, as I think that
if we try to redraft these articles in an assembly
of this size we shall almost certainly make a
mess of it.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I think that the Conference
should be able to accept Viscount Cecil?s
proposal.
As I have not the honour to be a member
of the Drafting Committee, I would venture to
make the following observation : Article lof
the draft Protocol refers to the obligations
arising under the Hague Convention ; but
other obligations will arise when the present
Protocol and the Convention which we are
drawing up come into force. For the Contrac-
ting Parties, Article 31 of the present Con-
vention replaces the provisions of Chapter I
of the Hague Convention of 1912.
I do not think it would be desirable to take
into account obligations which already arise
under the Hague Convention, but we must
above all take into account the obligations
which will arise in the future under the new
Convention.
The President
Translation : M. El Guindy, delegate of
Egypt, will address the Conference.
IVI. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : I think that we are all in
agreement with Viscount Cecil?s remarks con-
cerning the observations of the French delegate.
Instead of dealing with the drafting here we
might request the Drafting Committee to take
into account the observations which have been
made.
The President
Translation : Does Viscount Cecil wish to
reply to the opinions which have been expres-
sed ?
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
I think that the statement made by the hon-
ourable delegate for Spain is certainly well worthy
of consideration. I could not express an opinion
myself as to whether it would be necessary to
alter the drafting. It seems to me that the
question raised is entirely one of drafting,
and I think that when the Drafting Committee
reconsiders this article it will no doubt take
account of the interesting observation made by
the delegate of Spain.
The President
Translation : We have already commenced to
discuss Article 11, which has not yet been intro-
duced, but the French delegate read it when
submitting his amendment. If there is no
objection to the adoption of Article II with
all due reservations regarding its drafting
I shall consider it adopted.
Articles I and II were adopted.
Article 111.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
Article 111 is of some importance. It
reads as follows :
?The question whether the obligation
referred to in Article I has been completely
executed shall be decided, at the end of
the said period of five years, by a Commis-
sion to be appointed by the Council of
the League of Nations, whose decision
shall be final.?
It is with intention that the exact functions of
the Commission have been left rather vague in the
event of its having to discharge that particular
obligation. Those who drafted this article
believed that it would be better to leave it
to the Council of the League of Nations to
frame, when required, the necessary instructions
for that Commission rather than to attempt to
frame them now.
With regard to the proposal that the Council
of the League of Nations shall be entrusted with
the nomination of this Commission, I would
say as I think everybody here will recognise ?-
that whenever the Council has had to appoint
a Commission and it has had to do so in a
great number of cases - it has always been
most anxious to appoint a Commission which
could be relied upon to give a perfectly fair
and impartial verdict. In these circumstances,
I hope that the Conference will see that this is
the best machinery that can be devised in
order to secure absolute fairness and impar-
tiality for everyone concerned.
The President
Translation : M. Chodzko, delegate of Po-
land, will address the Conference.
m. Chodzko (Poland).
Translation : The Conference has adopted
the wording of certain of these articles. I should


like to know if the Drafting Committee, when
the draft Protocol is being revised, will take
into account the Egyptian delegate?s proposal.
I should like, Mr. President, to know your
opinion on this subject, since you have stated
that we have accepted the text.
The President
Translation : I said that the text was adop-
ted "with all due reservations regarding the
drafting??, since the Conference was agreed as
to the changes to be made.
IVS. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : As regards Article 111, which
is now being discussed, it is proposed to leave
it to the Council of the League to constitute
a Commission, from whose decision there
shall be no appeal. It is permissible to sup-
pose that the decisions of this Commission
will be taken with a view to the execution of the
obligations arising under the present Protocol.
What will be the situation then ? Will the decision
remain in the archives of the Commission or
will it be put into execution ? I should be
glad to have an explanation on this point,
and I beg to propose that Article 111 should be
amended as follows :
"The Council of the League of Nations
shall, on the report of the above-men-
tioned Commission, decide what measures
are to be taken.??
The President
Translation : I call upon Viscount Cecil,
delegate of the British Empire, to speak.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
I am much obliged to the honourable dele-
gate for Poland for his question. This Pro-
tocol, of course, must be read in connection
with the other Protocol, as I have already
pointed out. That Protocol provides that, if
the necessary measures to prevent smuggling
have been taken, an absolute obligation rests
on the consuming countries to put a stop,
within fifteen years, to opium-smoking within
their territories. The consequence of a deci-
sion by the Commission in favour of the pro-
ducing countries, if I may put it in that way,
would be the immediate creation of an absolute
obligation on the consuming countries. It
is not contemplated that any other consequence
could take place.
If, on the other hand, the Commission were
forced to report that the producing countries
had not yet been able to carry out to the full
the obligation resting upon them, I think the
matter would then have to be considered not
by the Council of the League I am in the
hands of the Conference but rather by a
new Conference of the Powers, because I
think they are directly concerned and not the
Council of the League.
The delegate for Poland will remember that
it is proposed by the First Conference that
another Conference of the Powers shall be
called within five years that would be within
the period of time mentioned in the article
before us in order to deal with the situation
which has arisen. In those circumstances,
I think perhaps he will feel that it is unneces-
sary to alter the present wording. The draft
Protocol provides that the decision of the Com-
mission shall be final, because, otherwise, it
would be only the Commission of the Council
of the League which would report to the Council,
and the Council would still be at liberty to
accept or reject its report. We think it is very
important that this Commission should act
in a strictly judicial capacity and should not
be reviewed by any body which, however dis-
tinguished and worthy of our confidence, is
yet a political and not a judicial body.
The President
Translation : M. Chodzko, delegate of Po-
land, will address the Conference.
IVi. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I think that the present
misunderstanding is due to the fact that we
are not acquainted with the Protocol which is
to be signed by the First Conference, although
we are asked in the preamble of the Protocol
before us to note the Protocol of the First
Conference.
It seems to me, then, that this discussion is
rather premature, because we do not know what
action is being taken by the First Conference.
We cannot therefore take note of it, as we are
asked to do.
In view of Viscount Cecil?s explanations, I
ought to withdraw my amendment. Viscount
Cecil has told us that under
stances it would be desirable to convene a
fresh conference. But if only one State fails
to carry out its undertakings, are we to convene
a new conference of all the States and set
all this machinery into motion ?
So long as we are unacquainted with the
Protocol of the First Conference, it is difficult
for us to take any decision. That is why I
make reservations concerning Article 111.
The President ;
Translation : Is the amendment withdrawn ?
IVI. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : As I have made a reservation,
the amendment is suspended.
The President
Translation : Does anyone else wish to
speak on Article 111 ?
Article 111 is adopted, subject to the reserva-
tion formulated by the Polish delegate. [Agreed.)
Article IV.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
This is, I think, only a technical article.
"The present Protocol shall come into
force for each of the signatory States at
the same time as the Convention relating
to dangerous drugs signed this day. Ar-
ticles "33? and "35? of the Convention are
applicable to the present Protocol.??
The purpose of the last sentence is merely
to enable other States which, unfortunately, are
not present at this Conference to-day to adhere
to the Protocol at a later date.
The President
Translation : Does anyone wish to address
the meeting on Article IV ?
Article IV was adopted.


8 7* RELATION BETWEEN THE TRAFFIC of poppy-growing in China. We have been
IN OPIUM AND THE TRAFFIC IN ARMS
AND M UNITIONS : DRAFT RESOLUTION
PROPOSED BY THE FINNISH DELEGA-
TION.
IVI. Toivola (Finland)
Before the discussion on this Protocol is
closed I wish to move a resolution, the text
of which I have given to the Secretariat. I
would respectfully ask that the text may be
distributed before I speak on it.
The President
Translation : The text of the resolution
which reads as follows, will be distributed :
"Whereas the Second Opium Conference
believes that the recrudescence of the
growth of the poppy in the Far East is
one of the most serious elements of
the world's drug problem ;
"Whereas that recrudescence is largely
due to the unfortunate political conditions
now prevailing in large territories of
Eastern Asia ;
"Whereas these unfortunate political
conditions are in their turn largely due
to the unlicenced importation of arms into
those territories from outside countries ;
"Whereas the League of Nations has
convened an International Conference on
the Traffic in Arms and Munitions to be
held in Geneva on May 4th next :
"Be it resolved :
"That the Second Opium Conference
recommends to the Council of the League of
Nations to consider the advisability of
referring the question of the unlicenced
importation of arms into the territories
in the Far East to the forthcoming Con-
ference on the Traffic in Arms and Muni-
tions with the thought that the various
interested Governments may, in the mean-
time, gather information and consider
projects in this connection in the hope of
removing what is one of the fundamental
difficulties of the world?s drug situation."
I presume that the Conference agrees to
discuss this resolution, the text of which was
not distributed before the meeting ? [Assent.)
I call upon M. Toivola, delegate of Finland,
to address the Conference.
IVI. Toivola (Finland)
Mr. President and gentlemen ; we are dis-
cussing what is, I think, at least in principle,
an important Protocol. Every one of us, I
think, agrees that the results that can be hoped
from the adoption of this Protocol are dependent
on the conditions that prevail in a large country
in Asia. As a matter of fact, for many weeks
the conditions in that country have been a most
serious obstacle to our work. If there were
no smuggling from China, I think that this
Conference and the First Conference also would
have been able to adopt more definite Protocols
than the one now before us.
We heard Viscount Cecil explain a moment
ago that the countries in which opium-smoking
is still permitted will be obliged to prohibit
and finally suppress that habit if the pro-
ducing countries are able in five years to sup-
press the over-production of raw opium. The crux
of the whole opium question is the recrudescence
told during the previous debates that there
are generals in China who force the population
to cultivate the poppy. Why do they do that ?
They want the money, or so I have been told.
They want the money to buy arms and ammu-
nition in order to continue a very unfortunate
civil war in China.
Now it happens that power to control or
deal with the opium question has been given
to the League of Nations in the same article
in which we read the following : ?The Members
of the League . . . will entrust the League with
the general supervision of the trade in arms and
ammunition with the countries ..." (see Article
23 of the Covenant, Clause d).
I should think that this Conference has
plainly shown to everybody that it is in the
interests of the whole world, as far as the
opium question is concerned, to control the
traffic in arms and ammunition in the Far
East. It so happens that next May, I think,
an international conference will be held
perhaps in this same room to deal with
questions concerning the traffic in arms and
ammunition. I think it is the duty of this
Conference to point out to the League of Nations
which has some obligations in this matter
that it is necessary to deal with the question of
the Far East in order that even the opium
question may be solved. If the League of
Nations could find it possible to put this ques-
tion on the agenda for the May Conference the
result might be that some means might be
found of putting an end to that very unfortu-
nate traffic in arms and ammunitions which
causes so much trouble to the Opium Confe-
rence.
Unfortunately, the Chinese delegate is not
here, but I remember that he, as well as Mr.
Porter, appealed to this Conference several
times to help China in her present difficulties.
I think that this Conference is still able to
show that it is not only not blaming China
but is trying to find a way by which China
can be helped out of its present difficulties.
I move that this Conference should adopt
this resolution. Of course, I understand quite
well that a resolution of such importance might
require careful consideration and, if the Pre-
sident so decides, I have no objection to the
discussion of this draft resolution being de-
ferred.
The President
Translation : lam unable to decide whether
a discussion on your proposal should be opened.
It is a matter for the Conference to decide.
Does anyone wish to speak on this question
or would the members of the Conference prefer
to postpone the discussion until to-morrow ?
Mr. Mac White, delegate of the Irish Free
State, will address the Conference.
Mr. Mac White (Irish Free State)
Mr. President, before this discussion is con-
tinued a discussion which may be interpre-
ted by some as likely to infringe the sovereign
rights of certain States I should like to have
your views as to whether this Conference is
competent to deal with it.
The President
Translation : M. Toivola, delegate of Fin-
land, will address the Conference.


M. Toivola (Finland)
May I say one word ? I cannot see that this
resolution will in any way interfere with the
sovereign rights of any country. The resolution
would only be addressed to the Council of the
League of Nations for the consideration of the
League, and if the Council should think that
the addition of this question to the agenda of
the next Armaments Conference would inter-
fere with the sovereign rights of some States,
of course it would decide not to do so. I must,
however, point out to my Irish friend that,?
under the Covenant of the League of Nations,
it is quite competent to deal with all those
questions.
The President
7 ranslation : M. Sugimura, delegate of
Japan, will address the Conference.
M. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : I do not doubt the absolute
sincerity of the honourable delegate of Fin-
land, but, as the question is really important, I
should be glad if he would be more precise.
The words ?Far East?? or ?Eastern Asia?? are
very vague. Japan is a Far Eastern country,
but there is no disorder in Japan. If Japan
undertakes to trade in arms, we do not desire
to be bound by the proposal now submitted
to us. We insist on our full liberty of action
and cannot agree that Japan should be
bound in any way. Therefore I ask you,
M. Toivola, to be good enough to define your
expression ?Far East?? or ?Eastern Asia??.
Further, I read in the proposal : ?Whereas
these unfortunate political conditions are in
their turn largely due to the unlicensed impor-
tation of arms into those territories from outside
countries...? I venture to suggest to the dele-
gate for Finland that he has studied the Chi-
nese question here at Geneva and that he is
consequently not well acquainted either with
the realities or the facts of the situation in the
Far East.
I should like to point out one or two facts
which may enlighten him on the subject.
At the Washington Conference in 1921-1922,
at which M. Duchene was present, we laid the
bases of agreements concerning China in the
highest spirit of loyalty and impartiality.
These agreements were only drawn up two
or three years ago, and during the civil war
which has recently occurred, they have been
applied loyally and in their entirety.
I wish to point out that the control of arms
is carried out much more effectively and better
than the control of narcotics, and I should like
to know quite definitely what the Finnish
delegate proposes. I should like to know
exactly what he has in his mind. I cannot
accept the phrase ?Whereas etc.? as it stands,
for the words ?largely due to unlicensed impor-
tation? are not in accordance with the facts.
The political situation of the country is due to
far deeper causes than the traffic in arms. I
admit that perhaps the political conditions
are due to a small extent to the unlicensed im-
portation of arms, but I cannot believe that
this is so to any large extent.
I do not for one moment doubt the sincerity
and good faith of the honourable delegate for
Finland. I do not level any reproach ; I
merely venture to offer a few observations
to appeal to him and request him to be good
enough to consider the question afresh and to
state his views with greater precision. We
might then resume our discussion of this
interesting proposal on the basis of a new draft
resolution.
The President
Translation : I call upon Viscount Cecil,
delegate of the British Empire, to speak.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
I have listened with great interest to the
two speeches which have been made. The
subject has been in our minds for some time,
but I had no idea that it was going to be raised
this morning.
There seem to be two ways in which the
cultivation of the poppy in China is connected
with the traffic in arms. In the first place, it
is, of course, undoubtedly the case that it is
owing to the civil disturbances in China that
it has been impossible to enforce the Chinese
laws against the cultivation of the poppy.
As long as these civil disturbances continue,
there is only too much reason to fear that these
laws will not be enforced. Therefore so far
as the importation of arms enables those civil
disturbances to continue it is connected with
the growth of the poppy.
There is, however, a much more direct
relation which I think has not been taken suf-
ficiently into account by the delegate of Japan.
Undoubtedly the poppy is grown, as the French
delegation has pointed out, under direct orders
from the provincial authorities in order to
pay for the arms which are imported. I do
not think it can be disputed that pressure is
brought to bear on the population in certain
parts of China to grow the poppy in order to
pay for arms. This is a much more direct
connection between the growth of the poppy
and the traffic in arms.
The delegate of Japan will remember that
in addition to what was done at Washington
a Chinese Arms Embargo Agreement was
entered into by certain Powers as long ago as
1919. I think that Japan was one of those
Powers.
IVi. Sugimura (Japan) : Yes.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) ;
Japan has discharged her obligations under
that agreement as she always does strictly
discharge her obligations. Since this discussion
began, it has been brought to my notice that
there is in yesterday?s London papers a notice
calling the attention of British subjects to the
importance of not in any way overlooking that
obligation and recounting the various steps
which the British Government has taken to
see that it is strictly enforced. Therefore it has
a certain reality of which I was not aware until
this discussion began.
I think that it would be unwise for this Con-
ference to embark on a full discussion of this
matter this morning. It comes as an entirely
new proposal to me at any rate. I had no
idea that it was going to be raised, and I
imagine that that is the case with the great
majority of the people present. I think that
we should be allowed twenty-four hours in
which to consider the line we ought to take -?-
whether it is, on the whole, desirable for the
Conference to pass a resolution of this kind or


not or whether it will be sufficient that the discus-
sion on the matter has taken place so that the
Council of the League, which is represented
here by many delegates, will be aware of the
interest which this Conference takes in this
subject and will be able to consider whether
or not it is a matter which ought to be brought
to the notice of the Arms Traffic Conference.
It seems to me that this is possibly the course
which we ought to pursue. We ought possibly
to accept this resolution, modifying it in the way
indicated by the delegate of Japan. It would
be absurd to word it in such a way that Japan
might be included. I hope, therefore, that the
Conference will, without any prolonged discus-
sion, agree that this matter should be adjourned
until to-morrow for further consideration.
The President
Translation : The Conference has before it
a proposal to adjourn the discussion for twenty-
four hours. We must discuss this proposal,
because we have to take a decision before we
can continue our work. There are still two
members down to speak.
I call upon M. El Guindy, delegate of Egypt,
to address the Conference.
IVI. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : The present proposal is that
we should adjourn until to-morrow. I suggest
that this adjournment should be prolonged
until the end of the examination of the Con-
vention. If this were done there would only
be one set of recommendations to be submitted
to the League of Nations.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Duchene, dele-
gate of France, to speak.
IVI. Duchene (France)
Translation : I cannot do otherwise than
support the motion for adjournment which has
just been submitted. I agree that we require
time to consider the resolution which has been
submitted to the Conference by the Finnish
delegate. For my part I had no intention,
either now or later, of intervening in a discus-
sion on the subject-matter of this resolution ;
but since the Japanese delegate has referred to
our common experience at the Washington
Conference, I would like at this point to Mate
the impression which I have received on reading
this text for the first time :
The text can certainly be modified : if on
certain points it calls forth ideas which did
not form part of the author?s intentions, the
changes to be made in the text will dissipate
all such misgivings. As the Japanese delegate
has said, no blame can be attached to the great
country which he represents. I also believe ?
and the explanations of the Finnish delegate
would suffice to clear up this point if it were
necessary that the country concerned is
China. But ought we, as the Japanese dele-
gate suggests, to go so far in a text of this kind
as to mention China by name. I think, gentle-
men, that that would be a serious mistake. We
cannot bring an indictment against any par-
ticular country. China, herself a great country,
both at Washington and after Washington,
has only formulated one request, and that is
that no contraband in arms and munitions shall
be carried on in her territory. You know that,
side by side with an official China, which has
the best intentions, there is a China which
I might call ?the more or less real China?.
It is undoubtedly this ?real? China which
encourages the cultivation of the poppy in
order to obtain the money required to procure
arms and munitions.
I cannot yet say what will be the ultimate
fate of this draft resolution, but, in any case,
it will have served a useful purpose. We should
thank the Finnish delegate for having drawn the
attention of the Conference to a problem which
is of considerable interest because it is not
unconnected with the production of opium in
the Far East.
If this draft resolution is abandoned, the
observations which it has called forth here and
which will appear in the records of the Confe-
rence will indicate to the Conference on the
Trade in Arms the connection that exists
between the special production in certain parts
of the Far East and illicit arms. That will
be a very important fact for the Conference
which is to meet in May with a view to studying
the problem of the trade in arms and munitions
throughout the world. If its attention is
specially drawn to a particular and very impor-
tant aspect of the question, it will be thanks to
the draft resolution submitted to this Confe-
rence by the Finnish delegate.
The President
Translation : I now call upon the author
of the proposal M. Toivola, delegate of
Finland to speak.
IV!. Toivola (Finland)
Translation : I am not opposed to the
Egyptian delegate?s proposal for an adjourn-
ment. We can quite well continue this dis-
cussion after we have discussed the Conven-
tion.
Moreover, I must thank the Japanese dele-
gate for the observations which he made with
that unfailing courtesy which we all appre-
ciate. I must thank him particularly for his
remarks on the question of the illicit impor-
tation of opium into China. I shall have
occasion to reply later on to the questions
which he has raised.
The President
Translation : M. Sugimura, delegate of
Japan, will address the Conference.
IV!. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : In order to avoid all misun-
derstanding, I repeat that I have never suggested
that the words ?territories in the Far East. .. ?
should be replaced by the word ?China?.
That would have been a very serious error for
a delegate of Japan to make. I repeat, there-
fore, that I have never suggested this word.
Were such a suggestion made it would have a
very disastrous effect on public opinion in
China. I therefore trust that you will not
allow this misunderstanding to arise.
The President
Translation: 1 think lam interpreting the
views of the Conference when I state that it
agrees to the adjournment of the examination
of this question until after the Convention has
been discussed.
Does anyone oppose this suggestion ?


The proposal for adjournment, as thus dehired,
is adopted.
Adopted.
88. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
SUB-COMMITTEE B : ARTICLE 1 OF
THE UNITED STATES SUGGESTIONS :
CONTINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
The President
Translation : At our last meeting we
postponed the discussion of Article I of the
American proposals.
The discussion on this subject, which has
been included in the agenda of to-day?s meeting,
may now be opened.
I call upon the Indian delegate, Mr. Walton,
to speak.
Mr. Walton (India)
Mr. President and gentlemen, the Govern-
ment of India would greatly prefer, as regards
this Article I of the American proposals, that
no alteration should be made in the correspon-
ding article of the Hague Convention which is
reproduced in the provisional draft Convention
that has been distributed to the Conference.
Its reason for this conservative attitude is
that there appears to be a great advantage
in keeping this subject of the consumption
of opium in opium-producing countries apart
for consideration by some future conference.
It seems quite possible that the Council of
the League may find it desirable in the near future
to call a conference to deal with the subject,
as a result, perhaps, of the enquiries in the
Far East which are contemplated. If that
should happen, the Government of India would
also have an opportunity of pursuing its own
enquiries into those questions of opium-eating
in India with which it is concerned. It would
then, perhaps, be able to come to the conference
with constructive proposals, which, unfor-
tunately, it has not been able to do at this
Conference, because it really had no idea that
the matter was going to be discussed.
There seems a danger that if we deal with
the matter now we may find we have dealt
with it in an imperfect and premature way, and
for that reason the Indian delegation would
greatly prefer that the article of the Hague
Convention should not be altered and that this
Conference should adopt the article which
figures as Article 2 in our present draft Conven-
tion, which is the same.
If it should turn out that the members of the
Conference are not prepared to adopt that solu-
tion, then the Indian delegation would consider
as sympathetically as possible, and with every
desire to come to an agreed solution, the Ame-
rican text of the article. It is possible in
fact I think it is probable that we should be
able to accept it if it were amended by the
introduction of the words ?for export? after
the word ?available?. The article would then
read : ?The Contracting Parties shall enact
effective laws or regulations for the control of
the production and distribution of raw opium so
that there will be no surplus available for
export for purposes not strictly medical or
scientific?, and then would follow the proviso
regarding the question of opium-smoking, which
will, of course, in any case be necessary.
The Government of India would not have
the slightest objection to an article in that
sense, because India is prepared to confine
its exports of raw opium to purposes duly
certified by the Governments of the importing
countries as being medical or scientific, with
the exception, of course, which is covered by
the separate proviso in the American text of
the article, of the supply of raw opium which
she sends on the demand of countries where the
use of prepared opium is still authorised. Those
demands also are invariably certified by the
Governments of those countries, and in fact
they come from the actual Governments them-
selves in most cases. Apart from that, the
effect of the article as proposed to be amended
would be to confine the international traffic in
raw opium to medical and scientific purposes.
I submit that there are various minor advan-
tages in this amendment besides some greater
ones. In the first place, it would give a more
logical and symmetrical structure to the Con-
vention, because we should then have a con-
vention dealing merely with drugs and the
international traffic in drugs and with the
import and export of the raw substances.
We have already excluded opium-smoking
from the Convention, and the control of the
consumption of the coca leaf in the producing
countries has also been excluded on the recom-
mendation of Sub-Committee C. The reason
for the exclusion of the coca leaf was interes-
ting. It was that the limitation to medical
and scientific purposes of the consumption and
production for consumption of coca leaf in
some of the producing countries is imprac-
ticable, on account of the difficulties connected
with its use by the natives of those countries.
The difficulties with regard to the eating of
raw opium in India and other countries are not,
of course, quite the same, but still those opium-
producing countries have difficulties, and it
would be quite logical, I submit, that this Con-
ference should recognise them in the same way
that it has recognised the difficulties of coun-
tries which produce the coca leaf.
The Conference was called for the three objects
to which I have already referred : the limi-
tation to medical and scientific purposes of the
manufacture of drugs, the importation of
the raw material, and the exportation of the
raw material for such manufacture. I submit
that my amendment derives a considerable
amount of support from the actual wording
of Resolution VI of the Assembly of 1923,
which everyone recognises ought to be the basis
of our work.
The resolution, where it refers to the limi-
tation to medical and scientific use of the
production of raw opium and coca leaf, contains
the words ?for export? ?the limitation of
the production of raw opium and coca leaf for
export to the amount required for such medi-
cinal and scientific purposes?.
Perhaps those are reasons of minor importance,
but I would like just to mention one important
reason, and a reason which I think is, by itself,
convincing in favour of an amendment, either
in this sense or in some other sense which will
have the same result. My proposal makes
clear what I know to be the intention of this
Conference : that there is no claim to interfere
unduly in matters which are acknowledged
to be matters of purely domestic jurisdiction.
On the other hand, if the article were not


amended, its purport would certainly be to
apply a particular method of regulation
namely, the medical and scientific test to
the use of raw opium within the borders of
the countries that produce it.
I do not want to go again into the merits of
the question, as I believe that the Conference is
fully convinced that there are no abuses of
opium in India requiring so drastic a remedy.
But, apart from its merits, the article, if una-
mended, would clearly involve interference in
a question which is admittedly wholly one of
domestic jurisdiction : namely, the method by
which certain States, having a peculiarly close
interest in the matter, shall apply the general
obligation of control that already exists.
The unamended article, I submit, would
therefore defeat what I believe to be the inten-
tion of the Conference and would set up a prin-
ciple of interference in matters of purely domes-
tic concern. As ardent supporters of the League
of Nations, the members of the Indian delega-
tion feel and they have also learnt from
others who have the best ability to judge
that this would be a very unfortunate principle
for the League of Nations to adopt.
There is just one point to which I would like
to refer before I sit down. It relates to a
further difficulty, apart from those which
have already been mentioned, in connection
with the American proposals, so far as India
is concerned. You have heard of the difficul-
ties, from the medical, social and religious points
of view, which would be attendant upon the
application of this particular test to the eating
of opium in India. Apart from these there is
a grave constitutional difficulty which, by itself,
would make it impossible for the Government
of India to accept the proposal.
? Under the Government of India Act passed
by the British Parliament in 1919, eight of
the Indian Provinces, of which there are nine,
enjoy autonomy with regard to a large number
of questions, and the question of the internal
trade in and the use of raw opium is one of
these. As regards the export trade, on the
other hand, the Government of India remains
directly responsible. The control of the internal
traffic in opium has been placed, however, in
the hands of the Provincial Governments,
which, in regard to this matter, are fully repre-
sentative of and responsible to the people in
the Provinces.
It follows, then, that the Indian people have
the power, should they desire to do so, to enact
further legislation on the subject of opium with
a view, for example, to restricting it to medical
purposes, and they also have the power, if
they wish, to introduce any change of policy
with regard to the administration in respect
of opium. On the other hand, no new legis-
lation nor any new policy can be forced upon
the autonomous legislatures in the Provinces.
You will at once see that the Government of
India would be taking a retrogade step, it
would be turning its back on a great democratic
advance which has recently been made, if it
were to take away this freedom that has been
given to the Indian people and were to compel
them to regulate the subject of opium in a
particular way.
If anybody wants to know what the wishes
of the people of India actually are, I submit
that they can best be ascertained by the action
taken by the representatives of the people
during the last four years the period, that is,
during which India has enjoyed this new
constitution. During that time certain mea-
sures have been taken in the matter of opium,
but measures having regard to opium-smoking
only. This habit is regarded as a vice in India,
and some of the new Provincial Governments
have taken various steps to suppress it more
effectively even than was the case before.
But with regard to opium-eating, they have
taken no single step to alter in any way the
policy or the legislation which was bequeathed
to them by the Government of India.
No doubt members of the Conference have
seen a telegram from the Indian National
Congress which was distributed about a fortnight
ago and which criticises the policy of the Go-
vernment of India (Document O. D. C. 87).
Perhaps I might explain that the Congress,
which is the Congress of a political party, has
actually a majority in more than one of the
Provinces of India. If, therefore, their cri-
ticism were justified they have it in their own
power in those provinces to carry out the reforms
which they consider desirable. Moreover, if
in any province the autonomous legislature
should desire to restrict the use of opium to
medical and scientific purposes or to regulate
it in any other way, the Government of India,
as Lord Hardinge announced at the Assembly
of 1923, would place no obstacle in their way
and would even do everything in its power to
co-operate with them in any measures having
that object in view which were both lawful
and practicable.
I beg to move the inclusion of the words
?for export? in Article I of the United States
Suggestions.
The President
Translation : When the Indian delegate
refers to the amendment to be submitted, does
he mean the American proposal including the
words ?and coca leaves? or excluding them ?
Mr. Walton (India)
Excluding the words ?and coca leaves?.
The President
Translation : M. El Guindy, delegate of
Egypt, will address the Conference.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : I hope that production will
not be excluded, for if production is not limited
it gives rise to smuggling, and it is necessary
for us to combat such smuggling. We have
been told that there are administrative ques-
tions and political questions. It has been said
that certain States represented by others at
our Conference will not submit to these laws.
I think these recalcitrant States should be
indicated. We could invite them to discuss
the matter and could perhaps persuade them
to accept such reductions. I would retain
the article as it stands without adding the
words ?for export?.
The President
Translation : You do not include coca
leaves ?
M. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : We are now only discussing
opium.


In reply to the statement made by the honou-
rable delegate for Egypt, I would suggest,
Mr. President, that the text of the article as
proposed to be amended meets his point of
view, because it would expressly provide that
production should be so limited that there
would be no surplus available for export,
except for medical and scientific purposes.
M. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : Why do we insist on laying
down no restrictions on production itself ?
Mr. Walton (India)
I will try to explain my meaning. Such
restrictions would be placed on production as
would ensure that no surplus was available
for export except for medical and scientific
purposes. The honourable delegate for Egypt
was afraid that, if export were restricted, a
great surplus would accumulate in the producing
countries, which would find its way into the
contraband traffic. As I understand the article,
however, as proposed to be amended, the
Contracting Parties would undertake not to
allow the accumulation of such surplus which
would be available for export either through
licit or illicit channels.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : I did not know until just now
that there were States which allowed the expor-
tation for other uses than medical and scien-
tific needs. Since such limitation of expor-
tation -already exists, we should like to obtain
the limitation of production itself.
The President
Translation : Does anyone wish to speak
on this subject ?
As no one wishes to speak, we should, I
think, vote on the question.
The situation in this matter is somewhat
complicated. We have first of all the American
proposal (it being understood that coca leaves
are excluded.) To this proposal has been added
the amendment of the Indian delegation sug-
gesting that, after the words ?no surplus avai-
lable? should be added the words ?for export?.
Moreover, the Egyptian delegate wishes to
retain the American proposal. Finally we
have an Italian proposal contained in a note
distributed a few days ago asking that the
American proposal concerning the production
of raw opium should be accepted in principle
by the Conference and referred by it to the
Drafting Committee as a basis for its work.
Each State would be free to adhere to the Ame-
rican proposal or to make such reservations
as it deemed necessary.
We should, I think, vote first of all on the
Indian delegation?s amendment, which is an
amendment involving an addition to the ori-
ginal proposal.
According to our rules of procedure, unless
the Conference decides to the contrary, the
vote should be taken by roll-call, but perhaps
it will not be necessary for us to do this.
M. Pinto-Escalier (Bolivia)
Translation : Before voting on Article I
as amended I request the President to have
this amendment read.
Translation : We will take the vote first
of all on the Indian amendment.
M. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : I wish to point out that coca
leaves are not being dealt with in this case.
I have accepted the very reasonable observa-
tion made by the Bolivian delegate.
The President
Translation : We quite agree with the first
Italian delegate. I thought the Conference
understood that.
M. Daladier, delegate of France, will address
the Conference.
M. Daladier (France)
Translation : We have arrived at a point
in the discussion at which I, for one, do not
very clearly understand the meaning or the
scope either of the Indian delegation?s amend-
ment, or of the reservations of the Bolivian
delegate concerning the question whether coca
leaves shall or shall not be included.
We could, however, all come to an agreement
adopting the modified articles the text of
which M. Kircher submitted a short time ago.
If the Conference adopts, as I think it intends
to adopt at any rate in principle the text
submitted to us by M. Kircher, there is no
longer any reason to take a vote or to refrain
from voting on the Indian delegation?s amend-
ment, in view of the fact that the problem will
be solved by the new text which we have sub-
mitted to you.
If, in Article I of this draft Protocol, you say,
as we have proposed, that the signatory States
recognise the force of Chapter I of the Hague
Convention which laid down, and continues to
lay down, that they are to exercise effective
control throughout their territory over the
distribution and exportation of raw opium,
I do not understand why we should re-open
the discussion of Chapter I of the American
proposals, nor why we should spend any time
in discussing the amendment of the Indian
delegation, which seems to me to be fully
covered by the drafting of this article. This
is the question of procedure which I wish to
submit to the Conference.
M. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation : May I support the French
delegate?s observations? I think I am also
interpreting the views of the other producing
countries. This question has already been
settled.
Mr. Clayton (India)
On behalf of the Indian delegation, I should
like to say that we accept the articles in the
first Protocol as a very satisfactory solution
of the question. I adhere to the proposals
of the French delegate.
M. Dendramis (Greece)
Translation : I accept the articles as pro-
posed by the French delegation.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) ;
The only thing I would like to say is that
I think it may possibly be necessary to
make some slight amendment in the wording


of the Protocol if that solution is adopted by
the Conference.
The President
Translation : M. Pinto-Escalier, delegate of
Bolivia, will address the Conference.
IVf. Pinto-Escalier (Bolivia)
Translation : The French delegate has said
that he did not undersand the reservations
made by the Bolivian delegation.
The reason for these reservations is that this
is not a question affecting the Protocol which
has already been approved but the second point
of the agenda concerning Article I. This article
refers specifically to coca leaves, and I therefore
wish to make sure of this point before taking
part in the vote.
The President
Translation : Mehmed Sureya Bey, dele-
gate of Turkey, will address the Conference.
Mehmed Sureya Bey (Turkey)
Translation : In Sub-Committee Bwe drew
up a report, but we were not able to agree,
because many of the producing countries
formulated reservations regarding the adoption
of Article I of the United States suggestions.
I think, therefore, that, with the exception
of the Persian delegation, we are in agreement
concerning the first article of the Hague Con-
vention. That is why I support the French
proposal.
The President
Translation : Am I to interpret the last
statement of the first Indian delegate as meaning
that the Indian amendment has been withdrawn?
Mr. Walton (India)
Yes, in favour of the French proposal.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
I think that we ought to be quite clear about
this, because it is an important matter. I
should like to know exactly what the atti-
tude of the Italian delegation is. I do not
know whether it intends to proceed with its
motion or whether the suggestion is that the
Italian motion, and consequently the Indian
amendment to it, should be withdrawn and
that there should be substituted for it the pro-
posal of the French delegation. If that is the
proposal I understand it, but I am not quite sure
whether it is. Ido not know what the exact
effect of that would be, without any further
amendment, on the attitude of some members
of the Conference who desire to confine the
use of opium to scientific and medical purposes.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Falcioni,
delegate of Italy, to speak.
IVI. Falcioni (Italy) ;
Translation : As the Indian delegation has
withdrawn its amendment, the Italian dele-
gation also withdraws its amendment.
The President
Translation : We have now two proposals
before us : the American proposal, coca leaves
being excluded, as supported by the Egyptian
delegation, and the French proposal, which
I understand to be as follows : The French
delegation proposes the text of the Hague
Convention without any addition and then the
two articles of the Protocol, amended by the
Drafting Committee.
As the first Egyptian delegate maintains his
proposal, we must vote on the American pro-
posal as it stands, excepting coca leaves.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) : I confess
that I feel in a considerable difficulty about
this. Ido not want to be hurried or that my
Government should be hurried in the
tance of a solution of this question, which on
examination might not turn out to be satis-
factory. It is now after i o?clock. I would
very respectfully ask the Conference to defer
a decision on this matter until we meet again
this afternoon, when I feel that my mind, at
any rate, will be much clearer as to the exact
position than it is at the present moment.
The President
Translation : If the Conference agrees, we
will act on this suggestion. {Assent.)

89. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
SUB-COMMITTEE B : ARTICLE 1 OF
THE UNITED STATES SUGGESTIONS :
CONTINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION :
APPOINTM ENT OF A SUB-COMMITTEE.
The President
Translation : The meeting is open. Before
continuing the discussion of the second point
on our agenda for to-day, I will sum up the
present position.
The Conference has before it the American
suggestion, regarding Article 1, which is
supported by the Egyptian delegate, and a
suggestion put forward by the French dele-
gation.
As regards the first point, the text of Article 1,
as we are dealing with it, does not include coca
leaves. We also have before us a slight amend-
ment to the second paragraph of the article
in question, which consists in replacing the
words ?in conformity with Chapter II of the
present Convention? by ?in conformity with
Chapter II of the Hague Convention of 1912?.
The French suggestion is to retain the clause
of Article 1 of the Hague Convention of 1912 in
the Protocol, as amended by M. Kircher.
These two proposals are. submitted to the
Conference for consideration. The discussion
is open.
1 call upon M. Loudon, delegate of the
Netherlands, to speak.
M. Loudon (Netherlands)
Translation : Mr. President, we have already
discussed this article at length this morning
and I doubt whether we shall reach any conclu-
sion if we continue in this way. It seems to me
that the French proposal which I think
is an excellent one takes no account at all
of the words at the end of the first paragraph
of Article 1 of the American proposal which
refer to medical and scientific uses. I think
we ought to keep these words, and we might
also add ?for exportation?. In this way, I
think we shall be able to reach an agreement.
The Egyptian proposal went altogether too
far, and the French proposal, as it stands, is
not exactly what we require. It seems to
me that, by adding a few words such as I have
indicated, we should retain the idea of restric-
tion to medical and scientific purposes which
is contained in the American suggestion. I
hope we shall be able to find a good formula, and
I have put forward my suggestion with a view
to cutting short a discussion which threatened
to be interminable.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. El Guindy,
delegate of Egypt, to speak.
M. Ei Guindy (Egypt) ;
Translation: Mr. President, when the honou-
rable French delegate moved his amendment
to the two articles, I was one of the first to
approve it, because it referred to the Protocol.
In my opinion, the Protocol of a Convention is
like the preface to a book ; the detail must be
inserted in the Convention itself.
We are now discussing Article 1 of the
Convention, and two points of view have been
expressed. There are those who do not want to
reduce production including in this term, pro-
duction for exportation, for use in the producing
country and for medical and scientific purposes
and there are those who do not wish to restrict
production to the requirements for medical and
scientific purposes. The honourable Netherlands
delegate has just expressed a third point of
view: that of restricting exportation to the
requirements for medical and scientific purposes
only. I have always understood the proposal
in that sense. But what I desire to see reduced is
production, because, as everyone knows, the
reduction of internal consumption only is a
source of contraband. If countries confine
their exports to the requirements for medical
and scientific purposes, what is going to be done
with the surplus ? I should like to have a reply
to this question.
The President
Translation : I call upon Viscount Cecil,
delegate of the British Empire, to address the
Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
Since the Conference was good enough to
adjourn its discussion this morning, I have
been doing my best to consider this very com-
plicated and difficult problem. The position
seems to me to be this: There has been a gene-
ral acceptance of the proposal that, so far as
the traffic in opium is concerned, the production
of raw opium ought to be so controlled as to
be restricted to production for medical and
scientific purposes.
If I have rightly read the proceedings of
the Advisory Committee and the Assembly, that
principle was taken for granted ; indeed, the
resolution under the terms of which this Con-
ference was convened seems to indicate that
that is the question we are required to consider,
because I notice that in one of the phrases it
says : ?and of the limitation of the production
of raw opium and the coca leaf for export to
the amount required for such medicinal and
scientific purposes?. Our mandate, therefore,
certainly requires us to consider whether we
should not lay down as a principle that the
production of raw opium should be limited,
at any rate so far as export is concerned, to
medical and scientific purposes.
On the other hand, we have heard from the
Indian delegation, and from other delegations,
very strong protests against the conception that
an international convention should affect and
deal with the use to which a country puts its
own products within its own borders. Evidently,
other countries have a right to require that a
country producing a drug like opium should so
control its production as to ensure that no
surplus which could be used for wrong purposes
is distributed throughout the world. This, how-
ever, seems to be the limit of the interest which
other nations can take in the matter, and it
seems to me, therefore, that these two principles
have to be combined. Is it possible to find
a form of words which will secure the control
of production, with the object of confining
the traffic in opium to medical and scientific
purposes, without interfering with the internal
sovereignty of any country ? That seems to
me, if I understand it rightly, the problem
which we have to consider.
The Egyptian delegate will, I am sure, forgive
me when I say that I think he goes too far.


He proposes boldly to say, without any excep-
tion, that every country is to be bound to
reduce its production of opium to the amount
required for medical and scientific purposes.
That proposal goes further than the American
one, because the Americans always said that
they did not wish to interfere with domestic
matters. It goes further than the Italian pro-
posal, which expressly said that it was desired
to reserve to every country the right to deal
with its own affairs. lam not quoting the
actual words, but this represents their substance.
In my view the Egyptian proposal goes further
than any international body ought to go.
On the other hand, though I was very much
attracted by the French suggestion, I am not
sure whether, when it is worked out, it does
not sweep away altogether the idea of con-
fining the production of opium to medical
and scientific purposes, for, if it is desired to
do anything more than was done in the Protocol,
the Protocol merely forbids smuggling and
leaves the control of opium, apart from smug-
gling, quite untouched.
It appears to me, therefore, that we ought
to look for some formula which will enable us
to get out of these difficulties, and there seem
to me to be two possible ways. One is that
suggested by the delegate of the Netherlands ;
it has the great advantage of being most nearly
in conformity with the resolution under the
terms of which the Conference is convened.
His suggestion is that production should
be controlled so that no surplus will be
available for export, except for medical and
scientific purposes. I venture to submit that
the Egyptian delegate misunderstood what had
been proposed. This is a very clear and defi-
nite proposal and involves the strictest control
of production, because it ensures that the sur-
plus available will only be used for medical
and scientific purposes if the strictest control
of production is enforced.
We must, of course, assume that every country
that adheres to this Convention will honou-
rably try to fulfil its obligations, and, in that
event, there will be a very definite control of
production, with the effect of securing the
world against the distribution of any opium
except for medical and scientific purposes.
This is one way of dealing with the problem,
and it has the great advantage at any rate,
from my point of view of having already
secured the assent of the Indian delegation.
I think the Conference would do very well to
consider whether it is not, on the whole, the
best way out of our difficulties.
The only other way of dealing with the matter
that occurs to me would be to accept what is
called the American article as it stands, inser-
ting at the end some words to carry out
the Italian suggestion of freeing individual
countries from interference with their domestic
concerns. The following text might be added
at the end :
?Further, any Contracting Party may
declare, at the time of its signature of, or
accession to, the present Convention, the
limitations subject to which it accepts this
article as regards the production and dis-
tribution of raw opium -for consumption
in its territories. If such a declaration be
made, the other Contracting Parties agree
that this article shall only apply in the case
of the Contracting Party making the decla-
ration, subject to the limitations contained
in that declaration.?
That would, of course, give to any country,
as regards its domestic affairs, the power to
make a declaration before the world as to the
extent to which it could be bound, in the event
of its being unable to bind itself by the strict
letter of the earlier part of the article.
On behalf of the British delegation, I would
be prepared to accept either of these solutions,
but I venture to think that one or other of
them, or something analogous to them and
I can think of no other alternative must
be accepted ; otherwise, we are going to do
something which would be very oppressive to
individual countries or else put them under this
very unfair alternative : either they will have
to refuse to sign the Convention altogether
or they will have to undertake something which
they cannot conscientiously do and which
ought not to be enforced on them in the pre-
sent condition of their social development.
I very earnestly commend these alternative
suggestions to the Conference. If I may make
one further suggestion, it is that, since we have
here very definite proposals, it might be pos-
sible, perhaps, for a few members of the Con-
ference to meet together to consider which of
these two solutions would be the best in view
of the very difficult circumstances in which we
are placed. If the Conference thought it
right, we might go on meanwhile with our other
business, as time is now very urgently pressing.
The President
Translation : M. El Guindy, delegate of
Egypt, will speak.
M. Ei Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : 1 would like to reply to a
statement made by the honourable British
delegate. I never intended that any country
should be authorised to interfere in the affairs
of another nation. I put forward a request
in the Sub-Committee which was composed
of the representatives of the producing coun-
tries. My proposal was not accepted. If we
draw up a Convention, this will not constitute
an interference in the domestic affairs of a
country, as the Convention will be freely accep-
ted by the States concerned.
I therefore maintain my proposal, without
in any way wishing to interfere in the internal
affairs of any country.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
All the producing countries are agreed that
they could not accept the proposal of my
friend the delegate of Egypt. If some way
out is not found, they will be obliged either to
refuse to sign the Convention at all or to accept
something which they consider to be an inter-
ference with their rights. This is the situation
which has to be met, and the Italian delegation
proposes to meet it by giving the producing
countries an opportunity of saying : ?Although
we have signed the Convention generally, we
must make certain reservations or declarations?.
M. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : If a reduction of exports is
accepted, will it be understood that this will
lead inevitably to a reduction of production ?


Viscount Cecil (British Empire)
That entirely depends on the purpose for
vvhich the exports have been used.
M. von Eckardt (Germany) :
Translation : The proposal made by the
first delegate of the Netherlands seems to me
to be an excellent one, but I think it would be
quite impossible to prevent the accumulation
of the surplus stocks to which reference has
been made. Ido not understand how the coun-
tries concerned will be able to deal with this.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Falcioni,
delegate of Italy, to speak.
M. Falcioni (Italy)':
Translation : I thank Viscount Cecil for
having disinterred the Italian proposal. Perhaps
it ought to be considered once more. The question
is an important one. I would therefore like
to ask the honourable Egyptian delegate not
to press his proposal, and, as Viscount Cecil has
asked us to explore the possibilities of an agree-
ment, I think it would be a good thing for
some of us to meet in another room and try
to come to some conclusion.
The President
Translation : I gather that the Italian pro-
posal has been revived. No formal motion
has been put forward by the Netherlands dele-
gate or by Viscount Cecil.
I therefore propose that the Italian proposal
should be regarded as revived and referred to
a small Sub-Committee as a basis for the solu-
tion of the difficulty in which we are placed.
If you agree, we could leave this question to the
small Sub-Committee and resume the discussion
of this article at five o?clock.
I have received the following proposal from
one of the delegations regarding the composition
of this Sub-Committee :
The first delegates of Italy, the Netherlands,
France, India, Egypt and the British Empire.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
There is one suggestion that I would like
to make. I suppose that such a Sub-Committee
would also consider the suggestion made by
the first delegate of the Netherlands, because
that is one of two alternative propositions.
The President
Translation : That was also my view, as
the Sub-Committee will have to discuss, on
the basis of the Italian proposal, the remarks
made during the present discussion.
If you agree, I will ask these six delegates to
meet as soon as possible.
M. Dinichert, delegate of Switzerland, 'will
address the Conference.
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : I should like to make an obser-
vation regarding the composition of this Sub-
Committee. As has already been said, the
question under discussion appears to be very
complicated, and this must be the Conference?s
excuse for not having come to a conclusion.
But I think it appears more complex than it
really is, for we are nearly agreed upon a solu-
tion which consists in limiting the exportation
of raw material to medical and scientific uses.
To express this, a formula must be found.
But, gentlemen and this, in fact, is the one
thing I want to say how can we insert a
formula of this kind in the Convention which
is being prepared if we are not certain that the
principal producing countries will accept it ?
The engagement entailed by these articles must
be accepted and carried out by the producing
countries, otherwise it will remain a dead letter.
For this reason, I could not give my adhesion
to a formula which was not accepted by the
representatives of all the producing countries.
I therefore suggest that the President
with the consent of the Conference, of course
should take this point into consideration and
see to it that the representatives of the countries
most concerned are associated with the work
of this Sub-Committee.
The President
Translation : I had prepared a list of names
for the Sub-Committee but I had received
another list from one of the delegations, and
this is the one which I put before the Confe-
rence. My own list also included M. Yova-
novitch, delegate of the Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes. It seems to me quite
natural that the producing States should be
represented on the Sub-Committee.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : Among the producing States
chiefly concerned are Persia and Turkey,
and I think H.H. Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh ought
to be on the Sub-Committee, as I know that
he will accept the whole Convention provided
he is given satisfaction in regard to his memo-
randum.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia)
Translation : lam afraid I cannot serve on
the Sub-Committee as I am called away on
urgent business to Berne and will be absent for
a day or two.
The President
Translation : Could not the producing coun-
tries specially concerned agree to be represen-
ted by the delegate of the Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes ?
IV!. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translatoin : I propose that the Turkish
delegate should take my place on the Sub-
Committee.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
I think both had better come.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia)
Translation : I accept M. Yovanovitch?s
proposal.
IVI. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : If the Sub-Committee met
to-day, H.H. Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh could take
part in its discussions and the difficulty would
be solved.
The President
Translation : I propose that the Sub-Com-
mittee should meet as soon as possible ; in
fact, it can do so immediately, and the first


paragraph,
which says : ??...than is
Convention?. For greater
provided
for in the
clearness,
I think we
ought to say : ?...than is
provided
delegates of Turkey and Persia can represent
the countries directly concerned.
The proposal was adopted.
The President
Translation : The discussion of this question
is postponed until 5.30 p.m. I will therefore
ask the Sub-Committee to meet at once.
90. FIRST READING OF THE DRAFT CON-
VENTION : EXAMINATION OF THE
PREAMBLE AND ARTICLE 1.
The President
Translation : The third item on our agenda
is the first reading of the draft Convention,
with the exception of Chapter IV, Article 11.
I would remind you that this is a first rea-
ding, but it is none the less of importance,
because all amendments to the text ought to
be submitted now. It would be very helpful
to me if you would submit in writing all amend-
ments both as regards the subject-matter and
the wording.
M. Sugimura, delegate of Japan, will address
the Conference.
M. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation : On rereading the text, I
find that several small drafting amendments
might be made. I will not bring all these
points up now, but I reserve the right to submit
them to the Drafting Committee.
The President
Translation : If they are only questions
of drafting, they need not be raised here. The
Drafting Committee, to which I belong, will
duly take note of M. Sugimura?s observations.
Preamble.
The text of the Preamble was read as follows :
?Taking note of the fact that the appli-
cation of the provisions of the Hague Con-
vention by the signatory States has produced
results of great value, but that the
contraband trade in and abuse of the
substances to which the Convention applies
still continue on a great scale ;
?Convinced that the contraband trade
in and abuse of the substances to which
the Convention applies cannot be effectually
suppressed except by bringing about a more
effective limitation of the production or
manufacture of the substances, and by
exercising a closer control and supervision
of the international trade, than is provided
for in the Convention ;
?Desirous therefore of taking further
measures to carry out the objects aimed
at by the Convention and to complete and
strengthen its provisions ;
?Realising that such limitation and
control require the close co-operation of
all the signatory States ;
?Considering that this humanitarian effort
will meet with the unanimous adhesion of
the nations concerned :
?Have decided to conclude a Convention
for this purpose.
?The High Contracting Parties have
accordingly appointed as their plenipoten-
tiaries :
[ Here follow the names of heads of
States and their plenipotentiaries. J
who, after communicating their full powers,
found in good and due form, have agreed as
follows : ?
The President
Translation : The names of the plenipoten-
tiaries will not be inserted in the Preamble
until all the signatures have been affixed.
The document which you will be invited to
sign will bear no names. The discussion on
the Preamble is open.
I call upon M. Chodzko, delegate of Poland,
to address the Conference.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I venture to draw the Confe-
rence?s attention to the last line of the second
for in the Hague Convention?, as I presume the
text refers to the Hague Convention.
The President
Translation : Ido not think there has been
any reference to any other Convention. I
quite agree with the proposal.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : At the beginning of the second
paragraph we also have the words : ?...sub-
stances to which the Convention applies...?.
Does this mean the new Convention or the
Hague Convention ? It would be as well to
specify which is meant.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
May I suggest that the proposal of the dele-
gate for Poland be referred at once to the Draf-
ting Committee to consider ?
M. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : There are quite a number of
small points of drafting in the Preamble which
require revision. I will send a copy of the
document to the Drafting Committee containing
the modifications in question.
The President
Translation : In the name of the Drafting
Committee, I beg to thank the Swiss delegate
for his proposal.
The Preamble was adopted at the first reading (
Article 1.
The following definitions were read
?The Contracting Parties agree to adopt
the following definitions for the purposes
of the present Convention ;
?Raw Opium. ?Raw opium? means
the spontaneously coagulated juice ob-
tained from the capsules of the Papaver
somniferum, which has only been submitted
to the necessary manipulations for packing
and transport, whatever its content of
morphine.
?Prepared Opium. ?Prepared opium,
means the product of raw opium obtained
by a series of special operations, especially


by dissolving, boiling, roasting, and fermen-
tation, designed to transform it into an
extract suitable for consumption. Pre-
pared opium includes dross and all other
residues remaining when opium has been
smoked.
?Medicinal Opium. ?Medicinal opium?
means raw opium which has been desiccated
at 6o� centigrade and contains not less
than 10 per cent of morphine, whether or
not it be powdered or granulated or mixed
with indifferent materials.?
The President
Translation : M. Perrot, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
M. Perrot (France) :
Translation : In the text which has just
been read I should like to suggest a slight
addition to the definition of raw opium. The
letter ?L?, which stands for the name of the
great botanist Linne, should be added.
As regards medicinal opium, Sub-Committee
F was convened by its Chairman to consider a
fresh drafting proposal put forward by the
Netherlands delegation. This text was slightly
amended in the course of the discussion. As
it will not be distributed to the Drafting Com-
mittee until to-morrow, I should like to ask
the Conference not to discuss for the moment
the paragraph concerning medicinal opium.
The Sub-Committee thought it advisable to
draw up a text regarding medicinal opium which
would be clearer and more precise and would
apply to all known pharmacopoeias.
The President
Translation : From what M. Perrot has just
said, I gather that it will not be necessary to
return to this paragraph, as the Chairman of
Sub-Committee F will send the new text direct
to the Drafting Committee, which will itself
consider the revised version.
M. de Palacios, delegate of Spain, will address
the Conference.
M. de Palacios (Spain) ;
Translation : Mr. President : According to
Article 31 of the draft Convention before us :
"The present Convention replaces, as
between the Contracting Parties, the pro-
visions of Chapters I, 111 and V of the Con-
vention signed at The Hague on January
23rd, 1912 ?
This means that Chapter II of the Hague
Convention remains as it is. Chapter 11, how-
ever, begins with a definition of prepared opium,
and the Spanish delegation therefore wishes
to point out that the definition of prepared opium
in Article 1 of the new Convention is super-
fluous. It may be argued that the intention
was to collect all the definitions in one article,
but it seems to me that it would be better to
omit the definition of prepared opium.
If the Conference does not share the Spanish
delegation?s views, I shall have to make a short
statement, but I hope that my opinion will
be accepted.
The President
Translation : Mr. Malkin, Legal Adviser to
the British delegation, will address the Con-
ference.
Mr. Malkin (Legal Adviser to the British
delegation)
I might explain that the definition of pre-
pared opium taken from the Hague Convention
has been inserted in this list of definitions
because the phrase "prepared opium? occurs
in this Convention in several places, and it
is inconvenient to have to look to the Hague
Convention in order to find the definition of
a phrase which is employed in the present one. I
would therefore suggest that it is convenient
to retain the definition where it is at present.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I presume that Mr. Malkin
has spoken on behalf of the competent Com-
mittee. In that case, I think the Conference will
agree with him and will retain the proposed
text.
I must therefore make the following decla-
ration. The definition which we have before
us is the same as that contained in the Hague
Convention of 1912. This Convention was
drawn up without the participation of most of
the States which are now its signatories. Spain,
for example, did not take part in the prepara-
tion of the Hague Convention. When she was
invited to adhere thereto, she accepted it as
a whole without discussing any points of detail.
If my information is correct, Sub-Committee F
did not deal with this definition of prepared
opium that is to say, the representative of
the Spanish Government has not yet had an
opportunity of giving its opinion on the defi-
nition in question.
The first paragraph is drafted as follows :
?...the product of raw opium obtained by
a series of special operations, especially
by dissolving, boiling, roasting and fer-
mentation, designed to transform it into
an extract suitable for consumption.?
So far we are in agreement, but then it goes
on to say ;
"Prepared opium includes dross and all
other residues remaining when opium has
been smoked.?
We consider that dross and the other resi-
dues should not be included in the definition of
prepared opium or treated in the same way as
prepared opium. Prepared opium is already
subject to special regulations, but the dross
contains a much greater quantity of morphine
and is much more injurious than prepared
opium, and we do not think that the same privi-
leged treatment should be applied to prepared
opium including dross and the residues of
smoked opium as to prepared opium proper.
We consider that dross and the residues of smoked
opium ought to come under the general
regulations. Its use should never be authorised
except in so far as the morphine contained there-
in can be utilised for medical and scientific
purposes.
I do not intend to open a discussion on this
subject now ; but as this is the first opportunity
we have had of expressing our opinion, we have
felt it to be our duty to do so.


Translation : Does the Chairman or Rap-
porteur of Sub-Committee F wish to make any
remarks ?
I call upon M. Perrot, delegate of France, to
address the Conference.
M. Perrot (France) :
Translation : This question was certainly
not brought before Sub-Committee F, and there
has evidently been an error in drafting which
involves an error from the scientific point
of view. Dross and the other residues of
smoked opium can clearly not be regarded as
coming under the definition of prepared opium.
It would perhaps be possible by means of a
new text to include these substances in a
separate definition and thereby meet the wishes
of the Spanish delegate. If the latter has no
objection, I think this question might be left
to the Drafting Committee.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. de Myttenaere,
delegate of Belgium, to speak.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium)
Translation : I think it would meet the case
if we state that dross and the other residues
are to be treated in the same manner as pre-
pared opium.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I thank the Chairman and
Rapporteur of Sub-Committee F for their
courteous replies, but unfortunately neither of
them is in agreement with what I said. It is
true that they proposed to make a correction,
while still linking up dross with the prepared
opium. The Spanish delegation cannot accept
this. That is why I did not intend to open
a discussion but simply to state our view, which
is diametrically opposed to that expressed in
the second paragraph of the definition before us.
The President
Translation : M. Sugimura, delegate of
Japan, will address the Conference.
M. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation : I do not wish to raise the
delicate question of competence at this moment,
nor do I wish to raise a number of other impor-
tant questions, as we have not yet come to the
discussion of Article 31. I think, however,
that the best solution would be to omit the
definition of prepared opium. In this way,
several delicate questions would be circum-
vented. I think that many of my colleagues
will agree with my proposal.
The President
Translation : I call upon Sir Malcolm
Delevingne, delegate of the British Empire,
to address the Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I think, Mr. President, that there is perhaps
a slight misunderstanding. Dross is included
in the definition of prepared opium in the
Hague Convention and therefore comes under
the provision in Article 6 of that Convention,
which requires the Contracting Powers to sup-
press its use" entirely. Therefore, it would be
impossible to put dross in the same category
as the drugs which are mentioned in Chapter 111,
because that would imply that the use of dross
would be permitted for medical and scientific
purposes. This would be inconsistent with the
provisions of Chapter II of the Hague Con-
vention, which requires the use of dross to be
entirely suppressed.
I might also point out that, in the Agreement
or Convention which has been concluded by the
First Conference, a provision has been inserted
to the effect that the purchase and sale of
dross are to be prohibited. It would be a mistake,
I think, therefore and no doubt the Spanish
delegate and the other delegations will agree
with me to include dross as one of the drugs
in Chapter 111 of the Hague Convention.
Might I also point out that, as has been said,
we cannot do without a definition of prepared
opium in this Convention, because it is referred
to in Article 2 or will be referred to in the
revised Article 2, now under consideration
and in Article 22, which requires statistics to
be sent to the Central Board. Neither of those
articles, however, will have any effect whatever
on the use of dross, and the reference to dross
is only maintained in the definition in this new
Convention in order to make it exactly the
same as the definition in the Hague Convention.
Accordingly, the point to which the Spanish
delegate has called attention will not make any
difference one way or the other as regards the
manner in which dross is to be treated, and I
think that, if it is realised that the use of
dross is to be entirely suppressed, satisfaction
will be given to the wishes expressed by the
Spanish delegate and it will therefore be unne-
cessary, I suggest, to make this alteration in the
draft Convention now before the Conference.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Perrot, dele-
gate of France, to speak.
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : The Chairman of Sub-Com-
mittee F and I would like to point out that there
is no need to include dross among the residues of
opium. The text under discussion serves no
good purpose where it is at present and can
perfectly well be omitted.
The President
Translation : As the Rapporteur of Sub-
Committee F himself proposes to delete the
words concerning dross and other residues of
opium, I propose that, if no other delegate
wishes to speak on the question, we should
agree to omit this sentence. We can revert
to this point at the convenient moment later.
M. Sugimura has put forward a more far-
reaching proposal. Does M. Perrot?s suggestion
satisfy him ?
M. Sugimura (Japan) ;
Translation : No, I am not satisfied with it.
Nevertheless, I have not the courage to dis-
cuss the question of competence. I simply
desire to point out that the First Conference
did not draw up any definition and was con-
tent with the term ?prepared opium?. In
so doing, it followed the precedent of the Hague
Convention. If we accept the phrase ?prepared
The President


opium?, there is no need to go into the
question any further. I am not sure that, under
the terms of the sixth resolution of the Assembly,
we are competent to discuss the definition of
prepared opium from the technical point of view.
I therefore think it would be wiser to omit the
whole of this definition.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I should like to thank the
Japanese delegate for what he has said. I also
asked that the Conference should omit the
whole definition. If, on the other hand, it
prefers the suggestion of M. Perrot that is to
say, to retain the first part of the definition
and omit the second I shall also be satisfied.
The President
Translation : We have three proposals to
consider : that contained in the draft Con-
vention ; that of M. Sugimura, who wishes the
whole definition of prepared opium to be dele-
ted ; and that of M. Perrot, who only wants
to delete the second sentence.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne, delegate of the
British Empire, will address the Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
It seems to me that, from the drafting point
of view, it would be rather a pity to have one
definition in the Hague Convention and another
definition in this Convention.
In the faint hope of meeting everybody?s
views, I venture to put forward a suggestion
which is made by our legal adviser that we
might omit the definition of prepared opium
altogether here and that in the two clauses
I think there are only two clauses in which the
phrase : ?prepared opium? is used ?we should
say : ?prepared opium as defined in the Hague
Convention?. In both those clauses the refe-
rence is to the use of prepared opium as defined
in the Hague Convention in accordance with the
provisions of the Hague Convention; there-
fore, if we omit the definition here and in those
two clauses say, instead of the simple words
?prepared opium?, ?prepared opium as defined
in the Hague Convention?, we shall perhaps
meet everybody?s view.
The President
Translation : Does M. de Palacios wish to
express an opinion on this suggestion ?
M. de Palacios (Spain) ;
Translation : I much prefer both M. Sugi-
mura?s proposal and M. Perrot?s.
M. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : I think the point is not yet
settled, for when we speak of prepared opium
it is understood that dross is not included.
The President
Translation : Mr. Malkin, Legal Adviser
to the British delegation, will address the Con-
ference.
Mr. Malkin (Legal Adviser to the British
delegation)
May I venture to point out a difficulty which
I think stands in the way of the adoption of
M. Sugimura?s suggestion. Article 23 of the
draft Convention says that, "in order to complete
the information of the Board as to the disposal of
theworld?s supply of raw opium, the Governments
of the countries where the use of prepared
opium is temporarily authorised shall supply
certain statistics?. Those statistics include :
(1) the manufacture of prepared opium and (2)
the consumption of prepared opium.
In all cases, what is meant by ?prepared
opium? is prepared opium as defined in Chapter
II of the Hague Convention. It is that pre-
pared opium of which the use is authorised,
and it is that prepared opium of which, under
this article, certain statistics are to be supplied.
If, therefore, the last two lines of the defini-
tion are omitted, Article 23 will be rendered
most inaccurate, because you will not be asking
for the statistics which you really want to get
namely: the statistics of prepared opium as
defined in the Hague Convention but you will
merely be asking for statistics of a certain por-
tion of prepared opium; that, I am sure,
is not the intention of the Sub-Committee
which drafted Article 23 of the draft Con-
vention.
IV!. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : I should like to ask Mr. Malkin
whether, in his opinion, this Conference is
amending the definition in the Hague Conven-
tion ? In the view of the British delegation,
would it be the new definition which should
be applied with the second paragraph omitted ?
Mr. Malkin (Legal Adviser to the British
Delegation) :
The definition in the draft Convention before
us is exactly the same as the definition in the
Hague Convention. It is M. Sugimura who
is proposing to alter it.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Perrot, dele-
gate of France, to address the Conference.
M. Perrot (France) ;
Translation : I think the Sub-Com-
mittee did not discuss the definition of pre-
pared opium because it assumed that the exact
definition in the Hague Convention would be
retained. The text before us' is that of the
Hague Convention. But the technical experts
have stated, as M. de Palacios pointed out, that
the last sentence is not technically correct;
in defining prepared opium we cannot say that
it contains dross, as the latter is a residue.
Technically this is incorrect, but there can be
no question of modifying its text. The defi-
nition of the Hague Convention must stand.
M. Fabris (Italy) :
Translation : I propose that we vote on
M. Perrot?s suggestion.
The President
Translation : M. Sugimura has proposed
to delete this definition. I think we must
vote on this proposal first.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
1 entirely support what has been said by Sir
Malcolm Delevingne in regard to leaving out
the definition of prepared opium here and
inserting in each of the articles where we


refer to prepared opium the words "as defined
by the Hague Convention".
IVI. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : I maintain my proposal to
delete this definition, but I wish to reserve the
right to discuss the article later on.
IVI. Betances (Dominican Republic)
Translation : I cannot accept the proposal
made by the Netherlands delegate, because
the definition given in the Hague Convention
is quite incorrect. We cannot say that dross is
prepared opium.
The President
Translation : We now have four proposals
before us.
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands)
May I ask, for my own information, whether
the country represented by the honourable
gentleman who has just spoken has accepted
the Hague Convention ? I ask only for my
own information.
IVI. Betances (Dominican Republic)
Translation : The Dominican Republic has
accepted the Hague Convention, but does not
on that account feel obliged to go on accepting
what is an error.
The President
Translation : Would the Conference like to
refer this question back to Sub-Committee F ?
SVI. Carriere (Switzerland)
Translation : Ido not think Sub-Committee
F can give you any other definition than this
one, which is that of the Hague Convention.
Sub-Committee F can add nothing to it.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : When I first spoke, I said
I did not wish to raise a discussion, as I had
no desire to delay the work of the Conference.
We have now heard the opinions of a number
of delegates. I ask that the discussion be closed.
In the first place, we have M. Sugimura?s
proposal, on which we ought to vote first, as
it involves the greatest change. Then we
have M. Perrot?s proposal to delete the second
paragraph only. If M. Sugimura?s proposal
is accepted, we shall then have to decide on
Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s proposal to insert
the words "as defined in the Hague Convention
of 1912?? in the other articles where they refer
to prepared opium.
The President
Translation : There is now a motion to
close the discussion. In accordance with the
rules of procedure, I must ask the Confe-
rence?s opinion on this motion.
IVI. de SVlyttenaere (Belgium) ;
Translation : I think I have understood
correctly the members of the First Conference ;
they have stated that the question of prepared
opium is not within the competence of this
Conference. It seems to me, therefore, that
the discussion must be closed because we are
not competent.
The President
Translation : I think I can regard the mo-
tion of closure as adopted.
The question of competence has been touched
upon by the Belgian delegate. I doubt whether
it is really necessary to discuss this question.
It is now 5.30 p.m., the hour at which I
had arranged to adjourn the discussion. I
will therefore adjourn it and request the Con-
ference to meet again in a quarter of an hour
to continue the discussion of Article 1 of the
United States suggestions.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : I do not understand why we
are closing a discussion which should have ended
with a vote on a number of proposals. In my
opinion, we ought to vote.
The President
Translation : Yes, but the question of com-
petence has just been raised. We are entitled
to insert a definition pure and simple without
discussion, but a debate has now arisen on
a subject which, in the opinion of several dele-
gates, is not within the competence of the Con-
ference. There has never been any question
of competence as regards a definition. I was
not prepared for such a contingency.
I think we can vote on M. Sugimura?s motion.
IVI. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation : I also begin to have misgivings.
I accept the Belgian proposal, for it seems to me
that we are not competent to discuss this ques-
tion. I will not even ask to have my proposal
discussed ; I withdraw it.
The President
Translation : The Japanese proposal is
withdrawn.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : In that case, the Spanish
delegation wishes formally to take up the Japa-
nese delegation's proposal. I consider that,
if a vote is taken on this proposal, the delega-
tions will have an opportunity of expressing
their opinion on the Conference?s competence
to insert a definition. The delegations which
do not consider that they are competent will
vote in favour of the former Japanese proposal,
which has now become the Spanish proposal.
IVI. Perrot (France)
Translation : If the Convention we are
discussing is to be substituted for the Hague
Convention, this is how the question will
stand. If it is not substituted for the Hague
Convention, but simply constitutes an addi-
tion thereto, we can vote for the total deletion
of this definition without troubling about the
question of competence. On this ground, I
support M. Sugimura?s proposal. We shall
simply vote without defining prepared opium,
which has previously been defined in the Hague
Convention.
The President
Translation : The proposal moved by the
Spanish delegation and seconded by the French
delegation will now be voted upon.
IVI. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : I should like to thank the
Spanish and French delegations for having
saved the present difficult situation as far as
I am concerned. It was on that understanding
that I accepted the Belgian suggestion, which,


in my opinion, is a very good one. If I vote
in favour of the new Spanish and French pro-
posal, it will be because I consider that we are
not competent to discuss this question.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
I am prepared to accept the suggestion that
we omit the definition, but I think it will be
necessary for us, either in the full Conference
or in the Drafting Committee, when we come
to the sentence in which the phrase ?prepared
opium? is used, to decide whether it will be
necessary to explain what we mean by the
phrase. But that can be left till we come to
the articles.
The President
Translation : The motion proposed by the
Spanish delegation to delete the definition of
prepared opium is now put to the vote. The
delegations in favour of this proposal are re-
quested to rise in their places.
Twelve delegations rose in their places.
The delegations which are against the Spa-
nish proposal are requested to rise.
Two delegations rose in their places, viz.,
Poland and Italy.
The Spanish proposal is adopted.
A dopted.
The President
Translation : If no one else wishes to speak,
I shall regard as adopted the text of Article 1,
in so far as the definitions of opium are concer-
ned.
Article 1, in so jar as the definitions of opium
were concerned, was adopted at the first reading.
9i. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
SUB COMMITTEE B : ARTICLE 1 OF
THE UNITED STATES SUGGESTIONS :
CONTINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION :
REPORT OF THE SUB COMMITTEE.
The President
Translation : I should like to ask the mem-
bers of the Sub-Committee if they have found
a solution. Who is the Chairman or Rappor-
teur of the Sub-Committee ?
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : Our Chairman is M. Daladier,
delegate of France.
The President
Translation : It would perhaps be well for
the members of the Conference to consider the
result of the Sub-Committee?s deliberations.
We can either adjourn the meeting for a quarter
of an hour or, if you prefer it, we can proceed
immediately to a discussion.
M. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : I propose that the meeting
be adjourned for fifteen minutes to enable
us to examine the document which has been
distributed to us.
The President
Translation : The meeting is adjourned
for fifteen minutes to enable the members of
the Conference to examine the Sub-Committee?s
proposal.
{The meeting was adjourned at 5.45 p.m. and
resumed at 6 p.m.)
Translation : I call upon the Rapporteur
of the Sub-Committee, M. Daladier, the first
delegate of France, to address the Conference.
M. Dalad ier (France), Rapporteur :
Translation : After discussion, the Sub-
Committee which you appointed adopted the
following proposal by six votes to two : It
suggested that the Conference should adopt
Article i of the United States suggestions,
which reads as follows :
?The Contracting Parties shall enact
effective laws or regulations for the control
of the production and distribution of raw
opium so that there will be no surplus
available for purposes not strictly medical
or scientific.
?The foregoing provision shall not ope-
rate to prevent the production for expor-
tation, or exportation, of raw opium for
the purpose of making prepared opium,
into those territories where the use of pre-
pared opium is still temporarily permitted
under Chapter II of the Hague Convention
of 1912, so long as such exportation is
in conformity with the provisions of this
Convention.?
This is the text of the United States sugges-
tions with two modifications : the reference to
coca leaves is deleted, and, instead of ?the
present Convention? in the last line but two,
?the Hague Convention of 1912? is mentioned.
So far, the members of the Sub-Committee were
unanimous. It was at this point that the diffi-
culty arose : it was proposed that a further
clause should be added which would enable
those States which think fit to submit reser-
vations. This text is as follows :
?Further, any Contracting Party may
declare, at the time of its signature of, or
accession to, the present Convention, the
limitations subject to which it accepts this
article as regards the production and dis-
tribution of raw opium. If such a decla-
ration be made, the other Contracting
Parties agree that this article shall only
apply in the case of the Contracting Party
making the declaration, subject to the
limitations contained in that declaration.?
I am fully aware that this proposed addition
provides a ready mark for the irony and wit
of some of our colleagues, and I shall, no doubt,
be the first to appreciate the shafts directed
against this rather hasty work of the Sub-
Committee. I feel compelled, however, to
point out that we find ourselves in one of
those extremely difficult positions in which it
is quite impossible for an international confe-
rence to arrive at any result unless it adopts
some of these small alterations which are in-
spired by human weakness, but which repre-
sent the least doubtful means of getting out
of a very delicate situation.
If this position is not admitted by the Con-
ference, what will be the result ? Most of
the producing countries will not, in fact, give
their adhesion even to the first part of the
article that is, the American proposal as
slightly amended and the Conference will
simpty have to record a negative result, if not
total failure. This is the problem as it stands.
The Swiss delegate has stated it with admirable


lucidity. What you have to consider is whether co-operate with the Persian Government and
you can possibly do better. Without this
addition, it is quite clear that the producing
countries will not even accept the clauses which
precede it.
I freely admit for it is nothing but the
truth that the right conceded to these coun-
tries to make reservations is, in spite of every-
thing, a modification of the fundamental pro-
posal concerning the restriction of production.
It is one of the cases in which international
conferences have to make their choice. My
personal opinion which I might perhaps
modify if any real, cogent and tangible argu-
ment were advanced is that this solution,
which is obviously not an ideal one but is
none the less a solution, is preferable to the
blank wall before which we shall find ourselves
if we do not agree to some such clause.
When I consider the position of certain
European producing countries I say Euro-
pean producing countries because I am well
acquainted with their position I feel I have
no right to bring to bear on them such pressure
as would lead them to sign undertakings which
they themselves know they cannot conscientiously
assume and which the conditions in their
country would make it impossible for them to
fulfil.
In view of these facts, and although we are
well aware that our proposals are far from satis-
factory, the majority of the Sub-Committee
asks you all to make the necessary concessions
and to accept the necessary limitations in the
proper spirit, in order that the Conference may
emerge triumphant from the present difficulty
and that the prestige of the League may not
suffer.
This was the thought uppermost in the minds
of the majority of the Sub-Committee, which
authorised me to submit for your approval
the American text as amended. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : I call upon Prince Arfa-ed-
Dowleh, delegate of Persia, to address the
Conference.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia)
Translation : I desire to repeat the state-
ment I made in the Sub-Committee. My
Government?s instructions are in one way very
elastic but in another very restricted ; they
are to adhere to the decision of the Conference
and to support the United States delegation ?no
Government could give more elastic instructions.
On the other hand, I have been told not to
accept even the simplest proposal without
making reservations and stating that we accept
only on condition that the requirements of the
Persian memorandum are satisfied.
The Conference is nearing its conclusion
and has as yet done nothing with regard to
this memorandum. I can only agree to the
Sub-Committee?s proposal if the Conference
adds to the Convention an official recommen-
dation that the Council shall take note of our
memorandum and on condition that our work
follows the lines of the United States proposal.
The United States delegation agreed with
me that the statements in the Persian memo-
randum were quite true, and asked me to approach
my Government with a view to a Commission
of Enquiry, consisting of agricultural experts,
being sent to Persia. This Commission would
would probably have no difficulty in coming to
an agreement with it ; the Council of the
League could then declare that it was expedient
to accept Persia?s views.
I agreed to this suggestion, telegraphed to
Teheran and received a favourable reply.
Now, however, the United States delegation
has gone and my telegram will serve no pur-
pose unless the Conference passes a recommen-
dation that the Council shall deal with the
Persian memorandum and send a Commission
of Enquiry to Teheran under the auspices of
the League, subsequent action being deter-
mined by the conclusions of the Commission.
If this is not agreed to, we shall accomplish
nothing, and I shall be obliged to retire from
the Conference.
The President
Translation : Am Ito regard this as a for-
mal proposal by the Persian delegation ?
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia) :
Translation : Yes, Mr. President.
The President
Translation : I should be grateful if you
would communicate your proposal in writing.
No one else wishes to speak ? We have before
us the United States proposal, with certain
modifications, and also an amendment to that
proposal.
According to the rules of procedure, we should
first vote on the amendment. We will there-
fore take a vote by roll-call.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : I should prefer to take the
United States proposal first and the amendment
afterwards.
The President
Translation : The ordinary procedure, when
there is an amendment, is to vote on it first.
That is the rule we have followed throughout
the Conference. We will therefore take a
vote by roll-call. Those in favour of the amend-
ment will vote ?Yes? ; those against, ?No?.
The following delegations have voted in
favour of the amendment :
Australia, British Empire, Canada, Denmark,
France, Germany, India, Italy, Netherlands,
Portugal, Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes, Siam, Switzerland.
The following delegation has voted against
the amendment :
Irish Free State
The following delegations have abstained
from voting ;
Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, Czechoslovakia, Do-
minican Republic, Egypt, Finland, Japan,
Luxemburg, Persia, Poland, Spain, Sweden,
Turkey.
M. Sugimura, delegate of Japan, will address
the Conference.

Convention, but the text before us is so 92. APPOINTMENT OF A COMMISSION TO
complicated that I do not know whether it
represents an advance or a retrocession. I have
therefore abstained from voting.
The President
Translation : M. Sugimura?s statement will
be included in the record of the meeting.
I believe the first delegate of the Irish
Free State also wishes to make a statement
concerning his vote.
Mr. Mac White (Irish Free State) :
Translation : I think that the addendum
submitted has the effect of weakening the
Hague Convention, and I cannot accept it.
The President
Translation : The Sub-Committee?s amend-
ment has been adopted, 13 delegations voting
in favour, one against and 14 abstaining.
The amendment was adopted.
The President
Translation : According to the rules of pro-
cedure, we should now vote on the proposal
as amended that is to say, the United States
proposal, together with the Sub-Committee?s
amendment.
The article reads as follows
?The contracting Parties shall enact effec-
tive laws or regulations for the control
of the production and distribution of raw
opium so that there will be no surplus
available for purposes not strictly medical
or scientific.
?The foregoing provision shall not ope-
rate to prevent the production for expor-
tation, or exportation, of raw opium for
the purpose of making prepared opium,
into those territories where the use of pre-
pared opium is still temporarily permitted
under Chapter II of the Hague Convention
of 1912, so long as such exportation is in
conformity with the provisions of this
Convention.?
We will take a vote by roll-call.
The following delegations have voted in
favour of the article as amended :
Australia, Belgium, Bolivia, Brazil, British
Empire, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France,
Germany, India, Italy, Luxemburg, Nether-
lands, Portugal, Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats
and Slovenes, Siam, Switzerland, Turkey.
The following delegations abstained from
voting :
Czechoslovakia, Dominican Republic, Egypt,
Irish Free State, Japan, Persia, Poland, Spain,
Sweden.
The United States proposal, as amended, has
been adopted by the Conference, 19 delegations
voting in favour, none against, and 9 abstaining.
The article as amended was adopted.
The President
Translation : This article must be referred
to the Drafting Committee for the slight modi-
fications required in the text. It will come
before the Conference again on the second
reading of the draft Convention. {Assent.)
STUDY THE DIFFICULTIES CONNECT-
ED WITH THE LIMITATION OF THE
PRODUCTION OF OPIUM IN CERTAIN
PRODUCING COUNTRIES : EXAMINA-
TION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS
MADE BY SUB-COMMITTEE B.
The President
Translation : We have not yet settled all
the questions connected with the examination
of Sub-Committee B?s report, as the latter
contains recommendations relating to the Com-
mission of Enquiry in the Far East and in
Persia which are not quite clear. In order
to remove all doubt as to the scope of Sub-
Committee B?s recommendations, I will ask
Mr. Shepherd, the Rapporteur, to be good
enough to give the Conference further infor-
mation on the question.
Mr. Shepherd (Australia) Rapporteur :
When Article 1 of the United States sugges-
tions was first discussed by Sub-Committee
B, the voting showed that none of the producing
countries could accept the proposal uncondi-
tionally or without further investigation. The
United States delegation then submitted a
motion regarding this Commission of Enquiry.
Much discussion took place on this proposal and
it was finally accepted in its present form by the
Sub-Committee on the condition that it was
amended to provide for the appointment of a
Commission under the auspices of the League
of Nations.
The United States delegate, however, reser-
ved this point for further consideration, but
at the later meetings of the Sub-Committee,
when he was asked for an explanation of this
point, he stated that the matter had been dealt
with in the report of the Sub-Committee and
referred to the Conference, and that the question
was no longer one for the Sub-Committee but
for the Conference to deal with. It is rather
difficult, therefore, to say what the final atti-
tude of the United States delegation was.
The Sub-Committee certainly passed the
resolution but apparently the United States
delegation was not satisfied and proposed to
bring it up again at the full Conference. I
am inclined to think that they took that atti-
tude of waiting to see what the final decision
of the full Conference was on Article 1.
That first resolution has therefore been passed
by Sub-Committee B, and it is a matter for the
full Conference now to decide whether it will
adopt it or delete it in view of the subsequent
action which has been taken with regard to
Article 1 of the United States proposal, which
I am inclined to think would satisfy the United
States delegation.
With regard to the second resolution which
deals with the question of the appointment of
a Committee of Investigation to consider the
Persian situation, the report of the Sub-Com-
mittee will show that this resolution was adopted
but that, at subsequent meetings, the Persian
delegation made a reservation which more or
less nullifies the decision of the Sub-Committee.
The Persian delegation takes exception to some
of the additions to the resolution. Personally
I am not prepared to accept it without those
additions, and it again becomes a matter for
the full Conference to say whether it will
accept it or not.


A further point is that the subsequent deli-
berations of the Conference seemed to indicaet
that a Commission of Enquiry will be set up
in any event, and I am inclined to think
that there is not any necessity to have three
Commissions of Enquiry. The report of Sub-
Committee B suggests two Commissions of
Enquiry, and the Protocol, which we have been
dealing with to-day, I think, more or less
indicates a further Commission of Enquiry.
I very much doubt whether I should definitely
state the wishes of Sub-Committee B on this
matter in view of these facts ; first of all, that
the United States delegation did not indicate
what it wished to bring before the full Confe-
rence, and in the second place that the Persian
delegation makes a reservation which I do not
think will be accepted by Sub-Committee B.
The President
Translation : We now have to decide whe-
ther or not we shall accept the proposal made
by Sub-Committee B. We must first, however,
understand what that suggestion is. For that
reason I asked the Rapporteur for further infor-
mation, but I am still in doubt.
On the one hand, there is the suggestion made
by Sub-Committee B that a Commission of
Enquiry should be sent to the Far East, a
Commission which might or might not be
under the auspices of the League of Nations ;
that was the reason for the reservation to the
original proposal. The author of that proposal
is no longer here. We therefore have to deal
with a proposal accepted by Sub-Committee B
on condition that the Commission of Enquiry
is placed under the auspices of the League.
On the other hand, there is a proposal con-
cerning a Commission of Enquiry to visit Persia.
A reservation has been submitted by the Persian
delegation which, I think, makes it impossible
to agree to the appointment of such a Commis-
sion.
Such being the case, as there is no special
mention in Sub-Committee B?s report, I find
myself faced by a difficulty, since the Sub-
Committee first arrived at an agreement and
then added a reservation submitted by one of
its members which makes it unacceptable.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh, delegate of Persia,
will address the Conference.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia)
Translation : I agree that I submitted a
reservation, but in so doing I stated that Persia
accepted the United States proposal. I can
only accept what I have already agreed to
accept in the report. The United States pro-
posal is that a Commission of Enquiry should
be sent to Teheran ; I telegraphed to my
Government, which accepts the suggestion.
What I have just stated I have already sub-
mitted in writing.
The President
Translation : I call upon the Chairman of
Sub-Committee B to give us his views on the
matter.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I think that, if the Confer-
ence approves, we might perhaps accept the
first resolution proposed by Sub-Committee B.
This resolution has been approved by the pro-
ducing countries which are represented on that
Sub-Committee.
As regards the second proposal, since reser-
vations have been submitted, we might treat
it as a recommendation of the Conference ;
this would mean that we need not settle any
details concerning the Commission of Enquiry
to visit Persia.
The President
Translation : Mehmed Sureya Bey, delegate
of Turkey, will address the Conference.
Mehmed Sureya Bey (Turkey) :
Translation : As the Chairman has explained,
Sub-Committee B agreed on the question
of the Commissions of Enquiry. Mrs. Hamilton
Wright had asked that they might be sent to
producing countries, and the recommendation
might therefore be regarded as accepted by
Sub-Committee B. I fully support M. Chodzko?s
proposal.
The President
Translation : Viscount Cecil, delegate of
the British Empire, will address the Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
I should just like to understand the position
clearly. I have read this proposal, and appa-
rently it leaves to this Conference the duty of
working out all the details regarding this Com-
mission of Enquiry, how it is to be appointed
and what it is to do. We certainly are not
going to undertake such a duty at this stage
of the Conference at least I hope we are
not.
I cannot think that we can accept such a
proposal, for I do not quite see where it will land
us. The proposal accepts the principle of a Com-
mission and the principle that the Conference
is to decide what it is to do and where it is to
go. The proposal is not apparently a recom-
mendation to the Council of the League of
Nations. If it were so, I should see no diffi-
culty. But I certainly could not vote for it
as it stands, as it seems to me to be quite
incomplete.
The President
Translation : Mr. Shepherd, delegate of Aus-
tralia, will address the Conference.
Mr. Shepherd (Australia) Rapporteur
I entirely agree with what Viscount Cecil has
said, and I was about to make almost the same
remark. This resolution was only proposed
by the United States delegation after the Sub-
Committee had rejected its proposals for Article
i. I feel pretty well satisfied myself that the
action which we have just taken this afternoon in
accepting the United States proposal would
have satisfied the United States delegation. I
feel sure that the delegation would have accep-
ted the amendment to Article iat an early
stage of the proceedings and would therefore
not have asked for a Commission of Enquiry.
In view, therefore, of the action which we
have taken this afternoon, I personally am
not prepared to vote at this stage in favour of
this Commission of Enquiry. Ido not think
the Sub-Committee would have passed this
motion if we had been in the position that we
are in to-day.


Translation : Mehmed Sureya Bey, dele-
gate of Turkey, will address the Conference.
Mehmed Sureya Bey (Turkey) :
Translation : Mrs. Hamilton Wright sub-
mitted the proposal that a Commission of
Enquiry should be appointed, as we had ex-
plained the position in our country, a position
which applies to all producing countries. The pro-
posal was accepted by Sub-Committee B. The
situation, however, is altered now. We have
adopted Article i with reservations. If a
Commission of Enquiry is sent to the producing
countries, the reservations will be withdrawn.
To send such a Commission would therefore be
a means of doing away with the reservations
relating to Article i of the United States pro-
posals.
The President
Translation : Viscount Cecil, delegate of
the British Empire, will address the Conference.
Viscount Cecil (British Empire) :
May I suggest a compromise ? Let us strike
out the last two paragraphs of the first reso-
lution, which throw upon this Conference the
duty of determining the manner of appointment
of the Commission, the question of the quali-
fication of the members, the steps to be taken
to obtain the necessary funds and the manner
in which it is to make its report.
Evidently, we cannot possibly carry out
those obligations now, but if we made the third
paragraph a recommendation to the Council
of the League of Nations instead of a recom-
mendation to the Conference, we might leave
all the details to be settled by the League of
Nations if it accepted the recommendation.
The third paragraph would therefore read :
?Sub-Committee B recommends to the Council
of the League of Nations that careful conside-
ration be given to the question of the
appointment of a Commission?, and so on. It
can then be left to the Council of the League
of Nations to say whether or not it thinks that
this recommendation is practically possible.
At any rate, I do not think we can possibly go
into the matter further to-night. After what
has been said by the delegate for Turkey, I
should not feel quite happy to do nothing
at all.
!VI. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : I understand that the Con-
ference refers the proposal to the Council of
the League.
Viscount Cecil : That is so.
The President
Translation : The Conference adopts the
report as interpreted by Viscount Cecil. The
Drafting Committee will submit a text which
will, I think, be inserted in the Final Act of the
Conference. Sub-Committee B may regard its
report as accepted by the Conference and refer-
red to the Drafting Committee.
BVI. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : Before the meeting is adjour-
ned, I should like to know whether there is to be
only one reading of the Articles of the Convention
or whether there will be a second reading and
a second vote.
The President
Translation: There will be another reading
the final one and you will have an opportunity
of submitting any observations.
M. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : And of presenting our views ?
The President
Translation : I would remind you that, at
the beginning of the first reading, I asked
members to give their opinions then as far
as possible.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : Some of the members were
not present ; I myself was not there when
certain points were being discussed.
The President
Translation : We have not even concluded
our examination of the ?definitions?, so that
you still have an opportunity of speaking.
Our next meeting will be at 3 p.m. to-morrow.
The Conference rose at 7 p.m.
THIRTIETH MEETING
Held at Geneva on Thursday, February I.2th, 1925, at 10.30 a.rn.
CONTENTS :
93. Examination of the Report of Sub-
Committee B : Article i of the
Suggestions of the United States :
Statement by the Brazilian Dele-
gate REGARDING THE VOTE TAKEN AT
the Twenty-ninth Meeting.
94. First Reading of the Draft Convention ;
Article i : Statement by the Dele-
gate of the Dominican Republic re-
garding the Vote taken on the Defi-
nition of Prepared Opium.
95. Examination of the Report of Sub-
Committee F : The Question of He-
ROIN.
President : M. Herluf Zahle.
93. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
SUB-COM MITT EE B : ARTICLE 1 OF
THE SUGGESTIONS OF THE UNITED
STATES : STATEMENT BY THE
BRAZILIAN DELEGATE REGARDING
THE VOTE TAKEN AT THE TWENTY-
NINTH MEETING.
The President
Translation : One of the delegations has
requested permission, before we begin to-day?s
business, to make a statement regarding the
vote taken at our last meeting on the question
of Article 1.


We shall have to deal with this article again
to-day, but as this delegation has expressed a
desire to make its statement at the earliest
possible moment, I have acceded to its request.
I call on the first delegate of Brazil to speak.
IVI. Pernambuco (Brazil)
Translation : At the last plenary meeting,
when a separate vote was taken on the amend-
ment to Article i of the United States Sugges-
tions, Brazil stated that she would abstain.
Article i was then put to the vote, and we
voted ?yes?, believing that we were voting
on Article i with the smaller amendment con-
cerning coca leaves.
On reading the record of the meeting, we
regret to observe that the vote was taken on
Article i of the United States suggestions
with both the smaller and the larger amendments.
In these circumstances, the Brazilian delegation,
in order to be consistent, desires to state that
it abstains from voting and asks that this state-
ment shall appear in the record of to-day?s
meeting.
The President
Translation : The Brazilian delegate?s state-
ment will be included in the record of the
meeting.
94. FIRST READING OF THE DRAFT
CONVENTION : ARTICLE 1 : STATE-
MENT BY THE DELEGATE OF THE
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC REGARDING
THE VOTE TAKEN ON THE DEFINI-
TION OF PREPARED OPIUM.
The President
Translation : I call upon the delegate of
the Dominican Republic to speak.
M. Betances (Dominican Republic)
Translation : We have voted in favour of
the suppression of the definition of prepared
opium contained in the Hague Convention and in
the draft of the new Convention, not only
because this definition is quite misleading
but also because I hope indeed I am prac-
tically certain that at the proper moment the
Spanish delegate will propose a more accurate
and clearer definition of prepared opium and
dross and all other residues of opium for smoking.
The President
Translation : I thought it better not to
rule out the above statements, but we cannot
engage in a discussion. If, however, the Spa-
nish delegate, since he has been named by the
Dominican delegate, desires to make a short
statement on this point only, I invite him to
do so.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I quite agree with the Presi-
dent. I thought that the question had already
been settled, but as our colleague has expressed
a hope that the Spanish delegation will pro-
pose a definition of prepared opium, I must
inform him that it was not our intention to
do so. If, however, the Conference so desires,
we will accede to its request. Otherwise, we
will place ourselves at the disposal of the repre-
sentative of the Dominican Republic to give
him any further explanations he may desire, but
outside the Conference.
M. Betances (Dominican Republic) ;
Translation : Thank you, gentlemen.
95. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
SUB-COMMITTEE F : THE QUESTION
OF HEROIN.
The President
Translation : Members of the Conference
will remember that when we considered the
various reports of the Sub-Committees, we
held over certain points, including a point in
connection with Article i which was discussed
at our last meeting. If to-day we revert to
Article i, it is not in order to discuss the report
but to hear the first reading of the article.
The first item on our agenda concerns the
two parts held over in connection with the ques-
tion of heroin and Indian hemp. We will begin
with the question of heroin. I declare open the
discussion on this part of the report of Sub-
Committee F.
M. Carriere, delegate of Switzerland and
Chairman of Sub-Committee F, will address the
Conference.
M. Carriere (Switzerland), Chairman of Sub-
committee F ;
Translation : You have before you the
report of Sub-Committee F, dealing with the
question of heroin 1 . The resolutions contained
in this report were almost unanimously adopted
at the beginning, but the report itself should, I
think, be re-examined to-day by the members
of Sub-Committee F.
We have before us two proposals : that
contained in our report and the proposal which
will be submitted by one of the members of the
Conference. As the author of the first proposal
was M. de Myttenaere, the Belgian delegate, it
was agreed that he should submit a report on
the proposal appearing in the report of Sub-
Committee F. I would therefore request you
to be good enough, Mr. President, to call
upon the Belgian delegate to speak.
The President
Translation : I understand that another
delegation has an amendment to propose.
Would it not be better for this amendment to
be submitted first, in order that M. de Mytte-
naere may, if he so desires, comment thereon
later ?
I call upon M. Perrot, delegate of France,
to address the Conference.
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : Mr. President, gentlemen, I
thank the Chairman of Sub-Committee F for
having submitted the question in this way.
A difference of opinion does, in fact, exist
I might say one of the few differences of opi-
nion which have arisen in Sub-Committee F.
The question was dealt with in this Sub-
Committee from various points of view. First
of all the United States delegation proposed the
total and radical suppression of heroin. The
Sub-Committee felt that such total suppression
was impossible and would in any case be going
beyond the sphere of the Sub-Committee?s
and even the Conference?s ; competence.
A new proposal has been made to the effect
1 See Annex 26.


that heroin should continue to be treated as it
is treated in the Hague Convention * ? that
is to say, that the use of this substance should
still be tolerated and that it should be given
the same treatment as certain products which
are allowed to circulate and which contain,
for instance, 0.20 per cent morphine. 0.10 per
cent cocaine, and 0.10 per cent heroin.
I do not think although I am fully pre-
pared to listen to arguments to the contrary
that there are any sufficient technical or scien-
tific reasons for granting heroin a privileged
position. But, as its name indicates, it is an
heroic medicament ; and consequently, since
it is a medicament, I do not see why we should
mete out to it a treatment entirely different
from that which we have accorded to mor-
phine and cocaine. The French delegation is
therefore of opinion that there is no need to
alter the Hague Convention. Accordingly, it
has submitted an amendment, which is really
no amendment at all, because it merely pro-
poses that the present situation shall be main-
tained.
1 am fully prepared to listen to arguments on
the other side, but I do not think that any can
exist, except those of a sentimental character.
There is no reason why we should deal more
severely with heroin than with morphine and
cocaine, or why we should draw up Draconian
measures for the complete suppression of
heroin, which is a very active product of
preparations which do not give rise to toxico-
mania.
On behalf of the French delegation, I main-
tain our request that heroin should continue
to be dealt with as in the Hague Convention.
The President
Translation : I understand, M. Perrot, that
you nevertheless desire a slight change of phra-
seology in the text of the Hague Convention,
namely : that the word ?heroin? should be
replaced by ?diacetylmorphine?.
IYI. Perrot (France)
Translation : Everybody admits this change,
because the word ?heroin? is a registered trade
name belonging to a commercial firm. We
have therefore replaced it by ?diacetylmor-
phine? in every case.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. de Myttenaere,
delegate of Belgium, to address the Conference.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium) :
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gen-
tlemen, the Conference will perhaps remember
that it was at my suggestion that the United
States proposal concerning the suppression of
heroin or diacetylmorphine was referred to
Sub-Committee F. My intention was not only
to spare the Conference in plenary meeting a
long discussion of a purely scientific character
but also to make to the Sub-Committee of
experts a proposal which, while not so extreme
as that of my United States colleagues, might,
as I hoped, meet the latter?s wishes.
Article 14 of the Opium Convention of 1912
exempts from the provisions of this Convention
preparations, officinal or non-officinal, contain-
ing not more than 0.2 per cent morphine,
0.1 per cent cocaine, or 0.1 per cent heroin.
This means, in other words, that these prepa-
rations may be bought and sold without any
restrictions and supplied by chemists without
a doctor?s prescription.
My proposal was that all the provisions of
the Convention particularly that concerning
medical prescriptions should be made to
apply to all preparations containing diacetyl-
morphine. This proposal was adopted by a
large majority of the Sub-Committee of experts.
Its object was to limit the consumption of
diacetylmorphine to a strict minimum, thus
bringing about, first of all, a reduction and
later on, perhaps, the suppression of the
manufacture of this alkaloid.
Our Rapporteur, Professor Perrot, spoke against
this proposal in the Sub-Committee as he has
done here. He explains that it is sentiment
which led the Sub-Committee, ?in contrast to
the stipulations of the previous article as regards
morphine and cocaine, to adopt, as regards
preparations of heroin, the suppression of the
percentage which means, in practice, that
it is impossible to sell to the public any prepa-
ration containing even the smallest quantity
of heroin without a medical prescription?.
I venture to think that M. Perrot is mistaken.
It is not a question of sentiment but a purely
scientific question ; and here I would ask the
Conference to allow me to make a short expla-
nation.
Medicinal opium contains 10 per cent of
morphine, while the coca leaf contains varying
quantities of cocaine. It is therefore impossible
to conceive of any delivery of opium or coca
leaf which does not constitute a delivery of
morphine or cocaine. But neither opium nor
the coca leaf contain diacetylmorphine. Dia-
cetylmorphine is not a natural product
it is a chemical product derived from mor-
phine.
We must authorise chemists to supply, on
their own responsibility, preparations containing
small quantities of opium or coca leaf, and it is
therefore necessary to exempt from the pro-
visions of the Convention preparations con-
taining certain doses of morphine or cocaine.
The action of these alkaloids is universally
known, and the number of preparations con-
taining them, which cannot in any way give
rise to a habit, is considerable.
But there is no reason to adopt the same
attitude as regards preparations containing
diacetylmorphine. Certain States viz ; the
United States of America, Canada, Poland,
Brazil, Norway and the Irish Free State
have already decided to declare diacetyl-
morphine to be a medicament the use of which is
not essential and which, as compared with mor-
phine, possesses only one advantage, viz. : that
it is, in far smaller doses, an excellent narcotic.
Other States, including France (see in this
connection Professor H. Coutiere?s brochure
circulated to us by the French delegation)
consider that ?heroin possesses special pro-
perties ; it acts more rapidly and can be
given in smaller doses than morphine. It
is undoubtedly useful in diseases of the res-
piratory tract, and its action is thrice as
powerful as that of morphine. It possesses
real advantages over the latter, for it greatly
stimulates intestinal peristalsis without dis-
turbing the digestive functions, and it produces
neither nausea nor vomiting?.
Is it not quite clear from the French concep-


tion of the therapeutical value of diacetylmor-
phine that this drug ought most certainly to
be prescribed by a doctor according to circum-
stances and ought not to be introduced into
officinal preparations offered to the public in
the form of patent medicines and supplied to
any customer without enquiry or without a
doctor?s prescription ?
Those are the reasons for my proposal. They
are quite unconnected with sentiment, their
only object being to safeguard public health
and to assist in the campaign against the
abusive use of narcotics. M. Perrot does
more than ask for the maintenance of the
provisions of 1912 and the supply, without
medical prescription, of preparations containing
0.1 per cent of heroin : he undertakes to
study the possibility of completely suppressing
the manufacture of this alkaloid. I hope my
honourable colleague will not take it amiss
if I say that I do not understand him.
He demands exemptions from the provisions
of the Convention ; he demands, that is
to say, delivery, without prescription or
accounts, of preparations containing 0.1
per cent of heroin or a half-gramme per bottle
of 500 c.cm., hundreds of thousands of which
may, in the form of patent medicines, be issued
throughout the world.
On the other hand, he says that he will con-
sider the possibility of suppressing the manufac-
ture of diacetylmorphine. What Professor Per-
rot asks and what he promises are in my opi-
nion two quite contradictory proposals. The
only measure which can enlighten the world as
to the need or otherwise of diacetylmorphine
and lead eventually to suppressing the manu-
facture would be to make the supply of all
preparations of diacetylmorphine in any form
whatever subject to the production of a medical
prescription.
I have been asked to quote cases of toxico-
mania due to pharmaceutical preparations con-
taining heroin. If such cases had been unknown
I should never have made my proposal. Isola-
ted cases, you may say ; but these cases are
always possible ; they depend on particular
circumstances and the total quantity of the
alkaloid contained in the preparation. This
is what led my friend Professor Perrot to vote
for the proposal in the first instance.
About three years ago, in Belgium, chemists
placed on the market certain patent medicines
intended to put children to sleep. These
medicines contained morphine. Several cases
of intoxication were noted.
Under the Royal Decree of April 25th, 1922,
it is forbidden to supply, except on a medical
prescription, any preparation containing any
quantity of narcotics whatever if the prepa-
ration in question is intended for children under
three years of age.
What did the patentees do ? They changed
their formula and the patent medicines are
sold as before.
Mr. President, gentlemen, I would draw your
special attention to this. This is not a ques-
tion of reducing production or manufac-
ture ; it is not a question of seriously pre-
judicing private interests. It is really the
first positive attempt to reduce the consumption
of a narcotic drug. For the sake of that spirit
which characterises Geneva, for the honour
of this Conference, I venture to hope that we
shall unanimously agree to the text adopted
by the large majority of the Sub-Committee
of experts. [Applause).
The President
Translation : M. Perrot, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
IV!. Perrot (France)
Translation : Mr. President, gentlemen, I
thought, in coming here, that we had been con-
vened to consider how narcotic drugs might
be prevented from getting into the hands of
the public in such a way as to become a danger
to any of the nations represented here. I do not
think that the discussion to which you are now
listening has this object in view, for I do not
know of any case proving that pharmaceutical
specialities have become a danger to any
nation.
In these circumstances I ask your permission
to examine the arguments which have been laid
before me. I propose to be brief, for in my
opinion this is not a question which ought to
take up too much of the precious time of this
Conference, which has other and more serious
work to accomplish, in view of the fact that the
present question is simply that of tolerating
something which has been admitted since 1912.
I have been told and a French text has
been quoted in support of the statement
that ?heroin was three times as powerful as
morphine?. If it is more powerful, and if we
decided that something ought to be done to
draw the attention of public opinion to the
matter, I should certainly have agreed to an
indication being given.
If, on the contrary, we desire the disap-
pearance of certain drugs which are bought and
sold in the world market in the course of lawful
trade, and have so far caused no trouble, and
if the specially dangerous character of heroin
is to be our pretext, the Hague Convention
must be modified, and that is the point at
issue. In thus demanding total suppression,
we are going to exaggerated lengths, much in
the same way as the United States delegation
when it proposed that codein and the other non-
narcotic derivatives of morphine alluded to by
M. de Myttenaere should be included in the
Convention. To revert to heroin, I do not think
the bare fact of its being a morphine derivative
is in itself a sufficient reason for making this
drug the subject of drastic regulations.
As regards the conversations which I have
been able to have with some of our number,
particularly with my Belgian colleague, I will
repeat that in my private capacity, I regret that
new medicaments of an extremely dangerous
character such as heroin might make their
appearance in the scientific world. Nobody
is to blame for this except Science, who is a
severe mistress and before whose will we must
bow. Since the question of suppressing the
distribution of a medicament has been raised,
why should we not once again go into the whole
question of competence ?
It is not for me to say whether heroin ought
to be abolished some day. If we desire to
reach a conclusion concerning heroin, we must
consult the great medical authorities of the
world who alone are competent to express
a definitive opinion. Moreover, if the Advisory
Committee on Opium, which recently met, took
no other decision than that which is included


in the Hague Convention, it acted according we have ourselves admitted that the dose
to its conviction.
If heroin is by far the most active and most
dangerous product, we are prepared to assist
you in regulating its use ; but I think that the
quantity in question does not constitute a
danger to society.
Finally, since it is the habit, when making a
declaration, to conclude with an appeal to sen-
timent, 1 would like to say that I desire as much
as anyone to see the abolition, for all illicit pur-
poses, of the use of narcotic drugs which are
a danger to the world and against which we
must wage intensive and ruthless warfare.
The President
Translation : M. de Myttenaere, delegate
of Belgium, will address the Conference.
M. de IVlyttenaere (Belgium)
Translation : M. Perrot has just alluded
to the Health Section of the League of Nations
or rather to the Advisory Committee. In this
connection I should like to remind you of what
the Health Section of the League of Nations
said on diacetylmorphine or heroin :
?Diacetylmorphine (heroin) is a very
dangerous drug, still more toxic than mor-
phine and still more dangerous as regards
the forming of the drug habit. Since the
pharmacologists and clinical practitioners
admit that heroin can be dispensed with
in therapeutics, the Mixed Sub-Committee
recommends that the possibility of entire-
ly forbidding its manufacture should be
considered.? (Document O.D.C. 73.)
The Health Section of the League of Nations
goes further than I do. I only request the
reduction of an exaggerated and abusive dis-
tribution of an heroic medicament without
advice from a doctor.
The President
Translation : I call on M. Betances, dele-
gate of the Dominican Republic, to speak.
IVi. Betances (Dominican Republic)
Translation : In Sub-Committee F I sup-
ported the contention that we have not the
right completely to suppress the manufacture
of heroin, because, even if it is a very dangerous
drug and many doctors think that it could be
dispensed with in therapeutics, there are many
others who consider it to be very effective.
I should tell you that there are certain medicines
containing heroin which I employ for my per-
sonal use and which I could not do without.
I propose a solution half way between that
suggested by M. Perrot and that suggested
by the delegate of Belgium, namely : that
we should not forbid the manufacture of heroin
but should reduce the quantity proposed by
M. Perrot.
The President
Translation : M. Perrot, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : I thank the delegate of the
Dominican Republic for the statement which
he has made. He corroborates practically all
my statements, lending to them the weight of
his authority and personal observations. As
appeared to be too strong, I willingly agree to
reduce it by 50 per cent that is to say to
0.05. Ido not think that anybody could say
that such a dose could produce any harmful
effect either on individual consumers or on
society.
The President
Translation : M. Chodzko, delegate of Po-
land, will address the Conference.
!Va. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : When considering the French
proposal we must ask ourselves what is its
true significance. It is suggested, you will
observe, to exempt a product from a provision
of the Hague Convention, as has already been
done in the case of morphine and cocaine.
What is the object of this exemption ? It is
to facilitate the employment of this drug without
a medical prescription in urgent cases. That is
the only object in view.
Although we can admit that, as regards mor-
phine, there are urgent cases cases of intense
suffering in which morphine must be obtained
immediately without a doctor?s prescription, 1
do not see that there is any need to extend these
facilities to medicines the urgent use of which
is not so justified. Indeed, if we already have
morphine, it is not necessary since heroin pro-
duces the same effects- ?to extend the facilities
in question so as to include a second medica-
ment which does not render any different ser-
vices. In short, morphine is sufficient for all
purposes.
Neither do I see, by the way, why we should
admit an exemption in the case of cocaine, which
is never an urgent medicament.
It is highly interesting to observe that in
Article 9 of the new draft Convention which
we have before us we have already provided for
the possibility of chemists supplying the drug
in urgent cases without a medical prescription.
M. Perrot himself drew up this article at our
request. Article 9, as it stands, is quite suf-
ficient. There is no need to admit further
exemptions outside this article.
Turning now to the consideration of heroin,
I think we should once more stress the fact
that, by allowing morphine to be supplied
without medical prescription, we have com-
pletely fulfilled our obligations towards suffering
humanity.
In support of this point of view 1 will only ven-
ture to read a few lines from a letter sent by
the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Warsaw.
This letter is addressed to the Director of
Public Health and contains the following
passage :
?... In the opinion of the Council of the
Faculty of Medicine at Warsaw University,
as expressed at its meeting on May 9th,
1924, the manufacture of heroin could be
completely suppressed without any detri-
ment to therapeutics.
?Diacetylmorphine, or heroin, is of no
greater positive value than morphine,
although far more toxic. As regards its
calmative action in the case of coughing,
heroin is less effective than codein, or, at
any rate, is no more effective than the latter
non-toxic and well-known alkaloid. The
prolonged use of heroin leads to heroino-


mania, which, as regards its effects, is much
more dangerous than morphinomania itself.
?Taking into account the fact that heroin
is not more effective as a medicament than
morphine and codein, and that it leads
with far greater ease to acute intoxication
and the habit of permanent abusive use,
there is no reason to oppose the proposal
to prohibit the manufacture of heroin. On
the contrary, this suggestion should receive
support.??
The Polish Government, therefore, acting on
the unanimous advice of all the Polish Faculties
of Medicine, has requested the total suppression
of heroin. To-day, however, we are discussing
only the question of the exemption of heroin
that is to say, the possibility of facilitating the
smuggling of this drug, for, if we allow the supply
of heroin in even minimum doses, it will be
possible by boiling to obtain considerable
quantities of the toxic substance. We accord
exemption in the case of morphine for reasons
of humanity and in order to prevent suffering
in urgent cases. But it is not necessary for
us to accord a further exemption in the case
of heroin.
M. Perrot has told us that he does not know
of any case of intoxication by heroin. I would
remind him that in this country, not more than
two months ago, there occurred at Lausanne
a very important case of intoxication by
heroin on a large scale in which two or three
persons lost their lives.
Although we no longer demand suppression
for the majority of the members of this
Conference would not agree to it I could not
in any case accept the proposal at present
before us, and if the Conference accepted it
I should, on behalf of my Government, have
to make the fullest possible reservations.
The President
Translation: M. Carriere, delegate of Switzer-
land, will address the Conference.
IVI. Carriere (Switzerland), Chairman of
Sub-Committee F :
Translation : Ido not wish to prolong this
discussion, which has doubtless lasted long
enough ; but I should like, before it ends, to
defend the point of view of Sub-Committee F
and support the statements made by our emi-
nent Belgian colleague at the beginning of the
discussion, in favour of the proposal adopted by
a large majority in the Sub-Committee.
I should like first of all to confirm M. de
Myttenaere?s observations concerning the
opinion of the Health Committee of the League
of Nations, which is composed of very distin-
guished experts. This Committee recommended
that the possibility of prohibiting the manufac-
ture and distribution of heroin should be exa-
mined. If the Health Committee did not
think that the drug in question could be prohi-
bited immediately, that was because medical
opinion was perhaps not yet absolutely una-
nimous as to the therapeutical value of heroin.
One fact, however, is certain ; Heroin, as
has been stated again and again to-day, is
a dangerous medicament. Even admitting that
it has some therapeutical value, it is a medica-
ment which, from a therapeutical point of
view, may be replaced by other drugs. I should
state that I am not quite in agreement with the
eminent Warsaw professor whose opinions our
colleague M. Chodzko has just communicated to
us. The therapeutical value of this medicament
is very limited. It is utilised principally in
cases of tuberculosis, and did I, as a national of
a country which receives a large number of
tuberculosis patients, desire to adopt a purely
material attitude, I might defend heroin,
for it is used to quite an appreciable extent
in Switzerland. But I repeat that, as a whole,
the usefulness of this medicament is restricted,
and it may, at any rate in most cases, be replaced
by other drugs. We may therefore say that
its therapeutical value is practically nil.
In connection with any value which this
drug may possess, w r e must consider its extreme
danger. Even in far smaller doses it is more
dangerous than morphine and cocaine. Heroin
can, unlike morphine but like cocaine, be taken
in the form of snuff, and I think that that in
itself constitutes a very great danger.
In reverting to the ideas expressed by the
Health Committee, Sub-Committee F wished,
I think, to obtain an indication of our views. It
did not wish, as the United States requested,
to prohibit the use of heroin entirely, but it
desired to restrict the use of this drug to abso-
lutely indispensable needs. We do not prohi-
bit the use of heroin ; we only request that
its use shall be subject to the formalities of a
medical prescription in every case. That will
leave the partisans of heroin a sufficient margin
and will not give them much scope for vehement
protest.
Consequently, gentlemen, without wishing to
prolong the discussion and I would remind
you that I speak not as Swiss delegate but
simply as a member of Sub-Committee F I
would recommend the acceptance of the pro-
posal now before you. I am afraid that a
reduction of the percentage would not, in a
word, be of any real use. We may be requested
to-morrow to alter these percentages again.
I think that we ought to follow the initia-
tive taken by a large number of countries,
including the United States, Brazil, Poland and
others. I think it is quite clear that heroin
is already regarded as a danger, and I feel that
this Conference ought to adopt Sub-Committee
F?s suggestion as submitted.
M. Perrot said he did not wish to invoke
reasons of sentiment ; and yet he himself
adduced at least one sentimental argument,
and I think that, on the whole, our Conference
has been actuated from the beginning of the
debate far more by sentiment than by other
considerations.
M. Perrot has said that science is a stern
mistress, before whom he bows. I [think, how-
ever, that we need not follow out her commands
to the letter or accept her orders if they are
likely to prove dangerous. Science and mistress
she may be, but we ought not to bow down to
her. Consequently, Mr. President and gen-
tlemen, I would most earnestly beg you to adopt
the conclusions of Sub-Committee F. [Ap-
plause.)
The President
Translation : M. Perrot, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : I once more crave your par-
don for prolonging this discussion, but I think


that M. Chodzko has been labouring under a
misapprehension. The question is not one
of urgent medicaments (medicaments which
have already been dealt with in Article 9) ;
it is simply one of allowing a certain number
of medicaments to be available to the public,
subject to no restrictions other than those
which govern ordinary pharmaceutical pro-
ducts. To my mind, it is little more than a
problem of pharmaceutical trade organisation.
For this reason, I think we are wasting our
time m discussing the question ; we are here
to deal with matters of far greater importance.
I would venture to reply to M. Carriere that,
if I defend the use of heroin, it is precisely
because it is one of the most important medi-
caments in the treatment of tuberculosis in
its early stages, and I think that tuberculosis is
a disease concerning which an international
convention would not be useless. Considering
the question only from the scientific point of
view, I beg you to reflect and to examine once
more the situation as it really is ; to believe
that the question is not one of urgent medica-
ments but only of medicaments which will
be tolerated and may be obtained by the public,
subject to the provisions of domestic regula-
tions, which are in many cases extremely
severe.
The President
Translation : M. Pernambuco, delegate of
Brazil, will address the Conference.
M. Pernambuco (Brazil) :
Translation : The question of heroin has
often been discussed in Brazil as well as the
question whether this drug could be completely
suppressed. The Brazilian National Depart-
ment of Public Health, after going into the
matter with great care, has declared that heroin
could be suppressed because it could be re-
placed by other medicaments.
As regards the employment of this medica-
ment in tuberculosis, I can adduce no arguments
for or against such use. But I know that it
has sometimes been employed in mental diseases
and that doctors have not been sure whether
the signs of distress shown by their patients
were due to their illness or to the fact that
the drug was no longer being administered.
In any case the medical authorities in Brazil
were agreed that it would be desirable to abo-
lish the use of this drug. As many doctors still
believe that we cannot entirely suppress heroin,
we have decided to support the conclusions sub-
mitted by Sub-Committee F, namely, that
the use of heroin should still be authorised
but should be subject to a medical prescrip-
tion.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. El Guindy,
delegate of Egypt, to speak.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : Mr. President, gentlemen, in
Egypt, we suffer greatly from thes muggling
and illicit use of heroin, and the medical and
administrative authorities in our country are
of opinion that heroin ought to be completely
suppressed. However, as views on this point
are divided, I declare that I am in favour of
placing very severe restrictions on this substance.
I think it would be well to leave the Health
Committee of the League of Nations to carry
out the necessary enquiries among international
scientific institutions with a view to making
it possible for us entirely to suppress heroin
if the enquiries prove conclusive in this respect.
We should insert in the Convention a clause
to the effect that complete suppression will
be admitted on the recommendation of the
Office international d?Hygiene publique and the
Health Committee of the League of Nations.
Thus we shall not be limited merely to what we
decide now. We shall leave to technical insti-
tutions the right to constrain us in the future
to carry out the complete suppression of heroin.
The President
Translation : If I understand the Egyptian
delegate aright, he proposes that a recommen-
dation shall be inserted in the Final Act. If
that is so, I would request M. El Guindy to be
good enough to submit his recommendation
in writing.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne, delegate of the
British Empire, will address the Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
The Conference has been listening, for the
last hour and a-half, to a variety of views expres-
sed by the experts of different countries ; it
has been listening to them with a great deal
of interest and, I imagine also, with some bewil-
derment. Some experts have been in favour
of maintaining the existing exemption for
heroin preparations contained in Article 14
of the Hague Convention ; some have been
in favour of its complete suppression, and one
delegate the representative of the Dominican
Republic has suggested a middle course.
An English poet of the eighteenth century
once wrote : ?Who shall decide when doctors
disagree ??? I think a number of delegates
in this Conference must feel themselves to be
very much in that position at the present
moment.
I am not going to intervene in regard to the
expert side the technical side of the ques-
tion. The person who intervenes in a quarrel
of this kind usually attracts the blows of both
parties. I am, however, going to submit to the
Conference that this is not a question which
can be decided wholly on technical considera-
tions.
The proposal before the Conference in the
report of Sub-Committee F is a proposal to
alter the terms of the Hague Convention. It
seems to me that the question which this
Conference has to decide is whether a case has
been made out for that change by those who
support it.
I think the whole Conference will agree that
it is not desirable lightly to make alterations
in the Hague Convention. States have adop-
ted legislation on the lines of that Convention
in order to give effect to its provisions, and the
public have become accustomed, by this time,
to those provisions.
I suggest that the matter before us is one
which should be decided on evidence as to the
actual necessity for the change. In other words,
has the present exemption been found, in the
experience of the different countries, to be
injurious and dangerous to the public ? It
seems to me that the onus of proof is on those
who advocate the change. The question for


the Conference is : has that onus been ful-
filled ? If it has, 1 for one should be prepared
to accept the change.
1 have looked very carefully at the report of
Sub-Committee F, and the only argument that
I have found in that report is contained in the
following passage :
?Impressed by the terrible ravages of
the heroin habit, especially in the United
States of America, the Sub-Committee
... adopted the suppression of the percentage,
which means, in practice, that it is impos-
sible to sell to the public any preparation
containing even the smallest quantity of
heroin without a medical prescription.?
That is all that the Sub-Committee says on
the point. That is the only argument that
is adduced in the report of the Sub-Committee
in favour of the change. I cannot find that the
Sub-Committee has adduced any proofs, and
I must say that, while listening to the debate
this morning, I have not heard any proofs, to
show that the exemption allowed by the Hague
Convention for preparations which contain a
very small percentage of heroin is in any way
responsible for the ravages of the heroin habit
to which Sub-Committee F alludes.
There are two grounds, I think, on which the
change proposed by the Sub-Committee might
be justified. The first ground would be if it
is proved that these preparations give rise
to the heroin habit or are used by addicts to
indulge that habit. So far as Great Britain
is concerned, I am not aware that there is any
evidence that this is so. I should be very glad
to hear from the delegations of other countries
whether there is any evidence in their countries
that the use of these preparations, and the sale
of them to the public without a medical pres-
cription, does, in fact, in any way contribute
to heroin addiction.
Even if there were evidence in some countries
to that effect, would that be a reason I
submit this to the Conference why this
Conference should ask all countries to make
this change ? Each Government, of course, has
full liberty to take any measures, additional to
those contained in ?the Hague Convention, which
it thinks necessary to control the drug traffic
in its own country. But it seems to me to be
a question and a serious question whether
the views of some should be imposed on all.
This is an international convention, in which
we are trying to arrive, by agreement, at fuller
and stronger provisions for controlling the drug
habit and for controlling the international
traffic, and it seems to me that we cannot base
a sound convention on experience which is
only partial.
The second ground on which the change might
be justified would be if it could be proved that
these preparations preparations containing
only a very small amount of heroin were
used by persons engaged in the illicit traffic,
national or international. This is the aspect
of the matter which is specially interesting to
the United States of America, who raised this
question before the Conference.
Is there any evidence that these preparations
are in fact made use of by those engaged in the
contraband traffic ? I am not aware of any
evidence that it is so, and, on the face of it,
it seems very improbable that it should be so.
These exempted preparations contain only one
part of heroin in one thousand. It is ex-
tremely unlikely that persons engaged in the con-
traband trade would use preparations con-
taining so infinitesimal a proportion of the drug
which they wish to smuggle in order to carry
on their operations. It would not be commer-
cially profitable.
It seems to me, therefore and I suggest it
to the Conference that, unless there is evidence
either as regards the one ground which I have
mentioned or as regards the other, we should
consider very carefully whether it is desirable,
by an international convention, to impose on
all countries restrictions which may meet with
opposition in some countries.
There are two general considerations which
I should like to lay before the Conference and
which seem to me to have some weight. The
first of those considerations is this: The sup-
port on which our work must rely, and on
which the Governments must rely, is the sup-
port of public opinion. Now, an extension of
the provisions of the Hague Convention which
would make it impossible for the public to
obtain certain preparations without a medical
prescription is going to inconvenience the
public. They will be put to trouble and they
will be put to expense in order to obtain a medi-
cal prescription. The fact that trouble and
expense will be caused is, of course, no reason
why that restriction should not be imposed
if there is sufficient evidence to justify it. I
come back then to what I said before : is there
evidence, or is there not, to justify this incon-
venience being placed on the public ?
Unless we can satisfy the public that such
is the case, unless we can convince them that
this additional restriction is necessary in order
to meet a public danger, then, I am afraid, we
must run some risk of alienating a portion, at
any rate, of public opinion, which is at present
strongly behind the work of this Conference.
There is a second general consideration, which
is this : This change, if it is inserted in the
new Convention and is accepted by the Govern-
ments, will involve in the case of many countries
(certainly in the case of my own) a change in
the legislation of the country. The Govern-
ment will have to go to Parliament in order to
get its assent to the change. What case will
the Governments be able to put before their
Parliaments ? They will be asked what evi-
dence there is as to the necessity for the change,
and I submit that we ought to have more evi-
dence than we have at present before we decide
to accept the change.
Personally, I have no strong feeling in the
matter one way or the other. I should be
glad to hear further evidence, and, if further
evidence can be produced, I would be willing,
as I said just now, to accept the change, or
I would be willing to accept the solution which
was proposed by the delegate for the Domini-
can Republic, which is to the effect that a middle
course should be taken and the existing exemp-
tion retained, but in a modified form.
I do submit, however, that this Conference
should be slow in attempting to impose on all
countries views which are only held in some,
and in asking Governments to accept a change
which they may be unable to justify before
their own Parliaments and before their own
people.


, Translation : M. Bourgois, delegate of
trance, will address the Conference.
IVI. Bourgois (France)
7 ranslation : Ido not propose to treat the
subject from a medical or scientific point of
view. I speak merely as a member of Sub-
committee F and as author of the draft sub-
mitted to the Preparatory Committee, the
object of which was to tighten up the provisions
of the Hague Convention against smuggling.
The three narcotics morphine, cocaine and
heroin possess properties so similar that it
does not appear entirely logical to apply to
preparations containing heroin a treatment
different from that reserved for preparations
containing morphine and cocaine.
It is not the case that preparations containing
heroin in the doses permitted under the Hague
Convention have ever led to abuse. There is
nothing to prove that these preparations have
been a source of toxicomania ; nor is it the
case, as Sir Malcolm Delevingne has rightly
pointed out, that the illicit trade in heroin
has ever been carried on by means of such
preparations. Traffickers would have the grea-
test difficulty in extracting narcotics therefrom,
and they certainly could not do so by boiling,
as the Polish delegate has suggested. Traf-
fickers in pharmaceutical products would obtain
no advantage from fraudulent practices of this
kind.
As the author of the draft which tightens
up the provisions of the Hague Convention,
I tried to discover where there were loopholes.
In France, about three hundred offences are
dealt with annually. I have examined the
records of about a thousand cases spread over
three years. I have never in one single case
observed that traffickers used such preparations.
I do not think, then, that the measure now
submitted to you provides a method for pre-
venting illicit traffic which, I repeat, has never
been carried on by means of pharmaceutical
preparations. I do think, however, that this
measure would hamper the most legitimate
forms of trade.
As Sir Malcolm Delevingne has said, it would
not be wise by means of an international con-
vention to force all countries to make a change
of this kind.
I would be ready to withdraw the French pro-
posal immediately if proof were forthcoming of
one single case of toxicomania produced by
heroin, or a single case of contraband conducted
by means of pharmaceutical, preparations.
In these circumstances the French delega-
tion is prepared to support the proposal of the
delegate of the Dominican Republic. I would
draw your particular attention to Sir Malcolm
Delevingne?s observation : these preparations
cannot be dangerous, and they cannot be em-
ployed in smuggling, because the proportion of
heroin which they contain is only 20 in a
thousand.
The President
Translation : Mr. Riddell, delegate of Canada,
will address the Conference.
Mr. Riddell (Canada):
My Government feels that no hardship would
result from the total suppression of heroin.
This is not only the opinion of the Government
but the opinion of the best medical authority
in my country, based, as 1 believe, on adequate
experience, therefore I shall support the re-
commendation of Sub-Committee F.
The President
Translation : M. Gotuzzo, delegate of Brazil,
will address the Conference.
IVI. Gotuzzo (Brazil) :
Translation : M. Bourgois has throwm out
a little challenge to the opponents of heroin.
He has said that if proof were forthcoming
of one single case of toxicomania produced by
heroin
IVI. Bourgois (France)
Translation : I said ?by heroin prepara-
tions?.
IVI. Gotuzzo (Brazil)
Translation : he would withdraw the French
delegation s proposal. Cases of toxicomania
by heroin are certainly not as numerous as
those produced by morphine, but they exist. I
cannot prove my statement here and now, as
I should like to, but I remember having read
lepoits concerning cases of intoxication by
pieparations containing heroin. If cases of
intoxication by heroin are not more numerous,
it is because people are afraid of this medicament
and because it is not sufficiently well known.
We doctors are afraid to give heroin because
the effects produced by it are often different
from what we expected. That is one reason
why we should interrupt its delivery
to the public. Now is precisely the time when
we should take measures to prevent the wider
distribution of preparations containing heroin
and should, if possible, suppress the drug com-
pletely.
The President
Translation : M. de Myttenaere, delegate
of Belgium, will address the Conference.
IVI. de Myttenaere (Belgium)
Translation : I should like briefly to reply
to Sir Malcolm Delevingne and also to M
Bourgois.
Their anxiety to change nothing in the Con-
\ tuition seems to me to be rather extreme, for
surely we have met here precisely in order to
make certain changes in or additions to the
Convention.
As regards internal legislation, the Conven-
tion will, whatever form it may assume, neces-
sitate cei tain changes. 7 he British delegate
has referred to the difficulties which the
public may experience if our proposal is adopted.
As a mattei of fact, if the Conference accepts
our point of view, the patentee will simply
change his formula, and it will still be possible
foi him to sell his patent medicine without
medical prescription, as in the past. It is
quite certain that our proposal does not at
all involve the suppression of patent medicines
but only the prohibition of the delivery of
heroin without a medical prescription.
1 Ik leis no doubt that there have been cases
of intoxication through preparations containing
heroin, the victims becoming heroin addicts.
I can, if you like, give* you names and
addresses. Please do not tell me that a per-
The President


son cannot become a heroin addict by taking
small doses of this alkaloid when I have seen
people take in wine-glasses or tumblers a sub-
stance which they should take in a teaspoon or
dessertspoon.
I think it is clear, M. Bourgois, that you have
only had occasion to observe such cases of
intoxication as have led to convictions. Did
not the persons in question begin by taking
small quantities of heroin and then proceed
to take larger doses ? We should therefore
demand, as proposed by the Egyptian delegate,
the inclusion in the Convention of a proposal
that the Council of the League of Nations
shall recommend Governments to conduct an
enquiry as to the possibility of suppressing the
manufacture of heroin.
Our proposal is that heroin should only be
supplied on the advice of a medical man.
Statistics of these prescriptions in all countries
would furnish the best possible evidence as
to the necessity of heroin or otherwise.
To allow chemists and manufacturers for,
alas, it is not only chemists but also manufac-
turers who produce these substances to offer
heroin promiscuously to the public is to allow
the illegal use of medicine.
I earnestly support the Committee of Experts?
point of view. We desire to carry out an
enquiry into the necessity for heroin an
enquiry which would give an indication as
to the value of this alkaloid, not only from the
commercial standpoint but also from the medi-
cal point of view.
That is what we must desire ; it represents,
after all, only the execution of justice in the
domain of medicine and pharmacy and the
care of public health.
The President
Translation : M. El Guindy, delegate of
Egypt, will address the Conference.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) ;
Translation : Although I made a proposal
concerning the enquiry to be undertaken by the
Health Committee of the League of Nations
and the Office international d?Hygiene publique,
I did not do so with the sole intention that
heroin should only be supplied on medical
prescription. 1 desire to go further. You are
aware that many countries have already sup-
pressed the use of heroin, and my desire was
to render the system stricter and finally to
achieve the complete suppression of the drug.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Dinichert, dele-
gate of Switzerland, to speak.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : It is all the more easy for me
-to intervene in this discussion in that you
doubtless do not expect me to say anything of
interest as regards the scientific and medical
side of the question. I venture, nevertheless,
to trespass on your time in the hope that it
may be possible for the Conference to reach an
agreement, unanimous if possible, on a question
which, whatever may be said, is of great impor-
tance and which, at this moment, appears to
have led to some slight difference of view in
this Conference.
I do not intend to repeat what has been said
concerning the harmfulness of the preparations
containing heroin which we have been discussing
that is to say, those which contain less than
one part of heroin in a thousand. But I
know that, in fact, a large number of delegations
and Governments I might almost say the
majority regard this product as presenting
special dangers. The proof of this is that a
certain number of States have already decided
to prohibit heroin entirely. As we have met
in order to attain two objects in the compaign
against narcotics internal control and inter-
national control, two aims which often appear
to have different aspects I venture to state
that the more important question of the two is
that of international control.
Countries manufacturing these products, which
offer them to the public and even insist on
their exportation, obviously shoulder a great
responsibility as regards the rest of the world
and those countries which consider these sub-
stances to be dangerous. Ido not see, there-
fore, why we should not agree to say that, if we
manufacture these drugs and sell them, we
are at least willing to provide other countries
with the guarantees which the new Convention
will contain. Could not we all agree to submit
these remedies, as regards the international
trade therein, to the guarantees to be contained
in the Convention ?
I was, moreover, particularly impressed by
the remark made by both the French and
British delegations that in certain countries
habits have been acquired which should be
respected and that there exists a public opi-
nion which might, on account of these habits,
revolt against too severe regulation. In this
case I would venture to go so far as to say
that if, after all, a country considers that it
must allow a certain latitude within its borders,
it is for that country to assume the responsi-
bility. I would say willingly : Let it take
such steps as it may think fit.
Before concluding, I beg to state that I
was not very greatly impressed by Sir Malcolm
Delevingne?s argument that the proposal will
involve a change in the legislation of his country.
Most of us, happily, will be obliged to modify
our national laws, for, if we have not had to
do it in the past, it is because we have been
marking time since 1912. Moreover, I do
not see why one ought to modify a law in order
to suppress a percentage if one is not obliged to
do so in order to bring about a reduction.
But I revert to what I have just said. Could
not the Conference unanimously agree that
in regard to this question there is an inter-
national duty to be fulfilled, but that as regards
domestic legislation a certain amount of lati-
tude might be allowed to each country ?
In conclusion, I would beg you all to adhere
to the text which is before us on the understan-
ding that the various countries will be able to
make reservations later as regards the domes-
tic use of these products.
I am one of those who believe that conventions
should be signed with the smallest number of
reservations possible, but I think also that it
would be better to make certain reservations thus
limited in character than that we should come
to a deadlock. For I think that one party can
scarcely impose its will on another in matters
of this kind.
The President
Translation : M. Bourgois, delegate of
France, will address the Conference.


M. Bourgois (Fiance) :
Translation : I only wish to add one word.
There are certain disadvantages in signing a
convention with reservations made by a number
of States. That is, indeed, the more complex
solution ; the simpler alternative is for those
States which feel that these preparations con-
stitute a danger to adopt, in their own legis-
lation, all measures which they deem to be
indispensable.
The President
Translation : As no one else wishes to speak,
I declare the discussion closed.
We have before us a recommendation propo-
sed by the Egyptian delegation. I do not
think there will be any point in examining this
recommendation before we come to consider the
Final Act, and I request the Conference to
authorise me to send the text which the Egyp-
tian delegate has kindly handed to me direct
to the Drafting Committee. The latter will
make certain formal changes which the Egyp-
tian delegate will, I am sure, be able to accept,
and the discussion of the recommendation will
be deferred until we consider the text of the
Final Act.
We have an amendment submitted by the
French delegation. I understand that the
latter has modified its amendment to the
report in conformity with the suggestion of the
delegate of the Dominican Republic that
is to say, the French delegation only desires to
make the following modification in Article
14 (c) of the Hague Convention of 1912 : ?Substi-
tute, for 0.1 per cent heroin, 0.05 per cent?.
1 will therefore put this proposal to the vote
and request those delegates who are in favour
kindly to rise in their places in order that we
need not have a roll-call.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : Could you first give me infor-
mation on just one point, please ? I think there
is also a proposal put forward by the Swiss
delegation.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I did not make any proposal.
I merely explained how I thought unanimity
could be obtained on the draft submitted by
Sub-Committee F, since, after this draft has been
adopted, any Government which desires to
do so later may make a reservation concerning
the traffic in and domestic consumption of this
drug. I merely threw out the idea in the
hope that unanimity might be obtained. I
did not make a formal proposal.
The President
Translation : Let us now take the vote.
Those who are in favour of maintaining the
provision of the Hague Convention with the
modification suggested are requested to rise.
(Six delegations rose in favour of the propo-
sal.)
Those who are in favour of accepting the
proposals contained in Sub-Committee F?s report
are requested to rise.
(21 delegations rose in favour of the proposal.)
The conclusions of the report of Sub-Commit-
tee F are therefore adopted by a majority.
The report will be referred to the Drafting
Committee.
The Conference rose at 1 p.m.

96. EXAMINATION OF THE REPORT OF
SUB-COMMITTEE F : QUESTION OF
INDIAN HEMP.
The President
Translation : We have to discuss this after-
noon item ?B? of the agenda ; Indian
Hemp 1 ; I call upon the Rapporteur, Professor
Perrot, to speak.
M. Perrot (France), Rapporteur :
Translation : The question of Indian hemp
was referred to Sub-Committee F at the request
of the Egyptian delegate.
1 See Annex 28
As you are aware, Indian hemp is not a'pre-
paration, but is simply the upper part of the
female tops of the hemp plant, which grows
chiefly in India.
This question was a particularly complex
one, because the hemp used for the manufac-
ture of cloth belongs to the same botanical
species, and accordingly unlike the case of
the opium poppy it is extremely difficult to
abolish its cultivation. India exports, I un-
derstand, some. 100,000 tons of hemp fibre
yearly.
The question, from the narcotic point of
view, may be stated as follows ; This variety
of Indian hemp, which grows at a somewhat
high altitude, yields a resin which is widely
sold in Central Asia and is a dangerous narcotic
akin to heroin. Thus the harmful custom of
smoking hemp and absorbing preparations
composed chiefly of hemp resin is widespread
throughout Central Asia and also in parts of
Africa. It is necessary, therefore, to endeavour
to suppress its use, particularly in Egypt and
Northern Africa.
The majority of foreign nations have prohi-
bited its use ; but, in certain cases, a monopoly


has been established. The French position
as regards Tunisia, for example, is as follows:
Me have passed strict laws prohibiting entirely
the use of hashish or other preparations
containing harmful substances. In conse-
quence of the drastic measures taken to suppress
all these harmful preparations, their illicit use
has practically disappeared, and, as a result,
hashish smokers are no longer to be found there.
I n Egypt, the laws are extremely severe.
As regards pharmaceutical preparations, under
French law and, I believe, under Italian law
also the preparation of Indian hemp is
subject to the same regulations as opium. A
number of internal regulations and prohibitions
regarding this matter are already in force.
The Egyptian Government has asked that
international prohibitions should be extended as
widely as possible in order to prevent the
unrestricted use of hemp resins.
These, then, were the considerations on which
Sub-Committee F based its discussion. It
began by formulating a definition of Indian
hemp in accordance with the texts of existing
pharmacopoeias. The definition is as follows :
?By Indian hemp is understood the
dried flowering or fruiting tops of the pis-
tillate plant Cannabis sativa, from which
the resin has not been extracted, under
whatever name they may be designated
in commerce.?
The Sub-Committee also discussed the question
of the raw resin. The Brazilian delegate pointed
out that Indian hemp had some time pre-
viously been introduced into his country and
that preparations known as ?diamba?,
composed chiefly of Indian hemp resin, were
in use there and were a source of danger.
1 his was in addition to what we already knew
regarding North Africa and Asia.
The Sub-Committee, being convinced that
something could be done to protect the world
from these dangers, has studied the question
of hemp resin and submits its observations in
the following text :
?The use of Indian hemp and the pre-
parations derived therefrom may only be
authorised for medical and scientific pur-
poses. The raw resin (charas), however,
* which is extracted from the female tops
of the Cannabis sativa L., together with
the various preparations (hashish, chira,
esrar, diamba, etc.) of which it forms the
basis, not being at present utilised for
medical purposes and only being suscep-
tible of utilisation for harmful purposes,
in the same manner as other narcotics,
may not be produced, sold, traded in,
etc., under any circumstances whatever.?
Of course, the Sub-Committee is simply
laying technical facts before you and does not
suggest any means of introducing an inter-
national prohibition, because it has not endea-
voured to find such means. It merely desires
to show the Conference that raw resin derived
from Indian hemp should not form an article
of international commerce.
Such is our general statement on the Indian
hemp question, and I am, of course, at your
disposal should you desire to put any other
questions of a technical nature.
The President
Translation : M. Bourgois, delegate of
France, will address the Conference.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : We are all agreed as regards
the question of principle, but no text providing
for the application of these principles has yet
been prepared for inclusion in the International
Convention.
Discussions of texts are usually somewhat
slow and unsatisfactory at plenary meetings,
and, speaking on behalf of a number of dele-
gations, I ask that a Sub-Committee should
be appointed to draw up this text.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : May I regard M. Bourgois?
statement as tantamount to an acceptance of
the Rapporteur?s report ?
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : I cannot give any undertaking
on the subject, since I am not aware of the
intentions of the various members of the Con-
ference.
The President
Translation : We have before us a proposal
that a Sub-Committee should be appointed to
draw up a definite text, as the report merely
deals with the subject from the scientific and
technical points of view.
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : I should like to add that all
the members of Sub-Committee F agreed
that a definition of this resin should be formally
laid down in order to prevent the possibility
of its being changed.
The President
Translation : I venture to make a suggestion
as to the appointment of the members of the
Sub-Committee.
Prince Damras (Siam)
Translation : The Siamese delegation has
not received any instruction from its Govern-
ment concerning the question of Indian hemp.
Therefore, I must make a reservation on that
point.
The President
7 ranslation : The Conference agrees, I
think, that a Sub-Committee should be formed
to draw up a definite text.
I suggest as members of this Sub-Committee
the representatives of Egypt, France, British
Empire, India, Sweden, Turkey, Uruguay and
also Siam, should the Siamese delegate desire
to take part, despite the reservation he has
made.
Prince Damras (Siam)
7 ranslation: I should like to be present
at the Sub-Committee.
fVI. El Guindy (Egypt)
7 ranslation : Belgium is also concerned in
the Indian hemp question, and, as her represen-
tative has taken an active part in the discus-
sion, I should be glad if he also were a member
of the Sub-Committee.
The President
Translation : I quite agree with M. El
Guindy, but would point out that the Sub-
Committee will be somewhat large. With the Bel-
gian representative, there will be nine members.
However, I accept M. El Guindy?s proposal.


I venture to make the following suggestions
to the Sub-Committee ;
(i) Its work should, of course, be based
on M. Perrot?s observations.
(2) The work of the Second Conference
is well advanced, and I would urge the
members of the Sub-Committee to do their
utmost to reach a unanimous agreement
and to submit to us a unanimous report.
The Sub-Committee should meet as soon as
possible. I cannot say how much time it will
have for its work, but I shall make arrangements
with the Chairman, when elected, to give it
ample time.
M. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : I propose M. Perrot as Chair-
man of the Sub-Committee.
The President
Translation : If you so desire, I am ready
to arrange for these appointments now, but
you might perhaps make your suggestions at
the close of the present meeting. (Assent.)
97. FIRST READING OF THE DRAFT
CONVENTION ARTICLES 1-7.
CONTINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
Article 1 (Continuation of the Discussion).
Definitions of Morphine, Coca Leaf, Cocaine
and Crude Cocaine.
The President
Translation : We have now to continue
our discussion of the draft Convention. At
the twenty-ninth meeting we closed the dis-
cussion, I believe, at the definition of morphine
in Article 1.
The definition of morphine, coca leaf, cocaine
and crude cocaine were read as follows :
?Morphine. ?Morphine? means the
principal alkaloid of opium having the
chemical formula C l 7 H 19 N0 3 .
?Coca Leaf. ?Coca leaf? means the
leaf of Erythroxylon coca (Lamarck) and
the Erythroxylon novogranatense (Morris)
hieronymus and their varieties of the family
of erythroxylaceoe and the leaf of other
species of this genus from which it may be
found possible to extract cocaine either
directly or by chemical transformation.
?Any other vegetable raw material which
may serve for the preparation of cocaine
will be considered as equivalent to coca
leaves.
?Cocaine. ?Cocaine? means methyl-
benzoyl laevo-eegonine (alpha U. 20 0 =
i6�4 in 20-per-cent solution of chloroform),
of which the formula is C l 7 H 21 N0 4 .
?Crude Cocaine. ?Crude cocaine? means
any extract of the coca leaf which can be
used directly or indirectly for the manufac-
ture of cocaine.?
The President
Translation : The subject is now open for
discussion. Does anyone wish to speak ?
M. van Wettum, delegate of the Netherlands,
will address the Conference.
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands)
I want to ask for information about the
second paragraph, regarding the definition
of ?coca leaf?'. It seems to me that the second
paragraph is rather vague. Also I want to
ask, for my own information, why we do not
deal with this question in the same way as
under Article 10 we deal with any new narcotic
drug.
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : Sub-Committee F adopted
this term because, at present, the coca leaf is
the only known substance which yields cocaine ;
but, just as cafeine is produced from plants
which belong to a number of vegetable families
of widely differing kinds, it is quite possible
that the raw material which will yield cocaine
may one day be discovered.
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
At what period will the vegetable raw material
be considered as equivalent to coca leaves ?
Will it be found in one or two countries and
what international body will decide with regard
to it ? All this seems to me to be rather vague.
For instance, if we are ultimately able to make
cocaine from chestnut leaves and if it is so made
in one country, will the matter be decided
according the terms of the Convention or not ?
IVI. Perrot (France)
Translation : In reply to M. van Wettum?s
first question, I would suggest from the date
on which cocaine is extracted from any new
vegetable substance. I think that is the view
the Conference will take.
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
I still do not feel quite satisfied. There are
many vegetable materials from which it may
be possible to extract cocaine. It seems to me
that an international body or some organisa-
tion of that kind must decide the question.
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : As far as I can see, the only
means of meeting M. van Wettum?s views
would be to add the word ?industrial?
before ?preparation?.
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands)
The only point I want to make clear is that,
under the terms of the Convention, the question
must be decided by some organisation. A decision
on the part of one only is not sufficient. Why
do we not deal with this matter in the same way
as Article 10 ?
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : I do not quite see M. van
Wettum?s objection. It does not seem to me
that there is any difficulty. Cocaine either is
or is not prepared from such-and-such a vege-
table. In Article 10 we have referred to the
Office international d?Hygiene publique because
differences of opinion may arise, but this is
not the case as regards cocaine. If a new
plant is found to yield cocaine, no difficulty
will arise, for it will come within the scope of
this provision simply because it does produce
cocaine.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
May 1 give a concrete example ? Suppose
that cocaine can be extracted from tobacco
leaves. Will tobacco leaves be brought under
the terms of the Convention ? That is the
only point on which I ask for an explanation,
as it seems to me to be rather vague.


IVI. Perrot (France)
Translation : From a technical point of
view they certainly would.
The President
Translation : Ido not think we can conti-
nue to discuss this point. Is M. van Wettum
satisfied ?
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
I do not feel satisfied, but I must accept
The President
Translation : The point will be noted in the
record of the meeting.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
Cannot we suppress altogether the last para-
graph of the definition of coca leaves ? It is
very clear that if somebody in the future finds
a vegetable from which cocaine can be extracted,
it will be brought under the Convention.
Cocaine is already dealt with by the Convention.
I formally move therefore that we strike
out this second paragraph.
IVI. Perrot (France)
Translation : The President and the Rap-
porteur of the Sub-Committee do not see any
objection to this proposal.
The President
Translation : If the Conference agrees, the
last three lines of the definition of coca leaves
will be omitted. (Agreed.)
We shall now pass to the next three defini-
tions.
Definitions of Ecgonine, Diacetylmorphine and
Indian Hemp.
The definitions of ecgonine, diacetylmorphine
and Indian hemp were read as follows :
?Ecgonine. ?Ecgonine? means lsevo-
ecgonine (alpha D.20 0 = 45�6 in 5-per-
cent solution of water), of which the for-
mula is C9FC503N03H20 considered as
raw material, and all the derivatives of
lsevo-ecgonine, which might serve indus-
trially for its recovery.
?Diacetylmorphine. ?Diacetylmorphine?
means diacetylmorphine (diamorphine, he-
roin), having the formula C 2 iH 23 N05.
?Indian Hemp. 'lndian hemp? means
the dried flowering or fruiting tops of the
pistillate plant Cannibas saliva L. from
which the resin has not been extracted,
under whatever name they may be desig-
nated in commerce.?
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
May I ask whether the words ?considered as
raw material? may be struck out of the defi-
nition of ecgonine ? Ido not understand what
they mean.
IVI. Perrot (France)
Translation : That is impossible, 1 think,
because ecgonine is not a narcotic and cannot
as such come under the scope of the Convention.
On the other hand, it is a raw material for the
manufacture of cocaine.
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
I still cannot quite follow what has been
said by the honourable delegate of France.
Ecgonine is considered as a raw material and
cocaine is not considered as a raw material.
Is there some difference ?
IVI. Perrot (France)
Translation : Lsevo-ecgonine alone, and not
recto-ecgonine, yields cocaine.
Sir IVlalcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
I am not sure that the French delegate has
answered M. van Wettum?s question. M. van
Wettum has asked why the words ?considered
as raw material? appear in the definition of
ecgonine and M. Perrot has replied that they
are inserted because ecgonine is not itself a
stupefiant, but is a raw material for the
manufacture of a stupefiant.
Am I right in understanding M. Perrot in
that sense ? If so, why is ecgonine inserted
in Article 4 among the dangerous drugs, among
the stupe fiants ? On the recommendation of
Sub-Committee F, we applied all the provisions
relating to the control of stupefiants to ecgo-
nine, so that there would appear to be a slight
inconsistency in M. Perrot?s explanation and
I should be glad if he would explain further.
IVI. Perrot (France)
Translation : In dealing with morphine,
we must mention opium, because it is a material
from which morphine is manufactured. We
include opium in the Convention because it
is itself a narcotic and is also a raw material
used for the production of other narcotics ;
if we do not class ecgonine as a raw material,
we could not bring it into the Convention at all.
The whole cocaine industry is dealt with in
Chapter 111, and consequently I do not see
how we could omit any mention of ecgonine.
Sir IVlalcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
I agree as regards the necessity of including
ecgonine. That is not the point that is in
dispute. As far as Great Britain is concerned,
we did that three years ago. The only ques-
tion is whether the words ?considered as raw
material? are necessary in the text or not.
I am inclined, after hearing the explanation of
M. Perrot, to agree with M. van Wettum that
they are unnecessary. They seem to add no-
thing to the definition of ecgonine. In order
to prevent any possibility of doubt, I suggest
that it would be the better course to omit them.
I therefore propose, if the Rapporteur sees
no objection, to omit the words ?considered
as raw material?.
IVI. Perrot (France) :
Translation : I see no objection to the omis-
sion of these words. Sub-Committee F merely
inserted them to show the point of view from
which it regarded ecgonine. I feel bound to
say, in defence of the Sub-Committee?s methods,
that none of the experts would have thought
of adding these words. As everyone is now
clear on this point, there is no need to keep
them in the Convention.
The President
Translation : Since all the members of
Sub-Committee F agree to the omission of the
words ?considered as raw material?, I think
the Conference might adopt this proposal.
(Adopted.)
Have any members any other observations
to make on ecgonine or Indian hemp ?


IVI. Cam ere (Switzerland)
Translation : I have a small observation
to make on a point of drafting. The Drafting
Committee, in drawing up the list of products,
has not, I think, adopted a very logical se-
quence. The products are arranged somewhat
unsystematically, and the list should, in my
view, be drawn up as follows :
Raw opium, medicinal opium, opium, mor-
phine, diacetylmorphine, crude cocaine, cocaine,
ecgonine.
Definition of Medicinal Opium.
The President
Translation : M. Perrot, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
IVI. Perrot (France)
Translation : I will submit to you the
definition of medicinal opium adopted by the
Sub-Committee, which was held over at the
twenty-ninth meeting. The text, slightly
amended by the Sub-Committee at the instance
of the Netherlands delegate, reads as follows :
?Medicinal opium shall be taken to mean
raw opium which has undergone the
processes necessary to render it fit for medi-
cinal use, whether in powder form or granul-
ated or otherwise, or mixed with neutral
materials, provided its morphine content
corresponds to the prescriptions of the
pharmacopoeia. ? ?
This definition requires some explanation. The
text of the Hague Convention has been changed
because it was inaccurate and even reproduced
some of the mistakes still existing in certain
pharmacopoeias. We took the view that, in
an international convention, we need not
trouble about the precise definitions in phar-
macopoeias, as the latter provide a definition
of medicinal opium for each individual country.
It was thought preferable to have a definition
of medicinal opium which would be generally
applicable and would take into account the
prescriptions of recognised pharmacopoeias.
For example, the proportion of morphine
(10 per cent) mentioned in the Hague Conven-
tion of 1912 does not apply to the United States,
where the normal proportion is 9.5 per cent.
It was thus very difficult to fix a percentage of
morphine in a general definition of medicinal
opium for the purpose of a convention such as
the present one.
It was necessary to define opium because if,
for example, raw opium containing 6 per cent
of morphine is mixed in suitable proportions
with opium containing 17 per cent, a mixture
containing 10 per cent could be obtained; this
is opium which has been submitted to manipu-
lations and thereby becomes a medicinal opium.
Then again, if opium containing 12 per cent is
added to ?neutral materials? in order to reduce
the proportion of morphine to 10 per cent, this
is another manipulation which also produces
medicinal opium.
All these forms of manipulation come under
the definition we propose to-day, which is more
logical than the previous one.
The President
Translation : The Drafting Committee will
note the various observations which have been
made. The discussion on Chapter lis closed,
and we now pass to Chapter 11.
Chapter II ; Internal Control of Raw
Opium and Coca Leaves.
Article 2.
The text of Article 2 was read as follows :
?The Contracting Parties shall enact
effective laws and regulations for the control
of the production and distribution of raw
opium, unless laws or regulations on the
subject are already in existence.?
The President
Translation : At our meeting the day
before yesterday, we spoke of the ?first reading?
of Article 2, but what we were really discussing
was a part of the report of Sub-Committee B
which had been reserved, and Article 2 is only
coming up for ?first reading? to-day.
You will remember that, in the course of the
discussion the day before yesterday, we accepted
the American proposal with two modifica-
tions and an addition suggested as an addendum
to the Egyptian proposal.
The discussion on Article 2 is now open, and
I call upon M. Sjostrand, delegate of Sweden,
ot speak.
IVI. Sjostrand (Sweden) :
When a vote was taken at the twenty-ninth
meeting upon the addition to the Egyptian
proposal regarding Article 2, there were no
fewer than fourteen abstentions. The whole
of Article 2 was adopted with nine abstentions.
I think the distinguished delegate for Japan
interpreted rightly the feelings of many dele-
gates when he expressed some doubt as to
whether we were not weakening to some extent
the obligations contained in the present Article 1
of the Hague Convention by accepting the addi-
tion. As you will remember, the addition
allowed any Contracting Power to declare that it
only accepted the American principle subject
to certain limitations.
Of course, I do not say that it ever entered
into the minds of the authors of the additional
proposal to weaken the Hague Convention.
That would, I believe, have been contrary to the
mandate given by the League. But, by open-
ing the door for reservations, it might be
contended that we had shifted the ground and
made it possible to slip away from the obliga-
tions contained in the present Article 1. It is
true that, on the one hand, we have strengthened
considerably the actual provisions by accepting
the American principle, but, on the other hand,
it has been made possible for any interested
Power to declare a limited acceptance of this
principle, without laying down the extent of
such a limitation. It has therefore occurred to
me that it could be expressly stated that such
a declaration may not encroach upon the obli-
gations contained in Article 1 of the Hague
Convention, so that these obligations shall be
upheld in the letter and in the spirit.
If such a proposal were accepted, I venture to
say that we should at least have made some
progress. It is true that we do not know
exactly to what extent the Powers concerned
will avail themselves of their right to declare
a limited acceptance of the American principle.
But their power of reserve will not be unlimited.
They cannot go back upon their obligations
in virtue of Article 1 of the Hague Convention.
The door will be closed upon any retrograde


step, but the road will be open for any pro-
gressive measure. The Powers will be invited
to comply as nearly as possible with the
principle for which we are all working and, once
undertaken, such an obligation will, we may
hope, act as a stimulus for further progress.
The drafting of this amendment may not be
quite perfect, but we can, of course, refer the
proposal to the Drafting Committee, so that
the whole article may be put into better shape.
If there is any other proposal which serves
the same purpose I shall, of course, be quite
willing to take it into consideration.
I therefore beg to move the following amend-
ment to Article 2 of the draft Convention ;
?Such limitations shall not in any case
render the obligations accepted under this
article by the Contracting Party concerned
less extensive than those prescribed by
Article 1 of The Hague Convention of
1912.?
The President
Translation : The discussion is open on
Article 2 of the draft Convention.
Mr. Clayton, delegate of India, will address
the Conference.
M. Clayton (India) :
On behalf of the Indian delegation, I desire
to accept the amendment proposed by the
Swedish delegation. I think it affords a very
satisfactory solution of a question which has
occupied this Conference, and also Sub-Com-
mittee B, for a very long time.
Two regimes were presented to Sub-Com-
mittee B. The first was the regime under which
the producing countries have been living since
the Hague Convention was signed ; the second,
the new regime which the United States desired
to put forward for adoption by the various
producing countries. I understand that a
large number of the consuming countries were
very anxious that the United States point of
view should be adopted. There were lengthy
discussions on the point. One producing coun-
try was prepared to go as far as the United
States regime, and I do not think any producing
country desired to recede from its position under
the Hague Convention.
I admit that our discussions and the results
of the twenty-ninth meeting left the question
of the regime under which each country w r ould
come in some uncertainty. I rejoice that that
uncertainty has now been removed. It is
now clear that countries can either remain
under the regime of the Hague Convention, or
they can advance (if they consider it an advance)
to the regime proposed by the United States ;
or, if they like, they can adopt any interme-
diate stage which they desire.
If this proposal is accepted, all parties in this
Conference should, I think, be satisfied. Com-
plete liberty is given to each producing country
to make its choice, and we know the limits
within which that choice may be made. I
desire to second the adoption of this amend-
ment.
The President
Translation : M. El Guindy, delegate of
Egypt, will address the Conference.
M. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : When I supported the first
article of the United States suggestions, I
understood that, under the terms of the article,
the production of opium would not be stopped
immediately the Convention came into force,
but that a time-limit would be allowed. As,
however, the amendment subsequently pro-
posed completely invalidated this first article
of the United States suggestions and prac-
tically meant that it would be suppressed, I
consider that this article should be retained,
with perhaps some time-limit, or definition
fixing a time-limit, which the Conference could
accept ; if not, I propose that the whole
article be deleted and replaced by a new article
which would be an improvement on the article
in the Hague Convention.
The President
Translation : I shall be glad if the first dele-
gate of Egypt will place his proposals in writing.
The discussion on the Swedish amendment to
Article 2 will be continued.
Mr. Riddell, delegate of Canada, will address
the Conference.
Mr. Riddell (Canada) :
I have much pleasure in supporting the amend-
ment which has been moved by the Swedish
delegate. In voting the other day in support
of the amendment to the original American
proposal, I did so thinking that certainly no
limitation would be made that did not fully
carry out the obligations under the Hague Con-
vention, and the obligations of which were not
quite as extensive as those assumed in the
Hague Convention.
I voted in favour of it, but not because I
believed, or that my country believed, that it
is what we wanted. We have heard a lot
about idealism. So far as the opium traffic is
concerned, I consider that I represent one of the
most idealistic countries. We make not one
dollar from the production or manufacture of
opium ; all we ask is the minimum for our
medical and scientific requirements.
That being the case, I would like to have
pressed for the maximum that we might have
obtained, but one of the traditions of my coun-
try is that we always recognise the rights of
others. Within our Confederation we recognise
the rights of the different Provinces. My
country has played a great part in the develop-
ment of the British community of nations, laying
down those fundamental principles of legisla-
tive autonomy, of equality and of unanimity,
those principles which, after all, came from
the British community of nations into the
League of Nations, under whose auspices we
meet this afternoon.
I felt, therefore, that the only thing that
could be done was to support that amendment,
notwithstanding that it implied all that the
Swedish delegate has now summed up in his
amendment.
After all, the Hague Convention has been
our Magna Charta for protection from the
menace of the drug traffic, and I would be the
last one to want to do anything that would
reduce, even in the slightest degree, its power
and effect. 1 shall have much pleasure, there-
fore, in supporting the amendment when it
is put to the vote.
The President
Translation. M. Yovanovitch, delegate of the


M. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation : I accept the amendment pro-
posed by the Swedish delegation, and would add
that I could not accept any other. We have
been discussing this question for a long time,
and after many difficulties have at "length
reached agreement. Do not let us now run the
risk of destroying this agreement.
The President
Translation : M. Dinichert, delegate of
Switzerland, will address the Conference.
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Iranslation : The remark just made by
M. Yovanovitch gives me food for reflection.
It appears to me that we are to-day exactly
where we were two days ago, and that now,
as then, we have to find a formula to express
an engagement regarding which we are nearly
all in agreement.
The day before yesterday we found a formula,
to which the producing countries agreed a
condition which in my view is the essential and
fundamental one. This fact should reassure
M. Yovanovitch ; and yet to-day the formula
which we accepted the day before yesterday
is found to be open to criticism, and you want
to amend it once more.
What is the position ?
We have accepted in principle what we call
Article i of the United States suggestions, and
in this connection the producing countries,
above all, have intimated that they must make
a reservation. The purport of this reservation
is as follows :
?Further, any Contracting Party may
declare, at the time of its signature of, or
accession to, the present Convention, the
limitations subject to which it accepts this
article as regards the production and dis-
tribution of raw opium.?
The reservation admitted as regards the pro-
duction and distribution of raw opium was
then found to be applicable even to Article i
of the Hague Convention, which only makes
provision for the control of the production and
distribution of raw opium. This fact having
been noted, a new reservation to the first reser-
vation was made, thereby undoing what had
been done.
We had found a formula acceptable to all the
producing countries. That being so, I was
quite ready to accept it, and if I make a fresh
proposal now it is merely in an endeavour to
find a simpler formula expressing the same idea.
I suggest therefore that, in the reservation which
was accepted two days ago, it should not be
said that the Contracting Powers are able to
make reservations as regards the production
and distribution of raw opium (which is the
subject of Article i of the Hague Convention
itself) but only in regard to the ?limitation of
production for other than strictly medical and
scientific purposes?, which is the only new
factor introduced by Article i of the United
States suggestions. That is the whole point.
For my own part, I repeat that I will accept
any formula to which the producing countries
will agree ; I simply ask you to compare the
two formulae and adopt whichever is the simpler.
Translation : We have now a fresh proposal,
submitted by M. Dinichert, to omit the words
?the production and distribution of raw opium?
from the fourth and fifth lines of the addition
to the Egyptian proposal and to substitute for
them the words ?limitation of production for
other than strictly medical and scientific pur-
poses?.
In these circumstances, the Swedish proposal
no longer holds.
This amendment is now open for discussion.
M. Toivola, delegate of Finland, will address
the Conference.
IVI. Toivola (Finland)
Mr. President I think you will agree with
me when I say that we have certainly got into
a mess with all these amendments, contra-
amendments and super-amendments. We have
the original text ; we have the United States
suggestions, and we have the amendments to
those suggestions. We have another amend-
ment to the amendment to those suggestions,
and we have the new Swiss amendment. It
is very difficult to know where we are.
I should think that the words spoken yes-
terday or the day before by the honourable
delegate for Japan were quite right that we
really do not know whether we are weakening
the Hague Convention or not. My view is
that all these amendments are weakening the
Hague Convention, and I agree with my Egyp-
tian friend when he suggested that we should
retain as our base the Hague Convention
that there should be no amendments, but that
we should adopt only the article which already
exists in that Convention.
Article i of the Hague Convention says
?The Contracting Powers shall enact
effective laws or regulations for the control
of the production and distribution of raw
opium, unless laws or regulations on the
subject are already in existence.?
I do not think that any amendment we can
adopt now would take us further than that, and
I propose that we maintain that text.
Mehmed Sureya Bey (Turkey) :
Translation : I second M. Toivola?s sugges-
tion. We are all agreed as regards Article i
of the Hague Convention, whereas reservations
have been made in regard to Article i of the
United States suggestions.
The President :
Translation : I think M. Toivola?s proposal
is.similar to that submitted by the French dele-
gation the other day.
I beg to inform the Conference that M. El
Guindy, the Egyptian delegate, has just sub-
mitted the two following proposals :
?That the Conference should either :
?(i) Accept Article iof the United States
suggestions as formulated by the Egyptian
delegation, with the explanation that
the necessary control would only be rigo-
rously applied after the expiration of
a time-limit to be fixed by the Conference ;
or
?(2) Delete the article altogether and
substitute for it another to be drawn up
by the Conference.?


I cannot, at the first reading of the draft
Convention, submit to the Conference two pro-
posals which are not clearly defined. This would
be possible in Committee, but at a plenary
meeting of the Conference proposals must be
quite definite.
M. Kircher, delegate of France, will address
the Conference.
IV!. Kircher (France) :
Translation : Yesterday, the Conference
enthusiastically adopted Article 1 of the United
States suggestions, which represents the utmost
efforts humanity could make to bring about,
thoroughly, progressively and finally, the abo-
lition of opium. Then, perceiving immediately
afterwards that, for political, economic, agrarian
and social reasons, such measures could not
be carried out by the producing countries, the
Conference proceeded to pass an amendment
which rendered entirely nugatory the very
article it had just adopted, since, by the terms
of the amendment, producing countries could
reserve the right not to apply the first para-
graph of Article 1 of the American suggestions
which those very Powers had just adopted.
Thus the Conference, unanimously recognising
that the producing countries could not carry
out what they had undertaken, took cognisance
in advance of reservations which those countries
would certainly not fail to make, and declared
forthwith that these reservations would be
accepted.
The upshot of all these contradictory deci-
sions is a truly paradoxical position. On
the one hand, the Conference agreed that we
must abolish hie et nunc the production of
all opium not required for medical or scientific
purposes ; on the other, it decided that the
producing countries had the right to absolve
themselves from this obligation. Finally, all
agreed that these countries should not fulfil
the obligation at all.
The position was paradoxical indeed, and, after
48 hours? reflection, a fresh amendment was
submitted to us. Now, what is the net result
of the Conference?s decisions ? That we have
simply reverted to Article 1 of the Convention
of 1912, namely, that ?the Contracting Powers
shall enact effective laws and regulations for
the control of the production and distribution
of raw opium??. That was, for all practical
purposes, the outcome of the whole of the
day before yesterday?s meeting.
Nay, more : we have gone even further and
have greatly weakened Article 1. The limi-
tations which will be imposed and which are
accepted in advance by the Conference prac-
tically nullify the undertakings which the
Powers signed some ten years ago.
Accordingly, the Swedish delegate proposes
an amendment to the effect that the limitations
accepted by the Conference in advance shall
in no case render the obligations accepted by
the producing countries less extensive.
Is it, I ask, worthy of a Conference such as
this to embody such contradictory clauses in
a document which will be broadcast throughout
the world ?
Would it not be better to adopt the Finnish
delegate?s proposal and revert to the text of
the Hague Convention itself, or else, if we wish
to fulfil the American ideal, which we all res-
pect and share, could we not say that the Con-
tracting Powers will strengthen the laws and
regulations which they have already agreed
to issue in virtue of the Hague Convention in
order to ensure the control of the production,
distribution and export of raw opium ? Either of
these alternatives would, I am sure, be more
suitable than that adopted the day before
yesterday, even if amended as the Swedish
delegation proposes. Such a solution could
not satisfy any Conference which desired to
accomplish something rational and practi-
cable.
Our view is that we should either adopt the
text of the Hague Convention, which I think
would satisfy the producing countries, or,
if we wish to go a step further towards the
fulfilment of our ideal, to say :
?The Contracting Parties undertake to
strengthen the laws and regulations which
they have adopted in virtue of the Hague
Convention of 1912 in order to ensure
the control of the production, distribution
and export of raw opium/'
If we do this, we shall achieve something
really worthy of this Conference. ( Loud applause.)
The President
Translation : M. El Guindy, delegate of
Egypt, will address the Conference.
ML El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : This article was discussed
first of all by the Sub-Committee, which could
not agree either to approve or to reject it.
Consequently, we have had to consider it
again in plenary meeting and to endeavour to
find a form of words which would make it
acceptable, or to replace it by something else.
It was for this reason that I made my proposal.
I now see that my suggestion, which appeared
somewhat hazardous and perhaps not entirely
in order, is quite feasible and has taken prac-
tical shape in the proposal put forward by
the French delegate. This formula is, I think,
one which we can accept.
The President
Translation : I hope the Egyptian dele-
gate understands my meaning. We can only
discuss proposed amendments if they are sent
in to the President in writing. The French
delegate has done so, and accordingly 1 can
submit his amendment for discussion ; but
I can hardly put before the Conference an
amendment which has not been so submitted.
Ml. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) ;
Translation : I accept the French delegate?s
proposal.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : As the French delegate has
clearly explained, the Conference now finds,
after forty-eight hours? reflection, that it cannot
accept the formula upon which we had agreed.
On the other hand, we cannot delete Article
2 altogether ; we must substitute something
for it because, as we state elsewhere, its pro-
visions are intended to supplement those of
Chapter I of the Hague Convention.
I therefore think that the formula suggested
by the French delegate is in every way suitable,
and I congratulate him ; it is one which I
believe we can all accept. I refer to the second


proposal, beginning : ?The Contracting Powers
undertake to strengthen...?.
1 accept this second proposal as submitted
by M. Kircher.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will! address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
Mr. President There seems to be a conside-
rable amount of support for the proposal that
has just been made by the French delegate, but
1 find that 1 am unable to share the favourable
opinion which a number of delegates seem to
entertain in regard to it.
If I understood it rightly, the French pro-
posal was to substitute for the opening words
of Article i of the Convention a phrase somewhat
to this effect : ?The Contracting Parties will
undertake to strengthen their laws for the
control of the production and distribution of
raw opium?.
What does Article i of the Hague Convention
say ? It says that the Contracting Parties
shall enact effective laws or regulations for
the control of the production and distribution
of raw opium. Now, if the Signatory States
have discharged their obligations under that
article, they have already enacted effective
laws. The French proposition can only mean
that they undertake a further obligation to
enact more effective laws. What does that
mean ? If laws are effective for the object
for which they have been enacted, how can
they be made more effective ?
The word ?effective? implies that the laws
are sufficient to carry out the obligation which
is imposed by Article i of the Hague Convention,
and it seems to me that we should be reducing
our proceedings to something of an absurdity
if this Conference were to insert in the new Con-
vention a provision to the effect that the Con-
tracting Parties are to strengthen their laws
or make them more effective.
I could understand such a proposition if
we added, as the United States delegation pro-
posed to add, a further object for the laws and
regulations to be enacted under Article i.
The United States delegation proposed that
the laws and regulations should be such as to
limit the production to the amount necessary
for medical and scientific purposes ; but those
words are not, as I understand, to be inserted
in the clause proposed by the French delega-
tion and the clause will remain, in alles sentials,
as it is at present in the Hague Convention
with the addition of the word ?strengthen?.
That seems to me, if I may say so with great
respect, to be useless and, to borrow M.
Kircher?s own words, to be unworthy of this
Conference.
I fancy that the whole Conference is agreed
that we must maintain the existing provision
in the Hague Convention. There is no ques-
tion of going back upon that. That was the
object, as I understand it, of the Swedish
amendment. But at the meeting of the Sub-
Committee which you appointed the other day,
the producing countries agreed to go a little
further. They agreed to go some way along
the road towards the attainment of the ideal
which was set before us in the suggestions of
the American delegation. It was found, how-
ever, that all the producing countries could not
go the whole way and it was therefore agreed
that power should be reserved to any country
to make such limitations in its acceptance
of the article as it found to be necessary in
the circumstances of its own case.
I respectfully suggest to the Conference that
we should attempt to preserve what was gained
the other day in the meeting of the Sub-Com-
mittee and I would put my suggestion in this
concrete form that we should begin by re-
enacting Article i of the Hague Convention, as
to which we are all agreed, and that, in the
second place, we should provide that the control
of the production and distribution to be under-
taken in pursuance of Article i of the Hague
Convention shall be such that there shall be
no surplus available for purposes other than
medical and scientific purposes, but that, as
was agreed the other day in the Sub-Committee,
any Contracting Party may declare at the time
of its signature to what extent it accepts that
further obligation.
In this way we should retain, in the first
place, the full provisions of Article i of the
Hague Convention and, in the second place,
those countries which feel that they can go
further and there are a number of producing
countries in that position would accept the
further obligation to restrict it in a greater
or less degree to medical and scientific purposes.
I do ask that what was gained the other day
in the Sub-Committee should not be lost and
that we should try to find some form of words
which will combine both the preservation of
Article i of the Hague Convention and the pre-
servation of what was gained the other day
in the Sub-Committee.
It is very difficult to discuss questions of
this sort in a full meeting of the Conference ;
but I think that it would not be difficult, if
the Conference would decide to refer the ques-
tion to the Drafting Committee, for that Com-
mittee to arrive at something which would be
generally acceptable. If the Conference so
decided to refer the matter to the Drafting
Committee to prepare a text, that Committee
might, when considering this matter, call in
for consultation those delegates who have taken
a leading part in the discussion.
I can see no other way out of the difficulty.
We have already six or seven amendments
before us. To sort them out and take a vote
upon them would be an extremely compli-
cated matter. I hope that the Conference
will not think that 1 am unreasonable in sug-
gesting that this matter should be referred to
the Drafting Committee for consideration on
the lines that I have suggested.
Mehmed Sureya Bey (Turkey) :
Translation : I think the question before
us is quite clear, and I second the French dele-
gate?s proposal.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Kircher, dele-
gate of France, to speak.
M. Kircher (France)
Translation : I should like to reply very
briefly to Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s observa-
tions. The British delegate is surprised that
we should propose to strengthen measures
which have not proved successful. I, in my


turn, am surprised at his remark. Surely, if
the measures taken by the Governments since
1912 had been successful, we should not be
here, since the obligations we entered into in
1912 included the suppression of production
for all illicit purposes.
Yet in the three months we have spent at
Geneva we have discovered that, despite the
very evident goodwill of those countries which
grow the opium poppy, the results anticipated
in 1912 have not been attained.
As you are aware, there are some countries in
which the opium poppy is grown on a large
scale. Many countries are producers of opium,
and the measures they have taken have not
been successful ; that is, unfortunately, a fact
which we are obliged to recognise.
When, however, it is found that the measures
taken for the last thirteen years have not
had the results which were expected of them,
those measures must be strengthened. That
is the reason why my proposal appears to have
been accepted in substance by the large majo-
rity of the Conference. Moreover, in making
this proposal, we are inspired by a sense of
dignity and of international justice, because we
all recognise that these producing countries
deserve our sympathy. That is a point which
I feel I must emphasise.
The great country, with its 450 million inha-
bitants, which is our neighbour in Indo-China,
is passing through a period of turmoil, which
calls for all our compassion and sympathy.
Unfortunately, we cannot at the moment
insist upon her taking such measures as we
would wish to bring about the immediate aboli-
tion of the use of opium. China cannot, if
she would, take effective steps at the present
time.
Other countries in the Near East, and in
Europe, too, cultivate the poppy, and we cannot
at a moment?s notice deprive of their livelihood
the peasants who cultivate it. The Govern-
ments concerned can nevertheless at any rate
take steps, in pursuance of the Hague Conven-
tion, to bring nearer the end we all have in
view, the ideal not only of Europe but of America
and Asia also the suppression of the use
of opium.
Those Governments which have already taken
steps should to-day undertake to go further.
This, then contrary to what Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne seems to think would not be a retro-
cession, but an advance. We have no desire
to weaken the Hague Convention ; we wish
to strengthen the principle upon which it is
based and to advance further along the road
towards the common goal. If we adopt the
form of words which I have proposed, we shall
at any rate be making progress.
The form of words which Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne proposes is I hope he will forgive
me for saying so not very clear. I cannot
quite see what is meant by the ?surplus? of
a production intended for other than medical
or scientific purposes. This point raises anew
the great problem of the quantities necessary
for legitimate use.
How can we avoid this mix-up ? The form
of words we proposed, which is accepted in
principle by the chief countries concerned, has
the great advantage of being clear and precise.
Instead of referring this proposal to the
Drafting Committee, which, in our opinion,
cannot deal with it unless it is accepted in prim
ciple and in its general outlines by the Confe-
rence, it would be better to take a vote and see
whether the French delegation?s views are
shared by a sufficient majority. I repeat, the
object of our proposal is to meet the views of
the producing countries as well as those of the
countries whose ideal is to see the cultivation of
the opium poppy brought to an end.
The President :
Translation : I must apologise to the first
delegate of the Irish Free State, whose name
I have missed on my list. I call upon him
to speak.
Mr. Michael Mac White (Irish Free State) :
I want to tell you how deeply moved I am
after listening to the discussion this afternoon.
The other day, when I was the only one who
voted against the addendum to the United
States proposal (and I did so because I saw
that, if it were adopted, it would tear in pieces
the Convention of The Hague), I was as one
crying in the wilderness. I am happy to see
that, after forty-eight hours? reflection and two
nights? sleep, the rest of my colleagues seem to
have come round to my way of thinking. I
am indeed deeply flattered. It is a sign that,
after three months? discussion, we are beginning
to see light. I confess I was pessimistic until
this afternoon, but, after what I have now
heard, I have hopes that this Conference will
finish its work before the end of the Year of
Grace 1925.
The other day we adopted the first part of
the American proposal practically unanimously.
I think the only difficulty we have now is
with regard to the addendum which was also
adopted on that day. I should like to suggest
that we agree to delete the addendum, and that
the American proposal should stand. I make
that suggestion in order to clarify the discus-
sion, which seems to have become somewhat
mixed ; the more we discuss, the deeper we
seem to get in the mire.
At the same time, I do not make a formal
proposal. I would agree that the proposals
we have before us be referred to a Drafting
Committee, because, if we continue discussing
the matter here, we shall never arrive at a
solution.
The President
Translation : M. Dendramis, delegate of
Greece, will address the Conference.
M. Dendramis (Greece)
Translation : I accept the French proposal
in toto, and I ask that it be put to the vote
when the discussion is closed.
The President
Translation : Mr. Clayton, delegate of India,
will address the Conference.
Mr. Clayton (India)
The Indian delegation is prepared to accept
the French proposal. I am not quite sure
about the wording of .it in English, but we shall
be able to see that when it returns from the
Drafting Committee. So far as the principle
is concerned, I see no reason why I should not
give it my support.


Translation : I call upon M. Sjostrand,
delegate of Sweden, to speak.
IVI. Sjostrand (Sweden)
In order to simplify the question, which
seems, perhaps, rather confused to some minds,
I beg to announce that I am willing to agree
with Sir Malcolm Delevingne, because I find,
on close investigation, that his proposal is the
same as mine.
I could not agree with the French proposal,
because I think that, by accepting it, we should
be sacrificing very valuable progress which
we made the day before yesterday, when we
introduced the American principles into our
Convention. I think that decision, which was
the result of three months? very serious work
here, was a real gain. If we are going to sacri-
fice it now, I do not think we shall have made
much progress.
I cannot see that the French proposal leads
us very far, because it says we are to strengthen
measures which are declared to be effective
in the Hague Convention ; in spite of that,
we say we are going to fortify them. It is
difficult to see what that means.
On the other hand, we have the American
proposals clearly stated, and we say that we agree
in principle with them ; we will, however,
allow certain Powers to make reservations, but
their reservations must never go further than
the limits already laid down in Article i of the
Hague Convention. Consequently, by doing
this, we have drawn up two limits within which
the Powers can move. I think that this is
a much better plan than the one provided in
the French proposal.
The President :
Translation : Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh, dele-
gate of Persia, will address the Conference.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia)
Translation : I accept the French proposal
provisionally, pending the Drafting Committee?s
decision on our memorandum.
The President
Translation : Mr. Riddell, delegate of Canada,
will address the Conference.
Mr. Riddell (Canada)
I have listened with a great deal of interest
to the discussion on the French proposal.
I would like to be exceedingly generous, but
I cannot see any gain whatsoever in that pro-
posal. Personally, I would as soon accept the
article of the Hague Convention as it stands,
as I think it is stronger than the French amend-
ment.
I do not care whether we take Sir Malcolm
Delevingne?s proposal or the Swedish proposal.
They amount to the same thing, and that, as
I see it, is that they accept the article of the
Hague Convention, and in addition to that they
set before us the American ideal proposal
if you like to call it so the aim towards which
we are working. Those two elements are
combined. We at least get the benefit of
the goal the Americans have set before us,
and we reserve to the different producing coun-
tries the right to bring their legislation as near
as they possibly can to the American proposal,
so long as they do not restrict the meaning of
the article in the Hague Convention.
Translation : M. Kircher, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
IVI. Kircher (France):
Translation : The Swedish and Canadian
delegates have just made the gratuitous state-
ment that the adoption of the text of two days
ago constitutes a definite advance, while the
effect of the French proposal would be to retreat
once more.
I am not accustomed to deal in words. I
am a financier ; and when I draw balances, I
place the debit on one side and the credit on
the other, and with your permission I will, now
draw a balance-sheet of the article we adopted
the day before yesterday.
It is undoubtedly an enormous gain to have
embodied in the Convention the American
proposal in its entirety. Let us put that down
as a credit item of, say, a million dollars. But
now I come to the second paragraph and find
that the limitations which will be imposed by
the producing countries, and which the Confe-
rence accepts in advance, completely nullify
the effect of the first paragraph ; accordingly
I must enter them as a debit item, also amount-
ing to one million dollars.
From the gain represented by the text
adopted two days ago a million dollars ?we
must deduct a million dollars, and the result
is nil. The French proposal, on the other
hand, constitutes a real gain over the previous
position.
The measures taken by the producing coun-
tries since 1912 have not been effective that
we must regretfully admit. These countries,
however, undertake to reinforce their obliga-
tions, and this too is an enormous gain, since
it introduces a fresh obligation. If I now enter
my proposed formula in the balance-sheet,
I find I have on the credit side, not a million
dollars, of course, but at any rate a definite
sum, against which there is nothing on the
debit side. Consequently, my balance-sheet
will show a credit balance.
It is wrong, therefore, to say that by adopting
the French proposal we shall be taking a step
backward ; I maintain, indeed, that we shall
be making progress, because this proposal can
safely be accepted both by the producing coun-
tries and by those which are not themselves
concerned in the opium question.
What is the advantage of our proposal ?
That it will not give rise to any reservations
a fact which deserves consideration.
This proposal is worth considering because,
as I have already said, it probably has, if
not unanimous support, at any rate the support
of a large majority of the Conference, and it
will certainly be welcomed by all who care to
examine our intentions from the standpoint
of international equity. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : Mehmed Sureya Bey, dele-
gate of Turkey, will address the Conference.
IVlehmed Sureya Bey (Turkey)
Translation : Several delegates have explai-
ned to us this afternoon the American plan.
The American proposals resemble, if I may say
so, a vast building, in the erection of which
we were all invited to collaborate. Mr. Porter
found we were unable to do so, and left us.


It seems to me that, if we adopt Sir Malcolm
Delevingne?s proposal, we shall not be recti-
fying an existing text but adopting a new one.
1 repeat, therefore, that we cannot accept the
British proposal ; we support the French pro-
posal.
The President
Translation : M. Falcioni, delegate of Italy,
will address the Conference.
M. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : Would the French delegation
read us again the exact wording of its proposal ?
Previously, this proposal consisted of one part,
which I could not accept, but now, if I understand
aright, it contains a second part which I
think, would make it possible for me to accept it.
The French proposal was read as follows :
?The High Contracting Parties undertake
to strengthen the laws and regulations
which they have enacted in conformity with
Article i of the Hague Convention of 1912,
or to enact effective laws and regulations,
if they have not already done so, in order
to ensure the control of the production,
distribution and export of raw opium.??
The President
Translation : I call upon Mr. Shepherd,
delegate of Australia, to speak.
Mr. Shepherd (Australia) ;
I wish to support the proposal made by the
honourable delegate of the British Empire.
I must admit that I am very much confused as
to what the exact position is now. I think
the Conference is agreed that we want to retain
the terms of the Hague Convention and we want
to go as much further as it is possible to go.
There are various methods of doing this. I
am perfectly sure that the Drafting Committee
could meet the general wishes of the Confe-
rence.
I am afraid I cannot see that the French text
helps us very much, because we have in the
Hague Convention the text to ? enact effective
laws? and we propose to add that we shall
??enact more effective laws?. I presume that,
in five years? time, when the next Conference
meets, it will alter the article to say that we
shall ?enact most effective laws??. By such
stages we make very little progress. I
strongly support the proposal of the British
delegation that we should try to get a combined
draft of all the suggestions that have been put
forward.
M. Dendramis (Greece) :
Translation : I still maintain my request
that the French proposal be put to the vote,
in order that we may place on record our agree-
ment on the principles contained therein, and
that it should only then be referred to the Draft-
ing Committee.
The President
Translation : To sum up the discussion :
the first delegate of Sweden has withdrawn his
proposal. The Finnish delegate accepts the
French proposal, and accordingly his own no
longer holds good. M. Dinichert has taken up
again the idea expressed by the Swedish dele-
gate, but in a different form, and I think he
might accept the suggestion to refer the matter
to the Drafting Committee.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : For the sake of consistency
my only course is to withdraw my amendment.
I affirmed the day before yesterday, and I
repeat to-day, that I cannot vote for such a
far-reaching clause unless it is accepted by the
producing countries. Their co-operation is
absolutely essential for the realisation of the
aim before us and, if we do not consider them,
we shall make it impossible for them to accept
the Convention.
My proposal contained nothing new, but
had the merit, I think, of being clear and logical.
I had reason to believe that the producing
countries had accepted it two days ago, and I
understood from what M. Yovanovitch said
that they still accepted it ; but now that a
better form of words has been found, my proposal
is no longer necessary.
The President
Translation : The Greek delegate has sug-
gested that the French proposal be put to the
vote in order that we may place on record our
agreement on the principles contained therein,
and that it should then be referred to the Draft-
ing Committee.
The French proposal is, I think, quite in
order, and will of course be referred to the
Drafting Committee in accordance with the
rules of procedure.
We have also before us Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne?s proposal to refer to the Drafting Com-
mittee en bloc all the proposals and suggestions
which have been made, in order that the Com-
mittee may evolve a single formula embodying
all the ideas expressed by the Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
What I desire is to safeguard the results
obtained the other day by the Sub-Committee.
The President
Translation : I will take a vote first of all
on the British proposal to refer the question to
the Drafting Committee. We will then vote
on the French proposal.
(The French proposal was adopted by 17 votes.
The British proposal obtained 9 votes.)
The French proposal is referred to the Draft-
ing Committee.
I now propose to adjourn the meeting for
a quarter of an hour.
{The meeting adjourned at 5.35 p.m. and was
resumed at 6.5 p.m.)
The President
Translation : Before proceeding with our
examination of the draft Convention, I should
like to ascertain the opinion of the Conference
on our present position. The other day we
discussed Sub-Committee B?s report concerning
Article 1 of the United States suggestions
and took a vote on a certain text. At this
afternoon?s meeting, you have adopted, at the
first reading of the draft Convention, an entirely
different text. As, however, I regard the vote
taken the other day as a vote on a question
of principle only, it appears to me that the vote
we took when dealing with the final text ipso
facto annuls the previous decision. I should
like to hear the views of any members of the
Conference who think that we ought to take


a vote annulling the decision taken the other
day. For my part, I think there is a distinct
difference between the two.
M. de Palacios, delegate of Spain, will address
the Conference.
M, de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : Since no one else is speaking
on this matter, I will give you my views.
This 1 can do with complete impartiality as I did
not vote on either occasion.
After to-day?s discussion, in which constant
reference has been made to the text previously
adopted, I think we should adhere, at any rate
in principle, to to-day?s decision.
The President
Translation : I take it, then, that we need
not cancel the decision took the other day ?
(Assent.)
We will now continue the discussion of the
draft Convention.
Article 3.
The text of Article 3 was read as follows :
?Due regard being had to the differences
in their commercial conditions, the Con-
tracting Parties shall limit the number of
towns, ports or other localities through
which the export or import of raw opium
or coca leaves shall be permitted.?
The President
Translation : Article 3 is open for discus-
sion.
No observations were made and Article 3
was adopted at the first 'reading.
Chapter 111. Internal Control of Manu-
factured Drugs.
Article 4.
The text of Article 4 was read as follows :
?The provisions of the present Chapter
apply to the following substances :
?(a) Medicinal opium ;
?(6) Morphine, cocaine, diacetylmor-
phine, and their respective salts ;
?(c) Crude cocaine and ecgonine ;
?(d) All preparations (officinal and non-
officinal, including the so-called anti-opium
remedies) containing more than 0.2 per
cent of morphine or more than 0.1 per
cent of cocaine ;
?? (e) All preparations containing diacetyl-
morphine ;
(/) Any new derivatives of morphine
or cocaine, any alkaloid of opium or the
coca leaf, and any other narcotic drug to
which the present Convention may be
applied in accordance with Article 10.?
The President
Translation : Article 4 is open for discus-
sion.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
Under letter (c), should we not refer to lawo-
eegonine instead of to ecgqnine only ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I think there is no need to add ?l<evo?
because in the definition clause in Article 1,
ecgonine has been defined as meaning laevo-
ecgonine. (Assent.)
7 ranslation : Is there any other remark ?
M. Betances, delegate of the Dominican
Republic, will address the Conference.
M. Betances (Dominican Republic)
7 ranslation : During the discussion of para-
graph (/) of Article 4, by the Committee of
Experts, Surgeon-General Blue, of the United
States delegation, urged the omission of the word
?new??. At the time, neither I nor the majo-
rity of my colleagues realised the significance
of this omission, but afterwards, when I exa-
mined more closely the import of this word in
the paragraph, I found there was a very good
reason for omitting it, while the omission would
not in any way change the meaning of the para-
graph ; on the contrary, it would strengthen
it, render it more precise, and would not leave
it open to misinterpretation, as might be the
case if the word ?new? were retained.
If we say ?any new derivatives of morphine?
certain derivatives of this product which are
already known but have not hitherto been
recognised as habit-forming might escape the
terms of the Convention. Heroin, for example,
was in use long before its narcotic properties
were known, and the same is true of other
narcotics.
As a doctor, and particularly as a research
student, I would not go as far as to affirm that
substances such as dionine or codeine do not
dangerous addiction. Thus the word
?new? is not necessary to render paragraph (/)
clearer or more complete ; indeed, it might
give rise to ambiguities. I therefore venture
to request that the word ?new?, which does
not alter the meaning or affect the drafting-
of the paragraph, be omitted.
The President
Translation : The delegate of the Dominican
Republic proposes that the word ?new? in
paragraph (/) of Article 4 be omitted.
M. Perrot, delegate of France, will address
the Conference.
IVI. Perrot (France)
7 ranslation : Sub-Committee F took care-
ful note of M. Betances? observations. We
retained the word ?new? because we thought
that M. Betances? objection, although appar-
ently well founded, was not really so, since,
according to the wording, any ?new? narcotic is
automatically brought under the terms of the
Convention. All derivatives of morphine and
cocaine are mentioned by name in the Conven-
tion.
If a derivative which is already known should
subsequently be found to have narcotic pro-
perties, it would as a matter of course come
within the scope of the Convention. Later
on, we say that any ?new? product, whether
known or unknown, is covered by the Convention
as soon as it is recognised to be a narcotic.
I think Article 10 fully meets M. Betances?
requirements.
Perhaps M. Betances would like to raise this
point when we discuss Article 10.
M. Betances (Dominican Republic):
Translation : I venture to press once more
for the omission of the word ?new?. I pro-


pose to substitute for the words ?that any new
derivative? the words ?that any other deri-
vative?. We must be careful to avoid any
ambiguity in an international convention, and
if we change the words which are ambiguous,
we are not thereby changing the paragraph
itself in any way.
The President
Translation : M. Perrot has asked whether
M. Betances wishes to discuss this question
now.
IV3. de Betances (Dominican Republic) :
Translation : I shall put forward my pro-
posal again when we discuss Article 10, but
I was anxious to bring it to your notice now.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Deleyingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir iVlalcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I support the proposal of the delegate of
the Dominican Republic. I cannot follow
the reasoning by which M. Perrot supports the
text as it stands in the draft. If as a matter
of fact the words which follow would cover
any existing derivatives, why not make the
point perfectly clear by leaving out the word
?new? ? There seems to be no object in retain-
ing the word ?new? if it is intended that
it shall be possible to include in the Convention
any existing derivative of morphine or cocaine
which may be proved to have the same abusive
properties as morphine and cocaine.
It also seems to me that, if the word ?new?
is retained, it is left open for someone to argue
in the future that the word implies that it
was not the intention of the Conference that it
should be possible to include existing deri-
vatives within the scope of the Convention.
It could be argued that because ?new? deri-
vatives were mentioned, it was intended to
imply that existing derivatives were to remain
outside the scope of the Convention.
I therefore suggest that both Article 4 and
Article 10, where the same phrase occurs,
would be clearer if the word ?new? were
omitted. Article 10 and Article 4 hang
together ; the same phraseology is employed. I
do not think it is sufficient merely to say that
the matter can be discussed when we deal
with Article 10, because the same question
arises in both articles. I therefore desire
to support the proposal of the representative
of the Dominican Republic.
The President
Translation : M. Carriere, delegate of Swit-
zerland, will address the Conference.
IVI. Carriere (Switzerland):
Translation : I support the view taken by
the Rapporteur of Sub-Committee F. We
drafted Article 10 in its present form because
the derivatives of morphine and cocaine known
at present, other than those mentioned in the
Convention, do not possess harmful or dange-
rous properties, and there was therefore no
need to refer to them here. The word ?new?
is, as it were, a kind of safety-valve.
I ask you, on behalf of Sub-Committee F,
to agree to retain the world ?new? in Articles
4 and 10.
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : On behalf of the Spanish
delegation, I should like to say that, from the
technical point of view, we agree with M. Be-
tances, whose proposal also has the support
of Sir Malcolm Delevingne. We do not see
any objection to the deletion of the word
?new? and we think there is a certain danger
in retaining it.
We are told that Sub-Committee F adopted
this word because it considered that the other
derivatives of morphine were already speci-
fically mentioned in Article 4, but I understand
that there are, for example, two other substances
derived from morphine which are not mentioned.
The note on eukodal and dicodide in
Document C. H. 180 submitted by the Director
of the Health Section states that ?in the last
few years two new derivatives of morphine
which produce euphonia and can therefore
be habit-forming? have come into use. Hence
they should be classified together with mor-
phine and heroin?.
These substances are not mentioned in Article
4, but they are already known, so that if we
adopt the texts submitted to us, we cannot
afterwards class them amongst the substances
mentioned in Article 4 because they would
not be new.
M. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : I support the proposal of the
delegate of the Dominican Republic. The
word ?new? may cause difficulties.
The President
Translation : M. Carriere, delegate of Swit-
zerland, will address the Conference.
IVI. Carriere (Switzerland) :
Translation : lam sorry to have to prolong
the discussion, but I think we are bound to
reply to the fresh objections which have been
raised.
I still maintain that, as the article stands,
it will be possible to include in the Convention
under the term ?any other narcotic drug?
any narcotics derived from morphine and
proved to be really dangerous, and no one, I
think, would object to their inclusion.
The danger from that point of view is surely
negligible, even supposing, as the Egyptian
delegate thinks, that any danger really exists.
The substances just mentioned, eukodal and
dicodide, are as yet little known, and M. Perrot
himself, who is a specialist on this subject,
admits that he is unfamiliar with them.
Very little is as yet known regarding their
properties. I had thought of these substances
in connection with this article, but as they are
so little known I considered there was no
occasion, for the present, to make provision for
them in the Convention, and we could bring
them under its scope whenever they were defi-
nitely known to be dangerous. If, however,
we omit the word ?new?, I foresee the possibi-
lity that this text, so amended, may be used
to bring under the terms of the Convention
substances to which it should not apply.
During the discussions of Sub-Committee F
the question of codeine was raised, although

Accordinvlv we fi.? ,1 .. .. ' sentence providing that the Convention
Accordingly, we retained the word ?new?
as it may prevent certain abuses, and I there-
fore ask the Conference to accept the text as it
is at present drafted.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
1 ranslation : With all due respect to the
Chair man of Sub-Committee F, the reply which
he has given to my remarks is really not very
convincing. J
He has shown us that substances exist which
may be termed semi-new?. The substances
1 referred to must be known, since the League
of Nations has published a document on them,
but they are not well known. Are they to
be considered as new or not ? That is a
concrete case.
Moreover, we are told that the list of narco-
tics in this paragraph is exhaustive. Could
we not, then, simplify the question by omitting
the first part of paragraph (/), and keeping only
the latter part ? The paragraph would then
read as follows : ?Any other narcotic drug
to which the present Convention may be applied
m accordance with Article 10.?
Mr. Mac White (Irish Free State) :
Mr. President, I wish to support the pro-
posal made by the honourable delegate of the
Dominican Republic, M. Betances. I bow to
the great competence of the distinguished spe-
cialists we have here, but, at the same time,
I feel that if we maintain the word ?new?
it will lead to a misunderstanding. For that
reason I support the motion to strike it out.
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : A number of members of
Sub-Committee F whom I have consulted, or
who have given me their opinion, are entirely
in favour of the Spanish delegate?s proposal
to omit the first part of paragraph (/) and to
leave only the end, beginning ?any other nar-
cotic ...?
I think this would settle the question.
The President ;
2 ranslation : Does the honourable dele-
gate of the Dominican Republic withdraw his
amendment ?
M. Betances (Dominican Republic) ;
2 ranslation : I thank the delegates who
have supported me, and I second the Spanish
delegate?s proposal.
The President
Translation : As the Rapporteur and the
Chairman of the Sub-Committee accept the
Spanish delegate?s proposal, that is now the
only one before us. May I regard it as
adopted ?
M. Dmichert, delegate of Switzerland, will
address the Conference.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
2 ranslation : I should like to make a short
statement in regard to paragraph (/) of Article 4,
may be applied to any other narcotic drug.
I merely wish to confirm what the Swiss
member of Sub-Committee F has already told
the experts on the Conference, namely, that
the Swiss delegation at first felt some misgivings
on account of the wide scope of the article.
We felt that it was in the nature of a leap in
the dark, and might possibly lead to some
arbitrary action.
What is a narcotic ? Or, rather, what is not
a narcotic ? Ether, for example, and another
substance for which we have a greater liking
alcohol are undoubtedly narcotics, and
as we are aware, if not by personal experience,
at any rate from the experiences of others, the
latter above all becomes habit-forming.
I hasten to add, however, that on reflection,
and in view of the terms of the draft Article
io which we also have before us, the Swiss dele-
gation is prepared to accept the wording of
paragraph (/) of Article 4.
If, however, the Conference decides to change
the present tenor of Article 10, I should have
to raise this point again.
Article' 4 was adopted at the first reading, with
the omission proposed by the first delegate of Spain.
Article 5.
The text of Article 5 was read as follows :
"The Contracting Parties shall enact
effective laws or regulations to limit exclu-
sively to medical and scientific purposes
the manufacture, import, sale, distribution,
export and use of the substances to which
this Chapter applies. They shall co-ope-
rate with one another to prevent the use
of the substances for any other purposes.?
The text of Article 5 was adopted at the
first reading.
Article 6.
The text of Article 6 was read as follows :
?The Contracting Parties shall control
all persons manufacturing, importing, sell-
ing, distributing or exporting the substances
to which this Chapter applies, as well as
the buildings in which these persons carry
on such industry or trade.
With this object, the Contracting
Parties shall :
?(a) Confine the manufacture of the
said substances to those establishments and
premises alone which have been licensed
for the purpose, or obtain information
respecting the establishments and premises
in which these substances are manufactured
and keep a register of them ;
?{b) Require that all persons engaged in
the manufacture, import, sale, distribu-
tion, or export of the said substances shall
obtain a licence or permit to engage in
these operations ;
?(c) Require that such persons shall
enter in their books the quantities manu-
factured, imports, exports, sales and all
other distribution of the said substances.
This requirement shall not necessarily
apply either to supplies by medical prac-
titioners to their patients or to sales by


duly authorised chemists on medical shall obtain a licence or permit, seems to me
prescriptions, provided in each case that to stand on a different footing. A chemists
the medical prescriptions are filed and pre- are registered, I suppose, in mos coun nes,
the medical prescriptions are filed and pre-
served by the medical practitioner or
chemist.?
The President
Translation: Article 6is open for discussion.
M. van Wettum, delegate of the Netherlands,
will address the Conference.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
May I ask a question ? Under paragraph ( a)
of Article 6, we read, ?or obtain information
respecting the establishments and premises
in which these substances are manufactured?.
It seems to me that these words must be sup-
pressed. My reason for this is the following.
In Article 10, paragraph (6) of the Hague Con-
vention it is required that manufacturers shall
have a licence or permit or shall make a
declaration to the competent authorities. I
think therefore that we should leave out the
words to which I have just referred.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I am not quite sure that M. van Wettum has
realised the implications of his proposal. If
his amendment were adopted, paragraph ( a)
would read ; ?The Contracting Parties shall
confine the manufacture of the said substances
to those establishments and premises alone
which have been licensed for the purpose?.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
?And keep a register of them.?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
Yes, ?and keep a register of them?. But
this Chapter applies to every preparation men-
tioned in paragraphs {d) and {e) of Article 4,
and these preparations may be made in any
chemist?s shop in the country. It therefore
seems to me that if we adopt the proposal made
by M. van Wettum it will have the effect of
requiring every chemist?s premises throughout
the country to be licensed by the Government.
I do not know whether M. van Wettum intends
that, and I would rather like to hear what he
has to say on the point.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
I do not quite understand what Sir Malcolm
Delevingne means. Is it true that the phrase
in (a), ?or obtain information respecting the
establishments and premises in which these
substances are manufactured?, corresponds to
the phrase in (6) of Article 10 of the Hague
Convention : ?shall make to the competent
authorities an official declaration? ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
I am not quite sure that I understand in my
turn what M. van Wettum means. All that
I wish to point out is that, if his proposal is
accepted, the paragraph would mean that every
chemist?s shop in which any of the prepaia-
tions mentioned in paragraphs [d) or (e) of
Artilce 4 is made will require to be licensed by
the Government. Is that a result which he
pesires ?
Paragraph ( b ) of Article 6 of the draft
Convention, which says that all persons engaged
in the manufacture, etc., of the said substances
and a general permit can be given, as has
been done in Great Britain by Order, to all
chemists placed on the official Chemists? Regis-
ter ; but I am not quite sure that it would
be possible to do so in the case of the chemist?s
premises. Ido not see that anything is gained
by the omission of the words which M. van
Wettum suggests.
The President
Translation : M. Carriere, delegate of
Switzerland, will address the Conference.
M. Carriere (Switzerland)
Translation : I think this point should be
made somewhat clearer. A chemist, in his
capacity as such, and in virtue of the licence
he has received from his Government, need not
obtain the licence referred to in paragraph [h]
of Article 6. Chemists do not need a special
licence to practise pharmacy ; they hold a
diploma which entitles them to carry on their
profession.
If a chemist does not aerry on an ordinary
pharmaceutical busines, that is to say, does
not merely make up medical prescriptions,
but manufactures drugs on a wholesale or
semi-wholesale scale, he is no longer a chemist,
but an ordinary manufacturer, and as such
requires a licence. The Swiss Narcotics Law
makes this distinction ; it exempts pharma-
ceutical chemists from the necessity of holding
the licence provided for in paragraph (b). Indeed,
I do not think we could ask chemists to apply
for a second licence.
The President
Translation : M. Perrot, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
M. Perrot (France) :
Translation : I agree with what Dr. Car-
riere has said, and I do not think the text is
very clear. In highly developed countries where
a chemist, in order to obtain a licence, has to
hold diplomas obtained after long and arduous
study, he is entitled to stock narcotics and mani-
pulate them. Unless the present wording of
the article is changed, chemists will require still
another licence ; if this is not what is meant,
I should like the article to be referred to the
Drafting Committee for re-drafting.
The President
Translation : Has the Rapporteur anything
to say regarding this last proposal ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Rapporteur ;
Has M. van Wettum withdrawn his original
proposal ? I ask that, because the point raised
by M. Perrot is a different one, and perhaps
we had better dispose of M. van Wettum?s
proposal first.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
Under paragraph {b) I read :
?require that all persons engaged in the
manufacture, import, sale, distribution or
export of the said substances shall obtain
a licence or permit to engage in these
operations.?


If that is so, it seems to me that the phrase
?or obtain information respecting the establish-
ments...? must be deleted, because in the
beginning of paragraph (a) it says :
?confine the manufacture of the said
substances to those establishments and
premises alone which have been licensed
for the purpose.?
It seems to.me, therefore, that no other words
must be added. If, at. the beginning of the
article, manufacture is confined to those esta-
blishments which have been licensed, and if
a licence is required from those persons, you
must not add any other words.
I have not withdrawn my proposal.
The President.
Translation : M. Perrot, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
IVI. Perrot (France)
Translation : The drafting of this article
is certainly most remarkable. I find in
paragraph (a) the words, ?confine the manu-
facture of the said substances to those es-
tablishments and premises alone which have
been licensed for the purpose?. I do not see
how you can authorise establishments or pre-
mises ; I presume that reference is made to the
persons conducting the establishments or
premises. This wording needs revision, and I
again urge that the article be referred to the
Drafting Committee.
Further, this article should also contain the
following proviso ; ?Subject to the internal
regulations concerning pharmacy.? M. Car-
riere has just mentioned the Swiss Federal Law
on Narcotics, for instance, which defines the
conditions under which chemists may transport,
sell, etc., medicines containing narcotics. The
wording of the article ought to be much more
precise.
The President
Translation : 1 call upon Sir Malcolm
Delevingne, delegate of the British Empire, to
speak.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Rapporteur :
The wording of paragraph (a) is the same as
that in Article io of the Hague Convention.
I am not aware that the wording of the Hague
Convention in this matter has given rise to any
difficulty, and 1 think it would be unwise,
if I may venture to say so, to alter a wording
which has been in force for a number of years
and which has not given rise to any difficulty.
I do not know whether M. van Wettum desires
to press his suggestion. I can hardly think he
desires that every pharmacist?s premises in the
country should be licensed. Unless he attaches
great importance to the point, I appeal
to him to withdraw his amendment, in older
that we may proceed with our work.
M. Bourgois (France) :
1 ranslation : As Chairman of Sub-Com-
mittee E, I realise the difficulties of this subject,
not merely as regards drafting but also as
regards fundamental points, and I think it
woild be better for the Drafting Committee to
re-consider the question.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
I fully support what has been said by M.
Bourgois, and I ask that the matter be referred
to the Drafting Committee.
The President
Translation : This part of the article will
therefore be sent to the Drafting Committee.
{Agreed).
Are there any other remarks on Article 6 ?
IVI. Perrot (France) :
Translation : There is an omission in Arti-
cle 6 (c). After the words ?....shall not
necessarily apply either to supplies by medical
practitioners to their patients...? the words
?dentists and veterinary surgeons? should be
added. The same applies as regards the last
words of the sentence.
IVI. Carriere (Switzerland)
Translation : The patients to whom the
Convention is intended to refer, and whom we
wish to protect, are not treated by veterinary
surgeons. The text should therefore be some-
what altered.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Rapporteur :
I have heard no arguments in support of this
change. The existing provision in the Hague
Convention applies only to medical prescrip-
tions and sales by duly authorised chemists.
It does not include either dentists or veterinary
surgeons. I can see no hardship in requiring
dentists and' veterinary surgeons who supply
these drugs to make the necessary entries in a
register. As a matter of fact, I understand that
a dentist very seldom supplies the drugs. He
administers the drugs in the course of his
practice, but I think it is very seldom that he
actually supplies the drugs to a patient. Unless
there is some strong reason for altering the
Hague Convention, I would appeal to the mover
of this amendment to withdraw it. At any
rate, I think we ought to hear the reasons which
can be advanced in support of the change.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium) :
Translation : The text ought not to be elabo-
rated unnecessarily; the matter should be
governed by the regulations of the individual
countries, because the designation of dentist
and veterinary surgeon is not the same in
every country. I do not see any advantage
in making this addition to the Convention.
The President
Translation : Does M. Perrot still press his
proposal ?
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : In many countries veterinary
surgeons are allowed to keep medicines and
dispense them directly to their patients, and
we must bear this in mind. Indeed, several
of my colleagues have spoken to me on the
subject of this wording.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium) ;
Translation : As it is difficult to draw a dis-
tinction, we might say ?doctors and other duly
authorised persons?.

Translation : I second M. de Myttenaere?s
proposal, as the clause should include midwives
as well.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Rapporteur :
M. de Myttenaere?s proposal is far worse than
M. Perrot?s. I would much rather have M.
Perrot?s if I had to chose between them ; it
is at least limited to two classes of persons.
M. de Myttenaere would extend it to any class
of persons the Government chose to authorise.
I would rather be in the frying pan with M.
Perrot than fall into the fire with M. de Myttenaere.
I have not yet heard, however, any reasons

narcotics, too, are combined in such a way that
it is not possible to extract them from

it well to submit these regulations to us,
and I do not think they constitute a breach in
the provisions of the Convention, while they
will, to some extent, facilitate the business fo

so good as to adopt this article.
The President
Translation : Does anyone else wish to
speak about Article 8 ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne, delegate of the
British Empire, will address the Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
Mr. President, it is possible that, as Dr.
Carriere says, the Drafting Committee has mis-
understood the meaning of Sub-Committee F ;
but I venture to say that that is not the fault of
the Drafting Committee, because, at any rate
in the English text, we have followed exactly the
wording of the recommendation contained in
the report of Sub-Committee F. If the members
of the Conference will look at the English text
of the report of Sub-Committee F, they will
find that the recommendation reads as follows:
?When the Office international d?Hygiene
publique, after consultation with the Health
Committee of the League of Nations, shall have
declared?? and so on, and in the French text
the words are: ?Lorsque I?Office international
d?Hygiene publique avecle concours?? and so on.
The question which Dr. Carriere raises is
really, I think, a question not of form, but of
substance. Is it the intention of the Sub-
Committee that the Office international d?Hy-
gienc publique at Paris shall only act when it
is asked to do so by the Health Committee of
the League of Nations ?On that point, of
course, the Drafting Committee is not compe-
tent to express an opinion. I think, therefore,
that it is a question for the Conference itself
to decide whether we intend to limit the func-
tions of the Office international in the way
suggested by Dr. Carriere or whether we should
leave it free to take up a question of this kind
on its own motion.
There is one argument, perhaps, in favour of
leaving the Office international free to take up
a matter of this kind on its own motion ; the
Office international d?Hygiene publique includes
representatives of States which are not Members
of the League of Nations, and it might be that
one of those States might wish to bring up a
question of the kind to which Article 8 refers,
and the natural and the most convenient way
for it to do so would be to bring it up at a
meeting of the Office international. It is
not for me to express any opinion on the point ;
but I would like to hear what Dr. Carriere has
to say about it.
The President:
Translation : M. Carriere, delegate of Swit-
zerland, will address the Conference.
M. Carriere (Switzerland)
Translation : To begin with, it is evident
that, if the Drafting Committee had wished to
preserve our text, it had only to utilise the
text which was proposed to it ; ?When the
International Health Office, ?avec le concours? of
the Health Committee of the League of Nations,
shall have declared, etc. .
The Drafting Committee thought fit to give its
own interpretation to this text, since it changed
it and adopted the following : ?In the event
of the International Health Office, after con-
sultation with the Health Committee of the
League of Nations, deciding, etc. . .?
Sir SVlalcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
The Drafting Committee had to follow the
English text.
ML Carriere (Switzerland) :
Translation : I am not familiar with the
English text, but I cannot imagine that it is
very different from the French text. The
French text says ?avec le concours??, which
cannot possibly be understood as ?apres consul-
tation??. It was with a knowledge of the text
submitted to it that the Drafting Committee
thought it better to define and explain what
Sub-Committee F meant by the ?concours?? of
the Office international d?Hygiene publique,
a ?concours?? which consists in having recourse to
the advice of that office which has become the
advisory organ to the Health Committee of
the League of Nations.
It seems to me clear that the Office interna-
tional d?Hygiene publique at Paris can only
act as an advisory body. The Drafting Commit-
tee, having thought it expedient to make this
point clear, I in my turn have thought it useful
to give it the meaning which we intended it
to have and which, I repeat, is the following :
The International Flealth Office, fulfilling the
duties assigned to it, will be the advisory organ
on this question.
In reply to the question asked by Sir Malcolm
Delevingne, I admit that the Office international
d?Hygiene publique preserves, of course, com-
plete independence, and if it one day wishes
to raise the question on its own initiative, nobody
can prevent it from doing so.
As we are concerned, however, with the appli-
cation of a Convention, a matter which falls
within the competence of the League of Nations,
it is obvious that, when the Office International
d?Hygiene publique deems it expedient to take
such initiative, it will have to forward the results
thereof tojthe Health Committee of the League of
Nations' that is to say, to the body entrusted
with the execution of this part of the Convention
which we are preparing.
The President
Translation : If nobody else desires to speak
on Article 8, it will be adopted in principle and
referred to the Drafting Committee.
M. Carriere (Switzerland) :
2 Tanslation : I should like to point out,
Mr. President, that we are faced with a question
of drafting and a question of principle. Do you
not think that the Conference should pronounce
on the question of principle ?
The President
Translation : I do. Accordingly, I call
upon those members of the Conference who
would like to give their opinion on the question
of principle to do so.


As no one wishes to speak, I declare Article 8 course of events, be included in the regulations
adopted and referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article 8 was adopted at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article 9.
The text of Article 9 was read as follows :
?Notwithstanding the provisions of Ar-
ticles 5 and 6, any Contracting Party may
authorise the supply to the public by
chemists, at their own discretion, as medi-
cines, for immediate use in urgent cases,
of the following opiate officinal prepara-
tions : tincture of opium, Sydenham lau-
danum and Dover powder. The maximum
dose, however, which may be supplied
in such cases must not contain more than
25 centigrammes of officinal opium, and
the chemist must enter in his books the
quantities, as provided in Article 6 [c).?
The President
Translation : The discussion on Article 9
is open.
M. Betances, delegate of the Dominican Re-
public, will address the Conference.
IVI. Betances (Dominican Republic)
Translation : During the discussion of Sub-
committee F?s report the honourable delegate
of the British Empire opposed this article with
arguments that were conclusive. I entirely
agree with him. The following are the reasons
which have led me to oppose the proposal
whereby chemists shall be permitted to sell to
the public, without a medical prescription, cer-
tain medicaments containing opium.
In authorising a chemist to sell or prescribe
to a customer laudanum or tincture of opium on
the grounds that that customer is in pain of
some kind, we are giving to the chemist the
powers of a doctor, a procedure which is con-
trary to the laws of all countries. The chemist
cannot know whether he is dealing with an opium
addict who simulates pain in order to obtain
a certain quantity of opium, or whether the
customer is a man in real pain which can be
assuaged by a dose of opium which he is allowed
to supply. Such a decision is not always an
easy one even for an experienced doctor to
take. Moreover, I think it doubtful whether the
pain caused by certain illnesses can be assuaged
by the soothing medicine which it would be
possible to sell in this way. I have known
opium and ether addicts who managed to obtain
small quantities of laudanum or ether from
chemists on the grounds that no doctor was
within instant call. These addicts saved up
small quantities of the drug obtained in this
way and consumed them later to satisfy their
vicious inclination.
As regards Dover powder, this is no longer
a medicine for urgent use, and it would be
necessary to know the pathological cases in
which it gives satisfactory results.
Although an authorisation to supply this
perparation might not be abused by honest
and conscientious chemists, I am convinced
that others would seek to profit by this opportu-
nity to deal in a traffic dangerous to the public.
In addition to the reasons I have just set
forth, there is one which seems to me still more
convincing. Article 9 should not figure in a
Convention such as we are about to sign. The
provisions of this article should, in the natural
made by each country for the sale of narcotics
and poisonous substances. In countries where
it is sometimes difficult to obtain the services
of a doctor at short notice, or where the regu-
lations for the sale of these products as medi-
cines are too severe and cause genuine hardship
to the public, it is easy to modify the regula-
tions in such a way as not to be in contradiction
either with the letter or the spirit of our Con-
vention or with the laws which govern the prac-
tice of medicine. As we know, most nations
already have their own regulations on this
matter, drawn up in conformity with previous
Conventions, and framed to meet the particular
needs of each country.
I will not emphasise the dangers which this
article would entail if it were incorporated in
our Convention. It would weaken the moral
foundations of the Convention and detract from
the humanitarian purpose it has in view. I
repeat, the question dealt with in this article
is a matter rather for regulation in each country,
in so far, that is, as certain countries consider
it to be of any real practical value. Accordingly,
I must still refuse to give my adherence to
this article, and I propose that it should be
dropped.
The President
Translation : M. Pinto-Escalier, delegate of
Bolivia, will address the Conference.
IV!. Pinto-Escalier (Bolivia)
Translation : I agree with what M. Be-
tances has said. As a doctor, I do not think
that there are sufficient reasons for authorising
the chemist to supply, as medicines for urgent
use, the preparations referred to in this article.
I, for my part, also propose that this article
should be dropped.
The President
Translation: M. Carriere, delegate of Switz-
erland, will address the Conference.
IVI. Carriere (Switzerland) ;
Translation : If I rightly understood the
arguments used by the delegate of the Domini-
can Republic, M. Betances wishes Article 9
to be deleted. I think that M. Betances and
M. Pinto-Escalier have exaggerated the impor-
tance of this article. There is no question
of removing these products from the scope of
the regulations provided for in the Convention.
Clearly Sydenham laudanum and tincture of
opium would remain subject to the provisions
of the Convention and to the laws promul-
gated in virtue of that Convention.
All we have wished to do is to provide for a
very simple case. Let us imagine some unfor-
tunate man and this is an accident which
might happen to any of us seized with colic
in the street. He enters a chemist?s shop, and
asks for a few drops of laudanum, not having
time to take other treatment. We do not
want this unfortunate man to encounter an
inhuman rigidity on the part of the chemist
who, by a strict observance of the law, might
say to him, ?I cannot give you your 20 drops of
laudanum. Go to a doctor in the neighbour-
hood and when you have your prescription,
bring it to me and I will give you the laudanum
you want.? That is the case against which
we wish to provide.

moreover purely optional. We say, ?Any Con-
tracting Party may do this. Consequently,
those parties which consider such a measure
to be contrary to their laws, customs and usage
are at liberty not to adopt it.
Finally, the question is a purely domestic one,
which in our opinion is of quite secondary
importance. A chemist will act in this matter
on his own responsibility. He will, of course, be
obliged to enter in his books the quantities of
laudanum or tincture of opium thus dispensed.
In this way it will be possible to check any abuse
of the authorisation conferred upon him in
virtue of this article.

Dominican Republic, will address the Con-
ference.
!VI. Betances (Dominican Republic) :
Translation : hrom what M. Carriere has
just said, I think I must have expressed,
myself badly. At the same time, Ido seriously
ask how a chemist can know whether the cus-
tomer coming into his shop is in real pain. I
am sure that even a doctor would find it diffi-
cult to say. The customer in question may be
merely pretending, with the sole object of
obtaining a certain quantity of opium, which
he will easily be able to do if he goes from one
chemist to another on the same pretext. I have
myself known cases of opium addicts obtaining
opium in this way. Accordingly, I am jus-
tified in my apprehensions as regards the dan-
gers of Article 8.
The President
7 ranslation : M. de Myttenaere, delegate of
Belgium, will address the Conference.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium) :
7 ranslation : lam sorry to have to take up
the time of the Conference with more or less
scientific considerations, but, as Dr. Carriere
has very rightly said, they are less scientific
than they appear. Dr. Carriere quoted to you
the example of what might happen to any of
us, namely, that we should suddenly be seized
with pain in the street and be obliged to enter
the first chemist s shop we could find. Some
members of the Conference do not appear to
take incidents of this nature quite sufficiently
into account. Ihey fear that a medicine which
is indispensable in urgent cases will afford an
opportunity for a dishonest chemist to evade
the law. For my part, I believe the truth
to be exactly the opposite, and yet I am in
charge of the suppression of fraud in Belgium.
The excessive severity of the laws only hits
honest traders.
Surgeon-General Blue, delegate of the United
States, whio was so anxious to reduce to a mini-
mum the production and distribution of nar-
cotics, himself admitted, in his minority report,
that it was necessary to authorise chemists
to supply medicine in urgent cases, while await
ing the arrival of the doctor.
1 hat is what I might call the medical reason
for this article, but there is another far more
important point.
When my French colleague, M. Perrot, and
myself arrived here, we were astounded to see
in regard to this or that medicine, whereas we
ourselves had applied in the strictest possible
way the legislation arising out of the Hague
Convention.
Great Britain has a whole page of exceptions,
and so has Germany. Further, lam even told
by my colleague on Sub-Committee F that in
Italy the distribution of laudanum is entirely
free. I therefore came to the conclusion that
it was absolutely necessary for a Committee
of experts and an international Conference to
have all these exceptions brought into line.
If we wish to leave the different pharmaco-
poeias free to call the various preparations by
any given name, well and good, but, at least,
let all the exceptions to the Hague Convention
be the same.
Article 8 of the draft Convention provides
that, in the event of the Office international
d Hygiene publique deciding that certain pre-
parations containing narcotic alkaloids cannot
give rise to the drug habit, the provisions of the
present Convention shall ncft be applicable to
these preparations. This shows clearly that
our desire is to suppress fraud, not to encourage
it. Our humanitarian aims have urged us to
facilitate the obtaining of indispensable medi-
cines by those who are in pain. We do not,
however, go so far as to approve of the free
sale of laudanum.
I will give you a concrete example as regards
the facilities for obtaining pharmaceutical pro-
ducts. During one of my tours of inspection,
a chemist said to me, ?Inspector, I lost a custo-
mer yesterday. Not having the right to issue
Dover powder without a prescription, I had to
refuse an urgent request for 5 centigrammes of it,
and this morning the man came to tell me that
his father was dead, because I had been unwilling
to supply him with the medicine which ordi-
narily gives relief. I was told by my customer
that in future he would deal with another
chemist.?
I fully realise that in this case there is no
relation between cause and effect, but the case
serves to show the possible results of excessive
restrictions. If they are too severe, they prove
unfair to honest tradesmen. We have pro-
vided the means to relax them in certain urgent
cases on the responsibility of the chemist. We
do not make it obligatory to adopt this sugges-
tion. In Article 9we say : ?Any Contracting
Party may authorise? ; we do not say ?shall?.
Gentleman, I would lay stress on that point.
This is not a question of the carrying out by
a chemist of the duties of the doctor, any more
than the question of encouraging fraud. Article
9 simply provides for the protection of the
honest trader, and for rendering uniform the
exceptions to the Opium Convention.
The President
Translation : M. Betances, delegate of the
Dominican Republic, will address the Confe-
rence.
M. Betances (Dominican Republic)
Translation : M. de Myttenaere, as a
learned pharmaceutical expert, has spoken
from the chemist?s point of view. I should
like to speak as a doctor.
I note that our Belgian colleague has under-
taken to defend this article, although in a


previous speech he spoke against the sale of heroin,
which is nevertheless a medicine for urgent
use. A patient may die from being unable to
obtain heroin at a moment?s notice. This is
an unquestionable fact, but when M. de Myt-
tenaere tells us that a man died because he
could not obtain Dover powder, I can only say
it is the first time that I have heard of such
a thing.
Moreover, there are many diseases for which
opium and opium products are definitely
required. This is a question beyond the power
of a chemist to decide. I appeal to the honour-
able members present who are doctors.
The President
Translation : M. Perrot, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
IVI. Perrot (France) ;
Translation : I may be forgiven for adding
one word to this discussion, which is carrying
us far from the point of view that ought to
occupy our attention. I have no wish to
become involved in this medico-pharmaceu-
tical discussion. I want to state the point of
view of the man in the street, as Dr. Caniere
has done. The man in the street, when he is
in pain, goes to a chemist and asks him for
some substance which, in certain countries
mentioned by M. de Myttenaere, the chemist
is obliged to refuse.
In France, the regulations which we made in
1916 are so strict that they are now being
revised. When I told my Government that
I had accepted the proposal put forward by
M. de Myttenaere, I was informed that I had
gone beyond the regulations of my country.
We are now submitting to you a formula in
the hope that it will avoid errors on the side
of excessive severity, for there is always a
scapegoat either the chemist or the public
itself.
I shall therefore ask you to give the question
your favourable consideration. Whatever my
friend, M. Betances, may think, the public
runs no danger. For example, if a sick person
with evil intentions asks his chemist two or
three times for laudanum it will be refused
him. In any case, there is no public danger,
and that is the point I wish to make.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir IVSalcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
Mr. President, I desire to support the motion
of the delegate of the Dominican Republic ;
that is, the motion to omit Article 9. I regret
to find myself again opposed to my Belgian
colleague, but, at any rate, I am happy on this
occasion to feel that I am on the right side,
that I am taking the side which he took yes-
terday morning in urging the Conference not
to agree to the sale of dangerous preparations
to the public except on a medical prescription.
This is the point which is raised by this article,
this proposal which has been submitted to us
by Sub-Committee F ; Are these preparations
to be sold to the public otherwise than on a
medical prescription ?
I want first of all to say a word on the refe-
rence made by the Belgian delegate to certain
exceptions to the Hague Convention which he
says are contained in the British regulations.
It is quite true that there are certain exceptions,
but there are no exceptions which would not
fall within the scope of Article 8, which we have
just adopted \ that is to say, we have no excep-
tions for any preparations except those which,
by the nature of the compound, are unsuitable
for use, and do not lend themselves to use, by
an addict. Among those preparations I may
mention Dover powder, and I have no doubt that,
when Article 8 comes to be put into force by the
Office international d?Hygiene publique and
the Health Committee of the League, Dover
powder will be one of the exemptions which
that Office will recommend, and, in this case,
Article 9, so far as it refers to Dover powder,
will become superfluous.
I heard with some surprise from the Belgian
delegate that the sale of laudanum in Italy was
entirely unrestricted. If that is so, I am sure
we shall all await with interest the explanation
which no doubt the Italian delegate will give us.
We have always held in England, and I believe
it has been held, at any rate, in the majority
of countries, that laudanum is one of the pre-
parations included among those in Article 14
of the Hague Convention as a preparation which
contains more than 0.2 per cent of morphine.
Let us pass now to the substance of the propo-
sal before us ; this is not a matter, of course, on
which I could claim to speak with any autho-
rity and I therefore felt it my duty to consult the
medical authorities of the British Government.
I have received a very strong opinion from
them that they are opposed to any sale of lau-
danum unless it is diluted below the limit
of 0.2 per cent mentioned in the Hague Con-
vention. They cannot conceive any emergency
in which the administration by a chemist of
laudanum containing morphine in excess of that
limit of 0.2 per cent ought to precede consultation
with a doctor. This is an opinion upon which
I am bound to act, and I think that, coming from
the medical authorities of Great Britain, it is
an opinion which ought to carry some weight
with the Conference.
The opinion of Surgeon-General Blue has
been mentioned. This is what Surgeon-General
Blue says in his minority report (I shall not
quote the whole passage, but only the relevant
sentences) ; ?As it would be possible?
he means as it would be possible under the
recommendation of Sub-Committee F ? ;) ? for
a person to obtain eight grains of opium? (he
was referring to the original recommendation of
Sub-Committee F that the quantity allowed
to be administered hy the chemists should be
fifty centigrammes ; that has now been reduced
to twenty-five and so I presume ?4? would
be substituted for ?8?) ?at a single purchase
and by proceeding from one chemist?s shop to
another, the same individual might obtain enough
opium in a single day to satisfy the demands
of a dozen addicts. ..? That is a very strong
expression of opinion. He goes on to say : No
doubt the restriction which the delegation?
that is, the United States delegation ?sug-
gests might inconvenience the customer, but
physicians will generally agree that 12 centi-
grammes of tincture of opium contain sufficient
opium to relieve any acute case of illness.
Opium is, of course, palliative, not curative,
? in its action, and it does positive harm in many
i cases of disease, apart from its tendency to create


addiction?. Ido not think that it is possible to
quote Surgeon-General Blue in support of the
recommendation we have before us, in Article 9.
The Belgian delegate has said to me in
private conversation (I hope that he will not
mind my referring to a private conversation)
that the effect of this Article 9 will not really
make very much difference, and that the usual
dose which would be administered by a chemist
in cases of urgency would not in fact exceed the
limit of 0.2 per cent which is already allowed by
the Hague Convention. If that is so (and he
will correct me, of course, if I am quoting him
wrongly), what is the necessity for this article at
all ? If the ordinary dose will not exceed the
limit already allowed by Article 14 of the Hague
Convention, a limit which is reproduced in the
text of the new Convention, what is the neces-
sity for this article ?
The Hague Convention and the new Conven-
tion will allow the supply by the chemist, without
a medical prescription, of doses which come
within the exemption contained in Article 14 of
the Hague Convention and in Article 4 of the
present draft. But, as a matter of fact, the pre
sent article would allowthe supply of a substance
such as laudanum in strengths greatly in excess
of the limit of 0.2 per cent. The usual dose ,
might not contain more, but it would be open,
under the wording of this article, for a chemist
to supply to a member of the public a dose of
laudanum which greatly exceeded the limit of
strength allowed by the Hague Convention.
This is an important effect which the Conference
should bear in mind.
The delegate of the Dominican Republic laid
stress on the danger which will be caused by the
adoption of this article. He said and I
entirely agree with him that it will be pos-
sible foi an addict to go round to one chemist
after another and obtain supplies of the prepa-
lations which would give him a sufficient quan-
tify to indulge his addiction. That may not
be a very likely thing to happen in a small
community, but, certainly, in any large town
where there are scores, or hundreds, of chemists,
it is a very real danger. I know from
my own experience of the administration of
these laws in England that such cases are not
imaginaiy but that they really do happen.
The addict will go to any shifts in order to
obtain the drugs he requires to satisfy his
addiction, and it is quite certain that, if this
ai tide came into force, it would be one means
by which the addict would attempt to obtain
his supplies of the drugs.
It has been said that this is a national ques-
tion and not an international question and that
the article only leaves it to the discretion of
each country to decide what it should do,
taking into account its own circumstances, and
does not impose an obligation. Ido not think,
however, that this has been quite the point 1
of view from which we have been drawing up
this Convention.
As I said yesterday, we certainly do not want
to impose on all countries provisions which are
only applicable to the circumstances of some
countries. But this is an article which would alter
an existing provision in the Hague Convention,
the Hague Convention has been in force for
four years. We have not heard, at least I have
not heard, of any difficulties which have arisen
fiWxj- 1G of the provisions of
tbe Hague Convention. We are asked, therefore, I
as it seems to me, to lower the standard
which was adopted in 1912 and to set a new
standaid which the world will naturally con-
ceive itself entitled to follow.
In those circumstances, I ask the Conference,
in the absence of any strong case in support
of the article, to vote against it.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. de Myttenaere,
delegate of Belgium, to speak.
M. de IV!yttenaere (Belgium) :
Translation : I want to say that one cannot
in justice compare my attitude yesterday with
my attitude to-day. To-day we are asking
for the supply of 25 milligrammes of morphine
as a medicine for urgent use, and this request has
nothing in common with the possibility of
scattering throughout the world hundreds of
thousands of phials containing 30 centigrammes
of heroin.
The President
7 'reinstation : I call upon M. Pernambuco,
delegate of Brazil, to speak.
M. Pernambuco (Brazil) :
7 ranslation : Allow me to quote to you a
few facts in regard to this matter. One day
a man went into a chemist?s shop to soothe his
pain with some medicine. The chemist gave
him laudanum. Some time afterwards this
man was taking 200 grammes of morphine a
day. That man was de Ouincey, the great
English author.
1 rousseau has recounted to us numerous
examples of this sort. Some of his observations
show that sick persons in pain, who start by
absorbing very small quantities of laudanum,
end by taking as much as 200 grammes per
diem. He even records a doctor who took
80 grammes of laudanum a day, which proved
most unfortunate for his practice since he
ended by betraying the code of professional
secrecy.
Women who unhesitatingly take laudanum
to soothe their pain too easily accustom them-
selves to this substance and end by taking large
quantities.
As for Dover powder, I do not think that
it is really necessary to consider this as a medi-
cine for urgent use. In my opinion, it is really
very dangerous to give sick persons the oppor-
tunity of obtaining these opiates without a
medical prescription, for it is merely putting
them on the road to the drug habit.
As Sir Malcolm Delevingne has shown, a
sick person can very easily go the round of the
chemists? shops and collect substantial quan-
tities. It has been observed in hospitals that
drug addicts have profited by changes in the
medical staff in order to obtain their favourite
drug.
I am therefore in favour of the deletion of this
article.
The President
Translation : Dr. Fabris, delegate of Italy,
will address the Conference.
Dr. Fabris (Italy)
Translation : In Italy the sale of laudanum
has been left free, for laudanum is regarded as
a remedy for urgent use. So far, no disadvan-
tages have accrued. Nevertheless, the Italian


delegation gladly accepts the restriction intro-
duced in Sub-Committee F?s report and in
Article 9 of the Convention. The Italian
Government will necessarily have to modify its
regulations concerning laudanum.
M. Petrol (France) ;
Translation : The Chairman of Sub-Com-
mittee F and myself, the author of the proposal
agree to withdraw it. If it is not put forward
again, please regard it as withdrawn.
M. Chodzko (Poland) ;
Translation : Since M. Perrot withdraws the
whole of this article, there is no reason to con-
tinue the discussion. At the same time, I
shall venture to make one remark. By with-
drawing it we shall be leaving the chemists
entirely free. Nor do I quite understand the
attitude taken up by the opponents of this
article and by the representatives of Sub-Com-
mittee F, who are proposing to withdraw it.
What surprises me, in the attitude of the
opponents of this Article, is that, when it was
being discussed, they did not object to Article y,
which allows manufacturers full liberty to
supply tons of morphine and cocaine solutions
without any control under the terms of the
Convention. I regret the withdrawal of Article
9 and, if the Conference will allow it, I shall
bring it forward again.
IVlehmed Sureya Bey (Turkey) :
Translation : We stand by this Article 9.-
for, in view of the geographical conditions of
Turkey, where there are very few chemists
and doctors, we are obliged to leave the sale
of laudanum free.
IV). Cam ere (Switzerland) ;
Translation : We are placed in a lathei
peculiar situation. As the delegate of Poland
has brought forward Article 9 again, we seem
to be formally called upon to discuss or vote on
this article. Speaking as the delegate of
Switzerland, I am in agreement with the proposal
of the Polish delegate. In view of the discus-
sions we have been having, I think it is unneces-
sary to prolong the debate and would ask
whether it would not be better to proceed at
once to the vote.
The President
Translation : The Swiss delegate proposes
that the discussion should be closed. I should
like to have the opinion of the Conference.
M. Betances, delegate of the Dominican Repub-
lic, wall address the Conference.
IV3. Betances (Dominican Republic) ;
Translation : I should like to be allowed to
add two words on this question.
The honourable delegate for Poland, in speak-
ing of morphine, failed to remark that Article 4
was followed by Articles 5, 6 and 7. As regards
the necessity of allowing chemists to give lau-
danum in certain cases, they might certainly
just as give a few drops of water. It
w ? ould come to the same thing. I beg to read
to you in this connection the opinion of a remark-
able specialist, M. Pagador, who has published
a very interesting book on opium addicts :
?Laudanum addicts, who are more nume-
rous than one might suppose, pass through
all the stages of intoxication spasms,
nightmares, visual and auditory halluci-
nations, vomitings and a tendency to
coma. Half-cured morphine addicts turn
to laudanum, instead of morphine, during
their periods of abstinence.?
Owing to the characteristics of the drug habit,
anyone, can obtain from a chemist the lauda-
num necessary for the indulgence of his vice.
The door must be closed to this. Sick persons,
instead of going to the chemist, can apply to
the nearest public clinic, clinics such as already
exist in many parts of certain towns. Lau-
danum and tincture of opium must be brought
within the scope of Article 4> and their sale
must be forbidden except upon a medical
prescription.
The President :
Translation : The discussion is closed. The
Sub-Committee having withdrawn its proposal
as regards Article 9, the draft before you no
longer contains this article. We have, however,
the proposal of the first delegate for Poland to
re-include this article in the draft. I will ask
you to vote upon the re-inclusion of Article 9
in our draft Convention.
The re-inclusion of Article 9 was adopted by 14
votes to 11.
Article 10.
The text of Article 10 was read as follows ;
?In the event of the International
Health Office, after consultation with the
Health Committee of the League of Nations,
finding that any new derivative of morphine
or cocaine, any alkaloid of opium or the
coca leaf, or any other narcotic drug, to
which the present Convention does not
apply, is liable to similar abuse and pro-
ductive of similar ill-effects as the substances
covered by the Convention, the Health
Committee shall inform the Council of
the League accordingly and recommend that
the provisions of the present Convention
shall be applied to such substance.
?The Council of the League shall commu-
nicate the said recommendation to the
Contracting Parties. Any Contracting
Party whdch is prepared to accept the re-
commendation shall notify the Secretary-
General of the League accordingly.
?As soon as ten of the Contracting Parties
have notified the Secretary-General of their
acceptance of the recommendation, the
provisions of the present Convention shall
apply, as between such Contracting Parties,
to the substance in question.?
The President
Translation : Before opening the discussion
on this article, I would repeat that the proce-
dure applying to Article 8 will apply also to the
first paragraph of Article 10.
I call upon M. El Guindy, delegate of Egypt,
to speak.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : I request that the last para-
graph of this Article should be deleted and the
second paragraph modified as follows '.
?The Council of the League of Nations
shall communicate the said recommendation
to the Contracting Parties. As soon as
this communication is made, the provisions


of the present Convention shall come into ten States would imply that the recommendation
force between the Contracting Parties as
regards the substance concerned.?
I ask for the deletion of the last paragraph
because it does not seem to be necessary to
request the adherence of ten Contracting Parties
to the recommendation, after an opinion has
been given by the Office international d?Hygiene
publique, which opinion will already have been
submitted to the Health Committee of the
League of Nations, whose competence in the
matter you all know. Such a procedure would
have the appearance of challenging an opinion
given by the technically competent institutions.
Moreover, one article lays down that, the
Contracting Powers themselves undertake to
respect the decisions taken by the Health
Committee of the League of Nations in agree-
ment with the Office international d?Hygiene
publique.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Carriere, dele
gate of Switzerland, to speak.
IVI. Carriere (Switzerland)
Translation : It is agreed, then, that the
procedure applying to Article 8 shall also apply
to Article 10.
As to the question just raised by M. El
Guindy, the Egyptian delegate, I should like
to point out that he has just alluded to
Article 8. He has shown that in Article 8
no provision was made for this complicated
procedure. In point of fact Article Bis totally
different from Article 10. Article 8 extends
the liberty of States, whereas Article 10
restricts it. The latter is an extension of the
Convention, while Article 8 provides an excep-
tion to it. It seems to me reasonable that the
procedure in the case of the exception should
not be as strict or complicated as in the case
of the extension, which is naturally a far more
important matter.
As for the proposal itself, it was the outcome
of necessity, in view of the importance of any
extension of a provision in the Convention such
as we are considering in the present case. This
proposal was dictated by the desire not to
impose this extension upon States until it
was recognised as really indispensable.
It is obvious that the procedure which pro-
vides for the co-operation of the Office inter-
national d?Hygiene publique and the Health
Committee of the League of Nations offers to
States very adequate guarantees. We have,
however, thought it necessary to give States,/
as such, the opportunity of pronouncing upon*
the decisions, or rather recommendations, ema-
nating from the two bodies mentioned in the ?
article. That is why we thought that the deci-
sion should first of all take the form of a recom-
mendation. The latter would be submitted to
States with the request that they would adopt it.
We thought that it was desirable not to make
such a recommendation obligatory, or, at any
rate, not to regard it as having the force of law,
until a certain number of States should have
admitted its expediency. In the article at
present before us we laid down the number of
ten States. We may be asked, of course, why
we propose ten rather than twelve of fifteen.
It was our opinion that, without asking for
a majority on this matter, the acceptance of
was of real value.
That is why I took the occasion yesterday
to mention to you the apprehensions that may
arise in certain quarters in respect of a matter
so important as this, which will impose serious
restrictions upon States, and the fears that,
under cover of Article 4, we are seeking to
impose upon States a recommendation which
is notperhaps absolutely indispensable.
We therefore thought that, in a matter of
such importance, namely, the extension of the
Convention to new drugs, we could not at the
outset decide that, once an opinion was
expressed by the two bodies in question, this
provision should become immediately obligatory,
but that it was better to wait until a number of
Governments should have examined it and
applied it in their own countries. From that
moment the provision would become obligatory
for all those States which admitted it.
Moreover, I think we are speaking rather of
theoretical than practical conditions, for, as
soon as the Office international d'Hygiene
publique and the Health Committee of the
League of Nations, with all the guarantees that
these two bodies offer, shall have decided that
a new product should come within the scope
of the Convention, it will not be ten States
which will accept the recommendation, but
in all probability the great majority of them.
Consequently, by this provision we are coming
near to what M. El Guindy wanted, namely, the
statement of an immediate obligation.
I repeat that, in view of the importance of
the question, States cannot be given too full
a guarantee. That is why I am asking you to
accept our proposal.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
IV!. de Palacios (Spain) ;
Translation : Like everybody else, I am
perfectly in agreement with the Chairman of
Sub-Committee F as to the modification in
form with regard to the Office international
d?Hygiene publique and the Health Committee.
I think that we shall also all agree in asking
the Drafting Committee to draft the lines which
follow in conformity with the decision which
we have taken concerning paragraph (/) of
Article 4. We must strike out of Article 10
what we have struck out of Article 4.
Further, I have submitted a proposal modi-
fying the last paragraph of Article 10. I
regard it as subsidiary to that submitted by
the delegate of Egypt. If his is not accepted,
I shall maintain my own, but for the moment
I support the proposal of the honourable
delegate of Egypt.
I think that two bodies with the authority of
the Office international d?Hygiene publique
and the Health Committee of the League of
Nations offer the fullest guarantees to States,
which would consider a declaration by these
two bodies as binding. The Spanish delega-
tion is quite prepared to accept as binding a
decision by these bodies aiming at the inclusion
of any other narcotic within the Convention.
The President
Translation : M. Dinichert, delegate of
Switzerland, will address the Conference.


ML Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I am wondering whether, as
regards the proposal of the Egyptian delegate,
which seems to me at first sight to have a
rather wide meaning, we are quite within the
limits of Article n of our Rules of Procedure.
It seems to me an amendment of such wide
scope that, without having it before them, it
may be difficult for some of the delegations to
discuss it with advantage. For my part, I
should be glad if we could postpone the dis-
cussion of this amendment until we have been
able to examine it.
The President
7 ranslation : As we are dealing with an
amendment I can authorise its discussion, if
I have received it in writing. At the same time,
I quite appreciate the point made by the first
delegate of Switzerland, and I think it would
perhaps be desirable to distribute this text and
to postpone the continuation of the discussion
until this amendment is in the hands of all
the delegations.
MS. von Eckardt (Germany)
Translation : I should have thought that
we were all perfectly aware of the matter under
discussion and that we could have voted on it
this morning.
Ml. Carriere (Switzerland) :
Translation : We have all certainly under-
stood the proposal by M. El Guindy, who
asks that the decision of the Health Committee
and the Office international d?Hygiene publique
should be ipso facto obligatory. Misunderstand-
ing is hardly possible. But this proposal
completely changes the article, and for this
reason it would be advisable that the delega-
tions should have time, if not to examine it,
at least to discuss it. For that reason I think
it would be better to postpone or adjourn the
debate.
Ml. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : Would this discussion take
place here or between delegations ?
Mi. Carriere (Switzerland) :
Translation : I only ask that each delegation
should have the time to examine the proposal
for itself.
The President
Translation : I therefore propose to put
this question aside until early this afternoon.
[Assent.)
Ml. Carriere (Switzerland) :
Translation : Does this adjournment only
apply to M. El Guindy?s proposal ?
The President
Translation : That will depend upon the
Conference?s decision. It is possible that the
amendment proposed by the Spanish delegation
will be brought forward again.
MS. Carriere (Switzerland) :
Translation : I should like to obtain an
opportunity for the Swiss delegation to revert
to paragraph I of this article, according to the
decision which will be taken on M. El Guindy?s
proposal.
The President
Translation : I venture to suggest to the
Spanish delegation that it should make its pro-
posal known.
Ml. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I quite agree. I also ask
that it should be distributed as a subsidiary
proposal at the same time as M. El Guindy?s.
The President
Translation : The Spanish proposal is to
say in the last paragraph ; ?As soon as two
of the Contracting Parties. . .?

TINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
Article 10 [Continuation of discussion).
The President :
Translation : This morning we adjourned
the discussion of Article 10 of the draft Conven-
tion. We will now continue the debate on
this article and particularly on the amendment
proposed by the Egyptian delegation. There
is also another amendment proposed by the
Spanish delegation, but it has hitherto been
reserved.
M. Dinicheit, delegate of Switzerland, will
address the Conference.
Mi. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I would first of all like to
thank you, Mr. President, for having acceded to
my request this morning to give us time to read
the Egyptian proposal and consider its exact
implications. I think I was right in making
this request, because, on examining the proposal,
I find that it differs essentially from the recom-
mendations of Sub-Committee F.
Yesterday, while Article 4, paragraph (/),
was being discussed, I already had occasion to
remark that it seemed to me that the innovation


introduced into the Hague Convention by these a recommendation is replaced by a legal obli-
clauses had a special significance and that in gation.
very truth it opened the door to the unexpected.
I could, perhaps, have added this further thought
which is at the bottom of my mind, namely,
that we Swiss like to have clear, precise and
circumscribed clauses in our laws and conventions,
because we desire to apply strictly these laws
and conventions, and that we have little liking
for clauses which, contrary to these principles,
lay obligations upon us which are not clearly de-
fined. I also pointed out that paragraph (/)
was precisely a clause of this kind.
I have no wish to repeat myself, but I simply
desire to say that, while we all know what a
narcotic is, we do not know what substances are
narcotics, as certain products and certain sub-
stances only really become narcotics when they
lead to the formation of a habit, to the abuse
which produces certain effects, and to the effects
which lead to abuse. Nor do I want to go
back on my acceptance in principle of this
clause, despite my initial hesitation and appre-
hensions. I said, however, that it was only
acceptable to us when taken in conjunction with
the mechanism which has been carefully thought
out by Sub-Committee F and embodied in the
present Article 10.
What does this Article 10 say ? It enlists the
assistance of those two great international orga-
nisations the Office international d?Hygiene
publique and the Health Committee of the
League of Nations. As we all know, these two
bodies are composed of men eminently qualified
and specially well suited to accomplish the
task which we wish to entrust to them. Accord-
ingly, the recommendations which they make
will, we may be sure, have the greatest moral
effect.
But, gentlemen, I am the first to recognise
that, in practice, this moral influence may be so
cogent as to constitute an almost binding obli-
gation ; there is, when we are dealing with an
international Convention, an essential difference
between a recommendation which is to be
considered (and as a general rule to be adopted)
and a legal obligation which a Conventional
clause may impose on us. The difference is
a fundamental one and in certain cases Govern-
ments are obliged to take note of and observe it.
I hasten to add that if such a Government
intends, in principle, to retain its liberty of action,
the other Governments would be no less free,
in view of this same principle of sovereignty,
to take independent measures which, in a case
like the present, would result in a situation
analogous to that established by means of a
reciprocal engagement.
We have now before us a proposal by the
Egyptian delegate to replace the second para-
graph of Article 10 by the following new pro-
vision :
Ihe Council of the League of Nations
shall communicate the said recommenda-
tions (the recommendations of the two
bodies in question) to the Contracting
Parties. Immediately upon receipt of such
notification, the provisions of the present
Convention shall apply, as between such
Contracting Parties, to the substance in
question.?
This amounts to saying that what should be a
recommendation becomes a legal obligation, and
the essence of the article is thus transformed if
I do not wish unduly to trespass on your time.
I ought, however, to tell my honourable friend
from Egypt, whose sincerity of purpose I
learned to appreciate during the time that we
worked together in Sub-Committee B, that it
is somewhat dangerous for that very work
which we hope to achieve to disturb, by means
of a somewhat hasty proposal, the balance of
a structure which has been very carefully
erected. And I must say, gentlemen, in order
that I may retain that spirit of frankness and
loyalty which I have so far preserved, that
the adoption of the Egyptian proposal might
seriously raise the question whether Switzerland
could adhere to a Convention which contained
such a provision.
The President
Translation : M. van Wettum, delegate of
the Netherlands, will address the Conference.
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
The contents of Article 10, which is now under
discussion, are, in my opinion, most important,
and by taking up the new principle, as regards
the recommendations to be made concerning
the extension of the Convention to cover new
dangerous drugs, a step has been taken which
I heartily welcome. The prudence and mode-
ration shown by the majority of the members of
Sub-Committee F in limiting the application of
this m*v principle in such a way that its moral
force is fully maintained, whilst, on the other
hand, the sovereign rights of all Governments are
safeguarded, make it possible for this valuable
principle to be accepted, and should be appre-
ciated and respected by all of us.
The Egyptian amendment, however, binds all
Governments which will have signed this Con-
vention to accept any future decision of the in-
ternational organisations mentioned in Article 10.
This means an unreserved surrender of sovereign
rights, the consequences of which no one can
at present foresee. Consequences of an admi-
nistrative and technical nature and many others
may at any time be involved for each country ;
the right of any individual Government, there-
fore, to decide whether or not it will at once
or at a later date accept the recommendation
of the said organisations, should be fully
recognised.
As far as the Netherlands are concerned, I
feel it my duty to declare at once that the addi-
tion of the Egyptian amendment would make
the whole article unacceptable to our delega-
tion. lam ready, however, to accept the amend-
ment proposed by the first delegate of Spain,
and I would have no objection to replacing
the number of ten countries by two.
Finally, I should like to make an urgent
appeal to my Egyptian colleague not to insist
on his amendment, so as to make it possible
for all of us unanimously to accept the valuable
new principles embodied in Article 10 as it
stands.
The President :
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir IVlalcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I am sorry that the British delegation is
unable to accept the amendment proposed by


the Egyptian delegate. I share the views which
have been expressed by the last two speakers,
and I have very little to add to what they have
said.
The effect of the amendment would be to
give the Office international d?Hygiene publique
the power of amending the Convention. It
would make a decision of that Office a part of
the terms of the Convention and binding on all
the Governments which are signatory to the
Convention. That seems to me to be a posi-
tion which sovereign States must find them-
selves unable to accept. It seems to me impos-
sible for a sovereign State to accept as binding
on it some future decision of a body consti-
tuted like the Office international d?Hygiene
publique, or like any other consultative body,
for that matter, without its having been con-
sulted and having concurred in the recommen-
dation made.
We have to remember, too, that a decision
of the Office international d?Hygiene publique
might ?at least, I presume it might - be
taken by a majority only of the members which
constitute the Office, so that it might happen
that the views of a majority only of the members
of the Office might become binding on all the
States which are signatories to the Convention.
The effect of such a proposal might well be to
place a Government or Governments in an
impossible position. A decision might be given
which they were unable to carry out. An obli-
gation might be placed upon them which they
would have no means of discharging.
To take an extreme case : I do not suppose
for a. moment that the Office international
d?Hygiene publique would make such a proposal,
but suppose that the Office international
d?Hygiene publique were to decide that the coca
leaf should be included in Chapter 111 of our
new draft Convention ; such a decision would
place on the Government of a country in which
the coca leaf was produced the responsibility
of controlling its production and distribution so
as to limit them solely to medical and scien-
tific purposes. We know from what has been
said here by the delegates of Bolivia and the
Netherlands that such a situation would be
quite impossible. I do not think that this
Conference can contemplate the adoption of
an article which would lead to such conse-
quences.
In the third place, I am not aware of any
precedent for making a decision of a consul-
tative body of the League, such as the Office
international d?Hygiene publique, binding on
the Members of the League. It seems to me
that the proposal of the Egyptian delegate
would set an entirely new precedent, the conse-
quences of which we cannot foresee but which
might be most dangerous in the future. For
all these reasons, I am afraid that we shall
have to oppose the proposal before us.
May I just add that I regard this Article 10
as a most valuable addition to the Hague
Convention. It provides, for the first time,
machinery by which new drugs can be brought
within the terms of the Convention, and it
would be a great pity we lost this benefit. I
should also like to say that I am quite sure
that any unanimous recommendation of the
Office international d?Hygiene publique would
receive favourable consideration from all the
Governments which are signatories to the Con-
vention. I cannot imagine that any new recom-
mendation, at any rate of the Office international
d?Hygiene publique, would be lightly rejected
by any signatory Party.
The President :
Translation : There are no more speakers on
my list. Does anyone else wish to speak on
Article 10 ?
M. Carriere, delegate of Switzerland, will
speak.
M. Carriere (Switzerland)
Translation : I want to make a proposal in
the event of M. El Guindy?s motion being
rejected. Must I submit this proposal now
or wait until a vote has been taken on M. El
Guindy?s resolution ?
The President
Translation : It would perhaps be better for
you to wait ; we will first settle the Egyptian
amendment. I cannot follow the usual pro-
cedure, since, according to the rules which we
have hitherto observed, I ought first to take
a vote on the article itself and then on the
Egyptian amendment. But if I do this, I
would not be able to take into consideration
the Spanish amendment nor the one which
has just been announced. For these reasons I
will ask you to pronounce independently on the
Egyptian amendment.
On being put to the vote, the Egyptian amend-
ment was rejected by 17 votes to 2.
The President
Translation : We must now take a vote on
the amendment submitted by the Spanish
delegation. This amendment consists in sub-
stituting the figure 2 for the figure 10 in the
first line of the third paragraph.
Has M. Carriere?s amendment any connection
with the Spanish amendment ? If so, I will
ask him to bring forward immediately.
SVI. Carriere (Switzerland)
Translation : Yes, the amendment which I
wish to propose is connected with the Spanish
amendment. In the text submitted to you by
Sub-Committee F, we mentioned the figure
of ten Powers. The honourable Spanish
delegate wishes us to be content with two Powers.
As a matter of fact, neither the figure 10 nor
the figure 2 has anything decisive in its favour.
Accordingly, it would be better to have a more
general provision, not fixing the number of
Powers. I would like to submit the following
amendment ;
?The provisions of the present Conven-
tion shall be immediately applicable to
the substance in question as far as the rela-
tions between States which have accepted
the recommendation referred to in the
above paragraphs are concerned.?
This wording might perhaps be slightly
modified. We therefore have a general provision
which, instead of speaking of two, four, six,
sixteen Powers, confines itself to mentioning the
Powers which accept the recommendation,
without any other proviso.
The President
Translation : M. Perrot, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.


IV!. Perrot (France)
Translation : As Rapporteur of Sub-Com-
mittee F I would like to say that, when we
accepted the paragraph in question on the
suggestion of the British delegation, the idea in
our minds was to safeguard national sovereignty.
In consequence, any text submitted by a mem-
ber of the Conference which takes this principle
into account will be acceptable to Sub-Com-
mittee F.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : As far as I can see, we have
not two proposals before us but one proposal
expressed in two different ways. It was because
I wished to safeguard national sovereignty that
I proposed to reduce to two the number of
Contracting Parties which would have to notify
the Secretary-General of their acceptance of the
recommendation laying down that the provi-
sions of the present Convention shall apply,
as between the Contracting Parties, to the sub-
stance in question. As the paragraph stands,
two, three, four and up to nine Contracting
Parties wishing to accept a recommendation
of the competent bodies might find themselves
unable to do so because the proper number
of ten had not been reached. This consti-
tutes a limitation of the sovereign rights of
States, and, consequently, I consider that Con-
tracting Parties wishing to adopt the recom-
mendation ought to be free to do so.
The amendment proposed by M. Carriere
seems to me to be based on the same idea. It
departs from the wording proposed by the
Drafting Committee, but I consider that his
text is more correct. I repeat therefore that
we have not two proposals before us but one
proposal worded in two different ways.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
I quite accept the suggestion which has been
made by M. Carriere.
The President
Translation : We. only have one amend-
ment to consider, then/ I think that the
Conference can now adopt Article 10 with the reser-
vation that the paragraph in question should
be revised by the Drafting Committee, which
will have to find the best formula, taking into
account the suggestions contained in the two
amendments.
M. Carriere, delegate of Switzerland, will
address the Conference.
M. Carriere (Switzerland) :
Translation : I am very sorry to take up
the precious time of the Conference, but there
is another point to which I wish to revert.
I am encouraged to do so by the precedent
which was created yesterday. After 48 hours
had twice been given for reflection, we were
told : ?We have changed our minds and we
want the decision taken two days ago to be
reconsidered??.
The point I would like to go back to affects
both Article 4, paragraph (/), and Article 10.
Yesterday we accepted for paragraph (/)
of Article 4 an extremely elastic formula,
which makes no specification, and which has
taken the place of the text submitted to you
by Sub-Committee F. After hardly 24 hours?
reflection, I think it necessary, not now as a
member of the Sub-Committee F but as the
Swiss Federal Government?s delegate, to revert,
at least as far as I myself am concerned, to
this point. I consider that the formula which
we have adopted is too elastic.
I have already spoken of the apprehensions
to which a formula of this kind might give rise
in certain circles, and I gave you an example
of these apprehensions. I reminded you that
one of the delegations at this Conference would
have liked to bring codein within the scope
of the Convention. It was in thinking of this
example that I became impressed by the fact
that our formula was perhaps excessively
elastic and might lead to certain abuses in its
application.
Consequently, I would like to ask, on behalf
of the Swiss delegation, that we should go
back, if possible, to the text originally proposed
by Sub-Committee F. If this is impossible
i.e., if the Conference decides to maintain the
wording which it has adopted for Article 4,
and which, in my opinion, affects to some
extent Article 10 I wish to state that we
consider this formula as not sufficiently defi-
nite to prevent certain abuses and that we
cannot accept the introduction on any pretext
of codein into the Convention, since it is not a
narcotic.
Should the Conference be unwilling to revert
to this point, I would like the formal decla-
ration I have made on behalf of the Swiss
delegation to be brought to the notice of the
Conference.
The President
Translation : I have no objection to such a
procedure if the Conference wishes to return
to this point. I must say, however, that I
do not quite see the force of the Swiss dele-
gate?s reasoning. The other day we did not
go back on a decision which had been taken
at the first reading but only on a passage in a
report. Here we should have to change a
decision taken at the first reading, i.e., during
the most important part of our work.
IVI. Carriere (Switzerland) :
Translation : I withdraw my argument which
is called in question by the President, but I
maintain the substance of my remarks.
IVI. de Myttenaere (Belgium)
Translation : I would like to remind M.
Carriere that he himself submitted an amend-
ment providing full guarantees in regard to the
inclusion of new narcotics and that it is hardly
for him to call in question the efficacy of his
own proposal now that the Conference has
adopted it.
The President
Translation : M. El Guindy, delegate of
Egypt, will address the Conference.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : Before the discussion on this
article is closed, I would like to make a remark.
I had hoped that the international Convention
which we are preparing would be binding on
all the members which signed it, but Article 10,
as at present drafted, binds no one. I do not
see why we should discuss the possibility of


States concluding arrangements amongst them- has not yet finished its- wo *k* *? oif
selves. Obviously, we cannot prevent countries fore ask you to postpone the discussion t
from concluding a Convention, as regards the chapter I hope we shall be ableA) deal wit
restrictions which we have adopted, or even as
regards more severe restrictions, on any nar-
cotics which may be discovered in the future.
The President
Translation : The debate is closed.
IVI. Cam ere (Switzerland) :
Translation : Excuse me. 1 made a pro-
posal that, we should revert to a previous
point. Notwithstanding the remarks which my
good friend M. de Myttenaere has just addressed
to me, I would like my proposal to be voted
on, i. e., that the Conference should decide
whether it wishes to revert to this point or not.
If it pronounces against the proposal, I will
not press the point.
The President
Translation : I will ask the Conference to
pronounce upon the Swiss delegate?s proposal
to re-open the debate.
The proposal was rejected.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : I was the only one to rise,
not only because I was in favour of the pro-
posal but because it was clearly my duty to
support a proposal made by M. Carriere on
behalf of the Swiss delegation.
I quite understand that the Conference does
not want to re-open the discussion on para-
graph (/) of Article 4, but I must recall the fact
that, when this part of the Article was being
discussed, I formally reserved the right to raise
the question again if Article 10 were modified.
In pursuance of a proposal by the Spanish
delegate, you decided which did not neces-
sarily go without saying that the first para-
graph of Article 10 should be brought into line
with Article 4, paragraph (/). I have therefore
a formal right to discuss the first paragraph
of Article 10, the debate on which is not closed.
Availing myself of this right, I wish to state,
on behalf of the Swiss delegation, that it re-
nounces its proposal for an amendment, but
that it does so because it is satisfied that the
distinguished members of the two organisations
in question will only make recommendations
which are based on the most conclusive evi-
dence, and because, under these conditions, we
can be certain in advance that their decisions
will always represent, if not the unanimous
opinion, at least the nearly unanimous opinion
of those organisations.
M. Perrot (France) ;
Translation : I wish to support the Swiss
delegation?s declaration, with which I am in
entire agreement.
The President
Translation : The debate is closed. Article
10 is adopted and referred to the Drafting
Committee.
Article 10 was adopted at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.

Article 11.
The President :
Translation : The Sub-Committee which you
constituted yesterday to examine this question

Chapter V: Control of International Trade.
Article 12.
The text of Article 12 was read as follows :
?Each Contracting Party shall require
a separate import authorisation, stating the
quantity to be imported, the name and
address of the importer and the name and
address of the exporter, to be obtained for
each importation of any of the substances
to which the present Convention applies.
?The import authorisation shall specify
the period within which the importation
must be effected and may allow the impor-
tation in more than one consignment.
The President
Translation : dhe debate on Article 12 is
open.
If no delegate wishes to speak, I declare
Article 12 adopted.
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands)
Article 12 mentions a form of import cer-
tificate. I have not yet seen such a form. Is it
the same as has been annexed to the report of
Sub-Committee E ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire),
Rapporteur :
I think M. van Wettum must be referring to
Article 13. The form of import certificate
referred to in Article 13 was intended to be the
form of certificate annexed to the report of
Sub-Committee E.
Article 12 was adopted at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article 13.
The text of Article 13 was read as follows :
?1. Each Contracting Party shall re-
quire a separate export authorisation to
be obtained for each exportation of any
of the substances to which the present
Convention applies, stating the quantity
to be exported, the name and address of
the exporter and the name and address of
the importer.
?2. The Contracting Party, before issu-
ing such export authorisation, shall require
an import certificate, issued by the Govern-
ment of the importing country and certi-
fying that the importation is approved, to
be produced by the person applying for
the export authorisation.
?Each Contracting Party agrees to adopt,
so far as possible, the form of import
certificate annexed to the present Con-
vention.
?3. The export authorisation shall spe-
cify the period within which the exporta-
tion must be effected.
?4. A copy of the export authorisation
shall accompany the consignment, and the
Government issuing the export authori-
sation shall send a copy to the Government
of the importing country.
?5. The Government of the importing
country, when the importation has been


effected, or when the period fixed for the
importation has expired, shall return the
export authorisation, with an endorsement
to that effect, to the Government of the
exporting country, the endorsement shall
specify the amount actually received.
?6. If a less quantity than that specified
m the export authorisation is actually
exported, the quantity actually exported
shall be noted by the competent authori-
ties on the export authorisation and on
any official copy thereof.
7- In the case of an application to
export a consignment to any country for
the purpose of being placed in a bonded
warehouse in that country, a special cer-
tificate from the Government of that coun-
try, certifying that it has approved the
introduction of the consignment for the
said purpose, may be accepted by the
Government of the exporting country in
place of the import certificate provided for
above. In such a case the export autho-
risation shall specify that the consignment
is exported for the purpose of being placed
in a bonded warehouse."
The President
Translation: An amendment has been proposed
by the Spanish delegation to insert the following
sentence in this article wherever the Drafting
Committee may deem it convenient :
"Every export authorisation must show
the number, date and duration of the cor-
responding import authorisation, and must
mention the authorities issuing the latter."
Sir Malcolm Delevingne, delegate of the
British Empire, will address the Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
Rapporteur :
I am not quite sure whether the Government
of the exporting country which gives the export
authorisation will have the information which
is mentioned in this amendment. If I understand
the amendment rightly, it would require
the Government of the exporting country to
insert in the export authorisation the number
and date of the import licence granted by the
Government of the importing country and the
period for which the import authorisation or
licence was valid.
I am not sure, however, that, at the time
when it grants the export licence, the exporting
country would always have a copy of the import
licence before it. Ihere is no provision in
our scheme for a copy of the import licence to
be sent to the Government of the exporting
country; all the importing country has to
do is to send a copy of the import certificate,
which is not necessarily the same thing as the
import authorisation. I know that in some
countries they are the same thing, but in most
countries, I think, the import certificate is
different from the import licence. The Govern-
ment of the exporting country, therefore,
would not always have the information which
is mentioned in this amendment.
1 am afraid, therefore, that I do not see my way,
as far as I am concerned, to accept the amend-
ment at the moment ; but, if the Spanish
delegate would be content, I should be glad
to think over it, and if I could see my way to
add anything to the text of Article 13 to meet
his wishes, I should, of course, be glad to do so.
Translation : M. de Palacios delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : I hope that, after reflection,
the Rapporteur will accept, if not the letter
of my amendment, at least its spirit. The
second paragraph of Article 13 says :
?The Contracting Party, before issuing
such export authorisation, shall require
an import certificate, issued by the Govern-
ment of the importing country and certi-
fying that the importation is approved, to
be produced by the person applying for
the export authorisation."
All the data which I specified in my amend-
ment would probably therefore be indicated to
the Government which was asked to send the
export certificate. This, however, is not the
point to which I attach most importance ;
the important thing, in my opinion, is above all,
that the import certificate should correspond
to the export certificate. The import certi-
ficate may be made out for a given quantity
of goods to be exported in one or several con-
signments. Hence I would like a sort of credit
account to be established. Each export cer-
tificate should bear a special reference to the
corresponding import certificate, otherwise it
might be changed on the way or given out as
corresponding to another import certificate.
I think that in principle we are in agreement, as
my amendment is merely intended to make good
a slight omission in Article 13.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
1 understand the meaning of the Spanish
delegate?s amendment now, and I am quite
willing that the export authorisation should
contain a reference to the import certificate
issued by the Government of the importing
country. lam not quite sure how that should
be worded, but if the Spanish delegate would
leave it to the Drafting Committee to settle,
I will see that the matter is dealt with there.
M. de Palacios (Spain) ;
Translation : I shall be very glad to accept
your proposal.
The President
1 ranslation : If no one else wishes to speak
on Article 13, it will be referred to the Drafting
Committee to deal with on the lines just indi-
cated.
Article 13 was adopted at the first reading
and referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article 14.
The text of Article 14 was read as follows :
"For the purpose of ensuring the full
application and enforcement of the provi-
sions of the present Convention in free ports
and free zones, the Contracting Parties
undertake to apply in free ports and free
zones situated within their territories the
same laws and regulations, and to exercise
therein the same supervision and control,
The President :


in respect of the substances covered by the is explained in the report of the
p "? - ? BBS
territories.
?This Article does not, however, pre-
vent any Contracting Party from applying,
in respect of the said substances, more
drastic provisions in its free ports and free
zones than in other parts of its territories.??
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Dendramis,
delegate of Greece, to speak.
IVi. Dendramis (Greece):
Translation : I wish to make a short state-
ment regarding this article on behalf of my
Government. .
The Opium Conference, in all the texts which
it has prepared, has necessarily been obliged to
confine itself to general principles and has not
been able to provide for the case, of which there
are several examples, of harbours in which
certain zones are set aside for the exclusive use
of the international traffic of a State other
than the State possessing territorial sovereignty.
It is evident that the Opium Convention can
only be applied in these zones by collaboration
between the territorial authorities and the
authorities of the State having the use of the
said harbour zone.
IVI. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats
and Slovenes) :
Translation : On behalf of my Government,
I associate myself with the declaration which
M. Dendramis has just made.
The President
Translation : The declarations of the Greek
and Serb-Croat-Slovene delegates will be
entered in the records.
M. Dinichert, delegate of Switzerland, will
address the Conference.
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : I have only one suggestion
to make, which calls, perhaps, for some redraft-
ing. In the first paragraph of Article 14 we
read that ?the Contracting Parties undertake
to apply in free ports and free zones situated
within their territories the same laws and regu-
ln the second paragraph we read, ?This article,
however, does not prevent any Contracting
Party from applying, in respect of the same
substances, more drastic provisions in its
free ports and free zones than in other parts of
its territories.??
It is difficult to see what more drastic pi �vi-
sions can be applied in a country than those
contained in the laws and regulations of that
country, and, on referring to the report of
Sub-Committee E, I wondered whether the
object of this second paragraph is not, in fact
to prohibit absolutely the introduction of
these substances into the free ports. If tins
is the case, the Drafting Committee could no
doubt find a wording which would meet the
situation better.
The President
Translation : Does the Rapporteur wish to
make any remarks ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
The paragraph under discussion was inserted
to meet the particular case of Italy. The point
cti iwcc uivi . ?, r
covered by this Convention into its free ports.
The actual drafting, however, can quite well
be referred back to the Drafting Committee to
consider. I should have thought at first sight that
it was desirable to leave the text in the general
form already adopted by the Drafting Committee
so as to provide for a possible alternative to
complete prohibition. But I am quite pre-
pared to accept M. Dinichert?s proposition that
the Drafting Committee should reconsider the
point.
The President
Translation : Is M. Dinichert satisfied ?
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland):
Translation : Quite.
Article 14 was adopted at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article i -
The text of Article 15 was read as follows :
?1. No consignment of any of the sub-
stances covered by the present Convention
which is exported from one country to
another country shall be permitted to pass
through the territory of a third country,
whether or not it is removed from the
ship or conveyance in which it is being
conveyed, unless the copy of the export
authorisation (or the diversion certificate,
if such a certificate has been issued in
pursuance of the following paragraph) which
accompanies the consignment is produced to
the competent authorities of that country.
?2. The competent authorities of any
country through whose territory a consign-
ment of any of the substances covered by
the present Convention is permitted to
pass shall take all due measures to prevent
the oiversion of the consignment to a
destination other than that named in the
copy of the export authorisation (or the
diversion certificate) which accompanies
it, unless the Government of that country
has authorised that diversion by means of
a special diversion certificate. A diversion
certificate shall only be issued after the
receipt of an import certificate, in accord-
ance with Article 13, from the Government
of the country to which it is proposed to
divert the consignment, and shall contain
the same particulars as are required by
Article 13 to be stated in an export autho-
risation, together with the name of the
country from which the consignment was
originally exported ; and all the provisions
of Article 13 which are applicable to an
export authorisation shall be applicable
equally to the diversion certificate.
?Further, the Government of the country
authorising the diversion of the consign-
ment shall detain the copy of the original
export authorisation (or diversion certi-
ficate) which accompanied the consignment
on arrival in its territory, and shall return
it to the Government which issued it, at the
same time notifying the name of the countiy
to which the diversion has been authorised.
?3. In cases where the transport is
being effected by air, the preceding provi


sions of this Article shall not be applicable
if the aircraft passes over the territory of
the third country without landing/ If
the aircraft lands in the territory of the
said country, the said provisions shall be
applied so far as the circumstances permit.
?4. Paragraphs 1 to 3 of this Article
are without prejudice to the provisions
of any international agreement which limits
the control which may be exercised by any
of the Contracting Parties over the sub-
stances to which the present Convention
applies when in direct transit.
?5. The provisions of this Article shall
not apply to transport of the substances by
post.?
Article 15 was adopted at the first reading,
without discussion, and referred to the Drafting
Committee.
Article 16.
The text of Article 16 was read as follows :
"A consignment of any of the substances
covered by the present Convention which
is landed in the territory of any Contracting
Party and placed in a bonded warehouse
shall not be withdrawn from the bonded
warehouse unless an import certificate,
issued by the Government of the country
of destination and certifying that the impor-
tation is approved, is produced to the autho-
rities having jurisdiction over the bonded
warehouse. A special authorisation shall
be issued by the said authorities in respect
of each consignment so withdrawn and
shall take the place of the export authori-
sation for the purpose of Articles 13, 14, 15
above.?
Article 16 was adopted at the first reading,
without discussion, and referred to the Drafting
Committee.
Article 17.
The text of Article 17 was read as follows :
?No consignment of the substances
covered by the present Convention while
passing in transit through the territories
of any Contracting Party or whilst being
stored there in a bonded warehouse may
be subject to any process which would
alter the nature of the substances in ques-
tion or, without the permission of the
competent authorities, the packing.?
Article 17 was adopted at the first reading,
without discussion, and referred to the Drafting
Committee.
Article 18.
The text of Article 18 was read as follows ;
If any Contracting Party finds it
impossible to apply any provision of this
Chapter to trade with another country
by reason of the fact that such country is
not a party to the present Convention,
such Contracting Party will only be bound
to apply the provisions of this Chapter so
far as the circumstances permit. It shall,
however, take all measures within its
power to secure that the objects of the
present Chapter are fulfilled so far as cir-
cumstances permit, and, in particular, to
prevent the country which is not a party
to the present Convention becoming a
centre of the illicit traffic.?
The President
Translation : I call upon M. van Wettum,
delegate of the Netherlands, to speak.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands) ;
I am very sorry to say that I cannot agree
with the last sentence of this article, as it lays
a very heavy obligation on every nation which
it will be difficult or impossible to fulfil. More-
over, this very task has been entrusted expli-
citly , in Article 26, to the Central Board, this article
says that if any non-Contracting Party appears to
become a centre of illicit traffic the Board will
advise all Contracting Parties and recommend
them not to export any narcotics to that country.
If we accept Article 26, as we should, it seems
better for all nations to await the recommenda-
tion of the Board and not to start any measures
of the kind described in Articles 24 and 26 on
its own account before the Board has had the
opportunity of examining the matter and of
taking action.
It might also be pointed out that the obli-
gations of Article 18 are much heavier than those
of Article 26, which leaves the decision, whether
or not a recommendation of the Board should
be acted on, to the discretion of the Contracting?
Parties.
For all these reasons I propose to leave out
the last sentence of Article 18.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I am very sorry that M. van Wettum has felt
obliged to raise this point, which we have dis-
cussed more than once in private. The object
of the article is clear. We cannot expect, at
any rate for some time, that all the countries
of the world will become parties to this Conven-
tion. There may be certain countries which
are standing outside the Convention and which
are not prepared to adopt the system of import
and export licences and import certificates.
The question then arises : What is to happen
in the case of exports from a country which is
a Party to the Convention to a country which
is not a Party ? No import certificate will be
delivered by a country which is not a Party.
Is the exporting country which is a Party to
the Convention to export these drugs in any
quantities which the importing country may
request ?
Sub-Committee E felt that we could not
deal with such a position by any definite pro-
vision in the Convention itself, but that there
was a moral obligation on the exporting country
not to allow the export in excessive quantities,
to countries which declined to furnish import
certificates and to co-operate with the rest of the
world in the system of international control and
which are likely therefore to become centres of
illicit traffic,
Now, while we could not put a definite pro-
vision in the Convention to deal with those
cases, we thought it was desirable to embody in
some from of words the view which I think
was shared by every member of the Sub-Com-
mittee, and this last sentence, to which M.
van Wettum objects, is the attempt of the


Drafting Committee to give effect to that idea.
I should be very sorry to see that sentence
abandoned altogether. I think it lays down
or embodies a principle which we all agreed, in
the Sub-Committee at any rate, to accept, and
which it seems to me valuable to leave on
record.
If the wording is open to criticism, and I
dare say it is, the Drafting Committee is quite
prepared to reconsider it. I shall be glad,
therefore, if M. van Wettum will allow us
a further trial to see if we can produce some-
thing which will satisfy his exacting taste.
May I add one word ? M. van Wettum
referred to the fact that the Central Board would
in future be able to control the exports in these
cases. The Central Board will only be able
to interfere after the damage has been done.
The moral obligation to which we refer here
is to help to prevent the damage ever being
done. In other words, we shall be shutting
the door before the horse is stolen.
ML van Wettum (Netherlands) ;
May I point out to Sir Malcolm Delevingne
that in Article 26 the Board will take action
"if the information at the disposal of the Board
leads it to conclude that there is a danger of
the country becoming a centre of the illicit
traffic?, so that at the moment there is no
harm done. Why do we go further in Arti-
cle 18 than in Articles 24 and 26 ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
I do not think we do, but I repeat my sugges-
tion that the article should be referred back to
the Drafting Committee.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
I accept.
The President
Translation : This solution is all very well
for the moment, but if M. van Wettum
maintains his point of view the same discussion
will come up again at the second reading.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
Perhaps M. van Wettum will assist the Draft-
ing Committee when it comes to consider this
point.
M. Sjostrand (Sweden) :
May I call attention to the fact that Article 18
is intended to serve as a guide to the Contracting
Parties and Article 26 is intended to serve as
a guide to the Central Board ? That summa-
rises, I think, the difference between those
two articles.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands) ;
Mr. President, the difference to me is that
Article 18 is not acceptable to me, whereas
Article 26 is acceptable. That is the great
difference.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : M. Sjostrand?s last remark
prompts me to say a word. I agree with
M. van Wettum?s objections, but I am confident
that the very competent members of the Draft-
ing Committee will find a solution.
I do not think, however, that the remarks of
our Swedish colleague are likely to dispel
M. van Wettum?s apprehensions, but we neec.
not consider here how the Board is going to
work ; it will work in whatever way it thinks
fit. What we have to consider is how our
own Governments will exeicise their influence
on others. If Article 26 is accepted, we should
still have serious misgivings regarding the
new Article 18.
M. Sjostrand (Sweden) ;
I made my remark because 1 understood
M. van Wettum to say that Article 26 would
serve more or less as a substitute for Article 18.
The President
Translation : Are there any other remarks
on Article 18 ? ,
If there are no other remarks, Article 18 will
be referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article 18 was adopted at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.
Chapter VI : Permanent Central Board.
Article 19.
The text of Article 19 was read as follows :
"A Permanent Central Board shall
be appointed, within three months from
the coming into force of the present
Convention, by such of the following States
as have at that time ratified the Convention
that is to say, the United States of
America, the British Empire, France, Ger-
many, Italy and Japan together with
those States which have non-permanent
seats on the Council of the League. It
shall consist of seven persons who, by
their technical competence, impartiality
and disinterestedness, are likely to com-
mand general confidence, chosen from a
list on which each of the signatories of the
Convention shall be entitled to place one
name. The members shall be appointed for
a term of three years, and they will be
eligible for re-appointment.
"At meetings of the Board, four members
shall form a quorum.
?The decisions of the Board relative to
Articles 24 and 26 shall be taken by an
absolute majority of the whole number of
the Board.
"The Board shall settle its rules of pro-
cedure.
The President
Translation : M. Chodzko, delegate of
Poland, will address the Conference.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : lam glad that we have come
at last to Article 19. In my opinion it is one
of the most important articles in the new Con-
vention, as it provides for the strict application
of its provisions by a new body for which we
have no precedent. We must therefore analyse
the text of this article very closely, and in this
connection I would like to make a few remarks.
In the first place, I would like to make a
proposal, which perhaps will not meet with
much opposition, regarding the name of this
new body. The text of Article 19 calls it a
Permanent Central Board. This designation
is all very well, but it does not indicate the pur-
pose of the Board. I therefore propose that
we should add to the name the words "for the
control of narcotics?.
I would also like to make some further
observations on this article, particularly regard-


mg the composition and definition of this factoring countries must also be represented
eimanent Central Board, ihe latter, according on the Board, but I think that the formula
to Article 19, will consist of persons who, by
their technical competence, impartiality and
disinterestedness, are likely to command general
confidence. In my opinion this definition is
much too vague.
What, for example, does the word ?impar-
tiality? mean in this connection ? Are people
?impartial? who share the American views or
those of the majority in the Advisory Committee
on the Traffic in Opium ? Or are people impartial
who have no definite opinion at all ? I would
like the exact meaning of the word ?impar-
tiality? to be defined.
Further, what does the word ?disinte-
restedness? mean ? Of what or of whom are the
members of the Board to be independent ?
The article also says that these persons will be
?chosen? from a list submitted by the signa-
tory Powers. Each Government will there-
fore nominate one person. Will that person
be independent of his Government ? I do
not think so.
In the Co-ordination Committee we were told
that, in choosing the members of the Board,
Governments must not be guided by their
interests but by highest principles. But
if a Government appoints a person to represent
it, how can you expect this person not to defend
the interests of his Government ? In fact, it is
his duty to do so. What, then, are we to think
of the disinterestedness of this person ? The
definition of the term ?independence? or
?disinterestedness? is therefore quite as neces-
sary as that of the term ?impartiality?.
To take an example ; the forty Powers
represented here will send forty names to the
Council of the League from which it will have
to choose seven. How is the Council to make
the appointment ? If no principle is laid down
by us the Council of the League of Nations will
find itself in a difficult position and, whatever
its choice may be, I fear it may be criticised
by many of the Members of the League. It
must be admitted that this duty which Article 19
lays upon the Council of the League is no envia-
ble one. Are we justified in putting the Council
into this position ? Ido not think we ought
to do so or to expose the prestige of the League
of Nations to adverse criticism.
For these reasons I have already proposed
in Sub-Committee B a ?principle of selection?.
If I am not mistaken, Sub-Committee D also
discussed the question. I suggested that a prin-
ciple should be adopted which would save
the Council from the dilemma of which I have
just spoken. For this reason I propose an
amendment to Article 19. Instead of saying,
It (the Central Board) shall consist of seven
persons. . .? we should say, ?It shall consist of
eight persons, four appointed by countries
which produce or manufacture narcotics and
four by consuming countries.?
What groups of States will the Council have
to consider when it makes its choice ? There
are the producing countries, the manufacturing
countries and the countries which are merely
consumers. This last group of States has a
great interest in the question. They derive
no profit from the traffic in narcotics but suffer
all the dangers and disadvantages. If these
countries sign the Convention, they must be
represented on the Central Board.
Of course, the producing countries and manu-
on the Board, but I think that the formula
which I have proposed brings in all these three
groups of countries.
There is one other point to which I wish to
draw your attention.
Who will be the Chairman of the Board ?
Is he to be appointed by the Council outside
the Board or will he be elected by the Board
itself ? I think this point ought also to be
made clear.
As regards the term of office of the members
of the Central Board, the period of three years
is stipulated. But if the members of the Board
are required to be ?disinterested? they should
be given a term of five years instead of three
years.
Such is the substance of my proposal, which
I will hand in to the President.
The President
Translation : I suppose that, as a conse-
quence of the Polish delegate?s proposal, the
quorum would be five members instead of
four ?
m. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation : Allow me to draw your atten-
tion to the fact that among the States which are
going to nominate the Central Board there is
no producing country. I think that it would
be only right to add at least one representative
of the producing States to these countries.
The President
7 r anslation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : I think it would be advisable
to read the amendments which I have had the
honour to communicate to the Chair.
All that I have to say for the moment with
regard to this article refers to the first paragraph.
The Spanish delegation considers that this
first paragraph should read as follows :
?A Permanent Central Board shall be
appointed, within three months of the
coming into force of the present Convention,
by the Council of the League of Nations in
agreement with the Governments of Ger-
many and the United States of America.?
This text is the one which the Spanish dele-
gation prefers, but if serious objections are
raised we will propose the following alterna-
tive :
?The Permanent Central Board shall
be appointed, within three months of the
coming into force of the present Convention,
by the States represented on the Council
of the League and by Germany and the
United States of America.?
The President
Translation : Are there any other proposals
regarding the constitution of this body ?
IVI. Dendramis (Greece) :
Translation : The Greek delegation is also
of the opinion that the interests of the producing
countries should be safeguarded, and I therefore
wish to second the proposal put forward by the
honourable Polish delegate.


M. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation : If the Polish delegate?s motion
is adopted, I will withdraw my proposal, as the
interests of the producing countries will be
sufficiently safeguarded.
The President
Translation : I propose that the meeting
should be adjourned for twenty minutes in
order to allow the delegates to confer on the dis-
cussion which has just taken place.
(The meeting was adjourned at 5 p.m. and
resumed at 5-3� p- m -)
The President
Translation Before the discussion is i�e-
opened, I should like to make one remark. The
report with which we are dealing has already
been accepted in principle and referred to the
Drafting Committee, but now various points
have been raised with regard to this report.
I venture to point out that the usual procedure
is exactlv the opposite ; observations should
be submitted first, then the report should be
adopted and referred to the Drafting Committee.
I merely make the remark, as we cannot, of
course, change anything now.
Does the Rapporteur wish to answer now
the different proposals and suggestions made
by the Polish, Serb-Croat-Slovene and Spanish
delegates ?
IVi. van Eckardt (Germany) :
Translation : Mr. President, I reserve the
right to make a proposal also, which I will
submit later.
The President
Translation : I call upon Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne, delegate of the British Empire, to
speak.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
The Conference, as I understand it, has three
sets of amendments before it. First, there is the
series of amendments proposed by the Polish
delegate. Three of these amendments refer
to minor matters and one to a matter of great
importance. I will deal with the minor matters
first.
The Polish delegate suggested that the title
?Permanent Central Board for the Control of
Narcotic Drugs? should be given to this Board
which we are proposing to set up under Article
19. The Drafting Committee considered rather
carefully how it should describe this Central
Board and found it very difficult to suggest any
title which exactly described the functions and
scope of the Board. It therefore contented
itself with the very short title which appears
at the head of Chapter VI, ?Permanent Central
Board?, and I think, on the whole, it is best
to leave it at that.
The title suggested by the Polish delegate
would not, I think, be an accurate description
of the work and functions of the Board. The
Board is not charged under this scheme with
the general control of narcotic drugs
very far from it. Its powers are precisely
defined in Article 24. Article 24 says that the
functions of the Board shall be to watch con-
tinuously the course of the international trade,
to call attention to any cases in which excessive
quantities are being imported into any country
and in such cases to make recommendations
to the Governments signatories to the Conven-
tlC>That is a limited power, which is very far
from being a general control of narcotic drugs,
and I think, therefore, that it would be mislead-
ing if we adopted the suggestion of the Polish
delegate and called this Board the ?Permanent
Central Board for the Control of Narcotic
Drugs?. I think that it might cause some
misapprehension in the minds of Governments
and in the minds of those likely to be affected
by the Convention if such a name were given
to the Board. It would imply far stronger
powers than those which we actually propose
in the Convention. I would therefore suggest
to the Conference that that amendment should
not be accepted.
The Polish delegate also proposes to insert
at the end of the first paragraph the words,
?The Central Board shall elect its own President.
We thought that was implied ; the Central
Board is given power to settle its rules of pro-
cedure. But lam quite prepared to accept the
addition suggested by the Polish delegate.
Then he also suggests that the term of years
for which the members of the Central Board are
to be appointed should be five years and not
three. There was some discussion on that
point in the Sub-Committee. Some difference
of opinion was expressed, and, if I remember
rightly, the term of five years was originally
adopted, but in deference to the objections of
one or more delegates, the term of three years
was substituted. But I am quite prepared to
accept the term of five years if no objection is
raised by the delegations in the Conference.
Now we come to the very important question
which has been raised by the Polish delegate
as to the constitution of the Central Board,
and, in this connection, I must join with the
President in his expression of regret that this
question was not raised at the time when the
report of Sub-Committee A came before the
plenary Conference.
The question is one of substance which has a
very important bearing on the work of the
Central Board and the scheme of control which
is contained in Chapter VI, and it ought to
have been discussed fully at the plenary meeting
when the Conference had before it the report
of Sub-Committee A. No objection was raised
at that time, however, and no reservations, if
I remember rightly, were made on this point,
and the Conference unanimously adopted the
report of Sub-Committee A.
The proposal of the Polish delegate brings
forward again a suggestion that was made in
the report of Sub-Committee D to the effect that
the Central Board should be composed 0
equal numbers of representatives of the con-
suming countries on the one side and the pro-
ducing and the manufacturing countries on the
other. The suggestion was considered at the
meeting of the Co-ordination Committee, and tie
Chairman and the Rapporteur of Sub-Commit iee
D withdrew the proposal of Sub-Committee
in favour of the proposal of Sub-Committee
The proposal of Sub-Committee A therefore
came before the Conference not only as t e
unanimous recommendation of Sub-Commit ee
A but also as the unanimous recommendation 0
the Co-ordination Committee. It seems 0
me, therefore, a very serious thing to ask l e
Conference at this late hour to upset the recoin
296 ??


mendation on this point which has so much tion. Certainly, Viscount Cecil did. The corn-
support behind it.
Ihe reasons why Sub-Committee A felt
unable to accept the proposal for making the
Board representative in equal parts of the con-
suming and the manufacturing and producing
countries are set out in the Sub-Committee?s
report. I would like to read to the Conference
what the Sub-Committee said :
?It is essential that the members of the
Board should be absolutely impartial and
independent on the one hand, and that, on
the other, they should have an expert
knowledge of the matters with which they
will have to deal. Unless they possess
both these qualifications they will not be
able to command the general confidence both
of the countries affected and of the world
at large, on which the success of their
work will depend.
?The Sub-Committee has accordingly
proposed that the members of the Board
shall be persons who, by their technical
competence, impartiality and disinte-
restedness, are likely to command general
confidence, and it has not seen its way to
accept a suggestion that consuming, pro-
ducing and manufacturing countries should
be separately represented on the Board.
It would, in its view, be fatal to the success
of the scheme if the Board were to be re-
presentative of ?interests?.
?It recognises, however, the importance
of preventing any suspicion that the Board
is selected from a particular group of
countries and of ensuring a wide field of
candidates from which the electoral body
can make its choice, and it has accordingly
accepted the proposal that the selection
shall be made from a list on which every
signatory of the Convention would have
the right to place one name. The Sub-
Committee must emphasise the importance,
however, of the signatory Governments,
in the exercise of this right, taking the
greatest care to put forward only the names
of persons who possess the qualifications
mentioned above.?
The Polish delegate made some play with the
words ?impartiality? and ?disinterestedness? ;
but I think that this Conference will take the
view that the signification of those words is
fairly well understood and that we need not
quarrel with Sub-Committee A for selecting
those particular words. I think that they
ensure what we all desire, namely, that the
Board should act in an absolutely impartial
way and that it should not be under any sus-
picion of being the mouthpiece of particular
interests but that it should maintain what is
sometimes called an absolutely objective atti-
tude. The proposal of the Committee was the
result of very long discussions. I think that
M. Bourgois will bear me out when I say that
it was with the greatest difficulty and after
prolonged sittings that we came to the unani-
mous-result embodied in the proposal contained
in Chapter VI.
I must say that I view with great fear any
attempt to re-open the question now. On this
particular question, the Ministers who repre-
sented the British Empire and, I think, France
and the Netherlands also at our resumed sittings
took a personal part in the settlement of this ques-
promise embodied in the text of the first
paragraph of Article 19 is the result of that
work. 1 think that to re-open the question
now would land us in all the difficulties we had
to face then and from which we only escaped
with very great difficulty. I would therefore
urge the Conference most strongly to leave the
text of the Article as it stands.
If the text were to be changed in the manner
the Polish delegate suggests the result would be
a Board representative of particular interests,
the interests of the manufacturing and pro-
ducing countries on the one side and the inte-
rests of the consuming countries on the other,
and the feeling which we have tried to create
in the scheme we put before the Conference
would not be secured that is, the feeling
that the Board would be absolutely impartial
and do its work without consideration of any-
thing but the actual merits of the case before
it.
I see also a great practical difficultv in the sug-
gestion which has been made by? the Polish
delegate. His amendment reads :
?The Board shall include eight persons,
of whom four shall be designated by the
producing and manufacturing countries
and four by the consuming countries.?
I ask myself : How are the consuming
countries or the producing and manufacturing
countries to nominate their four represen-
tatives ?
Moreover, let me remind the Polish delegate
that the consuming countries include practically
all the countries of the world; they include the
producing and manufacturing countries. How
are all the countries of the world to appoint
these four representatives on the Central
Board ? Are they to hold a conference every
three or five years in order to proceed to an
election, and what chance is there that if they
did so they would ever arrive at a result which
would be satisfactory to all or even to a large
number of them ? The difficulty as regards
the machinery which this amendment would
involve seems to me alone sufficient to make
it impossible to accept it.
I make another criticism of less importance
which occurs to me. The number proposed
in the amendment is eight. The Board would
have to elect a President. How is a decision
ever to be taken unless the President has a
casting vote ? And the President will have
to be chosen either from the one side or from
the other. It seems to me that the proposed
constitution of the Central Board would lead
to endless difficulties. There would be two
sets of interests balanced against one another,
and I cannot imagine that a Board so constituted
would really fulfil the objects which the Sub-
Committee had in mind when it elaborated the
scheme in this chapter.
I need say nothing more perhaps I have
said too much about that proposal.
Two other proposals have been put before us.
One was made by the delegate of the Kingdom
of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. He criti-
cised the composition of the Board as contained
in Article 19 on the ground that it contained
no representative of the producing countries.
Well, the electoral body really consists, although
it is a little disguised, of the Council of the
League of Nations plus the United States of


America and Germany, and I think that we international conferences. I must therefore
may take it the Sub-Committee thought
that we might take it - that such a body would
be perfectly independent, would have regard
to all the circumstances of the case and would
choose a central Board which would be as inde-
pendent and impartial as it is possible in human
affairs to obtain.
If a representative of the producing countries
were to be added, I find it very difficult to ima-
gine how he would be selected. Is he to be a
representative of the opium-producing countries
or a representative of the coca-leaf-producing
countries ? Moreover, if that suggestion is consi-
dered favourable, there must be a represen-
tative of the manufacturing countries also.
Although it is true that the electoral body
includes countries in which these manufactures
are carried on, not all the manufacturing coun-
tries are represented. If we once get into that
path we shall find ourselves up against very
great difficulties. All things considered, I
su gg es t that we should adhere to the recom-
mendation of the Sub-Committee which was a
result, as I said just now, of very long discus-
sions and was finally its unanimous conclusion.
Then there was the suggestion of the dele-
gate for Spain. He has presented us with
an alternative. I gather that he did not
lay very much stress on his first proposal
that the nominations to the Central Board
should be made by the Council of the League
in agreement with the Governments of Germany
and the United States. I am not quite sure
what the words ?in agreement with? would
mean. I suppose that they would mean that
the United States and Germany could veto
any suggestion the Council of the League of
Nations made.
I should prefer, if the Conference decided in
favour of one or other of the Spanish proposals,
to adopt the second. This proposal makes the
States represented on the Council, together with
the United States and Germany, one electoral
body, which would discuss the matter and arrive
at an agreement among themselves. The only
reason why we did not adopt in the Sub-Com-
mittee the second suggestion made by the
Spanish delegate was a political reason.
When this matter was before the Sub-Com-
mittee the United States delegation still
formed part of the Conference, and that delegation
thought that it would probably be easier
to get this scheme ratified by the authorities
in the United States if we avoided mentioning
the Council of the League of Nations as such
and put the proposal in the form in which the
Sub-Committee has put it in this text. I do
not know how far that consideration will
weigh with the members of the Conference.
We all desire, of course, that the United States
should adhere eventually to this new Convention,
and I think that we should avoid, if possible,
creating anything which might make it difficult
to secure that adherence.
The President
1 ranslation : M. Chodzko, delegate of
Poland, will address the Conference.
?VI, Chodzko (Poland) ;
Translation : You must excuse me if I
trouble the Conference once more with ques-
tions which the President has so rightly called
questions of principle, but my insistence is
perhaps due to my inexperience of procedure in
beg for your indulgence. lam bound to point
out, however, that in this very Conference, when
a proposal had been adopted in plenary meeting,
we have seen another very important resolution
of principle, contrary to the first, adopted forty-
eight hours afterwards.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne said that I wished to
destroy the balance ; I do not know whether
this is an ungrateful or an agreeable task. In
the case of Article 2 of our Convention, we have
seen that the first French delegate, in order to
preserve the balance, put forward a motion
which we adopted, and two days later M. Kircher,
also delegate of France, proposed a different
motion. Did he, on that account, destroy the
balance established under Article 2 ?
It seems to me that I have the right, at a
first reading, which is not a Drafting Committee
reading but a reading on the substance of the
Convention, to propose amendments ; the more
so as I have received very precise instructions
from my Government and as, in the memoran-
dum which I sent to the Chairmen of the Sub-
Committees, I emphasised the fact that it
was the one condition on which my Government
could accept the creation of the new body.
It therefore seems to me that I am within
my rights if I draw your attention once more
at the eleventh hour, as Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne said to the dangers which may threaten
this Convention in future, if the consuming
countries are not absolutely sure that their
interests will be properly looked after.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne said that it would
be almost impossible to make a choice among
the consuming countries, and asked how con-
suming countries could be distinguished from
producing countries, manufacturing countries,
etc. In my own speech I said that, by consuming
countries, I meant countries which were
neither producing nor manufacturing. We all
know which are the producing countries, and
we also know which of them produce opium
and which produce coca leaves. How will
they be chosen ? It seems to me that the
Council, having before it forty names, twenty
of which, for example, belong to consuming
countries and twenty to producing countries,
will have no difficulty in choosing three or four
from each category. If, for example, a country
producing coca leaves is not chosen at the first
election, it may gain a place at the next one.
As far as interests are concerned, I must empha-
sise once more the fact that if each Govern-
ment submitted its list, this list would be
influenced by that Government?s interests.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne himself said that we
had nothing to fear from the creation of this
body, since all the interests involved were
equitably represented on the Council which
appoints it. Sir Malcolm Delevingne therefore
admits the principle that his interests must
be represented, and I am also of that opinion.
Ihe point is an interesting, a delicate, and a
dangerous one for the interests of us all are
equally at stake here and I want to ask the
members of the Conference to reflect before
taking any decision. If my own or any similar
proposal were rejected, I should be obliged to
make every reservation with regard to
Article 19.
IYI. de Palacios (Spain) :
1 ranslation : I think it would be better not


to mix up the different proposals which have
been made ; we should settle the Polish before
going on to the Spanish proposal, on which I
will speak when the time comes.
The President
Translation : Does any member of the
Conference wish to express an opinion on the
Polish proposals ?
Since no one wishes to speak, we will take
a decision regarding those proposals.
The Rapporteur has accepted two of the
Polish delegate?s four proposals, namely, that
of adding the words ?The Board shall elect
its own Chairman? after the word ?re-appoint-
ment,? and that of substituting "term of five
years? for ?term of three years?.
I presume the Rapporteur is speaking as
representative of the Sub-Committee, and as no
one has spoken against either of these two
proposals, I regard them as adopted. {Assent.)
There remain two other proposals : that
regarding the name of the Board and that regard-
ing the constitution of that body.
I put to the vote the first of these two amend-
ments, consisting in the addition of the words
?for the control of narcotics? after the words
?Central Boara?.
This proposal was rejected by 9 votes to 6.
I put the second amendment to the vote,
namely :
?It (the Central Board) shall consist
of eight persons : four appointed by
countries which produce or manufacture
narcotics and four by consuming countries.?
This amendment was rejected by 13 votes to 10.
IVI. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) ;
Translation : If Article 19 stands as drafted,
I must make every reservation on behalf of
my Government. 1 shall be unable to
accept it.
I reserve the right to put forward a proposal
for the suppression of the Central Board and
for entrusting its task to a section of the Secre-
tariat of the League of Nations.
The President
Translation : This reservation will be
entered in the record of the meeting.
IVlehmed Sureya Bey (Turkey) :
Translation : I wish to make the same reser-
vation as the honourable delegate of the King-
dom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.
The President
Translation : The debate on the Polish
proposal is closed.
I declare the discussion on the two Spanish
proposals open, and I call upon M. de Palacios,
delegate of Spain, to speak.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : In Sub-Committee A, I made
a reservation entitling me to raise this question
in the plenary meeting. When the report was
submitted to the Conference, I was unable,
being unwell, to come and defend my Govern-
ment?s point of view in person, though I sub-
mitted it to the Chairman and Rapporteur.
The proposals submitted to you are alter-
native, but I greatly prefer the first. 1 am,
however, prepared to accept the second in a
spirit of compromise.
The Rapporteur said that he did not quite
understand the meaning of the first formula.
Allow me to modify it slightly to make it
clearer. It might read: ?A permanent Central
Board shall be appointed by the Council of the
League of Nations and by Germany and the
United States of America?.
I take it that you now understand the mean-
ing of the proposal which, with the authori-
sation of the Spanish Government, I have laid
before you.
The Conference is dealing with a subject which
has from the outset engaged the attention of
the League of Nations. All the members of
the League have been not only glad to have the
assistance of countries not belonging to the
League but have asked for it, and in their
desire to give their work a universal character
they have always been and still are disposed
to give the countries which are not Members of
the League the opportunity of taking part on
the same footing as the countries which are
Members in the organisations which we set
up. But we should not make such a sacrifice
as is represented by this repugnance to speak
of the Council of the League.
One of the delegates pointed out in the Sub-
Committee that we had a responsible organi-
sation the Council of the League in which
I consider in reality that all the Members are
represented. Are we to forget the existence of
the Council ? Is the mention of that body
likely to offend anyone ? I do not see why
it should. Notwithstanding the formula em-
ployed in Article 19 with a view to making us
forget if that were possible the existence
of the Conucil, we find in Article 20 the words
?the Council of the League of Nations shall,
in consultation with the Board, make .. .? And
later ?the Council shall also, in consultation
with the Governments of any Contracting
Parties who are not Members of the League,
take . . .?
If I am not mistaken, these two phrases
have been accepted in Sub-Committee A with-
out any reservation by the delegations of countries
which did not belong to the League of Nations.
Further on, in Article 24, paragraph 3, we find
that an appeal can be made to the Council
when a Government is not prepared to act
on a recommendation of the Central Board.
No reservations were made regarding this
appeal either. Lastly, in Article 36 we read ;
?The present Convention shall not come into
force until it has been ratified by ten Powers,
including seven of the States mentioned in
Article 19, of whom at least two must be
permanent Members of the Council of the
League?.
I do not know what is the attitude of the
United States or of Germany with regard to
Article 36. But I observe that this Convention,
as is quite natural, is continually bringing in
the Council of the League of Nations. Why
should we employ this special formula which
has been proposed and say : ?A Permanent
Central Board shall be appointed within three
months from the coming into force of the pre-
sent Convention by such of the following
States as have at that time ratified the Con-
vention that is to say : Germany, the United
States of America, the British Empire, France,
Italy, and Japan together with those States
who have non-permanent seats on the Council
of the League?.
So now we are going to divide the Council


of the League of Nations into two parts ! This
E quite a new departure. Are not these coun-
tries - the British Empire, France, Italy and
Japan permanent Members of the Council
of the League ? We find ourselves in quite an
unexpected situation. To appoint the Central
Board, we set up a body in which the League
is only represented by the non-permanent
Members. I can see no point in making such
a division between the Members of the Council
in regard to a subject which is of common inte-
rest to the League. We must speak frankly
and state the facts as they are. We must
mention by name the Council of the League
and the Governments of Germany and the
United States of America. The Conference
must consider the question and decide.
If it does not share my opinion, I am ready to
accept the second alternative : ?A Permanent
Central Board shall be appointed within three
months from the coming into force of the pre-
sent Convention by the States represented
on the Council of the League and by Germany
and the United States of America?. As a
matter of fact, these are not my own words ;
you will find them in the report.
The President
Translation : I call upon Sir Malcolm
Delevingne, delegate of the British Empire,
to speak.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I have not very much to add to what I said
just now. I quite admit the force of the
argument adduced by the Spanish delegate from
the references to the Council in other articles
of our draft Convention. I can only say that
the United States delegation laid considerable
stress on the point in this article, but did not
lay the same stress, or if I remember rightly
any stress on the words in other articles.
I cannot explain that fact ; I can only say
that it existed, and we drafted the article in
this way in deference to the views expressed
by the United States delegation, and, I might
add, in deference to the views expressed also
by other delegations on the Sub-Committee.
As I say, it was a compromise between several
conflicting views and unanimously accepted ;
I should think that that is a very strong argu-
ment for leaving the text as it stands.
But there is another argument which also
seems to me very strongly in favour of retain-
ing the present text. If the Conference will
look at the text of the article it will see that it
reads as follows : ?A permanent Central Board
shall be appointed, within three months from
the coming into force of the present Convention,
by such of the following States as have at that
time ratified the Convention?. That means
that only those States that have ratified the
Convention or have become parties to it at the
time when the appointment is made are to take
part in making the appointment.
If the amendment of the Spanish delegate were
accepted, it might have the following result :
When the date arrives for making the appoint-
ment, it might quite well be that a number of
States on the Council even the majority of
them might not have ratified the Convention,
so that the effect of the Spanish proposal would
be to allow a majority of States which had not
ratified the Convention and which were not
parties to it to take part in the appointment of
a Central Board. Now that seemed to the
Sub-Committee to be undesirable. The Sub-
Committee was of opinion that only those States
should take part in the appointment of the
Central Board which had ratified the Conven-
tion and become parties to it. Such an attitude
seems to me to be very reasonable. Are the
delegates in the Conference prepared to agree to
the appointment of a Central Board for the
carrying-out of the provisions of this chapter by
a majority of States which are not parties to
the Convention ? I suggest that the best
course is to adhere to the form of words which
was very carefully worked out, as I said just
now, after a long discussion by the Sub-Com-
mittee.
M. Dendramis (Greece) :
Translation : I make the same reservation
as the delegate of the Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes in regard to the article
which was adopted just now.
SVI. El Guindy (Egypt);
Translation : I also make the same reser-
vation, Mr. President.
The President :
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
May I make one correction in what I said
just now ? I said that it might be possible for
the Central Board to be appointed by a majority
of Powers which had not ratified the Conven-
tion.
That is a mistake. If the members of the
Conference will look at Article 36, they will see
that, as it reads now, the Board cannot come
into force until seven of the States mentioned
in Article 19 have ratified. That would mean
that the majority of the twelve Powers which
are mentioned in Article 19 must have ratified the
Convention before the Central Board can be set up.
But I still think that the argument holds, though
not quite so strongly, that the Board might be
appointed by a body of twelve States, five of
whom might not have ratified the Convention
or become parties to it.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
SVL de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : The question of ratification
which has been raised by the Rapporteur is
certainly a very interesting one, but I do not
think it would be very difficult to find a for-
mula providing quite a satisfactory solution.
In any case, I think that the advantage of taking
a proper view of the Council?s attributions
would amply compensate for the drawback
that several of its members might not have rati-
fied the Convention. Provision is made for that
in my first proposal. On the other hand, if
my second proposal is adopted, Sir Malcolm
Delevingne?s objection will no longer hold
good.
As regards the attitude of the United States
delegation, all I know is that at the ninth
meeting of Sub-Committee A, on January 28th,
an amendment was put forward by the
British delegation. Viscount Cecil said that he
thought Mr. Porter wished to submit another
version of this amendment, providing that the
Central Board should be appointed by the


States represented on the Council and by one
delegate selected among the States not repre-
sented on the Council. Mr. Porter, in fact,
then submitted a subordinate amendment the
object of which was, he said, to ensure that the
States not Members of the League should have
due influence in the selection of the Board.
He proposed, amongst other things, that the
fifty-two Members of the League should appoint
ten persons and that the four States not Mem-
bers of the League should appoint one person.
The subordinate amendment gave rise to
the formula which you will find in document
0.D.C./S.C.A./5 (i) 1 and which reads as follows:
?A Permanent Central Board shall be appointed
by the States which are represented on the
Council of the League of Nations together with
one State chosen by those Contracting Parties
which are not Members of the League, as their
representative?. It seems to me, therefore, that
the second proposal which I submitted this
1 Vide Minutes of Sub-Committee A, Annex 9.
morning tallies with the proposal made in Sub-
committee A by the United States delegation.
The Rapporteur told us that the report had
been adopted unanimously by Sub-Committee A,
but I would like to point out that he should have
said ?almost unanimously?, as I made impor-
tant reservations which 1 asked to have inserted
in the report. I also remember that reserva-
tions were made by the representatives of
Switzerland and the Netherlands. I do not
know whether these reservations have been
withdrawn.
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands)
They have not been withdrawn.
The President
Translation: If the members of the Conference
have no objection, I will postpone the vote on
this question in view of the late hour.
As there is no objection, I propose that we
should adjourn the meeting until to-morrow at
10.30 a.m.
The Conference rose at 6.55 p.m.
THIRTY-FOURTH MEETING

100. FIRST READING OF THE DRAFT
CONVENTION : ARTICLE 11 : EXAMI-
NATION OF THE REPORT OF THE
SUB-COMMITTEE ON INDIAN HEMP.
The President
Translation : The Sub-Committee which
you appointed at the thirty-first meeting to
discuss the question of Indian hemp has success-
fully completed its work, and has arrived at a
result acceptable to all concerned. I propose
that you should ?now hear the report of this
Sub-Committee.
I call upon the Rapporteur, Prof. Perrot,
the delegate of France, to speak.
M. Perrot (France), Rapporteur;
Translation : There is no need for me to make
any further mention of the importance of includ-
ing the question of Indian hemp in the agenda
of the Conference. As it was the first time
that this expression had been used, interna-
tionally speaking, we had to devote the closest
attention to the study of a number of difficulties
which arose. In particular, the honourable
delegate for Egypt urged, with somewhat uncom-
promising insistence, if I may say so, that we
should indicate clearly the conditions governing
the trade in Indian hemp and its preparations.
Further, there exist long-established customs
with regard to the consumption of Indian hemp,
whether it is smoked or consumed in other
ways. We were faced with a problem as
delicate as, and perhaps even more difficult to
solve than, that of opium for smoking. Accord-
ingly, we had to endeavour to evolve measures
which would be sufficiently effective in the
case of some countries and yet would not be
impossible to carry out in certain others.
The following is the text upon which we have
agreed.
In the first place, we have decided to insert
in Article 4 the old Article 14 of the American
suggestions the galenic preparations (that
is to say, preparations intended for medical
use) of Indian hemp which are specified by
name as extracts or tinctures. The sentence
will therefore run : ?(g) to galenic preparations :
extract and tincture of Indian hemp?. Thus,
this only covers preparations actually medicinal,
and nothing else.
On the other hand, the Sub-Committee deci-
ded unanimously - for these decisions were
taken unanimously to insert the following
text in Chapter IV.
?I. The provisions of Chapter V of the
present Convention shall apply to Indian
hemp. In addition, and subject to the
other provisions of Chapter V, each Contract-
ing Party undertakes :
?{a) In the case of the resin prepared
from Indian hemp to prohibit export
except to any importing country which
may not have prohibited its use, and in
such case shall require the production of
a special import certificate issued by the
importing country and certifying that the
importation is approved for the purposes
specified in the certificate, and guaranteeing
that the goods will not be re-exported.


: ?{b) In the case of Indian hemp, each
Contracting Party undertakes, before issuing
the export authorisation referred to in
Article 13 of the present Convention, to
require the production of a special import
certificate issued by the Government of
the importing country, certifying that the
importation is approved, and that the
goods are required exclusively for medical
or scientific purposes.
?11. The Contracting Parties shall exer-
cise such effective control as to prevent
the illicit traffic in Indian hemp, and espe-
cially in the resin.?
We have just concluded our work ; we shall
consider the draft of this unanimously adopted
solution once again.
I do not think that there will be any discus-
sion for the moment. If anyone wants to
make any remarks, he will be able to do so at
the second reading.
The President
Translation : The discussion on the Sub-
Committee?s report is open.
Prince Damras (Siam) :
Translation : As I have no instructions from
my Government with regard to the question of
Indian hemp, I shall be obliged, when signing
the Convention, to make reservations on this
point.
The President
Translation : If there are no other reserva-
tions in addition to that just submitted by the
Siamese delegate, I regard the Sub-Committee?s
proposal as accepted. Chapter IV, Article 11 of
the draft Convention will therefore be sent to
the Drafting Committee. (Agreed.)
101. FIRST READING OF THE DRAFT
CONVENTION : ARTICLES 19, 28-39 :
CONTINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
Article 19 (Continuation of the
discussion ).
The President
Translation : At the close of our last meeting
we were discussing Chapter VI, Article 19, of
the draft Convention.
Several amendments have been proposed on
questions of principle and of drafting. I
expect that other amendments will be submitted
in respect of the other articles of this chapter,
for it is to some extent the pivot of our Con-
vention. I therefore think it very important
to know the opinions of the different delegations
regarding the various points of this chapter.
I will therefore ask you, gentlemen, to be so
good as to let me have before 1 o?clock to-day
the different proposals that you think fit to
submit with regard to Article 19 and the other
articles in Chapter VI of the draft Convention
now before you. I think it would be better
not to discuss this chapter to-day so that we
may have a little time to reflect upon all the
proposals regarding it. I should like to have
the discussion post poned until Monday morning.
There is another reason why I propose an ad-
journment. We have all found during discus-
sion in the plenary Conference that proposals
have been submitted by the different delega-
tions during this first reading of the draft
Convention. If this is the case with articles
the principles of which had already been more
or less generally accepted in the reports, I
fear all the more that numerous modifications
will be suggested for the general provisions in
the chapter which follows Chapter VI. These
provisions are extremely difficult to draft,
Your Drafting Committee is doing its utmost,
but as the Conference had given it no directions,
the work is not yet quite complete.
The interval between now and the next
plenary meeting will allow your Drafting Com-
mittee to complete its work and to meet the
wishes expressed by the members of the Con-
ference.
If the Conference agrees, we will begin the
general discussion of the articles included in
Chapter VII.
There is reason to think that all the proposals
submitted to me will be distributed this evening,
so that you will have time to study them before
recommencing the discussion of Chapter VI.
May I consider the above proposal as accepted
by the Conference ?
M. de Palacios, delegate of Spain, will address
the Conference.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : For my part, 1 am in agree-
ment with the recommendations just made to us.
I should like, however, to put my case. With
regard to some of the articles in Chapter VI, I
shall perhaps submit proposals of amendment,
but that will depend upon the explanations
given to us by the Rapporteur in the course of
the discussion. It is difficult to draft an amend-
ment before knowing the exact meaning of the
article, and it was my intention to ask the
Rapporteur for certain explanations and then
to draft my amendment in accordance with his
reply. That is the reservation which I desire
to make. I may mention that I am referring to
Article 26.
The President
Translation : I propose this programme of
work, of course, only within the limits of what
is possible. At the same time, I beg the Spanish
delegate to consider how difficult it is for the
Rapporteur to be constantly making statements
about these rather complicated matters without
knowing the amendment or the desire that
inspires the amendment. I will therefore ask
the Spanish delegation to submit its amendment,
even if it were necessary *to withdraw it after-
wards.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I will do what I can to comply
with the wish expressed by the President.
Chapter VII : General Provisions.
Article 28.
The text of Article 28 was read as follows :
?Each of the Contracting Parties agrees
that breaches of its laws or regulations by
which the provisions of the present Con-
vention are enforced shall be punishable by
adequate penalties, including, in appro-
priate cases, the confiscation of the sub-
stances concerned.?


Translation : The discussion on Article 28
is open.
M. El Guindy, delegate of Egypt, will address
the Conference.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) ;
Translation : At the wish of my Govern-
ment, I have already had the honour of making
a proposal to you with regard to the penal
measures to be inserted in the Convention.
I asked that the penalties for breaches of the
provisions of this Convention should be made
uniform for all countries and that they should
in no case be less than those imposed in the case
of a ?delit? ; in some countries these breaches
are only punishable as ?contraventions?, a
penalty which is certainly too light.
The President
Translation : Do any other delegates wish
to speak on this article ?
No one desires to speak.
Does the Rapporteur wish to say anything
on this point ?
Sir Malcolm Delevjngne (British Empire)
I think that the difficulty in the way of the
suggestion made by the Egyptian delegate is
that the conception [delit), if I may so call it,
is not universal. For example, we have no
equivalent in the criminal law of Great Britain,
and I imagine the same is the case with other
countries. That alone, I think, would make it
impossible to put the suggestion of the Egyp-
tian delegate into a form of words which could
be accepted by all countries, because the ?delit?
is not universal, and the only form of words
in which we could put it would not be universal
either.
We had a considerable discussion on this
article in the Drafting Committee and also in
Sub-Committee E, and it was generally agreed
that we should not go farther than the proposal
that we have made in the present text of the
article. The very point which the Egyptian
delegate has raised was raised by some delega-
tions, and it was decided that it would be
extremely difficult, if not impossible, to incor-
porate the idea in the text. I hope, in view of
this explanation, that the Egyptian delegate
will not press his point.
The President
Translation : If there is no opinion to the
contrary, I take it that the Conference is agreed
to refer this article as it stands to the Draft-
ing Committee.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands) ;
Mr. President, I beg your pardon for a
moment. It is impossible to understand the
proposition as made by the Egyptian delegate
does it concern a ?delit? or a ?contraven-
tion? ? Ido not understand the word. It
depends entirely on the procedure in each coun-
try. We cannot accept the Egyptian proposal.
Article 28 was adopted at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article 29.
The text of Article 29 was read as follows :
?The Contracting Parties will examine in
the most favourable spirit the possibility
of taking legislative measures to render
punishable illegitimate transactions which
are carried out in another country by a
person residing within their territories.?
The President
Translation : M. Dinichert, delegate of
Switzerland, will address the Conference.
IYI. Dinichert (Switzerland);
Translation: The terms of this article indicate
that we are dealing not so much with a
conventional stipulation so-called as with a
readiness on the part of the Governments to
study the question. Moreover, this article
touches the fundamental principles governing
the penal code in the different countries. Certain
countries, among which is Switzerland, do not
provide in their penal system for the punishment
in their country of an offence {delit) committed
wholly abroad, in any case, if committed by a
foreigner. If the national of a country is
concerned, he could be prosecuted in that country,
as you know, and if the case in question came
within the scope of an extradition treaty, the
foreigner concerned could be extradited.
Consequently, if we accepted this provision,
it would be fated to remain a dead letter for a
considerable time in a fairly large number of
countries, because we could not persuade Par-
liament to modify one of the fundamental
principles of the penal system for the sake
of this clause.
You will remember that, in Switzerland, we
have, as regards offences against the present
Convention, a provision which goes as far as
possible, since it says that anyone who, without
authority, shall have manufactured, prepared,
imported or exported, bought, possessed,
retained, sold or even given or offered to sell or
give the products mentioned shall be liable
to imprisonment for a year or to a fine not
exceeding 20,000 francs. That is to say, in
Switzerland there is no criminal offence {delit)
or attempted criminal offence which remains
unpunished, provided that it was committed
within the country. It would, however, be
impossible to prosecute for an offence of which
no trace could be found in the country. That
is why I proposed that the provision in ques-
tion, instead of being included in the Convention
itself, should be sent out to the Governments
in the form of a recommendation or ?voeu?.
I would like to add the following considera-
tion, which seems to me of importance. If we
leave this clause in the Convention, it will be
submitted with the other articles for the appro-
val of Parliament. There are Parliaments in
which a provision of this kind might give rise
to real difficulties. I do not think that it is
wise to raise difficulties regarding the ultimate
ratification of our Convention for the sake of a
clause which, when all is said and done, consti-
tutes only a recommendation. By formulating
my proposal, I have tried to act in the interests
of the prompt ratification of the Convention.
The President
Translation : Am I right in interpreting
M. Dinichert?s proposal to mean that this
recommendation should be inserted in the Final
Act ?
M. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : I agree that this provision
could be inserted in the Final Act in the form of


a recommendation or ?voeu? to be addressed
to the Governments. The text will then not
have to be ratified.
The President
7 ranslation : The Conference has now before
it an amendment put forward by the Swiss
delegation asking for the deletion of Article 29
from the Convention and its inclusion in the
Final Act as a recommendation to Governments.
The discussion of this amendment is open.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne, delegate of the Bri-
tish Empire, will address the Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
this article refers to a very important matter,
and I hope that the Conference will consider
it very carefully. The article has been inserted
in order to give effect to a suggestion which
was made by the Opium Advisory Committee
at its session of last August. I had better
read the recommendation of the Opium Advi-
sory Committee in full, because it sets out more
clearly than the article does what the intention
is :
?The Conference makes the following
recommendation ; That each Government
should forbid any person within its juris-
diction from procuring or assisting the
commission, in any place outside its juris-
diction, of any offence against the laws
in force in such place for controlling or
regulating the manufacture, sale, use, export
or import of any of the substances
covered by the Convention.?
I am not quite sure that I understood M
Dmichert?s objection ; but perhaps it will
help to remove any misunderstanding in the
minds of members of the Conference if I give
a concrete instance of the kind of case that
this recommendation was intended to meet.
It is a case drawn from my own experience in
the administration of these laws in Great
Britain. A case occurred the year before last in
which a person residing in Fondon and having
an office in Fondon organised on a large scale
the export of these drugs to the Far East. It
was impossible for him to procure the drugs
in England. He arranged by correspondence
and through agents for the purchase of these
drugs in some other countries and for the export
of the drugs from those countries direct to the
Fai East, 4 here was no actual export and
no actual purchase of these drugs in Great
Britain itself. He simply carried on the corre-
spondence from Great Britain. He made
payments by cheque or in other ways from
Great Britain ; but the actual purchase and
export of the drugs to the Far East was effected
from the other countries. That is the kind of
case which this article is intended to meet.
M. Dinichert said, or seemed to suppose, that
this article had reference only to offences outside
the jurisdiction of the State ; but I would
point out to him that, though it is true that
part of the offence is committed outside that
jurisdiction, there is a definite act or a series
of acts which are committed within it. The
person in question was procuring or assisting,
by acts committed within the jurisdiction of the
British Government, the commission of an
offence outside that jurisdiction. That is the
sort of procuring or assisting committed within
the ]unsdiction of a country which it is intended
to punish under the terms of this article.
We have made provision in the British law
for such cases very much on the lines of the
recommendation of the Advisory Committee,
and, in fact, it was in view of the British expe-
rience that the Advisory Committee made its
recommendation. We have found it an
extremely valuable weapon for dealing with the
contraband trade. As we all know, the contra-
band trade is carried on mainly by large syndi-
cates or organisations having their headquarters
in one or more places and carrying on their
operations over a very wide area outside the
jurisdiction.
Unless the Governments can hit that kind of
operation, the campaign against the contra-
band trade is almost certain to fail. It may
be possible to catch, now and again, the small
smuggler, the man who brings in a small
quantity of drugs on his person, but it is not
possible successfully to cope with the large
operations, which are the real source of the evil,
without some provision of this kind.
M. Dinichert has called attention to the fact
that there is no obligation on the Governments
to give effect to this recommendation. That is
perfectly true. When we discussed the matter in
the Advisory Committee, and again when we dis-
cussed it in the First Opium Conference, atten-
tion was called to the fact that at present there
might be constitutional difficulties in certain
countries in the way of carrying it out, and that
is a reason why we have put it in this modified
form.
Many of us would have wished to see the
provision put in a much more categorical
and definite form, but, in view of those consti-
tional difficulties, it was felt that we could not
go further than was actually done in this case.
It seems to me that the fact that there is no
definite obligation to carry out the recommen-
dation is no reason why we should not insert
the article in the Convention. The article does
at least require the Governments to give their
most favourable consideration to the possibility
of inserting such a provision in their national
legislation, and I would strongly urge the Con-
ference for that reason to retain the article as
it stands in the Convention.
_ I would only add, in conclusion, that the
First Opium Conference has adopted the same
article and inserted it in the Convention which
was signed the day before yesterday. It would
be a little unfortunate if this Conference were
to put this proposal on a lower plane (for it
would be a lower plane) by inserting it as a
?vceu? in the Final Act. I hope M. Dinichert
will not press his objections but will allow the
article to stand. It is an article to which very
many of us attach great importance, and;
although we may not have obtained as much
as we might wish, we would rather retain what
we have than allow the article to be relegated
to the comparative obscurity of the Final
Act.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Dinichert,
delegate of Switzerland, to speak.
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : This question is evidently so
complex that it is necessary to explain clearly
what we mean to say and do. Sir Malcolm
Delevingne asks me not to press my objection.


I shall certainly not press it if the misunder-
standing is cleared up ; I shall only press it if
there is still any doubt on the matter.
It is true that the Advisory Committee itself
has made a recommendation to us in the terms
that have just been read to you and in which
it is said that each Government should forbid
any person within its jurisdiction from pro-
curing or assisting the commission, in any
place outside its jurisdiction, of any offence
against the laws in force in such place.
If I understand this proposal rightly in the
form in which it is now submitted to us and
after Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s explanations,
we might, for example, have to deal with the
following case. An individual living in Great
Britain commits an offence against the British
laws on drugs, and commits the entire offence
in Great Britain. He flies the country and
takes refuge in Switzerland. We should be
compelled to prosecute, according to the text
of the recommendation itself. The States
would have to undertake to prosecute the
perpetrators of offences committed wholly
abroad.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne furnishes us with an
interesting example, namely, that of a person
resident in England and effecting commercial
transactions by correspondence. Suppose that
that person were in correspondence with someone
in Switzerland and that the latter had committed
some act in Switzerland, as, for example, purchas-
ing or exporting a prohibited substance. In this
case the situation is totally different. If the
offender were punished in England, it would be
because British law provided for the punishment
of this procuring or assisting in the commission
of an offence. If the honourable delegate of
the British Empire asks us to punish the person
in Switzerland, I can tell him at once that in this
case our law evidently allows us to do so, since
the act committed in Switzerland is covered by
our domestic legislation.
The question is therefore as follows : Are
we to punish in country A a person who has
committed an offence in country B only against
the law of country B ? I maintain that that
would be impossible for us and for other countries,
because it would be contrary to one of the gene-
ral principles of penal law in many countries,
under which it is not possible for a country to
prosecute in the case of an offence committed
wholly against the laws of another country.
If, on the other hand, it is a case of two
offences to some extent linked up, of an offence
committed mainly in one country but with
the aid of accomplices in another, my objection
disappears.
Accordingly, I beg to state that the form of
the recommendation, the actual text of Article
29, and the practical example which has just
been quoted to us do not seem to me at all to
tally with one another. If, on the other hand,
a draft of this Article 29 is submitted to us,
whereby Governments are invited to promul-
gate laws which make it possible to prosecute,
when the main offence has been committed
in a third country, for some act or other commit-
ted by accomplices in their own territory, I have
no further objection of any kind to make.
But that is not what I understood, for the
text proposed does not say it. I will ask the
Drafting Committee to see whether it cannot
introduce this new idea into its draft. My
objection will then, no doubt, be met.
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir SVlalcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
I am much obliged to M. Dinichert for his
further explanation, which makes it quite clear
that there is no difference of opinion between
us. There was no intention whatever of pro-
posing that, in such a case as he mentioned,
namely, that of a person committing an offence
in England against English law and then taking
refuge in Switzerland, the Swiss Government
should be asked to proceed against the refugee
for the crime committed in Great Britain.
It hink M. Dinichert has correctly described,
in the last part of his remarks, what the inten-
tion was, and I am sure the Drafting Committee
would be prepared to express more clearly
that intention.
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : In these circumstances, not
only do we not request that such a provision
should be removed from the Convention, but
we strongly urge its inclusion. This explana-
tion, however, was needed. It was necessary
to take account of what we could do. We are
in favour of the utmost possible extension of the
penal laws in order to cover not only the
commission of the actual offence but also
the procuring or assistance in the commission
of that offence, in the widest sense of the term.
The President
Translation : I think that the Conference is
in favour of referring Article 29 to the Drafting
Committee, with the request that it will make a
more exact draft, taking into consideration the
remarks made by the delegate of Switzerland.
Article 29 was approved at the first reading
and referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article 30.
The text of Article 30 was read as follows ;
?The Contracting Parties shall commu-
nicate to one another, through the Secretary-
General of the League of Nations, their
existing laws and regulations respecting
the matters referred to in the present Con-
vention, so far as this has not already been
done, as well as those promulgated in order
. to give effect to the said Convention.??
The President
Translation : The discussion on Article 30
is open. M. van Wettum, delegate of the Nether-
lands, will address the Conference.
IVI. van Wettum (Netherlands)
I do not know whether I am in order or not,
but I only wish to ask a question. Article 20
of the Hague Convention reads as follows ;
?The Contracting Powers shall examine
the possibility of enacting laws or regu-
lations making it a penal offence to be in
illegal possession of raw opium, prepared
opium, morphine, cocaine, and their res-
pective salts, unless laws or regulations
on the subject are already in existence.?
The only question I wish to ask is whether
it would be preferable to insert a stipulation of
that kind in the new Convention.
The President


Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingnc, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
I think M. van Wettum has put his finger
on an omission in the text of the new Conven-
tion. If he will refer to Article 7 of the new
text, he will see that we have re-enacted the
provision in the Hague Convention, which says
that ?the Contracting Parties shall take mea-
sures to prohibit the delivery to any unautho-
rised persons of the substances to which this
chapter applies?. But we have not added a
provision to deal with the possession of those
substances by unauthorised persons.
I think that under the legislation of most
countries it is already an offence for an unau-
thorised person to be in possession of those
substances, and, unless any delegation in the
Conference sees an objection, I should think
we might strengthen the existing provision
in Article 20 of the Hague Convention to which
M. van Wettum has alluded, and add to Article 7
of our new text some words which would have
the effect of prohibiting not only the delivery
to unauthorised persons of the substances,
but also the possession by unauthorised per-
sons of those substances. If the Conference
is of that opinion, the Drafting Committee
can prepare a text.
The President
Translation : Does M. van Wettum accept
this addition ?
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
Translation : Certainly.
Article 30 was adopted at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article 31.
The text of Article 31 was read as follows:
?The present Convention replaces, as
between the Contracting Parties, the pro-
visions of Chapters I, 111 and V of the
Convention signed at The Hague on
January 23rd, 1912, which provisions remain
in force as between the Contracting Parties
and any States Parties to the said
Convention which are not Parties to the
present Convention.?
Article 31 was adopted at the first reading,
without discussion, and referred to the Drafting
Committee.
Article 32.
The text of Article 32 was read as follows :
" Any dispute which may arise as to the
interpretation or application of the present
Convention which is not settled directly
between the Parties themselves shall be
brought before the Permanent Court of
International Justice, unless, under a spe-
cial agreement or a general arbitration
provision, steps are taken for the settle-
ment of the dispute by arbitration or some
other means.
?Proceedings are opened in the manner
laid down in Article 40 of the Statute of
the Permanent Court of International
Justice.
"In order to settle such disputes, how-
ever, in a friendly way as far as possible,
the Contracting Parties may, before re-
sorting to any judicial proceedings, submit
such disputes for an opinion to such technical
body as the Council of the League of
Nations may appoint for this purpose.
?The decision of the Parties to the dis-
pute to submit it, for the purpose of
securing a settlement by conciliation, to
the technical body appointed by the
Council, or to resort to arbitration, shall
be communicated to all the Contracting
Parties, and the latter shall be entitled
to intervene in the proceedings.
?The Parties undertake to submit to
the Permanent Court of International
Justice any point of international law or
question as to the interpretation of the
present Convention which may arise during
the conciliation or arbitration proceedings,
and the determination of which by the
Court, the arbitral tribunal or tribunal
body, on the application of one of the Par-
ties, may hold to be necessary for the
settlement of the dispute.?
The President :
Translation : Mr. Malkin, Legal Adviser
to the British Delegation, will address the Con-
ference.
Mr. Malkin (Legal Adviser to the British
delegation) :
If the Conference will allow me, I will
explain why I rise to speak on this article.
It was arranged by the Drafting Committee that,
as it had no Rapporteur, any question of a
particularly juridical character which arose
should be dealt with by me acting on behalf
of the Committee. As this article contains a
certain number of provisions which are to some
extent new, I think it is right that I should
give the Conference a very brief explanation
of the reasons which led the Drafting Com-
mittee to suggest those provisions to the Con-
ference,
Of course, it is necessary in this Convention
to have some provision for dealing with any
question as to the interpretation of the Conven-
tion which may arise between the Contracting
Parties. A similar provision is inserted in all
Conventions of this nature. The article which
is proposed to the Conference is based on the
corresponding article in the Barcelona Statute
on the Freedom of Communications and Tran-
sit. The first two paragraphs of the article
are taken textually from that Convention,
but the last three paragraphs are somewhat
different, and I think that perhaps a very short
explanation of those three paragraphs might
be of assistance.
The third paragraph resembles a provision
in the Barcelona article, but is not identical
with it. Under the Barcelona article, there
was an absolute obligation on all the Contract-
ing Parties, before submitting such disputes
as to the interpretation of the Convention
either to the Permanent Court or to some arbi-
tral tribunal, to send such disputes for an
opinion to a technical body appointed by the
League of Nations.
Since the Barcelona Convention was adopted,
other Conferences, dealing with technical matters,
have been held under the auspices of the League.
The President


In some of those Conferences the opinion was
expressed that, while it was, no doubt,
extremely desirable that it should be possible
for the Parties to any dispute which might arise
under such Convention to have the opportunity
of submitting such disputes for the opinion
of the body mentioned it was not desirable
that there should be an absolute obligation to
do so in every case.
That view prevailed in certain Conferences,
and the Drafting Committee felt that the
same view would probably be taken by the
members of the present Conference. This
third paragraph, therefore, has been worded in
such a way as to give the Parties to any such
dispute the opportunity of submitting the
question to the technical body appointed by
the League, if they so desire, but that there
should be no absolute obligation on them to
do so if, in the particular circumstances of the
case, they should not think such a course desir-
able. The Drafting Committee thought that this
was the best solution of that particular problem.
The last two paragraphs of the article are
quite new, and the reason suggested for their
insertion is this. It is obvious that any dis-
pute arising between any two of the Contract-
ing Parties as to the interpretation of a par-
ticular provision in this Convention is of interest
to all the other Parties to the Convention,
because the interpretation which is given to
any article of the Convention affects not only
the Parties to the dispute regarding that par-
ticular article, but the other Parties, who may
in the future find themselves involved in
another dispute as to the interpretation of the
same article.
Now, if a dispute of that nature is referred
under this article to the Permanent Court of
International Justice, a provision will apply
which appears in the Statute of the Permanent
Court. It is Article 63, which is in the follow-
ing terms :
?Whenever the construction of a Con-
vention to which States other than those
concerned in the case are Parties is in
question, the Registrar shall notify all
such States forthwith. Every State so
notified has the right to intervene in the
proceedings ; but if it uses this right, the
construction given by the judgment will
be equally binding upon it.?
The Conference will therefore see that, if
a dispute arises as to the interpretation of this
Convention, and that dispute is submitted to
the Permanent Court, there is already in exis-
tence a provision which would allow any other
Contracting Party which was interested in
the interpretation of the provision in question
to appear before the Permanent Court and state
its views. That provision does not, however,
apply in the case where the dispute is dealt
with not by the Court but either by arbitration
or possibly by reference to a technical body.
The Drafting Committee thought it was right
to give to the Contracting Parties the same
right to intervene and express their views if
the matter is dealt with by arbitration or by
a technical body as they would have if the
dispute went to the Permanent C ourt of Inter-
national Justice. That provision, as I say,
is new, but the Drafting Committee thinks
it is a reasonable one and commends it to the
consideration of the Conference.
The President
Translation : Does anyone else wish to
speak on this article ?
M. Dinichert, delegate of Switzerland, will
address the Conference.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation: 1 think that the whole Con-
ference is aware of the importance of provi-
sions of this nature in all Conventions, and the
fact that few members of the Conference appear
to wish to speak on the matter entirely con-
firms me in my first opinion that those who
prepared this text have deserved well of the
Conference, since it seems that the princi-
ples set forth in it are unanimously approved.
Accordingly, my remarks will not apply to the
principle or framework of the article, which I
approve, but to a number of questions which
might almost be called questions of drafting.
All the same, I think I ought to mention them
in order that the Drafting Committee may
be supplied with all the necessary material
for their final draft.
First of all, I would point out that the third
paragraph says that the Contracting Parties
may have recourse to a technical body for its
opinion. But the following paragraph makes
mention of the decision of the Parties to the
dispute to submit it, for the purpose of securing
a settlement by conciliation, to the technical
body appointed by the Council. That is not
quite the same thing.
You may say that this is rather a subtle dis-
tinction, but to ask for an opinion from a tech-
nical body and to embark upon a procedure of
conciliation are not at all the same thing.
The essential difference between the two proce-
dures is this. We can simply undertake to
submit the question at issue for an advisory
opinion, especially as we are left free to
decide in each particular case ; but when it
is a question of conciliation, I desire that we
should remain true to the principle that in
every procedure of conciliation the Parties
have the right to be represented.
If the intention was to institute a real pro-
cedure for conciliation, it would be necessary
to lay down that Parties not represented on
the technical body should have the right to be
so represented during the conciliation proce-
dure. I think, however, that the idea of the
originators and drafters of this proposal was
to make arrangements for an advisory opinion ;
this being so, it is necessary that the wording
of paragraph 4 should be harmonised with that
of paragraph 5, which speaks of conciliation.
If I make judicial or arbitral proceedings
dependent upon a previous and optional proce-
dure, whether in the nature of conciliation or of
an advisory opinion, the Conference will perhaps
agree with me as to the need of fixing roughly the
question of time-limits. I would therefore
like to add to the third paragraph, with refe-
rence to the advisory opinion, a text something
like this :
?The opinion shall be given within six
months from the day on which the dispute
has been submitted to the body in question,
unless the period is prolonged by mutual
agreement between the parties to the


dispute. The body itself shall fix the
period within which the Parties must
decide whether they will accept the
opinion.?
If the preliminary procedure is adopted,
the time-limit, within which this opinion will
be given, must be known, and if this opinion is
given an opinion which the Parties have the
right to accept or not accept - the body must
fix the period within which the Parties must
give a decision, in order that there may be, in
advance, some kind of agreement between them
with regard to the moment when it can be
said that the preliminary procedure has failed,
and that the procedure binding upon both
Parties at the request of one or the other,
namely, the arbitral or judicial proceedings,
ought to be instituted.
Those are the two additions which I think
it expedient to make.
I have one other detail to submit with regard
to paragraph 4. This paragraph says :
?The decision of the Parties to the dis-
pute to submit it, for the purpose of secur-
ing a settlement by conciliation, to the
technical body appointed by the Council,
or to resort to arbitration, shall be com-
municated to all the Contracting Parties
1 should like it to be stated by whom this
communication should be made, whether simul-
taneously by the two Parties in dispute, or by
the technical body or by the Council.
Unless we are clear upon this point, we run
the risk of this communication being made from
several quarters. In that case no great harm
will be done, but we also risk its being made by
nobody, and in that case the harm will be more
serious.
Those are the few remarks which seemed to
me to be called for in order that it may not
be necessary to make them when the Drafting
Committee has taken the trouble to submit the
text in question to a first revision ; the sub-
stance of the article, I repeat, entirely satisfies
me.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : Article 32 deals with a ques-
tion which has naturally arisen during the diffe-
rent Conferences held under the auspices of the
League of Nations. The question was settled
satisfactorily enough by the Barcelona Statute
on Freedom of Transit.
In the course of later Conferences, however,
this solution has been modified and improved,
and I think it would be better to adopt the plan
approved by the Conference on Customs Forma-
lities. The draft Convention that we are now
discussing contains several articles borrowed
from that Convention. We might employ
.the same method with regard to the settlement
of disputes between States, for the procedure
adopted by the Conference on Customs Forma-
ities seems ||to me the most perfect and most
logical from a technical point of view. The
following is the text of Article 22 adopted by
the Conference on Customs Formalities.
?Should a dispute arise between two or
more Contracting States as to the interpre-
tation or application of the provisions of
the present Convention, and should such
dispute not be settled either directly
between the Parties or by the employment
of any other means of reaching agreement,
the Parties to the dispute may, before
resorting to any arbitral or judicial pro-
cedure, submit the dispute, with a view
to an amicable settlement, to such tech-
nical body as the Council of the League
of Nations may appoint for this purpose.
This body will give an advisory opinion
after hearing the parties and effecting a
meeting between them if necessary.
?The advisory opinion given by the
said body wall not be binding upon the
Parties to the dispute unless it is accepted
by all of them, and they are free either
after resort to such procedure or in lieu
thereof to have recourse to any arbitral
or judicial procedure which they may
select, including reference to the Permanent
Court of International Justice, as regards
any matters which are within the compe-
tence of that Court under its Statute.
?If a dispute of the nature referred to
in the first paragraph of this article should
arise with regard to the interpretation or
application of paragraphs 2 or 3 of Article
4, or Article 7, of the present Convention,
the Parties shall, at the request of any
of them, refer the matter to the decision
of the Permanent Court of International
Justice, whether or not there has previously
been recourse to the procedure prescribed
in the first paragraph of this article.
?The adoption of the procedure before
the body referred to above or the opinion
given by it will in no case involve the
suspension of the measures complained of ;
the same will apply in the event of pro-
ceedings being taken before the Permanent
Court of International Justice, unless the
Court decides otherwise under Article 41
of the Statute.?
Thus we see that Article 22 of the Customs
Convention systematically sets forth the diffe-
rent methods of settling disputes. First, there
are direct negotiations or an amicable settle-
ment, and, if these methods fail, the parties
may have recourse, before resorting to any
compulsory arbitral or judicial procedure, to
such technical body as the Council of the League
of Nations may appoint for this purpose, and
this body will give an advisory opinion. It
is only when these different methods of finding
a solution shall have failed that the dispute is
brought before the Permanent Court of Inter-
national Justice.
The procedure laid down in Article 22 is
excellent. In my opinion we ought to adopt
it, of course with a few slight alterations. The
text in front of us speaks, in the first paragraph,
of recourse to the Permanent Court of Inter-
national Justice in the event of no direct agree-
ment between the States, unless, under a special
agreement or a general arbitration provision,
steps are taken for the settlement of the dispute
by arbitration or by some other means. For
the sake of clearness, I think it would be more
logical not to mention the intervention of the
Permanent Court of Justice until the end of
the article, that is to say, after the other methods
of procedure have been exhausted.
The first paragraph mentions the Permanent


Court of Justice, and the third paragraph says:
?In order to settle such disputes, however,
in a friendly way as far as possible, the
Contracting Parties may, before resorting
to any judicial proceedings, submit such
disputes for an opinion to such technical
body as the Council of the League of
Nations may appoint for this purpose.?
If this advisory opinion is to precede the
intervention of the Permanent Court of Justice,
why not make mention of it first ? I quite
understand that the Drafting Committee has
been mainly concerned with submitting to
us a complete text of the Convention, but I
think that the Conference might agree to the
alteration that I have ventured to propose.
The President
Translation : I will ask Mr. Malkin to be
so good as to reply to the suggestions which
have just been put forward.
Mr. Malkin (Legal Adviser to the British
delegation) :
Perhaps I might just reply briefly to the two
speeches dealing with this point. If I may respect-
fully say so, I think that all the suggestions
that were made by M. Dinichert are extremely
valuable. I am sure that the Drafting
Committee will consider the best way in which
effect may be given to them.
With regard to the suggestion of M. de Pala-
cios, may I say that I am very glad to see that
M. Palacios has not forgotten the work of the
Protocol Committee of the Customs Conference,
on which I had the honour to collaborate with
him rather more than a year ago.
Perhaps I might just explain why this article
does not entirely follow the form which was
adopted at that Conference. M. de Palacios
will remember that in the Customs Conference
certain difficulties arose, which happily do not
seem likely to arise here, as to the competence
of the Permanent Court of International Jus-
tice. There were very strong objections taken
in that Conference to any proposal which seemed
to involve the idea that the Permanent Court
of International Justice ought to deal with
disputes under that Convention. I never quite
understood those objections ; but they were
made. The article in the form adopted at that
Conference was the result of those objections.
In the absence of any such difficulty here,
I should have thought that it was better to
adopt normally the principle that, in the case
of disputes as to the interpretation of a treaty,
the Permanent Court of International Justice
is the right body to which to go, subject to the
rights of the Parties, if they have an arbitration
agreement or a special arrangement between
themselves, to go anywhere else. It was only
for that reason that the Customs precedent was
not followed.
I am sure that the Drafting Committee will
consider the suggestions made by M. de Palacios
and will see to what extent it can give effect
to them. The last paragraph of Article 22 of
the Customs Conference Convention would not
in any case be appropriate to our present Con-
vention and I do not understand why its inser-
tion is proposed.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : I suggest that M. Dinichert
might be present at the meeting of the Drafting
Committee when the new draft of his proposal
is being discussed.
The President
Translation : It will be a great pleasure
for the members of the Drafting Committee
to have M. Dinichert with them, but I do not
know whether he will share that pleasure,
for we shall have to work this afternoon and
perhaps to-morrow as well. Perhaps we can,
after this meeting, agree upon an hour to suit
M. Dinichert.
SVI. de Palacios (Spain) ;
Translation : The memories of the Customs
Conference which have just been evoked by
the British delegate are perfectly accurate.
The difficulties which confronted that Confe-
rence have not so far arisen at the Opium
Conference. I did not propose the insertion
of the article of the Customs Convention as it
stands, but I suggested that it should be
somewhat modified in order to reinforce the
obligatory nature of recourse to the Permanent
Court of International Justice and in order that
the different procedures to which the parties
to the dispute may resort should be presented
in logical order first, a friendly settlement,
then the advisory opinion of the technical
body, arbitration, and, lastly, the Permanent
Court of International Justice.
The President
Translation : I think that we may refer
this article to the Drafting Committee, which
will take account of M. Dinichert?s observations
and M. de Palacios? proposals.
Article 32 was approved at the first reading
and referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article 33.
The text of Article 33 was read as follows :
?The present Convention, of which the
French and English texts are both authen-
tic, shall bear to-day?s date ; and shall
be open for signature until the thirtieth
day of September, one thousand nine
hundred and twenty-five, by any State
represented at the Conference at which
the present Convention was drawn up,
by any Member of the League of Nations,
and bv any State to which the Council of
the League of Nations shall have communi-
cated a copy of the Convention for this
purpose.?
Article 33 was adopted at the first reading,
without discussion, and referred to the Drafting
Committee.
Article 34.
The text of Article 34 was read as follows :
?The present Convention is subject to
ratification. The instruments of ratifi-
cation shall be deposited with the Secre-
tary-General of the League of Nations, who
shall notify their receipt to the Members
of the League which are signatories of
the Convention and to the other signatory
States.?
Article 34 was adopted at the first readying,
without discussion, and referred to the Drafting
Committee.


Article 35.
The text of Article 35 was read as follows :
?After the thirtieth day of September,
one thousand nine hundred and twenty-
five, the present Convention may be acceded
to by any State represented at the Con-
ference referred to in Article 33 which has
not signed the Convention, by any Member
of the League of Nations, or by any State
to which the Council of the League of
Nations shall have communicated a copy
of the Convention for this purpose.
?Accession shall be effected by an instru-
ment communicated to the Secretary-
General of the League of Nations to be
deposited in the archives of the Secreta-
riat. The Secretary-General shall at once
notify such deposit, to all the Members

States.?
Article 35 was adopted at the first reading,
without discussion, and referred to the Drafting
Committee.
Article 36.
The text of Article 36 was read as follows :
?The present Convention shall not come
into force until it has been ratified by ten
Powers, including seven of the States
mentioned in Article 19, of whom at least
two must be permanent Members of the
Council of the League. The date of its
coming into force shall be the ninetieth
day after the receipt by the Secretary-
General of the League of Nations of the
last of the necessary ratifications. There-
after the present Convention will take
effect in the case of each Party ninety
days after the receipt of its ratification or
of the notification of its accession.
?In compliance with the provisions of
Article 18 of the Covenant of the League
of Nations, the Secretary-General will
register the present Convention upon the
day of its coming into force.?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
As Article 36 is very closely connected with
Article 19, which has been reserved for further
discussion, I think perhaps it would be advisable
to postpone consideration of this article.
The President
Translation : I was going to make the same
proposal myself. If the Conference agrees,
Article 36 will be reserved together with Article
19 and Chapter VI. [Assent.)
Article 37.
The text of Article 37 was read as follows :
?A special record shall be kept by the
Secretary-General of the League of Nations
showing which of the Parties have signed,
ratified, acceded to or denounced the pre-
sent Convention. This record shall be
open to the Contracting Parties and the
Members of the League at all times ; it
shall be published as often as possible, in
accordance with the directions of the
Council.?
Article 37 was adopted at the first reading ,
without discussion, and referred to the Drafting
Committee.
Article 38.
The text of Article 38 was read as follows ;
?The present Convention may be de-
nounced by an instrument in writing
addressed to the Secretary-General of the

present Convention may declare, at the
moment either of its signature, ratification
or accession, that its acceptance of the
present Convention does not include any
or all of its colonies, overseas possessions,
protectorates, or overseas territories under
its sovereignty or authority, or in respect
of which it has accepted a mandate on
behalf of the League of Nations, and may
subsequently accede, in conformity with
the provisions of Article 35, on behalf of
any such colony, overseas possession, pro-
tectorate or territory excluded by such
declaration.
?Denunciation may also be made sepa-
rately in respect of any such colony, over-
seas possession, protectorate or territory,
and the provisions of Article 38 shall apply
to any such denunciation.

The President
Translation : This is the final article of
the Convention, with the usual colonial clause.
M. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation: A Protocol drafted by the Draft-
ing Committee will be added to this article.
With the addition of the Protocol, the Japanese
delegation is prepared to accept this article.
Article 39 was adopted at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.
M. Sugimura (Japan) :
/ ranslation : The provisions of Chapter VI
do not include Article 15 of the Statute on the
Freedom of Transit, which reads as follows :
?It is understood that this Statute
must not be interpreted as regulating in
any way rights and obligations inter se


of territories forming part or placed under 102. RELATION BETWEEN THE TRAFFIC
orntpptinn of the same sovereign State, IN OPIUM AND TRAFFIC IN ARMS
the protection of the same sovereign State,
whether or not these territories are indi-
vidually Members of the League of Nations.
That omission is not an oversight. It is
intentional, but I should like to make this
statement in order to obtain the formal confir-
mation of the Conference.
The President
Translation : Note will be taken of this
statement.
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : Everybody considers the Coven-
ant to be superior to any other Convention, but,
juridically, that question is open to argument.
The Covenant is a Convention ; we are about
to sign another Convention of later date. It
would be well to include an article stating that
the present provisions in no way affect the
Covenant of the League of Nations.
The President
Translation : Mr. Malkin, Legal Adviser to
the British delegation, will address the Con-
ference.
Mr. Malkin (Legal Adviser to the British
delegation)
I merely rise to confirm the statement made
by my friend M. Sugimura, that the omission
of the article which figures in the Barcelona
Convention is intentional. M. Sugimura knows
as well as I do the reasons why that article is
necessary in certain conventions.
The reason why it is not inserted here is that
certain provisions in this Convention such
as those dealing with export authorisation,
import certificates and so on are (at any
rate, in the view of my Government, and, no
doubt, in the view of the other Governments
of the British Empire) to be applied to export
between Great Britain and Canada, for example.
If the article to which M. Sugimura referred
were inserted, it would have precisely the
opposite effect.
With regard to the remarks made by M. de
Palacios, the idea that, in a Convention dealing
with dangerous drugs, we could modify the
Covenant of the League strikes me as a little
surprising. I venture to think no such state-
ment as he has suggested is really necessary.
M. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : The Japanese delegation thanks
Mr. Malkin for his clear and straightforward
statement.
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : I reserve the right to return
to this question in connection with Article
26 a.
The President
Translation : Except for Chapter \T, which
has been set aside for discussion on Monday
morning, we have now concluded the first read-
ing of the draft Convention.

DELEGATION : CONTINUATION OF
THE DISCUSSION.
The President
Translation : The Conference has before
it a revised text of the original draft reso-
lution submitted by the delegate of Finland
and considered at the twenty-eighth meeting
of the Conference. I understand that the
earlier text is withdrawn.
The revised text of this draft resolution reads
as follows :
?Whereas the Second Opium Conference
believes that the recrudescence of the growth
of the poppy is one of the most serious
elements of the world?s drug problem ;
?Whereas that recrudescence is largely
due to certain unfortunate political con-
ditions now prevailing ;
?Whereas these unfortunate political
conditions are in their turn partly due to
the unlicensed traffic in arms ;
?Whereas the League of Nations has
convened an International Conference on
the Traffic in Arms and Munitions, to be
held in Geneva on May 4th next :
?Be it resolved :
?That the Second
suggests to the Council of the League the
advisability of drawing the particular atten-
tion of the forthcoming Conference on the
Traffic in Arms and Munitions to the impor-
tance of the question of the unlicensed
importation of arms in relation to the drug
problem.??
The second proposal is from the Australian
delegate. As it is very closely connected with
the Finnish proposal, I think it as well that
they should be discussed together.
It reads as follows :
?The Conference takes note of the reso-
lution submitted by the delegate of Finland
but considers that it raises a question
outside the functions of this Conference.
?The Conference therefore feels unable
to express a definite opinion on the merits
of the question but thinks it of sufficient
importance to draw the attention of the
Council of the League of Nations to the
suggestions contained therein.??
I will ask the author of the first proposal,
M. Toivola, to speak.
M. Toivola (Finland) :
1 must first of all say two words in order to
correct some misunderstanding which seems
to prevail on the part of some members of the
Conference. It has been said that there might
be some other delegation behind my proposi-
tion. I must in the strongest terms state that
the Finnish delegation, in my person, is the
only author of that proposition.
When this proposition was put before the
Conference for the first time last Tuesday, my
honourable colleague, thede legate of Japan
asked me to reconsider it. I have responded to
that friendly appeal and have re-drafted the text
so as to avoid most, if not all, of the objections


raised by my Japanese colleague. If you look
at the revised text, you will find that the most
important part of it is the last paragraph, which
reads :
?Be it resolved :
?That the Second Opium Conference
suggests to the Council of the League the
advisability of drawing the particular atten-
tion of the forthcoming Conference on the
Traffic in Arms and Munitions to the
importance of the question of the unlicensed
importation of arms in relation to the drug
problem.?
The only question which, to my mind, is
raised is this : Is there any relation between
the unlicensed importation of arms and the
drug problem ? I will not go into any details,
but I have to show what were the reasons
which led me to put these two questions
together and to find a relation between them.
The Conference has heard many times that the
political conditions in a certain country and
the cultivation of the poppy are in some way
related. There has been much evidence of the
fact that certain military Governors compel
the people to grow the poppy in order that they
may pay for the arms which are necessary for
the continuation of warlike movements.
Where are those arms coming from ? If
they are imported into China in a legal way,
then no relation between the unlicensed impor-
tation of arms and the drug problem exists.
If, on the contrary, these arms are smuggled
in one way or the other from one country to
another, then certainly the relation exists
there, and the unlicensed traffic in arms helps
the elements which wish to continue to fight.
I do not know whether I am logical or not,
but, in my opinion, the total suppression of
this illegal arms traffic would have a certain
effect on the military operations in that country.
The total suppression of that unlicensed traffic
would perhaps have the effect that the people
who have so far been buying arms would
see no possibility of using the money which they
now get from the poppy for that purpose. If
they do not need the money for that purpose,
I have a slight hope that they would not compel
the peasants to grow the poppy to the same
extent. Ido not know whether my colleagues
agree, but, in my opinion, it would be a very
fortunate thing if something could be done for
the suppression of that illegal act.
Of course, I admit that the question is not
in the competence of this Conference. We are
powerless in this case. We cannot take any
direct steps in order to reach the end which
might make it easier to suppress the growth of
the poppy. But as another Conference is
meeting shortly which is generally competent
to deal with the suppression of the illegal
traffic in arms, I really cannot see that any
harm would be done if this Conference drew the
attention of the Council of the League of Nations
and the attention of that Conference to the im-
portance of the question of the prevention of
the unlicensed importation of arms in relation
to the drug problem.
I was perhaps too innocent when I drafted my
proposition. My intention was in no way to
open a big discussion on this question. I
thought, very innocently, that my proposition
might be accepted without any controversy
at all by this Conference. My sincerest hope
now is that no big discussion will be opened,
but that we should dispose of this question
very quickly. I should hope that the pro-
posal made by the Australian delegation would
serve as a basis for the disposal of this question.
The President :
Translation : In my capacity as President,
I must try and clear up this question. The
delegate for Finland asks that we should take
the proposal of the Australian delegate as a
basis for discussion. The latter asks the Con-
ference to take note of a resolution, although of
the opinion that it raises a question outside the
competence of this Conference. That is a little
difficult for me, but it will clearly suffice to draw
the attention of the Council to the suggestions
contained in the proposal.
Furthermore, the proposal of the Finnish
delegate has been presented to our Conference.
Is the Finnish proposal accepted by the Con-
ference or not ?
If it is, there is no proposal to which we can
draw the attention of the Council, and this
is the substance of the proposal by the Australian
delegate, which itself says that that resolution
raises a question outside the functions of this
Conference.
I would ask the author of the second proposal
to be so good as to give us guidance and explain
to us these rather obscure points.
lV!r. Shepherd (Australia)
Mr. President, I should like to explain, in the
first instance, that the whole object in moving
my motion was to avoid a discussion on a
subject which might be considered rather dan-
gerous for this Conference to deal with. I
think that would be fairly generally admitted.
The Finnish delegate has explained to us that
he has more or less achieved his object by having
drawn attention to this particular subject. I
am sure that we are very much indebted to the
honourable delegate for Finland for the efforts
he has hitherto made to bring this Conference
to a successful conclusion. I think also we
are indebted to him for having drawn attention
to this particular subject.
He has more or less admitted himself that
the subject-matter of his resolution does not
particularly concern this Conference, but it
does particularly concern another Conference
which will take place very shortly. In these
circumstances, I thought that it was inadvisable
to embark on a general discussion of this
subject, which I think would probably lead
to several days? extension of the time which
has already been much prolonged. I have
already mentioned that it raises a somewhat
dangerous subject. We have managed so far
in this Conference to get along without men-
tioning the subject-matter of the resolution
and I was hopeful that we should be able to
finish our discussions without introducing it.
That was my sole object in bringing forward
the motion which stands in my name.
I understand that there is some slight objec-
tion to the second paragraph of the resolution.
I would have no objection to suppressing the
last part of that paragraph if, by so doing,
we should avoid a long discussion, of which I
am very much afraid. The second paragraph
would then read: ?The Conference therefore
feels unable to express a definite opinion
on the merits of the question.?


I do not see how the Conference can help to which M. Toivola has doubtless not given
taking note of this resolution, because it has
already taken note of it by the mere acceptance
of it. Therefore, we must take some action
on it, and the action I propose would be
that we merely take note of the resolution and
consider it outside our functions. I do not
want to use the word ?competence?. We cannot
take a definite decision on it to be embodied
in the Convention, and we can do no more than
take note of it and regret that we can go no
further. If it would meet the general wishes of
the Conference, I would have no objection to
amending my motion in the manner I have
already indicated, but I only do so with the
object of avoiding a long discussion.
The President
Translation : Ido not quite agree with the
author of the second proposal, for the submis-
sion of a proposal to the Conference is not the
same thing as the taking note by the Confe-
rence of such proposal. This formal act is more
or less equivalent to approving the contents
of a proposal without wishing to enter into
details. If a proposal is not accepted, note
is not taken of it. In this particular case, the
procedure is extremely difficult. No one has
asked to speak, and so, if I put the Finnish
proposal to the vote and it is accepted, the
Australian proposal would ipso facto lapse ;
if the Finnish proposal is rejected, the text of
the Australian proposal would have to be
changed.
Does anyone else wish to speak on the Finnish
proposal ?
IVJ. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : I strongly urge the distin-
guished delegate for Finland to withdraw his
proposal, which has fallen almost like a bomb-
shell upon the work of the Conference. His
suggestion has a very wide political significance.
quite the necessary attention.
Despite my great regard for the honourable
delegate for Finland, I think it is particularly
undesirable that the Conference should con-
cern itself with an extremely delicate political
problem just when our work is on the point
of reaching a successful conclusion after pro-
tracted and laborious deliberations.
If once the debate was embarked upon, I
could not draw back, but should be forced to
go on to the end and define the problem in
clear terms, and discussion would then inevi-
tably extend to questions quite outside the
scope of our Conference. Therefore, I venture
to repeat the request to my friend, M. Toivola,
to reconsider the expediency of his proposal.
IVI. von Eckardt (Germany)
Translation : I associate myself with the
request of the honourable delegate for Japan.
I beg the Finnish delegate to make this sacri-
fice and withdraw his proposal. I think that
the whole Conference, without exception, will
be very grateful to him.
[VI. Toivola (Finland)
I am entirely in the hands of the Conference.
I am not, of course, seeking any private ends.
Considerations of amour-propre are not the con-
siderations influencing me. I would only draw
the attention of the members to the fact that
it is now lunch-time, and fortification of mind
and body might help me in taking my final
decision.
The President
Translation : In these circumstances, we
cannot continue the discussion, if there is to
be a discussion, of this proposal.
The Conference rose at i.io p.rn.

AND IVI UN IT lONS : DRAFT RESOLU-
TION PROPOSED BY THE FINNISH
DELEGATION : CONTINUATION OF
THE DISCUSSION.
The President
Translation : We will continue our discus-
sion of the Finnish proposal which was adjourned
at the close of the last meeting.
I call upon Sir Malcolm Delevingne, delegate
of the British Empire, to speak.


Sir Malcolm Delevlngne (British Empire) :
I have no desire to prolong the debate on this
resolution but, as silence on my part may be
misinterpreted, I wish to say a few words.
In the first place, I have to thank M. Toivola for
what he said the other day as to the authorship
of this resolution. I hear it has been circulated
in the Conference that the British delegation
is the real author of this resolution. M. Toivola
has already denied that, and I wish to confirm
what he has said. Why anybody has thought
it worth while to circulate rumours of this
kind I cannot imagine, but at any rate the
rumour is without any foundation whatever.
I think it only fair to the British delegation to
make that denial in a perfectly clear and
emphatic manner.
Although the British delegation was quite
unaware that this resolution was going to be
moved, it is right to say that the British Govern-
ment has a good deal of sympathy with the
object which M. Toivola has in view. If I
understand the resolution rightly, there is no
suggestion of any accusation of default on the
part of any Power ; it is simply intended
if I understand it rightly to call attention to
the fact that the drug situation in China is
dependent to a very large extent on the unfor-
tunate military situation in that country, and
that, from that point of view, the question of the
smuggling of arms is an important one. If
I understand the resolution rightly, it is not
intended to suggest that the smuggling of arms
is the cause, the principal cause, or even an
important cause, of the military situation in
China, but that the effect of the smuggling
of arms on the drug situation in China is a
consideration which it is desirable to bear
in mind.
I think we must all agree with the first part
of that proposition, that the drug situation in
China, the production of opium in China, is
very largely, if not entirely, dependent on the
unfortunate military situation. That is a point
which has been insisted on time after time
both in this Conference and in the First Confe-
rence. I believe there can be no question as to
the facts. In the very eloquent speech made
by M. Daladier the other day, he gave parti-
culars of the manner in which the military
authorities in certain provinces of China are
forcing the peasants to cultivate the poppy.
I think there can be no question as to that part
of the proposal.
The other part of the proposal the rela-
tion between the military situation and the
smuggling of arms ?? is, of course, a much
more obscure question, and one which is not
within the competence of this Conference ; the
Conference cannot go into it, nor have we any
information here as to the extent to which that
smuggling prevails or the measure of assistance
which it gives to these military operations.
I think, however, that it must be a matter of
common knowledge - at any rate, it is certainly
within the knowledge of the British Government
that, to a certain extent, at any rate
I cannot say to what extent: it may be on a
small scale or it may be on a more important
scale - the smuggling of arms does exist.
In the course of our investigations into the
smuggling of drugs into the Far East, we have
found on more than one occasion that the same
syndicates, the same gangs, of persons who
are organising the smuggling of drugs are also
engaged in the smuggling of arms. On more
than one occasion we have made seizures of
arms which have been smuggled out to the Far
East by private syndicates.
I do not say that that is a fact which would
justify us in asserting that the smuggling of
arms has any important bearing on the mili-
tary situation in China, but it does indicate
that smuggling of arms is going on, and it is
a matter which is worth examination and consi-
deration on the part of the authorities whose
business it is to consider the general question
of the private traffic in arms and the illicit
traffic in arms. To that extent, I think, there
is some ground for assuming that the illicit traffic
in arms does to a certain extent (to what extent
we cannot say) assist in keeping alive the unfor-
tunate military situation in China.
I do not want to go further than that. I
think it is well to let the matter stand there.
It is no doubt perfectly true, as has been said,
I think, by certain delegations at any rate,
I know the view is entertained by certain
delegations that the Conference has not the
information before it on which to base any
definite opinion, and that it is impossible for
this Conference to go into the question. I
entirely agree with that view. We have neither
the information to enable us to go into the
question, nor have we the information which
would justify us in expressing any opinion.
I do say, however, that enough and more
than enough is known to justify us in saying
that a prima-facie case is made out for the
consideration and examination by those autho-
rities whose business it is to deal with this
question. That implies and I wish to empha-
sise the point no accusation whatever against
any Power at all. It is certainly not for us
in this Conference either to bring or even to
hint at any such accusation, and I do not think
that this is the intention of the proposal.
That is all I wish to say as to the merits of
the resolution. As I have said, the object of
the resolution is one with which the British
Government has very great sympathy. As
Lord Cecil said the other day, the British Govern-
ment, in common with other Governments, has
taken very stringent measures to prevent the
illicit importation of arms into China by its
subjects. That is a measure which all civilised
Governments, I believe, support, and it is
obviously a matter the importance of which,
on the face of it, we cannot exaggerate.
Now, I wish to make a suggestion to M.
Toivola. I suggest to him that there is no
necessity for him to proceed with this resolu-
tion. There is no necessity for a formal
resolution on the subject at all. There is
not even any necessity, I think, for suggesting
that we should send the record of this discus-
sion to the Council. The matter has been dis-
cussed here ; the point has been raised and
I think it most desirable that the motion should
now be allowed to drop. On a subject of this
kind, regarding which there may be strong
differences of opinion, I think it is most desi-
rable to avoid anything like controversy,
controversy which would entirely ruin the
purpose of the resolution. If M. Toivola will
allow me to say so, I think his wisest course
would be to withdraw the resolution without
further discussion, being quite content with
the fact that it has been raised, and to allow
the Conference to proceed with its next business.


If such a motion were in order, I would suggest
that the Conference should simply pass to its
next business, just taking note, as it will take
note in the Verbatim Record of its proceedings,
that this matter has been raised.
The President
Translation : M. Toivola, delegate of Fin-
land, will address the Conference.
IVI. Toivola (Finland) :
Translation : I have to thank the British dele-
gate for what he said regarding my motives. I
have never had?the intention of accusing anybody.
I only brought before the Conference a question
which, in my opinion, was worthy of attention. I
am very glad that a great many of my colleagues
have some sympathy with my proposal. I
will only say that, in bringing up this proposal,
I acted in good faith, and I have conscientiously
carried out the instructions which I had from
my Government.
Having said that, I think that the object
of my resolution has been obtained, as Sir
Malcolm Delevingne has said, and I withdraw it.
The President
Translation : M. Sugimura, delegate of
Japan, will address the Conference.
IVI. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : The Japanese delegation ap-
preciates the Finnish delegate?s good-will and
his judicious action in withdrawing his motion.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne stated that the British
delegation was in sympathy with the aim of
the proposal. He mentioned several facts, and
his statements, added to those of the Finnish
delegate, give the impression that the Confe-
rence is inclined to doubt the sincerity of the
Japanese delegation?s motives in the motion
it submitted last Saturday, although that mo-
tion was designed simply to avert the dangers
to which the Finnish declaration might give
rise. I now feel it my duty to convince the
Conference of the Japanese delegation?s since-
rity and to clear away any possible misunder-
standing.
A great deal of misapprehension appears
still to exist in Europe as to the real meaning
of the Chinese question, and accordingly I
should like to say a few words on the subject.
As we all know, China is a great nation whose
old civilisation has latterly gained renewed
strength from the scientific knowledge of the
Western world. As regards, in particular, the
problem of arms and ammunition, China pos-
sesses a number of arsenals, many of which are
hardly less important than those of the leading
European Powers. She also possesses immense
resources of iron and coal. She must not be
classed with other States which are less advanced
and which have been subjected, since the
conclusion of the Treaty of St. Germain, to
special regulations concerning the traffic in
arms and ammunition. To suggest placing
China on the same footing as these countries
would be an insult, and would, moreover, be
particularly rash, because public opinion in
China is following our present work with but
little sympathy.
It would be most unwise to introduce fresh
complications, in view of the powerful forces
now let loose in China, and I must say that I
think the Finnish delegate?s good intentions
would be misinterpreted and strongly disap-
proved of in China.
Nor would it be wise to speak of the unfor-
tunate political state of the country, for suffer-
ing nations, like sick persons, are loath to
have their weakness proclaimed to the world
at large. Convalescents are particularly sen-
sitive and require to be understood and hu-
moured. Despite her magnificent qualities, China
has her share of human weakness, like every
other nation, and, now that she has withdrawn
from the Conference, we must not harp upon
the question of the increased cultivation of
the poppy in China. To do so would be a
political error and an act of discourtesy to
which a friend of China, such as Japan, could
not be a party.
My Finnish colleague knows, of course, that
a Convention exists between the United States,
Great Britain, France, Japan and the other
great Powers, the object of which is not to
control but to stop the importation of arms
and ammunition into China. For years this
Convention has been most scrupulously observed
by all the contracting parties. The Chinese
Maritime Customs Authorities, under foreign
control, keep a close watch on smuggling. The
diplomatic corps at Pekin and the consular
authorities in all the big towns exchange infor-
mation and keep in constant touch with one
another. Behind them are the responsible
Governments of the great Powers, whose loyalty
and fidelity, in respect of the engagements
which they have undertaken, we have no right
to suspect.
This Convention has been strictly and loyally
observed by all the Governments concerned,
more especially during the civil war which
has happily just come to an end, and we may
congratulate ourselves on a policy of non-
intervention which has put a stop to the traffic
in arms and ammunition intended for China.
The Finnish proposal casts doubt on the good
faith of the Powers concerned and thereby
touches their honour. When the parties to the
Convention for the suppression of the export
of arms to China categorically declare that they
have fulfilled their obligations, our Conference
can hardly presume to pass a resolution which
would be equivalent to a vote of want of con-
fidence.
Peace and stability in the Far East depend
upon mutual confidence between the great
Powers concerned. Yet a Conference which
has met under the pacific auspices of the League
seems now about to disturb this confidence and
to shake the very foundations of mutual under-
standing by making serious charges which are
at the same time extremely vague. 1 beg to
state that, in my opinion, such a course is
entirely incompatible both with our object
and with the spirit by which we should be
governed.
The Japanese delegation regrets, therefore,
that it is unable to concur in the opinions
hitherto advanced in favour of the Finnish
proposal or in the sympathetic views expressed
by certain delegations.
The President
Translation : M. loivola, delegate of hin-
land, will address the Conference.
M. Toivola (Finland)
Translation : I beg to thank the Japanese
delegate for his kind remarks. There has been
a misunderstanding which I should like to clear


up at once. I had no intention, in submitting
my proposal, of placing China on the same
footing as certain other countries as regards
the traffic in arms and the question of control.
I simply wished to state, and did state in my
first speech, when I submitted our proposal,
that I had endeavoured to find a way of
helping China. Speaking of convalescents, I
simply meant that if the condition of a sick
person involves danger to those surrounding
him, certain measures must be taken. Similarly,
in international affairs, if the sickness of one
nation is a menace to others, certain measures
can be taken without necessarily impugning
the honour of other Powers.
IV!. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : On behalf of our absent Chi
nese colleague, I beg to thank the Finnish dele
gate.
The President
Tra.nslation : The Finnish proposal is with-
drawn and the discussion is closed.
We now have to deal with the Australian
delegate?s proposal on the same subject. Mr.
Shepherd, who is ill, has written to inform me
that he is prepared to withdraw his proposal if
the Conference passes a resolution covering his
requirements. As this is the case, lam autho-
rised by the proposer of this second motion to
withdraw it. The proposal is therefore with-
drawn.
104. EXAMINATION OF THE DRAFT PRO-
TOCOL : TEXT AS REVISED BY THE
DRAFTING COMMITTEE.
The President
Translation : We will now pass to the third
item on the agenda, namely, the examination
of the draft Protocol.
There is no substantial difference between
the text submitted to you to-day and the one
you have already examined. The first two
articles have been combined for the sake of
clearness.
The revised text of the draft Protocol was
read as follows:
?The undersigned, representatives of
certain States signatory to the Convention
relating to Dangerous Drugs signed this
day, duly authorised to that effect ;
?Taking note of the Protocol signed the
eleventh day of February, one thousand
nine hundred and twenty-five, by the repre-
sentatives of the States signatory of the
Agreement signed on the same day relating
to the Use of Prepared Opium :
?Hereby agree as follows :
?The States signatory to the present
Protocol, recognising that under Chapter
I of the Hague Convention the duty rests
upon them of establishing such a control
over the production, distribution and expor-
tation of raw opium as would prevent the
illicit traffic, agree to take such measures
as may be required to prevent completely,
within five years from the present date,
the smuggling of opium from constituting
a serious obstacle to the effective suppres-
sion of the use of prepared opium in those
territories where such use is temporarily
authorised.
?The question whether the undertaking
referred to in Article I has been completely
executed shall be decided, at the end of the
said period of five years, by a Commission
to be appointed by the Council of the League
of Nations, whose decision shall be final.
?111.
?The present Protocol shall come into
force for each of the signatory States at the
same time as the Convention relating to
Dangerous Drugs signed this day. Articles
33 and 35 of the Convention are applicable
to the present Protocol.?
The President :
Translation: Discussion on the draft Protocol
is open.
M. Chodzko, delegate of Poland, will address
the Conference,
IV!. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : The draft Protocol contains the
words : ?The undersigned, representatives of
certain States signatory to the Convention. . .?
Will this Convention be signed by the represen-
tatives of all the States represented here ?
The President
Translation : The producing countries, in
particular, would be invited to sign it, but I
think the Protocol is open for signature to all
the States represented here.
Does anyone wish to speak on the Protocol ?
M. Yovanovitch, delegate of the Kingdom of
the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, will speak.
M. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation : I propose that the words
?whose decision shall be final? at the end of
Article II be replaced by the words ?the party
in question shall have the right to appeal to the
Council of the League against the Commission?s
decision?.
The President :
Translation : I would ask M. Yovanovitch
to submit his amendment in writing.
Does anyone wish to speak on the Protocol
in general or on this amendment in particular ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne will address the Con-
ference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I think that the amendment which has been
moved by the delegate of the Kingdom of the
Serbs, Croats and Slovenes will create a diffi-
culty. Article II of this Protocol corresponds
almost word for word with Article 111 of
the Protocol adopted by the First Conference.
Article 111 of the Protocol adopted by the
First Conference reads as follows:
?A Commission to be appointed at the
proper time by the Council of the League of
Nations shall decide when the effective
execution of the measures mentioned in the
preceding article to be taken by the poppy-
growing countries has reached the stage
referred to in that article. The decision
of the Commission shall be final.?


It will be remembered by the Conference that
these two Protocols were intended to be comple-
mentary. The Powers that signed the Protocol
adopted by the First Conference undertook to
carry out within a period of fifteen years the
complete suppression of the use of opium for
smoking, that period of fifteen years to start
from the time when the poppy-growing countries
shall have taken such measures as to prevent
the exportation of raw material from their
territories constituting a serious obstacle to
the reduction of consumption in the countries
where the use of prepared opium is temporarily
authorised.
If the amendment proposed by the delegate
of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slo-
venes were accepted, it would make the two
Protocols inconsistent with one another, and I
think that, on that ground alone, it would be
extremely inconvenient, if not impossible, to
alter the second Protocol at this stage. On the
merits of the case also, it seems to me, that the
amendment is unnecessary. After all, what the
Commission has to decide under Article II
of the Protocol now before the Conference is
whether the opium-producing countries have
taken such measures as to prevent the smuggling
of opium from their territories constituting a
serious obstacle to the countries in which the
use of prepared opium is temporarily authorised.
That is a question of fact. That is a question
which, it was thought, could best be determined
by a Commission of Enquiry appointed to go
into the facts on the spot. If the Commission
reports that such measures have been executed,
well and good. No further question can arise.
If the Commission reports that they have
not been executed, that the serious obstacle
referred to has not been removed, it seems to
me there can be no ground for appeal.
In the first place, the Council of the League
would not be in a better position to determine
what the facts were than the Committee of
Enquiry which it had appointed to investigate the
facts. In the second place, it is quite obvious,
I think, that the countries which have signed the
first Protocol could not be expected to act
on any decision other than a decision arrived
at on a complete knowledge of the facts. I
understood that both the Conferences were
agreed that the decision would have to be
taken by an independent Commission of Enquiry,
such as has been proposed in both Protocols.
I would ask the delegate of the Kingdom of
the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, therefore, not
to press his proposal, which would certainly
land us in very great difficulty.
IV!. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation : I am quite ready to take
into consideration Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s
objections. I propose therefore that the words
?whose decision shall be final? be deleted and
withdraw my proposal for the addition of the
words ?The party in question?.
The President
Translation : We have before us another
proposed amendment : the deletion of the
words ?whose decision shall be final?.
IVI. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation : This is not inconsistent with
the Protocol.
1Y!. Kircher (France) :
Translation : I think the Serb-Croat-Slo-
vene delegate?s proposal meets the views of
everyone. The important point is that the
date from which the period starts should not
be delayed. If the latter part of the sentence
is deleted, that is to say, if the producing coun-
tries are not allowed to appeal to the Council,
this does not affect our obligations as consuming
countries. The period of fifteen years cannot
be delayed. I think the proposed amendment
meets the views of both consuming and pro-
ducing countries.
Sir Malcolm Deievingne (British Empire)
I have no objection to the omission of the
words, as suggested by the delegate of the
Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes.
The President
Translation : Does anyone else desire to
speak on the draft Protocol ?
M. de Palacios, delegate of Spain, will address
the Conference.
TV3. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : I should be glad of further
details, for information only, as my country
is not, I believe, included among the Powers
which are to sign the Protocol.
As you are aware, in law, retroactivity is
the exception rather than the rule. According
to Article 111, the present Protocol ?shall
come into force for each of the signatory
States at the same time as the Convention
relating to dangerous drugs signed this day?.
We must certainly reckon a year before the
Convention is ratified. Article I, however,
states that the Powers ?agree to take such
measures as may be required to prevent com-
pletely, within five years from the present
date...?
Will the application of the Protocol have
retroactive effect ? Will the interval between
the signature of the Protocol and its entry into
force be counted as part of the period of five
years ?
The President
Translation : M. Kircher, delegate of hranee,
will address the Conference.
IVI. Kircher (France) :
Translation : As regards the text, the Spanish
delegate?s observation is perfectly correct.
There is an apparent inconsistency between
Article I and Article 111, since in Article I
the engagements date from to-day and in
Article 111 from the date of ratification.
In reality, however, there is no inconsistency,
for the undertakings concerning the measures
to be taken by the States date from to-day,
but if the States sign the Convention six months
hence they will only have a period of four years
and six months. The purpose of Article I
was to define the date as from which the under-
takings of the consuming and producing coun-
tries, respectively, start, in order not to delay
indefinitely the period of fifteen years within
which we have undertaken to bring about sup-
pression. There is, therefore, no real incon-
sistency between the articles.
I repeat, the producing countries can sign
when they will ; if they are late in signing,
they will not have the whole of the period of
five years in which to take the necessary mea-
sures.


We have endeavoured to bring the two
Protocols into line with one another. We
must not interfere with this arrangement,
which will, I believe, meet with general approval.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : I beg to thank M. Kircher
for his reply. I am glad that, as a result of my
question, his interpretative statement will be
included in the record of the meeting, as it may
prevent difficulties in the future.
The President
Translation : I understand that the Confe-
rence accepts the Serb-Croat-Slovene dele-
gate?s second proposal, and that Article II
will conclude with the words ?by the Council
of the League of Nations?. [Agreed.) It is
not necessary to take a formal vote, and I
think that I may regard the Protocol as defi-
nitely adopted by the Conference on a first
reading.
The Protocol was adopted at the first reading.
105. EXAMINATION OF THE DRAFT FINAL
ACT.
The President
Translation : The draft Final Act is open
for discussion. You will note that, at the
beginning of this Act, the sixth resolution of
the 1923 Assembly has been inserted in full,
including the second part : this does not come
quite within the mandate of the Conference
but it was thought desirable all the same to
insert it.
Then follow the nomination of the President
and Secretary and certain particulars concern-
ing the Conference which I do not think will
occasion any difficulty.
The opening paragraphs of the Final Act were
adopted at the first reading.
Articles I, II and 111.
The text of Articles I, II and 111 was read
as follows :
?The Conference recognises that to
enable the Convention relating to Dange-
rous Drugs signed this day to produce its
full effect it is essential that it should be
applied as widely as possible in the colo-
nies, possessions, protectorates and terri-
tories mentioned in Article 39 of the Con-
vention. The Conference accordingly
expresses the earnest hope that the Govern-
ments concerned will take the necessary
steps to that end with as little delay as
possible, and that the number of such colo-
nies, possessions, protectorates or terri-
tories excluded from the operation of the
Convention may be reduced to a minimum.
?The Conference recommends that each
Government should consider the possibility
of forbidding the conveyance in any ship
sailing under its flag of any consignment of
the substances covered by the present
Convention ;
?1. Unless an export authorisation has
been issued in respect of such consign-
ment in accordance with the provisions
of the Convention, and the consignment
is accompanied by an official copy of
such authorisation, or of any diversion
certificate which may be issued.
?2. To any destination other than the
destination mentioned in the export autho-
risation or diversion certificate.
?The Conference recommends that all
States should co-operate as closely as pos-
sible with one another in the suppression
of the illicit traffic, and that they should
authorise the competent authorities charged
with the administration of the law on the
subject to communicate directly with
the corresponding authorities in other
countries.?
Articles I, II and 111 were adopted at the
first reading, without discussion, and referred
to the Drafting Committee.
Article IV.
The text of Article IV was read as follows :
?The Conference draws attention to the
advisability in certain cases of requiring
dealers who are licensed by the Government
to trade in the substances covered by the
Convention to deposit or give sureties for a
sum of money to serve as a guarantee
against their engaging in the illicit traffic.?
The President
Translation : M. Chodzko, delegate of
Poland, will address the Conference.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I do not think the drafting
of this article is quite in accordance with the
unanimous decision taken by the Conference,
and I have ventured to submit a note on the
matter. You will perhaps be good enough,
Mr. President, to transmit it to the Drafting
Committee, and to request the latter to re-draft
the article, taking into account my observations
on it.
The President
Translation : I understand that the first
Polish delegate does not wish for a discussion of
the article at present.
The Drafting Committee was instructed to
draw up a text embodying the opinions expres-
sed in the Conference. It discussed this para-
graph at some length, as certain difficulties
arose. I have now received another proposed
draft, which I will submit to the Drafting
Committee.
M. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : Should not Indian hemp be
added to the resolution on the first page of the
draft Final Act ?
The President
Translation : That is impossible, as it is
an Assembly resolution. The question of Indian
hemp was brought before the Conference in
a different manner, though with the same right.
Article IV was adopted at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.


The text of Article V was read as follows :
?The Conference asks the Council of the
League of Nations to consider the possi-
bility of giving effect to the suggestion
which has been made in the course of its
proceedings that a commission should be
appointed to visit certain opium-producing
countries, which desire it, for the purpose
of making a careful study of the difficulties
connected with the limitation of the pro-
duction of opium in those countries and
advising as to the measures which could
be taken to make it possible to limit the
production of opium in those countries
to the quantities required for medical and
scientific purposes.
?In faith whereof the Delegates have
signed the present Act.
?Done at Geneva, the day of
one thousand nine hundred and twenty-
five, in a single copy, which shall be depo-
sited in the archives of the Secretariat of
the League of Nations, and of which authen-
ticated copies shall be delivered to all
States represented at the Conference.?
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Dendramis,
delegate of Greece, to speak.
M. Dendramis (Greece) :
Translation : Article V speaks of a Commis-
sion of Enquiry which the producing countries
desire to have set up. I would point out that I
expressed no desire that such a Commission
should visit my country for the purpose of
holding an enquiry. It was the United States
delegation which expressed the desire, and we
agreed, in order to meet its views.
The President
Translation : Does the Greek delegate wish
the article to be modified, or does he simply
wish his remark to be noted in the record of
the meeting ?
M. Dendramis (Greece) :
Translation : I wish my statement to be
mentioned in the record of the meeting. With
the exception of Persia, none of the producing
countries has expressed a desire that a Commis-
sion of Enquiry should visit their territory.
M. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation : I must submit the same obser-
vation. The suggestion came from the United
States delegation and we accepted it, but the
producing countries expressed no desire in
the matter.
The President
Translation : M. Bourgois, delegate of
France, will address the Conference.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : Since the United States dele-
gation alone made the suggestion, and since,
as is stated in the report, it made reservations
on the matter, it would be best to drop the
proposal, except perhaps in the case of Persia,
which did express a desire for the appointment
of a Commission.
Translation : Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh, dele-
gate of Persia, will address the Conference.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia)
Translation : Persia never expressed a desire
that a Commission of Enquiry should be sent
to its territory. The proposal came from the
United States delegation. Persia submitted a
memorandum requesting the Conference to con-
sider the question. This memorandum was
referred to Sub-Committee B, and, when it
was being discussed, the United States delega-
tion made a proposal which it begged me to
accept. I had some difficulty in inducing
my Government to do so, but we did not at
any time express a wish for the Commission to
be appointed.
The beginning of Article V reads ;? To con-
sider the possibility of giving effect to the sugges-
tion?. The United States proposal does
not mention ?the possibility of giving effect to
the suggestion? ; its purpose was to request
the Conference to recommend that the Council
should take the Persian memorandum into
consideration. This memorandum suggested
that a Commission might be sent to Persia to
study on the spot the best means of limiting
poppy-growing. I cannot accept the text before
us.
The President
Translation : Mehmed Sureya Bey, dele-
gate of Turkey, will address the Conference.
Mehmed Sureya Bey (Turkey) :
Translation : When Article lof the Ameri-
can suggestions was being examined, all the
producing countries pointed out the economic,
political and other difficulties which would stand
in the way of sending a Commission of Enquiry
to visit their country. Mrs. Hamilton Wright,
on behalf of the United States delegation, pro-
posed that a Commission of Enquiry should be
sent to investigate these difficulties and to
endeavour to find a way of remedying them by
means of international co-operation.
All the delegations agreed to this proposal
and asked the opinion of their Governments. If
we accept the first Article of the Hague Conven-
tion, the question of a Commission of Enquiry
does not arise ; but if we accept the first
Article of the American suggestions, the ques-
tion has to be taken into consideration.
M. Bourgois (France) :
Translation : The Drafting Committee has
to meet again, and as a misunderstanding has
arisen as regards the present draft Article V
I propose that it be referred back to this
Committee. In view of the explanations just
given, I think it should be easy to decide upon
a satisfactory text.
M. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation : From what has just been said,
it appears that the producing countries did
not ask for Commissions of Enquiry to be
appointed. I propose, therefore, that Article V
be deleted.
The President
Translation : In defence of the Drafting
Committee, I must point out that the Conference
requested it to draft a recommendation, in


accordance with Lord Cecil?s interpretation,
which was accepted by the Conference.
fVlehmed Sureya Bey (Turkey) :
Translation : In that case, I propose the
following wording ; ? . . .to visit certain countries
which may desire it?.
IVS. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : We must take care that there
is no mistake when this article is read for the
second time. I venture to propose that one
of the representatives of the producing countries
should be invited to attend the Drafting
Committee when the final draft of Article V
is prepared. That is, in my opinion, the only
means of obtaining a satisfactory wording.
IV!. Bourgois (France) :
Translation : From what has just been said,
it seems that no one desires any text at all.
I support the proposal put forward by the dele-
gate of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and
.Slovenes that Article Vbe deleted. We accep-
ted it in principle upon the first reading, because
we thought the producing countries had expres-
sed a desire that Commissions of Enquiry
should be appointed. There has been a com-
plete misunderstanding.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia) :
Translation : I propose that Article V of
the Final Act should be referred back to the
Drafting Committee, and that it should be
drafted as follows : "The Conference asks
the Council of the League of Nations to consider
the suggestion submitted by the United States
delegation...?
I suggest, further, that the proposals submit-
ted by other delegations, that the producing
countries should be represented on the Drafting
Committee, be referred to the Drafting Committee.
IV!. Bourgois (France) :
Translatio7i : I beg to support the Persian
delegate?s proposal. I venture to point out,
however, that the United States suggestion
has lapsed, as the United States delegation
had submitted reservations in connection with
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowieh (Persia) :
Translation : No, the United States dele-
gation did not submit any reservations.
The President
Translation : The United States delegation
requested that the paragraphs now under dis-
cussion should be further examined. This was
not done. I pointed this out to the Sub-Com-
mittee dealing with the matter, and requested
the Rapporteur to give me the opinion of mem-
bers of the Sub-Committee on the point. The
resolution in question was based on the opinion
given by the Rapporteur.
IVI. Bourgois (France) ;
Translation : In that case, it would not be
quite correct to state that our resolution was
drafted at the suggestion of the United States
delegation. The Council ought to know that the
United States suggestion was subject to reser-
vations, but that these reservations were never
submitted. That puts the matter in quite
a different light for the Council.
Translation : That was why the Drafting
Committee decided not to insert this in the text
it was drafting. The position seems to me to be
rather complicated. Does M. Yovanovitch wish
his proposal, which was supported by M. Bour-
gois, to stand ?
IV! ? Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) ;
Translation : Yes.
IV! e timed Sureya Bey (Turkey) :
Translation : I beg to state, on behalf of
my Government, that we were willing to accept
Article I of the United States proposals.
IVB. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : We have already decided, on
the proposal of the Persian delegation, to trans-
mit to the Council of the League a recommen-
dation that it should examine the requests
formulated in the Persian memorandum and
should endeavour to give effect to them. As
the United States proposals were not conclu-
sively dealt with by the Conference, I now
propose that Article V be amended as follows :
?The Conference asks the Council of the
League of Nations to consider the possi-
bility of giving effect to tne requests formu-
lated by the Persian delegation in its
memorandum, for the purpose of limiting
the production of opium in Persia to
the quantities required for medical and
scientific purposes, and of advising as t0..."
The President
Translation : M. Dinichert, delegate of
Switzerland, will address the Conference :
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : I desire to speak on this
question simply as a member, I dare to say as
a very devoted member, of Sub-Committee B,
and not as Swiss delegate. I think the matter
requires some elucidation.
Shortly after its formation, Sub-Committee B
dealt with the proposal contained in Article i
of the United States suggestions which, as
you know, refers to the limitation of the pro-
duction of raw materials. This gave rise to
certain observations which the representatives
of the producing countries embodied in memo-
randa that are most instructive. The general
view expressed was that only after investiga-
tions had been carried out on the spot would
it be possible to decide what conditions were
necessary for the limitation of raw materials.
In agreement, therefore, with the United States
delegation and the producing countries, it
was considered that a Commission of Enquiry
might be sent to the producing countries, in
order to determine within what periods and
under what conditions it would be possible
to bring about the limitation of raw materials.
When Sub-Committee B?s second report,
which contained this draft motion, was submit-
ted to the Conference, the latter first of all
accepted it. Why ? Because it had decided to
adopt the principles laid down in Article i
of the United States proposal. Forty-eight
hours later, however, it revoked its decision,
and adopted the existing Article i of the Hague
Convention, subject to a textual amendment.


If Sub-Committee B had begun by agreeing
upon the maintenance of Article i of the Hague
Convention, and had set aside the suggestion
of the United States delegation, this idea of
a Commission of Enquiry would clearly never
have been raised.
We can now decide either to recommend
the despatch of a Commission of Enquiry or
not to recommend it. We can ask the produc-
ing countries whether, in view of the fresh
undertaking entered into, or rather the confir-
mation of an already existing undertaking,
such a Commission of Enquiry would still serve
any purpose. If they reply in the negative,
we can easily settle the question by dropping
the proposal. If, on the contrary, they consider
that a Commission of Enquiry would neverthe-
less be of use to them, they will perhaps tell
us what they think it could do in their country.
The Conference will no doubt adopt their views
on the matter. I think that in any case
the Conference can only act in agreement with
the producing countries.
M. Bourgois (France) ;
Translation : I beg to support the Egyptian
delegate?s proposal.
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia) :
Translation : I also desire to support the
Egyptian proposal.
The President
Translation : The Egyptian delegation?s
proposal is as follows :
?The Conference asks the Council of the
League of Nations to consider the possi-
bility of giving effect to the request formu-
lated by the Persian delegation in its
memorandum, for the purpose of limiting
the production of opium in Persia to
the quantities required for medical and
scientific purposes, and of ad vising as to ... ?
We therefore have before us three different
proposals.
M. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation : I beg to withdraw my pro
posal.
The President
Translation : We now have only the Egyp-
tian delegation?s proposal, which is supported
by several delegations, and the Polish delega-
tion?s proposal, that Article V be referred back
to the Drafting Committee. This can only be
done by the desire of the Conference. Per-
sonally, I feel that I should have some diffi-
culty in explaining to the Drafting Committee
what is meant. The Egyptian proposal
asks that effect should be given to the
requests formulated in the Persian memoran-
dum. That is a new point. At the moment,
the Conference is still dealing with the question
of substance and not with that of form. Ido
not see how I can simply refer the question to
the Drafting Committee without fuller expla-
nations from the Conference.
M. Dendramis (Greece) ;
Translation : I wish to revert to the pro-
posal of the delegation of the Kingdom of the
Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. We might perhaps
vote on it first, and then on the text submitted
by the Egyptian delegate.
Translation: Sir Malcolm Delevingne, delegate
of the British Empire, will address the Conf-
erence.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
Mr. President, I confess that I am completely
bewildered by the discussion that has taken place,
and I imagine that some of the other delegations
must feel in the same position.
A discussion took place the other day in the
Conference on the report of Sub-Committee B.
That report, as the Conference will remember,
was inconclusive. It gave no definite recom-
mendation, for the simple reason that certain
reservations were made which prevented it
from doing so.
I think I am right in saying that the general
sense of the Conference was that some recom-
mendation should be adopted which would give
the Council the opportunity of examining the
question in concert with the Governments of
the countries affected and arranging with them,
if they so desired, but only if they so desired,
for an enquiry into the difficulties which exist
at the present time in limiting the production
and distribution of raw opium to medical and
scientific purposes.
The Drafting Committee has done its best
to embody in the form of this resolution or
vceu what was understood to be the general
sense of the Conference. I must say that in
my opinion it is desirable to retain this vceu
more or less in the form in which it has been
put by the Drafting Committee.
The Drafting Committee intended to make
it clear but perhaps it has not used the best
form of words that such an enquiry could
only be made in the case of any country if the
Government of that country so desired and by
arrangement with the Government of that
country. It would leave each Government
entirely free to accept an enquiry or to reject it.
We have heard this morning from one or
two delegates certainly one, the delegate of
Turkey that they desired an enquiry if the
Council of the League of Nations were willing
to grant it and that they would collaborate in
the most loyal manner possible. That is an
expression of opinion on the part of the dele-
gate of Turkey which I for one think this Con-
ference can hardly put aside.
I therefore suggest that the Conference should
accept in principle the text of the recommenda-
tion as it has been drawn up by the Drafting
Committee but with some alteration of words
to make it quite clear that the enquiry would
only take place if the Government of the
country desired it and by arrangement with
that Government. If I may say so, I rather
liked the proposition of the delegate of the
Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes,
who proposed to alter the words ?which desire
it?? to ?if they desire it?. If the recommendation
were modified to read in that way it would,
I think, leave every Government perfectly free
to accept or not to accept an enquiry as it
considered best and to arrange with the Council
the conditions under which the enquiry would
be made. It would read something like this :
?The Conference asks the Council of
the League of Nations to consider the pos-
sibility of giving effect to the suggestion
which has been made in the course of its
proceedings that a Commission should be
The President:


If you like, some other words could be added,
such as: ?and by arrangement with the Govern-
ment of the country? words which the Drafting
Committee could quite easily settle. I ima-
gine that a vceu in that form would not meet
with objection from any Government, because
the matter would be left entirely in its discretion
to accept and, if it accepted, to settle the
details with the Council or not to accept, if it
thought it better.
I do not see how the Drafting Committee can
improve on this recommendation unless it
has the most distinct instructions from the
Conference as to what is intended. I would
suggest to the Conference therefore that in
order to save time and get on with the very
important business that lies before us we should
agree to some modification of the vceu on the
lines I have mentioned, which correspond with
the second proposition of the delegate of the
Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes
and which it seems to me ought not to raise
difficulties or objections on the part of any dele-
gate here.
IVI. Bourgois (France) ;
Translation : I am prepared to accept Sir
Malcolm Delevingne?s proposal as a compro-
mise.
M. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation : I also accept Sir Malcolm
Delevingne?s proposal.
The President
Translation : Mr. Riddell, delegate of Cana
da, will address the Conference.
IYI. Riddell (Canada)
I quite see that in Article V it is necessary
to make it clear that the Commission would
only go to those countries that wished it. I
hardly see how satisfaction could be given to
the Persian memorandum were it not preceded
by some kind of enquiry such as is implied
in Article V. I think nothing but good could
come from such a Commission. It would be
a great gain to almost any country to be visited
by such experts. As an agriculturist, I feel it
would be too bad if we were to suppress this
article altogether. I have much pleasure, there-
fore, in supporting it, subject to the amend-
ments that have been suggested.
IVI. Dendramis (Greece)
Translation : I beg to withdraw my pro-
posal and to support Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s
motion.
The President
Translation : We now have before us only
two proposals: M. Chodzko?s proposal refer-
ring the question to the Drafting Committee,
with Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s observations,
which were agreed to by several delegations, and
the Egyptian delegation?s proposal. Does the
Egyptian delegate wish his proposal to stand ?
IVI. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : Since Sir Malcolm Delevingne
proposes that Article V should be maintained
and the Persian requirements will thus be met,
I beg to withdraw my proposal.
Translation : We have before us a single
proposal which represents the general view of
the Conference ; it is that Article Vbe refer-
red back to the Drafting Committee to be exa-
mined with special reference to Sir Malcolm
Delevingne?s remarks. I venture to invite
the first Persian delegate to be present when
the Drafting Committee is discussing this
question.
Does anyone else wish to speak on the Final
Act ?
IYI. de Palacios (Spain)
7 ranslation : The Final Act was distributed
this morning. We have accepted the recommen-
dations contained in it as they were explained
in the course of our discussion. I think, however,
that it would be advisable to reserve the right
to submit further recommendations arising
out of the second reading of the draft Con-
vention.
I am told that one of the articles adopted at
the first reading will be discussed again at the
second. If this is not so, I shall probably
submit a draft recommendation to the Confe-
rence.
The matter in question would, of course,
not be one referred to in the recommendations
contained in the Final Act and would not be
at variance with them.
The President
Translation : I understand from the last
speaker?s remarks that the Spanish delegation
reserves the right to submit a further recommen-
dation. I would suggest that this should be
done at the first reading of the draft rather
than at the second.
The Final Act is adopted, subject to this
reservation, and referred to the Drafting Com-
mittee, which will examine also the two ques-
tions specially referred to it.
The Final Act was adopted at the first reading
and referred to the Drafting Committee.
106. FIRST READING OF THE DRAFT
CONVENTION : ARTICLE 19 : CONTI-
NUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
The President
Translation : We will resume the discussion
on Article 19 and the articles connected with it.
I beg to remind you that as regards Article 19,
the Conference accepted two proposals submit-
ted by the Polish delegate ; the first was that
the words ?the Central Board shall elect its
President? should be added, and the second that
the mandate should be for five instead of three
years.
M. von Eckardt, delegate of Germany, will
address the Conference.
IVI. von Eckardt (Germany)
7 ranslation : I hope you will pardon me if
I revert once more to the proposal of the Polish
delegate, who rightly considers, if I am not
mistaken, that the number of experts on the
Central Board should be increased and that
this body should be representative of the chief
producing, manufacturing and consuming coun-
tries.
With the support of the majority of the Confe-
322 ??


rence, the Rapporteur of Sub-Committee A,
recalling the allusion to human weakness
which was made by the French Minister for
the Colonies, said that the persons selected must
be disinterested and impartial an ideal which
might not be attained if they belonged to the
two groups mentioned.
The intention is to leave the choice of ex-
perts to the hazards of an election. The results
of the election would not be a matter of concern
to all the delegations, but they certainly would
be to some, and more especially to the German
delegation.
As one of the chief manufacturing countries,
Germany can only sign the Convention if
provision is made for the presence of a German
expert on the Central Board.
As Article 19 makes the right to vote contin-
gent upon previous ratification of the Conven-
tion, Germany will not be able to exercise this
right on the occasion of the first election of
members of the Central Board. If a German
expert were elected, the above-mentioned reser-
vation would not be maintained 1 .
The President
Translation : M. Falcioni, delegate of Italy,
will address the Conference.
M. Falcioni (Italy) ;
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, I venture to remind you of the
policy that the Italian delegation has followed
from the beginning.
As representatives of a country which, apart
from general and humanitarian interests, has
no concern whatsoever in the matter with
which we are dealing, we have always main-
tained an attitude of reserve and have supported
every effort designed to conciliate the divergent
and sometimes opposite points of view which have
manifested themselves in the course of our work.
As regards the question of the Central Board,
I may say that if the Italian delegation had
followed its natural inclination and the general
line of conduct laid down by its Government, it
would have expressed serious doubts and would
have felt it its duty to make equally serious
reservations. It decided, however, not to per-
sist in this policy but to support all concilia-
tory efforts directed towards an understanding.
We therefore voted with the British delega-
tion, at the meeting on Friday, in favour of the
British motion. We could not but note,
however, that the opposition to the proposal to
modify the constitution of the Central Board,
and the decisions reached, far from eliminating
the difficulties, merely increased them, because
the very idea of the Central Board has thereby
become increasingly unpopular.
I repeat that if the Italian delegation regar-
ded the matter solely from its own point of view,
it would certainly hesitate before agreeing to
the proposed institution. Recognising, however,
that it is an essential feature of the system as
contemplated, the Italian delegation is prepared
to waive its objections to the setting-up of the
Central Board provided that the Board is so
constituted as to meet, as far as possible, the
views of the Conference as a whole.
1 Reserve : The validity of the signature and rati-
fication of this Convention are subject to the condition
that a German expert will be appointed as a member
of the Central Board.
I now venture, therefore, after having voted
with the British delegation at the meeting on
Friday, to ask Sir Malcolm Delevingne, the
Rapporteur, whether he could not make certain
concessions to meet the views of the Polish
delegation. The Polish amendment would not
make any appreciable difference to the character
of the Central Board as originally contemplated.
I think it would be possible to adhere to the
principle that the Central Board should always
be composed of experts and at the same time
to increase the number to eight. The experts
selected should be persons who, without being
directly representative of the countries to which
they belong, would be conversant with the spe-
cial conditions, and they should be chosen from
among nationals of producing and consuming
countries.
I submit this as a general suggestion and
hope that it may be taken as a basis for discus-
sion or embodied in an amendment.
I now desire to state clearly my views as to the
method suggested for the selection of members of
the Board. The Italian delegation could not accept,
as it stands, the method laid down in the present
text of Article 19. Apart from other considera-
tions, the text in question would make it impos-
sible, once for all, to obtain the help of the
United States in the work of international co-
operation which is our object.
I think it preferable that the members of
the Central Board should be nominated by the
Council of the League, which could and should
take into account not only the considerations
contained in the Polish proposal but also other
factors of a general and political character,
and which would have power, in the event of
United States co-operation, to include a national
of the United States on the Central Board.
As this is a general discussion, I may remark
that I shall have certain modifications to suggest
concerning Article 20, and I reserve the right
to do so at the proper time.
In conclusion, I would emphasise the neces-
sity of taking into account the legitimate
considerations which have been raised in the
course of our discussions. I appeal to all those
who are anxious for the setting-up of the Central
Board.
The President
Translation : In accordance with our pro-
cedure, I would ask the Italian delegate to
submit his suggestion concerning Article 20 in
writing.
Mr. Clayton, delegate of India, will address
the Conference.
M. Clayton (India)
It was with considerable dismay that I lis-
tened last Friday to the reservations made by
the delegations of producing countries as the
result of the vote on the second amendment pro-
posed by the delegate for Poland. This dismay
was all the greater as the reasons for the atti-
tude taken up by them were not fully stated in
the course of the debate.
My dismay has been increased this morning
by the reservations made on behalf of Germany.
I may say that since our last meeting I have
studied Chapter VI with some care, and it
seems to me that these reservations are based
on a misapprehension. There seems to me
some misunderstanding as to the duties of the
Central Board. Some delegations appear to
regard it as an administrative body which


may take some executive action prejudicial to
the interests of some of the States concerned in
the traffic of drugs and opium.
Now, personally, I can find no justification
whatever for this view in the draft Convention
before us. In the first place, I would like to
point out that the principle of the submission
of the most complete statistics by all States
concerned in the traffic has been admitted in
every Sub-Committee. That principle has no-
where been disputed, and I take it that whatever
happens to the Central Board, these statistics
will be retained.
Now, if they are sent in, they must undoub-
tedly be published, and, if published, they will
be available for every journalist in the world
and for every anti-opium or anti-drug associa-
tion in the world to comment upon them.
Therefore, whether there be a Board or not,
there will be publicity for the statistics, and there
will be comments, informed and uninformed,
prejudiced and unprejudiced, and all the States
concerned must be prepared to find themselves
the target of criticism.
Let us now return to the Board. Its duty,
according to Article 24 (1), is continuously
to watch the course of the international trade.
This means little more than that the Board will
have the mass of statistics furnished to it
collated by its staff, and, after examination,
endeavour to present the general course of the
international traffic in as clear a manner as
possible in its annual report. This report
goes to the Council of the League under Article
27-
Now this annual survey will undoubtedly be
of great value, and, being prepared by a body
of men specially fitted and selected for the
purpose, it will do much to prevent the flow of
prejudiced or uninformed criticism which, in the
absence of such a report, would very likely
appear from other quarters. The material for
the report will be furnished in the statistics,
and the comments thereon sent in by the various
signatory Governments, and I cannot imagine
that this report is likely to contain anything
objectionable to any country.
It will be said that the Board has other
powers. So it has. But if it has other powers,
it will become obvious at once, if the matter
is looked at in the right way, that these powers
are more likely to afford opportunity to States,
whose actions have given rise to misunderstan-
dings, to clear up those misunderstandings rather
than to create international unpleasantness.
In the first place, let us imagine that the survey
of the world?s position by the Board leads it to
be uncertain as to the real facts in a given
country. The statistics and statements sub-
mitted by that country do not dispel that
uncertainty. Well, what happens ? The Board
puts down this point for discussion at the next
meeting and it is to be hoped that the Board
will meet in private and the country in
question will be asked to send a representative
to that meeting. That is in accordance with
Article 24 (6). The matter will then be fully
discussed in private between the Board and the
country concerned, and, in nine cases out of
ten, the matter will end there and all difficulties
will be satisfactorily solved. The report at
the end of the year will explain the solution of
the difficulty encountered, and a great deal of
public criticism, very objectionable no doubt
to the country whose action is in question, will
be avoided. 1 cannot imagine what any coun-
try can see to object to in all this.
Let us, again, assume that a satisfactory
solution is not arrived at and that the Board
formulates serious criticisms which it does not
regard as fully met by the explanations of the
country in question. In almost every case,
these criticisms will relate to some defect in
the administrative system of the country
which permitted the incidents under discussion
to arise. Normally the incident will probably
terminate as follows. The justice of the cri-
ticism will be recognised by the country con-
cerned, an assurance will be given that the
administrative machinery will be overhauled
so as to prevent a recurrence of the incident, and
the proceedings will terminate. All this would
take place in private, and no public comment
would be occasioned thereby. Again, I see
no reason for any country to object.
Supposing, however, a conflict of opinion
between the Board and any country does per-
sist, then the country can appeal to the Council
of the League against the decision of the Board.
That is, the Board will not merely send its
own version of the facts to the Council but
with that version will go the full explanations
of the country in default, in the form of an appeal,
and until the Council has pronounced on the
appeal, no recommendations as regards the
withdrawal of permission to import can appa-
rently be circulated to the other signatories.
Even then, the countries with which the country
alleged to be in default deals need not accept the
recommendation unless they like.
Frankly, it does not seem to me that, hedged
about as it is with all these restrictions, this
power of recommendation is in the least likely
ever to be used in practice, except against
a State which is definitely and deliberately
breaking its obligations under the Convention,
and recognised to be so doing by the public
opinion of the world, and I imagine there is
not a State represented here which is likely to
find itself in that position.
The Board therefore simply provides a machi-
nery for producing an annual review of the inter-
national position and for settling any difficulties
and misconceptions that may arise from the
statistics sent in. There will be little or no
opportunity in its work for the clash of oppo-
sing interests. What is therefore required is
that its members should be sufficiently versed
in opium and drug matters to be able to make
correct deductions from the statistics presented
to them and to be able to understand the expla-
nations presented to them by the States which
are asked to send representatives for any cause
to attend their meetings.
I see no reason why the selecting Powers
mentioned in Article 19 should not be perfectly
capable of choosing men suitable for this
purpose. In fact, personally, I hardly see the
need of a panel of possible candidates to be
chosen, one by each of the Contracting Parties.
As no action can be taken which in any way
affects any Contracting Party without that Party
being represented at the meeting of the Board,
I cannot see why any State should be concerned
to be represented on the Board itself. The
Board has to be chosen somehow, and I think
the method proposed in the article, if not the
best, is at least as good a method as any other.
Personally I accept the method for my own
delegation.


I sympathise with those State which feel
alarmed, but I think that a little consideration
will show that their alarm is not really justified
by the facts of the case and that really there
cannot be any possibility of theii interests
being in danger.
I trust, therefore, that the recommendations
of the Sub-Committee will be allowed to stand.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I beg warmly to thank the
Italian delegate for his kind reference to the
proposals I had the honour to submit last
Friday. His suggestions are extremely valu-
able and, with the President?s permission, I
would ask him to submit them in writing this
afternoon.
I do not share the views of the Indian dele-
gate, whose eloquent speech was designed to
prove that the Central Board would serve no
useful purpose. I most earnestly hope that
this body will be set up and that it will meet
with universal confidence. I therefore beg to
urge the adoption of my proposal.
The President
Translation : I would ask the Italian dele-
gate to be good enough to submit his proposal.
M. Falcioni (Italy) :
Translation : I will read my proposal, which
will be distributed this afternoon. It is as
follows :
?The Central Board shall consist of eight
members who, by their technical compe-
tence, impartiality and disinterestedness,
command general confidence.
?The members of the Central Board shall
be chosen bv the Council of the League of
Nations. The United States of America
and Germany shall be invited each to
nominate one person on the Electoral
Body.
"In choosing the members of the Central
Board, the Electoral Body shall take into
consideration the necessity of including on
the Central Board, in just proportion, per-
sons possessing a knowledge of the drug
situation, both in the producing and manu-
facturing countries on the one hand and
in the consuming countries on the other
hand.
?The members of the Central Board
shall not hold any office which puts them
in a position of direct dependence on their
Governments.?
Mr. Clayton (India)
As a point of personal explanation, I desire
to say that M. Chodzko has completely misin-
terpreted the effect of my speech and that in-
stead of thinking that the Central Board is unde-
sirable I think that it is a most desirable body
for the carrying-out of the purposes of the
Convention.
M. Pinto-Escalier (Bolivia)
Translation : The Indian delegate expressed
his surprise at the reservations made by the
producing countries as regards the organisation
of the Central Board. As Bolivia is a producing
country, I beg to state that my delegation made
no such reservation.
The Conference rose at 1.20 p.m.
THIRTY-SIXTH MEETING
Held at Geneva on Monday, February 16th, 1925, at 3.30 p.m.
CONTENTS :
107. First Reading of the Draft Conven-
tion ; Articles 19-27: Continuation
of the Discussion.
President ; M. Herluf Zahle.
107. FIRST READING OF THE DRAFT
CONVENTION : ARTICLES 19-27 :
CONTINUATION OF THE DISCUSSION.
Article 19 ( Continuation of the
discussion ).
The President
Translation : We will continue the discus-
sion of Article 19. As you are aware, several
amendments have been submitted. After con-
sidering these various amendments, I think that
it would be advisable to begin our discussion
by taking the last proposal dealing with this
article, which was made here by the fust
delegate of Italy, and is as follows :
?The Central Board shall consist of
eight members who, by their technical
competence, impartiality and disinte-
restedness, command general confidence.
?The members of the Central Board shall
be chosen by the Council of the League of
Nations. The United States of America
and Germany shall be invited each to
nominate one person on the Electoral
Body.
?In choosing the members of the Central
Board, the Electoral Body shall take into
consideration the necessity of including
on the Central Board, in just proportion,
persons possessing a knowledge of the drug
situation, both in the producing and manu-
facturing countries on the one hand and in
the consuming countries on the other hand.
?The members of the Central Board shall
not hold any office which puts them in a
position of direct dependence on their
Governments.?
I understand the Italian proposal to mean
that the last lines of the previous draft of
Article 19 should be added to the above text ?


M. Falcioni (Italy) :
Translation : That is so.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I am sure we must all be grateful to the first
delegate of Italy for having made this attempt
an attempt which I hope will be successful
to bridge the gulf which appeared likely, at the
end of last week, to divide the Conference into
two sections.
So far as I personally am concerned, and I
think so far as those who supported the scheme
of Sub-Committee A are concerned, we see no
objection to the adoption of the proposal of
the Italian delegate, which I think ought to
meet the views of both parties. It provides
for a Board which would have a complete
acquaintance with the situation in all the diffe-
rent groups of countries, and at the same time a
Board which should be independent, impartial
and likely to command the general confidence
of all countries.
There may be some slight modifications in
wording which the Drafting Committee may
like to consider, but those will be merely a
matter of drafting. I have great pleasure, there-
fore, in supporting the adoption of the Italian
proposal.
The President
Translation : M. Yovanovitch, delegate of
the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes,
will address the Conference.
IVI. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) :
Translation : Ido not quite understand the
last sentence but one. Does it imply that the
members of the Board must necessarily belong
to producing countries ? Otherwise, we should
have before us only a new edition of Article 19
given in the draft Convention.
The President
Translation : M. Falcioni, delegate of Italy,
will address the Conference.
IVI. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : Since Sir Malcolm Delevingne
has just told us that it would be advisable to
leave all these questions to the Drafting Com-
mittee, I think that that Committee should be
asked to consider whether it would amend my
text in the way suggested by M. Yovanovitch,
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Sugimura,
delegate of Japan, to speak.
IVI. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : The Japanese delegation con-
gratulates the distinguished delegate of Italy
on having prepared a draft which satisfies
everyone. I am quite prepared to accept it
subject to certain slight changes in wording.
Light has at last reached us, and that from the
fair land of Italy !
The President
Translation : M. Chodzko, delegate of Po-
land, will address the Conference.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I think it my duty to make the
following statement ;
Although the wording of Article 19 proposed
by the Italian delegation is not as precise as
that which I had the honour to submit to you,
I am prepared, in a spirit of concession and to
prevent the failure of this Conference a
failure which might seriously affect the League
of Nations, whose prestige and prosperity should
be our first care to accept the Italian pro-
posal in the name of the Polish Government,
and, should it be accepted by the Conference, 1
will withdraw the reservations that I made
during last Friday?s meeting.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
IV!. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I should also like to express
my satisfaction with the Italian proposal. I
think that the solution which is recommended
is very satisfactory and I thank the Italian
delegate for having taken account of the sugges-
tion which I had the honour to make at last
Friday?s meeting. In fact, we find the follow-
ing sentence in the Italian proposal : ?The
members of the Central Board shall be chosen
by the Council of the League of Nations?. This
wording meets my wishes.
The President
Translation : M. Dinichert, delegate of
Switzerland, will address the Conference.
IV!. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I should like to ask the Italian
delegate to explain one point. In his opinion,
must the States which are to constitute the
electoral body have ratified the Convention or
is this not the case ? This is not clear.
The President
Translation : M. Falcioni, delegate of Italy,
will address the Conference.
IVI. Falcioni (Italy) :
Translation : I think that it will be neces-
sary to sign the Convention in order to be
represented on the Central Board. We have
said, however, that the members of the Central
Board should be chosen by the Council of the
League of Nations, and we added that the United
States and Germany would be asked to propose
a candidate to the Electoral Body.
Once the United States have been invited by
the League of Nations to be represented on the
Central Board, we all hope that the United
States Government will consent to sign the
Convention.
The President
7 ranslation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I do not want to take up any
definite position with regard to the question
raised by the delegate of Switzerland. I
should like, however, to remind the Confe-
rence of a precedent. When the election of the
members of the Permanent Court of Interna-
tional Justice took place, ratification by Mem-
bers of the League of Nations was not a neces


sary qualification for taking part in the voting.
This precedent might be useful to us.
At first sight it would appear natural that, to
be entitled to rights arising out of a convention,
it is necessary first to have signed and ratified
it. Rights imply obligations. But in certain
cases, as in this one, it may be advisable not to
draw too hard-and-fast a line. This very
morning we heard a reservation made to the
effect that the ratification of a certain Power
would only be given when the constitution of
the Central Board was known. Should one
of the States which, under the Italian proposal,
are to be invited to nominate a representative
on the Electoral Body accept that invitation, is
it not dangerous to insist on previous ratification
of the Convention by that State ? I do not
see the use of making such restrictions. We
are in a position in which it is better to be vague
than to be exact. In my opinion, it would be
preferable to leave things as they are.
The President
Translation : Mr. Riddell, delegate of Can-
ada, will address the Conference.
M. Riddell (Canada) :
I think we are greatly indebted to the dis-
tinguished delegate of Italy for getting us out
of a rather difficult position. I think his reso-
lution is very much to the point. It has been
said that the resolution might enter more into
detail, but I think, as the previous speaker
has said, that vagueness is probably one of its
chief assets. At this stage of its considera-
tion, I think it is quite sufficiently detailed and
defined. On behalf of my Government, I shall
have the greatest pleasure in supporting this
proposal if it is put to the vote.
The President
Translation : M. El Guindy, delegate of
Egypt, will address the Conference.
M. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : During last Friday?s meeting,
at the request of the President, I made certain
comments on Article 19- These comments
have been circulated under the name of ?Pro-
posals?. I should like to make it quite clear
that I made comments and not proposals.
I said that, under the old text, the States which
are not Members of the League of Nations were
kept somewhat at a distance. Countries in
Asia, Europe and North and South America
were represented, but Africa was not.
According to the Italian proposal, I see that the
task of choosing the members of the Central Board
is to be entrusted to the Council of the League
of Nations. I have every confidence in the
wisdom of the Council and I have no doubt
that its choice will satisfy everybody. Under
these circumstances, I withdraw the comments
that I have made.
The President
Translation : I call upon M. Falcioni, dele
gate of Italy, to speak.
IVI. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : I should like to repeat what
I said this morning. When making my pro-
posal, I had laken into consideration parti-
cularly the absolute confidence which we all
have in the Council of the League of Nations.
Yes, we all trust tire League of Nations, and
I hope that the whole of my proposal will be
accepted. It will be the task of the Drafting
Committee to make certain alterations in form
alterations which will not change the substance
of my proposal.
The President
Translation : No one else has asked to
speak. The Conference has had before it an
amendment to the Spanish proposal. This
amendment falls to the ground, and the
same applies to the Portuguese proposal and
the proposal of the Swiss delegation.
The suggestion of the Egyptian delegation has
just been withdrawn. The observations of
M. El Guindy will be entered in the record of
this meeting.
The Conference has still before it the Italian
proposal, to which no real opposition has been
made, though it has been agreed that certain
slight drafting alterations will have to be made
by the Drafting Committee.
* Subject to this reservation, I think that the
proposal can be referred to the Drafting Com-
mittee.
I would ask the first delegate of the Kingdom
of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes to be so good
as to attend the meeting of the Drafting Com-
mittee when it discusses the final wording of
Article 19.
[VI. von Eckardt (Germany) :
Translation : I cannot vote for the Italian
proposal, for the reasons which I had the honour
to explain this morning.
The President
Translation : The statement made by the
German delegation will be included in the
record of the meeting.
Article 19 was approved at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article 20.
The text of Article 20 was read as follows;
?The Council of the League of Nations
shall, in consultation with the Board,
make the necessary arrangements for the
organisation and working of the Board,
with the object of assuring the full tech-
nical independence of the Board in carrying
out its duties under the present Conven-
tion, while providing for the control of
the staff in administrative matters by the
Secretary-General.
?The Council shall also, in consultation
with the Governments of any Contracting
Parties which are not Members of the
League, take the necessary measures to
allocate the expenses of the Board among
the Contracting Parties.
?The Secretary-General shall appoint
the secretary and staff of the Board on the
nomination of the Board and subject to
the approval of the Council.
The President
Translation : The Portuguese delegation
has brought forward a proposal with regard to
Article 20 to the effect that it would be desi-
rable to fix beforehand some basis for the
allocation of expenses, as, for instance, the
population of each country or some other


clearly defined basis. The discussion is now
open. I should like to point out to you that
the Portuguese proposal is not, strictly speak-
ing, an amendment it is only a suggestion.
M. Yovanovitch, delegate of the Kingdom
of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, will address
the Conference.
IVS. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats
and Slovenes) :
Translation : I should like to know on
what basis the expenses of the Committee will
be allocated. This is one of the most important
questions for us.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
Rapporteur :
As Rapporteur, perhaps I should explain
to the Conference that the Sub-Committee
deliberately avoided dealing with this question,
which is one of some difficulty. We thought
it best to leave it to the Council of the League
of Nations to settle the matter in consultation
with the interested countries.
The Conference will see that it is proposed,
under Article 20, to place the expenses on the
Contracting Parties that is, the signatory
States and it is impossible to forecast which
the signatory States will be. I suggest, therefore,
that it must be left to the Council, which
will represent a large number of the signa-
tory States which are Members of the League,
in consultation with those States which are not
Members of the League, to decide what pro-
portion of the expenses should be borne by
each country.
The Council, I suggest, is in a far better posi-
tion than we are to decide the matter, and I
recommend the Conference to leave it where
Sub-Committee A left it and not to attempt
to deal with it here. If we did attempt to
deal with it here, I think we should find our-
selves involved in a very long and difficult
discussion, which, I am sure, at this stage of
the proceedings, is not desired by any of us.
The President
1 ranslation : M. Rodriguez, delegate of
Portugal, will address the Conference.
M. Rodriguez (Portugal)
Translation : Sir, taking advantage of your
invitation to the Conference on Friday last, I
ventured to submit a few suggestions ; one
of them has been rejected. We are now dis-
cussing the second ; and I thought it better,
in order to avoid surprises later on for sur-
prises are always disagreeable to mention
certain principles according to which the dis-
tribution of expenditure would be made. I
see, however, from what Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne has told us, that the subject has already
been throughly examined, and, in view of the
well-known impartiality of the Council, to which
the allocation of expenditure is to be entrusted,
I withdraw my proposal.
M. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) :
7 ranslation : I beg to ask the Conference to
agree to a recommendation being made to the
Council that it should allow countries which
are not represented on it to be so represented
when the expenditure is being allocated. It
seems to me that that would be quite fair.
The President
Translation : M. Falcioni, delegate of Italy,
will address the Conference.
M. Falcioni (Italy)
1 ranslation : As a result of the declaration
which I had the honour to make in respect of
Article 19, and in conformity with that decla-
ration, I think it would be advisable to add to
Article 20 a sentence such as this : ?The secre-
tariat of the Central Board shall form an integral
part of the Secretariat of the League of Na-
tions'?. This sentence might be placed after
the words ?under the present Convention??.
This is an addition which is not only advisable
but necessary.
The President
Translation : I call upon Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne, delegate of the British Empire, to speak.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
1 hope that the Italian delegate will not
press his suggestion. The wording of this
article was very carefully settled in consultation
with the Secretary-General himself. Sir Eric
Drummond is perfectly satisfied with the word-
ing as it stands. It gives him the admini-
strative control of the staff, while leaving the
staff, in regard to the technical work, free to
act under the orders and control of the Board.
The solution, I think, is a satisfactory one, and
I suggest that we accept it without attempting
now to modify the words.
M. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : I will not press my suggestion
since Sir Malcolm Delevingne asks me not to
do so. It seems to me that we cannot vote
on Article 20 without bringing it into agreement
with Article 19. That was why I desired to
lay down that the secretariat of the Central
Board should form an integral part of the Secre-
tariat of the League of Nations. I prefer,
however, to meet the wishes of Sir Malcolm
Delevingne.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
1 am greatly obliged to the delegate of
Italy.
The President
Translation : 1 would like to ask the dele-
gate of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and
Slovenes whether his proposal constitutes a
formal recommendation, and, if so, I would
beg him to suomit it to me in writing. Or
would he think it sufficient if the ideas expressed
by him were mentioned in the record of the
meeting ?
M. Yovanovitch (Kingdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes) ;
Translation : lam satisfied if they are men-
tioned in the record of the meeting.
Article 20 was approved at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee .


Article 21.
The text of Article 21 was read as follows :
?The Contracting Parties agree to send
in annually before December 31st to the
Permanent Central Board set up under
Article 19 estimates of the quantities of
each of the substances covered by the
Convention to be imported into their
territory for internal consumption during
the following year for medical, scientific
and other purposes.
?These estimates are not to be regarded
as binding on the Government concerned,
but will be for the purpose of serving as a
guide to the Central Board in the discharge
of its duties.
?Should circumstances render necessary
an increase in these quantities in any
country in the course of the year, such
country may send revised figures to the
Central Board/?
The President
Translation : We have received a proposal
from the Swiss delegation with regard to the
third paragraph of this article. The proposal
is as follows ;
?Should circumstances make it necessary
for any country, in the course of the year,
to modify its estimates, the country in
question shall communicate the revised
figures to the Central Board.?
1 declare the discussion on Article 21 and the
amendment submitted by the Swiss delegation
to be open.
M. Dinichert, delegate of Switzerland, will
address the Conference.
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation: I should simply like to make it
clear a point which the members of the Confe-
rence must certainly have realised that we are
not, strictly speaking, dealing with a new proposal
but with a question of drafting. This proposal
we take the liberty of submitting to the Draft-
ing Committee, together with a few others.
The meaning of the paragraph we are pro-
posing to you is the same as that of the article
which has already been submitted, but we
consider that the wording is better.
The President
Translation : M. Chodzko, delegate of Po-
land, will address the Conference.
M. Chodzko (Poland) :
Translation : We raised the question of
codeine because we thought that, if an exact
estimate of the quantities provided for in the
Convention was to be made, it must be recog-
nised that the question of codeine ought to
be taken into consideration. In fact, the
manufacture of codeine requires a larger quan-
tity of raw material than that provided for
in Article 21. I think that this point is covered
by Article 22, paragraph 1 ( h ), which says :
?The amount of such substances used for
the production of other derivatives . . . shall
be separately stated?. If this is the case,
I shall make no objection to Article 20.
The President
Translation : M. Perrot, delegate of France
will address the Conference.
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : In Sub-Committee F we de-
cided to include codeine and other non-narcotic
substances in the statistics for the use of mor-
phine. Morphine being in this case a raw mate-
rial, we cannot bring codeine into the article
on narcotic drugs, but we have asked Sub-
Committee F to provide that the quantity of
codeine prepared in factories should be included
in the statistics along with the amounts of
other non-narcotic substances.
The President
Translation : Do any other members wish
to speak on Article 21 ? Since no one wishes
to speak, Article 21 will be referred to the
Drafting Committee.
Article 21 was adopted at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article 22.
The text of Article 22 was read as follows :
?1. The Contracting Parties agree to
send annually to the Central Board, in a
manner to be prescribed by the Board,
within three (in the case of paragraph (c),
five) months after the end of the year, as
complete and accurate statistics as possible
relative to the preceding year, showing :
?(a) The production of raw opium
and coca leaves ;
?( b) Manufacture of the substances
covered by Chapter 111 of the present
Convention and the raw material used
for such manufacture. The amount of
such substances used for the production
of other derivatives not covered by the
Convention shall be separately stated ;
?(c) Stocks of the substances covered
by Chapters II and HI of the present
Convention in the hands of wholesalers
or held by the Government for consump-
tion in the country for other than
Government purposes ;
?{d) Consumption, other than for
Government purposes, of the substances
covered by Chapters II and 111 of the
present Convention ;
?(c) The amounts of each of the
substances covered by the present Con-
vention which have been confiscated on
account of illicit import or export ; the
manner in which the confiscated sub-
stances have been disposed of shall be
stated, together with such other infor-
mation in regard to such confiscation and
disposal as may be prescribed by the
regulations of the Board.
?The statistics referred to in paragraphs
(a) to (c) above shall be communicated by
the Central Board to the Contracting
Parties.
?2. The Contracting Parties agree to
forward to the Central Board, in a manner
to be prescribed by the Board, within four
weeks after the end of each period of three
months, the statistics of their imports from
and exports to each country of each of
the substances covered by the present
Convention during the preceding three
months. These statistics will, in such
cases as may be prescribed by the Board, be


sent by telegram, except when the quan-
tities fall below a minimum amount which
shall be fixed in the case of each substance
by the Board.
?3. In furnishing the statistics in pur-
suance of this article, the Governments
shall state separately the amounts imported
or purchased for Government purposes, in
order to enable the amounts required in
the country for general medical and scien-
tific purposes to be ascertained. It shall
not be within the competence of the Central
Board to question or to express any opi-
nion on the amounts imported or purchased
for Government purposes or the use
thereof.
?4. For the purposes of this article,
substances which are held, imported or
purchased by the Government for eventual
sale are not regarded as held, imported or
purchased for Government purposes.?
The President
Translation : In respect of Article 22, we
have a proposal from the Swiss delegation which
might be referred to the Drafting Committee,
as it does not seem to involve any question of
principle.
The text of the Swiss proposal is as follows :
?The Contracting Parties agree to send
to the Central Board, in a manner to be
prescribed by the Board, within three (in
the case of paragraph (c), five) months
after the end of the year, as complete and
accurate statistics as possible relative to
the preceding year, showing ;
?( a ) The production of raw opium
and coca leaves ;
?(b) The manufacture of the sub-
stances covered by Chapter 111 of the
present Convention and the raw material
used for such manufacture ; the quan-
tities of raw materials used in the pro-
duction of other derivatives not covered
by the Convention shall be separately
stated.
?Place at the end of Article 22 the para-
graph or sub-section worded as follows : The
statistics referred to in paragraphs (a),
(b ), (c), (d) and ( e) shall be communicated
by the Central Board to the Contracting
Parties?, and word it thus :
? 'The statistics referred to in sub-sec-
tions 1, 2, and 3 shall be communicated
by the Central Board to the Contracting
Parties?. ?
Further, we have a proposal from the Egyp-
tian delegation to replace the words ?after the
end of each period of three months? in para-
graph 2 by the words ?after the end of each
half-year?.
Article 22, together with the two amend-
ments, is open for discussion.
M. El Guindy, delegate of Egypt, will address
the Conference.
IVI. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : I submitted the above amend-
ment because I found, during conversations
with several of our colleagues, that many of
them thought it would be difficult to supply
figures quarterly. The difficulty lies not in the
statistics themselves but in the question of the
staff which would be necessary to prepare the
statistics. I believe, moreover, that the result
would be the same if we only compiled the
statistics every six months.
The President
Translation : M. Kircher, delegate of
France, will address the Conference.
M. Kircher (France)
Translation : Under Article 22, all the
Contracting Powers are obliged to supply quar-
terly statistics of their imports and exports of
all the substances covered by the Convention.
The Egyptian delegate has just brought up a
question which has already been considered at
length in the Sub-Committees, namely, that of
the periods which should elapse between the
rendering of these statistics. We are of opinion
that to supply these statistics quarterly is a very
heavy task and altogether out of proportion to
the results that can be hoped from it. We there-
fore support the proposal made by the Egyptian
delegation that the Powers should only be
obliged to supply these statistics every six
months. We even think that annual statistics
would be quite sufficient.
As I said the other day, we must not be satis-
fied with words. We must consider from a
practical point of view what will be the con-
sequence of the measures contained in the
International Convention. With this object,
and in order to show clearly what the conse-
quences of our decisions would be, I have made
a small calculation which I beg to lay before
you.
For fifteen years I have been the head of the
Customs and Excise in Indo-China, and I have
been compiling statistics during the same period.
I know how much work this task involves, and
I am also acquainted with the value of the
information that may be derived from such
statistics. If you will allow me, we will consider
the work that all the Powers in the world
would have to undertake as the result of having
to supply quarterly statistics of their imports
and exports, and we will also consider what
results the Board would be able to derive from
such statistics.
We shall then see whether the results
obtained will be commensurate with the labour
expended. The substances that we shall have
to include in our statistics are the following :
medicinal opium, morphine, cocaine, diacetyl-
morphine, morphine salts, cocaine salts, diacetyl-
morphine salts, raw cocaine, ecgonine, medicinal
preparations containing morphine, medicinal
preparations containing cocaine and medicinal
preparations containing diacetylmorphine. Yes-
terday we added two new substances : Indian
hemp and certain resins. In my calculations
I did not take these two substances into account ;
if we add them to the twelve which I have just
enumerated, we get fourteen substances. But
to make my calculations easier I will only base
them on twelve.
Under the terms of one of the paragraphs of Ar-
ticle 22, the States must divide the figures they
supply into two categories : (1) the quantities
needed in the country for the whole requirements
of medicine; and (2) the quantities imported or
purchased for Government purposes. We have
therefore not twelve products to consider but


twenty-four, since each of these twelve is to
be divided into two : one for State purposes
and the other for the requirements of the public.
Moreover, we are obliged to supply these figures
both in respect of imports and of exports.
In respect of imports, we have to give
figures for all countries of the world, and the
same for exports, for we may import from any
part of the world and also export to any part
of the world. If we take into account the fact
that there are about sixty nations and about
seventy-five colonies, we shall have to put
down one hundred and thirty-five countries in
respect of imports and exports altogether
two hundred and seventy sets of figures. If
I multiply this figure of 270 by the 24 substances
with which we have to deal, I find that every
three months I shall have to supply you with
6,480 items of information.
If we go a little further and examine the work
of the Board, we find that, when it has received
the 6,480 items for every country of the world,
it will have a total of 388,800 quarterly returns,
including, first, the name of the substance ;
secondly, the nature of the consignment
i.e. whether import or export ; thirdly, the
country receiving or exporting the consignment ;
and, fourthly, the figures for the trade in these
substances. That means 388,800 entries to
examine. Such would be the work of the Board,
and really it is stupendous. I know that
among these 388,800 sets of figures there will
be some where the return will be ?nil?. But
the work for the Board would be there all the
same.
We have been asked to send in this informa-
tion by telegram. That would be a little
dangerous. 388,800 items to be sent by tele-
gram every three months ! All the telegraph
lines and even the wireless services would not
be sufficient.
What would be the practical result of the
enormous work of examining these figures
which would fall on this Office ? What is the
object in view ? It is to enable the Board to
locate any danger immediately and to inter-
vene as soon as possible. Under the terms of
Article 24, a great deal of time must elapse
before any action can be taken. The statistics
must be received, analysed and studied, and
a decision taken. When the eight sages who
are going to constitute the Board have carefully
examined the matter, and when they have
decided that in such-and-such a State there is
excessive production, when they have taken a
decision and written to the country in question
to ask for explanations, when the country has
given those explanations which will take
some time, because no time-limit is laid down
for its reply then the Board will examine
the reply. And during all that time the traffic
will go on, I have made a little calculation
which I will not read to you, but I estimate that
the work of the Board will only be completec.
eleven or twelve months after the expiration
of the three-months period.
I do not think that it is necessary to impose
such a large amount of work on the Board and
on the whole world in order to arrive at so
belated a result. I think that it would be
reasonable only to ask for statistics from the
whole world every six months, and only to
impose every six months on the Board the
work of analysis of the 388,800 items with which
we are going to supply them.
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
This amendment takes me completely by
surprise. It strikes at the very root of the
scheme contained in Chapter VI. That scheme
was the result of long discussions which began
as far back as February or March of last year,
which were continued through the summer and
were finally resumed in Sub-Committee A of
this Conference. Scheme after scheme was
Drought forward and considered, and, in defe-
rence to the strong objections taken by cer-
tain countries, abandoned. Finally, in Sub-
Committee A the scheme which is now before
the Conference was worked out by agreement
between all the parties concerned and submitted
to the plenary Conference as a unanimous
document.
Schemes for the limitation of manufacture,
schemes for control of imports and exports, were
successively abandoned, and we have come
down to a scheme for watching, for supervising,
the course of international trade in these sub-
stances, and for nothing more.
When the scheme was first brought forward,
it was suggested that these statistics of imports
and exports should be made monthly. A long
discussion took place in Sub-Committee A on
that point. The representatives of one or
two delegations, including the representative
of France, desired to make them annual. That
could not be accepted by I think I am right
in saying the majority of the delegations
represented on the Sub-Committee. Finally,
a compromise was effected, and accepted by
the French delegate, that the statistics should
be rendered quarterly. It is with extreme
surprise that I listened to the speech of M.
Kircher, because in effect it advocates the
abandonment of the compromise which was
reached and which was accepted, as we all
understood, by the French delegation.
Why do we lay so much stress on these sta-
tistics being rendered quarterly ? The point
is this : the sole purpose for which this
Board is to be created is to watch the course of
the international traffic, to see where these
drugs are going ; in cases where excessive
quantities are being sent to a particular country
or a particular place and that country or place
is likely to become a centre of illicit traffic, the
Board should be able to take action, first by
enquiry from the country concerned, and then,
if the explanations are unsatisfactory, by making
a recommendation to the exporting countries to
stop their exports.
I think the Conference will agree with me
that the Board can only discharge that duty
if it receives these statistics of imports and
exports at fairly frequent intervals. It is
of little use for the Central Board to receive
these statistics only twice a year. By that
time the whole of the damage may have been
done ; large quantities of the drugs may have
been imported to a particular place, and the
Board will only hear of it six, five or four months
after the import has been effected. It will
then be powerless to take any action which will
be of real value.
It is true that, even with quarterly statistics,
there may be some delay. We have had to
The President


make that concession in order to secure the in half a day the statistics could be ready.
n nnconf rvf F o ominfrinc rl Acimrl 1 � x. l X ~ .. j ? i
consent of the countries which desired a longer
period. But, if there may be some delay with
quarterly statistics, the delay which would
take place with six-monthly statistics would be
very much greater. M. Kircher dwelt on the
delay that would necessarily elapse, but does
he improve the situation by extending the
period over which statistics are to be furnished ?
It makes that situation, on the contrary, very
much worse.
I do not want to say very much regarding the
figures the rather fanciful figures, if I may
say so that M. Kircher has submitted to the
Conference. M. Kircher claims to have had
experience with statistics. I might make the
same claim. I know that the picture which
M. Kircher has drawn of the probable results
of this scheme is painted in very violent colours.
I cannot imagine that Indo-China would have
388,800 separate items to report every quarter
to the Central Board. I am quite sure Great
Britain will not, and if Great Britain will not
I do not think it is likely that Indo-China will.
If we examine M. Kircher?s train of argument
closely, it really amounts to this : that the
Central Board, on any showing, will be quite
useless, and, as it will be quite useless, why
not give the countries concerned as little
trouble as possible ? That is a possible view,
but, if you believe that, why vote for the Cen-
tral Board at all ? If there is to be a Central
Board, if it is to be entrusted with the task of
watching the course of the international traffic,
if it is to be put in a position in which it can
really discharge its duties and keep its finger,
as it were, on the pulse of this trade, it must be
furnished with the materials to enable it to do so.
It must have those materials at as frequent
intervals as possible. If the materials are
only given to it months after an event has taken
place, there might as well be no Central Board
at all.
I appeal most strongly to the Conference to
maintain the compromise which was worked out
with much trouble and after long discussions
in Sub-Committee A, which was submitted by
Sub-Committee A to this Conference with una-
nimity, and which we believe (though it does
not fulfil the expectations which were enter-
tained at the time this Conference was sum-
moned) does provide a seed from which valuable
work may grow. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : M. de Myttenaere, delegate
of Belgium, will address the Conference.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium) ;
Translation : I agree with what Sir Malcolm
Delevingne has just said. As far as the Egyptian
proposal is concerned, I beg to remark that the
collection of statistics of exports and imports
cannot give rise to any difficulty.
In Belgium we use the following system,
which has proved satisfactory : we give per-
sons authorised to traffic in drugs a stock of
forms. When requesting authority to import
or export, the trader sends us the necessary
number of forms. Two forms, as a rule, are
sufficient ; one goes into our files and the
other is handed to the person concerned.
When the moment comes to prepare statistics,
?\ve should take, on the one hand, the import
forms and, on the other, the export forms, and
Our system is therefore a very practical one.
If anyone wished to handle the figures as
M. Kircher does, they could be made to say
a good many things that will never be realised
in practice. I propose to the Conference that
we should begin with quarterly statistics. If
we find that the work is impossible, we could
always decide that they should be supplied
every six months.
The President
Translation : M. Kircher, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
M. Kircher (France) :
Translation: I intervened in this question for
the very reason that I desire the Central Board
to be a serious body, doing useful work ; other-
wise, I should not have gone back to a question
which was considered by a Sub-Committee
which did me the honour of asking me to
give it information as to the manner in which
we prepared our statistics, the time required
for such work and the time required to send
statistics from the Far East to Geneva.
I do not wish it to be said that the Central
Board is a mountain giving birth to a mouse,
and, I maintain that, when making the cri-
ticism that I just now laid before the Conference,
I was acting in the best interests of the Central
Board. What we are really concerned with
is the results which we shall obtain. Will they
actually be commensurate with the enormous
labour which we are going to demand from the
whole world and from the Central Board ?
Ido not think so. No argument has been
brought forward to show that they will.
The work involved in supplying statistics
to the Central Board is more complicated than
the Belgian delegate thinks, for I should need
more than half a day to prepare the statistics
for Indo-China, and I know the enormous
labour required by the preparation of statistics
of imports and exports through Customs offices.
I should like to correct a small mistake made
by Sir Malcolm Delevingne. Every country
would have to supply 6,480 items of information
and naturally each of the British colonies would
have to supply as many. This mass of paper
does not appear to me likely to give the results
we are seeking.
I am not raising a question of principle
far from it. I am asking this Conference to
consider whether it is really necessary to impose
such a large amount of work in order to achieve
so meagre a result. We must see to it that the
Board does not make itself ridiculous throughout
the world by inviting a comparison between
the work it will perform and the enormous
labour which these statistics will require and
the enormous sums they will cost. Should
the Conference decide in favour of three months,
we will supply quarterly statistics. I am of
opinion, however, that half-yearly statistics
would give us everything we can reasonably
require from the Board.
The President
Translation : As no one else has asked to
speak, we will take a vote.
Those in favour of retaining the clause as it
stands in the draft will please rise.
[Eleven delegations voted in favour of retaining
the clause.)


Those in favour of the Egyptian delegation?s
amendment will please rise.
[Nine delegations supported the Egyptian
proposal.)
The President
Translation : It is decided by eleven votes to
nine that the text of the present draft shall be
retained.
M. El Guindy, delegate of Egypt, will
address the Conference.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : This draft Convention was
drawn up before the question of Indian hemp
came before the Conference. I would beg to
point out that in Article 22 [a] we have : ?The
production of raw opium and coca leaves?. I
propose we should add the words ?and Indian
hemp?.
The President
Translation : Have any members of the
Conference any remarks to make on the addi-
tion which the Egyptian delegate has just
proposed ?
Mr. Walton, delegate of India, will address
the Conference.
Mr. Walton (India) :
The difficulty about that proposal is that the
substance in question is prepared from a plant
which grows wild, and there would therefore be
extreme difficulty in obtaining the statistics
required. I would not see so much objection
to an amendment of the following character ;
?[a) The production of raw opium and coca
leaves and the cultivation of indian hemp?.
I do not know if that would be agreeable to
the honourable delegate of Egypt, but the Indian
delegation really sees some difficulty in the actual
wording of the amendment proposed by him.
M. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : I do not think that Indian
hemp is a plant which grows wild to any greater
extent than the coca leaf.
The President
Translation ; M. Perrot, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : I have some remarks of a
technical nature to make with regard to this
question. I do not think that Indian hemp
can be put on the same footing as coca leaves
and raw opium. Coca leaves, whether in a
wild state or cultivated, are well known, very
clearly defined and only used for one purpose ;
the manufacture of cocaine. Indian hemp
is a plant which may be more or less harmful.
But hemp is cultivated all over the world for
various purposes, and the delegate of Egypt,
whom I strongly supported in this question
of Indian hemp he must admit that will
perhaps allow me to say that I really do not
see how it would be possible to get statistics
for this plant from India and Central Asia, which
are the only regions in which it is produced.
If he can suggest any solution of this problem,
I should be very happy to examine it with
him, but I do not see how it would be possible
to amplify paragraph [a) in the way he proposes.
Translation : We will take a vote on the
Egyptian amendment. Would those in favour
please rise.
[Two delegations voted in favour.)
The Egyptian amendment was therefore rejected.
IVI. Ei Guindy (Egypt)
Translation : lam really surprised that we
have imposed restrictions on Indian hemp and
that we are not including it in the statistics
like the other substances.
The President
Translation : Are there any other remarks
on Article 22 ?
M. Bourgois, delegate of France, will address
the Conference.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : The last sentence of para-
graph [e) reads as follows ;
?The manner in which the confiscated
substances have been disposed of shall
be stated, together with such other infor-
mation in regard to such confiscation and
disposal as may be prescribed by the regu-
lations of the Board.?
It should, I think, be worded in a less drastic
manner. I should like the sentence to read
as follows :
"The manner in which the confiscated
substances have been disposed of and
all other information?...
The President
Translation : I think this should be referred
to the Drafting Committee.
M. Bourgois (France) ;
Translation : I agree.
I have one other remark to make on Article
22 in respect of the last sentence of paragraph 2.
I should like the sentence ?except when the
quantities fall below a minimum amount which
shall be fixed in the case of each substance by
the Board?, to be worded in a more elastic
manner and to be referred to the Drafting
Committee for that purpose. We cannot, for
instance, so far as the South Sea Islands are
concerned, send telegrams in respect of every
amount, large or small ; we might do so for
very large quantities, but I should like the
wording of this paragraph to give us a little
more latitude.
The President
Translation : M. Dinichert, delegate of
Switzerland, will address the Conference.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : In order to settle our pro-
posal, I note the fact that it is quite understood
that the following sentence will appear at the
end of Article 22 : ?The statistics referred to
under Nos. 1, 2 and 3 shall be communicated by
the Central Board to the Contracting Parties?.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.


Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I see no objection to the proposal of the
Swiss delegation that the sentence in question
should be placed at the end of the article ;
but I think that we should be quite clear as
to what is in the mind of the Swiss delegation
in making this proposal.
It was not intended by the Sub-Committee
that these quarterly statistics should be com-
municated immediately to all the Contracting
Parties. On the contrary, a very strong opinion
was expressed in particular, by the dele-
gation of Japan that these quarterly sta-
tistics might contain very valuable information
which ought not to be divulged to the prejudice
of the countries that furnished the statistics.
I think that we have inserted in this chapter
a special provision to that effect.
If the intention of the Swiss amendment is to
make those statistics immediately available to all
the Contracting Parties, I think the Conference
ought not to accept it ; but if the intention
is merely that the statistics of import and
export should, in due time, when any danger
of their being used to the prejudice of the coun-
tries furnishing them has disappeared, be made
available, then I see no objection to it. The
Central Board would, I think, in the ordinary
course, in their annual report, furnish informa-
tion as to the exports and imports during the
preceding year.
I should like to be quite clear about that ;
if it was what M. Dinichert intended, I think
the Drafting Committee could quite well accept
his proposal.
The President
Translation : M. Dinichert, delegate of
Switzerland, will address the Conference.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation: I must admit that lam greatly
surprised by the objections which I have just
heard. We thought that the idea of the scheme
was that the statistics whatever be their
nature supplied to the Central Board should
be communicated to the Governments. Natu-
rally, a distinction may be made between
these statistics that is to say, that some may
be regarded as being of a more or less confiden-
tial nature so far as the Government are con-
cerned. I am disagreeably surprised by the
speech I have just heard, which raised a num-
ber of objections that I had not foreseen.
Should these quarterly statistics be of such
a nature that, if brought to the notice of Govern-
ments, or if actually published, they reveal
economic and commercial relations which it
might be advisable to conceal, an entirely new
question is raised. This is the first time that
I have heard it stated that these-quarterly statis-
tics, as compared with half-yearly or yearly
statistics, would be liable to give special infor-
mation with regard to commercial relations.
I would ask Sir Malcolm Delevingne to tell
me how he thinks the Governments will supply
these statistics, if they are to be supplied, in
such a way as not to infringe the secrecy which
each Government is entitled to observe with
regard to such relations. This has never
been considered. If it should be so, the Confe-
rence is faced with the question whether we are
in a position to assume such an obligation on
behalf of our Governments. As regards the
confidential character of the statistics, I think
we should be given more definite information,
if we are to supply them in such a way that they
cannot be published.
Our idea was the following : We desire to
be in a position to carry out as fully as possible
the obligations which we are assuming and will
assume under Article 24. I am of the opinion
that when we receive the reports of the Central
Board with regard to the action which the
Board may think fit to take in respect of this
or that country, and when the Board invites
us to participate in what one may call to
use rather a strong term ?a blockade or boycott,
we shall require these statistics. When I am
requested to give explanations, is the basis of
the information which has led the Central
Board to make that request to be withheld from
me ?
I have no hesitation in saying that, if I had
no access to the statistics supplied to the Board
by the Governments, I should not be in a posi-
tion to fulfil the undertaking provided for in
Article 24. I, in my turn, would beg Sir
Malcolm Delevingne to reconsider the reasons
he has given for not communicating the infor-
mation. This point makes it necessary to
reconsider what we had hitherto intended to
establish.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
I think that perhaps there is a little
misunderstanding between us. I did not
suggest that in those circumstances the Board
would not be able to publish the information
that was necessary to enable the Governments
to take a decision in a particular case.
All that I meant to say was this; These
quarterly statistics of imports and exports
will show the course of trading between one
country and another. It might be that if
they were published immediately by the Cen-
tral Board they would furnish useful informa-
tion either for speculators a point on which,
I think, the French delegation has laid consi-
derable stress or to competitors in the same
line of business in other countries. That we
do not want.
I quite agree with M. Dinichert, however,
that, should a case arise in which the Board
would have to act under Article 24 and to make
a recommendation, it is necessary that the infor-
mation should be made public. In fact, Article
24 provides for a report to be made by the Board
and distributed to all the Governments, and
that report will, of course, contain the informa-
tion necessary to enable the Governments to
arrive at a decision.
The primary purpose of these quarterly sta-
tistics is to enable the course of the interna-
tional traffic to be followed. Except in cases
which might arise under Article 24, it is not
necessary that those statistics should be imme-
diately communicated to the Governments
concerned ; but, should a case arise under
Article 24, then I entirely agree with M. Dini-
chert that the full information will have to be
communicated in the report of the Central
Board so that the Governments concerned might
be in a position to take a proper decision ;
that, I think, is sufficiently provided for by
the text of Article 24.


If M. Dinichert will look at Article 27 he
will find the provision which was inserted by
the Sub-Committee to meet the point raised by
the French and Japanese delegations, and I
think that that text does not go further than
is reasonably necessary. I do not think that
there is really any difference of opinion between
us. Perhaps in those circumstances he will
not press his point.
The President
Translation : M. Dinichert, delegate of
Switzerland, will address the Conference.
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I shall only make a few more
brief remarks now, since, when we have the
second reading, we shall have an opportunity
of once more taking up this subject after having
carefully considered the observations which
have been made to-day.
Under Article 27, it is understood that the
Board shall take all necessary measures to
prevent the information at its disposal from
being published or brought to the knowledge
of speculators who might make an improper
use of it. Now, I was referring only to commu-
nications of a confidential nature, to be made
to Governments, as I expressly said, to
enable them to comply fully with the obli-
gations which they are assuming. We may,
perhaps, have an opportunity of considering this
question when we discuss the articles which
follow.
To return, however, to an idea which I
expressed just now, I would like to tell Sir
Malcolm Delevingne frankly that I see a
real danger in requiring Governments to supply
regularly statistics which, from a commercial
point of view, would certainly be of a confidential
nature. Should such be the case, the Central
Board would have to assume a very heavy
responsibility in respect of the statistics sup-
plied to it. Here and now I make the most
explicit reservation regarding the carrying-
out of this undertaking by my Government,
should the statistics required from us be of a
confidential nature and should it be possible
for them thus to pass into the possession of
persons not entitled to receive them. If
I am to supply statistics which the Conference
regards as confidential, I make the most formal
reservations possible, I repeat, with regard to
continuing to carry out that undertaking the
moment it is seen to be attended with the
disadvantages referred to.
I desire that this very explicit declaration
should be noted in the record of the meeting.
The President
Translation : M. Sugimura, delegate of
Japan, will address the Conference.
M. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation : We are really agreed in prin-
ciple. You are in a favourable position in the
centre of Europe. It is quite easy for you to
take cognisance of these statistics. Our position
is a different one. If, however, there are no
abuses, it does not matter. I ask for guarantees
only in the case of abuses. So long as there are
none we are quite prepared to put up with the
disadvantage of distance.
Should there be any improper practices,
we are quite agreed that they should be
suppressed.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I am most grateful to M.
Sugimura for having given me such whole-
hearted support.
The President
Translation : M. Dinichert said that he
intended to raise this question on the second
reading. Should he desire once more to take
up the question of principle, 1 would ask him,
if possible, to do so now that is to say, on the
first reading.
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I am glad, Sir, to be able to
give you satisfaction. So long as my very
explicit declarations meet with no opposition,
I shall regard the matter as closed.
Article 22 was adopted at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article 23.
The text of Article 23 was read as follows ;
?In order to complete the information
of the Board as to the disposal of the world?s
supply of raw opium, the Governments of
the countries where the use of prepared
opium is temporarily authorised shall, in
a manner to be prescribed by the Board,
in addition to the statistics provided for
in Article 22, forward annually to the Board,
within three months after the end of the
year, as complete and accurate statistics
as possible relative to the preceding year
showing :
?(1) The manufacture of prepared
opium and the raw material used for
such manufacture ;
?(2) The consumption of prepared
opium.
?It is understood that it shall not be
within the competence of the Board to
question or to express any opinion upon
these statistics, and that the provisions
of Article 24 are not applicable to the mat-
ters dealt with in this article, except in
cases where the Board may find that illicit
international transactions are taking place
on an appreciable scale.?
The President
Translation : Does anyone wish to speak
on Article 23 ?
Since no one wishes to speak, I declare Article
23 adopted.
Article 23 was adopted at the first reading,
without discussion, and referred to the Drafting
Committee.
Article 24.
The text of Article 24 was read as follows :
?1. The Central Board shall conti-
nuously watch the course of the interna-
tional trade. If the information at its
disposal leads the Board to conclude that
excessive quantities of any substance cove-
red by the present Convention are accu-
mulating in any country, the Board shall
have the right to ask, through the Secre-
tary-General of the League, for expla-
nations from the country in question.


?2. If no explanation is given within a
reasonable time or the explanation is
unsatisfactory, the Central Board shall
have the right to call the attention of the
Governments of all the Contracting Par-
ties and of the Council of the League of
Nations to the matter, and to recommend
that no further exports of the substances
covered by the present Convention or
any of them shall be made to the country
concerned until the Board reports that
it is satisfied as to the situation in that
country in regard to the said substances.
The Board shall at the same time notify
the Government of the country concerned
of the action taken bjf it. The country, and
any country which exports the substances
in question to it, shall be entitled to
appeal to the Council of the League against
any decision of the Board under this
paragraph.
?3. If any Government is not prepared
to act on the recommendation of the Central
Board, it shall immediately inform the
Board, explaining, if possible, why it is
not prepared to do so.
?4. The Central Board shall have the
right to publish a report on the matter and
communicate it to the Council, which shall
thereupon forward it to the Governments of
all the Contracting Parties.
?5. If in any case the decision of the
Central Board is not unanimous, the views
of the minority shall also be stated.
?6. Any country shall be entitled to
be represented at a meeting of the Central
Board, at which a question under this
Article directly interesting it is considered.?
The President
Translation : The Spanish delegation pro-
poses that paragraphs 3 and 4 of this Article
should be deleted.
The same delegation also proposes another
amendment to the wording of paragraph 9,
which reads as follows :
?Any contracting party which is not
represented on the Central Board shall
be invited to send a representative to
sit on the Board when a question specially
interesting it is brought before the
Board.?
I call upon M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, to speak.
M. Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I think that, when bringing
forward my two amendments, I might be
allowed to ask one question of the Rapporteur
with regard to the following passage at the end
of paragraph 2 of this article : ?shall be entitled
to appeal to the Council of the League?.
I should like to know whether this appeal has
a suspensory effect that is to say, whether
the recommendation and the action taken by
the Board remain in suspense so long as the
Council of the League of Nations has not come
to a decision on the matter.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
I do not think the point really arises. The
decision of the Board is, after all, not a
binding decision of a court of law but merely a
recommendation. I do not quite see how
you can suspend a recommendation. The
recommendation would be made to all the
Governments concerned, with the necessary
information, and it rests with the Governments
concerned to decide whether they will act
upon it or not.
Should the country concerned appeal to the
Council of the League, that is a matter which
the other Governments can take into account or
not, as they please. If it were a very flagrant
case of the accumulation of stocks for, appa-
rently, illicit purposes, I imagine most Govern-
ments would decide to act on the recommen-
dation pending a decision by the Council to the
contrary, but it is entirely for each Government
to decide for itself.
I may point out that if it were laid down in
the article that the recommendation was to be
regarded as suspended during the appeal to
the Council, a very long delay might take
place a delay of, possibly, weeks or even
months during which further consignments
of these drugs might be sent to the country in
question.
It seems to me very important, therefore, to
leave the matter as it stands. The Board
will make its recommendation, and the recom-
mendation will be communicated to the
Governments with the facts on which it isbased.
It will rest with each Government to decide
whether itwillltake action on the recommenda-
tion or not. Should there be an appeal to the
Council, that will be a fact which each
Government is entitled to take into considera-
tion ; but it should not, I think, be binding on
the Governments to suspend action on the
recommendation of the Board should they not
desire to do so.
I can hardly think that this is the intention of
the Spanish delegate, but it seems to me that
it would be better to leave the text as it is,
because, as I said at the beginning, this is
a purely voluntary matter for each Government
to act in whatever way it thinks best, in the
light of the circumstances revealed by the action
of the Board.
The President
Translation : M. Bourgois, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : I myself actually intended to
propose a small amendment to this passage.
I think that the difficulty comes from the fact
that words ?entitled to appeal? do not quite
meet the case. I should prefer to replace
them by ?shall be entitled to bring the question
before the Council?.
I would suggest that, in the previous
sentence, instead of saying ?the action taken by
it?, we should say ?the recommendation that
it has made?.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
I am quite prepared to accept these two
modifications.
The President
Translation: M. de Palacios, delegate of Spain,
will address the Conference.


M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : I thank the Rapporteur for
his reply to my question.
Since States are free to take action or not
on the recommendation of the Central Board,
and since they will take into account the fact
that the question has been brought before the
Council, it would be advisable to say that, when
a State brings the question before the Council,
all the signatory States will be advised of the
fact.
The President
Translation : Is that a new amendment ?
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : It is an idea suggested by
the discussion. The Drafting Committee might
take up that suggestion.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
I think it had better be considered by the
Drafting Committee.
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : These are the explanations
that I think I can give with regard to the first
amendment I have submitted, namely, that
paragraphs 3 and 4 should be deleted.
Originally, paragraph 2 was drafted without
the last idea that is raised in the present
wording. No appeal to the Council was provided
for, so that it was only a question of a recom-
mendation made by the Central Board. At
that moment, I found the paragraph which
follows quite natural, namely; ?If any Govern-
ment is not prepared to act on the recommen-
dation of the Central Board, it shall imme-
diately inform the Board, explaining, if possible,
why it is not prepared to do so?.
That was an appeal to the Board itself.
Once an appeal to the Council is provided for,
I do not see the use of retaining this paragraph.
I do not understand why a State appealing to
the Council should simultaneously give expla-
nations to the Central Board.
One of our honourable colleagues was so
good as to explain to me that the position was
not what I had thought, and that it was not
intended to delete paragraph 3. He told me
that paragraph 3 referred to an appeal to the
Central Board when a Government, having
accepted a recommendation, was not prepared
to carry it out. I think that is a somewhat
curious situation ; but, should the Conference
admit that such a situation is possible, I will
not object to retaining paragraph 3, provided
that the wording of the text clearly lays down
that this refers to a case in which a State does
not take action on a recommendation that it
has adopted.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : I agree with the delegate for
Spain. The wording is very obscure, and its
vagueness comes from the very fact that para-
graph 2 was altered in order to add the appeal
to the Council. Paragraph 3is not easy to
understand.
The President
Translation : M. van Wettum, delegate of
the Netherlands, will address the Conference.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
It seems to me that paragraphs 2 and 3
refer to different points. Paragraph 2 provides
for the case of a country which does not agree
with the recommendation of the Board ; it
may then refer the question to the Council.
Paragraph 3 provides for the case of a country
which, although not objecting to a recommen-
dation of the Board, is not prepared to act on
that recommendation.
It will avoid all obscurity and meet the
point raised by the delegate of Spain if, in
paragraph 3, after the words ?if any Govern-
ment? we inserted the words ?though accept-
ing the recommendation as such?. Then it
would read : ?If any Government, though
accepting the recommendation as such, is not
prepared to act on the recommendation of
the Central Board?, etc.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : I continue to share the opinion
of the Spanish delegate. This is a very curious
position for a Government. The question is
still obscure, and I should be very glad to see
it referred to the Drafting Committee. M. de
Palacios and M. van Wettum might attend the
meeting at which the final wording is discussed.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
The question before us is one of principle.
I could not accept the article without that
paragraph.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I think the Conference is in a little danger of
losing itself in subtleties. It is possible ?in
fact, it is probable that the wording is not
as clear as it might be, but the position is not
quite so obscure as I think it has been repre-
sented by one or two of the delegates who
have spoken.
A recommendation is made by the Board
and sent to the Governments. A Government
may decide to act upon it, and then no further
question arises. On the other hand, a Govern-
ment may think the recommendation is wrong.
In that case it can follow one of two courses ;
it can either bring the matter before the Council
and ask the Council to go into the question
further, or it can, as an alternative, without
referring it back to the Council, simply take
a decision Itself that it will not act upon the
recommendation.
I cannot understand the position of a Govern-
ment to take the case which M. van Wettum
has imagined which accepts a recommendation
and declines to act upon it. The two things
seem to me to be quite inconsistent one with
the other. If the Government accepts the
recommendation, of course it acts upon it. It
is only when it does not accept the recommenda-
tion that it refuses to act upon it.
I hope the explanation which I have given
will make the point clear. A Government which
objects to a recommendation made by the
Board, which thinks it wrong, or perhaps not
universally wrong but not applicable to its own
case, can either bring the matter to the notice
of the Council or, on its own motion, it can
decide that it will not act upon it. In the latter
case, paragraph 3of this article requires that
Government to inform the Central Board of


its decision not to act upon the recommendation,
and, if possible, to explain its reasons. The
wording of these two articles can be revised
the Drafting Committee to make the position
quite clear, but I, like M. van Wettum, regard
paragraph 3 as very valuable, and I should be
very sorry to see it suppressed.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : I see that M. Bourgois and
Sir Malcolm Delevingne agree with my views
as regards the position of a Government which,
having accepted a recommendation, is not
disposed to carry it out. But if a delegation
is of opinion that such a situation may arise,
the Conference should take a decision on the
question. If the Conference recognises the
possibility of such a situation, I will agree to
paragraph 3 as amended by the Netherlands
delegation, but if the Conference does not
accept the possibility of such a situation I do
not see the use of paragraph 3.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne has just told us that,
when the Central Board makes a recommen-
dation and the Government accepts it, the
matter is finished. But if the Government
does not accept it and appeals to the Council,
the matter is also settled. If, however, the
question is brought before the Council, I do
not see why the Government should continue
negotiations with the Central Board. That is
the point.
If we desire to leave the two alternatives,
the wording should be clear, and we should say
?that any State shall be entitled to appeal to
the Council of the League of Nations against
any decision of the Board under this article, or
simply to inform the Central Board and to
supply, if possible, the reasons for which it
does not consider that it is able to take such
action?. That is to say, that we lay down
clearly the alternative methods that may be
followed.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
What I said was that if the Government does
not accept the recommendation it has two
alternative courses : it can either take the
matter before the Council or, on its own motion,
it can refuse to act upon the recommendation.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands)
It seems to me that Sir Malcolm Delevingne
has not explained the case dealt with in para-
graph 2. There are not two alternative courses.
It is possible that a recommendation may be
made which a country cannot accept because
it sees that the recommendation would do no
real good. Under paragraph 3, however, a
recommendation may be made which is all right,
but which, for political reasons or others which
perhaps cannot be explained to the Council,
could not be put into effect by the country
concerned. This is quite a different case. To
meet that case the words ?if possible? have
been added. That addition was made on my
suggestion.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : I understood paragraph 3 to
have the meaning given it by Sir Malcolm
Delevingne and also by the delegate of Spain.
I see that some of our number have a third
possibility in mind. 1 think, therefore, that
we might word this paragraph more clearly by
taking account of the third possibility. Our
two colleagues might attend the Drafting Com-
mittee, and we should then be in a position to
submit a clear text to the Conference, which
could decide on it.
The President
Translation : Does the Rapporteur desire
to give his opinion ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
I think the matter ought to be referred to the
Drafting Committee to make the sense clear.
The President
Translation : We will now take the other
amendment proposed by the Spanish delegate
with regard to the wording of paragraph 6.
M. de Palacios, delegate of Spain, will address
the Conference.
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : The amendment to paragraph
6 which I have submitted is one of drafting
only ; it is, however, of some importance,
since it follows the very wording of the Cove-
nant. When a similar case arises in the Council,
the Covenant says :
?Any Member of the League not repre-
sented on the Council shall be invited to
send a representative to sit as a member at
any meeting of the Council during the
consideration of matters specially affect-
ing the interests of that Member of the
League.?
The draft Convention says that in such cases ;
?Any country shall be entitled to be
represented at a meeting of the Central
Board at which a question under this article
directly interesting it is considered.?
At first sight, this seems to mean the same
thing. Nevertheless, the wording which I
propose agrees with that of the Covenant and
gives a better guarantee to countries which are
not represented on the Central Board, for,
according to my proposal, the Central Board
must invite these countries, when a question
which particularly interests them is being
considered.
In the wording which we have before us,
this representation is optional, and the State
concerned can even decide not to avail itself
of this opportunity ; there is no obligation on
the part of the Central Board to notify the coun-
try interested. I desire that the guarantee
should be a more effective one, and, since we
have the Covenant as a precedent, I urge that
my new wording be adopted.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
If, as I understand it, the proposal of the
Spanish delegation is to substitute the word
?invited? for ?entitled?, I have no objection
at all, subject to the views of the Drafting
Committee.
The President
Translation : Article 24 is adopted subject
to the reservation.
Article 24 was adopted at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.


Article 25.
The text of Article 25 was read as follows :
?It shall be the friendly right of any of
the Contracting Parties to draw the atten-
tion of the Board to any matter which
appears to it to require investigation, pro-
vided that this Article shall not be con-
strued as in any way extending the powers
of the Board.?
The President
Translation : Does anyone wish to speak
on this article ?
If no one wishes to speak, I declare the article
adopted.
Article 25 was adopted at the first reading,
without discussion, and referred to the Drafting
Committee.
Article 26.
The text of Article 26 was read as follows ;
?In the case of a country which is not
a party to the present Convention, the
Central Board may take the same measures
as are specified in Article 24, if the infor-
mation at the disposal of the Board leads
it to conclude that there is a danger of
the country becoming a centre of the illicit
traffic ; in that case the Board shall take
the action indicated in the said Article
as regards notification to the country
concerned. Such country shall be entitled
to be represented at the meeting of the
Central Board at which the question is
considered.?
The President
Translation : The Spanish delegation has
proposed an amendment to Article 26.
IVI. Bourgois (France) :
Translation : The amendment which I
wanted to submit is perhaps the same as that
which the delegate of Spain is about to propose.
I desire to replace the words ?intended to be
represented? by the words ?shall be invited?.
The President
Translation : This is the same amendment
as that proposed by M. Palacios.
IVI. Bourgois (France)
Translation : In that case, I withdraw my
amendment.
The President
Translation : M. de Palacios, delegate of
Spain, will address the Conference.
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : The amendment which we
are now going to deal with consists of two
paragraphs and reads as follows.
?Such country shall be invited to send a
representative to be present at the meetings
of the Central Board during which this
question is examined.
?Such country or any other State export-
ing to it any of the substances in question
shall have the right to appeal to the Council
of the League against any decision taken
by the Board under this article.?
The first is connected with that which we
have just considered when dealing with Article
24, paragraph 6. The question affects those
countries which are not Parties to the present
Convention, I think that those countries should
be invited when a question concerning them
is dealt with by the Central Board. It is
the recognised practice to invite countries
which are not Members of the Council but
which are interested in a question, when that
question is dealt with by the Council.
1 also think that, once we provide for the
possibility of the Central Board making a
recommendation concerning a country which
is not a signatory of the Convention, that coun-
try should not only be invited when a question
of interest to it is being dealt with by the Board
but it should also be given the right to take the
question before the Council if necessary.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
I have no objection to that.
The President
Translation : If that is so, Article 26 is
adopted as amended by the Spanish delegation.
Article 26 was approved at the first reading and
referred to the Drafting Committee.
Article 26 ( a ).
The President
Translation : Before opening the discussion
on Article 27 I would bring to your notice
another amendment proposed by the Spanish
delegate.
I call upon M. de Palacios, delegate of Spain,
to address the Conference.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain) ;
Translation : The article which I propose
for insertion in the Convention reads as follows :
?The right of appeal to the Council
of the League as laid down in Articles 24
and 26 shall not prevent the parties exer-
cising, if necessary, their right under the
second paragraph of Article 11 of the Cove-
nant of the League of Nations.?
Naturally, it would be necessary to alter the
wording of the beginning of this article,
since the right of appeal means the right to
take a question before the Council of the League
of Nations. The Covenant says :
?It is also declared to be the friendly
right of each Member of the League to
bring to the attention of the Assembly or
of the Council any circumstance whatever
affecting international relations which
threatens to disturb international peace or
the good understanding between nations
upon which peace depends.?
All Members of the League possess, and are
entitled to exercise, the right of drawing the
attention of the Assembly or the Council to
any matter. When we have once laid down
here the right to bring a question before the
Council, doubts may arise as to the possibility
of exercising the right of appeal already pro-
vided. The attention of the Council may be
drawn in a friendly manner to a state of things
calculated to disturb good understanding
between the parties. This question may be raised
in a general way, as was the case the other day,
namely, when a member of the British dele-
gation replied to me that it was obvious that the
Covenant continued to have its full effect and
that nothing in this Convention could in any
way alter its provisions.
I then reserved the right to bring this up
again. This is why I think it would be advis-
able to insert this Article 26 (a). Should,
however, the Drafting Committee consider it
superfluous, I shall not press the matter, on


condition that a declaration by the Rapporteur
or the Chairman of the Drafting Committee
is included in the records of the Conference.
The President
Translation : Does the Rapporteur of the
Sub-Committee desire to say anything in re-
gard to the Spanish proposal ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
The question is one which I confess I have
not considered very deeply ; but I cannot
imagine that any provision we insert in this
Convention can possibly affect the terms of the
Covenant of the League of Nations. No doubt
the Drafting Committee will be willing to look
into the matter further in consultation with
the legal experts of the Secretariat, and perhaps
we may be able to give such an explanation at
the second reading as will satisfy the Spanish
delegate.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I agree.
Article 27.
The text of Article 27 was read as follows :
?The Central Board shall present an
annual report on its work to the Council
of the League. This report shall be
published and communicated to all the
Contracting Parties.
?The Central Board shall take all
necessary measures to ensure that the
estimates, statistics, information and
explanations which it receives under Arti-
cles 21, 22, 23, 24, 25 or 26 of the present
Convention shall not be made public in
such a manner as to facilitate the opera-
tions of speculators or injure the legitimate
commerce of any Contracting Party.?
Article 27 was adopted at the first reading with-
out discussion and referred to the Drafting
Committee.
The Conference rose at 6.25 p.m.

108. FINAL READING OF THE DRAFT
PROTOCOL.
The President
Translation : We will now proceed to the
second reading and I hope the last - of the
draft Convention and the drafts of the Protocol
and Final Act.
Does anyone wish to speak on the draft
Protocol ? If not, it is adopted. It will be
printed in its final form and submitted to you
for signature.
The draft Protocol was adopted.
109. FINAL READING OF THE DRAFT
FINAL ACT.
The President
Translation : The discussion is open on the
draft Final Act.
I will submit the resolutions to you in turn.
Resolutions I, 11, 111, IV and V were adopted.
An amendment concerning the expenses of
the Central Board has been distributed to you.
According to this proposal, a sixth resolution
should be inserted in the Final Act, and the
second paragraph of Article 20 of the Conven-
tion should be omitted.
The text of the proposed new resolution
reads as follows :
?The Conference requests the Council of
the League of Nations to decide to include
in the expenses of the Secretariat the
expenses of the Central Board and its
administrative services.
?It is understood that those Contracting-
Parties which are not Members of the
League will bear their share of the expenses
in accordance with a scale to be drawn up
by agreement with the Council.?
As the British delegation has proposed this
amendment, I call upon the first delegate of
the British Empire to state the reasons for
which his delegation has desired, at the last
moment, to insert this amendment, which, I
think, is a very valuable one.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
Mr. President. It has been remarked by
several delegations that the second paragraph
of Article 20 of the draft Convention would be
somewhat difficult to apply. This paragraph
reads as follows ;
?The Council shall also, in consultation
with the Governments of any Contracting
Parties which are not Members of the League,
take the necessary measures to allocate
the expenses of the Board among the Con-
tracting Parties.?
The effect of this paragraph would be that
the Council would have to distribute the ex-
penses of the Central Board among those States
which from time to time became signatories


of this new Convention. It has been pointed the reservations on the question of Indian hemp
out that the list of States which will be signa-
tories to this new Convention will vary from
time to time as the signatures come in, and this
will make it extremely difficult for the Council
to effect any sort of pro-rata distribution of the
expenses of the Central Board.
It has been suggested that, in order to
remove that difficulty, the expenses should be
borne by the general budget of the League, to-
gether with contributions from those States
which may be signatories to the Convention
but are not Members of the League.
There are numerous precedents for this
procedure and the principle is in fact already
laid down in Article 24 of the Covenant of the
League. It is worth referring to Article 24
in this connection. It says ;
?There shall be placed under the direc-
tion of the League all international bureaux
already established by general treaties if
the parties to such treaties consent. All
such international bureaux and all com-
missions for the regulation of matters of
international interest hereafter constituted
shall be placed under the direction of the
League
?The Council may include as part of the
expenses of the Secretariat the expenses of
any bureau or commission which is placed
under the direction of the League.?
It is proposed, in the amendment which I
have the honour to submit and which has been
drawn up in consultation with several dele-
gations and with the authorities of the Secre-
tariat, to adopt that principle and to ask the
Council of the League to place the expenses
of the Central Board on the general budget of
the League, those States which may be signa-
tories to the Convention but are not Members
of the League contributing a fair share towards
the expenses.
It is not possible for this Conference, by any
article in the Convention itself, to impose a
charge on the budget of the League, and there-
fore it is proposed to insert a new resolution
in the Final Act.
I understand that the proposal is approved
and is regarded as satisfactory by the autho-
rities of the Secretariat. It is understood that
no difficulty is likely to arise, either with the
Council or the Assembly, and I therefore submit
the proposal to the Conference as the simplest
and most convenient method of dealing with
the matter.
The President
Translation : The amendment is adopted by
the Conference, and the second paragraph of
Article 20 of the Convention will accordingly
be suppressed. It is impossible to say as yet
whether this new text will become the sixth
recommendation, because before the meeting
opened I received two new proposals which
will be distributed in a moment. As soon as the
members of the Conference have seen these
proposals, they will be brought up for discus-
sion. . XT XT
You will see that, after Resolution No V,
there is a blank space left for a declaiation to
be filled in by the Persian delegate. This
declaration will also be distributed shortly.
A declaration will also be made, at the time of
signing, by the Siamese delegation regarding
which it made at a previous meeting.
The resolutions before you are adopted, and
we will revert shortly to the two proposals I
have just mentioned.
I have also received an amendment to a very
important article in the draft Convention.
This amendment will be distributed to you
in a moment.
110. FINAL READING OF THE DRAFT
CONVENTION.
The President
Translation : I propose that we begin the
discussion with Chapter VII of the Convention.
{Agreed.)
Chapter VII.
Articles 28-39.
The President
Translation : I must draw your attention
to the fact that the French text of the second
paragraph of Article 38 does not tally with the
English text.
IVI. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation : The English text is the correct
one.
The President
Translation Ihe two texts will be made
to agree.
Articles 28-39 were adopted, subject to the alte-
ration to he made in the French text of Article
38 h
Chapter VI.
Article 19.
The text of Article 19 was read as follows :
?A Permanent Central Board shall be
appointed, within three months from the
coming into force of the present Convention.
?The Central Board shall consist of
eight persons who, by their technical com-
petence, impartiality and disinterestedness,
will command general confidence.
?The members of the Central Board shall
be appointed by the Council of the League
of Nations.
?The United States of America and Ger-
many shall be invited each to nominate one
person to participate in these appointments.
?In making the appointments, conside-
ration shall be given to the importance of
including on the Central Board, in equi-
table proportion, persons possessing a
knowledge of the drug situation, both in
the producing and manufacturing countries
on the one hand and in the consuming
countries on the other hand, and connected
with such countries.
?The members of the Central Board shall
not hold any office which puts them in a
position of direct dependence on their
Governments.
1 The text of these articles as submitted to the
Conference for the final reading was the same as that
included in the Convention as approved (see AIIUCX3O)
with the exception of the French text of the second
paragraph of Article 38, which originally read as
follows : . , ~
? Le Secretaire general de la Societe des M ations
portera a la connaissance de chacun des Membres
de la Societe des Nations parties a la Convention,
et des autres Etats qui parties, toute
denonciation resue par lui.


?The members shall be appointed for a
term of five years, and they will be eligible
for re-appointment.
?The Central Board shall elect its own
President and shall settle its rules of pro-
cedure.
?At meetings of the Board, four members
shall form a quorum.
?The decisions of the Board relative to
Articles 24 and 26 shall be taken by an
absolute majority of the whole number of
the Board.?
The President
Translation : M. Falcioni, delegate of Italy
will address the Conference.
M. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : At the first reading of Articles
19 and 20, I had occasion to put before you
the Italian delegation?s point of view with
regard to the Central Board. Several of my
proposals have been accepted in particular,
the proposal that the Central Board should be
appointed by the Council of the League.
There is, however, one point to which the
Italian delegation has already drawn the Con-
ference?s attention, namely, that the Secre-
tariat of the Central Board should be regarded
as an integral part of tne Secretariat of the
League. The Conference has decided not to
adopt our proposal, and the Italian delegation
has not pressed the point in order to avoid
hindering the progress of our work.
In view of the instructions I have received
from my Government, however, I am bound
to state that I accept the text of the present
Convention subject to a reservation on the
point I have mentioned.
I am glad that the British delegation has
proposed, and the Conference adopted, the
amendment regarding the expenses of the
Central Board.
The President
Translation : The Italian delegate?s reser-
vation will be noted in the record of the pre-
sent meeting.
M. Dinichert, delegate of Switzerland, will
address the Conference.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I do not propose to reopen
the discussion on Article 19, but I should like
to propose a wording for paragraphs 4 and 5
which appears to me to be better as far as the
French version is concerned. I propose that
the following text should be substituted for
paragraph 5 ;
?In making these appointments, the
electoral body shall see that the vacant
seats are equitably distributed among
persons possessing a thorough knowledge
of the drug situation and connected on the
one hand with producing and manufac-
turing countries and on the other with
consuming countries.?
Paragraph 6 should read :
?The members of the Central Board
shall not hold any office which renders them
dependent on their Governments.?
M. Pernambuco (Brazil)
Translation : The text says that four mem-
bers shall form a quorum, but, in view of the
decision to increase the number of members
from seven to eight, I had understood that the
quorum would be five.
The President
Translation: This question was discussed at
some length in the Drafting Committee.
Experience having shown that it is often
difficult for all the members of a Committee,
even if it is a small one, to attend a meeting,
we finally decided that it was better to keep
the quorum at four members. The work of
the Board will thereby be rendered easier.
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : The last paragraph of Article
19 reads
?The decisions of the Board relative
to Article 24 and 26 shall be taken by an
absolute majority of the whole number of
the Board.?
It would be better, therefore, to have a quo-
rum of live, otherwise certain meetings might
be inconclusive.
The President
Translation: We discussed this question also,
and came to the conclusion that there was no
inconsistency between the two paragraphs.
It is provided that four members will be
sufficient for the ordinary work of the Central
Board, as it will be difficult to secure the
presence of more. But in the case of important
decisions, a general rule must be observed, that
is to say, an absolute majority must be obtained.
For these reasons, we decided to keep the text
as it is.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne, delegate of the
British Empire, will address the Conference.
Sip Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
Mr. President I hope that the delegate of
Switzerland will not press his amendment.
The wording of paragraph 5 was very carefully
settled by the Italian delegate with a view to
striking a fair balance between the two oppo-
sing views in the Conference, the view, on the
one side, that the members of the Central Board
should be representative of the consuming, pro-
ducing and manufacturing countries, and the
view, on the other side, that the members of the
Central Board should be entirely independent
of any interests whatever but should be chosen
solely for their technical qualifications and
their impartiality.
We all thought that the Italian delegate
had been very happily inspired in drawing up
the text that he submitted to us last week, and,
on both sides, we were all able to accept his
proposal. The Drafting Committee, in pre-
paring the text which is before the Conference
now, adhered strictly to the substance of the
Italian delegate?s proposal. We did not feel
ourselves entitled, nor did we think it desirable,
to make any modifications of substance in the
text. The modifications we have made are
purely drafting modifications, with one excep-
tion : in order to give rather greater satisfac-
tion to the producing countries, as represented
by the delegate of the Kingdom of the Serbs,
( roats and Slovenes, we added the words which
appear at the end of the paragraph, ?and con-
nected with such countries?. That was a
concession which personally 1 was very loath to


make, but, in order to secure the support of
the whole Conference for our Convention, I
decided, so far as I was concerned, to accept it.
The proposal which the Swiss delegate now
makes seems to me to introduce a fresh idea,
to alter the balance of the Italian proposal and
to make it, if I may say so for myself, much less
acceptable.
It seems to me, also, to be open to objection
for another reason. If I understand his words
rightly, it would confine the Central Board to
persons who had knowledge of the conditions
in the consuming, producing, and manufactur-
ing countries, and who were connected with
such countries. It seems to me quite possible,
and in fact very likely, that the Council may
desire to place on the Board persons with othei
kinds of experience ; for instance, persons dis-
tinguished for their scientific knowledge, for
their medical knowledge and possibly for their
statistical knowledge and experience. It would
be a pity, I think, so to alter the wording as to
exclude any person whom the Council might
consider, by reason of his technical competence
and his standing, to be a desirable addition to
the Board. ? .
I would therefore make an appeal to the Swiss
delegate not to press his proposal. The whole
Conference, if I may judge from the debate last
week, is satisfied with the compromise that was
reached. If we open the debate again we cannot
be sure, at this late hour, what the final result
will be. 1 think the Conference will agree with
me that it is best to adhere to the form of
wording accepted unanimously last week, and
which has been faithfully preserved by the
Drafting Committee.
The President
Translation : I have not yet received the
Swiss delegate?s amendment. If it is to be
discussed, I should like to have it in writing.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : My amendment is ready and
in writing, but I think there is a misunderstand-
ing, for I believe that there is scarcely a word
in my amendment which is not in the text
before us, and vice versa. I do not wish to
press the matter, but I venture very respect-
fully to point out that the paragraph as it
stands is almost unintelligible in French, and
I simply wished to make it clearer.
The President
Translation '. If I am not mistaken, two
amendments have been proposed by the Swiss
delegate, one to paragraph 5 and the other to
paragraph 6.
IVI. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : The amendment to paragraph
6is of trifling importance. I had simply pro-
posed to substitute the words ?which renders
them dependent on their Governments for
the words ?which puts them in a position of
direct dependence on their Governments .
The President
Translation : As far as I can see, the only
change is to leave out the word ?direct .
M, Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I will not press this point
as it is a matter of drafting and is of little
importance.
The President
Translation : I should like to call your
attention to the first line of Article 19. It seems
to me preferable to say ?Un Comite central
permanent sera nomme dans les trois mois qui
suivront I?entree en vigueur de la presente
Convention? rather than ?qui suivront la mise
en vigueur?. {Agreed.)
Article 19, as amended, was adopted.
Article 20.
The text of Article 20 was read as follows :
?The Council of the League of Nations
shall, in consultation with the Board, make
the necessary arrangements for the orga-
nisation and working of the Board, with
the object of assuring the full technical
independence of the Board in carrying out
its duties under the present Convention,
while providing for the control of the staff
in administrative matters by the Secretary-
General.
?The Council shall also, in consultation
with the Governments of any Contracting
Parties which are not Members of the League,
take the necessary measures to allocate
the expenses of the Board among the Con-
tracting Parties.
?The Secretary-General shall appoint the
secretary and staff of the Board on the
nomination of the Board and subject to the
approval of the Council.
The President :
Translation : The second paragraph of this
article will be omitted and a resolution which
will appear in the Final Act will be substituted.
Article 20, as amended, was adopted.
Article 21.
The text of Article 21 was read as follows :
?The Contracting Parties agree to send
in annually before December 31st, to the
Permanent Central Board set up under
Article 19, estimates of the quantities of
each of the substances covered by the
Convention to be imported into their
territory for internal consumption during
the following year for medical, scientific and
other purposes.
?These estimates are not to be regarded
as binding on the Government concerned,
but will be for the purpose of serving as
a guide to the Central Board in the dis-
charge of its duties.
?Should circumstances make it necessary
for any country, in the course of the year,
to modify its estimates, the country in
question shall communicate the revised
figures to the Central Boaid.
The President :
Translation : M. Chodzko, delegate of lo-
land, will address the Conference.
IVI. Chodzko (Poland) ;
Translation : I should like to ask for an expla-
nation on one point. The first paragraph of
Article 21 reads; ?for internal consumption
during the following year for medical, scien-
tific and other purposes?. I should like to
know what the word ?other? means.


Translation : If I remember aright, this
word was the result of a proposal made by
the United States delegation in sub-committee.
I cannot reply directly to the question which
the Polish delegate has just asked, but 1 have
no doubt Sir Malcolm Delevingne can do so.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
The addition of these words "and other pur-
poses? was proposed by the United States
delegation and pressed by them rather strongly.
If I remember rightly, none of the other mem-
bers of the Sub-Committee considered that they
were necessary and we were not quite sure
what their exact effect would be. I suppose
Mr. Neville, the United States delegate on the
Sub-Committee, had in mind, in particular, the
amount of raw opium which would be required
to be imported into those countries in the Far
East where the use of opium for smoking is
still temporarily authorised.
The Sub-Committee generally was of opi-
nion that, so far as that matter was concerned,
the words were not really necessary, because
the functions of the Central Board will not
extend to the importation of opium for smoking
purposes. As the point was pressed by the
United States delegate, however, the Sub-
Committee accepted the words. I have no
strong view about their retention, one way or
the other. If the delegate for Poland thinks
it would be better to leave them out, I should be
quite prepared, for my part, to accept the
suggestion.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : I thank Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne, but I do not wish to make any
proposal regarding the omission of this word.
The President
Translation : The word "other? will there-
fore stand.
Article 21 was adopted.
Article 22
The text of Article 22 was read as follows :
"1. The Contracting Parties agree to
send annually to the Central Board, in a
manner to be prescribed by the Board,
within three (in the case of paragraph (c),
five) months after the end of the year, as
complete and accurate statistics as possible
relative to the preceding year, showing ;
?{a) Production of raw opium and
coca leaves ;
?(b) Manufacture of the substances
covered by Chapter 111 of the present
Convention and the raw material used
for such manufacture. The amount of
such substances used for the production
of other derivatives not covered by the
Convention shall be separately stated ;
(c) Stocks of the substances covered
by Chapters II and 111 of the present
Convention in the hands of wholesalers or
held by the Government for consumption
in the country for other than Government
purposes ;
?{d) Consumption, other than for
Government purposes, of the substances
covered by Chapters II and 111 of the
present Convention ;
?(e) Amounts of each of the sub-
stances covered by the present Conven-
tion which have been confiscated on
account of illicit import or export ; the
manner in which the confiscated sub-
stances have been disposed of shall be
stated, together with such other infor-
mation as may be useful in regard to
such confiscation and disposal.
?The statistics referred to in paragraphs
(a) to (e) above shall be communicated by
the Central Board to the Contracting
Parties.
?2. The Contracting Parties agree to
forward to the Central Board, in a manner
to be prescribed by the Board, within four
weeks after the end of each period of three
months, the statistics of their imports from
and exports to each country of each of the
substances covered by the present Con-
vention during the preceding three months.
These statistics will, in such cases as may
be prescribed by the Board, be sent by
telegram, except when the quantities fall
below a minimum amount which shall be
fixed in the case of each substance by
the Board.
?3. In furnishing the statistics in pur-
suance of this article, the Governments shall
state separately the amounts imported or
purchased for Government purposes, in
order to enable the amounts required in
the country for general medical and scien-
tific purposes to be ascertained. It shall
not be within the competence of the Central
Board to question or to express any opi-
nion on the amounts imported or purchased
for Government purposes or the use thereof.
"4. For the purposes of this article,
substances which are held, imported or
purchased by the Government for eventual
sale are not regarded as held, imported
or purchased for Government purposes.?
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I think perhaps it would be well to make a
small alteration in paragraph ( b) to correspond
with an alteration which the Drafting Committee
has made in paragraph (a) of Article 6.
The question was raised in the Drafting
Committee as to the meaning of the word
?manufacture? ("fabrication? in the French),
and it was agreed that the word had reference
only to the primary substances, such as crude
cocaine and ecgonine, morphine, diacetylmor-
phine and cocaine, and any other narcotic
drugs which might hereafter be added to the
Convention, but the word did not apply to the
compounding of preparations containing those
drugs.
In order to avoid any misunderstanding,
the Drafting Committee altered the text of
Article 6soas to read : ?Confine the manu-
facture of the substances referred to
in Article 4 (b), (c) and (g)?


I suggest that for clearness we should amend
paragraph (6) of Article 22 so as to read :
"Manufacture of the substances covered by
Article 4 (6), (c) and (g), ? Chapter 111 of the
present Convention ?
The President :
Translation : This is merely a question of
drafting. Does anyone else wish to speak on
Article 22 ?
M. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
I think there is a small alteration which
might be made in paragraph (h). We speak
about ?such manufacture?? and also "the pro-
duction of other derivatives??. Should not the
word ?production" be altered to "manufac-
ture" ?
The President
Translation : I think M. van Wettum is
quite right.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : In the first place 1 should like
to suggest that in the first paragraph of this
article the word ?prescribed" should be replaced
by the word "indicated". The word ?pres-
cribed" seems to me to be out of place, since
the Board will merely give "indications to
the Governments.
Passing on to paragraph ( b ), I suggest that,
instead of the words "manufacture of the sub-
stances covered by Chapter 111 it might be
better to say "the amount of raw material
used ??. The former wording might cause confu-
sion, so I thought it would be well to mention
the point.
While I am speaking I should also recall the
fact that two days ago the Swiss delegation
proposed to transfer the words "the statistics
referred to shall be communicated..."
from the middle of the article to the end.
You agreed with me on that occasion that
this was a matter of drafting, and the question
was referred to the Drafting Committee. I
notice, however, that the Drafting Committee
has kept it in the same place as before, and
I should like to ask that Committee to give
its reasons for so doing.
The President
Translation : I can reply to M. Dinichert?s
last remark. We discussed this point at length
and the impression of the Drafting Committee
was that, after the discussion in the plenary
meeting, you did not desire to press your amend-
ment. The result of the discussion here was,
1 believe, that you withdrew your proposal.
We were perhaps mistaken, but we thought
we were acting according to your wishes, judg-
ing by what you said in the plenary meeting.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation: lam sorry this misunderstand-
ing has arisen. I said that at the second
reading 1 would not revert to the question of
the advisability of the statistics, but 1 did not
withdraw my proposal.
In fact, I understood M. Sugimura to say
that he would support it before the Drafting
Committee, and I therefore felt quite satisfied.
Translation : I will ask Sir Malcolm Delevingne
to reply to the Swiss delegate?s two questions.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
As regards the first of the two points raised
by the Swiss delegate, the reason why the
Drafting Committee allowed the text to stand
as it was in the first draft was this : These
words in paragraph {b) were added to give
satisfaction to a wish expressed by the United
States delegation that the statistics to be
furnished by the Governments should show the
quantity of the manufactured drugs which were
used for transformation into other derivatives.
The best case to cite as an example is the use
of morphine for transformation into codeine.
Codeine is not one of the drugs covered by
the Convention, and the statistics which we
asked for in Article 22 do not therefore include,
as a matter of course, the amount of codeine
manufactured and used. But it was thought
desirable by the United States and also by
other delegations that the statistics should
show the amount of morphine which was used
for transformation into codeine, because in
that way the Central Board would get a more
complete picture of the use of the substances to
which this Convention applies. That is the
reason why we used the word "substances ,
which refers to the manufactured drugs and
not to the raw material from which the manu-
factured drugs are in the first instance made.
The quantity of raw material used in the first
instance in the production of morphine which
is afterwards transformed into codeine would,
of course, be included in the general statistics
of the raw material used, and in any case it will
always be possible to obtain, by a simple cal-
culation, the average amount of raw opium
which is required for the final production of
codeine. I hope that this explanation will satisfy
the Swiss delegate.
As regards the second point, I think I have
nothing to add to what the President has said.
I was certainly under the impression that the
Swiss delegate, at the close of the discussion
the other day, gave us to understand that he
did not intend to press the point, but he made a
formal reservation that, in case these statistics
were found to be used for purposes other than
those for which they were furnished by the
Governments, his Government would hold itself
free to discontinue furnishing them to the
Central Board. In these circumstances, the
Drafting Committee thought it unnecessary
to make any change, because in the position
in which the sentence is, its effect appeared to
the Drafting Committee to be perfectly clear.
As regards the position of M. Sugimura, of
course, I am not in a position to say anything,
and I should prefer to leave to M. Sugimura
himself the task of explaining it.
The President
Translation : M. Dinichert, delegate of
Switzerland, will address the Conference.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland) :
Translation : 1 do not want to abuse M.
Sugimura?s courtesy and cause him to enter into
a discussion which at this stage cannot have
any great interest.
Moreover, from what has been said, I gather
that, if the amendment had been submitted to
The President :


Translation : I apologise for reverting to
the wording of this article, but my attention is
drawn to the words ? le Comite central
the Drafting Committee, the situation would
still be the same and the Drafting Committee
would have decided to keep the text as it is.
I notice therefore two points :
1. The statistics which it is intended to
ask the Governments to supply will contain
information which in the opinion of those
who give it cannot even be communicated
confidentially to the Governments.
2. As the Governments will be ignorant of
these statistics, which constitute the basis
the pivot, as another speaker put it of the
Central Board?s activities, they will be unable
to follow and appreciate the Board?s work at
its full value.
In view of these two considerations, I must
reserve the Swiss Government?s right to examine
the whole question again with a view to con-
sidering whether it can sign the Convention
without making a reservation on the question.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
May I say one word ? The Drafting Com-
mittee, of course, had no right to make any alte-
ration of substance in the text of the Conven-
tion. Its functions are limited to putting into
proper form the decisions of the Conference.
As the Conference took no decision on the
amendment of M. Dinichert the other day, and
as the Drafting Committee understood that the
amendment was withdrawn, it only remained
for it to consider the best form in which the
article should be cast. If, of course, the Confe-
rence had taken a decision, it would have been
the business of the Drafting Committee to
give effect to it. I do not think, therefore, that
the impression should be given that the Draft-
ing Committee itself had any view on the
question of substance at all. Its work was
limited to the question of form.
With regard to the last part of M. Dinichert?s
remarks, 1 think there must be some little
misunderstanding. The statistics which are
not covered by the sentence under considera-
tion are the quarterly statistics of imports and
exports. Sub-Committee A, when it drew
up the scheme, thought that it was not desi-
rable that those statistics should be imme-
diately communicated to the Governments, for
the simple reason that the statistics, if they
became public, might give information as to
the course of trade in a particular country,
the markets which a particular country was
engaged in developing, or in which it was
selling its goods, information which might be
useful to the competitors of the merchants in
that country. For this reason, Sub-Committee
A thought it better not to include the quarterly
statistics of imports and exports in this sentence.
If such information were to be made public
at once, and to act to the prejudice of the traders
in any particular country, such a result would
naturally go a long way towards destroying
the general confidence in the work and powers
of the Board. The information will appear
later on in the annual report which the Board
makes after the close of the calendar year ;
and, as I explained the other day to M. Dinichert,
it will also be necessary, of course, in the event
of the Board having to make a recommen-
dation under Article 26 with regard to a par-
ticular country, to give the information on
which it bases its decision.
I understand that, in his view, full information
will be necessary in order to enable the Govern-
ments to decide whether they will accept the
recommendation of the Board or not. I am
entirely in agreement with him. Such infor-
mation must be given, but that is not incon-
sistent, I think, with the text of the article
as the Drafting Committee has left it in the
draft Convention before you.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I thank Sir Malcolm Dele-
vingne for his explanation, which will be of
great interest to my Government. Moreover,
I do not think we need continue this discussion
now.
The President
Translation : In compliance with M. Dini-
chert?s proposal, we might replace the word
?prescribed? by ?indicated? in Article 22,
and the word ?production? by ?manufacture?
in the third line of sub-paragraph ( b ) of the
same article. {Agreed.)
Article 22, as amended, was adopted
Article 23.
The text of Article 23 was read as follows :
?In order to complete the information of
the Board as to the disposal of the world?s
supply of raw opium, the Governments
of the countries where the use of prepared
opium is temporarily authorised shall, in
a manner to be prescribed by the Board, in
addition to the statistics provided for in
Article 22, forward annually to the Board,
within three months after the end of the
year, as complete and accurate statistics
as possible relative to the preceding year,
showing :
?(1) The manufacture of prepared
opium, and the raw material used for
such manufacture ;
?(2) The consumption of prepared
opium.
?It is understood that it shall not be
within the competence of the Board to
question or to express any opinion upon
these statistics, and that the provisions of
Article 24 are not applicable to the matters
dealt with in this article, except in cases
where the Board may find that illicit
international transactions are taking place
on an appreciable scale.?
The President :
n?aura aucun pouvoir d?ouvrir une discussion?.
The English text says "... it will not be within
the competence of the Board to question or. . .?
These two texts do not quite coincide. I think
the P'rench text ought to be brought into line
with the English, which meets the views of the
Conference better. [Agreed.)
Article 23, subject to the above modification,
was adopted.


says ? . . . appeler 1?attention du Comite sur toute
question qui leur paraitra necessiter une etude,"
while the English text says ? to draw
The text of Article 24 was read as follows :
?1. The Central Board shall conti-
nuously watch the course of the interna-
tional trade. If the information at its
disposal leads the Board to conclude that
excessive quantities of any substance
covered by the present Convention are
accumulating in any country, the Board
shall have the right to ask, through the
Secretary-General of the League, for expla-
nations from the country in question.
?2. If no explanation is given within
a reasonable time or the explanation is
unsatisfactory, the Central Board shall
have the right to call the attention of the
Governments of all the Contracting Parties
and of the Council of the League of Nations
to the matter, and to recommend that no
further exports of the substances covered
by the present Convention or any of them
shall be made to the country concerned
until the Board reports that it is satisfied
as to the situation in that country in
regard to the said substances. The Board
shall at the same time notify the Govern-
ment of the country concerned of the recom-
mendation made by it.
?3. The country concerned shall be
entitled to bring the matter before the
Council of the League ;
?4. The Government of any exporting-
country which is not prepared to act on
the recommendation of the Central Board
shall also be entitled to bring the matter
before the Council of the League.
?If it does not do so, it shall immediately
inform the Board that it is not prepared to
act on the recommendation, explaining, if
possible, why it is not prepared to do so.
?5. The Central Board shall have the
right to publish a report on the matter and
communicate it to the Council, which
shall thereupon forward it to the Govern-
ments of all the Contracting Parties.
?6. If in any case the decision of the
Central Board is not unanimous, the views
of the minority shall also be stated.
?7. Any country shall be invited to
be represented at a meeting of the Central
Board at which a question directly inte-
resting it is considered.?
The President
Translation : In paragraph 7of this article
the words ?tout pays pourra etre invite?
should read ?tout pays sera invite?, to tally
with the English. [Assent.)
M. Sugimura, delegate of Japan, will address
the Conference.
Ml. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : It seems to me that the words
?risque ainsi de devenir un centre de trafic
illicite? (?that there is a danger of that country
becoming a centre of the illicit traffic?), which
appear in the French text of the first paragraph
of Article 24, have been forgotten in the English
text.
Translation : M. Sugimura is quite right.
The words omitted will be inserted.
Artide 24, as amended, was adopted.
Article 25.
The text of Article 25, was read as follows :
?It shall be the friendly right of any of
the Contracting Parties to draw the atten-
tion of the Board to any matter which
appears to it to require investigation,
provided that this article shall not be
construed as in any way extending the
powers of the Board.?
The President :
Translation: The French text of this article
the attention of the Board to any matter which
appears to it to require investigation? . The
expression to ?require investigation? is stronger
than the expression ?necessiter une etude?.
ML Perrot (France) :
Translation : It is the same thing.
The President
Translation : If the French delegate thinks
it is the same thing, I withdraw my remark.
MI. Perrot (France) ;
Translation : Perhaps, after all, the word
?enquete? would be more correct.
Ml. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
In the English the word is ?investigation?.
M. Bourgois asked the Committee to adopt
the translation ?etude? and the English dele-
gate agreed that the meaning of the English word
?investigation? was the same as that of ?etude?.
MI. Bourgois (France) :
Translation : After further reflection, I
prefer the word ?examen?, which should satisfy
everyone.
Ml. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
I agree.
Artide 25, as amended, ivas adopted.
Artide 26.
The text of Article 26 was read as follows:
?In the case of a country which is not
a party to the present Convention, the
Central Board may take the same measures
as are specified in Article 24, if the infor-
mation at the disposal of the Board leads
it to conclude that there is a danger of the
country becoming a centre of the illicit
traffic ; in that case the Board shall take
the action indicated in the said Article
as regards notification to the country
concerned.
?Paragraphs 3, 4 and 7 of Article 24
shall apply in any such case.?
Artide 26 was adopted.
Artide 26 bis.
MI. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : The other day I had the honour
to make a proposal regarding Article 26 bis,


but I said I would withdraw it if the Chairman
of the Drafting Committee stated at a plenary
meeting of the Conference that it was unne-
cessary.
The President
Translation : I consulted the Legal Section
of the Secretariat, and it assured me that, in
its opinion, this clause was unnecessary. I
accepted this opinion, which, indeed, I already
held, but I have little authority in the matter
and I hope that M. de Palacios will defer to
the judgment of the Legal Section.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : I feel I must rectify what
has just been said. The authority of the
President is not small ; it is very great. On the
other hand, the view expressed by the Pre-
sident and the Legal Section of the Secretariat
is the same as my own and I, therefore, very
readily accept it. My idea in presenting my
proposal was simply to call forth a declaration
such as the one we have just heard a decla-
ration which will be inserted in the record of
this meeting so as to avoid all misunderstand-
ing in the future.
Article 27.
The text of Article 27 was read as follows :
?The Central Board shall present an
annual report on its work to the Council of
the League. This report shall be published
and communicated to all the Contracting
Parties.
?The Central Board shall take all neces-
sary measures to ensure that the estimates,
statistics, information and explanations
which it receives under Articles 21, 22, 23,
24, 25 or 26 of the present Convention shall
not be made public in such a manner as to
facilitate the operations of speculators or
injure the legitimate commerce of any
Contracting Party.?
Article 27 was adopted.
Article 19.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : I should like to know the
position as regards my amendment to the fifth
paragraph of Article 19. I do not think any
definite decision was taken.
The President
Translation : Do you mean the whole
amendment to the fifth paragraph ?
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : Yes. I have already with-
drawn the amendment to the sixth paragraph.
The President
Translation : If you press this amendment,
which has not yet been distributed, we shall
have to take a vote on it. The first part of
it seems to me to improve the wording, and
I personally should like to see it inserted.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : If the Conference decides to
take a vote, can the amendment be distributed
to us first ?
Translation : If this amendment is to
stand, I will have it distributed. In the
meantime I will reserve the point.
It has been suggested that I should read
out this amendment in order to save time. Do
you agree ? [Agreed.)
The following amendment by M. Dinichert
was read :
?In making these appointments, the
electoral body shall see that the vacant
seats are equitably distributed among
persons possessing a thorough knowledge
of the drug situation and connected on the
one hand with producing and manufac-
turing countries and on the other with
consuming countries.?
M. Faicioni (Italy) :
Translation : If possible, I should like to
know the view which the Rapporteur of the
Committee takes with regard to this amendment.
The President
Translation : Will Sir Malcolm Delevingne
reply to the Italian delegate ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
Mr. President I think that the Swiss amend-
ment does change the substance of the para-
graph. M. Dinichert informs me that he has
no desire to make any alteration whatever in
the substance of the paragraph and only
wishes to improve the French version of the
article. In that case, it ought not to be diffi-
cult to come to an agreement on the matter
and I am willing to do anything to facilitate
that. I do desire most strongly, however,
to maintain the text in the exact sense in which
it was proposed by the Italian delegate, which,
as I said just now, seemed to us to strike a fair
balance between opposing views ; provided
that the exact sense of the Italian proposal is
maintained, I have nothing to say in regard to
the French text.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : This is a very important
article. In order to avoid a third reading, and
to obviate all possibility of a misunderstanding,
1 propose that the final text be drawn up
immediately, and that the Conference adjourn
for a quarter of an hour for this purpose.
(The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m. and resumed
at 5.25 p.m.)
111. FINAL READING OF THE DRAFT
FINAL ACT: CONTINUATION OF THE
DISCUSSION.
The President
Translation : We reserved the last part of
the Final Act on account of the Spanish dele-
gation?s proposals.
The discussion is open on the first of these
two proposals, which reads as follows :
?The Conference recommends that the
Contracting Parties shall not avail them-
selves of the right accorded under Article 9
of the new Convention, unless special cir-
cumstances, of which they shall be free


to judge, render it necessary, and that any
action shall be confined to a strict mini-
mum.
M. de Palacios, delegate of Spain, will address
the Conference.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain) ;
Translation : You will remember that there
was a long discussion on Article 9 of the draft
Convention and opinion was so di\ ided that
this article was only approved by thirteen votes
to eleven. The Conference was thus by no
means unanimous. The Spanish delegation
voted against the article, and M. Betances
proposed that it should be deleted altogether.
As we considered that the principal aim of
the new Convention was to strengthen the
Hague Convention of 1912, in which no authori-
sation similar to that contained in Article 9
was granted, we took the view that this article
would mean a retrogression. Indeed, its effect
is to authorise chemists to supply drugs which
previously they had been forbidden to supply
without a medical prescription.
We are ready to abide by the vote of the
Conference, but we consider that, in order to
achieve our purpose, which is to strengthen the
Hague Convention, we ought to recommend the
Contracting Powers not to avail themselves of
the right accorded under Article 9, unless special
circumstances, of which they shall be free to
judge, render it necessary.
1 hope that all the delegations will be able
to accept this proposal ; it does not affect
what was decided regarding Article 9, and it
is intended to give effect to that desire which
we all feel to strengthen the Hague Conven-
tion.
The President
Translation : M. de Myttenaere, delegate
of Belgium, will address the Conference.
IVI. de Myttenaere (Belgium)
Translation : I should like to ask M. de
Palacios not to press his proposal.
The article has been so worded as to avoid
imposing obligations on any Government. More-
over, the Spanish delegate has already said
that his Government will not avail itself of
the right accorded to it.
It seems a somewhat hazardous and indeed
illogical course for the Conference to authorise
the Powers to do something and then to ask
them not to make use of that authorisation.
If we give an authorisation, we must leave all
parties free to avail themselves of it, but we
cannot say, ?We will allow you to do this if
you like, but please do not do it?.
M. Pinto-Escalier (Bolivia)
Translation : The Bolivian delegation, which
voted against Article 9, fully agrees with the
recommendation proposed by the Spanish dele-
gation.
M. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : For the same reasons as
that given by the Belgian delegate, I cannot
support the Spanish delegation?s proposal,
especially as its wording fundamentally changes
the meaning of Article 9, which only referred
to ?urgent cases?. For these reasons, I cannot
support the Spanish proposal.
IVI. Sugimura (japan) ;
Translation : On the question of principle,
I agree with M. de Palacios, and the regulations
in force in my country are as strict as those in
Spain. But I think that what it meant has
been made quite clear by the debate, and I
beg the Spanish delegate not to press his
amendment.
The President
Translation : I put the Spanish proposal to
the vote.
[The Spanish proposal was rejected, three
delegations only voting in favour.)
The President
Translation : We pass now to the second
recommendation proposed by the Spanish dele-
gation. It reads as follows :
?The Conference recommends that the
Council of the League of Nations shall
invite the Health Committee to consider
immediately whether it would be expedient
to consult the Office international d Hy-
giene publique regarding the products
mentioned in Articles 8 and 10, in order
that, if so, a decision concerning prepa-
rations which cannot give rise to the drug
habit and a recommendation concerning
all other drugs which might come under
the provisions of the Convention may be
notified immediately upon the entry into
force of the said Convention.?
M. de Palacios, delegate of Spain, will address
the Conference.
IVI. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : As you know, Article 4 of
the draft Convention specifies the substances
to which Chapter 111 is to apply, while Articles
8 and 10 indicate how certain preparations will
be exempted from the provisions of the Con-
vention and how recommendations will be
made to the Contracting Parties to apply the
Convention to narcotics which are not yet
included in it and which might prove to be
liable to abuse.
This procedure must of necessity be somewhat
slow. I consider that we should not await the
coming into force of the Convention to set the
machinery for this purpose in motion. Theie
is no reason why we should not request the
Council to recommend the Health Committee
of the League of Nations to consider immediately
the possibility of consulting the Office inter-
national d?Hygiene publique regarding the
products mentioned in Articles 8 and 10, in
order to prepare, if necessary, lists of such pro-
ducts which could be notified to the Conti acting
Parties at the time when the Convention will
come into force.
The President
Translation : I put the Spanish proposal
to the vote.
{The Spanish proposal was adopted by 10
votes to 1.)
The President
Translation : The text which has just been
adopted will be inserted as Resolution VI in
the Final Act.


The British proposal regarding the expenses
of the Central Board will also be inserted in the
Final Act as Resolution VII.
M. Sugimura (Japan)
Translation : I should like to draw atten-
tion to a small point in the wording of the Bri-
tish recommendation. I propose that we should
say ?the Conference asks that the Council?
instead of ?the Conference recommends that
the Council?.
IVi. Perrot (France)
Translation : There are one or two points
in the French text which might be worded
differently. 1 will send my suggestions to
the Drafting Committee.
Subject to final revision by the Drafting Com-
mittee the Final Act was adopted.
112. DECLARATION BY THE PERSIAN
DELEGATION TO BE INSERTED IN
THE FINAL ACT.
The President
Translation : As you will remember, the
Persian delegation intends to make a declaration
at the time of signing. This declaration reads
as follows ;
?The Persian Delegate, acting on instruc-
tions from his Government, declares that
he signs the Convention ad referendum and
subject to the League of Nations acceding
to Persia?s request as set forth in its
memorandum.?
The declaration was noted.
113. DECLARATION BY THE SIAMESE
DELEGATION TO BE INSERTED IN
THE FINAL ACT.
The President
Translation : We also have a declaration by
the Siamese delegation, which reads as follows :
?In signing the Convention and the
Final Act, I wish to declare that, having
no instructions on the subject of Indian
hemp, which was not originally on the
agenda of the Conference, I am obliged
to make reservation of Chapter 111 in
regard to galenical preparations of Indian
hemp and of Chapters IV and V, solely in
regard to Indian hemp.?
The declaration was noted.
114. FINAL READING OF THE DRAFT
CONVENTION: CONTINUATION OF THE
DISCUSSION.
Article 19.
The President
Translation : We have now to examine the
wording proposed by the French delegation
for the French text of Article 19 {no change in
English text). The amendment reads as follows:
?En procedant a ces nominations, on
prendra en consideration I?importance qu?il
y a a faire figurer dans le Comite central,
en proportion equitable, des personnes ayant
une connaissance de la question des stu-
pefiants, dans les pays producteurs et
manufacturiers d?une part, et dans les pays
consommateurs, d?autre part, et apparte-
nant a ces pays
1 presume that the Conference is willing to
accept this text ? {Adopted.)
Chapter V.
Article 12.
The text of Article 12 was read as follows :
?Each Contracting Party shall require
a separate import authorisation to be
obtained for each importation of any of
the substances to which the present Con-
vention applies. Such authorisation shall
state the quantity to be imported, the
name and address of the importer and the
name and address of the exporter.
?The import authorisation shall specify
the period within which the importation
must be effected and may allow the impor-
tation in more than one consignment.?
Article 12 was adopted.
Article 13
The text of Article 13 was read as follows :
?1. Each Contracting Party shall require
a separate export authorisation to be
obtained for each exportation of any of the
substances to which the present Convention
applies. Such authorisation shall state
the quantity to be exported, the name
and address of the exporter and the name
and address of the importer.
?2. The Contracting Party, before issuing-
such export authorisation, shall require an
import certificate, issued by the Govern-
ment of the importing country and cer-
tifying that the importation is approved,
to be produced by the person or establish-
ment applying for the export authori-
sation.
?Each Contracting Party agrees to adopt,
so far as possible, the form of import cer-
tificate annexed to the present Convention.
?3. The export authorisation shall spe-
cify the period within which the exportation
must be effected, and shall state the number
and date of the import certificate and the
authority by whom it has been issued.
?4. A copy of the export authorisation
shall accompany the consignment, and the
Government issuing the export authori-
sation shall send a copy to the Government
of the importing country.
?5. The Government of the importing
country, when the importation has been
effected, or when the period fixed for the
importation has expired, shall return the
export authorisation, with an endorsement
to that effect, to the Government of the
exporting country. The endorsement shall
specify the amount actually imported.
?6. If a less quantity than that specified
in the export authorisation is actually
exported, the quantity actually exported
shall be noted by the competent authorities
on the export authorisation and on any
official copy thereof.
?7. In the case of an application to export
a consignment to any country for the
purpose of being placed in a bonded
warehouse in that country, a special cer-
tificate from the Government of that


country, certifying that it has approved the
introduction of the consignment for the
said purpose, may be accepted by the
Government of the exporting country in
place of the import certificate provided for
above. In such a case, the export autho-
risation shall specify that the consignment
is exported for the purpose of being placed
in a bonded warehouse.?
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : In conformity with a proposal
put forward by myself and adopted by the
Conference, this article says that the authorisa-
tion shall state the number of the import
certificate. But, as far as I can see, the model
form does not provide any space for this number.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
1 agree.
The President
Translation : Where ought this number to
be put on the document in question ?
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : In the left-hand corner.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
In the last paragraph the English text is
not quite in conformity with the French text.
In the French text it is "I?autorite competente?
and in the English text it is "Government?.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
Throughout these provisions we have re-
ferred to the Government. I suggest that the
same phrase should be used in the French text.
The President
Translation : Very well; we will put "gou-
vernement? for "autorite competente? in section
7 of the French text.
Article 13, as amended, was adopted.
Article 14.
The text of Article 14 was read as follows :
?For the purpose of ensuring the full
application and enforcement of the provi-
sions of the present Convention in free
ports and free zones, the Contracting
Parties undertake to apply in free ports
and free zones situated within their terri-
tories the same laws and regulations, and
to exercise therein the same supervision
and control, in respect of the substances
covered by the said Convention, as in
other parts of their territories.
"This article does not, however, pre-
vent any Contracting Party from applying,
in respect of the said substances, more
drastic provisions in its free ports and free
zones than in other parts of its territories.?
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : Some doubt has arisen in
regard to the third line of Article 14. It has
been asked whether this passage referred parti-
cularly to the import certificate, especially as
in Article 16 mention is made of bonded ware-
houses. I think it would be as well to make it
clear that this passage in Article 14 applies
to import certificates. I should like this point
to be mentioned in the record of the meeting.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
The intention of Article 14 was that the whole
system of export licences and import licences
and import certificates and, in fact, the whole
regime was to be applied to consignments of
these substances brought into or taken out of
the free ports or free zones.
Article 14 was adopted.
Article 15
The text of Article 15 was read as follows :
?1. No consignment of any of the sub-
stances covered by the present Convention
which is exported from one country to
another country shall be permitted to pass
through a third country, whether or not it is
removed from the ship or conveyance in
which it is being conveyed, unless the copy of
the export authorisation (or the diversion
certificate, if such a certificate has been
issued in pursuance of the following para-
graph) which accompanies the consignment
is produced to the competent authorities
of that country.
?2. The competent authorities of any
country through which a consignment of
any of the substances covered by the pre-
sent Convention is permitted to pass shall
take all due measures to prevent the diver-
sion of the consignment to a destination
other than that named in the copy of the
export authorisation (or the diversion cer-
tificate) which accompanies it, unless the
Government of that country has authorised
that diversion by means of a special diver-
sion certificate. A diversion certificate
shall only be issued after the receipt of
an import certificate, in accordance with
Article 13, from the Government of the
country to which it is proposed to divert
the consignment, and shall contain the
same particulars as are required by Article
13 to be stated in an export authorisation,
together with the name of the country from
which the consignment was originally ex-
ported. All the provisions of Article 13
which are applicable to an export authori-
sation shall be applicable equally to the
diversion certificate.
?Further, the Government of the country
authorising the diversion of the consign-
ment shall detain the copy of the original
export authorisation (or diversion cer-
tificate) which accompanied the consign-
ment on arrival in its territory, and shall
return it to the Government which issued
it, at the same time notifying the name of
the country to which the diversion has
been authorised.
"3. In cases where the transport is
being effected by air, the preceding pro-
visions of this article shall not be applicable
if the aircraft passes over the territory of
the third country without landing. If the
aircraft lands in the territory of the said
country, the said provisions shall be applied
so far as the circumstances permit.
"4. Paragraphs 1 to 3 of this article
are without prejudice to the provisions of
any international agreement which limits
the control which may be exercised by
any of the Contracting Parties over the


substances to which the present Convention
applies when in direct transit.
?5. The provisions of this article shall
not apply to transport of the substances by
post.?
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : At the beginning of Article 15
we have tne words ?remove from the ship
or conveyance? (?vehicule?). In some countries
these ?conveyances? are animals camels,
donkeys, etc. Would it not therefore be better
to say ?or other means of transport? ?
M. Perrot (France) :
Translation : I hasten to reassure my
Egyptian colleague : the word in French would
include camels, donkeys, or anything which
carries goods.
Article 15 was adopted without modification.
Articles 16, 17 and 18.
The text of Articles 16, 17 and 18 was read
as follows :
Article 16.
?A consignment of any of the substances
covered by the present Convention which
is landed in the territory of any Contracting
Party and placed in a bonded warehouse
shall not be withdrawn from the bonded
warehouse unless an import certificate,
issued by the Government of the country
of destination and certifying that the impor-
tation is approved, is produced to the autho-
rities having jurisdiction over the bonded
warehouse. A special authorisation shall be
issued by the said authorities in respect of
each consignment so withdrawn and shall
take the place of the export authorisation
for the purpose of Articles 13, 14 and 15
above.
Article 17.
?No consignment of the substances
covered by the present Convention while
passing in transit through the territories
of any Contracting Party or whilst being
stored there in a bonded warehouse may
be subjected to any process which would
alter the nature of the substances in question
or, without the permission of the competent
authorities, the packing.
Article 18.
?If any Contracting Party finds it impos-
sible to apply any provision of this chapter
to trade with another country by reason of
the fact that such country is not a party
to the present Convention, such Contracting
Party will only be bound to apply the pro-
visions of this chapter so far as the cir-
cumstances permit.?
Articles 16, 17 and 18 were adopted.
Chapter IV. Indian Hemp.
Article 11.
The text of Article 11 was read as follows :
?1. In addition to the provisions of
Chapter V of the present Convention, which
shall apply to Indian hemp and the resin
prepared from it, the Contracting Parties
undertake :
?(a) To prohibit the export of the
resin prepared from Indian hemp to
countries which have prohibited its use,
and, in cases where export is permitted,
to require the production of a special
import certificate issued by the import-
ing country stating that the import?tion
is approved for the purposes specified
in the certificate and that the resin will
not be re-exported ;
?( b ) Before issuing an export autho-
risation under Article 13 of the present
Convention, in respect of Indian hemp,
to require the production of a special
import certificate issued by the Govern-
ment of the importing country and stating
that the importation is approved and is
required exclusively for medical or scien-
tific purposes.
?2. The Contracting Parties shall exer-
cise such effective control as to prevent the
illicit international traffic in Indian hemp
and especially in the resin.?
M. El Guindy (Egypt) :
Translation : In agreement with Professor
Perrot and several other of my colleagues, I
propose that in paragraph (a), which says
that the exportation of the resin prepared from
Indian hemp will be prohibited, we should
specifically state that this passage refers to
hashish, etc.
M, Perrot (France) :
Translation : I agree. The exact wording
should be :
? of the resin obtained from Indian
hemp and the ordinary preparations known
under various names, such as hashish,
esrar, chira, diamba, etc.?
The President
Translation : Has anyone any observations
to make on this amendment ?
Mr. Walton (India)
It refers to the preparations from resin ; so,
perhaps, to make that clear, the words ?pre-
parations from the resin? should be substituted.
IVI. Perrot (France) :
Translation : These are the chief prepara-
tions. The resin is not the only thing to be
considered.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
Does the Indian delegate accept the extension
of paragraph ( a ) to preparations of Indian
hemp ? It would seem to be inconsistent with
paragraph (b). I understood the amendment
of the Egyptian delegate to refer to prepara-
tions of the resin and, if that is so, I understand
that the Indian delegate sees no objection. But,
in order that the Convention may be quite clear,
we must know whether the words ?its usual
preparations? mean preparations of the resin
or preparations of the Indian hemp.
M. Perrot (France) :
Translation : I think we are going back to
a question which has already been decided.
Sub-Committee F was definitely in favour of
prohibiting altogether the export of pure resin.
The Indian delegate having drawm attention
to the special situation of his country, we agreed


to say that resin could be exported in certain
cases. But there are also the preparations of
Indian hemp, the best known being hashish,
which is called ?esrar? in iurkey, ? chira in
Tunis, and so on, and which is made either
from the leaves or from the pure resin ; these
preparations can be brought under the Conven-
tion without raising any serious objections on
the part of the Indian delegate, as the present
uses to which these substances are put can be
made subject to certain reservations. I therefore
think that Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s apprehen-
sions are groundless.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
I am afraid M. Perrot has not quite understood
what I said. We have to be quite clear what
we are dealing with in this paragraph. On the
recommendation of Sub-Committee F, we have
dealt with Indian hemp in three ways. We have
included certain preparations of Indian hemp
in Chapter 111, Article 4. We have dealt in
Article 11, paragraph ( a ), with the resin. We
have dealt in paragraph ( h ) of Article 11 with
Indian hemp as defined in the first article of
the Convention. If we insert in paragraph ( a)
of Article 11 a reference to preparations of
Indian hemp, it seems to me we are introducing
a confusion with the other provisions to which
I have referred.
Preparations of Indian hemp would cover the
preparations referred to in Article 4, and the
Governments would be at a loss to know which
provisions apply in certain cases.
I am merely concerned from the point of
view of the clearness of our draft. We must
know exactly what the provisions mean. I
was under the impression that the intention was
to deal in paragraph (a) of Article 11 with
the resin, which is the most dangerous product
we are all agreed about that and to control
its exportation in the strictest possible manner.
I understand that this is also the view of the
French delegation, which, as well as the Indian
delegation, is interested in this matter. If we
add to paragraph (a) ?all preparations of Indian
hemp?, I am not at all clear where we are, and
I would ask for further explanation from the
members of Sub-Committee F who are inter-
ested in the matter.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) ;
Translation : The products referred to before
were derivatives of the resin, while what we
now want is a definition of Indian hemp.
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : This is one of the difficulties
encountered by the Drafting Committee when
dealing with technical points. Sub-Committee
F said ; ?ordinary preparations of which
resin forms the base?. If this expression
had been retained, we should not be discussing
the point now. Why not go back to this
wording ?
We cannot say ?preparations of pure resin?
because the resin is not always pure. But it is
inadmissible that, in a definition of Indian
hemp, we should make no mention of the
preparations derived from it. I therefore
propose the introduction of the words I have
just mentioned.
Mr. Walton (India)
I quite agree with the phrase proposed by
M. Perrot.
The President
Translation : These words will be inserted
in Article 11.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands) :
In the third line of paragraph (a) we should
say ; "the Government of the importing
country? instead of ?the importing country?,
in conformity with the text of the other articles.
In paragraph ( b) in the French text, it should
be ?usages medicaux ou scientifiques? instead
of ?fins medicates ou scientifiques?.
Mr. Walton (India)
In No. 2 of Article 11, in order to make the
English conform with the French, and for the
sake of precision, we should say: ? The Contract-
ing Parties shall exercise an effective control
of such a nature . . .?.
Article n was adopted with the small modi-
fications just proposed.
Chapter 111.
Article 4.
The text of Article 4 was read as follows :
?The provisions of the present chapter
apply to the following substances ;
?{a) Medicinal opium ;
?( b ) Crude cocaine and ecgonine ;
?(c) Morphine, diacetylmorphine, co-
caine and their respective salts ;
?(d) All preparations (officinal and
non-officinal, including the so-
called anti-opium remedies) con-
taining more than 0.2 per cent of
morphine or more than 0.1 per
cent of cocaine ;
(e) All preparations containing dia-
cetylmorphine ;
(/) Galenical preparations (extract
and tincture) of Indian hemp ;
?(g) Any other narcotic drug to which
the present Convention may be
applied in accordance with Ar-
ticle 10.?
The President
Translation : M. Bourgois, delegate of
France, will address the Conference.
M. Bourgois (France) :
Translation : Ido not want to reopen dis-
cussion on a point which has been settled, but
I should like a vote to be taken on the following
amendment : In Article 4, paragraph {e),
after the word ?containing? add the words
?more than one thousandth part of diacetyl-
morphine?. The sentence would then read ;
?all preparations containing more than one-
thousandth part of diacetylmorphine?. I ima-
gine that no medical or scientific arguments
can be adduced against my amendment. In
these infinitesimal doses there can be no ques-
tion of smuggling or drug addiction.


n n. de Myttenaere (Belgium)
Translation : 1 should like to ask M. Bour-
gois to reconsider his proposal. One thousandth
part is o. i per cent. This is going back on our
previous decision and I hope M. Bourgois will
not press this amendment. The actual intention
was to arrange a consultation of the medical
profession on the necessity of using heroin,
and this can only be done if heroin is unob-
tainable without a doctor?s prescription.
I therefore beg M. Bourgois once more not
to press his amendment.
:
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
When this question was discussed at the
first reading, I said that, if a case were made
out in favour of the change, I should accept it,
but, as I was not satisfied, either from the
report of Sub-Committee F or from the debate
which took place in the Conference, that the
change had been justified by any evidence, I
voted against the proposal.
During this second and final reading of the
draft, however, I think we have observed an
unwritten rule not to raise again questions
of real substance, and I think, therefore, M.
Bourgois might consider the question of with-
drawing his proposal. If we raise questions
of substance on one article, questions of sub-
stance may also be raised on other articles.
I think, on the whole, we should accept the
decision taken by the Conference after a full
debate on the first reading, and I do not pro-
pose to support the amendment.
M. Bourgois (France) :
Translation : If I withdraw my proposal
it will not be for the reason given by the Belgian
delegate. He spoke of quantity, but I am
now proposing a quantity ten times smaller
than that which I first proposed.
As regards the point of order raised by Sir
Malcolm Delevingne, I leave that to the Pre-
sident to decide. If he thinks this question
should not be discussed at the second reading,
I will, of course, withdraw my proposal.
The President
Translation : I cannot rule M. Bourgois?
proposal out of order since already in to-day?s
discussion we have at least touched upon ques-
tions of substance and will perhaps have to do
so again.
M. Bourgois (France) ;
Translation : There is perhaps a misun-
derstanding. I am now proposing not 0.1
but 0.01 per cent.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium)
Translation : You said a thousandth part.
That is 0.1 per cent.
M. Bourgois (France)
Translation : I meant to say one ten-
thousandth.
The President
Translation : M. Bourgois has corrected
his proposal.
IVi. Chodzko (Poland)
Translation : If this proposal is accepted,
1 for my part will have to make every reser-
vation as regards signing the Convention.
IVI. Bourgois (France)
Translation : After the explanation I have
given, does Sir Malcolm Delevingne stand by
what he said ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I should like to know the Belgian delegate?s
opinion.
M. Bourgois (France) :
Translation : I meant on the point of order.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne did
not, strictly speaking, raise a point of order.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium)
Translation : I was speaking for the majo-
rity of the Sub-Committee ; it is not a matter
which specially concerns Belgium or myself
personally.
I am strongly in favour of the proposal of
the Sub-Committee because, as I said at the
first reading, it constitutes the first step in the
actual suppression of the consumption of nar-
cotics. I therefore beseech the Conference to
abide by the judgment of the Sub-Committee
and not go back on a decision which I regard
as a very real advance in the matter of the
regulation of the traffic in narcotics.
The President
Translation : Does M. Bourgois maintain
his proposal ?
M. Bourgois (France) ;
Translation : If a vote is in order, I ask for
a vote, but if there is the least doubt on the
point, I will withdraw my proposal.
The President
Translation : I consider that the proposal
is in order. I therefore put to the vote
M. Bourgois? proposal to add, after the word
?containing? in Article 4 ( e ) the words ?more
than one ten-thousandth.
The proposal was rejected.
The President
Translation : M. Ansel mi no, delegate of
Germany, will address the Conference.
M. Anselmino (Germany) :
Translation : The draft Convention goes
further as regards the control of preparations
of Indian hemp than as regards the control of
alkaloid preparations. These preparations, how-
ever, are very rarely used in a pure state in
medicine. Germany is prepared to undertake
not to permit the exportation of the extract and
tincture of Indian hemp, since she is always
ready to promote the general welfare and further
the interests of international hygiene.
The officinal products in question can only
be sold to the public by chemists on production
of a doctor?s prescription, especially when
required for internal use. I do not know
whether Germany will be able to undertake to
apply the same restrictions to the home trade
in these drugs as to narcotics ; I refer to
matters such as trading permits, inspection of


traders* premises, account-books, statistics of
stocks, etc.
Being without instructions from my Govern-
ment, I am obliged to make a reservation as
regards the home trade in the extract and
tincture of Indian hemp in Germany. In an
international Convention, obligations regarding
the home trade should not be imposed beyond
what is required for international purposes.
In short, Germany, sincerely desirous though
she is to co-operate in the control of international
traffic as the Secretary-General of the Con-
ference and the members of the Advisory
Committee are well aware nevertheless
reserves the right to regulate her home trade
in the preparations of Indian hemp in order
to meet her own requirements.
The President
Translation : The German delegate?s state-
ment will be entered in the record of the meeting.
IVI. Perrot (France) :
Translation : There are certain pharmaceu-
tical preparations which can be placed on the
home market, and which there can be no ques-
tion of bringing within the scope of the Conven-
tion. The Convention only applies to two
products which, from the chemical point of view,
are clearly defined, the extract and the tinc-
ture ; but preparations containing the extract
and the tincture do not come under the Con-
vention. To have included them would have
meant injuring unnecessarily the legitimate
interests of chemists.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I am not quite sure whether I understood
M. Perrot aright. What 1 understood him to
say was that Article 4 only applies to extracts
and tinctures and not to preparations contain-
ing extracts and tinctures. Is that so ?
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : Yes, that is what I wanted to
have put in the record of this meeting.
Article 4 was adopted.
Article 5.
The text of Article 5 was read as follows :
?The Contracting Parties shall enact
effective laws or regulations to limit exclu-
sively to medical and scientific purposes
the manufacture, import, sale, distribu-
tion, export and use of the substances to
which this chapter applies. They shall
co-operate with one another to prevent
the use of these substances for any other
purposes.
Article 5 was adopted.
Article 6.
The text of Article 6 was read as follows :
?The Contracting Parties shall control
all persons manufacturing, importing, cell-
ing, distributing or exporting the substances
to which this chapter applies, as well as
the buildings in which these persons carry
on such industry or trade.
?With this object, the Contracting Par-
ties shall :
?(a) Confine the manufacture of the
substances to those establishments and
premises alone which have been licensed
for the purpose, referred to in Article 4
(b), (c) and (g).
?(b) Require that all persons engaged
in the manufacture, import, sale, dis-
tribution, or export of the said substances
shall obtain a licence or permit to engage
in these operations ;
?(c) Require that such persons shall
enter in their books the quantities
manufactured, imports, exports, sales
and all other distribution of the said
substances. This requirement shall not
necessarily apply either to supplies dis-
pensed by medical practitioners or to
sales by duly authorised chemists on
medical prescriptions, provided in each
case that the medical prescriptions are
filed and preserved by the medical prac-
titioner or chemist.?
The President
Translation : M. Perrot, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
M. Perrot (France) :
Translation : I should like to make an
observation on behalf of M. Carriere and on
my own behalf, as I supported his view.
Paragraph (c) does not give entire satisfac-
tion.
The Committee did not want any other
authorised persons to be mentioned besides
medical practitioners ; but I wish to say, and to
have my statement included in the record of
the meeting, that, necessarily, this rule will
not apply to other authorised persons such
as veterinary surgeons or dentists who
are allowed to have quantities of morphine
in their possession for the purposes of their
calling The Committee did not wish to say
?other authorised persons? because the term
seemed too wide, but I desire the declaration
which I have just made to appear in the records
in order to make it clear that the domestic
regulations of each country may allow authori-
sations to be granted to persons other than
medical practitioners.
The President
Translation : The French delegation?s state-
ment will be included in the record of the
meeting.
Article 6 was adopted.
Article 7.
The text of Article 7 was read as follows :
?The Contracting Parties shall take
measures to prohibit, as regards their
internal trade, the delivery to or posses-
sion by any unauthorised persons of the
substances to which this chapter applies.?
The President :
Translation : The Swiss delegation has
submitted an amendment to Article 7. I call
upon M. Dinichert to speak.
M. Dinichert (Switzerland)
Translation : The amendment which I
wish to submit is purely a matter of drafting.
Article 7 as it stands does not read very well
in French. I propose the following wording :
?Les Parties contractantes prendront des
mesures pour prohiber, dans leur commerce
interieur, toute cession a des personnes
non autorisees ou detention par ces


personnes des substances auxquelles s?ap-
plique le present chapitre.?
The present text is, I know, correct in English,
but it is hardly admissible in French.
The President
Translation : The wording proposed by M.
Dinichert does not affect the meaning, and I
suggest that the Conference should adopt it.
Article 7 was adopted with the new wording.
Article 8.
The text of Article 8 was read as follows :
?In the event of the Health Committee
of the League of Nations, after having
submitted the question for advice and re-
port to the Permanent Committee of the
Office international d?Hygiene publique in
Paris, finding that any preparation con-
taining any of the narcotic drugs referred
to in the present chapter cannot give rise
to the drug habit on account of the medi-
caments with which the said drugs are
compounded and which preclude the reco-
very of the said drugs, the Health Com-
mittee shall communicate this finding to
the Council of the League of Nations. The
Council will communicate the finding to the
Contracting Parties, and thereupon the
provisions of the present Convention will
not be applicable to the preparation con-
cerned.?
Article 8 was adopted.
Article 9.
The text of Article 9 was read as follows :
?Notwithstanding the provisions of Ar-
ticles 5 and 6, any Contracting Party may
authorise the supply to the public by
chemists, at their own discretion, as medi-
cines, for immediate use in urgent cases,
of the following opiate officinal prepara-
tions : tincture of opium, Sydenham
laudanum and Dover powder. The maxi-
mum dose, however, which may be sup-
plied in such cases must not contain more
than 25 centigrammes of officinal opium,
and the chemist must enter in his books
the quantities supplied, as provided in
Article 6 (c)?.
The President
Translation : Is not the expression for
immediate use in urgent cases? tautologous ?
We ought to find a better phrase.
M. Perrot (France) :
Translation : It would be sufficient to
say ; ?for urgent cases.?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
I think there is a point here. The intention
was that these preparations should be used for
urgent cases. I think the case cited was that
of persons taken ill in the street who go to a
chemist?s shop and are supplied with medicine
to be consumed on the spot. If you simply say
?for use in urgent cases? that might apply
to supplies of preparations for use elsewhere
at home, for instance. I think the word ?imme-
diate? is important, and I should suggest
therefore that we adhere to the present text.
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : But if I were taken ill in the
street and you went to fetch some laudanum
the chemist would not give you any, since he
is only allowed to deliver it to the patient and
not to the bearer. In my opinion, we
simply say ?medicines for urgent cases .
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
That is all very well, but the words which
M. Perrot suggests give a very wide extension
to this article, and I would have to oppose very
strongly the alteration he proposes. We settled
this text very carefully. The whole case for
this clause was based on the case of a man who
is taken ill in the street and who wants some-
thing immediately. Let us adhere to the
decision which has already been taken and
maintain the present text.
M. de IVlyttenaere (Belgium)
Translation : Let us take a case which
to my knowledge has actually occurred of
a woman having a miscarriage ; the doctor
is sent for and prescribes a small quantity of
laudanum. The husband goes to the chemist
and asks for several drops of this drug. If
he makes the husband take the laudanum
himself it would not help the patient very
much.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
But surely that is a perfectly irrelevant re-
mark. If a doctor has ordered laudanum, he
has given a prescription.
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium) and M. Perrot
(France)
Translation : No.
M. de Palacios (Spain)
Translation : I intended making the same
remark as Sir Malcolm Delevingne
The President
Translation : If this wording raises a ques-
tion of principle, it would be preferable not
to change it.
M. Perrot (France)
I see no objection to it, but the French is
rather redundant.
The President
Translation : I propose that we should
keep to the Drafting Committee?s text. [A greed.)
I venture to ask the opinion of the experts
on the word ?galenique?, in the third line of
Article 9. The expression ?preparations gale-
niques? is translated in English by ?officinal
preparations?, but the expression ?opium offi-
cinal? in the fifth line of the French text is
also rendered in English by ?officinal opium?. Is
there any difference between ?galenique? and
?officinal? ?
M. Perrot (France) ;
Translation: I think I have already pointed
out in the Drafting Committee that the
word ?galenique? means, in all countries
which would use the French text, preparations
made up by chemists. Of course, we could use
the word ?officinal?. Sir Malcolm Delevingne
told us that English was a very rich language
and also possessed the word ?galenical?. The same
word could therefore be used in both texts.


Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I do not feel competent to deal with these
very difficult matters ; but the word officinal
in English means, as I understand, ?in accor-
dance with the national pharmacopeia I
do not know whether the word galenique in
French has the same meaning ; but I take
it that ?officinal preparations? is the right
expression here. Perhaps it is desirable there-
fore to alter the French text to ?preparations
officinales? as in Article 4 {d).
M. Perrot (France) :
Translation ' As far as I am concerned, I
have no objection to putting the word ?officinal?
in the French text. It is already used in
Article 4 (/).
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium) ;
Translation : I propose that the words
?notwithstanding the provisions of Articles 5
and 6? should be deleted, as there is no refe-
rence to these articles.
M. Perrot (France) :
Translation : These words are superfluous,
as Article 9 has no relation to Articles 5 and 6.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
I think that the reference ought to be to
Article 7, which prohibits the delivery to or
possession by any unauthorised persons. An
unauthorised person in the case of the public
is a person not in possession of a medical
prescription. Shall we say notwithstanding
the provisions of this chapter? ?
M. de Myttenaere (Belgium) ;
Translation : Nothing at all should be put
here ; the case is exceptional. On the one hand
you speak of ?any authorised persons? and
on the other you give authorisation, so that
there is a discrepancy.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire)
The words in question are needless, since the
chemists are authorised already.
The President :
Translation : Ihe Conference agrees to
delete the words ?notwithstanding the provi-
sions of Articles 5 and 6? ? {Agreed.)
Article 9, as amended , was adopted.
Article 10.
The text of Article 10 was read as follows :
?In the event of the Health Committee
of the League of Nations, after having sub-
mitted the question for advice and report
to the Permanent Committee of the Office
international d?Hygiene publique in Paris,
finding that any narcotic drug to which the
present Convention does not apply is
liable to similar abuse and productive of
similar ill-effects as the substances covered
by the Convention, the Health Committee
shall inform the Council of the League
accordingly and recommend that the pro-
visions of the present Convention shall
be applied to such drug.
?The Council of the League shall com-
municate the said recommendation to the
Contracting Parties. Any Contracting
Party which is prepared to accept the
recommendation shall notify the Secretary-
General of the League, who will inform the
other Contracting Parties.
?The provisions of the present Conven-
tion shall thereupon apply to the substance
in question as between the Contracting
Parties who have accepted the recommen-
dation referred to above.?
The President
Translation : M. Perrot, delegate of France,
will address the Conference.
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : dhe wording of this article
is still rather laboured and obscure. I have
before me a text drafted by M. Carriere. It
does not change the substance of the article
and is infinitely clearer and more precise. I
will read it.
?In the event of the Health Committee
of the League of Nations, after having
submitted the question for advice and
report to the Permanent Committee of the
Office international d?Hygiene publique
in Paris, finding that any narcotic drug
may, like the substances specified in letters
(a), ( b ), (c), {d), [e] and (/) of Article 4
above, be liable to similar abuse and pro-
ductive of similar ill-effects, the Health
Committee shall inform the Council of
the League accordingly and ask that a
recommendation should be made to the
Contracting Parties for the submission of
the said substance to the regime of the
present Convention. The Council of the
League of Nations shall communicate the
said recommendation to the Contracting
Parties. Each Contracting Party which
accepts the recommendation shall inform
the Secretary-General of the League of
Nations.
?When ten Contracting Parties have
informed the Secretary-General that they
accept the recommendation, the provisions
of the present Convention shall thereupon
apply to the substance in question as
between these Contracting Parties.?
The President
Translation : Does anyone wish to speak
on this amendment ?
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
I should like to see the text, Mr. President.
M. de Palacios (Spain) :
Translation : Could the French text be
read again ? I think something has been left
out in the translation.
{The Trench text was read).
M. Perrot (France) ;
Translation : No change has been made as
regards the substance of the article. It has
only been made clearer.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
I have not had the advantage of seeing the
French text, but certainly I do not think that
it is an improvement on the English text as
it appears in the draft. I should be soiry
therefore if the amendment were accepted.
But there is one point to which the amend-
ment calls attention and on which I think
Dr. Carriere is right and that is in regai d to
the use of the phrase in the draft as it stands


?substances covered by the Convention?. What
we really mean, of course, is the substances
to which this chapter applies. In that respect
Dr. Carriere?s amendment is admittedly an
improvement. I think that the only change
that we need to make is the substitution of
the words ?to which this chapter applies? for
the words ?covered by the Convention?.
I think that if we make that change we shall
give satisfaction on the main points of Dr.
Carriere?s proposal. Ido not think that the rest
of the amendment is important certainly notin
the English text. I suggest that, for the sake
of expedition, we simply make the alteration
I have mentioned.
The President :
Translation : We will then simply amend this
passage to read :?to which this chapter applies?,
(A greed.)
Article 10 as amended was adopted.
Chapter 11.
Article 2.
The text of Article 2 was read as follows ;
?The Contracting Powers undertake to
strengthen the effective laws or regulations
which they have enacted in virtue of Article
I of the Hague Convention of 1912 for the
control of the production, distribution and
exportation of raw opium.?
The President
Translation : M. Kircher, delegate of France
will address the Conference.
IVI. Kircher (France)
Translation : We were very sorry on February
12th not to obtain unanimity on the proposal
which we put forward in the hope of conciliating
all the interests affected and of permitting all
the delegations to sign this Convention without
reservation.
We were much perturbed by the refusal
of several delegations to accept it. During
the last few days we have endeavoured to
improve our formula and to find a text which
would satisfy the whole Conference and enable
us all to sign the Convention. As a result of
the very great assistance given us by Sir Mal-
colm Delevingne, whom I should like to thank,
we have reached an entente cordiale and have
jointly drawn up a new text which defines,
without unduly extending their effect, the
pledges which must be given by all the Powers
present at this Conference.
We ask you to accept this new wording, the
purport of which should be interpreted as
follows : We all stand by our ideal, which
is to put an end as soon as possible to the pro-
duction of illicit opium, but, in view of existing
circumstances, we confine ourselves for the pre-
sent to assuming very definite and limited
obligations to which each country can commit
itself with the sure knowledge that it can carry
them out.
We ask you to accept this formula without
any further discussion, in a spirit of conciliation
and mutual goodwill. [Applause.)
The President
Translation : I take it from your applause
that I can regard the new wording of Article 2
as accepted by the Conference without further
discussion, [Agreed.)
Article 2 was adopted.
Article 3.
The text of Article 3 was read as follows :
?'Due regard being had to the differences
in their commercial conditions, the Con-
tracting Parties shall limit the number of
towns, ports or other localities through
which the export or import of raw opium
or coca leaves shall be permitted.?
Article 3 was adopted.
Chapter I. Definitions.
A rticle 1 .
The text of Article 1 was read as follows :
?The Contracting Parties agree to adopt
the following definitions for the purposes of
the present Convention :
?Raw Opium. ?Raw opium? means
the spontaneously coagulated juice obtained
from the capsules of the Papaver som-
nijerum L., which has only been sub-
mitted to the necessary manipulations for
packing and transport, whatever its con-
tent of morphine.
?Medicinal Opium. ?Medicinal opium?
means raw opium which has undergone the
processes necessary to adapt it for medicinal
use in accordance with the requirements of
the national pharmacopoeia, whether in
powder form or granulated or otherwise
or mixed with neutral materials.
?Morphine. ?Morphine? means the
principal alkaloid of opium having the
chemical formula C l 7 H 19 0 3 N.
" Diacetylmorphine. ?Diacetylmorphine?
means diacetylmorphine (diamorphine, he-
roin) having the formula C 2l H 23 0 S N.
?Coca Leaf. ?Coca leaf? means the
leaf of the Erythroxylon Coca (Lamarck)
and the Erythroxylon novo-granatense (Mor-
ris) Hieronymus and their varieties belong-
ing to the family of Erythroxylaceae and
the leaf of other species of this genus from
which it may be found possible to extract
cocaine either directly or by chemical
transformation.
?Crude Cocaine. ?Crude Cocaine?
means any extract of the coca leaf which
can be used directly or indirectly for the
manufacture of cocaine.
?Cocaine. ?Cocaine? means methyl-
benzoyl lasvo-ecgonine (D. 20� = 160.4 in
20 per cent solution of chloroform) of
which the formula is C l 7 H 21 0 4 N.
? Ecgonine. ?Ecgonine? means laevo-
ecgonine (D. 20� = 45�6 in 5 per cent
solution of water) of which the formula is
C9H 15 0 3 NH 2 0 and all the derivatives of
Isevo-ecgonine which might serve indus-
trially for its recovery.
?Indian Hemp. ?lndian hemp? means
the dried flowering or fruiting tops of the
pistillate plant Cannabis sativa L. from
which the resin has not been extracted,
under whatever name they may be desig-
nated in commerce.?


Translation : There are mistakes m the
chemical formulae in Article 1. We asked
the opinion of the organic chemistry laboratory
of Geneva University on this point, and we
propose to abide by their reply, which may
be taken as official.
M. Perrot, delegate of France, will address
the Conference.
M. Perrot (France) ;
Translation : As regards the chemical for-
mulae, to which the President has referred,
we shall be able to revise these carefully in the
final proof. I beg to draw attention to the
following points :
Definition of the coca leaf: the word La-
marck? should not be in brackets, and the
word ?Hieronymus? should not be in italics.
At the end of the same paragraph a word should
be added : ?...from which it may be found
possible to extract or obtain cocaine either
directly, etc.? The word obtain is missing.
Definition of Indian hemp: Sub-Committee
F drew attention to the necessity of using the
terms by which Indian hemp is designated in
commerce. In agreement with the Indian and
Belgian delegates, I propose that we should
add at the end of the paragraph the words :
?bhang, Bombay tops, ganja, guaza, etc.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
I never heard of a more unscientific method
of definition. Surely this is unworthy of the
Conference ? These are scientific definitions.
Why introduce in a scientific definition a
number of commercial terms which add nothing
to the value of the definition ?
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : As Rapporteur, I venture to
press my proposal, as in the case of Indian hemp
we are not dealing with a well-defined sub-
stance : in commerce Indian hemp appears
under various names. 1 hus bhang is not
the same thing, from the scientific point of
view, as ?ganja? or ?guaza , but they aie all
forms of Indian hemp.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) .
Of course it is not the same thing. I suggest,
however, that M. Perrot might be quite satis-
fied with the mention of these substances in
the record of the meeting.
M. Perrot (France) :
Translation : I should like to know the
opinion of Mr. Walton, the Indian delegate.
Mr. Walton (India)
1 have no objection to their being mentioned
in the record of the meeting.
M. El Guindy (Egypt) ;
Translation : 1 do not see any reason to
omit these words.
Translation : Does the Conference wish to
add this rather complicated nomenclature to
the definitions themselves or will it be satisfied
if it is mentioned in the record of the meeting ?
M. Perrot (France)
Translation : As Rapporteur, I consider
that the insertion of this nomenclature in the
record of the meeting will be sufficient.
(Approved.)
Preamble.
The text of the preamble was read as follows ;
?Albania, etc., etc.
?Taking note of the fact that the appli-
cation of the provisions of the Hague
Convention of January 23rd, 1912, by the
Contracting Parties has produced results
of great value, but that the contraband
trade in and abuse of the substances to
which the Convention applies still continue
on a great scale ;
?Convinced that the contraband trade
in and abuse of these substances cannot be
effectually suppressed except by bringing
about a more effective limitation of the
production or manufacture of the substances,
and by exercising a closer control and
supervision of the international trade, than
are provided for in the said Convention ,
?Desirous therefore of taking further
measures to carry out the objects aimed at
by the said Convention and to complete
and strengthen its provisions ;
?Realising that such limitation and con-
trol require the close co-operation of all
the Contracting Parties ;
?Confident that this humanitarian effort
will meet with the unanimous adhesion of
the nations concerned :
?Have decided to conclude a Convention
for this purpose.
?The High Contracting Parties have
accordingly appointed as theii I lenipo-
tentiaries :
[ Here follow the names of heads of States
and their Plenipotentiaries ],
Who, after communicating their full powers
found in good and due form, have agreed
as follows :

The President
Translation : I declare the drafts of the
Protocol, of the Convention and of the r mol
Act drawn up by our Conference adopted, with
the various drafting amendments that have
been introduced.

THIRTY-EIGHTH MEETING
Held at Geneva on Thursday, February 19 th, 1925, at 11 a.m.
CONTENTS;
115. Signature of the Convention by the
British Delegate : Declaration by
Sir Malcolm Delevingne.
116. Close of the Session : Speech by
M. Zahle, President of the Second
Opium Conference.
President : M. Herluf Zahle.
115. SIGNATURE OF THE CONVENTION BY
THE BRITISH DELEGATE : DECLA-
RATION BY SIR IV! ALCOLIYI DELE-
VINGNE.
The President
Translation : Sir Malcolm Delevingne, dele-
gate of the British Empire, will address the
Conference.
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) :
Mr. President, I have to make the declara-
tion which is usually made by the representa-
tive of Great Britain on occasions of this kind.
As the Conference is aware, the self-govern-
ing Dominions of the British Empire which
are Members of the League sign a Convention
of this kind independently. I have therefore
to make the following declaration at the
moment of signing the Convention ; that my
signature does not bind those parts of the Bri-
tish Empire which are separate Members of
the League of Nations.
This declaration was noted.
116. CLOSE OF THE SESSION.
The President
Translation : Gentlemen, the Second Opium
Conference has now terminated its long work.
This is not the time for the conventional
President?s speech of appreciation and farewell.
The issues in this Conference have run too deep
for mere generalities regarding international
co-operation and good-will. At whatever risk,
I must attempt to approximate a picture of
what has happened here. I shall therefore
speak as frankly and as unconventionally as
some of the delegates have already spoken.
First, however, I must pause for a moment
to express a personal word of gratitude to the
Council of the League of Nations, which appoin-
ted me President of this Conference, to the
delegates who have unfailingly supported me
in a task which has been more than arduous,
and to the Secretariat, which has worked day
and night with an unwavering loyalty and cheer.
I may here especially mention Dame Rachel
Crowdy, who has been of inestimable help to
me not only in the immense secretarial work
but also in the vision which she has brought to
the larger issues involved. {Applause.)
May I also say a special word of thanks to
the distinguished international journalists who
have followed our most complex debates with
a patience not less than that shown by the
delegates, and who have performed a service
of unique value in familiarising the public
with the problems which we have faced and
must still face. We know that we can count
on their continued support.
The best that a President can do is to please
everybody, but that, I am sure, is almost
always impossible and a hundred times impos-
sible in a Conference such as the one we have been
through. The worst he can do is to please one
side and displease the other, for that shows
he has been partial. The most he can hope for
is that he has displeased everybody, and in
that hope I imagine I am not completely
disappointed.
The Opium Conference I say unhesita-
tingly has been the most difficult Conference
in the history of the League of Nations. We
have touched on the centuries-old practices
of the East ; we have come hard against
the economic status of several nations ; we
have found ourselves confronted by the most
complicated and baffling details; we have seen
the struggle between the smuggler and the law
enforcer ; and yet we have had to safeguard
legitimate rights and legitimate uses of drugs
when fulfilling their errand of mercy in alleviat-
ing suffering. The drug question is both a
boon and a curse to civilisation ; it contains
much that is good as well as much that is bad ;
but where it is bad it is like a many-headed hydra
rearing its ugly features, despite all precautions,
in most unexpected places.
The Conference opened on November 17th
with 41 States present, including four non-
Members of the League. It sat till December
20th, when the combination of the holidays and
the breach of opinion already manifested made
adjournment desirable in order to give the dele-
gates opportunity to consult their Governments.
The Conference resumed its work on January
19th with three of the delegations reinforced
by new delegates. On February 6th, the
delegation of the United States of America,
and on the following day that of China,
withdrew because of disagreement with the
progress of the Conference. To-day, February
19th, we complete our work, and immediately
the long process of signature, ratification and
execution of the resultant Convention begins.
No League Conference has ever lasted so
long. For nearly 70 days we have been in
session. Thirty-eight times we have met in
plenary conference and over 100 times in ses-
sions of commissions, committees or sub-
committees. The effort and the material labour
expended is well illustrated by the single fact
that over two million sheets of paper have been
roneoed and distributed.
It may well be so. The farther the Conference
has gone into the questions before it the more
difficult have those questions become. Super-
ficially simple as the problem of drugs appears
to the uninitiated, it is, in fact, so many-sided,


involves so many totally unexpected consider- Board of eight permanent and disinterested
- J J r\ t i C ~ 4- ~ oil TV**} clntic_
ations and reaches so deep into the habits of peo-
ples and the practice of Governments as to be
almost hopelessly baffling. The one incontrovert-
ible fact is that there is no simple or single panacea.
Opium is used in widely different ways.
Amongst the 300 million people of India, it
has been eaten for centuries, and, whether the
practice be good or bad, it could only be done
away with by action which would strike at the
root of Indian life. Amongst other Far Eastern
people, especially tne Chinese, it is smoked,
usually as a heavy stimulant, and is as difficult
to abolish as any other human frailty. In the
West, it is manufactured into drugs, some harm-
less, some neutral, some highly dangerous and
capable of being at one moment the curse, and at
the next the blessing, of society.
Production is essential over-production
disastrous. How, then, can the line be drawn ?
This Conference has recognised that opium and
coca, not to mention Indian hemp the
basis of hashish : are usually grown in
countries where the Governments are less
strongly federalised and where control is
difficult ; it has seen that they are so small
in bulk as to make their growth profitable even
where there are no rail-roads to transport them ;
it has had to admit that their production and
sale have long been an established and often
a perfectly justified feature of the economic
system of certain States ; it has learnt that
they are sedulously sought by a small coterie
of people willing to poison their fellows for
profit ; and it has been brought face to face
with the fact that their highly concentrated
value and their small volume make them the joy
of the smuggler and the despair of the law
enforcer.
The Conference has not solved these?problems ;
it has not removed the world?s drug evil. It
makes no claim to complete success. On the
contrary, it frankly recognises that it leaves
behind it questions which will not be solved
for years possibly even decades.
Yet I do unhesitatingly believe that this
Conference has struck a most powerful blow
at the drug evil. The immense publicity
which has resulted from its open in
an international centre has sounded a warning
of the drug evil which will be heard in the far
corners of the world. The facts which have
been brought out here, and the education there
has been both of the delegates and of public
opinion, have put the question in a light never
before possible.
That, I think, is the great cardinal result
of our long deliberations. The drug problem
is now before world opinion and will stay before
world opinion until it is solved. We have
taken certain detailed steps here ; we will
take more to-morrow, and still more the day
after, but the outstanding fact is that we have
started on a road which eventually can lead
only to success.
Apart from publicity, the Conference has
greatly strengthened the Hague Convention
of thirteen years ago. The general principles
enunciated in that document have now been
provided with the mechanism for their reali-
sation. The first step has been taken towards
the constitution of that international control
which will eventually destroy the evil aspects
of the drug traffic.
The keystone of this control is the Central
experts who are to be armed with all the statis-
tics which the Governments can provide as
to the nations? legitimate requirements for
production and manufacture. This Board will,
in effect, be a great fact-finding body, which,
in a few years, should cast its light of publicity
into the darknesses of the drug question and
allow the world to distinguish the good
from the evil. Then, and then only, shall we
have the data essential for an intelligent and
scientific course of action.
That, however, is not all : should statistics
prove that any nation?s territory is being used
for an importation grossly in excess of its
needs and obviously a danger to others, the
Board can recommend the cessation of shipments
to that nation. The mere threat of such
action and the mere danger of an aroused
world opinion should constitute an almost
irresistible weapon which it may be expected
will never have to be used.
Obligations as intricate and complicated as the
drug problem itself have been accepted by the
Signatory Powers to make all this mechanism
effective. Estimates of needs, statistics of
production and of manufacture ; control and
supervision of factories ; extension of the
system of import and export certificates ;
provisions for the control of transhipment and
for free ports ; even for the first time, I
believe provisions as regards transpoitation
by air ; all have been incorporated in this
new treaty in order to prevent any possible
leakages. ' While no one, I think, suffers under
the delusion that the present system is water-
tight, all of us, I am sure, feel that its imperfec-
tions can be overcome by experience, as they
manifest themselves.
If manufacture and transit have been well
cared for, the same success cannot be claimed
for production. The American principle for
a limitation of production to medical and scien-
tific purposes, though accepted as a principle
both by the Advisory Committee on the Iraffic
in Opium and the Assembly, has not been inclu-
ded in the Convention as a contractual obliga-
tion. While, again, no one disputed the right-
ness of this principle, the objections raised by the
producing countries to its immediate acceptance
as a binding obligation made it obvious that
years will be required before the principle will
become effective in fact. Every possible effort
was made, even up to the last day of the Con-
ference, to find a solution, but when no solution
appeared possible, the frankest and the wisest
course seemed to be to strengthen the original
provisions of the Hague Convention.
The difficulties in the way of the immediate
acceptance of this proposal were twofold ; first,
international control has not yet become suffi-
ciently accurate and scientific to justify the world
in attempting to reduce and to apportion pio-
duction amongst the various nations, and,
secondly, the producing nations would find
themselves faced by grave economic and
political difficulties if they attempted brusquely
and without alternative compensation to reduce
a commerce deep-rooted in custom and in
large part, at least, justifiable.
The way, however, has been pointed out.
On the one hand, the producing countries
realiset hat in total they are providing far more
drugs than the world needs ; on the other,
the world realises that the reduction of pro-


duction can take place only on a scientific American delegation contended for immediate
with due reerard to existing action; the other delegations felt that time
programme and with due regard to existing
legitimate interests. Such a sharp clarifi-
cation of the situation is the first essential on
the road to ultimate success. Facts are needed
in order to apportion the reduction, and alter-
native economic activities are essential to
meet its losses.
Similarly, only a limited progress can be
claimed as regards the smoking of opium in
certain Pacific countries. While this question
was the sole item on the agenda of the First
Conference, nevertheless, a joint Committee
of that Conference and this one was created
to hear and to discuss the American proposal
for a total suppression of that practice within
fifteen years. Agreement unfortunately was
not reached, as the countries where the practice
is temporarily permitted under the Hague
Convention felt unable, with the exception of
Japan, to accept the immediate initiation of
that period of suppression, on the ground that
the present heavy smuggling would render such
acceptance illusory. Instead, they strengthened
their measures for the control of the practice
and accepted the principle of total suppression
within a fifteen-year period, provided that that
period should not begin to run until some out-
side international authority, such as the C ouncil
of the League of Nations, ruled that the danger
from smuggling had ceased. This result, how-
ever, was unacceptable to the American dele-
gation, which, very largely for this reason,
withdrew from the Conference. Regrettable
though this withdrawal was, I feel that our
Conference did what was in its power to do to
provide a solution which would go far enough
to convince the American delegation that real
progress was under way and not too far to
appear impracticable to the Powers imme-
diately responsible for the administration of
these territories. r . ..
Such, then, is the broad outline of the results
of our eight ?weeks? effort an unprecedented
publicity, a thorough appreciation of the facts
and the difficulties of these immensely intricate
problems, the creation of a real mechanism
for the day-to-day execution of the Hague
Convention, an understanding of the problem
of the limitation of production which is essential
for final success, and a thorough discussion,
even without final agreement, of the prepared-
opium problem. More and more as we leave
behind us these surcharged, and at times even
hard, moments through which we have passed,
I am sure we will begin to see that, aftei a 1,
the sun is not far from breaking through the
clouds. . ~ ...
One special consideration I would mention .
the most serious and the most unfortunate
incident of the [Conference, namely, the
withdrawal of the delegation of the Unitcc
States of America. Utterly unchallengeable,
believe, is the statement that that delegation,
by its boldness, its directness and its devotion,
had given a supreme impetus to the whole
anti-drug campaign. Important political per-
sonalities had thrice crossed the Atlantic to
help in our discussions, and this last time had
been away from home nearly four months.
No voice was raised and indeed, I believe,
no voice can be raised against the justice
of the principles enunciated by the American
delegation, dhe only question is as to the
moment when they can be icalised. Flic
was required. Without taking a position between
these two viewpoints and with full recognition
of the generosity with which the American
delegation has given us of its time and its acti-
vity, I cannot but express my own regret,
first? that the delegation should have felt it
necessary in any circumstances, to withdraw,
and, secondly, that it felt it necessary to
withdraw before the end of the Conference.
We cherish, however, the statement of its
chief delegate that this immensely intricate
problem of drugs can be solved only by inter-
national co-operation. We have tried since the
withdrawal of the delegation not only to take
no action which might make its renewed co-ope-
ration more difficult but even to carry out, so
far as we understood them, the various view-
points which it had advanced. Despite
our efforts, however, I feel confident the Con-
vention would have been an even better one
if the delegation had remained to the end.
Nevertheless, we look back on America s atten-
dance with gratitude for her energy and regret
for her departure. We have gladly safeguarded
America?s right to co-operate in the choice
of the Central Board and in the general exe-
cution of the Convention, and we venture to hope
that it will not be long before she will as gladly
return to the world-wide movement which we
have launched here.
In closing, let me again reaffirm my convic-
tion that the drug question has entered upon
a new period. It is now caught in the day-to-day
machinery of the League of Nations. It cannot
escape. Where the Hague Conference adjour-
ned without leaving behind it either organisa-
tion or permanent machinery, this present Con-
ference is but the opening step in a movement
which will accelerate from day to day and fiom
month to month. Within a week, the instru-
ment which you sign to-day will be despatched
for the ratification of the parliaments of the
world; within a month, the Council of the
League will have before it a report on the First
Conference ; within the year, many of you
who are delegates to this Conference will be
reviewing these questions in a broad way at
the sixth Assembly of the League of Nations ;
and within a reasonable time we may hope
that the mechanism which we have here pro-
vided will be set in motion to biing into being
the Central Board. From to-day on, then, I
think we can count that the very intiicate and
the very many-sided campaign which we have
outlined during the past eight weeks will follow
on and on through its various successive stages
until this terrible scourge, from which so many
different branches of the human family are
suffering, shall finally have been laid to rest.
Gentlemen, I thank you. [Applause.)
Prince Arfa-ed-Dowleh (Persia)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and
gentlemen, before this long Conference closes,
allow me to express my heartfelt thanks first
to yourself, as President, for the courtesy and
impartiality with which you, have conducted
our debates, to our gracious Secretary, to all
members of the Secretariat and the Distribution
Service for the zeal and enthusiasm which
they have shown in assisting us, and, finally to
my colleagues, who have striven so assiduously,
both in the plenary Conference and in the


Committees, to understand our difficulties and the League of Nations come and see for itself
who have facilitated our task.
It is true that I had hoped to secure an imme-
diate reply to the requests put forward by our
delegation for assistance in enabling Persia
to overcome the evil against which she has
been struggling for many years, but the extent
and diversity of the measures of international
co-operation which we proposed led the Confe-
rence to suggest the despatch of a Commission
of Enquiry which would proceed to the spot
and report to the Council. We earnestly hope
that this enquiry will be carried out and that
it will soon enable us to execute the programme
which we have outlined.
Some of my colleagues appear to wonder why
Persia cannot, by her own efforts, undertake
to replace the cultivation of the poppy by some
other form of cultivation and why she should
ask for a loan of ten million dollars to enable
her to carry out this task.
The reply is very simple. I would recall
that, during the Great War, the belligerent
armies did not respect our neutrality. I will
not in this Assembly indulge in recriminations
against anyone ; I would only remind you
that, during that disastrous war, our most
fertile provinces were transformed into battle-
fields, our harvests destroyed over vast stretches
of territory and two of our finest cities burnt
by the contending armies.
The losses have been estimated by the consuls
of European Powers who inspected the damage
at a figure of no less than four milliard gold
francs.
In reply to all our complaints, we were
repeatedly assured that if we would only wait
until the' end of the war we should get just
compensation for this damage. We are still
waiting. A neutral country, whose sacred territory
had been violated, we sent a diplomatic mission
to Paris immediately after the Armistice to
obtain the rights which we had been promised.
Our delegation returned empty-handed, without
even having been given a hearing by the Peace
Conference.
Alone, faced with the problem of her ravaged
territories and ruined towns, Persia had, unaided,
to reconstruct what others had destroyed
when they carried into her land a war in which
she was not concerned. Now, the great Western
Powers are coming to ask her to collaborate
with them and to assist them in destroying an
evil which is harmful to all and with which
we are well acquainted. Persia does not refuse.
She accuses nobody. On the contrary, she
declares that she is prepared to co-operate.
She has already prohibited the cultivation
of the poppy in certain districts and she has
enacted legislation to restrain and prohibit the
illicit use of opium in the country. She is
prepared strictly to limit the cultivation of the
poppy to what is necessary for medical and
scientific purposes and to replace it by some other
form of cultivation. But she asks that this
co-operation should be mutual, that she should
receive both technical and financial assistance
in applying measures which must deeply
affect her economic life [ ? an economic life
which has already been so seriously injured
by the unjust ravages of war.
I would ask my colleagues to put themselves
in our place for a moment and to realise both
the magnitude of our sufferings and the extent
of the good-will which we have displayed. Let
what we have already accomplished and what
we are prepared to do for the suppression of
opium. lam sure that the day will come when
the League will accede to our requests ; and
when that day comes, Persia will joyfully
withdraw the reservation which I am to-day
compelled to attach to our signature. (Loud
applause.)
IVI. Ferreira (Portugal) :
Translation: Mr. President, ladies and gentle-
men, the Conference which is closing to-day
deserves, I think, to have its history recorded.
Indeed, that history must be written to prevent
a legend springing up about the actual facts
a legend which would make the facts appear
other than they are and give a false impression
of their meaning and their effect.
At the moment probably this Conference
will only be given a record which will perhaps
be halfway between legend and reality. I fear
that the Conference will be in danger of having
to submit to this not altogether satisfactory
treatment. There are reasons for it.
Some days ago a dilettante who attends con-
ferences for his pleasure and sometimes draws up
short summaries of the discussions approached
me and asked for information with regard
to what had happened and more particularly
with regard to what was going to happen.
I could not conceal my astonishment. I
replied to my questioner that, in the middle
of the struggle, it was difficult for me to estimate
its real underlying meaning and effect and that
it would be easier for him during a long meeting
to set down passing impressions obtained from
private conversations, guessed at as a result
of a few words let drop in passages or lobbies,
caught inter pocula at the moment when tongues
are unloosed and speech is freer and less
guarded. I added that the subtlety and wisdom
of a person used to collecting information, even
as an amateur, must command special quali-
fications which would enable him to miss
nothing, even in the midst of opium smoke,
even in the height of the battle, even in the selva
oscura of legal conceptions. My friend yielded,
but not as much as I would have desired. He
did what I asked, but he did not altogether
satisfy my curiosity. He merely gave a list
of headings which he thought would act as
landmarks, as he said, to guide him in his
passage through the Conference.
I do not think, my dear colleagues we
shall not be colleagues, alas! for very much
longer that it is indiscreet for me, failing
anything better, to give you the few headings
that I noted hastily in my discussion with this
gentleman. They are as follows :
?Banks of the Lake of Geneva eternal
spring eternal Conference a record
war between idealists and realists
skirmishes the alphabet comes to the
rescue of the Conference the Persian
memorandum disagreements a threat-
ened ?break-up? armistice resump-
tion of hostilities sulking schemes
for a marriage of convenience giving
up in the middle the meeting continues
the Persian memorandum - the adven-
ture of Tarquin the Proud poppy heads
and human heads chemical formulae
and legal formulae the Battle of Fontenoy


on the banks of the Lake of Geneva :
?Fire first, producers!? ?No ! it is your
turn, consumers.? ?Hell is paved with
good intentions? the flowers of oblivion
the Persian memorandum once more
Good-bye.?
What sort of reply could be made to such
whimsicalities ? I merely told my friend that
his method of treating such a subject by means
of allegories punctuated by an impertinent
refrain struck me as being a trifle strange.
What complaints did he make against the
Conference ? Its long duration ? That very
fact should be taken as a proof of its success.
If there were no obstacles, what merit would
there be ? The squabbling and the threats of
a break-up of which my friend spoke are
difficulties which the Conference overcame
and which only brought out its perseverance
and its conciliatory spirit. One great country
left us during our journey, but that country
handed on to us the torch which it had itself
lit by its idealism. Did we not, during the
later meetings, constantly hear references to the
American scheme, which, by the way, shows that
those who are absent are not always regarded
as being in the wrong. This great country
of America saw, from mid-ocean, the lighthouse
which was to guide it in its voyage but disdained
the small red or green light near the coast which
should not be ignored by one who would avoid
the rocks. The beams of the lighthouse dazzled
the eyes of America, and, sailing by that light
alone, she brought her noble ideal to shipwreck.
In theory, the opium problem is an easy
one to solve. You have only to prohibit the
cultivation of the poppy and the consumption
of opium. On paper, nothing seems simpler.
But the question is: Would such a prohibition
have any real effect ? Any measure which
fails to operate is as though it did not exist,
and the prohibition in question would fall into
this category. America kept her eyes on the
lighthouse and was dazzled by its glare, but
the countries really interested had to regard
America?s dream from the point of view of
those who have to make it a reality.
We have now found a formula for the future,
and if, when we put it into practice, we find
sincerity and a true spirit of collaboration, our
efforts will be successful. I would even go
further. Success would not only crown the
campaign against opium : the League of
Nations would also receive its reward. The
League will, indeed, have given one more proof
of its untiring assiduity in seeking a solution
for the problems, however difficult they may
be, which affect the welfare of human society.
We must remember, too, that during this
Conference the representatives of various coun-
tries have been daily in touch with each other ;
this is of the utmost importance for the future
of peace. The better men know each other the
more difficult it will be for ambitious schemers
to set the world by the ears.
Inspired by such ideas as these, I advised
my amateur, keeping up the fanciful character
of his programme, to replace the heading
?Good-bye? by ?Till we meet again?, and to
add two others : ?The fight continues? and
?Heavenward.?
Portugal, which is bound by the provisions
of the Hague Convention of IQI2, by the Con-
vention adopted by the First Opium Conference,
and by that which we are about to sign, will
steadfastly maintain her position as a prota-
gonist in the campaign against opium and
dangerous drugs. This is the logical conse-
quence of our former policy, and Portugal
will show herself to be a loyal colleague of
all countries whose position is similar to her
own. We are convinced that an effective
and satisfactory result can only be obtained
by joint effort.
Lastly, the delegation of Portugal has the
honour to pay a sincere tribute to His Excellency
M. Zahle for the masterly and skilful manner
in which he has presided over the very difficult
work of this Conference.
I cannot omit mention of the untiring devo-
tion shown by the members of the Secretariat
who have aided us in the performance of our
task, and I desire on this occasion to convey
to them also the warm thanks of the Portuguese
delegation. (Loud applause.)
IVI. El Guindy (Egypt)
Translation: Mr. President, ladies and gentle-
men, as a representative of one of the oldest
and at the same time one of tne youngest of
nations, I venture to address you to-day tne
day on which the Second Opium Conference
is finishing its work. I am sure that I voice
the feelings of all the delegates in this great
gathering when I express to you, Sir, our thanks
and our deep gratitude. We shall not readily
forget the delicacy, tact, impartiality, firmness
and kindness which always shown
when you presided over our discussions. Thanks
to you, many difficulties have been removed.
The task has not been an easy one, but the
result is most satisfactory. Your action as
a mediator between us all has been judicious
and most discreet.
At times the struggle in this Conference has
been a very severe one, but in all cases the
reason was a very sincere desire loyally to
observe the obligations which had been under-
taken. I do not think that anyone has been
wholly satisfied. Nevertheless, we all sincerely
hope that a real step forward has been taken
in the humanitarian policy that we have
adopted.
Years count for little in the life of peoples,
but I am convinced that, if we loyally observe
our undertakings, the coming years will have
a very serious influence on the life of our
countries.
Since you have allowed me to speak on gene-
ral questions, may I, gentlemen, once more
refer to a question in which I am deeply inte-
rested. You will all understand that I refer
to the question of hashish. The Conference
has arrived at certain decisions with regard to
Indian hemp, but the question is not entirely
settled. After us, the Advisory Committee
will deal with it, and the results of the enquiry
into the effects of this evil drug will be known
before the end of this year. I entreat you,
gentlemen, to assist me, as you did in the case
of heroin, by voting a recommendation for
submission to the Council of the League of
Nations, asking that the necessary investi-
gations snomd be undertaken, with a view
to the complete suppression of the use of Indian
hemp as a narcotic, and even as a medicine.
Our stay at Geneva lias been a long one. In
spite of the charm of this beautiful town, many
of us have been a little homesick ; but I


am sure that in the future, when we think of for many weeks but our sittings have often
this Conference, we shall regret this city and
we shall sometimes feel a little sad at having
parted from it so soon.
Gentlemen and colleagues, I thank those of
you who have always loyally supported me
and also those who have sometimes opposed
me. I would also express my gratitude to the
very important delegations which are absent,
namely, those of the United States of America
and China.
I would also thank the Secretary-General
of the Conference, who has always been gracious
and attentive to us all, and all the members
of the Secretariat for the kind and obliging
manner in which they have assisted us under
all circumstances.
Lastly, let me thank the Council of the League
of Nations for having called us together and
for having chosen our President ; they could
have made no better choice. May I, Mr. Pre-
sident, close by hailing you not only as a very
perfect gentleman but also as a man of great
wisdom and a great philosopher. {Applause.)
M. Peltzer (Belgium)
Translation: Mr. President, ladies and gentle-
men, I have certainly not unduly trespassed
on the precious time of this Conference or on
your kind attention.
I desire, however, to rise to-day in order
to pay a tribute, in the name of the Belgian
delegation, to our President, and my old friend,
M. Zahle for the consummate skill with which
he has guided the coach, the ship shall I
say the chariot ? of our Conference.
We have had to cross many a stormy sea,
to weather many a squall, to steer clear of
many a reef and to round many a cape. Our
course has been beset with many anxieties.
But, after all, we have made harbour with our
crew almost complete, and, despite all, with a
well-nigh universal feeling of satisfaction with
the work we have done together.
I ascribe a large part of the credit to our
able captain, who has been firm but courteous
with all and always ready to assert his authority
in a kindly manner, and who, with the iron hand
in a velvet glove, enforced on board his ship
a discipline to which I was always very happy
to bow. I may add that, so far as I was
concerned, I had no difference with the Pre-
sident at any moment during our long meetings.
I venture to think, ladies and gentlemen,
that in speaking in this way I am expressing
the feelings of all. If I am right, I hope
you will signify the same by once more applaud-
ing our President and thereby endorsing the
very sincere words which I have just spoken.
(Loud applause.)
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (British Empire) ;
Mr. President and members of the Conference,
there is no part of our proceedings in whicn
we shall feel greater pleasure than in this final
act of placing on record our appreciation of the
services which have been rendered by the officers
and staff of the Conference. It is an act at
once of justice and of gratitude.
I am afraid that I cannot find adequate words
in which to express what this Conference owes
to our President or what it feels about him.
His task has been one of exceptional difficulty.
On the physical side alone the burden has been
a heavy one. Not only has the Conference lasted
lasted for many hours. The duty which rests
on the President alone of being always in his
place and of following the course of intricate
and, I am afraid, sometimes tiresome discus-
sions has placed a very heavy strain upon him.
But this is the least part of the matter. The
subject before the Conference has been one of
extreme complication. It has presented not a
single problem only but a whole host of pro-
blems, and to anyone coming as a stranger, or
almost a stranger, to the question the difficulty
of following and not only following but
guiding the course of our proceedings must
have been a very heavy one.
More trying still than that was the fact that
acute controversies have arisen in the course
of our deliberations and that on several occa-
sions the position has been it is not too much
to say critical, and we know the anxiety
which the President has felt and the efforts
he has made to find a way out of the difficulties
in which the Conference has found itself.
Now, if I may say so, it seems to me there
are three qualities which our President possesses
in an eminent degree which have enabled him
to bring this Conference to a successful close.
In the' first place, there is his unbounded
patience. I have often marvelled at it and wished
that I possessed it. Then there is his unfailing
courtesy, which has smoothed over so many
trying and difficult moments in our Conference,
but, best of all, there is his great courage. He
has never despaired, even in the most critical
moments.
After one of the greatest military disasters
in all history, the Roman Senate thanked the
defeated general who had collected the remnants
of his troops because he had not despaired of
the Republic. That is the spirit which, if
I may say so, our President has shown. It is
the spirit which wins through to final success.
Our President has always felt that, even in
the most difficult situation, there was bound
to be a way out, and he has set himself to
find it.
If I may venture to say so, those who know
our President in the Assemblies of the League
of Nations expected great things from him, and
he has fulfilled our expectations. That, I
am sure, is the unanimous opinion of this Con-
ference. He has pleased everybody. To use
the metaphor which I think the Belgian dele-
gate has just employed, the good ship Conference
has had'a long voyage; it has encountered
stormy weather ; it has found dangerous rocks
in its path ; but the skill and patience of oui
captain has brought it at the end safely into
harbour. And it has not come in empty .
it has come with a cargo which, if not as rich
as we expected or perhaps hoped for, is yet
a cargo of immense value I venture to use
as strong a word as that to the world.
We thank him for the wise words in which he
has summed up, in his closing speech, the work
of this Conference and the value of the results
which it has reached. lam sure lam expres-
sing the feelings of all my colleagues when I
say that the President will take away with him
the gratitude of this Conference, and not only
will he have the gratitude of this Conference
but, when the history of this Conference is
known, he will have the gratitude of the large
body of persons all over the world who know the
importance of the questions with which this

STEHHrip
which has been displayed is, I think, almost
marvellous. No work has been too heavy,
no hours too late, if they could serve the C on-
ference thereby. ,
Perhaps it is unfair to particularise, but i
have been astonished myself at the wonderful
accuracy of the verbatim reports, at the heroic
endurance of our interpreters, and, not least,
May I express a hope that they win receive
the recognition they deserve. I think the
Conference would be glad if the President would
charge himself with the mission of conveying
to the Secretary-General, and perhaps also to
the Council, the appreciation which the Confe-
rence entertains for the services which have
been rendered by its Secretariat. I am not
sure whether the names of all those who have
served us will appear in the final document,
but at least they will not be forgotten by the
members of this Conference. [Applause.)
M. Sugimura (Japan) :
Translation: The Japanese delegation wishes
to convey the sincere thanks of all the members
of the Conference to the distinguished piota-
gonists of our great work, and particularly to
Sir Malcolm Delevingne, who has displayed
the most untiring energy throughout all these
months, and especially during those difficult
hours when the fate of the Conference hung
in the balance. He has thus played a decisive
part in the success of our debates. I therefore
wish to express my sincerest admiration for his
work. [Applause.)
M. Kircher (France)
Translation : Mr. President, ladies and gentle-
men, I wish to associate myself most heartily
with the thanks which have been addressed to
our respected President and to his lieutenants.
The French delegation feels that it cannot
improve on what the previous speakers have
said in this connection, and will only add that
it carries away with it the best recollections
of this Conference, and of those who, to use the
felicitous expression of the first Belgian dele-
gate, have steered our ship to port through all
the shoals and cyclones which have threatened it.
The eloquent speeches which we have just
heard have dealt with the benefits which the
world will derive from the campaign against
opium, which has brought together in the
hospitable city of Geneva the representatives
of almost every civilised nation. We can
separate with a sense of duty done, without fear
rately shut their eyes to the truth
There is one point, however, to which 1 would
like to draw your attention, if it is not presuming
too much upon the courtesy which you have
always extended to me.
In my opinion, the characteristic of the Geneva
Convention is the spirit of solidarity which
breathes life into every clause and chapter.
While the Hague Convention kept in complete
national collaboration. . '
The measures which the signatories have had
to take during the last thirteen years against
the production, circulation and consumption
of raw opium, prepared opium, morphine and
cocaine were subordinated to the differences
between commercial conditions and to the
special circumstances of the various countries.
Each country continued to be like an island
in the midst of the ocean which its inhabitants,
by their unaided efforts, had to protect against
the invasion of dangerous drugs.
The Geneva Agreements definitely put an
end to this policy of isolation.
We realised that the most determined and
persevering efforts must be vain if international
co-operation did not render durable and perma-
nent the progress separately accomplished by
each Power.
Each page of our Convention, of our Protocols
and of our Final Acts voices this appeal to the
trustful, active and fruitful collaboration of
all the Powers united in the pursuit of one lofty
ideal. ,
International regulations, freely accepted but
binding, will henceforth govern foreign trade ;
international co-operation will henceforward pre-
vent the abuse of toxic substances ; and the
campaign against the common foe the
smuggler, whom I do not hesitate to stigmatise
as the enemy of mankind will be carried on
by the international army of the servants of jus-
tice, who will periodically confer together and
will take all the necessary measures in common.
Thus, gentlemen, under the aegis of the League
of Nations, we form to-day a friendly nay, a
fraternal association of the Powers which
are convinced of the necessity of ceaseless
co-operation and of an unbroken unity of
front and are firmly resolved to walk hand-in-
hand along the stony path of progress until
the goal is reached.
To this solidarity of effort now proclaimed
by the voice of forty nations represented in this
Conference the world will owe its deliverance
from the growing peril which looms in East
? and West. [Applause.)


Mr. Michael Mac White (Irisli Free State) :
1 should like to associate myself with the
remarks that have already been made concerning
the manner in which M. Zahle has directed the
work of this Conference. There were times
when the patience of an ordinary man would
have been exhausted, but fortunately our Pre-
sident has given abundant proof that he pos-
sesses an inexhaustive store of that super-emi-
nently statesmanlike quality. From the outset,
it became apparent that there were two oppo-
sing forces in this Conference : the one defen-
ding humanitarian ideals and the other defen-
ding interests which I do not intend to qualify,
as I do not wish to disturb the harmony of our
last meeting. Notwithstanding the difficulties
of the situation difficulties which are not
apparent to all President Zahle held the
scales of justice evenly balanced. He has, if
I may say so, piloted this ship through the
intricate seas of international diplomacy and
brought it safely to port, just as his Viking
ancestors piloted their barques through the
stormy seas of the north in days gone by.
No one regretted more than the Irish dele-
gation the departure of the United States and
the Chinese delegations. Their spirit, however,
remained to stimulate us in our action, and we
may anticipate that they will come back with
renewed vigour to the next Opium Conference,
for I want to tell you that the fight against
opium and the drug scourge will continue, and
although the results achieved through this
Conference have been less satisfactory than many
of us would desire, they, nevertheless, constitute
an important step in the right direction.
The opium evil is centuries old, and only a
dreamer of dreams could hope that it be cured
in a day or a year or even a decade. It is an
evil which affects directly or indirectly the
lives of populations twice as great as those of
Europe. To say that this Conference has been
a failure because a final solution of that problem
has not been found would not only be an exagge-
ration but a misrepresentation of facts. At the
outset, this Conference was faced with almost
insurmountable difficulties ; some of those dif-
culties we have confronted and overcome,
others have been left for the future to solve.
The difficulties we have surmounted can be
converted by our successors into an instrument
for further conquests in this domain, and our
wish is that they may be able to add still
another landmark on the road of humanitarian
endeavour and elaborate a new charter that
will carry with it a message of peace and happi
ness to the heart of mankind. [Applause.)
M. von Eckardt (Germany)
Translation : Mr. President, gentlemen, on
behalf of the German delegation, I have the
honour to thank the President most heartily
for his distinguished services, and the indefati-
gable Secretariat and all the eminent delegates
here present, together with members of the
United States and Chinese delegations, who,
to our great regret, are no longer with us, for
the spirit of co-operation which they have
displayed and to which we owe the privilege
of having been associated in work of the
greatest value and significance for the pros-
perity and progress of mankind.
We have made it a duty to follow with close
attention all the proposals put before the Confe-
rence, in the hope that they would achieve
our common purpose. If I may be allowed
to do so, I would like to mention here the fact
that an agreement was signed between Germany i
and China at Waichiao on December 31st, |
1924, rendering compulsory the exchange of \
import and export certificates.
Now we?^rTTe^fl^'Gfttie^;^ whose Press has
extended to us a welcome which we have all
appreciated, and we leave the hospitable roof
of the League of Nations with every wish for
the success of the humanitarian aims of the
Second International Opium Conference.
?Quod felix faustum fortunatumque sit."
{Applause.)
Mr. Riddell (Canada) :
Mr. President, members of the Opium Confe-
rence, ladies and gentlemen, as a late-comer
to the Conference, I feel I have not the full
honour of having borne the heat and burden
of the day, but I was not long in the Conference
before I came to appreciate my colleagues
and their sincerity and earnestness in working
for a solution of this problem, nor before I
began to appreciate the excellent work which
has been done by the President in guiding
us through the most difficult seas.
I also wish to join with others in expressing
my deep gratitude to the members of the Secre-
tariat, and also, I would like to add, the Rap-
porteurs of the various Committees, and espe-
cially to Sir Malcolm Delevingne, who always
seemed to be the one who got us out of difficult
situations. I would also like to mention the
names of Viscount Cecil, M. Daladier and Mr.
Porter, men who gave to the second half of
the Conference a great deal of valuable held
and inspiration.
Our difficult task is now finished. While
we may not be able to say that our Convention
is more than the highest common denominator,
I think we are all agreed that it is a stepping-
stone to greater endeavour and achievement.
The suppression of the opium traffic is economi-
cally sound ; I believe that almost all the
nations of the world will find in its suppression
the highest intelligent self-interest.
We have heard of a next Conference, and I
trust there will be a next Conference. I hope
that by that time the world situation will have
so changed and that the public opinion of the
world will have so progressed that the so-
called visions of the dreamers and idealists
may then become the practical politics of our
experts and financial advisers. [Applause.)
Humanity, after all, is on the march for the
overthrow of the opium traffic, and I believe
that humanity will not long be thwarted in
achieving its goal. Mr. President, I thank you.
M. Falcioni (Italy)
Translation : The Italian delegation asso-
ciates itself most warmly with the admiration
which has been so eloquently expressed for our
distinguished President and the able way in
which he has directed our proceedings. As we
have had the honour and the privilege to live
at Geneva in this hospitable country of Swit-
zerland, I would like also to offer my hearty
thanks to the Federal and Cantonal authorities
[Applause) and to express my affection for the
charming city of Geneva, whose sun is in eternal
harmony with the greatness of heart of hei
citizens. [Applause.)


M. Sjostrand (Sweden) ;
Mr. President, I beg to join with all my heart
in the expressions of gratitude which have been
so justly given to you. There have been dark
hours for the Conference, and on some occasions
the situation appeared to be quite hopeless,
but our President never lost his nerve or his
head. In the midst of the turmoil of the battle,
he would be seen standing upright and calm.
He embodies for us the best qualities of his coun-
trymen ; the sweet and moderate temper, the
deep reflection and the prudence. Never was
a President worthier of the gratitude of his
collaborators. He carried the day, and we
all join with him in the pleasure he must feel
to-day at having brought this Conference to a
happy conclusion.
I beg also to express my deep-felt gratitude
to the Secretariat, and especially to Dame Rachel
Crowdy. [Applause.)
The President :
Translation : I will not fail to transmit to
the competent authorities of the League o
Nations the great appreciation you have expressed
for the excellent work done by the various
departments of the Secretariat.
I would also like to thank you for the very
kind words which several delegates have addressed
to The thirty-eighth plenary meeting of the
Second Opium Conference is terminated and 1
declare the Conference closed. ( Loud applause.)
The meeting rose and the Conference
declared closed at 1.5 p-w.

REPORT OF TLIE OPIUM PREPARATORY COMMITTEE
I. The Council of the League of Nations, during its meeting in December 1923, adopted
the following resolution :
?The Council instructs the Secretary-General to communicate with the Chairman of
the Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium with a view to calling an Extraordinary
Meeting of the Advisory Committee on January 28th, 1924, for the purpose of nominating
without delay a Preparatory Committee to be charged with the preparation of a draft
programme for the second or larger Conference to be held in Geneva.
?This Committee will consist of six members, including one representative of the
United States and the two European Assessors.
?Should the Chairman of the Advisory Committee deem it possible to make the
necessary arrangements for nominating the members of the Preparatory Committee by
correspondence without convening the Advisory Committee, the Council authorises him
to do so, provided that no undue delay will be thereby caused.
?A draft arrangement on the traffic in opium should be considered, and, if necessary,
approved by the Advisory Committee before being forwarded either to each interested
Government or to the Conference.?
As a result of this resolution the Preparatory Committee was formed, consisting of the
following members :
M. Bourgois (France), )
Sir Malcolm Delevingne (Great Britain), Nominated by the Advisory Committee.
M. van Wettum (Netherlands), )
Mr. Neville (United States of America), l
M. Brenier Nominated by the Council of the League.
Sir John Jordan. )
At the first session, M. van Wettum was elected Chairman of the Committee. The first
meeting was held in Geneva from March 6th to March 10th. The second meeting was held
in Paris from March 28th to 29th, the third meeting was held in Geneva from April 26th to
April 29th and the fourth meeting was held in Geneva from July 12th to July 16th.
Sir John Jordan was not able to be present at the second, third and fourth meetings ;
M. Brenier was not able to be present at the third meeting and Mr. Neville at the fourth meeting.
All the other members were present at the four meetings.
During its first session,the Preparatory Committee suggested that the Council of the League
of Nations should extend the terms of reference of that body to include also the First Con-
ference. It also passed the following resolution with a view to the Second Conference :
?In order to enable the Committee to accomplish the task entrusted to it by the
Council of preparing draft arrangements for the limitation of the production of morphine,
heroin and cocaine, and of the raw materials to be exported for such manufacture, the
Committee considers%iat it will bU'nCCessary for it to ac! iffcoftStlltation with represen-
tatives of the chief manufacturing and producing countries, and it accordingly suggests
to the Council that the Council should invite the Governments of those countries to nomi-
�y v
nate representatives who should be called upon to collaborate with the Preparatory
Committee, when necessary, in the preparation of the draft arrangement in which they are
individually concerned. The chief manufacturing and producing States not represented
on the Preparatory Committee are as follows :
1. Morphine and heroin ?. .. . Germany, Switzerland and Japan.
2. Cocaine Germany, Switzerland and Japan.
3 . Raw Opium Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes,
Turkey, Persia, India, Russia and
Greece.
4. Coca leaf Peru and Bolivia.?
These suggestions were adopted by the Council on March 12th, 1924.
At its fourth meeting, the Committee decided not to convene the above-mentioned Powers
in view of the fact that it had not been able to arrive at an agreement.


It therefore thought that it would be desirable to determine the world's annual legitimate
requirements of dangerous drugs. r prnmmendation of the Advisory Committee,

US were considered regarding the limitation of the manufacture of mor-
phine hereTn and cocaine, and the Committee reached the conclusion that it now seems
possible for the Governments of the producing countries to approach each other wit
view to reaching a general understanding.
It is the information obtained from the two sources above mentioned that has formed the
basis of the work of the Preparatory Committee. Up to the present. h-e ? be? -- d
puiriv-fwo Governments giving the information requested, ihe Governments nave aiso
been asked to give figures showing the amount of drugs manufactured within their territories,
the amounts imported, exported Ind re-exported and, if possible, the amounts actually con-
sumed. Several countries have given very full replies, but some of the manufac un g
countries have given no information as to the amount of the drugs manufactured.
The Sub-Committee referred to -above reported its opinion that 600 milligrammes pr
capita per annum might be considered a provisional maximum amount of raw opium, contain-
ing an average of 10 per cent of morphine, required for medical and scientific purposes. The
Health Committee of the League, at its meeting in February 1924, considered this report and
took the view that the estimate might be reduced to 450 milligrammes for countries possessing
a well-developed medical service. The report of the discussions at the-meeting of^ h �
Committee at which the matter was considered will be found in Document C. 213. M. 69. 1924.
The Preparatory Committee, during its various sessions, has discussed in detail the material
submitted to it, namely the information contained in the summary of the annual repor s
supplied by the Governments and the summary based on the estimated requirements for medica
anchscienti fic uses per capita per annum sent in by the various States. On various occasions
the Committee has instructed the Secretariat to obtain supplementary information on vano
questions raised in connection with these documents. Thus it was decided to enquire whether
it would be possible for the Health Committee to divide its estimate so as to show separately
the figures for the world?s requirements of morphine and heroin. .
The Health Committee, however, did not find it possible to subdivide the figure of 450
milligrammes in the way asked for. Separate estimates have been supplied by twenty-tour
Governments for their morphine and heroin requirements.
The Committee has also invited the Health Committee to continue its investigations into
the world?s requirements and to obtain further figures so as to provide a wider basis for a general
estimate The Health Committee has agreed to do this and also to prepare a similar estimate

When the Committee considered the possibility of limiting the production of raw materials,
the question was raised as to what crops could be substituted in the areas now occupied by t e
cultivation of the opium poppy and of the coca leaf in certain countries. In order to clear up
this question, the Secretariat was instructed to get in touch with the International Agncultura
Institute in Rome, asking it to make a study of the possibilities of substituting other crops in
place of opium and coca leaf and the approximate time necessary for the change of crop to take
place in the producing countries. This, the International Agricultural Institute has agreed
to undGrtcikc
For the purposes of the First Conference, the Preparatory Committee instructed the Secre-
tariat to communicate with the Governments of France, Great Britain, India, Japan, the
Netherlands, Portugal and Siam, requesting those of them which had not already done so to
supply detailed figures of the annual consumption of prepared opium in the Far Eastern
territories for the years 1921, 1922 and 1923 and the figures of the Chinese male population in
those territories over 21 years of age. The Governments of the countries quoted above were also
asked to supply information as to the final disposal of the dross produced.
After having studied all the material laid before them, the members of the Preparatory
Committee considered the preparation of a draft programme for the first and of a draft pro-
gramme and draft agreement to be submitted to the Second Conference.
111. With a view to the first Conference, the Preparatory Committee prepared a draft
programme which was circulated to the Governments invited to attend the Conference. The
Governments were requested to make any observations they might think useful with regard
to the programme. No objections having been received by the time the Committee made its


report, the Preparatory Committee during its session at Geneva in July 1924, adopted the final
text of the programme in the following form ;
1. Election of President and Vice-President, Officers of the Conference, and Com-
missions. Adoption of the Rules of Procedure, etc., etc.
2. (a) Examination and consideration of the present situation in regard to the
aDolication by the Powers represented of Part II of the International Opium Convention
of 1912 in their Far Eastern territories and of the difficulties which have been encountered
in giving effect to Part II j ? ~ ,
(b) Consideration of the measures which can be taken to carry out more effectively
the policy embodied in Part II of gradually suppressing the use of opium for smoking
with special reference to the suggestions put forward for consideration m the second
resolution adopted by the Opium Advisory Committee of the League of Nations at its
meeting in May 1923 (Appendix 7) ; and . ? ,
(c) Preparation of a convention to embody the measures which may be agreed
upon by the Conference.
3. Consideration {a) of the present situation in China with regard to the production
of opium in the neighbouring territories ; and ( b) of the measures which might be suggested
to the Government of the Chinese Republic for bringing about a suppression of the illegal
production and use of opium in China.
IV Five proposals, three of them in the form of draft agreements, have been prepared
with a view to submitting them to the Second Conference. All these proposals have been
discussed by the Preparatory Committee, namely the proposals put forward by the Chairman
(Netherlands), bv Sir Malcolm Delevmgne (Great Britain), by Mr. Neville (United States of
America), by M. Bourgois (France) and by M. Brenier. The Netherlands and the hrench draft
conventions are accompanied by explanatory notes The texts of the draft conventions the
documents which accompany them and the text of the other proposals are annexed to the
* r6S The Netherlands plan has in view only the limitation of the production of coca leaves,
entailing as a consequence the limitation of the manufacture of cocaine. _ The other ones cover,
in the opinion of the authors, the whole field of the Second Conference, including opium and its
derivatives as well as cocaine. The draft convention submitted by the Bntish member of the
Committee only deals actually with the limitation of the manufacture of cocaine and the pro-
duction of coca leaves, but it was a part of his proposal that a draft convention in similar terms
and with certain necessary adjustments should be applied to the manufacture of morp
and heroin and the production of raw opium. ,
The Committee began with the discussion of the cocaine question and as irreconcihable
differences manifested themselves on this, the Committee did not proceed to discuss the opium
question in detail, which was considered to be of a more complex nature.
V. Scheme and Expose of M. van Wettum.
M. van Wettum?s scheme, which was intended to cover the production and manufactuie
of cocaine, was presented in the form of two draft conventions the first to which the
countries (Peru and the Netherlands (Java) and Bolivia) should adhere, and the second, to
which all States attending the Conference should adhere. The reason that this scheme him s
itself to cocaine is that the opium questions are far more difficult to deal with on account of
the situation in the opium producing countries 2 . M. van Wettum bases his scheme on the
assumption that the Opium Convention of 1912 and the Import Certificate System are univer-
sally adopted, and that synthetic i-cocaine (a new invention produced from materials no
contained in the coca-leaf) is not yet on the market. M. van Wettum s proposal only takes
into account the raw material because it will be impracticable to ration by artificial means the
quantity to be turned out by every factory. A factory is always equipped for a certain or tp ,
which cannot be changed in an arbitrary way. There are also features which cannot
such as the conditions of competition and the variable preference given to a special manufacture.
Other reasons for only taking into account the raw material are that this raw material is rel
tivelv cheap that surplus stocks are always available, and that the cultivation is chiefly carried
on as a subsidiary one at least in Java. Thus, if it were to be possible> tc. restnc: the world s
output of cocaine, this would have to be accomplished by means of restricting the product o
of the raw material (coca leaves and raw cocaine required for the manufacture).
Although, it was to be admitted that the restriction of the production of the raw material
would involve?certain difficulties, these were of a less serious nature than those 'J 1 'I�*? 1 �*? A
rationing cocaine factories. Moreover, only two, perhaps three, exporting countries would
have to be dealt with. The proposal makes a monopoly of the export and the import_ofcoca
leaves and the production of cocaine, thus stabilising status quo But, apart from these
measures, which are necessary if a reduction of the world's output of cocaine is to be attained,

the scheme leaves the trade as free as possible. Although the six cocaine manufacturing
countries have no guarantee that they will get all the raw material they may want, as there is
no pro rata system, the raw material can only be exported or re-exported to the countries
which are now manufacturing for export purposes. Other States than these will be able in
future, in the same way and to the same extent as it is being carried on at the present moment
to manufacture their own cocaine from home-grown material and only for home consumption!
If we limit the quantities of the raw material exported, the decrease of cocaine production
will follow automatically. The scheme provides for a reduction of not more than 10 per cent,
and, at the same time, the exporting countries engage to check by all means in their power the
contraband traffic. Provided that we do not go too far, it will always be possible to ascertain
the consequences following on this decrease and to take the necessary steps in good time, if it
were found that this procedure did not lead to satisfactory results. ~ It must be remembered
that any reduction would almost certainly mean a substantial advance in the price of cocaine
and, in any case, the smuggling trade would also show a marked increase owing to the restrictive
measures which would be adopted. Once smuggling of a certain product is established as a
regular trade in consequence of measures which are not practicable, it will prove to be impossible
to check it. The basis on which reduction is to take place is not the amount of the world?s
requirements, because this cannot be fixed in any reliable way ; even in the event of a fair esti-
mate of the world?s requirements being obtained, this estimate could never be taken as a start-
ing point. Poor crops, wars, epidemics, etc., would have an influence incalculable beforehand.
Therefore, as a basis, is taken an average of export figures for the last years, making allowances
for present circumstances. It will be seen that the scheme takes into consideration not only
the quantities of coca leaves, but also the percentage of cocaine contained in the raw material,
because even in crops of the same country there may be very great differences in this respect.
The content of coca alkaloids may, as far as Java coca is concerned, vary from less than i per
cent, to more than 2 per cent., which means a difference of 100 per cent.
The scheme aims at monopolising the traffic, because no exporting Power would ever
consent to any restriction of output unless all other Powers bound themselves to desist from
the exportation of coca-leaf or raw cocaine as long as the agreement remained in force. In
order to ensure the efficiency of the agreement, not only exporting countries, but also other
Powers parties to the agreement should undertake to publish at short intervals their figures for
impoit, export, and production, both in regard to the raw material and the finished product.
Provision was also made for the institution of a permanent Committee composed of
lepresentatives of the coca-leaf exporting countries, which should regulate all matters connected
witu the expoit. The proposal also provides for the possibility of enouncing the treaty with
a somewhat short notice (one year).
During the dicsussion, the Chairman criticised the artificial means by which the cocaine
industry is maintained and encouraged in some countries, and expressed doubt as to whether
a Government could conclude any treaty on the subject of limitation of the manufacture of
drugs until these procedures were abolished. Also, he pointed out that one of the difficulties
would be to provide for a good system of determining the cocaine content of a leaf, because one
expert finds a percentage that differs widely from the percentage stated by another. Moreover,
t re content lessens by transport or by preserving, so the importer abroad never realises the
percentage stated at the export.
VI. The following objections to the Netherlands scheme were taken in the Committee :
1 ? It aims only at securing a ten per cent, reduction in the production of the coca leaf
and makes no attempt to limit the output of cocaine to the amount required for medical and
scientific purposes which is the object of the Conference. The present output of cocaine
is certainly much more than ten per cent, in excess of the world?s legitimate requirements and
it was thought that the reduction proposed would fall very short of what public opinion expects.
2. Though the production of the coca leaf is to be restricted in amount and confined to
.lie present producing it, no provision is made in the scheme for assuring that each
of the countries m which the leaf is used for the manufacture of cocaine (or other preparations!
will receive its fair share of the raw material. For instance, the Java leaf is essential for the
manufacture of cocaine by the process in use in several countries by which eegonine is first
isolated and then the cocaine is built up by the addition of the other constituents. Under this
scheme, however, the whole output of the Java leaf would be in the hands of the Dutch It is
certain that none of the other countries would agree to such a scheme. Powers in possession of
t r P � n�u u be +1 m a P osltlon t0 regulate prices ; the production of raw materials would

be eliminated as far as the raw material is concerned. The Chairman pointed out that the
comoe t it ion P anterS necessitate the maintenance of price-level, preventing the successful
competition of Peruvian and Bolivian coca leaves. Morevoer, since the invention of synthetic

4 ; It was thought by one of the members that experience in his country had shown that
rationing factories was perfectly possible. M. van Wettum replied that what could be done in
one State was not however possible for all the States of the world.


5 . Another member remarked that under this proposal, smuggling, which M. van Wettum
was trying to avoid, would still be possible. As to the contention that a serious restriction
of production would undoubtedly encourage smuggling, two members maintained that the
illicit trade at present existing would, at the worst, merely change its character.
6. Finally, it was considered a disadvantage that the plan would create a monopoly
which would perhaps be unacceptable to certain countries. The Chairman pointed out that
a monopoly was necessary if restriction in the line of the Assembly?s resolution was to be carried
out, and it was not fair that a country should be asked to limit the quantity of its exports
whilst another country could profit by its sacrifices.
VII. Scheme and Expose of Sir Malcolm Delevingne.
The British draft agreement only deals with the limitation of the manufacture of cocaine
and the production of the coca leaf, but, as already stated, the British proposals include the
application of measures analogous to those proposed in the draft agreement to morphine,
heroin, and opium. The following is a synopsis of this plan.
All countries would be invited to become parties to the agreement, whether manufacturing
the drug or producing the raw material at the present time or not.
The scheme proposed the limitation of the manufacture of the drug to a definite average
quantity yearly and of the production of the raw material to the amount required to manufac-
ture that quantity of the drug, fhese quantities would be based on the estimates furnished by
the States themselves of their annual consumption for medical and scientific purposes, with
a sufficient margin for contingencies, and would be fixed by the agreement, but would be
capable of revision from year to year. In the case of States which supplied no figuies as an
estimate of their requirements, the amount would be assessed by the Teague of Nations.
Each country at present manufacturing the drug would be assigned by the agreement
the quota of the total average quantity of the drug to be manufactured annually, and would
bind itself by agreement not to exceed its quota, not to import for the purpose of such manu-
facture more of the raw material than was necessary to manufacture the quota. The inten-
tion was that the quotas would be fixed on the basis of the present output of the manufacturing
countries, but account would have to be taken of the fact that a considerable propoition of the
output in some countries had been used for illegitimate purposes. The world s annual output
of the drug being thus limited to the amount required for legitimate medical and scientific
purposes it would become necessary to ensure that each country obtained the quantities of
the drug it required for such purposes, and that the supplies manufactured were not diverted
to illegitimate uses. It was accordingly proposed in the draft agreement that no country
should be allowed to import more for its own consumption than the amount stated in the esti-
mate furnished by it to the League of its internal requirements. If the country were also a
country of distribution and required additional supplies for re-export in the form of medicinal
preparations or otherwise, those supplies would only be furnished under the guarantee provided
by the Import Certificate System (strengthened in certain respects) for ensuring that the re-
export to any country would be limited in accordance with its requirements for medical and
scientific purposes. Every country would be allowed to revise from year to year, if necessary
its estimate of the amount required by it for its legitimate consumption. It was thought that
the publicity which would be afforded by the publication of periodical reports on the working
of the agreement would be sufficient to prevent any country asking for supplies greatly in excess
of its legitimate needs. , , . u
Correspondence provisions were inserted in the draft to limit the production of the raw
material for the manufacture of the drug, and its export and distribution to the manufacturing
countries The scheme proposed to limit the production of the raw material for export lor the
purposes of such manufacture to the average amount required to manufacture the annual
quantity of the drug fixed by the agreement. The amount would be allocated among the
countries producing the raw material on the basis of their present production. It would be
capable of revision from year to year in accordance with any alterations in the amount of
the manufactured drug required for legitimate purposes. Provision would also be made
making any necessary adjustments in the amount in view of the fact that the drug content
of the raw material might be a variable quantity. ,
While the scheme was based on the present situation in regard to the manufacture of
the drug and production of the raw material, it did not propose that the right of manufacture
or production should be confined to the present manufacturing or producing Any
country which desired in the future to start the manufacture of the drug or the production
of the raw material would retain full liberty to do so, but, as the entry of a new country into
the field of manufacture or production would necessitate an alteration of the arrangements
in the agreement, it was proposed by the draft to ask all countries to agree beffirestartig
manufacture or production to give notice to the League, and, if they proposed to manufacture
or produce for export, to enter into negotiations with the existing manufacturing or produci g
countries as to the quota of manufacture or production to be allotte to it. OTYir , inr uc
To provide the machinery necessary for revising from time to time the total amounts
to be manufactured or produced, and for adjusting the points which \\ou necessan y arise
in connection with the working of arrangements closely affecting industry and commerce
the scheme proposed that a Board consisting of representatives of t e manu ac urmg
producing countries (with possibly one or more representatives of the other countries) should
be set up to adjust difficulties and generally to facilitate the working of t e agreemen


The two parts of the scheme, that is, control of the manufacture of the drug and control
of the production of the raw material are not inseparable The control of the manufacture
of the drug is the more important and that part of his scheme could stand by itself even if
the countries producing the raw material could not be got into the agreement.
Provisions were inserted in the draft to meet the difficulties that would arise if a manufac-
turing or producing country refused to come into or left the agreement.
During the discussion, Sir Malcolm Delevingne pointed out that his proposal includes no
provision with regard to existing stocks.
VIII. The following objections were raised against Sir Malcolm Delevingne s scheme
i. It was too complicated.
2 . It was based on the supposition that the present production is known, but we do not
know the cocaine production of certain countries.
a. The manufactures would be left in a position of continuous uncertainty about the
Quantities they would be allowed to manufacture. If a. country desired to manufacture
cocaine for its own internal consumption, in order to permit it to do so it would be necessary
to reduce the production of the existing manufacturers. Moreover, the powers reserved
under the scheme to a non-producing country to manufacture for home consumption were
purely illusory ; a necessary consequence of the carrying on of a drug industry is the power
to market part of the produce abroad ; but such a country would be authorised to export
only after an agreement concluded between it and the former manufacturing countries, an
agreement obviously very difficult to arrive at since the parties concerned, who are alone
entitled to discuss it, will naturally desire to keep down the number of their competitors.
4. The limitation goes too far (danger of smuggling).
4 a . It would amount to creating for the benefit of signatory countries a monopo y
in regard to the production and sale of the raw material. Powers in possession of this monopoly
would regulate prices ; they would do this the more easily, as the production of raw material
would be fully controlled by the Governments or by strong trade associations, and as the
quantity of raw material for export is laid down in the case of each country, all competition
would be eliminated.
c It is not possible to get reliable figures for the world s total No per
capita figures can be found which can be more or less generally applied, as the conditions differ
in the various countries.
6. It is impossible to arrive at a fixed percentage of the normal needs to meet the abnor-
mal requirements caused by the war, epidemics, etc. One cannot take a definite figure as a
margin Practice alone can show whether a certain available surplus world stock wall prove to
be sufficient or not. If, however, a margin be desired, this margin must prove to be bigger than
the basic figure itself.
7. It is practically impossible to fix a system of allocation for the manufacturing coun-
tries. No country would confess that a part of its production was intended for the smuggling
trade the more so that no factory could present the stuff sold to a bonafide merchant going into
illicit?channels when disposed of by the person to whom it is sold or by the person to whom
it may be eventually resold.
8. With regard to the official body which should control the application of the Conven-
tion, it was objected that it would be difficult to compose this body in such a way that its
decisions would be impartial to all questions. One of the members of the Committee thought
that the control should be left with a body of experts independent of the Governments.
9. The rationing of the factories would operate in such a manner as to impede all fair
competition.
10. If other countries than those already producing are allowed to produce, this would
lead to difficulties. Two possibilities can be thought of :
(a) Coca leaf growing would be stopped if the producers were not sure of a certain
market.
( b ) The price would increase to such an extent that countries which did not now
manufacture cocaine for internal use would start doing so in the future, with the result
that factories in small countries which could not subsist on internal trade alone would
be squeezed out. This would be an undesirable position for the country concerned.
11. Inherent to Sir Malcolm Delevingne?s scheme is a boycott system which would lead
to the creation of centres of smuggling, or to the moving of factories from countries which adhere
to the Convention to countries which do not adhere to it. Also it was doubted whether it
were legally possible for a country bound by a commercial treaty with another country to
agree to any such boycotting.
12. Articles 17, 18 and 19 are of such a nature that either
(a) they ought to be previously discussed by the Advisory Committee, or,
( b) their legal character makes it impossible to take any decision at short notice
They would bring something new into the legislation of many countries.


Sir Malcolm Delevingne replied to these objections. The British Government took
the view that as long as the drugs were manufactured greatly in excess of the amounts required
for legitimate, medical and scientific purposes, it would be impossible to prevent the traffic
in them for illicit purposes. The limitation of the manufacture of the drugs to the amounts
required for medical and scientific purposes was therefore essential. The Opium Advisory
Committee came to the conclusion at its meeting last year that sufficient material as to the
world?s legitimate requirements had been collected to enable such a limitation to be effected.
In the first instance, the figure would necessarily be approximate and would have to be fixed
sufficiently high to allow a margin for error. He thought that it would be possible, as the en-
quiries were continued, to obtain trustworthy figures for the legitimate requirements of the
various countries. As regards the allocation of the quotas among the different manufacturing
countries, he started from the supposition that all the manufacturing countries would give their
figures of the amounts manufactured at present. On a rough calculation, he estimated that,
in the case of cocaine, the reduction, in the first instance, on the estimates of requirements
already supplied was about 25 per cent'. Sir Malcolm Delevingne did not think that it would
be impossible to fix a reasonable margin for not too abnormal circumstances. As regards
quite abnormal circumstances, such as a big war, the position would be much the same as at
present. Special steps could be taken to augment the supply. It would be necessary to pro-
vide for a new country to begin the manufacture of drugs, because if this were not done many
countries would perhaps not adhere to the Convention, being unwilling to concede a permanent
monopoly to the States which already manufacture.
As to the contention that the powers reserved to a non-producing country to manufacture
for home consumption were illusory, because the carrying on of the drug industry is not possible
without the power to market part of the produce abroad and because such a country would be
authorised to export only after an agreement with the existing manufacturing States, Sir Mal-
colm Delevingne pointed out that the objection was based on a misreading of his scheme. It
did not require that an agreement must be reached before the new country could start. That
would place such a country at the mercy of the existing manufacturing countries. All that
would be required was that it should first enter into negotiations, bonafide negotiations of
course, with a view to an agreement. He assumed that the parties would be reasonable.
All of them would be parties to the same Convention. But even in the event of the impos-
sibility to come to an agreement, nothing would prevent the new country starting manufacture.
As to the objection that it would create for the benefit of signatory countries a monopoly in
regard to the production and sale of raw material, Sir Malcolm Delevingne pointed out that the
scheme had been drawn up on the assumption that the great majority of the producing coun-
tries would participate in it. If a large proportion of the producing countries did not come
into the agreement, the clauses relating to the control of production would simply be omitted
and that part of the scheme which dealt with the limitation of manufacture would not be
affected. There was no intention of granting any monopoly to any country producing the
raw material. If, as suggested, the prices would increase after his scheme, it was a proof that
the present situation was a bad one. If cocaine can be sold at a much lower price in present
circumstances, it must be because of the excessive output, a good deal of which finds its way
into illicit channels. When it is said that the manufacturers would be in a state of uncertainty
as to the amount that they could produce, Sir Malcolm Delevingne saw no reason to suppose
that if attempts were not made to send up the price unduly, the countries which did not manu-
facture their cocaine at the moment would manufacture in the future, when his scheme was
put into operation. Even if some countries started to manufacture for their own use, the ad-
vantage in the open market would always lie with the country which produced in larger quan-
tities. The greater the number of countries, however, which produced what they required for
their own legitimate consumption, the better. If in the case of any of the countries which at
present manufacture, the proportionate reduction in the manufacture would make it impossible
for its factories to continue, the allocation could be so arranged as not to squeeze such factories
out of existence. Sir Malcolm Delevingne did not think it would be unreasonable or difficult
to establish a boycott to the extent of refusing to import raw material or manufactured drugs
from countries which did not adhere to the Convention. He did not agree to the proposal
of one of the members, suggesting a board composed of experts not responsible to any Govern-
ment. Finally, it must be borne in mind that the draft presented is a first draft only, which
may require to be modified in certain details.
IX. Proposal presented by Mr. Neville.
The scheme submitted by Mr. Neville was intended to cover the production of the raw
material and the manufacture of harmful narcotic drugs derived therefrom. The quantities
of opium and coca leaves to be produced for export, either in total or by each country indivi-
dually, should be fixed. The production of opium and coca leaves should be confined to the
present producing States (5 States for opium and 3 for coca). Import of the raw material
for the manufacture of narcotic drugs should be confined to the States at present manufacturing.
The quantity to be imported by each manufacturing State should be fixed. Manufacture
for export should be confined to States at present manufacturing for that purpose ; the import
and the export of opium, coca leaves and derivatives, and preparations should be restricted
to medicinal and scientific purposes. Arrangements should be provided to permit produc-
tion and manufacture by States not now producing and manufacturing. Ihe Import and
Export Certificate System should be universally applied. An International Board or Com-
mittee should be established to regulate and adjust such modifications as might be necessary


in the schedules of the quantities allotted to manufacturing or producing States. These
modifications might be due to the varying estimates submitted by the Governments of the
various countries. The Board should further ensure complete publicity xegarding the amount
of opium and coca leaves produced, the amount of the drugs manufactured and consumed,
and the amounts exported and imported.
The transportation of all raw material and drugs should be so controlled as to prevent
unlicensed shipments on any vessels or through the territories of any parties to the agicement.
X. The objections against the American proposal were much the same as the ones
against the British. It presented the same disadvantages with regard to rationing, too sudden
decreases of production, and in the same way as the British scheme, it was built on the sup-
position that the figures of the manufacture in all countries were known, and that reliable figures
could be obtained for per capita requirements, which supposition was deemed not to be
justifiable. The American proposal also provided for the same measures to be taken against
excessive production of opium and of coca, which system was open to the objection that the con-
ditions in opium producing countries were quite different from that of the coca leaf producing
countries. The per capita figure for opium which had been submitted to the Preparatory Com-
mittee, namely 450 milligrammes, could still be subject to criticism. It was also considered a
disadvantage that some of the terms used in the American proposal do not agree with the terms
of the Convention of 1912, both as far as prepared opium is concerned (preamble) as well as
narcotics. Some of the terms were rather too vague. According to the American proposal,
the quantity of raw opium to be exported by each opium producing country was to be fixed ;
thereby all competition would be suppressed and the various countries would not be free to
buy raw opium for preparation purposes where they wanted to ; this would be unacceptable
because of the preference given to the opium of ceitain countries. It was also thought of
little value to forbid export from other countries than those mentioned in the new arrangement
as this was a measure which could not be enforced. Articles 2 and 4 of the American draft
convention only mentioned coca leaves and not crude cocaine ; neither did they take into con-
sideration the difference of morphine and cocaine contents in the raw materials. In the annex
to Article 4, the Netherlands are omitted in the list of countries allowed to manufacture mor-
phine, etc., for export. It was not clear how Article 4 would be enforced with regard to coun-
tries which were not parties to the Convention. The only way of dealing with countries which
did not adhere would be to establish a kind of boycott. The boycott also seemed to be the
consequence of the enforcement of Article 3> and would be unacceptable for several countiies,
Article 5 was thought to be an undesirable extension of the terms of the Convention of 1912,
which would prevent the export of harmless derivatives of the raw materials in question from
other countries than those which were manufacturing cocaine and morphine. The American
scheme finally would result in an extension of official interference with trade ; it would make
it necessary to appoint a great many new Government officials ; it would incur excessive
expenses involved in the supervision of the traffic, and it would intensify smuggling. Article 6
limits the whole trade in narcotics under the Convention to the parties thereto. The unlimited
right to the seizure of narcotics proposed in Article 9 was also a dangerous measure to take.
Mr. Neville replied to the objection against the terms he had used, saying that this draft
convention was not meant to deal with the question of prepared opium, as this subject would
already have been dealt with by the First Conference. With regard to the harmless derivatives,
Mr. Neville said that unless control of all forms of derivatives were established, it would be
impossible to supervise the traffic in an effective way. The United States Government
thought that the traffic in derivatives should not be regarded as an ordinary trade, and that
it should be, as far as possible, discouraged. In reference to the difficulty in bringing offending
States to account, Mr. Neville pointed out that the whole scheme was necessarily based on
the assumption that the manufacturing States would subscribe to the agreement and would
take measures to protect themselves if at any time countries outside the agreement began to
manufacture the drugs for illicit purposes. Article 9of the proposal did not imply the right
of seizure on the high seas.
XI. M. Bourgois Scheme and Expose.
In his explanatory note (Appendix 4 a), M. Bourgois points out, to begin with, that the
direct limitation of production i.e., its limitation by fixing two totals, one for world production
and the other for the share of manufacture allocated to each country is open to the objection
that it would cause the whole system of an international convention to rest on two bases which
are almost inconsistent ; for of these two totals, the first is indeterminate and the second is
very largely arbitrary. The quota of each country must be capable of constant revision. The
Governments of manufacturing countries should undertake to compel their manufacturers
to consent to any sudden reduction of manufacture which might be necessary, in order to allow
any country which decided to begin manufacture for the purpose of its own internal consump-
tion, and even for the purpose of entering the foreign trade, to take its place with the other
manufacturing countries.
The following principles should, in M. Bourgois? view, be followed in drawing up the
future Convention :
1. The Convention must be easily acceptable by all the countries, for otherwise
the industry would merely be transferred to the non-signatory States and would thus escape
international control.


2 . The Convention must be based on the principles of equality and free competition.
Any system of monopoly or boycott, or the granting of any privileges, would incite certain
countries to cultivate and manufacture for themselves, thus creating new sources of produc-
tion and, indirectly, of contraband trade.
3. It must not be forgotten that the control of the export of raw material is
impossible in most of the exporting countries ; and it does not seem probable that it will
be organised in these countries within a short time.
Any direct limitation of production violates these principles. On the other hand, these
difficulties can be avoided by the system of indirect limitation.
This indirect limitation can be achieved by the organisation of a strict national and inter-
national control of persons, buildings and materials ; the latter would be kept under control
both in national and international traffic. Just as it has been possible to organise effectively
the control of national trade in drugs in many countries by the adoption of legislative measures,
so the control of the international trade, the only source of smuggling in these countries, can
be effectively organised by the adoption of international measures of a similar nature to the
national measures (these should cover notably free ports, transit, warehousing, etc.).
M. Bourgois desires that Articles 10, 12 and 13 of the Opium Convention of 1912 should
become imperative. Moreover, he wishes measures taken against smuggling, which is now made
possible by lack of control of transhipment, bonded warehouses, free ports, free zones, and ex-
port by parcel post.
In order to reach his goal, M. Bourgois submits a draft arrangement (Appendix 4h) in which
the Contracting Parties bind themselves to give a strict application to Articles 9, 10, 11, 12
and 13 of the Opium Convention, as completed by the stipulations of the present draft. The
provisions of his Draft are the following ;
1. The receptacles used for the despatch of the drugs referred to in Chapter 111 should
carry labels which should show the name and quantity of the product and the name of the
consignor and consignee.
2. The use of the system of ?acquit a caution? when importing.
3 . The use of export permits in duplicate : one copy to accompany the drug to its ultimate
destination and the other to be sent to the diplomatic agent of the importing country in the
exporting country ; on the first copy is to be recorded all movements and inspections to which
each receptacle has been subjected.
4. No transhipment without permit.
5. Drugs to be stored in a bonded warehouse only by duly authorised persons who will
be responsible for any movement of the warehoused articles. No import allowed without
?acquit a caution?. No export to other countries without export permits. To abolish the
system of free bonded warehouses as far as drugs are concerned.
6. Consignments by parcel post to be dealt with in the same manner as other consign-
ments.
7. Raw opium or any drug falling under Chapter 111 of the Convention found in the
possession of an unauthorised person to be seized and the person on whom it is found to be
liable to either imprisonment or fine, or both in conjunction.
8. Mutual and complete exchange of information between the centralised authorities
in different countries.
9. The inclusion of coca leaves and synthetic i-cocaine in the Opium Convention of 1912.
XII. The objections against the French proposal were the following :
1. It discarded completely the object of the Second Conference which was to consider
the possibility of limiting the manufacture of drugs to definite amounts corresponding to
legitimate requirements. All the discussions in the Advisory Committee had been conducted
on this assumption and twenty-one Governments had already transmitted an approximate
estimate of their total requirements for internal consumption. Moreover, the Resolution of
the Assembly, under which the Conference would be convened, clearly defined such limitations
as the object of the Conference, whilst these proposals aimed merely at the improvement of
the provisions contained in Articles 9 to 13 of the existing Hague Convention.
2. It seemed to be ineffective from the international point of view, as it involved the
abandoning of the Import Certificate System, which had been acknowledged as the only effec-
tive system of controlling the international traffic,- and which had already been accepted by
over 30 countries. Moreover, it was not in compliance with Article 3 and Article 13 of the
Convention. The system of export permits in duplicate proposed in substitution afforded no
guarantees at all against the export of drugs to countries which did not want or require them
or to countries where they would be used to supply the illicit traffic.
3 . It limits the bonding of opium, etc., to persons duly authorised, a system which seemed
to be impracticable.
4. It implied an alteration in the principles of penal law in certain countries.


5. The criticism that direct limitation rests on two inconsistent bases was not admitted.
It was also pointed out that the references on page 9 to a system of boycott inciting the
boycotted countries to cultivate and manufacture for themselves, did not touch the Bntis
scheme for limitation, as there was no proposal in that scheme to prevent a-country which
might remain outside the Convention from being supplied with the amounts that mig t be
necessary for its legitimate requirements. r
M. Bourgois replied that, as some members of the Committee had considered that the limi-
tation of the production of raw opium was not possible, there was accordingly no reason why
the French Government should be reproached for abandoning the diiect limitation of manu-
facture. It aimed at achieving limitation indirectly by limiting contraband. He maintained
that the Hague Convention was only to a certain extent ineffective, because it was incomplete
as far as transit, free ports, warehousing or free zones were concerned : in the same way as it
has proved to be possible to accomplish an efficient control of the national trade, you may
accomplish the same results as to the international trade by completing the measures of the
Convention.
XIII. M. Brenier?s Proposal.
(Appendix 5) The principal characteristic of M. Brenier?s plan which is very similar
to the French plan, but contains more detailed provisions is a system of a very strict control
which, in its author?s view, would result in an indirect limitation of the raw products and drugs
in question to legitimate medical and scientific needs alone. M. Brenier emphasises the fact
that such limitation, by whatever method it is attained, is the essential purpose to be aimed at,
and is much more important than the method itself. He does not believe in the practicability
of rationing, especially when the rations have perpetually to be revised.
The note reviews the two aspects of the problem and shows : (1) how a countiy could be
made to receive and allow to remain in circulation within its territories only the quantities
corresponding to its own legitimate medical and scientific needs ; (2) how a country could be
prevented from sending to other countries quantities exceeding the legitimate medical and
scientific needs of the latter. .
The measures by which these two needs can be attained may be summarised as follows :
(1) strict supervision of the persons licensed to import and export ; (2) strict supei vision of
ports and frontier towns by which the products in question can enter a country (these products
must always be enclosed in special packages) ; (3) by rendering it compulsory to stoie these
products in special warehouses in ports and frontier towns and even in the interior of the coun-
try ( cf. tobacco in France) ; (4) movement of the products in question, when coming from abroa ,
to be permitted only under the system of the ?acquit a caution with cash deposit , (5) regis-
ters to be kept in the regulation form ; (6) limitation of quantities imported (the figure to
be voluntarily chosen on the basis of what the investigations of the Preparatory Committee,
the Advisory Opium Committee and the Health Committee of the League shall show to be a
reasonable figure for requirements per head per annum); (7) 1 exercice (in the Frenc
meaning of this word) of the manufacture of morphine, heroin and cocaine, and various othci
measures of the same nature. As regards the control of exportation, the indispensable measure
should be the general application of the import certificate system, or of a similar system having
the same effect.
The detailed provisions for putting these measures into force should be included in the
treaty. The latter will have to be completed by equally definite articles regaiding . the time
limits within which the national legislative measures and regulations must be promulgated
in conformitv with the treaty ; the reciprocal communication of these measures and their com
munication to the League ; the penalties incurred by breaches of the regulations ; the reciprocal
communication of statistics in general and of the statistics regarding breaches of the regulations
and the more serious cases of contraband, and communication of these statistics to the League ,
the form in which these statistics must be sent to the League and time-limits to the same ;
special regulations for postal packets and transit ; special obligations to be imposed on conveyers
(railway companies, maritime, river and canal navigation companies, motor and aerial transport
companies).
XIV. The objections against M. Brenier?s proposal were the following :
1. The system is not in conformity with the object of the Conference, i.e., the limitation
of production.
2. The measure of internal control proposed was very elaborate and on different lines
from the schemes of control which were already adopted in some countries, such as Great Bri-
tain, and which were working satisfactorily. It entailed also the employment of a large number
of officials. The stricter measures provided for in it would only be applied in those countries
that have already enforced satisfactory regulations. Other countries would not come into line
or would be incapable of adopting such a meticulous system of control.
3 . Inasmuch as the latter countries are producing countries, they would not be forced, as
was contended, to limit their production to a great extent. On the contrary, a worse situation
might result from it, because, if restriction would really be the result, prices would advance
and the clandestine trade would consequently show more activity.
4. The proposal starts from the supposition that the illicit trade gets its material from the
visible traffic, whilst a great deal undoubtedly comes forth out of the invisible traffic, which
would not be hit by this control and would even actually be stimulated by it.


5 ? As for the establishment of new factories, the increase of prices of the raw material
to be expected from the measures would certainly make that establishment realisable.
6. It was pointed out that a difficulty would arise in regard to the amount to be fixed
by the Government for importation for purposes of export trade.
M. Brenier replied to the objections that, if any limitation were to be accomplished, it
could, in his opinion, only be effected by a more strict control, because imports could be checked
by it. Moreover, his scheme had been drawn up on the assumption that all countries would
agree to it. He maintained that his system would lead to indirect limitation, because countries
not accepting this system would not be able, in his opinion, to find a market in countries under
control.
XV. The Committee greatly regretted that it had been unable to come to any agreement
as between these different proposals, and was therefore not in a position to submit a definite
programme for the second Conference.
XVI. The Committee has arranged for the statistical information to be published in
two volumes, one relating to the first Conference and the other relating to the second Confe-
rence.
XVII. The Committee expressed the hope that the observations of the Advisory Com-
mittee on this report, which is to be submitted to it in accordance with the decision of the
Council, may be communicated to the Governments which have been invited to the Conferences
on the earliest possible date.
Appendix 1 [a).
Draft Treaty Relating to the Coca Leaf, submitted by M. van Wettum.
i . Explanatory Note.
In so far as coca, and may be also cocaine, is concerned, restrictive measures will only be
effective as long as synthetical cocaine has not been put on the market.
With regard to cocaine, the effects of its being put on the market depend on the question
whether or not synthetic cocaine will fall under the terms of the Convention. In the event
of this synthetic product being prepared without the coca leaf, it does not fall under the terms
of the Convention, and it is no use causing it to be subject thereto if its preparation offers
no difficulties and if the ingredients used in the preparation are harmless and obtainable
every where.
Direct restriction of the manufacture of cocaine, which in view of Article g of the Conven-
tion should be primarily considered, cannot lead to any satisfactory result. It is impracticable
to ration by artificial means the quantity to be turned out by every factory. This quantity
cannot be reduced at discretion in view of the ultimate profits as well as of the fact that
the plant is equipped for maximum and minimum outputs while the demand for a product
of a certain factory is influenced by factors that cannot be taken into account in the event of
quantities being limited to a fixed ration. Among these factors may be mentioned competition
and the variable preference given to a special manufacture.
In addition, the price of this manufacture is dependent on labour conditions, and the factory
with a curtailed output will not be in a position to sell its products if the cost price becomes
too high. The question may now be raised how, in case of rationing, the world is to obtain
its necessary quantum of cocaine at a moderate price.
If it is at all possible to restrict the world?s output of cocaine, it will have to be done by
means of restricting the raw material (coca leaves and raw cocaine) required for the manufac-
ture of cocaine, this raw material being cheaper than cocaine.
The price of the raw material, apart from the preference given to a material drawn from
a special country in this case a more or less constant factor is likewise affected by local
labour conditions. These conditions, however, are by far less predominant than in the case
of cocaine factories, also because the cultivation is chiefly carried on as a secondary one, at
least in Java.
Though it must be admitted that here, also, rationing would involve some difficulties,
these difficulties are less serious in nature than in the case of cocaine factories, since only two
exporting countries have to be dealt with and, moreover, surplus stocks are always available.
Besides, if the limiting of the exported quantities takes place by gradual degrees and does
not exceed io per cent the first time, it will always be possible to ascertain the consequences
entailed by this decrease and to consider in good time whether it is desirable to pursue the same
line of conduct.
It is, inter alia, anticipated that the price of cocaine will show a substantial advance and
that contraband traffic will flourish to a marked extent likewise owing to restrictive measures
being adopted b This illicit trade will draw its stocks either from the material legitimately
l At the present moment contraband traffic already yields enormous profits. By way of example,
it may be mentioned that, while wholesale prices per kilogramme averaged frs. 250 in 1923 it was
clandestinely sold at Bombay at prices ranging from Rs. 50 to Rs. 80 per ounce, which means an average
price of Rs. 65 per ounce, a price equivalent to frs. 1832 per kilogramme, i.e., more than seven times the
price in the licit market.


produced or from the leaf of the coca shrub, widely spread in South America, which leaf is
known for its richness in cocaine. Measures to check this traffic are seldom very effective,
for, though the manufacturers are as a rule hona-fide, second and third-hand dealers are
frequently in a position to earn large profits in illicit trade, either through total lack of or
inadequate national supervision, or because, in practice, this supervision is difficult to carry
through.
In respect of the intended restriction of the exported raw material, one should not start
from a definite quantity to supply the world?s requirements, which cannot be calculated with
sufficient approximation. One should start from the accomplished fact that there is an excess
of world production in view of the legitimate consumption. Even in the event of a fair estimate
of the world?s requirements being obtained, which seems to be impossible, this estimate could
never be taken as a starting-point. Poor crops, wars, epidemics, etc., would have an influence
which would be incalculable beforehand. It is impossible to adopt a fixed percentage of the
normal needs to meet the abnormal requirements, and the only way to supply the latter
icquirements is an availability of a surplus world stock. The extent of this surplus cannot
be expressed in figures and even a number of year?s practice cannot prove more than its
adequacy or inadequacy.
In order to attain the desired cuitailment, coca leaves should first be made subject to the
stipulations of the Convention, whereupon the exporting countries (the Netherlands and Peru)
should come to a mutual agreement as to the quantities of coca leaf or raw cocaine destined
for export. _ They should agree on the quantity of leaf (or of the raw cocaine) to be taken as a
noim. This noim will have to come very near the average export figure for a couple of years
to be regarded as normal ones in the light of present circumstances.
The market value of the leaf is largely affected by the percentage of cocaine or other alka-
loids, without being in proportion thereto. This percentage may show differences of 100 per
cent and more, even in crops of one and the same country, and can be enhanced by manuring
and the way of gathering in the crop. The norm in the above agreement will, therefore, have
to be determined by two factois ; weight and percentage of cocaine. For this percentage, could
be adopted the average of the crops yielded during the last few years. If it should prove after
the lapse of one year that this aveiage, as far as export is concerned, is subject to large increases
and decreases, c.g., of five per cent or more, revision of the quantum and the percentage
figure of the norm might be contemplated.
The exporting countries will undertake to regard the norm obtained, reduced by 10 per
cent, as the maximum for their annual exports and at the same time engage duly to check
contraband traffic.
The exporting Powers, however, will never be favourably disposed towards any restriction
unless all other Powers should bind themselves to desist from the exportation of coca leaf or
raw cocaine, as long as the agreement shall be in force, also in so far as their colonies, protector-
ates and the like are concerned, an exception being made for the six cocaine-producing Powers.
These Powers, with the exclusion of others, manufacture cocaine also for export purposes and,
therefore, transactions in the raw material may exclusively be carried on among these countries
mutually. It would not be fair if this condition were not fulfilled, as, side by side with export-
ing countries restricting their culture, there would be others that extended it without having
been confronted by the cares and troubles attendant on restriction. Moreover, it is essential
to see that the growing of coca leaf continues to be a profitable culture in the future.
In order to ensure the efficiency of the agreement, not only the exporting countries but
also the other Powers should undertake to give at short intervals a general publicity to their
import production and export figures, both in regard to the raw material and the worked up
product. This publicity is likewise to include transport by parcel post.
The Powers not included in the agreement proper affecting restriction, should extend their
co-opeiation also in other lespects. They should all be members of the Convention or of the
extension given thereto and should all of them apply the import certificate system If these
demands are not put forward and if some countries are holding aloof, the latter will soon become
the centres of a lucrative contraband traffic, against which no boycott will be of any avail ;
on the conti aiy, as aheady stated, this illicit trade will flourish to a large extent under universal
restrictive regulations.
Finally as a supplement to the arrangements made in respect of coca leaf and raw cocaine,
it is essential to fix by treaty to what countries the raw material can be exported for the purpose
of being worked up into cocaine.
A curtailment of the manufacture of cocaine is automatically obtained in the way stated
a ove. But in like manner as for coca and for the very same reason, it is necessary to lay down
also for cocaine a condition which should be universally observed, viz. , that no other countries
u i? 11 - C �i� n^eS ? e^c ?) ?^ a ll proceed to the production of cocaine as long as the agreement
s all be in force, unless it be for home consumption and from home-grown leaf, in so far and
a -ff. 1110 ex^ as this production is being carried on at the present moment.
two draft treaties in outline, the one marked 2, to be concluded between Peru and
the Netherlands, and the other marked 3, to be entered into by all Powers except Peru, the pro-
posal would further state that the scheme is chiefly founded on the thought that export of the
raw material can be restricted, a realisable thought, notably as far as Java is concerned.
Adopaon of the scheme, however, could only take place by way of experiment, it being impos-
sible to foresee the consequences of a drastic interference with the world?s traffic. Among others
there are consequences due to preferential rights to be granted to railways or vessels of certain
countnes, or created by fluctuations in exchanges, which consequences cannot be taken into
account. It is, therefore, a matter of course that, for whatever reasons, any party concerned
should have power to denounce, at a relatively short notice, the agreement entered into.


The agreements set forth in the annexed drafts cannot be concluded until the previous
demands, inter alia, those concerning universal adoption of the provisions of the Convention
and universal introduction of the import certificate system, shall have been satisfied.

each of the High Contracting Parties agrees :
(1) That it will not allow the export or re-export of cocaine to any country for purposes
of 1 e-export unless that country has introduced in respect of cocaine the import certificate sys-
tem and is a party to this Convention ;

Appendix 3.
Draft Programme submitted by Mr. Neville.
In order to suppress the abusive use of dangerous drugs, diminish the present over-
production of opium and coca leaves and achieve the objects which the International Opium
Convention was designed to accomplish, the High Contracting Parties undertake to adopt,
from time to time, in so far as they have not already done so, and varying local conditions
permit, domestic measures to the end that ultimately the use of opium, coca leaves and their
dangerous derivatives and preparations will be confined to medical and scientific purposes,
and they agree, as among themselves, that :
I. The total quantity of opium which they will produce for export or permit to be
exported shall be kilos annually. Such quantity shall consist of kilos for
medical and scientific purposes and kilos for purposes temporarily permissible under
Chapter II of the International Opium Convention, the latter quantity being in accordance
with an agreement among certain States hereto annexed as Appendix I. Raw opium may
be produced for export only in the territory of those States mentioned in Appendix 11.
11. The total quantity of coca leaves which they will produce for export or permit to be
exported shall be kilos, which may be produced for export only in the territory of
those States mentioned in Appendix 111.
HI. Each importation or exportation of raw opium or coca leaves must be authorised
by a licence or permit by the Government of the importing State showing that the shipment
may be legally made into the receiving State, which must be a party to the International
Opium Convention.
IV. Raw opium and coca leaves may be imported into the States mentioned in Appendi-
ces IV and V, respectively, both for purposes of manufacture for export and for domestic medi-
cal and scientific needs ; but they may be imported only for domestic medical and scientific
needs into the States not mentioned therein, except as otherwise provided in Appendix I. The
maximum quantity of opium which the States mentioned in Appendix IV may import annually
shall be kilos ; the maximum quantity of coca leaves which the States mentioned in
Appendix V may import annually shall be kilos.
V. Derivatives and preparations of opium and coca leaves may be imported both for
purposes of further manufacture for export and for domestic medical and scientific needs by
the States mentioned in Appendices IV and V, respectively, but for domestic medical and
scientific needs only by the States not mentioned therein. Derivatives and preparations of
opium and coca leaves may be manufactured for export only in the States mentioned in Appen-
dices IV and V, respectively.
Except as provided in Appendix I, importations and exportations of opium, coca leaves
and their derivatives and preparations coming within the purview of the International Opium
Convention shall be solely for medical and scientific purposes.
VI. Each importation or exportation of any derivatives or preparation of opium or
coca leaves coming within the purview of the International Opium Convention must be
authorised by a licence or permit issued by the Government of the importing State showing that
the shipment may be legally made into such State ; likewise, a licence or permit must be
issued by the Government of the exporting State showing that the shipment may be legally
made from that State. Both the importing and exporting States must be parties to the Inter-
national Opium Convention ; provided, however, that, temporarily, medicines in small quanti-
ties containing or consisting of any such derivatives or preparation may be exported to a State
not a party thereto for its domestic medical needs.
VII. A committee of experts shall be appointed as provided in Appendix VI, whose
duties shall be as follows
i. To modify from time to time; as shown to be necessary by estimates submitted as
required by Article VIII, the maximum quantities of opium and coca leaves to be produced
for export or to be exported from the countries mentioned in Appendices II and 111,
respectively.
2. To modify as shown to be necessary from estimates submitted, the proportionate
quantities of the maximum quantities of opium and coca leaves to be produced for export
or to be exported by each State mentioned in Appendices II and HI, respectively.


3- To fix annually from estimates submitted, as required under Article VIII, the maxi-
mum quantities of opium and coca leaves which may be imported by each State, In case no
estimates are submitted, the Committee shall fix maximum quantities upon a per capita basis,
using grams of opium and ...... grams of coca leaves per annum as the normal medical
requirement.
Provided that the quantities so fixed under this and the two preceding clauses shall
not exceed the total quantities fixed by the conference without the consent of all the producing
and manufacturing States affected.
4. To publish annually statistics of the production, importation, exportation, manufac
ture and expressed domestic requirements of each State.
VIII. Each State shall furnish the Committee with a complete statement in advance
of its estimated annual production and requirements of opium and coca leaves and all deriva-
tives and preparations thereof, and at the close of each calendar year shall furnish to the
Committee a complete statement of its imports, exports, production and manufacture for such
year.
IX. Any shipment of opium or coca leaves, or any derivative or preparation of either,
coming within the purview of the International Opium Convention, whose export and import
has not been duly authorised as provided herein, shall be liable to seizure and confiscation by
any State which is a party hereto. No shipments of this character shall be permitted upon
the vessels, railways, or other common carriers under the jurisdiction of the States parties
hereto.
X. In case any State not now mentioned in Appendices 11, 111, IV or V desires to be
included therein, it shall notify and negotiate with the Committee and the other States
mentioned in the Appendix concerned, with a view to concluding an agreement as to its
participation in the manufacture or production involved.
XI. Other drugs alleged to be dangerous may be brought within the scope of this agree-
ment upon the consent of the States which are parties hereto.

Appendix 4.
Draft Treaty submitted by M. Bourgois.
I. Explanatory Note.
The French Government realises the necessity of completing the Opium Convention by
the adoption of new international obligations restricting the use of the narcotics enumerated
in Chapter 111 of the Convention to medical and scientific requirements.
With this object, the Council and the Assembly recommended that the question of limit-
ing the manufacture of these substances and the cultivation of the raw materials for them
should be investigated.
This limitation may be either direct or indirect.
The first system, that of direct limitation, meets with difficulties which would appear
insuperable. To fix a figure for the authorised world output, and another for the proportion
which might be manufactured in each country, would be to base the entire working of an inter-
national convention on two inconsistent foundations ; for the first of these figures is reliable,
and the second is to a great extent arbitrary.
It was only possible to establish the figure of 600 millligrammes of opium per head of popm
lation, put forward by experts as representing the world requirements, by methods which the
experts themselves were the first to recognise as unreliable ; indeed, they subsequently, in a
purely arbitrary manner, reduced the figure to 450 milligrammes.
The second figure the proportion to be allotted to each manufacturing country is
immensely more difficult to determine. It is clear from the latest official statistics that the
output of the manufacturing countries varies very considerably from year to year. Thus in
the United .States of America, the output of morphine decreased by nearly a half (from 8,000
kilogrammes to 5,000 kilogrammes) from 1921 to 1922, as did that of cocaine (from 2,300
kilogrammes to 1,650 kilogrammes) ; the Japanese production of morphine decreased by
over a half (from 5,000 to 2,000 kilogrammes), and that of heroin by more than four-fifths
(from 2,883 kilogrammes to only 653 kilogrammes). On the other hand, during the same
twelve months, the British output of narcotics doubled or nearly trebled, increasing from
4,189 to 8,939 kilogrammes of morphine and from 344 to 897 kilogrammes of heroin.
These statistics are convincing. They demonstrate that trade requires a considerable
margin, in order to form reserves for the contingencies of bad harvests, epidemics, fluctuating
demand, etc. The existence of this large margin seems inconsistent with the fixing of an annual
proportion for the manufacturing countries. This quota must be capable of constant revision.
The Governments of manufacturing countries should undertake to compel their manufacturers
to consent to any sudden reduction of manufacture which might be necessary, in order to allow
any country which decided to begin manufacture for the purpose of its own internal consump-
tion, and even for the purpose of entering the foreign trade, to take its place with the other
manufacturing countries.
What are the principles which should guide the preparation of the proposed Convention ?
In the first place, the Convention must be one thoroughly acceptable to all Governments,
for if only three or four countries refused to adhere, it would be entirely deprived of its efficacy ;
the industries in question would transfer themselves to these countries and would thus escape
international control.
The future Convention must therefore be based on the principle of equality. It is essential
that it should not result in perpetuating legally the advantageous situation of the present pro-
ducing, manufacturing and trading countries by placing them for the future practically beyond
the reach of competition. Any measures which would hamper free and fair competition
on a footing of equality any suggestion of confirming monopolies and privileges would make
the consuming countries feel that they were being exploited would impel them to cultivate
and manufacture themselves, and would so tend to create new sources of production and, indirectly,
encourage smuggling. The idea of the system of boycotting as a means of putting pressure on
countries which did not adhere to the Convention would of course lead to the same result
a parallel development of cultivation and manufacture in the two groups which would be thus
placed in opposition and driven to become self-supporting. Moreover, it must not be forgotten
that no effective direct control of the cultivation and export of the raw material from cultivat-
ing countries is at present practicable. In almost all the countries in question, no such control
exists or can be set up for a considerable time to come.
*
* *
Any system of direct limitation would violate all these principles. On the other hand,
the system of indirect limitation would remove every one of the difficulties mentioned.
?Such indirect limitation could be brought about by the establishment of strict control,
both national and international, of the persons who manufacture, import, sell, distribute or
forward the drugs, of the buildings in which these persons carry on their industry or trade, and
of the materials they employ, which should be submitted to meticulous supervision, to be con-
tinued from the time of their first appearance until they are finally consumed, and to extend not
only to their movements in the interior of a country but also to the international traffic.


Just as it has been possible to organise effectively the control of national trade in drugs
in many countries by the adoption of legislative measures, so the control of the international
trade, the only source of smuggling in these countries, can be effectively organised by the adop-
tion of international measures of a similar nature to the national measures (these should cover
notably free ports, transit, warehousing, etc.).
The authors of The Hague Convention ? in many respects a most remarkable document ?
had indeed contemplated the introduction of such a control, but being chiefly concerned with
the pressing problem of prepared opium, they merely outlined the measures to be taken. The
relevant articles of Chapter III -? i.e., Articles 10, 12 and 13, which lay down measures for the
supervision of persons and buildings and for the control of manufacture, imports, sale, distribu-
tion and export of drugs ? are not of an imperative character. They simply lay down that
?the Contracting Powers shall use their best endeavours to control shall use their
best endeavours to restrict shall use their best endeavours to adopt ?
The measures contemplated are not only optional but indefinite ; ?to obtain information
respecting the establishment and premises shall use their best endeavours to adopt
measures to ensuie that morphine. . . etc. . . shall not be exported except when consigned to
persons furnished with licences or permits. . . ? (without specifying what form these measures
should take), etc. Finally, they make no provision for a whole series of operations which give
peculiar facilities for smuggling, such as transhipments, warehousing, transit through free
ports and free zones, or deliveries by post.
It is not surprising, therefore, that the meshes of the net have proved too wide. They need
to be drawn closer. Provisions which formerly were optional must be made binding ; the
measures contemplated in the first Convention must be more closely defined and amplified.
A large field is thus open before us and our work may produce a rich harvest.
. appears indeed that the Netherlands Government shares this view, since, in its ?Obser-
vations on the Second Opium Conference?, it writes as follows :
If the Opium Convention and the system of import certificates or some similar
system were generally or effectively put in force, the abuses would be satisfactorily
checked, and it would no longer be necessary to take measures to limit the production
and manufacture.?
This three-fold control of persons, buildings and materials could be effected in the following
manner :
1. By making it absolutely compulsory for persons furnished with licences to make decla-
rations.
2. By having special registers kept up for all these operations and carefully inspected by
the authorities.
3 ? By providing for the inspection of establishments and of registers.
4. By compulsory labelling of envelopes and receptacles containing these substances.
This measures is of great importance in tracing the illicit traffic at its source.
5- By introducing a system of "acquit a caution? in connection with imports.
6. By requiring export licences or permits to be prepared in duplicate, one copy being
attached to the manifest or way-bill till it reaches its final destination bearing a detailed
record of all the movements at each port of transhipment, and the second copy being for-
warded to the Government of the importing country. This system, which in no way
hampers wholesale trade, offers far better guarantees than the import certificate, which is both
vexatious and ineffective.
7 ? By framing measures to deal with transhipment, warehousing, and transit through
free ports.
The Hague Convention laid down nothing on this subject. This grave omission is one of
the chief causes of the present smuggling for which these operations afford numerous oppor-
tunities.
8. By framing measures to deal with postal packets. These measures are all the more
necessary because, owing to the nature of these drugs, it is possible for a considerable trade
to be carried on through the post.
9 ? By the exchange of information between the authorities of the State and the diplo-
matic and consular representatives.
10. By incieasing the penalties. The importance of this point can hardly be exaggerated.
One kilogramme of morphine represents 100,000 injections of 1 eg. The bulk of the drugs is so
insignificant and the profits of the illicit trade are so enormous that it would be utterly futile
to expect that any text, no matter how carefully drawn, would be wholly successful in prevent-
vas^ons - The s . ures f an< 3 easiest method of suppressing this evil is to expose the traders to
the disgrace of imprisonment, to hamper their traffic by prohibitions of residence and to keep
them always in danger of exceptional penalties. It is by such measures, energetically applied
that decisive results have been obtained in France.
11 ? By granting facilities for prosecutions for offences committed in various countries.
12. By extending the provisions to include coca leaves.
*3 ? By extending the measures to include synthetic cocaine.


his careful system of national and international control would be highly effective because
it would make it possible to keep in close touch with every parcel of goods from its first appear-
ance until its final consumption, not only during its movements in the interior of a country
but during all its movements from one country to another. It is a system which all Powers
would be willing to accept, because it serves the interests of all without perpetuating existing
advantages and without establishing any privilege, monopoly, arbitrary rationing, boycott
01 blockade, and without setting interests in opposition to one another. As it would not give
the consuming countries the sense of being exploited, it would not encourage them to create
new sources of production which would inevitably, by an indirect process, become so many new
sources of smuggling. y
It would be impossible for even the smallest amount of smuggled goods to pass through
the narrow meshes of such a net. We should thus obtain automatically, by the free play of the
natural laws of commerce, the three-fold restriction contemplated by the resolutions of the
Council and the Assembly in which the Governments were invited to a Conference i.e. the
manufacture of drugs, and the cultivation and export of their raw materials would be restricted
exclusively to medical and scientific requirements. It is upon these principles that the draft
Convention which is annexed hereto has been based.'

tured, distributed, sold or exported of morphine, cocaine and their respective salts.
(d) To ensure by means of inspections that the provisions laid down in paragraphs
( b ) and (c) above are carried out.
Article 1 bis.
The High Contracting Parties undertake to require that all persons (other than manufac-
turers) who import, sell, distribute or export morphine, cocaine and their respective salts shall
be furnished with a licence or permit to engage in these operations. Such persons shall enter
in their books all imports, sales, transfers and exports of morphine, cocaine and their respective
salts.


The High Contracting Parties shall take measures to prohibit, as regards their internal
trade, the delivery of morphine, cocaine and their respective salts to unauthorised persons,
unless regulations on the subject are already in existence.
Article 2
The substances referred to in Article 14 of the Convention of 1912, with the addition of
raw opium, may not be transferred from place to place, imported or exported, no matter what
may be the weight of the consignment, unless the envelopes or receptacles in which they are
contained are marked with a description of the product, the amount, and the names and
addresses of the consignors and consignees.
Article 3.
The High Contracting Parties shall require persons who are authorised to import the sub-
stances referred to in Article 14 of the Convention of 1912, or to import raw opium and coca
leaves, to obtain, an ?acquit a caution? from the Customs office at the point of entry, stating
the amounts of these products imported and the names and addresses of the consignees. These
?acquits a caution? shall, after being furnished with a discharge certificate by the competent
authorities at the place of destination, be handed back within a fixed period to the Customs
office which issued them.
Article 4.
The High Contracting Parties shall require that persons authorised to export the substances
referred to in Article 14 of the Convention of 1912, or to export raw opium and coca leaves, to
obtain from the Customs office at the place of exit an export certificate or licence, stating the
nature and amounts of these products, the names and addresses of the consignors and con-
signees, the marks and the numbers on the packets.
This certificate shall be drawn up in duplicate. One copy shall be annexed to the
way-bill or manifest of the vessel until it reaches its final destination. The transhipments,
movements, and inspections to which each packet has been subjected shall be recorded on this
certificate. The duplicate copy shall be forwarded by the Customs administration to the diplo-
matic agent of the country of destination accredited to the Government of the despatching
country.
The bills of lading or way-bills shall be made out to ?persons designated by name?.
Declarations shall be required in respect of transhipments from one port to another within
the same country, or from one means of transport to another within the same country.
Article 5.
The High Contracting Parties undertake to prohibit the warehousing, even in the free
ports and zones of their territories, of the products referred to in the preceding article of the
present Convention, unless they have been warehoused by duly authorised persons. These
persons shall be responsible to the Government of the country in which the products are
warehoused for any importation of these products into or exportation from the territory of
the said country.
With this object in view, products introduced into the national territory shall be subject
to the provisions of Article 3 of the present Convention and products exported shall be subject
to the provisions of Article 4.
In order to ensure the carrying out of the present Article, it shall be strictly forbidden, on
pain of the penalties laid down in Article 7, to store such products in free warehouses.
Article 6.
Consignments sent as international postal packets and packets or parcels sent through the
post shall be subject to the same formalities as other consignments.
Article 7.
Any of the substances referred to in Article 14 of the Convention of 1912 and any quantity
of raw opium found in the possession of an unauthorised person may be seized. The possessors
of such products shall be liable to imprisonment or to exemplary fines ; both these penalties
may be awarded in conjunction.
The same penalties shall be imposed on persons who, in contravention of the provisions of
Articles 3, 4 and 5 of the present Convention, shall have imported, exported, or warehoused,
or attempted to import, export or warehouse, any of the products referred to in the preceding
paragraph, or who shall have assisted in the import, export, or warehousing of these products.

Draft Convention on Opium, Proposals by M. Bourgois, regarding Statistics.
M. Bourgois proposes to append to the Convention the following special Protocol to be
signed at the same time as the Convention :
??The High Contracting Parties, being desirous of providing more fully for the execution
of Article 21 (paragraph b) of the Hague Convention of 1912 concerning the communication
of statistical information in regard to the traffic in raw opium, morphine, cocaine and their
respective salts and in the other drugs, salts or preparations referred to in the said Convention.
?Undertake to communicate to each other this information in as great detail as possible,
through the permanent Secretariat of the League of Nations, and to use their best endeavours
to indicate the ultimate destination of the different products in these statistics.?
Appendix 5
Note by M. Henri Brenier on a system of Control with Indirect Limitative Effects.
The mandate entrusted by the Council to the Committee is to prepare a series of agree-
ments with a view to the limitation of the production of morphine, heroin, cocaine and the
raw materials which have to be exported for the manufacture of these drugs.
Limitation of production : Such is the essential aim. It is possible to differ as to the means
to achieve this aim ; all that matters is that it should be achieved in the best possible way.
The system of direct limitation raises objections which it is useless to re-state, as they have
been fully presented and discussed at the former sessions. It is sufficient to recall here that,
admitting that the figure of 450 milligrammes of opium per head per annum can be considered
as reasonable (and it will certainly be criticised with some ground), the real difficulty will lie
in the apportioning, especially in an apportionment which can he continually revised. Speaking
m m Y capacity of director-general of a chamber of commerce of things which I know by daily
practice, I do not think, in all sincerity, that it will be possible to obtain in advance from amanu-
factuier (or, which comes to the same thing, from the country party to the agreement, on his
account), who will have laid out large sums of money for the equipment of a manufacture
piopoitioned at a given moment to a given market, the engagement to surrender his share of a
legitimate market, merely for the pleasure of admitting a competitor whose country has decided
to manufacture morphine, for instance, for its own needs and for a part of the external market.
The alternative will be that the manufacturers in possession of the markets will refuse to admit
this hypothesis or this reality, when it takes place. Each country, having, by definition,
the right to manufacture for its own needs and, once more, for a certain part to be exported,
will be afraid, if it signs a convention, of being exposed to the discussion of the limitations of
its light when the time comes and to conditions with which it is unacquainted by a consortium
of beati possidentes with full information and well-equipped.
The system of direct limitation appearing to be confronted with obstacles which are prac-
tically insui mountable, can there be realised an indirect limitation by a very strictly organised
national and international control ? The whole purpose of this note is to examine this possi-
bility.
If a system can be organised by which each country will only be able to receive in fact
what it requires for its legitimate medical needs and to export to any other country what this
country leally requires for its own legitimate medical needs (which it must know better than
anyone else, but which may vary), it seems that the optimum will be realised. The practical
consequence would be a limitation, since it is absolutely certain that the actual production
of yaw stuffs and of manufactured drugs is greatly in excess of legitimate requirements ; and
this limitation would not result from an apportionment on an uncertain basis and a necessarilv
aibitiaiy one, but from the working itself of a system which it would be very difficult for any-
one to lefuse to accept, because it will respect "the sovereignty and liberty of each country in
the full measure compatible with the common good in view, i.e., the limitation of an unquestion-
able physical and moral evil.
Let us examine the different cases which can occur.
It must first be recalled, however, that it goes without saying that the good faith of the
contracting parties is presupposed. Without this, no result can ever be reached. A certain
proportion of fraud will doubtless always be inevitable, but it will be reduced to a minimum
compatible, with human imperfection. In addition, this good faith is necessary too for the
success of direct limitation. If it cannot be secured in the easier system that of control with
limitative effects it is still more to be feared that it will be absent from the more difficult
and more complicated system that of direct limitation with apportionment.
First, how a country can receive, and allow the internal circulation of, only what it requires
for its own legitimate medical needs.


A. As to raw stuffs, that is to say, opium and coca leaves and raw cocaine :
(a) Limitation of the number of persons authorised by a central (and not a local)
authority to import the raw stuffs ;
( b ) Precise identification of these persons (names, addresses, etc.)
(c) Special packings for the raw stuffs admitted ;
(d) Limitation of the number of ports or frontier towns by which the raw stuffs
may be admitted and obligatory consignment to special premises (bonded warehouses),
in order that they may be verified or stocked whatever may be the final destination ;
(e) Limitation of the number of towns in the interior in which the raw stuff may be
stocked after import (in the same way as the tobacco bonded warehouses in France) ;
(/) Interior circulation only under the regime of permits (?acquit a caution")
with effective money deposit, the permit to be endorsed by the competent authority of the
place where the goods are to be finally stocked, that is to say, by the staff in charge of
the interior bonded warehouses, within a compulsory delay, which must not be too long
(according to the distance from the port of entry).
This would apply also to transport from one interior bonded warehouse to another or
from a bonded warehouse in a port to another bonded warehouse in a port, in view of re-export
or transit.
(g) Supervision and ?exercise? of the interior bonded warehouses ;
(h) Obligatory registration in official forms in order that all the movements of the
merchandise, whatever they may be, shall be recorded, the verification of these registers
to be possible at any moment ;
(i) Limitation of the quantities to be imported for a country?s own needs (manufac-
ture of the three drugs in question, or opium needs of the ordinary pharmaceutical kind,
veterinary and scientific needs).
There is nothing to prevent and it would even be most useful from the point of political
experiment each country, in fixing its requirements, making use of the figures which the
Opium Committee and the Health Committee have reached, or will reach, as constituting a
credible basis for these requirements. But it is quite a different thing to proceed to an experi-
ment of this kind ; it is quite different for a country to apportion itself spontaneously, in gloho
(and even perhaps in detail) in the interior of the country itself on a basis which it has freely
chosen, having in view national public health and generous participation in an international
humanitarian work. To do this is quite a different thing from submitting to the imposition
from outside of an apportionment by interested producers who are in fact in possession of a
quasi monopoly.
Things must be represented as they are.
It will be answered that if things are left to the choice of the different countries, quite a
number of them will not, although anxiety for the public health should lead them to do so,
fix reasonable maximum quantities of raw stuffs to be imported, especially as they will be desir-
ous of participating in a world commerce by export or re-export.
It will be explained in a moment how a country can defend itself against the surplus coming
from an over-stocked country, and what will happen in countries which shall have admitted to
their home markets more opium and coca leaves than they can re-export ;
(j) Limitation of the number and permanent supervision by special officials residing
on the premises (what we call ?exercice? in France), and by inspectors whose visits
must be frequent, of the manufactures of morphine, heroin and cocaine. As a matter of
fact, let it be said in passing, it appears difficult not to submit to the same regime the
manufacture of codeine, but this is a special question. In France, sugar factories and
refineries are ?exerces? and not a single kilogramme of sugar enters or leaves without the
cognisance of the administration. The internal circulation of morphine, heroin' and
cocaine, even if it is destined to pharmaceutical chemists, and every dispatch to another
country, will thus be completely controlled.
As to pharmaceutical chemists receiving raw opium for the preparation of ordinary medi-
cines, their number cannot be limited nor the quantities which they receive. But then
opium will have passed through bonded warehouses on arrival at a specially appointed port
(or frontier town) and can only be re-dispatched under permit. The Government will know
exactly what each has received and all abuses can be repressed, the more so in that the super-
vision will be completed by the obligation of special registration of receipts and sales, vciified
ingpgcGon It is perfectly admissible that pharmaceutical chemists shall not be allowed
to receive raw cocaine. It will only be permissible for them to have in their possession cocaine
coming from ?exerce? manufacturers, as has been explained above. .
In addition, if it is contested that all this supervision is too difficult of organisation, I
would recall that at the present moment France does not cultivate one kilogramme of tobacco
above what is allowed by the Government and that the supervision of the circulation in spirits
is also very strict. The application of the system of direct limitation would, in addition, entail
restrictions, the organisation and putting into force of which would be still more di cult.


It will be said that France and the other big countries are ultra-administered. How can
one hope that measures of the same kind (I mean as effective) can be taken in Turkey, Persia
or Cdiina ?
But, as a consequence of strict control organised by centralised countries, resulting from
an agreement between themselves on identical bases which must be accepted by everyone,
the production will be limited in less centralised countries with a different mentality. Let us
suppose that the seven large countries actually producing the manufactured drugs : Germany,
the United States, France, Great Britain, Japan, the Netherlands and Switzerland, should come
to an agreement on a strict system of national and international control, in a sincere desire to
co-operate with a view to remedying an unquestionable evil ?is it thought that the countries
producing raw stuffs will be able to flood them against their will ?
The countries producing the raw stuffs, it will be said, will supply other countries than the
seven above mentioned, or they will start manufacturing themselves. But, first, the equipment
of a factory, if it is to be an economic success, is not an easy thing. How many manufacturers
of heroin, morphine and cocaine are there at the present time in the whole world ? Besides,
one must start from the hypothesis that everybody will undertake to introduce measures of
effective control which will have been agreed upon, and that the League of Nations will super-
vise the application of the conventions. If some countries refused to accept even measures
of control it would be another matter, but those countries would a fortiori, be still more opposed
to an apportionment. What I have just been saying relates only to countries which are not so
well equipped for effective control as large countries with modern administration. It will be
for the fittest to defend themselves against the abuses of the less fit, and the latter, failing an
outlet, will be obliged to fall into line after a short period. Let us, then, revert to the demon-
stration that a system can be organised in virtue of which a country will only be able to receive
the quantities of the raw stuffs and drugs in question which correspond to its legitimate medical
needs. The demonstration has just been made in regard to raw stuffs (opium and the coca
leaf 1 ). Let me add, however, one more measure. Suppose that France has decided, all told,
that it needs 20,000 kg. I take any figure ?of opium. The central administration (I am
still sepaking of France) will be kept informed every day of all the arrivals in the ports of a
limited quantity for persons and destinations equally limited and perfectly known. When the
total of the imports shall have reached, say, 16,000 kg.-:
1. The specially authorised importers (whose individual imports at the time of the warn-
ing the administration will always know) will be warned that they may not import for the
current year more than the remainder which will be fixed for the rest of the year, in proportion
to what they have already imported, or in any other equitable manner.
2. The bonded warehouses in the ports (or frontier towns) where imports are authorised
will also be warned by the central Government of the quantities they may still receive, by a
proportionate quota of the kind which has just been explained.
3 ? Any quantity arriving in a port for an authorised consignee, in excess of what remains
due to him of his total annual quota, will be held at his disposal for the following year and kept
without his being obliged to pay any dues in the bonded warehouse. This gratuity is justified
by the fact that the order has been given by the interested party before he knew his quota for
the current year had been reached.
This only applies to manufacturers transforming raw stuffs. Pharmaceutical chemists
whose profession is regulated, or should be, in all countries will have to sustain the stoppage
of the imports of raw opium to be used in ordinary medicines. But the port bonded ware-
houses, which will always have an excess of raw stuffs, will be authorised to provide towns in the
interior where the pharmaceutical chemists have an insufficient quantity of raw opium, if this
raw opium is really required by them. Nothing can prevent a State administration from ensur-
ing this necessary margin (?volant?'). Let it be said in passing that it may even be questioned
whether a State monopoly of the introduction of the raw stuffs would not be the simplest, the
easiest and most effective solution.
B. Manufactured drugs coming from abroad (morphine, heroin, cocaine).
It has just been shown a State can follow exactly with the reservation, naturally,
of contraband, which is always possible but which will be more and more closely followed up
any quantity of opium, coca leaves or raw cocaine entering a country or circulating in a
country, so that no single package can escape and so that, consequently, the imported or cir-
culating quantities shall not exceed the legitimate medical and scientific needs. In regard to
the three drugs (morphine, heroin and cocaine) and any other drugs it may become necessary
to control coming fiom abroad, identical measures can be taken with the same result. The
difficulty will be gicatei because . first, dissimulation will be easier, since the articles are smallerj
secondly, the number of the consignees (pharmaceutical chemists alone ) is larger. But, leaving
as . l( p e once more contraband, if the same series of formalities and controls is applied, the aim
5? achieved. There remains the special question of postal packages, which is much more
difficult to deal with and for which special international measures will have to be taken, but
these measures are possible and they can be adequately effective.
1 As to synthetic cocaine, the result would be obtained by the matriculation and the supervision
and exercice of the chemical manufactures producing it. e


A country, therefore, can, once more, really limit to its own legitimate medical and
scientific needs the quantities of raw stuffs of the three drugs in question which it may
receive and allow to circulate within its frontiers.
But what about exports, including re-exports, which, in a system of simple control and not
of previous apportionment, a country can send to other States ? How can a country be com-
pelled to send to other countries only what they require for their legitimate medical and
scientific needs ? This is the second question.
How a country can he compelled to export to other countries in opium, coca leaves, raw
cocaine, morphine, heroin and cocaine only what corresponds to the legitimate medical and scientific
needs of these countries .
This result can only be obtained by a generalisation of the actual system of impoit certifi-
cates or any other analogous system. This system can be defined in a word.
All the signatory Powers will have explicitly to undertake not to allow any export for
abroad from the bonded warehouses in the ports or frontier towns, through which any raw
stuffs or drugs will always have to pass before export, except when an official certificate has
been shown from the country of destination stipulating that a specified and named quantity
of the aforesaid may be imported by such-and-such a known consignee.
Evidently, this is the basis which nothing can replace ; but, if the organisation of the con-
trol in the country of destination is well conceived, this country will only receive what it really
needs, as has been seen. The essential aim of the preoccupation of public international health
and morality which inspires all our work will be achieved. It is not limitation for the theore-
tical pleasure of a limitation on principle that is sought, but limitation to legitimate needs.
Once more, these needs alone will be satisfied by the present scheme.
On the other hand, it is certain that a country which has abused its share in an international
traffic, to the extent to which this traffic is legitimate, by hoarding up with a view to flooding-
other countries the two raw stuffs and the three drugs with which we are dealing, will never
begin to do this again. Those of its nationals who have ?played this little game?? will have
lost too much by it. This natural, direct and pecuniary penalty is far preferable to a boycott.
I can only very shortly point out at the end of this note, which is already too long (but
which was drafted in great haste and in peculiar circumstances, in an insufficient form),
some of the complementary measures which are none the less essential and which will have
to find their place in the international agreement.
i. The High Contracting Parties will have to bind themselves to publish, within a delay
which will have to be specified, legislative and administrative measures on the basis which
will have been agreed upon. They will have to bind themselves to communicate these measures
in their entirety to one another in a certain number of copies at the same time as they will
be centralised by the League of Nations. The same rule will have to apply to any modification
of these laws or enactments.
2. The League of Nations will have the right to be informed by annual reports of the
measures taken and of the results obtained.
3. Penal sanctions of a severe character, and as far as possible identical, or in any case
analogous, will have to be provided for. Statistics of legal prosecutions will have to be mutually
communicated and sent to the League of Nations. The more important cases of contraband
will have to be notified immediately, with all useful details, to the Government or Governments
interested and to the League of Nations.
4. Ihe future Convention will have to contain precise stipulations on the form of the
statistics to be supplied and the period within which they must be forwarded.
It will be necessary, among other things, that the Convention should specify that the
interior Customs statistics of each country will have to take a special form for the drugs in
question without waiting for each country to proceed itself to a complete revision of its
system of statistics. This is a special question which can be solved apait from the rest. In
this respect, the report by Mr. Chapman, submitted in 1923, to the Sub-Committee over
which I had the honour of presiding, can be utilised profitably.
5 . It will be necessary to come to a special agreement with the International Parcels Post
Bureau in Berne on the subject of the circulation and control of parcels post.
6. It will also be indispensable to provide special regulations for transport by sea, river,
canal, land and by air. Special obligations will have, to be imposed on transporters (shipping
companies, railways, automobile companies and air services).
7. It will be indispensable to revise any existing international convention on the subject
of transit, so as to exclude the raw stuffs and drugs covered by the Convention, except under
the guarantees which will have been agreed upon.
By these measures of simple control, but of a total and effective control, if there is added
the good faith which must always be supposed and the patience which is necessary in any human
enterprise, especially when pecuniary interests and morals are equally involved, the end we all
have in view will certainly be achieved.

Appendix 6.
Observations by the Netherlands Government with reference to the Second Opium
Conference, November, 1924.
The object of the Opium Conference which will open on November 17th, 1924, is to limit
to the quantities required for medical and scientific purposes .
[a) The quantities of morphine, heroin, cocaine and their respective salts which
may be manufactured ;
{b) The quantities of raw opium and coca leaves which may be imported for that
purpose
(c) The output of raw opium and coca leaves for export.
The Royal Government considers that the limitation of manufacture or production, as
proposed by the Conference, can only be successful if all countries in which such manufactuie
or production takes place accept the proposed regulations, if other countries undertake not
to commence such manufacture or production, and if control is effectually exercised in all ?
countries. . , , .
In view of the fact that certain of the principal opium manufacturing countries have not
yet adhered to the Opium Convention and that very few countries have as yet adopted the
import certificate system, it seems improbable that the foregoing conditions will be fulfilled
in the immediate future. ......
On the other hand, the Government thinks that the general and effectual putting into
force of the Opium Convention and the import certificate system, or some other similar system,
would be an adequate measure against the abuse of opium, and the limitation of production
and manufacture would no longer be necessary C ... ..
In this connection, the Government would point out that any such limitation would inevit-
ably involve a rise in prices on the lawful, no less than on the illicit, market, with the result
of restricting the use of narcotics for medical purposes.
If, however, it is proposed to consider the possibility of limiting production and manufac-
ture, the Government ventures to suggest that attention should first be directed to coca, and
thatit might afterwards be considered whether the proposed measures would also be applicable
to opium. . - , ? ... ~
This appears to be the best procedure, because limitation would be less difficult in the case
of coca than in the case of opium, inasmuch as the poppy can be cultivated in all climates, and
is actually cultivated in a number of countries in which effectual control is impossible. Coca,
on the other hand, is only produced in a few areas.
Although it cannot be definitely laid down that the production of coca would be quite
impossible in any non-tropical country, there is no doubt that coca cannot be produced in
every climate. Those countries, however, whose climate is not definitely unfavourable to
the cultivation of coca, but which do not at present cultivate it, should undertake not to do so
in the future. . . _ . .
The Royal Government is of opinion that it would be well to consider, in the first place,
whether the best means of attaining the object in view would not be to establish a syndicate
under effective control. .
Should any serious objection be raised to this suggestion, the Netherlands Government
thinks that the limitation of the production of the coca leaf should be considered ; for it is
obvious that restrictive measures would be more effectual if directed against raw materials
of large bulk and small value than against manufactured products of small bulk and large value,
which are often produced by complicated processes.
The first necessity will be to determine the area at present under cultivation. On the
basis of data furnished principally by the League of Nations, the Netherlands Government
has compiled the following summary of coca cultivation.
The world consumption of cocaine in 1910 has been estimated at from 13,000 to 15,000
kilogrammes (15,000 kgs, being approximately equal to 500,000 ounces) ; in the years following
1910, the consumption would appear to have diminished.
Coca has always been cultivated in Peru and Bolivia. Its cultivation has also been intro-
duced into Java, Ceylon, and Formosa 2 . In Formosa, the cultivation of coca is only in its
infancy (the area under cultivation is 201 hectares), and in Ceylon, it is inconsiderable ; the
only countries which produce large quantities, therefore, are Peru, Bolivia and Java.
" If it is correct that Bolivia does not export either coca leaves or raw cocaine, and if we
disregard the output of Japan and Ceylon, it follows that Peru and Java produce the coca leaves
which form the raw material for all the cocaine manufactured in the world. In this connection,
1 Compare the results obtained in Italy (Minutes of the ordinary session of the Permanent Committee
of the Office international d?Hygiene publique, October 1923, page 32) and in the United States ( Phar-
raaceutish Weekblad ?, 1924, No. 4, page 83, which contains a summary of an article by Colonel L. G.
Nutt, published in ?Drug and Chamical Markets, January 2nd, 1924, page 9.
2 The cultivation of coca in Mungpoc, Jamaica, Zanzibar, the Cameroons, Gabun, St. Thome and
Brisbane, mentioned by Hartwig in ?die Monschliohen Genusmittel?, and in the Straits Settlement is
purely experimental and has at present no importance in connection with the question under consideration.

there is an important difference between the two countries : cocaine can be extracted direct
from the South American coca ; Java coca merely yields ecgonin, from which cocaine can
be manufactured synthetically. Consequently, Java coca is not used as a stimulant by the
natives. In Java, where the area under cultivation in 1922 was about 1,400 hectares, the coca
leaf is cultivated purely for export, whereas in Peru almost the entire output of the coca leaf
(the figures are unknown) is consumed by the people of the country, who chew the leaves
mixed with chalk.
The following table which is based, in the case of the Netherlands, partly on unofficial
data shows the quantities of coca leaves which were available for export in 1920, 1921,
and 1922 and the quantities of cocaine which they would yield. It has been assumed that the
coca leaf has a raw cocaine content of 0.8 per cent of the original weight, and that raw cocaine
yields 75 per cent cocaine.

In this table, however, the percentages taken are probably incorrect ; it appears from
Annex V of the Minutes of the Fifth Session of the Advisory Committee on Opium (C. 418.
M. 184, 1923, page 154) that the quantity manufactured in Japan alone was as much as 2,324
kilogrammes in 1921 and 3,680 kilogrammes in 1922.
The Peruvian coca leaf was exported piincipally to the United States, Great Britain and
Iquique (Chile) ; the cocaine was exported to the United States, Germany and Japan. No
cocaine salts or other than raw cocaine are manufactured in Peru.
The coca leaf produced in the Dutch Indies was exported principally to the Netherlands :
A large propoition of the coca leaf imported into the Netherlands is re-exported chiefly
to Germany, but also to France, Switzerland and America.
The first condition for securing an effective limitation of production is that all countries
should adhere to the Opium Convention and should accept the import certificate system.
Countries will also have to undertake to communicate without delay all data relating to the
area under coca cultivation and to imports and exports (including consignments by parcel
post), with a view to facilitating mutual control. It will also be necessary to ensure that coun-
tries which do not at present cultivate coca do not undertake its cultivation in the future.
The problem might be more easily solved if coca cultivation could be stopped in Formosa,
Ceylon and the other districts in which it is as yet in its infancy. Its suppression in those places
might prove necessary in view of the fact that the cultivation in other countries will have to
be reduced to a much greater degree.
We shall then have to consider whether the cultivation of coca leaves for home consump-
tion in Peru and Bolivia should be left unregulated, and, if so, whether the secret exportation
of the coca leaf and of raw cocaine could be prevented a much more difficult question.
An attempt must be made to establish an equitable proportion for the allocation between
producing countries of the quantity of coca leaf to be employed in the manufacture of cocaine.
In view of the varying cocaine content of the coca leaf in different countries, and in different
harvests in the same country, this proportion must be based not only on the quantity of coca
leaf but also on its cocaine content.
Care will have to be taken that notwithstanding the restrictive measures which may be
taken in the cultivation of the coca leaf, the world market remains sufficiently profitable
for production to be maintained. Moreover, should cultivation be limited to certain countries,
measures will have to be considered for ensuring a sufficient supply for the medical needs of
the different countries in-time of war.
It is generally agreed that the quantity of cocaine at present available is much too large
for the medical and scientific needs of the whole world. Nevertheless, great prudence will
have to be exercised in imposing restrictions, so as to permit of due consideration of various
consequences of restriction. Prudence is especially necessary, inasmuch as the exact figures
of production and of the quantities required for medical purposes are not known.
Measures will have to be devised to prevent illicit trade from getting hold of the cocaine
intended for medical use, and to ensure that it will always be possible to obtain cocaine for
legitimate purposes at a reasonable price. It will therefore be necessary to make provision
for the possibility of a bad crop, and for an increase in the legitimate needs of Eastern countries,
in which the employment of European remedies is constantly becoming more frequent.
It should not be forgotten that a proportional restriction of cultivation in the various coun-
tries would not produce the desired result, first, because an extensive cultivation is needed
in Peru for internal consumption, and, secondly, because the yield does not depend solely
on the area under cultivation, but also on the intensiveness of the harvesting process.


Control of exports will therefore be a sine qua non. In the case of Java, such conti ol will
be easy, as cocaine leaves are always exported in large quantities, and no raw cocaine is exported
from the Island. Control will be much more difficult in cases like that of Peru, in which
exports take the form of raw cocaine, which has very small bulk.
Lastly, it will have to be realised that cocaine can be manufactured synthetically, indepen-
dently of the coca leaf. Should industry and commerce find it to their interest to adopt this
process all measures tending to restrict the cultivation of the coca leaf will probably become
useless. In this eventuality, no control could be exercised over the importation of raw pro-
ducts, and clandestine manufacture which is quite out of the question with Java coca
would be greatly facilitated while control of the illicit trade would be severely handicapped.
Appendix 7.
Meeting of the Fifth Session of the Opium Advisory Committee in May 1923.
Resolution 11.
The Advisory Committee, having regard to the large amount of detailed information
now available, recommends the Council to invite the Powers with Far Eastern territories,
where the use of opium for smoking is temporarily continued in pursuance of Chapter II of the
Opium Convention, to enter into immediate negotiations, by means of calling a special confer-
ence of representatives of these Governments, or othervise, to consider what measures should
be taken to give a more effective application to Chapter II of the Convention and to bring
about a reduction of the amount of opium used, and whether, on the lines of the suggestions
set out below or on other lines, an agreement or understanding could not now be reached for
the adoption of a uniform policy on the matter :
I. That the farm system, where it is still in operation, should be abolished, and that
the opium business should be made a Government monopoly and kept entirely in the
hands of the Government.
11. As a corollary of paragraph I, that the retail sale of prepared opium should be
made only from Government shops, and that all private shops should be abolished. Per-
sons in charge of Government shops should be paid a fixed salary without any commission
on the amount of business done, and therefore would have no temptation to push the sales.
111. That a uniform maximum limit should be fixed for the amount of prepared
opium placed on sale for consumption, calculated according to the number of the adult
Chinese male population, e.g.x. taels per 10,000 adult Chinese males in the territory,
and that the annual imports of raw opium should be limited to the amount required for
that rate of consumption.
IV. That the possibilities of the system of registration and licensing, which has
already been introduced in some of the Far Eastern territories, should be thoroughly
explored.
V. That the possibility should be considered of making uniform, so far as circum
stances permit ;
(a) The price at which prepared opium is retailed in the different territories, and;
( h ) The penalties for infraction of the law in regard to the import, export, sale
and use of prepared opium.
VI. That the interested Powers, that is. the Powers having territories in the Far
East where the consumption of prepared opium is still permitted, should conclude an
agreement among themselves to apply the foregoing measures for the purpose of carrying
out Chapter II of the Convention.
VII. That the position should be generally reviewed periodically by the Powers
interested and the question of further reducing the maximum limit fixed in the agreement
should be considered.

Geneva, August 16th, 1924.
MEASURES SUGGESTED BY THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE AS A BASIS FOR THE
DELIBERATIONS OF THE SECOND CONFERENCE, NOVEMBER 1924.
Part I
i* That each country shall furnish an estimate of its annual import requirements for
medical and scientific purposes, whether for domestic consumption, manufacture or commerce
of '
(a) Raw opium.
(b) Coca leaves.
(c) Morphine, its salts, and preparations containing morphine.
(d) Heroin, its salts, and preparations containing heroin.
(e) Cocaine, its salts, and preparations containing cocaine.
2. Each Government undertakes to refuse to authorise the importation into its territory
of any of the substances mentioned in Article 1 beyond the quantities specified in the estimates
furnished by it in pursuance of Article 1. The foregoing provision shall not prevent the Govern-
ment of a country, in which the use of opium for smoking purposes is still temporarily permitted
under Chapter 2 of the Hague Convention, from authorising the importation of raw opium, in
conformity with the provisions of Chapter 2 of the Convention, until such time as the use of
opium for smoking purposes shall have been definitely prohibited.
3 . A permanent Central Board, composed of experts, shall be constituted by the Council
of the League on the advice of the Opium Advisory Committee.
4. The Governments agree to send to the Central Board :
(a) Their estimates of their annual import requirements in pursuance of Article 1.
(b) Within three months after the end of each quarter, statistics of their im-
ports from each country and of their exports or re-exports to each country during
that quarter and, within three months after the end of each half-year, statistics of
their manufactures during that half-year and, if possible, the stocks in?the hands of
the wholesale dealers at the end of the half-year, of each of the substances mentioned
in Article 1.
(c) Within three months after the end of each year, the total quantity of each of
the substances mentioned in Article 1, consumed as such in the country during the
The Central Board will communicate periodically to all Governments the position as regards
the exports and re-exports to each country.
Should it appear that the imports of any of the substances mentioned in Article 1 already
received in any country during the current year have exceeded the amounts specified in the
estimate furnished by that country, the Central Board shall call the attention of the Govern-
ments specially to the fact. Each Government undertakes not to export any further consign-
ment of the substance in question to the said country during the same year, unless a revised
estimate of its requirements shall have been furnished by the country.
5 . If any country furnishes no estimate of its requirements in pursuance of Article lor
furnishes an estimate which appears to the Central Board to be greatly in excess of the reason-
able requirements of the country and to be likely to be used in part for the illicit traffic, the
Board shall fix the amounts of the reasonable requirements of that country after taking into
account its population, climatic and hygienic conditions and all other factors which appear to
the Board to be relevant, as well as any other special circumstances which the said country will
be at liberty to submit to the Board. The Board shall notify the amount so fixed to all
Governments. Each Government agrees not to allow the export to that country of amounts
which, taken in conjunction with the exports from other countries, will exceed the amounts
fixed by the Board.
6. If any Government of any country which has commercial relations, in the matter of
the substances mentioned in Article 1, with a country for which an amount has been fixed by the
Board in pursuance of Article 5 or Article 7, paragraph XIII, considers that it is undesirable
to limit exports to the latter country to the amount so fixed, it shall have the right to demand
that a special conference of all the countries which have such relations with the said country
shall be summoned to consider whether such limitation or any other measure should be put
into force.


Part 11.
7 . The provisions of the Hague Convention of 1912 shall be amended as follows :
(I) Article 2 shall be extended to apply to coca leaves.
(II) The following article (numbered 2 bis) shall be added to the Convention .
?Each Contracting Power shall require that a separate import licence must be
obtained for each importation of raw opium or coca leaves. The licence may allow
the importation of the amount for which the licence is given in one or more consign-
ments within a period to be specified in the licence.
(Ill) Article 3 shall be replaced by the following article ;
?Each Contracting Power shall require that a separate export licence must-be
obtained for each exportation of raw opium or coca leaves. The Po ?
before issuing such licence, shall require an import certificate, issued by the govern
ment of the importing country and certifying that the importation is approved, to b
oroduced bv the person applying for the licence. The licence may allow the expor-
tation of the amounts for which the licence is given in one or more consignments
whhTn a period to be specified in the licence. Unless a copy of the export hcence
accompanies the consignment, the Government issuing the export shall send
a codv to the Government of the importing country. The Government ot tne
importing country, when the importation has been effected, shall return the export
Ikeirce with an endorsement to that effect to the Government of the exporting
?In the case of an application to export a consignment to any country for the
purpose of being placed in a bonded warehouse in that country, the production o
special certificate from the Government of that country, certifying that it has appr -
ved the introduction of the consignment for the said purpose, may be admitted by the
Government of the exporting country in place of the import certificate provide
above.?
(IV) Article 5 shall be omitted.
/y\ The definition of cocaine in Chapter 111 shall be modified as follows . By cocaine is
understood the principal alkaloid of the leaves of erythroxylon coca having the . 7,
H2i,NO4, whether extracted from the leaves of erythroxylon coca or produced by chemical
synthesis.? (Ecgonine also to be included ?)
mT\ Tn Article 10 the words ?The Contracting Powers shall control? shall be substituted
for ?tie Contr" Powers shall use their best endeavours to control or to cause to be con-
trolled? and the words ?The Contracting Parties shall adopt shall be substituted for The
Contracting Powers shall use their best endeavours to adopt or cause to be adopted.
T words ?or shall make to the competent authorities an official declaration that they are
so el^ g h a e g^ ords S ! I ( This not necessarily apply to medical prescriptions and to sales by
duly authorised chemists? shall be omitted.
(VII) Article 12 shall be replaced by the following article ;
?Each Contracting Power shall require that a separate import hcence must be
obtained for each importation of any of the substances of which Chapter 111 applies.
The licence may allow the importation of the amount for which the licence is given in
one or more consignments within a period to be specified in the licence.
(VIII) Article 13 shall be replaced by the following article :
?Each Contracting Power shall require that a separate export licence must be
obtained for each exportation of any of the substances to which Chapter 111 applies.
The Contracting Power, before issuing such licences, shall require an import certificate,
Issued by the Government of the importing country and certifying that the .mporta-
tion is approved, to be produced by the person applying for the hcence. _ .
?The licence may allow the exportation of the amount for which the hcence is gi\ en
in one or more consignments within a period to be specified in the licence.
?Unless a copy of the export licence accompanies the consignment the Govern-
ment issuing the export licence shall send a copy to the Government of the country of
impo ?The o G oVernment of the importing country, when the importation has been
effected, shall return the export licence, with an endorsement to that effect, to the
Government of the exporting country.
?In the case of an application to export a consignment to any country for the
purpose of being placed in a bonded warehouse in that country,
special certificate from the Government of that country, certifyingthat it has.appro-
ved the introduction of the consignment for the said purpose, may be admitted by the
Government of the exporting country in place of the import certificate provided lor
above.?


(IX) For the purpose of ensuring the full application and enforcement of the provisions
of the Hague Convention, as amended by this agreement, in free ports and free zones, the
Governments undertake to apply in free ports and free zones situated within their territories
the same laws and regulations, and to exercise the same supervision and control in respect of the
substances covered by the Convention, as amended by this agreement, as in other parts of
their territories.
(X) In the case of a consignment of any of the substances covered by the Convention as
amended by this agreement exported from one country to another country, which passes
through the territory of a third country without being removed from the ship or conveyance
in which it is being conveyed except for the purpose of being transferred to another conveyance
under the supervision of the authorities of the country of transit, a declaration shall be made
to the authorities of the country of transit of the contents of the consignment and the country
for which it is destined. If no declaration is made or a false declaration is made, the consign-
ment shall be liable to confiscation by the authorities of the country of transit and the person
making such false declaration shall be guilty of an offence.
(XI) No transhipment of a consignment of any of the substances covered by the Con-
vention as amended by this agreement shall be allowed unless the consignment is accompanied
by an official copy of the export licence, issued by the authorities of the country of export, or
by an official copy of the import certificate, issued by the authorities of the importing country.
It shall be made illegal for anyone in the country of transhipment to divert, or attempt to
divert, the consignment to any destination other than that named in the official copy of the
export licence or import certificate above mentioned, without an export licence from the autho-
rities of the country of transhipment.
(XII) A consignment of any of the substances covered by the Convention, as amended by
this agreement, which is landed in any country and placed on a bonded warehouse, shall not
be allowed by the Government of that country to be withdrawn from the bonded warehouse to
be sent out to another country unless an import certificate, issued by the Government of the
country of destination and certifying that the importation is approved, is produced to the
authorities of the former country. A special certificate shall be issued by the Government in
respect of each consignment so withdrawn and shall take the place of the export license for
the purpose of the preceding provisions of this agreement.
(XIII) In the case of a country which is not a party to this agreement, the Governments
undertake not to allow the export to such a country of any of the substances covered by the
Convention as amended by this agreement except such amounts as may be fixed by the Central
Board as being reasonably required for the medical and scientific needs of the country.
Part 111.
The Conference makes the following recommendations :
i. That each Government should forbid any person within its jurisdiction from procuring
or assisting the commission, in any place outside its jurisdiction, of any offence against the
laws in force in such place for controlling or regulating the manufacture, sale, use, export or
import of any of the substances covered by the Convention as amended by this agreement,
and that any person knowingly violating such prohibition shall be liable to punishment.
2. That each Government should forbid the conveyance in any ship sailing under its
flag of any consignment of the substances covered by the Convention as amended by this
agreement ;
(1) Unless an export licence has been issued in respect of such consignment in
accordance with the provisions of the Convention so amended and the consignment is
accompanied by an official copy of such licence ;
(2) To any destination other than the destination mentioned in the licence.

NOTE-EXPLANATORY OF THE PROPOSALS CONTAINED IN DOCUMENT 0.C.216 (5).
The measures suggested as a basis for discussion consist of two parts. The first part consist-
ing of Articles 1 to 6 contains a scheme the object of which is to limit the exports and imports
of the drugs and of the raw materials from which they are manufactured to the amounts required
for medical and scientific purposes. It has not been thought necessary at the present stage
to work out the scheme in full detail, but the essential features are set out in Articles 1 to 6,
and Article 7, paragraph XIII. Each country which becomes a party to the agreement will


prepare at, or shortly before, the commencement of each calendar year an estimate of the
amounts of each of the raw materials or of the manufactured drugs which it will require to
import during the year :
[a) For consumption in the country for medical and scientific purposes ;
\b) For the manufacture of the drugs or of other medical preparations ;
(c) For the export trade.
Each country will undertake that it will not import more of the raw materials or of the
manufactured drugs than it specifies in its estimates.
The estimates will be sent to a Central Board established in the manner proposed in the
scheme.
The Governments will also send periodically to the Central Board statistics of their
imports and exports, their manufactures, and their consumption of the raw materials and of
the drugs.
These statistics will enable the Central Board to follow the course of the international traffic,
so that whenever it appears that the exports to or imports into any country have exceeded the
amounts of the estimates furnished by that country, it will be in a position to notify the Govern-
ment of that country, and the Governments of other countries, of that fact.
It is intended that the scheme should be worked in as elastic a manner as possible. In the
first place, it is not expected that in the early years it will be possible to give exact estimates.
At first, the estimates will in many cases necessarily be approximate only, and some margin will
have to be allowed for errors in estimation. As experience is gained, the estimates will become
more and more precise. In the second place, the estimates furnished by a Government at the
commencement of a year will not necessarily be the final estimates for the year. If the estimates
should be found by the Government in the course of the year to be insufficient, it will be open
to the Government to furnish revised estimates to the Central Board. Or, again, the production
of the raw materials will vary from year to year according to the state of the crops. In a year
of abundant crops, when prices are low, the manufacturing countries will desire to take advan-
tage of the state of the market and lay in supplies for the future. It will, again, be open to the
Governments of such countries to revise their estimates of the supplies of the raw material
required during the current year, a corresponding reduction being made in the estimates of
the following year.
The experience of the Advisory Committee shows that it has to be anticipated that some
countries will not become parties to the agreement, at any rate, not at first, or that they will
neglect or declare themselves unable to frame any estimates of their requirements. It may be
also that in some cases supplies will be demanded which are greatly in excess of the legitimate
requirements of the country and which might serve to supply the illicit trade in the drugs.
It is therefore provided (Articles 5 and 7, paragraph XIII) that in such cases the Central
Board shall have the power to fix the amounts which are reasonably required for the medical
and scientific needs of the country, after taking into account all proper considerations, such as
population, climate, etc., and any special circumstances which the country in question may
desire to submit to the Board. The amounts so fixed will be notified to all Governments by the
Central Board and the Governments will undertake to limit their exports to that country so
that the amounts fixed by the Board shall not be exceeded. As explained above, Governments
will be informed by the Central Board when the amounts fixed have been reached.
It has been suggested that political considerations may sometimes make it undesirable for
a particular Government or Governments to limit its exports to a country in a case of this kind.
To meet this difficulty, it is provided in the scheme that such a Government or Governments
may ask for a special conference of the countries trading in the drugs with the country in
question to consider whether the limitation should be enforced or some other measures taken.
It will be noticed that Article 1 provides only for estimates of imports being furnished.
Some countries, however, provide themselves with their requirements of the drugs from their
own manufactures, and the estimates furnished in pursuance of Article 1 will, therefore, not
give the total requirements of the amounts needed for medical and scientific purposes. It
is desirable, however, that the total requirements should be known. If the total requirements
of all countries are known, it will be possible to compare the estimates of one country with
those of another and so to reach some kind of standard for countries having similar conditions.
The total amount of the drugs required to be manufactured to meet the world?s medical and
scientific needs, and the total amount of raw materials required to be produced, will also be
known, and this knowledge should help to stabilise the manufacture of and trade in the drugs.
The second part contains a number of provisions designed to strengthen and give greater
precision to the provisions of the Hague Convention, and, in particular, those which relate to
the control over the exports and imports of the substances to which the Convention applies.
Experience during the three years which have elapsed since the Convention came into force
has shown that there are loopholes in the existing provisions by which persons engaged in
illicit traffic can evade the control over the national and international trade in the materials
and drugs which was the object of the Convention, and that a stricter control must be
established if that object is to be secured effectively.
It is accordingly proposed : (1) that a separate licence from the Government shall be
required for each consignment imported or exported ; (2) that an export licence shall only
be issued by the Government of the exporting country on the production of a certificate from
the Government of the importing country that the importation of the consignment is approved
(to avoid unnecessary interference with trade, this certificate can be given on telegraphic
instructions from his Government by a diplomatic or consular officer of the importing country
stationed in the exporting country) ; (3) that a copy of the export licence shall either accom-


pany the consignment or be sent by the Government of the exporting country to the Govern-
ment of the importing country, and that when the importation has been effected this copy shall
be returned, with an endorsement to the effect that the importation has been effected, to the
Government of the exporting country.
The first two of these proposals are already being enforced by many Governments. The
third is intended as a preventive against diversion of the consignment enroute for illicit purposes.
Provisions are also proposed to ensure that materials or drugs which are brought into free
ports or free zones do not escape control and that, transhipment facilities are not utilised for the
purpose of diverting consignments, without authority, to a destination other than that for which
the export licence has been issued. Special arrangements are suggested for safeguarding the
?entrepot? trade as carried on by means of bonded warehouses.
Other proposals are that the coca leaf, which is the raw material of cocaine, shall be brought
within the Convention, and that the definition of cocaine shall be extended to cover artificial
cocaine produced by chemical synthesis.
Finally, the Advisory Committee has appended two recommendations for the consideration
of Governments.
The first of these is based on a provision in the British law which has been found extremely
useful in dealing with illicit traffickers, who, while residing in one country, organise or arrange
for illicit transactions in another country.
The second is intended to meet a very serious difficulty which is caused at present by the
lack of any control over the exports from certain producing countries. Large consignments
of raw opium without any restriction are being exported to the Far East under false decla-
rations of destination for the purposes of the illicit traffic, and are being smuggled into China
and elsewhere. It is accordingly proposed that Governments should exercise a control over
the conveyance of opium or the other materials or drugs in ships sailing under their flag.

The Committee for the Examination of Credentials considers that all the delegates whose
names appear above are duly authorised to represent their countries at the Conference. ic
Committee presumes that, prior to the signature of any Convention or agreement which may
be adopted by the Conference, the delegates not yet in possession of their full powers will
obtain the necessary authorisation to that effect from their Governments.
In so far as concerns the delegation of the Republic of China, His Excellency M. Sze has
informed the Committee for the Examination of Credentials that he has sent a telegram to his
Government requesting that a telegraphic confirmation be sent by his Government to the
Secretary-General of the League of Nations furnishing the delegation with the necessary
plenipotentiary powers.

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON RULES OF PROCEDURE.
The Committee appointed by the Conference to examine and report upon the draft rules
of procedure met to-day and has agreed to report to the Conference as follows :
The delegate of Greece was invited to explain to the Committee the proposal which he
had made at the first meeting of the Conference and, after an exchange of views, expressed
the wish to withdraw it. The Committee was unanimously of opinion that it would create
serious difficulties for the Conference if a unanimous vote of all the countries represented at
the Conference which have ratified the Hague Convention were required for the adoption of
any proposal to amend that Convention. _ .
The Committee also received a suggestion from the United States delegation that provi-
sion should be made in the Rules of Procedure for the appointment of a Committee which
would nominate for the approval of the Conference the members of any Committee which the
Conference might decide to appoint. . , , ,
After consulting the President, and with a view to facilitating the work of the Conference,
the Committee has decided unanimously to recommend to the Conference the appointment of a
Committee of Business, whose function would be ;?????????
In making this proposal, the Committee has followed a precedent which has been adopted
at some other conferences and which has been found to be very useful. It has accordingly
inserted in the Rules of Procedure a provision to this effect.
The Committee has also examined the Rules of Procedure, and has decided to recommend
some minor alterations and now submit them in their revised form for the approval of the
Conference. _

Example : The Contracting Powers Parties.
Considering that the Powers interested in the progressive
suppression of the abuse of opium, morphine, cocaine,
as well as drugs prepared or derived from these substances,
which give rise, or might give rise, to similar abuses
entered into the International Opium Convention of 1912;
Considering the necessity of adopting further measures
in order to hasten the consummation of the aims and objects
of that Convention ;
Considering that the Assembly of the League of Nations,
by resolution No. VIpassed on October 1 8th, 1923, requested
the Council, as a means of giving effect to the principles
submitted by the representatives of the United States of
America, subject to the reservation in regard to prepared
opium made by representatives of France, Germany,
Great Britain, Japan, The Netherlands, Portugal, and
Siam, to invite the Governments concerned to send
representatives with plenipotentiary powers to a conference
for this purpose ;
Considering that the principles submitted by the repre-
sentatives of the United States of America are the following:
1. ?If the purpose of the Hague Opium Convention
is to be achieved according to its spirit and true intent,
it must be recognised that the use of opium products for
other than medicinal and scientific purposes is an abuse
and not legitimate.
* * * Desirous of advancing a step further on the
road opened by the International Commission of
Shanghai of 1909;
Determined to bring about the gradual suppression of
the abuse of opium, morphine and cocaine, as also of the
drugs prepared or derived from these substances, which
give rise or might give rise to similar abuses;
into consideration the necessity and the mutual
advantage of an international agreement on this point;
Convinced that in this humanitarian endeavour they
will meet with the unanimous adherence of all the
States concerned:
Have decided to conclude a convention with this
object, and have appointed as their plenipotentiaries:

LEAGUE OF NATIONS
ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON TRAFFIC IN OPIUM AND OTHER DANGEROUS DRUGS.
Report to the Council on the Work of the Fifth Session
(May 24th to June 7th, 1923).
The Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium and Other Dangerous Drugs has the honour to
submit to the Council of the League the following report on the proceedings at its fifth session,
which was held from May 24th to June 7th, 1923. .
This session has been particularlv important in view of the proposals which were submitted
to the Committee by the delegation of the United States of America and m view of the conclusions
which, as a result of its enquiries and of its previous work, the Committee has unanimously reached
for the establishment of a programme of practical action. In the resolutions which it has adopted,
the Committee proposes that the Council should invite the interested Governments to open nego-
tiations in order to arrive at agreements with a view to carrying out this piogramme.
The wealth of information collected by the Committee has enabled it, moreover, to examine
the general situation as regards the production and use of opium and other drugs.
Composition of the Committee.
All the members and assessors were present, but in some instances the Governments concerned
had nominated new representatives, Dr. Uchino now representing Japan, Dr. Poensgen represent-
ing Germany, and the United States of America being represented in an advisory capacity by the
Hon. Stephen G. Porter in association with Bishop Brent and Surgeon-General Blue No
answer having been received by the Secretariat from the Government of the Kmgdom of the Serbs,
Croats and Slovenes to the invitations issued by the Council, this Power was not represented.
The following is a list of the members present:
France: M. G. Bourgois (Chairman)
Siam: H. H. Prince Charoon (Vice-Chairman)
China: M. Chao-Hsin Chu
Germany: Dr. Poensgen
Great Britain: Sir Malcolm Delevingne
India: Mr. John Campbell
Japan: Dr. Senichi Uchino

United States of America: The Hon. Stephen G. Porter, in association with
Bishop Brent and Surgeon-General Blue.
Assessors :

Secretary: Dame Rachel Crowdy.
Revision of the Rules of Procedure.
The Committee decided, with reference to Rule 2 of its Rules of Procedure, that the Chairman
and Vice-Chairman should hold office from one spring session to another.
Publicity of Meetings.
The Committee noted that the Council had agreed that it should be left to the discretion of the
Committee to decide what publicity should be given to its meetings.
The Committee decided that for this session all the meetings should be held in public unless
the members of the Committee wished to sit in private for the discussion of any particular question.
The Proposals of the United States of America.
The delegation of the United States of America presented the two following proposals:
?1. If the purpose of the Hague Opium Convention is to be achieved according to its spirit
and true intent, it must be recognised that the use of opium products for other than medi-
cinal and scientific purposes is an abuse and not legitimate. ?


?2. In order to prevent the abuse of these drugs, it is necessary to exercise the control of the
production of raw opium in such a manner that there will be no surplus available for
non-medicinal and non-scientific purposes. ?
These proposals were amplified by the United States representatives, who, in commenting
on them, showed that they were in full accordance with both the letter and the spirit of the Inter-
national Opium Convention of 1912.
The Committee very fully examined the proposals of the United States. It would be difficult
in a short space to summarise the discussions which took place, but a full report of them is included
in the minutes of the meetings, and reference should be made to them. After a long discussion,
and on the proposal of a Drafting Committee which was appointed to prepare the final text, the
Committee adopted unanimously the following resolution:
?I. The Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium accepts and recommends to the League
of Nations the proposals of the United States representatives as embodying the general
principles by which the Governments should be guided in dealing with the question of the abuse
of dangerous drugs, and on which, in fact, the International Convention of 1912 is based, sub-
ject to the fact that the following reservation has been made by the representatives of the
Governments of France, Germany, Great Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal and Siam:
? ?The use of prepared opium and the production, export and import of raw opium
for that purpose are legitimate so long as that use is subject to and in accordance with the
provisions of Chapter II of the Convention. ?
?11. The Advisory Committee, appreciating the great value of the co-operation of the
Government of the United States of America in the efforts which the League has for the past
two years been making to deal with the question of the abuse of dangerous drugs, expresses the
belief that all the Governments concerned will be desirous of co-operating with that Govern-
ment in giving the fullest possible effect to the Convention.
?111. In bringing the American proposals to the notice of the Council and the Assembly,
the Advisory Committee would recall that, during the two years that have elapsed since the
Convention came into operation, it has worked towards the same ends by: (1) taking all possible
steps to secure the adhesion of all countries to the Convention; (2) investigating the question
of the world?s needs of the manufactured drugs for medicinal and scientific uses with a view to
the eventual limitation of the production of these drugs; (3) recommending the system of import
certificates, arranging the exchange between States of information in regard to the illicit
traffic in the drugs, and proposing other measures for securing international co-operation in
suppressing that traffic; (4) inviting the Powers with territories in the Far East to review their
requirements of opium, and submitting proposals for an investigation by the Chinese Govern-
ment of the conditions in China with a view to the more effective application of Chapter II
of the Convention and the solution of the problem of the use of prepared opium in the Far
East; (5) collecting and publishing information as to the measures taken to give effect to the
Convention and the position generally in all countries in regard to the traffic with a view to
securing the enforcement of the Convention.
?IV. As a means of giving effect to the principles submitted by the representatives
of the United States and the policy which the League, on the recommendation of the Commit-
tee, has adopted, and having regard to the information now available, the Advisory Committee
recommends to the Council the advisability of inviting:
? (a) The Governments of the States in which morphine, heroin or cocaine and their respective
salts are manufactured and the Governments of the States in which raw opium or the coca
leaf is produced for export for the purpose of such manufacture;
?(b) The Governments having territories in which the use of prepared opium is temporarily
continued under the provisions of Chapter II of the Convention, and the Government of
the Republic of China,
to enter into immediate negotiations (by nominating representatives to form a committee or
committees, or otherwise) to consider whether, with a view to giving the fullest possible effect
to the Convention of 1912, agreements could not now be reached between them:
? (a) As to a limitation of the amounts of morphine, heroin or cocaine and their respective salts
to be manufactured; as to a limitation of the amounts of raw opium and the coca leaf to be
imported for that purpose and for other medicinal and scientific purposes, and as to a
limitation of the production of raw opium and the coca leaf for export to the amount
required for such medicinal and scientific purposes. Ihe latter limitation is not 10
be deemed to apply to the production and export of raw opium for the purpose of smoking
in those territories where that practice is temporarily continued under the provision of
Chapter II of the Convention;
?(b) As to a reduction of the amount of raw opium to be imported for the purpose of smoking
in those territories where it is temporarily continued, and as to the Government of the
Republic of China to bring about a suppression of the illegal production and use of opium
in China/?


Reservation by the Representative of the Government of India.
The representative of the Government of India associates himself with the foregoing resolution,
subject to the following reservation regarding paragraph I:
?The use of raw opium, according to the established practice in India, and its production
for such use, are not illegitimate under the Convention. ?

to enter into immediate negotiations (by nominating representatives to form a committee

effect to the Convention of 1912, agreements could not now be reached between them.
?(a) As to a limitation of the amounts of morphine, heroin or cocaine and their respective
salts to be manufactured; as to a limitation of the amounts of raw opium and the
coca-leaf to be imported for that purpose and for other medicinal and scientific
purposes; and as to a limitation of the production of raw opium and the coca-leaf
For export to the amount required for such medicinal and scientific purposes. The
latter limitation is not to be deemed to apply to the production and export of raw
opium for the purpose of smoking in those territories where that practice is tempo-

smoking in those territories where it is temporarily continued and as to the measures
which should be taken by the Government of the Republic of China to bring about
a suppression of the illegal production and use of opium in China.
Reservation by the Representative of the Government of India.
The representative of the Government of India associates himself with the foregoing
resolution, subject to the following reservation regarding paragraph 1.
?The use of raw opium, according to the established practice in India, and its pro-
duction for such use, are not illegitimate under the Convention.
The representatives of the Unites States of America communicated to the Advisory Committee
the following reply regarding the above resolution:
?I have the honour to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of June sth, 1923, enclosing
a copy of the resolution adopted by the Advisory Committee m regard to the propositions
presented by the United States lepresentatives.
?The reservation made by the representatives of the Governments of France, Germany,
Great Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal and Siam m adopting the American proposals
appears to be but a reaffirmation of Chapter II of the Hague Opium Convention, and, as sue ,
eFves rise to no question. Paragraphs II and 111 are matters to which no exception could,
ft is hoped, be taken, especially as it is the earnest desire of the United States to co-operate
in every possible way in the work of suppressing the abuse of narcotic drugs.
?While I am without specific instructions in regard to the subject-matter of Paragraph IV,
it contains a suggestion which I shall take pleasure in submitting to my Government for
favourable consideration. (Signed) Stephen G. Porter. ?
Application of Chapter II of the Convention with Reference to European Possessions
and Other Countries in the Far East.
The Advisory Committee very fully discussed the question of the use of prepared opium
and examined tSe figures for consumption in the European Possessions and other countries m
the Far East. It reached the conclusion that the general situation does not show at present
the gradual reduction of the use of prepared opium which is stipulated by the terms of Chapter II
by six votes to one, with one abstention, the following resolution
proposed by the representative of Great Britain.
?The Advisory Committee, having regard to the large amount of detailed information
now available, recommends the Council to invite the Powers with Far Eastern temtones
where the use of opium for smoking is temporarily continued in pursuance of Chapter II
of the Opium Convention, to enter into immediate negotiations, by means of calling a special
conference of representatives of these Governments or otherwise to consider what me asures
could be taken to give a more effective application to Chapter II of the Convention and to
bring about a reduction of the amount of opium used, and whether, on the lines of the sug-
gestions set out below or on other lines, an agreement or understanding could not now be
reached for the adoption of a uniform policy on the matter:
?1 That the farm system, where it is still in operation, should be abolished, and that
the opium business should be made a Government monopoly and kept entirely
in the hands of the Government.
?11. As a corollary of paragraph 1, that the retail sale of prepared opium should be
made only from Government shops, and that all private shops should be abolished.
Persons in charge of the Government shops should be paid a fixed salary, without
any commission on the amount of business done, and therefore would have no
temptation to push the sales.


?m. That a uniform maximum limit should be fixed for the amount of prepared
opium placed on sale for consumption, calculated according to the number of
the adult Chinese male population, e.g., x taels per 10,000 adult Chinese males
in the territory, and that the annual imports of raw opium should be limited
to the amount required for that rate of consumption.
?Tv. That the possibilities of the system of registration and licensing, which has already
been introduced in some of the Far Eastern territories, should be thoroughly
explored.
?v. That the possibility should be considered of making uniform, so far as circum-
stances permit:
?(a) the price at which prepared opium is retailed in the different territories, and
?(6) the penalties for infraction of the law in regard to the import, export, sale
and use of prepared opium.
?vi. That the interested Powers, that is the Powers having territories in the Far
East where the consumption of prepared opium is still permitted, should conclude
an agreement among themselves to apply the foregoing measures for the purpose
of carrying out Chapter II of the Convention.
? vii. That the position should be generally reviewed periodically by the Powers interested
and the question of further reducing the maximum limit fixed in the agreement
should be considered. ?
The Committee further unanimously decided to recommend that the minutes of its discussions
on the subject should be communicated to the Governments with the resolution.
Limitation on the Manufacture of Morphine, Other Opium Derivatives
and Cocaine.
The Advisory Committee examined such figures as had been obtainable regarding the manu-
facture of morphine, other opium derivatives and cocaine in the producing countries. It became
apparent, during the consideration of this item of the agenda, that there was a large amount
of morphine and other drugs imported to and manufactured in Japan. The Committee received
explanations from the Japanese representative to the effect that, as no figures for the quantity
of morphine actually remaining in stock in Japan were available, the statistics for import and
manufacture combined could not be taken as representing consumption. The Committee noted
that, from information supplied by the Japanese Government to the Japanese Diet on February
2nd, 1923, it appeared that the quantity of narcotic drugs required by Japan for internal consump-
tion was far below the amount imported and manufactured.
The Japanese representative said that it might be supposed that some quantity of drugs
was smuggled out of Japan without the knowledge of the Japanese Government, but he informed
the Committee of new ordinances which had lately been promulgated by his Government with
the object of restricting the import and export of morphine, cocaine and their respective salts
and of supervising their manufacture, sale and consumption. The new laws required the permis-
sion of the Department of Home Affairs for the export and import of these drugs, and, in the
case of export, the application had to be accompanied by a certificate issued by the authorities
of the locality to which the shipment was destined. A manufacturer was required to notify
the local authorities of the raw materials which he used, his yearly output and the whereabouts
of his factory. He had further to furnish an annual report of the names of the products, the quan-
tities which he manufactured and the sources of supply of his raw materials. The Committee
was glad to receive the assurances of the Japanese representative that his Government was taking
more effective measures to cope with the general situation in Japan regarding narcotics.
The Committee had before it statistics of the import of drugs into America showing that the
great majority of the derivatives of opium and cocaine imported by the United States was furnished
by Switzerland. The importance of obtaining the adhesion of Switzerland to the Convention
and the import and export certificate system was emphasised.
The information obtained by the Committee concerning the manufacture of drugs was steadily
increasing and seemed to make it possible now to form a rough estimate of the world?s
requirements.
Twenty-one Governments had transmitted to the Secretariat an approximate estimate
of their total annual requirements for internal consumption, and the Mixed Sub-Committee
appointed jointly by the Health and Opium Committees was still pursuing its investigations.
Suggestions were considered regarding the limitation of the manufacture of morphine, heroin
and cocaine, and the Committee reached the conclusion that it now seemed possible for the Govern-
ments of the producing countries to approach each other with a view to reaching a general under-
standing.
With regard to heroin, the Advisory Committee, on the suggestion of the Portuguese repre-
sentative, decided to recommend to the Council a resolution to the effect that Governments should
be asked to transmit their views as to the possibility of the total suppression of the manufacture
of heroin or, alternatively, the limitation of its manufacture to the minimum quantities recognised
as necessary either for special cases or for prescriptions by specialists. The Portuguese represen-
tative supported his proposal by referring to certain authoritative opinions expressed in the


medical world, which tended to show that the total suppression of the manufacture of heroin
would not deprive the medical world of a necessary drug.
The Committee?s final decision regarding the action to be recommended on the question
of the limitation of the manufacture of these drugs will be found in that part of this report dealing
with the proposals of the United States of America.
Progress Report.
The Advisory Committee also had before it a progress report by the Secretariat on the work
accomplished since its January session.
(a) Signature and Ratification of the Convention.
The Committee noted that fifty-one countries Members of the League had signed, and forty
two had ratified, the International Opium Convention of 1912 K Mrs. Hamilton Wright
furnished the Committee with information regarding the position in Turkey. She had been
officially requested by the Turkish delegation to the Lausanne Conference to inform the Committee
that the text of the Convention had been included in the Treaty at present under consideration
between Turkey and Greece that Turkey was willing to accept the Convention, to join the League
of Nations and to accept the same restrictions as any other nation.
(b) Import Certificate System.
The Committee reviewed the general situation and noted that twenty States had accepted
the import and export certificate system and had put it into force, and that thirteen others had
accepted it in principle. Since the last session of the Committee, therefore, eight more
countries had now put this system into effect and three had accepted it in principle.
The representatives of the United States of America explained the system of certificates
in force in that country. An importer had to obtain authority from the Federal Narcotics Control
Board in respect of each consignment proposed to be imported, and, if approval were given
could obtain from the Board a certificate to that effect. The Board had full power to adopt
any form of certificate which it might think fit. . t
The Committee instructed the Secretariat to communicate the particulars of the system m
force in America to all signatory States of the International Opium Convention of 1912 m order
that those States might, before sanctioning exports to the United States of America, obtain the
production of a certificate from the Federal Narcotics Control Board.
The Portuguese representative stated that a Bill was at the moment before the Portuguese
Chamber providing for the issue of a certificate of import to all exporting countries which demanded
it The certificate would state that the quantities imported were for medicinal and scientific
purposes and, further, that the drugs would not be re-exported; the certificate would apply only
to European and Insular Portugal. With regard to the Portuguese Colonies, the Portuguese
Government thought it preferable to make special provisions m view of the special conditions
obtaining in Macao with regard to the question of opium. ... x .
Through lack of time, the further consideration of the position m regard to the import cer-
tificate system was postponed till the next session of the Committee.
The Committee was also compelled to postpone the further consideration of the resolution
of the Third Assembly, as the position in regard to Switzerland, Turkey and Persia was not yet
cleared up.
(c) Annual Reports.
Fifteen annual reports for 1921 and eleven for 1922 have been received by the Secretariat.
Several of these reports, however, are not complete. The Committee decided once more to ask
the Council to urge on the Governments the importance of sending m the annual reports on the
traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs in accordance with the unanimous recommendation
of the Assembly, since the information which they contained was of the utmost value.
(d) Traffic in Cocaine.
The Advisory Committee noted that eighteen Governments had replied to the request to
furnish information with regard to manufacture of cocaine and that twelve countries had sent m
an estimate of their requirements. In addition, estimated requirements had been received from a
large number of British Colonies. , .. ~ , ~ ,
The Secretariat is in correspondence with Peru and Bolivia regarding the production and
export of coca-leaves as well as of crude cocaine and its salts. . .
The Netherlands representative informed the Committee that the Minister for Foreign Affairs
was willing to ask the Minister for Labour to introduce a Bill authorising the Netherlands Govern-
ment to publish figures for the manufacture of cocaine the moment that the Committee had received
1 The following States Members of the League have signed but not ratified the Convention ; Argentine,
Colombia, Costa Rica, Esthonia, Lithuania, Paraguay, Persia and Switzerland. Albania has neither signed nor
ratified the Convention.


similar figures from all other manufacturing countries. The Committee noted that, with the
exception of Peru and Bolivia, the only statistics of manufacture which had not yet been obtained
were those from France and the Netherlands, and the French representative informed the Com-
mittee that the French figures would be in the hands of the Secretariat in a very short time.
The representative of the Netherlands requested the Secretariat to send him the French figures
on their arrival in order that he might request his Government to take the action to which he
had referred.
The progress report further dealt with the total annual requirements of opium and its deriva-
tives for consumption, the discrepancies between statistics in the returns of the various countries,
and the co-operation between China and Japan with regard to illicit traffic. The decisions on
these points will be found under different headings.
Exchange of Information with regard to the Seizures of Drugs.
The Advisory Committee attached the utmost importance, in connection with the suppres-
sion of the traffic, to the exchange of information between Governments of the seizures of drugs.
It therefore adopted the following resolution:
?The Advisory Committee recommends the Council to draw the attention of the Govern-
ments to the extreme desirability not only of direct communication to other immediately
interested Governments of the details of any seizures made but also of a general communi-
cation to the Secretariat of the League of Nations of all important seizures in order that the
fullest international publicity may be secured by the transmission, with the consent of the
Governments concerned, of this information by the Secretariat both to other Governments
not immediately concerned in the specific case and to the Press.?
World Production of Opium.
In reviewing the general situation with regard to the world production of opium, the Advisory
Committee noted the lack of accurate or detailed information for most of the producing countries.
The Committee understood that the investigations which the Chinese Government undertook to
make this year are being made, but that the reports of these enquiries have not yet been received.
The Committee noted that, according to the latest information in its possession, the position was
worse than last year.
In the course of the discussions, the French representative explained that his Government
had taken steps to prevent any passage through Tonkin of opium from Yunnan destined for
another province in the south of China.
The Chinese representative assured the Committee that the Government of the Republic
of China would never under any circumstances legalise the production of opium in China and that
the present recrudescence was due to the lack of control by the central Government in certain
provinces. The rumour which had been circulated regarding the establishment of an opium
monopoly by the Chinese Government was untrue; that Government would never recede from
the position which it had taken up in 1917 when the final prohibition of cultivation had been
carried out.
Discrepancies in Statistical Returns and the Position of Bonded Warehouses.
The Advisory Committee had before it the replies of the Japanese, British and United States
Governments on the discrepancies between British and American statistics of exports of drugs to
Japan and the Japanese statistics of imports of drugs from those countries. The British repre-
sentative proposed that some arrangement should be come to between the Governments for the
preparation, on a uniform basis, of their statistics of the import and export of drugs, whereby
uniform particulars could be given, more especially as to the countries from which the drugs
were consigned, the country of destination, if possible, the countries through which the drugs
passed by way of transit or transhipment, shipments out of bond and, if possible, the country
of origin, that is, the country in which the goods were manufactured or produced.
During the discussion on this question, the Japanese representative informed the Committee
that the former practice in his country of waiting until narcotics landed in bond were withdrawn
from bond before regarding them as imports had been discontinued. The new regulations laid
down that all narcotics landed in bond would be considered as imports from the date of their
landing.
The Committee eventually appointed a Sub-Committee to enquire into the possibility of
establishing a system whereby uniformity in statistics could be obtained. The Committee approved
the suggestion in the report that the statement prepared for the Sub-Committee by the Secre-
tariat should be transmitted to all Governments with a request for their observations. The
Committee also recommended that the note prepared by the British representative on the
position of bonded warehouses in relation to the traffic should be sent at the same time for the
observations of the Governments.


Article XIV of the Convention: Memorandum on Exemptions submitted by the Siamese
Representative.
The Siamese representative raised the question as to what exemption should be granted by a
State to preparations which did not come within the terms of the Convention because the percentage
of morphia or cocaine which they contained was less than that prescribed therein. A quanti y
of morphia, for instance, might be so diluted by a solvent as to bring it below 0.2 per cent and thus
cause the preparation to fall outside the scope and control of the Convention.
The Advisory Committee decided to recommend that the Governments should be asked
whether they had experienced any difficulties and, if so, how they had dealt with them and to
communicate to the Secretariat any information in their possession on this subject m order that
the matter might be discussed at the next session of the Committee.
Voluntary Organisations.
The Committee took note of resolutions and reports submitted by the following voluntary
organisations:
The Harvard International Assembly ;
The International Anti-Opium Association;
The Edinburgh Anti-Opium Association;
The International Women's Suffrage Alliance;
The League of Red Cross Societies.
Co-operation between Japan and China with regard to Illicit Traffic.
The Committee noted that negotiations were in progress between Japan and China regarding
co-operation between these countries in order to suppress smuggling. A joint committee was
about to be set up to examine this question.
Increase in Penalties: Proposal by the French Government.
The French representative informed the Committee that the French Government attached
great importance to the question of increasing the penalties for illicit traffic in drugs. By reason
of the ease with which these drugs can be smuggled, it considered that, however stringent the
measures taken on the frontiers of a country, it was impossible to detect more than a very small
quantity of the contraband drugs passed through. During the discussion, the French repre-
sentative drew attention to the advisability of instituting the penalty of imprisonment, and if
possible of prohibition of residence (interdiction de sSjour). He called attention to the tact mat
certain courts were not always ready to apply with complete strictness the penalties laid down.
Attention was also called by the British representative to a new provision which had just
been adopted by Parliament in the Dangerous Drugs Act of the present year, which was to the
effect that:
Any person ?who, in Great Britain, aids, abets, counsels or procures a commission in
any place outside Great Britain of any offence punishable under the provisions of any corre-
sponding law in force in that place, or does any act preparatory to or m furtherance of any
act which, if committed in Great Britain, would constitute an offence against this Act ,
shall be guilty of an offence against the Act.
The Committee adopted the following resolution:
?The Advisory Committee, considering that the infliction of severe penalties on persons
engaged in the illicit traffic in narcotics is one of the best means of preventing the spread
of that traffic recommends the increase of penalties in certain countries, the adoption of the
penalty of imprisonment, and, if possible, of prohibition of residence (interdiction de sdjour),
a very strict application of the penalties laid down, and the introduction of clauses providing
for the punishment of infractions committed in foreign countries.?
Conclusion.
In submitting this report to the Council, the Committee draws attention to the importance
which it attaches to the collaboration of the United States of America and expresses the hope
that this collaboration will be continued.
Resolutions.
I The Advisory Committee on Traffic in Opium accepts and recommends to the League
of Nations the proposals of the United States representatives as embodying the


general principles by which the Governments should be guided in dealing with the
question of the abuse of dangerous drugs and on which, in fact, the International
Convention of 1912 is based, subject to the fact that the following reservation
has been made by the representatives of the Governments of France, Germany,
Great Britain, Japan, the Netherlands, Portugal and Siam:
?The use of prepared opium and the production, export and import of
raw opium for that purpose are legitimate so long as that use is subject to and
in accordance with the provisions of Chapter II of the Convention.?
11. The Advisory Committee, appreciating the great value of the co-operation of the
Government of the United States of America in the efforts which the League has for
the past two years been making to deal with the question of the abuse of dangerous
drugs, expresses the belief that all the Governments concerned will be desirous of
co-operating with that Government in giving the fullest possible effect to the Con-
vention.
111. In bringing the American proposals to the notice of the Council and the Assembly,
the Advisory Committee would recall that, during the two years that have elapsed
since the Convention came into operation, it has worked towards the same ends
by: (1) taking all possible steps to secure the adhesion of all countries to the Con-
vention; (2) investigating the question of the world?s needs of the manufactured
drugs for medicinal and scientific uses with a view to the eventual limitation of the
production of these drugs; (3) recommending the system of import certificates,
arranging the exchange between States of information in regard to the illicit traffic
in the drugs, and proposing other measures for securing international co-operation
in suppressing that traffic; (4) inviting the Powers with territories in the Far East
to review their requirements of opium, and submitting proposals for an investiga-
tion by the Chinese Government of the conditions in China, with a view to the
more effective application of Chapter II of the Convention and the solution of the
problem of the use of prepared opium in the Far East; (5) collecting and publishing
information as to the measures taken to give effect to the Convention and the posi-
tion generally in all countries in regard to the traffic, with a view to securing the
enforcement of the Convention.
IV. As a means of giving effect to the principles submitted by the representatives of
the United States and the policy which the League, on the recommendation of the
Committee, has adopted, and having regard to the information now available, the
Advisory Committee recommends to the Council the advisability of inviting:
(a) The Governments of the States in which morphine, heroin, or cocaine, and their
respective salts are manufactured and the Governments of the States in which
raw opinion or the coca-leaf are produced for export for the purpose of such
manufacture;
( h) The Governments having territories in which the use of prepared opium is
temporarily continued under the provisions of Chapter II of the Convention
and the Government of the Republic of China,
to enter into immediate negotiations (by nominating representatives to form a
committee or committees, or otherwise) to consider whether, with a view to giving
the fullest possible effect to the Convention of 1912, agreements could not now be
reached between them;
(a) as to a limitation of the amounts of morphine, heroin or cocaine and their res-
pective salts to be manufactured; as to a limitation of the amounts of raw
opium and the coca-leaf to be imported for that purpose and for other medicinal
and scientific purposes; and as to a limitation of the production of raw opium
and the coca-leaf for export to the amount required for such medicinal and
scientific purposes. The latter limitation is not to be deemed to apply to the
production and export of raw opium for the purpose of smoking in those
territories where that practice is temporarily continued under the provisions of
Chapter II of the Convention;
( b) as to a reduction of the amount of raw opium to be imported for the purpose
of smoking in those territories where it is temporarily continued, and as to the
measures which should be taken by the Government of the Republic of China
to bring about a suppression of the illegal production and use of opium in China.
Reservation by the Representative of the Government of India
The representative of the Government of India associates himself with the foregoing
resolution, subject to the following reservation regarding paragraph 1:
?The use of raw opium, according to the established practice in India, and its pro-
duction for such use are not illegitimate under the Convention.


The Advisory Committee, having regard to the large amount of detailed information
now available, recommends the Council to invite the Powers with Far Eastern territories
where the use of opium for smoking is temporarily continued in pursuance of Chapter II
of the Opium Convention, to enter into immediate negotiations, by means of calling a special
conference of representatives of these Governments, or otherwise, to consider what measures
could be taken to give a more effective application to Chapter II of the Convention and to
bring about a reduction of the amount of opium used, and whether, on the lines of the sugges-
tions set out below or on other lines, an agreement or understanding could not now be reached
for the adoption of a uniform policy on the matter:
i. That the farm system, where it is still in operation, should be abolished and that
the opium business should be made a Government monopoly and kept entirely
in the hands of the Government.
ii. As a corollary of paragraph i, that the retail sale of prepared opium should be made
only from Government shops, and that all private shops should be abolished.
Persons in charge of Government shops should be paid a fixed salary without any
commission on the amount of business done, and therefore would have no tempta-
tion to push the sales.
in. That a uniform maximum limit should be fixed for the amount of prepared opium
placed on sale for consumption, calculated according to the number of the adult
Chinese male population, e.g., x taels per 10,000 adult Chinese males in the terri-
tory, and that the annual imports of raw opium should be limited to the amount
required for that rate of consumption.
iv. That the possibilities of the system of registration and licensing, which has already
been introduced in some of the Far Eastern territories, should be thoroughly explored.
v. That the possibility should be considered of making uniform, so far as circumstances
permit:
(?) the price at which prepared opium is retailed in the different territories, and
(?) the penalties for infraction of the law in regard to the import, export, sale and
use of prepared opium.
vi. That the interested Powers, that is, the Powers having territories in the Far East
where the consumption of prepared opium is still permitted, should conclude an
agreement among themselves to apply the foregoing measures for the purpose of
carrying out Chapter II of the Convention.
vii. That the position should be generally xeviewed periodically by the Powers interested
and the question of further reducing the maximum limit fixed in the agreement
should be considered.
The Advisory Committee asks the Council to request the Governments to communicate
their views as to the possibility of a total suppression of the manufacture of heroin or of
its limitation to the minimum amount required.
The Advisory Committee, being convinced of the great value of the information con-
tained in the annual reports which each Government has been requested to transmit to the
Secretariat, once more recommends the Council to urge on the Governments the importance
of sending regularly to the Secretariat such reports, which should contain the fullest possible
information, both with regard to the production of and the traffic in opium and other narcotics.
The Advisory Committee recommends the Council to draw the attention of the Govern-
ments to the extreme desirability not only of direct communication to other immediately
interested Governments of the details of any seizures made but also of a general communica-
tion to the Secretariat of the League of Nations of all important seizures in order that the
fullest international publicity may be secured by the transmission, with the consent of the
Governments concerned, of this information by the Secretariat both to other Governments
not immediately concerned in the specific case and to the Press.
The Advisory Committee recommends that the statement prepared by the Secretariat
for the Sub-Committee on Customs Statistics, together with the memorandum prepared by
Sir Malcolm Delevingne on the position of bonded warehouses in regard to the traffic in
narcotics, should be communicated to the Governments with a request for their observations.
The Advisory Committee, considering that the infliction of severe penalties on persons
engaged in the illicit traffic in narcotics is one of the best means of preventing the spread
of that traffic, recommends the increase of penalties in certain countries, the adoption of the
penalty of imprisonment, and, if possible, of prohibition of residence (interdiction of sejour),
a very strict application of the penalties laid down, and the introduction of clauses providing
for the punishment of infractions committed in foreign countries.

Annex 7
STATEMENT BY M. KOO (NATIONAL ANTI-OPIUM ASSOCIATION OF CHINA).
M. Koo (National Anti-Opium Association of China): Mr. President, members of the Second
Conference, ladies and gentlemen, I wish to thank the Assembly first for giving me the privilege
of addressing it this afternoon. In speaking to this Conference I labour under two serious diffi-
culties: first, I speak in a language which is not my own, and, second, I have had no diplomatic
training and therefore can speak only the plain language of the man in the street. Therefore
I urge you not to scrutinise too closely the letter and style of what I am going to say but more
the spirit of my words.
I stand before you to-day as a representative of the National Anti-Opium Association of
China. This Association is formed by some 34 peoples? organisations. I shall not take up your
time by reading through the whole list of these organisations. By mentioning a few, the character
of them will become plain. They are: the General Chamber of Commerce; the China Medical
Association; the Union of Daily Newspapers; the Red Cross Society of China; the National Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Education; the Overseas Chinese Union; the National Council
of Churches; the National Committees of the Y.M.C.A. and the Y.W.C.A. of China; the Boy
Scouts Union; the World?s Chinese Students? Federation, etc.
Since the formation of the Anti-Opium Association of China by these peoples? organisations,
our work has been much hampered by the late fighting between our military factions. Therefore,
up to September we have not been able to organise more than 188 branch Anti-Opium Associations
in 19 provinces of China and one special territory. These Associations are made up of men from
all walks of life educationists, merchants, lawyers, doctors, ministers, social workers, editors,
students, and so forth. But even in these abnormal times of our country we have been able to
push forward our work, as a telegram recently received by me will indicate. This telegram says
that the National Anti-Opium Association has succeeded in getting up a petition to the League
of Nations signed by 1,300 organisations located all over China, representing some two million
people. They have also succeeded in placing upon the agenda of the Peace Conference called
by General Feng Yu Hsiang the question of opium suppression; and the Ministry of the Interior,
which is entrusted with the preparation of this Peace Conference, is co-operating fully on this
question with the National Anti-Opium Association.
I am sent to Geneva by these organisations not to defend the Opium situation in our own
country nor to attack the opium policy in other lands. We recognise that little is to be achieved
by those means. In fact the organisation of the National Anti-Opium Association by these
bodies is to express the determination of the Chinese people again to resume the war against
the return of the opium evil in our country without, at first, any reference to the two Conferences
called by the League of Nations here during this month. But they have sent me here, first,
that I may bring back to the people of China the opinion and the attitude of the nations present
here in this Conference on the opium question, and, second, that I may tell the nations here
what we are trying to do through this National Anti-Opium Association. I use the phrase ?what
we are trying to do ? advisedly, because the difficulty and complexity of the problem which
we have undertaken to attack is one which is fully recognised by all those who are engaged in it,
and we are not foolish enough to shut our eyes to the magnitude of the work that we have under-
taken. But, whether we will succeed or not, we have set our hands to the work for the next
ten years, and time and our own determination will alone give the verdict. The National Anti-
Opium Association is formed to help our people in China and abroad to rid themselves of the
curse of opium and its allied drugs. To accomplish this end, we shall start work on the following
lines:
1. To suppress ihe Planting of Opium in China. We have watched the return of the poppy-
fields in China with great concern. You are all familiar with the cause of this return. If we wait
until the political situation clears in our own country we may have to wait for some time. But
we do not propose to wait. We shall take each province by itself and assist the provincial author-
ities and, in certain cases, compel the provincial authorities to carry out the laws against poppy-
planting. Through our branch associations we shall inspect the whole province during the time
when the poppy would be in bloom. In order to make this inspection quite impartial, the National
Anti-Opium Association favours the invitation by them of persons of recognised standing of
non-Chinese origin to be associated with our delegates when they undertake this annual inspec-
tion work. Through the application of public opinion in China and abroad in this manner, we
hope that the first item in our programme may reach a successful issue.
2. The Prevention of Opium-smoking and the Abuse of Morphine, Cocaine, etc. People
speak about China as though opium-smoking had returned to the same extent as before the days
when smoking was made illegal. Having myself moved somewhat among the young men
of my own country in different parts of China, I know that that is not true. But, whether true
or otherwise, the National Anti-Opium Association proposes to conduct an educational campaign
against opium-smoking and the abuse of morphine, cocaine and so forth. Thank God we have
these peoples?organisations through which we can conduct such a campaign with ease and effect,


and through which we can also promote a campaign to prohibit its members from contracting
the habit of smoking opium and to prohibit its members from the abuse of dangerous drugs.
This work is already started. Our aim is to stir up a moral conscience against the use of opium
and its allied drugs, which will be a powerful support for the effective prosecuting of action against
opium smokers and drug addicts. In this connection I would like to call the attention o t e
Conference to the problem of territories and settlements in and near China, where people can
still smoke with the sanction of law. Wherever these territories and settlements exist, it is
essential, for the success of anti-opium measures, to have complete understanding between the
authorities concerned and administrative co-operation in addition. For instance, if Hong-Kong
is trying to make a real effort to end opium-smoking, it would surely fail if Canton is not sincerely
co-operating in the same direction. The reverse of the situation is also true. It is not unh e y
that as the work of the National Anti-Opium Association develops, we shall have frequent occa-
sion'to have recourse to the colonial and settlement authorities for advice and co-operation, and
I hope that the Governments here present which have territories m the Far East will co-operate
with us in our work in this respect.
o. The Illicit Trade in Narcotics. This is by far the most serious problem that the National
Anti-Opium Association will have to face. Other nations in the First Conference repeatedly
mentioned the fact of long frontiers, of extra-territorial rights, of the disparity of penalties con-
nected with the punishment of smuggling, etc. which make it almost impossible to cope with the
illicit traffic in opium in their respective territories. All these difficulties are present with us n
dealing with the illicit traffic in narcotics, but in a much more acute degree. It is a well-known
fact that the smuggling of morphine and other dangerous drugs into China is going on on an
extensive scale. It is therefore a most serious question which we have to face m our anti-opium
work if in suppressing the cultivation and smoking of opium m China, we cannot at the same
time deal effectively with the illicit traffic in narcotics. As a peoples organisation, we have, ot
course, nothing to say on the diplomatic and legal side of this problem. But here also we wis
to ask the Conference to recognise the principle that the illicit traffic in these drugs c ,^
limited until their production and manufacture is first brought under control, and that the mos
effective way to check this illicit trade is to check it m the countries where it ongmates.
The National Anti-Opium Association, therefore, supports will all its power the proposa
that we should limit the production of opium and its derivatives and of cocaine strictly
tific and medical use only and that the manufacture of these drugs should be placed under strict
Government supervision.
4 The Problem of smoking Opium Overseas Chinese. To co-operate m the desire of the
colonial Governments to stamp oit the opium-smoking habit, the National Anti-Opium Asso-
ciation will organise a special bureau to deal with the overseas Chinese from two angles, (a) to
stimulate the Chinese communites in these territories to organise anti-opium work among them-
selves- (6) to agitate for legislation in our own country, looking towards the restriction of the
emigration of Chinese into territories where the registration and rationing of opium-smokers
have not yet been adopted, to prohibit addicted smokers from going to settle in those territories,
and to refuse entry into China of Chinese from those territories who are opium addicts.
d Along these four main lines the National Anti-Opium Association is going to wage a war
aeainst opium in our own country. We all realise that the odds against us are tremendous.
But the question concerns so deeply the welfare of the Chinese people that, no matter what is
done here in this Conference, no matter what the prospects of success, or no matter what sacrifices
we may be called upon to make in this undertaking, we shall push forward this work until we
have rid ourselves of this curse. Public opinion, moral sentiment and the innate common sense
of the Chinese people are definitely against opium, and on these we shall pm our faith. Thos
us who are in touch with the unfolding national life in our own country have seen the growth
in recent years of the consciousness and power of the people, and th!S consciousness and power
have in recent years been expressed on more than one occasion of national
of this knowledge that I can speak to you to-day with the confidence and assurance that I have
� n *ln conclusion, may I refer to the address which was delivered by Bishop Brent yesterday.
If he will allow me, I would like to associate myself and the organisation I represent with those
challenging words of his, especially when he appealed for the recognition of the fact that the w
and woe of one people should be accepted as the common concern of all; when he urged the nations
to deal with this opium question from the ethical and not from the financial plane and when he
advocated the absolute limitation of manufacture and production of opium andL
to medical and scientific purposes only. I can assure the Conference that the| People cf China
will support these measures which we are going to push m our own country with all their might
and the proof of their support is to be found in the measures which we are going to push m our
own country through the National Anti-Opium Association. On behalf of all m China who are
interested in this question, I thank the Conference for having given us the privilege of hearing
the voice of a prophet added to the voice of the diplomat and the exper .


Annex 8
STATEMENT BY Dr. WARNHUIS
(International Missionary Council).
Dr. Warnhuis (International Missionary Council); Mr. President, members of the Con-
ference, ladies and gentlemen, it is a very great honour to be permitted to address this Con-
ference, composed of representatives of so many Governments meeting here as you are, to consider
proposals for a larger measure of co-operation in controlling the traffic in opium and other dan-
gerous drugs. For this privilege I offer my best thanks.
The International Council, for whom I have the honour of standing here to-day,
is an organisation representing the missionary forces of all the Protestant Churches in Christen
dom. In each country these churches and missionary societies have organised councils or con-
ferences, and these national organisations appoint delegates to the International Council. In
this way, the Council represents the foreign missionary forces of all the Protestant Churches of
Norway, Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Belgium, France, Switzerland,
Great Britain and Ireland, the United States of America, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New
Zealand, and also the growing Christian churches in Japan, China, India, Africa, Egypt, Asia
Minor and South America. lam speaking, therefore, on behalf of another League. Through
the Council, the missionary forces of the Churches in all these countries are effectively correlated for
the purpose of larger co-operation in all matters of common interest.
My principal purpose in asking for the privilege of making this address was to assure the
Conference of the deep interest which all these missionary forces have in your deliberations and
decisions. Our prayers are that the Conference may be splendidly successful. We hope that
its proposals, when duly ratified, will make possible a more rapid progress in the effective control
of the traffic in these dangerous drugs. The results of the Conference will be carefully reported
to the Council and to all the national missionary organisations that it represents, and the Con-
ference may be assured in advance of the strong support of all these forces in every advance
step that you propose.
May I remind you that this interest on our part is not a recent or temporary development?
The missionaries are intimately acquainted with the evil effects of the non-medicinal use of opium
and other drugs in the countries where they are at work. For many years they have been engaged
in anti-opium work. In China they organised associations for this purpose. They were greatly
encouraged by the action of the Philippines Government in 1903, and in 1904 they made an appeal
to the Government of the United States of America for assistance. You will find a record of the
history of that movement in House Document No. 380, Sixty-eighth Congress, First Session,
page 245.
Again, it was as a missionary bishop in the Philippine Islands that Bishop Brent made the
appeal to President Roosevelt in 1906. As the result of these repeated appeals, the Opium
Conference in Shanghai was called, which, in turn, was followed by the three Conferences at The
Hague, and now by these two Opium Conferences in Geneva. This Conference, therefore, is
carrying forward the work begun in a very humble way by our missionaries. As we may claim
to have begun this work, and as we have continued our efforts through all these years, so we shall
persistently and untiringly persevere to the end until mankind is freed from this great physical
and moral evil. That is the goal, and we shall not rest until we reach it, however long and difficult
the way may be, for Right will win. The representatives of the Press who are here are a very
powerful influence, but when their report of your daily proceedings are forgotten, the missionary
forces will still be hard at work trying to do all within their power to realise the purposes for which
this Conference has been called.
It is not for us to suggest the governmental measures that ought now to be jointly under-
taken by the nations represented here. We have studied carefully the reports of the Advisory
Opium Committee and the report of the Committee preparatory to this Conference. We have
noted with satisfaction the proposed measures which it is hoped will provide for a more effective
control over the traffic in manufactured drugs, but we have with regret failed to find similar pro-
visions to restrict the production of the raw materials. We know that this production is strictly
controlled in India, and we have the promise of that Government to reduce the production as
rapidly as the demands made by other Governments for raw opium decrease.
We are looking expectantly to this Conference to answer two questions, besides adopting
the measures recommended by the Advisory Committee. These two questions are: (1) What
measures does the Conference recommend to the other producing countries for the more effective
control of production? (2) What measures does the Conference recommend to the countries
importing raw opium for the reduction of their import requirements?
We hesitate to discuss such questions, for we are not expert in them. We venture to mention
them only because it is generally agreed that the only successful way of dealing with these problems
will be by dealing with them at their source, which is in the producing countries. So long as the
production of these raw materials exceeds ten times the legitimate needs of the world, is there
any hope of relief?
Returning now to the sphere of our own work, I may say that the methods which we have
used and shall endeavour to develop are educational. We try to teach men the evil effects of


the misuse of these drugs and to awaken their consciences and to strengthen their self-respect
so that they will not succumb to the temptation of these vices. We try to arouse and organise
public opinion, on the one hand, to encourage the individual in his resistance to these temptations,
and, on the other hand, to support the Governments in the enaclment and enforcement of restric-
tive measures.
To speak concretely, I may refer to China. Sir John Jordan, whose name we always mention
with great respect, has repeatedly given public testimony to the valuable assistance given by
the Christian forces in the anti-opium movement in that great country. We are not idle now
in the unfortunate circumstances of political disorder in China. The last Sunday of last
September was observed as an anti-opium Sunday, and suitable literature was sent to over 8,000
churches and chapels in all the provinces of China. We have shared in the organisation of the
National Anti-Opium Association of China, whose representative ?M. Koo has just spoken
to you. If I may, I would gladly associate myself with all that he has said. I have known
M. Koo for a number of years. I know something of the work he is doing in China. I honour
him as a man worthy of all respect earnest, capable, and an inspiring leader. Having lived
in China for about 20 years, I know something also of some of the other leaders in this Association
and of the organisations tha\t are co-operating in it. On that basis of personal knowledge and
also of reports that I have received from China both in personal letters and in the public Press,
I hope ?we cannot prophesy, but we have good reasons for hoping that this Association will,
in the comparatively short time of a few years, succeed in reawakening those forces in the people
of China which will not only restore China to the proud position which she occupied in 1917 but
will do more in firmly establishing the reform so that another relapse cannot recur.
Then, as the delegates of the Netherlands know, we are proposing active educational work
in the Netherlands Indies. In such efforts, if well conceived, we look confidently for the support
of the Government.
Again, in the countries of Persia and Turkey, we are making similar plans. Within the
last week, I have received important letters from missionaries in Persia regarding this subject.
Of India, I need not speak at length, for Mr. MacLennan will speak on behalf of the Mis-
sionary Conference of Great Britain and Ireland. A printed pamphlet will also be distributed
to the members of the Conference explaining the purposes of the Christian forces in that land,
as they are endeavouring to teach the people of India the evil of giving opium to babies, to abandon
the vice where the use of opium is a mere addiction, and to substitute more beneficial drugs m
cases of illness. We believe that in such educational work we shall have the unqualified support
of the Government of India. These pamphlets have been sent to this Conference with the consent
of that Government, although it received them too late to express any opinion regarding their
contents. By request of the Indian Government the pamphlets are being sent to all the Pro-
vincial Governments in India. We have gladly recognised the efficiency with which the Govern-
ment of India controls both the production and distribution of opium, with the result that the
consumption of opium in India compares very favourably with that in many other countries,
as the statistics of the Advisory Committee show. We rejoice in this further evidence of the
Government?s approval of well-considered efforts to educate public opinion in India with a view
to the further reduction of consumption and without any regard to the bearing of this upon
fiscal questions.
In passing, I may add that, while we undertake this anti-opium work as part of our duty as
Christian missionaries, making our message in this way one of genuine good will to the people
whom we strive to serve, we at the same time endeavour to co-operate with the adherents of
other religious faiths.
The abuse of opium and other drugs is a moral evil, in combating which there is no difference
of opinion between Christians and Confucianists, or Buddhists, or Hindus, or Moslems, or any
other men of high moral purposes.
I need not describe in detail what we have attempted to do in the countries of Europe and
America in support of the measures adopted by these Governments. Especially in the United
States and in Great Britain the missionary forces have actively associated themselves with other
forces in the community in support of every advance step that has been taken in recent legislation
on this subject.
As for the principles which underlie these anti-opium activities, I could quote from many
statements adopted at various times not only by the International Missionary Council but also
by the national missionary organisations in Europe and America, China, India, and other countries,
and by many church assemblies. One reference will suffice for our purposes to-day. In the
hearings before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives of the United
States (see page 25 of House Document No. 380, Sixty-eighth Congress, First Session), Rev. Edwin
C. Lobenstine, one of the secretaries of the National Christian Council of China, which represents
the Chinese Churches and also the European and American missionaries, said:
?The opium traffic has been one of the serious hindrances to the work of the Christian
Church in China, inasmuch as one of the main arguments which we have for the spiead
of Christianity is our high ethnical standards and the feeling that it will improve the moral
condition of the people, and yet, in the eyes of the people in China, the white race is morally
responsible, directly responsible, for the introduction and the spread of the opium habit
in China. Of course, I take it that there is no use of speaking of the demoralising influence
of those using opium.
Because, therefore, it hinders our Christian missionary purposes, and again because it demo-
ralises all those who use it in an abusive way, we are unalterably opposed to, and wes hall not rest


in our efforts in assisting Governments to bring to an end, the illegitimate traffic in opium and
other drugs of addiction. .
We believe the legitimate traffic is correctly defined in the resolutions of the Advisory Opium
Committee and adopted by the Assembly and Council of the League of Nations in 1923. We
believe that the use of opium and other dangerous drugs should be restricted entirely and without
reservation to medicinal and scientific purposes. Further, we would urge that the production
of opium and coco-leaves should be limited, so that there will be no surplus that can be used
for other purposes. . . _ T7
We rejoice that this Conference has been called on the basis of these two principles. We
trust that the Conference may be splendidly successful in adopting measures to be recommended
to the various Governments that shall bring these principles into practical application at an early
date. , . ,
Mr. President and members of the Conference, I beg leave to thank you again for this oppor-
tunity of appearing before you to explain in this brief statement our great and abiding interest
in the work in which you will be engaged in these coming days, and to express our respect for
you and the Governments whom you represent and with whom we desire to co-operate in such
ways as are right and within our power. We may quote the words spoken by Bishop Brent
last year:
? ? The time has come for action on one of the great moral questions of our times, and the
tide of opportunity runs high. We are in the valley of decision. There are but two alter-
natives. As Lord Grey has said: ?The nations must learn or perish?.? (Applause.)

STATEMENT BY Mr. MACLENNAN
(Conference of Missionary Societies in Great Britain and Ireland).
Mr. MacLennan (Conference of Missionary Societies in Great Britain and Ireland). Mr. Pre-
sident and members of the Conference, I wish to thank you for this opportunity of addressing
such a distinguished Conference. I speak on behalf of the Annual Conference of Missionary
Societies in Great Britain and Ireland, which includes in its membership 51 societies working
in every land concerned with the limitation of the opium traffic. These societies expend �2,500,000
sterling each year on their work. They have sent out about 5,000 missionaries to all these lands.
These missionaries are not mere propagandists; they give disinterested service to the peoples
of the lands in which they work medical, educational and philanthropic and they areearnestly
concerned with everything that makes for the welfare or for the ill of these peoples, they seek
to accord to all the Governments of the countries in which they work that due loyalty which
these Governments have the right to expect from their guests.
I think I would be consulting your wishes this afternoon if I did not speak at any length,
and, to save time, I should like to associate myself entirely with all Dr. Wamhms has said to
you* and to associate myself with what he has said on behalf of the British missionary societies.
I and the British missionary societies heartily support the suggestions made by the United states
of America. We wholeheartedly support the suggestions of your Advisory Committee, out
we venture to hope that the larger proposals may be discussed, and possibly a solution come to
along their lines. , . . , ,?
I observe, in the proposal submitted to the Conference, the omission of any suggestion o
figures concerning the growth of raw opium in the various countries where opium is grown an
we venture to hope that the Conference may see its way, in any convention which 1 ormu a es,
to include this matter, or at least to include statistics of growth so far as they can be ascertame
or estimated. The missionary societies which I represent and the Christian churches wi wic
they work look with much expectation to this Conference. They will heartily support, m tne
different countries, all wise proposals to effect restriction within a reasonable peno o eus
of opium and its derivatives to medical and scientific purposes. u
Representing British missionary societies, I should specially desire to associa e myse
all that Dr. Warnhuis has said about the Government of India. I wish to thank bir Malcolm
Delevingne and Mr. Campbell for the declarations which they made this morning, and, witn
your permission, Mr. President, I would specially extend thanks to the Bn is ovemm ,
speaking as the representative of British missionary societies, to the Indian Governmen a
the Governments of the British Colonies for the legislative and administrative action which they
have taken from time to time to regulate and to limit the traffic m opium. WIS ,1
them of our full support in every further effort which they may make, and of our sincere ele
earnest purpose with which they have come to this Conference, and I would like to say to them
and to all of you here that we missionary societies and the churches which we represen
mission field will do everything we can to create, in every possible way, a pub ic opmion[a equa
to support any convention which this distinguished Conference may seek to a op.
Mr. President, I thank you for the privilege which has been accorded me of addressing this
Conference, [Applause.)

STATEMENT BY MONSIGNOR EUGENE BEAUPIN
(Union Catholique des Etudes Internationales).
Monsignor Eugene Beaupin (President of the Catholic Union for International Studies):
Translation: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the Catholic Union for International Studies,
which has adherents in some ten European countries adherents who themselves represent
great Catholic organisations and which was founded in 1920 to enlist the sympathies of
Catholics in the work of the League of Nations, desires to thank you for the honour which you
have today bestowed upon it in allowing its delegate to address you.
The Union fully realises the importance of the humanitarian object of the present Conference
and earnestly desires that it will be successful.
It is, in particular, anxious that a convention should be adopted containing provisions which
will prove effective in checking the ravages due to the unlawful use of opium and narcotic drugs.
It will freely and gladly employ in this cause all the influence which it possesses with Catholics
alike in Europe and China, Japan, India, and the United States, to secure their co-operation in
carrying out the Convention once it has been adopted, or in any propaganda work which may be
undertaken with a view to educating public opinion on the subject. {Applause.)
Annex 11.
STATEMENT BY Mr. ALEXANDER
(Society of Friends).
Mr. Alexander (Society of Friends): Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pri-
vilege to have the opportunity of addressing this Conference. I thank you for giving me the oppor-
tunity.
The Society of Friends (or Quakers) in Great Britain, although it cannot claim to speak
with the authority of a large membership, has carefully followed the developments regarding
the opium and drug trade during the past eighty years. My father Mr. J. G. Alexander
who visited India with the Opium Commission of 1894 and twice visited China in connection
with the opium traffic, represented the Society of Friends at the Hague Opium Conference in 1912.
The Executive Committee of this Society has sent me to Geneva to place before the members
of this Conference proposals which, we venture to hope, may commend themselves as essentially
reasonable and practicable.
In summarised form, our proposals are two: first, that this Conference should agree to a
Convention limiting the use of opium and other drugs within a specified period to strictly medical
and scientific requirements; secondly, that all Governments in whose territory opium and other
drug-producing plants are grown should agree to a policy of strict control and gradual reduction
in the growth of these plants, the proportion finally to be allowed in each country to be fixed
by agreement, and the limit of the period of reduction to be specified.
The former ot these proposals is clearly anticipated in the agenda of this Conference and was
emphasised in the President?s speech. The latter does not seem to be quite so clearly indicated,
but it is, in our view, more fundamental. We are alive to the difficulties which stand in the way
of this policy. We believe they can be overcome as soon as good will and the desire for mutual
assistance take the place of mutual suspicion.
With regard to the first proposal, we conceive that it is the duty of every civilised Government
to provide for an adequate medical service throughout its territories. By ? adequate ?we do not
necessarily mean a medical service entirely composed of graduates of universities. The provision
of this service could be effected within twenty years at the outside, but in fifteen or ten in the
case of efficient and energetic Governments.
As to the second proposal, it seems clear that no other policy can ever be really successful
in rooting out the evils of drug addiction. The excessive precautions found necessary by some
Governments at the present day in their efforts to check the illicit drug traffic could be modified,
to the convenience of the medical profession and the benefit of many sufferers, if the excess of
opium production were cut away. The nations of East and West would alike benefit if produc-
tion of opium were reduced to medical and scientific needs alone.
It would mean the sacrifice of an important source of revenue. Various authorities have
admitted, however, that alternative sources of revenue can be found. Welcome evidence of this


is to be seen in the sacrifice by the Indian Government of five million pounds worth of revenue
formerly derived from the trade with China. This has also shown that the land upon which
opium is grown can be used for crops that are of greater benefit to man. The added physical
and moral welfare of all the nations consequent upon such a change is a still more important asset.
In some countries better factory conditions as well as a better medical service would be needed.
As British citizens, the members of the Society of Friends have naturally given most atten-
tion to the policy of the British Government, and, where opium production is concerned, to India.
We are glad to note that the Government of India is the one producing Government in the world
which has given real effect to the Hague Convention of 1912; if the other producing Governments
had acted with equal vigour, the position which faces this Conference would, we believe, be far
more hopeful than it is now. Nevertheless, we are not wholly satisfied with the position in India,
nor with the policy of the British Colonial Office, which continues to allow the Colonial Govern-
ments for which it is responsible in the East to import quantities of Indian opium which is notori-
ously used for addiction.
The Indian Government, for whose policy we cannot escape our share of responsibility,
according to the figures published by the League of Nations, still grows far more poppy than is
necessary for legitimate needs. Even according to its own interpretation of the word ?legitimate
there is evidence of serious opium addiction among adults in Assam and some other provinces.
It is notorious that thousands of babies of factory workers are doped in the great cities, and,
as we have already pointed out, quantities of opium are exported under the certificate system
to other countries of the East where it is known it will be used for smoking.
It may be claimed that most of these criticisms affect matters of purely domestic concern.
To this we would reply that the present unhappy situation in China goes far to prove that any
over-production of opium must lead to illicit trafficking; moreover, in our view, the League of
Nations, as in the case of the traffic in women and children, has the duty to assist in the protec-
tion of all peoples from social evils. .
There is evidence of a rising tide of opinion in India in opposition to the policy hitherto
pursued by the Indian Government. The All-India Congress Committee, consisting of some
sixty national leaders, unanimously adopted the following resolution in June this year:
?In the opinion of the A.I.C.C, the opium policy of the Government of India is alto-
gether contrary to the moral welfare of the people of India and other countries. The
A.I.C.C. is further of the opinion that the people of India would welcome the total abolition of
the opium traffic for purposes of revenue and is also of the opinion that the production of
opium is out of all proportion to the medical requirements of India. ?
Mr. Gandhi and Dr. Rabindranath Tagore have made clear in public statements that they
hold a similar view.
Since coming into this room this afternoon I have received a telegram from Mr. Gandhi,
which says:
?Please tell Convention all India wants complete stoppage opium traffic save for medical
purposes.
Proposals have been approved by some of the Provincial Councils of India showing their
desire for a further reduction of the revenue derived from opium. Although these Councils, under
the new Indian Constitution, have some authority over internal opium policy, it is not clear
whether their desires will be placed before this Conference.
Decrease of production in India was proposed by British official representatives in the Far
East as the one effective cure for the abuse of drugs as long ago as 1835 (Sir G. Robinson) and
1837 (Captain Elliot). We believe it is still the one effective cure.
We trust that the Government of India will declare its readiness to accept some scale of
reduction of poppy cultivation in the hope that other countries will be ready to act with it. And
in any case the Indian Government might still consider and we hope it will consider whether
wise statesmanship and Christian principle do not demand from it a further lead in this direction.
{Applause.)

STATEMENT BY THE REV. E. J. DUKES
(Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade).
Rev. E. J. Dukes (Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade, Great Britain). Mr.
President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, as preceding speakers have done, to thank you as members
of this Conference for your courtesy in permitting me to come to say a few words this afternoon.
I notice that the programme of business for the afternoon has superannuated me, my name does
not appear upon the list, and no wonder, as it is fifty years this year since I delivered my first
public address upon this subject.


I have the honour to represent the original Anti-Opium Society, which began, just fifty
years ago, the seemingly impossible task of suppressing the trade in opium between India and
China a work which was achieved in March 1917. Since that date the Society has continued
its campaign against the misuse of drugs of addiction, bringing within the range of its efforts
every phase of what is now recognised as a world-wide evil.
There are just two or three points to which I desire respectfully to call your attention, not
referring to a large number of matters which are of great interest to ourselves but pointing out
the point of view which this society has always had. First, that, having been connected with
the Society for forty-three years, and intimately associated with its proceedings for as long as
twenty-one years, I can testify that during the whole of the half-century of its operations the
Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade has steadfastly held to the principle that the prob-
lem of these dangerous drugs is primarily and chiefly a moral one. It has, indeed, always pro-
moted and welcomed Parliamentary and Governmental action, but it has never lost sight of the
moral and humanitarian interest involved. The same may be said of the various similar agencies
in Great Britain and America, with which we have gladly co-operated.
We have treated with becoming respect the views of those who differ from us, but we have
never had reason to doubt that our supreme duty was to awaken the moral conscience of the
world on this grave moral question.
A second point is that in England one comparatively rarely meets with anyone holding a
different view from ours. We feel sure that the bulk of the public opinion of Great Britain is
behind us and supporting us. All the best elements of our country are in favour of drastic action
and speedy reduction in the output of opium and cocaine to such medical and scientific limits
as will render these drugs the blessing Providence intended them to be, and to restrain them from
being the curse they have become.
And there is a third point that I wish to state with equal brevity: that there must be only
one standard of morality for the world and not two standards not one for the West and another
for the East not one, shall we say, for England and another for India. What is forbidden
and punished with severity in Western lands must not be excused, defended and promoted
in the East.
If I may mention just one point to show how public opinion is sometimes distracted and
distressed by what it reads and hears, it was only a few months ago that there was great excite-
ment in the Press in London because a man had been caught selling hashish. It was regarded
as simply a crime to do that, and yet there are ten thousand shops in India for the sale of hashish
and bhang, besides nearly 7,000 for the sale of opium.
I ask leave to present at this point a petition to the Assembly on behalf of 400 people who
have signed it, representing societies and organisations making a total of over 206,000 people in
India who are in favour of stopping the opium trade.
It is very interesting to observe that the first name upon this list is that of Mahatma Gandhi;
C. F. Andrews follows, with Ramananda Chatterjee, Sir Rabindranath Tagore, the poet and social
reformer, and others. I have to present to you, Mr. President, that address. May I just be per-
mitted to read what it says at the beginning. This is what they say:
?The undersigned, viewing in the growing addiction to narcotic drugs a deadly menace
to individuals and to nations an insidious rapidly spreading poisoning of the human race,
which can be overcome only by co-operation among all nations, respectfully petition the
International Opium Conference, assembling in November 1924, to adopt measures adequate
for the total extirpation of the the plants from which they originate except as found necessary
for medicine and science in the judgment of the best medical opinion of the world.?
It has been said that the Indian people are careless and indifferent in regard to the whole
question, but in September last, as was mentioned by the last speaker, the All-India Congress
Committee passed a resolution condemning the trade root and branch. In the same month a
meeting was held in Calcutta, at which the Bishop of Calcutta proposed a resolution quite as
stringent, and other news which has come within the last two months from various parts of
India shows that we may expect from the Indian people themselves that they will take up this
question and make it their own, and will do what they can to endeavour to get their Government
to fall into line with what this Conference proposes.
Mr. President, the society I represent realises that this Conference has the opportunity of
becoming a great blessing to mankind. You are here, we believe, not to debate technicalities
but rather to unite in the effort to save the human race from an appalling evil. On the practical
side, we of the Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade believe that the immediate need
is an international agreement to limit output in the producing countries, and, on the idealistic
side, to keep steadily before the mind the duties of humanitarianism and of moral obligation.
It seems to us that only as and when this is accepted by the Conference and becomes a spirit
of its decision will this great and difficult task be accomplished.
Let us remember that there is a Power above and beyond us which, when our principles
are sound and pity for mankind animates us, will make the crooked straight and the rough
places plain, and then that becomes possible, if not easy, which was regarded as beyond human
power to accomplish.
That is the message which my representative board of the Anti-Opium Society desires me
to bring, (Applause.)

STATEMENT BY Mrs. HELEN MOORHEAD
(Foreign Policy Association of America).
Mrs. Helen Moorhead (Foreign Policy Association of America): Mr. President, honourable
delegates, ladies and gentlemen, I speak to this honourable assembly with great diffidence, and
with the more diffidence because I have to thank you for this opportunity in the name of an
association the Foreign Policy Association of America which comprises as members as many
men as women. In view of the somewhat heated discussion during the First Conference on the
equality of the sexes that equality residing, if I remember rightly, in the right for women to
enter smoking divans I hesitate rather to ask indulgence from this body on that ground;
rather may I suggest that the work done by the Foreign Policy Association and by its Committee
on Opium be considered as an example of co-operation between men and women, all interested
in those aspects of foreign affairs which touch the welfare of America. May I point out, as uphold-
ing this point of view for my country, the presence of Mrs. Hamilton Wright as an official delegate
of the United States.
Our Committee approaches this opium problem, therefore, from the point of view of the
International Treaty on the subject. We are also interested in it as that point on which the
United States has made the most dignified and the most official connection with the League
of Nations. I refer particularly to the situation which has been legalised by the work done by
the Honourable Mr. Porter in passing through both Houses of Congress an appeal making it legal
for the United States to be represented at this Conference. It is^the^first time that such legisla-
tion has passed both Houses of Congress in America.
I say that our Committee approached this question from the international and from the
political standpoint, but before very long we found ourselves advocates of the Treaty because
of the evil which it endeavours to control. The anti-opium habit is almost as hard to get rid
of as the opium habit; when once in this battle, one must go on to the end.
The aim of our Committee is to give information in the United States of the work done in
the control of this evil under the auspices of the League of Nations. We inform first ourselves
of the facts as accurately as may be, and then others. We try to understand the difficulties
under which each country works, and when points in dispute arise we give publicity to the official
statements of the countries concerned. As a means of information, we have frequent comments
and criticisms written in our weekly bulletin. We send out digests of facts at intervals to important
newspa ers and news agencies all through the country. We send speakers to clubs and organisa-
tions of all sorts.
There is the most real interest in America on this subject. I wish to support the remarks
made by Bishop Brent yesterday in regard to the resolutions sent to the American delegation
from various American organisations. Among them is, I know, one from the General Federation
of Women?s Clubs ?an organisation of many millions of women in America. Let me tell you
how real is the interest behind these formal resolutions in certain parts of the country. The
farmers? wives in the State of Vermont asked me to come to speak to them about the international
control of opium. Why? Imagine the farmers? wives in almost any other country of the world
asking for information on this fact. The woman who is the president of that branch for the State
of Vermont of the General Federation of Women?s Clubs runs a chemist?s shop, or what we would
call in America a drug store. Her husband grew ill and she took over his business. She found
out at first hand the number of drugs addicts in that little farming community. When she
refused to sell them drugs they procured their supplies from smugglers, who, despite the best
efforts of the Canadian Government and of our police, plied a thriving trade at that part of the
border. She said to herself: ?There must be some international agreement to control this situation;
what are they doing in Geneva?? and so she asked me to come and tell them.
A group of coloured women asked me to come and speak toth<m the very day I sailed from
New York City. I could give you literally hundreds of requests for speeches and information
from the most diverse groups and localities. When the American delegation quietly says Public
interest is aroused in America ? it means literally that thousands of ears are listening eagerly
to hear what results, what advances, you are able to accomplish on this subject, on which each
one of these little local clubs has passed a resolution. Think of it this salle vitree in Geneva,
this hall of open diplomacy, surrounded by an unseen, waiting, listening multitude!
To return to our Committee. We have tried to help the application in the United States
of those suggestions which have been made by the Council of the League on the advice of the
Advisory Committee, such as their request regarding heroin, or the per capita amount of opium
for medical and scientific needs. We are at present engaged in an investigation regarding the punish-
ment given to pedlars of drugs in the different States of the Union. The suggestion regarding
increased punishment originated, I believe, through the delegate of France to the Advisory Com-
mittee, M. Bourgois.
This explains the work of our Association. In all that concerns the general principles of
the whole problem, there is no need for me to speak. The Opium Committee of the Foreign
Policy Association of America supports entirely the programme of the delegation of the United
States of America. We find there suggestions which may be grouped into nine important points:


1. Suggestions for amendments to the Treaty regarding the smoking of opium that
mean a real advance, notably a ten per cent reduction for ten years;
2. Suggestions for publicity regarding statistics of production;
3. That figure divided into domestic use and amount for export;
4. The import and export certificate expanded and completed so that it approaches
more nearly the plan as originally suggested to the Advisory Committee by Sir Malcolm
Delevingne; .
5. The establishment of a Central Board, with a practical plan for an Executive Com-
mittee of permanent officials;
6. The prohibition of the manufacture of heroin;
7. The prohibition of shipment unless covered by an import and export certificate;
8. Provisions regarding warehousing and free zones;
9. All this is based on a preamble that goes to the bottom of the problem.
This last point is the important one of all.
Gentlemen, the whole story is before you. Whether you find it possible to take it or to leave
it, the world now knows what should be done.
We are proud that public opinion in America has found such able and worthy woices.
In conclusion, may I add one word, speaking almost personally. Whatever conclusions
you arrive at, whatever treaties you frame, will you examine each clause with this idea in mind:
How will it affect the future ? For it is to protect the younger generation from our mistakes
and from those of our ancestors that you are here, and here under the roof of the League of
Nations, where there is moving and germinating an idea for the future that gives all hope. (Loud
applause.)

STATEMENT BY Mrs. JEANNE STURGES
(The White Cross of America).
Mrs. Jeanne Sturges (the White Cross of America): Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen,
I hope you will not be startled by the size of this parcel of papers which I have in my hand, but
I only intend to keep you one minute by the clock.
Owing to the illness of Canon Bliss (who is in hospital in Geneva), the President of the White
Cross Society an international anti-narcotic society which has been active in its determination
to rid the world of the drug evil I bring to this distinguished body a petition signed by more
than 336,000 men and women in America. Many more thousands of signatures to this petition
are on the way, but they have not yet been received, and I shall beg leave to present them also
when they arrive. These people represent thinkers on sociological, economic and international
affairs, and are looking to this Conference not only for sincerity in action but for significant results.
I will just give you the words at the top of the petition:
?The undersigned, viewing in the growing addiction to narcotic drugs a deadly menace
to individuals and to nations, an insidious, rapidly spreading poisoning of the human race,
which can be overcome only by co-operation among all nations, respectfully petition the
International Opium Conference assembling in November 1924 to adopt measures adequate
for the total extirpation of the plants from which they originate, except as found necessary
for medicine and science, in the judgment of the best medical opinion of the world.
I wish to thank you, on behalf of the White Cross Society of America, for permitting me to
give you this petition. (Applause.)

States of America. We wholeheartedly support
the suggestions of your Advisory Committee,
but we venture to hope that the larger pro-
posals may be discussed and possibly a solution
come to along their lines.
In summarised form our proposals are two:
first, that this Conference should agree to a
Convention limiting the use of opium and other
drugs within a specified period to strictly
medical and scientific requirements.


Limit production, manufacture, distribution
and use of opium and its derivatives. (15)
Limit cultivation of poppy and coca plants
to medical and scientific needs of the world.
National legislation to limit manufacture to
medical and scientific needs. (17)
Co-operation of all nations to control pro-
duction, manufacture and sale of opium and
narcotics. (18)
Limit production of opium, cocaine, etc.,
to amount required for medical and scientific
purposes. (18)
Supports entirely the American proposal. (8)
The Conference of Missionary Societies wel-
comes the efforts of the League of Nations to
reduce the evils arising from the use of opium
and its derivatives. At a recent meeting of
the Standing Committee of the Conference
it was resolved to urge the adoption of further
constructive proposals for limiting the pro-
duction, manufacture, distribution and use of
opium and its derivatives and to express its
desire to assist in advancing progress in that
direction.
To control this traffic through international
agreement by [a) limiting the cultivation of the
commercial poppy and the coca plant to the
medicinal and scientific needs of the world,
and by ( b) enacting and enforcing adequate
national legislation, making illegal all manu-
facture and trade in these drugs in excess of
the needs of science and medicine.
We believe co-operation by all nations in con-
trolling production, manufacture and sale of
opium and its allied narcotics is the most
effective way to deal with this menace.
To secure an agreement among all nations to
limit the production of opium and its deriva-
tives and of cocaine strictly to the amount
required by scientific and medicinal purposes.
The Opium Committee of the Foreign Policy
Association of America supports entirely the
programme of the delegation of the United States
of America/ We find there suggestions which
may be grouped into nine important points;
1. The completion of the work of the Advi-
sory or other Committee in fixing the narcotic
requirement of every country, and the tabula-
tion of this requirement for general inspection
and possible alteration from time to time. (19)
5. We find the establishment of a Central
Board with a practical plan for an Executive
Committee of permanent officials. (8)
9. All this is based on a preamble that goes
to the bottom of the problem. This last point
is the most important one of all. (8)
Limitation to Medical Needs implies the Establishment of adequate Medical Services.
Each country to provide an adequate med-
ical service throughout its territories to be
effected within 24 years at outside and within
15 or ten years in case of better organised
governments. (5)
With regard to the first proposal we conceive
that it is the duty of every civilised Govern-
ment to provide for an adequate medical ser-
vice throughout its territories. By ?? adequate
we do not necessarily mean a medical service
entirely composed of graduates of universities.
The provision of this service could be effected
within 20 years at the outside, but in 15 or
10 in the case of efficient and energetic Govern-
ments.
Control of Illicit Traffic depends upon Limitation of Production and Manufacture.
The most effective way to check this illicit
traffic is to check it in the countries where it
originates by limiting production and manu-
facture. (1)
We wish to ask the Conference to recognise
the principle that the illicit traffic in these
drugs cannot be limited until the production
and manufacture is first brought under control
and that the most effective way to check this
illicit trade is to check it in the countries
where it originates.


Limitation of Production of Raw Materials.
Approves measures for control of manufac-
tured drugs contained in Advisory Committee
and Preparatory Committee plans but regrets
that similar measures not proposed to restrict
production of raw materials. (2)
Control of production. (2)
Control production of raw opium in such a
manner that there will be no surplus available
for non-medical and non-scientific purposes. (15)
We have studied carefully the reports of the
Opium Advisory Committee and the report
of the Committee Preparatory to this Con-
ference. We have noted with satisfaction the
proposed measures which it is hoped will pro-
vide for a more effective control over the
traffic in manufactured drugs, but we have
with regret failed to find similar provisions
to restrict the production of the raw materials.
We are looking expectantly to this Confe-
rence to answer two questions, besides adopting
the measures recommended by the Advisory
Committee. These two questions are: (1) What
measures does the Conference recommend to
the other producing countries for the more
effective control of production ? (2) What
measures does the Conference recommend to
the countries importing raw opium for the
reduction of their import requirements ? We
hesitate to discuss such questions, for we are
not expert in them. We venture to mention
them only because it is generally agreed that
the only successful w r ay of dealing with these
problems will be by dealing with them at their
source, which is in the producing countries. So
long as the production of these raw materials
exceeds ten times the legitimate needs of the
world, is there any hope of relief ?
The Conference of Missionary Societies wel-
comes the forthcoming Conference at Geneva
and ventures to express the hope that definite
steps may be taken in the direction indicated.
It would urge that practical steps should be
taken to make effective the recognised prin-
ciples that the use of opium products for
other than medical and scientific purposes is
an abuse and not legitimate, and that, in
order to prevent the use of these drugs, it is
necessary to exercise the control of the pro-
duction of raw opium in such a manner that
there will be no surplus available for non-
medical and non-scientific purposes.
Collection and Publication of Statistics of the Production of Raw Materials
I observe in the proposal submitted to the
Conference the omission of any suggestion or
figures concerning the growth of raw opium
in the various countries where opium is grown,
and I venture to hope that the Conference
may see its way, in any Convention which it
formulates, to include this matter, or at least
to include statistics of growth so far as they
can be ascertained or estimated.
Statistics of growth of raw opium. (3)
(2) We find suggestions for publicity re-
garding statistics of production. (8)
(3) We find that figure divided into domestic
use and amount for export. (8)
Limitation of the Production of Opium and Coca Leaf to the Worlds' Requirements
for Medical and Scientific Purposes.
We believe the legitimate traffic is correctly
defined in the resolutions of the Advisory Com-
mittee and adopted by the Assembly and
Council of the League of Nations in 1923. We
believe that the use of opium and other danger-
ous drugs should be restricted entirely and
without reservation to medicinal and scientific
Legitimate traffic. (2)
Limitation without reservation to medicinal
and scientific purposes. (2)
Limit production so that there is no surplus
for other purposes. (2)


(a) Producing countries to strictly control
and gradually reduce growth; (6) proportion
between countries to be fixed; (c) limit of
period of reduction to be specified. (5)
International agreement to limit produc-
tion. (6)
Limit production to medical and scientific
needs as determined by best medical opinion. (7)
Co-operation among all nations. (9)
Measures adequate for limiting raw materials
to medical and scientific needs as determined
by the best medical opinion of the world. (9)
Limit world production to medical and
scientific needs. (10)
Smuggling cannot be controlled unless pro-
duction of all countries limited so that total
world requirements for medical and scientific
purposes shall not be exceeded. (10)
Limit production to medical and scientific
purposes. (13)
purposes. Further, we would urge that the
production of opium and coca leaves should
be limited so that there will be no surplus
that can be used for other purposes.
...secondly, that all Governments in whose
territory opium and other drug-producing
plants are grown should agree to a policy of
strict control and gradual reduction in the
growth of these plants, the proportion finally
to be allowed in each country to be fixed by
agreement and the limit of the period of reduc-
tion to be specified.
The Society for the Suppression of the Opium
Trade believes that the immediate need is an
international agreement to limit output in the
producing countries.
To adopt measures adequate for the total
extirpation of the plants from which they
(narcotic drugs) originate except as found
necessary for medicine and science in the
judgment of the best medical opinion of the
world. (7)
The undersigned, viewing in the growing
addiction to narcotic drugs a deadly menace
to individuals and to nations, an insidious,
rapidly spreading poisoning of the human race,
which can be overcome only by co-operation
among all nations, respectfully petition the
International Opium Conference assembling in
November 1924 to adopt measures adequate
for total extirpation of the plants from which
they originate, except as found necessary for
medicine and science, in the judgment of the
best medical opinion of the world.
We heartily approve the purpose of the
Committees and Sub-Committees of the League
of Nations to determine the legitimate require-
ments of various countries in regard to narcotic
drugs and to restrict the world production to
the amount actually required for medical and
scientific purposes.
We hereby record our conviction that, owning
to the nature of morphia and the other narcotic
alkaloids, no measures to prevent smuggling
can ever prove efficient, and therefore we
heartily endorse the view that the production
in all countries should be so limited that the
total world requirements for medical and
scientific use of these drugs shall not be ex-
ceeded.
Limitation of the production of the raw
material and the international exchange of
such drugs to quantities required for medicinal
and scientific purposes.
2. The limitation of output. The evil must
be dealt with at its source. Smuggling can
never be prevented otherwise. The quantity
produced is reputed to be ten times greater
than is required medically and scientifically. (19)
Alternative Sources of Revenue can be found.
Various authorities have admitted, however,
that alternative sources of revenue can be found.
Welcome evidence of this is to be seen in the
Alternative sources of revenue can be found


sacrifice by the Indian Government of five
million pounds worth of revenue formerly
derived from the trade with China.
Substitution of other Crops for Opium and Coca Leaves.
Substitution of more beneficial crops on
opium lands. (5)
This has also shown that the land upon
which opium is grown can be used for crops
that are of greater benefit to man. The added
physical and moral welfare of all the nations
consequent upon such a change is a still more
important asset. In some countries better
factory conditions as well as a better medical
service would be needed.
17. Attention to be directed to modes of
replacing poppy and the coca plant by other
crops. The agricultural statement in Rome
affords a basis for discussion. (19)
Reduction of the Export of Coca Leaves.
16. The coca-leaf-producing countries to be
invited to reduce export to the limits which
would bring them within the humanitarian
scope of the decisions of the Conference. (One
quite realises many of the problems involved,
but possibly there is some way of limiting
export). (19)
Restriction of consumption to Medical and Scientific Purposes.
Reduce consumption without regard for
fiscal considerations. (2)
Restriction of the use of opium and its
derivatives within reasonable time to medical
and scientific purposes. (3)
Physicians should exercise care in prescribing
drugs. Require prescription for purchase of
drugs by lay persons. (10)
Limitation of use to medical and scientific
needs. (16)
Well-considered efforts to educate public
opinion with a view to the reduction of consump-
tion, and without any regard to the bearing
of this upon fiscal questions.
They will heartily support in the different
countries all wise proposals to effect restriction
within a leasonable period of the use of opium
and its derivatives to medical and scientific
purposes.
The greatest care should be exercised by
physicians in prescribing such drugs, and that
no lay person should be permitted to purchase
opium in any form except upon the prescrip-
tion of a properly qualified practitioner.
Urge the acceptance of the principle that the
use of opium, cocaine and all dangerous drugs
shall be strictly limited to such legitimate pur-
poses as are required in medicine and science.
World Investigation by the League. Evidence of Medical Men.
The League of Nations to direct its efforts
in an impartial manner ?toward a thorough
investigation of the opium question throughout
the world and toward devising constructive
measures for the permanent eradication of
this evil. ?
Thorough world investigation by the League
of Nations. (14)
Due weight to be given to the testimony of
medical men.
Due weight to be given to the testimony of
medical men as to the deleterious effects of
both smoking and eating opium e.g., the
declaration of 5,000 British doctors; that of


American doctors (as presented by Mrs. H.
Wright); the statement of the Health Com-
mittee of the League of Nations and the recent
Assam Enquiry Committee. (19)
Further, we desire to co-operate with the
League of Nations in whatever other measures
it may recommend for the suppression of the
narcotic drug evil.
Co-operation of medical profession. (10)
Import, Export and Transhipment
Reduce export and import of opium not for
medical or scientific purposes over a period of
ten years. (12)
Limit international exchange to medical and
scientific purposes. (13)
Import and export of opium for other pur-
poses to be steadily reduced and prohibited
as soon as possible, (16)
(4) We find the Import and Export Certi-
ficate expanded and completed so that it
approaches more nearly the plan as originally
suggested to the Advisory Committee by Sir
Malcolm Delevingne.
(7) The prohibition of shipments unless
covered by an Import and Export Certificate. (8)
We find provisions regarding warehousing and
free zones. (8)
That the export and import of opium,
whether raw or prepared, except for medicinal
or scientific purposes, be reduced over a period
of ten years till it is entirely prohibited.
Limitation of the production of the raw
material and the international exchange of
such drugs to quantities required for medicinal
and scientific purposes.
Measures that the export and import of opium,
whether raw or prepared, for other purposes,
shall be steadily reduced and, as soon as pos-
sible, entirely prohibited.
g. Narcotics coming into a country in the
raw state should be under the strict supervision
of a Government official.
18. When drugs go by certification, there
should be no transhipment before they reach
their destination. The prevention of tranship-
ment in transit, say, in mid-ocean, is of extreme
importance. (19)
Chapter II of the International Opium Convention.
Smoking of opium in Far Eastern territories.
Co-operation between these administrations and
China. (1)
(2) The prevention of opium-smoking and the
abuse of morphine, cocaine, etc.
I would like to call the attention of the Con-
ference to the problem of territories and settle-
ments in and near China where people can
still smoke with the sanction of law. Wherever
these territories and settlements exist, it is
essential, for the success of anti-opium measures,
to have complete understanding between the
authorities concerned and administrative co-
operation in addition. It is not unlikely that,
as the work of the National Anti-Opium Asso-
ciation develops, we shall have frequent occa-
sion to have recourse to the colonial and settle-
ment authorities for advice and co-operation,
and I hope that the Governments here present
which have territories in the Far East will
co-operate with us in our work in this respect.
(1) We find suggestions for amendments to
the Treaty regarding the smoking of opium


that mean a real advance, notably a ten per
cent reduction for ten years. (8)
5. A ten per cent per annum reduction of
import of Indian opium by the six Eastern
Governments which receive it, or some other
method of attaining the same end. (19)
15. In territories where the supply of pre-
pared opium is so reduced by these international
agreements that physical suffering may, in a
few cases, follow its withdrawal, medical atten-
dance to be assured to the patients gratuit-
ously. (19)
Propaganda and Educational Activities.
Educational methods. (2)
Returning now to the sphere of our own work,
I may say that the methods which we have used
and shall endeavour to develop are educational.
Publicity for humanitarian principles. (6)
On the idealistic side, to keep steadily before
the mind the duties of humanitarianism and
of moral obligation.
Arouse the people to the seriousness of this
menace. (11)
Suggestions for Amending the International Opium Convention.
(6) The prohibition of the manufacture of
heroin.
Prosecute offenders to the limit of the law. (11)
3. The dropping of the word ?legitimate?
or its definition finally as ? medical and scien-
tific ?.
4. The revision of the Hague Convention,
so that no country which maintains a dangerous
drug trade may be able to defend it under
the terms of the Convention. The spirit, as
well as the letter, should be honoured by obser-
vance. (19)
7. With reserve. I think our Society favours
State monopoly and control the ideal being
prohibition for all except the medical faculty,
(19)
8. No licences for the sale of opium, hashish
and bhang. Licences to be granted only to
individuals in the form of registration. No
other person to be allowed to be in possession
of the drug. (19)
10. Morphia, cocaine and similar drugs should
be stored in a building separate from drugs
which are not drugs of addiction as has been
done in certain British Colonies.
All entries and exits of these drugs to be
severely controlled.
No trade in these except by licence and per-
mit, the amount of purchase and sale being duly
authorised.
11. No trader to be allowed to purchase a
fresh stock until he has satisfactorily accounted
for his former purchase. Nor should any permit
allow of obtaining a stock except for medical
and scientific requirement. (19)


12. (A suggestion of the Peking Association.)
Morphia and similar drugs to be put up in
containers of different sizes, each package in
the series to be lettered and numbered to
facilitate tracing. (9)
13. The refusal.of all supply by international
agreement to any country whose narcotic laws
do not give reason to believe that the drug will
be used only medically and scientifically. (19)
14. Narcotic drugs not be treated as ordinary
articles of commerce, whether in exportation
and importation in transit and tranship-
ment in storage in free ports, free zones
and bonded warehouses.
For all this the Hague Convention, Articles
2, 5> 7* 9 and 10 supply ample suggestions and
direction. (19)
Miscellaneous.
Any reduction in the cultivation and smoking
of opium in China should be accompanied by
effective action regarding the illicit traffic in
narcotics. (1)
Inspection of provinces of China with colla-
boration of foreigners. (1)
Adopt Convention to check ravages of opium
and drugs. (4)
Problem is primarily a moral one. (6)
(3) The illicit trade in narcotics. It is a well-
known fact that the smuggling of morphine
and other dangerous drugs into China is going
on on an extensive scale. It is therefore a
most serious question which we have to face
in our anti-opium work if, in suppressing the
cultivation and smoking of opium in China,
we cannot at the same time deal effectively with
the illicit traffic in narco-ics.
(1) To suppress the planting of opium in
China.
In order to make this inspection quite im-
partial, the National Anti-Opium Association
favours the invitation by them of persons of
recognised standing, of non-Chinese origin, to
be associated with our delegates when they
undertake this annual inspection work.Through
the application of public opinion in China and
abroad in this manner, we hope that the first
item in our programme may reach a successful
issue.
It is, in particular, anxious that a Convention
should be adopted containing provisions which
will prove effective in checking the ravages due
to the unlawful use of opium and narcotic
drugs.
The Society for the Suppression of the
Opium Trade has steadfastly held to the prin-
ciple that the problem of these dangerous
drugs is primarily and chiefly a moral one.
19. The Society for the Suppression of the
Opium Trade has been much impressed by
the petition of 2,000 persons in Malaya (result-
ing in a Commission?s report) and the state-
ment of the Governor of Hong-Kong in No-
vember 1923 that the Colony could afford
to do without the revenue from opium and
would welcome the prohibition of the drug. (19)
20. Encouragement to be given to temper-
ance societies in India, and to leaders of public
opinion in India, to teach the people the evils
of opium-eating.

ing constructive proposals on behalf of the Society for the Suppression of the Opium Trade ?

not a reason for omitting them from a statement of what my Society regards as essential, in

SECOND REPORT OF THE BUSINESS COMMITTEE.
Rapporteur: M. Dinichert.
In accordance with the proposal made by the President of the Conference and accepted by
the latter at its last meeting, the Business Committee met in the morning and the afternoon of
of November 26th, in the presence of the Chairman of the six sub-Committees, for the purpose
of finding, for submission to the Conference, a rational scheme for the division of work between
the First and Second Committees.
The task of the Business Committee thus augmented for this purpose took more time
than had at first been thought likely, since it seemed desirable to proceed to a very full exchange
of views before deciding upon any given method of division of the work.
The discussions led to the conclusion that a general division of work already laid down in the
First Report of the Business Committee appeared to be the best; that is, that Part I of the
?Measures suggested as a basis for the deliberations of the Second Conference ? drawn up by
the Advisory Committee on Opium should form the basis of the First Committees work, while
the Second Committee should base its work upon Part II of the Advisory Committees programme.
The two points in Part HI of the programme would be assigned to the Second Committee.
The Committee next considered in detail the very complete scheme submitted by the United
States delegation with a view to the allocation of the different provisions as between the two
Committees. Hereunder are the proposals which the Business Committee has the honour to
submit to the Conference in this connection.
The question of the definition of ?coca leaves ? is referred to the First Committee.
The first article is reserved that is to say it is not for the moment referred to either of the
Committees. The United States delegation, however, has reserved the right to raise the question
dealt with in the first article of the draft, either in committee or at a plenary meeting of the
Conference.
Articles 2, 2 A, 3 and 4 are referred to the Second Committee.
Chapter 11, including the definition of prepared opium and articles 6, 7 and 8, has been reserved
under the same conditions as Article 1.
The ?definitions ? which constitute the introduction to Chapter 111 of the draft are referred
to the First Committee.
Article 9 is referred to the Second Committee.
Article 9 A, dealing with heroin, is also reserved.
Articles 10, n, 12 and 13 will be examined by the Second Committee. Similarly with
Article 14.
As you know, the American draft contains no proposal regarding Chapter IV of the Hague
Convention of 1912.
Article 20 of Chapter 5 is referred to the Second Committee.
Articles 20 A, 20 B, 20 C, 20 D and 20 E, which refer to the formation of a ?Central Com-
mittee ", will be dealt with by the First Committee.
Article 20 F and Section 111, paragraph 1 of the Advisory Committee?s programme is referred
to the Second Committee.
The Second Committee will also deal with Articles 20 G, 20 H, 20 I, 20 J, 20 K and 20 L.
The Business Committee has not specially examined the Preamble of the American draft
scheme, and has not yet made any proposal with regard to it.
As certain questions have been specifically, or more or less tacitly, reserved, it is understood
that if these questions are raised in Committee or Sub-Committee, any delegation or delegations
objecting to their being discussed will still have an opportunity of putting forward their objection
and asking for the discussion to be referred to the Plenary Conference.
The Business Committee also took cognisance of a number of other proposals, namely:
The Belgian proposal (Doc. O. D. C./C. T./2) referred to the Second Committee.
The Australian proposal (Doc. O. D. C. 20) referred to the First Committee.


The Austrian proposal (Doc. O. D. C. 20 and O. D. C. 20 A) referred to the First
Committee.
The Cuban proposal (Doc. O. D. C. 20, page 2) referred to the First Committee.
Norwegian proposal (Doc. O. D. C. 20, Annex) First proposal referred to the First
Committee; second proposal referred to the Second Committee.
Chinese proposal (Doc. O. D. C. 39) referred to the Second Commitee, with the reser-
vation that if a question of competence should arise, the proposal would be brought
before the Plenary Committee.
The above is the scheme of work proposed by the Business Committee for adoption by the
Conference. Should the latter approve the scheme, each of the two Committees will decide for
itself which questions will be referred to the sub-committee or sub-committees working under it.

Geneva, August 31st, 1924.
(Translation.)
With regard to the annexed report, I am instructed to transmit to you the following obser-
vations, which the Federal Government desires to make in regard to the communications contained
in your circular letters C. L. 5 1924 XI and C. 156 M. 37 1924 XL
The Austrian Government is in agreement with the United States representative s proposal
that the cultivation of the poppy and of the coca leaf should be reduced to the quantity sufficient
for the requirements of medicine and science i.e., to the strict minimum required for legitimate
purposes since the object of the International Opium Convention, which is to prevent the
abuse of opiates, cocaine, etc., can only be attained by a measure of this kind. Hie cultivation
of these plants, or their use for the production of opium, should not, however, be confined to a
restricted number of countries or confined to countries in which opium had hitherto been produced.
Such a restriction would, in the opinion of the Austrian Government, confer an unfair advantage
on certain producing countries, which would thus obtain a monopoly, while the industry of other
countries would be injured.
In the opinion of the Austrian Government, each country should be left to determine the
quantity of narcotics required for medical and scientific purposes in its own territory. As regards
the calculation of a total for world consumption, the Austrian Government sees no
objection to the proposal, on condition that this figure should be drawn up with due regard to
the statistics for the requirements of the various countries over a period of several years.
As regards the uniform definition of all the substances falling under the Opium Convention,
the Austrian Government agrees to abide by that adopted at die Hague Convention of January
23rd, 1912.

Geneva, November 17th, 1924.
The Norwegian Government cannot accede to the provision in accordance with which Govern-
ments would have to submit quarterly statistics of the amounts of the substances m question
imported and exported by them instead of furnishing an annual repoit, as has 11 er o ecu
the practice.


As pharmacies are specially inspected at regular intervals in Norway, and as, moreover,
conditions in that country render supervision of the traffic in these drugs an easy matter, the
Royal Government is of opinion that the annual statistics are amply sufficient for the requirements
of control. There is accordingly every reason to believe that any serious abuse wot?ld speedily
be discovered. The Government therefore considers that, as regards Norway, quarterly reports
which would, moreover, entail a considerable amount of work cannot be regarded as neces-
sary.
Section 11.
V. The Norwegian Government has no objection to the inclusion of ecgonine.
VI. The Norwegian Government cannot accede to the proposal for the deletion of the last
sentence in Article 10 of the Hague Convention if that is to be taken to mean that chemists
would have to enter in their books, together with the name of the purchaser, each consignment
of opium, etc., or of drugs containing the foregoing substances, and to notify the authorities of
the facts. Such a provision would be too drastic and is not essential for the purposes of control.
It would, moreover, appear to be impracticable.
While dealing with this subject, we desire to state that pharmacies in Norway are regularly
inspected by the authorities and that the licence system at present governing the opening of
pharmacies in that country is, from the standpoint of control, equivalent to a State monopoly.

MEMORANDUM
CONCERNING ANNEX I TO DOCUMENT A. 32, 1924. XI, ?MEASURES SUGGESTED AS A BASIS FOR
THE DELIBERATIONS OF THE SECOND CONFERENCE NOVEMBER 1924 ?,
Submitted by the Austrian Government.
When submitting its report for the year 1923, the Federal Government pointed out that in
its opinion the final estimate of the annual consumption in narcotics ought to depend on statistical
observations carried out over a period of several years. In Austria, the Hague Convention has
only been in force since 1921. Consequently the statistics only include the period from September
Ist, 1921. Observations made during this period concerning the traffic in narcotics could not
possibly be held to provide a sufficient basis for estimating the actual requirements of the country.
The Federal Government therefore ventures to propose that the determination of these quantities
should be postponed for at least a year. This would make it possible to complete the observations
which have so far been carried out and provide data on which to determine the actual needs:
{a) for consumption in the country for medical and scientific purposes; [h) for the manufacture
of drugs or of other medical preparations; (c) for foreign trade.
Austria cannot agree to the proposal that every country should undertake not to authorise
the importation of quantities of narcotics greater than those specified in its estimates. The
slightest change in market conditions an epidemic, etc. would suffice to make it impossible
strictly to observe such an undertaking. In the opinion of the Federal Government it is to the
interest of every State if only for reasons of health that the State should control the trade
in drugs and, on its own initiative, prevent all abusive use. On the other hand, a restrictive
measure such as that implied in the above-mentioned undertaking might produce results which
would cause irreparable loss to traders authorised to export these drugs. It is also important
to bear in mind that authorised merchants finding themselves unable (because the quantities
specified in the estimate had been exceeded) to obtain licences for the speedy importation of these
drugs to meet urgent needs might possibly be forced to adopt illegal expedients.
The Federal Government does not consider that it is absolutely necessary to set up a Central
Board composed of experts to supervise the proportion of quantities imported as compared with
those set out in the estimate. Such a Board could only work if the Conference also adopted the new
proposal to the effect that Governments should be bound to furnish every three months statistics
concerning their imports, exports and re-exports to or from every country and every six months
statistics concerning the manufacture of drugs in their country and the amount of the stocks
held by wholesale merchants. All industrial and commercial establishments are at present
overburdened with statistical work and reports of every kind which they are required to furnish
for official and semi-official purposes. A request to furnish the above-mentioned statistics at such
short intervals would certainly give rise to some difficulty. The Federal Government therefore
thinks that it would be better to avoid making it compulsory to furnish these quarterly or half-
yearly reports: the annual reports of each country would provide a sufficient basis for effective
measures against all abuses.
As far as the Federal Government is able to judge, the Advisory Committee on Opium, to
which this work has hitherto been entrusted, has always, when necessary, succeeded in exerting
its influence in the various countries. In the view of the Federal Government, the control of the
traffic in narcotics as exercised by the Committee has given entirely satisfactory results. The
Federal Government is consequently of opinion that it would be unnecessary to set up a new com-
mittee.
The Federal Government is unable to agree to the proposal contained in paragraphs HI and
VIII of Section II to the effect that when a copy of the export licence does not accompany the


consignment the Government issuing the export licence shall send a copy to the Government
of the importing country. The Federal Government thinks that a measure of this kind would
merely give excessive work to the authorities concerned without appreciably contributing to the
suppression of illicit traffic. As the Federal Government has already ventured to point out when
submitting its report for the year 1923, it is, in principle, prepared to issue licences in quadrupli-
cate. In its opinion it would be well to render this rule universal and to lay down that one of these
copies should accompany each consignment. Should the Government of an exporting country
so request, it might further be laid down that the copy of the export licence accompanying the
goods should be returned to the Government in question with an affidavit by the Government
of the importing country to the effect that importation has actually taken place.
As regards the question raised in paragraph V i.e., whether ecgonine should be included
in the list of controlled articles in conformity with the Hague Convention, the Federal Govern-
ment is not in a position to make a proposal, as it has not been observed in Austria that this
preparation has ever been put to such abusive use as to call for stricter control.
As regards the proposal contained in paragraph X namely, that in the case of a consign-
ment of narcotics passing in transit through the territory of a third country without being removed
from the ship or conveyance in which it is being conveyed, that a declaration should be made to
the authorities of the country of transit of the contents of the consignment and the country for
which it is destined the Federal Government feels that it should point out that the authorities
of the country through which the goods pass are not in a position to apply the provisions concerning
the control in traffic in narcotics to goods transported in closed receptacles which are not removed
from the means of transport, which, in other words, remain during transit under Customs seal.
The control of such consignments by the authorities of the countries through which they pass
would be going too far, and would not, moreover, produce any results, unless part at least of some
of the packages chosen at random were to be examined. The authorities of a country of transit
are not, however, entitled unless they have serious suspicions concerning the contents to
open these packages. It should, moreover, be borne in mind that, according to the Convention
for the Simplification of Customs Formalities, concluded on November 3rd, 1923, all excessive
or useless formalities should be avoided. In the opinion of the Federal Government, the copy
of the export certificate accompanying the goods should be sufficient to warrant the consignment.

MODIFICATIONS IN THE TEXT OF THE OPIUM CONVENTION PROPOSED BY THE
BELGIAN DELEGATION.
The Belgian delegation proposes the following textual modifications to Article 14 of the
Opium Convention:
(a) To medicinal opium;
\b) To all preparations (officinal and non-officinal, including the so-called anti-opium
remedies) containing more than 0.05 gr. of morphine ;
(c) To coca-leaf and to all preparations (officinal and non-officinal) containing more than
0.025 gr. of cocaine.
{d) To solutions of morphine and cocaine delivered in the form of ampullas ;
(e) To ecgonin ;
(/) To heroin, its salts and preparations containing heroin ;
(g) To all new derivatives of morphine, of cocaine or of their respective salts and to
every other product which may be shown by scientific research, generally recognised,
to be liable to similar abuse and productive of like ill-effects.
Reasons for above Proposals.
By taking the proportion of alkaloids contained in officinal preparations as the limit of
delivery, this clause of the Opium Convention presents serious drawbacks from the point of view
of pharmaceutical practice. _ . .
For example, a pharmacist cannot, without a medical prescription, give a client sunenng
from enteritis a single drop of laudanum (1 per cent of morphine) but he can give him 20 gr. o
laudanum if he takes the precaution of adding 80 gr. of water. This mixture would only contain
0.2 per cent of morphine and would therefore not come under the article in question.
Further, a pharmacist:
Opium extract
If he prepares a powder of 0.05 gr., may deliver 0.0001 M + 0.0005
~ ~ a pill of 0.20 gr., ~ ~ 0.0004 M + 0.002
~ ~ a lozenge of 1 gr., ~ ~ 0.0002 M
a solution, may deliver quantities of morphine varying with the volume.
It is well known, moreover, that it is not necessary to evaporate solutions of alkaloids to
dryness in order to obtain the alkaloids in a pure state. It will be seen, therefore, that it ls a -
normal in regulations to give prescriptions varying in their application from 1 to 2,000. Ihe


proposed modification will allow pharmacists to delivei 5 gr. of laudanum, 5 gr. of Dover powder
and 25 pills with 0.01 of opium extract subject to entering all such transactions in the narcotics
account and to observing the regulations concerning the sale of poisons.
It will not allow the delivery of ampullas of morphine and cocaine. It renders the delivery
of heroin subject to a medical prescription.
Doctors should further be forbidden to prescribe alkaloids or their salts in a pure state and
pharmacists to deliver them even against a medical prescription, since these alkaloids in a pure
state can serve no legitimate purpose.

MEMORANDUM AND PROPOSALS SUBMITTED BY THE CHINESE DELEGATION
WITH REFERENCE TO CHAPTER IV OF THE HAGUE CONVENTION OF 1912.
November 24th, 1924.
Above other nations, China is suffering by reason of the illicit trade in narcotic drugs.
Besides the debasing effects of these drugs upon her people, there is the further circumstance that
their widespread use enters as a discouraging element in the efforts which the Government and the
people are making to suppress the production and consumption of prepared opium, which are
illegal under Chinese law. It is, therefore, of special concern to China that the Governments of
the countries where these drugs are manufactured should adopt common and effective regulations
regarding their manufacture, export, re-export, transhipment, and transit with a view to con-
fining traffic in them to their strictly medicinal and scientific uses.
China, which manufactures none of these drugs, will, upon her part, do all that is within her
governmental power to control their importation into China, their transhipment and re-exporta-
tion, and will thus, in every possibly way, co-operate with the other Powers in their efforts to
solve the world-problem of confining the traffic in these drugs to stiictly scientific and medical
purposes.
And, as regards the trade in, and the use of, these drugs within China, the Government of
China will use all its powers, legislative and administrative, to prevent their use for other than the
purposes which science and medicine approve. In most countries this is a task the performance
of which is not directly dependent upon the co-operation of other Governments, but in China,
by reason of the existence of the extra-territorial rights of the nationals of a number of the other
Powers, as well, also, as by reason of the existence within China of areas within which some of
the Treaty Powers are permitted to exercise certain administrative powers, it is necessary that the
Government of China should obtain the hearty co-operation of these Powers in order that it may
efficiently control the narcotic problem.
For the control of its own citizens, over whom it has full administrative jurisdiction, the Chinese
Government has enacted comprehensive and stringent laws which it enforces to the extent of its
powers, but with regard to those of her citizens who live within the above-mentioned areas, as
well with regard to the nationals of those Powers within these areas, and the nationals outside
these areas who enjoy extra-territorial privileges, China is largely, if not wholly, dependent upon
the co-operation of the Powers for the effective control of the use of narcotics. This fact is recog-
nised in Chapter IV of the Hague Convention of 1912, which provides for harmonious and co-
operative action between the signatory Powers and China.
China has sought loyally to fulfil the obligations thus assumed by her, but she has thus far
failed to receive full co-operation upon the part of the other Powers as regards the action required
to be taken under Article 16 namely, that diplomatic representatives of those Powers at Peking
should examine the pharmacy laws regulating the sale and distribution of morphine, cocaine,
their respective salts and other substances referred to in Article 14 of the Convention enacted
by the Chinese Government and communicated to them, with a view, if found acceptable, to
applying them to their own nationals residing in China. And, furthermore, the Chinese delegation
is constrained to say, with reference to the laws of some of the Powers for the control of their
own nationals in China, that the penalties they impose seem scarcely severe enough efficiently
to attain the purposes for which they have been enacted, nor are they, in all cases, vigorously
and uniformly enforced by the officials of the Powers concerned. This observation applies also
to laws for the punishment of smuggling of opium and narcotic drugs into China.
Therefore, in order that the present unsatisfactory conditions may be corrected, the Chinese
delegation requests that, in substance, the following provisions be included in the Convention
which, it is to be hoped, will result from the labours of this Conference.
1. That the existing laws and regulations and administrative processes of the signatory
Powers shall be so strengthened and perfected as to prevent the exportation, importation, tran-
shipment, transit and re-exportation of opium, except as provided for in Chapter II of the Hague
Convention of 1912, and of morphine, heroin, cocaine and other narcotic drugs except in amounts
needed for strictly medicinal and scientific purposes.
2. That prompt examination of, and action not later than April Ist, 1925, with regard to
the application to their own nationals of the pharmacy laws of the Chinese Republic regulating
the sale, possession, and distribution of narcotic drugs shall be made by the Powers enjoying
extra-territorial rights in China, as provided for in Article 15 of the Hague Convention.


3. That the Powers which enjoy extra-territorial rights in China shall either apply Chinese
laws to their nationals for contraventions against Chinese laws prohibiting the cultivation, sale,
transport or trade in opium and other narcotics or enact adequate laws regulating these matters
which shall provide that the violation of these laws by their nationals shall be punishable by fines
whose amounts shall be multiples of the values at the places where the offences are committed,
of the drugs concerned and, in addition, by terms of imprisonment, and, at the expiration of such
terms, deportation of the party or parties concerned from China and prohibition thereafter to
return to China.
4. That the Powers enjoying extra-territorial rights in China shall either apply to their
own nationals in China the laws of China with regard to the smuggling or attempted smuggling
into China of opium or narcotic dnrgs, or strengthen their own laws by attaching to them penalties
for their violation which shall include fines the amounts of which shall be multiples of the values
of the opium or drugs concerned, together with terms of imprisonment at the expiration of which
terms the party or parties shall be deported from China and forbidden thereafter to return to China.
Reciprocally, China will adopt measures to prevent the smuggling out of China by her own
nationals of opium or narcotic drugs into the territories and possessions of the Contracting Parties.
5. That, if the smuggling of opium or the aforesaid drugs into China or their sale in China
or their attempted smuggling or sale is by or with the connivance of the officers of a ship, the ship
also shall be subject to a fine equal in amount to a multiple of the local value of the goods smuggled
or sold or sought to be smuggled or sold.
6. That the trial of foreign nationals who enjoy extra-territorial rights in China for offences
referred to in the preceding paragraphs shall be in open court, and that, at such trials, Chinese
assessors may be present.

REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE A
as adopted February 2nd, 1925.
Rapporteur: Sir Malcom Delevingne, delegate of the British Empire.
Sub-Committee A was appointed to consider that part of the task entrusted to the Second
Conference, which relates to the ?limitation of the amounts of morphine, heroin and cocaine and
their respective salts to be manufactured ?, and the Conference gave the Sub-Committee a general
mandate to consider the suggestions which had been made, or might be made, with that end.
In particular, the Conference referred to it the first part of the proposals which had been drawn
up by the Opium Advisory Committee of the League of Nations at its meeting in August 1924,
and which were adopted by the Conference at its first meeting as the basis of its deliberations,
and the corresponding proposals in the scheme submitted by the United States delegation, which
were based upon, and largely in agreement with, the proposals of the Advisory Committee.
These proposals were examined very thoroughly by the Sub-Committee, and a wide diver-
gence of views was found to exist between the delegations of the countries mainly concerned
in the manufacture of and commerce in these drugs.
It will be convenient to recall briefly the main points of the scheme of the Advisory Committee.
At its meeting in 1923, at which it formulated the proposal for the holding of a conference on the
subject, the Committee reported ?that the information obtained by the Committee concerning
the manufacture of drugs was steadily increasing and seemed to make it possible now to form
a rough estimate of the world's requirements. Suggestions were considered regarding the limitation
of the manufacture of morphin, heroin and cocaine, and the Committee reached the conclusion that it
now seemed possible for the Governments of the producing countries to approach each other with a
view to reaching a general understanding?. With this object that is, of securing a limitation in the
amounts of the drugs manufactured and placed on the world?s markets ? the Advisory Committee,
at its meeting in August 1924, made the following suggestions :
[a) Every country should frame, annually, an estimate of the amounts it would require
to import in the following year for medical and scientific purposes of each of the
substances covered by the Hague Convention, whether required for domestic
consumption, for manufacture or for commerce.
( b ) The Governments should undertake not to allow the importation of more than the
quantities specified in their estimates unless in the course of the year they found
it necessary to frame a revised estimate.
(c) The exporting countries should undertake that their exports to any country should
not, together, exceed more than the amount estimated by that country.
[d) A Central Board should be constituted by the Council of the League. The Board
should receive at the beginning of each year the estimates of the countries, and during
the year quarterly statistics of the imports and exports from and to each country,
and should keep the Governments of the exporting countries informed when the
imports into any particular country had reached the amount estimated.
{e) The Board should also have the important power of revising any estimate furnished
by a Government which appeared to the Board ?to be greatly in excess of the
reasonable requirements of the country and to be likely to be used in part for the
illicit traffic.?


Strong objection was taken to these proposals by several delegations on various grounds,
the principal of which were that Governments were not in a position at present to frame estimates,
which could be regarded as binding, of their annual requirements , that, in 3>ny case,
owing to the fluctuations in the annual opium crop and the speculative character of the
trade, it would always be impossible to frame in advance estimates of their requirements
for manufacturing or commercial purposes; and that a limitation of the imports of a country to a
definite figure would lead to attempts on the part of dealers to corner the markets and would entail
a complete system of rationing. The delegations which held these views considered that a more
practical method of control would be to obtain the statistics of the trade in the drugs at the end
of each year and to give the Central Board the duty of examining the statistics and calling atten-
tion to cases in which the figures appeared to indicate that excessive quantities were being imported
and that there was a danger of a country being the centre of an illicit traffic.
The delegations which supported the scheme of the Advisory Committee pointed out in
reply, first, that if reliance was to be placed on statistics which were only to be received after
the close of the year in regard to the transactions in that year, no effective action could be taken
by the Board to prevent illicit traffic, as the statistics would not be received at the best until
many months after the event; secondly, that it would not be expected of the Governments, at
any rate in the early years of the working of the scheme, that they should furnish exact estimates
of their requirements, that, in the first instance, they would be able to allow a sufficient margin
in their estimates to provide against a possible shortage, and would always be able, in the event
of a shortage actually occurring, to forward a revised estimate, and that, as experience grew, the
estimates would become more and more exact; thirdly, that there was no reason why a Govern-
ment, in a year of abundant crop and low prices, should not allow its traders and manufacturers
to take advantage of it by laying in supplies for a longer period than the current year a revised
estimate being submitted for the purpose; lastly, that any attempts on the part of dealers to
corner the market and to raise prices would be improbable as the trade in these particular drugs,
in most cases, forms only a small part of theii total business and would prejudice their other
business, and in any case, such attempts could easily be countered by the Government, whose
permission the dealers would require for carrying on the trade in these drugs.
Long discussions took place both in the Committee itself and in a small Committee of Five
which was appointed with a view to finding a basis of agreement. Ihe objections to the scheme
of the Advisory Committee were maintained, and it became evident that if an agreement were
to be reached it would have to be on a different basis.
Eventually a compromise was reached on the following lines:
The establishment of a Central Board was retained, but with functions of a different character.
Its main duty would be to keep a watch on the international traffic, to rote where the
drugs were going to, and to investigate the case of any country where quantities great y
in excess of its probable requirements were accumulating. To enable it to carry out
its duties it would be furnished, at short inteivals, by each country, with statistics
of its imports from and exports to each country of each of the drugs. It would also be furnished
at the beginning of the year with the estimates of the probable requirements of each country
for internal consumption, but these estimates would not be binding on the country as under the
Advisory Committee?s scheme but would be merely for the purpose of serving as a guide to the
Central Board in carrying out its task. The Board would also have the power of asking for expla-
nations from any country where the imports appeared to be excessive, and, if no satisfactory
explanation were forthcoming, of calling the attention of all other Governments to the position
and recommending that the exports to the country in question should cease until the board was
able to report that the situation in that country was satisfactory.
This scheme is embodied in the draft proposals which are submitted by Sub-Committee A
for the consideration of the Conference and which are annexed to this report.
It will be observed that under this scheme no compulsion is placed upon any Government
and that the powers of the Central Board are powers of enquiry and recommendation only. No
country is compelled to cease either its imports or its exports of the drugs. The sanction behind
the action of the Board will be a moral sanction only the pressure of public opinion.
The Board will publish its findings and the grounds on which they are based, and will communicate
them to the Council of the League and, through the Council, to all the Governments. The Board
will only take the decisive action of recommending the stoppage of exports to a particular country
when the case is perfectly clear, and in such a case it can hardly be doubted that responsib e
Governments which put their signatures to the new Convention will act in accordance with the
recommendation. Should a Government not be prepared, however, to act on the recommendation,
it will be required to inform the Central Board, and, if possible, give its reasons. It was felt by
one or two delegations that in some cases there might be political or other serious reasons for not
stating the grounds of the decision of the Government. It is understood that such cases would
be exceptional. . . . ,
In order that every possible safeguard may be provided against the possibility of error or
arbitrary action on the part of the Board, it is proposed in the scheme submitted to the Con-
ference that a recommendation of the Board shall only be made if a clear majority of the woe
number of the Board is in favour of it; that any country shall be entitled to be represented at a
meeting of the Board when any question of action with regard to it under Article VI is being con-
sidered; that where there is a division of opinion in the Board the views of the minority shall
also be stated in their report; and, finally, that any country shall have the right of appeal to the
Council of the League against the decision of the Board. .
The scheme now proposed is less drastic than the scheme proposed by the Advisory Com-
mittee, which was itself less drastic than the scheme of limitation put forward by certain countries
in the Committee which was appointed by the Council of the League to prepare a programme


for the Conference. The Sub-Committee believes, however, that the scheme it has elaborated
will be a valuable instrument in checking the illicit traffic and securing the limitation of the manu-
facture of and trade in the drugs to medical and scientific requirements as provided for in the Hague
Convention. The success of the scheme will depend on the active co-operation of the Govern-
ments in supplying the statistics and other material which will be required by the Board to enable
it to carry out its duties.
It remains to comment briefly on the details of the scheme
i. The Constitution of the Central Board.
(a) The Electoral Body.
The Sub-Committee considers that the Electoral Body, which will appoint the Central Board,
should be fairly representative of all countries, and it has therefore had to take account of the
fact that some important countries are not Members of the League of Nations. After much
discussion, it came to the conclusion that the body which is to appoint the Central Board should
be constituted by all the countries which are represented, whether by permanent or non-permanent
seats, on the Council of the League of Nations, together with the United States of America and
Germany. In this way the interests of all countries, whether consuming or producing or manu-
facturing countries, will be adequately protected.
(b) Qualifications of Members of the Central Board.
It is essential that the members of the Board should be absolutely impartial and independent
on the one hand, and that, on the other, they should have an expert knowledge of the matters
with which they will have to deal. Unless they possess both these qualifications they will not
be able to command the general confidence both of the countries affected and of the world at
large, on which the success of their work will depend. The Sub-Committee has accordingly
proposed that the members of the Board shall be persons who, by their technical competence
impartiality and disinterestedness, are likely to command general confidence, and it has not
seen its way to accept a suggestion that consuming, producing and manufacturing countries
should be separately represented on the Board. It would, in its view, be fatal to the success of
the scheme if the Board were to be representative of ?interests It recognises, however, the
importance of preventing any suspicion that the Board is selected from a particular group of
countries and of ensuring a wide field of candidates from which the electoral body can make its
choice, and it has accordingly accepted the proposal that the selection shall be made from a list
on which every signatory of the Convention would have the right to place one name. The Sub-
Committee must emphasise the importance, however, of the signatory Governments, in the
exercise of this right, taking the greatest care to put forward only the names of persons who
possess the qualifications mentioned above.
Different opinions were expressed as to the most suitable number of members to be appointed
on the Board. The Committee of Five, which prepared the scheme, recommended five, but the
Sub-Committee finally decided in favour of seven. It was felt that the larger number would
ensure a more adequate representation and strengthen confidence in the decisions of the Board.
It will also make it easier to secure a quorum for meetings of the Board in cases of urgency.
(c) Organisation of the Work of the Central Board.
If the Board is to command general confidence and its decisions are to be accepted, it must
be completely independent in carrying out its work, and it is of the utmost importance that no
ground should be given even for a suspicion that it is liable to any outside influence. On the
other hand, it is not possible, nor desirable, to dissociate the organisation from the League of Nations,
which, under Article 23 of the Covenant of the League, is entrusted with the general supervision
of the traffic in opium and other dangerous drugs. It is desirable that the staff of the Board,
while acting under the orders of the Board in regard to its actual work, should be organised,
for administrative purposes, as part of the staff of the League. Moreover, by organising the
work in this way, the ?material ? services of the League will be at the disposal of the Board,
with a great gain of efficiency and economy in expense. The Sub-Committee considers that
the exact arrangements necessary for securing these objects must be left to be settled by the
knowledge and good sense of the Council of the Board. It accordingly proposes that the arrange-
ments should be made by the Council of the League in consultation with the Board and that
the Board should nominate its secretary and staff for appointment by the Secretary-General,
subject to the approval by the Council.
(d) Expenses of the Central Board.
It is proposed that the expenses of the Board and its staff should be borne by the Powers
which sign the Convention and that the allocation should be arranged by the Council of the League
in consultation with the Governments of States which are non-Members of the League. The
Sub-Committee does not anticipate that the cost of the Board will be considerable. JTt cannot
be expected that it will be possible to obtain the services as members of the Board of persons
who possess the qualifications necessary and who will be willing to give the amount of time which
the work of the Board will require unless they receive a remuneration for their services. This
remuneration will necessarily be at a high rate if men of the first class are to be secured, but, on
the other hand, they will not be required to give the whole of their time, or oven a large part of
their time, to the work of the Board. The Sub-Committee anticipates that the work will be
carried on somewhat in the following manner:


The Secretary and staff (who will be permanent officials and who will be provided with office
accommodation, presumably at Geneva) would carry on the work of tabulating and analysing
the statistics of imports, etc. as they come in; would circulate the summaries, analyses, etc.
to the members of the Board as quickly as possible, and would call attention to any cases which
might appear to demand the special consideration of the Board. In cases where urgent action
would appear to be required, they would immediately warn the members. It is impossible to
forecast the number of meetings which the Board would require to hold each year, but it is possible
that four quarterly meetings, or even less, with an occasional emergency meeting, might prove
to be sufficient.
As regards the staff, it will be necessary to employ a secretary to be in general charge of the
work. His position will *Be an important one, and he will require to have similar qualifications
to those required by the members of the Board, though he need not be of the same standing. He
would occupy a confidential position of considerable responsibility. It would be necessary there-
fore that he should be adequately remunerated.
In addition to the secretary, some officials experienced in the handling of statistics would
be necessary, but the statistics would not be of great volume, and the number of officials required
would be small.
2. Information to be furnished by the Governments,
This can be grouped under four headings:
(a) Quarterly Statistics of Imports and Exports.
These will be the main foundation of the work of the Board, as it is by these that they will
be enabled to follow currently the course of the international traffic.
A proposal was made, when the scheme was first brought forward, that these returns should
be made monthly, but objection was taken by certain delegations on the ground of the difficulty
of supplying the figures at such frequent intervals, and the Sub-Committee, to meet these objec-
tions, agreed that the returns should be made quarterly. With quarterly returns the Board will
not be able to follow so closely the course of the international traffic, but the Committee thinks
that, at the commencement, at any rate, of the scheme, this compromise should be accepted.
(b) Annual Statistics of Production, Manufacture, Consumption and Stocks.
These statistics will also be of great importance, as, in conjunction with the figures of imports
and exports, they will enable the Central Board to trace what has become of the amounts of the
raw material produced and of the drugs manufactured in the several producing and manufacturing
countries. For instance, if in the case of any country the figures of manufacture and import
of the drugs are found to be greatly in excess of the exports, consumption and stocks, the pos-
sibility of a leakage in that country into channels of illicit traffic would be indicated and would
be examined by the Board.
(c) Estimates.
Each country will be asked to furnish an estimate at the end of the year of its probable
requirements for internal consumption during the ensuing year of each of the substances covered
by the Hague Convention. As already stated, these estimates are not to be binding on the Govern-
ments and are intended to serve as a guide to the Central Board as to the probable requirements
of the different countries. The value of the estimates for that purpose will, of course, depend
on the care with which they are prepared. The Sub-Committee considers that it should be pos-
sible, especially after a few years? experience, for the Governments to frame fairly close estimates
of their requirements by one or more of the methods which have been mentioned in the Sub-Com-
mittee.
As some doubt was expressed in the Sub-Committee as to whether the words ? * internal con-
sumption ? would include consumption in the country for purposes of manufacture, the Sub-
Committee desires that it should be made perfectly clear that this is not the case.
(d) Seizures.
It will be of great assistance to the Board if it can be furnished annually by the Govern-
ments with information as to seizures of contraband drugs, as these will throw light on the extent
and course of illicit international traffic. A provision on this point has accordingly been inserted
in Article IV (i) {e). The drafting of this provision will require to be considered by the Drafting
Committee.
A word of explanation is required in regard to the proposal in Article V that statistics in
regard to the manufacture and consumption of prepared opium should be supplied to the Board.
Except in the one case mentioned below, the Board will have no duties in regard to the manufacture
of, trade in, and use of, prepared opium in those territories in which opium-smoking is still tem-
porarily authorised under Chapter II of the Hague Convention. It was suggested, however,
that it would help the Board, in keeping a watch upon the international traffic and in ascertaining
what becomes of the supplies of raw opium placed upon the world?s markets, it information a�
to the amount of raw opium imported for the purpose of smoking and the amount used in the
manufacture of prepared opium were supplied to the Board. The Sub-Committee, in order to
moke in perfectly clear that it will not be within the competence of the Board to intervene in the
question of the use of opium for smoking, has inserted the last paragraph in Article V. There
is one class of case, however, in which it would be competent for the Board to intervene that is,
in a case in which the Board might find that an extensive smuggling of opium from one of the


territories in question was taking place. In such a case the Board would have the same power
to ask for explanations and to make recommendations as in other cases.
3. Powers and Duties of the Central Board.
The functions of the Board have been explained above, and little further remains to be said.
An important discussion took place in the Sub-Comm : ttee on the proposal that the decisions
of the Central Board should be subject to the approval of the Council of the League. This proposal
was felt by the .Sub-Committee to be open to strong objection on several grounds and was not
accep ed by them. It appeared to the Sub-Committee that its adoption would have affected
the independent status of the Board; would have made it much more difficult to secure men
of the highest standing as members of the Board, and would have led to serious delays in taking
any necessary action in cases of illicit traffic.
The Sub-Committee has considered it necessary to define as precisely as possible the powers
and duties of the Board. This is important in order to prevent any question being raised in the
future by any Government as to the competence of the Board in regard to any action it might
take and also to avoid overlapping and conflict of jurisdiction with the Opium Advisory Committee.
While the task of examining the statistics of the traffic furnished by the Governments and watching
the course of the international trade will now fall to the Central Board, the Advisory Committee
will still remain as the advisory organ of the Council and Assembly of the League with important
functions, and it is very desirable to prevent any conflict of jurisdiction between the two bodies.
A word of explanation is necessary in regard to Article Vl a. It was considered by the Com-
mittee to be desirable that Governments should have the right to bring to the notice of the Board
any matter within the scope of the duties of the Board which might appear to require investiga-
tion, as, for instance, a case in which any country had evidence of illicit traffic being carried on.
Such information will be of special value to the Board as regards countries which are not signa-
tories of the Convention and from which the satisfies and other information provided for in
the scheme is not received by the Board. The article is not. to be construed as extending the
powers of the Board, as laid down in Articles VI and VII.
Lastly, the Sub-Committee desires to insist on the importance of the utmost discretion being
used by the Board in dealing with the information which it receives from the Governments. The
information of the imports, exports, etc. of particular countries, if divulged, might be of great
value to speculate :s in the trade, or might be used to injure the commercial interests of a country,
and it has accordingly inserted a provision in Article VIII on the point.
The Sub-Committee recognises that the scheme which it now submits for the approval of
the Conference may not fulfil as completely as could be wished the hopes which were entertained
in many quarters that an effective scheme would be worked out by the Conference for limiting
the amounts of the drugs manufactured to the quantities actually required for the world?s medical
and scientific needs. At the same time, it believes that if the Conference adopts the scheme which
it proposes, the first, and most important, steps will have been taken in the direction of establishing
the control over the traffic in these drugs which all Governments desire. If, as it confidently
expects, the Central Board proves itself to be an effective body for carrying out the duties entrusted
to it under the scheme and obtains the confidence of all countries and parties interested, it will
be easy to enlarge its functions and to extend the scope of its work as circumstances may show
to be desirable.

by telegram, except when the quantities fall below a minimum amount which shall be fixed in
the case of each substance by the board.
3. In furnishing the statistics in pursuance of this Article, the Governments shall state sepa-
rately the amounts imported or purchased for Government purposes in order to enable the amounts
required in the country for general medical and scientific purposes to be ascertained. It shall
jiot be within the competence of the Central Board to question or to express any opinion on the
amounts imported or purchased for Government purposes or the use thereof.
4. For the purposes of this Article, substances which are held, imported, or purchased by the
Government for eventual sale are not regarded as held, imported or purchased for Government
purposes.
Article V.

of raw opium, the Governments of the countries where the use of prepared opium is temporarily
permitted shall, in a manner to be prescribed by the Board, in addition to the statistics provided
for in Article IV, forward annually, within three months after the end of the year, to the Central
Board, the complete statistics relative to the preceding year as follows:
(a) Manufacture of prepared opium and the raw material used for such manufacture.
(b) Consumption of prepared opium.
It is understood that it shall be within the competence of the Board to question or to express
any opinion upon these statistics, and the provisions of Article VI are not applicable to the matters
dealt with in this Article, except in cases where the Board may find that illicit international tran-

in any country, the Board shall have the right to ask, through the instrumentally of the Secretary-
General of the League, for explanations from the country in question.
2. If no explanation is given within a reasonable time or the explanation is unsatisfactory,
the Central Board shall have the right to call the attention of all the Governments and of the
Council of the League of Nations to the matter and to recommend that no further exports shall


be made to the country in question until the Central Board reports that it is satisfied as to the
situation in that country in regard to the trade in the substances. The Central Board shall at the
same time notify the Government of the country concerned of the action taken by the Board.
The country concerned, and any country which exports the substances in question to it, shall be
entitled to appeal to the Council of the League against any decision of the Board under this para-
graph.
3. If any Government is not prepared to act on the recommendation of the Central Board,
it shall immediately inform the Central Board, explaining, if possible, why it is not prepared to
do so.

Article VII.
In the case of a country non-signatory, the Central Board may take the same measures as
are specified in Article VI if the information at the disposal of the Board leads it to conclude that
there is a danger of the country becoming a centre of the illicit traffic, and, in that case, shall
take the action indicated in that Article as regards notification to the country concerned. The
country shall be entitled to be represented at the meeting of the Central Board at which the ques-

FIRST REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE B.
Rapporteur: M. Dinichert, delegate of Switzerland.
At its first meeting, which was held on November 28th, Sub-Committee B decided to divide
its work into two parts; the first was to include all questions and proposals concerning the limitation
of the production of raw opium in general and the second (considered more especially from the
point of view of the countries producing raw opium) was to include the proposals contained in the
? Measures ? suggested by the Advisory Committee on the Traffic in Opium as a basis for the deli-
berations of the Conference (Document A.32 {a) 1924. XI/O.C. 216 (5)) and the suggestions submit-
ted by the United States delegation (Document O.D.C. 34). Two separate reports were to be drawn
up on these two groups of questions.
The present report, which relates to the second part of the Sub-Committee?s programme, covers
Articles 4, 5 and 6, Part I, Article 7, paragraph XIII, of Part II of the ?Measures ?, and Articles
20-A, 20-D, 20-E and 20-L of the American Suggestions.
The basis taken for the discussion of these questions was a note 1 defining the obligations which
countries producing raw opium would have to assume, particularly as regards the statistics and
estimates they must furnish and certain special measures to be taken concerning their production,
consumption, export and re-export of raw opium alone.
The Sub-Committee dealt only incidentally with the constitution and organisation of the
Permanent Central Board, the creation of which is provided for under Article 3 of the ? Measures ?
and Article 20-C of the United States Suggestions, as the consideration of this question comes
mainly within the competence of Sub-Committee A.
I. Article 4(b) of the ? Measures? and Article 20 -D (1) (a) and (b) of the American Suggestions.
According to these proposals, countries producing raw opium would undertake to send to the
Permanent Central Board:
1 See Minutes of Sub-Committee B, Annex x


1. Within three months after the end of each quarter, statistics of their exports and re-
exports, specifying the country of destination, during that quarter;
2. If possible within three months after the end of each half-year, statistics of the stocks,
whether in the hands of the Government or in the hands of wholesale dealers, at the end of
that half-year.
It was found, on carefully examining the first point, that the States in question would not all
hi able to furnish quarterly or half-yearly-statistics but only annual statistics of their exports and
re-exports of raw opium, and this not within three months but only within six months after the
end of each year. It was also agreed that, for the purposes of this undertaking, ?year ?? must be
taken to mean? financial year , the dates of which are not the same in the different countries.
The provision in the Convention relating to this point might therefore be drafted as follows:
?The Contracting Parties agree to send to the Permanent Central Board, within six months
after the end of each financial year, statistics of their exports and re-exports, specifying the
country of destination, during that year.
The second point also called for special examination, as the countries concerned are not all
able at present to furnish information, or equally accurate information, especially as regards the
stocks of raw opium in private hands. It is also difficult to give a satisfactory definition of a
wholesale dealer; and the various Governments must be allowed a certain latitude in deciding the
point.
To allow of comparison as between the statistics furnished by the various Governments, the
latter should also forward commentaries which are indispensable if the statistics are to be of real
value, and the Central Board would see that the statistics published by it were accompanied by all
necessary explanation.
It was understood, furthermore, that the words ?if possible ? included in this article would
constitute the reservation necessary in the case of Governments which were unable under present
conditions to furnish all, or even part, of the statistics required, but that these words would not
exempt them from the obligation to communicate such statistics as soon as it was in their power so
to do.
Finally, it was agreed that the figures in question should be collected at the end of each year
instead of at the end of each half-year, and that they should be communicated within three months
after the end of the year.
This point might be drafted as follows;
?The Contracting Parties agree that they will inform the Permanent Central Board, within
three months after the end of each year if possible, of the quantity of the stocks, whether in
Government hands or in the hands of wholesale dealers, at the end of that year. ?
11. Article 4 (c) of the ?Measures ? and Article 20 -D (3) of the American Suggestions.
The question which the Sub-Committee had to decide was whether the countries producing
raw opium would be able, within three months after the end of each, year, to state the quantity
of raw opium consumed in the country during the course of the year. It was found that the countries
concerned would be willing to undertake to do so, although in certain cases the statistics furnished
could only be approximate, and if there were no domestic consumption of raw opium there would
be no statistics to collect or forward. The undertaking might be drafted as follows:
?The contracting parties agree to send to the Permanent Central Board, within three
months after the end of each year, as accurate statistics as possible of the total quantity of
raw. opium consumed during that year. ?
11. A. Article 20 -D (3) of the American Suggestions.
Is it possible for the producing countries to state the total quantity of raw opium produced
during the year within three months after the end of each year ?
All the delegations in question thought it was possible to reply in the affirmative, but they
pointed out, however, that, in cases in which there were no official statistics or only incomplete
statistics, the data would only be approximate.
Subject to this reservation, the following formula might be accepted:
? ? The Contracting Parties agree to send to the Permanent Central Board, within three
months after the end of each year, as accurate statistics as possible of the total quantity of raw-
opium produced during that year. ?
The two formulas given above might, if necessary, be combined as follows:
? ? The Contracting Parties agree to send to the Permanent Central Board, within three
months after the end of each year, as accurate statistics as possible of: (1) the total quantity
of raw opium produced; (2) the total quantity consumed, during that year. ?
111. Article 4, Last Paragraph of the ?Measures ?.
This article provides that, should the imports of raw opium received in any country during
the current year have exceeded the amounts specified in the estimate furnished by that country,
the Central Board shall call the attention of the Governments specially to that fact, and each
Government undertakes not to export any further consignments of raw opium to the said country
during the same year unless a revised estimate of its requirements shall have been furnished by the
country.


The above articles deal with the case of a country which furnishes no estimate of its require-
ments in raw opium or furnishes an estimate which appears to the Central Board to be greatly
in excess of the resonable requirements of the country. In such case, the Board would fix the
amounts of the reasonable requirements of that country after taking into account all relevant fac-
tors. The Board would notify the amount so fixed to all Governments, and the latter would agree
not to allow the export to that country of amounts which, taken in conjunction with the exports
from other countries, would exceed the amounts fixed by the Board.
There was at first some discussion as to the desirability of retaining the word ?reasonable ?
to describe the requirements in question. It was stated that the expression should be retained,
as it represented the requirements or the quantities referred to in Article i of the ?Measures .
Most of the members of the Sub-Committee, however, considered that the use of the word would
involve the introduction in the future agreement of a vague and indefinite term which would be
likely to give rise to confusion or misunderstanding, since ? reasonable ?? requirements were simply
the requirements for medical and scientific purposes of every description referred to in Article i;
they thought that it was better, therefore, to keep only the latter expression. It was also pointed
out, on this occasion, that paragraph XIII of Article 7 of the ?Measures? spoke of ?amounts
reasonably required for . . . medical and scientific needs ?, from which it must be
understood that ?amounts . . . reasonably required? were regarded as supplementary to
The countries producing raw opium are prepared to enter into and observe an undertaking of
this nature in so far as it is possible for them to do so, having regard to the difficulties sometimes
very great ?? of controlling their very long frontiers. Obviously it would be for the Central Board
to see that the Governments concerned are notified in good time if the imports specified have been
exceeded and if a revised estimate has been allowed. Subject to the limits of the original estimate
or of any revised estimate, the importing country shall be at liberty to obtain these stocks wherever
it pleases.
The undertaking might be drafted as follows:
? ? Should the imports of raw opium into any country during the current year exceed the
amounts specified in the estimate furnished by that country, the Permanent Central Board
shall call the attention of the Governments specially to the fact, and the Contracting Parties
undertake in such a case, so far as the controlling of their frontiers permits, not to allow the
export of any further consignments of raw opium to the said country during the same year
unless a revised estimate of its requirements shall have been furnished by the country. ?
IV. Article sof the ? Measures ? and Article 20 -E of the American Suggestions.
?medical and scientific needs ?. Such, however, is not the case, as they are identical.
As regards the principle underlying this question, the Governments producing raw opium
would be prepared to deal with the matter in the same way as with the preceding question; they
would undertake, so far as the controlling of their frontiers permitted, not to allow exports of raw
opium in excess of the amounts specified.
The article might therefore be drafted as follows:
?If any country furnishes no estimate of its requirements or furnishes an estimate which
appears to the Permanent Central Board to be greatly in excess of the medical and scientific
requirements of the country whether for domestic consumption or for manufacture or trade
the Board shall fix the amounts of such requirements and shall notify all Governments of the
amounts so fixed. The Contracting Parties agree, so far as the controlling of their frontiers
permits, not to allow the export to that country of amounts of raw opium which, taken in con-
junction with the exports from other countries, will exceed the amounts fixed by the Board.
A discussion followed as to the conditions in which it would be desirable for the Central Board
to exercise its control and to take any of the important decisions in question. It was decided to
suggest that, should these powers actually be conferred upon the Central Board:
1. It should be composed of members half belonging to the producing countries and half
to the consuming countries;
2. The decisions of the nature referred to should be taken by it only after it had been in
existence for two, three or four years, in order that it might have adequate data for its
estimates;
3. Before such decisions are taken, an enquiry should be held the results of which should
be made public.
V. Article 6 of the ?Measures ?.
This article provides that if any country which has commercial relations, in the matter of any
one of the substances mentioned in the Convention, with a country for which an amount has been
fixed for its imports by the Permanent Central Board considers that the amount so fixed is too low,
the Government of the exporting country shall have the right to demand that a special conference
of all the countries which have such relations with the importing country shall be summoned to
consider whether the limitation fixed shall be put into force.
The Sub-Committee thought that such a provision was neither useful nor expedient and that
it should be omitted, but as it did not know the reasons for which this proposal had been made, it
did not think it advisable to submit a formal request for its deletion.


VI. Article 7, paragraph XIII, of the "Measures ? {Part 11, Article 20-1, of the American Suggestions).
? In the case of a country which is not a party to the Convention, the contracting parties
undertake to allow the export to such a country of any of the substances covered by the Con-
vention only in such amounts as may be fixed by the Permanent Central Board as correspond-
ing to the medical and scientific needs of the country, whether for domestic consumption or for
manufacture or commerce. The Central Board will inform the various Governments of the
a mounts fixed for the country in question and will supply them with data from time to time
concerning exports and re-exports to the said country. ?
The countries producing raw opium would be prepared to accept a clause such as the above.
VII, Article 20-A (2) of the American Suggestions.
This clause provides that the producing countries shall furnish annually to the Central Board,
not later than April Ist for the calendar year beginning January Ist following, estimates of raw
opium in respect of their production and requirements for the following purposes:
Domestic consumption for all purposes;
Domestic consumption for medical and scientific purposes;
Export for all purposes;
Export for medical and scientific purposes.
It was found on examination, in the case of production especially, that these estimates could
not be furnished before September Ist for the current year. This date was therefore agreed to,
and it was decided that requirements should be indicated under two headings only: domestic
consumption and export. To meet the wish expressed by the United States delegation, it was, how-
ever, agreed that the representatives of the Sub-Committee on the Co-ordination Committee would
draw its attention to the request for more complete information formulated in this article of the
American draft.
The Chinese delegation pointed out that the Chinese authorities would have difficulties in
furnishing the statistics in question in view of the extra-territorial rights which many foreigners
enjoyed in China; it also directed attention to the fact that domestic consumption was prohibited
in China.
The article might be drafted as follows:
"The Contracting Parties shall furnish annually to the Permanent Central Board, not
later than September Ist for the current year, in respect of raw opium, estimates of their total
production and of their total requirements: (1) for domestic consumption for all purposes;
(2) for export for all purposes. ?
In respect of all the questions dealt with in the present report, the Persian delegation renewed
its general reservation to the effect that Persia will only agree to a convention on condition that
its proposals, as formulated in the "Note on Persian Opium ? presented by the Persian delegation
(Document 0.D.C.24), are adopted.
This covers all the questions to be dealt with in the Sub-Committee?s first report.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE B
Adopted on February 4th, 1925.
The Sub-Committee considered the following questions:
Article 1 and the suggestions of the United States of America thereon;
The appointment of a Commission of Enquiry and Investigation. (Submitted by the
delegate of the United States of America.)
Proposals submitted by:
Document O.D.C. 20, Australia;
Document O.D.C. 20 and 20 {a), Austria;
Document O.D.C. 20, Cuba
relating to the limitation and prohibition of the growth of poppy and coca-leaf.
Document 0.D.C.24, Persian Memorandum.
Article 1.
A Sub-Committee of Sub-Committee B discussed this article at considerable length and, on the
proposals of the delegate of the United States of America being submitted to a vote, it was clearly
demonstrated that no State, except the United States of America, could accept them uncondition-
ally or without reservation or further investigation.
The delegate of the United States of America then submitted amotion for the appointment of a
Cornmittee of Enquiry in the following terms:
?Having noted with interest the reports submitted by Persia, Turkey, the Kingdom of the
Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Greece and Egypt setting forth the economic and political difficulties


with which their Governments are confronted in their efforts to obtain an effective control
over the production of opium; and
?Recognising that in some cases the situation as described may require international
co-operation:
?Sub-Committee B recommends to the Conference that careful consideration be given
to the question of the appointment of a Commission to visit the countries mentioned above for
the purpose of making a careful study of all the problems connected with the production of,
traffic in and use of opium in these countries, and especially with reference to the possibility
of substituting therefor the cultivation of other agricultural products, the development of
mineral resources, the improvement of transportation facilities, and such other measures as
may be deemed necessary to the end that the production of and traffic in raw and prepared
opium within the countries mentioned and the exportation of such products therefrom shall
be limited to strictly medicinal and scientific purposes.
?The Commission shall be appointed in a manner to be determined by the Conference
with the approval of the producing countries concerned, and it shall consider carefully the
reports which have been submitted to the Conference by the Governments of Persia, Turkey,
the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, Greece and Egypt. To the Conference shall
also be referred the questions of the number and qualifications of the members of the Commis-
sion and of the steps to be taken to obtain the funds necessary to meet the expenses of the
Commission for the purpose as described above.
? The Commission shall be instructed to make its report in a manner to be determined
by the Conference. The report, together with the recommendations of the Commission, shall
be communicated to the Powers signatory to the Convention. The signatory Powers, espe-
cially the Governments of Persia, Turkey, the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes,
Greece and Egypt, agree to give due consideration to the report and recommendations of the
Commission. ?
The Committee accepted this proposal on the understanding that the Committee should be
appointed under the auspices of the League of Nations, which should pay the expenses of the
Commission.
The delegate of the United States of America reserved this point for further discussion.
The delegate of the United States of America urged that Article i of the Suggestions of the
United States of America be accepted in principle first and the Commission of Enquiry to follow,
but the article was not to be held in abeyance pending the report of the Commission of Enquiry;
and that it should be included in the Convention, not the Preamble. Countries which were not in a
position to accept the proposal immediately could make reservations as to the time when and the
conditions under which they would be prepared to give it complete and effective application in their
territories.
At subsequent meetings the whole of the suggested amendments of Article i were reconsidered.
As the result of this discussion, the following motion was adopted (the delegate for the United
States of America abstained from voting):
?The Sub-Committee discussed at considerable length the suggestion of the United
States of America for amendment of Article I.
?Only two delegates (those of China and Egypt) were able to accept the United States
proposals unconditionally.
?An amendment in the following terms made by the Indian delegation was also considered:
? ?The Contracting Parties shall enact effective laws or regulations for the control
of the production and distribution of raw opium and the suppression of its abusive use.
In particular, they shall undertake effective measures to prevent any export of raw opium
not specifically permitted by the provisions of this Convention. ?
?This was accepted unconditionally by three delegates (India, Greece and the Kingdom
of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes), Turkey and Persia made reservations, whilst Egypt
desired an amendment to insert ?for other than medical and scientific purposes?.
?The delegate of the United States of America was unable to accept any amendment
of its original proposal. As no compromise was possible, the Committee regrets to report
that it was unable to arrive at any agreement.
?Non-producing countries were not consulted. ?
Australian, Cuban and Austrian Proposals.
As the Australian proposal was the most definite and comprehensive, it was taken as the
basis for discussion. It recommends that the production or the growth of the raw materials
in all countries which did not at present produce poppy or coca-leaf should be prohibited.
It was explained by the Vice-Chairman that Sub-Committee D had passed the following
resolution:
?The Committee realised that this proposition imposed a very heavy obligation on non-
producing countries, but, as restriction of production was the only practical method of com-
bating the evil, agreed to the Australian proposal in principle but on the following conditions:
?i. That the producing countries agreed to reduce their production.
?2. That the interests of the consuming countries were fully protected in the matter
of their obtaining adequate supplies to meet their reasonable requirements for medical
and scientific purposes. ?
This resolution was accepted by the producing countries, but the conditions laid down by
Sub-Committee D were not acceptable to the producing countries. The delegate of the United


States of America was also unable to accept the resolution without further instructions from his
Government, but subsequently explained that he could accept it in principle on certain conditions
to be stated later.
In view of this result, the Committee was unable to arrive at an agreed decision on the Cuban
and Austrian proposals.
Persian Memorandum. l
The Sub-Committee agreed to the following resolution
?The Sub-Committee, having given consideration to the Persian Memorandum (Docu-
ment O.D.C. 24), particularly those clauses relating to:
Revenues pages 8 and 9
Persian policy page 20
General policy page 21
Unconditional assurances page 22
Source of funds page 24
Moratorium page 25
Customs page 25
?Fully appreciates the difficulties confronting Persia in immediately carrying out the
desire to reduce the production of opium in Persia to amounts needed for medical and scientific
purposes in Persia and for export for the same purposes.
?It therefore recommends to the Conference the following resolution:
? ?The Conference has had presented for its consideration a very complete and
valuable memorandum prepared by the Government of Persia setting forth in a clear
and comprehensive manner the existing situation in Persia with regard to the production
and trade in opium and the numerous measures agricultural, economic and financial
which, in the opinion of the Persian Government, must necessarily be carried out before
any effective scheme for the reduction and control of production can be introduced in
that country. The memorandum points out that these measures require for their initia-
tion the obtaining by the Persian Government of financial assistance from the Powers
which this Conference is not in a position to secure. The Conference considers that a
case for enquiry has been made out and therefore recommends to the Council of the League
of Nations that a Committee of Experts with the necessary qualifications be sent under
the auspices of the League to make a full enquiry into the facts as stated in the memo-
randum as well as into the practicability of the proposed measures and their suitability
for the attainment of the end in view namely, the effective control and limitation
of the production of opium in Persia in accordance with the terms of the Convention to
be adopted by this Conference, in the hope that, in the event of the case of the Persian Govern-
ment being established, the report of the said Committee may demonstrate that adequate
guarantees as to the probable success of the proposed measures are obtainable to justify
the taking of the measures proposed by the Government of Persia, and, if necessary,
the issue of a loan in the money markets of the world for the purpose of providing the
Government of Persia with the financial assistance required, or such assistance as the
Commission may find to be required. ? ?
At a subsequent meeting of the Sub-Committee the Persian delegate H. H, Prince Arfa-
ed-Dowleh stated that, apart from the United States proposal, the English text of which he
had sent to Teheran and to which he had received his Government?s reply, he could not, without
referring to his Government, accept any part of the report which directly concerned Persia. He
made a special reservation with regard to the following passage in the above-mentioned resolu-
tion: ?In the hope that, in the event of the case of the Persian Government being established ",
as he believed and maintained that his Government?s standpoint was quite correct and had been
established.

REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE C.
Approved by the Sub-Committee on January 3�lh> 1 9 2 5-
Sub-Committee C, having considered the information of the delegate of Bolivia regarding
the innocuous use of coca-leaves by the Bolivian people, came to the conclusion that the limita-
tion of the production of coca-leaves to the amount necessary for medical and scientific purposes
cannot be realised, as it would imply the absolute prohibition of the harmless consumption of
coca-leaves in several South-American States. In Java this limitation of the production of coca-
leaves would also be inadvisable, as it would imply the extirpation of all coca-shrubs used by the
natives as living hedges, the leaves of which are never consumed nor exported.
1 See Annexes to Minutes of Sub-Committee B.


The Sub-Committee proceeded then to examine the limitation of the production of coca-
leaves for export purposes, which also proved not to be feasible in the coca-growing South American
countries, as no distinction exists between the production for domestic consumption and for
export purposes. In Java such limitation was declared to be quite possible, as, apart from the
coca-shrubs used as living hedges, coca-leaves are solely produced as a secondary product on
plantations for export purposes; domestic consumption, as mentioned before, is unknown in Java.
If all coca-producing countries would agree to do the same, and, moreover, if all countries which
do not grow coca-leaves at present will abstain from coca-growing in the future, the Govern-
ment of the Netherlands Indies would be willing and able to limit the production of coca-leaves
for export purposes. As such an agreement did not appear to be possible at that time, the Sub-
Committee finally agreed upon the method of indirect limitation of the production for export
purposes by the application of the system of import certificates and export authorisations on each
exportation or importation of coca-leaves; in this way the traffic in coca-leaves will be brought
under strict national control and also under the supervision of the Central Board. The Sub-
Committee is convinced that by this means the end arrived at by the Conference may satisfactorily
be accomplished. It therefore proposes to the Conference to adopt, in conformity with the
suggestions of the Advisory Committee, the following conclusions:
1. Article 2 of the Hague Convention of 1912 shall be extended to apply to coca-leaves;
2. The system of import certificates and export authorisations shall be extended to apply
to coca-leaves.

REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE D.
Rapporteur: Mr. Shepherd, Delegate of Australia.
The Sub-Committee decided to proceed with its work independently of the other Sub-Com-
mittees and that the Rapporteur should endeavour to ascertain what was being done by the other
Sub-Committees.
The Advisory Committee?s suggestions were taken as the basis for discussion.
Part I of Advisory Committee?s Proposals.
Article 1.
The Committee accepted in principle the Advisory Committee?s recommendations. The
American proposals were examined, and the absence of any reference to heroin was noted. Note
was also taken of the provisions for the supply of the estimates under the various headings as
set out in these proposals.
The opinion of the Sub-Committee was that these proposals concerned more particularly
other Sub-Committees. The understanding was that the consuming countries were prepared
to supply the particulars in such form as might be agreed to by the producing countries.
Article 2.
The Advisory Committee?s proposals were agreed to in principle on the understanding that
the article would be interpreted in the light of the provisions as set out in Annex 2, paragraph 6,
of the Advisory Committee?s report.
It was further stipulated that the interests of the consuming countries must be fully protected
in the event of short supplies or through combinations of producers or manufacturers so that
the non-consuming countries should not be penalised in the matter of prices or adequate supplies
for medical or scientific purposes. In connection with Article 2, the Sub-Committee could not
accept the American proposal which provided for the fixing of quantities by the Central Board.
Article 3.
This was agreed to in principle, with the reservation that a suggestion should be made to the
Conference that half the members of the Central Board should consist of repiesentatives of
consuming countries who were neither producers nor manufacturers.
Article 4.
The Sub-Committee was unable to accept the obligation to supply quarterly statistics as
stipulated in the Advisory Committee?s recommendations and the proposals in Article 20-D
of the American proposals, because it was impossible in some countries to supply these statistics
every three months, especially in regard to manufacture and wholesale stocks. Moreover, it
was understood that producing countries were only able to supply their statistics yearly, and it
was not thought necessary for producing countries to supply them more frequently. It was
agreed to supply the statistics within six months, not three months, as mentioned in paragraph (0).
The Sub-Committee agreed to incorporate the suggestion in Section I, paragraph [a), of the
American proposals that the source and destination of imports should be specified, but statistics
should only be supplied yearly. _ . , .
{h) The question of wholesale stocks ?in Government or in private hands was considered
to be really a question for the producing countries, but there was no objection to the proposal.


Section 2 of the American Proposals.
These proposals concerned Sub-Committee A.
Section 3 of the American Proposals.
These proposals concerned producing countries only.
The remaining proposals were considered after the examination of Article 5 and of the cor-
responding American proposals.
Considerable discussion took place on the proposals contained in Article 4 and Article 5 on
the question of the power conferred on the Central Board to ?fix the amount of the reasonable
requirements ? of a country and to prohibit the export of further quantities in cases where esti-
mates were exceeded.
The general opinion of the Sub-Committee was that it could not agree to any such limitation
of the sovereign powers of a State and that it should be left to each country to control its internal
consumption.
It was also considered that, in view of the alteration made in Articles 4 and 5 regarding the
provision of statistics annually instead of quarterly, Articles 4 and 5 would require redrafting.
It would be impossible for the Central Board to arrive at a decision ?during the same year?.
It would only be possible to do this after the close of the year.
Article 5.
Further discussion took place on this article on the question of the powers of the Board;
it was therefore taken in sections:
I. The action to be taken in cases of countries which furnished no estimates for their require-
ments.
The Committee considered that the Board should be empowered to fix the quantities to be
supplied and that the whole of the remaining portion of the article should apply to those countries.
11. With regard to countries which furnished estimates and the powers of the Board, the
Committee considered that the words ?and to be likely to be used in part for the illicit traffic ?
where objectionable, as they were really a charge of bad faith on the part of the country.
The Committee therefore decided that these words should be deleted.
The Committee also decided to include the suggestion contained in the American proposals
that action on the part of the Board should be taken only after investigation.
It recommended, therefore, the addition of the following words: ?after enquiry and publica-
tion of the results of this enquiry
The Sub-Committee objected to the Central Board being empowered to ?fix ?? but had no
objection to the Board ? indicating ? to a country that it was likely to exceed its estimate.
The article, as amended, was then agreed to by the Sub-Committee.
Portugal made a reservation, and submitted a memorandum 1 explaining the reasons for the
reservation.
Article 6.
The wording of this article was considered to be very indefinite, and the Committee was
unable to arrive at any decision as to the meaning of the article and its application namely,
whether it applied to producing countries only. Several delegates strongly objected to the
clause, but, in the absence of a clear interpretation, Sir Malcolm Delevingne was invited to attend
a later meeting of the Sub-Committee and explain the reasons for including the article.
The Sub-Committee was, however, unable to agree upon the necessity for the clause in its
present form and suggested that if the clause was still considered necessary it should be redrafted
to make clear the intention and determine the special cases to which it would be applicable.
Article 13.
The Committee decided that this clause was essential for the protection of the signatories
of the Convention, and the clause was accepted with the addition of the last sentence of the
American proposals modified to read as follows:
The Central Board shall communicate periodically to all the parties to this Convention
the amount fixed in respect of each country or territory and the situation as regards the
exports and re-exports thereto.?
Australian, Austrian and Cuban Proposals.
The Australian, Austrian and Cuban proposals had the same objective namely, the limita-
tion of the production to strictly medical and scientific requirements. It being the general desire
of the consuming countries to limit production to the actual requirements, the discussion on the
three proposals was taken concurrently, but as the Australian proposal was the most definite
and comprehensive, it was taken as the basis for discussion. It recommended that the production
of the growth of the raw materials in all countries which did not at present produce poppy or
coca-leaf should be prohibited.
The Committee realised that this proposal imposed a very heavy obligation on non-producing
countries, but, as restriction of production was one of the most effective methods of combating
the evil, agreed to the Australian proposal in principle but on the following conditions:
1 See Minutes of Sub-Committee D, Annex 2.


I. That the producing countries should undertake on their part to reduce their pro-
duction.
11. That the interests of the consuming countries should be fully protected in the matter
of their obtaining adequate supplies to meet their reasonable requirements for medical and
scientific purposes.
Portuguese Memorandum.
The Sub-Committee took note of the memorandum submitted by the Portuguese delegation
(Document O. D. C./S. C. D./3) relating to the composition and competence of the Central Board.
Without pronouncing on this memorandum, the Sub-Committee drew the attention of the Con-
ference to the memorandum and suggested that it should be submitted for consideration of the
Central Board if the latter were constituted.
Report of Sub-Committee F.
The Sub-Committee considered the report (Document O. D. C./S. C. F./5 (1) and saw no
objection to its adoption in view of the fact that the interests of consuming countries appeared
to be fully safeguarded since it was left to each country to determine its own requirements,

REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE E.
adopted on January 29 th } 1925.
Sub-Committee E was charged by the Conference with the examination of a number of pro-
posals for strengthening the provisions of the Hague Convention in regard to the national and
international control over the substances to which that Convention applies. The most important
of these proposals were those contained in Part II of the measures suggested by the Opium Advisory
Committee of the League of Nations, and the corresponding provisions, which follow in the main the
proposals of the Advisory Committee, submitted by the delegation of the United States.
The Sub-Committee is glad to be able to report that it has arrived at a unanimous conclusion,
subject only to one reservation, on the important matters which it has had to consider.
The proposals submitted to it referred in the main to the control to be exercised over the
international traffic, and the Sub-Committee had the advantage of the assistance of expert advisers
attached to several of the delegations. . J
The general object of the proposals in Part II of the Advisory Committee?s scheme is explained
in the latter part of the explanatory note contained in Annex 2 of the Report of the Work of the
Sixth Session of that Committee (Document A.32.1924.X1).
It is there pointed out that ?experience during the three years which have elapsed since the
Convention came|into force has shown that there are loopholes in the existing provisions by which
persons engaged in illicit traffic can evade the control over the national and international trade ,
and the proposals of the Advisory Committee aim in particular at establishing a much closer control
over the international movement of the substances to which the Convention applies. The principal
provisions for the control of the international traffic in the existing Convention are contained in
Articles 111, IV, V (which relate to raw opium) and Articles X (6), XII and XIII (which relate to
the manufactured drugs). The object of these provisions is to confine to authorised persons the
right to export and import the substances covered by the Convention and to prevent the export
of the substances from one country to any unauthorised persons in another country; but no ade-
quate machinery is provided for securing this object effectively. The proposals of the Advisory
Committee would t xpand these provisions and lay down in detail the methods by which the control
of the international trade is to be carried out.
These proposals have been thoroughly examined by Sub-Committee E and have been adopted
by them in the main. Certain modifications have been introduced, which relate chiefly to points
of detail. A text of the provisions as proposed by the Sub-Committee for inclusion in the Con-
vention to be adopted by the Conference is appended to this report (see Appendix I, and for the
convenience of the Conference the modifications introduced by the Sub-Committee are indicated
Chapters I and II lay down two principles which are essential to the effective control of the
international traffic. The first of these is that a separate import authorisation or export authorisa-
tion from the Government shall be required in the case of each importation and exportation, this
secures that every international transaction in the substances covered by the Convention comes
under the consideration of the Government before it is carried out. The second is that an export
authorisation shall only be issued by the Government of the exporting country on the production
of a certificate from the Government of the importing country that the import into the latter country
of the consignment proposed to be exported has been approved. The production of such a certi-
ficate is a guarantee to the Government of the exporting country that its exports are destined
for persons duly authorised by their Government to receive the drugs and for purposes which
are legitimate. The manner in which the import certificte system operates has been fully


explained in the memorandum circulated by the Secretary-General of the League on the advice
of the Opium Advisory Committee, which will be found in Document C.L.15.1922. Those two
principles have already been adopted by many Governments. It is hoped that one result of the
present Conference will be to secure their general adoption by all countries. Until that is done,
the control over the international traffic will be completely effective.
A model form of import certificate has been recommended by the League of Nations for
adoption by the Governments which accept the system. The Sub-Committee considers that it
would be desirable that this form should be followed as closely as possible by all signatory States
and recommends that it should be included in an annex to the new Convention as a model recom-
mended for adoption by the signatory States.
It is recognised that the requirement of an import certificate can be applied only in the case
of export to countries which are parties to the Convention or, at least, accept the import certificate
system. The Government of an exporting country will not be compelled to require the production
of an import certificate in respect of exports to a country which is outside the Convention and does
not agree to furnish such certificates. It is to be understood that in these cases the principle above
mentioned will not apply, but at the same time a moral obligation will rest on the Government of
the exporting country not to allow the export of the substances in excessive quantities to countries
which decline to furnish import certificates and to co-operate in the system of international control
and which in some cases are known to be centres of the illicit traffic.
It will not perhaps be necessary to refer in detail to the minor modifications introduced by
Sub-Committee E in the proposals of the Advisory Committee, but one or two points may be
noted.
It will be noticed, on a comparison of Chapter I with Chapter 11, paragraph 3, that, while an
import authorisation may allow a supply of the substances to be imported in more than one
consignment, a similar latitude is not allowed in the case of exportation. The reason for this will
be apparent on an examination of the proposals as a whole. In the case of an importation it will
not be possible for the importer to know beforehand whether the person in the other country from
whom he is obtaining the supply will be able to send it in a single consignment or not, and as the
import authorisation has to be issued before he can order the goods, provision must be made to
allow the importation to be effected in more than one consignment. The case is different in regard
to exports. The general scheme requires that a copy of the export authorisation must accompany
the goods, and it would lead to great confusion if the export authorisation allowed the despatch
of the goods in more than one consignment and there was a difference between the amount specified
in the export authorisation and the quantity of goods in the consignment. It is proposed, there-
fore, that where the goods have to be sent in separate consignments, a separate export authorisation
should be obtained in respect of each consignment. This should lead to no difficulty in practice.
Chapter 11, paragraphs 4 and 5, will enable the authorities to follow up the export and provides
a safeguard against its divers on to illicit purposes. In the first place, it is provided that a copy of the
export authorisation must accompany the consignment. It is understood that the usual procedure
would be, in the case of consignments sent by sea, that the copy should be handed to the captain
or other responsible officer of the ship, and, in the case of goods sent overland by train, to the
responsible railway official in charge of the goods, and so on.
In the second place, it is required that the Government issu?ng the export authorisation shall
send a copy to the Government of the importing country, and that the latter Government shall
return the copy to the Government of the exporting country, when the importation has been
effected, with a notification of the amount received. The Sub-Committee considers that the
copy should be sent direct from the competent authorities in the one country to the competent
authorities in the other and not through the diplomatic channels.
Chapters 111 and IV (relating to the manufactured drugs) correspond to Chapters I and II
(relating to raw opium). It is unnecessary therefore to say anything in regard to the provisions
in Chapters 111 and IV.
Special provisions are inserted in Chapters II (para. 7), IV (para. 7) and VII to adapt the
system of control to the case of ?bonded warehouses ?.
Chapter Vis a provision of great importance. Free ports not being subject to the ordinary
control of the Customs authorities of the territory in which they are situated, the illicit traffickers
have been able in the past to evade control by making use of the free ports. Attention has been
called by the Opium Advisory Committee to this means of evasion, and the question has been
reported upon by the Transit Committee of the League (See Annex 7 to Minutes of the Fourth
Session of the Advisory Committee, Document C.155. M.75.1923). In consequence of the attention
so called, a number of Governments have already adopted and are enforcing measures of control
over imports and exports of the drugs in their free ports.
On the consideration of this chapter the Italian representative pointed out that the Italian
Government is disposed to prohibit entirely the introduction into the free ports in Italy of the
substances covered by the Convention. It is not suggested by the .Sub-Committee that countries
which have already more drastic provisions in force than those suggested in chapter V should weaken
their provisions, and it recommends that the Drafting Committee, when settling the wording of
this chapter, should insert a provision to meet such cases.
Chapter VI is a redraft of Article 7 (X) and (XI) of the Advisory Committee?s proposals, which
has been prepared by the expert advisers who have assisted the Committee. In the opinion of
the Sub-Committee, the redraft both simplifies and renders more effective the procedure for
exercising control over consignments in transit whether there is a change of conveyance {e.g. tran-
shipment) or not during transit. The drafting at present is somewhat lengthy, but this could be
left to the Drafting Committee to improve.
Attention may specially be called to the opening lines of the chapter, which are designed
m particular to meet the case of goods in transit along international waterways. There are a


number of cases in which, under treaty, goods pass along international waterways without inter-
ference from the authorities of the countries through which the waterways pass. For instance,
goods going by sea to Antwerp along the waters of the Scheldt are exempt from interference
by the Dutch authorities. Other cases which may be mentioned are international canals such as
the Suez Canal and the great lakes of North America which are situated partly m the territories
of the United States and partly in the territories of Canada.
The Sub-Committee has also had to consider the question of transport by air.
Where the aircraft is permitted by international agreement to fly over the territory of an
intervening country without landing, it would be impossible, as well as unnecessary, to apply
the stipulations of Chapter VI. .
In cases where the aircraft is required by the law of the intervening country to land m its
territory or does, in fact, land in the territory, there will be no difficulty m applying the stipula-
tions of Chapter VI when the landing takes place at an authorised landing place at which the
Customs officials or?other authorised representatives of the State authorities are present. On
the other hand if the landing is effected at some place which is not an authorised landing place,
it may not be possible in all cases for the authorities of the intervening country to apply the sti-
pulations of Chapter VI. . , , Qrr ? lo+o
The Sub-Committee has accordingly inserted a provision m the foregoing sense to regulate
the application of Chapter VI to transport by air of the substances covered by the Convention.
A proposal was submitted to the Sub-Committee that if any person fails to produce any
document as required by paragraph i of Chapter VI, or diverts, or attempts to divert, without
an authorisation as required by paragraph 2, any consignment to a destination other than th t
named in the export authorisation or diversion certificate, he shall be guilty of an offence, and the
consignment shall be liable to confiscation, whoever may be the owner of it. The Sub-Committee
agrees with this proposal, but it considers that any provisions as to penalties or confiscation
should appear in an article in the Convention applying generally to the provisions of the Conven-
tion and that the drafting of such an article should be referred to the Drafting Committee
Chapter VIII is new. Any interference with the drugs while in transit will make it easy
for the illicit traffickers to evade control. Many cases have come to light in which the drugs
had been abstracted from the packages while in transit and replaced by other goods
The Sub-Committee endorses the recommendation m Part 111, Article 2, of the Advisory
Committee?s proposals and suggests that it might be appended to the Convention adopted y
the Second Conference in a protocol (Appendix I, Part 2). The reasons for the recommendation
are the following: A ship of country A may be engaged in smuggling opium from country B to
countrv C without touching at any port in country A and without, therefore, coming under t e
control of the authorities of country A. A large amount of the illicit traffic m opium carried
on in this way. The Sub-Committee recognises that some Governments may find difficulty
in applying such a provision, and will require to examine it carefully before it can adopt it. it
is for this reason that it has not proposed that it should be inserted as a definite provision in t e
Convention itself. . . . v , , -r ,?? +T . Tr t*
The Sub-Committee also recognises that the provision will not be applicable it country i
is not a party to the Convention and does not issue export authorisations. The Drafting Committee
should be asked, in settling the terms of the recommendation, to provide for such cases.
In Article 7 (VI) of its proposals, the Advisory Committee recommends the omission, at tfie
end of Article X of the Hague Convention, of the words ?this rule shall not necessarily apply to
medical prescriptions and to sales by duly authorised chemists ?. The effect of this proposal
would have been to require that all sales on medical prescriptions and by duly authorised die
mists should be registered. It was pointed out in the Sub-Committee that this would not fit
in with the systems of control over such sales in certain countries, and it was unanimously agreed,
in place of omitting the words altogether, to substitute for them the words this requiremen
shall not necessarily apply either to supplies by medical practitioners,to their patients or to sales
by duly authorised chemists on medical prescriptions, if the medical prescriptions are duly he
and preserved by the medical practitioner or chemist ,
As regards Article 20 in the United States draft, it was pointed out that it would not be
possible to make the possession of coca-leaves illegal in countries where the coca-plant grows
wild, and the Committee has, in view of this and of other objections, not felt able to make any
recommendation at the present stage.
The Sub-Committee discussed at length the recommendations of the Advisory Committee
in Part 111 (1) of its proposals that each Government should forbid any person within its ]un -
diction from procuring or assisting the Commission in any place outside juris ic ion J Y
offence against the laws in force in such place ? relating to the control, etc. of the drugs. The Su -
Committee entirely approves the principle of this proposal hut attention was called tc. the tact
that there may be constitutional difficulties in the way of its acceptance y c '-''
The First Opium Conference, which had a similar proposal before it and had to take accou
of the same difficulties, adopted a text as follows;
?The Contracting Powers will examine in the most favourable spirit the possibility of
taking legislative measures to render punishable illegitimate transactions which are came
out in another country by a person residing within their territories.
The Sub-Committee felt that it would be difficult to recommend a different text for adoption
by the Second Conference, and it accordingly suggests that an article on the same lines as Article 9
of the First Conference Agreement should be adopted by the Second Conference. The delegate
of the United States made a reservation in favour of the adoption of the origma P rO P
the Advisory Committee, to which effect is given in Article 20 -F of the Uni e aes r


The Sub-Committee approves the proposal in Article 7 (I) "the Advisory Committee s pro-
posals and Article 2 of the United States proposals that Article II of the Hague Convention should
be extended to coca-leaves. . ?
A new proposal has been submitted to the Sub-Committee that Article IV ot the Hague
Convention, which provides that ?every package containing raw opium intended for expert
shall be marked in such a way as to indicate its contents, provided that the consignment exceed
five kilogrammes ?, should be suppressed. It has been found that marks indicating that a par-
ticular packet contains raw opium are a help to opium thieves and are of no real value for the
purpose of the control over the traffic. The proposed requirement that a copy of the export
authorisation must in future accompany the goods will provide a much more effective safeguard.
The Sub-Committee therefore approves the proposal and recommends its adoption by the Con-
ference. , , ,
The attention of the Sub-Committee has been called to two other matters: (1) the importance
of adequate penalties being attached to infractions of the national laws which are adopted to give
effect to the provisions of the new Convention; (2) the desirability of the adoption by all States
of the practice of direct exchange of information between the competent authorities of the States
in regard to the illicit traffic and the persons engaged in it. The Sub-Committee is impressed
with the importance of these matters, and it recommends: (a) the insertion in the new Convention
of an article providing for the punishment of infractions of the law by adequate penalties, and
(where appropriate) the confiscation of the substances in respect of which the infraction has been
committed; ( b) the adoption of a vceu recommending that all States should co-operate as closely
as possible with one another in the suppression of the illicit traffic and that they should authorise
the competent authority charged with the administration of the law on the subject to commu-
nicate directly with the corresponding authorities in other countries.
Appendix I.
Section I
TEXT OF PROVISIONS PROPOSED BY SUB-COMMITTEE E FOR INSERTION IN A
NEW CONVENTION.
The following article (numbered 2 bis ) shall be added to the Convention:
? ? Each Contracting Power shall require that a separate import authorisation, stating
the quantity to he imported and the name and address of the importer and the name and address
of the exporter, must be obtained for each importation of raw opium or coca-leaves. The
import authorisation shall specify the period within which the importation must he effected and
may allow the importation in more than one consignment. ?
Article 3 shall be replaced by the following article:
1. ?Each Contracting Power shall require that a separate export authorisation must be

For the purpose of ensuring the full application and enforcement of the provisions of the
Convention, as amended by this agreement, in free ports and free zones, the Governments undertake
to apply in free ports and free zones situated within their territories the same laws and regulations
and to exercise the same supervision and control in respect of the substances covered by the Con-
vention, as amended by this agreement, as in other parts of their territories.
Subject to the provisions of any international agreement or treaty limiting the control which may
be exercised by any of the Contracting Powers over the substances covered by the Convention, as
amended by this agreement, when in direct transit:
1. No consignment of any of the substances covered by the Convention, as amended by this
agreement, which is exported from one country to another country shall be permitted to pass through
the territory of a third country, whether or not it is removed from the ship or conveyance in which
it is being conveyed, unless the copy of the export authorisation {or the diversion certificate, if such
a certificate has been issued in pursuance of the following paragraph), which accompanies the
consignment, is produced to the competent authorities of that country.
2. The competent authorities of any country through whose territory a consignment of any
of the substances covered by the Convention, as amended by this agreement, is permitted to pass
shall take all due measures to prevent the diversion of the consignment, to a destination other than
that named in the copy of the export authorisation or the diversion certificate which accompanies it,
unless the Government of that country has authorised that diversion by means of a special diversion
certificate. A diversion certificate shall only be issued after the receipt of an import certificate in
accordance with Article 3 or Article 13 from the Government of the country to which it is proposed to


divert the consignment and shall contain the same particulars as are required by Article 3 or
Article 13 to he stated in an export authorisation, together with the name of the country from which
the consignment was originally exported; and all the provisions of Article 3 or Article 13 which
are applicable to an export authorisation shall he applicable equally to the diversion certificate.
Further, the Government of the country authorising the diversion of the consignment shall detain
the copy of the original export authorisation or diversion certificate which accompanied the con-
signment on arrival in its territory and shall return it to the Government which issued it, at the
same time notifying the name of the country to which the diversion has been authorised.
In cases where the transport is being effected by air, the provisions of this Article shall not be
applicable if the aircraft passes over the territory of the third country without landing. If the
aircraft lands in the territory of the said country, the provisions of this Article shall be applied so
far as the circumstances permit.
The provisions of this article shall not apply to transport of the substances by post.
VII.
A consignment of any of the substances covered by the Convention, as amended by this
Agreement, which is landed in any country and placed in a bonded warehouse shall not be allowes
by the Government of that country to be withdrawn from the bonded warehouse unless an impord
certificate, issued by the Government of the country of destination and certifying that the importat
tion is approved, is produced to the authorities having jurisdiction over the bonded warehouse-
A special authorisation shall be issued by the Government in respect of each consignment so with-
drawn and shall take the place of the export authorisation for the purpose of the preceding provi-
sions of this Agreement.
VIII.
Any consignment of the substances covered by the Convention, as amended by this Agreement, while
passing in transit through the territories of a country or whilst being stored there in a bonded warehouse,
may not be subjected to any process which would alter the nature of the substances in question, or,
without the permission of the competent authorities, the packing.
Section 2.
Recommendation proposed for Adoption by the Conference.
That each Government should forbid the conveyance in any ship sailing under its flag of any
consignment of the substances covered by the Convention as amended by this Agreement:
1. Unless an export authorisation has been issued in respect of such consignment in
accordance with the provisions of the Convention as so amended and the consignment is
accompanied by an official copy of such authorisation, or of any diversion certificate which
may be issued ;
2. To any destination other than the destination mentioned in the export authorisation
or diversion certificate.
Section 3.
Article 7 (VI) of the Advisory Committee?s proposals:
?In Article 10 the words?The Contracting Powers shall control ? shall be substituted for
The Contracting Powers shall use their best endeavours to control or to cause to be controlled?,
and the words?The Contracting Parties shall adopt ? shall be substituted for?The Contracting
Powers shall use their best endeavours to adopt or cause to be adopted ?.
?The words or shall make to the competent authorities an official declaration that they
are so engaged ? shall be omitted,
?The words?This rule shall not necessarily apply to medical prescriptions and to sales by
duly authorised chemists ? shall be omitted. ?
and Articles 10 and 11 of the proposals submitted by the United States of America:
Article 10. ??? The Contracting Parties shall control all persons manufacturing, importing,
selling, distributing or exporting morphine, cocaine or their respective salts or derivatives
as well as the buildings in which these persons carry on such industry or trade.
?With this object, the Contracting Parties shall:
? {a) Confine the manufacture of morphine, cocaine and their respective salts and deri-
vatives to those establishments and premises alone which have been licensed
for the purpose or obtain information respecting the establishments and premises
in which these drugs are manufactured and keep a register of them;
? (b) Require that all persons engaged in the manufacture, import, sale, distribution,
or export of morphine, cocaine or their respective salts or derivatives shall obtain
a licence or permit to engage in these operations;
?(c) Require that such persons shall enter in their books the quantities manufactured,
the imports, sales and all other distribution, and exports of morphine, cocaine
and their respective salts and derivatives. ?


Article ii. "The Contracting Parties shall take measures to prohibit, as regards their
internal trade, the delivery of morphine, cocaine and their respective salts and deri-
vatives to any unauthorised persons. ?
are approved (subject to redaction of the wording of the Committee of Redaction) with the following
exception: (i) no recommendation is made on the proposal to add the words "and derivatives ?
which had been referred to Sub-Committee F; (2) instead of the omission of the words "This rule
shall not necessarily apply, etc. ? at the end of Article 10 of the Hague Convention, it is pro-
posed that these words should be replaced by the following: ?This requirement shall not neces-
sarily apply either to supplies of medical practitioners to their patients or to sales by duly author-
ised chemists on medical prescriptions, if the medical prescriptions are duly filed and preserved
by the medical practitioner or chemist?.
It is not possible to settle the text of Article 20, as proposed to be amended by the United
States of America, until it is known what decisions have been taken by the Conference in regard
to the production of raw opium or coca leaves.
Sub-Committee E recommends that Part II (1) of the proposals of the Opium Advisory
Committee and Article 20-F of the proposals submitted by the United States of America should
be replaced by Article 9 of the First Opium Conference Agreement. The delegate of the United
States of America makes a reservation in favour of the original proposal.
The Norwegian proposals, Part 11, paragraph 2, (Document O.D.C. 20):
?The Norwegian Government cannot accede to the proposal for the deletion of the last
sentence in Article 10 of the Hague Convention if that is to be taken to mean that chemists
would have to enter in their books, together with the name of the purchaser, each consign-
ment of opium, etc., or of drugs containing the foregoing substances, a d to notify the author-
ities of the facts. Such a provision would be too drastic and is not essential for the purposes
of control. It would, moreover, appear to be impracticable. While dealing with this subject,
we desire to state that pharmacies in Norway are regularly inspected by the authorities
and that the licenc system at present governing the opening of pharmacies in that country
is, from the standpoint of control, equivalent to a State Monopoly. ?
are covered by the amendment to Article 10 of the Hague Convention proposed above.
The Austrian proposals (Document O.D.C. 20 (a)}
"The Federal Government is unable to agree to the proposal contained in Nos. 11l and
VIII of Section IX to the effect that when a copy of the export licence does not accompany
the consignment, the Government issuing the export licence shall send a copy to the Govern-
ment of the importing country. The Federal Government thinks that a measure of this
kind would merely give excessive work to the authorities concerned without appreciably
contributing to the suppression of illicit traffic. As the Federal Government has already
ventured to point out when submitting its report for the year 1923, it is in principle prepared
to issue licences in quadruplicate. In its opinion it would be well to render this rule universal
and to lay down that one of these copies should accompany each consignment. Should the
Governments of an exporting country so request, it might further be laid down that the
copy of the export licence accompanying the goods should be returned to the Government
in question with an affidavit by the Government of the importing country to the effect that
the importation has actually taken place.
?As regards the proposal contained in No. I namely, that, in the case of a consign-
ment of narcotics passing in transit through the territory of a third country without being
removed from the ship or conveyance in which it is being conveyed, a declaration should be
made to the authorities of the country of transit of the contents of the consignment and the
country for which it is destined the Federal Government feels that it should point out
that the authorities of the country through which the goods pass are not in a position to apply
the provisions concerning the control in traffic in narcotics to goods transported in closed
receptacles which are not removed from the means of transport which, in other words,
remain during transit under Customs seal. The control of such consignments by the author-
ities of the countries through which they pass would be going too far and would not, more-
over, produce any results unless part at least of some of the packages chosen at ransom were
to be examined. The authorities of a country of transit are not, however, entitled unless
they have serious suspicions concerning the contents ?to open these packages. It should,
moreover, be borne in mind that, according to the Convention for the Simplification of
Customs Formalities, concluded on November 3rd, 1923, all excessive or useless formalities
should be avoided. In the opinion of the Federal Government, a copy of the export certificate
accompanying the goods should be sufficient to warrant the consignment. ?
are covered by the decisions taken on Part II of the Opium Advisory Committee?s proposals.
The Egyptian proposals (Document O.D.C. 44, paragraph 3), were withdrawn.
It is provisionally recommended that Article 4 of the Hague Opium Convention should be
suppressed. The delegate of the United States of America reserved the right to bring the matter
up at a later date.
The extension of Article 2 of the Hague Convention to include coca-leaves, as suggested
in the proposals of the Opium Advisory Committee and the United States of America, was accepted.

REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE F
on the Enquiries carried out by the Health Committee at the Request of the
Advisory Committee on the Traffic in Opium into the Legitimate Requirements
in Narcotic Drugs.
Chairman and Rapporteur: Dr. H. Carriers.
The Conference set up a special Sub-Committee, composed of medical, pharmaceutical and
statistical experts, ?to consider the report of the Health Committee of the League of Nations
regarding the medical requirements in narcotics and all other information which has been collected
by the Preparatory Committee of the Second Opium Conference or which may be placed at the
disposal of the Sub-Committee. ?
This Sub-Committee carefully considered the report submitted to it and instructed me to
report on the matter to the First Committee. But before doing so it seems to me that it would be
useful to give a brief account of the problem.
The Advisory Committee on the Traffic in Opium was of opinion that, in order to provide
a reliable basis for the study of the limitation of the production of narcotics, with which the
Second Conference had to deal, it was essential to know what were the amounts of these products
required for the legitimate needs of the world. A Mixed Commission, composed of members
of the Advisory Committee and of the Health Committee of the League of Nations, was instructed
to examine this problem, taking as a basis the data obtained from the various Governments by
the Opium Section of the League of Nations. After defining the expression ?legitimate require-
ments ? and recognising that the only legitimate requirements were medicinal and scientific
requirements, the Sub-Committee thought it was justified in fixing these requirements, calculated
in terms of raw opium with 10 per cent of morphine, at the round figure of 600 milligrammes
per head per year.
The Mixed Sub-Committee?s report having been submitted to the Health Committee, the latter
after caiefully examining the data on which it was based, considered that the figure of 600 mg.
was too high and reduced it to 450 mg. subject to the proviso, however, that this figure should,
be considered as a maximum, and, since it had been based solely on the estimates furnished by
countries possessing a highly developed system of medical assistance, it could only apply to coun-
tries in which similar conditions obtained.
1 Where the use of prepared opium has not yet been suppressed and it is desired to import raw opium for
the manufacture of prepared opium, the certificate should be to the effect that the raw opium to be imported
is required for the purpose of manufacturing prepared opium for use under Government restrictions pending
complete suppression and that it will not be re-exported.


The Preparatory Committee of the Second Opium Conference, after noting the report of the
Health Committee, requested the Chairman of that Committee to pursue these enquiries and to
complete the data on which the figure of 450 mg. is based, so as to be able to justify this figure
before the future Conference and to authorise the He t Ith Section to take the necessary measures
in order to obtain such supplementary information.
The Health Committee readily complied with this request and endeavoured to complete
its documentation on this subject by applying to a new source i.e. ,it sought to ascertain the
consumption of opium and opiates in hospitals and by sickness insurance societies. It was believed
that the data supplied by these establishments would attain a greater degree of accuracy than those
derived from general enquiries, and that it would be possible to obtain from them data applicable
to the whole population. The data collected from a number of establishments and given in Docu-
ment C. H. 264 were submitted to a critical examination by an expert in this matter Professor
Knaffl-Lenz. The estimates which Professor Knaffl-Lenz was able to form after having studied
these data show a remarkable concordance and approximate very nearly the figure of 400 mg.
of raw opium per head per year. This concordance tends to show that the figure of 450 mg. based
on the data furnished by the various Governments was not wholly arbitrary. For the details
of these estimates, reference should be made to Document C.H. 264 quoted above. It should
be noted that Table V (page 15) contains certain errors of calculation or printing which should
be corrected; for example, in the case of Belgium, the quantity of cocaine is 9 mm. (instead of
one) and, in the case of Poland, 6 mm. (instead of 10). The Health Committee therefore believed
it was justified in adopting it, and has explained its point of view in a report communicated to
the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee. This report was submitted to Sub-Committee F
for examination, and the latter embodied the result of this scrutiny in the following recommenda-
tions, after a full discussion both of the report itself and of the documents on which it is based.
?The Sub-Committee of the International Opium Conference set up to examine the
report of the Health Committee of the League of Nations regarding the legitimate needs
of opium and its derivatives;
?Considers that these requirements might be fixed at the round figure of 450 mg. of raw
opium at 10 per cent of morphine per head per year;
?It being understood, however:
?That this figure represents a maximum, and as it was established solely on the basis
of estimates furnished by countries possessing a highly developed system of medical assistance,
it can only be applied to countries where similar conditions obtain;
?That, since this figure is primarily intended to serve as a basis for the reduction of the
world production of opium and the manufacture of its derivatives, it must be considered
solely from this point of view and not from the point of view of the consumption in each
individual country.
?The Sub-Committee would, moreover, point out:
?That the figure of 450 mg. only very inadequately allows for the quantities of morphine
necessary for the manufacture of codein, as the requirements of this alkaloid vary widely
in different countries and only a few States have supplied accurate information with regard
?That the figure of 450 mg. must be considered as applying only to the normal legitimate
requirements and not to certain exceptional circumstances, such as wars or epidemics, which
may considerably increase the sum total of these requirements.
The Health Committee?s report also contains data regarding the legitimate requirements
in cocaine. ,
ill Vy VyV/UiUiVj? > . 1 ? j
The Committee, after examining the data (also to be found m Document C.H. 204) supplied
by a certain number of States, allowed a round figure of 7 m g- P er head and per year for the
legitimate requirements in cocaine. Sub-Committee F considered that it could agree to the figure
of 7 mg. but qualified its agreement by the reservations formulated above regarding opium and
its derivatives.
The present report, when submitted to Sub-Committee F, was accepted by the majority
of its members. One of them, however, voted against it, giving the following reasons.
?Any attempt at estimating the requirements of the world in narcotics should be finally
given up, because such an estimate must be based on data applicable to certain countries
?Moreover, such a limitation of narcotics would have serious drawbacks for patients
on account of the increase in prices which would result and of the probability that part of
these indispensable drugs would be monopolised for purposes of contraband.
?It would seem that a close supervision by a Central Board of the statistics referred
to in Article 4 of the proposal would provide a sufficient and more reliable basis for effectively
combating the abuse of narcotics. ?
Another member of the Sub-Committee stated that, while admitting the possibility of fixing
legitimate requirements of narcotics, he could not agree to the figures contained m the present
report.

REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE F.
adopted on January 28 th, 1925.
Rapporteur: Prof. Perrot, Delegate of France.
Sub-Committee F received instructions from the plenary meeting of the Second Opium
Conference to examine a number of points mainly bearing upon the definitions contained more
particularly in Chapters I and 111 of the suggestions submitted by the United States of America
and upon the questions raised by the application of the provisions of the Convention to the various
toxic substances under discussion, including both those already known and those which science
might discover possessing similar properties.
The Sub-Committee took as a basis of its investigations the text of the International Hague
Convention, examining in respect of each article submitted to its consideration the modifications
or additions proposed by the various delegations.
First Question.
Legitimate Requirements as regards Opium, Coca-leaves and their Alkaloids.
This question was the subject of a special report by the Chairman of the Sub-Committee, which
has already been distributed to Sub-Committees A, B, C, and D and to which there is no reason to
revert here.
Second Question.
CODEIN.
In order more particularly to facilitate the preparation of statistics of the manufacture and
utilisation of opium for medical and scientific purposes, the delegate of the United States asked
that codein should be included among the substances covered by the laws and regulations of the
Convention. It was agreed, after a discussion, that codein was a derivative of morphine and that
its properties prohibited it from being either medically or scientifically reckoned among narcotics,
but that, as dangerous substances with trade names similar to codein (eucodal, dicodide) were
like codein products obtained from morphine, it was desirable to define what was to be understood
by derivatives and to draft paragraph ( e) of Article 14 in such form that no new product possessing
habit-forming narcotic properties might either now or in the future be excluded from the provisions
of the Convention. . . J ,
In view, however, of the use of large quantities of morphine m the manufacture of codem and
possibly of other non-narcotic derivatives, it is very necessary to be able to control the quantity
of morphine thus used. . ? . . ,
On the proposal of the French delegation, the Committee adopts the following resolution:
?In order to exercise as strict a control as possible over the manufacture of narcotic
alkaloids of opium and the coca-leaf, the Contracting Parties undertake to adopt any measures
enabling them to ascertain the quantity of these alkaloids transformed into non-narcotic
derivatives.
Third Question
Definitions.
Discussion on this point was confined to the technical import of the terms employed. No
alterations were made which weakened the definitions of the International Hague Convention
(Chapter HI), but it was decided to make the addition proposed by the American delegation to
Article 14. Ecgonine, which is, so to speak, a secondary raw material in the manufacture of cocaine,
cannot possibly be confused with any substance under this name, but it seemed to all the delegates
that this substance must necessarily come under the provisions adopted for the manufacture and
traffic in noxious drugs. ....... , , , ? ,
The Committee finally adopted the following definitions, which it had been asked to give by
the plenary meeting:
coca-leaf is understood:
The leaf of erythroxylon coca Lamarck and the erythroxylon novegranatense (Morris) Hiero-
nymus and their varieties of the family of erythroxylaceas and the leaf of other species of this
genus from which it may be found possible to extract cocaine either directly or by chemical
transformation.
Any other vegetable raw material which may serve for the preparation of cocaine will be
put in the same position as coca-leaves.


By cocaine is understood:
Methyl-benzoyl laevo-ecgonine (Alpha D.20 = i6�4 in 20 per cent solution of chloroform)
of which the formula is C l 7 H 2 i NO*.
The Sub-Committee observes that the scientific definition accompanied by the formula and
the rotatory power quite certainly applies equally to synthetic cocaine.
Fourth Question.
Article 14.
As regards the examination of this extremely important article, in respect of which Sub-
Committee F had been furnished with numerous documents, the Sub-Committee decided to entrust
the preparatory work to a small Committee of specially appointed experts, specifying, of course,
that all the delegates of Sub-Committee F might be present at its deliberations.
The Rapporteur of this expert Committee was requested to submit to Sub-Committee F as
soon as he could, as clear a statement as possible of the view of the different delegates showing the
solutions favoured more or less unanimously by the members entrusted with this mission.
Before starting the actual discussion of Article 14, Sub-Committee F, reverting to the word
?derivatives ?? which the American delegation had added to most of the articles {e.g.. Articles 9,10,
11, 12, 13 and paragraph 1 of Article 14) decided to reject the insertion of this word in the articles
of the Convention, since, if the expression was not limited exclusively to the dangerous derivatives
aimed at by the Convention which are already known or may be discovered, this expression would
constitute in the case of some of those derivatives a serious technical error. By allowing this word
to stand, we should end by including within the scope of those provisions of the Convention pro-
ducts which have a totally different medicinal effect or which are in any case not dangerous in the
sense of those drugs we are considering.
For the same reason, the Sub-Committee also asks those responsible for drafting the American
plan to add the word ? certain ?? in the third line of paragraph 1, supposing the preamble became an
official document of the Convention, and to say ? that the use of opium and certain opium products.?
In the first paragraph of Article 14 the Sub-Committee accepts the addition proposed in the
American draft of the words ? distribution, delivery ?.
This paragraph will therefore run as follows:
?The Contracting Parties shall apply the laws and regulations respecting manufacture,
import, sale, distribution, delivery, or export to morphine, cocaine, and their respective salts. ?
The Sub-Committee draws the Drafting Committee?s attention to this paragraph and asks
whether the word ? ? re-exportation? could not be introduced in order that every kind of transaction,
including return to the country of origin, in case of non-acceptance for example, may be provided
for.
Sub-paragraph {a), referring to medicinal opium, is unchanged, but the Committee inserts in ( b )
the definition of crude cocaine and ecgonine as follows:
? ... to crude cocaine, to laevo-ecgonine (Alpha) D.2o�=4s� 6in 5 per cent solution of
water of which the formula is C 9 H l5 0 3 NH 2 o considered as raw material, and to all the
derivatives of laevo-ecgonine which might serve industrially for its recovery. ?
The Sub-Committee then proceeded to consider the other paragraphs of Article 14.
The old paragraph ( b ), which now becomes (c) and which deals with official preparations, gave
rise to a lively discussion and numerous proposals. Some countries, particularly France, observed
that, while they associated themselves unreservedly with the establishment of severe measures with
a view to overcoming the drug habit and its mischievous and terrible effects, it was at the same
time necessary not to hamper the perfectly honest and legitimate practice of pharmacy, both for
domestic purposes within the country and in relation to export.
From the very beginning of the discussion many delegates suggested that a special paragraph
relating to possible exemptions should be added at the end of this article, and this point of view
finally prevailed.
With this reservation, the adoption of the text of the Hague Convention was decided on
without modification.
The text is as follows:
?(g) . . . to all preparations (officinal and non-officinal, including the so-called
anti-opium remedies) containing more than 0.2 per cent of morphine, or more than 0.1 per cent
of cocaine. ?
The Sub-Committee considered that, the Hague Convention having served since 1912 to
establish the present practice, which is already consecrated by use, no new fact could justify the
alteration of this wording.
Paragraph {d), which was formerly (c), refers to heroin, and the Sub-Committee decided
unanimously, with the abstention of the United States of America, that it was not competent to
suppress this alkaloid. Only on the recommendation of a medical enquiry throughout the whole
world could its entire suppression be decided upon. Nevertheless, impressed by the terrible ravages
of the heroin habit, especially in the United States of America, the Sub-Committee, in contrast
to the stipulations of the previous article as regards morphine and cocaine, adopted the suppression
of the percentage, which means, in practice, that it is impossible to sell to the public any preparation
containing even the smallest quantity of heroin without a medical prescription.


For this reason some of the delegates found it necessary to observe that they were not em-
powered to accept this modification and that, although they associated themselves personally with
the high motives which inspired the change, they made a reservation regarding their Government?s
acceptance of this suppression of the tolerance extended to other narcotic alkaloids.
At the same time, many of the delegates considered that it would be well to proceed, first,
to the reduction, and then, no doubt, to the removal of heroin from therapeutics throughout
the world.
With regard to the wording of the paragraph, the German delegate justly observed that the
word ?heroin ?? could not stand by itself in the text of the Convention, since it was the property
of the commercial firm and had not come into public use; it was therefore desirable to refer to
this product by its chemical name of diacetylmorphins, putting in brackets the names (diamor-
phine, heroin) by which it is still known in commerce.
The following is the text of paragraph (:), now paragraph (d) :
?Diacetylmorphine (diamorphine, heroin), its salts and preparations. ?
Sub-Committee F drew the attention of the Drafting Committee to the need of substituting
the word ? d acetylmorphine ?? for the word ?heroin ? in all the articles in which the term is
used.
Article (s), formerly ( d ), the final aim of which is to bring within the Convention all derivatives
other than those already mentioned and, indeed, all products which might, in the future, be
classed among narcotics of the nature of morphine, cocaine and their salts, was only discussed
in order to establish in what way the noxious effects of this possible new derivative would be
officially ascertained, and, finally, Sub-Committee F adopted a method, which it submits for the
approval of the plenary Conference:
?.. .to any new derivative of morphine or cocaine, to an}' other alkalo'd of opium or the
coca-leaf, and to any other narcotic drug which may be declared in the manner following
to be liable to similar abuse and productive of like ill-effects.
?The existence of these ill-effects and abuses shall be declared by the International
Health Office, after consultation with the Health Committee of the League of Nations. In
the event of such a declaration, the Health Committee of the League of Nations shall com-
municate it to the Council of the League, which shall inform the Governments and recommend
their acceptance of it.
?Any Contracting Party accepting the decision shall notify its acceptance to the Secretary-
General of the League of Nations and, as soon as ten Powers have done so, the product in
question shall be regarded as included in the Convention so far as such Contracting Parties
are concerned. ?
The Sub-Committee then proceeded to examine the various draft texts of exemption proposed
by different members.
Objections were raised in particular by the delegate for Spain, who wished to introduce
by name the exempted preparations and even, if possible, to have lists drawn up showing the pro-
ducts which would or would not be affected by the Convention.
Various notes were, furthermore, referred to the Sub-Committee, but it would take too long
to enumerate them in this report.
Summarising, the Committee thought that the text of the Convention should not be over-
burdened and that, as usage differed in the various countries, it would be extremely difficult
to establish limitative lists.
Lastly, the initial proposal of the Belgian delegate allowed for the exemption of preparations
from which, by reason of their medicinal and complex composition, the narcotic alkaloids in ques-
tion could not be industrially recovered and which could not lead to the formation of dangerous
habits.
The following is the text of this proposal:
?When the Office International d?Hygiene Publique, after consultation with the Health
Committee of the League of Nations, shall have declared that certain preparations containing
narcotic alkaloids referred to in this Convention cannot give rise to the drug habit on account
of the medicaments with which these narcotics are compounded and which preclude the
lecovery of the narcotics;
? The Health Committee of the League of Nations shall transmit this decision to the Coun-
cil of the League, which will communicate to all the High Contracting Parties the names
of these preparations in order that they may be regarded by the latter as exempted from
the provisions of the present Convention. ?
Finally, the delegates for France and Belgium, supporting a wash expressed in the note from
the International Pharmaceutical Federation, proposed to exempt from a compulsory medical
prescription certain medicines for urgent use (Dover powder, Sydenham laudanum, tincture
of opium), iirespective of their strength, provided that the quantity supplied on a single occasion
does not exceed 25 centigrammes of officinal opium.
Both delegates, who claim more than twenty years? experience as inspectors of pharmacies,
urged the adoption of their proposal, which, moreover, does not represent any real danger to
public health. On the contrary, it is a question of enabling a sick person cruelly attacked bv a
painful affection to obtain immediate relief before the arrival of a doctor.
In spite of the opposition of some of the members, particularly the delegate for the Dominican
Republic, the Sub-Committee adopted the following text by 7 votes to 4, with 3 abstentions:


?The following opiate officinal preparations may be delivered to the public, on the
responsibility of the chemist, and as medicines for urgent use, but only in maximum doses
corresponding to 25 centigrammes of officinal opium and subject to the book-keeping regula-
tions with regard to narcotics; tincture of opium, Sydenham laudanum and Dover powder. ??
Lastly, in consequence of remarks made by its members during the reading of the various
articles of the Convention, the Sub-Committee wishes to draw the attention of the Drafting
Committee of the future Convention to the advisibility of defining and employing identical terms,
particularly in the repetition of the words ?sale, distribution, cession, delivery ?? employed in
various articles such as Articles 9, 10, io(�), 11, and 14.
The Sub-Committee will next proceed to consider the question of Indian hemp and of its
derivatives and will submit a special report on this subject.
Appendix.
NOTE BY THE BELGIAN DELEGATION.
Befor Committee F is finally dissolved I should like to make a statement. The whole
Conference and our Sub-Committee of Experts in particular have been restricted in their work
by the question of competence. Delegations must, however, in view of future deliberations, be
allowed to express an opinion on those points of view which they would have liked to see accepted
and which they refrained from defending merely because they wished to avoid unnecessary dis-
cussion.
I. In the draft which it submitted to the Conference the Belgian delegation formulated
the provisions of Article 14 regarding the supply of officinal preparations:
?The provisions of Article 14 shall apply to: all preparations containing more than
0.05 gjs morphine or more than 0.025 g rs cocaine. ?
In making this proposal, the Belgian delegation as it has already stated desired to assist
pharmacists in their work and to prohibit he dispensing, without a medical prescription, of cer-
tain quantities of narcotics the quantities varying according to the volume or weight of the
preparation.
The Belgian delegation did not feel able to insist on its proposal in view of the opposition
of its colleagues;
?The provisions of 1912 have not given rise to abuse, and, furthermore, it is difficult
to depart from figures which have become the basis of certain important commercial usages. ?
Nevertheless, we still consider it desirable that Article 14 should fix a limit for narcotics in
terms of absolute weight.
11. The Fixing of the Opium Figures. During the discussion of this first item on our agenda,
our Sub-Committee pointed out how difficult it was to determine this figure owing to the insuffi-
ciency of the data available concerning the consumption of codein.
At our last meeting we adopted the following recommendation on the proposal of the hrench
delegation :
?In order to exercise as strict a control as possible over the manufacture of the narcotic
alkaloids of opium and the coca-leaf, the Contracting Parties undertake to adopt all possible
measures enabling them to ascertain the quantity of these alkaloids transformed into non-
narcotic derivatives. ?
The Belgian delegation sought in vain to obtain the addition at the end of the paragraph
of the words ?and their international distribution
This referred to the case of narcotics transformed into products not included in the Convention.
The Belgian delegation considers that information covering the international distribution
of these products would, without unduly burdening either manufacturers or the agents of inter-
nal control, be of undoubted value, both to national statistics and to the international control
of the drug traffic. *
111. One last point obviously involves the question of competence. It is none the less of in-
terest. It refers to the supply of hypodermic syringes.
It is hardly necessary to enter into details: without syringes there can be no injections and
no addicts to morphine or heroin.
As M. Daladier very rightly remarked in his speech on January 21st, ? The hypodermic
syringe is a much greater danger than the opium smoker?s pipe
It would be expedient to consider whether the supply of hypodermic syringes should not,
like the injected medicament, be made conditional upon a medical prescription.

MINORITY REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE F.
Presented by Surgeon-General Rupert Blue, M.D., D.P.H., Member of the United States Delegation.
While the delegation of the United States is not in accord with all the recommendations
set forth in the draft report of Sub-Committee F submitted by the Rapporteur (Professor Perrot),
I desire, on behalf of the delegation, to express my deep appreciation of the uniform courtesy and
attentive consideration with which this Sub-Committee has received the suggestions of the United
States, and to present for consideration, under reservations made from time to time and duly
noted in the minutes, a statement in the nature of a minority report regarding the points at issue.
I would suggest that the following statement accompany the Rapporteur?s report when this Sub-
Committee accounts to the Conference for the work it was assigned in order that the Conference
may readily understand the several points at issue and may take such action in the premises as
may be deemed advisable.
Statement.
Codeine.
i. It is recommended that the word ?codeine ?be inserted after the word morphine
in Articles 9, 10 (paragraphs (a) and ( b ), n, 12, 13 and 14.
One of the most important objects of the Convention is to ensure that accurate data regarding
the manufacture and consumption of opium and its derivatives shall be collected and recorded.
Otherwise a correct accounting of the final disposition of opium and its products cannot be ascer-
tained. It is therefore urged that the suggestion indicated above be adopted. In any event, it
would seem highly desirable that codeine should be included in the Convention for statistical pur-
poses if for no other reason. In support of this view attention is invited to the following statement
made by the Health Section of the League of Nations;
?The Mixed Sub-Committee points out again that,- in view of the large quantities of
codeine prescribed in certain countries, it would be well to include this alkaloid in the enquiries
and, in general, all the derivatives of opium employed in therapeutics. (See Document A.32.
1924. 11, Annex 5, page 22). ??
Derivatives.
2. It is recommended that the word ?derivatives ?be re-inserted in Articles 9, 10,11,12,
13, and 14 of the Suggestions of the United States.
The deletion of the wamd ?derivatives ? from the articles referred to, as recommended in the
report of the Rapporteur, renders impossible an accurate accounting to be made with regard to the
course and disposition of consignments of opium. If derivatives of the raw material are not
accounted foi, the effectiveness of any convention which may be concluded would be seriously
impaired. It may be mentioned that statistics collected by the Advisory Committee on the Traffic
in Opium indicate that only six States have so far tabulated returns respecting codeine, and these
figures are for the most part not reliable.
Heroin.
3. It is recommended that an article providing for the suppression of the manufacture
of heroin be included in the Convention. (See Article 9-A of the Suggestions of the United
States.)
The United States delegation has noted with interest the recommendations submitted by the
Sub-Committee regarding the limitation of the use of heroin and would respectfully urge the Con-
ference to take advantage of the present opportunity to place a ban upon this noxious drug in the
manner indicated in Document 0.D.C./C.R./13 k In further support of the proposal to suppress
the manufacture of heroin, reference may be made to the report of the Health Section of the League
of Nations:
? Diacetyl morphine (heroin) is a very dangerous drug, still more toxic than morphine and
still more dangerous as regards the forming of the drug habit. Since the pharmacologists
and clinical practitioners admit that heroin can be dispensed with in therapeutics, the Mixed
Sub-Committee recommends the possibility of entirely forbidding its manufacture should be
considered. ? (See Document 32 (1924) 11, page 22,)
The foregoing statement not only constitutes a strong endorsement of the views entertained
by the delegation of the United States regarding the suppression of the manufacture of heroin but
would also seem to afford the answer to the statement that sufficient evidence has not been obtained
to warrant the suppression of the manufacture of the drug at the present time.
1 See Verbatim Record of the Thirteenth Plenary Meeting of the Conference.


Morphine and Cocaine.
4. It is recommended that the following text be substituted in Article 14, paragraph (6),
for that contained in the Rapporteur?s report:
?(c) . . . to all preparations (officinal and non-officinal, including the so-called
anti-opium remedies) containing more than one-quarter of a grain of morphine or more
than one-quarter of a grain of cocaine to the ounce. ?
If the text of the Hague Convention regarding the exemption of preparations containing 0.2 per
cent of morphine and 0.1 per cent of cocaine is adopted as recommended by the report of the Rap-
porteur, a druggist may dispense these strong solutions of narcotics without a medical prescription.
Had the percentages been reduced to one-quarter of the amounts indicated in the Hague Con-
vention it would have served the purpose intended without the danger of creating addition among
uniformed purchasers. The attention of the Conference is invited to the following opinion of the
Health Section of the League of Nations regarding the danger to be apprehended from the dispersing
of strong solutions containing morphine and cocaine:
?In the report (see Document C.H.264) submitted to the Mixed Committee and to the
Health Committee we pointed out that this provision was, to a certain extent, likely to promote
illicit traffic, owing to the fact that a proportion of narcotics which might be proved to be
considerable was thus withdrawn from supervision. ??
In support of the high percentage of these drugs exempted, it was urged that persons who
became ill suddenly should be permitted to obtain relief without calling a physician and that
everyone should be accorded the right to purchase narcotics from chemists at any time. In our
opinion, this would be a most decided step backward, as it might create addiction among certain
classes as well as permit illicit traffic in cocaine and morphine. The amount exempted in the
amendment proposed above would appear to be ample for the immediate relief of any person who
might need an opiate while away from home.
Medicinal Opium to he dispensed without a Prescription.
5. It is recommended that the following text be substituted for that proposed by the
delegates for France and Belgium with regard to the exemption from medical prescription of
certain medicines irrespective of their strength, provided the quantity supplied on a single
occasion does not exceed 5� centigrams of officinal opium:
?The following opiated officinal preparations may be delivered to the public on the
responsibility of the chemist without a medical prescription and as medicines for urgent
use, but only in small quantities corresponding to 12 centigrams of officinal opium,
subject to the bookkeeping regulations with regard to narcotics, tincture of opium, Dover
powder, and Sydenham laudanum. ??
It is believed that the quantities of medicinal opium permitted to be dispensed without a
medical prescription under the Sub-Committee?s proposed amendment is excessive and is not
warranted by conditions obtaining in any country. If 50 centigrams of officinal opium may be
delivered without a medical prescription, as recommended by the Committee, the question natu-
rally arises: ?Why place any restriction upon the distribution of opium products ??? As it would
be possible for a person to obtain 8 grains of opium at a single purchase, the same individual, by
proceeding from one chemist?s shop to another, might obtain enough opium in a single day to
satisfy the demands of a dozen addicts. No doubt the restriction which the delegation suggests
might inconvenience the customer, but physicians will generally agree that 12 centigrams of
tincture of opium contain sufficient opium to relieve any acute case of illness. Opium is, of
course, palliative, not curative, in its action, and it does positive harm in many cases of disease, aside
from its tendency to create addiction.
Medicinal and Scientific Needs of the World.
6. It is recommended that the Conference do not embody in the Convention any provision
fixing the amount of opium and cocaine necessary to supply the medicinal and scientific needs
of the world.
While the necessity for the establishment of a basis for estimating the requirements of each
country is fully appreciated, the advisability of a Convention fixing the requirements is question-
able for the reason that a recommendation of this Conference would serve the purpose equally as
well and avoid the delays consequent upon a revision in the future of such a provision in the Con-
vention.


Annex 28.
0.D.C./72 (1)
REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE F CONCERNING INDIAN HEMP
Rapporteur: Prof. Perrot, Delegate of France.
Sub-Committee F, to which the full Conference had submitted the question of Indian hemp
and various preparations derived from it, known under the names of hashich, chira, charas, etc.,
has considered the reports of the delegates for Egypt and Turkey.
Ihe abuse of these preparations (which are chewed or eaten) and the smoking of the drug
aie specially dangerous, since their immoderate use due to addiction leads to troubles at least
as serious as those caused in similar conditions by the use of opium and its derivatives.
Moreover, certain preparations now frequently contain opium and highly toxic substances,
such as mix vomica, datura, cantharides, etc., which greatly adds to the dangers of such prepara-
tions.
A number of Governments have already brought Indian hemp and preparations of Indian
hemp under the regulations for dangerous drugs, and have in this way restricted traffic in these
substances exclusively to medical and scientific requirements. The quantity required for these
latter purposes would appear to represent only a very small part of the total output. The actual
proportion can only be accurately determined by statistics.
Sub-Committee F is of the opinion that the campaign against these narcotic products must
be organised on international lines.
It should, however, be remembered that all derivatives of hemp are capable of providing,
in addition to products injurious to public health, fibres which can be used in industry (cloth,
cordage, matting, etc.) and that the oil seeds may also be employed for domestic purposes.
That being the case, it would not appear to be an easy matter to limit the amount grown.
An effort should, however, be made to adopt drastic measures with a view to prohibiting the grow-
ing of specially poisonous species and completely abolishing the traffic in the resin.
While effective practical measures could apparently be taken fairly easily in highly developed
countries this is not the case as regards Central Africa and Central Asia.
Ihe growing of Indian hemp is prohibited by the Ottoman Government and the Governments
of Egypt. Greece and a few other countries, while the protecting Powers have issued severe mea-
sures in Africa to achieve the same result measures the enforcement of which will serve as a
test of their administrative capacity and their influence on the natives of the centre and south
of the continent.
The Sub-Committee appointed a Committee of Experts to examine the question and to sub-
mit proposals. The latter thought that it was necessary to distinguish three points of view:
(1) the establishment of a definition of Indian hemp; (2) the establishment of a distinction
between the raw material and the resin extracted by various processes, the latter constituting
the most dangerous drug; (3) the question of restricting its use to medical and scientific needs.
After discussion, and after consideration of the observations of the delegates of Great Britain
and India, the following definition, which is in conformity with the terms used in the British
Pharmacopoeia, was adopted, together with an addition concerning various appelations in use
in the different countries.
[a) By Indian hemp is understood the dried flowering or fruiting tops of the distillate
plant cannabis saliva L., from which the resin has not been extracted, under whatever name
they may he designated in commerce. ?
The question of the raw resin (charas) gave rise to a long discussion, and the Sub-Committee,
on being consulted, decided in principle that it would be well to recommend that all traffic in it
should be prohibited as well as traffic in all preparations of which it forms the basis. The Sub-
committee considered that it was impossible to designate them all by reason of the numerous
and varied names by which they are known in the different countries and decided merely to
designate them as a whole, mentioning some of the best known among them: hashish (Arabian
and Egyptian), esrar (Turkish), chira (Tunisian), and diamba (Brazilian).
Ihe Rapporteur observed that as this raw resin and the preparations derived therefrom
were not susceptible of any medical usage, there was no reason why the proposal should not be
adopted. The Sub-Committee, however, desired to reserve the question of possible medical uti-
lisation and in the end adopted the following text:
(h) The use of Indian hemp and the preparations derived therefrom may only be
authorised for medical and scientific purposes. The raw resin (charas), however, which
is extracted from the female tops of the cannabis saliva L., together with the various prepara-
tions (hashish, chira, esrar, diamba, etc.) of which it forms the basis, not being at present
utilised for medical purposes and only being susceptible of utilisation for harmful purposes,
in the same manner as other narcotics, may not be produced, sold, traded in, etc., under
any circumstances whatsoever.


Appendix.
INDIAN HEMP.
Note by the Indian Delegation.
January 23rd, 1925.
The Government of India are in full sympathy with the proposal to bring the international
traffic in the drug Indian hemp under international control. Even before the matter was mooted
in the recent questionnaire on the subject circulated by the Advisory Committee, the Government
of India had already taken various stops with a view to examining and strengthening, where
necessary, the strict control of this traffic which already exists in India. They had asked the
maritime Provincial Governments, within whose competence the matter partly lies, to ensure
a very close scrutiny of all applications for export permits, and had subsequently, in March 1924,
addressed all the Provincial Governments in the matter of bringing the drugs in question under
international control.
When the proposal of the Egyptian delegation had been added by the Conference to its agenda
and had been considered by Sub-Committee F, the Indian delegation, after the adjournment,
telegraphed to the Government of India to ascertain to what extent they are likely to find it possible
in practice to accept the methods of control suggested by that Sub-Committee.
The reply of the Government of India has now been received. They state that they would
be able to co-operate by controlling export on the import certificate system; in this way, export
would be confined to cases covered by import certificates issued by the Governments of the
importing countries.
The Government of India have not yet had time to consult Provincial Government and the
Governments of the Indian States on the further question of controlling, in the manner suggested
by Sub-Committee F, the production and sale and use of these drugs within the borders of India
itself. The control already exercised by the Provincial Governments over the production, trans-
port and sale of these drugs is of a very stringent nature. Charas is not prepared in India but i.
imported from Central Asia; import is controlled by licence. The production of ganja is prohibited
except in small areas, the product of which is controlled by the excise authorities. The Go vern-
ment of India, however, at the present stage of their examination of the subject, point out va iojs
serious difficulties of an administrative order in confining the use of hemp drugs to medical and
scientific purposes; for example, there are social and religious customs which naturally hand
to be considered, and there is the doubt whether the total prohibition of drugs easily preparve
from a wild-growing plant could in practice be made effective.
For these rea ons, the Indian delegation is glad to be able to promise the co-operation of its
Government in limiting the export of Indian hemp to the needs of the importing countries as
certified by their Governments by means of the import certificate system, but would be unable,
in existing circumstances, to accept a proposal that the articles of the Convention should include
the full extent of the suggestions put forward by Sub-Committee F in so far as they affect the
methods of internal restriction applied by the various Governments in India.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT OF SUB-COMMITTEE F.
1. In pursuance of the wish expressed by the President of the Second Conference, Sub-Com-
mittee F examined the Egyptian delegation?s proposal. (See Verbatim Recordof the Eighth
Plenary Meeting.)
The Egyptian delegate recognised that the first two paragraphs of Resolution {e) 1 gave him
full satisfaction. He stated that he could not accept the third paragraph, which he asked to have
deleted, as he could not approve of the provision that once a decision on the part of the technical
bodies appointed for the purpose had been obtained, the formal approval of ten powers should
be required before it became effective.
Notwithstanding the assent of a certain number of delegates, it was decided that, as the
report had been finally adopted, it could not be changed and that the Egyptian delegate should
raise the question in the Plenary Conference.
2. The Rapporteur of Sub-Committee F, speaking on behalf of several of the members of
the Sub-Committee, then pointed out that the wording of the Hague Convention (Chapter III)
concerning the definition of medicinal opium contained a technical error.
The words ?which has been heated ? should be deleted as incorrect, as the process actually
employed is a preliminary dessication for the purpose of placing exports in the same analytical
conditions. The article should therefore be worded as follows:
?By medicinal opium is understood: raw opium which, after dessication at -f-6o� C.
contains not less than 10 per cent of morphine, etc.?
The Committee adopted this wording.
3. In order to make the definition of raw opium in Chapter I clearer, the Committee also
adopted the addition of the words: Whatever its content of morphine ? at the end of the paragraph.
4. At the request of the Drafting Committee, a discussion was opened with a view to defining
what should be understood by the term ?crude cocaine ?.
1 See the Report of Sub-Committee F (Annex 26).


The following text was unanimously adopted:
?By crude cocaine is understood all products extracted from the coca-leaf which can
directly or indirectly serve for the preparation of cocaine.?

REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE OF SIXTEEN.
The Committee of Sixteen held four meetings. It appointed a Sub-Committee of Five, which
made the following report, to which the Committee of Sixteen has nothing to add.
The Sub-Committee of Five held a meeting on Wednesday, February 4th, 1925, under the
Chairmanship of M. Zahle. The following Government representatives were present:
British Empire
France
Finland
Japan
United States of America
Sir Malcolm Delevingne.
Lord Cecil.
M. Daladier.
M. Toivola.
M. SIJGIMURA.
The Hon. Stephen Porter.
The Sub-Committee met to consider the proposals of the United States of America concern-
ing the gradual suppression of prepared opium in territories where its use is temporarily permitted
under the terms of the Hague Convention of 1912.
In addition to the American proposals, the Sub-Committee had before it a proposal in the
form of two draft protocols submitted by the British delegation, with the principles of which
the French delegation stated that it was in agreement.
It was explained that the first draft protocol was to be signed by producing countries, though
there was nothing to prevent other Powers from signing it if they so desired; while the second-
draft protocol was in the nature of an addition to the draft agreement prepared by the First
Conference.
The Sub-Committee proceeded to discuss the British proposals article by article, on the
understanding that the question of principle involved was in no way prejudiced by such discus-
sion. It reached the conclusion that nothing in the draft protocols submitted by the British
delegation should be construed into diminishing the force of the provisions of the Hague Con-
vention but that they might be regarded as agreements for the final execution of certain of its
provisions. . .
The question which was of chief concern to the Sub-Committee was the question of principle.
The Sub-Committee found itself faced with two proposals which differed essentially. The first
was to the effect that States with territories in which the use of prepared opium was temporarily
permitted should undertake effectively to prohibit that use within a period of 15 years which
should begin to run from a given date to be determined as the Conference thought fit. The other
proposal was to the effect that that period of 15 years should begin to run only from the date
on which the effective execution of the measures taken by the producing countries to limit and
control the production and distribution of raw opium had reached such a stage that opium smug-
gling no longer constituted a serious obstacle to the carrying out in the consuming States of any
measures necessary to bring about the abolition of the use of prepared opium.
In connection with this proposal there were submitted to the Sub-Committee various pro-
posals in regard to the manner in which the date for the beginning of the period of 15 years should
be fixed. It was suggested that the producing States should be allowed five years in which to
control the production of opium and that the period of 15 years should begin immediately at the
end of that time if, at the end of these five years, an impartial committee should decide that such
a control had been successfully achieved. None of the suggestions brought forward met with
unanimous approval.
The Sub-Committee consequently, after considerable discussion, reluctantly decided that
it was unable to find a compromise between the two opposing points of view, and, accordingly,
it is compelled to report that on the question of principle it has been unable to arrive at a unani-
mous conclusion.
This negative result at which the Sub-Committee has arrived does not necessarily mean a break-
down in the efforts to carry out in a comparatively short time the total suppression of the use of prepa-
red opium. On the contrary, the majority of the Sub-Committee is confident that the Governments
concerned will not remain inactive. They could and the Sub-Committee hopes that they
will find it possible to embody in a protocol a provision for a period of fifteen years in the course
of which the obligation to abolish the use of prepared opium, assumed by the signatories of the
Hague Convention, should be carried out. They will, the Sub-Committee hopes, find a satis-
factory method of deciding when this period of fifteen years will begin to run. If the duty of
taking this important decision be left to the League of Nations, of which the impartiality and
authority cannot be doubted by anyone, the labours of the Conferences have not been in vain.
Even if members of the Conferences were to leave Geneva without knowing exactly the date
on which the final struggle against prepared opium will begin, they should, nevertheless, know
that the League of Nations is bound at some date to declare to the general satisfaction of the
world: ?The fifteen years are to begin to run now; there must be no further delay.?

of the Assembly of the League of Nations dated September 27th, 1923, met on November 17th,
1924, at the Palais des Nations, Geneva.
The resolution of the Assembly was in the following terms :
?The Assembly, having noted with satisfaction that, in accordance with the hope
expressed in the fourth resolution adopted by the Assembly in 1922, the Advisory Com-
mittee has reported that the information now available makes it possible for the Govern-
ments concerned to examine, with a view to the conclusion of an agreement, the question
of the limitation of the amounts of morphine, heroin or cocaine and their respective salts
to be manufactured ; of the limitation of the amounts of raw opium and the coca leaf
to be imported for that purpose and for other medicinal and scientific purposes ; and of
the limitation of the production of raw opium and the coca leaf for export to the amount
required for such medicinal and scientific purposes, requests the Council as a means of
giving effect to the principles submitted by the representatives of the United States
of America, and to the policy which the League, on the recommendation of the Advisory
Committee, has adopted to invite the Governments concerned to send representatives
with plenipotentiary powers to a conference for this purpose, to be held, if possible,
immediately after the conference mentioned in Resolution V.
?The Assembly also suggests, for the consideration of the Council, the advisability
of enlarging this conference so as to include all countries which are Members of the

signee ce jour, de produire son plein et entier effet, il est essentiel qu?elle revive une applica-
tion aussi etendue que possible dans les colonies, possessions, protectorats et territoires
dont il est fait mention a Particle 39 de la Convention. En consequence, la Conference exprime
le ferme espoir que les gouvernements interesses prendront, dans le delai le plus rapproche,
les dispositions necessaires a cet effet et que le nombre desdits colonies, possessions, protec-
torats et territoires, soustraits a Paction de la Convention, pourra etre reduit au minimum.
La Conference recommande que chaque gouvernement envisage la possibility d intei-
dire le transport, par des navires portant son pavilion, de tout envoi de Pune des substances
visees par la Convention :
1, A moins qu?une automation d?exportation n?ait ete delivree pour cet envoi,
conformement aux dispositions de la Convention, et que Penvoi ne soit accompagne
d?une copie officielle de cette autorisation ou de tout certificat de deroutement qui pourra
etre delivre ;
2. A toute destination autre que celle indiquee dans Pautorisation d?exportation
ou le certificat de deroutement.

The Conference adopted the Convention relating to Dangerous Drugs which bears
to-day?s date.
The Conference also adopted the Protocol bearing to-day?s date
The Conference also adopted the following resolutions ;
The Conference recognises that, to enable the Convention relating to Dangerous Drugs,
signed this day, to produce its full effect, it is essential that it should be applie das widely as
possible in the colonies, possessions, protectorates and territories mentioned in Article 39
of the Convention. The Conference accordingly expresses the earnest hope that the Governments
concerned will take the necessary steps to that end with as little delay as possible, and that
the number of such colonies, possessions, protectorates or territories excluded from the
operation of the Convention may be reduced to a minimum.
The Conference recommends that each Government should consider the possibility of
forbidding the conveyance in any ship sailing under its flag of any consignment of the substances
covered by the Convention :
(1) Unless an export authorisation has been issued in respect of such consignment
in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, and the consignment is accompanied
by an official copy of such authorisation, or of any diversion certificate which may be
by an (
issued;
(2)
sation '
(2) To any destination other than the destination mentioned in the export authori-
sation or diversion certificate.


La Conference recommande a tons les Etats de cooperer aussi etroitement que possible
en vue de la suppression du trafic illicite et de donner aux autorites competentes, chargees
de I?application des lois sur la repression du trafic, I?autorisation d?entrer en communication
directe avec les autorites competentes des autres pays.
La Conference signale I?intret qu?il y aurait, dans certains cas, a exiger, des negotiants
qui auront requ du gouvernement une licence en vue de faire le commerce des substances visees
par la Convention, de fournir une caution adequate en especes ou garantie de banque
suffisante pour servir de garantie efficace centre toute operation de trafic illicite de leur part.
La Conference prie le Conseil de la Societe des Nations d?examiner la suggestion qui
a ete presentee au cours des debats, notamment par la delegation de Perse, et tendant ala no-
mination d?une Commission qui serait chargee de visiter, s?ils le desirent, certains pays produc-
teurs d?opium, en vue de proceder, en collaboration avec eux, a une etude attentive des diffi-
cultes qu?entraine la limitation de la production de I?opium dans ces pays, et de donner son
avis sur les mesures qui pourraient etre prises pour permettre de la limiter aux quantites
necessaires pour les besoins medicaux et scientifiques.

The Conference recommends that all States should co-operate as closely as possible
with one another in the suppression of the illicit traffic, and that they should authorise t e
competent authorities charged with the administration of the law on the subject to communi-
cate directly with the corresponding authorities in other countries.
The Conference draws attention to the advisability in certain cases of requiring dealers
who are licensed by the Government to trade in the substances covered by the Convention
to deposit or give sureties for a sum of money sufficient to serve as an effective guarantee
against their engaging in the illicit traffic.
The Conference asks the Council of the League of Nations to examine the suggestion
which has been made in the course of its proceedings, in particular by the Persian delegation
that a commission should be appointed to visit certain opium-producing countries, should
those countries so desire, for the purpose of making a careful study (in collaboration with t e
Governments of those countries) of the difficulties connected with the limitation of the pro-
duction of opium in those countries and advising as to the measures which could be taken
to make it possible to limit the production of opium in those countries to the quantities
required for medical and scientific purposes.
The Conference asks the Council of the League of Nations to invite the Health Committee
to consider immediately whether it would be expedient to consuit the International Health
Office regarding the products mentioned in Articles 8 and 10, in order that, if so, a decis
concerning preparations which cannot give rise to the drug habit and a recommendatio
concerning all other drugs which might come under the provisions of the Convention may be
notified immediately upon the entry into force of the said Convention.
VII.
The Conference requests the Council of the League of Nations to decide to include in the
expenses of the Secretariat the expenses of the Central Board and its administrative services.
P It is understood that those Contracting Parties which are not Members of the League
will bear their share of the expenses in accordance with a scale to be drawn up by agreement
