Powerful Evidence proving the Claimant to be Sir Roger Tichborne and NOT ARTHUR ORTON.
Sir Roger Tichborne embarked from Sydney in September, 1866, on board “ Rakaid,” bound for Panama. The “ Rakaid” called
at Wellington, New Zealand, and the Claimant went on shore and enquired for Mr. Frederick Weld, Prime Minister of that Colony, whom
he had known in former years in England; but, finding that he lived at a considerable distance, and that the duration of the ship’s stay
would not allow him to go so far, the Claimant wrote him a letter, mentioning his disappointment in being unable t© see him, and that he
was on his way to England. Mr. Weld wrote a letter to him and addressed it to Tichborne Park, and it was received by the Claimant
soon after his arrival in England. It is as follows:
Brachenfield, Canterbury, New Zealand,
, r _ m . ~ October 17th, 1866.
My Dear Tichborne—
Many thanks for your note. I have’often thought of you since we last met, and wondered if yon were alive. I hope you will
keep up the credit of the Dole. I shall most probably return to England in a year or so, when perhaps we may meet at Tichborne. In
the meantime
Believe me, yours very truly,
c . _ _• t m . ~ (signed) FREDK. A. WELD.
Sir R. Tichborne, Bart., Tichborne.
P.S.—I am very glad yon took Bogle home, remember me to him
Would Arthur Orton have called to see the Prime Minister of New Zealand on
his way to England ? Englishmen, think for yourselves,
