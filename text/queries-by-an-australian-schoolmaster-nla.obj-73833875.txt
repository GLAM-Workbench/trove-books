AN AUSTRALIAN SCHOOLMASTER
The figure of the Triangle has been especially observed by ancient
heathen philosophers, and identified with the numeral one , ? the
equilateral triangle (says Pythagoras) is the elementary source of all
created things.?
? Three (said Plato) is the signature of Deity, who is the beginning,
the centre, and the end of all things.?

THE STORY OF THE SCHOOLMASTER.
AN INTRODUCTION BY A FRIEND.
The writer of the ensuing letter is, as he says, a self-taught
man. He thinks he has found a new and short alphabet to
the Nineveh inscriptions. Some of his readers may have been
deterred from even thinking of the study of a vast Assyrian
alphabet like Sir H. Rawlinson?s, ? with 300 letters and 500
possible variants,? an alphabet which has, indeed, been agreed
upon hitherto by 'most of the learned men of Europe, but which
has had its rise only from a comparison of the supposedly
ascertained names of kings and countries as observed on tablets,
known to be bi-lingual or tri-lingual, modern research being
helped in its guesses by the Bible history and by Herodotus.
Our student, however, begins from the other end of things;
many would call him an enthusiast \ and peihaps without
knowing it he has only followed out principles long ago laid
down by other thinkers, who saw them, but did not keep to
them. ? The alphabets of all very ancient languages are
probably short and very simple in their forms,? has been said
before to-day, though the learned bring Chinese, Japanese,
and Rawlinson?s Assyrian as proofs to the contrary; but to
begin with our story.
Up to the arrival of the Nineveh marbles in London Mr. D.
Smith was a weaver of gold lace, but in common with many
artisans he had a taste for the antique, and for two years he
spent much of his spare time in the cellars of the British
Museum, where these Eastern marvels w r ere at first deposited,
and where they attracted his profound interest, as tending to
illustrate or corroborate Holy Scripture. He formed, as he
says, a ? humble unit amongst the thousands who flocked to

the British Museum to gaze on the records written in this
dumb Semitic tongue.?
It was in the year 1848 that he first perceived a likeness
between the arrow-headed or triangular letters of these in-
scriptions (as he assumed them to be) and the letters of ancient
Greek, and by comparing the alphabets he thought he could
dissect all the various groups of wedges into 19 different
letters, to which he has attached the Hebrew names
ffinuifbe.

Museum, can, by this description, find these signs; and, having
drawn them in outline , not in solid form, can compare them in
the next room with the letters on old Greek tombs, and be
astonished at their similarity.
As soon as he had formed this alphabet, having some know-
ledge of Greek, he copied an inscription and tried to bid it
speak in that language, but he could only make out a few
names, such as ? Assaraoi,? ? Babiloi,? and ? Bel.? Thinking
next that the reading might be in Hebrew, he applied himself
to gain a knowledge of that tongue, but scarcely had he
mastered the Hebrew alphabet when adverse circumstances
compelled him to forego such studies for the sterner task of
seeking his daily bread 16,000 miles from his native land.
He landed in Melbourne in January, 1851, and the confusion
of colonial life in those early gold days put a stop to all such
pursuits, and till 1859 his papers remained on the shelf; a
little leisure then directed his attention to the subject afresh,
and since that time he has been endeavouring, ?under diffi-
culties,? to make known his views.
He sent copies of his alphabet to various learned Societies
and gentlemen in London, Dublin, and Paris, but he received
only one answer, and that from Mr. Layard, who tells him
that his only plan is to publish his discovery.
In Melbourne, therefore, he published, in 1864, a small book
by subscription, of which but two or three copies remain, and
four pages of accredited and most respectable names of sub-
scribers attest how far an interest was felt in his speculations
in Australia. He delivered lectures on the subject in Mel-
bourne, which seem to have been appreciated by persons of
influence, and these were well spoken of in many local news-
papers.
His idea, was considered ingenious, and his alphabet com-
paratively easy to be understood, but the results of its employ-
ment remained to be proved. Yet so certain was he of
developing the importance of his views by further study,
that after sixteen years of absence from his native land, he
has in 1867 returned to prosecute his favourite researches at
all costs.


But ?at all costs? in his case means a great deal ?it means
at present almost starvation.
He desires, of course, to republish his book, which is illus-
trated by alphabets which all might understand; but his
one friend in London, Mr. George Yonge, of the Jews? Society,
who had known him from his youth, was seized with his last
illness soon after he reached our shores. Friendless, and
without resources in our wide city, he has even endeavoured
to resume his original handicraft, that he may earn the privilege
of studying at spare hours in our Nineveh galleries.
It is, of course, under immense difficulties that he can make
known his views. In the first place, all European adepts
in the cuneiform characters decline to listen to a new mode
of entrance on their laborious field. Yet they tell him to
publish his discovery, but how shall he publish? He has
no resources ; he must earn his daily bread, which leaves little
time for the studies which he has recrossed the ocean to
prosecute.
N.B.?Let us hope that some friends who read his letter will
help him to the republication of his researches here.


QUERIES BY AN AUSTRALIAN SCHOOLMASTER.
WAS HEBREW THE WORLD?S FIRST LANGUAGE ? AND WHAT
WERE ITS PRIMITIVE CHARACTERS ?
Dean Trench has remarked that ? in books are preserved and
hoarded the treasures of wisdom and knowledge which the
world has accumulated; and it is chiefly by the aid of these,
that they are handed down from one generation to another.?
In the ages preceding the Christian era the expression would
have been, ?in rolls are preserved and hoarded,? &c., &c.
At a still earlier era we find the annals of a nation written
on tablets of baked clay; and then we come to the original
method of record upon rocks, pillars, and slabs of stone, used
from the days of Noah to those of Moses, and indeed for many
ages afterwards. Barnes, in his Commentary, remarks on
the expression in Job xix. 23,
"Oh that my words were now written / Oh that they were printed in
a book! ?
? that the word which we translate ? printed/ properly means
to cut in, to hew, to engrave on a tablet.?
Now we cannot overlook the great importance of the number-
less inscriptions (or sepharim) discovered in this century
amongst the ruined cities of the East. It will be remembered
what great excitement was caused throughout the learned
world in the years 1848-9 by Mr. Layard?s discoveries, and
what rivalry there was among the great Oriental scholars of
Europe in searching for the key or clue to the elucidation
of the inscriptions thus brought to light. Yet some of the
most learned men of the present day assert, with Sir George
Cornewall Lewis, that all that has been done {i.e., in the


way of decipherment) is still unsatisfactory, extremely vague,
and often contradictory.
It is not far from a received opinion that in the early ages
of the world all the Oriental nations, from Mount Ararat to
the banks of the Nile, and from the Persian Gulf to the
Mediterranean Sea, spoke the same language, and may they not
probably have used the same alphabetical characters in writing ?
This opinion seems to some of us borne out by the evidence
of the Scriptures; for we read in the 11th chapter of
Genesis, that ? the whole earth was of one lip , and the same
words,? or ?of one language and of one speech lt is not un-
reasonable to suppose that this language was the same as
that spoken by the great ancestor Noah, the tenth in a direct
line from Adam.
Both Adam and Noah conversed with God himself. Now
Adam lived many years on the earth with Lamech, the father
of Noah, and there cannot be a doubt that Noah spoke the
same primitive language as Adam, and Abram descending
in the line of Seth and Shem, probably spoke the same
language still, as it had been handed down from father to son,
when he travelled out of Ur of the Chaldees to Haran, and
thence into Canaan; and still further into Egypt, where, says
Josephus, he disputed with the priests and learned men of
the country. We are informed by the same author that ?he
taught the Egyptians arithmetic and the science of astronomy:?
from these conditions it appears that there could have been no
difficulty of communication between Abram and the men of
Egypt. The primitive language seems also to have been
understood by Melchizedek, King of Salem, and very probably
by the Kings of Shinar and Ellasar; by Chedorlaomer, King
of Elam, and Tidal, King of nations.
It must, moreover, have been a kindred tongue with that of the
inhabitants of Sodom, for Lot dwelt there, and he must have had
daily intercourse with its people. The King of Sodom himself
had held a conference with Abraham. The kings and their people,
above alluded to, were all descended from the five sons of Shem,
the eldest son of Noah. Profane History informs us that Menes,
pr Mizraim, grandson of Noah, established himself and reigned


in Egypt very early after the flood, and probably before the
building of Babel. He must have originally spoken the
language he had been taught in his childhood by his father
Ham, the son of Noah, and made it the national tongue. If
so, the fact would account for the facility of intercourse between
the early patriarchs and the Egyptians. Jacob communed
freely with Pharaoh ; and it appears from the names of persons
and places, that wherever Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob wandered,
they found the primitive language, or Hebrew, still existing.
Here it may be remarked that the rendering which our English
translators have given of Gen. xlii. 23 is not quite correct.
The passage reads thus :
?And they knew not that Joseph understood them, for he spake unto
them by an interpreter .?
But the word shmang, which our translators have made ? under-
stood,? should have been ? heard? And this is the rendering
of the Septuagint. The ?interpreter? was the melitz, the
officer of the palace whose duty it was to introduce individuals
to the superior or Prime Minister. The passage, therefore,
should read thus: ??And they knew not that Joseph heard
them, for the officer (melitz) stood between them? We may
also point to the fact that, when the Israelites returned to
Caaaan, notwithstanding their intercourse with the Egyptians
for several hundred years, and their sojourning in the wilder-
ness above forty years, they did not, so far as it appears,
require an interpreter to the sons of Amalek; and when they
came to the borders of Canaan, in the long colloquy between
the spies and Bahab, it seems perfectly clear that they under-
stood each other?s language.
It is one of the objects of the writer of this paper to endeavour
to show that the language here referred to was the primitive
language, or Hebrew ; that it was spoken all over the East up to
a very late historical period; and he further thinks there is every
probability that the alphabetical characters used in the very
earliest ages of the world to express this language were those
now brought from Assyria.
The earliest Greek alphabet, consisting of only sixteen letters,
and carried to Europe it is said by Cadmus at about the time of


the Exodus of Israel, was composed of the same triangular or
wedge-like characters, and differed from them merely by being
given in outline, not in solid form. The Roman alphabet chiefly
followed the Greek, so that our Roman and English letters
were originally formed by triangles placed in different positions,
and may be essentially the same as those which were used by
Abraham, by Noah, and by Adam himself. It seems a startling
proposition that the Assyrian alphabet is the primitive form of
original Hebrew, and the source of all alphabets, ancient and
modern, but there is much to be said in support of such a
theory.
We have a striking proof of the relation between Assyrian
and Hebrew, from Scripture. The first intimation we have
of a different language being spoken in the East is when Rab-
shakeh was before Jerusalem. ?Eliakim, and Shebna, and
Joah said unto Rabshakeh,
? Speak, I pray thee, to thy servants in the Syrian language, for we
understand it, and talk not with us in the Jews' language, in the ears of
the people that are on the wall.? ?
Here we can perceive that Hebrew was spoken by the
Assyrians at the time this happened, or b.c. 710, which was
150 years after Jonah?s mission to Nineveh.
How otherwise, it may be added, can we account for the
heathen city understanding the warnings of that Jewish
prophet, Jonah ?
Let the reader especially observe an allusion in the 12th verse
of the 13th chapter of Isaiah to ? the golden wedge of Ophir.?
There are scholars who declare that this ought to be rendered
not wedge but word, or letter of Ophir. ? I will .purify man
more than fine gold, even men more than the letter or word
of Ophir.? *
The passage has reference to something very precious in
Ophir. The original object may have been of pure gold, and
worshipped as ?the word.? Heathendom was not without its
unconscious prophecies, and has most often come into early
contact with patriarchal truth.
* Ophir may have been the brother of Job and son of Joktan, and have
given his name to some part of Arabia.


The early Chaldeans worshipped the Deity under the form of
the vertical wedge and the name of Ani ('as), or Ann (*I2N), ? We
{are) ; ? Eawlinson tells us in his five ancient monarchies that
the figure itself had the phonetic power of its name, A.nu,
consequently it was the Word. ?In the beginning was the
Word,? &c., and that this figure (the element of the primitive
alphabet) was worshipped in Chaldea can be seen from several
monuments in the British Museum, and especially from one
in the National Library of Paris, a remarkable stone altar, found
among the ruins of Babylon, upon which is laid a long tri-
angular wedge, thus shown to have been worshipped in Chaldea,
possibly as the basis of the primitive alphabet.
It was in the year 1848 that I first perceived the likeness
between the triangular letters (as I assumed them to be) of
Babylon and Assyria, and those of ancient Greek, and by
comparing the alphabets I thought that I could dissect all the
various groups of wedges into nineteen different letters.
The alphabet I propose is of the most simple construction,
being composed of one, two, and three triangles each, there being
only one letter of four triangles in the nineteen of which the
alphabet is composed, viz., the sh. It is a remarkable fact that
the whole of the inscriptions are resolvable into these nineteen
letters. Again, that by a careful investigation the Roman
and early Greek letters are visibly derived from the primitive
or Assyrian triangular letters as found at Nimroud. Mr.
Layard says that (< the characters at Nimroud long preceded
those of Korsabad or Kouyunjik.? This is an important fact,
as it proves that the most simple were the earliest. It
was from one of the slabs from the Nimroud Palace that
I have constructed my alphabet.
The Egyptians very early adopted the universal symbol of
the equilateral triangle in the form of their pyramids, and
does not every Freemason know the value of it in his ancient
and world-wide secret signs ?
Now although the accomplished Rawlinson brothers have
repeatedly admitted that the Assyrian language is unmistakeably
Semitic, and bears the closest relationship to the Hebrew, they,
and the whole European school, have not followed this conviction,
but practically attempted to unlock the door with a Persian


Mg ?
key of a thousand years younger date; whereas, though loth
languages were written in the triangular characters, there is
such a marked difference in their combination that no group
in the later Persian language could guide to the meaning of
those of Nineveh and Babylonia. If it were so used, it would
only guide as the letters of the English word dog would to the
Italian word Doge, having quite a different meaning.
I will now give some illustrations of the use of my alphabet,
JEWS BRINGING TRIBUTE IN NIMEOUD TEMPLE.
I read the first two lines of the so-called ? Standard In-
scription,? written across many of the colossal figures in the
first gallery, from the most ancient North-west Palace.
? Proclamation?Palace of Aashoik.* ?
? Oh, that thou wouldst cry aloud and scatter the multitude of rock
gods. My God, my God, oh, that thou wouldst show me the true God.?
There is then an allusion to the City of Baalbeg, destroyed for
its crimes and gross depravity, though equal in splendour to
Aashoik.
* The mound immediately adjoining Nimroud is to this day called
Baasheikah.


On the vase from Halicarnassus, on which the name of
VASE OF HALICARNASSUS.
Xerxes is said to be ascertained in hieroglyphics, I read in
the cuneiform not Xerxes, as does Sir Henry, but
? The king rests in peace, during a long dark season, undisturbed by
vain ambitious cares.?
The following is a translation from an inscription on the
back of one of the winged Bulls :
? Made to represent the Supreme God. lam Almighty, dwelling in
heaven?s circle, revolving and re-revolving in the vast expanse, who faileth
not in illuming heaven?s mysterious fires ; whose going out is nothing to
equal the splendour of his coming return.?
Here is a strange mixture of the worship of the Sun and the
idea of the Trinity, and also of the Cherubim. The winged
human-headed bull is certainly a triad form.
Mr. Layard himself seems to have anticipated the employ-
ment of this relic as an argument for some theory like mine,
for he says :


? It would not be difficult for those who are apt at discovering the hidden
meaning of ancient symbols to invest the arrow-head or wedge of the
Assyrian characters (assuming also the form of an equilateral triangle),
with sacred and mythic properties, and to find out the direct illustration of
the sacred triad?the basis of the Chaldean worship.?
I have attempted to translate parts of Sir H. Rawlins on?s
rubbings from the celebrated Rock of Bebistun. fC f (of)


The new reading here, as the speech of the conquering king,
I consider to be ?
" They shall not find mercy or rest (during) a long time of adversity, the
foolish race, but imprisonment for life.?
The attitude of the king, as represented on the rock with his
hand uplifted towards the prisoners with ropes round
their necks, would seem to render this meaning very probable.
One of the captives has an inscription upon his tunic, which
Sir Henry reads by his alphabet:?
? This Phraortes was an impostor. He thus declared?l am Xathrites
of the race of Cyaxares. lam King of Media.?
Whereas I, who make much more in quantity by reading
on my single letter plan than Sir Henry by his groups and
ideographs, decipher the tunic inscription thus: ?
? Behold, I, Yaja in captivity and misfortune : governing well the pro-
vince through a long troublous time, I saw not affliction; a babbling mis-
chievous spirit flew from province to province, inflaming the mind; vainly
I administered justice and mercy, desiring tranquillity and rest. Malice
grew triumphant (literally, fat). So mercy I never expect. Our land in
trouble, our water in affliction, and I in odour and tranquillity, like a stag-
nant pool. lam Yaja (a fool), &c. It is folly to expect mercy, forgive-
ness will never be. T am Yaja.?
This also gives probable sense. My principle aim and motive
is to add my mite of knowledge to the common stock. The
world, after many experiments in this direction, is beginning
to be awakened to the fact that some new method is wanting,
at once simple, clear, and self-evident, for the rendering of the
Nineveh inscriptions. The idea just stated might be fraught,
as I think and believe, with much importance to letters, to
philosophy, and to religion. I feel that it is not for me to
carry my theory out to its full development; neither my time
nor circumstances in life will permit of it. But if I can
point the way, or give the clue to any whose time and means
will enable them to prosecute this idea, I shall feel I have not
lived or laboured wholly in vain.
