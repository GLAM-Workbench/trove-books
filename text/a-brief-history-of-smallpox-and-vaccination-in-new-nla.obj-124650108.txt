A Brief History of SMALLPOX and VACCINATION in
New South Wales, from the Foundation of the
Colony to the Present Day.
At a time when the history of smallpox and
vaccination throughout the world is being dis-
cussed in scientific circles, I may be permitted
to describe briefly the various epidemics of
smallpox in New South Wales, and also to
record some facts connected with the practice
of vaccination since its introduction over ninety
years ago.
I.—THE EARLIEST EPIDEMIC OF
SMALLPOX.
There appears to be some considerable doubt
among scientific men as to the exact time of
the first appearance of smallpox in Australia.
Hirsch* states that “ the Continent of Aus-
tralia up to 1838 had enjoyed an absolute im-
munity from smallpox. Towards the end of
that year the disease appeared at Sydney, having
been imported, probably, from China. It lasted,
however, only a short time, and remained
absent from the continent until 1868.” Theßoyal
Vaccination Commission, whose final report
was published in September, 1896, assumes
this to be correct, and adds: “Australia, by
virtue of its geographical position, and the con-
sequent separation by long sea voyage from in-
fected ports, enjoyed for a long time a sort of
natural isolation.” There can be little doubt,
however, that both these statements are in-
accurate.
Wentworthf tells us that some few years
before the foundation of the colony the small-
pox committed the most frightful ravages
among the aborigines. It w r as said to have
been introduced by Captain Cook. Many of
the contemporaries of those who fell victims to
the scourge were still living when Wentw r orth
wrote his account. “ The deep furrows,” he
says, “ which remain in some of their counten-
ances show how narrowly they escaped the
same premature destiny. The recollection of
this dreadful malady will long survive in the
traditionary songs of this simple people. The
consternation which it excited is still as fresh
in their minds as if it had been an occurrence
of but yestei’day, although the generation which

witnessed its horrors has almost passed away-
The moment one of them was seized with it was
the signal for abandoning him to his fate.
Brothers deserted their brothers, children their
parents, and parents their children ; and, in
some of the cases on the coast, heaps of decayed
bones still indicate the spots where the helpless
sufferers were left to expire, not so much, per-
haps from the violence of the disease as from
want of sustenance.” I cannot find any other
record of the disease having been observed in
Australia before 1788, and I am therefore dis-
posed to think that Wentworth’s account may
refer to the epidemic of 1789.
asserts that smallpox broke out
among the natives shortly after the settlement
of New South Wales in 1788, but this is mani-
festly an error.
There can be no doubt, however, that small-
pox in a virulent form attacked the aborigines
in 1789. Collins § gives the following descrip-
tion of this visitation :
“ Early in the month of April, and through-
out its continuance, the people whose business
called them down the harbour daily reported
that they found, either in excavations of the
rocks, or lying upon the beaches and points of
the different coves, the bodies of many of the
wretched natives of the country. The cause of
this mortality remained unknown until a family
was brought into the settlement, and the dis-
order pronounced to have been smallpox. It
was not a desirable circumstance to introduce a
disorder into the colony which was raging with
such fatal violence among the natives of the
country; but the saving the lives of any of
these people was an object of no small import-
ance, as the knowledge of our humanity, and
the benefits which might be tendered them,
would, it was hoped, do away with the evil im-
pressions which they had received. Two elderly
men, a boy, and a girl were received, and placed
in a separate hut in the hospital. The men
were too far overcome by the disease to derive
any benefit from the exertions of the medical
gentlemen who attended them, but the children

did well. From the native who resided in the
settlement it was understood that many families
had been swept off by this scourge of the human
race, and that others, to avoid it, had fled into
the interior paits of the country. Whether it
had ever appeared among them before could not
be discovered, but it was certain that they gave
it a name (gal-gal-ld), a circumstance which
seemed to indicate a pre-acquaintance with it.’
Phillip||, in a letter to Lord Sydney (1790),
said he had been unable to determine whether
smallpox was a disease to which the natives
were subject before any Europeans visited the
country, or whether it was brought by the
French ships in 1788. It never appeared on
board of any of the English ships during their
passage, nor in the settlement, until several of
the natives had been seen dead with the dis-
order in various parts of the harbour, and the
blacks above referred to had been brought in to
the hospital. It was estimated that one-half of
those inhabiting the district died during this
epidemic.
Mrs. MacarthurU, in a letter written March
7th, 1791, and Daniel Southwelllf (an officer of
H.M.S. Sirius), in a letter to the Rev. W.
Butler, dated April 14th, 1790, confirm these
accounts.
Collins continues his narrative as follows :
“ While the eruptions of this disorder continued
upon the children, a seaman belonging to the
Supply was seized with it and died, but its
baneful effects were not experienced by any
white person of the settlement, although there
were several very young children in it at the time.
It had been greatly feared, from the first intro-
duction of the boy and girl into the settlement,
that the native who had been for some time
there, and whose attention to them during their
illness excited the admiration of everyone that
witnessed it, would take the disorder, as on
his person were found none of those traces of
its ravages which are frequently left behind.
It happened as had been predicted. He fell a
victim to the disease in eight days after he was
seized with it, to the infinite regret of everyone
who had witnessed how little of the savage was
found in his manner, and how quickly he was
substituting in its place a docile, affable, and
truly amiable deportment.”
A most pathetic incident is reported by
Collins in the work quoted (p. 383). A native,
who at that time resided at Sydney, on going

and 709.
down the harbour to look for his former com-
panions, was described by those who witnessed
his emotions as suffering the extreme of agony.
He looked anxiously into the different coves
that they visited. Not a vestige on the sand
was to be found of human foot; the excava-
tions in the rocks were filled with putrid bodies
of those who had fallen victims to the disorder ;
not a living person was anywhere to be met
with. It seemed as if, flying from the con-
tagion, they had left the dead to bury the
dead. He lifted up his hands and eyes in
silent agony for some time. At length he ex-
claimed, “ All dead ! all dead !” And then he
hung his head in mournful silence, which he
preserved during the remainder of the excur-
sion. No white person took the infection
during the epidemic, though many of them
were exposed to it, but a North American
Indian, a seaman on H.M.S. Supply, died of it.
There can be little doubt that the disease was
smallpox, for many of those who recovered
from it bore the characteristic marks in after
life.
Hunter* and Flanaganf also describe the
disease in such a manner as to leave no doubt
as to its having been smallpox in a virulent
form.
The question then arises : —Was smallpox in-
troduced into Australia by Captain Cook, or by
the First Fleet, or by the French ships, or, on
the other hand, was it an endemic disease ? I
must confess my inability to answer this in a
satisfactory manner at present.
II. —THE INNTRODUCTION OF
VACCINATION.
In the year 1803 the Royal Jennerian
Society, which had just been established in
England, forwarded to the Governor of
New South Wales a “ Pacquet of the
Vaccine Matter for Inoculation.” This supply
of lymph arrived in Sydney by the trans-
port Coromandel on Monday, May 7, 1804.
By the same vessel there also arrived a small
quantity, which had been forwarded by Mr.
John Ring, member of the Medical Council, to
Mr. Savage, the Assistant Colonial Surgeon.
This latter was said to have been “ put up in a
different manner to that sent by the Royal
Jennerian Society.” Immediately on its receipt
the Governor (Captain P. G. King, R.N.)
directed the principal surgeon, Mr. Thomas
Jamison, to make instant use of it on three
orphan children. Mr. Harris, surgeon of the
* Historical Journal of the Transactions at Port Jackson and
Norfolk Island. London, p. 134.
f History of N.S.W., London, 1862, Yol. 1., p. 46.


New South Wales Corps, also vaccinated several
children belonging to the military, and Mr.
Savage performed the operation on a number of
other children. I am unable to state positively
the exact day on which the first vaccination
was performed, but it was certainly between
the Bth and 12th of May, 1804. To Messrs.
Jamison, Savage and Harris belongs the honour
of performing the first vaccinations in Aus-
tralia.
Mr. Harris’s experiments did not meet with
the desired success, so that gentleman repeated
the trial upon four others, “ in a manner not
before tried,” on Thursday, May 17, 1804, and
this time with the happiest effect. Messrs.
Jamison and Savage were probably rewarded
for their efforts, for on June 3 the following
notice appeared in the Sydney Gazette :
“ Notice.
“ As the cowpox is now fully established in
the colony, it is hoped no parent or guardian of
any children will omit availing themselves of
so great a blessing, which, as has been shown in
the Gazette of the 13th of May last, is an infal-
lible preventative against that generally fatal
distemper, the smallpox.”
The account referred to (of May 13) was an
elaborate table of statistics published by the
Royal Jennerian Society, showing the efficacy of
vaccination.
In the issue of June 3 there also appeared
the following under the heading of “ General
Orders ” :
“ Such children as the parents or guardians
may wish to have inoculated are to attend at
Parramatta on Tuesday and Wednesday next,
after which a permanent attendance will be
directed at Sydney, Parramatta, and Hawkes-
bury.”
On June 24 a further notice appeared
“ All parents who wish their children to be
inoculated with the cowpox are desired to
attend the Principal Surgeon at the General
Hospital on Saturday next with their children ;
and after that day they are to attend every
Wednesday and Saturday from eight to ten
o’clock in the morning, during which hours
regular attendance will be given to all descrip-
tions of persons desirous of availing themselves
of so great a blessing as that which now offers
in the happy introduction of the vaccine virus.”
On October 14, 1804, Mr. Thomas Jamison,
the principal surgeon, published a paper en-
titled General Observations on the Smallpox , in
the Sydney Gazette. In this interesting com-
munication the author states that it was
u generally accredited by the medical gentlemen
of the colony on its first establishment that the
smallpox had been introduced among the
natives by the crews of the French ships then
lying in Botany Bay ; but since that period on
vestige of that disease has ever appeared.” He
concludes his paper as follows :—“ I shall only
remark that the preventative qualities of the
cowpock are incontrovertibly established ; no
preparatory regimen or extraordinary care are
requisite in its application or progress ; it is
attended by no sort of danger or external
blemish; wherefore, should parents delay to
embrace the salutary benefit now tendered gra-
tuitously, and the vaccine infection be lost, the
most distressing reprehensibility may accrue to
them from their remissness in the preservation
of their offspring, whose destruction hereafter
may be reasonably apprehended to ensue from
the smallpox, should it ever visit this colony in
a natural state.” This article has a further
interest in the fact that it was the first medical
paper ever published in Australia.
There does not appear to have been any
active opposition on the part of parents to the
operation of vaccination, but owing to negli-
gence many of the children remained unvacci-
nated. Mr. Jamison and Mr. Savage, who
were enthusiasts on the subject, did their best
to reach all classes of the community, fearing
lest smallpox should break out when there was
no vaccine lymph in the colony. They visited
the various districts in the settlement, spread-
ing abroad the virtues of vaccination, and in-
duced a very large number of the inhabitants
to submit their children for the operation.
Mr. Jamison’s fears that the supply of lymph
would run short were eventually realised.
Wentworth*, in speaking of the epidemic of
smallpox, already referred to, says, “ This fatal
inveteracy of the disorder, when once intro-
duced into the colony, has not been without its
counterpoising benefit. It has induced the local
Government to adopt proper measures for
avoiding the propagation of a similar contagion
among the colonists. The vaccine matter was
introduced with this object many years back,
but, as all the children in the colony were im-
mediately inoculated, it was again lost from the
want of a sufficient number of subjects to afford
a supply of fresh virus, and, for many years
afterwards, every effort that was made for its
re-introduction proved abortive.”
How it was re-introduced will form matter
for consideration in future chapters.

III.—MR. THOMAS JAMISON'S WORK, 1804-
1809.
It is quite evident that, owing to the exertions
of the medical men in charge of the settlement,
a large number of children were vaccinated
within the first half of the year 1804 On Sun-
day, July 1, 1804, the Sydney Gazette contained
the following paragraph :
“On Monday a number of children were in-
oculated for the Vaccine Pox by J. Harris,
Esq., Surgeon to the New South Wales Corps :
and the operation was on Saturday performed on
many others by Thomas Jamison, Esq., Prin-
cipal Surgeon : and no doubt can be entertained
that every parent desirous of preserving their
children from that most dreadful scourge to
humanity, the Small Pox, and of promoting its
extermination, will readily embrace the present
favourable opportunities.”
On Sunday, October 14, 1804, the Sydney
Gazette published Mr. Jamison’s paper, General
Observations on the Small Fox, to which I have
already alluded. As this paper is of considerable
historical and scientific interest I reproduce it
here in full.
“An erroneous opinion, in relation to the
Small Pox, being generally received, and as an
inference deduced therefrom equally fallacious
with the principle upon which it is founded, I
conceive it a duty incumbent on me as Principal
Surgeon of this Colony, to remove prepossessions
which, if adhered to, must be productive of the
most calamitous consequences to the Rising
Generation of these Colonies.
“ First, it is conceived by a number of parents
and others having the care of children, that they
have had the small-pox in a natural way : and
secondly, that little danger is to be apprehended
from its effects in this climate. In refutation of
a conjecture fatal to be indulged, I must observe,
the disease by some considered as the smallpox,
is no other than an eruptive appearance on the
skin, proceeding from climate and other consti-
tutional causes : —Others may be deceived by the
chicken pox —an error that may be readily
imbibed by those who are not conversant in the
natural smallpox; for I most positively affirm,
on my own personal knowledge for ten years
past, that not a single instance of the latter
disease has occurred in this country.
“It is generally accredited by the medical
gentlemen of the colony on its first establishment
that the smallpox had been introduced among
the natives by the crews of the French ships
then lying in Botany Bay ; but since that period
no vestige of that disease has ever appeared.
“ In contradiction to so ridiculous an idea as
that the natural smallpox should not carry with
it, and be productive of effects baneful and de-
structive in the extreme, I have here to observe
that at the Cape of Good Hope (the latitude
being nearly the same with this place) the in-
habitants dread the appearance of the smallpox
as in other countries they do a plague, from the
fatal malignity of its tendency and effects ; and
I have no doubt, that should the disease ever
visit this colony in a natural state, and particu-
larly in the Summer Season, it would carry off
nine-tenths of those who might receive the in-
fection.
“ From the foregoing facts and circumstances,
I would earnestly recommend Parents to avail
themselves of the blessing held out to them by
the provident care of the Parent Country, by
having their children inoculated with the Vac-
cine or Cow Pock —an infallible Preventative of
that loathsome, disgusting, and too-often fatal
disease, when taken in the natural way.
“ It is almost needless to remark further on
the particular virtues and properties of a dis-
covery, announced and recommended to public
notice, for the general benefit, from such high
and indisputable authority : I shall only remark
that the preventative qualities of the Cow Pock
are incontrovertibly established ; no pieparatory
regimen or extraordinary care are requisite in its
application or progress : it is attended by no sort
of danger or external blemish; wherefore, should
parents delay to embrace the salutary benefit
now tendered gratuitously, and the Vaccine In-
fection be lost, the most distressing reprehensi-
bility may accrue to them from their remissness
in the preservation of their Offspring, whose
destruction hereafter may be reasonably appre-
hended to ensue from the smallpox, should it
ever visit this Colony in a natural state.”
The Sydney Gazette , in referring to this paper,
said:
“ There was every reason to hope, that upon
the happy introduction into the Colony of the
Vaccine Virus, every parent would have availed
themselves of so inestimable a blessing without
the necessity of repeated solicitation. The
several medical gentlemen have sedulously
adopted the conduct of the British Faculty,
whose benignant labours extending over the
whole surface of the globe, reflect eternal honour
to the Country which to the discovery gave birth
and although in numerous inoculations that
have been made the innocency of the opera-
tion has incontestably proved itself, yet
indolence or thoughtlessness prevents many
from taking advantage of the opportunities
that have long offered, and even still continue.
If any specious or any plausible argument can
be set up against the necessity of Vaccination,


they must give way to the unanswerable re-
marks of the Surgeon-General of this Colony,
Contained in the preceding page : and any objec-
tion to so innocent an operation in which the
very existence of our children is deeply in-
terested must hereafter be considered as a flimsy
absurdity, only started with a view to saving
trouble. Parents are by that gentleman again
exhorted to attend to this material point of duty ;
and possibly many who regretted having delayed
the object until it was now thought too late,
will recover from the inconsoleable reflection,
and promptly prevent the possibility of a
funeral pang.”
The supply of vaccine lymph appears to have
become exhausted soon after this, for there is no
mention of any further vaccination until De-
cember 8, 1805, when it was announced in the
Sydney Gazette that “ Mr. McMillan, Acting-
Surgeon of His Majesty’s ship Buffalo, pro-
cured some of the vaccine matter of Mr. Went-
worth, Surgeon at Norfolk Island : and having
bestowed every care and attention in inoculating
several children and others on the passage from
thence to Hobart Town, he had the satisfaction
to be assured before he left that settlement of
his having fully succeeded in communicating so
inestimable a blessing; and as Mr. McMillan
has been so fortunate as to succeed in bringing
the virus here, it is hoped an attention to Mr.
Jamison’s Advertisement will secure a continu-
ance of its benefits to these settlements.”
The advertisement referred to, which appeared
in the Gazette on December 8 and 15, was as
follows ;—“ Inoculation for the Cow Pox.—
Thos. Jamison, Esq., Principal Sui’geon, de-
sirous of promoting the benevolent design of
Vaccination throughout the Colony, requests
that Settlers and other distant inhabitants who
have children that have not yet received the
benefit, will forward a list to him at Sydney,
specifying with their names and places of abode
the number of children for Inoculation, in order
that convenient places of attendance may be
chosen in each neighbourhood, and a time for
performing the operation appointed, of which
timely information will be given in the
Gazette .”
Apparently, even this did not produce the de-
sired effect, for Mr. Jamison published an ap-
peal to the public on January 19, 1806 :—“ I
finally address the parents of children in this
Colony, on a subject which is of much more im-
portance than they seem to conceive it.—lt is
an object of the first importance, as it has no
less in view than the preservation of the lives of
the rising generation of this Colony. In adopt-
ing the measures held out of inoculating their
Children with the Cow Pock, in order to pre-
vent the fatality which must attend their having
the natural Small Pox; it being ascertained be-
yond a doubt, that the inoculation with the vac-
cine virus is an effectual preventative against that
dreadful and loathsome malady; I conceive it
ought to be one of the most serious considera-
tions that can well occupy the mind of a tender
parent, who has the well-being of his infant off-
spi’ing at heart, and wishes to discharge that
Christian duty which is incumbent on them, in
adopting every measure to preserve their health
and prolong their days. Let me again impress
on your minds the serious tendency ofneglecting
so favourable an opportunity, as I have formerly
tendered you my services, gratuitously ; not-
withstanding, parents have been so remiss in
coming forward with their children, that I now
consider it necessary to inform them that the
vaccine virus must be inevitably lost if they do
not permit their children to be inoculated
If they do not embrace the present opportunity
they may repent hereafter, when too late, of
the great injustice they have done to their
children. Should ever the natural smallpox
ever break out in this Colony, I fear few who
are seized with that disease will escape with
their lives; and I can take it on myself to
assure the inhabitants of this settlement that
the vaccine inoculation has been attended with
the greatest success : out of One Thousand &
upwards who have been inoculated in the
Colony with cow pock, I can atfirm that not
one has died, nor has it left behind the smallest
blemish. I again beg parents to turn this cir-
cumstance over in their minds, and give it due
consideration, which I trust will operate so
forcibly as to induce them to adopt a measure
so truly beneficial to their infant families in
protecting them from the baneful effects of
a disease, which in its natural state and
tendency has frequently been little more in
mortality to the Plague itself. Should all the
evils I have pointed out occur one day or other
I trust the Public will allow that no reprehen-
sibility can attach to me, as I have used every
persuasion and exertion in my power, to carry
such a laudable system into effect, as far as my
ability extends. If frustrated by those de-
signed to benefit thereby, I can only lament
their obstinacy, and express my sorrow for the
injury done their infant families.”
(Signed) “ T. Jamison.”
It would appear from this that in one year
and eight months over one thousand vaccina-
tions were performed in the colony. The total
population of the settlement in September, 1805,
was 6.954 ; therefore over one-seventh of the


inhabitants had been vaccinated, and this happy
result was undoubtedly due to Jamison’s exer-
tions. Would that he were a Government
Vaccinator in a populous district of the colony
at the present time !
Mr. Jamison left Sydney for England, by the
ship Admiral Gambler , on March 29, 1809.
IV.— MR. REDFERN'S REPORT, 1809.
Mr. W. Redfern, a melical man, was ap-
parently the next to interest himself in this
subject. Mr. Redfern, on October 16, 1809,
sent the following communication to the Lieu-
tenant-Governor, Colonel William Patterson
“ Sir, It is with extreme pleasure I at length
feel myself enabled to state, with a degree of
certainty, that my endeavours to establish the
vaccine Inoculation with the Virus I had the
honor of receiving from you, have perfectly
succeeded. The re-introduction of so great a
blessing to the rising generation, as an infallible,
safe, and mild Preventive of one of the most
fatal diseases to which the Human Species is
liable, the Small Pox ; and which, fortunately
for the Inhabitants of this Colony, has not yet
made its appearance among them, will, I am
confident, afford the most heartfelt satisfaction
and highest gratification to your benevolent
and philanthropic mind.
“ That this communication was not made at
an earlier period, I trust you, Sir, will not im-
pute to negligence or disinclination, as it was
with the utmost pain and difficulty, I was able
to carry on my experiments, from a very severe
inflammation in my right hand, which com-
menced the very day after I had received the
virus, and totally incapacitated me from
writing ; and, indeed, I was also unwilling to
hazard a report of its success until I had estab-
lished it beyond the possibility of doubt, which,
I am happy to say, is now the case.
“ I have enclosed, Sir, for your information
a list of those who have been vaccinated, with
the success attending it.
“ It now remains, Sir, for such measures to
be adopted as your wisdom may suggest, that
may appear best calculated to carry your
benevolent intentions into effect, in order to
diffuse it as generally as possible From those
in the Superior Ranks of Life, we may, I pre-
sume, calculate upon every support that ex-
ample and precept can furnish ; but it becomes
highly necessary to impress on the minds of the
poorer orders of people, whose ignorance renders
them but too susceptible of the grossest and
most unfounded prejudices, the usefulness,
safety, and superior advantages of this new
plan of Inoculation. At the same time, I hops
it will be managed with such judgment and dis-
cretion as will tend to keep it constantly alive ;
for there will always be a considerable risque of
the Virus becoming effete from the length of
time that must necessarily elapse in conveying
it either from Europe or India. This object
can only, in my humble opinion, be obtained by
Inoculating but a few at a time.
“ I remain, Sir,
“ With the greatest respect,
“ Your Honor’s most obedient Servant,
“W. REDFERN.”
Mr. Redfern, who was evidently an en-
thusiast, appears to have received considerable
encouragement in his good work, for the Sydney
Gazette contained the following paragraph on
October 29, 1809 :
“Mr. Redfern has already made consider-
able progress in the Vaccine Inoculation, having
performed the operation upon a number of
young persons in Sydney. Its success in for
ever after preventing the small pox from taking
place is universally established. No pain at-
tends the operation; no danger, and no possi-
bility of future blemish. What then would be
the sensation of a parent, whose obstinacy had
exempted their children from so great a bless-
ing, should that most dreadful of all human
scourges, the small pox, unhappily here be in-
troduced, and the Vaccine Inoculation at the
time extinct ! It is the design of Mr. Redfern
to visit the different settlements alternately,
and thus to extend its benefits throughout the
Colony. His exertions are liberally patronised ;
and it is sincerely to be hoped will meet with
no impediment, as humanity, and more imme-
diately the preservation of our children is its
great and only object.”
Mr. Redfern acted for some time as As-
sistant Surgeon on the Civil Medical Establish-
ment of the Colony.
V.— SMALLPOX AND VACCINATION BETWEEN 1809
AND 1830.
From the year 1809 until 1830 I can find very
few references either to smallpox or vaccination
in the colony. It would appear from the
literature of the period, however, that the
colonial surgeons succeeded to a marked degree
in inducing the people to submit themselves


and their children for vaccination. Wentworth*
tells us that after many failures to re-introduce
the vaccine lymph, success at last crowned their
efforts. “ Through the indefatigable exertions of
Dr. Burke, of the Mauritius,” he says, “ the
colonists are again in possession of this inestim-
able blessing, and there can be no doubt that
proper precautions will be taken to prevent
them from being again deprived of it.”
Smallpox does not appear to have caused any
trouble among the inhabitants during this period.
Heatonf says that the disease made its appear-
ance in Sydney, July 25, 1825. I am unable,
however, to verify this statement, and am in-
clined to think the date is inaccurate.
Cunningham,J a surgeon in the navy, who
made four voyages to New South Wales, and
who resided two years, at occasional intervals,
in the colony, and travelled over a considerable
portion of it, declared in 1827 that smallpox
was then unknown in Australia.
Dr. John Frazer § quotes a friend as saying,
“ When I arrived at Dungog, in 1840,1 observed
several oldish men deeply marked with traces of
smallpox, and, on questioning them, I found
that when they were young a fearful epidemic
of this complaint had raged in the district and
carried off great numbers of the aboriginal
population. I was informed that, when the
disease first appeared, they were camped at a
place now called by the whites ‘ Black Camp
Creek.’ Here the disease was of a very virulent
type, and, after a week or so, they were unable
to bury their dead, and day by day kept moving
onwards, leaving their dead on the ground.
Before this the district was populous, but after
it the blacks never recovered their numerical
strength.” These may have been some of the
survivors of the epidemic of 1789, fifty years
before. I am, however, inclined to believe that
smallpox was, in the early days of the colony,
an endemic disease among the aborigines.
VI. —THE EPIDEMIC OF 1830-31.
In the early part of 1830, Mr. Brown, of
Wallerawang, heard of the existence of smallpox
among the northern tribes, but he saw no cases
until August, when he found five blacks near
the Castlereagh River who were suffering from
the disease. Two of these were in the early
stages, and three were more advanced. One of
these men was afterwards seen by Mr. Brown with

pits, like those of smallpox, on different parts of
his body ; and he ascertained that the others
had died of the disease. Mr. Brown did not
meet with any more cases of the disease till the
beginning of August, 1831, when it manifested
itself in three blacks who had been in close
communication with some others, recently arrived
from the Lachlan, and who had but a short
time recovered sufficiently to be able to travel
These men stated that the disease had been
raging in their part of the country, and that
several had died of it. Some of the Wallera-
wang blacks, convinced of its contagious nature,
had fled to the Emu Plains to escape infection.
Three of their number, who afterwards returned,
were seized with it.
The late Dr. George Bennett,|| writing
about 1832, tells us that ; —“ About two years
previous an eruptive febrile disease made its
appearance among the natives of the Wellington
Valley, resembling the smallpox in its principal
characters. Some alarm was experienced in
consequence among the Europeans, to whose
children the disease had as yet been fortunately
unknown. About a year after I was informed
it prevailed among the aborigines of the Lachlan,
Burragorang, and Cox’s River, and I remarked
that several of the blacks at Goulburn Plains,
and also at other parts of the colony, had pits on
their faces resembling those produced by small-
pox, and which, they informed me, were caused
by the disease in question. The name that this
disease is known by among the aborigines is
“ Thunna, thunna,” or Trinna, trinna,” and they
describe it as being attended by sore throat,
headache, and high febrile symptoms upon the
day previous to the appearance of the eruptions ;
the latter were described to me as commencing
in a similar manner, and passing through the
same stages as is usual in smallpox, covering the
face and all parts of the body, even to the soles
of the feet and palms of the hands ; it was also
stated that adults were more covered with erup-
tions and suffered more severely from the disease
than children, and the aggravation of the
symptoms caused much mortality among them.
Among the children it often occurred that only
a few scattered eruptions would appear, and the
febrile symptoms also assume a very mild
character. No deaths occurred in these cases.”
Dr. Bennett states that the blacks in the
Wellington Valley did not regard the disease as
of foreign introduction. They considered it con-
tagious, and when one party was attacked by
this formidable disease the others deserted them
to avoid being infected. None of the children
of the soldiers stationed at Wellington Valley

took the disorder, although the blacks about the
settlement were suffering from it. These child-
ren had never had the smallpox, but they
probably had been vaccinated.
Owing to the excitement produced by the
prevalence of the disease, the Government
appointed Dr. Mair, Assistant Surgeon of the
39th Regiment, to go into the interior and
report upon the outbreak. Dr. Mair, unfortu-
nately, arrived upon the scene too late to observe
the progress of the disease through the different
stages, but the information he procured has been
quite sufficient to plase the nature of the disease
beyond doubt. Dr. Mair’s report was sub-
stantially as follows :—At Wellington Valley
the disease was first noticed in October, 1830,
and continued to affect the blacks in that district
until December. A convict, named George
Clark, who had resided with the native tribes,
far in the interior, for several years, stated that
the disorder proceeded from the north-west
coast, and spared none of the tribes as far as
Liverpool Plains, attacking 20 or 30 at a time.
The King, or chief, of the tribe among whom
Clark had been naturalised, was first seized
with it, and died. The plan of treatment
followed in the case of the King was immersion
in cold water. Four persons of less note under-
went the same, and only one survived. The
consequence was, that other medicinal measures
were thought of, and the cold bath was aban-
doned. Scorching the hair from the head,
pricking the pustules with a sharp-pointed fish
bone, then squeezing out the fluid contained in
them with the flat part of the instrument, was
the next mode of cure adopted by the Kradjee,
or physician. This operation is said to have
suggested itself to him from the observation
that the pustules burst spontaneously, and dis-
charged whitish matter, in the first case of
recovery.
Dr. Mair continues that the disease appears
to have assumed a considerable variety of forms
in different individuals, but the following symp-
toms may be taken as common to all of them :
For several successive days the patient felt
languid, indolent, and oppressed, lost his appetite,
suffered from headache, pain in chest or abdomen,
and feverish symptoms. The usual duration of
this incipient stage was from two to eight days.
It was followed by an eruption of small red
spots, resembling flea-bites, which generally
commenced on the face, and gradually spread,
more or less thickly, over the head, breast, and
extremities. The tongue and lips were also
involved in the eruption, and also, in many
instances, the soles of the feet. When the
eruption had fully developed itself, which gener-
ally occurred in 24 hours, a remission was
observed to take place in the febrile symptoms,
but the patient then complained of pain in the
throat, and could only swallow liquids. The
small red spots, or papules, were converted into
vesicles or pustules, in periods varying from
three to seven or eight days ; the fluid contained
in these vesicles or pustules was milky or straw-
coloured. Scabs formed and fell off at different
periods, according to the length of time occupied
by the maturation of the vesicles or pustules.
These were, occasionally, confluent on the nose
and cheeks, and frequently left permanent marks
or indentations on the skin. The usual duration
of the disease was a fortnight or three
weeks, but there was often extreme weakness
after this. Death was said to happen generally
about the third day after the appearance of the
eruption. The tongue became much swollen
and covered with livid spots, the breathing
greatly oppressed, and deglutition impracticable.
Secondary fever was seldom observed, but this
is easily explained by the early fatality of the
disease in the severe cases. Among the tribes
to the north-west of the Liverpool Plains, the
disease appears to have approached more nearly
to the description of confluent smallpox, as met
with in Europe.
There was some difference of opinion at the
time as to whether the disease was smallpox or
chicken pox. Dr. George Busby* in a letter
dated Bathurst, 19th October, 1831, in referring
to this epidemic, saysl am, upon the whole,
at present disposed to regard the eruptive
disease lately prevalent among the black natives
in this district as varicella, manifesting itself in
a more aggravated form than it is known usually
to assume, but possessing by no means a malig-
nant character, nor likely, under ordinary
circumstances of comfort and attention attain-
able in civilised society, to prove fatal in more
than a few instances; the mortality it has
occasioned among the blacks being sufficiently
accounted for by the unfavourable circumstances
in which they are placed.” Dr. Mair, however,
stated that the greater number of persons who
had watched its progess, and who had also seen
smallpox in England, pronounced it to be that
disorder.
The epidemic of 1830-31 appears to have been
felt in different parts of the colony.
Flanaganj says that ‘‘ Towards the close of the
year (1831) a cutaneous disease, similar to the
smallpox, was prevalent among the aborigines
in the northern parts of the colony. In October,
a runaway prisoner of the Crown, from Moreton

Bay, was brought, by some blacks, to Port
Macquarie, and there delivered up to the
authorities, a species of voluntary service which
the aborigines frequently performed, for the
Government, influenced, probably, by the
feeling that to get rid of such persons
was also a service rendered to their own tribes.
It was observed that the skin of the man thus
restored was much disfigured, bearing the marks
of a recent disease of an eruptive nature. The
blacks, having fullfilled their mission, went
away, but after a few days’ absence returned
to the settlement, saying that they came from
Trial Bay. They were now affected by the
same disease which had produced such an altera-
tion in the white man, two of them being covered
from head to foot with an eruption having, in
all respects, the appearance of smallpox. The
infectious nature of the disease was soon placed
beyond all doubt, for it spread with frightful
rapidity among the Port Macquarie blacks,
until scarcely an individual was free from the
scourge, and in a very brief period large num-
bers died, while many of the warriors presented
a hideous aspect. Every attention was paid to
the sufferers, by order of the Commandant,
Captain Smyth, at whose instance they removed
from the settlement to the north side of the
River Hastings, where they were supplied with
such comforts as their pitiable state required,
and the means of the settlement afforded.
When questioned as to the origin of their
affliction the natives insisted that the disease was
introduced among their tribe by the white man
whom they restored to custody ; but, if this
were true, it was strange —as, indeed, it was
otherwise strange—that not one instance oc-
curred wherein the infection communicated itself
to the white population at the settlement. As far
as possible, to prevent the spread of the disease,
the Governor directed the surgeons of the colony
to vaccinate, gratis, all who applied for that
I urpose, and the settlers were requested to
induce the blacks to submit to the operation.”
VII.— SMALLPOX IN 1830-1840.
Dr. John Eraser, to whom I have already
alluded, has been kind enough to send me
further particulars of smallpox in the Dungog
district. He says : “ The information you
quote was given me many years ago by the late
Dr. Mackinlay, of Dungog, who went there in
1840. He said that shortly before his coming
there the blacks had been visited by a fierce
wave of smallpox which so reduced their
numbers that the tribe was never afterwards
able to recover itself. The people died in such
heaps that the survivors left the dead unburied
and moved on day by day, hoping to escape from
the plague. Like the natives of India, under
an epidemic of smallpox, they thought that a
demon was destroying them, and so they fled
from it. From another source I afterwards
learned that the blacks on the east coast rivers
—-the Manning, the Macleay and others—
suffered severely from smallpox about 1835.
This probably was the same epidemic. The
contagion may have come from the white
people in this country, but it is also possible
that these waves of destruction may have
spread over our black tribes from north
to south, taking their origin from the
islands of the Malay Archipelago.”
In the year 1877 smallpox broke out in
Sydney and gained a footing on the shore. The
alarm created by this outbreak was the
occasion for a lengthy correspondence in the
columns of the Melbourne Argus. That journal
stated on January 19, 1877, that the natives
of the Murray River suffered from the disease
about forty years before. Mr. G. W. Rusden
admitted that smallpox appeared among the
Sydney blacks in 1788, and wrote as follows :
“ It was ascertained afterwards that the disease
committed ravages in the interior to which the
alarmed natives had fled. But it seems to
have died out in the uncongenial atmosphere
of Australia. It is not so plain that the
disease was at the Murray ‘ some forty years
or more ago.’ It is true that in 1835 Sir
Thomas Mitchell said of natives whom he saw
near Fort Bourke, on the Darling, ‘ Most of
them had had the smallpox, but the marks
were not larger than pin-heads. I found that
they had either seen or heard of Captain
Sturt’s party. It seemed to me that the disease
which it was understood had raged among
them (probably from the bad water) had almost
depopulated the Darling, and that these people
were but the remains of a tribe.’ But Mitchell
was mistaken as to the nature of the disease,
as can be proved from Sturt’s narrative, which
was published in England in 1834, and was
probably unknown to Sir Thomas Mitchell in
1835. Sturt saw the natives suffering from a
cutaneous disease which was decimating the
tribe, but he did not call it smallpox. On the
sth February, 1829, he and Hamilton Hume
pitied the grief of an old chief who showed
them ‘several young men who had been attacked
by this singular malady.’ .. . ‘lt was
evident their population had been thinned.’
‘ Several of them carried fire-sticks
under the influence of the disease, I have
already noticed, while others were remarked to
have violent cutaneous eruptions all over the
body.’ We cannot suppose that Sturt would


describe smallpox as a ‘ singular malady.’
Again, in 1830, Sturt followed the course of
the Murrumbidgee and Murray. He described
the filthiness of the natives and their loathsome
diseases, but he saw nothing like smallpox, and
he and his companions were continually ‘ obliged
to submit to an examination, and to be pulled
about and fingered all over.’ There was evi-
dently no smallpox on the Murray ‘ some forty
years or more ago,’ though Sir Thomas Mitchell’s
book would lead a careless inquirer to think
that there was ”
Mr. Peter Beveridge quoted the following
extract from a work published by him on
Colonial Ethnology : “ All the very old abori-
ginals in the colony show very distinct traces
of smallpox, and in speaking of the scourge
which has so indelibly left the marks of its
foul presence, they say that it came with the
waters, that is, it followed down the rivers in
the early flood season (about July or August),
laying its death-clutch on every tribe in its
progress, until the whole country became
perfectly decimated by the fell scourge. During
the earlier stages of its ravages, the natives
gave proper sepulture to its victims. At last,
however, the death-rate assumed such immense
proportions, and the panic grew so great, that
burying the bodies was no longer attempted.
The survivors who were strong enough merely
moved their camps daily, leaving the sick
behind to die unattended, and the dead to
fester in the sun, or as food for the wild dogs
and carrion birds, which battened to their
hearts’ content thereon.
“ Ere long the whole atmosphere became
impregnated with the foetid odours arising
from the multitude of decomposing bodies;
and the poor natives began to think that not
one would escape the dreadful air of dreaded
death. At last, however, they became perfectly
reckless, and cared but little whether they
lived or died, that is, if death came to them by
any other means than the pestilential scourge,
but that manner of death was indeed a terror
to them ; and as self-destruction is not an
aboriginal trait, they had to meet the King of
Terrors in this his most filthy guise as best
they could. From what we have been able to
glean in our conversations with the natives on
this scourge, we are inclined to think that it
must have come from Sydney. And if about
forty or fifty years since the inhabitants of
that city passed through the ordeal of this
plague,* there cannot be any doubt remaining
on the subject of its origin.
*A note appended to this stated that since this was written Mr.
Beveridge had learned that smallpox raged in Sydney about IS
or 18 !0.
“ When the bright torrid summer displaced
the moister weather of spring, the disease
gradually died out, or had run its fatal course,
leaving but a sorry remnant of the once
numerous tribes behind; and it was many
years before the panic then created was even
partially forgotten. To this day old men of
the tribes speak of the disease shudderingly,
and with such an amount of loathing and
horror as it is impossible for any other abori-
ginal evil to elicit from their inherent stolidity.
“ This smallpox infliction seems to be the
only occasion (at least they do not retain any
record of others) upon which great numbers
died together from the same cause ; it is there-
fore small wonder if the survivors do look back
on the abominable scourge with feelings of the
intensest dread. The natives attribute the
pestilence to the malign and magical machina-
tions of tribes with whom they were not on
terras of amity. This, however, is only a
matter of course, since they ascribe all the ills
with which Dame Nature smites them to the
same source.”
A correspondent signing himself “M.D.”
expresses his surprise that Mr. Rusden denies
the existence of the disease on the Murray
forty years or more before. “ Of my own
knowledge,” he says, “ I can testify there were
two blacks who died on the Edwards River
about six years ago—one of these (Charlie),
the king of his tribe, was much marked by the
disease ; the other (Jamie Bogie) was not only
much scarred by the disease, but blind also—
both of whom said they had the disease upwards
of forty years ago. Jamie Bogie, though blind,
was one of the best divers and climbers in the
tribe. Charlie always said that many black-
fellows ‘ tumbled down ’ at that time. Had
these men been alive now they would have
been from about 54 to 57 years of age. From
the above fact there can be no doubt the
cutaneous disease Captain Sturt saw the blacks
suffering from was smallpox, though he did
not name it.
“ The decimation the Murray river tribes
suffered about forty years ago shows that this
climate is not more antagonistic to the spread
of this disease than any other climate. I
believe the reason why the disease became
extinct must be attributed to the fact that
the blacks always shift camp on a death taking
place, and never use the opossum rugs or
weapons of the deceased.”
Mr. Thomas Moulden wrote as follows :
“ That smallpox decimated the aborigines
dwelling below the great north-west bend'of
the Murray I can say positively, and I believe
that the period of about forty years since is


•correct. I have seen many natives whose
faces were as deeply pitted as those so fre-
quently met with in England sixty years ago.
“On the banks of the Murray, nearly
opposite to Blanche Town, there was, about
thirty two years since, a native cemetery con
taining hundreds of graves of various sizes,
and these it was said were the victims of a
disease brought from Encounter Bay, a place
much frequented by whaling ships long before
the colonisation of South Australia, the distance
from the one place to the other being about
one hundred miles. The cemetery was on a
large sandy flat, abounding with rare and
beautiful blossoming shrubs. Each grave was
enclosed by boughs, forming a rustic arbor, the
sandy soil being heaped to a height of about
eighteen inches over each body. There were
at that time many natives living who had
recovered from the epidemic and related the
occurrence, but as there is an unsurmountable
barrier to all native traditions from the in-
violable rule of never speaking of the dead, all
corroborative information must come from
trustworthy white men.”
Mr. Busden, replying to “ M.D.,” stated that
he had seen scores of natives pitted with what
was called in the bush “ native pock,” and he
had known its effects to be mistaken even by
experts for smallpox. He did not think that
Sturt and his party had seen smallpox without
recognising it.
An anonymous correspondent, “ W,” said
that about thirteen years before, when on the
Upper Dawson River, in Queensland, he saw
many blacks whose appearance would lead any
one to think they had had the smallpox. They
were pitted all over with good-sized marks, and
one of the tribe was deaf and dumb, from some
cause said or understood to be the result of
this disease. Again, when in charge of Barrow
Creek Station, on the overland telegraph line,
he had occasion to visit Tennent’s Creek—a
station 175 miles north—and there he saw
many blacks, wfliose skin showed all the appear-
ances of smallpox; and as the natives there
wore no clothing whatever, the multitude of
marks on some of them was astonishing. Here,
again, he saw a deaf and dumb black man,
whose skin was marked all over as if ho had
suffered from smallpox, but as he was not a
professional man, and for the further reason
that converse with the Tennent’s Creek blacks
was out of the question, perhaps these marks
were caused by something else. In any case,
the marks were precisely like those left on the
skin after recovery from the disease, and as
far as “W” could ascertain, were caused by
smallpox, or something very like it.
Mr. Rusden, steadily holding the opinion
that the disease referred to was not smallpox,
replied to the former correspondents: ‘-The
place referred to by Mr. Moulden is below the
great north-west bend of the Murray. Of that
locality we have an intimate knowledge from
the works of Captain Sturt and Mr. Eyre.
Sturt, forty-seven years ago, saw much of the
aborigines in that region, and was handled by
them over and over again. lam resolute in
believing that he and his companion, Sir George
McLeay, would not have endured such treat-
ment if smallpox had existed then amongst the
natives.
“ The acquaintance of Eyre with the abori-
gines has been equalled by very few persons
indeed. Thirty-seven years ago he became an
explorer in South Australia. In 1841 he was
appointed resident magistrate of the Murray
district, where he resided about three years
with great advantage to the natives, to the
colonists, and to science. His report was as
follows : ‘ A disease very similar to the small-
pox, and leaving similar marks upon the face,
appears formerly to have been very prevalent,
but I have never met with an existing case,
nor has Mr. Moorhouse (Protector of Aborigines
in Adelaide) ever fallen in with one. It is
said to have come from the eastward originally,
and very probably may have been derived in
the first instance from the Europeans, and the
infection passed along from one tribe to another.
It has not been experienced now for many
years.’ ” In a further letter Mr. Rusden
says : “ Mr. Eyre says it (smallpox) went to
South Australia from the eastward. Mr.
Beveridge says it descended the rivers from
the East Coast Range. That it was not in
existence on the Upper Murrumbidgee forty or
even fifty years ago is well known. There
were cattle stations on that river near Gundagai
nearly fifty years ago. Hume passed through
the district in 1824, Sturt in 1830. The very
old blacks, seen when Mr. Beveridge commenced
his researches thirty-two years ago, would
easily remember the plague they saw in the
end of the last century. It was in 1789 that
smallpox was carried across the mountains.
Introduced by the French in January, 1788,
its ravages did not prostrate the Sydney tribe
until early in 1789. It would therefore be
expected that not till towards the end of the
century would distant tribes in the interior
suffer in like manner. I think Mr. Beveridge
has been misinformed as to the raging of small-
pox in Sydney in 1829-30. It was not among
the aborigines then. They had been almost
all improved off the face of the earth by other
marks of civilisation. Newspapers of the day


will prove whether it came at that time by
ship, and was arrested (as it was here some
years ago) by vigorous measures.”
VIII.— ON THE MURRAY RIVER AND ITS
TRIBUTARIES.
Mr. E. M. Curr, a well-known student of the
aborigines and their customs, at this stage of
the correspondence wrote an interesting letter
to the Argus. Speaking of the epidemic of
1789, he said : ££ In addition to Collins, Hunter,
Barrington, and Wentworth give more or less
full accounts of the horrors which occurred on
the occasion, and of how such of the blacks as
had not yet been stricken down fled to the
interior to escape the destroyer, bearing about
them inevitably the seeds of a wider destruc-
tion. With the flight of the survivors, however,
we lose for the time all traces of them and the
disease, our countrymen at the period not
having yet left the margin of Sydney Bay.
The immediate result to the whites, however,
of whom only one had succumbed,* was the
importation of vaccine matter from England.
££ The next record we have of smallpox,
though it was not recognised as such, was in
1829, when Sturt relates that the blacks on the
Darling, a tributary of the Murray, were suffer-
ing from what he terms a £ singular malady,
which showed itself in the form of a violent
eruption all over the body.’ Sir Thomas
Mitchell, however, who followed Sturt to the
Darling in 1835, recognised by its traces as
smallpox the disease which had puzzled Sturt
in its active form. Both authors agree, how-
ever, as to the great mortality which it had
occasioned among the tribes, as Mitchell says,
£ almost depopulating the Darling.’ In 1831
Sturt made his celebrated exploration of the
river Murray, and in his account of the trip
refers on several occasions to certain virulent
diseases from which the numerous tribes he
met were suffering. On one occasion he says
£ leprosy of the most loathsome description,
the most virulent cutaneous eruptions and
glandular affections, absolutely raged through
the whole of them.’ Row what was this
leprosy, this virulent cutaneous disease of
which no one has ever heard since ? Would
Sturt have known leprosy if he had seen it 'I
What has become of it 1 All that we know is
that ten years after Sturt’s gallant whaleboat
voyage, Eyre resided on the Lower Murray,
and recorded the facts that a £ disease very
*This is undoubtedly an error. A seaman on H.M.S. Supply died
of smallpox in 1789, but he was a North American Indian, not a
white man.—G. L. M.
similar to the smallpox, and leaving similar
marks upon the face, appears formerly to have
been very prevalent, but I have never met
with an existing case. . . . It is said to
have come from the eastward originally.’
Here we have a second instance of Sturt’s
failure to recognise smallpox, and of another
who came after him doing so. In confirmation
of Eyre’s statement we have also that of Taplin,
who, speaking of some of the Lower Murray
tribes, says : £ They have a tradition that some
sixty years ago a terrible disease came down
the Murray and carried off the natives by
hundreds. This must have been smallpox, as
many of the old people now have their faces
pitted, who suffered from the disease in child-
hood. The destruction of life was so great as
seriously to diminish the tribes.’ Hence we
see that in one direction at least, smallpox
found its way from sea to sea. That such was
the case I have never known anyone to gainsay,
except Mr. Rusden, who reiterates that at
that time smallpox did not exist on the Murray,
his argument being that had it existed, Sturt
and McLeay would not have allowed the
sufferers as they did, ‘to pull them about and
finger them all over.’ Setting aside an argu
ment which can have no force whatever until
it has been shown that Sturt was acquainted
with the appearance of smallpox, which there
is every reason to believe he was not, it may
be remarked that Mr. Rusden invites us to
believe that though the explorers £ would not
have endured such treatment ( i.e ., pulling
about and fingering) if smallpox had existed
among the natives,’ the explorers had no
objection to the friendly hug of mere leprous
savages, a peculiarity of taste which it is
strange to see extending to a whole party."
££ In conclusion, I beg to remark that towards
the close of 1841, or the beginning of 1842,
being then resident with one of my brothers
close to the junction of the Goulburn and
Murray, we saw a blackfellow absolutely suffer-
ing from smallpox. I need hardly add that a
large number of blacks in the neighbourhood
had faces pitted, furrowed and distorted with
smallpox. A few of these probably yet remain.
As regards £ native pock,’ unless a sort of
pustular itch from which both the blacks and
their dogs used to suffer, be indicated by the
term, I may frankly confess that I never saw
during my thirty-five years’ experience anything
among them to which I can suppose it to refer.”
There were several other letters published
»Dr. Ashburton Thompson (History of Leprosy in Australia.
1897), is of opinion that the “leprosy” mentioned by Sturt was
not true leprosy. He remarks (p. 25-26), “ I suppose the proba-
bility is that the writer had lepra vulgaris, or merely some repul-
sive disease of the skin, in mind.”


in the Melbourne Argus during January and
February, 1877, on this subject, but I think I
have quoted sufficient to prove that smallpox
was rife among the aborigines on the Murray
River between 1830 and 1840.
The blacks were undoubtedly familiar with
smallpox, as the following extracts from works
published about this time show
“ Darawirgal, a brother of Baiamai, lives in
the far west; it is he who lately sent the
smallpox among the natives for no better
reason than that he was vexed for want of a
tomahawk. ”*
“ Mali root, a native of Cook’s River, says,
‘ Dibble-dibble is all over smallpox like.’ ”f
IX.— SMALLPOX IN RECENT YEARS.
Smallpox seems to have entirely disappeared
from the Australian Continent between the
years 1840-1877. Contemporary literature does
not refer to the disease, so far as I am aware.
On December 12, 1876, a case of smallpox
was discovered on board the s s. Brisbane after
her arrival in the port of Sydney. The vessel
was immediately taken charge of by the police,
and as soon as possible removed to the Quaran-
tine Station at Spring Cove. The patient was
landed on December 13, and died the following
day. On the 18th December another case ap-
peared on the boat. This was landed and
isolated. All communication between the ship
and the shore had ceased on the vessel being
placed in quarantine. On the 30th of the
month a case of smallpox appeared in a house
on the wharf, almost immediately adjoining the
wharf where the s.s. Brisbane had been
berthed. The whole of the wharf, with all
the buildings upon it, and those in the imme-
diate neighbourhood, were immediately declared
to be in quarantine.
On January 10, 1877, two girls named
Holden, residing at Miller’s Point, near the
wharf where the Brisbane had berthed, showed
symptoms of the disease. All the occupants
of this house were removed to the hospical-
ship Faraway. These two gilds died, as did
two more members of the same family, who
were subsequently attacked.
During January, 1877, some cases of small-
pox appeared on board H.M.S. Wolverine and
Sappho. These were placed on board the
hospital-schooner Conflict. In speaking of
these cases, the Sydney Morning Herald of
January 25, 1877, said: “With regard to the
appearance of the disease on board the ships of

war, it is said the War Authorities have ob-
tained information which leads to the opinion
that the sailor first attacked on board the
W olverine had been in contact with the Holden
family at Miller’s Point. All the other seamen
who have got the disease are supposed to have
taken the contagion from this man There is,
however, another theory to account for the
sudden appearance of the disease. The Wol
verine left England with a clean bill of health,
but it is suggested that the disease may have
been conveyed by some of the shore clothing of
the men, packed by persons who were unfortu-
nately infected with smallpox. There is said
to be a well-authenticated case on record where
smallpox broke out on board an immigrant ship
after she arrived in port, and the boxes that had
been stowed in the hold were brought up and
unpacked. It is stated that the seeds of con-
tagion might remain dormant under such cir-
cumstances for several months, and then at
last break out.”
No further cases appear to have broken out,
and the epidemic was soon at an end.
On the 25th May, 1881, a child named On
Chong, living in Lower George-street, Sydney,
was reported to be suffering from smallpox.
The source of infection was obscure. The
house and premises were placed in strict
quarantine, and no further case was notified
for a period of twenty days, when the disease
appeared simultaneously in Surry Hills, Cum-
berland-street, Waterloo, and Circular Quay.
A second period of twenty days then elapsed
before the disease again showed itself, when
between July 5 and 15 it appeared in seven
houses, each situated in a different locality
From the middle of July, 1881, to the end of
January, 1882—a period of about 200 days
121 cases occurred in different parts of Sydney
and suburbs. Between May 25, and September
2, 1881, the disease occurred in the following
localities ; —Lower George-street, Surry Hills,
Cumberland-street, Waterloo, Queen’s-place,
Druitt Town, Glebe, Sussex-street, Fowler-
street, Macquarie-street South, Ultimo, Croy-
don, Woolloomooloo, Alexandria, Clarence-
street, Barker’s-lane, and Pyrmont. The dis-
ease principally attacked the labouring classes,
including two Chinamen. There were in all
during this epidemic no less than 154 cases of
variola. Of these 114 recovered, and 40 died.
In the year 1881, the Infectious Disease
Supervision Act (45 Victoria, No. 25) was
passed. Power was given to the Governor to
appoint a Board of Health, consisting of not
less than six persons, to carry out the provisions
of the Act The first Board was composed as
follows: —The Mayor of Sydney (Alderman

About this time the Sanatorium at Little Bay
was proclaimed a smallpox hospital, under the
charge of Dr. J. A. Beattie.
The Australasian Medical Gazette , January,
1882, reported that a case of smallpox had
occurred at Bega, 255 miles south of Sydney.
It was supposed that a relative of the patient,
only recently returned from Sydney, where
she had resided next to an infected house, had
carried the infection to the district.
In 1883 the disease again made its appear-
ance. The first case showed itself on August
23, and from that date to September 16 four-
teen cases were removed and isolated from time
to time. An interval of six weeks then ensued,
but on October 25 another case was reported.
An infant ten months old, in the same house,
then developed the disease on November 1.
The disease was not recognised, and in conse-
quence the other members of the family were
allowed to continue their usual occupations.
The result was as follows : —*• Two of the pa-
tient’s sisters and a brother attended the
Crown-street Public School, which is the largest
in the colony, during the whole of his illness,
ceasing their attendance only on the twentieth
day of it. These three children were in three
different classes, and in each class cases of
smallpox arose, namely, in one class two girls,
in another (infants) a girl and a boy, and in the
third one boy, were seized ; and in addition a
girl was attacked who was not in any of these
classes, but who was exposed to contact with
J. C.’s (the infant) sisters during play hours.
The adult members of J. C.’s family carried
the infection to five other households, a mem-
ber of one of which fell sick while at Moss
Yale, a hundred miles from Sydney, and there
infected the resident whom she was visiting.
Yet two other families were infected by this
child, but under slightly different circum-
stances ; one, residing at Leichhardt, was in-
fected through the father, who was summoned
to J. C.’s to pursue his trade in the very room
in which the latter lay sick; and two persons
fell ill in the house next door to J. C.’s. Thus
from this single case were infected no less than
thirteen distinct households, and nineteen dif-
ferent persons, of whom one died.”*
I believe that the cases enumerated above are
the only ones which have ever appeared within

the metropolis. Cases have entered the Heads
on shipboard at various times, but they have
been immediately quarantined at North Head,
and the disease did not gain a footing on shore.
X. —VACCINATION STATISTICS.
Among the Parliamentary Papers for 1868-
69 is to be found a despatch from the Duke of
Buckingham, Secretary of State for the Colo-
nies, transmitting the Imperial Vaccination
Act, 1867, and suggesting that it might seem
desirable that a like measure should be enacted
for New South Wales. For some reason this
suggestion has never been acted upon to the
present day, probably owing to the fact that
smallpox has never become a scourge in our
midst.
The following table shows the number of
births during thirty-six years from 1861 to
1896, and the number of vaccinations per-
formed by Government Vaccinators during the
same period :


There is reason to believe that the number
of vaccinations made by private practitioners
would not materially alter the above figures.
New South Wales is the only Australian
colony in which a Compulsory Vaccination Act
has never been put upon the Statute Book.
XI.— CONCLUSION.
In writing this short history of smallpox and
vaccination in New South Wales, I have di-
reeled attention chiefly to the early appearances
of the disease, and to the introduction of vacci-
nation. I have not attempted to write a com-
plete history, but if my articles have been the
means of creating an interest in the origin of
Australian diseases I shall feel that my work
has not been in vain.
Further information on the events of the past
fifteen or sixteen years is to be found in the
Annual Reports of the N.S.W. Board of
Health.
