ADELAIDE, SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
The Florishing Colony of South Australia is already a large Consumer of British Manufactured
Goods, and the exports from the Mother Country to that Colony are daily increasing.
A fine field is also there open for profitable Investment in Land, Sheep and Cattle Breeding,
and Copper and Lead Mining. The quality of the South Australian Wool is well known and
highly appreciated in England; its Wheat has been pronounced at Mark Lane equal to the best
British Samples; and its Copper and Lead Ores, which are found in vast Abundance, are scarcely
equalled by the Productions of the best British Mines. Fish Oils and Tallow are also Articles of
export from the Colony.
In offering himself as an Agent to the British Ship Owner, Merchant, and Manufacturer,
Mr. Hawkes pledges himself to Punctuality, Despatch, and lidelity. His I wenty Years Ex-
perience in Mercantile Business in England, may be a guarantee against Incompetency, and the
Testimonials he is prepared to furnish, will, he trusts, give him a Claim to the Confidence of
those who may favor him with their commands.
Letters Addressed
Will have Immediate Attention.
