A WEEK-END IN THE COUNTRY
Zooie’s Uncle had a farm in the
country not far from the city and just
before Christmas his father had to go
there for a week-end as Zooie’s Aunt
had been rather ill, and he wanted to see
her. Zooie was working hard for the
exams but his father thought that two
days in the country would make him
able to work all the harder when he got
back again, so he decided to take him
too.
Directly school was over on the
Friday, Zooie went straight to the
train where his father was waiting for
him.
Zooie’s Uncle met them at the
„ station m tne country and they drove out
to the farm. They got there just as
his cousin was starting to milk the
tows. Zooie quickly changed his clothes
and went out to help with the milking.
He liked milking very much and
although he was slow at first he soon
got used to it.
THE TAME MICE
“Bill,” that was his cousin’s name,
“ are there many nests about this year?
You have often told me about all the
nests there are up here, but I
never seem to come up during the
nesting season. This is the first time
I have been here at this time of the
year.”
“Nests? You just wait till the


morning, you’ll see more than you
have ever seen before. There are
sparrows’ nests in the Pine Trees,
Goldfinches in the fruit trees, Magpies
in the Gums, and Starlings under the
roof. Yes, and there is a Plover’s nest
in the paddock over there, among
those thistles. You know, just four
eggs laid on the bare ground. Gosh,
they’re hard to find too. It took me
over an hour to find them in the
first place.”
They went on milking and talking
about the various birds’ nests about
the place, when suddenly Zooie noticed
a little mouse come out of a hole and
drink some milk which had been spilt
on the ground.
“ What a bonza little chap, Bill,
is he tame?”
“Yes, fairly; he comes out every ,
day at milking time for a drink and
he doesn’t seem to be at all afraid.
There are two more too; they liv£
under that log in the yard.”
As he spoke, Zooie could see
two little heads peeping out from
under the log. First one came out
and scuttled across to the cow bails,
and then the other started to follow.
He hadn’t gone more than a- foot or
two, when ... . . Snap! .... down
came a Kookaburra, and as quick as
lightning, he caught the little mouse
in his powerful beak and flew off again.
“Gee, he was quick, wasn’t he?”
said Zooie
" Yes, he looks clumsy enough,
but when there’s a mouse to be had.
he doesn’t waste any time. Specially
now when there are young ones to
■feed ”
Are there really some young
Kookaburras near here. Bill?
“The nest is in that old dead
tree near the windmill, said Bill
pointing across the paddock, But
there aren’t any low branches, so I
have uot been able to get up to the
hollow limb where it is. Anyway Dad
doesn’t like me birdnesting, unless
it’s for the sparrows in the pine trees.”
“ Listen, Bill, if I give you my
dictionary, will you help me get up?”
“ Aw, no I don’t think so, Zooie.”
“But a dictionary is very good
for crossword puzzles; and I know a
very easy way to get up, too. Dad told
me about it.”
“ Are you sure you wouldn’t fall
down? There would be a terrible row
if anything happened.”
“ You just couldn’t fall down.
Anyway, I’ll do the climbing and then
you won’t be able to fall down.
“If it’s so easy I think we should
toss for who is to climb up first. Sssh,
here comes Uncle and Dad.”
“ Hullo Boys, how are you getting
along with the milking? You’ll be
a farmer one of these days, I suppose,
Zooie?” said Zooie’s Uncle.
“ I don’t know. Uncle, but I
would very much like to be,” Zooie
replied.


CLIMBING FOR
THE KOOKABURRA’S NEST
Next morning, the rest of the
family went to pay a visit to another
farm, as Zooie’s Aunt was better, so
Zooie and Bill got to work as soon
as they had gone. First they tied
long piece of string to a long piece
of rope. Then they tied a bolt to the
end of the string. They coiled it all
up and took it over to the dead tree
where the Kookaburra’s nest was.
They put the coil down, and Zooie
picked up the string with the bolt on
the end and swung it round and round.
Suddenly he let go and the bolt went
sailing up over the limb where the
nest was, and landed on the ground at
the other side. Zooie pulled the string
till the rope came down and then tied
the rope to a little broken-off branch
near the ground
“ There you are Bill, that was
easy, wasn’t it?”
“Yes, it was easy enough all right,
but it doesn’t look very safe to me.”
“You just wait and see,” said
Zooie, and. he started to shin up the
rope to the nest. He had almost
reached the branch, when . . . crack . . .
the branch was breaking. Bill called
out, but Zooie was too scared to think
what to do, and before he knew where
he was, he had landed with a thud on
the ground. He was quite winded by
his fall, and didn’t even have enough
breath to call out. He felt as if every
bone in his body was broken


“ Oh Gee! what will Dad say
now?”
“ I don’t know what your Dad
will say but I know what mine will
do ,” said Bill.
Just then a man who had been
ploughing in the next paddock came
running over to see if Zooie had
hurt himself.
“ Did you hurt yourself, Sonny?”
said the man.
“ No, I don’t think I did very
much, although I feel very sore all
over.”
“ Bill, you’re a stupid little fool,
he might have broken his neck and
then where would you be? You
ought to have had more sense than to let
him do a thing like that. You wait
till your Pa comes home—you’ll be
sorry for yourself tonight, young
man.
“ I thought it was a bit dangerous,
but I did want that dictionary all the
same ; and now I’ll have to wait till
tea time, when I’ll get a hiding. Dad
always waits till after milking time as I
have got to sit down to milk,” said Bill
with a very sad face indeed.
The man went back to his plough
and Bill and Zooie went back to the
house without saying a word ; they
were too busy thinking what they
would say to their fathers when they
came home again.
When they had started milking
again that evening, the family arrived
home again.
“ Well Bill, have you and Zooie
been behaving yourselves to-day and not
getting up to any mischief?” said
Zooie’s Uncle.
“ Oh, yes Dad, we’ve been working
most of the day.”


“ Hullo, what’s different about that
old tree over there where the
Kookaburra’s nest is? I think that
there is a branch off. You haven t
been climbing up there have you Bill?”
“ Well, Dad we thought it
wouldn’t matter ...”
“ Ho! you did did you, after all I
told you about going after protected
bird’s nests. I’ll talk to you after
tea.”' And Bill’s father went off to
feed the pigs and ducks before it got
dark.
“ I wish you hadn’t got that
horrid old dictionary, Zooie,” said
Bill in a very miserable voice.
That night after tea, both the
boys were heard crying very hard and
they were sent to bed to think over
what they had done.
ZOOIE IS TOLD ALL ABOUT
KOOKABURRAS.
“Dad, what does ‘protection’ mean?
Uncle said that Kookaburras were
protected yesterday; who protects
them?” asked Zooie the next day at
dinner,
“ It means that they are protected
by law. If you kill one or take an egg,
a policeman can come along and take
you to gaol. Although you might not
be put in prison actually, you would
have to pay a lot of money for having
broken the law. You are not allowed
to even keep them for pets unless
the police are quite satisfied that you
know how to look after them properly
and have a nice big garden for them to
roam about.”
“ But why aren’t people allowed
to kill them when they kill pretty little
mice and baby birds; I’ve seen them
taking young sparrows from nests
myself.”
“ Yes, they do eat a few young
birds and they are very fond of mice.
But the good they do in eating such things
as grubs, beetles, snakes, grasshoppers,
caterpillars and other insects, is far greater
than the damage they do in eating birds.
There is nothing wrong in them eating
mice, because mice do so much harm
to the grain and other food on the
farm. They sometimes go into the
kitchen, too, and eat anything they
can find, such as sugar, bread and cheese.
I once kept a young Kookaburra just
to see what its parents brought it to
eat every day. The nest was just near
the house, and both the mother and the
father bird came along to feed it every
half hour or so, right through the day.
I thought that I had found all the
insects and things that there were to
be found near the house ; but when I
had that young Kookaburra, I learnt
that I had really hardly found any at all.
The parents seemed to bring something
different every time they came. They
brought huge caterpillars, the biggest
grasshoppers I had ever seen and several
of those funny looking stick insects too.
How they managed to find so much for
the young bird rather puzzled me, so

I sat and watched the old birds at work.
They would perch in a tree and sit
there, apparently not looking anywhere
in particular, just admiring the
view. Suddenly, one would cock its
head on one side, and then dive down
towards the ground. It would pick
up a lizard and then with a few
chuckles fly straight off to little Ooky
as we called the baby bird. They just
sit and watch for some movement with
their sharp eyes and then pounce on
whatever is moving. They don’t have
to wait long before there is an insect
or something wandering about searching
for food.”
“ How many eggs do the Kooka-
burras lay. Dad?” asked Zooie.
“Either three or four. You hav’nt
seen them have you, Zooie* They are
almost round and quite white. The
nest is usually a hollow tree or branch ;
I have seen them nesting in white ants 5
homes in Queensland. They drill a
hole in the side of these ants’ nests.
Not the white ants which make those
mounds on the ground, but ones which
make funny looking big lumps high
up in the trees on the side of the
trunk.”
“ One thing I like about Kooka-
burras,” said Zooie, “ is that they always
seem ready to laugh at something.”
“If we were all as happy as the
Kookaburras at dawn and evening,”
said his Dad, “ what a happy world it
would be, wouldn’t it?”

Like most boys, Zooie always
looked forward to his holidays.
Whether he was going away with the
family or going to his Uncle’s farm
on his own, there were always new
adventures for him. Life was never
dull at holiday time. Another of
Zooie’s Uncles had a big sheep station
a long way away in the country. Zooie
had always been longing to go there
for years. However, one day his Uncle
and Aunt were going up to the station
by car and took Zooie with them.
CATCHING THE BIG SNAKE
They left very early in the
morning and soon were right out in
the country. After they had been
travelling for a long time the driver
suddenly stopped the car with a
screech of brakes and jolt.
“ What are you stopping for? ”
Zooie’s Uncle asked the driver.
“Didn’t you see that snake, Sir? It
was no ordinary one; it was quite
the biggest one I have ever seen. ”
“Why do you want to stop to
look at a horrid snake? Surely there
are enough of the brutes about
without stopping to look at one,”
said Zooie’s Aunt, who didn’t like
snakes at all.


“Oh, yes, Madam, but this one
is really a very big one. It has
beautiful markings on its back, too.
I haven’t seen one like it before.”
They went back a little way,
and there was the great big snake
lying stretched out on the grass
beside the road.
The driver jumped out and
picked up a stick to kill it with,
but Zooie’s Uncle stopped him.
“No, don’t kill it; what a
beauty! It’s only a carpet snake and
they can’t do any harm at all. He
lives on rabbits mainly and of
course does a great deal of good.
The safest thing, of course, is always
to kill first and ask questions
afterwards but we won’t kill this
chap.”
• “Is that the same snake that
they keep in country stores to kill
rats and mice, Sir?”
“ Yes, this is the same kind of
snake. I suppose he will only be
killed if we leave him here; get a
bag and we’ll put him in the box
at the back of the car and take
him along with us. He’ll be useful
in the store on the station.”
So the snake was brought along
with them.
During the day they saw all
kinds of birds and animals galore;
there were kangaroos, emus, koalas,
parrots, cockatoos and just a glimpse
of a lyre bird as it ran across the
road in front of the car.


OUT WITH THE KANGAROOS
“Zooie, I’m going to send you
out with Jack Dobson, to-day. He’s
one of the stockmen here and is
%
going to fix up a windmill some miles
away from the homestead. I suppose
you can ride alright ?”
“ Oh, yes, Uncle, I often ride
at home.”
“ Right, the cook will give
you some lunch; hurry up and get
ready.”
“Thank you ever so much.
Uncle ...” said Zooie.
“Alright Laddie, hop it now!
Old Jack doesn’t like to be kept
waiting when there is a job to do.”
Zooie “ hopped it ” and soon
he was cantering along a track
through a big paddock with Jack
Dobson.
“Do you like the country,
Laddie,” asked Jack.
“I should say I do,” said
Zooie. “ I always spend my school
holidays either in the country or at
the seaside.”
“Ever seen a wild kangaroo?”
Jack asked.
“ Only on the way up here
yesterday. Of course there are plenty
in the zoo but they are not really
wild,” said Zooie.
“ Well, you will see more in one
mob to-day than you have ever seen
before.”
They cantered on through two
more big paddocks and then came to
a small hill.


“This is One Tree Hill; you
see, there is only one tree on it,”
said Jack. “Keep your eyes skinned
when you get to the top, and tell me
what you see.”
Zooie went on ahead and
stopped his horse on the top, and
looked across at the miles and miles
of rolling grass paddocks, with a few
gum trees here and there.
“ I can’t see anything much,
Jack,” called Zooie, “only a lot of
sheep.”
“ Sheep be blowed, look again,”
said Jack in a very disgusted voice.
“ Gee, there is a kangaroo.
they’re nearly all kangaroos! Gosh, I
didn’t think there were so many.
There must be thousands and thousands
over there.”
“ There were about six thousand
on the station last year, but since
then there have been many babies and
now there will be a good many more
than six thousand altogether.”
They started off again towards
the windmill which they could see in
the distance in a clump of gum trees.
So as not to disturb the kangaroos
Jack and Zooie went along the dry
bed of a creek, where they were
hidden from the animals by the high
banks. They went on riding for a
long time and eventually came to a
large dam. There were water lilies
and rushes all round the edges and as
they came closer hundreds of ducks
and other water birds flew up with a
great commotion. In the gum trees by
the water’s edge there was a heronry,
the place where the herons nest, and
there were numbers of their great big
untidy stick nests on the branches.
Zooie was sitting on his horse gazing
at all the interesting things about him
when Jack called out to him.
“Here, don’t go to sleep, Zooie.
Unsaddle the horses and put them in
the paddock where the dam is;
there is some good feed in there
and they can’t get away. Then ' get
your quart pot and we’ll have
some lunch before I start on the
mill.”
After lunch Zooie started off
on a ramble round the dam. When
he got to the other side he came
to a place where the water just
came out under the fence. He
was looking at a duck’s nest
under a tussock of grass, when
all of a sudden he heard plomp,
plomp, plomp, not far away. He
thought that it sounded rather a
funny noise and looked up to
see what it was. He saw three
kangaroos hopping along on their
way down for a drink.


THE INQUISITIVE LITTLE
JOEY
Zooie saw that there was no
other water near so he thought
that he would stay still and see
if they would drink at the water
just beside him. The animals came
hopping along, stopping every now
and then and looking round to
see if anyone was coming. Then
they came to the waters’ edge
right beside Zooie. He was thrilled!
They sniffed at his legs but did
not seem to think that he was
likely to hurt them at all. They
had never been so near to a
human being before. Zooie stood
quite still and watched them. He
hardly dared to breathe in case
they became frightened and hopped
away. There were three mother
kangaroos and all had little joeys
peeping out of their pouches looking
round to see what was going on.
The one nearest Zooie thought
he would have a closer look at
him, so he leaned right out and
scratched his trousers with his little
paws. Zooie would have given the
world to pat his head but fte
didn’t want to move in case he
frightened them all. When they
had finished their drink they hopped
away again and Zooie walked
straight back to the windmill to
tell Jack Dobson of his experience.
“What do you think. Jack?”
said Zooie.
“You mean the kangaroos?
Yes, I was watching you from
up here on the mill. I could
just see you through the trees.
Do you know I’ve lived in the
bush for nearly fifty years and
that has only happened to me
once; and here you are, green
from the city, and it happens to
you the very first day. Beats
me how you do it. Bless my
soul, it does!” said Jack as he
screwed up a bolt.
“ Well, you see, my Dad is
a naturalist and I cant help but
like animals and birds, too,” Zooie
called back to him.
“Oh, he’s a naturalist, is he?
I suppose he doesn’t believe that
the baby kangaroo is born in
the pouch.”
“No,” said Zooie, “it is
born like any other animal and
.is put into the pouch by its
mother directly it is born.”
Old Jack didn’t think that
city boys knew anything at all
about the country.
“Well,” said he, “I’ve shot
thousands of ’roos, and nothing
will make me believe it naturalist
or not.”


“If you just sat down and
watched them instead of shooting
them you learn that for yourself,
I think, Jack,” said Zooie.
“ I’m afraid that I haven’t
much time to be sitting round
watching blinking ’roos.”
“ Why do you shoot them,
Jack?”
“Well you see the dam now,
fall of water. If there is a drought
this summer it might go dry and
when the water is low all these
kangaroos make a lot of difference.
We live on sheep here and when
water and feed gets scarce one or
the other has to go. The sheep means
money to the country, so we kill
the kangaroos which are not worth
anything at all. But we only kill
off a few each year. You go and
have a look at those birds nest in
case we don’t come down here
again. I’ll be another half hour yet;
I’ll give you a call when I’m
ready.”
So Zooie went off rambling
again but he did not see any
more kangaroos as close again.
However he was quite satisfied.
He knew how interested his
father would be when he told
him about it, on his return home.
He also learnt that he could
see very much more of animals
by standing quite still than he
could by walking about all over
the place quickly. Even a broken
twig soon tells the wild things
that they must be on their guard,
and then very often a movement
will send them running away as
fast •as they can.

YTA Camp Among The Koalas
“Dad, where are we going for
our next holidays? I suppose as it will
be in the summer time we’ll be
going to the seaside again won’t we?”
“Yes Zooie, but this year we’re
not going to just take a house by
the sea like we did last year. Oh
no, something far more interesting
than that. I think we have stayed
at most of the seaside places near
by, so we’re going a little farther
afield this time. Along the coast a
little way there is another big bay
which you have not seen yet. It’s
called Westernport Bay and in it
there is a small island thickly covered
with trees and with only one little
cottage on it. This cottage is so
small that \ve will have to take tents
with us as well, so it will be more
of a camp than anything else.”
“Oooh, how lovely! We haven’t
camped near the sea before, have
we?
The weeks seemed to drag by,
but at last the exams were over
and after speech day, everybody
started to pack all the things that
were to be taken away for the holidays.
Zooie got all his tins and little
boxes together and a butterfly net
too, and not forgetting his fishing
rod. Whenever he went away to
the country or the seaside he always
took all manner of tins and boxes
with him as he collected so many
butterflies, moths and other insects.
When everything was packed up
Zooie, with his father and mother,
his two brothers and three sisters, set
off for the holiday on the island-
LEAVING FOR THE HOLIDAY
It was a hot, clear morning as
they drove along the road just near
the water’s edge.
In about two hours they arrived
at a long narrow pier which ran out
into Westernport Bay. The water wa s
too shalloV near the shore for big
steamers, so this jetty had to be
built right out to where the water
was deep enough for them.
All their trunks were loaded on
to a truck drawn by a pretty little
pony, and soon they were at the
end of the pier waiting for the
launch which was to take them across
the water to the island.
“What are all those little black
specks on the water over there,
< Daddy?”
“ What do you think they are,
Zooie? You look through the
telescope and see if you can find
out what they are.”


SWANS BY THE HUNDRED
“Gee, Dad, they’re not all black
swans are they? There must be
hundreds and hundreds of them there.
We’ve never seen as many as that
in the Zoo have we? Not all at
once anyway .... And there are
some pelicans too! Don’t they look
funny, awkward birds beside the
swans?”
“ Here comes the launch Zooie,
so we had better put the telescope
away for the present in case it falls
into the water.”
There was the launch coming
up to the jetty. It was like a
great big rowing boat with a
mast and sail as well as an
engine to drive it along through
the water. There was a funny
looking old fisherman in it with
a stubbly beard and an old grey
.cap.
It took some time to pack
everything in the boat and Zooie
dropped his butterfly net in the
water in the excitement. It was
fished out with a long pole
after a while and /at last they
got away and the boat chug chugged
along across the smooth water towards
the island which they could just see
in the distance.
ON THE WATER AT LAST
“ What is this island called.
Daddy?”
“It’s called Chinaman Island.
It certainly is rather a funny
name to give it but there lived
an old Chinaman there for many
years and I suppose it was the
natural thing to do to call it
after him.”
The first things Zooie saw
on the big trees on the island
as they got closer to them
were several lumps high up in
the branches, like the nests made
by white ants, from the distance.
He didn’t know what they were
at first but as they came closer
he saw that they were not white
ants’ nests but were Koalas, the
dear little teddy bears.
“Look at the Koalas,” said
Zooie and they all stopped talking
and looked at the beautiful little
balls of fluff high up in the trees.
In another minute or two the
boat was pulled a little way up on
the beach and then all the luggage
had to be carried up to the cottage
a few yards from the beach. It was
a very old place and was built of
logs with a wide verandah and a
tin roof.
LANDING ON CHINAMAN
ISLAND
As soon as everything had been
taken out of the boat and up to
the house, the first thing to be done
was to put up the tent, but as
Zooie was told that he would be in


the way he joyfully went off to
explore the island.
The bushes were very thick and
there were only three tracks leading
away from the house. Two of them
lead to beaches on the other side of
the island and the other to a rocky
point where the old Chinaman used
to fish. It was all very thrilling
and Zooie felt like Robinson Crusoe
on his island, but he had not gone
far before he was called back for
dinner. After dinner he went off with
his father along another track while
the rest of the family went out fishing
in a boat which had been lying on
the beach near the house.
“Why are there so many Koalas
here and none at the places we have
been to in the country, Dad?” asked
Zooie.
TRAGEDY IN KOALALAND
“ There are not many left near
the city and for that matter there
are not many left anywhere. Years
ago when I was a boy there was
a dreadful disease among the Koalas
and thousands and thousands died.
They got a germ in their lungs and
couldn’t breathe, so of course died.”
“It was a sad thing for all those
pretty little animals to die but that
sort of thing often happens in Nature.
Sometimes there will be a plague of
mice, millions and millions of them
will travel over the countryside eating
everything they can find, when all
of a sudden a disease will come
along and they all die in no time.
Although there was not a plague of
Koalas there were many of them to
be found quite near the city. Then
the few that were left were shot.”
“What did they want to shoot
such nice little things as Koalas for.
Daddy?”
“Well you see, Zooie, the skins
of these animals are very thick and
tough, much better than any other
skins, and they were worth quite a
lot of money then too; but that’s a
long time ago and as soon as it was
seen that they were becoming rare
they were protected by the government
and after that anyone who was caught
killing them was put in prison, and
that is still the case. However there
are still some cowards about who
will shoot these harmless little animals
just for fun, so that is why they
have been sent down to this island.
They are quite safe and no one
dares to come and shoot them here
because they will be caught.”
“Wouldn’t they be hard to kill
with all that thick fur on them, Daddy?”
asked Zooie.
MORE CRACK THAN SHOT
“Yes, years ago when I had to
collect some for the museum I found
that they were very hard indeed to
kill. When they are high up in the
trees the shot simply bounces off the
fur and they look round to see where
all the noise is coming from and are


not the least afraid. I remember once
when I was camping out with some
other men years ago, I heard a great
deal of shooting going on a short
distance from the camp and went over
to see what it was all about.
“Up on the top of the hill, was a
tremendous gum tree and right up in
the highest fork of the tree was a big
Koala; on the ground below was a
pile of nearly two dozen empty cart
ridges! One of the other campers
had been trying to shoot the poor
old bear but he was still quite happy
and none the worse for being shot at.
I didn’t ask this chap about the shoot-
ing and he was much too ashamed of
himself to say anything either.
Zooie and his father walked along
among the thickly growing bushes
with the sun trickling through the
branches of the gum trees above.
There were Koalas everywhere and they
seemed to be in every second tree on
the island. There weren’t quite as many
as all that but still there were about
a ’ hundred altogether on the island.
As it was now the middle of the
afternoon they had not started to wake
up and were curled up in forks of the
trees asleep like most of the other
Australian animals
MOTHER AND BABY WAKE UP
Later, when the sun was setting,
Zooie watched one mother Koala with
a baby one curled up in her arms in
a tree just beside the house.


Before long she slowly woke up
and after looking round with her soft
baby like eyes she started slowly and
awkwardly to make her way up to the
top of the tree. As soon as she started
to move the baby one climbed round
on to her back. Up the trunk she
went with her baby to get the tender
young shoots at the tips of the branches
She didn’t climb up like we would
one arm after another, but using her
long sharp claws to grip the wood
with, she jumped upwards a few inches
at a time till she came to a branch
where she could lean out and pull the
gum tips towards her to eat them.
They won’t just eat any kind of
gum tips either but must have exactly
the right kind and there are only two or
three kinds which they will eat. That
is partly why they are seldom seen in
the zoo. It is so hard to get the right
gum tree leaves for them to eat.
Zooie and his father walked all
over the island that afternoon and
collected several pockets full of shells,
mainly cowries, which they found on
the beaches.
WHEN THE BABY CRIED
After tea they were all sitting out
on the verandah in the moonlight
talking when suddenly they heard what
sounded like a baby crying. There were
no other people on the island and
they were wondering what it could
be when Zooie’s father said that it
probably was a baby Koala, They all
went to where the noise had come
from and there in a small tree was a
mother and her baby on her back.
They shook the tree and the baby bear
cried again just like a baby.
SNAKES ABOUT
It was a warm night and although
the island was a long way out in the
bay there were quite a number of snakes
there and Zooie had seen several during
the afternoon. Because of this, Zooie’s
father had made him wear thick socks
when he was walking in the bush on
the island. Nearly all the Australian
poisonous snakes have a little groove
running down the side of their fangs for
the poison, while the cobras and rattle-
snakes of other countries have hollow
fangs for the poison to run through.
The fangs as you know are the big teeth
which the snakes catch their prey with,
and not the forked tongue which is so
often called the fang. The reason for
his wearing thick woollen socks was
that if he was bitten the poison would
be all soaked up by the sock before
it reached his skin.
ZOOIE BITTEN BY A SNAKE
And jolly good thing it was too,
because while they were all looking up
at the bears, Zooie felt a-prick in his leg
and when he looked down he saw a snake
glistening in the moonlight. He jumped
almost before he had looked down and
let out a yell. The others ran over
to him and one of his brothers quickly


killed the snake with a stick he was
carrying. His father struck a match
and sure enough there were two
little red spots on his leg, so he took
out his pocket knife and cut the skin
across the place where the spots were
to make it bleed. It hurt but Zooie
knew that it was the only thing to
do so he bore the pain like a Trojan.
His father then tied a handkerchief
round his thigh just above jfte knee,
just as tight as it would go, and
another just round his ankle below the
place where the snake had bitten him.
Then his leg was squeezed where it
had been cut and his father put some
dark gritty stuff called Conde’s Crystals
on it; he always carried some round
in his pocket in case of snakebite.
“A CARELESS LITTLE FOOL’’
Zooie was then taken back to the
house and put straight to bed. He
felt quite all right but his father thought
it was the safest thing to do. He felt
quite a hero with all the family look-
ing after him. His brother called him
a careless little fool but he didn’t mind;
he was always a little fool in his
brother’s eyes.
ZOOIE GETS A BIG SURPRISE
He was not allowed to get up for
breakfast next morning much to his
disappointment. He was lying there
feeling very miserable when his two
brothers came in. After they had been
so unkind to him telling him that he
should have been more careful, he
wasn’t very pleased with them.
However they had a big surprise for
him and what do you think they had
brought for him? Nothing more nor
less than a baby teddy bear. What a
thrill for him! He soon forgot that
he was in bed and while he had this


dear little bear to play with in bed he
didn’t want to get up at all. The
little Koala looked at Zooie with its
big eyes and seemed quite satisfied
that he was not going to be hurt.
He snuggled up close to Zooie as if
to get away from his brothers who
had • taken him away from his mother.
Zooie was allowed to get up in the
afternoon, but he was quite satisfied
to stay at home with his new pet.
Gum leaves were brought in for him
to eat and he was given some bread
and milk. Zooie was very excited to
think that he had a real live teddy
bear at last. He had always wanted
to have one like every other little boy,
but only a few ever do actually have one
for a pet. He thought that he could
keep it and take it home with him
when the holiday was over. When
he asked his father if it would be
all right fo-r him to keep it he was
told that the little animal would not
live for more than a few weeks if he
took it home, he was terribly disap-
pointed and asked if he couldn’t just feed
it on bread and milk instead of the
gum leaves. But his Dad said that he
would get sick and soon die if he did
not have the proper gum leaves he
was used to eating on the trees on
the island.
“ Dad, how do the teddy bears get
on when there isn’t any rain for a
long time and there’s a drought in
the country where they live? ”
“You needn’t worry about that,
Zooie, they very seldom drink at all and
only once have I seen one near water
on a hot day. That was up in Queens-
land and I saw one swimming in a
dam. But there isn’t any water on
this island and they seem to be living
quite well without it so I don’t think
that they need it very much. They


get the water they need from the juice
in the gum tips; you know how the
shiny little leaves at the ends of the
branches are soft and juicy, look here.”
and he pulled down a branch to
show Zooie what he meant and squeezed
out the juice between his fingers.
“Are all the koalas the same
Daddy, or are there other kinds as
well as these ones on this island?”
“No they are not all the same,
that is, there is one kind found
in Southern Australia and another kind
living in Queensland. He is a little
bit smaller than these and is a different
colour too, and his fur is not so
long and thick. Instead of being grey
it is a sandy colour like those big
Red Kangaroos at the Zoo.’
“Is the baby Koala born just like
other animals Dad, or put in a pouch
first like the baby kangaroo ? ” asked
Zooie.
“ It is born in just the same way as
the little Joey Kangaroo and spends
the first few months of its life in its
mother’s pouch and I hope that you
will be able to see one before we leave
the island to go home, but I think
that it is rather too late to see any
babies in their mothers 5 pouches as at
this time of the year the babies are
nearly grown up. They look far
prettier than baby kangaroos when
they peep out of the pouch, although
when they’re very young they look
almost the same as the Jbeys. Tiny
little pink things about the size of a
mouse, without any hair on them at
all”
“They have a funny smell too
haven’t they ? A little bit like the
possums which live under the roof at
home.”
His dad laughed when he said this
and Zooie laughed too, although he
couldn’t see anything very funny m
what he had said.
SMELLING OUT BEARS
“Once, when I was jackerooing in
Queensland, I thought I could smell the
Koalas and as I knew just what they
smelt like I started to look for the
animals among the gnm trees; but there
were a great many trees about and I
could not find the, Koalas. The other
men I was with were very amused
about this and always laughed when
I mentioned that I could smell a bear.
Numbers of times this happened but I
didn’t find even one bear —except when
I was out looking—specially looking
for them, by myself. However there
were hundreds of big trees everywhere
and they. are the hardest things to see
even when you are looking for them.
Sometimes when the smell came along
the wind from a place where
there were only two or three trees it
would take me a quarter of an hour
to find the animal.”
KOALAS SOMETIMES
FALL DOWN
“Sometimes I knew there was a
Koala in the tree, by the scratches on


the bark, they made with their claws
while they were climbing up the' tree.
Once or twice in the evening, when
we were returning to the homestead
with some cattle we saw a Koala
tumble down from high up in the
tree. Although they are very good
at tree climbing they do sometimes
slip and fall off. But it didn’t matter
how high they were from the ground
when they fell they always got up
and slowly walked away and climbed
up the tree again. They say that a
tomcat has nine lives but I think the
Koala has a good many more than that
by the way they fall from great heights
without being hurt at all.”
KOALAS IN THE ZOO.
“Daddy, there are some Koalas
in the Zoo aren’t there? ”
“ Yes, there are usually some there,
Zooie.”
“Well, how do they keep them
when I couldn’t have one myself?”
“Ah, that’s very different. But
even in the Zoo they don’t live very
long. In Taronga Park, at Sydney,
there are a great many trees which
have been specially planted for the
bears, and till they grow big, a man
has to be sent out to the country
every day, on a bicycle, to get the gum
leaves for them to eat. The same thing
happens at Koala Park where there are a
whole lot of Koalas kept for people to
look at.”
LUCKY AUSTRALIAN
BOYS AND GIRLS.
“Do you know, I think that
you and all the other Australian boys
and girls are very lucky to be able to
see these beautiful little animals at all. It
is only very seldom that they reach other
lands alive. They don’t live through
the long journey overseas.”
As the day wore on and the sun
began to go down the pet baby bear
began to wriggle and kick and didn t
seem at all happy; he wanted to get
back to his mother again. And then
Zooie’s brothers came in and asked him
if he would like to come with them
when they went fishing off the rocks at
the other side of the island.
That was the end of the little
Koala. Zooie felt sorry for the poor
little chap then, and took it back to
the tree. He went straight back to
his mother and cuddled up in her
arms again. He was glad to be back
again. And then Zooie got out his
fishing rod, ready to go off fishing
directly after tea ; that was something
he wouldn’t miss for worlds.
