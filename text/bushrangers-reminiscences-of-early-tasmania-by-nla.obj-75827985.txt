It was at Bothwell on 20th
** " May, 1869, that Cluny, our
* homestead, was (to use a Colonial ex-
pression) ?stuck up? by three men, Wingy,
|lp|| Flowers, and Sydney Jim. They ar-

and they knew it, and as there were no neigh-
jfi- bours within five miles they felt that no in-
formation could reach the Police Station for
many hours. Later we discovered that our shep-
herd, a man named Burdett, was in league with
them and was keeping watch on the road.
The district had been in a state of alarm for
several months, since it became known that these

vou could hardly conceive a more brutal counten-
ance, the face of a man capable, I should think, of

from Ft. Arthur, was working for two years at Shan-
non, for Mr. Howells, of Southernfield, when he
was recognised by another ex-prisoner. The man
at once reported him at headquarters, and they
immediately sent out the police to arrest him. He
was working at an out station, and one of his friends
sent word to him, and at once he bolted, inducing
two men who were fencing with him to join him.
1 believe that they suffered great hardships, hav-
ing to hide in caves and hollow trees. A month
later they reached Evendale, near Launceston, and
there they broke into a store and got all the sup-
plies they wanted in the way of firearms and cloth-
ing, and then they started their career as bushrang-
ers. Sydney Jim?s greatest wish was to track down
the man who had informed against him and shoot


and one of his reasons for venturing so close^
I to the township' was that he had heard that this u
| man Smith was working at Cluny. So he had been, fj
J but he had thought it wiser to put a few miles be- If
I tween himself and Sydney Jim, so he departed with- ||
If out leaving any trace of his whereabouts. I cer- I]
I tainly should not have liked to have been in Smith's ||
il place, for Sydney Jim was a man over six feet in li
F height, and large in proportion, with a strong, de- II
/Ml termined face, and black flashing eyes. I should n
SI think that he had been a handsome man in his H
Ilf younger days. The moment I looked at him I ||
Jll thought of the description of a brigand that one li
II read of in the olden days. To add to his formidable il
il appearance, he had a soft black felt hat pulled down II
li over his face, a long black overcoat with a broad M
il leather belt, a ring of revolvers round his waist, HI
11 and a double barrelled gun in his hand. Just be- II
II fore he left the house my husband recognised him IV
U and asked him why he had taken to the bush, and Hi
he replied that he had suffered so much from pun- W
if ishment at Port Arthur that he was determined Mj
fl never to be taken back there. My husband said; ?
'I ?But you must know that the gallows are staring I
I you in the face/? and he replied: ?Never! They I
I shall never take me alive," and he kept his word, I
J for when they finally captured him he resisted so I
I furiously that they had to shoot him. I
H After several false alarms about bushrangers our I
II fears had begun to quieten down, when suddenly
HI we got a rude shock. It was about seven o'clock in jl
11 the evening, my husband had just returned from *
II Bothwell and was sitting by the fire nursing* the
III baby, and I was standing beside him when we heard JA
||i a terrific noise of running feet, and a girl friend, Miss tMjl
m) Ibbott, of Ibbott Vale, rushed into the room and

him, and one of his reasons for venturing so close

Vbout a fortnight before, Mr. Synott, of the Her-

during the evening I was sent to

I strong desire to get information to the police. My 11
I idea was that if I could get over to the shepherds' If

IK ly two and six years, and was occupied putting the II

(u they left they took away as much plunder as eleven U
