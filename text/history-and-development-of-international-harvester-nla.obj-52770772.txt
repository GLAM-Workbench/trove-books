HISTORY AND DEVELOPMENT OF
INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER
INTRODUCTION
The annals of American business reveal a no
more colorful nor inspiring story than that of
the growth and development of International
Harvester. Although in its present form it has
been in existence only since 1902, the Company’s
antecedent history reaches back to 1831, when
Cyrus Hall McCormick demonstrated his first
reaper to a skeptical gathering at his father’s farm
near Steele’s Tavern, Virginia. Few corporations
of similar size and importance can lay claim to
such a background of tradition and continuous
operation.
The farm equipment industry, exemplified by
the Harvester Company, is a distinctively Ameri-
can enterprise. It is doubtful that its phenomenal
growth and development over the past century
could have been nurtured in any but the vigorous,
pioneering soil of the United States. The
Company has grown with the nation and helped
the nation grow. Certainly it could have reached
its present stage only under the peculiarly
American system of free enterprise. It is equally
obvious that our present industrial civilization
would have arrived much more slowly without the
invention and perfection of farm machinery. This
identification with history is possible only in a
business with a background of tradition and
service in complete accord with that of the nation
in which it was founded.
The Company can also point with pride to a
record of continuity in management seldom
equalled in the history of American business.
Cyrus Hall McCormick was president of the
McCormick Harvesting Machine Company until
his death in 1884. Chairman of the board today
is Fowler McCormick, his grandson. Through-
out its history, McCormicks have headed the
Company, with the exception of a few intervening
years when other men who had come up through
the ranks in the Harvester organization Alex-
ander Legge, Herbert F. Perkins, Addis E,
McKinstry and Sydney G. McAllister carried
on the founder’s tradition. Thus, the spirit which
dominates the actions of the Company today
had its beginning 115 years ago.
Many of the fundamental concepts initiated
by the inventor of the reaper—absolute honesty
in all dealings, the building of a quality product at
prices his customers could afford to pay, and a
safeguarding of that product with service that
protects the customer are still the living roots
of Harvester policy. Today’s Harvester spirit is
based on McCormick’s fighting determination to
progress in his field and build machines which
would best serve the customer and the nation.
BREAKING THE BOTTLENECK
The invention of the reaper broke a bottleneck
on the highway of progress. As much as any
other single factor, it was responsible for the
conversion of the United States from an almost
purely agrarian nation in 1830 to its present
position as the world’s greatest industrial power.
By releasing manpower from the soil to be
deployed into other channels of activity, Cyrus
Hall McCormick applied a spur to an industrial
revolution in America which led to the greatest
era of invention and mechanical progress the
world had ever known.
In order to understand fully the implications
of the reaper, it is necessary to examine briefly the
conditions under which the farmer of 1830 oper-
ated. Then, as now, the search for food was man’s
first consideration. Until that search was success-
ful, he had no time for any other activity. Only
such time as was left over after he had produced
enough food to satisfy his hunger could he devote
to other occupations. In the centuries preceding
1831, 95 percent of the population of the world
was forced by the need for food and shelter to
work on the land.
Until the invention of the reaper, advances in
farming methods were so slow as to be almost
imperceptible. In spite of its status as humanity’s
basic industry, agriculture failed to progress or
even to undergo much study in ancient times. It
was still a laborious, unrewarding pursuit in
1830 —one offering little promise of leisure or
security to anyone engaged in it. The farmer was
completely at the mercy of the soil and the
elements. If circumstances caused him to fail to
produce, he and his fellow men were confronted
with the spectre of famine. It was an economy of
scarcity, a world in which the overwhelming


majority of the population toiled unceasingly to
supply its merely physical needs.
Of all problems of the farmer, the harvesting of
grain was the most stubborn, having throughout
all history resisted every effort to apply any but
human power to its solution. Horses and oxen
had been used to pull plows, harrows and carts
but were of no avail at harvest time, when only
countless hours of backbreaking toil could cut
and bind the grain before it rotted on the ground.
Since there were usually no more than ten days in
which to harvest, the least delay caused by the
weather or a lack of manpower made for a loss of
at least part of the crop. At best, this created
shortages and uncertainty; in extreme cases it
would result in actual famine.
The principal implement of the harvest in the
earliest recorded days of history was the sickle,
a curved knife' with which a strong man could
cut a half acre in the course of a day. In 1830,
the sickle was still in general use under certain
crop conditions. Wielding a sickle is grueling
labor; each bunch of grain must be grasped in
one hand and cut by a sweep of the blade. The
scythe, practical only for cutting standing grain,
was introduced some time in antiquity and made
it possible for a man to cut two acres a day.
During the eighteenth century, the scythe was
improved by the addition of wooden fingers.
With this implement, called a "cradle,” grain
could be cut and at the same time gathered and
thrown into swaths, making it simpler for others
following to bind it into sheaves.
The first reaper started the transition to the
highly mechanized farming of today and at the
same time opened the door to other improvements,
proving to the world that long hours of drudgery
are not necessary to supply its population with
food. After the reaper had solved the problem of
the grain harvest, new uses for animal power on
the farm were discovered. Since that time there
has been no hunger in the United States brought
on by man’s inability to produce sufficient food.
The only scarcity has been the result of faults in
our distributive system. It seemed that civiliza-
tion had been used to scarcity for so many centuries
that it occasionally found abundance too strange
a phenomenon to cope with effectively.
Almost as far-reaching as the removal of the
threat of famine from this country was the trend
started by the reaper toward releasing men from
the farm. If, as in 1831, it were still necessary for
nineteen men on the farm to produce enough to
feed one man in town, there would be no large
cities, little industry, none but the most highly
essential professions—in fact, civilization would be
in much the same spot it occupied 115 years ago.
Since the reaper was introduced to the farmers of
America, the population has been flowing gradu-
ually but steadily from rural into urban areas,
until now three men in the city are amply fed
by what one man on the farm is able to produce.
The invention of the steam engine by James
Watt in the latter part of the eighteenth century
is generally credited with beginning the Industrial
Revolution in England. By providing man for
the first time with a source of power other than
that which he derived from his own efforts or
that of domestic animals, the steam engine made
possible modem transportation and industrial
power. However, it is significant that its benefits
were not completely realized until Cyrus Hall
McCormick provided a means of releasing man-
power to operate steamboats, railroads and
factories. Not until man had time to turn from
the unceasing task of satisfying his hunger could
our industrial system reach its fullest flower.
The reaper, working hand in hand with new
methods of steam transportation, was one of the
prime factors in the rapid westward movement of
our civilization. As pioneers pushed to the West
at the rate of 30 miles a year, farmers, aided by
new machinery, were putting land into productive
use as fast as it was won. The various new
inventions had a tendency to be mutually de-
pendent. There would have been fewer railroads
if farms had not produced more for them to carry
and released men to help build and run them. At
the same time, the rapid extension of land put
under cultivation was assisted by the railroads,
which were able to deliver the produce of the
farm almost as rapidly as it was harvested. Each
did its part in breaking the bottleneck between the
vast, fertile areas of the West and the people in
the East waiting to be fed.
The achievement of farm equipment in supply-
ing men and food to industry is matched by what
it has done for the farmer himself, since it fulfilled
the purpose of all labor-saving machinery—to
enable men to produce more and more with less
and less effort. The first reaper could harvest as
much grain as 20 men with sickles or five with
cradles, and opened man’s eyes to the possibilities
of leisure by making it possible for him to obtain
the necessities of life without expending every
last ounce of energy. Every subsequent im-
provement in farm equipment has raised his
standard of living by increasing the yield from
land and decreasing the amount of time which
must be spent on it.


DEVELOPMENT OF FARM
MACHINERY AFTER THE
INVENTION OF THE REAPER
The introduction of the reaper ushered in an
extraordinarily productive era of invention in
all lines of farm equipment. Stimulated by the
impressive success of McCormick’s machine, other
inventors attacked the problems of the farmer
with equal vigor. During the period between
1830 and 1850, every phase of agriculture under-
went rapid development. The steel plow, which
made it possible for the first time to turn the rich,
sticky soil of the prairies, was introduced to
replace the inefficient wood and cast iron imple-
ments which had been used for centuries. In
1834, the first threshing machine appeared, doing
away with the laborious custom of flailing grain
from chaff. Hand sowing of seed started to
become obsolete when the grain drill, which
permitted rapid, accurate planting, was invented.
Harrows and cultivators in vastly improved form
were developed—to be eagerly accepted by the
pioneers who were opening the great American
West.
All these new machines were designed to
utilize animal power to the fullest possible extent
and make it forever unnecessary for the farmer to
engage in ceaseless backbreaking toil simply to
earn a bare subsistence. Between 1830 and 1840,
the time required to harvest an acre of wheat was
reduced from about 37 hours to an estimated 111 2
hours, with an even greater decrease in the amount
of physical labor demanded of the farmer. Such
developments had a profound effect upon the
farmer’s way of life; he could now look forward
to the prospect of greater security, profits and
leisure for himself and his family. Moreover,
the faster he was able to acquire mechanical
aids, the more land he could put into productive
use. This had the tendency to uproot him, make
him spread out toward the West, where millions of
acres of fertile land waited to be put under cultiva-
tion. Ke became one of the driving forces
behind the nation’s rapid expansion and develop-
ment.
By 1846 the acceptance of the reaper in the
great farming areas of the Middle West was
complete enough to justify the building of a
factory to manufacture reapers in quantity.
Cyrus Hall McCormick moved his business to
Chicago, the logical shipping center of the new
grain territory. His first factory was established
on the north bank of the Chicago River near Lake
Michigan, becoming one of the first of Chicago’s
pioneer industries. As his original contracts with
outside manufacturers expired, McCormick re-
fused to renew them, preferring, once he had the
facilities, to have all his machines built under his
personal supervision.
• During this period, while McCormick was
concentrating on the production of his reaper, he
was also developing methods of selling, adver-
tising and distributing it. Upon the expiration of
his original patents, which in spite of litigation
were not renewed, he met a sudden increase in
competition simply by outselling his rivals and
sending his agents throughout the United States
to convince farmers in even the more remote
sections of the merits of his reaper.
The interests of the farmer were .always
uppermost in McCormick’s mind. Leaving the
manufacturing details of his business in the hands
of his brothers, he spent most of his time designing
and testing improvements on his machine and,
during the harvest season, studying the reaper in
operation. Trips to the harvest areas each year
enabled him to keep in close touch with the
problems of the farmer and to learn his views on
possible improvements. The most popular meth-
od of advertising and selling in those days was
to stage contests with competing manufacturers
before the farmers themselves. McCormick super-
vised many of these field trials himself, keeping
a watchful eye for weaknesses in the performance
of his reaper. Because of his insistence upon the
highest possible standards of quality and work-
manship, McCormick’s machines usually came
cut ahead in such contests. He had, however,
the courage and integrity to recognize flaws in his
machines and never hesitated to accept advice he
considered sound.
The first major improvement in the reaper was
adopted in 1852, when a self-rake device was added
to sweep the grain from the platform. Through
this move, the man who cleared the platform
with a hand rake was released to other work. A
further change resulted from prolonged experi-
mentation by the Marsh brothers of De Kalb,
Illinois, which culminated in 1858 in the Marsh
harvester, an idea whose worth was quickly
recognized by McCormick and applied to his
reaper. This machine employed continuous can-
vas aprons to raise the grain to a table, where
two men riding on the reaper could bind it as fast
as it collected and throw the bundles over the side.
When, in 1872, McCormick began production on
a wire binder, hand labor was virtually eliminated
from the process of harvesting. During the next
decade, wire binders were manufactured in large


This farmer is shown using the sickle, the earliest known harvesting imple-
ment, with which he could harvest a half acre a day.
In this one-room blacksmith shop near Steele's Tavern, Virginia, Cyrus Hall
McCormick built the first successful mechanical reaper.
A forward step in the evolution of harvesting machinery was the Marsh
harvester, shown here harvesting a field of wheal.
Farmers of 1831 used the cradle to harvest standing grain. With this tool,
one man could cut efficiently about two acres a day.
This model of the M[?]mick reaper shows its distinctive features: reel,
reciprocating knife, platform and ground drive wheel.

quantities, but were never accepted as entirely
satisfactory by the farmers, who claimed that the
wire injured their livestock.
The wire binder’s brief day of supremacy ended
with the invention of the twine binder, finally
perfected by John F. Appleby of Wisconsin in
1879. McCormick, realizing its value almost
immediately as an adaptation to his own machine,
procured the rights to manufacture the twine
binder and commenced to produce it in quantity.
Soon the Appleby binding attachment, mounted on
the Marsh type of harvester, was being manufac-
tured by nearly all the harvesting machine manu-
facturers in the country. These machines, in
spite of small variations in detail, were based on
the frame and reciprocal knife cutting mechanism
of McCormick’s original reaper. The binder of
today is essentially a refined version of the same
machine.
The advent of the Civil War lent tremendous
impetus to the development and production of
farm machinery by draining more than a million
men from the farms of the Middle West and
placing an increased demand upon the farmers
wljo remained to produce more food. Largely
because of the reaper, the Union was able not
only to feed a huge civilian and army population
but also to ship large quantities of food to Europe.
Without McCormick’s invention, according to a
contemporary estimate, half the crops would have
been left standing in the fields for lack of labor to
harvest them. Lincoln’s secretary of war, Edwin
M. Stanton, recognized the Union’s debt to the
reaper in an address in 1861. "Without McCor-
mick’s invention,” he said, "I fear the North could
not win, and the Union would be dismembered.”
The impressive war record of the reaper served to
convince even the most hesitant farmers of the
advantages of farm machinery. Their reluctance
to change to new ideas vanished when they saw a
possibility of losing nearly all their crops through
a lack of hand labor to harvest them. Final,
universal acceptance of mechanical farming was
an end result of the war.
The harvesting machinery business first began
to assume its world-wide character in 1851, when
McCormick entered his reaper in the exhibition of
industries of all nations at the Crystal Palace in
London. There, the reaper performed so efficiently
in a series of field tests under all conditions that it
received the highest award of the fair, the Council
Medal. English writers, at first inclined to scoff
at the new machine, finally were forced to admit
that the McCormick reaper alone was worth more
to England than the cost of the entire exhibition.
The spectacular success of this experience led
McCormick to make arrangements with a British
firm to manufacture his reaper. Throughout the
next decade, the use of the reaper spread rapidly
through all Europe. McCormick had tapped a
great potential market.
THE FORMATION OF
INTERNATIONAL HARVESTER
During the latter part of the nineteenth cen-
tury, the farm equipment industry, influenced by
the rapid expansion of agriculture for which it was
so largely responsible, grew into one of the most
highly competitive businesses in America. This
period of severe competition had a restricting
effect —so many companies entered this market
that no single enterprise could muster up enough
capital to engage in normal development or
expansion. At one time, it was estimated, more
than 2,000 concerns were manufacturing one or
more lines of equipment. Most were barely
able to keep abreast of the times —much less antici-
pate the farmer’s needs. Meanwhile, the foreign
market, which had first been opened by Cyrus
Hall McCormick in 1851, remained a fertile and
virtually untouched field of operations. Few com-
panies had either the capital or the expert organi-
zation necessary to develop a satisfactory export
business.
The two leading manufacturers of harvesting
machinery at the turn of the century were McCor-
mick’s organization and the Deering Harvester
Company, also located in Chicago. This company
had been founded in 1869 by William Deering,
another pioneer in the development and perfection
of agricultural implements. In 1902, the two
companies combined with three smaller concerns—
the Milwaukee Harvester Company, Warder,
Bushnell and Glessner Company and the Plano
Manufacturing Company—to form the Interna-
tional Harvester Company. The prime reasons
behind the organization of the new company
were to develop new products, to bring about a
more diversified line, and to give more attention
to the foreign market. Cyrus H. McCormick,
son of the inventor of the reaper and head of the
McCormick Harvesting Machine Company at
that time, became the first president of the
Harvester Company the day after its formation.
With the exception of the Warder, Bushnell
and Glessner plant at Springfield, Ohio, now
Springfield Works; that of the Milwaukee Har-
vester Company, the present Milwaukee Works;
and a Deering factory at Hamilton, Ontario, all


the manufacturing properties acquired by the
consolidation were located in or around Chicago.
The plant of the Piano Manufacturing Company
on Chicago’s south side became the Company’s
West Pullman Works. The Company also estab-
lished its General Offices in Chicago, where they
have , remained ever since. In addition, the
Deering Company, which had reached the fore-
front in its field through its manufacturing
sagacity, contributed to the corporation coal,
iron and timber lands and a steel mill in South
Chicago, now Wisconsin Steel Works, giving the
Company a source of raw materials sufficient to
provide for expansion and product diversification.
The effect of the merger upon foreign trade
became apparent almost immediately. Spurred
on by new capital, new resources and a larger
organization, the Company’s foreign business
doubled within five years and within ten had
increased fivefold, with the extension of trade
particularly effective in Great Britain, Western
and Central Europe, Russia, South America and
Australia. By 1909 factories had been established
in several European countries and sales outlets
had been set up in most of the civilized countries
of the world. The Harvester Company’s world-
wide character had become firmly established.
All the companies entering into the original
combination were engaged in the manufacture of
grain harvesting-equipment: binders, hay and corn
harvesting machines, and twine, but it was soon
realized that the industry’s tradition of service
to the farmer and the nation, which had begun
with the invention of the reaper, could not be
maintained solely by further development of these
machines but must include expansion into all
lines of agricultural implements and excursions
into types cf machinery which were then merely in
the planning stage. Ever sensitive to the needs
of the farmer, the directors of the new corporation
made plans to incorporate into the Harvester line
implements which would serve every purpose of
the farm —many of which had not even been
dreamed of a few years before. It was felt, too,
that a more diversified line of products would
remove the seasonal character from the harvesting
machine business and provide employment on a
year-round basis to the thousands of Harvester
factory employes and dealers. The addition of
new products would require production at a
plant during the periods it was not ordinarily
manufacturing harvesting equipment.
The first step in the development of a complete
line was the acquisition of the D. M. Osborne
Company, now Auburn Works, which manufac-
tured a line of harvesting and tillage implements
designed to meet the eastern trade. Because of
its location near the eastern seaboard the addition
of this Works was also in line with the Company’s
desire to expand its foreign trade. The purchase
of the Keystone Company in 1904 added an
historic line of tillage and haying tools. This
factory is now Rock Falls Works. About this
time the Weber Wagon Works of Chicago became
a Harvester property. The Company’s line of
farm implements became complete with the
acquisition in 1918 of steel and chilled plows
through the purchase of companies which operated
die present Canton and Chattanooga Works, and
the addition of a line of seeding machines being
manufactured at what is now Richmond Works.
During these years, the Company had been
rapidly developing and putting into production
new lines at its original plants. By 1912, com
binders, ensilage cutters, seeding machinery,
harrows and manure spreaders had been added to
the catalog of implements offered to Harvester
dealers. The pioneer light harvester-thresher was
introduced in 1914; the stationary thresher four
years later. Throughout this period there was a
general tendency to simplify the various lines of
traditional harvesting machinery inherited by the
Company, resulting finally in the Company’s
dropping entirely the Champion, Osborne and
Milwaukee lines of harvesters. Later the two
remaining lines were merged into one —the McCor-
mick-Deering—with the best features of each
pioneer machine retained. Consequently, work
was simplified for dealers and the Company’s
sales and servicing departments. This change
also served to concentrate experimentation and
attempts at improvement upon one identifying
line of machinery.
The gradual broadening of the Company’s
manufacturing field has been in complete accord
with Cyrus Hall McCormick’s original desire to
anticipate and meet the farmer’s needs. Every
new machine developed has been a response to
definite needs of agriculture. This has resulted
not only in a constant bettering of the farmer’s
standard of living but has also redounded to the
advantage of the Company by giving its employes
more regular employment and its dealers some-
thing to sell at every season of the year.
THE GROWTH OF POWER FARMING
The key to all progress in agriculture is power.
As long as there was only human energy, supple-
mented by the limited use of animal power, to


perform the multiple operations required by
farming, progress was necessarily slow. When
Cyrus Hall McCormick invented the reaper, he
brought to the farmer a broader application of
animal power by demonstrating its practical use
in the harvest. From that point, farming methods
leaped forward to the greatest period of develop-
ment the world had ever witnessed.
As this development accelerated, however, it
became apparent that there were definite limita-
tions to the use of animal power in farming. Not
only was the horse limited in strength and endur-
ance, but it was also expensive to maintain. A
considerable amount of the farmer’s time had to be
devoted exclusively to its care; much of the
produce of the farm had to be used as feed; and at
least part of its acreage was necessarily reserved
for pasture. By its very nature, the routine year-
to-year operation of a farm is not perfectly suited
to animal power, since so much of the work is done
in "fits and starts.” During periods such as the
harvest, labor must be highly concentrated, but
during many weeks power is not required at all.
Animals are a source of expense whether working
or idle —and they are idle too many days in the
year. Farmers urgently needed a source of power
with sustained endurance and reliability, in which
the factor of expense was limited to working time.
The development of agricultural machinery
was inhibited as long as animals were the only
available source of power. By the end of the
nineteenth century, most implements had reached
their maximum capacity for use with work animals,
yet they were capable of further improvement and
economies. Designers were forced to gear their
machines to the speed of the horse and make their
draft no heavier than an ordinary team could pull.
The grain binder, for example, had by 1900 been
perfected to the point where only additional
power could increase its efficiency. With animals
as the motive power, no higher speed could be
attained, nor could the machine be made heavy
enough to increase the width of its cut. Some
kind of power more efficient than that which
animals were able to provide was clearly indicated
if industry was to continue its service to the farmer
by giving him machines which would allow him to
get the most out of his land with the least effort.
It was only natural that after the invention of
the steam engine there should be experimentation
with the use of this mighty new source of power
on the farm. The first, and what was to be the
only really practical country-wide application of
the steam engine, was in threshing, during which
power was transmitted by a belt to the threshing
machine. Throughout the last century, many
attempts were made to apply the steam tractor
to plowing, the farmer’s most difficult job. There
was no question but that the steam engine was a
lift in pulling a plow, but its use was extremely
limited. Because of its prohibitive cost, its size
and general unwieldiness, it could be employed
profitably only on the immense acreages of the
West. Farmers of quarter and half sections never
seriously considered the steam tractor.
The real importance of the steam driven
tractor lay in the fact that it was a step in the
right direction. Its existence gave rise to the first
efforts to design and manufacture a tractor which
would employ the internal combustion engine,
beginning to be a seriously considered develop-
ment about 1900. As the internal combustion
tractor emerged from its experimental stages, the
steam tractor was doomed, although it continued
to be used in threshing for many years. The
farmer was only too glad to substitute the new
tractor for an engine suitable only for heavy duty
and requiring much more expert care and atten-
tion than he was capable of giving.
The first internal combustion tractors built
near the beginning of this century were patterned
after the steam tractor. Often their building
simply involved the replacing of the steam unit
with an internal combustion engine. Conse-
quently, the pioneer tractors embodied many of
the same faults: they were still too heavy; were
unreliable to the point that they broke down about
as often as they ran; and nearly all of them had an
alarming tendency to dig themselves into mud
holes whenever the going was at all bad. During
those first years, designers were convinced that
there could be neither power nor traction without
great weight. The efforts of all progressive farm
tractor manufacturers have since been directed
toward constantly decreasing the tractor’s size and
lessening its weight per horsepower.
As might be expected in an organization so
sensitive to the needs of the farmer, Harvester was
one of the first companies to explore the possi-
bilities of this new kind of power. The demand
from the farm for a more efficient power was not
lost upon its predecessor companies, particularly
since their designers had long since admitted the
limitations imposed upon their implements by
animal power. As early as 1889, the Deering
Harvester Company began to experiment with a
gas engine and, by the time of the formation of
International Harvester, was producing almost 50
stationary engines a day which could be mounted
on various Deering implements. In 1900, E. A.


This is the first International Harvester tractor, developed experimentally at
Keystone and McCormick Works about 1905.
One of the Mogul line of tractors built about 1910. This popular model
developed 45 horsepower and weighed almost 11 tons.
By 1921, Harvester tractors were beginning to resemble the wheel tractors
of today. This is a McCormick-Deering 15-30 of that year.
The Farmall M, heaviest of the current line of all-purpose tractors, was first
introduced to America's farmers in 1939.
In 1906, the Company started regular production on tractors like this one,
built under an arrangement with the Ohio Manufacturing Co.
This kerosene tractor, produced in 1915, was one of the Company’s feat
attempts to design a machine suitable for the smaller farms.
The Farmall, which first appeared in 1922, revolutionized the tractor industry.
This was the first successful all-purpose tractor.
Until the arrival of the new “Cub” the Farmall A, first produced in 1939.
was the smallest of the McCormick-Deering line.


Johnston of the McCormick Harvesting Machine
Company designed an auto mower, the outgrowth
of several years of experimentation with the
internal combustion engine.
Experimental work on the first International
Harvester tractor began in 1905 at Keystone—
now Rock Falls—Works under the supervision of
Mr. Johnston. This was a cumbersome, three-
wheeled machine with a single wide wheel in front.
The following year, the Company put its first
tractors on the market. These were built under an
arrangement with the Ohio Manufacturing Com-
pany of Sandusky, Ohio, which supplied the truck
and transmission on which an International
engine was mounted. Meanwhile the Company
proceeded with its experimental work at Akron
and McCormick Works, producing the first all-
Intemational tractors at Akron in 1908. In 1909,
one of these tractors crossed the ocean to Amiens,
France, where in a memorable contest it received
the medal of honor for plowing for two days with-
out a breakdown. By 1910, Harvester’s Mogul
and Titan tractors represented a third of the
nation’s production, and Tractor Works in Chicago,
had been built for their exclusive manufacture.
Just as the Civil War hastened the final,
unequivocal acceptance of the reaper, World War I
gave a tremendous impetus to the use of tractors
on the farm. Confronted by an unprecedented
demand for food, both in this country and in
Europe, and war’s inevitable drainage of manpower
from normal pursuits, farmers turned to tractors
in increasing numbers as the only solution to their
problems. Here they found the answer to both
labor and power shortages. In spite of consider-
able loss of farm animals to the Army, there was a
marked increase in farm production. Moreover,
the fact that tractors did not use up feed as did
farm animals allowed that much more grain to be
channeled to a hungry world. During the war
years, tractor production at International Har-
vester more than doubled. This clear demon-
stration of the efficiency of tractor power on the
farm started a decline in the use of animal power
which has been steady ever since.
Up to and during the first World War, tractor
manufacture continued to be characterized by the
building of huge, unwieldy machines, strongly
influenced in design by the steam engine. This
emphasis upon the production of large tractors
was caused largely by the urgent need of the large
farmer, who was the first to feel the inadequacy of
animal power. A small farm could still be operated
profitably with animal power, but the volume of
work in the large acreages of the West was more
than horses and mules were capable of handling
efficiently.
The incentive provided by the huge wartime
demand for tractors led many automobile manu-
facturers into the farm power field. The influence
of automotive design led to many chafiges in the
farm tractor and began a trend toward a smaller
machine, one which would be suitable for use on
the ordinary small farm of the Middle West.
Some of these manufacturers, failing to grasp the
essential differences, tried unsuccessfully to convert
the automobile into a tractor. There was a middle
group, however, which was fully aware of these
differences but saw a possibility of applying many
of the principles of automobile manufacture to
the tractor without sacrificing any of its simplicity
or necessary ruggedness. In this category was the
Harvester Company, which gradually altered the
design of its tractors, making them lighter and
embodying in them more precision construction.
Harvester engineers had been working for
many years on a tractor, which, unlike the standard
four-wheeled machine, could be used effectively
for cultivating row crops. The first such attempt
was a motor cultivator, produced experimentally
in 1915. Because of its high manufacturing cost
and limited utility, this machine was dropped
from production in 1919 in favor of concentrated
experimentation on an all-purpose tractor. Up to
this time, it had been felt in many quarters that
two tractors would be necessary to the efficient
operation of a farm without animal power: a
conventional, four-wheeled model for all duties
except cultivating and a motor cultivator of some
type. The Farmall was the first successful attempt
at building a genuine all-purpose tractor. Its
advent in 1922 revolutionized the tractor industry.
During that year, twenty of the experimental
Farmalls were sent to the field for testing and care-
ful observation by Harvester experts; in 1923, 26
more were sent out for trial after further field-
tested refinements had been made. The following
year regular production on a limited schedule began.
A landmark in tractor production was reached
in 1926, when Farmall Works in Rock Island,
Illinois, was equipped and placed in operation.
The Farmall has undergone no radical change in
design since the day it started rolling off the
assembly line at the new Works which had been
built solely for its production. Each year has seen
refinements, but the essential features have re-
mained the same: the high rear-wheel drive; the
arched rear axle for clearance; the small, narrow
front wheels designed to run between row crops;
and the means of mounting cultivators and other


attachments to either the front or the rear.
Through its ability to perform not only the belt
and drawbar functions of the standard four-
wheeled tractor but also to work in row crops
efficiently the Farmall made possible for the first
time the horseless farm. Since its introduction,
nearly all tractor manufacturers have followed the
Harvester example with machines of similar
design.
Even before the introduction of the Farmall,
the Harvester Company pioneered in the develop-
ment of the power take-off, which, when it appeared
in 1918, finally eliminated the necessity for the
ground drive wheel. This feature permitted
direct transmission of power from the tractor to
the drawn machine, minimizing the loss of power
arid opening the way to the design of lighter, more
compact implements. By 1934, the power take-off
had been built into nearly every tractor on the
market.
Since the development of the power take-off
and the successful entry of the Farmall into the
farm tractor field, revolutionary changes have
taken place in the design of all farm machinery.
Equipment has been designed to be mounted
directly upon the tractor, easily detachable and
removable by one man. Thus an implement
becomes an integral part of the tractor itself,
permitting a lighter, less expensive construction,
yet much higher speeds than could be attained
with animal power. The use of a tractor equipped
with a power take-off has allowed all harvesting
machinery to employ a wider cut and high-speed
gearing.
A further improvement was the introduction
of pneumatic-tired tractors in 1933. Although
they increased the original cost of the tractor,
rubber tires had many advantages, the most
important of which was the lessened rolling
resistance and consequent reduction in fuel costs.
Rubber tires for the first time admitted the tractor
to the paved highway, an invaluable aid in moving
equipment from one field to another on farms
crossed by important roads. Their cushioning
action added greatly to the life of the tractor and
the comfort of the driver. Since their adoption,
manufacturers have been able to build higher
speeds into tractors and design heavier, more
versatile equipment.
The success of the Farmall design induced
manufacturers to give more attention to the needs
of the small farmer. Harvester led the way in this
direction with its introduction in 1933 of the
Farmall 12, the first of the one-plow tractors.
This was followed in 1939 by the Farmalls A and
B, even smaller and less expensive machines, with
the added advantage of an offset design to permit
greater visibility while cultivating. In 1945, the
Farmall Cub was finalized for production—ready
to serve all the purposes of the nation’s smallest
farms. Each of these small tractors brought with
them, as collateral developments, equipment also
adapted to the farm of limited acreage which
could be mounted on the tractor or used with the
power take-off in the same manner as the larger
machines.
GROWTH OF THE INTERNATIONAL
MOTOR TRUCK BUSINESS
The Harvester Company’s entry into the field
of motor transportation was inspired by a recog-
nized need of the farmer. By the end of the last
century, rural America had become so spread out
and farm production had increased so enormously
that transportation threatened to become a bottle-
neck. Farmers who were not located near a rail-
road were finding the horse and wagon an utterly
inadequate, time-consuming means of hauling
their produce to the market. Trips to town were
necessarily infrequent when they involved ari
expenditure of long hours or days of indispensable
horse and manpower. America’s farmers needed
a method of transporting themselves and their
produce with speed and dependability. The first
gropings in the direction of a gasoline-powered
horseless carriage seemed to indicate the solution
to this problem.
At the same time that it began to experiment
with its first tractors, Harvester became inter-
ested in the development of a farm truck. For
many years before the management was officially
committed to the idea, the Company’s engineers
had been testing versions of a vehicle suited to the
needs of the farmer. As early as 1898, E. A.
Johnston of the Engineering Department had
installed a gas engine in a wagon-type chassis and
driven it successfully between his home and
McCormick Works for many months. After
several more years of experimentation, Mr.
Johnston designed and developed an "auto-buggy”
at Keystone Works in 1905. This was a two-
cylinder, air-cooled engine mounted on a high-
wheeled chassis, designed to look as much as
possible like the traditional horse-drawn buggy.
It was to serve the same purpose—to haul mod-
erate amounts of produce to and from the market
and take the farmer and his family to church on
Sundays.
In the early spring of 1907, 100 of these auto-

buggies were put into production in a part of
McCormick Works which had been set aside for
the purpose. The quick acceptance of these
vehicles appeared to justify their production on a
regular basis, so the assembly line was moved later
that same year to Akron Works, where more
adequate facilities existed. This was the first of
the Company’s motor truck plants. Here also
the Company made a brief venture into the
manufacture of passenger automobiles, when, in
1908, Mr. Johnston designed a roadster and a
touring car, both equipped with four-cylinder,
vertical engines, the first in automotive history
to use overhead chain-driven camshafts. After
approximately 1,500 of these models had been
produced in 1910 and 1911, the Company decided
to abandon the manufacture and sale of auto-
mobiles. Trucks, it was felt, would be more
nearly in keeping with the Harvester policy of
meeting the nation’s transportation needs.
During the years which followed, the design of
the International truck was gradually weaned
away from the original high-wheeled auto-buggy
and began to conform to the lines of the con-
ventional truck. Just as was the case with the
tractor, the heavy demand for motor transport
created by the first World War stimulated the
manufacture of all models of trucks. From 1915 on,
the Company developed the prototype of the
present International truck and the demand from
urban consumers began to outstrip that from the
farm.
By 1921, the Company had decided to enter
the speed truck field, and it became apparent that
facilities at Akron Works would soon become
inadequate to handle the increased volume of
truck production in all models. Accordingly,
speed truck manufacture was instituted at Spring-
field Works, home of the old Champion line of
farm equipment which had only recently been
discontinued. At the same time, the Company
determined to build a modern plant suitable to
modern mass production methods to house the
manufacture of its line of heavy-duty trucks.
After careful deliberation, Fort Wayne, Indiana,
was selected as the site, and construction began in
1922. By 1923, Fort Wayne Works, a thoroughly
modem factory in every respect, produced its first
vehicle. Akron Works was closed in 1925. By
that time, International had become the country’s
largest manufacturer of a complete line of trucks
and was producing a vehicle for every important
agricultural and commercial need, with the latter
predominating. Today it is the only farm equip-
ment company which also produces motor trucks.
The volume of motor truck production had
reached a point by 1937 which justified the
erection of a plant to be devoted exclusively to the
production of truck engines. Indianapolis was
chosen as the location for this, because of its
position approximately 150 miles from both
Springfield and Fort Wayne. It is the most modern
of the Harvester Company motor truck factories.
The first heat was poured in the foundry in July,
1939. Since that time production of track engines
of all types has risen to more than 2,000 per day.
International trucks have long been famed for
their ability to stand up under any conditions.
Comparing favorably in ruggedness to the McCor-
mick-Deering line of tractors, they are built to
withstand all types of abnormal road and load
conditions. The high-wheeled construction of
the original auto-buggies and auto-wagons was
designed to allow these vehicles to traverse the
muddy, rutted country roads the average farmer
was forced to cope with. Only after improvement
had been made in the nation’s highways was the
diameter of the wheel shortened. Modem Inter-
nationals have always been designed under the
assumption that operating conditions will be poor
and have been built to stand up under conditions
far removed from the normal. For this reason, the
International 4x4, 6x6 and half-track were
chosen by the Army, Navy and Marine Corps for
use throughout World War 11.
At Fort Wayne Works, a proving ground
containing a severe twist course and roads studded
with Belgian paving blocks, was completed in
1929 to assure all models’ receiving a thorough
scientific testing under the most arduous condi-
tions possible before being offered to the customer.
International trucks are just one example of the
pioneering spirit which has always characterized
the Company’s achievements in its chosen fields.
The fact that the motor truck is now more exten-
sively used in the city and on the highway than on
the farm does not detract from the integration of
the Harvester Company’s expansion.
EXPANSION OF THE
INDUSTRIAL POWER LINE
The development of industrial power was a
natural outgrowth of the Harvester Company’s
efforts in the direction of providing power for the
farm. It was only logical that the tractor which
had been perfected by the Company should find its
way into industrial use, where the need for power
was just as acute. Records indicate that, as early
as 1912, an International Harvester Titan tractor


The application of International power to industrial use is nothing new. In this photograph, taken about
1908, two of our early tractors are shown providing the power for road building equipment in Chicago,
This 1912 Titan tractor was convertible into a road-roller by removing the
front wheels and inserting rollers as shown above.
The International crawler tractor in 1928 was a Model 10-2O farm tractor to
which had been added a track-laying device.
The TD-24, largest of the International line of Diesel-powered tractor, will
soon be in production at Melrose Park Works,
The Model 10-20 farm tractor was modified for industrial use by the addition
of solid ruber-tired wheels in 1924.
In 1933, the first International tractor with a [?] engine was introduced.
This model was called the T-40 TracTracTor.

was designed to be convertible into a road roller
by the removal of the front wheels and insertion
of four 15-inch rollers. Tractors became really
practicable for industrial use, however, when the
regular McCormick-Deering 10-20 farm tractor
was equipped with solid rubber tires in 1924. Five
years later the 15-30 was similarly equipped to
give industrial users the benefit of added power.
In 1928, the 10-20 was modified by the addition
of a tracklaying device to make the first Inter-
national crawler type tractor.
All these early industrial tractors were simply
modifications of the regular line of International
Harvester farm tractors, adapted to industrial use.
The addition of the solid rubber tires made the
tractor suitable for use on paved highways and
within factory buildings. Later International
crawler tractors were built with more and more
horsepower to meet the needs of heavy construc-
tion and logging work and also to satisfy the
demand from farmers who needed the extra power
and traction of the cipawler type tractor to pull
heavy combines and gang plows over the immense,
hilly acreages of the West. By 1933, the first
Diesel engine was installed in an International
crawler tractor, the TD-40. This was the first
American-made Diesel engine that started on
gasoline and after a minute or less shifted to full
Diesel operation—giving advantages in ease and
dependability of starting, still a feature of Inter-
national Diesels. The Diesel-powered tractor also
gave the farmer and industrial user the advantage
of more economical operation in heavy-duty jobs.
By the time pneumatic tires had been intro-
duced for use with the tractor, Harvester was
manufacturing a full line of machines for industrial
use. This innovation gave the industrial tractor
greater mobility and a wider variety of uses —
particularly in airports, large factories and enter-
prises in which there is a problem of handling
heavy materials. At this time, too, International
truck and tractor engines were being adapted to
industrial use as power units for machines made
by other manufacturers. In 1938, Harvester
produced its first tractor designed for exclusive
industrial use, the TD-18, the forerunner of the
mighty TD-24, the largest of the Diesel-powered
crawler-type tractors. • No longer were industrial
tractors simply modifications of farm tractors; an
entirely new field had been opened with its own
distinctive characteristics and demands. This led
in 1944 to the creation of an Industrial Power
Division, distinct from the Farm Tractor Division.
The following year, the Company purchased a
former airplane engine plant in Melrose Park,
Illinois, for the production of stationary engines,
power units and the TD-24.
DEVELOPMENT OF REFRIGERATION
Another field in which the Company’s urban
business threatens to outstrip that of the farm is
refrigeration, where, as was the case in every other
Harvester product, all the original effort was
toward meeting the needs of the farmer. The
venture into refrigeration was a logical step
toward assisting the dairy farmer, a process which
began in 1907 with the introduction of a line of
cream separators, long a favorite with the farmer
and now even more popular since the addition of
stainless steel to its design. In 1929, the milking
machine was added to the dairy line after ten years
of extensive study of design, construction and
performance on the part of Harvester engineers.
The first step into mechanical refrigeration, a
comparatively new field in the United States, was
made by Harvester in 1935, when the milk cooler
was introduced to the farmer in response to the
demand for some means of artificially cooling milk
quickly enough to prevent bacteria from making
headway. Soon most state health departments
were making this a requirement before milk could
be sold. The Harvester Company was a pioneer
in the design of milk cooling equipment for the
farm and was the first concern to manufacture a
complete assembled unit in one plant. The suc-
cess of this machine led to the development of the
walk-in cooler for the preservation of all perishable
products of the farm.
With the establishment cf the Refrigeration
Division in 1945 and the subsequent purchase of a
new plant at Evansville, Indiana, the Company
was prepared to go into regular production of the
newer refrigeration units freezing chests and
household refrigerators suitable for both farm
and city use.
POST-WAR HARVESTER PRODUCTS
The end of World War 11, to the winning of
which Harvester contributed many vital war
materials —aerial torpedoes, prime movers, mili-
tary vehicles, small arms and artillery parts—
brought on an acceleration of invention and design
in farm machinery. Prominent among the ma-
chines reaching an advanced stage of design is the
cotton picker, with which Harvester engineers
had been experimenting since 1898. With this
machine, one of the last strongholds of hand labor
on the farm has been successfully invaded. The


new one-man baler, the self-propelled combine and
the sugar beet harvester are other examples of
recent machines designed to do a specific job more
economically and efficiently for the farmer.
The invention of new machines and the further
development of existing machinery have been
continuous and are still going on to meet the needs
of the farmer, who, in the last analysis, is the one
who inspires and directs the efforts of implement
manufacturers such as Harvester. The Company’s
engineers are guided in their design of farm equip-
ment by the problems actually presented by the
farmer, transmitted through the sales and research
organizations which maintain a constant contact
with farmers in all sections of the country.
International Harvester, bearing in mind the
original concept of its founders, will continue its
efforts to enable farmers of all classes to produce
more and more with less and less effort and,
consequently, at lower cost. Inevitably, advances
in farm technology will demand an increasing
variety of specialized equipment. As in the past,
Harvester will endeavor to live up to its tradition
of service by keeping the pace—anticipating as
far as is possible the needs of America’s farmers
and integrating its expansion, in no matter what
line, first of all to the needs of rural America.
Nor is the Company neglecting the needs of
its other customers. Already in production is a
post-war line of truck models to meet the demands
of transportation in all sections of the country.
Emeryville Works in California was purchased in
1945 to manufacture a line of heavy-duty trucks
suitable for the West Coast trade. Other new
models are constantly being designed to satisfy
the wants of every type of business and com-
mercial enterprise. In the industrial power field
the outstanding postwar contribution is the
TD-24, the largest diesel-powered tractor in the
International line. Harvester refrigerating units,
too, will soon be reaching beyond the farm to
make available to all users freezing chests and
household refrigerators.
Although it is no longer exclusively a manufac-
turer of farm equipment, International Harvester
will continue to operate for the public welfare by
producing quality products at prices its customers
can afford to pay, paying its employes fair wages,
and insuring its stockholders a just return on their
investment. In the spirit of American free enter-
prise, it will, as in the past, grow with the nation
and help the nation grow.


THE AUSTRALIAN COMPANY
EARLY ORGANIZATION
Prior to formation of International Harvester
Company in U.S.A., in 1902, Australia had its
link with both McCormick and Deering products
in the separate Sales Organizations then
operating in this country.
For some time after the merger they con-
tinued to operate as separate divisions of the
parent Company, but in 1904 combined and
commenced operations as International Har-
vester Company of America, having a head office
in Melbourne and Branches in all States.
Agencies were set up throughout Australia
to handle McCormick and Deering products,
together with certain other products already
established on the Australian market, the
manufacture of which had been taken over by
the parent Company.
In addition to Company manufactured lines,
others were handled on an Agency basis, chief
of which were:—
Buffalo Pitts Steam Engines.
Niagara Threshers.
Superior Seed Drills.
Planet Junior Garden Implements.
Cockshutt Disc and Mouldboard Ploughs.
Newell Sanders Disc Ploughs.
Svea (Swedish) Separators.
The Australian Organization was thus able, to
present to the farmer a well rounded out line of
agricultural implements.
The first International Tractor was added to
the line in 1906, and subsequently the first
Auto Buggy was marketed in 1907.
Harvesters were fitst marketed in 1905, but
were finally displaced by the Harvester Thresher
about 1915. Importation of the Harvester
Thresher was finally discontinued following
imposition of a prohibitive tariff.
It was in July, 1912, that International Har-
vester Company of Australia Pty. Ltd. was
formed to purchase the assets in Australia of
International Harvester Company of America,
and carry on the business formerly conducted
by that Company.
The history of this Company is one of steady
progress, interrupted only by the financial
depression of the early 1930’5. However, the
sound structure of the organization was
evidenced by the rapid recovery from that
period of general trade recession.
DEVELOPMENT OF MANUFACTURE
It was at that time that widespread tariff
restrictions on imports were imposed, causing
the Company to examine avenues of Australian
manufacture. Prior to 1937 the Company was
essentially an importing house. Handicapped,
however, by import restrictions, and with the
necessity for developing individual machines for
Australian conditions, attention was directed
towards manufacture in this country.
Following careful research and investigation,
the Company’s Works was established hi
Geelong, Victoria, and commenced operation in
1989. This year marked not only the transition
from wholly importing to importing and manu-
facturing, but also heralded the initiation of a
policy of acquisition in Australia of real estate.
The factory site comprises 46 acres situated
at N'orth Shore, Geelong. Transport facilities
are ideally placed. Main line rail siding enters
the Works, whilst deep-water wharfage accom-
modation adjoins, and arterial road is adjacent.
The plant is capable of manufacturing every
item of agricultural equipment, and includes two
foundries, forge and machine shops, in addition
to warehouse facilities.
The extensive manufacturing programme
scheduled for Geelong Works was interrupted
by the outbreak of World War 11. Regular
production—except on Service Parts—gave way
to production of war materials and equipment
necessary to the effective prosecution of the
Allied effort in the Pacific area. Since Aus-
tralia’s food production programme was of vital
importance, both for our own and the Allied
war effort, it was decided, in conjunction with
Military Authorities, that manufacture of
certain lines of farm equipment should continue.
The Works Engineers, therefore, applied them-
selves to development of equipment for large
scale vegetable production, their efforts resulting
in many lines of vegetable equipment entirely
new to Australia. The speedy production of this
equipment constituted a valuable contribution
to both the vegetable growing industry and the
National War Effort.
Following cessation of hostilities, the Company
commenced the swing back to full production of
farm equipment and service parts.
Post-war development and progress has been
marked by a general expansion programme.
Distribution of industrial power is now on a


wholesale basis, so placing this equipment in
the hands of specialised dealers and salesmen.
A domestic refrigerator was added to the
general line, thus taking the Harvester product
into the farm home.
The manufacturing programme was expanded
and production of two models—GL-130, GL-131
Cultivator Drills and GL-200 Header Harvester
—was completed for the seasons 1947 and 1947-
48 respectively. These machines, designed and
manufactured to Australian requirements at the
same time embody technical features resulting
from world-wide research. They provide a
valuable contribution to general advances in farm
practices.
Possibly the greatest advance made by the
Australian Company, following the establish-
ment of Geelong Works, was the decision made
in 1947 to manufacture certain models of Trac-
tors, Motor Trucks and Industrial Power Units.
This decision will rank among the really great
contributions to Australia’s industry, both
primary and secondary.
It is seen that the Australian Company, like
its illustrious parent, no longer serves the agri-
cultural industry alone. It, too, has set itself
to serve a wide sphere of community interests.
PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION
The General Office has been retained in Mel-
bourne, whilst Branch Houses situated in
Capital Cities in all States except Tasmania,
distribute Company products through upwards
of 550 dealers in an Australian-wide network.
Tasmanian business is handled through a State
Distributor.
The franchise embraces three main fields:—
1. Agricultural Machinery and Tractors.
2. Motor Trucks.
3. Industrial Power.
Warehousing, tractor and motor truck as-
sembly, and motor truck service facilities, are
maintained at all Branch Houses; in addition to
which individual industrial distributors maintain
their separate service organizations.
Commonwealth-wide provision of user service
facilities is in the hands of the dealer organiza-
tion, the individual members of which are pro-
gressively equipping themselves to handle all
phases of user requirements in after-sale service.
Adequate stocks of service parts are also main-
tained.
Assembly of farm machines is in the hands
of dealers at the point of retail distribution.
The object of the retail merchandising plan
is to assure to the customer complete distribu-
tion and after-sale services, thus affording fullest
protection of the customer’s investment a
fundamental concept initiated by Cyrus Hall
McCormick some 115 years ago.
The policy of the Australian Company, like
that of its famous parent, is founded on the
spirit of Harvester tradition, and such tradition
is the main spring of the determination of the
organization to serve Australian industry, and
serve it well.
