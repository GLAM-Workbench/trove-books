THE DECLINE AND FALL OF
THE BRITISH EMPIRE.
CHAPTER I.
EXTENT AND MILITARY FORCE OF THE EMPIRE IN THE AGE OF
THE GUELPHS.
N the nineteenth century of the Christian
era, and the first age of Spiritualism, the
Empire of England embraced the
wealthiest portions of our globe, and
the most admirable of its commercial
situations. The ancient reputation of
Britain?s arms by sea and land still
warranted towards the termination of
that century the most remote colonist in reposing, in cheerful
serenity and placid security, beneath the banner which
boasted to have braved for a thousand years the battle and
the breeze. Remnants of personal liberty still permitted the
opening of taverns for the retailing of potent beverages, even
upon Sundays; while gambling in clubs and upon race-
courses, and other licentious pleasures, had not yet been
rendered by statute amenable to the police. The principal
conquests of the British had been achieved under the Guelphs ;
the grandest and most opulent of their dependencies having
been subdued by a company of merchants, in the course of
the natural expansion of commerce. The armies of the
Empire, without counting the mercenaries, numbered but one
to ten in proportion to those of the great European Powers,
who had not yet passed to the commercial from the warrior
stage of nations. But the peaceful citizens of the Empire,
whether posting their letters and ledgers beneath the murky
skies of Britain, or under the gorgeous sunshine of some
tropical dependency, alike complacently entrusted the security


of their lives and chattels to the disciplined courage of British
soldiers, or, still more confidently, to the unconquered fidelity
of British seamen. During an arrogant and sumptuous period
of more than two centuries the externals of the Majesty of the
throne of England were conserved with decent reverence,
while the utmost political liberty was enjoyed, accompanied
by extreme individual licence. Not yet had the Imperial title
been assumed by the constitutional monarchs of the United
Kingdom, though the expression of Empire Avas usually
employed to designate the vast aggregate of Colonies and
military dependencies which acknowledged the practical
power of Downing Street, while they bowed with reverential
awe before the mysterious might of Windsor Castle. For
half a century of years progressing in prosperity, the actual
executive authority had devolved upon successive adminis-
trations, which had conducted the public service with virtue
and ability. Since the passing of the Reform Bill of 1832,
which had transferred the majority of the seats in the House of
Commons from the pockets of the Peerage into the hands of
the public, or the publicans, the helm of the steamer of the
State had been successively held by Melbourne, Peel, Russell,
Aberdeen, Palmerston, Derby, Beaconsfield, and Gladstone.
Careful heed had been maintained to the compass of Con-
stitutionalism and the varying gales of popular acclamation.
It is the function of this and the following chapters to
indicate the Empire over which these ministers had successively
or alternately ruled ; and to deduce the influences which con-
duced to its decline and fall ; a concatenation of adverse
circumstances which must still be decorously deplored by
our noblest and most successful of the branches of the great
Aryan ancestral tree. Prosperous and powerful, it may
pause in the precipitate career of modern existence to lament,
with giateiul propriety, the downfall of its grandmother
country, and the decay ot what was once the cream of nations
?the chosen home of Respectability.
Till the concluding Cabinet which had conducted the
concerns of this consequential period the dignity of the


realm had been conserved with patriotic firmness, and the
world had hardly dared to question the considerations which
dictated the course of England. When commercial interests
suggested a re-adjustment of remote frontiers, the philan-
thropic motives of the British were acknowledged in
the reprobation which they bestowed upon any act of
annexation on the part of foreign peoples or potentates. It
was reserved for the transcendental genius and indomitable
spirit of Beaconsfield to realise the Empire, and place the
Imperial diadem upon the fair brows of Victoria. The Lion
of Judah roared again in the rejuvenescent Lion of England,
and the astonished world attended with awe to the mighty
word which securely enthralled the richest province of the
East. The warlike West might tremble as the reverberations
of the voice of the now Imperial Animal proclaimed the
assumption of that dignity; which had been recently dropped
by the short-flighted Eagle of France.
Even the famous Empire of Old Imperial Rome fades into
insignificance before the splendour and resources of that
swayed by the Sovereign of Great Britain, Ireland and their
numerous dependencies, when, towards the termination of
the nineteenth century, the Imperial style was openly
assumed by the English monarch. The ancient and revered
Shakespeare?s Puck could have discerned no orbit in which
he could have ?put a girdle round the earth in forty
minutes ? without Victoria?s subjects being encountered
throughout its compass. The Queen Empress, in the
concluding quarter of the nineteenth century, might have
summoned to a review in the park of Hyde the most
amazing assemblage of troops of all creeds and complexions
which had ever paraded beneath one banner. The Hig -
landers of Scotland?whose sable plumes nodded in stately
similitude to those which adorned or rendered awful the
death coaches of the period, while their bare knees illustrated,
in the absence of breeks the frugality or parsimony of
their race?must, even at that epoch of elaborate and
fanciful costumes, have afforded the civilised world matter


for amazement. But the fierce and motley foreigners, who
maintained in distant dependencies the honour of the
British Standard, could scarcely have been contemplated by
the more timorous citizens without nervous apprehension.
The more philosophical would have discerned actual
occasion for alarm in the existence of mercenaries ; some
of whom had been, in times comparatively recent, engaged
in the fiercest conflict with those whom they now acknow-
ledged as their masters. It was only in 1849 that the Sikhs
had submitted to the power of England, after the sanguinary
battles of Chilianwallah and Goojerat; 7,000 having been
reported killed and wounded after Chilianwallah, with
2,269 �f the British. Ten years subsequently they had
demonstrated their fidelity to their conquerors when the
Army of Bengal revolted, but the Bengalees were their own
hereditary enemies. Turbaned Punjabees, Ghoorkas, distin-
guished by the broad-bladed crooked knives at their girdles,
flashing-eyed Rajpaots and the long array of the swarthy
tribes of Hindustan, with trains of artillery, drawn by its
mighty elephants, might have preceded yellow Malays and
West Indian Zouaves. Fantces from the Gold Coast might
have followed, and light infantry from our own extinct
aborigines, equipped with boomerangs and poisoned spears ;
and not ill adapted, by the scantiness of their apparel, for
the uncertain rainfall of the United Kingdom. All the
races of the globe?Aryan and Semitic, Mongolian and
Turanian?might have illustrated the illustrious pre-eminence
of the Empire. With the soldiers of the regular army, in
uniforms of ensanguined hue, and the citizen volunteers,
the whole array might have seemed as invincible as awe-
inspiring. Employing only the comparatively puny power
of gunpowder, with the barbarous alternative of the bayonet,
no warriors of the mediaeval world were individually equal to
the British. The ?streak of silver sea,? in the conception
of England?s voluble Premier, afforded sufficient guarantee
against the incursions of the massive battalions of the Sclav
and Teuton, or the agile conscripts of France. England dis-


daincd to imitate the powers of Europe in enforcing military
service upon her citizens. The Press-gangs, w IC a
recruited her navies in the wars of the eighteenth century,
had been consigned to the lumber and odium of the past.
Careless even of retaining those soldiers who had been
induced to enlist, Cardwell, the scholar of Oxford and ex-
President of the Board of Trade, installed as Minister of
War, with an intellect unwarped by acquaintance with t e
theory or practice of military science, introduced the system
of short service. Continued in successive Administrations,
beautiful in theory, but practically inadequate to the pressing
necessities of actual war, the victories of Egypt in 1882 were
won by regiments reinforced with reserves before they coul
be despatched against the enemy. The speedy flight of the
latter avoided the necessity of a painful strain upon the
resources of the country; and the conduct of the General
and discipline of the troops evoked the enthusiastic applause
of England. The importance of the victories was illustrated
in the munificence of the rewards which were bestowed upon
the victors. Britannia had thrown down the gauntlet to the
world when-her armies occupied the ancient territory o
the Pharaohs. The palatial Halls of the City Companies
resounded at grateful banquets with for e
conquerors; and the respectful world acknowledged tha
neither the teeth, claws, nor digestion of the Lion of England
were impaired.
CHAPTER H.
UNION ANO INTERNAL PROSPERITY of THE BRITISH EMPIRE IN THE
REIGN OF VICTORIA.
It is not alone by the rapidity and extent of conquest
that we should estimate the grandeur of Great Britain at this
epoch; stated in the ? Statesman?s Year-Book of a thousand
years ago to have comprised about one-seventh of the land
surface of our globe, and nearly a fourth of its population.


Throughout the whole extent of ocean Britannia proudly
clamed to rue the waves. Within a century England had
obtained ample compensation for the loss of America by the
founding of Australasia; and the reduction of the entire
Peninsula of Hindustan, which was committed to the charge
if " tlsh Satraps ? under denomination of competition-
wallahs. who were securely enthralled in the bonds of official
white tape. The firm edifice of British authority had been
elevated by energy, courage, and constancy in the pursuit of
material wealth. It had been sustained by uncommon sense
and a policy of enlightenment. The various religions which
prevailed throughout the British territories were considered by
he Government, from a political point of view, as equally
salutary ; by the advanced thinkers of the nineteenth century
as equally false ; and by the British public as equally leading
to condemnation or dangerous delusion, with the exception of
at professed by the S6Ct Wh ' Ch if affected - On the one hand
e Church coquetted with the scarlet Lady of Rome; on the
other, she invited the sad-hued co-operation of Puritanism. She
proclaimed m her ritual that spiritual safety was to be found
beneath one name alone, but she had abjured the instruments
o fire and sword, which, in ages even less enlightened, had
stained with blood the nomenclature of religion. Anglo-
Indian congregations continued their devotions beneath the
cooling breezes of punkahs, pulled by heathen whom orthodoxy
destined to damnation. The noble fabric of the British Con-
sbtution as yet jaded rather than threatened, or endangered
y Socialists, Fenians and the Birmingham Caucus, retained its
ancient and respectable dignity in Church and State. The
laws of the realm were still unvulgarised by codification, and
invested with the awful sanctity appertaining to the unknown
for malfeasance by pleading ignol
ranee of the law; but even the priesthood of the science, in
� r C � nCealed by their of horsehair,
confessed themselves dazed or perplexed by thousands of
Bench F fb tes 0f Parliament - or d ecisions of the Judicial
Bench. Even the venerable and ermined Judges pronounced


themselves embarrassed upon occasions in the interpretation
of Acts of Parliament, and from a phrase current at the time
there appeared to be great satisfaction at the uncertainty of
the law, as evidenced by the word ? glorious, prefixed to the
expression. As illustrating this uncertainty, a case is on
record ?Dobbs v. the Grand Junction Water Co, ?where that
illustrious person, whose career as a legislator was so remark-
able, and whose statue at Stratford-atte-Bow was still more so,
had a dispute with the company who supplied him with water
as to the meaning of the words ?annual value ? as applied to
his house. The case first went before a Police Magistrate, who
decided against Dobbs. Secondly, before two learned Judges,
who said the Magistrate was wrong and Dobbs was right.
Thirdly, before the Lord Chief Justice of England and two
Lords Justices of the Supreme Court of Judicature, who said
the Court below and Dobbs were both wrong. Lastly, it
reached the House of Lords, where, as it could be argued no
further, it was finally decided that Dobbs was right all the
time, and that annual value meant what you could get for the
hire of a house or a horse less the expense of keeping such
house or hor-se in a state to command such rent or hiring fee.
Then the public, incited by one Mobbs, clamoured for the
Government Taxes being assessed on this sound basis. Ihe
result of that agitation is well known. Since the days of
Pontius Pilate, popular clamour was ever a potent force with
weak authorities.
The House of Lords still retained its hereditary and
genealogical honours. In 1883, the entrance into a new era
was marked by the elevation of a poet to the honours hitherto
bestowed only upon success in war, adjudicature or statecraft
or upon the importance of wealth. On occasions of state,
robes of crimson imparted an aspect of grandeur to their
persons, and of dignity to their deliberations ; while, at
coronations, their lofty brows were adorned and enriched by
coronets. Even in the most elaborately educated and utili-
tarian epochs, the wisdom of humanity has not despised the
pomposity of sonorous titles, or spurned the splendour of


ceremonial observances. The vulgar are commonly induced
by their natural logic to associate the realities of power with
the symbols it exhibits. In the latter half of the nineteenth
century the robes of the Peers seem seldom to have been
displayed; and more frequently adorned the pageant of a
play than the benches of their House. The patriotism of the
House of Commons was exhibited in zeal for party and
particular interests. The gas, railway, coal, legal, military
and Indian concerns, alike aroused the enthusiasm of those
members especially associated with the topic in debate. It is
our province to endeavour to throw a light upon these subjects
often obscured in mists too impenetrable to be pierced by any
but the indefatigable student, who may be content to devote
half a life-time to the perusal of ancient newspapers, printed
in the crabbed and eye-wearying type of the nineteenth
century; and who, by practice and unwearying assiduity may
learn to separate the rare grains of valuable matter from the
accumulations of chaff. When we consider that the mixed
mathematics were then studied by few boys and scarcely any
girls, that rare savans were alone acquainted with the eldest
sister of scientific languages, the Sanscrit; ?when we reflect
that the sexes, in Universities and schools, were retained
jealously aloof, we must be grateful for those links in the chain
of mundane causation which have occasioned our present
individuality in the twenty-ninth instead of the nineteenth
century of the Christian era ; when woman was still regarded
as a domestic drudge, and was still apparelled in skirts
without divisions.
CHAPTER 111.
DISASTERS AT THE CLOSE OF THE NINETEENTH CENTURY?THE FALSE
PROPHET MARCHES UPON EGYPT ?ABANDONMENT OF ITS DEFENCE
BY THE LIBERAL GOVERNMENT?INVASION OF EGYPT BY FRANCE
AND ITALY.
The materialistic world of Europe had beheld with interest
and indifference an amazing succession of blood-red or lurid


sunrises and sunsets, which ushered in the notable year of
1884. In the fanaticism which supremely ruled the Moham-
medan regions of the globe these manifestations in the sky
became dreadful portents, prognosticating the triumphs, or
terrors, of a sanguinary dispensation to the li'fidel. In the vast
and barbarous regions of the Soudan a Propl >. t had arisen, who
announced his mission as that of the last of 1 1: twelve Imams ;
the chosen guide of the faithful, the emissary of the holy prophet
of Mecca. With his army of fanatics he had annihilated an
Egyptian force of 10,000, with the enterprising and valiant
Englishmen who had commanded them. Allah appeared to
have declared, in this victory, the veracity of the Prophet?s
claim. He had even bestowed upon the rising sun the green
colour of Mohammed?s standard, a signal instance of his favour,
as noted in an epistle despatched from the unfortunate com-
mander of the expedition shortly before his disaster.
It had been foretold in the Koran that, in accordance
with the prophetic utterance of Haggai, equally revered by
Christians and Mohammedans, the guide and precursor of
the day of judgment should, in the fulfilment of time,
manifest himself in the East. It was declared in the Koran
that he should bear the sacred nomenclature of the Great
Prophet of Islam, govern Arabia, and fill the earth with
righteousness ; which signified the slaughter of the unbelieving.
He should triumph over Ed-daggal, the Mohammedan Anti-
christ. Gog and Magog, whose effigies adorned the Guild-
hall of London, should be released, and convulsions of the
earth, with terrible portents of fire and fury, announce the day
of judgment, and winding up of the world?s account. Then
would the angels support the faithful in their perilous passage
across the bridge which spans the awful gulf of Jehannum,
narrow as the edge of a scimitar. From this the millions of
unbelievers would topple, while the true Mohammedans would
pass to the supreme bliss of A 1 jannat, to make their ever-
lasting and delightful abodes, amid all the exquisite charms
of the gardens of Paradise ; where the faithful would repose by
purling streams, overhung with delicious fruits, where bowers


of pearl contained the abodes of lovely houris, and where
banquets would appear at the mere caprice of the believer.
Although his birthplace, upon the Nile, could scarcely be
consistently predicated as the cast of Egypt, in the slaughter
ol the Infidel, the true Moslem beheld assurance of the Divine
mission of Ahmed Mohammed?the Mahdi, or Guide. The
whole Arabian world was aroused to over-boiling fervour of
o
religious fury. The vast regions to the south of Egypt
exulted wildly in the approaching annihilation of all the
swine-eating intruders who had interdicted the slave-trade,
and deprived thereby the holy worshippers of Allah of the.r
fairest gains, lo the secret satisfaction, or sometimes openly
expressed contempt, of Europe, the Liberal Administration
refused to dispute possession of the Soudan with the Mahdi.
? The People?s William,? as he had been styled at one period
of his polemically-varied career, educated in the versatile
principles of nineteenth-century politics, rather than in the
dignified precepts of more ancient chivalry, only believed in
the virtue and necessity of war when victory might be pre-
dicted with confidence. He had denounced before his Mid-
Lothian constituents the atrocity of the campaign against the
Boers, continued it upon his return to power, on receiving
assurances that their submission might be confidently
expected, and again recognised its immorality after ascer-
taining the unerring execution of their rifles. Retaining all
the vivacity of youth at the age?usually considered mature
seventy-three, he had emulated the audacity of Beaconsfield,
and, upon what was deemed accurate information as to the
total absence of the military character amongst the Egyptians,
ventured to submit to the fortunes of war and bombard a
commercial city. But the despatch of a sufficient British
army to sustain the shock of the excited tribes of the Soudan
would, he apparently considered, in the increase of the national
expenditure, have alienated the affections of the British
shopkeeper from his Administration. In fatal supineness, he
attended to the whispers of Hope rather than the suggestions
of Facts, and discredited the reports of the rapid advance


of the Prophet upon Egypt. General Gordon, of distinguished
reputation for his power over these zealots of the desert, was
indeed despatched to Egypt, but arguments or the maxims of
Oriental diplomacy were too tardily offered. One hundre
and sixty thousand fanatical Mohammedans, inured to the
fierce climate of sub-tropical Africa, thirsting for death in
battle and the assured assuagement of the perfumed wine-
cup of Paradise, marched beneath the Mahdi?s banner upon
Eoypt, after the slaughter of various bodies of Egyptian
troops?. The British army, reinforced, amounted nomi-
nally to 6,000, but it had become diminished by disease
to 4,000. Sublimely disdaining, however, to dread an
undisciplined foe, these resolutely marched against their
fanatical opponents. Equal to ten of any civilised nation, the
Briton conceived himself equivalent to at least forty of a
barbarian enemy, and the result of the encounter was
anticipated without dismay. Breechloaders, however, had
become recognised by the followers of the Prophet, exhausting
heat and parching dust scarified the gallant but youth u
soldiers of England, and numbers overcame, though they
could not. disgrace, the valour of the British Empire On
the borders of Egypt proper the battle between the forces
of the British and the Mahdi began at sunrise, and at the
mid-day prayer the prostrate Mohammedan army returned
thanks for the addition of 4,000 to the eternal flames and
despair of Jehannum. In the British they believed them-
selves to have beheld the army of the arch-fiend L Tdagg >
who was confidently asserted in Islam to have been the
exceedingly benignant, clever, and gentleman y / cr
Edward, Prince of Wales and heir to the British throne. It
had been the fortune of Victoria, Empress oflndia, to e
adored by Hindus as an avatar, or descent of the Deity,
the aims of benevolence. It was the destiny of Albert Edward
I. to be regarded, in the Mohammedan world, as the demon,
correspondent with the Antichrist of Christendom. The dis-
appearance of this British force of 4,000 completely convinced
the Ministry of the injustice and inexpediency of continuing


the defence of Egypt; but the flame of martial ardour was
from" eX * mC ? " El,glanA A S eneral ousted

tion of defending Egypt from the fanatical assailant. The
iberal and Radical papers deprecated mildly the necessity
of war and suggested that the passage round the Cape of
Good Hope was reasonably sufficient communication with
Hindustan; or averred that all its wealth was not worth a
puddle of British blood.
CHAPTER IV.
ARM AM MOVEMENT IN england-the conservatives despatch
ARMAMENTS TO EGYPT DIFFICULTY IN RECRUITING FOR THE
ARMY AFTER VICTORIES AND LOSSES IN EGYPT? INDIA * ITS
PEOPLE AND TAXATION-RELIANCE UPON ITS ARMIES.
At this epoch, when England had reached and was declining
from the apex of her glory, the Brahmin-cozened Hindus
were already extensively emulated in the propagation of the
Placid precepts of abstinence from potent potations, and flesh-
pots. It may be a mournful, but it appears to be a salutary
and veracious reflection that the vigour and ferocity or
even steadfast valour, of mankind are extensively dependent
upon he voracity of their appetites. In an interesting
alimentary experiment it was observed that a pig nurtured


upon rum exhibited most bellicose propensities, that whisky
produced in another gaiety combined with a courageous
-demeanour, while gin imparted to a third an aspect of abject
melancholy. On rum the British sailors of the early part
of the nineteenth century had nobly sustained the honour and
interests of their country. In the later part of the century the
peaceful, often nerve-racking, stimulant of tea was the principal
beverage of England. The British army consisted of 197A' 4
officers and privates at the commencement of 1884. Of these
about one-third were in India, and six thousand had been
annihilated, or invalided, in Egypt. France and Italy landed
200,000 in Egypt before their disembarkation could be
prevented by the British fleet; which, however, gallantly
steamed to encounter the navies of the two countries.
Energetically and eagerly the Conservative English papers
urged strenuous war measures on the Government. Woolwich
resounded with the dreadful clank of mighty preparation.
Again the so-called reserves were summoned to complete the
skeleton regiments, and 20,000 soldiers were hastily embarked
for Egypt. India was ordered to despatch a second
army ; and -England confidently expected that General Lord
Wolseley would continue his career of victory, and return,
like Wellington, to occupy his seat in the House of Lords,
as a duke, after receiving promotion in the peerage for
successive victories. Escorted by the navy, which, in a short
and sharp engagement, had successfully rammed, jammed,
and battered to destruction or confusion the united fleets of
France and Italy, the 20,000 landed at Alexandria, under
cover of the guns of the ironclads. Again the British were
opposite their ancient foes, animated by the long list of
victories over them, emblazoned on the regimental colours,
no longer carried into the field. The superior numbers of
the enemy could not daunt the resolution, or curb the
fortunate career of Wolseley. After a prolonged and des-
perate encounter, the Latin races of the south of Europe
again recoiled before the resistless courage and resolution of
the Anglo-Saxon ; but not before the conquerors had been


half annihilated by their victory. Wolseley was created a
Viscount . every City Company which had not already
presented was emulous of offering to him its freedom. The
Conservative papers thrilled with warlike exultation. The
Liberal journals deplored the action of the Government in
allowing war to be declared, but admitted the valour and con-
stancy of their countrymen. Reinforcements were the demand.
And now could be diagnosed the first obvious symptom
of the decline of the spirit of the Empire. The pay of the
non-commissioned officers and private soldiers had been
doubled ; but the insidious encouragements which had long
prevailed in the Radical or Socialistic journals and clubs, of
Internationalism rather than of Patriotism, and of Communism
rather than the assertion of Individuality, at length 'bore
ripened fruits. The mild maxims, moreover, of total absti-
nence revolted from the ensanguined idol of war; and
proclaimed that peace at any price was holier and more
expedient than the mission of breechloaders. The combina-
tion of Communistic and Temperance principles presented
overweening obstacles to recruiting. The standard of height
was reduced to five feet two inches, and of chest measurement
to thirty-one inches and a half. Still were the battalions of
the British insufficiently reinforced; but the Empire found
consolation and exultation in the courage and fidelity of its
Indian mercenaries.
The advance, however, of the pretended Prophet of Islam had
awakened an echo in the hearts of the Moslem of Hindustan.
The pride of the Empire had assembled and united in
Durbars the warlike races which, in Rajputana, Hyderabad
or the Punjab, still afforded elements of valour and vig�ur.
The victories in Afghanistan under Sir Frederick Roberts
were acknowledged to have been extensively due to the
reliance which could be reposed in the northern races of
Hindustan, as well as in the hardy Highlanders of Great
Britain who bore the brunt of his campaign. So confidently
did England rely upon the devotion of India to her throne
that an army, composed of the greater number of the


European soldiers in the country, with an equal number of
the native warriors, was embarked at Bombay for the Red
Sea. Another army, partially consisting of the regular forces
in the service of the British, with the contingents of levies
lent by the semi-independent Rajahs of Hindustan, from
the 350,000 troops, of more or less effectively regulated
discipline, which were arrayed beneath their banners, was
ordered to Bombay. With such absolute confidence had the
British public begun to regard as inalienable the affections of
the Indian people, that the withdrawal of the greater portion
of the British troops from Hindustan was hailed with acclama-
tions. It was believed that the Sikhs would themselves
defend the Punjab against any invasion from Russia; while
the tributary Rajahs were accredited with passive, if not
delighted, acquiescence in the English suzerainty. Due con-
sideration was not bestowed upon the truism that human
nature can with difficulty condone the most virtuous and
enlightened conduct, while it conduces to constant and deep
inroads upon the pocket. With admirable order, and an
upright though expensive administration of justice, the
severity of - the British taxation had begun to reduce the
masses of the Indian people to one meal per diem, alternating
with starvation. But the greater number of the natives of
Hindustan were too patient and peaceful to entertain the
dream of revolt. The warrior class, commanded in the
higher grades by British officers, still seemed devoted to
their paymasters. The railways of India rapidly conveyed
an army of 100,000 for embarkation from Bombay. Amidst
the scarlet-blossomed avenues of the park-like plain between
the ancient fort and native city, arose the tents of this
variously-composed and picturesque array in which Rajpoots,
Sikhs, Goorkas, and Mohammedans of Hyderabad, were
fiercest and most powerful. Till Empire had been pro
claimed by England, the peoples of Hindustan, widely
separated by race and sympathies as Teuton, Latins and
Sclavs in Europe, possessed no bonds of union or cohesion.
They had since been taught to regard themselves as one


people, ruled by a mysterious and mighty potentate, of com-
plexion similar to that of their dread deity of dissolution,
Shiva; husband of the dark and terrible Kali, who was still
adored in sacrifices of blood. They had bowed in awe-struck
reverence before the dispensations of Destiny, which ordained
that they should be governed and taxed by a race alien to
themselves in sympathies, manners and constitutions. With
amazement and alarm, they beheld the women of England,
with the blood glowing through their clear complexions,
devouring, m what seemed the horror of cannibalism, the flesh
of the sacred cow, and, man-like, galloping their high-mettled
horses. The increase of the taxation had even extended
from about �27.000,000 in 1858, under the company
Sahib, to �72,559,978 m 1881, under the Empress. This not
unnaturally provoked the consideration that the blessings of
English Government, esteemed by many as doubtful, must be
confessed by all to be obtained at a price too considerable.
In 1881, as an instance, �62,183,808 of the revenue were
expended in India, while �14,420,525 were transferred to
England ; besides extensive sums which were indirectly
transmuted thither. The salt tax, which the authority of
William Pitt could not impose in Great Britain, had been
raised in India in 1881 to �7,115,988 from �5,996,595 in
lB l 2 ? , Men and cattle are aiike related to have severely
suffered from this impost. Salt pans, which could have been
anywhere established on the coast, became virtually prohibited.
ons of fish were stated to have rotted, because salt, in a
country wherein the labourer supported his family on 6s. per
month, could not be procured, when a pennyworth was
taxed two shillings. Cruel, but convenient, it could not be
abandoned by an executive which annually found itself more
onerously burdened with expenditure. In 1884 Hindustan
was simmering upon the smouldering embers of discontent *
ready to boil over, should any blast of political wind fan and
excite the fuel to flames, and the sensitive Indian temper to a
blaze. r


CHAPTER V.
REVOLT OF THE INDIANS ?AFFAIRS IN EGYPT ?DOWNFALL OF SALIS-
BURY, AND RETURN OF THE LIBERALS TO POWER?MIGHT OF THE
MAHDI AND SUBSEQUENT DEFEAT.
Bombay had long contained a seething hot-bed of Moham-
medan discontent. The presence of the vast array, com-
manded by a few British officers, revealed the power of the
native armaments of Hindustan. A descendant of the Nana
Sahib, who, in 1857, had in vain raised the standard of revolt,
was serving as a Havildar. A secret council and coalition of
Rajpoots and Mohammedans propagated sedition throughout
the army by the ready co-operation of the Bombay bazaars. At
a grand parade, when the whole army was to march past the
Governor-General, the signal was given by the firing of a rifle.
In an instant the British officials and officers were prisoners,
and the commercial wealth of Bombay was at the scanty
mercy of a soldiery, taught by the welding together of
the Peninsula to consider as a curse the Briton and his
collector Sahibs of revenue. Instead of the troops em-
barking for Egypt, they installed the Nana in the Govern-
ment House of Bombay ; and a glittering display of fireworks
proclaimed the independence of Hindustan after centuries of
conquest.
No longer had the British Empire the mere mutiny of an
army to encounter as in 1857* Not only the native warriors
of Bengal, but of the whole Peninsula were in speedy and open
revolt. A curtain may be discreetly drawn by history over
the horrors that ensued. Distracted by their difficulties
nearer home, the British were unable to bestow due and
expected attention upon the fortunes of their compatriots in
India. In Egypt, the British army, still inferior to the enemy
in numbers notwithstanding the Indian reinforcements, had
the double and difficult task of driving the Europeans into the
Mediterranean in the first place, and subsequently the Arabs
of the Mahdi into the Red Sea.


Victory was again achieved, but the campaign was san-
guinary, and the British reserves were exhausted. The
Conservatives appealed to the country upon the question of
conscription. The total abstainers, peace-at-any-price people,
communists and roughs of which only the last were comba-
tive, but preferring to encounter the defenceless?again carried
back the Liberals to power. They immediately proceeded to
offer a tripartite control for the administration of Egypt; and
the combined armies received and successfully sustained the
shock of the adherents of the Mahdi, who had again advanced.
Europe had in former ages, with difficulty opposed the
greed and bigotry of the Moslem. But the science of warfare
had become too powerful to be resisted by a valiant but
undisciplined foe.
The banner of the Mahdi for a time had been paramount
in the Mohammedan world, and frenzied prayers in all the
mosques acclaimed the approaching last days of the world,
nnd the descent from heaven of the prophet of l\lecca for the
establishment in bliss of the faithful, and eternal destruction of
the Giaour. But Russia was marching upon Turkey, while
Italian, French, and Austrian armaments reinforced the troops
in Egypt. The defeat of the Prophet?s forces was speedily
followed by his murder at the hands of his own fanatics as a
prophet of Ed-daggal, and not the inspired of Allah. The
armies of Europe assumed the Protectorate of Constantinople
and Egypt; while the Arabs retired into their deserts, and
awaited the manifestation of the true Prophet in the East ;
having now realised the birthplace of their effete Mahdi as
situated in the west.
CHAPTER VI.
ADVANCE OF THE POWERS?THE AMERICANS DESPATCH AN
ARMAMENT AGAINST IRELAND.
Emboldened by the supineness of the Liberal Government,
Italy, Spain, France and Germany had severally possessed


themselves without remonstrance of Malta. Gibraltar, the
Channel Islands and Holland. Austria relieved and disem-
barrassed England of her position in the tripartite control of
Egypt; profiting little after the abandonment of India.
A claim to South Africa having been advanced by the
German empire upon the contention that it formerly apper-
tained to the annexed Holland, the Foreign Office, under the
first Earl of Birmingham, discreetly acquiesced. Unable to
induce the Colonial Office to accede to their desire of
obtaining possession of New Guinea, our Australian ancestors
announced the drafting of the scheme of confederation which
has produced such fortunate and mighty results. _
At length the importunity and increasing political influence
cf the Irish in the United States prevailed upon the Americans
to despatch a fleet and armament to Ireland. The British
army had now the shores alone of the once United Kingdom
to protect, and even the Liberal journals proclaimed that
Ireland was to be defended and retained for England at
any cost or sacrifice. By a clever feint, the Americans were
successful in disembarking. The officers of the British
army had been interdicted against any enforcing of their
orders by corporal punishment. It must be confessed, to
the degradation of human nature, that the inspiriting or
animating results of alcohol, with the deterrent effect of
the lash, appear, in more ancient days, to have been effective
stimulants in the necessarily horrible profession of arms.
While refraining from detracting from the courage of tne
youthful soldiers of the short-service system, it may be
admitted that their nervous idiosyncrasies were less tenacious
than those of the older soldiers of Britain. Disregarding
the commands and example of their officers, a considerable
number of the troops executed a movement to the rear more
rapidly than the rules of correct strategy warranted, ike
position appeared to the British commander untenable
according to the theories of the best and most learned
military authorities. An armistice was speedily followed
by negotiations. For some time the Stars and Stripes and


Union Jack waved in harmony above the castle of Dublin
while the soldiers of the Republic and of the Empire
. ,ckered U P or fraternised over the teapot in correspond-
mg accordance beneath it.
CHAPTER VII.
IRELAND ABANDONED TO THE IRISH-REPUBLIC ESTABLISHED AND
DISSENSIONS BETWEEN THE ORANGE AND PAPAL FACTIONS-
PREPARATONS IN ENGLAND TO REGAIN THE EMPIRE OF THE
WORLD, BUT RAPID DETERIORATION IN CLIMATE BY THE
CHANGE OF THE COURSE OF THE GULF STREAM
A tkeaty for the cession of Ireland to the Irish was arranged
by the Earl of Birmingham with General Silas K. Washington
and Commissioner Jonnadab F. Lincoln. In April the
British and Americans evacuated the country amid howls
of hatred or derision and cheers of cheerfulness or con-
gratulation respectively.
At length Erin?s dream of ages seemed to have found
accomplishment. After the first death of England?s supre-
macy had been celebrated in a general ? wake,? with patriotic
songs, whisky and the shillelagh, an election for members
of the Irish senate was held amidst riots and even sanguinary
encounters throughout the country. *
The Papal and Fenian, as opposed to the Orange factions
were with difficulty averted from civil war. A brilliant and
impassioned, but virulent and vituperative, series of debates
in the Parliament, accompanied by duels in the Phoenix
Park, astonished or amused the world. The British House
of Commons was restored to early hours, and debates but
rarely rendered exciting by party recrimination, or such an
event as the personal struggle of Bradlaugh by force to
swallow, at the table of the House, the constitutional oath.
It rested and rejoiced in the phlegmatic calm usually
attributed to the national character.


With self-congratulations, the Liberal Administration
beheld and admired the settlement of the Irish question.
The next general election, however, displayed the dis-
satisfaction of the country in the return of the Conservatives
to power. Ominous whispers floated in the political air in
regard to the re-conquest of India, despite of Russia, and
of Ireland, despite of the protection of America. Meanwhile
an Act to secure the purity of malt and spirituous beverages,
and to encourage the institution of refreshment saloons rather
than drinking bars had restored conviviality without drunken-
ness to the British nation. The termination of the long reign
of Albert Edward 111. might have witnessed, in the vigorous
measures of the third Duke of Salisbury, a return to the
grandeur of the British Empire of Victoria. But physical
causes were at labour to undermine and sap the very vitals
of England as a centre of civilisation. A sudden divergence
of the Gulf Stream?the magnificent pipe of hot water, which
had for so many ages bestowed upon the British islands a
temperate clime?caused icebergs to blockade the northern
shores.
In the reign of Albert Edward VII., last English sovereign
of the dynasty of Guelph, the climates of Great Britain and
Ireland were precisely parallel with those of Labrador and
the Hudson Bay territory, which are within the same degrees
of latitude. A remnant of the people still procured a pre-
carious existence by the bounty of the summer s warmth , but
the British public had found its home in Australasia or
America. The Anglo-Saxon and Celtic races perennially
flourished ; but the British Empire had declined and fallen.
CHAPTER VIII.
ASPECTS OF LIFE IN THE VICTORIAN EPOCH?THE POPE REMOVES FROM
ROME TO MALTA.
It is not uncommon to encounter eulogiums of the past as
epochs of gold, while the present is deprecated as an age of


iron. But a conscientious perusal of British newspapers of the
nineteenth century will annihilate this illusion, and reveal
the indecency and confusion in life, political or social, emi-
nently calculated to produce serene content with our individual
period, and to dissipate the dream of the world?s happy middle
life. The Victorian authors not unfrequently descant upon
the superiority of their age, while every newspaper affords
testimony to its marvellous atrocities. The terrors of dynamite
had already become invoked by Nihilists and Fenians, and
scarcely less dangerous than their indiscriminate explosions
were the ordinary perils of the streets. The reckless and
rarely punished drivers of vans, omnibuses, and cabs wildly
scattered, or even fatally upset, the miserable foot passengers
jammed into the narrow thoroughfares of London. The
greasy mud, trampled by the throng of horses in the roadways,
and liquefied by every passing shower, afforded a filthy path-
way to the jostling crowds?in the case of the women, during
a great part of the century, bespattering and draggle.tailing
their long petticoats. As an alternative to the uproar and
confusion of the streets, the din, dirt, and darkness of the
underground railway might be selected. In those days the
locomotive poured forth its steam and smoke as it tore along
its iron rails in town or country. How different to the graceful
glidings of our modern aerial trains, passing with the swiftness
of thought from one to another tower station, rotating their
light pinions, and combining the celerity of the eagle?s flight
with the dexterity with which that bird swoops upon its prey.
Nevertheless, the progress of England in the Victorian
epoch had been very great, and far beyond anything that the
world had theretofore seen. Early in the second quarter of
the nineteenth century the adaptation of the steam engine to
propelling vessels ; the construction of railways, and the use
of the locomotive steam-engine thereon, gave an unpre-
cedented impetus to commerce and trade. Coal and mineral
fields were discovered, and mines opened. Iron works,
engineering and shipbuilding factories of great capacity and
with vast resources were established ; cotton mills arose as


by magic, and every industry in the country was in the fair
way of being prosperous beyond expectation. The owners
of these works and manufactories rapidly acquired wealth,
bought estates, settled down as country gentlemen, and
became the greatest patrons of art. But a certain class of
the community, animated by one idea or catch-word, ? Free
Trade,? soon endeavoured to put an end to this state of
things. Succeeding in abolishing all duties for the pro-
tection of native industry, they clamoured that every nation
should come in and partake of the prosperity of the manufac-
turers and producers who had worked and been successful in
England. In 1851 an Exhibition was held in Hyde Park, where
the foreigner was only too ready to learn everything that the
English could teach him, and he very shortly began to use his
knowledge and to compete with England in many articles.
The prosperity of the country was, however, proof against such
competition for many years, but Trades Unionism gradually
becoming an institution, workmen were encouraged to strike
for high wages and little work. After some years of waiting and
watching the frugal and industrious foreigner saw his oppor-
tunity, and was.able to establish works and industries capable of
competing with those of Britain. Under a Liberal Govern-
ment, elected in 1880, the decline in the prosperity of the
country went on rapidly. In Ireland agitators set up a
government of their own, and laughed at that of the State ;
the property of the landlords was confiscated under the
pretence of giving a right to tenants, who were endowed
with the further right of getting a court to fix the rent they
should pay. In England no interest was prosperous. The
landowners were in many cases brought to the verge of ruin,
the farmers were nearly all bankrupt, the great staple indus-
tries of coal, iron and cotton were all in a state of abject
depression. Capitalists were afraid to risk their money in
any adventure, and contented themselves with such interest
as they could obtain from the public funds. A vast mass of
the population, educated, not to work, but just sufficiently to
discuss, without understanding, politics and the mischievous


doctrines that any ? wandering star ? or ? cloud without water ?
might be spreading abroad, became the sport of one Henry
George?a professed land confiscator?and cf Liberal poli-
ticians, who tried to maintain themselves in power by the bait
of universal suffrage. Private enterprise, established under
Parliamentary sanction, was attacked, as in the case of the
Water Companies, and faith in Parliament and the class of
men who became members declined until, from these and the
reasons given in previous chapters, it was lost for a time
altogether.
The newspapers at the close of the nineteenth century
demonstrate the existence of the utmost ignorance, squalor,
and destitution amongst a great mass of the population, and
they also display the enormous fortunes accumulated by
several of the nobility. The Duke of Tyburnia, by whose
ancestor in the nineteenth century fields on the outskirts of
the fashionable quarter had been leased, and edifices allowed
to be erected on temporary ground rents, boasted at least ;�i,ooo
per day. Doubtless his private charities were excellent and
enormous, but the scrutinizing eye of the historian is unable
to discern any public gifts of munificence to the metropolis,
which had, by the enterprize of its citizens, accumulated the
riches flowing to his coffers. They had originally constructed,
and continued to pay for the mansions on his sites, by for-
tune or accident so favourably situated. Put in the twentieth
century, under the decreasing prestige of the Empire, and
the decay of commerce, the palatial edifices had already
begun to display symptoms of desolation. Already iron
steamers w ere rusting on the Thames, and grass was growing
in many of the lanes of the city. The decline of commerce
was exemplified in the elaborate but inconvenient Palace of
Justice. Suitors had become rare; and briefless barristers
mournfully meandered, like melancholy monks, amongst its
dim, deserted and intricate Gothic passages.
While England had been witnessing these changes, the
boasted Head of Christendom had also experienced the
vicissitudes of restless humanity. The Pope, unable to remain


with security and comfort in the pontifical chair, amid the
republican and latitudinarian tendencies of that epoch of Rome,
had been allowed to transfer his religious throne to Malta.
The Vatican was renewed in the palace of the Old Grand
Masters, and the restored Knights of St. John undertook the
duties, and emulated the fidelity of his ? noble and Swiss
Guards. The ancient and venerated statue of St. Peter was
removed from the magnificent basilica, which had received its
nomenclature from himself, to the more trustworthy shelter of
the stately Church of St. John in Valetta. Here, in the course
of centuries, it has lost or abandoned the appellation of St.
Peter, and assumed that of St. John. Report has affirmed
that it had originally borne a Pagan title before piety had
assigned to it the name of the great Patron of the Western
Church of Christendom.
CHAPTER IX.
DECLINE OF MANUFACTURES, AND SCARCITY OF COAL?RESULTS OF
FOREIGN COMPETITION.
The establishments of cotton mills in Europe, America and
in India itself, had ruined Manchester. Belgium had occa-
sioned a collapse in Birmingham. Coal and concomitant
iron works were also receiving a rapid development
throughout the world.
In England the final blow to greatness abroad, and
consolation at home, was received in the discovery that
the practicable limits of the coal-fields had been attained.
This mysterious and mighty source of Britain?s power
and importance?a small tax or export duty on every
ton of which sent out of the country from the years 1825 to
1880 would have paid off the National Debt?could no
longer be secured at a cost to compete with Austria,
America or China. In the severity of the English climate
it arose to famine prices.
With icebergs threatening the coasts, snow to the depth


of five feet in the London thoroughfares, and polar bears
selecting their abodes in the erstwhile deer forests of Scotland,
all the innate hardihood of the Anglo-Saxon race was
demanded for the contest against the forces of Nature.'
In the centre of the nineteenth century no proprietors, in
the history of the world, had ever considered their estates
more secure from depreciation than the landocracy of Great
Britain. Commerce had so enriched the traders, and attracted
to the country such perennial streams of wealth, that scanty
attention was bestowed upon the absorption of ancient
and rich rivers in the quicksands of foreign competition.
American and Australasian corn and meats were underselling
the products of English farms, and the Premier could only
recommend the farmers to utilise their capital in the extensive
manufacture of jam ; but this luscious conserve cannot be
constituted a universal nourishment. Towards the end of
the century many territories formerly distinguished for their
fertility, became choked with weeds, agriculturists thronged
the lists of the Court of Bankruptcy, and the landowners
became reduced to the painful process of parsimony. The
manufactures of England had become less remarkable for the
intrinsic excellence of their quality or the absolute correspon-
dence of bulk to sample, than for the laudatory and perplex-
ing placards by which they were advertised on railway stations.
Europe, America and Australasia overshadowed the ?tight
little island ? of shopkeepers, and also, it must be confessed,
of soldiers, sportsmen and senators. Fickle Fortune or
Time?s necessary changes brought decadence and desolation,
and the Liberal policy of enlightenment had ended in
obscurity.
CHAPTER X.
DEGRADATION OF THE OLD RELIGION AND PROGRESS OF SPIRITUALISM
IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY.
A CANDID, but rational inquiry into the debasement of the
ancient religion of civilization, and the establishment of


Spiritualism, may be considered an essential feature of the
history of the decline of the British Empire. Throughout
Europe an increasing section of the educated had begun to
regard with sceptical indifference the services of the Papal
altars. Positively asserting the all-potency of the Material
or abandoning themselves to the indifference of Agnosticism,
they beheld with scornful disregard the offices of the Priest-
hood. In England, the idol Respectability demanded from
its votaries an attendance at the Established Churches. The
less educated section of the population, excited by the wild
clamour of the ? War Cry? of a self-promoted General Booth,
fanatically enlisted in the ranks of an army of religious, or
perhaps blasphemous, zealots. Howling through the streets
their hymns of doubtful reverence, discordantly accompanied
by accordions, banjos and tambourines, they reduced the old
religion to the level of a barbaric fetichism. Meanwhile a
new and mysterious faith was fast gaining a position upon
the carpets of ordinary dwelling-houses. Assailed at first
with taunts, then obscurely continuing its advances and
attracting but scanty attention, it finally published the
leading journal, of Spiritualism on the site which had
witnessed the religious orgies of the Salvationists. After a
revolution of many centuries that system of communion
with the spirits in abeyance is still practised by the
inhabitants of Australasia ; the most distinguished portion ot
the human kind in science and learning, and the most
admirably versed in the arts of advertising and the sagacious
maxims of commercial morality. But the great law of
impartiality often obliges us to confess the suspicion of
artifice which rests upon the revelations of the earlier pro-
fessors. Transplanted from America, where the spicy nutmeg
was simulated in wood for the unwary purchaser, and the hour
in vain demanded of clocks which had lost, or never obtained,
the power to figure, it is reasonable to suppose that the first
seances in back parlours possessed no absolute immunity
from chicanery. The inquirer, moreover, encounters insuperable
difficulties in endeavouring to ascertain the precise period


at which the more extraordinary manifestations ceased. The
Australasian Spiritualist bases his belief upon the avowed
capacity of the mediums of the nineteenth century to elevate
themselves, or become exalted in the air by spiritual
assistance; yet would discredit and denounce as an impostor
any personage who should claim such prodigious powers in
the present age. Although credence is still bestowed upon
the efficacy of table-rapping, the ability of the spirit-possessed
tables to arise unaided in the air is rather retained in faith
as a mysterious dogma than accredited as a fact of modern
occurrence. In the twentieth century, after the abolition of
the Anglican communion as a State Church had aggrandized
the power of the Pontiff in Western Christendom, his bulls
were speedily and vigorously despatched to toss this religion
of the back drawing-room. But the spiritualistic priesthood
gradually grew to prominence; and the ? tail coat ? of the
nineteenth century is retained as the black and mysterious
garb of their hierarchy.
CHAPTER XL
FURTHER DEFLECTION OF THE GULF STREAM ?PROSPECTS AND
ASPECTS OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE IN THE 24.TH CENTURY
IHE THRONE OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE IS TRANSFERRED TO
AUSTRALASIA?CONCLUSION.
Again the mighty water-pipe which had diverted the northern
chills from Britain became further deflected. Ice-bergs
blockaded the Thames, and refused to melt beneath the in-
fluence of the sunshine of the summer. A bear was seen
and shot near the Royal Exchange. All articles of provision or
icfreshment, except iced-pudding and potations, had increased
in value. The successive Liberal Ad ministrations which ha dmis-
conducted the public service congratulated themselves,however
that the troubles ano dangers of colonies and military dependen-
cies were abated. In Australasia the great war of the Consti-
tutionalists and Republicans was drawing to a close. The


Powers of Europe and America were possessed of the fertile
colonial territories, or fortresses, formerly guarded by British
valour. From Windsor Castle, Albert Edward VII., enveloped
in furs, contemplated the hardy skaters on the Thames,
or the scanty labourers returning from their toil
upon snowshoes. Or perhaps he drove his team of rein-
deer over the gleaming expanse of Virginia Water. The
ruins of London in the twenty-fourth century are more
glorious in the boundless annals of time than the most superb
and highly-educated modern metropolis. The three great
periods of Imperial and Papal Rome are insignificant in all
their magnificence to the illimitable might and far-reaching
commercial influences of Lngland. Its decline and fall is the
grandest, perhaps the most awful, scene in the history of
mankind. In vain had Albert Edward VI. encouraged and
engaged the efforts of the science of the world to ascertain a
means of attracting to its ancient course the Gulf Stream.
The counter-attraction of the Panama Canal was too potent.
The drowning of the revered and regretted Holy Land of
Christendom in the engineering success known as the flooding
of the Jordan Valley, and the conversion of a desert into
the vcrdure-clad inland sea of Sahara, had for ever oeprived
Great Britain of warm water. In the twentieth century, science
and a statute of Parliament had lightened the obscurity of
the London fogs by enforcing upon the chimneys the
consumption of their own smoke. Heat generated by
electricity hindered for an interval the ravages of climate.
But the Arctic severities were irrepressible. Australasia,
Hindustan and China, Russia and Sclavonia, North and
South America and Africa, the still comparatively genial
South of Europe, and the hardy and chilling North, perused
with awe and amazement telegrams which proclaimed the
Fall of the British Empire. On December 3rd, 2488 A.D.,
precisely 800 years after the last of the Stuart dynasty had
relinquished the English throne, Albert Edward VII., at the
invitation of the Australasian Imperial and Constitutional
Parliament, abandoned Windsor Castle, crossed the British


Channel on sledges, with his retinue, and, by the railroad of
the Euphrates Valley and a special electro-ship, arrived, and,
amid enthusiastic acclamations, inaugurated the prosperous
and fortunate dynasty of his family in the regions contemptu-
ously or carelessly termed by the British of the Victorian
era their Antipodes. A hardy race still contends, amongst
the desolation of the ancient centre of the British Empire,
against the constant annexations of the polar bear. The
avocations of whaling and seal-fishing as well as melting, for
pomatum and other domestic institutions, the bear?s grease
constitute the meritorious but simple occupations pursued
by the inhabitants, on the ruins of the political, scientific, legal,
literary, religious, and social grandeur of Great Britain.
The journals of opposing political factions reveal the
damages which successive Administrations were imposing
upon the Imperial constitution before the coming of the
catastrophe which no human ingenuity could avert. Art can
construct monuments more durable than the narrow span
of a lifetime, often dyspeptic and disappointing in the
intellectual turmoil and competition of modern political and
social economics and meanderings. Still must man?s most
durable memorials be measured as a fleeting moment in the
geological and astronomical periods of our macrocosmic
science. Human nature retains many of her imperfec-
tions ; and while the historian applauds the importance and
variety of his subject, the reader may ascribe his facts
to fancy, and condemn as conjectures the conclusions culled
from the comprehensive conservatory of universal history.
It was in gazing on the grey sky through the ruined
dome of St. Paul?s that I first conceived the idea of
this work immortal in the grandeur and sadness of
its topic. It was in contemplation over a broken arch of
London Bridge that I finally determined to educe ray design.
However inadequate it may be to my own desires, I finally
deliver it to the curiosity and candour of the public.
