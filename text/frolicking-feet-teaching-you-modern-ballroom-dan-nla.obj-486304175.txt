Here is just how it # s done. Get this picture in
your mind's eye and you have the correct
way to hold your partner.
"GRACEFUL"—Isn't it?


LADIES who wish to "appear attractive" danc-
ing well is just as essential as their visits to a
"Beauty Salon."
There is no excuse in the world for a lady not
knowing how to dance. Wallflowers are out
of style—she's the girl who cries after a party
because she did not enjoy herself, yet too lazy
to do anything about it.
Be really Graceful —be Light—be Smooth-
do not drape yourself over your partner's
chest —it simply ruins the look of your best
frock.
Please do not encircle your partner's neck
with your left arm, it's a public demonstration
of affection — wait till you're going home!
Do not leave your make-up on your partner's
coat, it's hard to brush off and very difficult
to explain away.
GENTLEMEN, remember your ability on a
dance floor makes your company, from a
lady's point of view, anything from pleasure
to torture.
Dance well —take the same interest in being
perfect on the dance floor as you would in
your business.
Dance well and you walk well.
Walk well and you look well.
How you dance that's just how you'll walk
through life—bright, happy, alert—or just
anyhow.


THE QUICK STEP.
One of the easiest and oldest of all Dances,
and so simple— here's how:
Quarter Turn—Gentleman.

left foot.

right foot and turn on the ball of your foot

your left foot.
Four —Close your right foot guickly up to
your left foot, still on your toes.
Five —Step to the side guickly on the ball of
your left foot.
Six —Step back slowly on the ball of your
right foot, dropping your left heel.
Seven —Close your left foot guickly back to
your right foot, turning guickly to the left
on your right heel.

MEMORISE THESE.
Rhythm is that delightful individual expres-
sion that a dancer puts into his (or her) steps.
Remember, you cannot have rhythm dancing
out of time.
Basic Steps of dancing do not change—they
are the poetry of motion.
Tempo is the speed of the music—the number
of bars played to the minute.
Just be your natural self.
Relax your muscles.
Breathe naturally.
The unwritten law of ballroom dancing is
"ETIQUETTE."
Your legs should be used to carry your body
gracefully, smoothly, and without effort.
Closely follow directions and carefully study
each diagram, and you'll find it so simple.
You wonder why it's necessary to write a
book about it.


BALANCE.
The greatest essential to the making of a good
dancer. Note how the weight of the body is
forward, both for the lady and gentleman.
"THAT'S REALLY ARTISTIC."


Ballroom Dancing is an art, the teaching of it
a science.
Its finest exponents and teachers in Australia,
from a lifelong study, have made it possible
for "Frolicking Feet" to place the art of Ball-
room Dancing at your disposal. Accurately
described in each article, correctly shown in
each diagram.
"They Are Correct."
Everybody does the Fox Trot these days in
one variation or another.
Some are even invented on the spur of the
moment.
Make yourself familiar with the walk and
Three Step. Practise, master them —it's easy.
Almost every variation introduced into the
dance is made up of these two steps.
Go straight into a Feather Step after any
change in your direction on the dance floor.


THE QUICK STEP.
This photo, shows to you, clearly, the correct
position of both lady and gentleman on the
fifth step of the Quarter Turn.
Study closely, visualise —IT'S CORRECT.


LADIES, in the privacy of your own room,
with the radio going, practise walking back-
wards. NO! Don't walk, "just glide" back-
wards—get control of your own feet first, they
will then refrain from stepping on your part-
ner's. Take long steps. Practise and practise
until you can glide perfectly. The girl who
can take nice long steps backwards without
losing her balance, can follow her leader
easily. Get smoothness into your step. "Get
that reverse motion off pat."
Your feet should be perfectly straight; don't
turn your toes out, and always keep your
weight forward towards your partner.
GENTLEMEN, be thoughtful and considerate;
do not sit down after a dance or at supper until
your partner is seated.
If it's a toss-up between dancing and talking
when you are on the dance floor, then "just
dance."
Hold your partner firmly, but without strain or
effort —your right hand just under her left
shoulder blade, your right elbow slightly
raised to ensure freedom.
Do you know what causes a dancer to tread
on his (or her) partner's feet when moving
forward? It's just this— keeping your weight
back instead of forward.

THE WALTZ.
This dance has passed through many phases.
It's the oldest and most beautiful of them all,
so please do not let it be said you cannot
"WALTZ.”
Forward Change—Gentleman.
One —Step forward on the heel of your left
foot, turning both your body and your
foot slightly to the left.
Two —Step to the side on the ball of your right
foot.
Three —Close your left foot up to your right
foot and rise on both toes.
Four —Step forward on the heel of your right
foot, turning both your body and your

and all done slowly.
The forward change is the Basic Waltz Step.
Learn to do this perfectly, and you are already
on your way.

Listening to "waltz music" being played, it is

THE SLOW FOX TROT.
This tells you, step by step, how to do each
movement. Practise until you get each move-
ment in your feet" without thinking about
them. The steps are long, each slow step is
given two beats of the music, while each
guick step is given one beat of music.
Feather Step—Gentleman.
One-Step forward slowly on the heel of your
right foot, rising on the ball of your foot.

Three Step forward guickly, still outside
your partner, on the ball of your right
foot.
Four —Step forward slowly on the heel of
your left foot, in front of your partner, and
then follow with the three step.
Now you see just "how simple" this is, turn
over the page and master the next step, the
"Three Step."

Feather Step—Gentleman.
This is just Walking smoothly but
must have a touch of FEELING and
be done GRACEFULLY.

length forward steps fitted into four beats of
music.
One —Step forward slowly on the heel of your
left foot, rising onto the ball of your foot.

position of both lady and gentleman on the
second step of Rumba Walk.
"IS THAT CLEAR?"


The Lady's Hold for all Modem Ballroom
Dances.
Stand in a perfectly natural and erect position,
head naturally poised, looking over your
partner's right shoulder. Raise the right hand
to the same level as your partner's, keeping
the palm of the hand downwards; the right
arm should be bent slightly at the elbow.
Raise'the left arm and place the hand with the
fingers close together, either on the back of
the man's right shoulder or on the back of the
man's right upper arm. Both elbows should
be kept well up, without, of course, raising the
shoulders.
Never attempt to lead or guide your partner
in any way. Submit yourself entirely to him.
Do not lean on him, or anticipate what is com-
ing next. Just follow.


HOW TO CONSTRUCT DANCES.
The Quick Step.
Try to do as few walks as possible between
the different variations.
The first variation of the Quick Step should be
the Quarter Turn—this being done first, that
is, as soon as you commence dancing.
Now as soon as you finish one Quarter Turn
you go straight into it again.
When you do the Zig Zag as described, you
make the last step of a Quarter Turn the first
step of a Zig Zag.
Immediately you reach the end of the ball-
room comes the Natural Turn, which gives
you your turn so as to keep you moving in
your line of dance. On completing the Natural
Turn you go straight into your Quarter Turns,
making the last step of the Natural Turn the
first step of your Quarter Turn. And these
steps are repeated in their order.
The correct time for a Quick Step is 4/4 time.
Tempo, 50 bars per minute, each Quick Step
taking 1 beat of music, and each Slow Step
taking 2 beats of music.


How to Construct a Slow Fox Trot.
Commence with a Feather Step. This is then
followed by a Three Step. These two steps,
the Feather Step and Three Step, are repeated
the length of the room. But when the end of
the ballroom is reached, the Natural Turn is
done. Lead in to this step from a Three Step.
Then when the Natural Turn is completed you
make the last step of the Natural Turn the first
step of the Feather Step, and so on till you
reach the next corner of the ballroom, when
the Natural Turn is repeated.
Now the correct time of the Slow Fox Trot is
as follows: Time 4/4. Tempo, 33 bars per
minute, each Slow Step taking 2 beats and
each Quick Step taking 1 beat.


How to Construct a Waltz.
The easiest way to dance a Waltz is to begin
with the forward change, then when you
reach, say, half-way along the ballroom, you
can do a Reverse Turn, after which you con-
tinue with your Forward Change until you
reach the end of the ballroom, then do the
Natural Turn and follow on again with the
Forward Change and Reverse Turn in
seguence.
The timing of the Waltz is very easy, each step
taking one beat of music.
The tempo of the Waltz is 36 bars per minute
and time 3/4.
How to Construct the Rumba.
First commence with the Rumba Walk, going
to about halfway along the ballroom, then you
can do the Rumba Reverse Turn. On com-
pleting this, repeat with the Rumba Walk.
On reaching the end of the ballroom you do
the Natural Rumba Turn and repeat, circling
the ballroom.
This is a very fascinating dance once the
rhythm is mastered.
