EDITORIAL.
In presenting "THE BUGLE CALL," which is one of
the grandest collections of literary Gems yet published at
Sea, the Editor most emphatically announces, that he will
not take responsibility for it's production nor apologise to
any person for any article printed herein. Be gentle,
patient reader!
After many stormy days and nights during the opening
stage of our journey, which floored some of the best amongst
us, we ran into delightful weather, which many complained
was too hot. But when one is surrounded by azure skies of
gentle tints of blue and green, by the velvety smoothness of
the limitless ocean, by flying-fish and other wonders of the
deep, visible and invisible, and when one views the fiery sun-
sets which gild the Heavens with gold and silver-rays, turning
at last into mauve, should we not rather be thankful we are
allowed to view such wonders? How much we have to
endure before we see the sight again, can none of us foretell,
may we all have that privilege.
A claim is made that these pages represent a thoroughly
pleasant voyage under the guidance of that popular Ship
Master, (Capt. Brown), and his ever obliging officers and
crew. We shall all look back in days to come when we are
hard at it somewhere at the front and wish.
The Editor thanks Mr. Perkis, Chief Steward, for the
loan of the Printing press, also all his many associates and
contributors (chief among them being Sergeant-Major F. H.
Choate and Pte. Blair) for their ready assistance, and more
especially the two compositors, (Pvtes. Craddock and
Cooper), who toiled in the heat, day in and day out, in
producing the "Mokoia Chronicle." We wish them one and
all health, success and honour, likewise the gallant Twelfth
in the great adventure.
THE RAMADAN FAST
(By the Padre)
As it is likely that we shall soon be in the midst of
Mahommedan people, a brief description of one of their
principal religious observances may not be out of place.
Their chief religious ceremonies are public worship on
Friday (their Sabbath), for men; Prayers, five times' daily;
Almsgiving (not for the sake of charity but for merit);
fasting; and a Pilgrimage to Mecca.
The first year in the Mahommedan calendar is our 622
MB. Their year is several days shorter than ours, and
they are now in the thirteen-hundreds, dating from the flight
of the prophet Mahommed. Their great fast occupies a month
and will soon commence. It is called Ramadan, and it comes
every twelfth moon. It is most trying when, as at present,
it comes in the heat of the summer; for the people, other
than children and women in delicate health, may not eat nor
drink between sunrise and sunset during that month. The
fast begins the morning after the new moon appears. But
the Mahommedan will not trust man-made calendars for the
time of the new moon. Men are sent out into the desert
evening after evening until they can officially report they
have seen the new moon. The news quickly spreads and
next morning the fast begins.
It has its inconveniences for employers of labour, servants
and coaling coolies. The men get more tired than usual
during the day for want of food and drink. Their siesta is
longer than at other times. Other than that, the only effect
upon the dusky Arab himself is that he turns day into night
and night into day. At sunset a gun is fired and the children
rush home from play in the clapping their hands and
shouting. Then feasting begins, first of all sherbet and
coffee, then square meals and amusement at intervals
through the night, till at sunrise another day of fasting and
drowsiness begins. It is stated on good authority that the
Arabs and Egyptians eat more, drink more, work less, spend
more, and do more shopping and entertaining during the
Fast of Ramadan than during any other month of the year.
Then when the month of fasting is up there follows the
Eeast or Festival of Bairam. The people put on their best
and grandest colours; the youngsters have new ribbons and
they troop off to spend sundry Milliemes and half-Piatres on
Turkish Deligjht, sugarcane and tumble-down Merry-go-
Rounds, Swing Boats or Gippy donkeys. So ends the
Ramadan Fast.
Our Christian religion teaches us to render our hearts
rather than our garments and to fast, not so much by
weakening the body as by breaking the bonds of oppression
and abstaining from the indulgences and practices, which
would unfit us for the highest service to God and Humanity.
INTER UNIT SONG.
You shan't come and play on our deck
on the cold and stormy day.
You'll be sorry when you see me
seltered from the wind and spray.
But when "Old King Sol" starts ablazing
and makes our side infernal hot,
We want to come on your nice cool side,
and we cannot see why not.
THREE GOOD YARNS.
Why! Corporal, exclaimed the alert 0.5., aren't You
ashamed to be caught smoking that vile cigarette?— Sure,
Sergeant, replied the N.C.0., blowing out a ring of smoke'
but you see the officer, who dropped it, had no taste for
tobaccer.
Seregant Choate, how much is ham and eggs? "Mother
Hubbard, 2/6 d. Ho you raise the eggs yourself? Oh, yes!
Ham and eggs was 3/6 d. last trip and I made good profits."
Chief Steward, Mother Hubbard has lost all her Mess
Money.
Q.M.S. Hope, but I thought she was a Napoleon of
Finance.
Chief Steward, She was, but she met her Waterloo, when
Wellington turned up."
COLONEL C. M. G. ON DRILL.
(By one who knows Him).
Colonel G., late of the Royal Refusiliers, sat in his
favourite chair at the Royal Oak. At his elbow was a small
glass containing his other favourite; near by sat his old


friends. Major Tom and Capt. Dicky, an ever-appreciative
audience, which always managed to get the Colonel worked
up on the subject of Drill, his pet aversion. They waited
with baited breath for him to speak.
Major Tom, quite by accident, remarked upon the
gallant old Refusies and detailed several of the well-known
yarns which he had many and many a time heard the
Colonel himself relate.
The Colonel's eye grew bright and he sat up in his chair.
"By the bye," he remarked, "do you remember when I
was Adjutant of the Regiment? No, possibly you don't.
Bay Jove! I shall never forget the day when, in the heat of
battle, I introduced one of the finest Infantry moves that
ever was. It suddenly occurred to me. I gave the beggars
Change front half left on the centre of the Company ! Well
—even I was surprised."
"I never knew the really great days of Drill," went on
the Colonel, as in a dream, "I never had the privilege of
ordering a Kegiment in line to counter-march by grand sub-
divisions, but it can be done. Have you, by the way, seen
the little Infantry Drill Book, 1916? It might be better
called Graveyard of all Drill . Their idea of Drill is
ridiculous. For example, they are taught the command
I.ine that hank or Extend along that hedge , where, as you
know, it ought to be that we should march up, hundred to
the minute, having sent our our markers so that the whole
Company is properly dressed up."
" Good Lord, Line that hank, indeed !" repeated the
gallant Colonel, "it reminds me of that parade at Spion Hop,
when the G.O.C. wanted to test the new drill. When the
Brigadier was ordered to shake his Battalion into open order
he turned round to his men and bawled out, Scatter like
Haymakers, you fools and go to blazes !"
"I hear in this new fandangle there's no front rank or rear
rank, and a Company faces always at the same time. And
it is particularly impressed upon all officers that no severe
language must be used. Why, damn my wig and buttons,
half the polite phrases the "tin hats" used to use were
spontaneous combustion. There is now no exercise with the
bayonet and no Fire drill. A silly young ass of a Staff
Captain had the damned insolence to tell me to my face
that we and the Patagonians were the last two races that
went through a War dance with fixed bayonets."
"Line that hank, indeed !! The British Army never
held up its head since the day the old stock was abolished,
and, if you take the average Regiment, it cannot perform
even the simplest evolution, such as From the right,
Company dismiss ! or Advance in column of lumps ; and,
from what I see and hear, a Company at drill in Trentham
or Featherston conducts itself like a Dames' School at a
pic-nic."
"But, sir, you must admit that the boys can still fight
some," incautiously interjected Major Tom.
" Good Gawd-on Highlanders! What's fighting to do
with it ?" exploded the Colonel, "It's Drill and nothing but
DRILL, we're discussing 3 and allow me to inform you that
Drill and Fighting aren't quite Ihe same. Line that hanky
indeed !!! Dicky, I'm damned diry I Hearing two fellows
life you discussing a subject neither of you knows anything
about is enough to make anyone dry."
The waiter shortly appeared, and, after Major Tom had
satisfied the request to "Sign here," Captain Dicky
proceeded to analyse the stuff in the glasses. Everything
being satisfactory the three wet their parched throats,
toasting "New Zealand's Embryo heroes,"
'' Here you are ! Mokoia Chronicle !''

IT'S A LONG WAY TO BERLIN, BOYS!
On to Transport Fifty-two,
Came J. Company one day.
All were out to do their best,
So our 0. C. was gay.
They swung along at such a pace,
Each man was for himself,
To make the Unit famous
In the good old fighting Twelfth.
Chorus
It's a long way to Berlin, Boys;
It's a long way to go.
It's a long way to Berlin, Boys,
But we're on our way, you know.
Good-bye, dear old Wellington,
With all its girls so fair,
It's a long, long way to Berlin, Boys,
But we'll get right there,


When they land on German soil,
To do their little bit,
They'll stop the Kaiser's onward march
And prove they're made of grit.
They'll fight for Honour, God and Right
And play the game right through,
Tey'll bring the Kaiser to his knees
And make him cook our stew.
Chorus :

would like to sing the pathetic ditty is unacquainted with
the tune they are invited to make their complaint known to

THE SHIP'S FUNMUNGERS.
At the commencement of our voyage a meeting was
called to form the various Committees to cater for the ship's
amusement. The popular Padre, Capt. Blamires, was (ex-
officio) a member of each and his past experience
on transports proved of inestimable value to all and sundry.
The "Entertainers," under the leadership of Lieut.
Carter, with the help of Corpls. Crowther (of Comic Song
fame), Rukingi (the Boxing Maori Songster), and Privates
Boagie (Pianist), Roiall (Conductor of Orchestra) and
Carlyle have given us some real fun, combined with
exceptionally good items by various clever artists.
Lieut. C. G. Johnson, in conjunction with Sergt.-Major
Choate, Pvt. Bailey (Librarian) and Pvt. Ahuriri are in
charge of the Library and Games Dept. Capt. Blamires
happily obtained from the Y. M. C. A. the use of a Library
of 500 new books and' some scores of games, these being
greatly appreciated by all.
Capt. Bax kindly undertook the presidency of the Sports
Dept. Lieut. Overton and a large Committee consisting of
Sergt.-Major Rees, Sergt.-Major McCartney, Sergts. Eoterts,
Robertson, Scott, Martis and Dickenson and Pvtes. Blair,
Wilkinson, Peach, Bundle, Carr and F. S. Smith, Manu and
Wirapa are his deputies.
Separate accounts of the efforts of this Committee are
given, from which it will be seen they have acquitted
themselves well in their strenuous work. To add to the
interest in the events, it may be added, the sum of £l3 was
collected for prizes in the Boxing and Tug-of-War items.
As we have only completed part of our journey, we are
all looking eagerly forward to any future events our
"Funmungers" may dish up.
At the time of writing initiated members of various
Committees are sitting with heads together and there is an
air of mystery about them. I hear on the Q.T. they are
organizing the reception of Father Neptune, for and on
behalf of the majority of us —classically termed, "The
Great Unwashed" this afternoon.
"MEDPY."
CROSSING THE LINE.
NOTICE.
To Ye Unwashed.
KNOW ALL YE PEOPLE
Father NEPTUNE has notified His intention to board
this Ship with His Court and Myrmidons at 2 p.m. today, and
hereby issues HIS ROYAL COMMAND to those, who have
not heretofore entered HIS DOMINIONS TO PRESENT
themselves to HIS MAJESTY at that hour.
(§ignod) Apiusbite;
Secretary.
Ye Royal Seal of Ye Kingfishes.
Seated at my roll-top desk, serenely contemplating the
growing pile of manuscripts which the Editor had asked me
to read through on his behalf, I was rudely disturbed by
wierd noises proceeding from somewhere overhead.
On reaching the upper deck I found an argument in
progress as to whether the conglomeration of sound proceed-
ing from a number of most peculiar instruments, played by
a very cosmopolitan collection of non-descripts, was supposed
to be the National Anthem or "Tipperary." I personally,
am of opinion that the noise was some kind of a parody on
"To halt, on the left, form Platoons."
However, all this is by the way, as I set out to write on
the visit of Father Neptune to the Transport and, as time is
pressing, I cannot afford to disgress.
I may say, though, the noise already complained of was
caused by the Band (?) which was accompanying His Royal
Shyness on his tour/ of the ship. At one time it occurred to
me that His Consort looked extremely annoyed when some-
thing that sounded more or less like, "Rule Brittania" was
played by the alleged musicians, and in conversation with
Her afterwards she confessed that She questioned the accuracy
81 tbl lIIIFfe Pflg,!B son f- rs " Ne P- rules Old Father,
and if He didn't rule, at least today, some of fiie wBvB§,
who did?
Another thought that struck me —several things such as
boots, bayonets, manuscripts and bully beef, have struck
me very forcibly since I became a scribe—was the fact that
Old Neptune seemed to find something familiar in the Haka
with which the Maori Contingent welcomed him. Now
there has been frequent discussion as to the Maori race, and
in view of what I have already stated I am inclined to agree
with those who argue that the Maoris are Sons of Sea Cooks.
lTowever, I now intend to give an account of the
celebrations enacted.
Punctually at 2 p.m. the Royal Progress started round
the Ship, watched by a cringing crowd of Camp followers
and Unwashed. There was many a backward glance and
fearful look* the proud and mighty bearing of Neptune Rex
striking terror into the hearts of the stoutest. Having
arrived at the Royal dais, which was in close proximity to
the ducking pond, the following Proclamation was read :


PROCLAMATION
KING NEPTUNE.
Oyez ! Oyez ! ! Oyez ! !!
HEAR, all ye Sailormen and ye Landlubbers now sailing
the High Seas in the good ship "MokoiaHear, I say,
the WILL and MESSAGE of the great KING NEP-
TUNE, Lord of the Seas and Ruler of the Great Deep.
I KING NEPTUNE, do hope and believe that the message
sent this morning from my deep sea Palace to my
worthy messmate, Captain Brown, has already been made
known to Ye.
.N OLDEN TIMES, as my friend, your Commander has no
doubt told Yei, my QUEEN and myself, with my merry
Men of the Deep Sea, were wont to come aboard all
passing Ships without notice, and forthwith proceeded
to baptise, in our rough and reiad'y way, all such Voyagers
as had never crossed the LINE before. These dear old
Sea-dog Days, alas, are past, in some ways at least. As
my QUEEN is present to-night, I wish to assure Her
that now I never trouble abount YOUNG LADIES!
Oh! what I once did in days gone by,
as I reminded my dear old friend,
Captain Brown, in my Marconi message,
this morn, but let that pass,
'Tis another story I
Not only do I now leave the ladies politely alone, but, of
course, I never trouble those, who have passed through my
Dominions before. ALL THAT I DESIRE TO DO is to
baptise them, and thereafter my QUEEN and MYSELF will
confer on them the famous ORDER OF THE FREEDOM
OF THE DEEP.
LONG LIVE THE KING OF THE WAVES!
As Witness my Hand
and Seal, this
thirty-first day
of May, One
thousand Nine
hundred and Sixteen.
L. S.
Next followd the Court of Judgment, and as each
culprit was condemned, he took his dose of medicine, was
lathered, shaved and ducked. (It was noticed that the
lather was a lovely shade of pink and that the razor had a
stelly glint whose edge was kept keen by the barber
vigorously stropping it on a well seasoned bit of rope.)
The initiation of our worthy (?) officers was a sight for
the Gods, Major Evans taking to the water like the duck he
is followed in quick succession by a quaking string of more
or less incompetent juniors.
MAJOR EVANS. —That he does persistently smoke Khan-
teen C'gars and trys to obtain and smoke them without the
Management knowing.
LIEUT. FINLAY.— (Of Artillery Fame.). Then he did
attempt to spike the Guns, while off duty, in Wellington
some three weeks ago. He is still unrepentent.
LIEUT. BROWN. —Charged with, while of unsound mind,
wandering about in an aimless maimer, trying to find "The
Lost Chord." fUmv;
LIEUTS. JOHNSTONE AND JOHNSON. —Charged with
deceiving the general public by attempting to pass themselves
off as each other.
LIEUT. LIVINGSTONE. —Charged with sleeping when off
duty and never being awake while on duty. He has
repeatedly been warned.
LIEUT. BREMNER. —Charged with sleeping on deck without
a licence or without a tail light.
BIEUT. PENNEFATHER. —Charged with wilfully and
repeatedly attempting to exterminate Neptune's subjects by
adding to their diet.
LIEUT. CLARK-WALKER. —Charged with rocking the boat
m an unceremonious way and consigning well-wisher to the
depths of the ocean.
CAPT. BREWSTER AND LIEUT. KEBBELL. —Charged with
attempting to get into the same hammack at the same time,
and making false statements as to the ownership.
LIEUT. SCOTT. —Charged with representing himself to be
a Scot when, in reality, he is a N. Z. Irishman, born in
Tumbuctoo.
LIEUT. COMER. —Charged with wearing a "Bobby's" lid
in the most cock sure manner; getting nasty about its
origin.
LIEUTS. OVERTON AND KAURAUITI. —Charged with being
unconscious as to their surroundings while on a recent parade
and abusing Neptune.
CAPTS. BREWSTER AND REID. —Charged with collectively
obtaining the use of what is known as "The Bridal Cabin"
for the voyage, and squaring the Ship's Boy not to give the
show away: .
* , ■ - J ■ *
This completed* the Officers, and next we had a quick
succession of valiant N. C. O's and men.
Our Ship's Q.M.S. Hope, for being above receiving
Charity, was then sentenced. Q.M.S. King now took the
plunge, but deciding that things were unsanitary, endea-
voured (as is usual) to make a hurried exit, which
intention was frustrated by the vigilance of thei Water
Police. Sergt.-Major Green's charge we were unable to
hear but in any case his name libels him and he deserved all
he got. A Sergeant (the Canteen's most serious rival on
board) was ordered to remove the Moss, that has been adorn-
ing him since fresh-water baths have become unfashionable,
by indulging in a scrub. Another Sergeant, who we have
always thought is English, was dealt with by His Majesty,
but if our surmise is correct, how did he get to N. Z. origin-
ally without traversing Neptune"s domains?
After this, the guilty ones were dealt with in a hasty but
effective manner, and the fun was fast and furious. It was
a disappointment to many, that our overwrought Editor didn't
oblige, and it can only be supposed, that it was because he
knew the ropes, and that the organisers of the celebrations
wished to be in his good books.
Our eternal thanks are due to the help we obtained from
Mr. Cordy, First Officer, Mr. Nicholson, the Bo'sun, Mr. Mas-
kell, his mate and Mr. McMillan, the ship"s Carpenter, and
those members of the Ship's crew, who tugged themselves
up and made us laugh. (Was Mr. Unsworth's violin out o.
tune?) What we want to know is where was Padre Blamires\
somebody suggested he was Lord High Goldstick in Waiting
—maybe!
The Entertainment Committee are to be warmly con-
gratulated on the unique success of the Show; it must have
been an eye-opener to some. £B. 10s. Od. was subscribed by
the Officers and presented to the Bo'sun and crew in
recognition of their worthy assistance.
LONG LIVE NEPTUNE!


One haileth from a Southern town
Well noted for its "wowsers."
But he is white, (though surnamed BROWN),
Down to his very trousers.
He's Adjutant on this old boat;
At work he is a snorter.
The silvery notes flow from his throat,
But what flows in—just water?
We think in Invercargill fair,
They'll welcome his returning,
For in the game he'll do his share,
All shabby tactics spurning.
The shorter one is the Director
Of the doings of our band;
And the strains, (like unto nectar),
Sweeten up when he's on hand.
If you know Lieutenant CARTER,
(Not the one-time famous Nick),
You'll agree that he's a starter
ID the race that's labelled chic.
J. Company—assorted crowd—
Will be there when something's doing,
And of their O. C. they'll be proud
Even when trouble's brewing.
CROSSING THE LINE.
(With Apologies).
Sunshine and blooming hot,
For we are at the Line.
Oh, may old Neptune put me on the mat,
That I may dip in brine.
Good! now they call the roll,
In tones of deepest bass,
Ah! there they take another sweating soul,
His majesty to face .
At last my name they cry.
My trial does begin;
"Guilty, your worship" is my fainting sigh
I'ts great—l tumble in.
Again, old King Sol's ray,
And for a bath I pine.
I wish that Neptune would us board today.
Alas! we've crossed the Line.
DISCIPLINE.
"Colonel Potter's lectures are having a marked effect upon
all ranks."
'Ten-shun!" bawled the Sergeant Major, in a voice that
caused the transport to quiver from stetm to stern. Number
One Company of His Majesty's Mudguards sprang to the
order with alacrity.
'Syer, were,' rasped the Sergeant Major, 'make them
'ee's tell, let me ear them come together with a click, if you
men can't do your drill 111 stop your leave at the first port
of call.'
A red-headed Tommy in the rear rank made bold to flick
a fly from the tip of his nose. The movement caught the
eagle eye of the Sergeant Major.
'What the blazes is that man doin' there in the rear?'
he yelled in a voice of thunder, 'D'yer think this is a
bloomin' semaphore class or wot?'
'Ten -shun,' he re-iterated again, and the Company
sprang to the order as only the swell Company of His
Majesty's Mud Guards could spring to it. The movement
was the heels clicked with the utmost precision,
the men stood sphinx-like, immovable, despite the rolling
motion of the vessel.
'What the sufferin' hades is all the movement for.'
again bellowed the Sergeant-Major, 'This aint a bloomin
dancin' class' if I catch a man, so much as blink a bloomin'
eyelash when I say stan' still, by the seven holy hatpins an'
the noxious weed act, I'll fix him, see if I don't.
Someone in the rear gave vent to a sneeze. This was
too much for the Sergeant-Major, he stood speechless, his
eyes bulged with indignation, he tried to speak, but words
failed him.


'Well I be juggered' he managed to splutter in his wrath.'
'li this aint the most un-desciplined company this side of
hades I'll eat my Mills web.' His eye roamed over the
company in search of the culprit.
'Ah ha, there you are,' he snapped indicating a small red
faced man in the second platoon, who bore the tell tale
evidence of a recent sneeze upon his upper lip .
'What the blazes d'yer mean by sneezing on parade,' be
asekd.
'Please it was the sun in my eyes/ pleaded the culprit.
'Shut up' bawled the Sergeant-Major. 'Don't dare Lo
answer me back, what the fighting torn cats d'yer mean by
gazing up at the sun when you should be lookin' straight to
yer front? it's a breach of descipline that's what I call it.'
'Here sergeant have that man arrested, shove him in the
clink, have him shot, have him hung, have him vaccinated,
punish him anyhow yer like; Colonel Potter ses wot this
New Zealand Army wants is DISCIPLINE, an' my Gawd
I'll see as he gets it.
'' MOKOIA CHRONICLE .''
NOTES ON THE BOXING TOURNAMENT.
Held on Board H. M. N. Z. T. 52, by Alpha Beta.
Judges : Capt. Bax, Second-Lieut. Overton.
Hon. Surgeons : Captains Brewster and Reid.
Timekeeper : Chaplain-Capt. Blamires.
Referee : Sergt. McFarlane.
Among the many joyous (?) hours, such as being on
guard asleep, etc., which have been passed on board the
gallant ship "Mokoia," possibly the hours, which have been
devoted to the exhibition of the cunning of the arm and
quickness of the eye, have been the most enjoyable and
perhaps instructive.
It is to be hoped that even the timid ones now feel quite
ready and able to apply a. kidney punch or left hook to the
jaw at the right moment.
All those who had the organising and running of the
Tournament are to be congratulated. The way in which
Chaplain-Capt. Blamires beat the gong went to everybody's
heart. Sergt. McFarlane carried out his duties with all fair-
ness, and added quite considerably to the success of the
proceedings. The final encounter of the afternoon in the
Tournament was far and away the most exciting, both men
getting to work with a will and delivering blow after blow
with grunts of satisfaction. (One almost feels tempted to
suggest, that the men felt that lifebelts, which they had worn
in the morning, would have been very acceptable in the
afternoon).
Larsen, though the lighter man of the two, stood the
punishment better and the result of a gory battle was in his
favour.
The finals will take place some time before we reach our
destination.
BOXING TOURNAMENT.
Light Weights.
Pvt. Spearman, (J. Company) v. Pvt. Thoumine, (J. Company)
These were the only nominations in the Light-weight
class, and the bout opened the afternoon's sport. After a
game fight by the loser, Pvt. Spearman, who shewed much
talent, was declared the winner.
Middle Weights.
Pvt. Peters, (12th Mounted) v. Pvt. Tai Rua (Maoris).
The first "go" in the middle-weights was short and
sweet. Peters rushed matters right from the gong, and before
the first round was finished, had the Maori beaten.
Pvt. Fabian, (12th Mounted) v. Pvt. Trethaway.
Veterinary Corps).
A very good exhibition of the fistic art, both men stand-
ing up to the fighting. Fabian, however, slowly outpointed
his opponent and was given the verdict.
Pvt. Howden, (12th Mounted) v. Pvt. Renata, (Maoris).
In the first round Howden seemed to have his man
beaten, and slackened off in the second and third rounds.
When time was called the result was a draw and an extra
round was ordered. In this Howden went right after his
man and earned the decision in his favour.
Pvt. Bailey, (Veterinary Corps) v. L/Cpl. Savage (Maoris).
The opening blows here gave promise of something good,
but it turned into a very tame affair. Bailey was the more
aggressive of the two and eventually was given the Verdict.
Heavy Weights.
Corpl. Burgess (12th Mounted) v. Corpl. Rukingi, (Maoris).
This event was very spirited and the referee had to inter-
fere on one or two occasions. Both men are of the fighting,
rather than the sparring, type. Rukingi's straight left proved
very effective, and the judges declared him the winner. Bur-
gess put up a fine fight but seemed to lose his head towards
the finish otherwise a different ending might have resulted.
The win was very popular.
Pvt. Stratton (Veterinary Corps) v. Pvt. Wi T'uti (Maoris).
These two wer© genuine heavy-weights and a ding-dong
encounter resulted. Hard hitting was more evident than
science and Stratton was the one who came through the
ordeal best. Wi Tuti proved a very capable opponent, how-
ever, and shewed that he can entertain with his fists as well
as with his voice.
Pvt. Dunn (Maoris), v. Pvt. Jones (Maoris).
This was the only event staged between two Maoris
and was one of the most enjoyable of the afternoon. Science
was conspicuous by its absence. Dunn appeared to have
something up His sleeve and seemed to play with his oppo-
nent, who certainly could not have looked for a decision in
his favour —and he didn't get it.
Pvt. O'Donnell (J. Company), v. Pvt. Howard, (J. Company).
O'Donnell was giving away rather much weight, but put
up a good fight. He has a splendid left but Howard seemed
capable of stopping it —(once or twice on the face) —and the
latter, who was the more aggressive, eventually proved the
victor.

Here you have a Sergeant-Major
Who, at Headquarters, can be seen.
He has a name, though hot a nature,
Reminding us of something GREEN.
TUG-OF-WAR COMPETITION.
(CONTRIBUTED BY ALPHA BETA).
On a recent Saturday the Tug-of-War Competition, or-
ganised by the Sports Committee, eventuated.
Unfortunately the deck space on the ship is not con-
ducive to proper conduct of this class of sport but, taking
everything into consideration, the programme was carried
through very satisfactorily, and reflects credit on the Organis-
ers, of whom Capt. Bax and Chaplain-Capt. Blamires were
prominent.
First Round.
J" Company No. 1. Team v. Cyclist Company, No. 1 Team.
The Cyclists' team held the advantage right from the
start and proved easy winners.
J" Company No. 2 Team v. Maoris' No. 1 Team.
From the outset "J" Coy. easily pulled their opponents
and appeared to have won, but the judges decided that they
had committed a breach of rules and ordered an "encore,"
in which the Maoris fairly walked home.
12th Mounted No. 1 Team v. Cyclist Company No. 2 Team.
This resulted in a fairly easy win for the first mentioned,
the Mounted men appearing to have as good a, team as yet
paraded.
12th Mounted No. 2 Team v. Maoris' No. 2 Team.
Here again the N. Z. "ancients" proved their superiority
over the Pakehas and pulled the Mounted men off their feet.
Maoris' No. 3 Team v. Ship's Crew.
This was expected to be the event of the first round,
and so it proved. The Maoris gained the advantage at the
start but soon lost it again. However, by almost super-
human efforts, the soldiers again took command of the situa-
tion and, sticking to their task, eventually won.
Cyclist Company No. 3 Team v. "J" Company, No. 4 Team.
TKe Cyclists entered the second round by winning this
event in good style.
J" Company, No. 3 Team v. 12th Mounted, No. 3 Team.
Three of the five teams entered by "J" Company had
so far gone down, and it- was up to their No. 3 Team to
redeem the situation. This they did rather easily, after a
short pull, in which they held the advantage throughout.
Second Round.
"J" Company, No. 5 Team v. Cyclist Company No. 1 Team.
The first mentioned had a bye in the first round and as
the majority of the men comprising the team were either
on duty or suffering after-effects of vaccination, the Cyclists
were given a walk-over.
Maoris' No. 1 Team v. 12th Mounted, No. 1 Team.
A rattling good encounter between two good teams but
there was no holding the Maoris, who had so far carried all
before them. Here they succeeded in wearing down the oppo-
sition and gaining the decision.
Maoris' No. 2 Team v. Maoris' No. 3 Team.
This was the only event of the afternoon in which two
teams from the one Unit were brought into opposition—and
the only one in which a Maori team was defeated, it may
be noted. The encounter proved very interesting but No. 2
brigade having an advantage in weight pulled their oppo-
nents.
Cyclist Company No. 3 Team v. "J" Company No. 3 Team.
The "Mounted footers" were, still left in the running
as a result of this event, having a rather easy win over the
Cyclists, and the following appeared in the
Semi-Finals.
Cyclist Company No. 1 Team v. Maoris' No. 1 Team.
The Cyclists were, so far, practically an unknown
quantity, having had a "soft thing" in the first round, and
a walk-over in the second, and when tested they proved to
be of no mean calibre. At one time they looked certain
winners but the Maoris came back strongly, and, through
"stickatitiveness," entered the final.
Maoris' No. 2 Team v. "J" Company No. 3 Team.
"J" 3 were left as the "white hopes," but, unlike Jesse
Willard, they disappointed, though their effort was a good
one.
Final.
Maoris' No. 1 Team v. Maoris No. 2 Team.
Absolutely the encounter of the day ! Everyone present
was either "barracking" for one or other of the contesting
teams, or laughing at the antics of the one and only "Hoppy"
who was coaching No. 2 Team.


First one and then the other held the advantage and a
long tug was "finalled" with No. 1 holding the advantage.
All the spectators seemed satisfied that the two best
teams had entered the Final, and the better had won.
FIRST CONCERT.
The opening concert, being the first, possessed much of
the experimental element, and the newly-formed Orchestra
made its debut under Lieut. G. B. Carter, Musical Director,

even thus early. Volunteers for filling the programme were
numerous.

THIRD CONCERT.
Society Notes.
The nurses looked charming, eating apples, and wearin"
nirion over none-on
Lieut. Carter looked weiT dressed—"in the shadows."
Lieut. Kebbell, garbed in innocence, was very prominent.
Lieut. Brown, wearing a worried look, was evident in
the earlier part of the evening.
Lieut. Livingstone appeared in a well-known song.
Major Evans and Capt. Short wore fancy dresses, which
several present identified as Military uniforms.
Lieut. Medcalf wore a cherubic smile.
Lieut. Bremner was there, wearing a sleepy expression.
An air of mystery surrounded our Editor.
Several of the sergeants, having nothing on to keep them
away, patronised the concert, as also did the Orderly
Room staff.
Many of the rank and file were present in various garbs,
some of which reminded us of the dress worn by our
common ancestors, Adam and Eve.
A few members of the Orchestra who had been disturbed
in their slumbers appeared in pyjamas, but the
majority, having given all the unnecessary articles
of uniform to their best girls before leaving Welling-
ton, didn't have pyjamas.
The Lancers, prefixed Linseed, should plant some of the
seed with a view to eventually getting enough linen
to make a covering for their nakedness.
ODES TO OUR OFFICERS.
The first of the B's, Captain Bax,
I have never yet seen in a wax;
So I trust that this piffle
Will cause but a ripple
Of mirth, or I'll have to make tracks.
The next B is Padre Blamires,
Whose interest in, all never tires,
A veteran he,
Of GaHipoli,
A preacher whose eloquence fires,

The only thing that he had tackled,
Since he came aboard this tub',
Was the serving of meat —speckled—
(Much in need of a good scrub),
Until in football togs, adorning,
With a "sub" he once was seen
Make an effort, without warning,
To blend the Red, White, Blue, and Green 1
The next is the doughty Sir Bremner,
A John Bull of weight and of phelegm, sir.
He is sure to win fame
But I must say his name
For a rhyme makes me dem a big dem, sir.

Gets up every day with the rooster,
With lancet and drugs
He goes for germ-bugs,
And smites 'em all "where mother uster."

Mr. Bixon, the King of Ivhanteen,
At the sing-songs, and concerts is seen
We all like his voice,
We respectfully beg to thank our very numerous Cus-
tomers for the very liberal patronage bestowed upon us
during the voyage. We have been able to dispose of nearly
all our goods, bad and indifferent.
But of songs his own choice,
We suppose, is "Awearin' the Green."
We regret that owing to the number of Wowsers, who
stay at Home under the K of K Pledge, we have been unable
to dispose of all our Stock of Speights, Staples and dear old
Hancocks, also other beers, and our only regret is, that we
are not allowed to carry a larger assortment of goods.—

Just try what you can do!

ADDENDA.
(TZy one of the Staff.)
When you've paraded or, by play,
Made the most of every day,
We've been grinding, sweating, here
With only Lime Juice —(ne'er a Beer)—
To quench our still prevailing thirst.
Here's the result —now do your worst!
But, before you get together,
Just remember that the weather
Has been very far from freezy ;
In your judgment thus be easy.
Here we end. It's in your power
To shout us down—at the first Bar
A. B.
