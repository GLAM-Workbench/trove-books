The Australasian National League-N.S.W. Section.
(FORMERLY STYLED THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF N.S.W.)
OBJECTS:
(1) To create a national sentiment ; to promote law and order and good government; to
maintain general confidence and security ; to encourage agricultural, pastoral, min-
ing, commercial, and manufacturing enterprise ; to oppose dangerous socialistic and
class legislation ; and to ensure to every man his persona,! freedom, and the peace-
able enjoyment of his earnings and savings.
(2) To combine all persons in an association to secure the welfare and advancement of the
people as a whole, to cultivate a patriotic feeling, to foster a federal spirit through-
out the Australasian colonies, and to further the well-being of every man,
irrespective of class or creed.
Working Platform s
A number of the principles originally advocated by the National Association of New
South Wales having been made law, the New South Wales section of the Australasian
National League places before the people of the Colony a revised Working Platform. Its
object is to aid in restoring prosperity, and to defeat any attempt to secure for one section of
the community the power to dominate the remainder. Any such course of action must result
in the loss of public credit, the crippling of private enterprise, the withdrawal of capital from
investment, the creation of class hatred, and possibly in the end revolution and anarchy.
The League holds that the people will be better served by the passing of practical measures
calculated to benefit all classes alike, than by theoretical experiments in the interests of one
class only. It therefore invites consideration by the electors of this statement of its princi-
ples, to which future candidates for seats in Parliament, who would secure the support of its
members, will be asked to subscribe :
Federation of the Australasian Colonies.
Economy in public expenditure.
Consolidation of loans, and the reduction of interest by the establishment of Australasian
Consols or otherwise.
Opposition to excessive or unfair taxation.
The using of every effort to induce electors to register and record their votes, and jealously
guard the purity of the electoral rolls.
To induce the candidature and secure the return of capable and honourable men as represen-
tatives.
Prevention of intending candidates, whose opinions are in general accord with those of the
League, from competing against each other.
Abolition of payment of members.
Land classification, and survey before selection.
Water conservation and irrigation.
Local Government.
No class domination nor class legislation.
Promotion of the Political education of the people through the press, the platform, and other
agencies, with a view to showing that the permanent welfare of any section of the com-
munity is indissolubly bound up with that of all other sections, and that all hasty, ill-
considered and revolutionary legislation, and all mandates issued by irresponsible bodies,
tending to check the free and lawful use by every man of his natural or acquired abilities,
are wrongs to the individual, and crimes against the State.
