CHAPTER I.
Australian Emigration?What it has been and what it should
be Outfits for all classes Government Emigration
Family Colonization.
The great rush which has taken place to the Aus-
tralian Colonies during the past two years, unusual
both in kind and extent, has naturally attracted con-
siderable attention in this country, and raised various
conjectures as to the final result. Fifty thousand
persons leaving these shores for a new land within
twelve months, appears a large number, yet it is but a
fifth part of the emigration annually going on to the
United States of America. And when we bear in
mind that Australia is in extent very nearly equal to
the whole of Europe, in which upwards of two hun-
dred millions of human beings subsist, whilst even at
this moment there cannot be half a million of inha-
bitants European and aboriginal, in the whole of the


great Australian continent, we need not fear for the
ultimate welfare of the many thousands who have
gone thither or are on the point of starting.
It was not to be expected, that amidst this sudden
flight of persons of all classes and ages, to one or
two particular localities, there would not be many
who had far better have remained at home with their
passage-motiey in their pockets. This was not more
than was foreseen, and it has come to pass./ Scarcely
a mail arrives from Sydney or Melbourne, but brings
a batch of melancholy epistles from disappointed
emigrants, who because they find themselves unfitted
for the Bush or the Gold Fields, and are not wanted
in the town, rail at the people, the place, the guide-
books which they say took them in, and the ships
which took them out. According to this description
of people, everything is dear and dirty, even to the
nuggets. All their grapes are exceedingly sour, and
they have evidently determined on having nothing to
do with them. The climate is either too hot or too
damp, or too dry, and not to be compared to the
foggy delights of a November day at home, or the
drizzling comfort of a dark January morning, to say
nothing of March winds.
Strange as it may appear, however, there are other
folks found who write in a precisely opposite vein, so
much so that one is sometimes inclined to believe
they must be writing from a different country. In
their eyes everything is charming and thriving. The


climate is most enjoyable; plenty of money is being
made, and good beef and mutton are only four pence
a pound.
We shall not be far wrong if we abstract a little
of the high-colouring of the latter class, and a great
deal of the heavy shading laid on by the former, and
by this process arrive at a tolerably correct estimate
of the present actual position of Australia, and of
its suitability as an emigration field for the labouring
classes and the men of moderate means.
It may be well to mention in this place what will
be more fully pointed out hereafter, that the three
colonies of Australia, New South Wales, South Aus-
tralia and Victoria, although agreeing in most essen-
tial points have each their peculiar claims to attention,
offering as they do inducements to men of different
means and capacities. At the same time there are,
in spite of their local discrepancies, principles which
apply with equal force in all three cases, and which
therefore cannot be too strongly impressed upon the
minds of such as may be turning their thoughts in
that direction. To the discussion of these broad
principles it is our intention to devote this opening
chapter as a safe and sure foundation whereon to
build our emigration structure.
In the early days of Australian colonization itwas
strongly inculcated upon the public mind, that none
should attempt to settle in that distant and unopened
country who could not go into the Bush and rough it


alone and unaided if need be; or that only men of
large means who could carry a supply of labour with
them, were safe in investing capital there. This can
no longer be said. The circumstances of Australia
are now widely different. A large and rapidly in-
creasing population in town and country districts,
has created fresh wants, and new demands for labour
and capital have arisen such as were before undreamt
of. The ? Bush? is no longer a necessity for the
Australian emigrant. The abounding riches of the
Gold Fields have created a species of barbarous civi-
lization, a state of semi-savage luxury, a go-ahead
lawless spirit of enjoyment, which must be minis-
tered to at any cost.
But while we admit that tradesmen, commercial
capitalists, brokers, contractors, bankers, accoun-
tants, and many others are likely to find a fair field
for their exertions in the Gold Colonies, even such as
these must be prepared to see matters carried on
very differently from such things in the old country.
Many disagreeables are sure to await them, and
although with ample means at their command they
must be prepared to ? rough it? for some time after
their arrival. The peculiarities of the climate, the
all but total absence of domestic servants, the want
of a fixed society, all these things must be encoun-
tered with many others, and therefore such persons
as are not prepared to submit to and by perseverance
overcome all these disagreeables, had better make up


their minds at once to have nothing to do with emi-
grating to Australia.
It is not, however, to the above description of
persons we propose addressing this chapter, but to
such as think of making the Southern Colonies their
future home, either as agriculturists, cattle-rearers
or miners. This class of emigrants have far greater
need of asking themselves if they be fit for the voyage
and the new life they will have to lead in that new
country; a question which they may answer for them-
selves if they will read this and the following chapters
with attention.
There has been a very prevalent opinion held in
this country, especially since the discovery of Gold in
Australia, that since labour is so dear, and food so
cheap, anybody with a pair of hands cannot fail to do
well in that part of the world. A greater mistake
could scarcely be committed, and it therefore behoves
us to put this matter right. It is to the wrong im-
pression created in this way that so much suffering
and distress in the colonies may he attributed.
Thousands have undoubtedly gone out since 1851,
who should never have left this country, and who
would make any sacrifice to return to the homes they
have left.
Persons accustomed only to a town life, clerks,
shopkeepers, lawyers, schoolmasters, artists, &c., save
in particular places and in limited numbers have
never been in demand ; yet hundred and thousands


of these have gone only to find that unless they
choose to go out into the bush, or the streets, or on
the wharves as day-labourers, and handle the spade,
the shepherd?s staff, the barrow or .the whip, they
had but a small chance of earning a subsistence.
This cannot be said of the other sex. So small
has been the number comparatively of female emi-
grants, that any arriving in the Colony are sure to be
caught up, no matter what her capabilities may
amount to, whether comprised in the terms knitting,
netting, and crochet,? whether confined to painting
butterflies and singing Italian arias, or whether they
embrace the more solid acquirements of darning
stockings and making puddings. Often as we have
heard of the Melbourne and Sydney markets being
overdone with bottled beer, crockery and hardware,
we have never been told that there was any glut of
young marriageable women.
On the other hand, there is ample room for young
or middle-aged men, who both can and will make
themselves generally useful, and who are content to
forego the prejudices and the indoor habits of the
old country. When this can be done, then we may
almost say that it matters but little what a man may
have been brought up to. Let him have but stout
limbs and a stout cheerful heart, and he cannot fail
to prosper. It is not meant by this to say that the
linendraper?s assistant, or the lawyer?s clerk, can if
they choose readily become Australian ploughmen,


gold-diggers, or draymen. Some physical training
must of necessity be undergone in the first instance,
but there would be nothing to prevent them from at
once taking up with the life of shepherd or stock-
keeper, having the will to submit to the privations
which must be entailed by such an occupation.
Landing in any of the three colonies, the willing
labourer will meet with ready and liberal employers,
only too glad to avail of his services with good pay
and rations, on which he may become as fat as any
yeoman of the olden time ; a climate so favourable to
health that medicine is all but unknown, and the
death of a young person a most rare occurrence ; no
taxes, no rent; and with need of so few clothes as to
render their cost a matter of little moment. Should
the intending emigrant be married, so much the
better, provided the wife be frugal and industrious ;
such a helper will not only be no expense, but she
will actually often earn nearly as much as the hus-
band. Children, too, which in this country are so
frequently looked upon as incumbrances to the strug-
gling man, as dead weights around his progress, are
there so many valuable assistants to the farm-settler,
be he in what capacity he may. In that land of pro-
mise, children, from being, as in the old world, bur-
dens and sorrows, become truly blessings, and realise
the scriptural saying, ? Happy is he who hath his
quiver full of them.? Children of ten or eleven are
of the utmost use in tending sheep, whilst a lad of


fourteen is quite as good as a man, either as shepherd,
stockman, or hut-keeper.
All this may be the lot of men possessing but
small experience of rural life or of worldly matters
in general. It may readily be imagined therefore,
that for those who combine with a willing disposition,
and steady, sober, industrious habits, a running
knowledge of the more practical things of the world,
the prospect will be still more promising. Besides
men-cooks for out-stations, who can combine the duty
of butcher or baker, or both, gardeners and farm-
servants, such as shepherds, grooms, cattle drivers of
experience, and ploughmen, are all required. Of
ordinary labourers, those in chief demand are sawyers,
brickmakers, carpenters, bricklayers, masons, stone-
cutters, smiths, wheelwrights, coopers, and shoe-
makers. Any or all of these, of steady habits, may
go out to the Australian colonies, in the fullest confi-
dence of being able to live in the enjoyment of worldly
comforts, which in this country they could hardly
look for.
Besides the above whose only capital is their
labour, there is the small farmer, having moderate
means and a growing family, who finds himself going
back in the world year by year, with small prospects
for his daughters beyond the milk-pail and the
poultry-yard, or for his sons beyond the plough and
the hog-trough?such a man, if industrious, sober,
and frugal, cannot do better than turn sheep-farmer


or corn-grower in Australia, where by a few years of
attention and industry, he will be certain to place
himself in an independent position.
Men of even more extensive means will of course
do still better, provided they go about their business in
the right mood. For such indeed there is a very
wide field of operations from stock-keeping to com-
mercial business. But this class will in all probability
not care to take advice from us, though they might
find it to their advantage.
Having said this much as to the class of persons
who are likely to make good colonists, it will be
right that our remarks are followed up by some
information as to the mode of reaching the colonies.
This may be done in two ways: either by the emi-
grant paying his own way out, or by obtaining a
passage through the means of the Emigration Com-
missioners.
There are seldom any lack of passenger ships to
the Australian colonies, many of them of first-class
descriptions. But it need hardly be told the reader
that there are bad as well as good vessels and cap-
tains, and our advice to those married persons who
think of emigrating, is if possible to avoid what are
termed steerage berths, at from to � 22. A few
more pounds if it can be managed will be well laid
out in comfort for a four months voyage. To single
men this is a matter of less moment, and they will in
all probability be as well in the steerage as anywhere


else. The larger the ship, provided there be not too
many going in her, the more comfort will the emi-
grant find, especially in bad weather. Care should be
taken to examine well the scale of dietary allowed by
the ship, and to see that it contains a proper allow-
ance of preserved provisions and w r ater, two great
essentials for a long voyage. Ventilation is another
point that cannot be too strictly attended to, and it
would be w r ell to ascertain that every precaution is
taken to secure this before the vessel quits the docks.
With regard to the choice of a good ship and a
good captain, in which the emigrant cannot be too
careful, the only safe mode is to go to an old estab-
lished, respectable broker or ship-owner, of which
there are abundance both in London and Liverpool.
An emigrant cannot do wrong in securing a passage
in any vessel belonging to either the Messrs. Lind-
says, Wigrams, Greens, or Dunbar of London, or of
the Black Ball, Eagle, or Golden Line of Liverpool
Packets.
As the great bulk of emigrants leaving these
shores are never overstocked with means, a few hints
to enable them to economise their outfit, will no
doubt prove very acceptable. Each passenger is
allowed to take with him from fifteen to twenty cubic
feet of baggage free of any charge. This will be
placed in the hold or lower part of the ship, but in
such a position as to be easily got at during the
voyage, which is generally done twice a month. Pas-


sengers are allowed to have in their cabin or under
their berth a box or bag, capable of holding clothes
sufficient for two weeks wear; the size allowed for
a box is one foot ten inches long, one foot six inches
broad, and one foot two inches deep. It is far better
to have a stout canvass bag painted. Every package
should have the owner?s name painted on it in large
letters.
The following articles will be fqjind sufficient for a
married couple with management, during a voyage to
any of the Australian colonies: if their means permit
them to take more so much the better, but fewer
could hardly suffice, for it must be remembered that
it is impossible to wash during the voyage: ?
For the wife: ?three cotton dresses, one pair stays,
four petticoats, sixteen chemises, two flannel petti-
coats, twelve pairs cotton stockings, four pairs black
worsted ditto, six night dresses and caps, six pocket-
handkerchiefs, four handkerchiefs for the neck, six
caps, two bonnets, cloak and shawl, one pair boots,
two pairs shoes, and eight towels.
For the husband : ?two fustian jackets, waistcoats,
and trousers, three pairs canvas trousers, one over-
coat, two felt hats, one Scotch cap, sixteen striped
shirts, two Guernsey shirts, twelve pairs cotton half-
hose, four pairs worsted hose, six handkerchiefs,
eight towels, two pairs boots, and one pair shoes,
strong but not heavy. Children in like proportion.
The family will also require a flock mattress and


bolster, one pair blankets, one coverlet, six pairs
cotton sheets, two or three tablecloths, six pounds
yellow soap, three pounds marine soap, metal wash-
hand basin, knives and forks, one quart tin hook-pot,
one coffee pot, comb and brush, besides a supply of
string, sewing materials, tape, buttons, &c. A small
supply of calicoes, brown holland, camlet, fine canvas,
&c., would be well added if possible; and it will
always be desirably that the wife make as many of
her clothes on board ship as she can, as the occupa-
tion serves to pass away many an otherwise idle,
heavy hour.
Men of better means ?small farmers or tradesmen
for instance, would do well to take the following:?
three dozen regatta shirts, common, to be used first;
one dozen best regatta shirts ; six best white shirts,
for town ; twelve pairs drawers, cotton thread; three
dozen pairs socks, cotton or angola; six pairs worsted
socks ; six pairs shoes or boots, strong but not heavy;
one cloth cap; two straw hats and two felt hats, as you
generally lose one or two overboard; a south-wester;
one pilot-cloth coat; two body coats, alpaca; six
blouses ; two pairs cloth trousers; three pairs alpaca
ditto; ten pairs white ducks ; a large canvas clothes
bag ; a horse-hair or cocoa-nut fibre mattress ; a pair
of 40s. blankets; eight pairs of sheets ; a coverlet; a
cabin wash-basin and table; a pair of ship chest of
drawers; a looking-glass, combs, brushes, &c.; a ship
cabin candle lamp, with 10 lbs. composite candles;


6 lbs. soap ; some marine soap, all packed in chests
or in the drawers; with tapes, buttons, sewing thread,
needles, &c.
A useful outfit for the ? Bush? or up-country,
would consist of four pairs moleskin trousers; two
pairs ditto, strapped inside all the way down ; twelve
Florentine shirts ; six pairs boots, strong Wellingtons
or ankle jacks; one monkey jacket; two shooting
coats; one drab greatcoat, like a soldier?s, loose-
made ; a pair or two of the best spurs, plated ; twelve
coarse silk pocket-handkerchiefs; a good head-stall
snaffle bridle ?the saddle had better be bought in the
colony, also saddle-bags.
Any wearing apparel the emigrants may have by
them, had better be taken for wear on the voyage, as
however old they may be, they will do well enough,
and help to economise their new things: this applies
especially to boots and shoes, as the salt water on
board ship is sure to destroy the leather no matter
how strong the boots may be.
Books had better not be taken, with one or two
exceptions, as they are liable to damage, and are dif-
ficult of transport. The labouring man or artificer
may take with him any good and useful tools he may
have, though not more than he is likely to require
for his own work.
Any small spare means the emigrant may have,
will be well laid out in the purchase of a few
additional small stores, such as bacon, tongues, butter,


biscuits, a cheese or two, and if possible a few dozens
of new eggs, dipped in grease, and packed in bran
grease, and packed in bran
or sawdust, or better still in oatmeal, which may be
used on the voyage.
The scale of dietary given below is a very common
one on board most respectable ships, though some of
the items vary occasionally
Biscuit, per week, 3 lb.
Beef, do. 2 lb.
Pork, do, 1 lb.
Preserved Meat, do. 1 lb.
Soup and Bouilli, do 1 lb.
Fish, do. J lb.
Flour, do. 82 lb.
Eaisins, do. � lb.
Preserved Fruit, do � lb.
Suet, do. 6 oz.
Pease, do., two-thirds of a pint.
Rice, do. f lb.
Preserved Potatoes, do. � lb.

Mustard, do. oz.
Salt, do. 2 oz.
Pepper, do. | oz.
Water, do. 5 gals. 1 qrt.
Do., each Infant, 1 gal. 3 qrts.
The dietary provided by the Government in their
chartered vessels is of the best kind, and on the
most liberal scale. Every possible arrangement is
made to secure not only the personal comfort, but the
proper protection of female emigrants during the
voyage, who are placed under the charge of a matron
and surgeon. In this way families are cared for in a
manner which cannot be looked for in private ships,
and the consequence has been, that complaints of
misconduct of passengers, or want of attention from
the officers, are no longer heard of.
Another style of emigration is that carried on
under the auspices of Mrs. Chisholm, and known


as the ?Family Colonization Loan Society,? the
leading features of which consist in advancing a por-
tion of the sums needed for passage-money under
agreement of repayment in the colony, and the for-
warding of whole families in groups, in preference to
leaving any members of them behind. Full particu-
lars on this subject, may be obtained on application
to the Secretary, at No. 24, Bucklersbury, Cheapside.
Women receive the same rations as men. Children
between one and fourteen years of age receive one-
half.
Persons of the labouring classes, who do not pos-
sess the means of paying their passage to the colonies,
may, on application to the Emigration Commissioners,
at 3, Park Street, Westminister, obtain passages, pro-
vided they are of the description of persons wanted,
and can furnish satisfactory testimonials as to cha-
racter and qualifications. The terms and conditions
on which they can thus be sent out, may be learnt
by an application either personal, or in writing to the
Secretary.
The Commissioners are provided with funds for
this purpose by the Colonies wanting the labour,
many hundreds of thousands of pounds having been
thus expended for them. Formerly the passages
were entirely free, but this has been so far modified as
regards Sydney, that it is now determined the emi-
grant shall pay in this country �\, towards the cost
of his passage, but nothing for his wife or children,


who are under fourteen years of age; and on their
arrival in the colony, he shall enter into an agreement
to repay to the Colonial Government, by eight quar-
terly instalments, a further sum of �l2. So that
these payments, as they accumulate, will be again re-
mitted to England, towards defraying the cost of a
farther supply of labour, the amount actually sunk
will consist of the cost of passage for the wife and
children, and the difference between the actual cost
of the emigrant himself, and the sum of �l3, which
he will eventually have paid.


CHAPTER 11.
A Brief Description of Australia, with an account of the
Position, Extent, Natural Features, Climate, Seasons, &c.
of New South Wales, South Australia, and Victoria.
Australia is an island lying in the South Pacific
Ocean, between the parallels of 10� 45' and 38� 45'
of south latitude, and 153� 30' of east longitude,
and is consequently at the antipodes of Great Britain,
from which it is distant about 16,000 miles by ship?s
course. Its length is nearly 3000 miles from east to
west, and its breadth 2000 miles from north to south.
The area is estimated at 2,690,810 square miles, and
the coast line at nearly 8000 nautical miles.
New South Wales, the oldest settlement, is situate
on the east coast of this island; the present boun-
daries of which extend from the northern point,
called Cape York, to Cape Howe, and thence in a
straight line to the nearest source of the river Murray.
'he Colony embraces all the country from the coast
to the westward (not including South Australia and
Victoria), extending to the 129 th degree of eastlongi-
iude. The adjacent islands are also belonging to this
erritory.


It is 2250 miles in length from Cape York to
Cape Howe, and 1740 in breadth from the boun-
dary of South Australia, in longitude 141 0 east, to
Moreton Bay, in latitude 27� 30' south. The dis-
tricts coming under the denomination of ? settled,?
contain 34,505 square miles, or, 22,083,200 acres;
beyond the boundaries the squatters occupy fully one
hundred millions of acres. There is also a sort of
natural boundary formed by a mountain range ex-
tending from Bass?s Strait to York Peninsula, from
2000 to 6000 feet in height, at a distance of 50 to
100 miles from the coast. This mountain ? belt? is
known in different parts of the colony as the ? Blue
Mountains,? in the vicinity of Sydney ; the ? Liver-
pool Range? in the northern, and the (f Australian
Alps? in the southern districts. The intervening
space between the mountains and the sea is occupied
by a gently undulating surface, intersected by water
courses, in some places well wooded, in others covered
with dense woody scrub, and gradually rising to the
westward in groups of isolated hills.
These mountains divide the sources of the river
Peel, in 300 south latitude from those of the Hastings,
flowing towards Port Macquarie in the N. E. Again
to the south, the river Manning is separated by one
of its spurs from the river Hunter, after which it
divides in its windings in a westerly direction ?the
tributaries of the Hunter from those of the Peel.
This portion is called the Liverpool Range, of which


there are two remarkable elevations called Mount
Oxley and Mount McArthur; to the westward of
these the chain turns suddenly to the south-east, but
resumes its south-westerly direction at the sources of
the Colo and Cudgagong. Mounts Adine, Clarence,
King George, and Tomah, crown the northern and
loftier branch; Mounts Hay and King?s table land,
the southern. Extending to the south-west, the
range gives rise to Cox?s River, then takes a south-
east direction, and is known as the Honeysuckle
Range. There is a remarkable eminence on the
southern part of this range known as the Australian
Alps, within the district of New South Wales, named
Mount Kosciuszko by the discoverer, Count Strze-
lecki. Its altitude of 6500 feet, raises it above the
adjacent mountains, and the view from its summit
embraces 7000 square miles.
The rivers throughout the island of Australia are
considerably smaller and fewer in number than the
extent of that vast island continent would lead the
traveller to suppose.
The principal river of New South Wales is the
Hawkesbury, which empties itself into the sea at
Broken Bay, This river is exceedingly tortuous in
its route, a distance of 140 miles, to the township of
Windsor, built upon its banks, although in a direct
line from the sea-coast only distant 35 miles, and is
navigable for vessels of 100 tons four miles above the
town. It flows from the base of the Blue Mountains,


and is a continuation of the Nepean river in Camden
county, and is fed by numerous tributaries.
The river Hunter is formed by several small
streams flowing from the Blue Mountains, and dis-
embogues in the sea at Port Hunter, the harbour of
Newcastle, 59 miles north from the entrance of Port
Jackson.
The Hastings river rises in the Blue Mountains,
and flows a distance of 100 miles before it falls into
the sea at Port Macquarie.
The Clarence also rises in this dividing range of
mountains, and falls into the sea at Shoal Bay.
This river is remarkable for its great breadth, and
its reaches are said to be larger and wider than those
of any other river in Australia, and is navigable for
steamers for upwards of 90 miles. The Brisbane
rises in the dividing range, and empties itself in
Moreton Bay almost in a straight line at a distance
of about 60 miles from the coast.
Paramatta river is merely a continuation of Pori
Jackson, and is navigable a distance of 18 miles tc
the town of the same name. There are also of the
coast rivers the Mamines, which flows from the
eastern side of Liverpool range; the Mac Leas.
navigable from Trial Bay, a distance of 30 miles,
by vessels not more than 60 tons burthen; the Rich-
mond, the Coohalli, the Nambucca, the Boyne, and
several others of a similar description, fall into the
sea on the N. E. coast.


Of the inland rivers the Lachlan, Darling, Mac-
quarie, and the Murrumbidgee, are the most impor-
tant, rising and flowing from the westward of the
Blue Mountains, and, uniting with the river Murray
runs through a portion of the colony of Victoria, and
thence to South Australia, and falls into the sea by
way of Lake Alexandria, in the latter colony.
The principal Harbours are Port Jackson, Botany
Bay, Newcastle, Port Stephen, Port Macquarie, and
Moreton Bay, with the minor ones of Hervey, Jervis,
and Bateman?s Bays, and some good roadsteads lying
to the north-east. Port Jackson is admitted to be
one of the safest havens in the world, and capable of
holding every ship in the British navy. Its entrance
is three-quarters of a mile wide, then expanding into
a capacious basin, 15 miles long, in some places
three miles wide, and navigable for ships of any
burthen 15 miles from its entrance, being a distance
of seven miles above Sydney, up the Paramatta river.
The town of Sydney, the capital of New South
Wales, being built on the side of a gentle slope
extending upwards from the shores of one of the
coves of Port Jackson. Newcastle Harbour, Port
Hunter, is a safe haven, sufficiently capacious for
vessels of 300 tons burthen 59 miles north from the
entrance to Port Jackson. Port Stephen is a fine
harbour, about 100 miles north from Port Jackson.
It has a narrow entrance between rocky headlands,
opening into an expanse about two miles in length ;


then narrowing, forms a channel, which admits ves-
sels of considerable burthen, to a second bay perfectly
land-locked. Port Macquarie is a bar harbour with
about nine feet at low water, situate about 220 miles
to the north-east of Port Jackson. The bar extends
for 200 yards, beyond which the water deepens to
two and three fathoms ; within the port the sound-
ings are five and six fathoms, which depth continues
for nearly ten miles, when shoals confine the naviga-
tion to crafts drawing six or eight feet.
Further north is Moreton Bay. This is a bar
harbour, the entrance to which has eighteen feet at
low water. The bay is said to be sixty miles in extent.
New South Wales is divided into counties, of
which there are officially described twenty-two, and
also sixteen squatting districts. It has, how r ever,
been remarked that, except in Government deeds, or
legal documents, the grand natural divisions of the
country are the only ones known or recognized by
the colonists, who accordingly speak only of the
districts of the Hawkesbury, of Hunter?s River, of
Bathurst, of Illawarra, of Argyle, and of Port Mac-
quarie, Irrespective of the arrangement of counties
and districts, the Colony is divided into two dioceses,
?viz,, Sydney and Newcastle; the latter comprises
the seven northern counties of Northumberland,
Gloucester, Hunter, Durham, Brisbane, Bligh, and
Phillip counties ; the Sydney diocese comprises all
the remainder of the territory.


Victoria, formerly called Port Phillip, is that por-
tion of the island of Australia lying to the southward
and westward of New South Wales, bounded on the
north-east by a straight line from Cape Howe to the
nearest source of the Murray, on the north by the
rNer Murray as far as the frontier of South Australia
in the west, which is defined by the meridian of 141�
E., and on the south by Bass?s Strait. The length
of the province, from east to west, is about 500 miles;
the breadth, from north to south, about 250 miles;
and the coast line about 600 miles j the area is
about 80,000 square miles, or 51,200,000 acres, or
about equal in size to Great Britain. The Province
throughout its whole extent presents great diversity
of feature, from the lofty Alpine region on the east,
to the low grassy plains on the west. But the
peculiar characteristic of Victoria is the large pro-
portion of fertile, accessible, and comparatively level
ground comprised within its limits. Hills of mode-
rate elevation occupy the central country, being
thinly or partially wooded, and covered with the
richest pasturage. The lower country, both on the
northern and southern skirts of these hills, is chiefly
open; and on the south undulates towards the coast.
In the western portions small rivers radiate from the
Grampians, an elevated and isolated mass. Towards
the sea coast, on the south and adjacent to the open
downs between the Grampians and Port Phillip, there
is a low tract of very rich black soil, apparently the


mouth of a river which runs from the eastward is
the anchorage of Hobson?s Bay, where large vessels
anchor and transport their cargoes by lighters and
steamers to the town of Melbourne.
On the western coast of Port Phillip is a long wide
arm, termed the inner harbour of Geelong, the
anchorage of which is named Kohrio Bay. Port
Western is a capacious harbour situate in a wide and
deep inlet containing two great bays, the inner one
being a circular basin of about eighteen miles across.
Port Fairy is a harbour, which forms a link in the
coast between Port Phillip and Portland Bay. The
entrance is open and affords but insufficient shelter
for anchorage.
Portland Bay is in longitude 141� 20' East, and
affords a fine and more secure anchorage than any
other part of the coast. It extends twenty-six miles
from east to west, and ten from north to south.
There is excellent holding ground in from four to
seven fathoms, towards the western shore, where the
anchorage is completely sheltered from the south-
westerly winds, but exposed however to those from
the south-east, which prevail during the summer
months.
The numerous inland Lakes of this Province are
among the most remarkable of its physical features.
The waters of many of them are quite salt, much
more so indeed than the waters of the ocean; and
during the summer when the extensive evaporation


that always takes place at that season leaves the
greater portion of the lakes nearly dry, the salt is
found in large crystals in a depth of from three to
six inches. It is of excellent quality, and when
pounded is used by the settlers for all domestic
purposes.
Victoria has lately been divided into twenty-three
Counties, although the whole of the North-eastern
portion of the Province is usually termed Murray
district; the North-western, Wimmera district; the
South-eastern, Gipps ? Lands; the South-western,
Portland Bay district; and the central Western
Pori district. The exact limits of these divisions
are however but vaguely defined.
South Australia is situated, as its name implies,
on the south coast of this great island, its limits
being fixed by an Act of Parliament (4 and 5 Will.
IV. cap. 95) as between the 26th degree of south
latitude and the sea coast, and 132 nd and 141 st
degrees of east longitude. The area extends over
300,000 square miles, being nearly 200,000,000 acres
of land. This may be divided into three divisions ;
one-third good open agricultural and pastural land ;
one-third wooded ranges, available for pasturage,
and the remainder scrub and rock. The experience
of the last few years has proved that the scrub land
is by far the richest portion of the colony, as all the
rich mines have been discovered in such.
The sea line of this Colony is estimated at about


1500 miles, and is throughout its whole length in-
dented with numerous deep and extensive bays, which
though as yet but imperfectly known are supposed
to be with few exceptions the resort of whales in some
seasons.
About the centre of the sea range of coast two
immense inland seas or gulfs indent the coast.
Spencer?s Gulf on the west, and St. Vincent?s on the
east, the two being separated by a long and narrow
neck of land, called York?s Peninsula. Immediately
in front and lying across the entrance of St. Vincent?s
Gulf, is Kangaroo island, a large, but nearly barren
tract, containing several safe and commodious har.
hours.
South Australia, possesses much picturesque
scenery on either side of its continuous ranges of
high land, the loftiest elevation of which not exceed-
ing 3000 feet. The Mount Lofty Range stretches
from Cape Jervis along the east shore of Gulf
St. Vincent to the northward for about forty miles.
The more western branch of the chain, sometimes
called Flinders? Range, follows the eastern side of
Spencer?s Gulf; thence runs nearly parallel with the
inner shore of Lke Torrens for a considerable
distance, its most northerly extremity being Mount
Hopeless.
The heights termed the Barossa Range, about
thirty miles to the north-east of Adelaide, form an
undulating hilly country, lightly wooded, comprising
several rich and picturesque valleys.


There are but few streams in the limits of South
Australia deserving the name of rivers; most of
them being for the greater part of the year little
else than chains of ponds. Their channels are, how-
ever, of considerable depth ; and though frequently
almost dry in the hot season, a mighty flood rushes
along during the winter. The Province is not, how-
ever, deficient in its supply of water ; for even after
the streams have ceased running, abundance remain
in the pools, many of which appear to be supplied by
springs.
There is one striking exception to the foregoing in
the river Murray, which has been before named as
united with the Murrumbidgee of New South Wales.
This noble river has recently been navigated by steam-
boats a distance of 1200 miles from its entrance at
the Lake Alexandrina.
The other streams at present known in South
Australia are the Inman, Hindmarsh, Sturt, Torrens,
Gawler, Hutt, Bremer, and the Angus ; also a few
others falling into or running towards Gulf St. Vincent.
The Lakes of South Australia are few in number ;
the most important is Lake Alexandrina at the
eastern extremity of Encounter Bay. This lake is
estimated at from 50 to 60 miles in length, and from
30 to 40 in breadth.
At the head of Spencer?s Gulf is another lake
called Lake Torrens, said to extend, in the shape of
horse-shoe, over a circuit of at least 400 miles.


The extent of this lake has not, however, been as yet
accurately defined.
Of the harbours of South Australia, the only one of
importance is that of Port Adelaide, which is situate
on the eastern shore of Gulf St. Vincent in 34� 51'
south lat. 138� 31' east longitude. There are two
entrances from seaward ; the northern is shallow,
the southern contains deep water for about ten miles
above the bar, at which there is a light-ship ; steam-
tugs are employed to take vessels up to the an-'
chorage near the wharfs, abreast which four or five
ships of 600 or /00 tons can lay and discharge their
cargoes.
There are several smaller bays and harbours, but
not any of them of importance.
The principal located districts of the Colony, which
has been divided into eight counties, are situated
between St. Vincent?s Gulf and the Murray, on the
east and west, and between Broughton River and
Encounter Bay on the north and south.


CHAPTER 111.
Climate and Seasons?Temperature and prevailing Winds?
General Healthiness of Australia?Forest Trees?Plants ?
Productiveness of the Soil?Vegetables and Fruits?Animals,
Birds, Fish, and Insects?Minerals ?Precious Stones?The
Aborigines.
The climate of Australia is generally most con-
genial to Europeans. A greater proof of which
cannot be adduced than the fact, that during the
expeditions of Mitchell, Sturt, Eyre, Leichhardt, and
other explorers, they lived for months without any
other canopy than the clear blue sky so peculiar to
Australia ; and notwithstanding scanty and innu-
tritions or saline food, they enjoyed wonderfully
good health, such as they could not possibly have
maintained under similar circumstances in any other
part of the world. The position of Victoria, lying
more south than any other portion of Australia, gives
it a rather cooler climate than either New South
Wales or South Australia. Yet th# general descrip-
tion of the climate here given is applicable, with but
slight variations, to each of the settlements. Fires
are agreeable in the mornings and evenings for six
months of the year. The changes of temperature
are, however, very rapid ; whilst the hot winds which


blow annually are of brief duration. These com-
mence generally about the middle or end of Novem-
ber, and recur at intervals throughout the summer
until towards the end of February. The average
temperature of spring is 650 s', of summer 720, of
autumn 66�, and of winter 55�. At times, however,
the thermometer frequently rises to 110�, and some-
times even higher, previous to the setting in of the
hot winds. During the summer months a regular
sea breeze sets in daily, the south wind being cool.
The hot winds are invariably from the north. The
westerly wind is considered the most unhealthy, and
the easterly the most salubrious.
There are no endemic diseases, fevers, or agues.
The dry, warm, and elastic atmosphere is, besides,
peculiarly favourable to asthmatic and pulmonary
complaints. It is true that the summer months are
hot, and occasionally for a few days are aggravated by
the prevalence of the ? hot winds,? which are accom-
panied by clouds of dust. Although the day may
be very hot in the summer, the sun once sunk below
the horizon a considerable change takes place in the
temperature of the atmosphere. The brilliancy of
the Australian slfy cannot be described : it must be
seen to be appreciated; the sky is almost always
serene; when it rains it is overcast, but there are
none of those gloomy days, with a thick murky
atmosphere so common in this country. An absence
of frost and snow does not however constitute an


absence of cold during the winter; as before sunrise
on a sharp July morning, your fingers out of doors
would soon be benumbed with cold.
Count Strzelecki, in his work on the Climate of
New South Wales, says, ?As to the colonial tem-
perature, which comprehends so many different
climatic effects and agencies, the reader cannot but
be struck with the range and favourable thermo-
metrical condition in which every locality, illustrated
under the head of temperature, is found to be placed,
when compared to other localities on the globe.?
?Port Macquarie (lat. 31� 23' south), in that
comparison, is seen to possess the summer of Flo-
rence, Barcelona, Rome, or Naples. The winter of
Funchal, or Benares, and a thermometrical fluctua-
tion similar to that of Dublin; by its annual mean
it may be classed with the climate of Tunis.?
Port Jackson, again, is by a similar comparison
found to have the summer of Constantinople, Balti-
more, or Philadelphia.
Port Phillip resembles, in its summer season,
Marseilles and Bordeaux ; in its winter, Palermo,
or Buenos Ayres.
? But what mainly illustrates the fertility and salu-
brity of these countries, is the healthiness of the
English settlers who have taken root in the soil.
No endemic disease, and seldom any epidemic of a
grave character, prevails; and if individual indis-
position, or even partial deterioration of the pro-


geny, is sometimes seen, it is to be traced to the
pertinacity with which the English race cling to their
original modes of living wherever they settle, and
however different their adopted may be to their
native climate.?
The seasons are the opposite of those in England.
The autumn months are March, April, and May; the
winter June, July, and August; and the summer
December, January, and February. March, April,
and August, are generally considered the rainy
months. The longest day in December is about
fourteen hours, and the shortest in June about ten
hours. As Australia is the land of contraries, it may
be observed that the north breeze is the hot wind,
and the south the cool, the westerly the most un-
healthy, and the east the most salubrious; it is
summer with the colonists when it is winter at home,
and the barometer is considered to rise before bad
weather, and to fall before fine.
Vegetable Productions. ?The greatest portion
of the mass of vegetation in Australia belongs to the
natural orders of Proteacece, Epacridce, Myrtacea,
Leguminosce , and Composetce ; but the most common
genera in Australia are the Eucalyptus and Acacia,
which, if taken together, nearly equal all the other
plants of the country. Of the former above 100
species have been discovered, most of them trees
remarkable either for their vast height or enormous
dimensions; the Eucalyptus Globulus having been


observed to attain a height of 150 feet, with a girth
near the base of 25 to 40 feet. Of the Acacias nearly
100 of the leafless species have been observed.
The Epacridce , with its allied genera, are almost
as numerous, and hold the same rank in Australia as
the Erica or heaths do at the Cape of Good Hope.
The Orchidece are in great variety, highly curious in
the intertropical parts of the country. Of Palms
only six species have been discovered; of the genus
Casuarina, 13 Australian species have been disco-
vered. The Coniferese are few in number but very
fine, in particular the celebrated Norfolk Island Pine,
occupies an extent of 900 miles of the coast of
Australia.
Among the Aspodelea, the genus Xanthorrhea is
the most remarkable; all the species yield a gum.
This tree attains the size of a walnut tree, growing
pretty straight for 14 or 16 feet, after which it
branches out in long spiral leaves, which hang down
on all sides, resembling those of the larger kinds of
grass or sedge : from the centre of the leaves springs
a foot-stalk 20 feet long, resembling the sugar cane,
and terminating in a spiral spike not unlike an ear of
wheat. This stem is used by the natives for spears,
the end being hardened by fire. The tree yields a
fragrant-scented yellow resin, which has been found
extremely balsamic.
The Red Cedar of Australia is a valuable timber,
the finer specimens of which are equal in richness


and beauty to any mahogany. It is found on the
alluvial land along all the rivers of the island.
Iron-bark.?This tree grows plentifully in the
forest, and is suitable for house or ship-building.
Blue-gum is a valuable hardwood timber, and well
adapted for carpentry work.
Box is well suited for the manufacture of agricul-
tural implements.
Forest-oak is suitable for tool-handles, bullock-
yokes, &c.
Some of the Eucalypti attain a great size, and run
up like solid columns, for sixty feet without a limb.
Trees for timber purposes are usual about twelve feet
in circumference. Many flowering shrubs are to be
found in the woods, and a great variety of everlasting
flowers. There are the castor-oil plant, the wild
indigo, and the native currant and raspberry trees.
The mimosa?although it sadly chokes the country
?when in flower, fills the air with fragrance. Its
bark is much used for tanning purposes; and the
gum that exudes from the stem is of some value as
an export. In the scrubs is found a tree commonly
called ?'the nettle tree.? It is often thirty feet in
height, and has a large, broad, and green leaf; and
the pain caused by touching the leaf is said to be
worse than that occasioned by the sting of a wasp.
Most of the foregoing trees rise to an astonishing
height; there are vast forests with scarcely a tree
that is not from 50 to 80 feet in height without a


branch, while the entire elevations of a forest is
seldom less than 120 feet.
Of the productiveness of the Australian soils there
cannot be a doubt. Many farms have been annually
cropped for twenty years without manuring. The
eucalypti trees, by shedding their bark, annually
furnish an ample supply of alkalies to the soil.
Nearly every vegetable and fruit found in England,
as well as those of the tropics, grow most luxuriantly
in various parts of Australia.
Australia possesses no large animals, and few varie-
ties. Two-thirds of the Australian quadrupeds make
their way by springing in the air. The principal of
these are the kangaroo, of which there are several
varieties?from the kangaroo rat, to the ?Forester?
?which stands from four to five feet high. The
female, in common with other quadrupeds of this
country, has a pouch in which she carries her young,
and within which are the udder and teats. The
bound of the kangaroo is prodigious, sometimes
twenty paces, and this can be kept up for some
time with the fleetest greyhound. The kangaroo
is very timid, except when hard pressed for life,
when it will set its back against a tree ?boldly await
the dogs?and rip them up with its hind claws, or
give them a formidable squeeze with its fore-arms
until the blood gushes from the hound?s nostrils;
sometimes the animal will take to the water, and
drown every dog that comes near it.


The wallaby seldom weighs more than 30 lbs., but
is like the former in appearance. The flesh is much
superior in flavour to the others. The kangaroo-rat
and kangaroo-mouse are two varieties of the same
species; the former is about the size of a rabbit; the
latter considerably smaller. They are night animals,
sleeping during the day.
The flesh of every description of the kangaroo is
wholesome and nutritive, very savory, and easily
digested. It has no fat except a small quantity
round the tail ; this part makes excellent soup, and
is highly esteemed in the colony. The skin makes
good leather, and in New South Wales forms an
article of export. This peculiar animal is, however,
fast disappearing before the abodes of civilized man.
The opossum tribe, which is very numerous, and
similar to those found in America, usually take up
their residence in the hollows of decayed gum trees.
They are perfectly harmless and inoffensive, and form
a principal part of the animal food of the aborigines.
The native dog is, next to the kangaroo and opos-
sum, the most numerous quadruped, and is the
largest carnivorous animal known in Australia. It
is something like the Indian jackall, about two feet
high, two feet long, with head like a fox, and erect
ears, is strongly made, very swift, and has a most
dismal howl. It commits serious depredations
amongst sheep and poultry.
The bandicoot is about the size of a common rat;


it burrows in the earth, and feeds upon roots. Its
flesh is highly esteemed by the natives.
Of domestic animals, the horse, horned cattle,
sheep, goats, and swine have been introduced with
the greatest success. The climate and pasture are
highly adapted to the production of these animals.
The horned cattle are in many instances of a gigantic
size, and the fleece of the sheep is greatly improved.
Birds are numerous, of great variety, and often of
a beautiful plumage. Of these the emu may be
justly termed the ? ostrich of New Holland.? When
standing erect, it measures from five to six feet in
height; it has no wings, but runs very swiftly, out-
stripping the fleetest dog, and kicking with such
violence as to break a man?s leg ; it has no feathers,
its covering being more like hair. From six to
eighteen eggs have been found in the same nest,
which are of stronger flavour than those of the
ostrich. One portion of the emu is good eating, the
flesh being like beef; but it has a large quantity of
fat, which is very oily. The emu, like the kangaroo,
is also fast disappearing.
The gigantic crane, a most stately bird, about six
feet high, is seen on the borders of rivers, or lakes,
where also the black swan is to be found.
The bustard, or native turkey, weighing from 16
to 18 lbs., is good eating. Eagles and hawks are
everywhere to be met with?some white and very
large, measuring nine feet from wing to wing.


There are about thirty varieties of the pigeon,
among which is the crested bronze-winged.
The parrot and cockatoo are very abundant; some
are of a milk-white, others black, richly variegated
on the tail with red, and with superb crests. There
are also numerous birds whose ornithological charac-
ters are not yet fixed. The doves, for variety and
plumage, are unequalled in any part of the world.
The spur-winged plover frequents the open parts of
the country, and is remarkable for having a large
spur upon the shoulder of each wing, with which
it fights desperately. Of pheasants there are two
kinds, and of magpies three. The carrion crow and
swallow are everywhere found. Among the feathered
tribes must be noticed a butcher-bird, called the
? laughing jackass,? so termed from its note resem-
bling the coarse and boisterous laugh of a man, but
louder and more dissonant; Snipes, quails, king-
fishers, and coots are abundant. There are also a
few insectivorous and numerous suctorial birds, and
a few small finches of Indian genera.
The aquatic tribes are nearly similar to those found
in other countries, such as the pelican, penguin, goose,
duck, teal, widgeon, frigate-bird, noddy, petrel, gull,
and other ocean birds.
The inlets, bays, and waters along the coast of
Australia abound with fish, but are not so plentiful
in the rivers, especially in those on the east side of
the Blue Mountains, owing to the rapidity of their


currents. The cod-fish is taken in the fresh-water
rivers to the westward and southward of the Blue
Mountains in great quantities, and of a large size, of
which the Murray cod, weighing sometimes 70 lbs.,
is not only the largest but the best. The mallaway,
a species of cod, furnishes useful isinglass and good'
oil. The cod-fish of these rivers are delicious eating,
as are also the eels, which are caught of the weight
of 12 lbs. to 20 lbs. Perch, covered with scales and
prickly fins, abound in the eastern coast rivers, and
in flavour and delicacy bear an analogy to the sole.
There are also the mackerel, mullet, snapper, and
many varieties of other fish with which the markets
are well supplied. The whale frequently come into
the bays to calve ; and the seal is found in different
coves, especially to the southward.
The shells of the Southern ocean are highly prized,
in particular the family of the volutes; of these the
snow-spot volute, the cymbiola magnifica, the lineated
volute, are extremely valuable. Fresh water muscles
and shrimps are obtained in great numbers. The
oysters round the Australian shores are extremely
plentiful, and though generally small, of a delicate
flavour.
Insects are very numerous, and of every variety,
and afford a wide and entertaining field for the natu-
ralist, many of them being extremely beautiful and
curious. Locusts are common in some parts of
Australia. Mosquitoes are disappearing from the


town. Flies are very abundant and troublesome, one
species in particular, called the hlow-jly , taints and
putnfies any thing it touches. Fleas are also very
troublesome. Butterflies are neither plentiful nor
beautiful. There are three kinds of bees, and all are
without stings : they form their hives in the hollows
of trees and rocks, and produce a great deal of deli-
cious wild honey, English bees, which have of late
years been introduced, multiply fast. Of ants there
several varieties ; the ? gigantic? ants are nearly one
inch in length. Spiders are very large in general.
Caterpillars, at times (at intervals of several years)
swarm in incredible numbers, blighting the finest
wheat-fields in a few hours.
The reptile tribe is not very numerous. There are
guanos and lizards of various kinds. Of snakes there
are several varieties, a few of which are poisonous.
The diamond snake reaches 12 to 15 feet in length,
but is not poisonous. Scorpions, centipedes, and
tarantulas are also met with; but the sting of the
former, and the bite of the two last, although pain-
ful, are seldom known to prove fatal.
Australia abounds with mineralogical treasures?
gold, copper, coal, tin, iron, and lead have been dis-
covered. Many years since Sir Roderick Murchison,
the eminent geologist, predicted that gold would be
extensively found in Australia ; but it was not till the
eventful year 1851 that the existence of gold became
a matter of fact, and it now appears that the whole


country from South Australia to the East coast of
New South Wales, along the great mountain range,
may be termed auriferous.
Copper ore, of rich quality, is found in great
abundance in South Australia, and also in New
South Wales. In South Australia there are about
35 mines, of which about one-half are working.
Most of these are copper, some copper and lead;
five lead and silver-lead, and one copper and
gold. These mines are all within 100 miles of
Adelaide, except two which are close to available
harbours.
In New South Wales there are beds of copper ore,
in the district of Wellington, supposed to extend for
miles in every direction. There is a rich vein of
copper also at Bathurst. Coal exists in several dis-
tricts of New South Wales, but especially in the
country south of Hunter?s river, which is an exten-
sive coal-field. Coal is also abundant at Newcastle,
and the beds of coal and iron may be seen along the
banks of the Paramatta river, and in other places.
Coal abounds in the vicinity of the burning Mount
Wingan, and near the Kingdom chain of ponds also at
Moreton Bay. Coal has also very recently been found
in Victoria, between Port Phillip and Western Port.
Precious stones have been found in each of the
colonies, though not at present of any marketable
value. Amongst these are the ruby, sapphire, and
amethyst.


Ihe aboriginal population of Australia possess the
thick prominent lips, sunken eyes, high cheek bones,
and calveless legs of the African, differing however in
the hair which is long and coarse. The colour of
the skin and hair is in general black ; but some
tribes have been seen of a lighter colour, approach-
ing that of a Malay, with hair of a reddish cast.
They are, in general, of the middle stature; the
women being small and well made, the hands and
feet small, the shoulders finely rounded, but the
abdomen frequently protuberant, and the arms long.
As is the case with all savages, the head is the prin-
cipal part for decoration; some divide the hair into
small parcels, each of which is matted together with
gum, and formed into lengths like the thrums of a
mop ; others, by means of yellow gum, fasten on to
their heads the front teeth of a kangaroo, the jaw-
bones of a fish, human teeth, feathers, tails of dogs,
&c. Oil is used for preserving the skin from mosqui-
toes, &c. Most tribes have, in the males, a front
tooth struck out; and the women are frequently
observed with a joint of the little finger cut off. In
general, it may be said, that the whole of the abo-
rigines of this vast island are of the same stock,
though it is singular that their language differs so
much that tribes within short distances of each other,
unless inhabiting the bank of the same river, are
quite strangers to each other, while almost every
large community, or family, as they may be termed.


have their own peculiar dialect. Of their numbers it
is difficult to form any idea ; depending, however, as
they do, entirely on the chase or fishing, or on gums,
grubs, or bulbous roots, and subject to the effects of
long droughts, the country is very thinly peopled.
The natives have no settled place of abode, and con-
sequently no fixed habitation. When the family,
either from vicinity to the grubs, or other strong
inducements, determine to settle for a time upon a
particular spot, they pull down some branches of
trees and construct a few huts, about four feet high,
and in form of a bee-hive cut in half; they are thus
quite open on one side, and at night they keep a large
fire. The nearest approximation to ingenuity is the
fishing-net, prepared by the women from fibres, or
grassy filaments. Their only cutting implements are
made of stone, sometimes of jasper, fastened between
a cleft stick with a hard gum. Their arms of offence
or defence are simple and few in number. Their
spear and throwing-stick, boomerang, several kinds of
waddies, a small stone tomahawk, and a small ill-
formed shield made Of bark, are their only warlike
implements.
The spear is about ten feet long, as thick as the
finger, tapering to a point, sometimes jagged or
barbed, and hardened in the fire; this they can
throw from 50 to 60 feet with great precision, the
impetus being greatly increased by the use of the
womera, or throwing-stick, which acts somewhat on


the principle of the sling, enabling a powerful man to
send the spear?some say?to the distance of 100
yards. The boomerang is a curious weapon?it is of
a crooked form, made of a piece of hard'wood, 30 to
40 inches in length, 2| to 3 inches wide at the broadest
part, and tapering away at each end nearly to a point.
The concave part is from one-eighth to one-fourth of
an inch thick, and the convex quite sharp : a native
can throw this simple instrument 30 to 50 yards,
horizontally skimming along the surface, not more
than 3 or 4 feet from the ground, without touching
which it will suddenly dart into the air to the height
of 50 or 60 yards, describing a considerable curve,
and finally fall at his feet! During the whole of this
evolution the boomerang keeps turning with rapidity,
like a piece of wood revolving in a pivot, and with a
whizzing noise.
The waddies are clubs of different size and solidity;
the tomahawk is a piece of sharpened stone, frequently
quartz, fixed in a cleft stick with gum: with this
they cut notches in the trees, and ascend them to the
height of 60 feet, though without a branch, and far
too thick to be grasped.
Of religion?no form, no ceremonial, no idol, has
ever been discovered amongst them ; but they possess
many superstitious habits. They have scarcely any
idea of futurity. Europeans are considered reani-
mated beings who had formerly been their ancestors.
The dead are generally buried in graveyards of con-
siderable extent, the earth elevated in an oval shape.


CHAPTER IV.
The Discovery of Australia, with a Sketch of the Rise and
Progress of the three Colonies to the end of 1853.
The magnitude of the interests involved in the
progress of the Gold Colonies would seem to impart
additional value to any facts bearing upon those set-
tlements, and hence it is thought that the intending
emigrant may, in addition to the present, feel a desire
to glean some information respecting the past of
Australia. With the view, therefore, of satisfying
this wish, the following condensed summary of the
discovery and settlement of the principal Australian
Provinces is laid before the reader.
It was undoubtedly the Portuguese, who, under
the command of YaSco de Gama, first opened the
way to the East; and there is reason to believe they
had visited some part of the Australian continent
early in the sixteenth century. But the first authen-
ticated discovery of Australia was made by the
Dutch in 1605-6, from which period until 1627
several Dutch ships fell in with various parts of this
continent, but nothing certain was known until 1644,
when the Dutch Government despatched Captain


Abel Jans Tasman, who had previously discovered
the west side of New Zealand, with instructions that
after passing the land of Arnhem, he should ? follow
the coast further, as it may run westward or south-
ward, endeavouring by all means to proceed, that we
may be sure whether this land is divided from the
Great known South hand or not.? From this ex-
pression it is evident that the Dutch had acquired a
knowledge of some part of the Terra Austral, to
which they about this time gave the name of New
Holland.
In 1663 Thevenot published his chart of the West
Coast of the Great South Land,
In 1669 Dampier was sent in H. M. S. Roebuck,
on a voyage of discovery, and visited the west and
north-west coasts ; after which, several commanders,
English and Dutch, discovered other parts of this
great continent; and in 1/69 the celebrated Captain
Cook, then on a voyage of discovery, made the coast
of New Holland, and, to use his own words, e( sur-
veyed the east coast of that vast country which had
not before been visited, and passed between its
northern extremity and New Guinea,? thus demon-
strating beyond a doubt the fact of New Holland
being an island, which was not, however, actually
proved until after the formation of the British penal
settlement at Port Jackson (Sydney) in 1788, when
Mr, Bass, surgeon of H. M. S. Reliance, and Lieut,
(afterwards Captain) Flinders, in a little boat called


the Tom Thumb , eight feet long, aided only by a boy,
commenced a survey of the coast (1/98), and ex-
plored the southern shores for 600 miles. He entered
what Furneaux considered a ? deep bay, ? and be-
came satisfied that there was a strait separating Van
Diemen?s Land from New Holland; this is now
known as Bass?s Strait.
In 1802, Capt. Baudin, of the French navy, and
Capt. Flinders, met in Spencer?s Gulf, each being
employed in a survey of New Holland. The gradual
progress of Australian discovery from this period is
better detailed under the heads of the respective
colonies or settlements.
The first detachment of convicts and soldiers,
under the command of Capt. Arthur Phillip, landed
at Port Jackson on the 26th January, 1788, and on
its shores laid the foundation of the present flourish-
ing city of Sydney. The progress of the new settle-
ment, although retarded by mismanagement and
many mischances, was on the whole more rapid than
under the circumstances, might have been expected.
So early as the year 1795 printing-presses were in
use for printing the Government orders, and eight
years later the first Australian newspaper made its
appearance, with the sanction of the authorities,
under the title of the ? Sydney Gazette and New
South Wales Advertiser.?
In 1802 the foundation of the first brick church


was laid, and in 1803 the first Australian ship was
built in Sydney Cove.
The colony had not long been established when
explorations were made into the interior in several
directions, by which means some idea was arrived at
of the vast extent of pasturage of excellent quality.
The banks of the Hawkesbury, richly clad with
verdure, first attracted attention, and gave promise
of the rich fertility which has ever since been their
characteristic.
In the year 1810, Governor Macquarie made a
tour of inspection through the interior, penetrating
farther than any settler had yet gone. He went up
the river which now bears his name across the Blue
Mountains to the Plains below, and selected the site
for a new town, now known far and wide as the
capital of the gold country of that colony, Bathurst.
Up to 1821, about 400,000 acres of land had been
disposed of by Government to private parties by sale
or free grants, the greater part by the latter mode.
The penal settlement of Moreton Bay was founded
in 1824, and an overland journey undertaken to Port
Phillip, at that time an uninhabited wild. In 1829
the first Legislative Council was established according
to Royal Charter, and in that year, Trial by Jury
took place. Two years later the first steamboat was
launched, and the first Australian College established.
At this period also, free grants of Crown land were
abolished and replaced by pubh?c sales at an uniform


upset price of five shillings the acre. With this began
the Colonial Land Fund, one of the first fruits of
which was the importation of free emigrants as la-
bourers at the cost of the fund.
With this period a new industrial and social era
broke upon New South Wales. The breeding of
sheep was becoming a pursuit of some value and
extent, and already the Australian Wools were be-
coming known in England. Agriculture went rapidly
ahead with the stimulus gained from the accession of
free labour, whilst on every side new towns were
springing up, and the older towns w?ere assuming a
more solid and architectural character. It would be
difficult and almost impossible to follow the growth
of New South Wales from this period until the pre-
sent time with anything approaching to detail. It
must suffice to tell that with the growth of the wealth
and numbers of the colonists, free institutions were
given, though not without some struggles.
The deliberations of the Legislative Council were
thrown open to the public in 1838. Two years later
transportation ceased, and it was found in 1841 that
the population amounted to 87,200 males, and 43,500
females. The year 1842 was a disastrous period for
the colony ; not less than six hundred persons took
the benefit of the Insolvent Act, and the whole com-
munity was on the verge of bankruptcy. In the
year following, representative institutions were esta-
blished in New South Wales, and the first popularly


elected members took their seats in the Legislative
Council.
The opening of the Tallow trade, the exportation of
horses to India and the Eastern colonies, the settle-
ment of the land regulations, the extension of the
representative institutions of the colony, and the
generally improved prospects of agriculturists and
traders, materially influenced the progress of New
South Wales during the next seven years. The
crowning event of all these was that of the discovery
of gold in the early part of 1851, the treating of
which belongs to another chapter. It will suffice here
to remark that this promising colony has now a popu-
lation of fully 120,000 males, and 85,000 females,
and that its exports exceed seven millions sterling
per annum.
South Australia was first regularly arranged and
laid down on our maps so long since as 1802, but
from that time until the year 1829 no notice seems
to have been taken of it. Captain Sturt at that
period visited it by an overland journey from New
South Wales, and explored much more of it than had
been hitherto known.
In the early part of 1836 the colony of South
Australia was founded upon what were termed the
self-supporting principles, as laid down by Mr. E. G.
Wakefield. In the month of December of that year
the first governor of the new colony, Captain Hind-
marsh arrived and proceeded with the settlement of


the city of Adelaide and the details of his govern-
ment. For some time all went well; the first allot-
ments of land in town and country commanded enor-
mous prices, so much so that the whole attention ot
the settlers appeared directed to land-jobbing, while
agricultural and farming pursuits were utterly neg-
lected.
So long as the money of the colonists lasted, and
whilst the Governor was able to draw supplies for the
support of the local establishments from the Home
Government it mattered not. But confusion soon fol-
lowed. A new governor was sent out in 1838 to be
recalled three years later. Without internal resources
the entire community found itself dependent upon
others for the means of support. Provisions rose to a
famine price : land fell to ruinous rates, and beggary
stared them in the face. The Governor?s bills on the
home treasury were dishonoured, and Adelaide be-
came insolvent. This was in 1841. At this date
there were but 3000 acres under cultivation, the
population being 15,000. But compelled at length
to turn their attention to agriculture and sheep, there
were two years later nearly 30,000 acres in hand
under various grain crops, besides about 400,000
sheep, and 30,000 cattle in the colony.
Matters then began to take a turn. Trade rallied,
and a little wool began to be exported, when at the
very right time the existence of valuable and extensive
copper mines on the Kapunda and Burra-Burra


ranges of hills turned the tide of fortune rapidly and
permanently in favour of South Australia. , The
enormous productiveness of these mines very soon
told upon the industry of the colony, and from that
period prosperity has shone upon it, and made this
one of the most promising settlements in Australia.
In 1850, the population amounted to 56,900
British and 7000 German settlers. The sheep num-
bered 1,200,000, cattle 100,000; whilst 64,728
acres were under culture chiefly with wheat and hay.
The exports of the colony amounted to .�453,688,
and the imports to �887,423. Of the shipments to
this country, �211,361 were in copper ore, and
�113,259 in wool.
The extraordinary discoveries of gold in the
neighbouring province of Victoria produced a second
crisis in the affairs of South Australia. The
rush of the greater part of the working popu-
lation to the diggings not only threw the indus-
trial resources of the colony into a state of absolute
stagnation, but abstracted all the vital means of
self support. Business was at a stand still, shops
were closed, and the Government was for the moment
powerless. But, fortunately, the resident manager
of the South Australian Bank conceived a project by
which ruin might be averted and prosperity restored.
This was to pass a Bullion Act, declaring that gold
when assayed by the Government authorities and
stamped as of a certain purity and weight should pass


current in place of coin. An assay office was esta-
blished ; a road was opened overland to the Victoria
diggings, and a gold escort formed, by means of
which the Adelaide diggers were enabled to remit
their earnings to the colony, which being assayed and
stamped, at once passed current. Business once
more flowed into its wonted channels ; the banks
found employment, and although the gold did not
bring back the labour that was so much needed, it
enabled the settlers to despatch larger supplies of
provisions and other articles for the Melbourne and
Geelong markets, in exchange for their gold. Agri-
cultural and farm produce, which before threatened
to he left on their hands valueless, became at once
profitable investments, and this very soon produced
its effect more generally, dhe value of landed and
house property recovered to above theii foimei
position. Application for land poured in upon the
Government, who sold as fast as they could complete
their surveys, and the final result appears to be that
South Australia will henceforth be the ? Garden of
Australia,? whence the inhabitants of Victoria will
draw their chief supplies of agricultural produce.
Of still greater importance than the event just
narrated has been the recent opening up of the river
Murray by Captain Cadell in a steam-boat built for
the purpose. The effect of this will be to render a vast
tract of fertile, but hitherto inaccessible country,
available to settlers, who, finding a means of trans-


porting farm produce from a distance of 1300 miles
to the sea-mouth of the river, will no longer hesitate
about cultivating that fine tract of country.
Some idea may be formed of the great extent of
country in South Australia alone, which will be bene-
fited by the navigation of the Murray, when it is
stated that there are, on a moderate computation,
2400 square miles, or 1,340,000 acres on the banks
of this river within the South Australian boundary,
the greater portion of which might be turned into
fine agricultural land. The sales of crown lands in
South Australia from January Ist to the end of
November, 1853, amounted to 190,362 acres, realis-
ing ,�262,522, 9s. The official returns up to July of
last year, show that whilst 895,553 acres of land had
been disposed of in the colony since its settlement,
there still remained 199,084,234 acres, of which
226,048 were surveyed and open to sale.
The copper mines, which had been thrown back by
the flight of labour to the gold fields, are once more
in operation, and giving promise of being more pro-
lific than ever. The Burra-Burra mines have yielded
90,000 tons of ore since their first working, some
years since.
Although first settled at about the same period
as South Australia, the colony of Port Phillip, now
known as Victoria, did not attract any great atten-
tion, until the discovery of gold in New South Wales
led to similar results on a much more extensive scale


in that province. Owing its first development to the
sheep-farmers of Van Diemen?s Land, who passed
the Straits and located on the fertile, grassy plains of
Port Phillip, it was soon visited by hundreds of
Tasmanians and New South Wales graziers, with
their flocks and herds. In 1837, the site of Mel-
bourne, the capital, was fixed, and wooden houses
and stick huts rapidly rose on all sides.
Two years later, a Superintendant of the Port
Phillip district, with a staff of assistants and magis-
trates, was appointed, but still forming a part of the
Sydney executive, and receiving all their powers from
the Governor of New South Wales. In 1841, this
colony acquired a separate existence as regards its
finance, land funds, representation, &c., hut in other
respects was still a dependency of the elder province,
and it was not until 1852 that it was incorporated as
a distinct colony, under the title of Victoria.
The discovery of gold in New South Wales induced
many to go in search of the precious metal amongst
the elevated ranges of Port Phillip, especially as tales
were afloat of gold having been offered for sale by a
shepherd a few years previously. The result was the
opening of the Clunes and Ballarat gold fields, and
subsequently of those at Mount Alexander, and other
places. The influx of population, goods, and capital,
consequent on this fresh discovery, has placed Victoria
in a far more prosperous condition than any of the
adjoining colonies.


The population at the close of 1851 was 95,000,
at the end of 1852 it had risen to 200,000, and in
May, 1853 to 230, At the present date we may
assume the total population of the colony to be
250,000. In spite of this, however, there is still an
increasing demand for labour, and useful hands are
sure of finding immediate employment at high
wages.
The customs returns for the nine months ending
with October, shewed the total imports to have
amounted to �11,557,067, of which �9,018,396,
were from Great Britain, and �2,538,671 from other
ports. The total exports during the same period were
of the value of �9,560,851.
Town lots of land realise �BOOO an acre, and rents
are high in proportion, ranging from �3OO a year for
cottages to �2OOO for banking premises,

beginners ?Cattle-branding, a scene?Horses?Money easily
lost by Cattle ?Instances of successful Farming?The Aus-
tralian Tallow Trade.
In laying down some general rules for the guidance
of those emigrants, who may be thinking of turning
their attention to the rearing of cattle in Australia,
we would here mention that the following observa-
tions will apply with equal force to either of the
three colonies under notice, with but trifling modifi-
cations as to distance of cattle-runs from the towns,
and local regulations in regard to renting of open
lands.
To a recent date the rearing of cattle has been
mainly confined to ]New South Wales and Victoria,
but this is no longer the case, as the occupation is
becoming an important one in the neighbouring
colony of South Australia. There is one advantage
in this pursuit over that of sheep-farming, which is
that it may be commenced on a much smaller capital
with equal chance of success. For the latter, less
than would scarcely suffice, whereas <�2so may
with judgment be made to do for a store in the stock
line. These are, however, the lowest suras that it


would be prudent to make a beginning with; and
it must also be borne in mind that if not more than
or �3OO can be invested in cattle, bush-house,
outfit, &c., the proprietor must be content to be his
own stockman. The pay and rations of a hired
overseer would quite absorb all the profits of so
small an undertaking.
Tor a man of an independent turn, of active per-
severing habits, contented disposition, and not wedded
to home things and home fashions, there can scarcely
be a more pleasing and healthful occupation than
that of an Australian stock-keeper, Located in a
country the most favourable for such a mode of life,
with a fine climate, no contagious disorders, no dan-
gerous reptiles or destructive wild animals beyond
the native dog, with a daily occupation, monotonous
as it may appear, ever presenting some new feature
of interest, the bush farmer may lead a pleasant exis-
tence, free from the annoyances of European life. A
horse is a necessity to the stock-keeper, he would
find it impossible to attend to his cattle without one,
and a good one too, if his herd be numerous. To
give your cattle proper attention, you can scarcely
keep out of your saddle during the best part of the
day for the first year. After that time they will
have become thoroughly accustomed to each other,
and to the * run, as the allotment rented for grazing
is termed in the colonies.
It must not be denied at the same time that there


are disagreeables attending this bush life, though
after a time even the worst of these will cease to be
considered any hardship at all. In New South
Wales most of the cattle-runs are fully four or five
hundred miles distant from any settled district, and
of course far removed from any society, save that of
neighbouring stockmen or shepherds who may occa-
sionally look in upon an out-station man. The
monotonous fare, the sameness of daily occupation,
varied only by the escape of some of the herd, or by
the annual branding of the calves, are no doubt felt
for the first twelve months or so, but seldom for
longer.
The colonial high-roads leading to the principal
towns, are in most cases kept in capital order, but to
reach the ?bush? the farmer must quit these, and
strike off across country in the nearest direction
without looking for any beaten track. It is fortunate
for the ? squatter,? as the out-station man is called,
that the face of the country is one continued undu-
lating swell of open land, dotted over at irregular
intervals with patches of lofty timber trees or knolls
of low brushwood, with here and there a ravine, or a
gully, or a water-way breaking the facility of the
journey. The greater part of the Australian conti-
nent presents a series of park-like slopes, varied in
the back ground by the noble ranges of hills and
mountains which are to be found at some distance
from the sea coast, and as in the case of the Blue


Mountains, and the Pyrenees and Alps, reaching a
height of several thousand feet above the sea-level.
The ordinary conveyance used in Australia for the
transport of goods of every kind is the ? dray,? a
rude but strongly built bullock-waggon, well adapted
for traversing the undulating ground. For out-
stations, eight or ten bullocks are yoked to it, and the
driver in charge always carries a bag of tools, so as
to be able at all times to repair any damage that may
arise, with the exception of the iron-work, and even
in this emergency he will seldom be at a loss for some
contrivance.
In nine cases out of ten the newly arrived cattle-
rearer will be utterly unacquainted with the calling.
Even if he have had any knowledge of cattle at home,
he would do well to follow the advice here offered as
to first proceedings. One of the most necessary
steps to be taken is to acquire a knowledge of bush
life, of the ways, habits, diseases, and value of cattle,
of the best localities for them, and of the most
suitable buildings for the purpose. To acquire all
this the ? new chum,? as a fresh settler is colonially
termed, cannot do better than take service as a
volunteer stockman for at least one entire season.
At the end of that time a ride for a month or two
over the grazing districts will not be thrown away,
and then a selection of the ? run? from the lands
still open to fresh comers may be made. A squatting
license may be had sufficient for pasturing 640 head


of cattle for �lO, and for every additional 160 head
for a further sum of �2 105. One of the greatest
essentials for a ? run? is a good supply of water, and
a central spot adapted for the station or bush-farm.
In the selection of cattle too much care cannot be
exercised. It will be always preferable to purchase
from some well-established, respectable stock-keeper,
rather than at cheap town auctions, where it is
common to dispose of wild unmanageable creatures,
or cattle that have perhaps strayed away from their
proper owners. A writer on this subject speaking
from experience says: ?
? Cattle soon become wild in this colony if they are
not kept together and carefully managed. When a
herd has been purchased and brought upon a fresh
run (or new pasture) they must be tailed for four oi
six months, that is to say, one or two horsemen must
follow them from sunrise to sundown. At sundown
they are driven into the stock-yard for the night.
After a sufficient time they are allowed to run alone
both night and day, but the careful stockman, for
the first year or two, musters them daily on what is
called the camping ground. The camp is a place
generally shaded by trees, and near water, to which
the cattle resort during the heat of the day to sleep
and chew the cud. Toward evening, as the sun goes
off, they feed away in mobs of fifty or one hundred in
summer, and in eights or tens in winter. The same
cattle choosing their mates, and always keeping to-
gether.?


? In order to break in cattle effectually, they must
be ridden round daily, well flogged and driven in if
they are found straying when they ought to be at
camp. When this has been regularly practised for
two years, you may leave the herd for three or four
months without going near them, and very few would
be found to have strayed away. I have seen an im-
mense herd all rush into the camp at the crack of
the stockman?s whip.? Having once brought the
herd into this state of discipline, they are easily kept
so, and of course all the young cattle follow the
example of their elders, so that all further trouble on
this herd would cease.
There are, however, other methods of making a
beginning, should the ?new chum? feel as yet indis-
posed to take the responsibility of bush-life alone.
He may for instance make an arrangement with some
old established squatter of reputation to herd his
cattle for him for a term, taking all the trouble and
expense for the consideration of one half or there-
abouts of the increase. Sometimes herds are pastured
for the equivalent of all the spare milk for the manu-
facture of butter and cheese, but this is considered
objectionable as the calves are apt to be stunted in
food. A third plan is for the owner to pay a monthly
sum per head to a good careful herdsman having a
fine ?run,? and who for 6d or a-head will gua-
rantee their safety and good condition.
Once a year the calves are branded, and for this


purpose the whole herd is driven into the stockyard
of the station. This is an important and exciting
time, and as it involves some labour and fatigue, it
is usual for neighbours to join forces and help each
other. At these times there will be great gatherings,
and as most herdsmen are admirable riders, and there
are always a number of the cattle more or less averse
to leave their accustomed grazing-grounds for the
yard, a good deal of sport is certain to attend the
proceedings.
A scene so entirely new to dwellers in the old
country and yet of such frequent occurrence in the
Australian Colonies is worthy a passing notice in this
place, and we cannot describe it better than in the
life-like language of ? Sidney? the Bush author:
?At daybreak,? says our authority, ?after a most
substantial breakfast, the horses being got up and
saddled, the whole party, often twenty or thirty
horsemen, and about one hundred dogs, start into
the bush. All the cattle they can find are driven into
the camping ground by 12 o?clock. In a good season
(if the herd is quiet), when feed is plentiful, every
head will be swept off the run by that hour; but
when cattle are wild and grass scarce, they must be
got in by degrees, some of the party tailing them all
the time, and this will occasionally occupy weeks.?
? All the cattle being on the camp, the tug of war
commences. They resist being driven into the yard,
knowing, by experience, how they are knocked about


when they get there. The horsemen ride at them
with their formidable stockwhips, the dogs bite their
heels and hang on to their tails, and what with the
bellowing, barking, holloing and swearing, the riot
may be heard miles off by any stray traveller riding
over the silent plains and through the open forests.
Every now and then a beast or calf bursts out of the
herd and tries to head back to the bush. One or two
horsemen are after them as quick as thought ; their
dogs follow. Many bullocks are so quick in this
country that if they get a little start it will take a
good horseman to overtake them. The men ride like
madmen, taking the fallen logs and great creeks in
the ground in their stride ; their hats off, hanging by
the string on their backs; their long hair and beards
strewn on their shoulders, mixed with the gaudy flut-
tering handkerchiefs in which a stockman delights.
? As soon as the beast is pressed, he doubles sharp
like a hare, but a good stockman and a good stock-
horse doubles just as quick, round like a top. Some
horses seem to spin at will on their hind or fore legs,
like the loose leg of a compass round the fixed one.
Crack goes the horseman?s whip, as loud as a pocket
pistol, drawing blood at every stroke. Tin beast
doubles and doubles again, never turning until the
horse is close alongside. Wild cattle will often gore
a horse in these encounters. I knew a man who had
tw'o horses killed under him in this way by Black-
man?s cattle, near the Barvven, At last tired out, the


bullock is glad to make the best ol his way back to
the fold, his hide all covered with foam and blood,
his eyes glaring, and his tongue hanging out. Some
cattle break out like this fifty times between the
camp and the yard, and to see a horsemen
after half a score of beasts at best pace is a very lively
scene.?
Once within the stockyard and the work proceeds
more quietly, and at leisure. The sorting, counting,
and branding are carried on precisely as they would
be in this country.
Horsebreeding is frequently carried on by the
same parties, but to do any good in this a consider-
able capital, and more experience is needed. Thou-
sands of splendid animals are yearly raised in New
South "Wales both for sale on the spot, and for ship-
ment to India, where from their good breed they often
command from �5O to �lOO each. The cavalry
regiments of the East India Company?s army are
now mainly supplied from Australia.
There is seldom any scarcity of good useful hacks
for bush-life in any part of the country, and such as
those quite up to the work, may be brought unbroken
at three years old, from �lO to �25, according to the
locality.
The colonial mode of breaking in the young horses
for bush work is from a good authority : ? Drive the
herd into the yard, select a promising young colt,
throw a noose round his neck, and choke him till he


falls ; while he is on the ground fix a cavasson and
breaking tackle on him, keep the tackle on him day
and night, feeding him in the stockyard with cut
reeds or grass, lounge him two or three times a day
for three days, then mount him, accompanied by an-
other man on horseback, and ride after cattle; after
having had fifty or sixty miles the first day, hobble
him out?that is to say, confine his two fore legs
with a sort of fetter, which enables him to walk but
not trot or gallop. This usage repeated for a fort-
night makes him quiet enough for bush use. Bush
horses are very like park horses, but they can do
what park horses cannot. They can travel and
thrive, where park horses would starve and die.?
Without due care being exercised in the selection
of either cattle or horses, or either good management
afterwards, capital to any amount may be lost, as
indeed has but too often been the case. On the other
hand, numberless cases are on record in all the colo-
nies of ample fortunes being realised, and in the
generality of instances, a comfortable competency has
been the reward of care and industry, which qualities
it may be well to remind the reader are far more
valuable in a squatter of any degree, than downright
skill.
The Tallow trade is a branch of industry that has
sprung up from cattle and sheep farming, within a
comparatively recent period, and from a small be-
ginning has grown to large dimensions, the business


giving employment to many extensive boiling-down
establishments, and amounting in yearly value to
many thousands of pounds sterling.
This business had its origin in the panic and
low prices which some ten years since nearly ruined
the farming interest of the colonies. Sheep fell from
twenty-five shillings each to one and six-pence, and
cattle in the like proportion. Men with some means
speculated in animals, and having bought more than
they could well pasture, determined to slaughter the
greater part of their flocks and herds, and boil down
their fat for use to the tallow-melters of England.
At first the operation was performed in a slovenly
and imperfect manner, and the tallow sold for com-
paratively bad prices. Still the transaction was a pay-
ing one: the operation was repeated, and as more
care was bestowed upon the boiling and packing,
better prices were obtained in the London markets
until at length Australian Tallow ranks amongst the
best that is brought to this country. Now that more
fat animals are being taken for food by the enor-
mously increased population at the various gold fields
and in the large towns at high prices, much less
tallow is being sent home, which will no doubt con-
tinue to be the case until the increase in the herds
and flocks of Australia shall extend a-head of the
growth of the population.


CHAPTER VI.
Sheep-farming-?Capital and experience needed?Shepherding
in the Bush?Sheep-runs?Shearing time?Qualities of Wool
?Sheep the great starting source of Australia?s prosperity?
?Diseases of Sheep?Profits realised by sheep-rearing.
To attempt ?Life in the Bush?* as a sheep-owner,
something more in the way of both capital and expe-
rience is needed than in the case of stock-keeping.
The management of sheep, whether in health or
disease, requires a degree of watchfulness and know-
ledge not so rapidly attained as in the other case.
Neither would an investment of the like amount in
flocks answer as in herds. No doubt small beginnings
have been made, and with remarkable results, but
such have been made by the hands of old prac-
tised shepherds, who have gained their experience
through years of ? Bush life,? and by degrees in-
vested their savings in the purchase of sheep, which,
until they amounted to a number worth looking
after, were ? run? with the flocks of a neighbour, or
perhaps with those of their own masters.
To the fresh settler, having a moderate capital to
invest of from and upwards, we say what has
already been addressed to the intending stock-keeper.
Let him place his money out at interest, on good


security, for which there are always abundant oppor-
tunities ; and whilst this is accumulating at the rate
of ten per cent, he will be at full liberty to travel or
fix himself with some outside squatter for a year or
two, and in that way gather the best and most
valuable kind of information, the fruits of personal
observation and practice. This time will be well
spent, and the future sheep farmer will never regret
the brief delay. In no other place, and in no other
occupation, are the old adages more deserving of
observance, which tell us to ?look before we leap,
and again, ?not to run before we can walk.?
The same caution already given in regard to the
purchase of cattle will hold good as respects pur-
chases of sheep. Sydney or other town auctions of
flocks should be looked upon very suspiciously, if not
altogether avoided. The best time for purchases is
just before shearing, in September, though it may
not often be practicable to make bargains at such a
period. At any rate it would be well to examine any
flock intended for purchase at this time, as any
vestiges of scab will then be sure to be visible.
The shepherd?s life differs in some essentials from
that of the stock-keeper. He is not so much in the
saddle, and has not so much ground to go over, and
does not lead so exciting a life ; on the other hand,
far more watchfulness is needed, as sheep are more
susceptible of diseases, than cattle, and are besides
liable to the attacks of the JDingoe, or native dogs.


which, coming upon them at night in large herds,
sometimes kill great numbers before their presence is
suspected. These things, and the annoyance arising
from indifferent servants, often keep a sheep farmer
on anything but a bed of roses. Good shepherds
and good dogs, the latter of the Scotch colley kind,
or the Smithfield breed without a tail, should be
secured at almost any price, as without them all the
farmer?s own fagging and anxiety will go for very
little.
A great deal depends upon the settler making a
judicious selection for his sheep-run, equally so what-
ever the extent of it may be. Water is not only
needed for the use of the family in domestic ways,
but it is most essential to the farmer, as giving him
the means of well washing his large flocks of sheep
before shearing them?a process the importance of
which cannot be too highly estimated, as on the
cleanliness and brightness of the wool so much of its
marketable value depends. Of not less value than
water is a good supply of timber, as repairs of build-
ings, tools, and waggons, are always being needed.
For shearing purposes, the pools are of running
water, and in these the sheep are placed previous to
the removal of their wool, and well hand-washed by
the proper farm servants; from this they are con-
ducted to the drying paddocks, where they remain
for a few days, and then, being taken to the shearing
or wool-house, their beautifully white coats are


removed with the utmost expedition, generally without
being separated in the fleece. The wool is stored in
a separate building, where there are large wooden or
iron screw presses for compressing it into a small
compact body, in bags holding from 250 to 400 lbs.,
in which state it is ready to be conveyed to market
without any further preparation.
These operations are all necessarily conducted
about the dwelling of the farmer, and under his own
personal direction. Should the establishment be a
large one, as is often the case, the proprietor will be
aided by an overseer, and sometimes two, whose duty
consists in superintending every kind of work in
hand. In the shearing season there is little else going
on, but at other times the distance of the flocks from
the homestead renders it a laborious task to superin-
tend the condition of the whole.
The huts of the shepherds will be scattered
about at uncertain distances, according to the pas-
turage offering, and at each of these will be a hut-
keeper, whose duty it is to take charge of all within
the station, prepare the meals, and watch the flocks
during the night, whilst folded about the hut.
The flocks in charge of these shepherds will range
from a thousand to two thousand, and it is most usual
that two such flocks with their shepherds will be
located in one hut, having one hut-keeper between
them, who will not unfrequently be the wife of one


of them. The Bush life at these places varies but
little, with the exception of the shearing season.
The two shepherds, after an early meal, take their
departure with their flocks in different directions,
varying their road each day so as to come upon fresh
grass as often as possible. They proceed very slowly,
allowing the sheep to graze on their way, well spread
over the ground ; by noon, having proceeded perhaps
six miles, they will halt for the day. The shepherd
then rests himself beneath the nearest tree, opens his
pack-wallet, lights a ? bush fire,? makes tea, and
proceeds to enjoy a ? bush dinner? of mutton,
damper, and tea; the damper consisting of a kind
of plain cake baked on the embers of a wood fire, and
peculiar to this part of the world. A rest being thus
afforded to both animals and their conductor, the
shepherd turns homewards slowly as before, and
varying his path from the morning journey, generally
reaches the station in good time to see them all
folded before nightfall.
So much depends upon the skill and attention of
the farmer, that to state any general rate of profit
that he may expect is not an easy task. Some men
who have entered upon the business with several
thousands of pounds, and, as they imagined with a
proper knowledge of their work, have lost all they
possessed within a few years. These heavy losses,
however, have mostly arisen from the introduction of


the scab or influenza amongst their flocks, disorders
which cannot be too strictly guarded against. Others
again have made rapid fortunes, and many are at this
moment thriving from the dearness of provisions of
all kinds, and the high prices obtained from tallow
and wool, which indeed far more than compensate for
the dearness of labour.
A safe calculation made by those who are allowed
to be good judges in such matters gives an average
annual profit of twenty to thirty-five per cent, without
reckoning the gain from increase in the flocks.
With regard to the latter point, the increase from
breeding good ewes will commonly give more than
cent per cent of their number all round ; but it may
be safely estimated that thirty per cent of this
number will be lost in one way or the other, either by
dogs, during weaning, &c., so that an annual increase
of seventy per cent to reach maturity may, after all,
be reckoned on, and a most favourable result it is.
No doubt but that, whatever the final destiny of gold
digging may be, Australian sheep-farming will ever
continue a highly profitable occupation, so long as
wool and tallow are needed in this country.
We have in a previous chapter alluded to the
terms and conditions on which ? runs? may be rented
from the Crown. These vary but little in each of
the three colonies. Of course a great deal of the
success of farming, whether it be agricultural, sheep,
or cattle, must depend on the quality and lay of the


land. For sheep more especially this is the case, as
a damp soil and rank feed will soon show their effects
upon your flocks.
The main source of profit for the sheepifarmer is
unquestionably his wool, and this should receive his
constant and best attention. Next to a healthy state
of the animal is an abundant supply of water, and
also expert shearers. Good men of this class are
invaluable, and will always command work during
the season at excellent wages. They are paid by the
hundred, and for washing and shearing usually
receive �l 15s to �2 5s per 100. A skilful hand
will have no difficulty in turning out a hundred
fleeces a day for a week together. Carelessness in the
conditioning of the wool may make a difference of
six pence a pound in its selling price, equal to 56s
the cwt., the cost of cartage, packing and shipping,
being alike on good and bad, so that the result of the
two qualities will be very different.
With regard to the treatment of disease in sheep,
that is a study that had far better be pursued in the
colonies than here. The chief characteristics of the
scab, the influenza or catarrh, as met with amongst
the Australian flocks will be pretty nearly as they
are in this country, but local circumstances will con-
siderably modify their treatment. Six months with
a good shepherd in the bush will teach all that is
needed in this respect. In Victoria, influenza proves
very fatal at certain times, whereas in South Aua-


tralia it is scarcely known. But the scab may be
looked for in all positions, and must be carefully
guarded against.
A proper sheep-farm, calculated for several thou-
sand sheep, should consist as nearly as possible of a
superintendent?s house and store attached, which will
generally cost from �3O to �6O. Shepherds? huts
as many as needed at �6 or �8 each. A roomy
wool-shed, with suitable yards and wool-presses,
costing together say �250, or �3OO if put up in a
good substantial manner, which is generally the
cheapest in the long run. Besides these, you recpiiic
a horse paddock railed in, as also a plot of ground
fenced in for the culture of the necessary supply of
wheat, maize, oats, hay, potatoes, and other vege-
tables?this ought to be four rails, and will cost an
extra shilling a rod; a barn, �lOO ; corn and horse
sheds, �l2 ; a steel mill, �4 10s each.
These are about the contract prices, but it is a
common way to hire a carpenter, who with a pair of
sawyers fells neighbouring trees, and with the assis-
tance of your men, does all these works at wages. Of
course, if you understand and can take a turn at
such works yourself, it is'so much money sa\ed.*
To the emigrating shepherd, or indeed to any who
are disposed to take up with the life, Australia offers
great and lasting advantages. It really signifies hut
little what a man may have been previously, so long
as he he content with the kind of life that a bush
Sidney?s Handbook.


shepherd leads ; if he be willing to undertake the
duty, there are scores of farmers who will be only
too glad to secure his services as well as those of his
wife, as hut keeper, if he be fortunate enough to
possess one, for in that country a wife and family
so far from proving burthens, are in reality comforts
and supports.
That we are dealing with facts in stating this, may
be learnt by quoting the words of one who spoke
from his own experience of these matters, (G. B.
Wilkinson.) This Australian writer says :
? Within ten miles of the place where I lived, I
remember, as shepherds, one apothecary ; one lawyers
clerk ; one counting house clerk ; three sailors ; one
tailor; one Jew; one Portuguese sailor; one native of
Ceylon; one Australian black; one barman; one
gentleman?s son, brought up to no business; one
New Zealand merchant, who had been burnt out;
and a second Portuguese who could not understand
a word of English ; one person, late a Lieutenant in
the lion. East India Company?s Service; and one
gypsy* These parties were all either shepherding,
or hut-keeping, and the gentleman?s son, the Jew,
and the barman, made the best shepherds of the lot.
A few miles farther off, at a friend?s station, there
were a black fiddler and a dancing-master. A large
sheep owner told me, that he would sooner take a
sailor who hardly knew the head from the stern of a
sheep, or a clerk who had been in an office all his


life, than an English bred shepherd. The one class,
he said, would obey orders, and be afraid of losing
the sheep ; the other always thought they knew better
than their master.?
This being the case, the reader will at once perceive
how large a scope there is for emigration to the sheep-
farms of our Australian colonies. The wages paid in
New South Wales at the date of the latest advices
(Feb, lith), were to married couples, for shepherds
and hut-keepers, �55 to �65 ; do., do., with young
families, �5O ; shepherds, with rations, per annum,
�35 to �4O; old shepherds, 5640 to �45; hutkeepers,
per annum, with rations, �3O to �35 ; general farm
servants, with rations, 35s per week ; shearers, 45s
per hundred, and rations ; sheep washers, 30s per
hundred; ploughmen, 35s per week; bullock drivers,
with rations, 60s to 70s per week, on the road;
horse-teams, 40s to 50s. Higher rates are quoted
in some of the New South Wales papers, but the
above may be depended on as safe figures, and such
as are likely to be maintained for a long time to
come.
The value of labour in the Victoria markets, is
equally high with the above, and in steady active
demand. According to the advices to hand by the
?Marco Polo,? the following were the rates then
being paid at Melbourne :?Married couples, without
family, per annum, with rations, �BO to �llO ; ditto
with family, �7O to �75 ; married couples, forshep-


herds and hutkeepers, �6O to �7O ; do,, do., with
young families, �55 ; shepherds, with rations, per
annum, old shepherds, �45 to �5 2 ; hut-
keepers, per annum, with rations, �35 ; general farm
servants, with rations, per week, 30s to 355;
shearers, 30s to 36s per 100, and rations; sheep-
washers, 30s per 100 ; ploughmen, 35s to 40s per
week ; haymakers, 32s to 36s per week; mowers,
8s to 12s per acre, and provisions; bullock drivers,
with rations, 60s per week, on the road ; horse-teams,
40s to 50s; labourers, 30s per week, with rations;
day labour, from 10s to 12s, without rations;
reapers, 25s per acre ; hay-cutters and trussers, 40s
per week, or 10s per ton ; carpenters, 20s to 25s per
day; bush carpenters, with rations, per annum,
.�IOO to �l 10 ; stock keepers, with rations, per
annum, �SO to �7O; cooks, male, 30s to 60s per
week; grooms, with rations, per annum, �6O to
�7O ; gardeners, with rations, per annum, �75 to
�IOO.


CHAPTER VII.
Agricultural Prospects in Australia?Where most successfully
carried out?Fertility of the Soil?Quality of Grain?Labour
?Produce Markets.
To those persons of limited means, who while
they wish to lead a rural life in the New World, have
no taste for tending cn herds and flocks, and per-
haps, possess not sufficient capital for one or the
other, an excellent opportunity offers in the pursuit
of agriculture. With the constantly increasing po-
pulation of the gold colonies, sw?elled as it most
assuredly will be, by new comers from the old
country, with a thriving commerce, and an unlimited
resource in the mineral wealth of the country,
there will be a yearly increasing demand for what
in America are known under the general term of
? Bread Stuffs.?
At present, anh in all probability for many years
to come, the greatest demand for food will arise in
Victoria. Yet in that province scarcely any thing
has been done in the way of growing corn, or other
articles of vegetable food. The position of South
Australia, its fine climate, and its prolific soil, point
it out as the future granary and garden of that
part of the Australian continent. In New South


Wales, large crops of grain have been taken off the
soil for many years past, chiefly in the fertile val-
leys scattered along the nearest navigable rivers,
where homesteads may be seen scattered through as
fine a lay of country as need be wished for, and
where Australian farmers dwell in as much comfort
aud security as in any part of England. The Agri-
culturists of New South Wales have long since
become a class of some importance, many of them
having realized handsome fortunes, and preferring
the enjoyment of it in the land of their adoption,
to returning to this country.
There is so little difference in the climate, seasons,
and soil of New South Wales and South Australia,
and the system of agriculture pursued in both colo-
nies, so nearly resemble each other, that one general
description will suffice for both. We have, in a
former chapter, related how the colonists in the latter
settlement turned their attention to agriculture
during and after the monetary crisis which had
well nigh weighed them down. By far the greater
part of those who felt themselves compelled to turn
growers of corn, set about it in the utmost igno-
rance of farming operations. But few amongst
them could distinguish between a plough and a har-
row, or understood their respective uses, yet so
fruitful was the soil, aud so favourable the climate,
that soldiers, sailors, artizans, clerks, and profes-
sional men, found but little difficulty in raising large


crops of grain, which they were enabled to ship for
sale to the neighbouring colony of Victoria.
The Australian system of farming, even where
abundance of means are at hand, is of the most
simple description. The land requires neither fal-
lowing, dressing, nor manuring, and in place of
having recourse to rotations of crops, wheat is taken
from the same field year after year, without any per-
ceptible impoverishment of the soil. This, of course,
greatly simplifies the labour on a farm, and renders
it an easy matter for a novice to enter upon the
occupation. The following account of the ordinary
method followed in South Australia is given by Mr.
Wilkinson, a colonist of some standing, and con-
siderable local experience in these matters
? In the first place, the land is cleared, if neces-
sary; if not, the plough is at once put into the
ground, and dragged on by a team of six good strong
bullocks ; one man drives, another holds the plough,
and between them they break up one acre a day.
The ploughing does not commence until the land
has been softened by the rain, which commences in
May. The rainy season is called the winter, but
this name gives but a poor idea of that season to
persons who have been accustomed to the frost and
snow of a winter in England. There is no frost or
snow, or, more strictly speaking, it is so rare an
occurrence, that I only once remember having seen
ice, and that was in a cold hilly district. When the


wet season has commenced,"ploughing begins, and
as many acres as are required are broken up ; once
ploughing is all the land generally gets. Seed is
then sown broad-cast, and well scratched in by
heavy harrows; the wheat being covered over, the
work is done. By the time the blade appears
above the soil, the fencing should be completed,
to prevent the cattle from intruding. This is all
that is done until the grain has ripened and needs
cutting.?
Rude as is the Australian system of grain culti-
vation, the returns are ample, and the produce of
first-rate quality. The crop of wheat on new land,
once ploughed and harrowed, ranges from 15 to 40
bushels to the acre, and frequently weighs 65 lbs. to
the bushel. At the agricultural show in 1846, the
prize sample weighed 66f ; the second 66^-J-; and
the third, lbs. to the bushel. The barley also
weighed 56|, and other produce in proportion.
At the Great Exhibition in 1851, some magnifi-
cent samples of wheat and other grains were shown,
a proof that a succession of crops had had no inju-* ;
rious influence upon the land. In the Juror?s
Reports we read, that ?Adelaide stands preemi-
nent for wheat and barley. Prize medals have
been awarded both to R. Hallett and Sons, and to
Heath and Burrow, for wheat which may be con-
sidered as perfect as regards growth, equality of
grain, colour, weight, and quality.?


Such has been the progress of agriculture in this
colony, that in place of the inhabitants being com-
pelled to import considerable quantities of grain and
flour for their use, those articles are now not only
grown in sufficient abundance for their own con-
sumption, but are shipped to other places to the
yearly value of �50,000. ? ?
The latest advices from the Australian Colonies
give the following as the rate of domestic and farm-
servants? wages: ?Married couples for home stations

CHAPTER VIII.
The Trading and Banking Interests of Australia?Growth of
Australian Commerce ?Its Attractions and Dangers?
Increase in Local Banks ?Their Principle and Profits ?
Present condition of the Chief Towns of the Three
Colonies.
A nat ural result of the great increase in the flocks
and herds of Australia, of the South Australian
copper mines, and of the marvellous products of the
gold fields, has been a rapid growth of traders and
bankers, who to the present time appear to have
reaped an abundant harvest from the new sources of
wealth so suddenly and so widely presented to them.
Many of our readers may have their attention di-
rected to trade in those places, and will be glad to
learn something of the present aspect of business
matters in that new country.
A glance at a file of the ? Sydney Empire? or
the ? Melbourne Herald,?or the ?Adelaide�egister,?
will suffice to show an enquirer how multifarious
and exclusive are the dealings of Australian ? store-
keepers,? for that is the colonial name given to all
dealers wholesale or retail, not actually importing
merchants. A general ? store ? whether in one of
the capitals, or in a rural town, or at the diggings,
presents an equally motley appearance. Tin kettles,
silk dresses, pickled pork, new bonnets, provisions,


fruits, and stationery, are all to be met with in
strange companionship within these omnium gather-
urns. One principal reason for this trading jumble
of articles is, that bushmen and diggers coming in
from a distance are glad to purchase what they
require at one place, without the trouble of running
from store to store, and of opening two or three
accounts. Besides this, a farmer in the bush can
in this way send down his dray to his regular store-
keeper, if he cannot accompany it, and by sending
a list to him can depend upon receiving everything
he requires, from a cask of wine to a paper of pins.
In the older cities, such as Sydney, Adelaide, and
Melbourne, the traders? stores are on a large and
substantial scale, built of stone, brick, or wood,
and some of them containing a great amount of
property. In the smaller towns they will be very
humble affairs of stick and board, ?while at the
diggings the stores for a long time consisted of mere
tents of large size, and indeed many such are still
to be met with dignified with high sounding names,
such as the ? Universal Emporium? ?the " Royal
Victoria Mart??the ? Great Nugget Store,? &c.
Store-keeping, which previous to the gold disco-
veries had been always a lucrative occupation to
men of active, attentive, and prudent habits, became
at and after that event the means of realizing rapid
fortunes?not only did the price of every article
rise to fabulous prices, but as. gold came pouring


in on all sides, every one suddenly felt his wants,
or his fancied wants, increased fourfold. Price and
quality became matters of small moment, and so
long as sellers chose to ask, buyers were found to
give unheard of prices.
At the diggings the cost of every necessary rose
beyond the calculation of the most sanguine, for
there, in addition to the abundance of gold, the
heavy charges involved in transporting goods along
bad roads, as well as the enormous price of draught
cattle and fodder, had to be added to the current
profits of the traders. But those rates will no
longer be paid. The roads are improving. Com-
petition is springing up, and profits will before long
assume a more reasonable and safer feature.
The merchants of long standing conduct their
business on terms generally fair enough, but pru-
dent settlers will do well to lodge their little capital
on first arrival, in one of the local Banks, of which
there are several in each colony, of great respecta-
bility, and this, notwithstanding any tempting offers
of high rate of interest that may be held out as a
bait by the merchant. Sidney, who wrote on Aus-
tralian matters from actual experience, tells us
that?? Merchants are very fond of proposing an
open account, where the settler has the reputation
of ample resources. They are willing to supply the
stores for the station, on condition of receiving all
the wool for sale. At times they propose to ad-


vance Is. a lb. on the wool, charging 15 per cent
for the accommodation, and induce the squatter to
allow it to be sent home at his own risk, for the
chance of obtaining more than that price. Such
arrangements generally end in the ruin of the
squatter. No wool-grower with less than 100,000
sheep, and a capital sufficient to enable him to
send wool home under his own controul to his own
broker, should venture such an experiment. It
is much better in the end to close the transactions
with the merchant at the end of each year.
?To buy for cash, and to sell for cash only that
is the golden rule.?
That the commerce of Australia must be at
the present moment one of great magnitude may
easily be conceived when we reflect that the ship-
ments from Victoria to this country have in one
year reached the amount of �11,000,000, while
the British imports amounted to �7,000,000. Of
the former, the chief portion was gold and wool.
The Banking interest has progressed not less rapidly
than others. The old established ? Union Bank of
Australia,? the ?Bank of Australasia,? the ? Bank
of New South Wales,? the ? South Australian Bank,?
and one or two others, have reaped the full benefit of
being already in the field. Large profits have been
made with great rapidity ?as much as twelve per cent
interest having been in more than one case declared.
Most of these Banks have establishments in London,
where by lodging money and paying a trifling com-


mission, emigrants can obtain orders on the colonial
Banks for the amount so paid in.
The three former banks have establishments at
Sydney and Melbourne. The latter at Adelaide
only; the London Branch of this bank is at 54, Old
Broad Street, and other banks for similar purposes
have recently been established, but the above are,
by their local standing and influence, decidedly the
best channels for remittances.
best channels for remittances.
The following statement relative to the circula-
tion, deposits, etc,, of the Australian Banks in Sep-
tember last will enable the reader to form a correct
opinion of their business transactions and standing:

A trade in which such large sums have been made
A trade in which such large sums have been made
will naturally attract many to enter upon it. But
in venturing to the colonies as a dealer the emigrant
must bear in mind that great risks always attend
great profits. The first year after the gold disco-
veries was a rare exception to this rule; for then


undoubtedly it was all profit and no risk. Such,
however, cannot again happen. Great quantities of
all kinds of merchandise have been sent, in many
cases far too much, and, as it was impossible to find
store room for all that arrived, sales had to be made
on the sea beach to any one jvho would make a bid
of any figure. In this way losses have been severe,
and such may happen over again, unless the state of
the markets be more closely watched, and shipments
only made of such things as are really wanted, or
which, by their value and compactness, can afford
warehouse-rent at colonial charges.
For such energetic men as intend to take out a
well-selected assortment of goods, and proceed with
them to the diggings, or one of the inland towns
which are and will continue to be rising up in all
directions, there are still abundance of openings.
But in this case the trader must land with a spare
hundred or two at his command, or he will never
reach his destination. Having the means his best
plan will be to purchase a strong dray and pair of
stout teamsters, on which he can load his goods;
and, having by their aid arrived at the desired spot,
he will find no difficulty in reselling his conveyanoe
at a profit.
To enter upon such an undertaking as this, the
emigrant storekeeper will stand in need of an abun-
dance of energy, activity, patience, and management.
The difficulties of a bush-road are by no means,


trifling, even to old settlers, though it should be
borne in mind, that owing to the mildness and
healthiness of the climate for ten months out of
the twelve, much that would elsewhere be insup-
portable, is there easily encountered. Even when
his final destination is .reached there will he many
difficulties and hardships to encounter, and which
must be overcome if the settler would succeed in his
new calling. The all but impossibility of procuring
assistance of any kind in localities away from the
principal towns, the absence of all buildings, the
rough manners and habits of the diggers and bush-
men, all these are novel features in the newly
selected life of the recent arrival, who will surmount
his difficulties precisely in proportion as he brings
activity and intelligence to bear.
It is impossible to offer any advice to the settler
in large towns as to the description of goods he
should take with him. He must be guided by such
information as he can obtain direct from the colonies.
At the present moment crockery and glassware, and
some description of stationery and slops are in
demand and paying handsomely ; but this may not
be the case six months hence; such articles may
then be unsaleable.
There are, however, certain descriptions of goods
which, at out-stations or at the gold fields, are almost
always in good demand. These it will be well for
the intending bush storekeeper to bear in mind when


investing his capital here. Amongst those things
most in demand in the interior of all the colonies
may be named blankets, rugs, store canvas, cordage
and rope of various sizes, nails?of sorts, and some
simple carpenter?s tools, stout boots and shoes for
men and women, some of the former, if for the dig-
gings, to come up above the knee and waterproof,
felt hats, caps, waterproof capes?light and large,
riding belts, whips, regatta shirts, plain ditto stout,
with some finer of lighter cloth for ?warm weather
wear, unbleached cotton hose and half hose, women?s
slops and stockings, Tweed shawls, Paisley ditto,
canvas and duck trowsers, a few fancy waistcoats,
coloured cotton ditto, Guernsey shirts, black and
coloured neckhandkerchiefs, pocket ditto?silk and
cotton, an assortment of ribbons, fleecy hosiery,
shirts and drawers, needles, pins, tapes and threads,
a roll or two of flannel, a few pieces of calico, and
some cotton prints for women?s dresses. If these
are bought judiciously, not too many of a kind and
not too expensive, the adventure cannot fail to be
profitable. It would be well to add a little sta-
tionery, and a few common office books, ruled and
plain, to serve as stock-books, day-books, ledgers,
etc.
The progress of the principal trading-towns of
Australia, viz., Sydney and Bathurst, in New South
Wales; Adelaide, in South Australia ; and Melbourne
and Geelong, in Victoria, has fully kept pace with


the growing commerce and wealth of those colonies.
The value of land in and about these cities has
reached sums unknown in this country. In Ade-
laide, as much as 3050 per foot frontage has been
refused for ground plots having a considerable depth ;
but even if the depth were 210 feet it will be seen
that the price is equivalent to 3610,500 per acre;
and it is even said that for some very choice spots a
higher price per foot has been demanded. At the
land office in Sydney, on the 24th August last, a
sale of allotments on the old Barrack Square yielded
upwards of 3024,400. The allotments, which are
said to have comprised in the aggregate a space of
about an acre and a quarter, were put up at �lO
per foot frontage, and sold at prices varying from
�l6 to �47 10s per foot, and at an average, pre-
suming the calculation a correct one, very little below
,�20,000 per acre.
Sydney is by far the oldest city in Australia,
and there the buildings, streets, and public works,
have long since taken a permanent and half-English
character. Indeed, a new comer, walking through
one of its leading thoroughfares, seeing the omni-
buses, waggons, and vans rolling past him, with the
busy crowd of passengers and well-filled shops, and
hearing the well-known London cry of ? Cab, sir,
cab?? may easily imagine himself in some part of
the great metropolis. Bathurst, the capital of the
New South Wales gold district, although two years


since little better than a collection of log huts, plank
houses and tents of a motley description, is fast rising
into importance. Substantial stores, well built
dwellings and pretty villa residences, attest the accu-
mulating wealth of the province, whilst good roads
are in course of construction on several sides.
A recent letter from Melbourne thus describes the
present appearance of the capital of Victoria:?
? Melbourne is built on the slope of a hill, laid
out in Yankee fashion?streets wide, and at right
angles to each other; none of the little twisting
lanes that you see in all the great European cities.
Many, in fact, most of the houses are of stone, or
brick, and built in a very handsome and solid manner,
and but few of the run-up wooden structures that
you so often see in large American towns. I speak,
of course, of the principal streets; in the outskirts
of the town there are the most extraordinary-looking,
half wood, half canvas, contrivances you can possibly
imagine, abounding in the half horse, half alligator,
genus of homo, that are fresh from the diggings,
with lots of nuggets in their belt, and hair about
their faces. The streets are crowded with drags of
all kinds, carrying merchandise, omnibusses, and
old-fashioned four-horsed coaches, rejoicing in names
of hygone days in England, such as ? The Times,?
? Tally-ho,? &c.; carts with horses driven tandem-
wise, and, in short, all sorts and kinds of convey-
ances. You may imagine the bustle of the place


when I tell you that it reminds me of the busiest
part of Liverpool in the busiest time. The horses
and oxen are splendid beasts, and as fine as you ever
saw in England, and I strongly suspect that, in
sending emigrants here from the old country, you
have shipped the finest men you could find, and
kept the lean kine at home; for a finer and more
robust looking set of fellows I have never seen than
the draymen, porters, masons, carpenters, &c., that
one sees about the place. The wages here would
frighten the ? old Protectionist party ; * a common
hand gets 12s to 14 s a day ; a mason, 25 5, and
other crafts in proportion ; so you may imagine that
for a labouring man it is a small, or rather a largish
kind of paradise. Board and lodging, however, are
frightfully dear, and the rents that are paid for houses
are something quite incredible. I was to-day in a
gentleman?s office who rents two rooms on the first
floor in one of the principal streets?one room about
3 6 feet by 10, the other about a third larger; for
these two rooms he pays .�lOOO a year, and is
considered to have got a very cheap bargain; in fact,
money is spoken of as mere dirt. Men speak of
�lO,OOO as you would speak of 10s, and the rises
in fortune from the lowest depths of poverty to
actual wealth before your eyes are astounding. A
gentleman who came with me in the steamer, and
who has friends and relations in business, told me
this morning that a young fellow he had formerly


known, who had left England without a sou ten
years ago, and who had been previously employed in
some shop or other as an assistant, had recently let
some land for 563500 a year, and held some more
that he has been offered 5630,000 for.?
Within the town the demand for houses and
stores of every description is excessive, and already
large sums have been made by erecting buildings for
dwellings or business. It is next to impossible for
new comers to find any place in Melbourne unlet.
But in the outskirts of the town a vast number of
the little wooden cottages that have been springing
up like mushrooms in the suburbs of Collingwood
and Richmond have now got bills in the windows.
This is not so much because there has been anything
like overbuilding, as because the owners are reluctant
to reduce their rents, and still struggle hard to
maintain the old scale of ? a pound a week a room,?
for wooden shells some twelve feet square. This
cannot last, however, and the happy consequence
will be, that the cottages now vacant will be speedily
let, and people will cease to crowd, ten or twelve
together, in a place only capable of properly accom-
modating three or four. Some abatement of the
old crowding system is, indeed, already discernible,
and with the abolition of this great evil we shall
get rid of that primary obstacle to domestic comfort
which at present constitutes the greatest drawback
to residence in Victoria.


The following picture of Melbourne life may be
depended on as drawn by a writer on the spot :
? The conversation at the dinner table, and in the
various rooms of the hotels, reminds me much of
America, as nothing is discussed that has not some
relation or other to making money, and if you
substitute the word ?pounds? for ?dollars,? you
might imagine yourself in a public room in New
Orleans, during the very busiest time of cotton
speculations. On dit, that more gold is being found
than ever, and, if I might judge from what I have
seen of the conduct of divers diggers I have seen
about the streets, they must have been singularly
successful lately. These gentlemen patronize the
most expensive articles that they can find, and the
way I saw a digger?s ?lady? dressed up yesterday
would (as far as richness of material and gold chains)
cast into the darkest shade the most expensively got
up belle at Almack?s or the Champs Elysees. This
morning I saw several fellows with beards of huge
length, and moustache and whiskers to match,
dressed in corduroy ? smalls,? huge boots, and a sort
of blue blouse with a belt round it, standing at the
door of a public house, tossing nuggets in their
hands, some of which must have weighed several
pounds, just as carelessly as you see boys in
England tossing stones and catching them on their
way to school. I spoke to one or two of them, and
they were as civil as possible, said they were better


off than they were in England, which I believed
myself, and also said, which I did not believe, that
they intended * some day ? to put money in a savings?
bank. There are, however, many of the diggers
who save their gold, but this other especial party
will not leave their 1 nobblers ? (which is Australian
for brandy and water), till their pockets are at low
ebb, and they have only enough to carry them back
to Ballarat or Mount Alexander.?
Of Geelong almost the same may be said as of
Melbourne. It is much smaller in size, containing
about 20,000 inhabitants, whereas the latter num-
bers about 90,000. Its excellent position for water
communication, and its vicinity to the Ballarat
Diggings, render it of some importance, and it bids
fair to be, at no distant date, a most flourishing city?
inferior only to the capital.
Adelaide possesses a more solid character than
Melbourne, though far smaller and less wealthy than
Sydney. There are public buildings in it which
show great taste and skill, and the town is well laid
out, and especially adapted to the requirements of
the inhabitants of such a country. It is divided
into North and South Adelaide by a small stream
which is spanned by a bridge of some pretensions.
South Adelaide is looked upon as the business
portion of the city, and contains some fine streets
and noble edifices. Hindley Street is upwards of a
hundred feet wide, and comprising rows of elegant


shops, may justly be termed the Oxford Street of
Adelaide. The number of squares fringed with lofty
trees, parks, and boulevards which adorn the city,
give it a Parisian appearance, whilst the vicinity,
crowded with trees and dotted at intervals with
pretty English-looking villages, render it a remarkably
pleasing object as seen at a distance.
There is a good road to Port Adelaide, where
ships are compelled to discharge and take in cargoes,
and where there is a good wharf, jetty, and other
conveniences for shipping purposes, and recently a
railroad has been projected to connect the city with
its port.
The influx of gold into the colony after the
passing of the Bullion Act, effected a sensible and
beneficial change upon the trade of tho place. Land
and house property, which had been greatly depressed
by the rush of labour to the diggings, have risen to
their former high value. Mining adventure is again
progressing, and the agricultural and farming re-
sources of the colony require but a fair supply of
labour for their full and permanent development.
It needs but this one essential element for the future
prosperity of South Australia.


CHAPTER IX.
The Gold Fields of Australia?Their position, extent, and pro-
duction?Qualifications necessary for a Digger?Good and
ill fortune at the Diggings?Present and future prospects
of the Gold Fields?Government rules and regulations.
The reader will scarcely need to be told in this
place, what must be by this time well known to the
public, of the time, manner, and circumstances of
the first gold discoveries in New South Wales by
Mr. Hargreaves. The excitement and derangement of
ordinary business matters consequent on that extra-
ordinary event have now to a great extent passed
away and become matters of history. There may
nevertheless be many of those who will open this
little volume, with a desire of turning their attention
to the gold fields, either as searchers for the precious
metal or for some trading purpose. To such there-
fore a brief account of the produce, and productive-
ness of the many fields of treasure cannot but prove
acceptable.
The first discovered gold fields are those situated
in the Bathurst district of New South Wales, upon
some of the many spurs and declivities of the Blue
Mountain range of hills. These are known as the
Ophir, Turon, Louisa Creek, Meeroo River, Wim-
burndale, Frederick?s Valley and Campbell?s River


diggings. Whilst in the southern districts of this
colony there are the Major's Creek, and Bell?s Creek
diggings on the Araluen River, and some few other
fields, more commonly known as the Braidwood
diggings, less known because more difficult of access
than the former, but in many instances apparently
yielding fully as large return per head to the diggers
engaged at them. There is one distinctive feature
connected with the gold fields of New South Wales,
that whilst in but few instances have any large
masses or even weighty nuggets been met with, such
as are constantly turned up in the Victoria diggings,
the general yield is on a far more average scale, the
cases of complete failure being much fewer here.
The gold taken from the Bathurst and Araluen
fields are mostly in grains, whilst that from the
Forest Creek and Ballarat diggings are all more or
less of the nuggetty character. Most of these
localities have some distinctive features which affect
theirworking capabilities as influenced by the seasons.
Some are more easily worked during the dry season
from November to May, whilst others are so scantily
supplied with water, necessary for washing out
the ore, that they can only be attempted during or
immediately after the rains.
The Bathurst district, in which are situated the
chief gold fields of New South Wales, lies to the
north-west of Sydney, the capital of the same name,
being distant from that city about one hundred and


thirty miles. For about half this distance there is
an excellent carriage road available at any period of
the year for loaded vehicles. After that the road
becomes steep and rugged, until, as the Blue Moun-
tain range is approached, the labour of performing the
journey even with good cattle, becomes very great,
and the progress will be very slow. Bathurst, now
a rising town, is situated at a considerable elevation
above the sea level, and the route thence to the Ophir
and Turon diggings is by a gently descending road-
way.
The oldest of all those westerly gold fields is
Ophir, which was first worked by five or six hundred
diggers in May, June and July of 1851, whose
average daily earnings were all that time never less
than �l a-day each man. The number at work
here has varied from a few hundreds to several thou-
sands, according to the state of the weather. In
spite of their numbers, however, it is confidently
asserted that a very extensive and rich gold field is
untouched at Ophir, and that nothing but a popula-
tion is required to find gold in abundance. From the
operations of parties in the tributaries and adjacent
streams, it is clear that there is in that quarter
an immense area auriferous enough to give pro-
fitable employment to thousands ; in fact, there is
no doubt wherever there is a creek in that neigh-
bourhood there is sufficient gold to pay for working.
The working having been confined to the banks of


the creek alone, there has been no search made for
dry diggings.
The Turon diggings were occupied in June 1851,
and in the following October there were about 4000
diggers there. These all found profitable occupation,
the few unsuccessful workers meeting with ready
employment at 30.?. per week and rations. The
effect of this large population was soon seen in the
discovery of very large, rich, and numerous deposits
of gold, not only in the banks but in the higher
flats, at some considerable distance from the river,
and on the neighbouring hills. Above �1 per
diem was the average of the earnings for some
months after its occupation. Up to this time, how-
ever, the river bed has been scarcely worked ; the
long continuance of wet seasons made all such
attempts very difficult and expensive. Whenever
this has been done by parties with greater means
and more system, the result has shown that the
river bed is much richer than anything hitherto
known in these gold fields. Parties of three and
four have obtained twenty ounces a day from the
bed claims. In fact there is no doubt but that a
most rich and abundant gold field remains com-
paratively untouched in that quarter. In the
adjacent hills new dry diggings of great yield are
being constantly found; and though the population
in that locality has dwindled down to about 1500,
this has arisen solely from the prevailing fashion of


rushing to Mount Alexander, and in no degree from
want of a remunerative gold field on the spot.
The Meroo diggings is the most scattered of the
westerly gold fields, it comprises not only the Meroo
River, but various tributaries, and the table laud
of the high range at the foot of which the Meroo
runs. In this neighbourhood, on one of the tribu-
taries of the Meroo, namely, Louisa Creek, there
is established a quartz-crushing company, on the
vein where the ?Kerr nugget? of 1 cwt. was dis-
covered. Observations in this quarter prove that
there is no creek for a great many miles about that
part of the country that does not produce gold in
abundance.
The Meroo River runs into the Cudgegong River,
and the Cudgegong into Macquarie, a few miles
below the junction of the former with the Cudge-
gong. Within a few miles of this is the Mmckerwa
Creek, rising from the Wellington side of the Mac-
quarie, and running into that river. Many persons
have worked at times in these different places, and
in all of them gold has been found most abundantly ;
in fact, the great basin of the Macquarie has been
only sufficiently worked to show that its production
is very great, and that it may almost be called
unlimited in extent.
The Tamboroura Creek, runs parallel to the Turon,
and empties itself into the Macquarie about eight


miles above the junction of the two latter. It lays
about midway between the Meroo and the Turon.
Every portion of the table land or dry diggings,
extending for twenty miles by ten miles in breadth,
would appear to teem with ore, and there is no doubt
ample room for many thousands of diggers for
years to come.
The Abercrombie diggings are as yet comparatively
unworked, although from the yield of such creeks as
have been touched, the prospects would appear to be
inferior to very few fields.
Major?s Creek and Bell?s Creek on the Araluen
River was occupied by diggers in November 1851.
About 100 persons have been at various times at
work in the Araluen valley. The rainy season,
however, which so much impeded operations in the
western district, increased very much the difficulty
of working on that river. There is however no
doubt that the valley is a very abundant and
extensive gold field, equal in extent and production
to the Turon ; wherever parties had the means and
perseverance to sink through the opposing water to
the bed rock, very large grains were invariably
obtained. Thousands of persons will in some future
day find employment there. The chief digging,
however, has been carried on in the tributary creeks
on the table land, 1500 feet above the valley, and
where the water, though very abundant, could be


kept down without so much difficulty as in the
valley; there, the production of gold has been
hitherto very great, as great in proportion as in any
other gold field.
The Mungarlow River is about fifteen miles distant
from the Aralueu, and runs into the Shoalhaven
River. The success here has not been so decided,
chiefly owing to the want of a sufficiency of labour
to work the creeks and beds as they require. The
report of the Gold Commissioner goes to shew that
for a distance of fully fifty miles these diggings
might be profitably worked.
If the general yield of gold at the Bathurst
diggings has not been equal to that of the Victoria
fields, the cost of subsistence has also been con-
siderably less. Seldom has this exceeded �\ per
week, and more frequently not more than fifteen
shillings.
The most recent accounts from those diggings,
extending to the middle of January last, represent
the yield as coming up to former averages, though
the full working of most of them had at that time
scarcely commenced. The Government, escorts
of the two weeks previous to the departure of
the last mails from Sydney represent the quan-
tities brought down from Bathurst, 578 ounces;
Sofala, 1076 ounces; Tamboroura, 616 ounces;
Meroo, 297 ounces; Mudgee, 118 ounces; Braid-


wood, 312 ounces; Major?s Creek, 63 ounces;
Araluen, 400 ounces ; being a total of 3460 ounces,
value about 3613,000. The total shipments of gold
from Sydney during the year 1853, to December,
amounted to 1,955,422 ounces, value at 70s per
ounce, 366,843,977.
As the actual ownership of all ores and minerals
discovered on any of those lands whether public or
private is vested in the Crown, the local Government
has exercised the right of taxing the produce of the
diggers by issuing licenses at a monthly fee of
thirty shillings each person who searches for gold
by washings in the river beds; the right of search-
ing for matrix gold in the quartz rocks is given
upon other terms. The following extracts from the
latest Government regulation on this subject, issued
at Sydney, contain the leading features of these
licenses.
Persons desirous of establishing claims to new
and unoccupied ground, by working in the ordinary
method for alluvial gold, may have their claims
marked out on the following scale, to each person,
namely:
(1.) Fifteen feet frontage to either side of a river
or main creek.
(2.) Twenty feet of the bed of a tributary to a
river or main creek, extending across its
whole breadth.


(3.) Sixty feet of the bed of a ravine or water-
course.
(4.) Twenty feet square of table land or river
flats.
These claims will be secured to the parties for
such time only as they may continue to hold licenses
for the same ; unless in case of flood, or other such
unavoidable accident as shall, in the opinion of the
Commissioner or Assistant Commissioner, render a
suspension of the work inevitable.
The above licenses may be canceled and the
claims forfeited in consequence of the conviction of
the holders in any court of competent jurisdiction
of the illicit sale of spirits, or of any disorderly or
riotous conduct endangering the public morals or
peace.
Persons found working alluvial gold on any land,
public or private, without having previously paid
the license fee to the proper officer, shall pay double
the amount for such license ; and, in default, be
proceeded against in the usual manner.
The stringent state of these rules in regard to the
introduction of spirits within the diggings was
needed in order to keep down any disposition to
excesses of any kinds. The result has been that the
general conduct of the Bathurst diggers has been
most exemplary, needing scarcely any interference
from the police. This orderly state may partly be


attributed to the absence of those runaway convicts
of desperate character who have proved so dangerous
to the peace of the Victoria gold fields, tempted as
they were by their proximity to Van Diemen?s Land,
the hot-bed of Australian felony.
Where gold is found on private land, licenses can
only by claimed by the owners, or by parties autho-
rized by them.
Claims for working the quartz rock in search of
matrix or nugget gold are given upon a bond under-
taking to pay the crown a royalty of ten per cent on
the gross produce. The space so granted may extend
to half a mile along any vein with a quarter of a
mile on each side for works, and this license will be
granted for a term of three years renewable. Licenses
at the usual rate are to be taken out for every person
employed upon these workings. Traders setting up
any erections at the diggings, are likewise bound to
pay 30s monthly for the privilege, which may be
revoked on misconduct.
In the month of August, 1851, exactly three
months after the discovery of gold in New South
Wales, the precious metal was found at the foot of
the Clunes Hill on the banks of the Loddon, in the
Port Phillip district. About the same time gold was
also discovered at the Buninyong, a deep gorge in
the heart of the neighbouring ranges, formed by the
bed of a creek. This locality was distant about


ninety miles from Melbourne in a north-westerly
direction. The gold found was of a mixed character,
consisting of grains and small nuggets.
The Ballarat diggings were the next opened, and
these lay still further westward, being in fact nearer
to Geelong than to Melbourne. For a time this lat-
ter locality continued to attract most of the gold
seekers of the district, the yield being far greater
than at the Clones or Buninyong Hill; the gold was
there simply washed from the sandy soil, while at
the latter named places it was mined from the rock,
and of course more difficult of abstraction. By the
middle of October as many as ten thousand men
were at work at these new diggings, with about
thirteen hundred cradles, the estimated daily earn-
ings amongst them being �I O,OOO. The fame of
Ballarat w r as however soon eclipsed by a new field
opened to the north-east on Mount Byng, since
named Mount Alexander, where at a place called Fo-
rest Creek large nuggety pieces of gold were removed
from the soil by knives, laying but a few inches be-
low the surface. These diggings, which have since
become so famous from their prodigious yield of gold,
are situated a few miles from the brow of Mount
Alexander. The quantity taken up in this spot by the
first discoverers was so large and the extent of the
gold beds appeared so unlimited, that the other dig-
gings were at once deserted, and within a few days


eight thousand persons were assembled in the
vicinity of Forest Creek.
By the middle of the following month three tons
of gold lay in the Commissioner?s tent waiting for
transmission to Melbourne by escort, and at that
period it was calculated there were fully twenty-five
thousand persons at work in the immediate neigh-
bourhood. It is in these diggings that the largest
blocks or nuggets of solid gold have been found, free
from any impurity or admixture of quartz, varying
from 271bs. to 881bs. each. These diggings are in-
capable of being worked during the dry season, which
corresponds with our winter months, since although
the gold found is mostly of a nuggety character, a
supply of water is absolutely necessary in order to
free it from the earth. By the opening of the
mining season in May the numbers congregated at
the Forest Creek did not fall short of forty thousand
souls, most of whom were earning tiveuty to thirty
shillings a day, and many much more.
In January, 1852, a gold field of an entirely op-
posite character was discovered at the foot of the
range of mountains known as the Australian Alps,
and which run from the confines of New South Wales
through the eastern division of this colony, being in
fact a continuation of the Blue Mountain range.
This locality is distant from Melbourne about two
hundred and sixty miles, the way being for a great


part of the distance along a good carriage road coun-
try. These diggings are situated in the vicinity of
Lake Omeo which is fed by the river Mitta Mitta,
taking its rise in the Snowy mountains. The great
advantage arising from this discovery was that from
the great abundance of water about the gold field it
could only be worked during the dry season when
most of the other diggings were obliged to be aban-
doned for want of water.
Many other fields of gold have been opened and
worked with various degrees of success, but up to
the present time the Ballarat and Mount Alexander
(Forest Creek) diggings continue the chief centre of
attraction whence are derived the great bulk of the
gold exported from the Province of Victoria. Hence
it is scarcely necessary to attempt any description of
the other localities, amongst which are the Ovens,
the MTvor, the Mount Misery, the Daisy Hill, Eureka
and Backhand River diggings.
The following table exhibits the quantities of gold
received in Melbourne and Geelong from the various
diggings of the colony by Government and private
escort, as well as by the hands of single individuals.
From this it will be perceived that in spite of the great
increase in the number of diggers at work the yield
has scarcely reached that of the previous year; there
is no doubt however that a greater quantity than
formerly is now brought down by thehands of diggers
and others, to avoid the Government charge for escort.

Which, at �3 19s 6d, about the present value in the
market, amounts to �30,601,681 10s.
This does not include the gold taken over to
Adelaide, which however does not amount to many
thousand ounces.
The shipment of gold to England up to the end
of the year 1853 amounted to 2,497,723 ounces,
which at the market value of �3 17s per ounce re-
presented .�8,742,030. The production of the vari-
ous mines continued very steady, and amounted to
about forty thousand ounces a week.
Of late the mode of working the ground has been
varied in consequence of extraordinary success at-
tending a few deep workings. The favourite plan
now is rather to neglect the surface soil and mine to
the depth of a hundred or a hundred and forty feet,
completely down to the rock below the clay strata.
According to some of the gold circular reports this
new method is carried out far too indiscriminately.
? An opinion is expressed by a good many,? says


one of those reports, ? that as far as the latter dig-
gings are concerned, that were deep sinking and
those extravagant finds unknown, and the population
only working the first ten feet, success would be
more general, and the total weekly yield much larger.
They now labour it for the great depth, overlooking
altogether the top strata, which in the same localities
used to give fair wages. The first two or three weeks
work is without remuneration?all risked for a large
lot; the Gravel-pits amongst others show an example
of the kind. There the diggers used (before they
were called off by the great wonders of Mount Alex-
ander) to nett very well with their eight and ten feet
sinking; now in the same place the holes are from
one hundred to one hundred and ten feet, and the
top stuff rarely if ever tried.?
The diggers have no doubt much to learn yet be-
fore they can be said to be thoroughly versed in the
mystery of their new craft. From the last return of
gold brought into Melbourne by escort it appears
evident that the wonderful resources of the Mount
Alexander or Forest Creek diggings are in no way
impaired by the long and vigorous attacks made
upon them. One week?s returns shew as follows :

It will be necessary to say a few words as to the
security of property at the diggings, inasmuch as a
great deal of misapprehension appears to arise in this
country on that score. Many cases of bushranging
or highway robbery have doubtless appeared in the
Victoria prints, yet these are in reality few, if we
consider the vast numbers of all classes congregated
in the gold districts, the temptation offered to run-
away convicts from Van Diemen?s Land, and the
length of road and open nature of the country
through which it passes. If it be borne in mind
that there are not fewer than 100,000 persons at the
various diggings in this one colony, the dozen cases
of daring robbery which occur in a season are scarcely
to be wondered at.
On the whole the conduct of the diggers has been
most exemplary. Sunday has been invariably ob-
served as a day of rest, and the vices of gaming and
drinking, although not altogether unknown, are
scarcely observable. The health of the diggers has
been invariably good, although no doubt a large
portion of them have been persons totally unaccus-
tomed to lead a life of such hardship.
At the Forest Creek diggings a new township is
being formed under the title of Castlemaine, A
correspondent of the ? Melbourne Morning Herald?
writes of this : ? The sale of suburban lands at Cas-
tlemaine on Thursday last, realized nearly � 14,000,
the lots being bought up at high prices. The total


amount of the town and suburban sale will therefore
realize nearly 3621,000. The anxiety of landlords in
this instance to buy up land may well be understood
to be the cause of these high prices.? The town
was at that time rapidly progressing: three hotels
and some spacious stores being in course of erection,
with many neat private houses with gardens fenced in.
Three newspapers were on the point of being
started at Bendigo, and one in Melbourne, devoted
to the digging interest. One of them, the ? Bendigo
Advertiser,? is edited by Dr. Owens. When these
are fairly in the field the golden interior will not be
able to complain of not being fully represented by
the press.
In the Bathurst district the crime of bushranging
is quite unknown, and indeed it must be admitted
that the dregs of Van Diemen?s Land society have
hitherto confined their attentions to the Victoria
diggings as offering far more inducements than these.
The Echunga diggings, in the province of South
Australia, were discovered and first worked in the
month of August, 1852 ; they consisted of merely
surface workings,yielding seldom more than an ounce
a day to each party of fine grain gold. The spot
where this discovery was made was in an undulating
country, adjoining what was known as Stringy-bark
Forest, about thirty-five miles to the south-westward
of Adelaide and two miles from the Onkaparinga
River. The excitement in Adelaide, consequent upon


this discovery was very great, and during the first
week or two the number of licenses issued amounted
to nearly a hundred, but it soon became evident that
the gold was but thinly scattered, and did not on the
whole remunerate labour so well as the ordinary oc-
cupations in the colony. By degrees the number of
the diggers at Echunga decreased, and at the present
time we hear nothing further about it.
At each of the gold fields a proper police force is
maintained as well as a mounted escort for the con-
veyance of the gold to the port of shipment. This
duty is performed with great regularity every week
by the Government at a small charge : there is also
a private escort company in Victoria for the same
purpose, and evidently well supported.
It will scarcely be necessary to inform the reader
that the operation of gold seeking in Australia is a
most laborious and trying one. No one should think
of attempting it who has not been accustomed to
more or less of manual labour, for otherwise failure
and probably disease will be the result. Exposed as
the diggers are from morning until evening, day after
day, to the inclemency of the weather, up to their
knees for many hours at a time in water, and having
to undergo the utmost toil if they would succeed in
excavating the ground sufficiently to be successful
in their search, the miner who would hope to see
golden fruits must be a man of strong build, great
and untiring perseverance, and able to endure priva-


tions of many kinds. Clerks, shopmen, professional
men, indeed all who cannot undergo labour in the
field, should not think of going to the colonies as
diggers. It is owing to the disregard of these consi-
derations that many have been disappointed at the
gold fields, and there is now no doubt but that the
most successful miners have been, and always will be,
those men who have been accustomed to handle the
spade and the pickaxe.
