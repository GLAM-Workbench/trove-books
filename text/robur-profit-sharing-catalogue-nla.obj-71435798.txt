SHARING/ a / FOURTH EDITION


Profit Sharing?Co-operative Xrading
qJH^>
As tea and coffee are better bought in
small quantities for immediate use. we
give a discount or share of savings for
continuous purchasing, which enables
customers to get fresh tea each time
(though Robur Vita-Fresh Coffee, of
course, is always as fresh and full-
flavoured as the hour it was roasted, no
matter when or where you buy it) . This
suits us as well, or even better, than if
our customers bought a lot in one pur-
chase and then none for a long time
Our system of profit-sharing is carried
out by giving presents. As these are
either manufactured or bought by us at
wholesale prices, we are able to give
much greater value as discount than the
actual savings on large or continuous
purchases amount to.

The ?'Perfect? Teapot
The style of the ordinary Teapot in vogue to-day
is the same as that used 100 years ago, and, as the only
objection ever raised to the use of tea is that it is not so
good when overdrawn, one wonders why this objection
has not been overcome before now.
As tea specialists, we have come to the conclusion
that it is our business not only to provide good tea, but
also the means whereby our customers can get the fullest
value, as well as the greatest good, out of the tea
they buy. Our "Perfect" Teapot, designed by a tea
expert of 40 years' experience, can be used to make tea in
the ordinary way; but if full advantage is taken of the
improvements in this Teapot we guarantee your cup of
tea will taste nicer and be better for you in every way.
This illustration is from an actual photograph of a ? Perfect? Teapot with the
side cut away to show the patent features inside.
Special Features:
1. The Strainer Gage?made ol 4. In this cavity a spoonful of
high quality Hard Silver liquid tea is retained, in

holes, into which the tea is leaf that may have passed

water is then poured. strainer cage are held from

close the lid and allow to draw for five
minutes.
After drawing five minutes?-no longer-?remove
the strainer with the used leaves in it. The
tea is then ready for use.

THE MOST REFRESHING TEA?THE MOST DELICIOUS COFFEE.
The history of Robur Tea dates back nearly fifty years. It
pioneered pure tea in Australian homes. Before that time adulteration
was a common practice, but the Robur Company, by selecting natural,
pure teas, grown in different locations, created standard blends of
distinct flavour and high quality. This policy has always been
faithfully maintained, and the public has been supplied in each grade
of Robur with a fixed standard of pure blended tea.
Robur has also made history with coffee. For years coffee packers
have been fighting the spoiler of coffee flavour ?air, or oxygen? which
seeped into every bag, every tin, even the 'Vacuum" tin. But Robur
has now delighted the Australian public with coffee in which every
particle of full, fresh-roasted flavour is retained. This is made possible
by the Vita-Fresh process, which ensures that every tin of Robur "Vita-
Fresh" Pure Coffee or "Fresh Cup" Coffee and Chicory opens up with
the full value and delightful flavour and aroma of coffee as fresh as the
hour it was roasted

The Romance of Tea
The important constituents of the tea leaf are Essential Oils,
Theine and Tannin. Oil glands occur under the skin of the
leaf and contain the Essential Oils (both fixed and volatile) to
which the flavour and fragrance of the infusion are due. The
shape of the leaf is elliptical, with serrated and toothed edges,
and it is in these edges that enzymes and vitamins are supposed
to be located.
When tea leaves are steeped in boiling water the Essential Oils
are released almost at once, and the Theine and Tannin more
slowly. The volatile Essential Oils appeal to the sense of smell,
and the fixed oils to the sense of taste. To Theine is mostly due
the remarkable refreshing qualities of tea, but Theine is not
readily soluble in hot water unless in combination with a certain
quantity of Tannin. Luckily, the tea leaf provides the necessary
Tannin within itself, and so the Theine becomes naturally available
in a soluble form.
Unfortunately, the Tannin content of the leaf is greater than
is necessary to render the Theine soluble, and it is this excess of
Tannin that spoils the flavour and taste of the tea by its bitter-
ness, and more or less affects one?s digestion by its astringency.
All this, however, may be avoided by brewing the tea for five
minutes only and then separating the leaves from the liquid.
Five minutes is necessary to allow the leaves to unfurl and
give up their goodness. To drink the liquid before the goodness
has passed into it is to lose what you pay for, and is therefore
waste of money, whilst to overdraw means to spoil the brew, and
the longer stewing is permitted to go on the more pronounced
becomes the Tannin.
To get tea at its best, remove the
liquid extract from the leaves or the
leaves from the infusion when it has
brewed five minutes .
Growing
To visualise a modern tea garden one must imagine a planta-
tion of green bushes, from three to four feet high, growing in
rows close together, with just sufficient space for the picker to
get around the plants. The earth between the bushes is carefully
weeded and hoed by native workmen, and the bushes are kept well
pruned down to facilitate plucking and to cause an abundant
growth or ?flush? of young leaves. Periodically the bushes are
pruned right down to a few inches from the ground.
Picking
As a rule, picking takes place every ten or twelve days in the
low elevations, and less frequently in the case of hill-grown teas.
In Ceylon, Java and Sumatra picking goes on all the year round;
in India and China picking takes place at certain seasons of the
year only.
The picker systematically goes from bush to bush, nipping off
the new growth from the tip to the third or fourth leaf, throwing
the leaves into a basket which she usually carries on her back.

so as allow her to use both hands. The leaves grow on the
tea plant as shown in the accompanying diagram. By it one can
see that each leaf grows from an eye out of the stalk.
The younger or unopened leaf is usually called a ?tip,? and
it is these ?tips? one can observe as golden specks in a sample
of dry tea. No tea of commerce is comprised of these tips alone.
The flower of the plant is creamy-white, with yellow stamens;
it is not of any commercial value, either in its full bloom or bud
state. There is a form of Chinese tea known as tea buds, but
these are only ordinary leaves rolled into small pellets instead
of the usual form.
Curing
When the green leaves have been plucked they are taken to
the factory on the estate and spread on ?tats,? or light, openwork
shelves of hessian, and allowed to remain there until they wither.
As soon as the correct degree of flaccidity or leatheriness is reached
the leaves are transferred to the rolling machines, which, by
an eccentric motion of two discs, working face to face, bruise,
roll and twist the leaves as they pass through, until they emerge
a sticky mass.
The mass is broken up and the leaves spread on trays and
left to oxidise or ferment, which is, perhaps, the most important
part of the process in curing the leaf, for on its efficient accom-
plishment depends to a large extent the flavour and strength of
the infusion and its keeping qualities. During fermentation the
leaves give off a peculiar odour and change from the natural,
green to a reddish copper. When the correct odour and shade
of colour have been attained the leaves are ?fired? or baked in a
drying machine, which takes the moisture out of the leaves,
rendering them dry and brittle and in a state to keep good for a
considerable time.
Great care must be taken when drying that the heat is not
too great or the drying too rapid, or part of the valuable
extracts of the tea will be driven off, and if the leaves are scorched
or burnt the value of the tea is much reduced. By this process
the leaves are changed from reddish copper to a greyish black
colour and become the tea of commerce as we know it.
Grading
The production of various grades of tea in the garden is not,
as one might imagine, the result of special growing or separate
picking, but is a mechanical operation consisting of sieving the
crop (after curing) through different size meshes, and by this
means separating the leaves into grades, the size of the leaf
being the determining factor. Generally speaking, that portion
of the crop which is composed of the smallest leaves brings the
highest price. It does not follow, however, that all small leaves
make expensive tea, for larger leaves grown in some locations
are often of more value than small leaves from other gardens.
When the grading has been completed it is usually packed into
metal-lined chests, and despatched from the garden for shipment
to various parts of the world, where (in nearly every instance)
it is blended to suit the taste of the people of the country to which
it goes
Blending
The secret of a good cup of tea does not depend altogether on
the age or the size of the leaf, but upon the type of plant, the
quality of the soil, and the elevation of the place where it is

grown, as well as the care taken in its curing, and, still more,
its scientific selection and blending. Without blending it would
be impossible to mantain a regular standard of goodness, distinc-
tiveness and flavour, because no two pickings, even from the same
garden, are ever exactly alike.
A good tea must have certain characteristics?the leaf should
be dry, crisp ancT even, and the extract should have aroma,
flavour, strength, richness and a nice colour. It must, of course,
possess excellent refreshing properties.
There is very little tea drunk unblended, because a plucking
from any one garden seldom contains within itself all the
attributes that go to make the ideal tea. Tea from one district
may have a lot of flavour, but its extract may be thin and
watery; whilst the extract of a tea from another district may be
rich and full of sap, but have little flavour. A mixing of these
teas in proper proportions may form a blend of such desirable
flavour and rich extract as to please almost everybody, whereas
neither tea of itself would satisfy anybody.
Because a blend that suits the taste of one person might not
be liked by another, Robur offers several blends, each distinctly
different in flavour and quite unlike. From this it can be seen
that successful blending depends on the ability, knowledge
experience and judgment of the blender. For over forty years
the Robur Tea Company has been specialising in tea only-
has been perfecting blends?until to-day Robur blends are well
known as the best value that can he got in tea.
Robur tasters are really tea experts?men who have spent
their lives testing, blending, buying, and generally handling tea.
So careful is the Company in this connection that before any tea
is allowed to pass into the packing machines two tea tasters must
separately agree that the tea to be packed is exactly as it ought
to be, and the managing tea expert must approve and confirm
their judgment.
Refining
The process of refining, if it can truly be called refining, is
nothing more than removing the dust from the leaves. There'are
two kinds of dust. One is composed of small particles which
have broken off the leaves; this is removed by sieving. The other
is a brown kind of "fluff dust/' composed of "down" or small
hairs that grow on the very young "tip" leaves, and it is on
them when they are plucked and dried. Every time a parcel
of tea is moved the millions of leaves rub together and the
goldy brown down is displaced and accumulates. If this "fluff
dust were not collected it would float around everywhere and
become objectionable to the workers employed in the packing of
the tea. There is very little tea value in this dust, and therefore
it is better to remove it.
Some people have an idea that this "fluff dust" is tea tannin
m the form of powder. It is not anything of the kind. There
is nothing injurious in this dust, and no excuse for its removal
apart from its being a nuisance. As a matter of fact, there is no
such thing as tea tannin -dust. Tannin cannot be removed from
tea except by infusing it, and there is no "tannin free" tea.
The process of removing the "fluff dust" is by sucking it out
by powerful air suction fans.
The small leaf tea dust is as good tea as the leaf from which
it breaks, and there is no reason for removing it, except, as it is
small, it passes through the spout of an ordinary teapot and forms
a sediment in the cup. As illustrated on page 18 the construction

of the patent spout in the ? PERFECT? TEAPOT prevents
even the fine leaf from passing into the tea cup.
When Robur is packed there is no dust in it. Frequent
squeezing or careless handling of the packet after it goes out of
our warehouse will, however, break the leaves, and thus fresh
dust may be found in the package in spite of all that is done to
the contrary. This especially applies to Robur because of its
being composed almost entirely of tender young leaves, which Break
easily.
Packing
Case-makers? shop, where all cases in which
Robur Tea is shipped are made.
When Robur is despatched from the Robur warehouses it is
just as it ought to be. Robur is put up in sealed packets and. tins,,
with the full weight of tea in each, the packets having a vegetable
parchment lining inside the paper wrapper. This paper packing
is intended for those who purchase tea often and in small quantities.
The patent tin packing protects the tea. so that it will retain its
freshness whilst being transported up country or by ship, and for
customers who buy in large quantities. These tins cannot be
opened without the buyer knowing, and yet, although it is not
possible to close them in the same way as you buy them, when
a tin is opened and some of the tea taken out of it, the lid can
be fitted into place so as to seal up securely the remainder until
it is again required.
Packeting is done by electric machines, which make the
parchment-lined wrappers, weigh the tea, and fill and seal the
packets without anybody touching or even seeing the tea. To
watch these machines at work is most interesting. If a packet
of tea misses being filled, or is over or under weight, it is
automatically thrown out. Metal fingers, closing and sealing the
packets, are almost human in their action, and the whole per-
formance of turning out packets complete and ready for sale at
the rate of 40 packets per minute is most fascinating.
Packing packets of Robur In cases for
despatch to all parts of Australia and N.Z.
The packets, after being sealed up and passed out of the
packeting machines, are put into cases and are then ready to be
sent out to grocers and merchants for distribution to the public.
We would particularly like to emphasise the fact that from the
time Robur Tea is dried until the user opens the packet or tin it
remains untouched by human hands, and is cured, blended and
packed in modern hygienic factories. It, truly, is the purest tea
the world can produce .
Distribution to Merchants and Grocers
Deliveries are made frequently so that only
fresh tea is stocked by the retailers.
Value
The Robur buying organisation extends wherever tea is grown.
The Company?s capital is large enough to contract for and buy
tea under the most advantageous conditions. Their warehouses
are fitted with the most modern packing machines and plant,
and are self-contained. Almost everything used is made on the
premises?cases, tins and -caddies (the printing is done there, too)
?--and in this way every penny that can be is saved in the cost
of production of Robur Tea. This explains why we are able to
pack and sell Robur Tea at a price that makes it wonderfully
good value.
There are several blends of Robur. Each is distinctly dif-
ferent in type and flavour. One of these will be sure to suit
your taste. And, finally, if you brew the tea in the ?PERFECT?
TEAPOT the way we advise people to do, you will discover a
new tea enjoyment?you will have tea in perfection, a refreshing
and healthful beverage*
The nicest drink, you will agree, is a well-
made cup of Robur Tea.
