NOTES BY EXHIBITOR.
The Commissioner for Ceylon at the Melbourne Exhibition,
although he feels precluded by his position from shewing produce
of his own, in the shape of COFFEE, TEA, or CINCHONA,
may well consider himself not only at liberty, but bound in duty to
produce illustrations of and some information respecting, the leading
products of the Colony in which, for a period verging closely on
forty-three years, he has watched and through the press recorded the
progress of agricultural enterprise and industry : fostered, as they
have been, by British capital and rendered possible by a plentiful
supply of Indian labour directed by European intelligence and
energy. As in the island continent of the South, so in the ?utmost
Indian isle, Taprobane,? progress has been varied by vicissitude,
and any deficiencies in the contributions which Ceylon sends to
the International Exhibition at Melbourne must claim the in-
dulgence due to the fact that the chief enterprise of the
colony, that which has made Ceylon the third coffee country of
the world, is now passing through a crisis of great severity, due
to the ravages of a fungus blight and to abnormal seasons.
But a revival of prosperity is confidently anticipated in connec-
tion with old products as well as by the introduction of new
sources of agricultural wealth. Choosing a selection of photo-
graphs as his text, therefore, the representative of Ceylon at the
Melbourne International Exhibition offers a few words of
information respecting the products which take the lead in the
agriculture] and commerce of Ceylon.
The left-hand frame contains nine views selected from a
series taken on Abbotsford estate, Eindula (Dimbula), on which
Arabian coffee, tea and cinchona are cultivated. This is a
mountain estate, varying in ?altitude from 4,560 feet above sea
level to nearly 6,100, the mean temperature ranging between
60� and 65�, according to elevation, and the average annual rainfall
being about 110 inches.
COFFEE is cultivated here (about 7� north of the equator)
up to 5,300 feet and flourishes at this extreme altitude i,n sheltered


situations, the question being certainly more one of shelter from
wind than of mere altitude. As a general rule, however, the best
zone for coffee in Ceylon begins with 2,500 feet and ends with 5,000.
In most parts of the northern districts indeed, 4,500 feet indicate the
limit of elevation beyond which it is not profitable to go with coffee.
In the genial climate as well as fine soil of the eastern or Uva dis-
tricts of the Ceylon mountain system, however, the plant yields good
returns up to 5,500 feet. But"as elevation increases the trees take
an appreciably longer period in coming to maturity so as to give
returns of crop. At 3,500 feet and below that altitude a good
maiden crop is yielded at years from planting out into the field,
and the first full crop (often 10 cwts. per acre average in pre-
fungus times) is due in the fourth year. But on low hot estates,
while the yield is earlier and larger, the trees become sooner ex-
hausted and worn out.
It is probable that the same experience may be obtained
with TEA, which flushes very early in life and gives most
luxuriant returns of leaf in the low hot districts of Ceylon. At high
elevations the crops of coffee and tea are yielded neither at so
early a period nor often in such quantity, as at lower altitudes ;
but, given fair shelter from wind, the trees may probably last
onsiderably longer and the flavour of the produce will be certainly
more delicate. On Abbotsford there are tea bushes scattered
along the paths (chiefly seed bearers) from the lowest level,
but the regularly planted tea fields run from 5,300 to 5,900, and
promise very fairly indeed ; the superior varieties, Assam indigenous
and best hybrid, growing more luxuriantly even than the
smaller-leaved China kinds, which have also an objectionable
tendency to flower and seed prematurely. In Ceylon the age
of coffee, is invariably calculated from the date of planting
out in the field, which is seldom done under eight to twelve
months after the sowing of the seed in the nursery. Indian
tea planters on the other hand, count the age of the tea plants
from the date of putting the seed into the nursery, or into the
pits in which they are permanently to grow, a mode sometimes
adopted and called ?planting at stake.? When, therefore, it is
said in treatises on tea that the plants should not be plucked,


even moderately, until they are three years old, their second year
in the field if nursery plants, or their third from ?planting at
stake,? is understood. Where ? planting at stake ? is adopted
(and it has been tried in a few caes with coffee) two or even
three seeds are put into one hole, and the most vigorous left
to grow. In Ceylon, it really seems as if tea would flourish
from-sea level to 0,000 feet, wherever the rainfall is sufficiently
copious. Ceylon being so near the equator, tea does not get the
same ? wintering ? as in Northern India, and it is probable pruning
will be performed in the height of the winds and rains of the
south-west monsoon (June-July) instead of November, as in Nor-
thern India, where the trees ?rest? during the dry and cold season
until the following March. It is believed that experience in Ceylon
will disprove the dictum of a leading Indian authority on tea
culture, that ? a climate good for tea cannot be salubrious,? The
export of tea from Ceylon (although the plant seems to have been
introduced in the period of Dutch rule,) has only really commenced
within the past couple of years and hopes are entertained that
the Ceylon pure and delicate leaf, (chiefly the produce of best
Assam hybrid introduced mainly within the decade now closing,)
may find special favour in Australia, equally with the perhaps
stronger produce of the Indian gardens. The export for the com-
mercial year ending 30th September next, promises, when these notes
are written, to approximate in quantity to 80,0001b5., but aconsider-
ably greater quantity, perhaps 150,000 lbs., has been consumed lo-
cally, As local demands will soon be fully met and a consider-
able acreage is coming into full bearing, a rapidly increased
export may be anticipated.
As far as experience has been obtained, the best zone of
altitude for CINCHONA is,?from 2,000 feet to 4,500 for C.
succirubra, the source of the ?red bark.? For C. officinalis, the
source of crown or pale bark, the zone commences at 4,000, or,
better, 4,500, and runs up to 7,000 or even higher. C. calisaya,
?yellow bark,? is found in its native habitat, on the Andes, chiefly
at 5,000 feet above sea-level, but in Java the tendency in regard
to the precious variety Calisaya Ledgeriana is to go lower down
than 5,100 feet, at which elevation the principal plantations were


originally established. In British Sikhim (20� further from the
equator than Java and Ceylon) the calisayas are cultivated even
below 2,000 feet. Where soil is good and the situation is sheltered,
there is little doubt that this valuable tree will flourish fairly from
the lowest limit of the C. succirubra zone to the highest verge
attained by G. officinalis. But the question of the best altitude
for the yellow barks has still to be settled : always remembering
that much respect is due to conclusions arrived at in Java and
British Sikhim, in favour of comparatively lower altitudes for yellow
barks than those found suitable for the crown ba'-k trees. A good
friable soil, with a porous, easily drained sub-soil, are important
conditions for all the cinchonas. While the zone for G. succirubra is
taken to extend upwards to only 4,000 or 4,500 feet, the tree
flourishes, though growing more slowly, up to 6,000 feet, at which
elevation, in suitable soil the three species seem doing well in their
earlier stages on Abbotsford and in places similarly situated in
Ceylon. But, while the bark of C. officinalis and probably that of
C. calisaya improves in quality and quantity of alkaloids with
elevation, it was the opinion of Mr. Broughton, formerly quino-
logist to the Madras Government, that the bark of G. succirubra
deteriorated when grown above 4,500 feet. But further experience
has upset many conclusions arrived at in the earlier stages of
the culture (only commenced in India and Ceylon a score of
years ago) ; and whatever may be true of natural bark, the
processes of partial stripping, mossing, and renewing, have al-
tered the conditions, largely for the better, in the case of all
the species, but specially in that of the red bark, which becomes,
when renewed, not merely a druggist?s bark, useful for decoctions,
but of value to the manufacturers of quinine The mossing pro-
cess being expensive, much interest attaches to the ? scraping ?
off of the outside bark, as adopted by Mr. Moens of Java, After
being scraped the bark is found to renew readily without any cover-
ing, and an experiment in Ceylon seems to shew without any of
the gaps too frequent in the case of, trees subjected to the
stripping process. It remains to be proved if bark so renewed
is equal in quantity and quality of alkaloids to that which has
been protected by damp moss. The export of cinchona bark from


Ceylon has increased rapidly in the past three years, and in the
commercial year ending 30th September is expected to shew a
total of 1,200,000 lbs.
The Abbotsford views are interesting as shewing the aspect of
an estate in the earlier stages of the cultivation of coffee, tea
and cinchona. As on most of the mountain coffee estates of
Ceylon, there is here abundance of what the Americans call
? water privileges,? streams being numerous and often tumbling
in beautiful waterfalls over verdure-clad rocks. From one such
waterfall is obtained the power which moves the water-wheel and
tlie pulping machinery of the store, on this plantation.
View No. 2 gives a very vivid idea of the first operation
in OPENING AN ESTATE, that of felling the forest, at which,
and the subsequent operations of lopping and burning, the native
Kandian Sinhalese are very expert. The low-country Sinhalese are
good carpenters, but the culture and general work on estates are
prformed by Tamils, immigrants from Southern India.
No. 1 gives a very good idea of YOUNG COFFEE scattered
amongst the felled and partially burnt forest, with CINCHONA
in the foreground and a belt of the original jungle left standing
in the background. In the distance rise mountain ranges, amongst
which may be seen the pyramidal summit of Adam?s Peak, ? the
sacred mountain ? of Ceylon and, from its conspicuous appearance
from the sea, long regarded as the highest point in our mountain
system. There are in reality some half-dozen higher mountains,
although the summit of Adam?s Peak is 7,352 feet above sea-level.
The Elbeda ridge, over a gap of which Adam?s Peak appears, is
6,637 feet above sea level, and below, in front of and beyond
it, stretching from the Great Western mountain to the Peak, are
vast expanses of cultivation, interspersed with luxuriant forest,
bright streams, and lovely grass savannahs (the Agra and Lindula
?patanas,? &c.). The forest on the portion of Abbotsford shewn
in the view was felled and burnt between November 1871 and
February 1872, and the land was not planted until August of
the latter year. This view and the others were taken in November
1875, so that the oldest coffee was only a little over three years ?
the cinchona trees in the foreground only a little over two.


While No. 1 shews an Estate Path clearly, No. 3, another
section of the same comprehensive view, indicates the nature and
position of the first sets of ?Lines ? (labourers? huts) erected for
the of the coolies.
No. 4 gives a near view of COOLY LINES with plantains
and other culture in the bits of garden ground attached. The
small centre building was for the accommodation of a cow which
the head kangani (native overseer) was allowed, as is frequently
the custom, to keep. Care has to be taken, however, that the
coolies do not convert the verandahs of their lines into abodes
for goats, fowls, and even pigs. Sanitary regulations, otherwise
require to be enforced to prevent disease, as the coolies, from
choice, will crowd into limited room and do not understand the
danger of a vitiated atmosphere or polluted water.
No. 6 is a GENERAL VIEW OF THE ESTATE as it ap-
peared in November 1875, with a large portion of the forest still
standing round the patches felled. In the near foreground are
coffee, tea and cinchona nurseries, with the shading removed from
the platform of branches; then two sets of cooly lines, with
glimpses of the superintendent?s bungalow, the school-house for
labourers? children, stables and cattle sheds, the store, two more
sets of cooly lines, and finally the assistant superintendent?s
bungalow on the edge of the new clearings and just below a
waterfall. The view is interesting as shewing a young plantation
in all stages ; rows of coffee three-and-a-quarter years old to the
right of the cooly lines in the foreground and towards the
bungalow, shading away to plants only one-and-three-quarters
year old above the assistant?s bungalow; with felled and stand-
ing forest beyond, up the sides of the range which divides the
estate from Nuwara Eliya, the mountain sanitarium of Ceylon.
Out of 549 acres of original forest, all except about 70 acres
reserve are now (August 1880) cleared and planted with several
millions of coffee, tea and cinchona plants and many thousands of
Australian acacias and eucalypti. The latter grow rapidly, and,
for shelter and as timber yielder (especially for firewood, char-
coal and railway sleepers), promise to be very valuable gifts
bestowed by Australia on Ceylon. Coffee is planted about 1,200


trees to an acre ; tea and cinchonas from 2,000 t0 (as on Abbotsford)
4,800 per acre. While in the hot valley of the Brahmaputra and in
the Indian Terai, tea may require such distances apart as 4, 5, and
5� feet. In the case of Cinchona 3x3 has been advisedly
adopted at high elevations in Ceylon, where C. officinalis flour-
ishes. Cinchonas so planted can be gradually thinned, even if
plants do not ?die off? in the proportion which is common in
some situations; but planters whose judgment is worthy of respect
have recommended 3� x3A for officinalis and 4x4 for succirubra.
At the commencement of both the tea and the cinchona enterprise,
much wider distances were adopted than are now deemed necessary.
In consequence of the effects of hemileia vastatrix in diminishing
the crops of coffee, and the great success of cinchona culture, it
is the case on this estate as on so many others, that cinchonas
(chiefly C. officinalis at high elevations) are planted thickly through
the coffee, with rows amongst the tea. The cinchonas, at first
sheltered by the coffee or tea bushes, will ultimately return
with interest the shelter they received, besides yielding valuable
produce in the shape of bark rich in alkaloids. Experience seems
to prove too, that where the subsoil is stiff, coffee and
tea, from their tendency to send down long tap-roots, as well
as from the digging, manuring and weeding they receive, are
good preparatory cultures for cinchonas, which are very ex-
tensively and often very successfully grown even in ground
where coffee is old and exhausted. Exhaustion in Ceylon, except
in very favourable circumstances of soil and climate, generally
shews about the fortieth year of the coffee tree?s existence. It
will thus be obvious that the introduction of the fever-plant is
of double value to Ceylon ; as a primary cultivation and as a suc-
cessor to old coffee. Liberian coffee and cacao, which flourish from
sea-level to about 2,000 feet, are much larger plants than Arabian
coffee or tea, and are planted only 450 to 500 to the acre, Arabian
coffee being sometimes grown between the rows, to be removed
after the fourth or fifth year, by which time the lateral branches
of the larger plants shade the ground ;an important considera-
tion where a fervent tropical sun rapidly wastes by combustion the
not too plentiful fertile surface soil. In Ceylon culture Arabian


coffee is topped at to 34 feet, according to exposure to wind ;
Liberian coffee at 5 to 7 feet; tea at 18 inches to feet accord-
ing to jdt or species. The general proportions for tea are :
For China ... foot.
~ Hybrid Assam 3 feet.
~ Indigenous Assam 3� ~
Cinchonas and cacao are pruned but not topped, while the cop-
piced shoots of cinnamon are not even pruned, the lateral branches
not being taken oft until the ?sticks? are cut for barking.
No. 5 is a comprehensive view, bounded by the ?Great
Western ? mountain, 7,2G4 feet above sea level, a central and
striking object in the grand scenery of DIMBULA, itself one of the
largest perfectly cultivated coffee districts in the world. Estate
paths are seen radiating from the bungalow (of which only a back
view is here given), with portions of a cart road. The ravine
above the stables and cattle-shed has since been converted into
a very pretty lake, with a boat on it and surrounded by clumps
of the gigantic and other bamboos which flourish here at 4,800
feet above sea-level. Indigenous bamboos grow in the forests up
to 7,000 feet, but these are small or dwarf species. Very little
has as yet been done in Ceylon, in adding to the limited number
of good freshwater fish indigenous to the Island ; but there is
hope that estates may yet have their ponds supplied from the
artificial lake at Nuwara Eliya, into which perch and trout have
been introduced, the gift of the late Mr. Mclvor, who origin-
ally brought the fishes from Britain to Ootacamund. Australia,
in the matter of acclimatization of animals and fishes, has set an
example which it behoves India and Ceylon to follow. The late
Mr. Edward Wilson, it may be here noted, drew on the Ceylon
fauna for what it contained of useful and beautiful ; his attempt
to carry fireflies from their tropic home through the cold tem-
perature encountered as even Western Australia is approached,
being, however, though well meant, not successful. After the
first cold breeze nothing but dust remained in the pierced zinc cases.
? No. 7 gives an excellent representation of Cinchona officinalis:
foliage, flower (pink-coloured and fragrant) and fruit, growing by
the side of a bit of water in a depression on a mountain top 5,200


feet above sea-level. This species was shewing flowers and fruits at
two years and three months from the date of planting, or three
years and a half from the period of being placed in the nursery
as a cutting. G. mccirubra, the much larger foliage of which is
shown in No, 9, takes about twice the time in coming to ma-
turity, While C. officinalis is merely a large shrub, C. succirubra
becomes a tall and robust tree, and where it finds the best con-
ditions of growth is often slow of yielding seed. Indeed cinchonas
in Ceylon are frequently deprived of their flowers and seed-
vessels, under the impression that the formation of seed interferes
injuriously with the quantity and quality of alkaloids in the bark,
A still more questionable practice is that of so severely pruning
away the branches that cinchona trees, naturally handsome, vie in
stiffness with pollarded poplars. Where C. succirubra is grown
amongst coffee the umbrageous branches must certainly be thinned
away, and a clear stem is necessary for the stripping or scrap,
ing process, but the removal of nearly all the foliage from a
tree would seem to be injurious not only to its growth but
to the plentiful secretion of alkaloids in the bark. If only
planters can wait so long, the earliest periods for harvesting the
cinchona barks are four years from planting out in the case of
C. officinalis and five to seven in that of C. succirubra, whether the
coppicing or the stripping and mossing (or scraping), and renewing
system is adopted, or the rooting-out process. By the former a
succession of shoots is obtained ; by the second bark can be taken
successively for a series of years, the limit of which is yet unascer-
tained, from trees left standing and increasing yearly in size and
yield ; while by the last-mentioned method, the trees are ab-
solutely destroyed ; but, as established in British Sikbim, the
bark harvest is increased by one-third in the shape of root bark
which generally sells higher than even the best stem bark. The
alkaloids are supposed to be more in quantity and richer in
quality in root bark, because elaborated under protection from
sunlight. The objection to the uprooting process is, that cultiva-
tion has to be commenced de novo, while the soil, unless excep-
tionally rich, must be allowed to lie fallow for some years.


We have in No. 8, the ? MUSTERING OF THE COOLIES ?
at the STORE. Subsequently to the taking of this view, the
store was enlarged and fitted with a water-wheel to drive a set
of Walker's first-class pulping machinery. The ripe berries being,
by means of the pulpers, deprived of their outside mucilaginous
covering, and so converted from ? cherry coffee ? into ?parchment,?
the ? beans? are spread out on coir mats on the cleared space (in
planter parlance ? barbacue?) on which the coolies are mustered.
When the coffee, by being spread on this platform and on the
store loft, is which floored with coir matting, is sufficiently
tied for transmission to Colombo, it is packed in jute sacks and
sent off by cart and railway, where the latter is available. A new
use has, recently, been found for coffee store lofts in the drying of
cinchona bark, which can also be effected by artificial heat in the
tea house, w'hen one exists on the estate. Mr, Moens of Java has
found that bark is not injuriously affected by being dried in the
fiercest sun heat, while on the Nilgiri Government plantations,
where the bark is harvested in wet weather, as most favourable for
the stripping and mossing process, the bark is dried by furnace
heat, distributed by flues which run under bamboo shelves.
Coffee and tea differ essentially in the extent to which water is used
(on estates) for the preparation of the one, while fire, in the
shape of glowing coals of charcoal, is the great agent in the pre-
paration of the other, ?tea. Before being dried in fine wire sieves
over charcoal fires (roasting in copper pans being now generally dis-
pensed with) the green succulent leaves are ?withered? by being
spread out thinly on matted shelves. When sufficiently soft and
satiny to the feel, the flaccid young leaves are rolled, fermented
and fired, the proportion of dried leaf to wet being generally
as nearly as possible one-fourth. One of the reasons why Indian tea
is so much stronger than China is said to be found in the fact
that while the Chinese waste the juice which exudes from the leaves
in the process of being rolled this juice is carefully reabsorbed into
the balls made ready for fermentation after the rolling process in
tea preparation as pursued in India and also in Ceylon.
CINCHONA bark, which dries down to from one-third to
two-thirds, according to age, quality and season when collected.
taken off much cipnanjop bark is; but the outside bark


of cinchonas is carefully preserved (the alkaloids residing in the
cellular tissue), and the ?quills? are neither so lengthy as in
the case of cinnamon nor are they placed one inside the other to
be baled. When sufficiently dried, whether on the estate or at a
Colombo store, the bark is packed in wooden cases or, much more
generally, in double ?gunny? bales. It seems essential that red
bark (natural red bark at any rate) should be sent away in nice
even unbroken quills ; the druggists, who use chiefly this kind of
bark, judging largely by good appearance and liking to have show
pieces of bark for their windows. But as the barks of C. officinalis
and C. calvsaya are sold by analysis they can be less carefully
cut and packed. Crown bark can be pounded down into the bales
without detracting from its value, and some sent recently from
Ceylon was actually subjected to hydraulic pressure. The only
objection offered to this process is that it was somewhat difficult to
obtain specimens from the bales. Thorough drying in the shade, in
the sun, or by artificial heat, is essential for cinchona bark in all cases.
Tea can be partially dkied in the sun, but artificial
heat is essential to finish off with, even where ?green? tea is
made. In the case of coffee artificial heat is deemed inadmissible
but the intensity of the fierce tropical sun rays to which the
beaus are subjected is heightened by the black colour of the
Colombo store barbacues, this colour being caused by the tar with
which they are coated. About one-half the weight of coffee cherries
as gathered from the trees is left on estates in the shape of pulp,
and then a ton of the resulting ?parchment? coffee as received
in Colombo yields 12 cwt. of clean dried berries as finally packed for
shipment in the Colombo stores and sold to be roasted and ground.
The time of Coolies? Muster at the estate store as shewn in
the view (photograph No. 8) is half-past 0 a. m., and the morning
sun?s rays ai?e just lighting up the top of the ridge behind the
building. In front of the Coolies stand the Europeans connected
with the estate : the proprietor in the right foreground, the super-
intendent (with the head kangani by his side) a little to the left,
and the assistant superintendent on the extreme left. The kan-
gauies stand in front of their respective gangs. Of the latter


only a select number are present, many of these people having
a vague dread of the photographic instrument. Indeed one of
the men fell down in a fit on the occasion of taking this view,
an experience -which the photographer said was familiar to him
from its frequent occurrence in like circumstances. The Tamils
of South India who pass to and fro between the rice and millet
fields of their own flat hot land and the mountain plantations
of Ceylon, as Irish reapers do to England and back, are inferior
to the negroes in physical vigour, but they are docile, and fairly
steady workers. The immigration and emigration of these people
to and from Ceylon, since the exigencies of the advancing coffee
enterprise led to an ever-increasing demand for their labour from
1,840 onwards, has been in excess of two millions (the numbers
reported between 1843 and 1879 being million arrivals and
1,800,000 departures), and the benefits which they have conferred
on Ceylon by their labour, and on themselves and their often semi-
famished families and countrymen, by the earnings of that labour
are incalculable. Not only have they worked estates, but roads
(for the abundance and general excellence of which Ceylon is
celebrated), railways, and other public works, have been largely
constructed by them. While the Sinhalese are an Aryan people
and speak a language chiefly derived from Sanskrit, the Tamils
are Turanian in race and their language is classed as Dravidian.
A good many Tamils (popularly but incorrectly termed ?Malabars?)
have settled in Ceylon, but most of those who save money
purchase land in their own country. With all their good qualities,
that of extreme honesty cannot be claimed for the Tamils, even
by their best friends, any more than the virtue of cleanliness
in person, habits and abodes. Gardens are not cultivated around
?lines? (the cooly huts) as they ought to be, because the cul-
tivator or a member of his family would have to stay at home
to guard the fruits and vegetables from being appropriated by
other inmates of the lines; and when a Tamil man and his
wife go to visit friends on a neighbouring estate, it is often the
case that the husband carries the cock and the wife the hen
which constitute their poultry stock, thither and back again. A
planter tells an amusing story of seeing one morning all his


potato stalks drooping. His coolies had, during the night,
taken the tubers and re-inserted the stalks in the soil. In such
cases the patriarchal justice usually inflicted is to fine every cooly
on the estate, unless the guilty parties (who are of course well-
known) are given up. Until the advent of the ?hard times
which have recently visited planters and coolies'alike, housebreak-
ing and robberies of a grave nature by estate coolies were infre-
quent. For the sake not only of the European planters but of
the natives of Southern India as well as the forest-fellers, cask-
makers, carpenters, cart-drivers, contractors, &c., of Ceylon, it is
fervently to be hoped that a good ?next year? and a succession of
such years will now visit the lately sorely tried coffee enterprise
of Ceylon. At the commencement of the decade which ends
wi,h 1879-80 the exports of Arabian coffee from Ceylon had
advanced to beyond a million of cwts. in quantity and four
millions sterling in value. Instead of a largely increased quantity
and value in 1879-80, which were reasonably anticipated, we
shall ship not much more than 630,000 cwts. of a value of 2|
millions sterling, in lieu of over million of cwts. worth 6
millions sterling. This disastrous diminution of crop is, as already
stated, mainly the effect of a minute but destructive leaf fungus,
aggravated, latterly, by abnormal seasons. Signs that the crisis
is over and the evil days passing away are not wanting, and while
a revival of the special enterprise in Arabian coffee is anticipated
in Ceylon its partial failure may (like the potato visitation in
Ireland) turn out to be a blessing in disguise, enforcing energetic
and persevering attention, as it has done, to such new and valu-
able products as Liberian Coffee, Cacao, Cinchona, and Tea,
which have just commenced to figure in the exports of Ceylon,
and for which, with the Colony and its inhabitants, we cannot but
believe there is a bright future of prosperity and progress. Still
of ? the Eden of the Eastern wave? it will, we trust, continue
be said that it is a land
? Where Europe amid Asia smiles.?
The number of plantations, mainly owned and managed by
Europeans, in Ceylon is about 1,600 ; the extent being about
550,000 acres, of which 280,000 acres are in cultivation. Th�


number of managers and superintendents is about 1,250, besides
the Europeans in Colombo connected with the curing and shipping
establishments.
The views 1 and 3 in the second frame represent COFFEE
CULTURE in an advanced stage. No. 1 shews well the evenness
of the rows in which the bushes stand and the regular size to
which they have been topped so as to induce lateral growth, for
the double purpose of producing the maximum of fruit and secur-
ing a covering for the soil from sun-heat and rain-wash. All
the asperities of stocks and trunks of the original forest have
disappeared in this case, much to the improvement in appearance
of the estate. Here we have examples of the mountain streams
(often varied by beautiful waterfalls) and the pretty bridges so
common on coffee estates in the hill country and mountains of
Ceylon. In Brazil and Java the coffee trees are almost univers-
ally allowed to grow to their natural size of about eight feet
high, and are, therefore, planted so widely apart as to give
only about 300 to the sere, that is one-fourth the Ceylon average.
In both Brazil and Java land is plentiful and labour scarce. Coffee
is grown unpruned and untopped around native huts in Ceylon,
but on plantations the few trials made of this mode of culture
shewed strongly two grand objections : the trees allowed to grow
up untopped throw off their lower primaries which in topped
trees bear the heaviest loads of fruit, and crop being concentrated
on the top branches these are often broken by the coolies in
the process of pulling them down so as to permit the gathering
of the *? cherries.? In Ceylon the most scientific cultivation
has been the rule, and the results in quality and quantity of
coffee were in proportion until the advent of the leaf fungus.
The debilitating influence of this pest has largely decreased quantity
of crop, but has not materially affected the quality of the Ceylon
bean, which, in the case of best high-grown plantation, ranks
with the finest produce of the world.
No. 3. one of the fi iesf FSTATES in Ceylon, affords a good
idea of the complete system of paths by which most of the
plantations are intersected. On the number and good condition


of those paths, to which a cart road is often added, largely
depends the careful and economical management of a property
The perfection of the road system of a plantation is that the paths
should be so numerous, smooth and well-bridged as to enable the
superintendent, day by day, to find easy and rapid access to every
portion of it, mounted on his fast trotting or cantering horse.
Even when coolies are employed on task-work, frequent and
surprise visits from the European superintendent are of great
value. The Tamil coolies work well when well looked after.
Of the dignity of labour, emulative pride in good work, or
conscience as to earning their wages, but few of these people
have much idea. Exceptions there are, however, and these may
be expected to increase as the operations of the Cooly Mission are
crowned with increasing success. The average number of immi-
grant Tamils present during the year in all Ceylon (including
those working on their ow r n account and comparatively settled,) is
not less than 300,000,?men, women and children included. The
medical wants of the coolies on the plantations, are provided for by
a special and rather onerous acre tax, and their interests and rights
are guarded by stringent laws,which, however, seldom need to be
enforced, the understanding between employer and employed being
generally?almost universally?good. The interest and the duty of
the Ceylon planter in the good treatment of his labourers are coin-
cident, for engagements terminable by a month?s notice are the
rule, while steamers and fast sailing schooners (these last provided
by the Ceylon Government) enable the coolies as quickly and
cheaply to ? returnto their country ? (Tamil, shtmeikku p6ha) as
to come from theircountry to Ceylon.
The middle picture of the top row, No. 2, shews the final
process of ? COFFEE PICKING ? as done by hand,? machinery
being capable of sizing the beans, but not of discriminating broken
from whole ones or separating foreign substances from the coffee.
Many thousands of women and children find profitable employment
of this nature at the Colombo stores. The picture is interesting
as shewing the women of the three leading races of Ceylon
Sinhalese, Tamils, and ?Moors??in their ordinary costumes.
The ?Moormen? of Ceylon (Moros of the Portuguese) are


generally descendants of natives, principally Tamils, proselytized
centuries ago by Arab refugees or immigrants to India and
Ceylon. The men are frequently pedlars and jewellers, and have
been appropriately called ?the Jews of Ceylon.? It is only the
women of the poorer classes of these Muhammadans, however, who
expose themselves to public gaze.
In photograph No. 6 are combined representations of the
exterior and interior features of the COFFEE STORES, the tall
chimneys of which are so prominent round the shores of the
Colombo Lake. Into these stores the coffee is received from
the up-country estates, iu a partially dried state, the beans still
enclosed in ?the parchment skin,? the mucilaginous and sacchar
iue outer envelope only (generally containing two beans, placed
face to face) being ?pulped? away on estates. In the Colombo
stores the parchment coffee is finally ?cured,? being first spread
on platforms of brick covered over with tar, until every particle
of moisture is expelled. The now brittle parchment skin is then,
broken from the bean by wheels revolving in a circular trought
and so suspended as not to crush the beans. The parchment
skin, thus reduced to the condition of ?chaff? and ultimately
used as fuel ror the furnaces of the steam machinery employed,
is driven away by fanners, and the clean beans are sized in per-
forated revolving cylinders, hung at an incline which carries the
larger sized beans downwards. The final picking and sizing, in-
cluding the separation of the round ?peaberry? (two beans
coalesced) from the fiat-faced beans, also broken from whole coffee,
with the careful removal of bits of gravel or sand, are done by
the deft hands of women and children. When all this is com-
pleted the coffee beans are, according to size and quality, packed
in casks which are charred inside and well secured, each contain-
ing about 8 to 9 cwts., the rate of coffee iu cask for freight purposes
being 16 cwt. to a ton. Only inferior or ? native? coffee is packed
iu bags, 18 cwt. to a ton. There seems little doubt that the
coffee plant was introduced into Ceylon from Yemen (whither it
had previously been brought from Abyssinia) by the Muham-
madan voyagers, many centuries ago, but it is said that until the
advent of Europeans, the natives knew nothing of the stimulat-
ive virtues of the berries, only using the flowers as offerings


in the Buddhist temples and the leaves as seasoning to their
curries ! Until the records of Portuguese rule in Ceylon, sup-
posed to exist in Brazil, are examined, it is impossible to say
if the virtues of coffee were appreciated by the first Europeans
who effected a settlement in Ceylon. The Dutch, who, beyond
all doubt, were the first to cultivate cinnamon in Ceylon,
paid also a good deal of attention to coffee; but the first
regular plantations date only from 1825, ten years after the
Mountain Kingdom of ? Kandy ? came under British rule, and
the ?rush? of Europeans into the enterprise was later by
another decade. In 1837, only a little over 30,000 cwts. of coffee
were exported from Ceylon : in almost thirty years the export rose
to one million cwts., and this quantity might have been increased
by one-half in the succeeding decade, but for the fungus blight
already referred to, and the disappearance of which is now hoped
for, by effluxion of time rather than by the discovery and ap-
plication of any effectual remedy. What ? rust often is to wheat
in Australia, the leaf fungus is to coffee in Ceylon, with the
difference against the tropical colony that the plants affected
are perennial, incapable of entire removal and renewal except at,
a ruinous loss of time and expenditure of money. Efforts are
however, made to introduce ? fresh blood, ? Seeds obtained from
Aden of the celebrated ? Mocha ? coffee have yielded good results,
and much is hoped for from the seed of a variety grown in
Coorg, Southern India, The Liberian plant, from the greater size
and thickness of its foliage, is, happily, able to resist the fungus.
Ko. 5 gives a good idea of the mode in which the COCONUT
PAT.MS grow near the seashore. The tendency of this palm to
bend, especially towards the light and air which it finds on the
seaside, adds much to its gracefulness in scenery ; a perfectly
straight coconut being according to a Sinhalese proverb as rare
as a white crow. The value of the coconut palm to the world
and especially to the natives of Ceylon can scarcely be exagger-
ated. Its products are fully represented at this Exhibition
by several Ceylon exhibitors. It is probably not an ex-
aggeration to estimate the number of coconut palms in Ceylon
at twenty-five millions. They exist principally in a zone extending


two or three miles inland from the sea-shore chiefly on the south-
western coast, although there is a good portion of this cultivation
near Batticaloa on the east side of the island. The much drier
climate of the northern end of the island is not so favourable
for this moisture-loving palm. Specimens are found occasionally
in the hill country up to 2,000 feet altitude, but they rarely
bear heavily at any great distance from the sea air. The hlosed
and expanded flower-spathes and fruit of this palm in different
stages are well shewn in the centre of No. 4. The flower-stalk
with incipient fruits scattered over it closely resembles a series
of gigantic heads of ripe wheat. We have already indicated the
acreage of land devoted to the cultivation of coffee (both
species), tea, cacao, cinchonas, &c. The coconut palms are
spread over about 300,000 acres, and the acreage of the cultivated
cinnamon gardens ? is about 20,000. While the vast majority
of the coffee, tea, cinchona and cacao plantations are in the hands
of Europeans, the very opposite holds good of coconut and cin-
namon property. Of cinnamon may specially be said, what is true
of all our leading products, except those yielded by the coconut
tree, that the vast bulk are exported. The products of the coconut
tree, on the other hand, are largely used locally : the nuts for
food, oil and coir; the juice of the flower spathe for yeast and
fermented and distilled liquors (?toddy,? properly lari , and ar-
rack); the leaves for mats, thatch, &c. But there is a large
export of oil and coir with a considerable though fluctuating
quantity of arrack. Some of the most perfect apparatus in the
world are used at the Hultsdorf Mills, Colombo, for grinding the
dried coconut kernels and expressing the oil. The exceedingly
powerful presses can scarcely be called hydraulic, as oil is the
liquid now employed to raise the ram. It is believed that the
annual export of coconut oil from Colombo considerably exceeds
the figures for any other port in the world. The annual exports
of oil from Ceylon (practically all from Colombo), which averaged
407,000 gallons valued at �25,625 for the five years 1837-41
rose to 2,717,750 gallons valued at �271,773 in 1879. The like
comparison for cinnamon gives an average of 452,000 lbs. valued
& ' � � U7 in 1837 ' 41 aild 1 >?114,000 lbs. in 1879, valued at
i'OOj 000�


The average yield of a coconut palm in fruits has been greatly
exaggerated, in consequence of persons drawing general conclu-
sions from particular specimens. In favourable situations of
soil and shelter, no doubt 100 nuts or more have been yielded
by a single tree in a year. But such exception are rare
The climate and soil of Ceylon are supposed to be specially
favourable to this palm, but careful observation has proved
that 40 nuts, the equivalent of a gallon of oil, are rather
a high annual average per tree. The harvests of coconuts,
in truth, vary exceedingly ; being short in a year of drought
and plentiful in proportion to rainfall, which at Colombo has
in ten years given an average of 88?36 inches, but particular
years have shewn such differing results as 159-70 inches in 1878,
and 57'03 inches in 1874. Taking 40 nuts as the produce of a
tree and as the equivalent of a gallon of oil, it follows that
when we export 2,500,000 gallons of coconut oil from Ceylon,
we have drawn for this quantity on no fewer than millions
of trees and used the copra (dried kernel) of 100 millions
of nuts. Coconut oil is largely used for soap manufacture on
the continent of Europe, the product of the palm nut of West-
ern Africa being, I believe, preferred for candle-making. Much
of the copra of Ceylon being dried over fire, owing to the
wetness of the climate, the resulting oil generally is some-
what inferior to that exported from Cochin on the western
coast of India. It has been stated to me as a fact, how-
ever, that choice copra exported from Ceylon to Calcutta and
Bombay is not all expressed into oil, but a good pro-
portion of it used as food by native baboos and others, desirous
of securing that degree of obesity which natives of India gener-
ally associate with rank and dignity. The kernel of the
coconut forms a large portion of the food of the people of
Ceylon, but whether scooped out of the nut and so eaten, or
scraped fine as an ingredient in curries, freshness is desider-
ated. The large quantity of water enclosed in each coconut is
more or less saccharine in proportion to the age of the nut.
The water of a young coconut makes a refreshing and wholesome
drink, and the same might be said of the juice (?palm wine?)


extracted from the dower spathe, if used before the setting
up of the fermenting process. The juice when fermented is as
intoxicating as beer, and it is the basis of the spirit called ar-
rack, so largely used in Ceylon.
On the right-hand side of No. 4 are representations of
branches of two varieties of a tree which even educated and
intelligent persons frequently confound with the cocoa (properly
coco) palm. The confusion arises largely from the identity
of pronunciation adopted, which is indefensible. The proper
spelling of the cacao not cocoa plant indicates the correct
pronunciation, which is ha-cow. The fruit of this plant (a
plant as unlike a palm as anything could be) which Lin-
naeus named Theobroma is the origin of the beverages ? ? cocoa ?
and chocolate, and of numerous confections, which, on the
continent of Europe, especially in Spain, are largely davoured
with cinnamon in lieu of vanilla. The temporary check given
to the coffee enterprise of Ceylon by the ravages of the fungus,
hemileia vastatrix, drew attention to cacao, scattered trees and
patches of which had long existed in Ceylon, the most appreci-
able of which were on an estate owned by a well-known
planter who received his training in Jamaica, Mr. R. B. Tytler,
He has extended the cultivation largely, and his example has
been widely followed. The small quantities of the beans as yet
sent from Ceylon to the London market for trial have realized
most encouraging prices. But neither cacao nor Liberian code 6
will figure to any extent in the exports of Ceylon until the local
demands for seeds have abated. At the period (August 1880)
at which these notes are penned, Liberian coffee beans (not
cherries which contain two) are selling at R2O per 1,000, while
pods of cacao containing on an average 25 seeds are selling for
25 cents of a rupee, locally produced tea seed being sold at
RSO per maund and plants at RIO per 1,000. The writer has paid
half a rupee each for plants grown from imported seed of Liberian
coffee, and similar prices have been asked for cacao plants. But with
advancing cultivation and competition prices wall soon be moderate.
Cacao, like the gigantic Liberian coffee, a branch of which is
figured on the left-hand side of photograph No. 4, has the merit of
flourishing at low altitudes, in the zone from sca-level np to


2,000 feet, a zone found generally unsuitable for the continued
cultivation of the Arabian species of coffee, Liberian codec
(leaves of which measure about two feet in length), only iccently
introduced into Ceylon, promises equally with or perhaps more
than cacao to be a great success.
All the products hitherto noticed in detail, including even the
coconut palm, Ceylon owes to other countries. The coconut palm,
the cacao tree, and the cinchonas, we have derived fiom South
or Central America, the common coffee from Arabia, and the gigantic
species from West Africa. But, notwithstanding much controversy
on the subject, it seems beyond doubt that cinnamon which
has been famous in eastern commerce since the dawn of histoiy,
is really indigenous to the island. It is found scattered among
the most remote forests, where it attains the dimensions of a
good-sized tree. And a beautiful object it is with its young foliage,
varying from pure delicate to white pink and deep blood red.
But the bark of such trees, or even of those regularly cut and barked
in the jungles, is not to be compared with the delicate and highly
odoriferous bark of the constantly coppiced, cultivated plants,
which are all grown at but a slight elevation above sea level. A
stem, a score of which in all stages spring from one stool, is
matured generally in the third year of its growth (the evidence
being the browning of the outer skin of the bark); and in
the middle picture, No. 8, of the three at the bottom of the
frame illustrative of cinnamon culture and preparation, a native
is represented as cutting from the laurel-like grove ?a cinnamon
stick ? and denuding it of its branches, which are left on the
field. In the stores, the sticks are barked (the outer envelope
being removed as worthless, the essential oil residing in the
cells of the inner bark), dried, quilled, assorted and packed in
bales of 100 lb. for shipment. The barking process, in which
ihe peelers (generally ? Chaliyas,? a caste whose origin is traced
to the continent of India) make free use of their lithe toes as
well as of their fingers, is represented in photographs 7 and 9,
in which also native Sinhalese, men and women, are well figured.
In other products, other countries may compete with Ceylon,
but it may be safely assorted that for delicacy of flavour its


cinnamon bark is utterly unapproached. The ? cassia ? of China
is obtained from a very inferior variety of the plant; but even
cinnamon grown from Ceylon seed in Java and on the western
coast of India, has not approached the parent trees in quality
of bark. It seems probable that much of the excellence of
the Ceylon bark is due, not merely to careful culture and
preparation, but to the singulai soil, chiefly composed of highly
siliceous line white sand (deposited probably in ancient fresh water
lakes) in which most of the cultivated cinnamon is grown.
This ?cinnamon sand,? a specimen of which is amongst the
Ceylon exhibits, gives its name, ? Maradana,? tc that portion of
Colombo in which the most famous of the cinnamon gardens were
situated ; now being gradually circumscribed as the city extends
and ground is sold for building lots. There is, however, abund-
ance of good cinnamon soil within easy distance of Colombo,
specially at Kaderana near Negombo. The scenic effect of culti-
vated cinnamon is often much like laurels in Europe when
shewing their green foliage over expanses of snow. The ?spicy
breezes ? are a pretty poetical conceit (although embalmed by
Heber in one of the most stirring of Christian lyrics), for it
is only when wounded or crushed that the bark or leaves emit
their odours, in the case of the latter resembling that of cloves.
The root yields a camphor-like substance which is made into
candles to be used at Sinhalese weddings, and even the acorn-
like fruit yields an aromatic extract. Ceylon could supply the
world with any quantity of cinnamon, from exquisite and costly
? first sort? tocheap and serviceable ?chips,? for which there could
be a possible demand, and under the operation of free trade the
consumption of the spice shews a quantity quadrupled when com-
pared with the exports of the old government monopoly lays. [Under
the Dutch in Ceylon the penalty for cutting down a cinnamon tree
was death!] But the difference between a mere luxury like cin-
namon and articles essential for human life and health cannot
be better illustrated than by the f-ct that cinnamon, for which
Ceylon has been famous for many centuries, figures now for
far less value in the commerce of the island than the bark of the
cinchonas, which were introduced less than twenty years ago,
and the systematic and extended cultivation of which dates little
more than ten years back. At the rate at which cinchona


cultivation is now advancing in Ceylon, the probability is that
the island will speedily contain more of the fever plants than
all the rest of the world put together. There are many checks
to over-production, however, in the shapes of unsuitable soil and
uncongenial exposure, with insect and fungoid plagues.?The Dutch
had the start of the British in the actual introduction of the
cinchonas into the eastern world, and although at first unfor-
tunate in the species cultivated, they have ultimately succeeded,
largely owing to the free volcanic soil of Java, in naturalizing the
very finest and richest in quinine of the calisaycis. As in British
India, so in Ceylon we are attempting to follow their example
and there can be little doubt that Ledgeriana, the King of the
Callsayas , will be as successful as Succirubra and Officinalis have
proved. Meantime we have the testimony of Mr. Howard, the
great quinologist, that the Ceylon crown bark ? leaves nothing to
be desired.?
Up to the period when a third of the present century
had elapsed, Ceylon was known mainly to the world as the island of
CINNAMON, COCONUTS, PEARLS and GEMS.
It has in the interval become still more famous, and what is
better, still more useful as a source of supplies of
COFFEE,
while
TEA, CACAO and CINCHONA
are rapidly taking leading positions in THE EXPORT'S OF
THE ISLAND.
