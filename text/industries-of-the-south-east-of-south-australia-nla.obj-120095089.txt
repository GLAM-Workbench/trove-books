The Only Complete Home Cleaner
ECONOMY and EFFICIENCY PROVED by the
GREATER SUCTION of the “TURBINET”
THE first essential in all cleaners is their power of suction. The cleaner with the
greatest cubic capacity of air passing through has a distinct advantage over other
makes. “Turbinet” achieves the maximum. Many other cleaners of double the horse
power cannot sustain such a claim as this. The greatest volume of air is the reason why
the cleaning nozzles are extra large. This means much to the housewife for she can, by
possessing the British ‘ Turbinet,” accomplish her tasks in half the time and at a great
saving in running costs.
The Silvcrfish nozzle is an outstanding feature of
The “Turbinet." It is most efficient in getting
the moths and silvcrfish that lurk behind skirtings
and upholstered furniture. I his nozzle is an
ideal method for cleaning bedding and wire
mattresses.
its perfected shock and fool-proof hose assures 100
per cent, safety, and does not scratch the furniture.
“Turbinet" is the only cleaner that cleans and
polishes floors and linos in one action.
This is the Same Retail Price as London.

DEVELOPING the SOUTH-EAST
A rich well-watered District that may become the State’s future Mainstay.
IT is only in comparatively recent years that the South-Eastern
districts of South Australia have begun to be seriously considered
as important contributors to the State’s general productive wealth.
The earliest discovery dates back to the beginning of the nineteenth
century, when Mount Gambier was first sighted, but, although
settlers took up land in certain areas, and a number of very large
estates were founded, such as, for example, those of "Yallum," at
Penola, “Struan,” near Naracoorte, “Koorine” at Kalangadoo,
“Mount Schanck,’’ and similar properties, it was not until closer
settlement schemes were undertaken and the larger holdings sub-
divided, that things began to move.
The greatest drawback to early advancement in many cases
was due to the large areas that were completely inundated with water
in the winter, which prevented utilising that land for farming or
grazing purposes. Then the idea was formed that by cutting a
series of deep and well constructed channels leading to the sea, much
of the surplus water would be drained from the land. Portions of
Millicent were the first experimental areas, and these proved so
eminently successful that the scheme was extended to Penola, Beach-
port, Robe, and Kingston. It was during the period 1870 to 1880
that the first experiments were made, and it is a great tribute to the
engineers working on the original cuttings that although they have
been in use for fifty or sixty years, the drains are still functioning
satisfactorily.
T he soil in the drained areas gave great promise in the early
stages, but it was found that something was needed to counteract
the souring effect of waterlogging, and for a time progress was
necessarily slow. Then superphosphates were introduced, and from
that time the South-East has never looked back. The artificial
manuring can be truly stated to have made the South-East, and
further drainage, therefore, being found to be warranted, more land
was reclaimed. To-day, there are thousands of miles of channels
criss-crossing the wet areas, and in Millicent alone there are more
than 1,000 miles of drains. In some of the reclaimed areas won-
derful crops are regularly produced, yielding as high as 70 bushels
of barley per acre, and between 50 and 60 bushels of wheat. Oats,
also, gives correspondingly high yields, and the pastures are so rich
that wool from the South-East is recognised as some of the finest
produced in the State.
Many men who have lived the greater part of their lives in
the South-East, and have studied the possibilities of development,
are working strenuously to bring about radical changes in the present
conditions. It is generally recognised that certain changes must
be made to promote greater interest and further development, but
each contributing factor depends so much upon the other that it is
difficult to make a definite move in one direction alone. The most
important needs seem to be:—
fa) Better railway transport facilities throughout.
(b) A well-situated deep sea port.
(c) Further systematised drainage .
Of secondary consideration are:
(1 ) A conveniently established superphosphate works to
reduce the high cost of transport.
(2) A local freezing works to facilitate export of lamb and
mutton and beef.
Although these needs are agreed to be important, it is also
recognised that the great expense of putting them into effect is by

Gambier.
no means warranted by the present small population. On the other
hand, it is stated that, under present conditions, it is not profitable
to buy more land, as production and export costs are too high. So.
once again, there appears to be a deadlock.
However, the wonderful possibilities and natural properties
of the great South-Eastern areas have recently been attracting many
wealthy northern pastoralists, and these men who have purchased
large areas of untreated, rough country, are spending considerable
sums in development. These newcomers are by no means on a
wild goose chase. Since the advent of supers, it has been found that
the South-East will grow subterranean clover, and in such profusion
that the value of the land has been increased beyond all knowledge.
There are some areas of thick scrub land between Naracoorte and
Lucindale, and some near Hynam, that, in its natural state, would
carry little more than a sheep to ten acres. After grubbing the trees,
ploughing out the yaccas, gum suckers, and bracken ferns, and
otherwise preparing the land for the sowing of clover seed, it has
been roughly calculated that between 50/ and 60/ per acre would
have been expended in doing the work. But this outlay has been
repaid in every case, for the new pastures formed have been known
to carry as much as eight sheep to the acre, in some cases, all the year
round, and an average of three or four sheep is by no means unusual.
Hence it will be seen that money invested in south-eastern country
is a good, solid venture. Also, what is all important for the develop-
ment of this part of the State, as the population increases so the big
schemes will be brought into operation which one day will make
the South-East one of the choicest pastoral and farming areas in the
whole of Australia.
INDUSTRIAL PURSUITS.
After mentioning wool, wheat and barley, the resources of the
South-East are by no means exhausted. First of all there are the
wonderful forests of pmus insignis that cover many thousands of
acres of country. The latest figures available give the following
areas planted with trees in the South East:—
Mount Gambier 75
Mount Burr and Mount Muirhead 25,329.1
Glenroy 8,064
Mundulla 5231

In addition to the above, 42, 819 acres have been enclosed for
planting. The ample, regular rainfall has lent itself to a prolific

growth of vegetation, and great success has been achieved in the
establishment of coniferous plantations. Originally, upon large
tracts, there existed extensive, well-stocked forests of eucalypts, of
which traces are still to be seen in various reservations. Some of these
particularly stringybark and red gum are regenerating profusely.
Very fine results have been obtained in most cases, and in extensive
areas pinus insignis has reached a maximum production in a minimum
period, and the South Australian Government Forestry Department
has the principal seat of its activities in the South-East. The first
planting of the Department in this part of the State took place at
Mount Gambier in 1876. During 1927 a consignment of 94 tons
of pinus insignis timber was dispatched to Sydney from the Mount
Burr Forest for tests on a commercial basis. The results indicated
that success was achieved in the manufacture of Kraft paper. A
general valuation of the Mount Burr Forest resources of soft wood
has proved that 1,000,000 cubic feet of pine wood is available per
annum, sufficient for an 18-ton mill. When it is realised that im-
portations of timber and paper into South Australia in 1927 were
9,127,154 tons and 22,111 tons respectively, it will be seen that
afforestation will hold by no means an unimportant place in the
future wealth producing industries of the State.
In the South-East there are about 10,000 acres under acacia
decurrens, or black wattle, and from these trees is obtained good
yields of wattle bark. It is estimated that from four to five cwts.
of bark is produced per acre, averaging somewhere in the neighbor-
hood of £lO per ton. The bark is used in the manufacture of
tannin, or dye for leather tanning. Although the bark from the
South-East is proved to produce one of the best tanning materials
in the world, the industry is up against a very strong competitor
in South African bark, which is imported at an average of about
£ 2 to £ 3 per ton less than the market price of the local product.
None of this bark is imported into South Australia, but practically
the whole of it goes to Melbourne and Sydney, where it comes into
serious competition with the product of South Australia. Even
with the aid of an import duty of £ 3 per ton, South Australian
wattle bark cannot be landed in Sydney as cheaply as South African
and the fact that the former is able to command a better price there
is due to its higher tannin content. Located on the main road
between Kingston and Robe is a large bark mill which has been
the means of supporting many local growers for a number of years.
In Mount Gambier experiments have been made with the object
of establishing a sugar industry, producing the commodity from
sugar beet. It has been proved that the soil in the Mount Gambier
district and in the drainage areas of Millicent possess characteristics
whch make it pre-eminently suitable for the production of roots
of the finest quality, and with the highest possible sugar content.
This opens up a further field for future operations.
Near Kingston, indications have been found of the possible
presence of that elusive, but greatly sought-after fluid—oil. Some
years ago a syndicate was formed to bore in the selected locality,
but funds ran out before oil was struck. After lying idle for some


time, a newly formed syndicate has subscribed sufficient to continue
boring to such a depth as will prove the presence, or otherwise, of
the liquid. Local residents are very sanguine regarding the possibili-
ties of the venture.
Quite a profitable industry has been established in the export
of frozen rabbits and the sale of the furs. Trappers scour the
country and leave their catch at convenient depots where the rabbits
are collected in vans and taken to cold stores in Mount Gambier.
From there they are exported interstate and to London. Hundreds
of thousands of rabbits are made use of in this way every year.
As a source of information for future possible residents, and
also to indicate the greater potentialities of the South-East, the
results of experiments and knowledge gleaned by Mr. Morris Hart,
an experienced agriculturist of Millicent are of considerable interest.
The swampy lands in the lower South-East are suitable for the
growing of white mustard, and it is contended that in addition to
affording a good sheep feed, the installation of a mill would be
the means of producing large quantities of mustard for household
use.
Potato growing, already a small but well-established industry,
has every opportunity for expansion when other markets are ex-
ploited. By careful selection of seed, and changes of soil, potato
crops can be greatly increased, but present market conditions are so
erratic that growers do not feel inclined to increase production. One
season the price per ton may be very high, while next season a very
poor figure is offered, and many growers are left with large quantities
on their hands.
Several farmers have grown experimental crops of tobacco, and
results have been distinctly promising. Among the varieties grown
are Connecticut and Virginia, and the cured leaves have been very
highly commented upon, being up to two feet long and about nine
inches broad. This industry opens up still further possibilities.
The Coonawarra Fruit Colony, about six miles north of Penola
is a splendid example of what the South-East can do in the matter
of fruit production, but this district is by no means alone in its soil
suitability. Almose every part of the South-East can be adapted
to fruit, and according to conditions, the following varieties can
profitably be grown:—apples, pears, plums, peaches, cherries, nectar-
ines, apricots, quinces, mulberries, figs, oranges, lemons, limes etc.
Irrigation can be entirely dispensed with.
In compiling this publication, about 5,000 miles of country
was covered, and the use of an Oldsmobile Top Gear Six greatly
facilitated the work.

A HOLIDAY IN THE SOUTH-EAST
THE VALLEY AND BROWNE’S LAKE, NEAR MOUNT GAMBIER,
With the Oldsmobile Top-gear Six on the track up to the Centenary Tower. Copies of photograph obtainable from Arthur’s Studios, Mount Gambier.
There are many charming spots in South Australia where
a holiday may be spent, and he would indeed be hard to please
who did not find enjoyment in the South-East. This delightful
district is a heritage of which South Australians may well be proud.
The handiwork of Nature above and below the earth’s surface is
as beautiful as it is spectacular. The air is fresh and bracing, and
the inhabitants sociable and hospitable.
Realizing the wonderful attractions which the South-East
holds for pleasure seekers and sight-seers, the Government Tourist
Bureau regularly conducts tours to that locality. A speciality
has been made of a nine-day jaunt, and this excursion has proved
exceedingly popular. It can be taken at any time of the year
except at Christmas and Easter, when special escorted parties are
■ organized.
Of the beauties of Mount Gambier, which is the principal
stopping-centre for tourists, much might be written. Before any-
thing else, visitors naturally make a point of seeing the crater lakes.
There are four of these unique features, of which of course the
famous Blue Lake receives the greatest attention. Almost entirely
surrounded by precipitous walls, this picturesque sheet of water
covers 174 acres, and to drive around it means a three miles detour.
The chief characteristic about the Leg of Mutton Lake is in its shape,
which is strikingly like the joint after which it is named. Brown
and Valley Lakes are tucked away under the foot of the Mount
itself, and afford opportunities for swimming and boating. Cave
Garden Reserve is a unique attraction situated right in the centre
of the town, which is up-to-date, and contains many fine public
buildings and business establishments. In the vicinity of Mount
Gambier are numerous small settlements, where dairy-farming and
pig-rearing are extensively practised, and the population of the
town and district is in the region of 10,000 souls.
Apart from its glorious inland scenery, the South-East has
several seaside resorts of conspicuous merit. At Port Mac Donnell,
the most southerly port of the State, are ample facilities for a
pleasureable holiday. Boating, swimming, fishing, tennis, etc., may
be indulged in, while a number of motor drives to nearby places of
interest are well worth while. About three miles away, for
instance, is “Dingley Dell,” where Adam Lindsay Gordon, Aus-
tralia’s premier poet, lived for some years. On the other side
of the town is Cape Northumberland, the well-known lighthouse.
Beachport, which is reached by a train journey of 51 miles
from Mount Gambier, has its own particular attractions, viz., a
rugged coastline, the lighthouse on Penguin Island, and a chain of
picturesque lakes.
Included in the itinerary of the Government Tourist Bureau
is a visit to Glenelg River, a Victorian stream which crosses the
border and flows through three miles of South Australian territory.
Sportsmen are assured of a busy time here, as it is a favourite haunt
of duck and other wild game, while the river seems full of perch,
bream, salmon and trout.
On the return journey to Adelaide a call is made at Naracoorte,
so that the world-famed cacves may be inspected. There are ten
caves in the group, but interest is centred mainly on the Big Cave,
Alexandra and Victoria. The latter two are electrically lighted,
and the visitor is conducted through them by an experienced guide,
who is always in attendnace. Stalactites and stalagmites of great
beauty and assuming all sorts of weird shapes and forms are seen
in these subterranean chambers. The Big Cave is a vast cavern in
which tourists may dine in comfort, for tables and seats are provided,
and ample daylight is admitted from openings at each end.

fVhat does the CODLIN MOTH Cost YOU — SMr. Orchardist?
Whether little or much, it means that you are not getting the full percentage of profit from your orchard,
and with all the trouble and expense attached to spraying, it is very disappointing to find that, even after spraying,
the crop is still heavily affected.
The Arsenate of Lead that embodies all
the necessary qualities to ensure the
Orchardist full protection against his
worst enemy —THE CODLIN MOTH.
“AERO” Brand Arsenate of Lead is
impalpably fine and light in texture,
ensuring an unbroken film over the fruit,
thus giving the maximum protection. It
mixes easily, suspends perfectly, and will
not choke the spray nozzle. “AERO”
brand Arsenate of Lead has a high arsenic
content giving great protective power. It
has a very low percentage of soluble
arsenic and consequently, will not burn
the foliage.
Bad Fruit,
Results from one of three things.
.1. Not Spraying at all.
2. Spraying badly or mistimed appli
cation.
3. Using poor material.
“Aero” Arsenate of Lead guards
against trouble from the third cause.
Clean Fruit
only results from constant care and atten-
tion, and the use of an Arsenate of Lead
that is effective in its control of the
Codlin Moth. This is where “Aero”
Arsenate of Lead proves its superiority
over inferior makes.

ARSENATE OF LEAD
Our new Arsenate of Lead works at West Croydon. The building
is constructed on the most modern factory tines and is reptete with
every convenience for the comfort and welfare of the staff.
When you buy “Aero” Arsenate of
Lead you buy
Immunity from Codlin Moth,
provided you do your part in applying
the spray.
Practical results after all, are what
the Orchardist wants. Read what
satisfied users say —
Narre Warren, Victoria.
Dear Sirs,
Two years ago I tried a sample of your
“Aero” brand Arsenate of Lead powder,
with the result that last season I used It
exclusively, and I can strongly recom-
mend it. It is finer and stronger than
any other Arsenate of Lead I have ever
used. Last season I made three applica-
tions of spray, the last one on the Jona-
thans just before picking at a strength of
1 lb. of Arsenate of Lead to 80 gallons of
water, and I can honestly say that there
was not a cleaner orchard in this district
I harvested over 2,000 cases of clean fruit.
The Best is the cheapest.
Yours faithfully,
F. 11. AIJMANN.
Doncaster, Victoria.
Dear Sirs,
I have now used your spraying com-
pound for three, seasons with the greatest
success. I consider with your "Aero”
brand Arsenate of Lead, used thoroughly,
four sprayings will keep the orchard im-
mune from Codlin Moth. I am thoroughly
satisfied with it and intend using your
Arsenate of Lead again this coming season.
Being so fine in texture, it covers well, and,
what is more important, it is not readily
washed off, even by heavy rain.
Wishing "Aero” the success it deserves,
I am, yours faithfully,
H. G. REYNOLDS.

Glenelg is to-day the leading watering place of

Dear Sir,
We are taking this opportunity to announce the fact that we have
something new to offer you,—something that will mean the saving of
hundreds of pounds. You realise, of course, the important part that
is being played by subterranean clover in the pastoral areas; you
realise that to keep up with the times you must plant more seed.
Why not plant YOUR OWN clover seed? Our new CLOVER SWEEPER has
been made by request of clover growers. By its use you may collect
all your seed after the season is over. Will you let us further
inform you on the use of our machine, and save yourself the cost of the
old hand-raking method?
We would be pleased to forward you further particulars.
We are,
Yours faithfully,

NARACOORTE AND PENOLA
Embracing I.ucindale, Kybybolite Hvnam and Co onawarra.
Mr. William (Platt was born at Naracoorte on March 13, 1869, and
received his education at the Naracoorte Public School. His late father
was one of the earliest pioneers of the district, .settling near Hynam in the
early ’6o’s, and later establishing a business as builder and contractor in
Naracoorte, in partnership with the late Wm. Marshall.
Mr. Wm. Platt went into business with his father, and on the latter’s
death, his younger son took his place, forming the present firm of Platt
Bros.
For 25 years Air. Wm. Platt has been in business in Naracoorte, and at
the time of the inception of the Corporation of Naracoorte he was elected
on the Council.
For four years he was chairman of the works committee. In 1928
he stood for Mayor, but was defeated by the narrow margin of three votes.
In the following year, he stood again, and received office by a large
majority.
Air- Wm. Platt is a bachelor, and his sister, Miss Edith Platt, holds
the position as Mayoress.
Air. Platt has always been a keen athlete, and represented South
Australia on two occasions in inter-colonial rifle matches. For about 40
years he w r as one of the principal players of the Naracoorte Cricket Club.
At the present time he is president of that body, and president of the South
Eastern Cricket Association. He also played football for his district, and
is president of the local club. Air. (Platt was, for three years, president
of the Pastoral and Agricultural Society of Naracoorte, and is now vice-
president. He is past provincial Grand Alaster of the Oddfellow’s' Society
in the South-East. For 20 years he has held office as chairman of trustees
of the Mosquito Plains Lodge. He is also a high Freemason. For many years
he was an enthusiastic military man, and was sergeant-major of the old
light horse regiment.
Mr. WILLIAM PLATT, J.P.
Mayor of Naracoorte.
■m T ARACOORTE, one of South Australia's show districts and
j\l favourite tourist resorts, was founded as far back as the AO’s.
“*■ * about 240 miles from Adelaide, some 20 miles from the
Victorian border. 1 he earliest known settler in the district was
the late George Ormerod, who actually had the land on which
Naracoorte now stands. Another early pioneer was the late John
Robertson, who, with his brother William, took up land on the
Mosquito Plains (as Naracoorte was more familiarly called in the
early days), and commenced raising cattle and horses. T he mag-
nificent ‘‘Struan’’ estate now bears tribute to the industry of these
two men, and Mr. Alex. Robertson, son of the late founder, now
carries on the industries of the holding.
The first practical start was given to the town by the late
William Macintosh who arrived in the district in 1845 for the
purpose of sheep farming. Unable to find a suitable run, however.
he established a small store, and a little later a public house, on the
site of the present Naracoorte Hotel. From that time Naracoorte
gradually went ahead, till to-day it is regarded as one of the most
flourishing and progressive districts in the whole of rural South
Australia. About five years ago the Corporation of Naracoorte
was proclaimed, and the present population is a little over 3,000
people.
The town possesses its own newspaper, the "Naracoorte
Herald,” which is issued bi-weekly. This journal was commenced
in 1876, when Messrs. Mather and Caldwell printed the first local
paper and set up business as general printers. In the 1880’s Archi-
bald Caldwell took over the establishment as sole proprietor, and
his son, Mr. D. Caldwell, now conducts the whole concern. There
is a large Institute and Public Library, a modern Post and Telegraph
Office, High School and Public School, and six places of worship.

There are three hotels to accomodate visitors, one of which, the
Commercial, is maintained on particularly up-to-date lines. Attach-
ed to it there are open and lock-up garages and fine sample rooms
for commercial men, while the house accomodation, saloon bars, and
table are equal to the best. Three banking houses and a fine hos-
pital are also among the town's assets. J here are several stone
surfaced tennis courts, and each Easter a tournament is held for the
championship of the south-east. The entries for these events
actually are numbered in hundreds. Bowling greens and croquet
lawns, golf links, and oval are also available for the use of the local
residents and visitors. The Naracoorte Race Course is the scene of
several attractive meetings every year.
Among the town’s industries are the building and contracting
works of Messrs. Platt Bros., whose activities extend throughout
Naracoorte and neighbouring districts; Messrs. Farmer & Sons
aerated waters and cordial manufactures; several motor engineering
works, among which is chiefly the Kincraig Motor Company, which
is particularly well equipped with modern appliances for the im-
mediate attention of visitors cars; and a flour mill, a subsidiary to
the Commercial Milling Company of Mount Gambier. From a
tourist point of view, of course, the Naracoorte Caves are almost
universally known. There are few more beautiful works of nature
to be seen anywhere than these magnificent caves, and with careful
attention of the South Australian Government, tourists who desire
to inspect them are well catered for. The caves are located about
seven miles from the town, and service cars are available at all times
for transport.
As a pastoral district, Naracoorte has no superior in the state.
Since the advent of subterranean clover it has advanced a hundred-
fold, and its high stock carrying capacity has earned it a great
reputation among wool growers.
Situated about seven and twelve miles north-west of Naracoorte
are, respectively, Hynam and Kybybolite. These two districts
are the centres of rich farming and grazing lands, and in the latter
is located the Government experimental farm and orchard. Lucin-
dale is about 20 miles east of Naracoorte, and is another fine farm-
ing and grazing locality. During recent years much has been done
in these parts in the matter of clearing the scrub, and the value of
the land as a consequence has increased enormously. In one instance,
a man owned an area of scrub land that would carry little more than
one sheep to ten acres. After clearing it and planting subterranean
clover, the land carried, with ease, four to five sheep to the acre all
the year round.
Moving south from Naracoorte, at a distance of 23 miles one
encounters the garden of the south-east, —the Coonawarra Fruit
Colony. This district covers an area of 1,000 acres, and was
originally a portion of the late John Riddoch s estate. It was
split up into fruit blocks and sold to new owners. In 1896 a
large wine cellar was erected by Mr. Riddoch near the Naracoorte
Road (in the Coonawarra district), and this cellar had a storage
capacity of 290,000 gallons. A large brandy distillery was later
in operation there. Ihe cellars and distillery are now owned by
Messrs. Milne & Co., wine and spirit merchants, of Adelaide. The
soil at Coonawarra is particularly suited to the production of grapes
and other fruits, especially apricots, and thousands of cases of fresh
and dried fruits are exported by the orchardists every year.
Penola is situated 31 miles south of Naracoorte, about 270
miles from Adelaide. It was founded in the year 1844 by the late
Alexander Cameron, and is one of the oldest settlements in the south-
east. For many years the district consisted almost entirely of three
large station properties, “Yallum,” owned by the late John Riddoch,
"Katnook,” and “Glen Roy,” but when these estates were subdivided
into smaller holdings, and new settlers were able to enter the district,
Penola made a decided step forward. At the present time the town
is a small, but progressive little business centre, in which two hotels,
two large banking houses, and stores carry the bulk of the commerce.
The Royal Oak Hotel has just recently been extended to cope with
the increasing traffic and to accomodate the travelling public.
Penola is a sort of intermediate between the two larger centres,
Naracoorte and Mount Gambier, each of which is exactly 31 miles
from Penola, and travellers to and fro’ are well catered for in this
town. R. HW. Balnaves Ltd. hold the pride of position as lead-
ing storekeepers in the district, and it is certainly a tribute to the
advanced conditions of the residents to see the large and up-to-date
stocks held by the company. Penola is chiefly a pastoral district,
but the soil is also suitable for growing fruits of such varieties as
grapes, figs, oranges, peaches and others adapted for the warmer
temperate climates.
In past wet seasons, Penola has suffered from an excess of water,
but since the intervention of the local District Council and the
Government, in installing drainage systems, this trouble has been
greatly eliminated, and the district is now comparatively dry. Jhe
present population is a little over 1,800.
Quite recently a discovery was made that may, in future years,
lead to popularising Penola as a tourist resort. Three local resi-
dents, Messrs. Fred Kidman, C. Flint and R. Modistach accidentally
discovered an opening in the ground that led to a small, but ex-
tremely beautiful cave, similar to those at Naracoorte. Jhe stalac-
tites and stalagmites are certainly of smaller formation, but that does
not lessen their beauty. There are apparently three or four small
caves, and it is possible that further exploration will reveal more.
The caves are known as Mombulla Caves, and are located about six
miles south-west' of Penola.

The interests of motorists are well catered for in the south-
east. especially at Narracoorte, where the Kincraig Motor Company
has its headquarters and has established an up-to-date garage, work-
shops, service station, showrooms and accessories store. It is a
welcome port of call for overlanding parties to Victoria.
The business commenced in 1923, on the site of the present
premises in Simth Street, Narracoorte. The proprietors were Mr.
F. A. Holmes and Mr. M. Beaton, but in 1925 Mr. Holmes became
sole proprietor and his activities in extending the operations of the
company have proved a great benefit to motorists in the south-east.
1 he first garage to be built was quickly outstripped by the needs of
the district and within 6 months of founding the company, the
premises had to be enlarged. Offices were added and the garage
space increased, making a frontage of 75 feet to Smith street by a
depth of 6a feet, with a further 120 feet of space at the rear.
Recently a new office and accessories department were installed and
this year another extension was necessary in the shape of a workshop
a 9 feet by 25 feet, the front portion of which will be used as an
extra garage space for cars.
A modern showroom serves to display the cars for which the
company holds the agency, under the best possible conditions.
When the Kincraig Company started, it was associated with Stude-
baker and Ford, but when General Motors opened in Australia,
their makes were given preference, and with excellent results. In
addition to holding the agency for General Motors products,
including Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oakland and Vauxhall, the com-
pany provides a complete service for every make of car, and it
deals extensively in used cars of all descriptions. The business has

// Padthaway” Station was Established nearly 80 Years ago
A PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE "PADTHAWAY" HOMESTEAD.
People who read of Australian sheep runs totalling thousands
of square miles, and, who recall the days when nuggets of gold
were to be had for the mere picking up off the ground, cannot be
blamed if they think this is a romantic land. Actually, of course,
hard work is the road to success in Australia as it is everywhere
else, but what the pioneers went through and achieved is not with-
out a tinge of romance. Take the Lawsons of Padthaway and
Lake Roy Stations, near Naracoorte. The building up of their
holding, which is probably the largest in the south-east, reads like
a chapter out of a story.
The first owner of Padthaway, the late Mr. Robert Lawson,
who was born in Ayrshire, Scotland, in 1861, inherited a fine estate
when he became 21 years old. The adventurous spirit was within
him, however, and hearing tales of a new Eldorado, he decided to
say goodbye to Scotland. He left his estate rent free to his tenants
and set sail for South Australia, in 1839, in the good ship “Superb.
Sea travel in those days was like a voyage with Christopher
Colombus. Many months were spent on the blue water before, the
emigrants secured a sight of the promised land.
On his arrival, Mr. Lawson was not long in making up his
mind what part of South Australia he wanted to settle in. He
made his way over the hills to Mt. Barker and the very early
forties saw him established there in a little turf homestead, the
owner of 550 sheep. It was a rich area, and there Mr. Lawson
might have remained, but for the discovery of copper. He was

one of the finders of it, and immediately there was a rush of
miners. The population became so thick that sheep farming
became a difficulty and Mr. Lawson looked round for wide spaces
to run his flock on. He had married Miss Bell, a daughter of a
Mt. Barker pioneer, and in 1851, the pair set out from Adelaide,
for Padthaway, in the far south-east, where Mr. Lawson took up an
area of 53,760 acres of virgin land.
The journey to their new home was made on horseback, past
Lake Alexandrina, across the Murray, and through Meningie to
the Coorong. Even today, nearly 80 years afterwards, the traver-
sing of the Coorong is looked upon as a sometimes hazardous under-
taking by motorists. What must it have been in 1851, when
there was no road to guide the young Scotsman and his wife, and
not even a settler’s hut for scores of miles. The Lakes district
and the Coorong were then the hunting ground of the blacks.
Huge numbers of them carried on a lazy existence, spearing the
waters for fish and making raids on the wildfowl with which the
district once teemed. Old residents of Meningie and Goolwa can
recall the days when bands of natives a thousand strong, armed
with waddies and stones, started a grand offensive against the swans,
slaying and butchering until they fell exhausted through sheer
weariness. As they passed through this country, the Lawsons’
camp was frequently disturbed by marauding blacks, but while in
the Mt. Barker district, Mr. Lawson was quick to learn their ways,
and for many years the natives in the south-eastern district were

indebted to him for a large aboriginal encampment he maintained
at Padthaway.
Being an energetic settler, Mr. Lawson lost no time in estab-
lishing a home in what was then a wilderness. A low-built old-
world homestead was constructed out of stone, and it is still
preserved as a memory of the grand old pioneer. Feeling the need
of still more space, Mr. Lawson secured an additional 28,000
acres of plains country in the swampy Mosquito Plains district.
The whole run amounted to 131 square miles, and the annual
rental cost dL 1,236 12/. This figure shows.that Mr. .Lawson not
only went in for sheep on a big scale, but that he had faith in the
possibilities of the land he had selected.
He worked at the place practically night and day. Very
heavy timber had to be cleared from it, and it speaks volumes for
his industry when it is mentioned that within a few years Mr.
Lawson had ringbarked enough trees and cleaned up sufficient ground
to carry 26,500 merino sheep, 250 head of cattle, and a number
of horses. The latter were bred from stallions secured from New
South Wales and for many years Mr. Lawson did an extensive
trade in remounts for India. The main industry was the raising of
merino sheep, and cattle grazing, for both of which Padthaway
became famous. The Lake Roy property which adjoins Padthaway
was purchased by a later generation. Naracoorte is about 19
miles from the Lake Roy homestead, while the Padthaway home-
stead is a dozen miles further along the main road to Wood’s Well.
The.two properties today cover an area of 47,425 acres, of which
7,758 acres are held under right of purchase, 8,328 acres under
perpetual lease, and the remainder freehold. The freehold consists
of about 2,315 acres at Lake Roy and 29,024 acres at Padthaway.
At one time the Government acquired many choice sections of
Padthaway for closer settlement, but Mr. Robert Lawson was fre-


THIS STATION IS ASSOCIATED WITH "PABTHAWAI"
quently asked to buy it back by the small holders and gradually
Padthaway became consolidated into a freehold property. Mr.
Lawson died in 1876, at the age of 60 years, leaving the property
in trust to his two sons and a life tenancy to his widow, who died
in 1913.
After the passing of this great pioneer, Padthaway was managed
for 20 years by Mr. John Bell, a nephew of Mrs. Lawson, and
after that by the elder of the two sons. The owners today are
Mr. Allan Bell Lawson and his two sons. The Lake Roy property
which Mr. A. B. Lawson purchased in 1899 from'the estate of
the late John Neil, was transferred to his wife in 1912.
Mr. A. B. Lawson is a very progressive pastoralist. In the
early nineties he leased part of the Riversdale estate at Tailem Bend
and for fifteen years he used this during the winter months for fat-
tening sheep which he purchased in the south-east and kept for a
while at Lake Roy. The scheme paid very well and Mr. A. B.
Lawson's foresight in regard to it contributed in a large measure to*
the building of the family’s pastoral interests. Riversdale was-
solely a grazing proposition and in 1906, Mr. Lawson disposed of
his interest in it.
Mr. A. B. Lawson was an apt pupil of his father so far as
sheep and cattle were concerned, and the tradition has been handed
down to his eldest son, Mr. Allan Keith Lawson, who has assumed
the management of Padthaway and resides at the homestead. Mr.
Ernest Robert Lawson, second son of Mr. A. B. Lawson, completed
his electrical engineering course at the Adelaide University, a study
which fascinated him, but the call of the land eventually prevailed’
and Mr. E. R. Lawson will later on take over the full management
of the family's interest at Lake Roy, where Mr. and Mrs. A. B:
Lawson reside. Ihe homestead at Lake Roy was completed
by Mr. Lawson in 1907. It is undoubtedly one of the finest
country houses to be found in South Australia from all points ot
view, including architecture, appointments, modern conveniences.


and beauty of surroundings. I he homestead at Padthaway is
a wonderful old two storied building of 22 rooms in which every
possible comfort has been provided.
With such a big acreage, it is natural that a large quantity of
timber should remain on the joint holdings. The extensive areas
that have been thinned out, however, have left the country with a
lovely park-like appearance, with lakes and creeks that add to the
picturesqueness of it all. The sheep and the cattle find a wealth
of pasturage, although this is not maintained without constant
watchfulness over the rabbit pest. There are 51 paddocks on
Padthaway and Lake Roy, and for many years it was a problem to
secure the upper hand over the rabbits. A system of wirenetting
along the boundaries and around a forest reserve in the centre of
the runs help considerably. Altogether there are 140 miles of
rabbit-proof fencing, the netting being 4 ft. high and buried six
inches under the ground. All the year round two mechanical rabbit

exterminators are kept employed. 4be forest reserve referred to
is a valuable illustration as showing the amount of improvement
that has been carried out on Padthaway and Lake Roy. The reserve
is practically in its virgin state.
The annual shearing is just at present around the 20,000 mark.
They are all purebred merinos with a wool of super 64’s quality,
long staple and clean. It has a good spinning quality and is much
sought by manufacturers, the bales always being among the highest
priced lots at the Geelong auction sales. A motor truck is used
to transport it to Naracoorte. In the old days bullock drays took
the wool over the swamps to the coast, about 70 miles away, the
return trip taking over two weeks.
The Padthaway and Lake Roy sheep are based on the best
South Australian and Tasmanian blood, and they do not appear to
suffer through the wetness of the country. At the time of the 1914
drought, the flocks decreased by about 10,000 and to build them
up 5,000 ewes were secured from the Dunlop station in the north-
west of New South Wales. Another 3,000 ewes came from 4 ra-
walla, in Victoria, at that time owned by the late Admiral Bridges.


Ihe newcomers fitted in well with the station sheep. Plain bodies,
medium sized frame, and even covering of fleece are characteristics
of the Padthaway and Lake Roy sheep. Rigid classing is practised
and to maintain the quality a stud has been established. The
average cut of fleece, particularly from the wethers, varies very little,
revealing how well the flocks have been standardised by rejecting
anything of doubtful value. Lhe lambing is also good, the actual
markings in 1928 being 77 per cent. The shearing shed which was
erected in 1880 has 13 stands of machines and it deals with the
sheep from both Padthaway and Lake Roy. Over 1,100 sheep
can be handled a day.
Mr. A. B. La wson has always possessed a love for the thorough-
bred and with his sons taking the helm at both Padthaway and
Lake Roy, he has been able to devote a good deal of time to breeding

and racing during the past few years. Mr. Lawson is a fine type
of sportsman. In his early days he was a first-class footballer
and cricketer at college, and has never lost his love for cricket.
Frequently he toured the western districts of Victoria with south-
eastern teams, and on no fewer than three occasions he took 7
wickets for no runs; against strong elevens, too. Mr. Lawson,
while attending today to his favorite sport of kings looks back with
pleasure on his old-time associations with the athletic field. He
has shown good judgment in his racecourse and breeding ventures.
Lady Lucknow, a speedy daughter of a Melbourne Cup winner in
Lucknow, is kept by him. Lady Lucknow has had a remarkable
sequence of wins in the South-East. In her first season
she recorded six firsts, two seconds and two thirds. Another
to run under his colours was Quindaro, a hurdler and steeplechaser,
bred by Mr. Ben Chaffey, which won numerous races and held the
record for the Morphettville course. Others that come to mind

are Nanapa and Andrada. The latter carried off both Naracoorte
and Millicent Cups and Rametta won the Mt. Gambier Cup for
him.
Mr. Lawson is a member of numerous sporting bodies, espec-
ially in the south-east, and his son, Mr. A. K. Lawson, follows in his
footsteps in this respect. Lika his father, too, he is an enthusiastic
rifle shot. Living in an area that once abounded in wild-fowl it
is natural that shooting should be popular with the Lawson family
and the armoury at Padthaway would delight the heart of the sports-
men who regularly visit the Lakes at the opening of the duck season.
All the Lawson family are ardent motorists and quite a fleet
of cars is maintained for home use and for overlanding to Melbourne
and Adelaide. The growth of aviation has also attracted them
and Mr. Lawson’s sons have interested themselves in it. Mr.
E. R. Lawson has taken out a pilot’s “A” licence, and recently
piloted a Gipsy “moth” to the Melbourne pageant and back to Ade-
laide. Mr. A. Keith Lawson is now due for his pilot’s certificate
and has ordered a Gipsy “moth” of the latest type.
The development of civil aviation depends on the prac-
tical support accorded it as a means of transport by leading
citizens, and the fact that Mr. Lawson’s sons have taken it up is
further proof of the enterprise shown by the Lawson family in
relation to all modern improvements and progressive ideas.

ALEXANDER ROBERTSON "STRUAN"
".Struan House/' on the Penola Hoad near Naracoorte, is famous throughout Australia
A VIEW OF THE STATELY "STRUAN HOUSE."
The foundation of ‘‘Struan” station, on the Penola road, about
ten miles from Naracoorte, goes back into the very early days of
South Australia. The run was discovered by John and William
Robertson, in 1842, Mr. Alexander Robertson, the present
proprietor, being the son of the firstnamed. John Robertson was
born at Dunachton, in Inverness-shire in 1809, and came to
Australia in the Ship “St. George’’ in 1838. He landed at Sydney,
and then decided to move on to Victoria. The Wannon river
district in the middle west of Victoria appealed to him, and for
several years he was engaged there in pastoral pursuits.
Mr. John Robertson thought there might be good country
in the extreme west of Victoria, close to the South Australian border,
and with his brother William, he went on a tour of exploration
that ended in them occupying a large area of Mosquito Plains in

1842. From that original settlement, “Struan" was established,
the area at the start being 43,520 acres, the rental of which ran into
a little over £ll a square mile. The run quickly became known
as “Robertson’s Plains,” and a few years later a township sprang
up. The brothers soon extended their operations by the purchase
of the Warrattenbullie Station, which was adjoining, and in 1868,
the opportunity was taken to convert large areas of the Mosquito
Plains, into which “Struan” extended for a number of miles, into
freehold. With other parts that had already been made secure of
tenure, this consolidated “Struan” into' a big holding.
The partnership between the brothers was dissolved by mutual
consent in the early seventies, Mr. William Robertson settling near
Casterton in Victoria. This.left Mr. John Robertson, who was
popularly known as the “Laird of Struan in sole charge of this


magnificent property, and being enterprising, he lost no time in
adding to its acreage. In 1875 he purchased "Elderslie" station
on the Victorian side of the border next to "Struan.” The new
purchase was one of the finest properties in the South-East in its
day, and covered 35,420 acres. Mr. John Robertson at one time
also owned "Woodford" station on the Glenclg river, and a stretch
of valuable country at Portland. There was a period, indeed, when
the estates owned and leased by this enterprising pastoralist ran into
125,000 acres. Estimates of the stock when the holdings were at
their peak were 60,000 sheep, 2,000 cattle and 500 pedigreed
thoroughbreds.
A GLIMPSE OF “ STRUAN” THROUGH ITS BEAUTIFUL SURROUNDING OF PINES.
Mr. John Robertson was a keen student of sheep, and lost no
opportunity to build up a flock of outstanding quality. The
“Struan” flocks were bred from the best Tasmanian blood of the
time, and it was not long before the “Struan” wool gained fame
for its exceptionally fine quality. Such results could not have been
secured without a lot of work being put into the land. Clearing
was constantly going on, and gradually huge areas of timber
country were turned into park-like pastures. The sheep was always
kept separate from the cattle, different grazing tracts being provided
for each. The blood stock also had special paddocks to themselves.
The finishing touch to the property in Mr. John Robertson’s
day was the magnificent “Struan House,” which he began building
in 1873, and did not complete until late in 1875. This replaced
the homestead that was built in the sixties. Prior to that, away
back in the forties, the first homestead had been built. “Struan
House” eclipsed anything previously seen in the South-East, and
at its official opening in 1876, no fewer than 150 guests attended
the house warming. There are over 40 rooms in this stately mansion,
which cost about £IO,OOO to build. Its like could not be
constructed to-day for four or five times that amount. Every
convenience was installed, and in the intervening years further
comforts have been added.
“Struan” became a noted half-way house between Adelaide
and Melbourne in the coaching days, the freest hospitality being dis-
pensed by the owner. Many prominent officials, State governors


and judges have been guests in this wonderful old place which was
the centre of the social life of the south-east. With the closer
settlement of the district, and so much of the “Struan” land being
alienated, the old customs gradually disappeared and when “Elders-
lie” was acquired by the government for the purposes of soldier
settlement the total area of the run was decreased to 1 1,500 acres.
I he passing of Mr. John Robertson, in 1880 was received with
widespread sorrow. Apart from the hospitality he extended to all,
sheepmen realised that the State had lost a flockmaster whose know-
ledge and enterprise were a stimulus to the industry in every part
SOME OF THE “STRUAN ” SHORTHORNS.
of South Australia. In a busy life he found time to think of others
as well as of himself and was never happier than when fathering
schemes to improve the welfare of the district. His remains rest in a
private cemetry on "Struan,” where there is a monument to his
memory, and to that of his wife, Susan, who was a wonderful
helpmate to Mr. John Robertson in all his activities.
Mr. Alexander Robertson inherited the estate on his father’s
of a sheepmaster of outstanding judgment, Mr. Robertson
was fully qualified to carry on the best traditions of ‘Struan.” He
interested himself in improving the pasturages of the run, experi-
menting with different varieties of grass and studying the soil with
the object of fixing the herbages that would best thrive in a
territory that is on the wet side. The run is in an excellent condi-
tion to-day the credit for which is due to the unremitting labours of
Mr. Alexander Robertson.
For many years all the “Struan shearing was done on the
Warrattenbullie section, but in 1927. Mr. Robertson disposed of this
part of the property and acquired a new tract of 3,500 acres of free-
death. Having spent all his life on the estate under the tutelage
hold known as “Wirringulla” which adjoined “Struan”. The two
properties cover about 15,000 acres which at present carry 14,000
merino sheep, several hundred head of cattle and a number of
thorough-bred horses. The average of sheep per acre is high con-
sidering the extent of the country, and it could not be achieved
without constant attention to the pastures. Mr. Robertson was


one of the first to adopt topdressing and he spares no money in his
endeavour to maintain the stock carrying capacity at its maximum.
In the course of years “Struan” has been practically cleared of
timber, the only reminder of the wilderness that marked the place
in the early days being numerous red and blue gums which provided
shelter for stock and lend a park-like appearance to the place. Both
"Struan” and "Wirringulla" have been closely subdivided, Mr.
Robertson believing - in a policy of concentrated grazing.
Many miles of wirenetting have been erected to keep out the
rabbits and fumigators are also used to exterminate this pest. The
clean state in which the country is kept is reflected in the splendid
health enjoyed by all the stock and the exceptionally clean fleeces
that are a feature of the bales from "Struan”.
Water is plentiful on the station. Sub-artesian bores produce
good supplies at a comparatively shallow depth and several wells
are harnessed with windmills and up-to-date engines. Windmills
have proved the most satisfactory and these are kept going practically
night and day. Constant pumping means an overflow which is
run into the paddocks and by this means fairly extensive patches of
green feed are available throughout the year. This underground
water supply is inexhaustible. On top of it there is an annual
district fall of 24 inches and the Mosquito Creek, which is always
flowing, winds through many parts of the property.
In addition to native grasses, Mr. Robertson has greatly ex-
tended the herbage by plantations of clovers. Cabbage grass has
been sown on parts of the plains, which has been found to provide
a succulent summer food for stock. In other parts the soil is sown
with a wide range of grasses including phalaris bulbosa, rye, pas-
palum, strawberry and subterranean clovers. On the low sandy
hills the African kikuyu grass has proved a great success.
The flock, founded on Tasmanian importations, has been
excellently maintained throughout the years and in 1908 it was
strengthened by a number of rams secured from Eli Elwah station
near Hay in the Riverina. The newcomers assisted to keep up the
size of frame. Since then, Mr. Robertson has established a select
stud of his own. The flock is carefully classed and kempy wool
sheep are not allowed to remain. The same personal attention is
given to the sale sheep as to the wool cutters. The spinning qual-
ity of the fleece is a 64's to 70’s and high prices are invariably secured
A FINE TYPE OF BEEF SHORTHORN BULL AT “STRUAN."
at the Melbourne auctions. The fleece weights range from 9 to 11
lb. for wethers and 8 lb. for ewes.
The shearing is conducted at "Wirringulla" where a new shed
has been erected with 8 stands and all modern equipment. Shearing
is under contract, the wool being carted by bullock teams to Glen-
roy siding about five miles away. Before the advent of the railway,
"Struan" wool is carted for 120 miles to Portland in Victoria.
In times past, the lambing has been fixed for May, but Mr.
Robertson has now changed over to spring lambing owing to the
fact that cold snaps on the plains have been responsible for rather
severe mortality among the young stock during the winter months.
The new policy came into force this year and Mr. Robertson believes
that the weight of the ewe fleeces will increase as a result, and there
will be a further advantage in the lambs developing, more rapidly.
The cattle on the run are a mixed herd at present, which are
fattened on the rich river flats. Mr. Robertson has the nucleus of
a stud herd of shorthorns, which are based on seven picked cows
secured at the dispersal sale of the Rosebank herd at Mount
Pleasant, in 1928. At the same time Mr. Robertson purchased


the bull Clifton Cavalier from Mr. A. J. Simpson of Clifton, Vic-
toria. With such a foundation, a fine shorthorn herd should be
developed. The male progeny will be used to improve the quality
of the general herd, features of the cattle being their docility, fine
colour, and good conformation.
Cultivation has been carried out from time to time at
“Struan”, and excellent returns have been secured from barley.
“Wirringulla” has also proved a prolific barley grower. The crops
maintain the excellent average of 55 to 6Q bushels.
Like his father, Mr. Alexander Robertson is a lover of the
thoroughbred. The “Struan” stables have always housed horses
which did well at the district meetings. Mr. John Robertson was
also a great coursing enthusiast and did much to foster the sport.
Some of the best greyhounds ever seen in Australia were bred on the
estate. Today the output of "Struan" stables is maintained by
the purchase of a few yearlings in Melbourne. They are broken
in. but are not put into training until 4 years old. Mr. Robertson
races for love of the sport only and many fine trophies testify to the
good horses that have been associated with "Struan House.”

R. A. MILES, "BURNSIDE," NARACOORTE
A PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE HOMESTEAD LAND AT " BURNSIDE.”
Extending to the northward of Naracoorte is a long stretch
of slightly undulating and plain country, bounded on the eastern
side by a low range of bills. This represents some of the finest
grazing land in the district, and several old established estates bear
evidence of the richness of the pastures by way of the very excellent
sheep they produce. About 61 miles north of Naracoorte is
“Burnside,” the property of Mr. R. A. Miles, probably one of the
best known pastoral homes in the South-East, and many a fine
thoroughbred that has earned a name on the turf has owed it origin
and early training to the keenness and care of Mr. Miles. This
pastoralist has also turned out some of the best looking Clydesdale
workers in the district, and has marketed merino sheep and wool
that has been always round the top of the quotations. "Burnside”
was purchased by the present owner a little over 20 years ago, and,
ideally situated on the western slopes and foot of low hills, extends
for many miles over flat arable plains.
Mr. Miles has a progressive spirit both as a flock-
master and a farmer. When he serured "Burnside” it covered
2,500 acres of agricultural and pastoral land. To-day it is a
station proposition comprising 6,000 acres of homestead property,
and 17,000 acres of grazing land about 14 miles north from head-
quarters.
The home portion is mostly flat with portions of rising land.
Barley grass, silver grass and various clovers are the natural grasses

with plenty of wild oats. About 3,000 to 4,000 acres have been
cultivated and top dressed, and an area in the region of 500 acres
is put down each year with barley, wheat and oats. These do
well at “Burnside." A good average wheat crop runs into
30 bushels, usually Nagawa and Federation with occasional crops
and Onas. From special paddocks the return has actually gone up
to 14 bags. These figures speak well for the quality of the land at
“Burnside," and are a tribute to the modern farming methods adopted
by Mr. Miles.
The barley average runs to about 40 bushels, up to 60 bushels
per acre being secured in odd years. Oats thrive also, averaging
40 to 60 bushels. The latter are chiefly used for hay, the ex-
ceptionally good cut of 4 tons to the acre being secured. I hese
statistics are convincing proof of what can be done on the Nara-
coortc lands. Mr. Miles finds that Prior is best for malting
barley and Cape for grain. In oats Algerian and Lachlan are
preferred.
.
Cropping methods are studied closely. A paddock is used
only once in three years, and the grain planted is sometimes varied,
In the intermediate years the paddocks are grazed. Super is
drilled in with the grain at the rate of 100 to 120 lb. to the acre,
A combine is used in this work. For grazing purposes about a
hundred acres or so are broadcasted with super.


MR. R. A. MILES’ THOROUGHBRED, RABNEB.
The rainfall at “Burnside” maintains a steady average of
22 inches so that water difficulties are never experienced. Supplies
are secured from numerous springs that abound on the property
and a splendid system of distribution has been installed. No fewer
than 20 windmills have been erected which pump water to all
the 30 paddocks into which the station is divided.
Mr. Miles shears about 6,500 pure merinos. The flock was
established 20 years ago, the foundation being the well-known
Murray blood. Mr. Miles uses Murray and Collins rams and has
fixed an excellent type of wool sheep throughout the flocks. The
quality of the fleece can be estimated when it is remarked that he
has secured as high as 38 M. per lb. The wool is about a 64’s count,
the clip averaging about 93 lb. per sheep. Surplus stock are sold
off as fats. Mr. Miles has found peas to be first-class sheep fodder
and he sows about 100 acres with them every year.
The great stock at “Burnside” include 70 to 80 head of
cattle for dairy and fattening purposes, principally shorthorns. Any
not required for home use arc sold in the market as fat cattle. Mr.
Miles specialises in Clydesdales and blood stock of which he has
about 35. He has frequently entered animals of his own breeding
in the show ring, including in his victories the best draught gelding,
best draught pair, and team of horses at the Naracoorte show.
Being a lover of horses Mr. Miles takes a deep interest in
the racecourse and has gained a number of successes with horses
in Adelaide and elsewhere. He bred "Our Saint," a Tattersalls
Cup winner, by St. Spasa from Antillean. At one time he owned
Sweetmagne, a great galloper, but one of the unluckiest horses ever
seen on the turf. Sweetmagne, always a trier, constantly ran into
places, his principal wins including the Mayor’s Mile and several
weight-for-age races in Adelaide. Mr. Miles also had Little Mervie,
a hurdler, and Rabneb which won a hurdle event at Gawler, a
handicap at Cheltenham and the Nhill Cup. Benares was another
of his string.
Mr. Miles is enthusiastic about the possibilities of the South-
East, and has shown his faith in it by the extensive manner in
which he has increased his holdings. The land at "Burnside”
appears to be suitable for all fodder growths, and turns out a
particularly good sample of lucerne which Mr. Miles raises for his
stock.
The homestead at “Burnside” is well protected from wind and
storm by a plantation of gums and other trees, which almost hide
it from view of the road which passes the front of the house. This
road is the main highway between Naracoorte and Bordertown.
There is a flower garden, and also a small orchard which provides

fruit for domestic requirements. The outbuildings, which include
stables and looseboxes for thoroughbreds and workers, as well as
other essential farm and station buildings, are all well constructed
and modernly appointed, and are mostly situated just at
the rear of, and in close proximity to the homestead. The wool-
shed, which is equipped with four stands for shearers, and is
capable of holding 600 sheep, is built of iron and timber, and lies
a hundred yards or so from the house.
The homestead itself is one of the older, solid types, that were
built in the days when solidity was regarded as the main essential.
The interior is well equipped with all modern accessories, and forms
a most comfortable residence.


JOHN GODFRIED GARTNER "Cool Park”
THE RESIDENCE AT "COOL PARK” IS OF THE MODERN BUNGALOW TYPE.
What can be done in mixed farming in the South-East has
been demonstrated by Mr. J. G. Gartner, of "Cool Park,” the results
being highly encouraging.
"Cool Park" is 14 miles north of Naracoorte, and comprises
894 acres of undulating land that is well suited to either agriculture
or sheep raising. Mr. Gartner, who acquired the estate in 1923,
goes in for both. He cultivates about 300 acres, a tract of 150
acres being devoted to wheat, 100 acres to peas and 25 acres each
to oats and barley. The type of wheat preferred is Onas. It is
a rapid grower and gives good yields of grain. Another reason
why it is planted is because its fast growth beats the weeds. The
average return from wheat is 30 to 3 5 bushels per acre. Mr.
Gartner has actually gathered more than that—4o bushels to the
acre having been taken off some of the paddocks. He entered a
crop for the wheat competitions in the Naracoorte district in 1924
and won the first prize certificate. The variety on this occasion
was Federation.
T he peas are grown as a sheep fodder for which purpose they
are extremely valuable. They returned 8 bags to the acre and
were stripped with a "Sun" header and attachment, and were used
as a rotation crop for wheat. After stripping, Mr. Gartner
fattened 3 sheep to the acre on the paddocks. For making hay
oats are planted, the cut returning an average of 2-23 to 3 tons
an acre. The barley crop, going 40 bushels of grain to the acre,
is used for fowls, horses, cows, and sheep. The barley sown is
one of Mr. Gartner’s own breeding. It is a special six-row light
husk barley almost without shell. Mr. Gartner has made a study
of the Clydesdale and breeds a number of draughts which find a
ready sale.
The rainfall at "Cool Park" is in the region of 26 inches per
annum. Water is secured at a shallow depth and Mr. Gartner is
so impressed with the possibilities of lucerne growing that he intends
to establish an artesian bore and flood the land for lucerne culture.
This fodder has done exceptionally well in the South-East and at
"Cool Park" there are extensive areas that are suited to it.
The home water supplies come from wells, and that for the
stock is drawn from bores and wells. The property is divided
into eight paddocks, water being reticulated to all of them by means
of piping and windmills.


JOHN GOD] Kill) GARTNER "Cool Park"
Like other South-Eastern settlers Mr. Gartner is a firm believer
in the value of subterranean clover and has 230 acres of it at
“Cool Park.” This patch carries 400 ewes and 370 lambs all
the year round. He shears about 1,800 sheep. His method is
to buy strong-woolled merinos and cross them with Shropshire
rams. The product is a fine type of fat lamb. He has now
established a Dorset-Horn stud and is using the rams to obtain
another good line of fats for market. The Dorsets came from Mr.
Marshall's stud at Woodside. The latter included the well-known
Pfeiffer blood, about half being Marshall bred and the other half
Pfeiffer bred. Excellent quality Dorsets are being raised around
Woodside, and there is a good demand for them from other dis-
tricts. The Marshall-Pfeiffer Dorsets will be used at “Cool Park
as the foundation of the stud.
Mr. Gartner is confident that fat lambs will become an im-
portant industry in the South-East. The establishment of a freez-
ing works would make a big difference in this matter. Such
facilities would permit of a big increase in fat lamb production with
the result that “Cool Park” and scores of other properties would
increase considerably in value.

The homestead at “Cool Park" is of the bungalow type, and
is as fine a country residence as could be wished. It is surrounded
by gums, pines, cypress, shrubs, lawns and gardens. The telephone
is installed and a sedan motor provides a comfortable and fast
means of travel.
The outbuildings are all substantial and well cared for. In
the commodious shearing shed there is a 3 h.p. Westinghouse engine
which supplies all the necessary power. In addition it provides the
lights for the homestead and other power. 1 here are 1 5 light
points in the residence and more are to be added. Ihe horse stables
and chaff house are also illuminated. Such conveniences are rare
even on much bigger properties. The stables at Cool Park
accommodate a dozen horses and there is a well-stocked implement
house.


EDWARD C. H. SCHINCKEL, "Mullana”
“MULLANA” HOMESTEAD IS SET IN PRETTY SURROUNDINGS.
The fortunes of Mr. E. C. H. Schinckel, the proprietor of
“Mullana,” two miles west of Kybybolite, turned on efficient farming
and the sowing of subterranean clover. Ele secured the property
in 19 11, in association with his younger brother. It was undulating
pastoral and agricultural land, and a couple of years later an adjoin-
ing block of 1,000 acres was added to it. When the war broke out
his brother, Mr. H. B. Schinckel enlisted and the partnership was
dissolved, but on his return he took over the second property.
The land at “Mullana” was heavily timbered when the brothers
went on to it, the principal growths being red and white gum.
Wallaby grass was prevalent, but it was soon eradicated by cultiva-
tion. A more serious difficulty was the growth of sorrel brought
on by acidity in the soil. Planting subterranean clover proved a
satisfactory remedy for this, the pest; having disappeared.
Except for the clearing, the difficulties in getting the place into
working order were not great. A lot of subdivisional fencing had
to be done, for which the timber on the property was useful. The
surplus timber was removed by grubbing and burning.
A creek ran through the place, being active in winter only, and
on another portion is “Mullana” swamp, a small low-lying tract

that dries up in the summer. No difficulties had to be overcome in
removing stone, from which the property was entirely free.
When sufficient clearing had been done, a start was made with
agriculture and grazing. A flock of 500 to 600 pure merinos
were established formed with 400 Tatiara station-bred ewes as
the basis. These strains are still being used in the present flock
which now runs into 3,000.
Attention was also turned to wheat, about 150 acres being
put in during the first few years, chiefly Federation, which is still
favored where the soil is in its virgin state. Excellent crops were
gathered running up to 8 bags to the acre. An unusually good
oat crop on supered land yielded 60 bushels of grain and three tons
of hay to the acre.
No grain is now grown except when occasion warrants breaking
up the paddocks and cropping to sweeten the soil. The figures,
however, show the potentialities of the south-east as a grain producer.
The rainfall averages 22 to 23 inches, and water is secured from a
well and bore, varying from 50 to 80 feet deep. Supplies are
piped to all the paddocks. Ihe soil is an, easily worked sandy loam
with a clay subsoil, the latter being 8 to 10 inches deep.


A FLOCK ON THE SHADY “MULLANA” PASTURES.
Proof of the energy and progressive methods of Mr. Schinckel
is provided by the fact that in years 1918-19 he won the De Garis Cup
for the best kept and best managed farm in the Naracoorte district.
The sheep from “Mullana” have been exhibited at the Naracoorte
shows and in 1926, Mr. Schinckel won the championship for both
fine and strong woolled merino ram. He has also secured a number
of awards with his ewes.
The clip averages 11.1 lb. per grown sheep and last year the
prices obtained for “Mullana’' wool were the highest for the south-
east. The fleeces count about 64’s and sometimes finer. A number
of “Mullana” fat wethers are sold at the record price for the south-east
of £2/0/4 having been secured for fat sheep off shears. The
wethers in this particular consignment were four years old.
About 8 years ago, when grazing seemed to be a little bit slack,
subterranean clover was sown and topdressing experimented with.
These proved the turning point in the farm’s prosperity. Prior
to this the land supported two sheep to three acres. Now it
carries a little over two sheep to the acre. Mr. Schinckel keeps
mostly breeding ewes and weaners, producing 700 to 800 lambs a
year. The lambing generally averages 90 per cent and in 1928 he
got no fewer than 750 lambs from 800 ewes.
A big advantage in this type of the country is the ease of
working the soil combined with an assured rainfall. Permanent
water can be secured at a reasonable cost and the land responds
remarkably to topdressing and subterranean clover culture. A


A SELECT STUD OE AYRSHIRES IS MAINTAINED AT "MULEANA."
further advantage is the absence of "fluke," and although at times
the sheep become poorly, treatment keeps them fit. The sheep
losses have not exceedeed 1 per cent per annum. Throughout the
year the climate is congenial.
Mr. Schinckel is a strong advocate for subterranean clover,
which makes into a wonderful hay if cut in the spring while green.
Properly stacked it will last for long periods.
The improvements on the farm are substantial and generous.
The fencing is a particularly good job, the posts being cut from
red gum timber on the property. It carries five and six wires with
a top barb. All of it is sheep proof and the boundary is netted on
three sides to keep out the rabbits.
The stable is a substantial structure accommodating about
horses and the wool shed holds about 300 sheep, with storage for
50 bales of wool. Six bins are provided for wool classing and there
are four stands for the shearers. A chaff house and cowshed have
also been erected. Mr. Schinckel keeps the plant in good order.
He has a small Ayrshire stud of about a dozen animals, all of
which are ready for the stud book. The cows have been reared
from a prize cow owned by Mr. W. Shoebridge of Naracoorte, and
the surplus cream from the herd is marketed.
The homestead is a picturesque one containing 1 1 rooms,
constructed of limestone quarried in the Hynam district. Modern
conveniences have been installed and tasteful furnishings lend attrac
tiveness as well as comfort to its appearance.


SYDNEY SHEPHERD "Mullinger Park," near Kybybolite
THE HOMESTEAD AT “MULLINGER PARK.”
The “Mullinger Park” homestead, where resides Mr. Sidney
Shepherd, one of the most successful farmers and graziers in the
south-east, is situated about two miles east of Kybybolite. The
estate now comprises 2,800 acres of agricultural and pastoral land,
of which 620 acres extend into Victoria, and a two-mile frontage on
the interstate border is formed thereby.
j
Mr. Shepherd first settled in the south-east in 1905, when he
acquired 789 acres of grazing land near Kybybolite. The country
was then in its natural state of rough scrub, mostly covered with
blue gum, bull oak, box, and red gum. The landscape presents an
undulating appearance with soil of a sandy loam nature, and a sub-
soil of clay, while certain flat areas are chiefly Bay of Biscay soil,
and quantities of limestone are in the ridges. In its natural state,
the land possesses certain fodders of the types of wallaby grass,
danthonias, a little semi-annularis, and silver grass. During the
first/ few years of occupation, the land was utilised solely for grazing
purposes, but after a time the soil was cultivated and wheat was
sown. Three crops were gathered, but results were not sufficiently
encouraging to warrant continuance with this grain, and oats were
therefore tried out, together with almost every grass that was con-
sidered likely to do well in the district. After much experimentation
it was proved by Mr. Shepherd that subterranean clover and Wim-
mera rye grass were the most suitable varieties of fodder for this
part of the State.
When the holding was first taken up, the land would carry a
little more than one sheep to two acres, but the capacity so quickly
increased that in 1913 a further 712 acres were purchased, and a
vigorous campaign of subterranean clover growing commenced.


■SYDNEY SHEPHERD Park," near Kybybolite
IT IS A VALUABLE AND WELL IMPROVED PROPERTY.
Every acre that had been ploughed and cropped for cereals was soon
sown with clover, and in 1917 another 712 acres of adjoining
land were added to the estate.
In 1920, 620 acres were bought, just over the Victorian border.
The entire property now runs 4,500 sheep, and produces 110 bales
of wool, representing an average clip of a little over 12 lbs. of wool
per sheep including weaners. The wool is generally about 64 s
quality, and at the sales the clip commands excellent prices.
Considerable success has been achieved with sheep that have
been exhibited at the Naracoorte shows, and a number of first and
second and Grand Champion prizes have been won. In 1926, Mr.
Sdrepherd gained Grand Champion for his exhibited merino ewe.
He maintains a small stud of merino sheep for his own flock require-
ments, and from time to time sells some of his surplus rams.
The stud was founded on "Moyhall” blood, but for the last seven
years the ' Wanganella’’ strain has been used almost exclusively.
Numbers of wethers are raised for sale as fats, and the sub-
terranean clover fields are utilised as grazing grounds to top them off
for market. Since the sowing of clover, the fat wethers have been
found to dress 1 5 lbs. heavier than previously.
T he “Mullinger Park” country is particularly free from disease
and other infections, and this has been an important factor in the
maintenance of high grade stock. A good type of Jersey milkers
is kept, the breeding of which has gone through five generations of
pure bred bulls.
There is not a man in the whole of the south-eastern district
who has experimented more extensively with subterranean clover


than has Mr. Shepherd, and at the present day he is generally recog-
nised as an authority on the subject of clover pastures. The
method he adopts in cultivation is as follows: Clover seed is sown
with a cover crop, principally oats, as oats is sown earlier than other
cereals which fact coincides with the requirements of clover. I hus
the seed is sown in April or early May, when the ground is warm.
Super is mixed in at the rate of 1 cwt. to the acre, with 2 lbs. of
clover seed. The sowing is shallow, about 1 inch below the surface
of the soil, and a light harrow, is run over to cover the seed. If
sowing is carried: out later in the year, it is preferable to sow on the
surface of the ground as the soil is not warm enough to effect germ-
ination at the right time of the year.
The clover comes up with the cover crop, and after the oats
has been cut the seed is naturally distributed. Hence, the stock
which are paddocked to eat off the crop do not destroy the seed and
plant. In the following spring the clover comes up as a natural
crop. The bulk of the clover seed will germinate next season
but some will not germinate for as long as three years,
owing to the varying thickness of the capsule covering
the seed. Broadcast supering is carried out in the proportion of
1 cwt. to the acre, heavy supering being essential to the establishing

of good clover crops. About the month of August the clover plant
dries off and on “Mullinger Park" the crop is raked, by means of
a raker patented by Mr. Shepherd, into heaps ready for threshing.
The clover is put through a threshing machine which separates the
seed pods .from the plant, and the pods are then winnowed to
remove the seed. The next process consists of passing the seed
through a huller to remove the seed pods. T he seed is then graded
and prepared for marketing.
Mr. Shepherd claims to be the first farmer in Australia to use
motor broadcasting of super. Before the introduction of this method
it usually occupied three men six weeks in supering the property,
Avhich consisted of 2,500 acres. At the present time two men and
a motor truck can do the work in ten days, thus effecting a tremendous
saving of time and labour.
The “Shepherd Superphosphate Broadcaster," which is now
used extensively in pastoral areas, was constructed and patented by
Mr. Shepherd in 1927, and is being placed on the market by Hor-
wood, Bagshaw Ltd. in South Australia, Victoria, and Western
Australia.
In addition to general farming pursuits, Mr. Shepherd has
planted 150 acres of pinus insignis, on land that was once) considered
worthless. This area was very sandy, and covered with bracken
fern. The pines now range up to four years of age, and are making
excellent headway.


PINE PLANTATION ON LAND THAT WAS ONCE CONSIDERED TO BE WORTHLESS.
Reclaiming of much of the Bay of Biscay (or crab-hole)
country in the Kybybolite district has been carried out by Mr.
Shepherd with success. A leveller, designed and made by the
owner of "Mullinger Park" was used for this purpose. Cinema
photographs of this machine in operation were recently taken for
publicity purposes by the Ronaldson-Tippett company.
Another indication of Mr. Shepherd’s industry is given by the
designing and construction of a double ended sheep drafting race
at “Mullinger Park." This race is so built that it may be adjusted
at any moment to draft from either end.
Proof that the estate is run on most modern and economic lines,
is shown by the fact that on two occasions Mr. Shepherd has won the
farm competition for the best worked farm in the Naracoorte and
surrounding districts. Each had to be won three times in succession..


P. A. LAURIE, "Eurinima"
FAT CATTLE GRAZING ON THE “EURINIMA” ESTATE.
This attractive property, which derives its name from Eurinima Swamp
(meaning in the aboriginal dialect "Runaway Hole”) is situated a mile south
of Kybybolite. It was taken up by Mr. P. A. Laurie and, his father, the late
Mr. J. P. D. Laurie, in 1906. Its present area is 2,200 acres.
Although portion' is devoted to agriculture the chief activity at “Eurinima”
is sheep, the type produced there being among the best in the South-East. The
land is undulating, comprising a sandy loam above a day subsoil. The natural
grasses are wallaby grass and native clovers. Most of it is cleared, groves of
redgums being! left for shade purposes. About 1,200 acres is regularly supercd
about 50 tons being used every year. The untreated land carries 3 sheep to 4 acres,
while the supered pastures support three sheep to the acre. Some of the paddocks
have maintained 10 sheep to the acr over limited periods. The figures give a
good idea of the possibilities of the South-East under a system of intense culture.
Mr. Laurie cultivates about 200 acres yearly with oats, chiefly for hay and
grain. Algerian have proved a reliable variety. The hay oats yield up to 2 tons
and grain returns are 1 about 30 bushels. Clover is sown with the\ oats so that
when the latter have been cut the clover follows on as an established pasture.
The flocks at “Eurinima” vary from 2,500 to 3,000, all pure merinos.
They were formed over 20 years ago from ewes secured from the estate of the
late Mr. Handyside, M.P.. of Bordertown. The rams came from the Keynes
estate at Keyneton, others being secured from Mr. J. A. Allen, of Wolseley. 'I he
result is a good robust type that thrives well and produces an excellent fleece.
The average clip per grown sheep is from 9 lb. to 10 lb., the wool being 64 s ro
70’s quality. The bales from “Eurinima” usually figure among the top prices
at the sales.
The rainfall average is 22 inches which is ample for all requirements.
Supplies for the stock are secured from bores, wells and natural catchments.
Inexhaustible supplies can be secured from a depth of 60 feet. Water requirements
for the homestead are cared for by a system of rainwater tanks.
Mr. Laurie stocks about 60 head of cattle for fattening for the market.
Usually he relies on the shorthorn type, with a few Jerseys for home dairy needs.
He has found subterranean clover to be excellent fodder for the, stock, and large
quantities of it are cut into hay. The country is particularly suited to the
development of subterranean clover and it also responds well to oats. Mr. Laurie
talks from experience when he says that top'dressing is absolutely necessary. As
a rule he broadcasts 1 cwt. to the acre with the result that the carrying capacity
in sheep is trebled, and sometimes even more than that.
The farm buildings at “Eurinima” are substantial, especially the woolshed
which is constructed of timber and galvanized iron and will accommodate 400
fully grown animals.
THE WOOLSHED IS LARGE AND WELL CONSTRUCTED.


THOMAS JAMES FERGUSON
"Baker's Range."
A SECTION OF BAKER’S RANGE SHOWING THICK SCRUB (left) AND CLEARED LAND (right) AFTER THE FIRST CROP.
Although not born in the South-East Mr. Thomas James
Ferguson, of "Baker’s Range," seven miles south of Lucindale, can
be classed among its agricultural pioneers. He was born at Clare
in 1883, and went to Furner about 42 years ago, where his father,
the late Mr. William Ferguson, embarked on farming and grazing
at "Gowan Brae." Mr. T. J. Ferguson remained at Furner for
21 years then took up his present holding of "Baker’s Range." At
that time it consisted of 12,000 acres, but it has since been increased
to 18,000 acres of grazing and agricultural country and scrub land.
Except for a stretch of grass country the property was almost
uncleared when Mr. Ferguson took it over, and in such a large area
it is natural that a considerable portion of scrub country should
still remain. Nevertheless, Mr. Ferguson has spent big sums in
land clearing, and he is convinced that there is a great future before
it when it is under subterranean clover.
The cost of clearing varies with the character of the land. In
his case, where the timber varies in size and density, the figure is
from £2 10/ to £4 per acre, covering all operations from the
land in its virgin state to the point where it is supered and sown
with clover.
Mr. Ferguson is acknowledged to be one of the pioneers of clover
growing on an extensive scale in the Lucindale district, and he has
done more scrub clearing than any other landholder in those parts.
For 15 years he cleared the land on a small scale, but since recent
developments in machinery a Vickers tractor has been brought into
operation and land is being opened up at a much greater rate.
Mr. Ferguson uses a 5-disc plough to get out the yacca, and then
employs a sundercut plow as a sort of scarifier.
In all about 500 acres have been cleared, 350 of them being
supered and sown with subterranean clover. Under these condi-
tions the land will carry from 2 to 4 sheep to the acre, whereas the
pure scrub will not support more than a sheep to each 10 acres.
The difference in carrying capacity between the treated country and
land in its natural condition is remarkable. The improvement is
from 2,000 to 4,000 per cent.
Mr. Ferguson shears about 3,000 sheep, the flock being pure
merinos. He uses rams form Bungaree, Wirra Wirra (S.A.),
Wanganella (N.S.W.), and other noted northern stud breeders. The
ewes are secured fro mother Southern-Eastern breeders. With such
good blood Mr. Ferguson has built up an excellent type of wool
cutter. The "Baker’s Range" fleece is a medium type of about 60’s
quality, grown sheep producing 9 to 9\ lb. As the land is further
cleared, this average should be raised. The cull lambs are generally
sold as stores. In a few years' time, when, as everybody hopes, market

and transport facilities will be improved, Mr. Ferguson proposes to
cross-breed for faf lamb production. The standard of the flock and
the capacity of the land give every promise of success.
Mr. Ferguson intends to go in for clover growing on an
•extensive scale. The experimental stages in connection with it
have already passed, Mr. Ferguson himself having done much in
this direction. At “Baker’s Range,” the clover is making wonderful
headway. He has also experimented with lucerne, and is satisfied
that it is a fodder of coming value in the south-east, especially as
good crops can be secured without recourse to irrigation.
The timbered land at “Baker’s Range” consists of red gum,
stringy bark, and hill gum. The lastnamed provides good fencing
posts. The scrub fences are posts 30 ft. apart with two iron droppers
in between, carrying five plain wires. On the cleared portions, the
fencing is posts with wooden battens, three plain wires, one top
barb, and 42-inch netting. All of it is rabbit proof.
The rainfall at “Baker’s Range” is 22 inches, water for the
home being supplied from underground and iron tanks. Ihe stock-
water, procured from wells 4 to 8 ft. deep, is pumped by mills to
the various paddocks. There are also good waterholes on the
property for stock. Mr. Ferguson keeps about 30 head of Herefords
and shorthorn cattle, mostly as a sideline. He also breeds a few fat
cattle.
The homestead at “Baker’s Range” is cheery with all modern
facilities, including electric light, and a broadcast receiver. On the
homestead portion there is a modern wool shed, garage, implement
sheds, men’s huts and other improvements.


ALEXANDER SACKVILLE KIDMAN
"Tarkeeth"
THE “TARKEETH” HOMESTEAD IS A NEW ONE BUILT IN AN ATTRACTIVE SETTING.
This property is typical of the best pastoral areas in the south-
east. "Tarkeeth" is the native name meaning “land of swamps”
which is a true description in a very wet season of this part of the
State. Mr. A. S. Kidman established “Tarkeeth” about 20 years
back when he took up 1,100 acres of the Hynam estate. Eight years
ago he built a home on adjoining land which had been purchased
from the Laurie Park” estate, and further acres being acquired, the
property now runs into 4.150 acres. The location is 13 miles
east of Naracoorte.
1 arkeeth ’ is a pastoral and agricultural proposition, most of
it being first class clover land. In its natural state it could run
two sheep to 3 acres, but with super and clover a little over two sheep
to the acre can be carried. Plenty of stock food is provided by the
native grasses, and supering has brought up many valuable varieties
of clover. About 300 acres of subterranean clover have been
established and it is doing well.
The sheep at “Tarkeeth” are a good type. They are pure
merinos, the flock being formed on stock secured from Mr. James
Allen, of "Dunalan,” near Wolseley. In recent years Mr. Kidman
has introduced some of the famous "Wanganella” blood, also 'Zara,'
from the Riverina. The muster at shearing is around 3,300. the
wool going a 64’s count. It is a good clean sample, some of the
best fleeces cut in the south-east in fact, and on several occasions the
top price at auction has been secured. The wool of the grown
flock averages a cut of 9 lb. per fleece, the lambs returning 3 lb.
“Tarkeeth” is remarkably good lamb-raising country, an 85 per
cent average being secured. Mr. Kidman keeps a few cattle for
general use.
The soil is mostly light loam, with a stiff clay subsoil, and the
country comprising the estate is undulating, presenting no difficult
working conditions. It is practically all cleared except for portions
of red gum and bull oak, which have been retained for stock shelter,
building timber and post supplies.
Statistics over a long period show an average annual rainfall
of 22 inches, a never failing water supply coming from natural dams
and bores. It is reticulated to all the paddocks.
“Tarkeeth" is particularly good for the raising of oats and in
suitable seasons it is capable of producing heavy crops of wheat.

"Tarkeeth"
THIS SWAMP, CLOSE TO THE "TARKEETH ” HOMESTEAD, IS A FEEDING GROUND FOR NATIVE BIRDS.
The homestead is a new one in the bungalow style and
is provided with all modern conveniences. So complete are these,
from electric light upwards, that living conditions compare more
than favorably with the best city homes where the opportunities to
instal modern household aids are so numerous compared with those
on isolated stations. The homestead surroundings also present a
pleasant picture, with attractive gardens, lawns and shrubs. Wind
brakes are provided by stately cypress pines and pinus insignis, and
a number of varieties of fruit and vines flourish.
The setting of the 'headquarters at "Tarkeeth” is further
enhanced by a large swamp close to the house which is a feeding
ground for native birds, wild duck and swans. An unusual sight is
presented at times when large flocks of native companions visit the
swamp.


HOMAGE LINDON MILES "Williup"
A GLIMPSE OF THE WILLIUP HOMESTEAD.
Although the "Williup” estate is regarded today as one of the
most economically conducted properties in its district, and is owned
by a particularly progressive type of farmer and grazier, yet, to have
seen the country in its early stages would have made one feel very
dubious about its possible development.
When Mr. H. L. Miles acquired 3,302 acres of land in the
Hynam district about 17 years ago, he had to face the serious
problem of making a paying proposition out of a large stretch of
heavy scrub country that would carry little more than a sheep to
four acres. 4 here was nothing in the way of improvement on
riny portion of his new property. During the first year of
occupation, Mr. Miles cleared 260 acres of scrub, using the now
obsolete method of power—a bullock team. This area was sown
with wheat, and for four consecutive years wheat crops were pro-
duced on the same land, a yield of 9 bags to the acre being obtained
in the last year. 4 his result is all the more remarkable by reason
of the season being one of the worst drought periods experienced
in South Australia. In the same year one of the "Williup”
paddocks grew up to four tons of hay per acre. These facts gave
a good indication of the capabilities of the property.
In 1914 a number of sheep were obtained from the estate of Mr.
Miles’ father, at Kaniva, Victoria, and during the severe drought
that afflicted that State, most of the Kaniva sheep were maintained
and saved on "Williup.”
About five years ago the first treatment of super was given the
land, and the first} seeding of subterranean clover carried out. In
the first season the carrying capacity jumped to one sheep to the acre,
an increase of between 300 and 400 per cent. Intense supering
and clover growing has not yet been attempted, and xvir. Miles
considers that the land in still capable of much greater development.
The first 25 acres of clover planted proved very successful. This
paddock, before treatment, would not carry 13 wethers for the
year, but as soon as the clover came up things became greatly changed.
As many as 150 lambs were maintained on the paddock for 3


HORACE LINDON MILES "WillW’
A FEATURE IS THE FLOWER GARDEN.
years! Before topdressing, one paddock cropped four bags of
wheat to the acre, but after super had been applied a yield of nine bags
was obtained. In the same way oats was increased from 24 bushels
to 45 bushels per acre. It is the intention of Mr. Miles to put
in a crop of barley this year, and it is his contention that this grain
will produce good results.
As a general rule 122 lbs. of super to the acre is used on the
crop fields, and from 60-90 lbs. per acre is broadcast on the pastures,
but the latter quantity was increased to 122 lbs. last season, when
better results were obtained.
If Mr. Miles’ judgment proves to be correct—and present
indications at least prove that he is on the right track,—then one
of the serious problems that face the people in the south-east will
shortly be solved. This is the question of eradicating bracken
fern. He has sown quantities of subterranean clover seed among
the bracken, and not only has the clover shown a better growth.
but the bracken is surely being thinned out. One paddock that was
previously quite useless for grazing sheep on account of the heavy
growth of bracken, is now carrying 3 sheep to the acre,—a result
of topdressing and sowing with subterranean clover. Of course,
the experimental stage has not yet been passed, but such progress
has so far been made that it is quite possible that Mr. Miles' scheme
will have far reaching results.
The soil in this part of the country is chiefly a red, sandy loam,
with a clay subsoil, and an intermediate layer of buckshot gravel,
The rainfall averages about 23 inches, and further water supplies are
obtained from bores, varying in depth from 24 to 40 feet. From
these sources windmills pump the water to troughs in every paddock,
Although the country is chiefly flat, it is well drained by means of
natural runaway holes.
During recent years a Holt caterpillar tractor has been utilised
in clearing the land. After the gums had been grubbed, there
was the arduous work of ploughing out and effectively removing
many acres of red gum shoots. The eradication of the red gum


SCRUB CLEARING AT “WILLIUP” IS DONE WITH A TRACTOR.
shoots is still another question that is requiring serious thought
in the south-east, but, again, in this instance, Mr. Miles has turned
his practical knowledge to good account. The first 140 acres were
cleared by means of fallowing with a five-furrow disc plow, and
then working back the soil with a sunder cut. After this treatment
it was found that the gum shoots did not reappear, and in the first
year following the clearing 2 sheep to the acre were maintained.
Although there still remains a portion of the “Williup” country
to be cleared, the estate today is vastly improved from its early
condition.
As a general rule about 3,200 sheep, of the pure merino type,
are shorn at "Williup.” They are pure “Wanganella” blood,
which has been maintained for 30 years, commencing in the first
instance on the Kaniva estate.
For the past three years the sheep have averaged over 9 lbs.
of wool per grown sheep, each season. The best type of wethers,
maintained on good lands, have averaged 14 lbs., 1,000 animals
actually producing this cut. The wool averages from 64’s to 70’s
quality, being of fine type, excellent character, and long staple. It
might be a suitable opportunity here to note the exact meaning of
the quality of wool. By “quality” is meant the texture of the
wool fibre, and this is judged by the number of hanks of yarn, each
hank being 560 yards in length, that can be obtained from a pound
of wool tops. For instance, wool produced by Mr. Miles’ flock.
of 64’s quality, indicates that 64 hanks can be made from one
pound weight of scoured wool. In the same way, 70’s quality
means that 70 hanks can be procured from one lb. of scoured wool.
These facts are probably not known by some wool growers. The
qualities of wool of the coarser types, from comebacks and cross-
bred sheep, range in 28’s, 32’s, 36’s, 40’s, 44's, 46’s, 50's, 56’s
and 58’s, while the pure merino types produce finer wool of 60’s,
64’s, 66’s, 70’s, 80’s, 90’s, 100's, and 120’s quality.
The "Williup” clip produced 86 bales of top line wool last
year from the wethers, and 34 bales of other sorts.
The sheep in this part of the country are quite free from
parasites and disease, chiefly because the land is kept very clean.
The general fodder is now principally subterranean clover, but there
aie still some of the native grasses growing on untreated sections.
One paddock of 140 acres, in natural grass, carried 1,600 wethers
for three months, after being top dressed. After taking off the
wethers, 200 breeding ewes were placed in the paddock and lambed
there the following year.
The "Williup” homestead possesses a rare feature—a very
fine flower garden—producing some excellent types of flowers, the
culture of which Mr. Miles makes a hobby. As a whole, the
estate may be classed as a typical example of what can be achieved
on good land by a man who has the courage of his convictions—
a vivid indication of an ideal pastoral home.


MODERN METHODS HAVE GREATLY IMPROVED THIS PROPERTY.

WILLIAM WALTER STAUDE
"Avonside"
A PRETTY VIEW OF “AVONSIDE” HOMESTEAD.
I he owner of “Avonside,” Mr. William Walter Staude, is
admitted to be one of the most competent graziers in the south-east,
and his property which lies 7 miles east of Naracoorte is a model
of efficiency. In the hands of enterprising farmers, the south-east
gives wonderful returns and when its possibilities are better realised
there should be a rush to acquire land in these rich areas.
Mr. Staude s property is part of the old Hynam estate and
was taken up by him about 5 years ago. The portion acquired was
500 acres of the homestead portion, and another 1,000 acres was
secured about 7 miles further east. It is all good grazing land, some of
it being well suited to agriculture. It is a type of country that
would be considered a farmer’s paradise by Scandinavians and others
in the higher latitudes of Europe who are compelled to till every
inch of the soil. Only small portions of the south-east are actually
cultivated and the returns in every case are phenomenal.
The homestead section of the Hynam estate which Mr. Staude
bought has all been cropped at different times and its value and
quality can be estimated by the fact that it is assessed at a higher
figure than any other land in the Hynam district. Its carrying
capacity when Mr. Staude took charge was three-quarters of a sheep
to the acre. It now carries 2 and 3 sheep to the acre, that is with
clover put in two years ago.


WILLIAM WALTER STAUOE
" A von.sidc"
THE PROPERTY WAS ONCE PORTION OF HYNAM ESTATE.
The auxiliary property seven miles away is at present supporting
three-quarters of a sheep to the acre in its natural state. This is
a good figure for virgin land, and the returns will be vastly improved
after the pastures have been supered. There is some redgum timber
on it which is used for stock shelter and at various times about 300
acres have been put under crop with good results.
Mr. Staude shears 1,800 sheep, all pure merinos, and he has
a stud for his own breeding purposes, also for the sale of sheep,
which are eagerly sought. This stud was formed on Stirling blood
from Nairne (S.A.), the basis being a few good rams. Other
rams, also ewes, were secured from Hayes Bros., near Nairne. The
sheep bred from them have proved great doers in the south-eastern
country. Grown sheep, including weaners. return the excellent
figure of 1 H lb. to 1 2 lb. per fleece. The wool is of 64’s quality.,
strong, with a fairly long staple and good in character. This
return is not surprising as the sheep are recognised to be some of the
best type in the district and on most occasions when they are marketed
both auctioneers and buyers compliment Mr. Staude on their appear-
ance. The prices returned by both sheep and wool have invariably
been among the top for the district.
Plenty of food grows on “Avonside.” Contrary to general
practise, Mr. Staude does not move his sheep off the property, but


THE PURE BRED MERINOS AT “AVONSIDE" ARE HEAVY WOOL CUTTERS.
often changes them from one paddock to another so that the clover
has a chance to freshen up. To carry out this policy, Mr. Staude
has to maintain a strict eye on the flocks and he keeps them always
in a healthy state. Moreover, the rabbits are not allowed to obtain
a footing in the paddocks.
The woolshed can accomodate 300 sheep and there is an auxi-
liary shed that can deal with a further 200. The outbuildings on
the property, such as stables, implement house, chaff shed, wool
shed, garage, etc. are substantial.
The homestead portion of the estate is undulating, the soil
being a red loam resting on a clay subsoil. The rainfall is 22 to
23 inches a year and the water supply is secure from bores which
keep the dams filled in the sheep paddocks.
Mr. Staude has “Avonside" well fenced with four wires and a
barb. On the outside boundaries three plain wires and a barb are
used, all fences being proofed against rabbits.
At present 350 of the 500 acres at “Avonside" are under
subterranean clover and Mr. Staude intends to put in more of it.
The remaining 150 acres arc grazed.
The homestead is of fine appearance and is surrounded by an
attractive flower garden. Pines, sugar gums and cypresses add
further adornment. The flowers grow luxuriously, all varieties
doing well, and in spring and summer the gardens provide a riot of
colour. A few fruit trees also thrive on the property.


GEORGE WILLIAM LANGBERG
"Oakdale. "
THE RESIDENCE, SHOWING OUTBUILDINGS
An excellent example of what can be done on scrubland with-
out big financial resources is provided by Mr. George William Lang-
berg at “Oakdale," about four miles south of Lucindale. He
established the property in 1913 taking up 450 acres of freehold
as the homestead portion. The land was in its natural state,
covered with shea-oak, ti-tree, bluegum, apple gum and redgum.
Yacca flourished on it and very little natural grass was observable
anywhere. In those days it was hardly capable of carrying a
sheep. The soil was good red loam, with limestone on the
ridges, and gave every promise of responding to treatment.
Mr. Langberg started by felling the trees, ringbarking, and
clearing off the scrub. He grubbed the yacca, and after thorough
preparation secured a return of 24 bushels to the acre from his first
sowing. Super was used extensively and gradually the land
became a good payable proposition. On the homestead area 400
acres have now been cleared and ploughed.
About 1915 the holding was increased by 3,000 acres, four
miles west of the homestead; 600 acres of it being covered with
rushes and cutting grasses in summer, and flooded during the winter.
Mr. Langberg built stop banks and drains, cleared the land, and
ploughed the cutting grass. The butts were ploughed out with
the disc and left all summer to dry off, when they were burnt.
After cultivation very heavy strawed crops were raised averaging at
least 10 bags to the acre, all good sample grain. The 600 acres
have since been fenced in against vermin. Mangels, rape, and
turnips are now being substituted for the wheat and are doing well.
Wimmera rye grass, English rye, strawberry clover, and in
parts subterranean clover are giving good stock feed on the home-
stead division. The treated areas support about 1,200 sheep,
sections of it carrying a couple to the acre with ease. The sheep
are merinos possessing a good fleece of about 60’s quality. Includ-
ing lambs the cut goes a little over 9 lb. a sheep.
The feeding of the sheep at “Oakdale” is given special atten-
tion. From 100 to 150 bags of oats are grown for the purpose
of hand feeding during the winter. The sheep are worked in
mobs of 200, and these are worked in rotation, each mob being fed
for three weeks on oats, receiving an average of a pound each per day.
Mr. Langberg has steadily improved “Oakdale. ” Rain-
water tanks supply the home and windmills pump water for the
stock. Practically all the homestead portion is rabbit proof
fenced.
The homestead is of a substantial type with a pretty flower
garden and plots for vegetables and fruit. A couple of 1 2 feet
wells operated by windmills give a good water supply for garden
purposes. The outbuildings include an implement shed, garage
and men’s hut. The home is lighted throughout with a Ronaldson-
Tippett electric lighting plant, and wires are also carried to the out-
buildings.
Most of the work on the farm is done by means of
a McCormick-Deering 10-20 tractor. On virgin country, Mr.
Langberg has, by his enterprise, created a first-class property in every
respect.


CORNELIUS A. MALONE
“Laurie Park"
THE HOMESTEAD AT "LAURIE PARK” IS PICTURESQUELY SET ON RISING GROUND.
Mr. C. A. Malone, the proprietor of “Laurie Park,” a well-
known estate in the Naracoorte district, can speak from long experi-
ence regarding the South-East.
He has born at Mount Barker in 1870, and has lived all his
life on the land. Mr. Malone is the second son of the late
Mr. Martin Malone, of Millicent, and was educated at Mount
Gambier and Millicent. On the termination of his studies he
first spent some time on his father’s farm gaining a good general
knowledge of the agricultural industry. Subsequently Mr. Malone
was engaged for five years under Professor Lowrie, then principal
of Roseworthy, in the working of an experimental farm at Millicent.
The idea was to demonstrate the value of the artificial manures most
suitable to the district, and the success of Mr. Malone's experiments
whilst engaged in this work proved a valuable object to the farmers
of the district, who have benefited immensely since fertilisers were
introduced. Artificial manuring is now general in that part of the
country. Prior to the establishment of the experimental farm,
fertilisers were practically unknown, the average crop being 4 or 5
bags to the acre. To-day 12 to 15 bags are taken off every year,
and land values have increased from £ 5 or £ 6 an acre up to £2O
and £25 per acre. It is also interesting to note that Mr. Malone
used the first seed drill seen in the district.
In addition to his farming activities Mr. Malone found time
to render service on public bodies. For a number of years he held
office as chairman and councillor in the Mount Muirhead and
Millicent district councils, also as president of the local agricultural
society, and committeeman of the Millicent Racing Club. In 1910
Mr. Malone was tempted by the rapid increase in land values, and
sold his Millicent holding, purchasing “Glen Roy.” From “Glen
Roy” he moved to “White Park,” a fine property on the Bordertown
road about 18 miles from Naracoorte. Mr. Malone spent a lot of
money in improvements and eventually sold the holding, purchasing


CORNELIUS A. MALONE
"Laurie Park"
"Binnum House. A little while ago he acquired "Laurie Park,"
a tract of 3,700 acres of agricultural and pastoral land about 8 miles
south-east of Hynam and 1 8 miles from Naracoorte. Mr. Malone
also has a further large area of 12,000 acres of grazing land at
"Beeamma” in conjunction with his son, Ivan.
From the foregoing it will be realised that he has an extensive
knowledge of the lands in the south-east and a firm faith in the
future of the district generally.
Mr. Malone runs 3,000 pure-bred merinos at "Laurie Park" and
2,000 on the "Beeamma" property. The latter spreads over differ-
ent sections and the soil varies in quality, some of it being exceedingly
good. In its uncleared parts "Beeamma" is heavily timbered with
red and white gum and stringybark. Some of the land has been
top-dressed with super and 500 acres have been sown with clover.
In addition, about 1,500 acres have been ringbarked. In its
present state "Beeamma” runs a sheep to about 5 acres, but with
supercd pastures the carrying capacity will be at least doubled.
On the homestead portion at "Laurie Park" a sheep to the acre
is the average. When top-dressing is carried out this can be greatly
increased.
About 2,000 of the sheep went with the estate when Mr.
Malone purchased it. the animals being a good type bred by Mr.
Sidney Kidman at "Limestone Ridge." The wool is about a 64’s
count and individual sheep will cut up to 9 lb. Last season, no
fewer than 5,500 sheep were put through the shearing sheds. As
a rule a thousand or more lambs are maintained each season. The
figures show that there are great potentialities in "Laurie Park" and
"Beeamma." Subterranean clover will be grown extensively when
the estate is more in working order.
Mr. Malone is very progressive with improvements and is a
staunch believer in subterranean clover. About half of "Binnum,"
which was formerly owned by him, is under clover and the present
owner, Mr. G. G. Legoe, has a fine estate to work on. "Binnum"
had not been treated with supers for pasturage when Mr. Malone
took it over and during his time there the carrying capacity was more
than doubled. By adopting similar methods at "Laurie Park’’ Mr.
Malone will establish an exceptionally valuable property. The
estate is admited to be one of the finest in the district, possessing
many natural facilities such as water and shelter.
The soil is chocolate and sandy loam with a clay subsoil.
Water is obtained from bores and one or two wells, and is laid on to
all parts of the property. The average rainfall is 22 inches. The
building improvements include a large wool shed that can accom-
modate about 800 sheep, four stands being provided for shearers. The
homestead is very attractive in its setting of trees and flower gardens.
About 300 acres of "Laurie Park" are put into cultivation,
principally with wheat, oats also being sown. The wheat returns
average Bto 10 bags to the acre. Mr. Malone maintains a small
herd of shorthorn milkers for station use, and he has good teams of
draught horses and hacks.
Mr. Malone was married in 1903 to the eldest daughter of the
late Mr. Michael White, of "Emerald," Millicent, and has three
children —Mr. Ivan, Miss Kathleen and Master White Malone. Mr.
Ivan Malone has an interest in and manages "Laurie Park."


WALTER FRANCIS STAUDE
“Taronga"
MR. WALTER F. STAUDE'S HOMESTEAD , “TARONGA."
This is an excellent property situated about 3 miles south
of Hynam, Mr. Walter Francis Staude took it up 10 years ago,
and his successful working of the place since has further served
to demonstrate what an asset to the State mixed farming in the
South-East offers.
“Taronga” covers 1,040 acres of agricultural and pastoral
land. It is slightly undulating and practically all of it is cleared.
Mr. Staude crops about 100 acres each season with wheat and
oats for hay and grain. Before starting on super and planting
subterranean clover, Mr. Staude averaged 5 to 6 bags to the acre.
That in itself would be counted moderate to good in the North,
but since the old clover paddocks have been put under the plough
40 bushels to the acre has been the result. The hay cuts average
two tons.
The natural grasses at “Taronga” are principally wallaby
grass and native clover. Subterranean clover also grows luxuriantly
and in parts there is English rye grass. With a plentiful supply
of herbage Mr. Staude is able to carry a fine flock of sheep. In
its natural state the property would support about 700, but 300
to 400 acres of it have been top dressed and the soil has responded
so well that 1,800 sheep now go through the shearing sheds every
season, including lambs. They are all pure merinos founded on a
Deniliquin strain, but Mr. Staude is now working on Messrs.
J. and A. Hayes’ “Harrogate” blood.
All the grown sheep average from 11 to 12 lb. of wool, of a
60-64’s count. Mr. Staude has exhibited fleeces at the Naracoorte
show and won the first prize for merino fleece wool from two
4-tooth ewes which cut 14 lb. each. A couple of wethers exhibited
in 1928 cut 20 lb. of wool each. In the peak years the wool from
“Taronga” fetched as high as 42d.
As a rule the merinos are large framed and at shearing time
there is a good demand for the “Taronga” fat sheep. The main
point in selecting sheep for “Taronga” has been strong constitution
and bold appearance. These qualities are maintained by rigorous
annual culling and by keeping the country perfectly clean. Mr.
Stude thus ensures plenty of feed and healthy conditions for his
sheep until they are a couple of years old. Generally speaking they
are free from disease, but he gives certain treatment to prevent any
stray germs from troubling the flocks.
Mr. Staude’s ability as a flockmaster is shown by a splendid
cup won in a competition organised by the Naracoorte and Kyby-
bolite branches of the Agricultural Bureau. This was competed for
throughout the districts for the best flock of merino sheep on the
farm, covering a period of three years.
A never-failing source of water is available through bores and
dams. The natural fall is in the region of 22 inches a year. Mr.
Staude has interested himself in fruitgrowing and has an attractive
orchard, mostly of apples and peaches, which do very well. The
fruit is not marketed, all being required for home use. He is
satisfied, however, that there are possibilities for fruit culture in the
South-East.


"NANGWARRY," near Penola
(R. W. Gardner, Manager)
THE HOMESTEAD AND GARDEN, “NANGWARRY."
“Nangwarry,” a station holding fourteen miles south-east
of Penola, is a great producer of wool. The property covers the
large area of 12,000 acres, about 4,000 acres of which have been
topdressed.
The flocks at “Nangwarry” range from 8,000 to 10,000,
all Corricdales, producing wool of a 56-60’s count. The
management of the estate is under the control of Mr.
Robert W. Gardiner who has spent all his life in the South-East.
The estate was taken up by the late Capt. Gardiner in the early 70's
and is now in the hands of the widow of the late Mr. Abraham
Gardiner and her family.
“Nangwarry” is typical South-Eastern country, undulating in
character, the uncleared portion being timbered with redgums. After
clearing, a rich red loamy soil with clay subsoil is revealed, and
up to 700 acres have been sown with subterranean clover. The
average cultivation of the latter is now about 500 acres, excellent
returns being secured.
The rainfall is around the 26 inch mark and water is available
from wells and bores. An unfailing supply is secured at a depth
of 25 feet.
In addition to its large number of sheep “Nangwarry” main-
tains a herd of about 300 Hereford cattle which are sold for fattening
purposes. The subterranean clover has proved a splendid stock
feed, in addition to which “Nangwarry” carries plenty of natural
grasses. I'hc property is well known through South Australia and
there is always a keen demand for its wool at the sales.

SYDNEY N. KIDMAN
"Limestone Midge."
THE HOMESTEAD AND ITS SURROUNDINGS AT "LIMESTONE RIDGE."
One of the many men who can claim to know the capabilities
of the south-east is Mr. Sidney N. Kidman, who purchased the
‘Limestone Ridge” estate in November, 1928. This is one of the
oldest properties in the district, and is located 14 miles north of
Penola, and 17 miles south of Naracoorte, portion of the holding
being in the former district, and portion in the latter. The, home-
stead stands within a few yards of the main Penola-Naracoorte road,
and is only three miles from the Glenroy railway siding, so that
transport of stock and personal travelling do not present any difficul-
ties.
Prior to his acquiring “Limestone Ridge,” Mr. S. N. Kidman
owned "Laurie Park,” an estate near Hynam, which in now being
worked by Mr. C. A. Malone and it was there that he gained much
of his experience in the pastoral industry.
“Limestone Ridge’’ comprises 6.7*50 acres of good
pastoral land, of which 3,000 acres is mostly flat,
cleared country, and 3,750 acres still remain in its natural
scrub condition. Portions of the property have previously been
cultivated, but these areas are now being devoted to sheep grazing.
At the present time about 4,000 pure merinos are being, maintained,
averaging 2 sheep to 3 acres on untreated country, and a sheep to the
acre on the plain lands. None of the estate has yet been topdressed,
but Mr. Kidman proposes carrying out extensive supering and sub-

As is the case throughout most portions of the
South-East, the rainfall leaves nothing to be desired m the
Limestone R.dge locality, 25 mebes being an average annual
recording. All parts of the state are supplied with water for stock
and other purposes from natural springs, and from windmills which
pump water from a depth of 7 feet from the surface.
Natural grasses and fodders in the form of root grasses, cabbage
weed, clovers, and dandelion, growing abundantly are the principal
sustenance of the stock. All the plain country is fenced with wire
netting, rabbit proof, and the remainder of the estate is sheep
proofed with post and wire fences. Ihe soil varies from heavy
black on the flat portions, to red, sandy loam on rising ground, with
a good clay subsoil under all. Natural timbers are fairly thick, and
consist of red and blue gums and stringy bark.

HAROLD B. H. RICHARDSON
"Pyrus" Orchards and Vineyards
A MAGNIFICENT VIEW OF PORTION OF THE ORCHARDS.
The 'Pyrus" orchards and vineyards are situated in a
picturesque spot six miles north of Penola. It was in about 1892,
when the Renmark boom was on and fruit settlement schemes were
popular along the river Murray, that Mr. John Riddoch, the owner
of Yallum Estate, near Penola, decided to open up that portion of the
country for fruitgrowing and closer settlement generally. The land
was admirably adapted for the purpose, and there was a good demand
for ,t. At first the settlement was known as the Penola Fruit
Colony, but eventually it was des.gnated Coonawarra.
The late Mr. Henry Richardson, who founded the firm of H.
& H. B. Richardson, was at that time engaged in business pursuits
in Adelaide, and was greatly interested in the possibilities of fruit-
growing. His attention was directed to the south-east as being a
better proposition than the Murray Valley, one of the deciding
factors being the assured rainfall in the south-east, whereas costly
irrigation systems were necessary along the river. I hree ten-acre
blocks were taken up at the start and the prospects were so promising
that the area was considerably increased before many years had
passed. The hardest work was clearing the land of the big red
gums with which it was covered. These operations were costly,
in some cases so heavy that they more than doubled the value of the
land, which was originally £ 10 per acre.
Al , the hold , W as subsol i ed and a considerable area was
planted with apples, pears, apricots, prunes and Shiraz vines. The
advice of experts was obtained as to the most suitable varieties to
plant, as there was no local data to show what selection should
be made. Owing to the unusual variations in the nature of the
soil, including limestone rubble, red loam, and even down to a stiff
sand, it was inevitable that mistakes in planting should occur. In
particular, apples were placed in unsuitable spots. Experience

proved a good teacher, however, and settlers who came later had
the advantage of avoiding the pitfalls into which the pioneers
were led.
In the early history of the estate the late Mr. Henry Richardson
employed a manager to supervise his affairs, but retiring from city
life in 1896 he personally took over the management and a few
years later was joined by his son, Mr. H. B. Richardson, who had
graduated at Roseworthy College. His expert advice proved of the
greatest assistance. Owing to the moist climatic conditions in the
South-East the trees took a good deal longer to come into bearing
than in other places, thus the pioneers had a severe struggle to make
ends meet. As the apple trees came into production (codlin moth
and fusicladium being then unknown in the district), attention was
devoted to the export trade. The fruit was sent to Great Britain,
and for many years splendid returns were secured. In those days
there was not the large export business that has been developed
now, and the overseas market was particularly profitable.
The crop from the apricots and prunes was dried, a policy that
continues to the present day, but the pears were mostly consigned
to the city canning factories. During the last few years the pears
have also been dried with satisfactory results.
Under agreement was the original settlers the Riddoch estate
erected a large winery and here the Shiraz and Carbenet grapes were
crushed, Claret and Burgundy being produced in considerable
quantities. Some very fine wines were made from the locally
grown grapes by Mr. Salter, the original manager of the cellars.
In the opinion of experts they closely resembled the French vintages
of the same class. The grapes products of the South-East were
for many years sold to the local winery, which in the meantime
had changed hands, but in 1922 the firm (with which Mr. H. B. H.


FRUIT DRYING TRAYS AND OUTBUILDINGS AT “PYRUS.”
Richardson was now associated as a partner) purchased land and
erected a winery capable of holding 40,000 gallons. Owing to
the death of Mr. Henry Richardson, which occurred in 1924, the
present owner disposed of his vintage to Messrs. Milne & Co., who
previous to this had erected a very fine distillery. Crushing opera-
tions will be resumed at their local cellars this year.
In recent years the ‘Pyrus’’ orchards and vineyards have
increased considerably, attention being devoted to sheepraising.
About 60 acres is now applied to orchards, 50 to vineyards, and
the remainder depastures some 700 sheep. Merino sheep are con-
sidered most suitable for the lighter class of country, which is
heavily topdressed with mineral super, and a considerable area
devoted to subterranean clover, which flourishes on the sandy loam.
The larger portion of the orchard is devoted to the growing
of apples,, the principal varieties being Cleopatra, Jonathan, Dunn’s
Seedling, and Rome Beauty. Several acres of inferior varieties
have been grafted to a variety that has now come into popular
favour and proved itself in this district, viz., Granny Smith. In
the apricot section the principal varieties are Oullin’s Early, but
mostly Moorpark.
The prunes consist of the old varieties of Petite Prune De Agen,
Italian Prune (Fellemburg), and Coe’s Golden Drop. Some of
the newer sorts, Splendour and Prune De Agen, are grown.
In the pear line the Bartlett (locally known as Duchess) is
the principal variety grown. Lemons also do splendidly, and
where irrigation is practised big returns are realised. The usual
methods of cultivation are adopted—two ploughings and several
cultivations.
Owing to the South-Eastern drainage system, which has tapped
the local springs to the extent of two feet, the fruit trees are not
standing up to it as previously. The rainfall conditions during
the past few years are also below the average of 25 inches. Heavy
manuring has not been practised on orchard land, but vines have
been liberally treated. This practise has now been discontinued
owing to the rampant growth of the vines which is detrimental
in a late district.
Fruit crops vary according to the land on which they arc
placed, but heavy crops of apricots have been realised on the red
limestony soil, and as much as 8 tons to the acre of grapes. In
the opinion of Mr. Richardson there are big possibilities for closer
settlement on the lands adjoining the north of Coonawarra.


"GLEN BOY”
(Bertram James Magarey, Manager)
THE “GLEN ROY” HOMESTEAD.
“Glen Roy," which lies 11 miles north of Penola, was one of
the earliest settlements in the South-East. It was founded by the
late Mr. G. Cameron. The property was taken over in 1912 by
Mr. James William Magarey, father of the present manager, the
area being about 3,000 acres. It is chiefly pastoral country, all
flat, timbered with red gum, the greater portion of which has been
ringbarked. The holding is the homestead portion of the old
“Glen Roy” Station, and most of it has been cleared for grazing.
The soil is heavy black, varying to a light loam, the principal
herbage being native root grasses and clovers. In some parts
subterranean clover and English rye grass has been sown. Portion
of the estate is cultivated for the production of hay, wheat and oats
being sown, and the hay yield goes about two tons to the acre.
AR the conditions are therefore favourable for maintaining a good
class of sheep, and the land in its natural state will support three
sheep to four acres.
About 2,300 sheep are sheared annually at “Glen Roy." Mr.
Magarey has built up the flock by introducing and breeding from
the big framed northern animals. After these northern sheep have
been in the south-east for a period their wool fines down, the
wool at “Glen Roy" going 64’s quality, and averaging 10 lb.
a grown, sheep. They are all pure merinos. To prevent trouble
from blow-fly the crutching is carried out most carefully, and Mr.
Magarey is a believer in not overstocking. This policy means that
the “Glen Roy" sheep are able to feed well and maintain good
health.
The lambing is divided between Autumn and Spring, the
results varying somewhat. Some prefer Spring lambing and others
regard Autumn as the best. One point worth noting is that lamb-
ing in May will give wool when shearing in October, whereas
Spring lambs will give little or no fleece, but there is less mortality
among the lambs born in Springtime after the cold winter months
which are often severe in the South-East.
The rainfall at “Glen Roy” is about 24 inches, plentiful sup-
plies of water being secured from wells and bores at a depth never
exceeding 20 feet. In addition to sheep Mr. Magarey breeds a few
beef shorthorns, about 30 head being maintained, and a few are
milked for home use.
“Glen Roy" is well equipped with improvements in the shape
of a solidly-built residence, a wool shed capable of accommodating
400 sheep, men’s hut, stables, etc.


WILLIAM ALFRED CLIFFORD "YALLUM HOUSE”
Mr. W. A. Clifford took up the homestead section of “Yallum
House," with its wonderful old residence, in 1914. Its history
goes back a good many years before that. As a matter of fact,
ancient records show that, in 1845, Solomon, Josiah and Thomas
Austin stocked "Yallum" with progeny of Spanish and German
merinos. The pastoral industry of the south-east may, therefore,
be considered to begin with the attempts to raise sheep on the
"Yallum" estate, which lies five miles east of Penola.
The Wells family were later occupiers, and in 1861 the late Mr.
John Riddoch- one of South Australia’s best known pastoralists
and legislators, became the owner- For many years he was known
as the "Squire of Penola " In 1905 after Mr. Riddoch's death,
a portion of the large station was sold to the government for closer
settlement. Later on, Mr. Clifford acquired the homestead and
about 3,000 acres of rich soil, from the trustees of the Riddoch estate.
Mr. Clifford's grandfather, the late Mr. Mathew Clifford, was
one of the pioneers of Mount Barker and was the first farmer to
use large harvesting machinery in that district. An early demise
ended a promising career. The late Mr. Thomas Clifford, father
of Mr. W. A. Clifford went to the South-East when the ; Millicent
drainage area was thrown open for selection, and eventually acquired
large pastoral interests in the Millicent and Beachport districts.
When Mr. W. A. Clifford became proprietor of “Yallum” he
carried on the tradition of devoting a considerable area of it to
agriculture, farming up to 500 acres a year. This is a large
area for the heavy lands in the South-East, and finding
that sheep were more advantageous, Mr. Clifford decided to con-
centrate his activities on them.


"Where Gordon "Wrote Many Poems
To ensure good pasturage, Mr. Clifford topdressed all the land
and an abundance of clovers have been since maintained, chiefly of
the strawberry type. English rye grass also thrives. The top-
dressing is applied once in every three years, 80 to 90 lb. of super
being used to the acre. The portions carrying subterranean clover
are treated with super every year. The strawberry clover and rye
grass do well on the black soil plains and Scotch thistle has likewise
proved an excellent green fodder for sheep during the summer. The
subterranean clover grows better on the lighter sandy country on
the fringe of the black soil. An average of a sheep to the acre is
maintained throughout the estate, the black soil carrying 11 to the
acre.
The sheep from “Yallum” have always borne an excellent
reputation. In the days of the Riddochs, the flocks were small,
but select. Mr. Clifford has maintained the reputation for quality.
He secured his flock ewes from Victoria and went to the northern
stations for the rams. The big-framed rams from the north of this
State have proved of the greatest value in building up the flocks in
the south-east. The wool quality goes 60’s to 64’s and from
grown sheep the cut averages about 10 lb. a head. They are a
hardy type and good doers. The country is so clean that the health
of the sheep never causes the slightest anxiety, and there has never
been any need for treatment to guard against disease of any descrip-
tion.
The lambing at “Yallum Park” goes from 75 per cent to
80 per cent. Each year about 3,000 sheep pass across the shearing
boards, and a number that are sold as stores always bring good
prices. The woolshed will hold 800 grown sheep and there are


pens for 16 shearers. The men’s rooms, overseer’s cottage and
stables etc. are all solid structures.
The rainfall averages about 27 inches a year. This natural
supply is augmented by a number of springs which feed shallow
quarries. This is excellent water, quite satisfactory for domestic
purposes, and the supply is permanent. Windmills lift the water
for garden and orchard purposes, which is secured from a bore.
Apart from its worth as a grazing country, “Yallum Park”
possesses one of the finest and most historic homesteads in South
Australia. It is a large mansion built of stone and set off by

balconies and verandahs, the rooms being so big that several of them
give a greater floorage space than can be found in the whole of many
a modern suburban bungalow. They are wonderfully well
designed giving ample scope for beauty in furnishing. The present
King, during his first visit to Australia, stayed at "Yallum” and
the Duke of Clarence was also a distinguished visitor.
It. is also interesting to know that Adam Lindsay Gordon was
a frequent visitor and wrote a number of his best known poems
while staying there. Gordon was a colleague of John Riddoch
in the Legislature and there was a warm attachment between the
two. The poet delighted in the south-eastern atmosphere and com-
posed many a verse beneath a gnarled old gum adjacent to the
mansion. All these associations have invested the homestead with
a tradition which is cherished by the present possessor of the estate.
The garden surrounding the homestead is one of the show spots
of the south-east. The house is approached by a beautiful drive
through park-like country. The garden covers eight acres filled
with shrubs, hedges and ornamental trees. Fruit and nut trees
also abound. Many of these trees are extremely old and were
originally brought to South Australia from foreign countries.
Pinus insignis grows very well on the estate and it is possible
that the commercial forests that have been established in the district
owe their origin to the “Yallum” plantations. Long before the
government plantations were begun, photographs were taken of the
“Yallum” trees the circulation of which aroused great interest in
the possibilities of afforestation. About 10 years ago, Mr. Clifford
cut pinus insignis to the value of ■£ 2,000 off the estate, the timber
being trucked to Adelaide. The plantations at "Yallum” exceed
50 acres.

FREDERICK JOHN KIDMAN
"Dungarven"
SHOWING THE DELIGHTFUL SITUATION OF THE HOMESTEAD AT “DUNGARVEN.”
The sheep from “Dungarven," Mr. F. J. Kidman's estate
situated about 2\ miles west of Penola, enjoy an excellent reputation
through out the South-East. Mr. Kidman has spent a lot of time
and money in establishing a flock of first-class wool cutters, the
results of which arc to be seen in numerous showring trophies, and
Tecord prices at the wool sales.
Mr. Kidman settled at “Dungarven" in 1912, the area then
being 740 acres, all pastoral. The holding today is 920 acres
•of freehold and 1,500 acres of perpetual lease. About 250 acres are
ploughed and sown with grasses and clovers. The territory is flat to
slightly undulating, the topsoil being the heavy, dark and rich loam
for which the South-East is famous. This goes down 3 feet in many
parts and rests on a gravel subssoil.
The rainfall in the district is substantial, averaging between 25
and 26 inches. Water is secured at a shallow depth from bores
and windmills, and is reticulated to every paddock, of which there
are twelve. About 500 acres are wirenetted and the remainder of
the fencing is all sheepproof.
1 he native grasses at “Dungarven” are clovers, burr clover,
barley grass, wild rye grass, wild oats, etc. All the land will grow
strawberry clover, rye grass and subterranean clover. Mr. Kidman
was one of the first in the district to grow subterranean clover, and
a paddock of it that he sowed 1 5 years ago still has a good coating
of clover.
Each year about 300 acres of the pastures are topdressed. Mr.
Kidman has done a lot of experimenting with different grasses and
the best method of top dressing.
On the rising ground at ‘ Dungarven’' some very rich crops have
been grown, especially of barley and oats. Mr. Kidman has
harvested over 50 bushels of barley to the acre, and from seven
acres of oats he cut 30 tons of hay.
The merino stud at “Dungarven" is founded on Murray and
Canowie blood. The ram secured from the latter was sired by
the famous stud ram “Donald Dinnie." Mr. Kidman has crossed
the ewes with a Collins ram from the Lamara stud which was by
Charles 11., another well-known stud ram. Other ewes were
obtained from Highland Valley. Crossing "these ewes and Tams,
has produced a good type of commercial sheep.


FKEOEKICK JOHN KIDMAN
"Dungarvcn"
Sheep from “Dungarven ' have taken prizes at all the South-
Eastern shows. An outstanding success was the winning of the
Richardson Cup at Mount Gambier. This trophy, presented by
Mr. Richardson of Woodchester, was for a group of three rams
and three ewes and had to be won by the same owner three times.
Mr. Kidman’s group scored three years in succession—l92o, 1921.
and 1922.
He also won the championship in 1921 at Naracoorte,
Penola, and Mount Gambier for merino ewe. At each show a
different ewe was exhibited. At Naracoorte, in 1921, Mr. Kidman
secured the grand championship for ewe, and he was the exhibitor of
the champion merino ram at Mount Gambier in 1920.
Wool from "Dungarven” is generally found amongst the top
prices in the Penola district. In 1924 Mr. Kidman recorded the
highest price at auction when the whole clip averaged 37{d., exclud-
ing locks. With the latter it brought 35id.

Mr. Kidman is interested in racing thoroughbreds and has
Bonny Deen by Burrabadeen from Sea Wall. Burrabadeen was a
well-known Australian performer and Sea Wall was an imported
mare, being the dam of Seabound, winner of the Birthday and Wil-
liamstown Cups. Bonny Deen, which is a four-years-old
mare, won several races, including handicaps at Penola and
Naracoorte. She was also a winner at Casterton, across the
border, and dead heated in a handicap at Mount Gambier. Among
his mares is Tristram’s Daughter, which is a steeplechaser
by Sir Tristram out of F.M.P. A two-year-old colt by that
sterling performer Gold Cuffs from F.M.P. is running in the
paddocks, and Tristram’s Daughter has a yearling filly by Fleurist,
another imported galloper. In the present season T ristram s
Daughter was served by Denacre.


C. A. AND G. L. McFABLANE
"Pcnola" Station
THE HEAD-QUARTERS ON "PENOLA " STATION.
In the early days of settlement, when Penola was just being
formed, large station properties were established, and these prac-
tically constituted the district. The properties were “YallunT,
“Katnook”, “Glen Roy”, and Penola” station, and for many years
there was little surplus land beyond their bounds available for new
settlers. However, in the course of time closer settlement schemes
caused these large estates to be divided up, and, the old families
dying out, new owners came into possession.
Among the several recent recruits to the rank of south-eastern
pastoralists, are Messrs. C. A. and G. L. McFarlane, who, in
January, 1929. purchased the old "Penola’' station, which
now extends over 22,000 acres of pastoral land. Certain
portions are also adaptable to agriculture, but it is probable
that this industry will be sacrificed in favour of sheep
and cattle raising. At the present time, about 800 acres have
been topdressed with super, and a further 900 acres sown with sub-

terranean clover, but the whole of the remaining land is still in its
natural state. The estate may be divided into two parts, scrub
land, and open gum country,, the latter being mostly cleared.
The principal natural stock fodders are root grasses and
English rye grass, and on this pasture about one sheep to three acres
is able to be maintained throughout the year. The clover land
carries three sheep to every two acres.
Shearing time on "Penola Station" will be held in October,
and this year it is anticipated that about 10,000 sheep will be shorn.
The flock consists of pure merino blood, some of the sheep having
been obtained from Mr. Allan McFarlane’s estate, "Wellington
Lodge,” some from "Woodlands,” New South Wales, and some
from northern stations. The wool averages between 64’s and
66’s quality, and the individual clips are expected to be high. As
the new owners have not had previous experience of shearing on


A MOB OF MERINO RAMS ON “PENOLA.”
this property it is only possible to estimate an average wool cut, but
10 lbs. of wool per grown sheep would probably be fairly accurate
judgment.
In addition to the sheep, Messrs. McFarlane have established
an excellent herd of Aberdeen-Angus cattle, based on stock from
“Wellington Lodge,” and animals will be bred for the production
of baby beef.
There are several swamps on different portions of “Penola
Station,” and from these sources the stock are able to obtain good
supplies of water. A reticulation from bores also assists in provid-
ing the estate with water. On account of the comparatively cold
climate, wool production will be the essential industry, and in
order to increase the number of sheep, the country will be further
cleared, and a rigorous system of supering and subterranean clover
planting will be carried out.
The country is well suited to pastoral pursuits, as the natural
fodder is good, water is plentiful, and the abundant timber affords
excellent shelter for sheep in the lambing season. In the swamps
there are large quantities of reeds and rushes, which are first-class
fodder for cattle, and the Aberdeens are, therefore, well provided
for in this natural way to help the supplies of subterranean clover.
As a rule the cattle are sold at 2| years of age, but occasionally they
are disposed of as calves. An averege well-built bullock. 2\ years
old, will weigh 1,400 lbs., dresed.
The “Penola Station” homestead is an old fashioned, pictur-
esque building, with a deer park running along its eastern side. In
this park there are about a dozen red deer, and a few kangaroos.
There is also a flower garden, and orchard, from which fruits are
obtainable for station use.


A DRY LAGOON ON “PENOLA” STATION.
As far as the present owners are concerned. '‘Penola
Station” is quite a new estate, and the industries arc
still more or less in experimental stages. But when modern
methods have been applied and the country reaches somewhere near
its maximum capacity and productivity, this holding should prove
one of the most profitable in the south-east.

MOUNT GAMMER AND DISTRICT
Embracing Kalangadoo, Port MacDonnell, Moorak, Yahl and Kongorong.
In 1873, Mr. William Hay, son of the late John Hay, one of the
-earliest settlers in the district, was born at Mount Gambier. His education
was completed at the local school, and for a time he helped his father on
the farm. He soon became a champion plowman, and won retiring gold
medals for the best ploughing, best finish, and best strike out, competing
against the most capable farmers of the district when a mere boy of 17
years of age- In 1885, he left Mount Gambier and took over a position
in the leaching plant of the Broken Hill Proprietary Coy. For three years
Mr. Hay remained at Broken Hill, but owing to ill health, he decided to
return to his home town, and received an appointment as local manager for
•Charlick Bros., of Adelaide. A little latetr he joined William Charlick Ltd.
of Mt. Gambier, and when this company went into the flour milling business,
he purchased the concern and continued as William Hay Limited, forming a
company of which lie was appointed managing director. Since that time
he has greatly extended his activities, and he is now represented in many
-districts, both South Australian and inter-State. He is also a director of
the City Flour Mills. Mr. Hay is keenly interested in sport, and has been
connected with the Caledonian Society for 25 years, during which time he
was Chief for three years, and won the tossing the caber contest against
all comers.
He is intimately connected with the Druids’ Lodge, which lie was
instrumental in inaugurating in Mt. Gambier, and has held the office of
treasurer for 27 years, being also secretary for a term. For twelve years,
Mr. Hay has been secretary of St. Andrew’s Presbyterian Church, and is
-one of the elders. He has been connected with the Council of Mt. Gambier
for eight years, and is on the council for the West ward. In 1928 he was
-elected Mayor of Mt. Gambier-
Mr. WILLIAM HAY, J.P.
Mayor of Mount Gambier.
The town of Mount Gambier was founded in 1854, by Has-
tings Cunningham, and the Government stepped in a little later and
-divided off the police reserve. From that time onward many new
owners took up subdivisions in the locality.
Mount Gambier is situated 305 miles south-east of Adelaide,
.and its district population is about 10,000. while there are more than
1,000 dwellings within the precincts of the town. On April 27,
1904, the centenary of the discovery of Mounts Gambier and Schank
was commemorated by the erection of a memorial tower at the sum-
mit of Mount Gambier. The tower was constructed of red dolo-
mite, and is 30 feet high, and a telescope is placed in the upper of the
two stories for the use of visitors.
As a holiday resort Mount Gambier enjoys a large setting, and
the picturesque surroundings of the town, including the Lake
Reserve and Vanstittart Park gardens, provide a never, failing attrac-
tion for visitors. I'he fertile volcanic soil of the' town and district
and the excellent water supply gives the local people the opportunity
to cultivate gardens under the most favourable circumstances, and
of this they have taken advantage, particularly during the last few
years. Within a few miles of the town white coraline limestone,
and grey, pink, and red dolomite are abundant, and the business
places and residences are consequently built for the most part of stone.
Much has been done in recent years in the exploitation of the vast
deposits of coraline limestone abounding near Mount Gambier, and
with the entry of private enterprise into the field, large quantities of
this remarkable building stone have been sent out all over South
Australia, while its demand in the Western Districts of Victoria, and
even in Melbourne, is ever on the increase. Messrs. Knight and
Pritchard are the prime movers in the stone industry, and their
quarries are one of the interesting sights for visitors. Good stone
for road making, and material for footpaths is also procurable at
convenient distances, and as a result the streets and footpaths are
well laid down. The Town Council has first-class road making

equipment. Recently a progressive policy of road maintenance was
entered upon, and the Council purchased an up-to-date bitumen
plant, Many streets of the town are now bituminised, and this
work is continually being extended. The horse teams previously
used for carting metal and for other purposes, have been replaced
by a tractor and trailer.
I he town has its own supply of electric light and power, and
gas, and an unfailing supply of water is obtained from the Blue Lake
Reservoir. From a tourist standpoint. Mount Gambier offers a
greater variety of attractions than any other resort in the state.
Primarily, there are the lakes,— natural formations in the crater
of the extinct volcano. Mount Gambier. The Valley Lake and
Browne’s Lake form a very pretty sight, and a roadway runs for
a considerable distance round their edges. The Leg of Mutton
Lake, so called on account of its peculiar shape, is well hidden by a
very dense growth of pinus insignis and other trees, and presents
an appearance not unlike Canadian landscape. The Blue Lake is
the most remarkable of all. It has a depth of roughly 460 feet,
and undergoes peculiar changes of shades of blue. About Septem-
ber and October it presents an almost torquoise blue, unlike any
shade of blue seen on any other sheet of water. The reason of its
colour still remains a mystery. The establishing of a camping
ground at the Lakes has been welcomed by many tourists who enjoy
the open air life.
Apart from several fine public buildings, including a Town Hall
and Post Office, a number of imposing establishments help to add
to the general appearance of prosperity that pervades the, town.
Jens’ Town Hall Hotel is well known in all parts of Australia as
being one of the finest and most up-to-date residential hotels in the
Commonwealth. Gifford’s Mount Gambier Hotel and the Palace
Hotel may be named as possibly the most patronised by tourists,
and these three houses do remarkable business from one year’s end
to another. Messrs. Fidler and Webb possess very fine premises in
the main street, and their departmental stores are maintained in
a manner that would be aproved iff any modern city.
In these days of increased motor transport, it is only natural
that a town like Mount Gambier should have every facility shown to
the travelling motorist, in the way of garaging and general service.
In these deparments there is no doubt that May U Davis hold the
monopoly in the town. They have three large garages and service
stations, and also possess an aerodrome situated about 5 miles out
on the Penola Road. From the drome pleasure flights and service
runs to any portion of Australia are arranged.
Souvenir collectors are well catered for by Messrs. Arthur U
Son, whose photographic studios and novelty stores adjoin Messrs.
Fidler U Webb. It is of interest to note that copies of any illus-
trations appearing in this publication may be procured from Messrs.
Arthur U Son.
The town’s industries are numerous, and consist of two large
oatmeal and flour mills, worsted mills, two aerated water factories,
and many other smaller concerns. There is a fine sports oval, a
race course, two recreation grounds, a show ground, and a swimming
baths.
At the back, of the Town Hall is a most unusual phenomenon
in the form of an old volcanic blow hole, into which the waste
waters from the town run. Up to the present time the hole has
never been depthed. A pretty garden has been planted round the
hole, and lawns have been laid out, the whole being known as the
Cave Gardens. About a mile and a half out of the town there
is another small cave, called Umpherston’s. ,
Eighteen miles south of Mount Gambier lies Port MacDonncll,
which was founded in 1859. At one time it was a fairly busy
shipping port, but regular service was interrupted in 1914 on account
of labour troubles, and, although efforts have been made to re-estab-
lish a service they have proved unsuccessful. The district is partly
agricultural and partly pastoral, and a small fishing trade is carried
on, but the town possesses importance chiefly as a summer holiday
resort. A Progress Association has been formed, and is carrying
out a scheme of improvement to the foreshore and beauty spots of
the district. Every facility is offered for swimming, fishing, boat-
ing, tennis and golfing.
A few miles from the town is the Cape Northumberland light-
house, an important mariners’ guide, and a little further on is
“Dingley Dell,” the old home of South Australia’s poet, Adam
Eindsay Gordon,. which has been preserved by the Government as
a place of interest to the tourist. Close to the town also, are
Ewens’ Ponds, another attraction to the visitors.
Kongo.rong is a farming and grazing district, located about
16 miles from Mt. Gambier. It was originally owned by the late
W. J. T. Clarke of “Mount Schank” station and was purchased
by the Government for subdivision under closer settlement schemes.
Since then blocks have been taken up by farmers and converted into
a prosperous grazing and dairying district. A co-operative cheese
and butter factory was opened in 1919.
Moorak and Yahl are two farming, grazing, and dairying
districts, about 2-> and 5 miles south of Mount Gambier. In each,
a co-operative butter and cheese factory has been established, to which
the dairymen deliver their milk, and many tons of cheese and butter
are produced and exported every year.
Kalangadoo, about 20 miles from Mount Gambier, and 14 J
miles from Penola, is situated on the main railway line to Adelaide,
and-is the centre of a prosperous farming and grazing district. Two
fine old properties in Koorine and Kalangadoo estate have been
subdivided for settlement and repatriation purposes, and this move
has been the means of giving considerable impetus to the district.

MAY & DAVIS
Mount Gambier Aeroplane and Motor Services
THE AERODROME, PENOLA ROAD, 5 MILES FROM MOUNT GAMBIER.
Motor transport is largely used in the South-East, and the
need for an efficient motor house was quickly realised. Messrs.
May and Davis opened a supplies and repair depot in Penola Road,
Mount Gambier, in May, 1920, since when their attention to the
motor wants of the South-East has resulted in a big development of
their business.
Operations commenced in a small shed in Commercial Street
with a staff of three. In 1922 the enterprise warranted building
a new garage 110 ft. by 50 ft. in Penola Road, and in the following
year extensions were necessary, a further 110 ft. by 80 ft. being
enclosed, which now accommodates the workshop, where the latest
methods are adopted for reconditioning all makes and classes of
cars.
Valve grinding is now carried out by machinery, and such
operations do not require any hand labor whatever. To cater
for the need of tourists and local owners a Black and Decker valve
grinding outfit has been installed at considerable expense. Each
valve is put under pneumatic test to be certain that it is perfectly
seated. The equipment is also complete in other directions, so
that a general service of repairs, both mechanical and electrical, is
available.
In 1926 Messrs. May and Davis took over the business of
Messrs. Hill and Co., of Commercial Street, and added another
branch, where an up-to-date American car washing outfit has been
erected, enabling the output to be increased by 100 per cent. A
special rack has been built to elevate cars for the purpose of under-
neath cleaning.
To cope with the increase of business a service station was
opened on Penola Road combined with a parking station. Spirit
is supplied from six pumps, and a comprehensive range of oils and
accessories is carried. Locked garages are available for visitors.
Messrs. May and Davis have established a big business as car
dealers. They have been representatives for General Motors
products since the foundation of their business, dealing chiefly in
Chevrolets, Oldsmobiles, and Buicks. Car sales of all makes are
undertaken, the sales for last year averaging 20 per month. The
firm headed the sales for General Motors products in the South-East,
and two years ago they topped the sales list of new Pontiacs in
the South-East by disposing of 23 in the first 30 days.
Keeping abreast of the times, Messrs. May and Davis have
interested themselves in an aeroplane service, running three machines
—a De Havilland Old Gold (8 passenger), Fokker Universal (5
passenger), and three De Havilland Gipsy Moths (each 2 pasengers).
The aerodrome was granted a first-class licence, and passenger flights
are conducted to any part of Australia. 1 heir hangar accom-
modates three machines.

Exterior View of Fidler & Webb Ltd's. Departmental Store.
Until comparatively recent years, the people in rural South Australia were always at a disadvantage when they desired to purchase
wearing apparel and materials that conformed with fashion and the times. It was nearly always necessary to make a trip to the
city, necessitating expense and delay. Today, however, most towns possess at least one store that is able to cater for the demands
of its local residents and the visiting public, and Mount Gambier is no exception to the rule. In the fine modern departmental
stores of Fidler U Webb Ltd. practically every requirement is catered for. Purchases are made from all the leading ware-
houses in Adelaide, Melbourne, and Sydney, and even in England and the Continent, of new models, as they become dedicated to the
vogue of fashion. This store maintains a reputation for comprehensive supplies that is not exceeded by any city house, and being
established for over half a century, its integrity is irreproachable. Before the commencement of each season, local and visiting
patrons are invited to visit the showrooms to inspect the wide ranges of beautiful frockings and materials that are displayed.

COMMERCIAL FLOUR AND OATMEAL MILLING COY. LTD.,
MOUNT GAMMER
Established 1861
A PANORAMIC VIEW OF THE PREMISES.
The flour and oatmeal milling industry is specially suited to
the South-East, and offers plenty of scope for enterprising business
men. Mills were erected in the very early days, the largest being
that now owned by the Commercial Flour and Oatmeal Milling
Company Ltd., of Mount Gambier.
At one time the mill operated by this company was owned by
the late Mr. T. H. Wilson. When the business was liquidated the
late Mr. G. T. Wright, who was miller for Mr. Wilson, was
approached to form a company. Plenty of support was forth-
coming, and Mr. Wright was appointed manager. The company
took over control about 1880. The business was successfully
carried on for a long period, there being an excellent demand for the
company’s products. In 1916 the concern was floated into a
limited company with Mr. G. T. Wright as its managing director.
On the death of Mr. Wright his two sons, Messrs. C. L. Wright and
G. E. Wright, took over the management, the former supervising
the milling operations, and the latter attending to the commercial
side.
In the early days the operations were very limited. Mr. G. T.
Wright put in more up-to-date plant 25 years ago and quickly

proved that Mount Gambier could supply the needs of the whole
State. As a result the import of American flaked oats ceased. The
superiority of the local product was the cause, the import of New
Zealand products also dropping off for the same reason.
Thanks to keen oversight and complete knowledge of the
milling trade, the company has prospered. Its mill, which is
situated right in the town of Mount Gambier, covers a little oyer
two acres of ground. The main building houses the flour mill,
oatmeal, factory, and grain stores.
The chief product is oatmeal, the output from the factory
being the largest in the State. As a matter of fact, the Commercial
Company s factory is the pioneer of oatmeal milling in bouth
Australia. A subsidiary but important industry is flour muling,
and the company also carries on an extensive business as a grain
The Qats arc all loca u y groW n. The South-Eastern lands
return very heavy yields of this grain, the quality of which is recog-
nised tQ bg the best in tbe Commonwealth. The company puts
through its mills over 100,000 bushels of oats each year which are
turned into oatmeal and rolled oats.


AN INTERIOR SECTION OF THE MILL.
I'he utmost care is insisted upon in the handling of the grain.
When the oats come in from the farms to the mill the grain is
thoroughly cleansed by grading and aspiration. Foreign grain and
light screenings are carefully separated so that the meal will be
absolutely pure. The oats are then clipped, followed by a complete
drying by the latest kiln process. The method of the latter is a
direct application of hot air from a coke furnace. This extracts
from 6 to 10 per cent, of moisture from the grain. After the
drying process the oats pass through a magnetic separator which
extracts any fragments of steel or iron, also nails.
They are now ready for hulling or removal of the outer skin
or shell. The hulls are a most valuable by-product and are in
great demand for feed. They are most popular with dairy farmers
who find that the hulls assist milk production and are generally
advantageous to cows.
The above explains the preliminary work in preparing the
oats as they come off the farms for grinding into meal. The hulls
and the groats (the kernel) are now separated by a special process. A
grader is brought into action which separates the groats into large
and small sizes. The former are generally used for rolled oats,
and the smaller for oatmeal. To prepare for rolled oats the large
groats are steamed, rolled between steel rollers, thoroughly dried, and
then packed in bulk for marketing. The smaller groats are placed
in a grinding machine and the oatmeal marketed in bulk. All the
products are forwarded to the leading wholesale houses in Adelaide
and distributed throughout South Australia. Victoria, and Western
Australia.
It is in interesting to know that the wheat raised by local
growers is in strong demand for the manufacture of flour for biscuit
making. This wheat is converted into a special flour and is sold
not only locally, but some to Victoria, and other parcels go as far
afield as Egypt. The ordinary wheat for bakers’ purposes is pur-
chased from all parts of the South-East, and the flour milled from
it is distributed extensively throughout South Australia and Victoria.
Some of it is exported.
The Commercial Flour and Oatmeal Milling Company is cap-
able of meeting the requirements of the overseas markets, and the
quality of its products is such that they compare more than favor-
ably with any overseas flour, oatmeal, or rolled oaots. The oats
are grown on the rich volcanic soils for which the Mount Gambier
district is famous. It is exceptionally good land for this purpose,
the yields going from 50 to 60 bushels to the acre.

(Late John Thompson & Co.)
Ihe Commercial Flour and Oatmeal Milling Company has
always been progressive, and is ready to extend its operations when-
ever the opportunity offers. In 1927 it acquired the milling busi-
ness of Messrs. John Thompson & Co. at Narracoorte, where
operations have since been successfully conducted.
The mill operated by Mr. John Thompson was an old-
established one, many thousands of tons of grain having passed
through it. The Commercial Company are carrying it on on the

old lines, and the existence of the mill is of the greatest benefit to
the district.
The wheat and other supplies are drawn from the farms around
Narracoorte, and the flour produced is used locally, the surplus
being sent abroad.
The Narracoorte mills are worked very economically with a
wood-burning producer gas engine as the power unit. For this
class of work the plant is the cheapest obtainable.


MOORAK CO-OPERATIVE DAIRY AND PRODUCE COY., LTD.
Mount GamMer
Chairman of Directors - - - - John Johnston Manager - - - W. E. Menzies
Secretary - - J. E. Trevorrow
A GENERAL VIEW OE THE FACTORY.
This company, which was founded in 1912, provides a good
example of the benefits of co-operation. The factory is situated three
miles from Mount Gambier on the road to Port McDonnell, and
it takes the dairy produce of about 100 suppliers in the Mount
Gambier (Moorak) district.
Ihe chief activity is in cheese, the Moorak product being
famous for its quality not only throughout Australia, but overseas.
It is sold in Adelaide and Melbourne through the wholesale
merchants, and so great is the demand that it is impossible to supply
all orders. In addition to the verdict of the public, prizes won in
Adelaide and Melbourne testify to the quality of the Moorak cheese.
The milk comes in each morning, averaging about 1,700 gallons
daily. Five receiving vats with a capacity of 800 gallons heat it by
steam to a temperature of 85 degrees Fahr. Colouring matter is
then added to colour the cheese, followed by rennet to granulate
the milk. The mixture is allowed to set for three-quarters of an
hour and is then cut into junket, which separates the whey from the
curd. Ihe cutting is performed by horizontal and vertical curd
knives. A slow stirring for an hour follows, during which the
temperature is raised to 100 deg. Fahr. It is kept at that point for
a further hour and a half, when the whey is siphoned from the
curd and the curd is matted in the vat and allowed to mellow for
two hours.
I he next process is through the salter, a matter of 30 minutes,
during which salt is added as a preservative. With the cheese now
taking shape, a binding cloth is put on and the cheese is put into
moulds of 40, 20, 10, and 5 lb. capacity. After a thorough pressing
for half an hour, the cheese is lifted from the moulds for trimming,
and is returned to them for a further pressing extending over 16
hours. Here the actual manufacture of the cheese ends, the moulds
being emptied and the cheese stored in the curing room for six weeks
to allow it to dry and mature. Every care is taken to ensure a
standard quality being sent to the wholesale houses, who distribute
it on prices fixed on Monday of each week. The weights sold are
40 lb., 20 lb., 10 lb. and 5 lb.
During the last statistical twelve months, 262 tons of cheese
were manufactured at the Moorak factory, and four tons of butter
were made for the suppliers of milk, no butter being sold to anybody
else. The milk used during the period mentioned above totalled
61 1,950 gallons, and for the twelve months approximately
£ 20,000 was paid to milk producers in the district. The milk
received for turning into butter is separated, and the cream converted
into butter. The separated milk is disposed of for pigs and calves.
A Simplex churn is used for butter making, about 300 lb. a week
being made for local milk suppliers. It is neatly packed in 1 lb.
packets.
The factory is most up-to-date and well run, being one of the
most successful in the district.


RICHARD JAMES HILL
"Yahlville"
An object lesson in mixed farming is provided by Mr. Richard
James Hill at “Yahlville.” This property is a small one in area,
covering 242 acres, and including two properties at Moorak. The
homestead portion was purchased by Mr. Hill’s father in 1881, and
Mr. R. J. Hill took it over when the latter died in 1887. The
Moorak land consisting of 116 acres was bought by Mr. R. J. Hill
in 1905. Mr. Hill’s three sons have a property of 200 acres
adjoining the homestead. It is the same class of land as Yahl-
ville,” and it is all worked together.
The soil at “Yahlville,” which lies six miles south-east of
Mount Gambier, is rich black, with a limestone and clay subsoil.
Mr. Hill crops about 100 acres with barley, oats and potatoes. The
returns from barley have reached as high as 68 bushels to the acre,
and in 1928, Mr. Hill took off an average of 74 bushels of oats.
He usually relies on Duckbill barley, but the oats that did so well
last year were Imbros. The variety was brought back from
Gallipoli by a returned soldier, and three years ago Mr. Hill
purchased three bushels to experiment with. He was rewarded last
year with a return of 74 bushels to the acre. All the land is cleared,
and every year Mr. Hill topdresses, drilling super in with the crops.
Sheep at “Yahlville” are just as successful as barley and oats,
Mr. Hill having secured many valuable trophies with picked
specimens from his flocks. The land supports three sheep to the
acre, about 400 being carried. They are principally Lincoln stud
sheep, although a few crossbreds are also run. The stud was
founded in 1908, when Mr. Hill purchased a ram and 22 ewes
from Mr. R. C. Forsyth of “Preston Leigh,” Hamilton, Victoria.
Two years later a ram was bought from Messrs. Christie Brothers,
and in 1913, a ram and ewe from Mr. J. B. Sutton of New Zealand
were added to the stud. Still seeking fresh blood, Mr. Hill secured
the ram Gold Bar (832 Vol. 9) from Mr. E. W. Oliver of
Tasmania in 1916, and in 1918 he purchased another Christie
Brothers ram, Jack No. 1 122 (1479 Vol. 12).
The Lincolns are a very well clad sheep which thrive in the
South-East. The wool is long and of good quality, the count
being about 44’s. For twelve months’ growth the sheep show a
wool up to 12 inches long. The Lincolns are used for crossing
with merinos to obtain a first-cross dual purpose sheep. The first-
cross lambs make into excellent freezers, and are marketed at four
months.
Mr. Hill has exhibited at Naracoorte, Penola, Mount Gambier

first prizes and championships. Among his successes was the
Quibell Cup, which had to be won three times by the same
exhibitor, for highest aggregate of points at the Mount Gambier
show. He won this trophy outright in 1913. At Millicent, Mr.
Hill won the “Noramanoo” Cup donated by Mr. A. L. Spehr,
for two-tooth ram shown under natural conditions. Three wins
were required, and Mr. Hill succeeded in three successive years—
-1918-19-20. The Spencer Cup at Mount Gambier was also
secured by him in the same years. Championships for Lincoln
ram and ewe have been won by Mr. Hill both at Mount Gambier
and Millicent.
For the 1918 drop, the rams used were Hills No. 1 (833, vol.
9) and Gold Bar. The flock at May 1, 1918 consisted of five
rams, 78 ram lambs, 182 ewes and 68 ewe lambs. At May 1, 1920,
the flock comprised 48 rams, 17 ram lambs, 169 ewes and 102 ewe
lambs. The rams used for the 1922 drop were Gold Bar, Tag
207 (179, vol. 6), Jack No. 1122, and No. 339 (509, vol. 7).
On the Ist May, 1922, the flock comprised ten rams, 15 ram lambs,
115 ewes and 20 ewe lambs. The figures are interesting as showing
the care exercised by Mr. Hill in maintaining selectness in his stud.

A VIEW OF THE EXTENSIVE MOUNT GAMBIER FACTORY .
Lf e L te Mr. T. H. Williams in 1903 founded the oatmeal
mill which forms the South-Eastern business of A. A. Brice £3 Co.,
Ltd. It was known as the Blue Lake Oatmeal Milling Company
and was taken over in 1908 by A. A. Brice & Co., Ltd., and con-
aucted without change for some years. In 1912 the first of many
expansions took place with the addition of a butter factory, and
since that time the business has assumed very large dimensions.
Ihe butter factory operates throughout the whole of
t e south-east, dairy supplies being purchased from the producers in
all the main centres, also from portions of the western districts of
\ ictoria. Other departments’ mentioned further on in this article,
were formed, and to-day the company is a big factor in the business
life of the south-east.
1 he "Blue Lake" brand of Rolled Oats and Oatmeal, manu-
factured by A. A. Brice 18 Co., Ltd., is known on practically every
breakfast table in South Australia where porridge is served. The
secret of good oatmeal is largely bound up with the
land the oats are grown on, and in this respect the
country at Mount Gambier equals anything else in Aus-
tralia. With a big rainfall and wonderfully rich volcanic soil
it is ideal for oat growing. Crops going fifty and sixty bushels to
the acre are regularly reaped. The supply for the "Blue Lake"

WHERE “BLUE LAKE” OATMEAL IS MILLED.
Mills comes from growers in many parts of the South-East, including
Narracoorte, Glencoe and Tantanoola, but the greatest quantity is
secured from country within a thirty miles radius of Mt. Gambier.
The oats are generally harvested in January, and great care is
exercised in selecting only the very best to mill. A difficulty is the
quantity of foreign weeds which spring up with the oats, the seeds
of which cannot be allowed to be milled with the rest of the crop.
They are removed by revolving sieves, and special cylinders.
Strong air currents are used to remove shreds, light husks and dust,
while a magnetised plate picks up any iron or steel objects, such
as small nails, etc. At the same time that these cleaning processes
are being carefully carried out all undersized! and inferior oats are
rejected and the “tail of each oat is knocked off by beaters as the
stream passes through a revolving drum.
When the oats are passed as fit for milling they are cooked,
this being necessary to remove the horny husk or hull from the
kernel of the grain. They are cooked in a kiln, care being taken to
see that the grain is uniformly heated. The preliminary cooking
not only loosens the grain in the husks, but also imparts the
distinctive nutty flavour peculiar to Blue Lake Oats. It aso
disposes of excess moisture. Following the cooking process, the
oats are run into bins where they go on cooking and gradually cool
off.


THE BLUE LAKE AT MOUNT GAM BIER.
The next operation is to ' hull'’ or skin the oats by means of
emery-coated discs. The product is then separated by means of
a winnower in which the husks are blown out from the heavier oat
kernels. The latter are also treated to remove the “branning,"
a film with a bitter flavour that must not be allowed to remain. A
certain proportion of the small oats reach this stage still unhusked,
and they are cleverly taken out by means of an “oat groat separator."
The next act is to grade the groats* as they are now termed,
according to size. The largest are used as “rolled oats," the smaller
being used for oatmeal of the ordinary kind. Rolled oats have certain
advantages which ordinary oatmeal lacks; for, if properly prepared,
rolled oats are superior in flavour and cook quicker than oatmeal.
7 his is partly due to a second cooking process by steam to which
they are subjected to make them plastic and amenable to the next
treatment of rolling between smooth steel cylinders. These rollers
are heated and squeeze the steam-damped oats to a wafer-like thinness
at the same time drying out the surplus moisture.
Oatmeal and rolled oats is the principal product of the “Blue
Lake mills. It is sent to Adelaide for distribution under the
trade name of Blue Lake “Quail Brand," and is dis-
tributed throughout the South-East and the western districts of
Victoria,
The butter factory operations of A, A. Brice ft Co. Ltd. are on
an extensive scale. The cream arrives by train and motor truck
from scores of south-eastern farms and is at once graded by taste.
It is then sampled and weighed, and from the samples a Babcock test

results to be paid to the farmers for their product. A. A. Brice and
Co. Ltd. arc the only company which pays on the butter fat content
system. It has now been brought into force everywhere under
the new Dairy Act. and it is recognised as the best and fairest
method of payment. The same basis of payment has been adopted
in Victoria.
The utmost care and cleanliness are exercised in all the processes
•of turning the cream into butter. The cream is tipped from the
cans into a receiving vat. From the latter the cream is pumped
into a pasteurizer where it is heated to 150 degrees Fahr., by means
of boiling water passed through coils. It is then let down into
churns and made into butter. The product is salted, packed in
56 lb. wire-bound boxes and put into cool store ready to rail to
Adelaide and Melbourne. In the Mt. Gambier district the butter
is sold as “B.B." but the butter sold in Adelaide is branded
“Beehive.” In the export season, large quantities are exported
to London by the Adelaide office and through Melbourne agents.
To ensure maximum cleanliness, A. A. Brice & Co. Ltd. render
.all possible assistance and advice to farmers. After a can is received
at the factory and the contents removed the can is carefully sterilised
in a steam jet and thoroughly washed before it is returned to the
•owner.
Besides being large producers of butter and oatmeal, A. A.
Brice & Co.. Ltd., are large buyers of eggs in the South-East.
These are taken from the storekeepers and forwarded to the Adelaide

factory where they are pulped and frozen. This supply takes
care ,of the big demand always forthcoming from biscuit and cake
manufacturers. In its frozen state the egg pulp will keep
indefinitely.
Rabbit chilling is worked in conjunction with the London
Export Co. Pty. Ltd., of Melbourne. This company collects, chills
and markets for the home and London markets. The organisation
is worked through branches in the various states, each branch
attending to the chilling, A. A. Brice & Co. Ltd. being the south-
eastern branch. The rabbits are obtained by the London Export
Co. Pty. Ltd. from trappers in various parts of the south-east.
Collecting vans are constantly at work touring the country and
purchasing from trappers. On arrival at the Mount Gambier branch,
the rabbits are cleaned and placed in the refrigerating chambers which
take out the animal heat without completely freezing them. After-
wards they are sent in crates to the Melbourne headquarters where they
are skinned, cleaned, decapitated, the legs cut off- and dressed for
sale in the shops.
In addition to all the above activities, A. A. Brice & Co. Ltd.
carry on a merchandising business, being the local agent and depot
for Spicers & Detmold Ltd. (paper makers, wholesalers of twine,
paper wrappings, etc.). They are sole distributors in the south-east
for the Diabolo Separator Co. and also represent the Victoria General
Insurance Company. A fair amount of business is also done by
them in wholesale groceries, and the large refrigerating plant enables
ice to be supplied to the South-East.


KNIGHT & PRITCHARD, PTY., LTD.
A REMARKABLE VIEW OF THE LIMESTONE QUARRIES.
Besides farming, dairying, and sheepraising, there are numerous
industrial activities in the South-East, one of the most important
being the Coralline Limestone Quarries owned and operated by
Knight and Pritchard Pty Ltd. Limestone has been used for
building in the Mount Gambier district for many years, its dura-
bility being testified to by structures which have been erected for
70 years and are as good to-day as when they were first put' up.
The discovery of an area of stone that could be operated on
on a big commercial scale was, however, not made until 1923, when
Mr. Knight, who had been interested in oil geology for some years,
examined the locality of the deposits which are nine miles west of
Mount Gambier. He knew the stone was present and a lot of
time and money were spent in making tests and taking out cores.
This work, which covered a large area, was done privately and
secretly. At the conclusion of the tests Mr. Knight’s judgment
was vindicated by estimates which revealed approximately
10,000,000 cubic yards of stone. About 472 acres of the land
was acquired on a freehold purchase and quarrying operations were
commenced in August, 1923.
Saws were used to cut the stone and from the edge of the
outcrop the quarry has been gradually worked in until solid
pillars up to 21 feet deep can actually be cut. The stones are
quarried in large blocks up to 20, cubic yards each which are reduced
to 2 cubic yards or cut to building sizes as desired.
The output of the quarry is 7,000 to 8,000 cubic yards per
annum, each cubic yard going roughly a ton. In view of the
huge supply and the comparatively easy methods of quarrying the
output could be extended to meet any demand. The stone is sent
for general distribution throughout South Australia and Victoria,
and has even been shipped as far as to Streaky Bay on the west
coast of South Australia and to Gippsland in Victoria. As the
quarries are not far from Beachport, which has facilities for shipping,
the stone could be dispatched to any part of the World.
The formation of the deposits has interested geologists who
state that they owe their origin to Bryozoa (or moss coral). The
stone was originally a marine formation, the work of a sea urchin
or coral insect. In the course of millions of years the rock has
become fossilised and its remarkable strength is due to its great age.
Its compression strength has been tested by the authorities and found
to be nearly 800 lb. per square inch. In this respect the following
figures are interesting:—

THESE SOLID LIMESTONE BLOCKS ARE A PERFECT BUILDING MATERIAL.

Breadth, 4.25 inches.
Ultimate load carried, 3,890 lb.
The stone is naturally white and cream in colour with a medium
free porous texture. Quarrying is performed with saws in much the
same manner as wood is cut.
In addition to its value in the walls of buildings, this limestone
makes an excellent base for tennis courts and it is easily worked
where ornamentation is required. The stone makes a good lime
which is burnt on the property and is particularly good for
plastering. The moisture content and insoluble matters are small
as the following report from the Geological Survey Laboratory of
the Victorian Mines Department shows:—
MOISTURE 0.26

IRON OXIDE AND ALUMINA trace
CARBONATE OF CALCIUM 95.25
CARBONATE OF MAGNESIUM trace
PHOSPHATES nil.
CHLORIDES trace
TOTAL . . . . 99.61
The quality of the stone receives its best advertisement from
the first-class condition of the walls in buildings where it is used.
The longer a house has been built the better this is realised, and
the stone becomes in stronger demand every year. The output
of the quarries has had to be regularly increased, and with new
markets constantly opening up the enterprise is an unusually sound
one. Mount Gambier is admitted to be one of the best built
towns in the Commonwealth, the credit for which is due in a large
measure to the quality of the stone mined from the local quarries.
An important feature of the limestone is its value for
sculptural and ornamentation purposes. It can easily be bored,
carved, turned and planed, and is a splendid material for Universities
and technical schools which require stone for students to learn
sculpture on.


FRANCES CAMPBELL CAINE "Mona Park"
CATTLE AND SHEEP CRAZING ON "MONA PARK."
Mr. F. C. Caine is an enterprising South-Eastern landholder
who has shown in a few years what the soil there can do.
He took up “Mona Park,’’ which is 16 miles west of Mount
Gambier, in 1921. There were three blocks in it totalling 970
acres, but the area has since been increased to 1,300 acres. It is
all plains land, and was quite devoid of green timber. Since
then several plantations for shade have been made of sugar gums,
Yate gums, and pines.
The holding is both agricultural and pastoral, the soil being
a heavy loam with a clay subsoil. From it Mr. Caine is getting
excellent results, especially from one paddock of about 300 acres,
most of which has been cultivated and grassed down.
The flint area is remarkably good for grazing, and as a rule it has
been proved that the flint land is actually the best for this purpose
in the Kongorong district. In its natural state it will support a
sheep to the acre, but with top-dressing of the pastures it
can accommodate two sheep to the acre all the year round without
danger of overstocking.
The natural grasses on the flint country are brome grass,
wallaby grass, and small clover. On the ordinary land, where
flint is not in evidence, the natural grasses do not thrive so well,
the land being of a limestone nature, which, although not of such
heavy carrying capacity is very healthy country. This type of land
carries a little better than a sheep to the acre, although when super
is applied it is also capable of running 21 sheep to the acre.
Mr. Caine relies on sheep, but each year he breaks up about
30 acres and sows a portion of it for hay for winter feeding. The
remainder is used for green feed such as rape and turnips, which
are a great assistance to the lambs at weaning time.
For the hay cut Mr. Caine sows Algerian oats chiefly, putting
in the seed late and thick so as to get a strong growth. The result
is about 13 tons to the acre. The autumn following after cutting
the hay crop the land is disc ploughed and sown with half a bushel
of English rye grass, 1 lb. of subterranean clover, 1 lb. white Dutch
clover, 1 lb. alsyke clover, and supered with a hundredweight of
super to the acre. This is then used as a pasturage, and it carries
four sheep to the acre. The possibilities presented by that remark-

able figure can be worked out when it is remembered that a tew
hundred mile, away in the Far North a sheep to the square mile
is reckoned fair stocking.
T he Kongorong area enjoys a rainfall of 30 inches, and as
there is no need for artificial drainage on “Mona Park’’ the property
is not diffiuclt to work. Water for the stock is obtained from
bores, and is reticulated to all the paddocks by means of windmills.

utilises northern South Australian rams with Koorine (Victoria)

rabbit problem, and by hard work he has succeeded in getting the
property into excellent heart. Co-day one paddock or 3UU acres
will carry more than the whole property could maintain when he
first took it up.
It is of interest to note that a 30-acre paddock on this property
was this year awarded the Silver Cup presented by the S.A. Fer-
tiliser Companies for the most improved pasture for the whole of
the south-eastern district of S.A.
In addition to all the necessary outbu.ldmgs, the homestead
at "Mona Park is replete with all modern conveniences. Wizard
light is installed throughout, and sanitation is dealt with by means
of septic tanks. . , .a

ALBERT ARTHUR SASSANOWSKY
"Eldena"
MR. A. A. SASSANOWSKY'S HOMESTEAD, “ELDENA."
The name of Sassanowsky is well known throughout the
South-East. The late Mr. Friedrich Herman Sassanowsky was
among the pioneers of the district, having taken up 200 acres in
1862 of what was the original Moorak Estate. The land was in
its natural state, being heavily timbered with gums, honeysuckle,
and blackwood. It was first-class agricultural and pastoral country,
and was the commencement of a holding that was gradually extended
and improved until to-day “Eldena” is one of the show places of the
South-East, being notable particularly for its grand flock of pure
Corriedale sheep.
On the death of Mr. F. H. Sassanowsky in 1894, five sons were
interested in “Eldena” but Mr. Albert Arthur Sassanowsky is now
the only survivor among them, holding the property in conjunction
with his sister.
The homestead portion of ‘‘Eldena” is 3 1 2 acres of rich land
carrying good pastoral grasses such as clovers, black prairie grass,
speargrass, etc. In its natural state it maintained 2 sheep to the
acre. After top-dressing with super it will carry 3 to 33 sheep
to the acre. The soil is heavy black loam with a clay subsoil, also
a medium red soil in parts. An adjoining property known as
"Mella” taken up by the late Mr. K. Bors in the early days is now
part of the “Eldena” Estate. "Mella” comprised 474 acres similar
to the land on the homestead portion. Mr. Sassanowsky has
another holding of 1,167 acres at "Wandilo” about three miles
north-west from the homestead. This is middle-grade land, used
mainly for grazing and growing oats. It carries a sheep and a half
to the acre, and was originally part of the “Glencoe” Estate owned
by the Riddoch family. The total area of “Eldena” now is about
j acres
Grazing is the principal activity, although a fair quantity of
general farming is also done. Mr. Sassanowsky, who shears about
2,300 sheep each year, has a stud of 100 Corriedale ewes and one
ram. About 40 Corriedale rams are kept to mate with comeback
and Corriedale ewes. The fat lambs produced are used for export
freezing. An average lambing at “Eldena”' is 90 per cent. The


ALBERT ARTHUR SASSANOWSKY
''Eldena '
THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST PROSPEROUS FARMS IN MOUNT GAMBIER.
Corriedale rams cut 1 2 to 14 lbs. of fleece wool, and the ewes about
10 lbs. per sheep, the wool being about 56’s quality. The come-
backs cut 81 to 9 lbs. of fleece wool, the quantity depending, of
course, on the seasonal conditions.
The Corriedale is a grand sheep for the South-East. It is
really a true crossbred from the Lincoln and Merino, interbreeding
in the same strain until the progeny are true products of the two.
Mr. Sassanowsky commenced breeding them about 1910 when the
“Kanowna” station, near the Burra, was sold. He secured 12
Merino ewes from “Kanowna,” and a pure-bred Lincoln ram was
bought from Mr R. Hill, of Mount Gambier. The progeny were
bred to one another for several years. Later on Mr. Sassanowsky
bought a pure-bred Corriedale ram from Mr J. R. Guthrie, of Vic-
tona, and three years afterwards he went to Mr Guthrie for another
ra ™’ about 1923 Mr. J. R. Moodie, of Hamilton, Victoria,
Sassanowsk y a g° od Tpe Corriedale ram, and in June,
1927, a further ram, No. 348, was purchased from the same stud.
To-day Mr. Sassanowsky’s stud is practically pure, and they form a
wonderfully fine dual purpose sheep suited to all the classes of
country met with in the South-East.
For a South-Easterner, Mr. Sassanowsky goes in rather exten-
sively for agriculture. He is favored, however, in this respect as
no drainage is necessary. He usually crops between 450 and 500
acres, mainly of oats, barley, and potatoes. The general rule is to
start a paddock with potatoes, follow it with barley and oats, then
barley and oats again. The paddock is therefore under crop for
five years. It is then given a spell for four years, being grassed and
grazed.
The potatoes average about five tons to the acre, barley around
45 to 50 bushels, and oats the same. Mr. Sassanowsky has actu-
ally harvested 62 bushels of barley and 60 of oats. Portion of the
barley crop this year won the first prize for malting barley grown
within a 60 miles radius of Mount Gambier, and a third prize was
secured for barley grown within a 20 miles radius for general yield.
No fallowing of the land is practised as in the north, but the

land is twice ploughed before cropping, directly after the first rains
in the autumn. The paddocks are cultivated and sown in July
for oats, and the first week in August for barley. Potatoes are
generally put in during September and October.
Water supplies are cared for by a rainfall of 30 inches. A well
3 10 ft. deep supplies the homestead property, pipes being laid on
to the home, garden, and all paddocks. The other paddocks are
watered by 1 3 windmills. A pumping engine is installed at the
well on the homestead section, and a rotary pump draws water for
garden use, a good head being secured.
The building improvements at “Eldena” are modern and com-
plete. They are chiefly of stone and include all necessary con-
veniences for handling and storing implements. Mr. Sassanowsky
carries a full stock of machinery for farm work, not the least up-to-
date being five petrol engines ranging from to 24 horsepower.
The barns and shearing shed are in one building. There is a sub-
stantial stable for 1 1 horses, also a large chaff room and gear. Plenty

of accommodation is provided for the men, and there is a well
stocked tool shop and work room.
The homestead at “Eldena” is an imposing one. It was
rebuilt in 1921 from stone secured from the Mount Gambier
quarries. It contains 10 rooms and accessory rooms, Gloria light,
laundry conveniences, and all other modern household equipment.
It is set in a miniature forest of elms, pinus insignis, Norfolk
Island pines, cypress, blue gums, olives, oaks, and sycamores. The
house itself is protected by an African boxthorn hedge, and a pretty
flower garden thrives within it.
At ‘‘Wandilo” 50 acres of black wattle are grown, from 12 to
20 tons of bark being stripped. The wood is used for firewood or
sold. Another subsidiary industry at ‘ Wandilo” is the sale of
road metal, the local council having taken 1,000 cubic yards a year
for the past five or six years. On the “Mella” property there is a
hay shed which can accommodate 280 tons.


EDWARD WILLIAM TOLLNER "Hilton Farm”
Two and three-quarter miles west of Mount Gambier is “Hilton Farm,
a tract running into 100 acres, when the late Mr. Fritz Tollner took it up from
the Crown in the early fifties. His son, Mr. H. F. Tollner, took it over in
1 895. and in 1920. the latter’s son. Mr. Edward William Tollner, acquired it.
“Hilton Farm" was mostly covered with honeysuckle and other timber
when Mr. E. W. Tollner’s grandfather settled there. It is good agricultural
land suitable for growing cereals and excellent for dairying, which Mr. Tollner
carries on on a large scale. Natural grasses including rye grass and clovers
abound on the property.
Mr. Tollner runs about 20 good type Ayrshire milkers. He used pure-
bred bulls and has graded up to a uniformly good standard. The first stud
bull was Chieftain of Kybybolite, bred by the Government. This animal was
by Anthony of Gleneira from the dam Minna of Fernhill. The second animal
obtained was Jock of Kybybolite by Ida’s Laird of Gowrie Park, from the dam
Maggie of Kybybolite. “Ida’s Laird’’ was a reserve champion at Adelaide in
1928. He now has a young bull purchased from Victoria by Leila’s Prince
of Gowrie Park from the dam Myra of Glenayr. A pure bred cow, Myra of
Glenayr, by Fulham Donald was purchased from Mr. Wright of Drumborg, and
Coilsfield Lady was secured locally, but bred in Victoria.
Results secured through the local herd-testing association from cows bred
by Mr. J'ollner are good, as the following figures show: —Rosie of Hilton, 351
days, 12,4273 lb. of milk. 4.08 test. 506.54 butter fat. Slitter of Hilton, 317
days, 14,3403 lb. of milk, 4.08 test, 585.02 lb. butter 1 fat. Star of Hilton,
337 days, 10,463 lb. of milk, 4.72 test, 496.63 lb. of butter fat.
In 1 9 22-23 Mr. Tollner gained certificate and first place in the Mount
Gambier Herd Testing Association with the following figures:—Average size
of herd 15.84 cows, milk per cow 879.27 gallons, butter fat per cow. 385.81 lb.,
butterfat test, 4.39 per cent., milking period 313 days. This achievement

carried with it a prize of £75. In the year 1923-24, Mr. Tollner was even
more successful. In addition to gaining the first prize in the same competition,
he secured the State championship, the occasion being the first time it was
awarded in South Australia. The herd figures in that year were:—Average size
of herd. 15.74 cows, milk per cow, 1071.7 gallons, butterfat per cow 43 1.97 lb.,
buttcrfat test, 4.03 per cent., milking period 339 days. The award in
19 23-24 carried <£loo from the Mount Gambier Association and £ 100 for
State champion.
The herd has been graded up from pure-bred bulls to impart the fullest
value to the progeny, and it is kept under exceptionally good conditions.
Chou moulier is extensively used by Mr. Tollner as a cattle food, also oaten
hay and oaten chaff for dry fodder. Green maize has been tried, but chou
moulier has given better milk production. It is grown from seed and transplanted
when the plants are about eight weeks old into rows 3 ft. by 3 ft. apart to
allow for both-ways cultivation. The leaves are plucked from the bottom of
the stem to facilitate working the soil. The fodder leaves are ready for collecting
eight to ten weeks after transplanting.
Mr. Tollner also considers that chou moulier is good for sheep and pigs.
He keeps five breeding sows mostly Tamworth cross and favours using a pure
Berkshire boar with halff-Tamworth sow to produce the best bacon. Good
litters of from 12 to 14 are obtained, making into bacon pigs at 5 3 to 6
months old. weighing from 190 to 200 lb. alive, the most profitable weight
to sell at.
The estate is well improved, and for about 1 1 years the herd has been
milked by a Ridd machine. The average milk return has been £463 a year
for the past eight years.
Mr. 1 ollner cultivates about 25 to 30 acres of oats for feed purposes, averag-
ing 23t0 3 tons to the acre. The rainfall at “Hilton Farm’’ is about 3 0 inches
and water is laid on to all the paddocks from the Blue Lake' reservoir.


ABIJAR SPARROW, "Cow Hobby"
Some of the best Ayrshire cattle to be found in the south-east
are bred at “Cow Hobby,’’ a fine little holding three miles west of
Mt. Gambier owned by Mr. Abijar Sparrow. It is about 237
acres of undulating farming and grazing land and was taken up by
Mr. Sparrow in 1927. His Ayrshire herd runs into 50, with
about 5 or 6 stud animals that came from Victoria. I he animals
are particularly good types of dairy cattle and are great milk producers.
Mr. Sparrow considers the Ayrshire breed to be the hardiest for
dairy purposes, especially in a cold district like the south-east.
About 100 acres of “Cow Hobby’’ are cultivated each season,
oats being the main crop, with a little barley at times for the dozen
Tamworth pigs he keeps for bacon purposes. J here is an abundance
of natural grass, subterranean clover, trefoil etc., and the cattle are
also fed with green oaten hay. They are in excellent condition
all the year round. Tme milk product is separated, the cream
being sent to A. A. Brice H Co. Ltd. and the milk fed to the calves.
The head of the stud is Renown of the Valley, which has
gained 13 first prizes at Hamilton (Vic.)- Port Fairey (Vic.),
McArthur (Vic.), Conder (Vic.) and Mt. Gambier, including
4 championships. Renown of the Valley (2367) is white and
brown and was calved in August 26, 1918. His sire was
Belladonna’s Jamie of Ellerslie (1728), the dam being Cora of the
Valley (Vol. XIII), by Melville Johnstone (791). These are
excellent Ayshire stud lines. Renown of the Valley gained his
first prize as a yearling at Shepparton, in 1919. He came first as

GEORGE LANCELOT DEAN
"Koorine"
MANY INDUSTRIES ARE CARRIED ON AT THIS STATION.
Established in a rich district, and carrying on a number of
interesting and subsidiary industries, the estate of “Koorine,” about
two miles west of Kalangadoo, is one that anybody would be happy
to possess. Returns from it are assured, living conditions are
picturesque, and the climate is counted among the most delightful
in the State.
“Koorine” originally stretched between Glencoe and Penola,
and was called “Glencoe” station, being owned by Messrs. George
and John Riddoch. When “Glencoe” was divided into two
properties, Mr. George Riddoch took half and named it “Koorine.”
It’s 24,000 acres were occupied by him for a number of years, and
on his death, the estate was acquired by the Closer Settlement Board
which required it for the settlement of returned soldiers. The
homestead portion was not alloted under the Soldier Settlement Act,
and it was sold privately to Mr. G. L. Dean in 1920.
Mr. Dean is a fine type of settler who takes a real interest in
his property, and is never happier than when endeavouring to
achieve something further in the way of agriculture and industry
that will add to the fame of the South-East.
“Koorine” consists of 2,150 acres of agricultural and pastoral
territory, all of it flat land, about half being timbered with red gum,
white gum and blackwoods. This timber is quite an asset to Mr.
Dean, who has a contract with the Corporation of Mount Gambier

for the supply of 500 tons of timber annually for three years,
chiefly red gum posts. He also cuts redgum posts for sale to other
farmers. This side-line assists in employing labour, and is one of
the diversities of activity that help to lend charm to the life at
“Koorine.”
The soil on the estate is chiefly red loam with limestone
deposits below the surface. In some parts there is a red clay
subsoil, while in other portions inclined to be boggy, there is no
subsoil at all. The property will carry a sheep to the acre without
topdressing or planting special grasses. With super and subterannean
clover, three sheep to the acre are maintained. The chief natural
grasses were kangaroo grass (now almost extinct), English dandelion
and several tenacious native grasses. For fodder purposes Mr. Dean
grows maize, sunflowers, Sudan grass, chou molier and Kiku grasses.
He has also cultivated 300 or 400 acres of kale and rape.
The standby in fodders at “Koorine’’ is, however, subterranean
clover. Mr. Dean’s experiments with it are nothing short of an
object lesson. He has planted the huge area of 1,200 acres, and
finds it to be practically everlasting. The growth is so generous
at “Koorine” that he has been able to harvest it for sale purposes,
and in the present year, the first time sale has been attempted, there
has been an excellent demand. Subterranean clover, indeed, has
developed into quite a big portion of his industry. Mr. Dean has
installed a seed cleaning machine, and as a result he is in a position


A PICTURESQUE THATCHED ROOF CLOVER SHED AT "KOORINE.”
to supply seed in large quantities. He saw the possibilities of this
fodder right from the start and backed his opinion by huge sowings.
Mr. Dean cultivates about 250 acres each year, half wheat
and half oats, with sometimes a little barley. The average yield of
oats is 40 bushels to the acre, Algerian being preferred, although
both Lachlan and Imbros have also been sown. The wheat is
usually Zealand blue, Major and Daphne, the average going 28
to 30 bushels to the acre. Often the figures exceed this and up to
40 bushels have been taken off in a favorable season. Mr Dean
sells the grain for seed and also parcels to the mills to be turned into
flour. A good sample of oaten hay is cut, running into a couple
of tons to the acre.
'To ensure grain crops Mr. Dean selects land for planting
that is free from bog and is not low lying. Fallowing is not
practised; as a matter of fact, it is scarcely practicable now as a
regular thing. The ground is cleared and ploughed about April
or May and is cultivated at the end of May. Oats are sown in June
and the wheat crop goes in eithef in July or August. The planting
is very late compared with northern and mid-northern farms, but
the South-East is wet country, and the soil must be well worked
before sowing.
Oats planted in June have usually turned out best at “Koorine,”
and for the hay crop there is nothing better than an August sowing.
The oats are ready for cutting at the end of December, while the


A SUBTERRANEAN CLOVER STACK AND ELEVATOR USED AT "KOORINE.”
wheat is stripped late in January. Mr. Dean has found that
Algerian oats ripen a month earlier than Imbros. In all seeding
operations Mr. Dean drills in ,one cwt. of super to the acre. In a
few years he may have to fallow to clean the soil, but as it is mostly
unsown land just now, this is not yet necessary.
On an average nearly 4,000 sheep are shorn at “Koorine,” all
of them crossbreds and comebacks, comprising Romney Marsh on
merinos and Ryelands on merinos. This country always grew
merino wool until the advent of super made crossbreeding more
profitable. Experience has proved that in this part of the State at
any rate, crossbreds will cut a greater price per pound than any
other variety. The country appears to suit the crossbred far better
than it does the merino. T his has been proved over and over again
by the crossbreds raised from Romney Marshs and the hardfooted
Ryelands, being more immune against footrot than the merinos.
The necessary merino wethers can be brought in from the
northern stations, and the wool from them gradually becomes finer,
going about a 56’s count. The wool from the Kalangadoo district
is always welcomed at the auctions, and it is generally recognised to
be some of the best grown in South Australia.
Mr. Dean breeds chiefly with an eye to the fat lamb trade,
and is able to send them to market at five months old. The
Ryelands is an early maturing sheep, and consequently the crossbred
is early too. The lambs are excellent for freezing. Mr. Dean lambs

about 2,000 ewes at “Koorine” and gets an average of 85 per cent,
all reared.
The Ryelands rams on which the flock has been built up were
secured from Hellings of Tintinara. The sheep raised by these
noted studmastem have a great reputation, and most of the principal
prizes in Australia for this class were taken by them recently.
Romney Marsh rams running into 40 were purchased from Mr.
A. L. E. Spehr of “Noramanoo” another leading flockmaster. With
this stock Mr. Dean has developed a fine industry in fat lambs.
Footrot is a disease that must be guarded against in the
Kalangadoo country. The feet are inclined to grow long under
the clover and special treatment is necessary- Mr. Dean fills troughs
with an arsenical preparation and walks the sheep through it to
prevent footrot. Stomach worms are also troublesome among the
lambs, an arsenical drench being a reliable corrective.
Other livestock on “Koorine” include a few Berkshire
breeding sows and a few Illawarra milking shorthorn cattle. Both
are kept for home use only. There is a fine team of working
Clydesdales, and the usual collection of station hacks and ponies.
The poultry run is well stocked with white leghorns and black
•orpingtons.
“Koorine” is situated in oner of the wettest parts of the South-
East, the rainfall averaging no less than 32 inches. Water can be
obtained anywhere at 20 ft. below the surface. Six bores and six
wells arc on the estate, the water from the former being preferred.
There are twenty-one paddocks, and all are supplied with water
by means of windmills, tanks and troughing.
The homestead and garden at “Koorme” present a delightful
picture. The house is a fine big one constructed of the beautiful
Mount Gambier white stone. It is approached through an avenue
of shrubs and trees which provide a shady coolness in summer. In
the garden there are all kinds of decorative trees such as Norfolk
Island pines, birches, oaks, larches, silver poplars, Cootamundra
wattle, spruce, chestnuts, etc. The variety is probably larger than
can be seen in any other garden in the State. Willow trees growing
alongside a swamp add a further picturesque note to the landscape,
and hard by there is a tennis court For home use there is an
extensive area planted with stone and other fruits such as apples,
pears, plums, apricots, oranges and lemons, cherries and nectarines.
Finally, the groves of trees are completed with two acres of walnuts
which are doing well and promise good crops for marketing.
From the foregoing it will be readily understood that
“Koorine offers a diversity of interest quite unique among South
Australian mixed farms, and it is little wonder that its ownership
is highly prized by Mr. Dean. The improvements in the way of
farming facilities such as shearing sheds, shearers’ huts, men huts,
stables, haysheds, grain store, implement heds, and garages are all
substantial. “Koorine” also has its own slaughterhouse.


EDMOND OSWALD KIRBY
"Mingbool"
“ MINGBOOL” STATION WAS FOUNDED IN THE EARLY DAYS.
This station, which is eight miles north of Mt. Gambier, is
one of the big wool producers of the south-east. It goes back a
good many years, and was purchased in 1885 by Johanna Crowe,
who formerly owned “Mount Bruce” and “Reedy Creek” stations
near Robe. On her death the property was transferred to her
daughter, Miss Elizabeth Crowe, who married Mr. John Kirby
about 42 years ago. The station is now owned and managed by
their son, Mr. E. O. Kirby. The family has, therefore, been in-
timately associated with the history and development of the south-
east.
Mr. E. O. Kirby took over 10,000 acres of “Mingbool” about
10 years back. Since then he has added 3,000 acres to it, the whole
being a valuable property with a splendid carrying capacity in sheep.
It is all pastoral land, most of it flat. The chief natural
grasses are native. These have been strengthened by supering the
pastures and subterranean clover has also been planted. This fine
stock food grows readily on “Mingbool.” In addition to thriving
on the supered land it establishes itself well on the unsupered parts.
On any of the property good water can be secured at 1 5 to 20

feet, all of it suitable for domestic purposes. This plentiful supply
means that the paddocks always have a good coating of feed; indeed
"Mingbool" is considered to be the best property in the state for
summer feed. Such conditions allow a big quantity of sheep and
cattle to be carried all the year round. The rainfall is in the region
of 26 inches, and a system of windmills, one being provided for
every 1,000 acres, distributes stock water to every paddock.
Shearing at "Mingbool’’ is a busy time as no fewer than 1,700
animals go over the boards, all of them pure merinos with fleeces
going about a 64’s count. Individual sheep cut an average of 9
lb., including lambs, while the wethers will return over 10 lb. Ihe
present flock was founded in 1917 and 1918, by Mr. E. O. Kirby
by the purchase of 2,500 cast for age ewes from “Barunah Plains,"
in Victoria each year. "Wanganella" rams are put to these ewes and
the selection and care have resulted in a high standard sheep being
maintained. "Wanganella” rams have been used ever since.
Mr. Kirby has gained many successes in the ring with his sheep.
They have been exhibited at Mt. Gambier and other south-eastern
shows, winning championships and numerous other awards. The
wool is always looked for by British and Continental buyers and
it has often secured top price at the Melbourne auctions.


The facilities for handling sheep at “Mingbool are extensive,
including a wool shed that will hold 1,500 grown sheep. Six
stands are available for the shearers. The sheep are notable for
their healthiness and fine condition.
In addition to his activities in wool, Mr. Kirby has made a
study of cattle and has gone into this business on a fairly substantial
scale. With an abundance of summer feed and good fattening
grounds, he can handle large drafts of great cattle. He has herds
of pure-bred shorthorns totalling about 500, and another 300 bought
cattle are handled for fattening.
Mr. Kirby has never relaxed the “Mingbool” tradition to
improve the shorthorn cattle herd and keep it pure, only the best
best of bulls having been used since the 80’s. 1 he bulls came
chiefly from Mr. A. J. Simpson’s “Clifton” estate, near Hamilton,
Victoria, Anthony Hordern’s, Sydney, and the Metropolitan Farm,
near Werribee in Victoria. The latest bull to be secured was the
stud yearling calf Milton’s Marmion, by Collynie King Edward
(imp.) out of a champion cow in the Sydney Royal Show two
years ago, Milton’s Miranda V. The breeding ranks high in the
shorthorn stud books and the bull should bring about a further
improvement in the “Mingbool” herds.
In the old days “Mingbool” was heavily timbered with red
gum, blackwood and white gum, but most of it has now been cleared.
The homestead was erected in the 70’s and has been added to from
time to time. It is a comfortable building with many conveniences.
In addition to sheep and cattle, Mr. Kirby is interested in
thoroughbreds and has a few fine looking animals by the Grafton
stallion, Binnia. He also has a good type draught stallion and
mares for the breeding of farm and station workers.

MRS. H. W. WALSGOTT
"Fernleigh"
The chief industry at “Fernleigh,” a well kept and attractive
farm four miles west of Mt. Gambier owned by Mr. H. W. Wals-
gott, is dairying. The property was taken up in 1908 and Mr.
Walsgott now has 180 acres of undulating agricultural and farming
land from which good returns are secured.
The outstanding feature is a herd and stud of Friesian cattle,
numbering 40. The stud consists of 3 bulls, 6 cows, and 9 yearlings.
All the stud animals are registered. These big-framed black and
white cattle, which add a picturesque touch to any landscape, do
remarkably well in the south-east.
The neucleus of the stud was formed when Mrs. Walsgott
purchased a Friesian heifer from Mr. W. D. Hunt of “Bainfield,’
Waikiwi, Invercargill, New Zealand. Three cows and a bull were
also secured from Mr. A. Dahlenburg, of Winiam East, Nhill,
Victoria. All of these were stud book animals, and Mrs. Walsgott’s
enterprise was well rewarded. The New Zealand cow was
Bainfield Sylvia Pansy by Bainfield 32nd (3287 N.Z. FHB) from
Rosevale King Sylvia (1221 N.Z. FHB). Ihe cattle from Nhill
were:—

when they are fresh. All the milking is performed by machines.
The hand of Mrs. Walsgott is to be seen everywhere on
“Fernleigh” which is a particularly neat and well-kept farm.

1*
LAKE BONNY, NEAR MILLICENT.


MILLICENT
Many years ago, before the foundation of the district by white
people, Millicent was nothing more imposing than a titree swamp,
abounding with kangaroos, wallabies, wild fowl—and blacks.
The late George Glen held a large area of this district under
Crown lease, for which he paid the nominal sum of 10/ per square
mile. In 1868, the late W. A. Crouch, one of the most progressive
pioneers of the South-East, conceived the idea of draining the surplus
water from the large areas that were submerged for a great part of
the year, and suggested blasting out a section of the ranges at
Rendelsham, at the lowest portion, as a means of dispersing the
water. The Government fell in with the idea, and sent engineers to
make a rough cutting, thus releasing the impounded waters which
flowed to Lake Frome and into the sea. This was the commencement
of drainage ill the South East, and was the means of adding millions
of pounds to the value of the country.
Even after the drains had been due, settlers had rather a lean
time for some years, as the soil in some parts proved waterlogged
and sour. The Government were petitioned for relief for new
land holders, but for a time it seemed as if the reclaimation scheme
had failed.
However, the advent of fertilisers rapidly changed the whole
outlook, and from the time the first area was treated with supers,
Millicent began to move ahead. The soil badly needed the invigora-
tion of superphosphates, and responded immediately to their
application, and since that time; the farmers have never looked back.
Millicent country will now grow any variety of root crop and
cereal, and is, in addition, rich grazing land.
Average farm land, under favourable conditions, has frequently
produced 70 bushels of malting barley to the acre, 55 to 60 bushels
of wheat, and correspondingly high yields of oats and rye. Potatoes
have been grown up to 16 tons per acre. Enormous returns have
been obtained from fodder root crops, such as turnips, mangels,
rape and kale.
Since the introduction of top dressing, large areas of drained
land will carry 5 sheep to the acre all the year round. Fat lamb
and wool production are at a high standard.
Another interesting feature about Millicent is the large Govern-
ment forest, and a small private forest of pinus insignis. Further
facts of the former are contained in the general introduction at the
•commencement of this book. About six or seven miles from
Millicent is Lake Bonney, a sheet of water 15 miles long, separated
from the sea by a narrow strip of land. This lake is fast becoming
a popular resort for picnic parties. Bathing and boating are
facilitated here in most pleasant conditions, and it is forecast that
the day is not far distant when Lake Bonney will be a well-known
tourist attraction. The water is fresh, and efforts have been and
-are being made to stock it with cod and trout, and when the fish
have become fully acclimatised, the scheme will be more completely
carried out.
The town of Millicent is situated about 334 miles south-east
of Adelaide, and has a population of about 2,500 people. As the
district is very prosperous, the town shows the inevitable signs of
progress. There are three hotels, of which the Somerset Hotel may
be classed as the best, and represents a good type of country
residential public house. There are also several service stations and
motor garages, and Mayell’s Garage may certainly be recommended
as an efficient service to tourists and the travelling public. J. Mc-
Laughlin & Co. possess the largest departmental stores, and it is
intetresting to note that Mr. J. McLaughlin was one of the early
settlers in the district. Mr. R. H. Young controls the principal
store for the sale of souvenirs and photographs for tourists, and any
illustrations that appear in this publication may be obtained from
the “Central” store.
Millicent is fortunate in being provided with one of the most
efficient printing offices in the South-East, and has its own news-
paper, the “South-Eastern Times." This journal was first published
on July 1, 1891, by a store-keeper, Roland Campbell, who set up
his typ« in the cellar of his store-, and printed the paper on a midget
edition of an Eagle hand press. The first few issues were principally
a medium for advertising, and up to 1896, the journal was called
"The Millicent Times." Donald Campbell took over operations in
1896, and ran the paper as a medium for news. A chafF store in
George Street was used as printing offices, and all the timber for
the rafters and other woodwork in the building was obtained from
the wreckage of a steamer “Geltwood, which was wrecked in June,
1876, off the coast near Millicent. Donald Campbell carried on
till 1906, when some local citizens formed a company and bought
out Campbell and published the paper bi-weekly. In 1906, Mr.
R. C. Mowbray joined the staff, and in 1907 was appointed editor
and manager. By. 1922, Mr. Mowbray had acquired the majority
of the shares of the concern, and the remaining shareholders sold out
to him, thus making' him sole proprietor. The plant is now up-to-
date, and includes modern equipment of linotype and other necessary
machinery to produce a good country paper, and job printing
requirements. Orders for 1,000,000 totalisator tickets are among
the work turned out.
At Rendelsham, six miles from Millicent. there is a flourishing
chicory industry which is carried on chiefly by G. Wood Son & Co.,
of Adelaide.
The Government plantation of pinus msignis, situated at
Mount Muirhead, three miles from Millicent, are the largest in the
world. The Government plant 5,000 acres of pinus insignis every
year. At Mount Mclntyre 30-year trees were cut! and sawn recently
and the returns of cubic feet of timber per acre are acknowledged
unbeatable.

HARRY WILLIAM HART, "Geltwood”
A SECTION OF THE ORCHARD AT “GELTWOOD.”
The possibilities of the south-east as a fruitgrowing district
have been tested with wonderfully satisfactory results by Mr. Harry
William Hart, of “Geltwood,” three miles south of Millicent. The
property wag taken up in 1882, by Mr. Hart’s father, Mr. Henry
Hart, who is still living at the age of 85. The area was then a
modest 38 acres, comprising 18 acres of flat drained lands and 20
acres of sandy ridges covered with bracken. On the plain lands
there was a little native couch grass.
Little was done to the place for a number of years and it was
practically a breeding ground for rabbits; in fact, it was known as
the “rabbiters’ paradise.” In August, 1909, Mr. Henry Hart with
his sons and two hired men planted 1,500 pinus insignis and
nothing more was done to the rest of the property until 1911, when
Mr. Harry Hart acquired it from his father. The first procedure
was to fence in three acres and eradicate the rabbits. The land was
then planted with groves of apples, the varieties including Jonathan,
Dunn’s Seedling, Rokewood, Rome Beauty, Nickajack, Cleopatra
and King David. A number of other fruits were planted covering
numerous varieties of peaches, cherries, apricots, nectarines and pears.
The apples are spaced to 134 to the acre, the yield being two cases
per tree from ten year old trees. The land is given heavy dressings
of super, up to four and five cwt. per acre, also one v cwt. of sulphate
cf ammonia yearly. This process gives a good growth <sf natural
herbage principally dandelion, which is ploughed in to provide
humus in the soil.
I he soil is stirred all through summer to conserve moisture.
The sprayer is brought out in August to prevent scab, bitter pit and
shothole, Burgundy mixture being used. Mr. Hart is a great
believer in summer pruning, pip friuts being pruned in the winter.
The prunes are treated in lateral style, i.e. short spur pruning.
Mr. Hart experiments extensively with budding and grafting,
and does all the processes very thoroughly, regarding it as a hobby.
As many as eight varieties of fruit have been grafted on to one tree
(a seedling pear), four varieties of apples (Rokewood, Nickajack,
Crab apple, and Caroline Red June), three varieties of pears (Black
Aschon, Beurre bosc and Duchess) and double crimson hawthorn.
T here is a ready market for the fruit among residents of the district.
Mr. Hart has a small nursery of pinus insignis, pinus Halepensis, and pinus.
pinea. Other trees include: Gomophilia odorata (South Australian peppermint),
hemipholia (West Australian white gum) , and Botryoides (bastard mahogany).
In all tnere are about 150 gums at "Geltwood" and 10 varieties of wattle comprising.,
acacia Baileyana (Cootamundra wattle), acacia decora, acacia data (cedar wattle),
acacia pyenantba (golden wattle), acacia podaliaefolia (Queensland stiver wattle),
acacia normalia (queen wattle), acacia longafolia (canary yellow wattle), and
Hakea eucalyptoides. There are also a couple of acres of casuarinas (shea-oaks)
at "Geltwood.” The average rainfall is 29 inches. There is a 35 ft. deep
bore on the property, and a Metters 8 ft. Nuoil windmill is used chiefly for
stock water and the flower garden.
Mr. Hart has a further 235 acres known as “The Wyric” and is interested
in sheep, running a flock of about 450 comeback merinos, for the wool and
fat lamb trade. He has the distinction of once having obtained the highest
price in the district for wethers at 55/6 per head. His highest price for six
months old lambs was the excellent figure of 3 5/. The comeback wool averagse
103 lb. per sheep. Mr. Hart can maintain up to three sheep to the acre
without any trouble. A few milch cows are kept, also fat heifers of Hereford
and shorthorn strain.
Mr. Hart was one of the first to recognise the value of top-dressing with'
super, using 45 per cent. Needless to say all his neighbours were sceptical about
the venture, but since he came second for two years in succession for the cup
donated by the Phosphate Association they have all been converted to its use.
The previous year the cup was won by Mr. Cowan, of Hatherleigh, and this
year by Mr. Caine, of Kongorong.
An interesting section of the holding is the apiary where there are 45
colonies of bees which return about 40 lb. of honey each and 2 lb. of beeswax.
The flower garden at "Geltwood” is attended to by Mrs. Hart in the same
systematic method that Mr. Hart applies to the orchard. Numerous varieties of
blooms are grown, the display in spring and summer being magnificent.


SOUTH-EASTERN PIONEERS
The Holzgrefes of "Blue Gum Park" and "Wannonleigh"
It had been decided by the publishers of “Industries of the
South East” that this work should be entirely industrial, rather
than personal. In the instance of Mr. H. F. L. Holzgrefe, however,
it has been decided to make a notable exception to the rule. There
is probably not a more interesting personality in the whole of the
South East to-day than this gentleman, and being the oldest
surviving pioneer in the Millicent district, it is felt that a complete
sketch of the lives of the Holzgrefe family, from the early days of
their arrival in South Australia, will give a very real indication of
what the pioneers of this State went through.
Though well over 80 years of age, Mr. Holzgrefe still retains
•every faculty, and even now takes an active part in the working of
his estate, which is located about 2 miles south-east of Millicent.
Mr. Heinrich Holzgrefe was born at Hankensbital, Germany,
in November 1846, where he lived for about 8 years, receiving portion
of his early education at a “Cloister School,” and obtaining a
certificate to the effect that he could “read well, and was a diligent
scholar.” This certificate is still in his possession.
About this time, Mr. Holzgrefe’s father decided to migrate
to America, and set off with his family to the new land. On
arrival at Hamburg, however, he came in contact with a British

MR. HEINRICH F. L. HOLZGREFE.

Agent lecturing on Australia, who spoke in glowing terms of the
newly discovered gold mines. This was a red letter day for the
Holzgrefe family, and although many friends tried to dissuade them
from going to such little known parts of the world, the grand old
pioneer determined that Australia should be his goal. On July
14th, 1854, the family departed on the sailing ship “Lawrence,”
and after being on the water for 114 days, arrived at Port Adelaide
on November 5.
Mr. Holzgrefe senior had been a well-to-do wheel-wright in
his own land, and he took with him most of the portable tools of
his trade, his wife also bringing spinning wheel, weaving tools,
and the combs and iron work of her loom. The latter, however,
were never used in Australia.


W. F. L. HOLZGREFE & SON
At that time, the family consisted of two boys and three girls,
and they all set out for Hahndorf (now known as Ambleside,
about 20 miles east of Adelaide) where Mr. Holzgrefe obtained
work at his trade at the modest salary of £ 1 per week. Heinrich
was once more sent to school to continue his scholastic training,
while his brother and sisters obtained various positions.
After some months of progress, during which the family moved
to Macclesfield and thence to Blumberg (now Birdwood) the father
started in business on his own account as a wheelwright in the
latter town. However, he had not been there long when glowing
accounts were heard of Mount Gambier, so the home and business
were sold, and yet another move was made. In 1875 they sailed
from Port Adelaide in a little coastal steamer, “The Ant,” and duly
arrived at Robe, then known as Guichen Bay. After waiting eight
days for a conveyance, which was nothing more imposing than a
bullock dray, they set off on their journey of over 80 miles, passing
through country which Mr. Heinrich Holzgrefe afterwards purchased,
and still holds.
Mr. Holzgrefe had been told to take plenty of money with
him to Mount Gambier as currency was very scarce, and on arrival
he found this to be only too true. The land was fertile, and the
products excellent, but financially, the district was in a bad state.
There were no banks in existence, consequently overdrafts were
unheard of in those parts, and practically the only form of tender
was by means of 1.0.U.’5, with which financial transactions were
settled.
Soon after his arrival at Mount Gambier, the father purchased
half an acre of land at Gambier East, in what is now called Charles
Street, and while he plied his trade, the two sons sank a well 90 ft.
deep. They dug a pit nearby, and burned a kiln of lime with
wood, of which there was a plentiful, natural supply. They built
a four-roomed concrete house with the material taken from the well.
After a few years, the frugality and perseverance of the Holzgrefe
family resulted in their being the owners of several head of dairy
cattle, which had the freedom of adjacent lands for grazing purposes.
These conditions became inconvenient, however, for the free land
soon became congested with stock. A relative by the name of
Schultz, who had taken up land at Tahara, in the Western districts
of Victoria, offered to depasture as many of Mr. Holzgrefe’s cattle
as he could send across the border, the country being reported to be
a veritable Paradise of fodder. Mr. Holzgrefe, therefore, started
off with eight of the surplus stock in company with his son,
Heinrich. It was a wintry morning in July, in one of the wettest
of years, and to cross the seventy miles to Tahara required considerable

fortitude. The drovers were well paid later, however, for the young
stock made rapid progress.
In 1863, Mr. Holzgrefe senior and his son, William, selected
land at Muntham, and removed thence while Heinrich and his sister
(Mrs Krummel) remained at Mount Gambier. The other members
of the family took up residence on the selections, and they were able
to stock their properties with many of the young cattle, above-
mentioned, which had developed into milch cows and bullocks. Mr.
Holzgrefe senior died at Muntham at the age of 87 years, a most
successful farmer who had done much to establish the district.
When the land was thrown open at Muntham, it was disposed
of under the ballot principle. The names of all the applicants were
placed in a box, drawn out in turn, and the selectors named had the
right to nominate the areas they desired. This land had to be
paid for at the rate of £ 1 per acre, up to 640 acres. Mr. William
Holzgrefe’s name was the 17th drawn out of the box, which
contained 4,000, and he subsequently chose his land and became a
successful farmer. The lots were paid for in eight instalments of
2/6 per acre per annum.
The terms and conditions were so liberal that those people
who had selected land in Millicent and other South Australian
districts became dissatisfied with their own existing circumstances,
and their agitation was successful in persuading Parliament to pass
the Catt’s and subsequent Acts which were the means of putting
many_Millicent farmers on their feet,

r ' Krummel. who conducted a general blacksmith and implement
manufacturing business. During slack seasons, Heinrich used to go
? ut amon 8 tha farmers : and frequently assisted them in general
farm worI J and harvesting. In those days hand reaping was in
v ??™’ , and . H emnch sometimes earned more in one day with the
sickle than he would ordinarily do in a week at his own trade.
During his occupation at the “smithy,” he frequently came in
contact with many of the old pioneers. Such personalities as “Big
Clarke” of Mt. Schanck, “Archie” Johnson of Mt. Graham, George
Glen of Mayura, Mackinnon of Mingbool, and others were well
known to him, and on one occasion,, while on Livingston and
McFayden’s station, he saw Adam Lindsay Gordon riding buck-
jumpers. Soon after this, Gordon stood for Parliament, and
addressed a meeting of electors at one of the hotels, but they did not
take kindly to his political ideas, and subjected him to much good-
natured banter. At this reception, he told them he would not
waste his breath on politics, and instead recited some of his own
poetty, which was much more to their liking.


During bis spells from blacksmithing, Mr. Heinrich Holzgrefe
ofte* worked for Messrs. Sassanowsky, and C. Blume, and as they
were good and successful farmers, he considered his experience with
them a good education, which was proved by ultimately standing
him in good stead when he afterwards became a farmer himself.
In November, 1872, Mr. H. F. L. Holzgrefe left Mr. Krummel’s
employ and selected land on the Millicent flats, where he built his
home and spent the greater part of his life. When he first settled
on the land he had his brother, William with him, working on a
share basis, but the class of country did not appeal to the latter,
and he left for Victoria, where he afterwards settled and prospered.
Mr. Holzgrefe was severely criticised for his selection, which
was considered of very poor quality. As evidence of the uninviting
appearance of the land in its natural condition, the adjoining section
remained unoccupied for about two years, but was subsequently
purchased by the late James Bird. Soon after Mr. Bird had pitched
camp, Mr. George Glen happened along and enquired of Mr.
Holzegrefe who he was, and what he proposed to do there. On
learning that Mr. Bird intended farming, he declared that he must
be mad to think of working such land, and as for himself, he
would sooner go to the Stockade. Mr. Holzgrefe had more than a
suspicion that he was also included in Mr. Glen’s thoughts!
However, he was not to be deterred, and all the comments
were allowed to pass unheeded. Nevertheless, in spite of his
indomitable spirit, Mr. Holzgrefe experienced—to use his own words
—“a rough time of it.” There were no roads, no bridges, no sea
port, and, what was even worse, no feed; morever, the land was
’coasty” in spring-time, and bleak and boggy in winter. At the
same time his horses had to be sent to Mt. Gambier at intervals to
recuperate. Jhe conditions under which the land was selected
were difficult when capital was limited. Interest had to be paid
three years in advance, on the amount of purchase money. J o
some men, this meant a severe task, but they hoped the land was
good enough to warrant it.
As a matter of fact, the first crops were usually good, the second
much less so, and the third in succesion was largely composed of
sow and Scotch thistles. The first harvests were generally hand-
reaped or stripped, but the old back delivery was then a new
invention. It was driven by a lad, and a man sat and raked the grain
on to a hinged board, which, when the full sheaf was gathered,
was tipped by the feet and swept off the board with a rake. These
sheaves had to be hand-bound and when thistles were plentiful,
the binders had a bad time of it. All sorts of gloves were used to
mitigate the trouble.
THE EXCELLENT PASTURES OF THE SOUTH-EAST.


THIS VIEW SHOWS SOME OF THE STOCK ON “WANNONLEIGH."
Some of the men fared so badly in their farming industry
that they had to accept petty contracts to augment their incomes,
by working in the drains and at other jobs. Hence, it was not
surprising that they agitated for relief under an amended purchase
agreement. Inspectors came round iat frequent intervals to see
that residence and cultural conditions were complied with. I hey
measured up the fences, and sometimes poked their noses further
into the farmers’ business than they had need or right to do. The
examiners came round, and under threats of prosecution, forced the
farmers to cut the thistles within their holdings, and yet the adjacent
open lands were covered so thickly that in places stock could not
force their way through them. Stock had not up to that time
taken to eating the flower heads, which eventually mitigated the
pest. In those days the breaking up of the land had to be carried
out with a single furrow plough, drawn by four strong horses, and
so rough was the work, that it was no uncommon thing to see
horses with “slipped’’ shoulder blades.
The extension of land settlement brought an increased demand
for implements, and as Mr. Holzgrefe had created by this time quite
a large secondary industry in the form of a smithy, it was soon
found that larger and more conveniently situated premises were
necessary. Therefore, a blacksmith s shop was erected on the town
acre purchased by Mr. Holzgrefe at the second sale of the town
blocks. He had, by this time, married, and so he was able to leave
his wife in charge of the farm while he attended to his business in
the town.
After five years of town life, the call of the land made itself
felt, and selling the smithy to Messrs. Clayfield and McGinty, he
went back to the farm and put his whole energy into it. Of all
the original selectors of land under the first issue, Mr. Holzgrefe
is now the sole survivor. His land was selected at £2 per acre,
and was not surrendered under the Catt’s Act, as were the higher
priced lands near by.
At all times, he has been resourceful and energetic, and such
a condition as a 44 hours week was not included in his routine. In
the early days, Millicent was served by ketches, landing goods at
the South-end (Graytown) and at times there were long intervals
between arrivals. When Mr. Holzgrefe’s first home was being erected,
a meeting was called in Millicent at the Somerset Hotel, which at
that time had not received it’s- license. It was the first public
meeting he held, in Millicent, and its rendevous was a room at
the back of the present bar.
The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the questions of
getting the Government to make the worst parts of the road to


FAT SHEEP AT "BLUE GUM PARK.”
South-end, and to have it proclaimed a Port. Mr. Holzgrefe and
his brother attended. The result of the meeting was that Rivoli
Bay was proclaimed a Port, and the worst parts of the roads were
attended to, afterwards being put upon the schedule of main roads.
The next meeting was to consider the question of having the
district brought under the District Council’s Act. Dr. Wehl was
in the chair. The majority of the meeting was against the proposal,
which was finally dismissed.
With the exception of the old home section Mr.
Holzgrefe did not obtain any land from the Government
nor any through the Land Board. As he prospered, he acquired
more land, but always by purchase, until he ultimately owned
4,000 acres. Later, being convinced that it would be better to
concentrate upon a smaller area, he sold the greater portion of his
estate, and, taking his son into partnership, intensely farmed the
reduced acreage. The result is, that for many years his home and
the adjacent buildings have been the model farm and picturesque
property of the district.
At a time when farm operations were by no means bright, a
suggestion was put forward to commence a cheese factory. Up to
this period, South Australia had been largely dependant upon New
Zealand for her supplies. Tantanoola was first in the field, but soon
the Murrimbim Factory was in operation, and for a time it flourished
in a most remarkable manner, a first dividend of 6/6 in the pound
being paid to all shareholders. Mr. Holzgrefe was one of the first
shareholders. This Company was the first in South Australia to
export butter to England.
The advent of the cheese factory made a marked improvement
in the financial conditions of many who had previously led hard
lives. But the success achieved induced so many others to establish
factories that before long this market was glutted. During a long
period of great distress to the Murrumbim company, Mr. Holzgrefe
was a veritable tower of strength, and from a condition of actual
bankruptcy, he was instrumental in putting it on a sound basis once
more.
Mr. Holzgrefe was a valued member of the A. H. and P.
society, and occupied the chair on more than one occasion. He was
also elected a member of the Drainage Board, an institution formed
in lieu of a District Council, but with a much higher status in some
respects. Mr. Holzgrefe was always a great advocate of draining the
South-East, and is popularly regarded as the father of the scheme.
The Board continued its existence for seven years, but
the ratepayers considered the old-fashioned district council more
suitable, and, after considerable agitation, it was passed out. Mr.
Holzgrefe was elected on the new District Council, and continued
in office for many years. It was during his term that the land on
which the office now stands was purchased and the first Council
Chamber built. For a long time Millicent had been without an
Assembly Hall, but when Mr. Holzgrefe’s blacksmiths’ shop was
sold, he built an Exchange Hall, in which auction sales were
conducted. This building also became requisitioned as the Public
Hall of the town, and was utilised by several denominations as a
place of worship. It was the first home of the Presbyterians.
Prior to the time when the Institute was built, the old Exchange
Hall was a most cosmopolitan building, being used for church
services, concerts and dances, auction mart, skating rink and many
other purposes, until taken over as a business premises. The
proprietor, however, failed to make progress, and the establishment
fell into the hands of Mr. Holzgrefe, who for some time conducted
a business as storekeeper, the site now being occupied by the
Eudunda Farmers’ Co-operative Society. When the building was
erected, the plate glass utilised for the show windows was said to
have been the largest consignment of the kind ever sent out of the
City to the South-east.
Mr. Holzgrefe has been a member of the A. H. and P. Society
since it’s inception, and has given varied and valuable assistance to
that body. On many occasions he has filled the position of judge
at shows, but probably his best work for the district has been in
connection with the Agricultural Burea of which he is a foundation
member. He was one of the first farmers in the district to use
superphosphate. Previous to the advent of fertilisers, farming had
drifted to a very second-rate industry. Some of the first crops
yielded, on well worked land, as high as 35 bushels to the acre,


but each succeeding crop gave diminished returns, and eventually,
before manures were used, only one crop in three years was
practicable.
Barley growing was formerly unknown. A block of Mr.
Holzgrefe’s land would only yield moderate crops on the triennial
plan, but after treatment with super, barley returned up to 60
bushels to the acre, and cropped 8 years out of 9, the last year being
actually the best.
At Mr. Holzgrefe’s home property, land has been under
cultivation for 15 years in succession, and even now shows no signs
of giving out. During a recent season, the first prize of £25, donated
by Mr. J. McLaughlin, was awarded to one of the plots of Messrs.
Holzgrefe U Son, which was adjudicated by one of the experts
from Kybybolite as being the cleanest and best crop of the 37
entries.
The farm is one of the picture spots of the district. The
well kept fruit and vegetable gardens are a credit to those who tend
them. The combination stable, barn, shearing and chaff shed under
one span of roof is worth going a long way to see.
The neatness and order within are meticulous, and the same
applies to all the other buildings within and without. Though Mr.
Holzgrefe is probably the wealthiest farmer in the district, he is by
no means ashamed of his humble beginning. He has remarked “we
first went to church in a German waggon, then in a spring dray,
next in a buggy, and now in a motor car.” Mr. Holzgrefe was
always a believer in a local newspaper, and when Mr. Roland
Campbell commenced a small local journal in 1888, called “The
Millicent Times,” he was keenly interested. This later sold out to
an opposition paper, and the name was changed to “The South-
Eastern Times.”
For several years, Mr. Holzgrefe was on the Board of the
Company, and was looked upon by some of his co-directors as

the Rich Uncle ’ of the concern. Later, when a new manager
became appointed, and the paper was produced under much advanced
conditions, Mr. Holzgrefe and the other shareholders sold out to
him, and the manager thus became the proprietor. The advent of
this paper probably did more to make the district what it is than
any other factor, as, through various articles written by Mr. Holzgrefe
the farmers were able to adopt new method® in their industries.
As a final word it may be stated that there is probably not
another district in South Australia that can point out one of its
residents and state that it owes most of its progress to the untiring
energy and enterprise of that man. Yet this is so with Millicent.
and Mr. Hienrich Holzgrefe, a great pioneer, whose name will go
down in the annals of the State among those of men who battled
hard and won through in the days when their influence was so
urgently needed.


"Blue Gum Park” and
“Wannonleigh”
The above properties aggregate 1,000 acres of agri-
cultural and pastoral land, and on it Messrs. Holzgrefe and
Son have provided something of an object lesson of what can be
done in grain growing where the soil is suitable. It is all flat
country, and a small area of about 60 acres is sown each year at
“Blue Gum Park.’’ A similar quantity is cultivated at "Wannon-
leigh.
Barley is the principal crop, but wheat is also put in the
average yield of which is 40 bushels. The barley goes from 45
to 50 bushels, and one year it panned out at the remarkable figure
of 55 bushels. From 15 to 20 acres of oats are grown for hay
purposes, and is mixed with the wheat. Huff's Imperial and Bunyip
are relied on for grain, and Duckbill malting barley. The hay
cut goes 24 tons to the acre. Except for any surplus there might
be, the hay is all used for fodder purposes.
The soil from which these fine returns are secured is a black
to grey friable loam. The subsoil is gravel through which surface
water soaks easily. Were it not for this, the land could not be
utilised for crops unless artificial drains were constructed.
Prior to the use of supers, the natural grasses were dandelion,
ribbed grass, silver grass, and various clovers, but as in other parts
of the south-east, the manuring has brought along a fine selection
of other clovers, also rye grass. Messrs. Holzgrefe and Son have
also cultivated perennial rye grass as a stock fodder which they find is
excellent for the purpose. It has the further advantage of being
usable as hay. The pastures are topdressed at the rate of 1 cwt to
the acre. Portion of them are treated every season, but a year is
skipped in some cases. A Federal manure spreader is used, also a
Dobbie fertiliser broadcaster. A combine has been employed with
good results.
The rainfall is around the 29 inch mark. Windmills and bores
are established in every paddock, a full supply of water for stock
being arranged by means of an extensive troughing system. Salt licks
are provided in every paddock, Wagstaff's mixture also being used
as a lick. These have proved excellent in assisting to keep the sheep
healthy.
The annual shearing at “Blue Gum Park" and “Wannonleigh”
runs into about 1,110 mostly comebacks, but with some
crossbreds. The Lincoln-merino cross is used. The comebacks
produce a dual purpose sheep that gives good returns in wool and
mutton. The crossbreds are utilised principally for fat lambs. The
MR. H. E. HOLZGREFE'S RESIDENCE AT MILLICENT.
clip averages about 9 lbs. per sheep including the lambs. All the
fat lambs are trucked direct to Adelaide, and it speaks well for the
quality of the consignments that they have frequently topped the
fat lamb market.
The carrying capacity of “Blue Gum Park” and “Wannon-
leigh is easily three sheep to the acre all through the year. The sheep
do not harbour parasites, and are remarkably free from disease
generally. This is due in great measure to the extreme care which
Messrs. Holzgrefe and Son exercise. Dipping is carried out once a
year, a month after shearing, to guard against tick and lice.
There is a shorthorn bull on the estate and 40 to 50 head of
cattle are regularly stocked for fattening and general dealing. A
fair quantity of maize is raised for the stock. The land grows
maize readily, and it also provides all the potatoes that are needed
for domestic use.
The improvements and outbuildings are extensive. A combined
stable and woolshed is built of stone and iron, the shearing floor
being used for grain stacking when not otherwise in use. There is
a stone cowshed and barn, and a hayshed capable of accomodating
about 40 tons. A tool house is provided to take care of all farm
implements, and there are also extensive men quarters. A motor
garage is available at both homesteads, Mr. Holzgrefe jun. living in
a fine residence in Millicent.


MORRIS HART
"Cherryville" and "The Pines"
By the majority of people the South-East of South Australia
is regarded as almost solely a sheep raising proposition. The
industries possible in this territory are legion, not the least of them
being the cultivation of all classes of fruits. Mr. Henry Hart,
among others, has proved this on his old homestead, "1 he Pines,”
now occupied by his grandson (Mr. E. H. T. Hart), and it has
been further proved by his son, Mr. Morris Hart, at "Cherryville.
The latter is a well-improved property four miles south of Millicent.
"The Pines” is three miles from Millicent.
'The Pines” was taken up by his father, Mr. Henry Hart
about 1873. It was then virgin Crown land, and Mr. Henry Hart
proceeded to clear a few acres of flat country with the idea of
establishing an orchard. The timber comprised shea-oaks, honey-
suckle, and dead gums. At the same time he built a flour mill in
Millicent, the only one ever erected there, and operated it for over
30 years.
Mr. Hart sold the mill and went on with the orchard, also
farming and grazing on eight other sections of 742 acres. He
was a great experimenter in artificial manures, and had the distinc-
tion of being the first to start the Belgian Relief Fund in South
Australia at the outbreak of the War.
Mr. Hart senior divided his property among his family, Mr.
Morris Hart acquiring two sections of grazing land, one section of
heavy land for grain growing, and two homestead sections, on one of
which he has planted an orchard. The orchard was commenced
in 1903.
The whole of the ‘‘Cherryville’’ estate owned by Mr. Morris
Hart is now 446 acres of which about 10 acres is devoted to
gardening. On the property there are some orange trees planted
by his father over 25 years ago. They were raised from seedlings and
are therefore South-Eastern oranges purely. The trees seem to adapt
themselves more readily to the climate when raised from seed than
when secured from a nursery.
A feature of the place is a 54-year-old walnut tree, the boughs
of which cover a spread of 60 feet. The principal crop is cherries,
with apricots, apples, pears, plums, walnuts, and a large number of
other varieties of fruit, including oranges, grapes, citrons, limes,
lemons* etc. Water is supplied to the garden by a bore and wind-
mill, the average rainfall in the district being 30 inches.
Mr. Hart stocks about 500 comeback merinos for market
purposes, and a few dairy cattle are maintained for home supplies.
The homestead is picturesquely situated in a garden surrounded by
trees.
The land varies from sandy to heavy sticky clay, and to ashey
soil. Mr. Hart has proved that the possibilities of fruit growing
in the South-East are unlimited if market facilities are provided.
In addition to fruit the soil is specially adapted to the production
of potatoes.

FREDERICK. T. CLIFFORD, "Worboop"
This property, which is a well-known one in the Millicent
district, was taken up by Mr. Frederick T. Clifford’s father, the late
Mr. Thomas Clifford, about 50 years ago. The area then was
only 250 acres, chiefly flat land, all of which was in its natural state.
The growth of honeysuckle was particularly thick, white gums,
Cutting grass, and yaccas were plentiful, and there were portions
carrying ti-tree. Sturdy native grasses, however, indicated that the
land would pay well for clearing.
Mr. Clifford, Senr., had a hard task in getting it cleared.
and farming facilities generally in those days were nothing like
they are to-day. I imes were so bad and the work so unremunera-
tive at the start that Mr. Clifford took on wool carting contracts, and
also carried goods from South End to Millicent, a distance of about
18 miles. This helped him to tide over, and gradually the hold-
mg prospered.
His son, Mr. F. T. Clifford, acquired Worboop about 10
years ago, but prior to this he had other properties adjoining, and
the estate now covers the substantial area of 4,300 acres of grazing
and agricultural country. 4 here is plenty of feed available. The
principal natural grasses are barley, prairie, tussocks, etc.
Mr. Clifford has further improved the pasturage by sowing rye
grasses and clovers which have been top-dressed and cultivated in
the sown parts. Supering the paddocks causes a vast increase in
THIS IS SPLENDID GRAZING COUNTRY.
the herbage, and the practice is adopted pretty generally throughout
the South-East. The best paddocks at “Worboop” will main-
tain a sheep and a half to the acre, the average being three sheep to
four acres.
Mr. Clifford stocks about 3,000 merinos and comebacks, mostly
for wool, although he produces a few fat lambs. The sheep usually
cut from 9 to 10 lbs. of wool each, which is of good type, medium
fibre, and roughly 64’s quality. His prices at the sales are always
well up.
An average of 80 head of cattle are run, mixed breeds for
fattening purposes, although a few extra prime beef shorthorns are
also kept. All the stock are of excellent type, and Mr. Clifford is
quick to eliminate anything that is not up to standard in its class.
The cropping on the agricultural portions of “Worboop” is
mostly barley, with a little wheat and oats occasionally. From
150 to 200 acres are sown, one year in every three or four years being
missed. Where the soil is well worked with super, and is given
othei< treatment, there is really no need to spell it at all.
“Worboop’’ enjoys an average annual rainfall of 30 inches so
that water is no trouble. In common with the rest of the South-
East, winter brings somewhat of a surplus of water, and further
drainage throughout is essential before this territory will reach the
peak in production.


FREDERICK T. CLIFFORD, "Worboop"
SOME OF THE CATTLE ON “WORBOOP.”
Windmills are erected in every paddock at “Worboop,” and
bores from 10 ft. to 15 ft. deep supply water to a large number of
troughs. Water is obtainable at only 6 ft. to 10 ft. from the
surface. As there are no fewer than 14 paddocks it will be seen
that first-class provision has been made on the estate for water
reticulation.
The fencing is chiefly stringy bark and red gum posts, which
carry five plain wires and sometimes an additional barb. Portion
is six plain wires, and more than half the outside fences are wire-
netted to keep out rabbits. Altogether there are 15 miles of netting
on “Worboop.”
The old homestead is now occupied by Mr. F. T. Clifford’s
son, who recently married and has begun grazing and farming on
his own account. Mr. Clifford himself has a fine new home in
Millicent of bungalow style, with an attractive flower garden and a
large croquet lawn. The home is tastefully furnished, and contains
every modern convenience.
Mr. F. T. Clifford is a valued member of the Millicent District
Council. Before marriage he tried his luck on the Western Austra-
lian goldfields in 1899, and was for several years in the Boulder and
Kalgoorlie districts. The search was not successful, and he returned
to Millicent and settled on his father’s property.
MR. F. T. CLIFFORD’S RESIDENCE.


ADOLPH LOUIS EDWARD SPEHR
"Noramanoo”
THE “NORAMANOO” HOMESTEAD.
The Spehr family are numbered among the pioneers of the
South-East. The late Mr. Louis Spehr, father of Mr. Adolph
Spehr, was one of the first three to settle on the Millicent flat after
its drainage in the early seventies. In 1887, immediately after the
Reedy Creek drain had been cut, Mr. Louis Spehr secured the first
lands made available for settlement, portion of which included
“Noramanoo," two miles east of Lurner. Most of the country
acquired was a wilderness of timber, principally honeysuckle, pepper-
mint gum, and a few red gums. It maintained only one sheep to
three acres.
Mr. Adolph Spehr was in partnership with his father for a
number of years, but in 1910 he started on his own account with
1,450 acres of the "Noramanoo'' pastoral lands. He has since
added extensively to the property which now embraces 3,800 acres,
of low-lying drained land. T he chief natural grasses are white
tussock, barley grass, kangaroo grass, and other natural swamp
growths.
When Mr. Spehr first went there, the land was very heavily
timbered, but except for a small area it is now all cleared. To
improve the pasturage, rye grass, cocksfoot, subterranean and other
clovers including red clover and white Dutch clover, have been sown
and are kept well supered.
In its uncultivated state the country could not support a sheep
to the acre. With careful cultivation and top dressing much of it is
capable of carrying three sheep to the acre all the year round. Irt


picked spots near the homestead, Mr. Spehr has actually maintained
-seven sheep to the acre from June to December.
T he average annual rainfall at “Noramanoo” is around 25
inches, and all the paddocks are well watered by means of windmills
and bores. There are 27 paddocks in all, fenced mostly with wire-
netting and spring coil fencing except the larger paddocks which are
post and wire.
“Noramanoo” shears a little over 4,000 sheep, about 3,000 of
which are Merino-Romney Marsh comebacks, which Mr. Spehr
specially breeds. The remaining thousand are pure bred Romneys.
The Romney ewes clip up to 17 lb., the average being 11 to 12
lb. according to the season, with the cut from the rams going up to
21 lb. The wool is about a 46 count, being notable for very long
stable, up to 8 inches. In a few years it is expected to shear 6,000
sheep.

MR. A. L. E. SPEHR’S STUD "ROMNEY MARSH” RAM,
BOLARS No. 9
The flock was founded in 1915, with 13 ewes from Messrs
Feuerheerdt Bros., “Crower” Station, at Lucindale. These ewes
were in lamb, some of them to “Nobleman,” a high quality ram
breed by Gray Bros., of Masterton, New Zealand, and others to
“Expectation,” which was bred at “Crower.” In 1916, Mr. Spehr
purchased three more stud ewes from “Crower,” further strengthening
the stud with a specially selected stud ewe with a ram lamb at foot
from the station of Mr. A. E. T. Payne of Lilydale, Victoria.
Mr. Spehr did not rest with these importations. He aimed at
the very best and in 1917, he looked to New Zealand for more new
blood. The executors of the estate of the late Mr. John Holms,
of Waimahaka offered quality sheep that Mr. Spehr thought would
do well in the South-East and he procured 31 stud ewes of their
breeding. At the same time he added a line of 23 ewe lambs from
Messrs. V. H. H W. H. Yelland, “Treverder,” Newlyn, Victoria.


"ROMNEY MARSH” LAMBS, FIVE MONTHS OLD,
BRED AND FATTENED AT " NORAMANOO.”
Finally, in 1919, Mr. Spehr purchased the whole of the “Crower”
stud flock of 205 ewes, 54 ewe lambs, and 28 ram lambs, also the
stud ram Marvel 111.
As the result of his enterprise and knowledge as a flockmaster,
Mr. Spehr has built up a Romney stud that is well known through-
out Australasia. It is recognised as one of the leading Romney
Marsh studs in the Commonwealth, Mr. Spehr attributes a good
deal of the credit of bringing it up to such a fine standard to Bolaro
No. 9, a ram showing all the best characteristics of the Romney
type.
In 1927, Mr. Spehr gained championship honours for south-
eastern wool against all breeds with fleeces from his Romney flock.
He has been exhibiting since 1921, and has never been beaten in
Adelaide. Success has also come his way in the Melbourne shows
where he exhibited from 1921 to 1926. In that period he was a
prizetaker every year, and secured the award for ram’s fleece every
time he entered. In 1923, he established something of a record
by taking half the prizes offered in competition with the leading
breeders of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. This
wool was shown for selection for the British Empire Exhibition,
1924-25, at Wembley, England, where Mr. Spehr was awarded
two bronze medals and two certificates.
The homestead at “Noramanoo” is pleasantly situated amidst
a tract of pinus insignis, with a well cared for flower garden and
tennis court. The homestead was built on a site known as the old
cattle camp, Noramanoo” being the native equivalent for “our
camp.”
Mr. Spehr has been a regular exhibitor of stud sheep at the
Mount Gambier and Millicent shows for many years, invariably
securing premier awards. He has never been beaten in the class
for “pen of fat sheep.” A registered herd 1 of high-class stud Red
Poll cattle is also maintained by him.

HENRY EDWARD EY, "Redbank"
“Redbank” is situated miles south of Millicent. It was
taken over by the late Frederick A. O. Ey, over forty years ago,
his son, Mr. H. E. Ey, came into possession in 1914. The area
was originally 151 acres of agricultural and pastoral lands. It now
runs into about 300 acres of well-drained productive country.
The soil varies from heavy black to red loam, and to light
grey. The heavy black soil is about 3 feet deep with a gravelly
subsoil. Clay is the subsoil in the light grey land. Clovers, dry
grass, dandelions, barley grass, Mother Dutton, and Kentucky blue
grass are the chief natural fodders, also patches of strawberry clover.
All the land is top dressed with 90 lbs. tq 1 cwt. of super, and
it maintains two sheep to the acre all the year round.
Mr. Ey crops about 70 acres every season. The barley
averages 50 bushels, and he has actually cropped over 80 bushels
per acre. The cut of oats for hay runs to about three tons per
acre.
Mr. Ey stocks 400 to 500 of Lincoln and Dorset Horn cross
ewes. He has a stud of 80 odd Dorset Horn sheep of particularly
fine type, and bred from some of the best studs. The stud was
founded in 1923 from 12 ewes and a ram obtained from Mr. W. S.
Kelly of “Merrindie,” Giles Corner. The ram was “Merrindie
105/’ In 1925 Mr. Ey secured “Merrindie 180“ by the imported
ram “Symonsbury 264.” In 1928 he selected a ram “Newbold 9“
from the Newbold stud of Mr. W. J. Dawkins, Gawler River,
.and he purchased a further ewe from Mr. W. S. Kelly in 1927.
SOME OF MR. EY'S DOREST HORN STUD SHEEP.
MR. H. E. EY’S HOME AT “REDBANK.” NEAR MILLICENT.
The Dorset Horn is noted for its wonderfully early maturing
qualities. 1 his breed proved itself at the Abbatoirs before it was
noted in the show ring. Mr. Ey has won over 50 prizes at the
shows for fat lambs and pure bred Dorset Horn ewes and rams.
In South Australia, where the Dorset is most strongly entrenched
this breed has forced itself to the front by the consistent manner in
which the Dorset cross lambs have topped the market. The breed
is by no means perfect, but its capacity for growth combined with
prime quality has forced the Dorset into prominent public notice. The
lambs can be sold at any time from three to four months old, and
Mr. Ey has had lambs at 10 weeks old scale over 80 lb. live weight.
These lambs were from half-bred ewes by Dorset rams.
Mr. Ey points out that for the best results a good ewe is
essential. From cross bred ewes he always gets from 120 to 130
per cent, lambs, while from pure bred ewes the average is 200
per cent. The /ewes breed all the year round and twin lambs are
common. The wool runs from 40 to 50’s quality, and good
ewes cut from 8 to 9 lbs. of wool.

BEACHPORT, ROBE and KINGSTON
Beachport. Robe, and Kingston represent three of the principal
litoral towns in the South-East. Beachport is situated 365 miles
from Adelaide by rail, and about 246 by road, and forms portion
of the northern end of Rivoli Bay, which was declared a port early
in 1878. During the wool and barley seasons, the port is busy with
shipping activities, transporting the products of nearby farm and
grazing properties to the markets. Beachport has gained much
popularity by reason of its beautiful seascape and enjoyable climate.
Lake George and other 1 large sheets of water abound with wild fowl
of various kinds, and afford excellent sport for sportsmen, while
in the bay and along the rocky coast, cray and other fish abound.
A mile or so from the town there is a small salt lake which is said
to possess valuable curative properties, and many sufferers from
rheumatism and other similar maladies have found relief by bathing
in its saline waters.
For the use of tourists and visitors, the Bay View Hotel offers
first-class accommodation, and recent renovation and extensions
make it one of the best in-the South-East.
As a seaside resort, Robe may be termed “the gem of the South-
East.” It is situated about 213 miles south-east of Adelaide, and
is essentially a holiday town. It lies on the south side of Guichen
Bay, and is protected by a reef off Cape Lannes and Baudin’s Rocks.
Years ago, Robe was a fairly busy sea port, but nowadays, local
fishermen contribute the only shipping industry, although the bay
is ideally situated for harbor purposes. It is elliptical in shape, and
•closed, except to the west, where the entrances, respectively north
and south of Snewin Rock, give a clear passage way of 7,750 feet
and 8,500 feet, and an average depth of 10 fathoms. The bay inside
Fas a fairly uniform depth of 6 fathoms up to close proximity of
the shore, and affords secure anchorage to vessels of considerable
tonnage in all average weather. The shore directly fronting the
town has a series of small rocky points, caves, sandy coves, and
flat rocks exposed and covered according to tide. There arc also
two fine sandy beaches on either side of the rocky portions, where
sea bathing may be taken with safety. The reefs and the Baudin
rocks form ideal spots for those who care for fishing. Robe is
actually the coolest town in the State and, even on the hottest
summer day, there is a cool breeze coming from the ocean to keep
the temperature down. Close to the town are several lakes, and in
the open season some excellent shooting is obtainable. A very
energetic Progress Association has been responsible for much improve-
ment to the foreshore, and for making facilities for campers. The
arrival of Mr. J. H. Fax, a few years ago, to take over the Robe
Hotel, meant an important step forward in the advancement of
the town. The previously very ordinary hotel was remodelled and
increased in size, and it now is recognised as being one of the best
conducted hotels in the State, arid is a decided asset to Robe as an
inducement to visitors to stay.
“Karatta House,” a .summer residence of a former Governor of
South Australia, has been remodelled, and transformed into and
ideal guests’ home. It is situated in an admirable position, over-
looking the ocean on one side, and a minature lake on the other.
Close to the town is a stone beacon, an old mariners’ guide which
was used in the days when the port was busy. Robe first gained
notoriety in the early days of the colony, when it was made a convict
settlement. The convicts were sent to the Robe prison, ruins of
which are still standing.
As a district, Robe is chiefly pastoral, but farming is also
carried on to a certain extent. There is still a large area of unsettled
land in the vicinity, and this unoccupied condition is probably due
to the non-development of the harbor as a shipping port, and also
to the, ""as‘yet, imperfect drainage. However, in the course of time,
when the South-East, as a whole, is more fully developed, and maybe
a harbour of importance in constructed, then Robe must certainly
come into its pwn.. From a business point of view, the town is
small, the population being under 500, and the main turnover is
effected during the holidays at Christmas and Easter. The most up-
to-date stores are those of Messrs. E. & T. Michelmore, who,
although fairly recently established, are conducting their business
with a decided note of progress.
Kingston is situated at the head of Lacepede Bay, about 185
miles, by road, south of Adelaide. By rail, the distance is 292
miles. The two important industries of the district are wool and
wattle bark, but with further settlement, grain and general produce
will be added still further to the local output. Kingston is well
known as probably the finest cray fishing ground in the State, and
large quantities of crustaceans are exported to all parts of South
Australia and Victoria. Lacepede Bay, on which Kingston stands,
contains 67 nautical square miles of safe anchorage, and a screw pile
jetty 3,555 feet long, has a working head of 480 feet, and a depth
of water at the end of 1 0 ft. 6 ins. at low tide.
Kingston is situated at the end of the long Coorong road, and
and it is therefore used as a stopping place for travellers, much more
than as a tourist resort. Concannon’s Crown Hotel is the more
popular of the two residential public houses, and is maintained well
up to the standard of country hotels.

JOHN WHEELEY LEA,
A Grower of Pedigree Cattle, Pigs and Sheep
AN ATTRACTIVE VIEW OF “THE HERMITAGE " HOMESTEAD.
Mr. J. W. Lea is the squire of “The Hermitage,” a very desir-
able property situated about 5i miles south-east of Robe. His father,
the late Dr. Edward Lea, took it up in 1865. The area then was
about 200 acres, all virgin land. Clearing was not so heavy, as it
was fairly open country with portions of large ti-tree and shea-oak
and none of the present day scrub and mallee.
Dr. Edward Lea’s activities were mainly pastoral, starting with
about 500 head of good quality merinos. Mr. John W. Lea was
born at “The Hermitage” in July 1867 and two years later his
father was killed as the result of a fall from a horse. Mr. Lea’s
mother carried on the estate with the assistance of her brother-in-law,
Mr. Henry Lea. In January, 1888, Mr. J. W. Lea took over the
management in partnership with his mother. It was then in the
region of 700 acres.
Mr. Lea devoted a lot of attention to cattle as well as sheep,
and added a herd of pure-bred Ayrshires, some of which were
obtained from Mr. J. A. Riddoch, of “Katnook,” near Penola. A
bull and cow originally came from MacFarlane’s, the well known
breeders of Christchurch, New Zealand. The remainder of the
herd were secured from Mr. Robinson of Golden Grove, near Tea

The homestead is notable for wonderful old Furniture and Silver Plate

Tree Gully. Mr. Lea persevered with his Ayrshires for several
years, but after losing both the New Zealand bull and cow through
an outbreak of anthrax, he decided to give it up, and turned his
attention to shorthorns, mixing the breed with Herefords. Mr.
Lea also obtained a few merino rams from “Katnook,” but they did
not thrive owing to lack of suitable pasture.
After the death of his mother in February, 1916, Mr. Lea set
about improving the property and started a campaign of intense
cultivation and supering the native grasses. The benefit to the
land was most marked, some portions carrying an average of two
sheep to the acre throughout the year. The whole of the land
supported a sheep to the acre without the slightest risk of over-
stocking. He now has only about thirty sheep all of which are
good wool cutting merinos, but are not stud animals.
In 1915, Mr. Lea procured from Mr. M. B. Wilson of Tarlee,
a number of pedigreed Berkshire pigs, also a few locally. With
these, including 12 breeding sows, he established a fine collection of
bacon animals. In 1922, he added a couple of Mid-York sows
and a boar which were bred at the Kybybolite experimental farm.
A couple more pedigreed Mid-York sows were introduced in 1926,


SOME OF MR. J. W. LEA’S DAIRY CATTLE.
from Mr. W. H. Bruce’s stud. The parents of these animals were
champions at the Adelaide Royal Agricultural Show in 1925. Mr.
Lea still retains the sows. He also has a Tamworth sow and a
boar bred by Mr. W. IT Bruce, which possess good pedigrees and
were purchased three and a half years ago. His collection at present
comprises seven breeding pigs and ten young ones. Mr. Lea has
devoted a lot of attention to breeders and has realised good prices
for his stock.
Excellent quality characterises the herd at “The Hermitage.’’
There are 16 breeding cows, pedigreed milking shorthorns, two
“Wangaras’’ from Mr. R. T. Melrose’s estate at Rosebank, two
Illawarras from Mr. Arthur Snell at Bolivar, and a dozen from
Mr. H. H. Shillabeer’s East View stud. There are also about 20
head of young stock. The bull used is “Daphne’s Boy’’ (a
Shillabeer breed) which was purchased by Mr. Lea as a three-year-
old. in 1 925. The dairy product is turned into cream and butter
and sent to market.
Mr. Lea grows enough hay for general stock purposes, which
is worked by share farming on a plot of 180 acres. This land has
been heavily superred and is capable of a much higher average than
its present one of a ton to the acre. About 70 lbs. super to the acre
is used for dressing. It has been stated by authorities that sheep
suffer from weak joints on account of lack of superphosphates in
the ground, which is another strong argument in favour of regular
dressings of all sheep pasturage.
A GOOD TYPE BERKSHIRE SOW OWNED BY MR. J. W. LEA .


The property at Robe now consists of 1,242 acres in the
homestead section and 1,803 acres at “Clay Wells,” near Millicent.
The principal natural timbers on it are shea-oak and ti-tree most
of which is cleared, but young wattle are now overgrowing a large
area.
The native grasses are kangaroo grass, dandelion and a few
other varieties. Clover does not seem to do to well at “The
Hermitage,” but lucerne has proved prolific and Mr. Lea has actually
made from five to six cuttings a year off it. Water is supplied from
wells, by means of windmills. In 1895, springs were formed,
following upon a series of earthquakes, and a supply is also procured
from these.

The homestead at “The Hermitage” is situated on a rise and
is an attractive building, containing every convenience, such as Delco
light, telephone etc. It is surrounded by a pretty garden with trees
and shrubs.
The outbuildings comprise two large stables, a couple of garages,
three grain store rooms, chaff shed, coach house, engine room,
separator room, a dairy with five bails, two store rooms, a couple of
luggage rooms and three others used to store guns etc. There is
also accomodation for married men. In “The Hermitage”
homestead itself, there are fourteen rooms. From the verandah, an
excellent outlook is obtained over a wide stretch of beautiful country.


A GLOUCESTER SPOT BOAR OF EXCELLENT TYPE AT
"THE HERMITAGE.”
Mr. Lea’s great hobby is Pekingese dogs and Persian cats.
There is a stud of a dozen of the latter at “The Hermitage’’ all of
them pedigreed, one Persian tom winning a championship in
Adelaide. He is also keenly interested in Old English sheep dogs,
red retrievers, which were imported from England, also a Smithfield,
and fox terriers. The progeny of the latter are still on the property
and are from dogs imported from England. His three pure bred
Pekingese are the progeny of Commonwealth Grand Champions.
“Logie O’Buckan” was the winner of a Maiden Trials and
second in a Handicap Trials in 1924, and is a black and white
Border collie.
Poultry is another specialty with Mr. Lea, who has six different
breeds including Rhode Island Reds, black Orpingtons, white
Leghorns, Indian Game, Speckled Sussex, white Wyandottes,
Minorcas, and brown Leghorns. His ducks are the popular Ayles-
burys, with a few muscovies and brown and white runners. Bronze-
wing turkeys are also reared, the domestic bird catalogue being
rounded off with fantail pigeons that came from “Anlaby,” at
Kapunda, homing pigeons, and doves.
The homestead is approached by a charming drive of about
a mile and a half through heavy groves of trees which in parts
almost form an archway. Among the furniture is a striking dining

original paintings which came from Mr. Lea’s ancestral home in
Worcestershire, England. He also has some marvellous English
silver plate, presented to Mr. J. W. Lea’s grandfather in 1837,
when, as Lord Mayor of Worcestershire, he laid the foundation-stone
over the River Severn. A mosaic in the possession of Mr. Lea is
valued at £ 2,000.
A private lake on the property is somewhat unique, providing
excellent facilities for bathing. Mr Lea has a fine collection of
hacks, a prize winning carriage pair, a unicorn team and a tandem
team.


MARTIN DOMASCHENZ
THE HOMESTEAD AT “LAKE ELIZA."
Mr. Martin Domaschenz, who has extensive sheep interests
in the South-East, is satisfied the land there could accommodate half
a million more people if better transport and other facilities were
provided. He is a firm believer in the country, and is one of its
most enterprising settlers. His “Lake Eliza” holding is situated
about 1 1 miles east of Robe, and “Lake St. Clair” is three miles
further on. “Dt'ung Drung” is located at Horsham, in Victoria.
Mr. Domaschenz took up “Lake Eliza” in 1898, when the
property comprised about 1,000 acres. It was later joined to the
“St. Clair” estate, the acreage now touching 15,000. The country
is mostly flat, with sections of undulating land, and a few rangy
portions.
Much work had to be done to prepare it for sheep. For the
most part it was covered with undergrowth consisting of currant
bush, ti-tree, shea-oak, honeysuckle, mallee and blue bush. About
2,000 acres are now cleared and 1,000 acres of the plains land has
been cultivated. The estates are principally pastoral, with certain
portions that were broken up many years ago to improve for sheep,
suitable for agriculture.
The original homestead at “Lake St. Clair,” one of the oldest
relics of the early days, is stilL standing. The present headquarters
are at “Lake Eliza” which is more suitable for working the properties.
Although the south-east has always been regarded chiefly as
a grazing territory it has great agricultural possibilities. Mr.
Domaschenz has grown numerous crops of wheat, oats and barley,
and many cuts of two tons to the acre have been secured, some
going up to three tons in picked spots and standing 6 feet high.
White Tuscan and Red Tuscan wheat were used for hay, the
latter beinji stacked and sold for chaff in the dry years.


'■'Lake Eliza/' “Lake St. Clair" and “Drang Drang."
THIS PANORAMA GIVES A FINE IDEA OF THE SURROUNDING COUNTRY.
An experiment was tried with Federation wheat that is so
popular in the dry northern areas. Although the crop was stripped
it was not a success owing to the coldness of the climate and the
wetness of the soil. This trouble could be overcome by threshing.
Twenty bushels of wheat and thirty bushels of oats to the acre
have been taken off unfallowed land.
The land is not now used for grain production for two reasons.
In the first place the areas at present suitable are limited, and in the
second place, the distance from the nearest railway—23 miles—
makes it unprofitable to grow oats and barley except for home use.
Mr Domaschenz does not even grow his own hay, purchasing his
requirements from neighbouring farmers.
Efficient and cheap transport would make a wonderful
difference. As things stand to convey harvests to the railway and
meet the cost of haulage to Adelaide or Melbourne is very expensive.
If the transport facilities were up-to-date, grain and hay growing
would develop into a highly profitable industry. A
shipping port, superphosphates factory, and direct railway
would be the main assets. If these and other necessities were
provided, Mr. Domaschenz is convinced that the South-east could
maintain half a million people, assuring a sufficient livelihood for
all.
Another good effect of transport would be to increase the stock
carrying capacity of the country. As the result of his experiments,
Mr. Domaschenz has proved that it can be improved by 1,000 per
cent.
He cleared and fenced off 20 acres to demonstrate what the
land was capable of. Prior to the clearing, it supported one sheep

to every five acres for twelve months. After clearing and grubbing,
Mr. Domaschenz grew three crops of oats and rye on the 20 acres.
The land was heavily fertilised for each crop and afterwards the
pasturage was top dressed with super every three years. The
carrying capacity is now two sheep to the acre.
The process is expensive, however, and the cost of
clearing and fertilising retards progress; the latter princi-
pally due to high freights and cartage to destination.
These have been big factors in preventing the full develop-
ment of many fine properties. Mr. Domaschenz has sown
Wimmera rye grass and English rye grass for stock fodder. The
natural grasses which abound on the estate are hop clover, burr
clover, spear grass, certain root grasses, Californian trefoil, barley
grass, ribbed grass and a percentage of geranium.
The grown sheep flock on the three properties number 20,000.
half of which are merinos and the remainder Lincoln-Merino cross.
Of these 9,000 and 10,000 are breeding ewes, which lamb about 80
per cent., the lambing usually being about 7,500. Of these ewes,
about 6,000 are brought over from “Drung Drung,” 170 miles
away, and are returned before lambing takes place.
Mr. Domaschenz also leases an extensive area in the South-east
for sheep grazing which was taken up on account of the poor seasons
in the northern districts of Victoria during 1927-8. On the leased
land large numbers of “Drung Drung’’ sheep are grazed. As a rule he
takes a number of sheep from “Drung Drung’’ to “Lake Eliza’’ each
year, but this season and last, a larger number than usual have been
brought across the border. The lambing takes place at “Drung
Drung’’ and 80 per cent, of them are sold in the Victorian markets
as fats.


MR. DOMASCHENZ POINTS OUT THE LAKE ON THE LEFT.
“Drung Drung” was virgin country which Mr. Domaschenz
improved from fof a sheep to 2\ sheep to the acre. The situations
of the holdings enable him to work them together successfully,
particularly in dry years. The average wool clip is 8f lb. per sheep,
including crossbreds and merinos.
Fat lambs being the principal industry, the wool is of a more
or less secondary consideration. Mr. Domaschenz is forming a
stud of English Leicesters at Horsham and is using the lambs with
cross-bred ewes to produce an improved class of fat lambs. The
English Leicesters were selected for this purpose after a lot of
experimenting with Border Leicesters, Lincolns and Southdowns.
The nucleus of the English Leicester stud was secured from Mr.
J. G. Abel, of “Viladale,” Yulecart, Victoria.
The country around “Lake Eliza’’ is particularly suited for
merino wethers and Mr. Domaschenz keeps a large number of them
there. To improve the health of the sheep, he uses a lick made up
by himself consisting of 10 ingredients including salt and potassium
iodide. This lick has been in use for a couple of years, and the
results have been highly satisfactory in small areas where all the
sheep have been able to obtain it. The indications are that they
will show an all round improvement as the result of this treatment.
There is no “fluke” on the sheep in this country.
The rainfall is 25 inches annually, water being supplied from
springs. Troughs are provided for sheep watering, and water can
be had almost anywhere by digging from two to six feet.
Mr. Domaschenz is also interested in wattle bark and cuts an

average of 80 tons a year. d his is only one of many subsidiary
industries that can be carried on in the South-East. With more
capital and better transport facilities, Mr. Domaschenz is certain
that the country has a magnificent future. One of the reasons why
he took up property in Victoria, was the lack of transport on the
South Australian side of the border. When conditions are better
he intends to carry out further extensive improvements to the land,
and eventually to offer it for sale.


EDWARD GOODE
"Barooka" and "Snuggery”
Mr. Edward Goode is a strong champion of the south-east, and
has always been prepared to increase his interests there. He took up
Barooka, comprising about 8,000 acres near Kingston, in 1886.
It is now about 6,500 acres, but included in his holdings is “The
Snuggery,” of 44,000 acres, and about 106 square miles of scrub
country near 1 intinara- where the sheep are transferred when the
country around Kingston is too wet. Mr. Good maintains 6,000
sheep, 100 head of cattle and 100 horses. The cattle are beef
descriptions, while the horses are mostly hacks and draughts. The
cattle are usually sold locally as fats, and for topping up for the
market.
The country was in its natural state without even a boundary
fence when Mr. Goode took it up. He commenced operations in an
iron house, and by great industry he gradually got together a fine
flock of sheep. The top price of one of his best clips, that of
1923-24, realised 36d. per lb. for pure merino wool of 64’s quality.
It carried large proportions of grease, which is an excellent recom-
mendation for scrub country. The wool is remarkably clean and
averages 10 to 11 lb. per fleece. The general policy lately has
been to buy from northern stations and run them on the local
pastures.
Through experiments with top dressing up to 1 cwt. to the
acre, Mr. Goode has indicated that the country is doubling its
capacity. The top dressing has brought forward many new or
backward grasses. King’s Island melilotus, or south-eastern clover,
has been responding very well to the treatment, and on the gravelly
ridges where gum grows subterranean clover thrives. Wattle,
stringybark, shea-oak, and ti-tree are the chief timber, and pines
thrive when planted in the sandy soil. Evening primrose (a fine
stock fodder) grows excellently on the sandy land.
The soil in the three holdings of Mr. Goode is varied, including
a lot of friable-loam. The Tintinara land carries scrub and mallee.
The Kingston area is suitable for sheep and cattle, and will
be greatly improved by draining. With drainage and top dressing
there is a big future for the south-east as a stock fattening proposition.
Water for the stock is provided in all the paddocks by means of
windmills and troughs. The station is cut up so as to facilitate
the movement of stock, the paddocks varying in size from 300
acres up, except for smaller subdivisions in the home areas.
The sandy country grows first class fruit, and Mr. Goode
is convinced that if men were put on the land for fruit-growing
purposes they would do well. All orchard varieties thrive, the
average annual rainfall being 25 to 30 inches.
The fencing of the station if chiefly wood and iron posts
carrying five wires and a barb. The homestead is situated in

Kingston. It is a substantial villa type with all conveniences and a
well laid out garden.
Mr. Goode thinks that what is wanted in the south-east is
first of all, development of the land to its full carrying capacity, then
the establishment of a deepsea port. An excellent harbour is possible,
as there is no ocean swell. The naval authorities have surveyed
the coast, and it is considered that King’s Camp, about 16 miles
south of Kingston, offers all the advantages of a natural port.
Mr. Goode was Chairman of the Kingston Drainage League
for 1 5 years and has shown great great interest in all district affairs.
He has been an untiring worker in the Kingston District Council,
with which he has been connected over a period of 40 years.


JOHN FRANCIS RYDER
"Ashmore," Reedy Creek
A VIEW SHOWING THE EXTENSIVE PLAINS LAND AT “ASHMORE.”
A first class pastoral and agricultural holding, the owner oi
which is popular throughout the south-east, is that of “Ashmore,”
miles from Reedy Creek, and 1 1 miles east-south-east of Kingston.
Its area is 14,200 acres, of which about 12,000 acres is plain lands
and the remainder low ranges. The soil is heavy black and grey,
much of it being suitable for agriculture. Mr. J. F. Ryder, the
proprietor of “Ashmore” grows Algerian oats for hay purposes,
cutting about two tons to the acre. He grew barley for a time, for
the cultivation of which the land seemed to be particularly suited.
The chief industry of “Ashmore” is sheep raising. About
10,000 go through Mr. Ryder’s shearing sheds each season. All are
pure merinos of true Murray blood, carrying an extra good fleece,
the prices realised being generally up to the top recorded for south-
eastern clips. Including lambs, the average cut per sheep is 9 lbs.
In its natural state, the country will carry about 8,000 sheep,
and Mr. Ryder has about 2,000 additional sheep running on a
couple of thousand of acres of leased land adjoining his property.
The natural grasses at “Ashmore” are barley grass, brumby grass.
Mt. Schanck clover, Mother Dutton, native grasses, English
dandelion and tussock grass. Supering has been carried out on some
of the paddocks which will maintain two sheep to the acre as well
as a number of cattle and horses. Most of the surplus sheep at
“Ashmore” are sold as fats.
The top-dressed country is specially suitable for fattening
cattle and for raising good legged horses. Fat sheep have been

exhibited by Mr. Ryder at the local and Mount Barker Shows, a
number of prize§ having been won by them.
A herd of 120 cattle, mostly red polls and half-bred polls,
are maintained with some shorthorns and Herefords. The horses
comprise about 150 head, mostly Clydesdales and Indian remounts,
containing a percentage of thoroughbreds which Mr. Ryder raises
himself. A draft from the stock of Clydesdales is sent to Adelaide
each year where top prices are generally secured for them.
The improvements on the property are numerous. There is
53 miles of fencing most of which carries five plain wires. The
natural timber on “Ashmore” is mountain and ti-tree, the former
providing most of the posts for fencing. The property is fairly
cleared of unnecessary timber, and the rainfall average is 26 to 27
inches. There are 14 miles of drainage throughout the property.
“Ashmore’’ is divided into 23 paddocks, water being pumped
to all of them by means of windmills. The water is secured about
6 feet below the surface.
Mr. J. F. Ryder was born at Kanmantoo, and was educated
at Nairne and Christian Brothers College. He was really reared in
the Mount Barker district, where he still retains some interests. Mr.
Ryder took up “Ashmore” in 1907, purchasing it in conjunction
with his brother, Mr. T. S. Ryder, from Messrs. Hutchinson
Brothers. Their first home in the South East was “Wangalena''
Station, about 10 miles south of Kingston. “Wangalena” and

"Ashmore” were worked as one proposition for about four years,
after which Mr. J. F. Ryder took "Ashmore” and Mr. T. S. Ryder
retained "Wangalena.”
The homestead at "Ashmore” was completely remodelled
when Mr. Ryder came into posession. A modern wool shed and
yard were built in 1912, and a number of substantial outbuildings
added. The homestead is surrounded by pines, gums and other
trees, and is set off by attractive flower beds and lawns.
Mr. J. F. Ryder has always been keenly interested in racing,
giving it practical support as an owner. He has bred and raced
many prominent gallopers. Probably the best he ever owned was
New Warrier, a great hurdler, who won many important races in
Adelaide. Ranking next in importance came Doiran, one of
the most popular fencers ever seen in South Australia. Doiran
was by that great stayer Sojourner from Hibernia. Doiran

including the Melbourne Cup Steeple, and Warrnambool Grand
Annual Steeple. Doiran jumped miles of fences at Oakbank,
Morphettville, Flemington, Port Adelaide, Warrnambool, Randwick
and Williamstown. Only once did he sustain a natural fall. Twice
he came down owing to other horses stumbling in front of him.
This performance is probably a record for Australia.

In conjunction with Mr. Mullins of Native Valley, Mr. Ryder
raced Rumford, All’s Well and Anton Prince. Rumford, who
is by Trafalgar out of Ingleria, won an important handicap at
Cheltenham, many hurdle races in the South-East and Adelaide,
and was second in the Caulfield Grand National of 1928. Alls
Well was a noted winner over the jumps, and Anton Prince credited
the partnership with some important wins in sprint events. Mr.
Ryder also bred and raced Our Saint, a good performer by Saint
Spasa from Antillean. The racing of Our Saint was in association
with Mr. R. Myles of "Burnside,’ near Naracoorte. Our Saint won
several Welter Handicaps, came second in the Port Adelaide Cup
one year and third in the same race the year following. The mare
won Tattersall’s Cup. She is now Mr. Ryder’s own property, and
has a colt foal by Stand By. Mr. Ryder also has the well bred
gelding Sceutum by Poitrel, a Melbourne Cup winner.


GEORGE BURCHER BARNETT
"Nettlina"
THE HOMESTEAD, “NETTLINA.”
In “Nettlina,” 14 miles east of Kingston, Mr. George Burcher
Barnett has a substantial holding of 7,000 acres of agricultural and
pastoral country. It was purchased by his father, the late Mr.
Frederick W. Barnett in 1888, the area then being only 1,000
acres.
The property is used principally for grazing, Mr. Barnett
stocking a little over 2,000 pure merinos, the clip from which goes
9 lb. to a sheep, with an average of 60-64’s quality fleece. In
normal seasons, Mr. Barnett secures 81 per cent, lambs. He also
fattens wethers and markets 300 round about May of each year, or
as late as possible before the wet weather sets in.
“Nettlina” is chiefly plains land, 2,000 to 3,000 acres of
which is cleared. To increase the grazing capacity, 50 tons of
super is applied every year. At present on the original 1,000 acres
a sheep to the acre is being carried.
The chief grasses are native barley grass, rye grass, and native
clovers. Summer feed is provided by Mother Dutton and English
dandelion. The timber is mostly blue and redgums. Years ago
there was a heavy growth of honeysuckle on “Nettlina,” but it
has gradually died out.
Wate? can be struck on the property at a depth of 23 feet and
windmills are used to reticulate it to the paddocks, of which there
are 10 all fenced with five plain wires, and a top barb on redgum
posts.
Mr. Barnett runs a fine little herd of 20 milking shorthorns
and a few Jerseys. There are also 40 horses on the estate, mostly
Clydesdales and lights, with a few hacks.
Only 50 or 60 tons of hay is grown each year for feeding
purposes. Algerian has been selected for this purpose, the cut
averaging 1 3 tons to the acre. In some years, Mr. Barnett has
obtained over two tons to the acre, another proof of the capacity
of the South-East as a grain and fodder producer.
There are a couple of first class Tam worth breeding sows at
“Nettlina,” and one excellent Mid-York sow. A few other pigs are
kept for general farm purposes, while black Orpingtons, a few geese
and turkeys are reared successfully.
The homestead was built by Mr. Barnett’s father in 1890.
The woolshed and stables were added in 1922. They are of ample
size and up-to-date design. The usual implement sheds, dairy, etc.
round off the improvements on this excellent grazing and farming
proposition.

THOMAS STEPHEN RYDEM
"Conmurra"
“Conmurra” is typical of the valuable station properties in the
South-east. It lies 18 miles south-east of Kingston and about 10
miles from the Reedy Creek railway station. The area is 9 miles
by 3 miles, covering about 14,000 acres of flat farming and
grazing land.
The soil is principally heavy black to grey, with a good subsoil.
Most of it is naturally cleared, but there are a few shea-oaks, dryland
ti-tree, honeysuckle, blue gum and red gum. The chief natural
grasses are barley grass, native root grasses, dandelions, tussocks and
six varieties of clover. There is, therefore, an abundance of natural
fodder, and a sheep to the acre is carried all the year round.
i
With a rainfall of 26 inches, no trouble is caused by lack of
moisture. On the contrary, disposal of surplus water in the wet
months is a problem, and there are no less than 33 miles' of drains
on “Conmurra” for this purpose.
THE SHEEP YARDS AT “CONMURRA.”
MERINO WEANERS AT “CONMURRA."
Water is to be found at an average depth of 4 feet. Windmills
are used to pump water into the troughs for the sheep and supplies
are reticulated to all the paddocks, which number 34.
There are 65 miles of fencing on the property, carrying five
plain wires and a top barb. About six miles is netted. The
fencing is among the best to be seen in the South-east and the
perseverance of Mr. Ryder in combatting rabbits has practically freed
the station of this pest.
By a careful system of pasture dressing with super Mr. Ryder
has got “Conmurra” in great heart and it is a wonderful producer.
The wool cut generally goes 10 to 11 lbs. each, from about 8,000
sheep, all pure merinos. The fleece averages a 64's quality. Mr.
Ryder aims at good quality and character, and his wools are among
the best grown in the South-east.


“Conmurra” is now a wide expanse of plain that comprised
both “Conmurra” and “Woolmit.” “Woolmit” was formerly
owned by the late Mr. Andrew Dunn.
Although Mr. Ryder is one of its leading pastoralists, he was
not born in the South-east. His home town is really Mt. Barker,
where he received his early education, finishing off at Christian Bros.
College, Adelaide. In his younger days Mr. Ryder was associated
with his brother John in "Wangolina station, 10 miles south of
Kingston. Mr. John F. Ryder worked the station for seven years,
and Mr. T. S. Ryder had control for about 20 years. During
that period he erected 26 miles of netting, did much fencing and
clearing and enjoyed great prosperity before retiring to "Conmurra”
in 1923. "Wangolina” station was sold to Mr. T. J. Goode.
Since he has had control of "Conmurra,” Mr. Ryder has made
big improvements. The homestead is an unusually comfortable
dwelling, set in attractive surroundings amid a grove of pines, oaks,

and other ornamental and shade trees. I he sheep yards erected
under wide-branching oaks and other trees, are convenient to head-
quarters, the shade being greatly appreciated by station hands when
drafting and dipping have to be done in warm weather.
The outbuildings are substantially constructed of stone and
iron. All are of modern design, with every facility for housing
the plant and implements. There is a large grain store, chaff
cutting house and numerous stables with loose boxes.
In addition to sheep, Mr. Ryder is a great lover of horses and
for a number of years he has been a strong supporter of the turf.
Thoroughbreds are one of his hobbies. Among others he bred Joy
Ship which won the Grand National in India and seven other
important races in that country. Good Company which won the


Dequetteville Stakes in Adelaide in 1925 and Amant, another good
South Australian performer, came from his stud. Probably the
best he has owned is Stand By, which won the Port Adelaide Cup
in 1923 at three years old, the Adelaide St. Leger and Birthday Cup
in 1 924, the Moonee Valley Gold Cup in 1924 and was second in the
Melbourne Cup of 1924. Stand By after his wonderful racing
career, is now doing stud duty at “Conmurra.” A yearling colt
by Stand By from Brevadale (dam of Maid of the Mist) and a
yearling filly by the same sire from Lady Peggy are an exceedingly
promising pair. Several foals running in the paddocks also show
promise, particularly a filly from Good Company.
Mr. Ryder has hosts of friends in the city, as well as in the
South-east, where his up-to-date methods and progressive enterprise
have done much to prove the worth and potentialities of that part
of the State. In addition to his activities with sheep and thorough-
breds, Mr. Ryder runs 50 head of beef Shorthorns and his mob of
30 draught horses rival anything to be seen in their class in the
State.

FREDERICK HAYES
"Bagdad"
A PICTURE OF THE BROAD ACRES AT “BAGDAD.”
Bagdad is an old name, specially famous in the Tales of the
Arabian Nights. In the south-east there is another “Bagdad.” the
property of Frederick Hayes. It goes back to the earliest years
of the State, and is one of the few stations that have remained
in the same family since it was originally taken up. The sons of
Mr. Hayes, Messrs. Noel Frederick Hayes and Stevenson Hayes
represent the third generation. The late Mr. John Hayes, the
grandfather of Mr. Frederick Hayes, was the first European to be
born in Tasmania. In every sense of the word, therefore, the Hayes
family were pioneers.
The founder of the station was Mr. George William Hayes,
who arrived with his wife from Scotland in 1839. Mr. G. W.
Hayes was the first owner of “Bagdad,” under an old freehold lease,
under which the government has no access to any new minerals,
oil, etc. that might be discovered there.
The holding originally extended over many square miles of
mostly level land comprising light sandy soils, with black soil on the
flats. The area is now between 9-000 and 10,000 acres. About
1,500 acres of it is heavily timbered, mostly with wattles. There
is also honeysuckle and stringybark.
Mr. Frederick Hayes was born on Bagdad in 1864.
He took it over on his own account in 1904. Except
for 500 or 600 acres of adjoining lands that were purchased in 1890,


FREDERICK HAYES

THE HOMESTEAD IS SHOWN ON THE LEFT.
the station remains the same. In 1851, when the Ballarat gold
diggings were opened, parties of overlanders, especially Chinese,
camped on Mr. Hayes’ property on their way to Victoria.
“Bagdad” was originally used to breed blood horses. The
possibilities of sheep were soon realised, and to-day a flock
of fine comeback type are run. The country is regarded
as among the best for the production of fine wool which realises
excellent prices at the sales. The cut is about 9 lb. per sheep,
including lambs. The fineness of the wool naturally varies with the
sheep.
Most of the diseases that affected south-eastern sheep in the early
days are disappearing. The sheep at “Bagdad,” for instance, are a
clean healthy lot, almost free from affection of any kind. When
more netting is put on the boundary fences in the south-east, and
the rabbits thus kept down, the land generally will become still
more profitable for grazing. The more it is broken up and settled,
the better it becomes as a grazing proposition.
Mr. Hayes has over nine miles of rabbit-proof netting around
“Bagdad,” and before long he will have the whole station wired in.
The fencing is five plain wires, with a top barb in some places. In
other portions, six plain wires are used.
The rainfall at “Bagdad” averages 26 inches. A well 20
feet deep supplies the homestead portion with water, partly by means


of a windmill and pumping engine. Waterholes fed by permanent
springs take care of the water for the stock. The climate is naturally
cool, and the temperature rarely exceeds the century.
The chief natural grasses on "Bagdad,” are native clovers,
kangaroo grass, root grasses, speargrass, wild oats, barley grass,
Mother Dutton and dandelion, all of which provide first class feed
for stock. Mr. Hayes does not use super on the pastures, but he
applies it to the agricultural land that is used for growing Algerian
oats for fodder. About a ton to the acre is the return.
With so much wattle on the place, Mr. Hayes has found the
bark a profitable sideline, and at different times he has stripped
130 tons of bark, all of which is sent to the tanneries.
The cattle herd comprises 15 milking cows, mostly Jerseys,
which are maintained for home supplies.
The homestead is situated among a grove of pinus insignis,
and overlooks an excellent stretch of country.

In the old days, kangaroos caused a lot of trouble on account
of eating off the grass. Wallabies were also numerous. Wild turkeys;
were a feature of the place once, but the foxes have gradually wiped
them out. While kangaroos and wallabies have almost disappeared,
hov/evir, wombats appear to be immune against the depredations of
the fox, and have bred so rapidly during the past few years that
they have developed into a pest.


ANDREW ROBSON "Comung" and "Lakeside," Robe
A GLIMPSE OF MR. ANDREW ROBSON’S HOME, “LAKESIDE.”
“Comung,” situated 23 miles east of Robe, is one of the oldest
properties in the South-East. It was purchased from Mr. Donald
McDonald by Mr. Robson in 1905, the area being 12,000 acres,
all of which Mr. Robson still retains. He is also the owner of
Mt. Lookout, half-way between Robe and Beachport.
“Comung” is wholly pastoral, Mr. Robson’s residential pro-
perty being “Lakeside” in Robe. When a more efficient system of
drainage is carried out the property will prove suitable for intensive
agriculture. The Government scheme of drainage from Robe to
Lucindale passes through about four miles from the northern portion
of “Comung,” while on the southern side there is a mile of drainage.
The rainfall average at “Comung” is 28 inches.
Much of what is now regarded as waste land would grow
excellent fruit. At present, however, the market does not warrant
embarking on this enterprise, and the distance from the city is also
a drawback. When the difficulties are overcome, pears, figs, peaches,
and apples should prove most profitable. The South-Eastern
orchards do not require anything approaching the attention that is
necessary in orchards in the Lower North and Mount Lofty Ranges.
“Comung,” like so many of the South-Eastern holdings, is
plain lands with a little gum, honeysuckle, shea-oak, and ti-tree.
Most of it has been cleared. The chief natural fodder is barley
grass, and there are many other natural herbages.
Mr. Robson runs about 5,000 sheep, principally Merinos, but
he is an extensive buyer, so type and breed change somewhat. He
is a great lover of native fauna, and has done everything possible to
protect kangaroos and emus, which are gradually disappearing from
the South-East. He has seen as many as 80 emus in one flock
on a property. The fox is a particularly harmful pest and has been
responsible for wiping out a lot of the smaller native game. Eagles
were at one time very destructive of the lambs, and in his first years
there Mr. Robson shot 150 of these birds on his property. A
nieghbour brought down 80. They have now been practically
cleared out.
“Comung” is well fenced with posts from timber growing on
the property. A few cattle are run for domestic purposes, and
several hacks are maintained.
“Lakeside,” the homestead, is a fine residence situated by the
side of a miniature lake a mile from the town of Robe. It is
sheltered by Norfolk Island and other pines, ti-tree, shea-oak, and
gums, and a very pretty garden surrounds the house.


"KONETTA"
(John Watson, Manager)
THE “KONETTA” HOMESTEAD IS IN A PLEASANT SETTING.
“Konetta,” a leading station property between Robe and
Naracoorte, was originally portion of the old “Gillap” Station.
The first holders of “Gillap" were Messrs. Palmer, Murphy
and Henty. Mr. J. Todd purchased a large portion of it from
them and named it “Konetta,” and in 1871 Mr. Todd sold out to
the father of the presents owner.
L
The property originally covered 52 square miles, and is now
about 26,000 acres. The estate is in the hands of the Watson
family, with Mr. J. Watson as manager. It is mostly flat land
with portions of low ranges. Nearly all of it is naturally cleared,
but patches remain of shea-oak and honeysuckle. In the rangey
part there is mountain gum and stringy bark, which provide excel-
lent material for fencing and building purposes. There is also
some saltwater ti-tree.
Feed is abundant, with plenty of kangaroo grass which, how-
ever, is not well liked by stock. Other herbage such as Mount
Shanck clover, clover burr, birdseye clover, and rye grass is plentiful,
providing good grazing all the year round. Since the pastures
have been dressed with super, subterranean clover has been sown
and has done remarkably well.


"KONETTA"
(John Watson, Manager)
IT IS APPROACHED THROUGH A GROVE OF PINES.
The sheep at “Konetta” average about 6,000, all being shorn.
No ewes are kept, the manager relying on wethers for mutton and
wool production. They are pure Merinos, practically all northern
bred, large numbers coming from Princess Royal station.
The clip at “Konetta” averages from 9 to 10 pounds per
sheep. The wool is somewhat mixed, about 60 to 64’s quality,
medium-strong fibred. By stocking a reasonable number of sheep,
not too many for the carrying capacity of the land, the best type is
consistently produced.
In this section of the South-East the pastoralists find it neces-
sary to burn off the land very frequently. As a result a lot of
vermin is eliminated. Contrary to expectations, the wool is not
impaired by the burning of the undergrowth as sometimes only the
outer surface is blackened.
All the “Konetta” sheep have a good percentage of white yoke
in the wool which makes for quality and good prices. The sheep
are dipped to prevent fly and other vermin causing trouble. On
account of the cool climate in the South-East the fly does not give
much bother, but even so ,the ewes on some of the properties are
sometimes affected.


A VIEW OF THE SHEEP YARDS.
The rainfall in the “Konetta” area averages 25 inches. Water
supplies are secured from wells and bores, and water is laid on to
all the paddocks, windmills being set up for pumping purposes.
The land is drained a little by the Government system, but there
is need for further drainage. The surplus water considerably
reduces the stock-carrying capacity in winter. If more sheep were
put on an insufficient area would be left to maintain them in the
wet seasons.
There is a peculiar formation of limestone at “Konetta” on
an area called Biscuit Flat, which derives its name from numerous
round flat stone more or less of biscuit shape which actually grow
lying upon the ground. It is said that these stones, which vary
from a half to fifteen inches in diameter, are formed by lime deposits
around small portions of spongey material. This occurs each win-
ter as the rains come and dissolve the salts from the ground. The
crop of “biscuits” grows each year, and they are utilised for the
production of lime, proving quite useful in this respect.
A large sale of sheep was held at “Konetta” during February
of 1929. It was the first held at the station, and the catalogue
comprised 6,500 Merino wethers. Buyers came from all parts
of Australia, and many local pastoralists attended in the hope of
securing some of the highly prized Konetta sheep.
Mr. Watson stocks about 30 head of shorthorn type cattle,

which are utilised for dairy purposes and beef production. The
horse stock is used for station purposes only. A small paddock is
put under crop for stock fodder, the yield from which has touched
three tons of hay to the acre, but as a rule the average is a little
over two tons.
The "Konetta” homestead has been built for a number of
years and is of an attractive substantial type, surrounded by various
kinds of pines, sugar gums, and wattles with a well-kept garden and
shrubs and lawns.


BERTRAM FIANDER CLARKE,
"Horseshoe"
The “Horseshoe” Estate, which is part of the well-known
“Moorhouse” estate, lies 15 miles to the south-west of Kingston,
and was taken up by the late Mr. David Henry Clarke, father
of Mr. B. F. Clarke, about half a century ago. The original hold-
ing was a modest one of 1,000 acres. The area has been increased
until to-day it touches about 4,000 acres, of which Mr. B. F. Clarke
owns 2,050.
“Horseshoe” is all plains land, about half of which is cleared.
An area of a thousand acres is still thickly timbered with saltwater
ti-tree, and carrying a lot of barley grass, native rye grass, and kan-
garoo grass, all of which provide excellent grazing.
The rainfall averages 26 inches, and water supplies are reticu-
lated to all the paddocks by windmills, which keep the numerous
troughs always filled. The fencing on the estate is solid, the posts
carrying six wires, the top one being barbed.
Mr. Clarke stocks about 800 pure-bred merinos which are run
entirely for their wool. The product is about a 60-64’s quality of
medium staple, and the average clip reaches 9 lb. per fleece. To

improve the pasturage Mr. Clarke top dresses with Top brand super
at the rate of 80 lbs. to the acre. The land carries about a sheep
to every 2\ acres. Mr. Clarke is not a believer in overstocking,
and as the result of his methods he has built up a flock of excellent
wool cutters that are unusually healthy and remarkably free from
pests.
The homestead at “Horseshoe” is pleasantly situated on a ridge
in a grove of yate trees (a species of gum) , Canary Island pines, and
other foliage trees. A flower garden nicely terraced with rockeries
adds to the attractiveness of the homestead.
The outbuildings include substantial chaff and implement
houses, garage, etc. The old “Woolmit ’ homestead, a well-known
station in the early days, belongs to Mr. Clarke’s brother.
Mr. B. F. Clarke is a firm advocate of more drainage in the
South-East. If a big scheme were carried out it would bring about
a tremendous increase in the agricultural and pastoral output and
provide a good living for thousands more families. When Mr.
Clarke’s father first settled near Kingston there was no drainage
whatever, and what has been done only serves to show the possi-
bilities if the surplus moisture in the wet seasons can be carried away.

THE SOUTHERN DISTRICTS
A VIEW OF VICTOR HARBOUR.
The Southern Districts of South Australia, in a pastoral
sense, are confined for the most part to small stud properties on
which are bred various types of animals suitable for inter- and
cross-breeding purposes and to form new blood for other studs.
The sheep are principally of English types, such as Suffolks, South
Downs, Border Leicesters, Corriedales, Shropshires, etc., and
animals from southern studs have found their way to all parts of
Australia, and have proved themselves to be eminently suited to
crossing with merinos to produce fat lambs.
The studs represented in the following pages should provide
useful information to South-Eastern flockmasters and those in other
parts of the State.
Pigs are also bred in the southern districts, and a few excellent
studs of Berkshires, Tam worths, and Middle Yorkshires have
provided the nuclei of many other studs in different parts of South
Australia.
These districts are well catered for by a main arterial roadway
which runs from Adelaide via O’Halloran Hill (about 11 miles),
Reynella, Noarlunga, McLaren Vale, Willunga, Mount Compass,
to Victor Harbour (about 57 miles), and the whole length has
been bitumenised. Transport is therefore greatly facilitated, and
from a point of view of tourists, the seaside resorts have been made
easily accessible.
The rainfall throughout these districts is generally steady, and
averages about 25 inches or more per annum. Grasses are abundant
and stock are afforded an abundance of fodder throughout the year.
In certain parts experiments have been made with subterranean
clover and other grasses, and although they have not been definitely
established indications are that clover will, under suitable con-
ditions, grow in sufficient abundance to provide good feed.
Victor Harbour is one of the most popular watering places
and tourist resorts in the State. Lying right on the Southern
Ocean front, and with facilities to bathers and fishermen, it is a
veritable Mecca during the summer months. The town proper
is well laid out, and modern to the last degree, providing every
facility in the way of hotel and boarding house accommodation, and
facilities for boating, tennis, and golf enthusiasts. The Arcadia
Studio is probably one of the best equipped outside the metro-
politan areas, and apart from studio work, every type of souvenir
of Victor Harbour, from elaborate books of photographs, to small
folders, and chinaware, is procurable there.
For the health of the residents and visitors, Larkin’s Pharmacy
offers every opportunity to procure prescriptions, homeopathic
medicines, and other chemists’ supplies, prepared in professional
manner.
A few miles from Victor Harbour are the beautiful Hindmarsh
and Inman Valleys, which are admirably suitable for the growing
of excellent oranges. “The Orange Grove,’’ owned by Mr. H.
Martin, of Inman Valley, produces large quantities of oranges every
season, available for private purchase, wholesale, and retail, and for
export. There is also a kiosk for afternoon teas and private
dances.
About 20 miles from the Harbour is Normanville, on the
lower end of the Gulf of St. Vincent, at which may be viewed
some of the finest coastal scenery in the State.

DAVID HENRY GRIFFIN.
Mr. David Henry Griffin, who has now retired from active
business and devotes most of his spare time to the interests of the
town and district of Victor Harbour, has a wide knowledge of the
commercial life of South Australia.
He was born at Nairne in 1863 and received his education
at the State schools in Strathalbyn and Milang. His first experi-
ence of commerce was in the merchant stores of A. H. Landseer, Ltd.
at Milang, and later he started on his own account in a bakery
business. When tales came through in 1886 of rich gold finds at
Teetulpa Mr. Griffin decided to try his luck there. He was among
the first to take up a claim, but the venture was not successful;
as a matter of fact, Mr. Griffin lost practically all he had, and was
compelled to start over again. He chose Murray Bridge, and for
a couple of years there was engaged in the bakery trade. The
“Bridge" was a leading railway centre and securing an appointment
in the traffic department at Terowie, Mr. Griffin relinquished the
bakery. Lor 14 years he remained with the railways, then embarked
in the bakery business again. This was at Croydon, where he
remained for a, couple of years.
The larger scope offered by the Equitable Life Insurance Com-
pany of New York induced Mr. Griffin to take up a position with
that company in Adelaide, and later on he became Adelaide manager
of a Canadian Life Insurance Company. During his connection with
the later there was a demand for a complete classification of the
whole of the public service and the Holder Government appointed
a board for the purpose, including Mr. John Gardner (chairman)
and Mr. Peter Whitington (Commissioner of Audit). The wide
commercial experience of Mr. Griffin, and his knowledge of the
railways service, commended itself to the Government, and he
was also appointed a member. During the first 12 months of
the existence of this board the members covered 7,000 miles in
the railways to all parts of the State and personally examined the
work done in the various departments. The whole service com-
prising about 12,000 employees was classified. The work occupied
18 months, at the conclusion of which Mr. Griffin resumed his
association with the Canadian Life Insurance Company.
A year or so after the completion of the classification Mr.
Griffin’s health failed and his medical advisers recommended a change
to country life. Acting on this, Mr. Griffin took up land in
Milang, a district which he knew well, and started dairying and
mixed farming. He eventually disposed of these interests and
took up baking and butchering. It was not long before these also
were sold and Mr. Griffin purchased the Milang butter factory.
This was successfully handled by him and a bacon factory was
added to it. Within 1 2 months his products l were on exhibition
in the Adelaide Royal Show and in seven classes he took six firsts,
one second, and a champion for the best half-ton of export bacon.
The butter and bacon factories were then floated into a company,
together with a city interest, and in the following year the products
MR. D. H. GRIFFIN
(Mayor of Victor Harbour)
were again exhibited in Adelaide with the same gratifying measure
of success.
The business flourished, and Mr. Griffin eventually retired, but
he found he could not remain idle. He saw there were possibilities
in Victor Harbour, and with his two sons he established a motor
garage there. As a sideline he ran a picture show in the Institute
for a few years. Eventually he built the Victor Picture Palace
which he conducted in association with his youngest son. The
eldest son took over the garage which is still controlled by him.
Mr. Griffin’s interests in the picture theatre were acquired by the
National Picture Co. of Adelaide. Since then he has practically
retired from business and has expended his energies on matters
affecting the welfare of the town and district.
Mr. Griffin identified himself prominently with council affairs,
serving for two years as councillor. His administrative abilities
were quickly recognised, and during his 12 years’ residence at Victor
Harbour he has served for three years as Mayor. Mr. Griffin is
Chairman of the Hospital Building Committee and President of the
Victor Harbour Rifle Club. He is also Chairman of Directors of
The Arcadia Brick Coy. Ltd., Port Elliot. Mr. Griffin has always
taken a keen interest in sport, and is associated with a number of
sporting bodies. He is a P.D.H.C. Ruler of the 1.0. Rechabites,
also Past Master 1.0.0.M.U., and a member of the Lodge of Peace,
S.A.C., Victor Harbour.


WICKHAM & CANDY
"Wara" Stud O' Hallora n Hill, Shropshire Sheep and Berkshire Pigs
ELEVEN MONTHS OLD SHROPSHIRE RAMS AT “WARA.” THEY ARE BY A RAM THAT WAS SELECTED FROM THE
VICTORIAN “BETTER FARMING" TRAIN.
The enterprise of Messrs. Wickham & Candy in establishing
a sheep and pig stud farm in 1909 on the rich slopes of O’Halloran
Hill has been well rewarded. The property, which is located a
short distance from Adelaide at the southern end of the Mount
Lofty Range, covers 243 acres, and is known as the “Wara” stud.
About 45 acres of it is devoted to vines.
Beginning with the purchase of a dozen specially selected
Shropshire ewes from the stud of the late Chief Justice Way at
“Kadlunga,” a stud has been built up, the progeny of which are
eagerly sought by flockmasters all over Australia. Some of the rams
came from Aitken’s of Victoria and one from Mr. H. N. Thomas
of Manoora. Mr. Hawkins’ stud in Victoria was also drawn upon
for a couple of rams, and another was brought out from England
from Mr. E. Craig Tanner. One of the Hawkins rams was
previously a notable exhibit in the “better farming”
train sent out by the Victorian Government. Messrs.
Wickham & Candy’s latest purchase is two Shropshire
rams from Mr. E. Craig Tanner of England, which were shipped
in June this year. They were induced to make the importation
following upon excellent results obtained from a couple of ewes
from the same English breeder.
From these foundations, Messrs. Wickham & Candy have
produced a line of sheep that have made “Wara” famous. The
animals are noted for their strong constitutions, excellent vitality
and large frames. Line breeding is favoured in preference to in-
breeding, and the adaptability of the “Wara” stud sheep to any
climate is proved by orders received from all parts of
the Commonwealth. The policy of Messrs. Wickham and
Candy is never to depart from the carcase value
by trying to breed an open face. They consider that a
good export lamb will be produced from a Shropshire ram
with a crossbred ewe. The cross is hardy and will prove a good dual
purpose sheep for any district. The 1 wool goes about a 54 s quality
and as mutton producers they rank with the best. Farmers in
Western Australia who are keen buyers of “Wara” stock use them
extensively for crossbreeding The championships and other awards
secured by sheep raised by Messrs. Wickham & Candy form an
imposing array, especially when it is remembered that the stud was
formed in 1909 and the progeny have been shown during the past
ten years only. They commenced showing in 1917 with one entry,
and since then in nine years they have carried off six championships
and four reserve championships for rams. Another fine performance
was the winning of the Challenge Cup given by the Shropshire
Association of South Australia. The cup, which was worth 20
guineas, had to be won four times, and Messrs. Wickham & Candy
became the final possessors of it in 1927.
Careful handling of stud stock is laid down as an essential by
the proprietors of the “Wara” stud. This was exemplified when


the animals were rounded up for photographing by our representa-
tive. Quietness is observed to an exceptional degree in all the
operations at “Wara.’’
The general stock fodder provided by the “Wara" paddocks
is natural grasses such as clovers, rye grass, geranium, wallaby grass
etc. The rainfall averages 22 inches and topdressing is done every
year, one cwt. of 50 per cent mixture being applied. The land
carries from If to 2 sheep to the acre. The largest paddock is
only 15 acres in extent and Messrs. Wickham & Candy attribute
a good deal of their success in feeding to continuous changes from
paddock to paddock.
The pig breeding stud was formed in 1915. Berkshires were
selected as a basis, and the value of the O’Halloran Hill country
for this industry was quickly demonstrated. The “Wara’’ stud
pigs are known throughout the State, and their record in the show
ring is one that any breeder might envy. The first sow came from
Clarendon and another from Dashwood’s Gully. Since then, boars
and sows have been introduced from Victoria, including
“Goomalibee Chief," one of the finest boars in the Commonwealth.
“Goomalibee Chief" was champion in Melbourne in 1921, and
followed it with the Adelaide championship in 1922. Among the
purchasers of his progeny is the Government of South Australia,
and a judge once remarked that it would be a loss to the State if the
animal died. Stock from him are to be found in every part of
Australia.
“WARA MOSS QUEEN”
Champion sow at Adelaide in 1922, 1923, and 1924.
“WARA LAD,”
Champion Shropshire ram at Adelaide Royal Show, 1925, 1926 and 1927.
In their first year of exhibiting pigs at the Royal Agricultural
Society’s show in Adelaide, Messrs. Wickham & Candy secured a
championship. In boars their record is four champions and one
reserve champion. The sows have gained six championships and
three reserve championships. From 1922 onwards Messrs. Wickham
& Candy have not been beaten in the championship for sows at
the Adelaide Royal Show. Among the cups won by “Wara” pigs
is the Empire Challenge Cup, presented by the Berkshire Society
of England, which had to be won three times in any Royal Show.
This handsome all-beaten silver trophy went to Messrs. Wickham
& Candy in 1 925 and 1926, and was finally won by them in 1928.
The firm sell pigs for crossbreeding and stud purposes, but only
stud pigs are kept on the property. Eight is considered to be a good
average litter for a Berkshire sow. The size and constitution of
the pigs are held to be most important in the “Wara" stud.
The show records of Messrs. Wickham & Candy, in addition
to the champions and reserve champions already mentioned, are
42 firsts, 19 seconds, and 14 thirds, for Shropshire sheep and
Berkshire pigs. All these have been gained in nine years at Adelaide
Royal shows.
In addition to the stud farm, Messrs. Wickham & Candy
are vignerons, and have established an extensive trade in this
connection.


"YALE ROYAL." O'HALLQRAN HILL.
Miss Victoria Cholmondeley, Managing Director.
A HEALTHY LITTER AT "VALE ROYAL.”
“Vale Royal’’ at O'Halloran Hill is an attractive property
which has the distinction of being under the management of a
woman. In the old days it was an extensive vinery, cellars having
been built there when the late Mr. R. V. Cholmondeley took up
the estate in 1894. “Vale Royal’’ wines were marketed for many
years by Messrs. Cholmondeley and Bosanquet, but on the death
of Mr. Cholmondeley in 1918 the winemaking was discontinued.
The cellars and plant, capable of storing half a million gallons of
wine, are still in good condition.
The property is now devoted principally to the raising of
pigs, the managing director being Miss Victoria Cholmondeley, who
has proved that women can be quite as successful on the land as

men. Miss Cholmondeley was born in Tasmania, but was
educated in England. Attendance at the Agricultural College in
Shropshire resulted in her gaining a keen interest in livestock. Miss
Cholmondeley has visited America, where she studied pig-breeding
in California, the conditions there being somewhat similar to
those in South Australia.
The area of “Vale Royal’’ is about 73 acres, and Miss
Cholmondeley has been farming it for ten years. Since 1925,
however, the chief activity has been pig breeding. Barley and peas
are grown for these, also Sudan grass, maize, peas and cabbages.
The soil is rich and plentiful crops are obtained.
Considerable success has been obtained with Tamworth pigs,
which are bred for stud purposes, also as first crosses. Miss Chol-
mondeley recently secured a line of pure-bred Tamworths, and
included in the stud are some of the well-known Wickham and
Candy boars. The pigs are an exceptionally healthy lot, and are
entirely free from disease. They are always allowed to run out
and they mostly farrow out. Miss Cholmondeley states that the
South Australian pigs are quite equal to anything she saw in
California. The climatic conditions at O’Halloran Hill suit them
and stud buyers are assured of first-class stock. The litters
average 11.8.
The Berkshire-Tamworth cross, which Miss Cholmondeley has
developed, has brought about a good demand for pigs right up to
the third cross. Store pigs are also available for purchase.
A few sheep are kept to run in the pea stubble and Miss
Cholmondeley owns a couple of prize winning hunters. All the
stock on “Vale Royal’’ belongs to her. It is interesting to note
that the homestead, which is old and picturesque, gained its name
from one of the Cholmondeley ancestral homes in Cheshire.


G. K. SAUERBIER, Park.”
A VIEW OF THE HOMESTEAD AT “WICKHAM PARK.”
There has been a good deal of development in the fertile
McLaren Flat district during the past dozen years, particularly in
respect to sheep raising and vine growing. The land is notable
for numerous rich flats with lighter soil on the slopes and hillsides.
It can be put to many uses, and clearing operations have opened up
large tracts suitable for sheep.
Mr. G. K. Sauerbier realised the possibilities of the district
and in 1920 he took up an area of 670 acres and prepared it for
sheep raising. The 670 acres were transferred to him by Mr. G.
Sauerbier when the present owner came back from the war in 1920.
Mr. Sauerbier founded a stud of South Downs in December, 1926,
the basis of the flock being animals which were transferred from
Mr. George Sauerbier’s property at Port Noarlunga. The name
of the latter is widely known as a successful breeder of South Downs,
and he imported the first of them in 1900.
Mr. G. K. Sauerbier at present has a stud of 25 ewes and
10 rams which are doing exceptionally well on “Wickham Park,”
the name given to his estate. It lies about two miles east of
McLaren Flat. The South Downs are used to produce a fine
line of quick-developing fat lambs. First-cross ewes are employed
with a South Down ram. Suitable ewes are purchased, about 500
being run on the property. The pastures are good and prime
condition lambs are ready for market at from 5 to 8 months old.
There is always a big demand for them.
In addition to the fat lamb trade Mr. Sauerbier has interested
himself in the growing of tomatoes. These are cultivated on an
extensive scale under glass. The demand for them extends to
interstate as well as local markets, and so far the returns have been
very promising.
The heavy soil on the flats is well suited to the production of
root crops and good yields have been secured from an area of about
six acres devoted to potatoes. A small orchard gives an excellent
supply of fruit.

WILLIAM R. V. WADE, "MEADOWLEE” STUD, WILLUNGA.
On the right hand side of the South Road, half a mile before
reaching Willunga, nestles “Meadowlee” stud, a small but exception-
ally rich area on which Mr. William R. V. Wade breeds some of
the finest pigs in Australia. The property was taken up by him
in 1916 when it covered about 80 acres. In the early days it
belonged to the South Australian Company and at one time it
was regarded as the model farm of the South. Latterly the pro-
perty had not been scientificially worked and it was in rather a wild
state when Mr. Wade acquired it. Mr. Wade wanted it as a
mixed farming proposition and began with cows, pigs and a few
horses. New sties were built for the pigs and a dozen acres were
planted with vines. A drying shed was also erected for currants.
In 1927 Mr. Wade decided to go in extensively for pigs. He
founded a stud of Berkshires but came to the conclusion that
Middle Yorkshire were more suited to the district, and proceeded
to build up with this breed. A mid-York boar was secured from
Mr. H. C. Wright’s Marleston stud at Black Forest, and sows were
purchased from the Government farm at Turretfield. Nine more
sows were brought from Victoria. Mr. Wade began to exhibit
about 1 1 years ago, since when he has won practically every prize
possible in his classes at Adelaide, Willunga, Mount Barker, Strath-
albyn, Port Elliott, Yankalilla and Meadows. During that period
only four of his exhibits were unplaced.
One of Mr. Wade’s boars carried off nine championships, and
a sow was credited with eight championships awards. With other

pigs he has gained 1 6 further champions, and nine reserve champions.
The best boar he owned was “Marleston Prestwood,” which,
although constantly exhibited, had the wonderful record of being
unbeaten in any show. He gained the Australian championship
with this boar, which was the best Yorkshire entered in the Aus-
tralian Herd Book (three times). “Meadowlee Maid,” the finest
sow Mr. Wade has had, gained the distinction of the best entered
in the Australian Herd Book (three times). These animals were
the foundation of the Meadowlee Stud. “Marleston Prestwood”
was 12 years old when he was disposed of, and still retained his
shape even at that age. The following are some of the best pigs
bred at “Meadowlee” by Mr. Wade:—
“Meadowlee Prestwood,” boar, farrowed August 17, 1 922; sire, “Marl-
eston Prestwood.”
“Meadowlee Hero,” boar, littered January 14, 1925; sire, “Meadowlee Prest-
wood”; grandsire “Marleston Prestwood.” This boar is regarded as a coming
champion.
“Meadowlee Lotus,” first and reserve champion sow at Adelaide Royal
Show, littered May 12, 1926; by “Meadowlee Prestwood” out of “Meadowlee
Model.”
“Meadowlee Dehlia,” sow, littered March 15, 19 25.
“Meadowlee Model,” sow. This sow) has the unique record of averaging
only one short of a dozen in each of eleven litters. The most at one litter
was 15, and “Meadowlee Maid” once produced 16 in a litter. Since he has
been breeding pigs Mr. Wade has recorded an average litter of a trifle over 10.
Figures of eights are also impressive. “Marleston Prestwood” (boar)
weighted 894 lb., “Meadowlee Maid” (sow) 705 lb., “Meadowlee Prestwood”
(boar) 710 lb.


"Meadowlee” is particularly suited to pigs as all Mr. Wade’s
stock are exceptionally fast growers, making into first-class baconers
and porkers. They are remarkably hardy animals, very prolific,
and require no pampering. Mr. Wade has a definite order in hand
with a prominent bacon-curing factory to supply boars for their
own breeding. This speaks well for the bacon-making qualities
of the pigs from ‘’Meadowlee'' stud.
In Mr. Wade’s opinion the Mid-Yorks stand almost alone for
all purposes, and they are excellent for crossing with other breeds.
With these pigs one gets the length and depth of body so necessary
for bacon, and the hocks are also excellent. The pigs at
‘Meadowlee” are actually being bred to meet the requirements of
particular clients—a great testimony to the reliable and efficient
methods of Mr. Wade.
The land at ‘Meadowlee” is rich and attractive with numerous

shade trees. A creek running through the property gives permanent
water. It is excellent for stock and has been used with good
results in irrigating lucerne, which at times has grown to a height
of 3 ft. 9 in. The soil itself is a heavy black loam with ai clay
subsoil, the district rainfall being about 27 inches.
A fair amount of cultivation is carried on, peas, wheat and
oats being rotated. An average of 9 bags to the acre is secured
with peas, and Mr. Wade has never cut under 2| tons to the acre
of hay. Potatoes also do well, and mangels absolutely thrive.
Mr. Wade has raised mangels up to 54 lb. in weight and he has
yet to be beaten on the show bench for exhibits of this valuable
fodder. His potatoes have also been consistent prizewinners.
Many prizes were won in the earlier days of Mr. Wade for Jersey

cows and horses. Minorca fowls are specialised in by him and
behind them also is a prize winning record. In competition for
eggs going 2f oz. Mr. Wade hase been defeated only once. With
the awards for pig prizes Mr. Wade therefore has a collection of
cups and trophies that might well be envied by any mixed farmer
in the’ State.
Altogether 17 acres of land at “Meadowlee” is under vines
comprising twelve of Grenache and 5 of Zante currants. The
Grenache yield averages 3 J tons to the acre, all of it being turned
into the district wineries. The currants are dried on the property,
averaging a ton of dried fruit to the acre.
In addition to being one of the best worked and most pro-
ductive in the district, the farm is exceptionally well situated with
regard to markets, being available to two markets weekly.

KEN. C. SAUERBIER "The Downs," near McLaren Flat
A VIEW OF MR. KEN. C. SAUERBIER’S ESTATE.
f
A characteristic of the southern country is the strong hold
gained there by English sheep. They do well on these wet lands,
and the experience of Mr. Ken. C. Sauerbier at “The Downs,”
about four miles north-east of McLaren Flat is particularly encourag-
ing. The property which covers a little over 600 acres, all free-
hold, is undulating to hilly, with a rainfall of between 25 to 30
inches. On the flats the soil turns up a heavy black loam and
red clay. Geranium grass is the chief natural herbage and sub-
terranean clover also thrives well. The property is mostly cleared,
the remaining timber being some redgum, blue gum, sheaoak, and
wattles. A creek runs through “The Downs,” giving a permanent
supply of water.
Mr. Sauerbier has concentrated his activities upon the develop-
ment of South Down sheep, which are valuable for crossbreeding

to produce export lambs. He took up the property in 1924 and
founded a stud of South Downs secured from his father,
Mr. George Sauerbier, of “Jocklyn,” Port Noarlunga. The latter
who is a noted South Down breeder, established his flock in 1900
by importing a ram and three ewes from England. In 1905 he
imported another English-bred ram and four ewes.
The utmost care has been taken in maintaining the best South
Down characteristics in the “Jocklyn” flocks, and when Mr. Ken
Sauerbier established “The Downs” he selected 10 first-class ewes
from them as a foundation. His stud now numbers 76 ewes and
27 rams, all of them being of true South Down type. To main-
tain excellence of type Mr. Ken Sauerbier decided to import a ram
and a couple of ewes from England. These recently arrived
and represent a fine addition to “The Downs’ stud.
Mr. Ken Sauerbier met with immediate success at his first, time
of showing. He entered some speciments from his flock at the
1928 Royal Show in Adelaide and carried off the championship
for South Down ram and the championship for ewe. The
majority of the first and second prizes in the South Down classes
also fell to him. It was an excellent beginning which speaks well
for the knowledge of Mr. Sauerbier as a flockmaster and his personal
attention to every detail. He is also a heavy prizewinner at
country shows.
The homestead at “The Downs’’ is attractively situated. It
is a modern building of striking architectural design with all
modern conveniences.


A. A. HARPER & SON,
"Parklyn" Stud, Clarendon,
Clarendon holds the distinction of being one of the wettest
districts in South Australia. The country is extremely hilly, and
the valley in which the town has been built presents a delightful
rural picture. Crops and trees flourish in the rich red and black
loam flats and on the hillside slopes, and at “Parklyn,” situated
in one of the richest parts of Clarendon, Messrs. A. A. Harper and
Son have established a stud of Shropshire sheep that have rapidly
come to the fore in the prize ring. Mr. Harper first tried Merinos
and Dorset Horns, but the results have not approached those achieved
with Shropshires.
The estate now covers 365 acres of farming, orchard and
grazing country, all of which is freehold. The three-year-old
Shropshire ram, “Wara” (82) owned by Messrs. A. A. Harper
and Son, obtained second prize at the Adelaide Royal Show
in 1928, and six first and four championships at country
shows. First and second for ewes, and first and second
for young rams and young ewes have been gained at country
shows ever since the stud was started. A notable victory was the
winning of the Cup at the Willunga Show for the best pair of
British-breed ram and ewe, which had to be won twice by the same
exhibitor. A total of 26 Champion Ribbons have now been won
by the “Parklyn” stud.

3 -YEAR-OLD SHROPSHIRE RAM OWNED BY A. A. HARPER & SON.
A flock of about 300 crossbreds are maintained for fat lamb
production, the crossbred ewes being mated with Shropshire rams.
The lambs are marketed at about nine months, according to market
conditions, but they are usually forward and can be sent in as
young as five months. The lambing is carried out under the best
of conditions, an average of 90 per cent, being the rule.
Nature has been almost spendthrift in heaping advantages on
the Clarendon district. The rainfall is 33 inches a year. A
regular supply is available from the Onkaparinga River which runs
through “Parklyn,” and several springs carry excellent water. The
natural grasses on the estate are plentiful and subterranean clover is
well established.
In addition to the above stud, a number of shorthorn dairy
cows are maintained for production of milk, which is sent to the
S.A. Farmers’ Co-op Union.
Messrs. Harper 13 Son crop about 20 acres with wheat, peas,
(for topping lambs and wethers), also five acres of garden peas and
potatoes, and they have 10 acres of mixed fruits, principally
apples and pears. Every variety of fruit does well, and there is
always an abundance of it available.
The homestead is attractively situated on a hill which com-
mands a magnificent view of the fertile Clarendon Valley.


ALICK M. FULLER, "Galloway," Corriedale Stud, No. 174, A.C.S.A.S.B., Inman Valley
At “Galloway,” in the Inman Valley, Mr. Alick M. Fuller
has established a stud of the highly prized Corriedale sheep, and to
prove that there is a wonderful future in front of the heavier-rainfall
districts of the State in building up high-class flocks, he has gone
into the matter courageously and on scientific lines. “Galloway”
is a 400 acres tract of undulating to hilly land through the whole
length of which the River Inman runs. Along the river flats the
land is especially rich.
In conjunction with the State Agricultural Department Mr.
Fuller is carrying out experiments to see just what can be achieved
by intense culture of pastures. On an area of 15 acres he has
put down no fewer than 21 varieties of grasses and clovers, the
aim being to discover which are the most suitable for permanent
pastures. The climatic conditions and rainfall are favourable, and
everything favours a successful outcome of the scheme.
Mr. Fuller has had a life experience on the land and served
with the Australian Field Artillery in France during the war, after
which he spent some time studying agricultural conditions in Britain
under the A.I.F. educational scheme. Just prior to taking over
“Galloway” Mr. Fuller, with his wife, returned from an extended
tour of Great Britain, France, and Belgium, combining business with
pleasure.
Inman Valley and district is admirably suited to the
growing of subterranean clover and perennial pastures, and with
heavy topdressing of superphosphate, it is reasonable to expect these
pastures to carry five sheep per acre. Under natural conditions the
pastures would not carry more than one sheep per acre. Although
it is only two years since Mr. Fuller took over “Galloway” he has
been enabled to double the carrying capacity by the establishment
of improved pastures and liberal topdressings of super. Mr. Fuller
considers there is a wonderful future ahead of the Corriedale as a
dual-purpose sheep. It is a most suitable animal for the higher
rainfall districts as well as the agricultural districts, and when
mated with the crossbred or merino ewe gives an excellent lamb,
suitable for the butcher, or the keeping of the ewe lambs for breeding
purposes.
REGISTERED CORRIEDALE EWES GRAZING WITH LAMBS.
REGISTERED CORRIEDALE EWE LAMBS SEVEN MONTHS OLD,
BRED BY MR. A. M. FULLER.
His Corriedale stud is based on purely Lincoln-Merino lines,
and it can be traced back to parent flocks established in 1874. The
ewes were obtained from “Coola” stud at Mount Gambier, while
the rams came from the estate of Senator Guthrie, in Victoria, and
Mr. J. B. McFarlane, of New South Wales. Mr. Fuller intends
to make some further importations this year.
The 1928 drop lambs were by “G 21” imported from Mr.
D. Grant, of New Zealand, by Mr. J. R. Moodie, of Hamilton,
Victoria. In the 1929 inspection all the rams from this drop
gave a 100 per cent, pass and are now registered in the Australian
Corriedale Sheepbreeders’ Association flockbook for 1929.
The Corriedales are as good a dual purpose sheep as can
be found, the type having been fixed, being of especially
robust constitution and large framed, carrying a gbod
fleece of high quality wool of a 50’s to 56’s count. They
are capable of dressing 70 lb. when well kept. Another good
point is that they are wonderful mothers, the losses being extremely
small. As a matter of fact the present drop averages the magnificent
figure of 1 18 per cent, lambs.
The land at “Galloway” is mostly cleared, the trees kept for
shelter being principally red, blue, and pink gums. Mr. Fuller
is a firm advocate of intensive top dressing and establishment of
improved pastures, and the whole of the district is keenly interested
in his experiments. An annual field day has been inaugurated so
that they can see everything for themselves and receive full instruc-
tions.
The native grasses on “Galloway” include nearly all the native
clovers, and the valuable wallaby grass. Mr. Fuller aims at putting
down a paddock of subterranean clover, rye grasses, and cocksfoot
each year. The experimental plots will, of course, indicate what
is best to be sown. In the short time that Mr. Fuller has been
in possession of “Galloway” he has brought about a remarkable im-
provement and his investigations promise to be of the greatest value
to all landholders along the Inman Valley.


GEORGE ANGAS STACEY "Forktree," Normanville.
A GENERAL VIEW OF “FORKTREE” ESTATE, NORMANVILLE.
The Normanville district is sharing in the general develop-
ment that has occured in the near South-East during the past
decade or so. The rainfall is plentiful and large tracts in the
district are capable of raising the best sheep to be seen in South
Australia. Mr. George Angas Stacey is proving this on his
"Forktree” estate, situated two and a half miles north-east of
Normanville. He took it up in 1915, the area then being about
3,000 acres of freehold, 600 acres of perpetual lease, which is now
in his son’s name, and 464 acres of leasehold. To-day the area
CROSSBRED WETHERS AT “FORKTREE ” CONSIDERED TO BE
AMONG THE FINEST IN THE STATE.
controlled by Mr. Stacey runs into about 4,000 acres of freehold
and a thousand or so acres of leasehold.
“Forktree” is hilly country suitable for agricultural and
pastoral purposes, 200 acres being rich flats. About 400 acres
are cropped each year with oats, peas, barley, and some wheat,
all being used for stock fodder. It is a noted oat-growing country,
an average yield of 30 to 40 bushels being secured. Algerian are
preferred by Mr. Stacey. Some of the land is adapted to the
cultivation of peas and some good crops of the Dun variety have
been taken off.
Mr. Stacey stocks about 6,000 merinos and crossbreds, using
the Lincoln cross. A couple of hundred of the merino ewes are
stud animals. It is excellent fattening territory, and Mr. Stacey
has seldom been beaten at country shows for fat sheep. Of late
years he has been the principal prizetaker with these at the Yanka-
lilla, Willunga, and Port Elliot shows. The wethers now running
on “Forktree” are some of the best that can be found in South
Australia. Crossbred ewes and comeback ewes are regarded in the
southern districts as being the finest possible for the breeding of
fat lambs for export. Some of the wethers will dress the magnifi-
cent average of 112 lb.
The wool from the stud sheep is about a 64's quality and
at the last Yankalilla and Southern shows eleven ewes exhibited by
Mr. Stacey cut 16 lb. each. All the sheep produce a good weight of
wool, and great advantage is derived from the fact that they are
running on particularly healthy country.


A PARTICULARLY FINE VIEW OF THE COAST IS OBTAINABLE FROM HERE.
The land at “Forktree” under natural conditions carries a
ewe and a lamb, or two dry sheep, to the acre. Mr. Stacey was
quick to realise the value of topdressing the pastures and for some
time he has treated 300 to 400 acres each year. After three top-
dressings the land will double its carrying capacity and Mr. Stacey
is so satisfied with the results that he intends to substantially
increase the supered area.
In addition to the supplies of fodder that are cultivated on it,
“Forktree” is well supplied with natural grasses. Chief among
these are clovers, geranium and barley grass. There is also a
quantity of dandelion.
No trouble is experienced with water supplies. The average
annual rainfall is 22 inches. The chief source relied on, however,
is from natural springs. One of the finest springs to be found in
the district is on Mr. Stacey’s property, and two dams conserve
another large supply. The water is pumped to different parts of
the estate.
Mr. Stacey is a noted prizetaker at southern shows with his
Clydesdale horses. His teams run into about 30 workers, and
with one horse he has secured nd fewer than 35 first-prize awards.
A few dairy shorthorn cattle are also maintained, some of them
being from the famous “Rosebank” herd. There are also prize-
takers among these.
The homestead at “Forktree” is comfortable and substantial
with all modern conveniences including telephone and electric light.
It is very pleasantly situated, overlooking the Gulf. The view,
especially on a clear day, unfolds one of the finest coastal panoramas
to be seen in South Australia.

HURTLE MARTIN, "Orange Grove," Inman Valley.
A VIEW OF THE “ORANGE GROVE" SITUATED IN INMAN VALLEY.
One of the charms of Victor Harbour is its large expanse of
interesting inland scenery as well as rugged coastline. One of the
most picturesque trips is along the valley of the Inman, a very rich
territory that was settled in the earliest days of the State.
An especially popular spot in Inman Valley is “Orange Grove,”
a property owned by Mr. Hurtle Martin, which is a great attraction
to visitors and tourists. “Orange Grove” is a pleasant run of
nine and a half miles west from Victor Harbour. The late Mr.
Richard Martin, father of the present owner, took up about 2,000
acres there 55 years ago, and used it for grazing.
Mr. Hurtle Martin acquired about 500 acres of the original
holding and turned 21 acres of it into an orangery. The first trees
were planted a quarter of a century ago, principally the luscious
Washington Navel, with about 400 of ordinary varieties. The
land is undulating to hilly and water from a creek that runs all
the year round supplies the whole of the orchard.
The fame of the orangery soon spread and with a constantly
increasing stream of visitors, Mr. Martin decided to cater for
them on an extensive scale. About five years ago a kiosk was
erected at which morning and afternoon tea and light luncheons
are available. The spot is a delightful one on summer evenings,
and is ideally situated for dance parties. A good floor is provided,
with music from a modern pionola.
The day-time charms of the “Orange Grove” are very
attractive and a visit to Victor Harbour is scarcely complete without
a picnic party visit to this Arcadian spot. In its setting of orange
trees, hills and dales, the kiosk makes a pretty picture. The
catering service with the best of farm products and home-made
eatables is particularly good, while visitors can also secure the finest
South Australian oranges straight from the tree.
The oranges grown here are of excellent type and are especially
suitable for Big Orange drinks and for home consumption. The
largest oranges range up to H lb. in weight. There is a good
demand for them from the Adelaide market which takes between
3,000 and 4,000 cases. The district is a very healthy one and
the trees do not have to be treated for disease.
The views on this page give a slight idea of the attractions of
the “Orange Grove” which has rapidly developed into one of the
show picnic spots adjacent to Victor Harbour.
