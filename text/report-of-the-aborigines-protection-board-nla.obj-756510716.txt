Aborigines Protection Board Office,
Perth, 21st April, 1887.
Sir,
Assuming that Your Excellency may be desirous of being made acquainted wi+h the
pi oceedings and transactions of the Aborigines Protection Board since its institution up to
date, and that it is expedient for us to render a report,—We, the Chairman and Members of ti
Board, have the honor to submit to Your Excellency the following particulars of what has beei
done.
2. The Board were appointed on the 6th of January, 1887, by notification in the
(Government Gazette.
3. In accordance with “ The Aborigines Protection Act, 1886,” Protectors of Aborigines
have been appointed in the different Magisterial Districts of the Colony. One of the duties of
these Protectors is to report to the Board from time to time as to the wants and treatment of
Aborigines in their districts. A number of very interesting reports have been received, which
doubtlessly will be of great utility to the Board in their future operations.
4. Owing to the very short time that the Board has been in existence, their operations
have hardly as yet assumed a definite form; but they hope after this year to give a full and
complete report of their actions in regard to all the duties which by statute devolve on them.
We have, &c.,
MALCOLM ERASER, Colonial Secretary,
Chairman.
C. N. WARTON, Attorney General.
ALFRED R. WAYLEN, M.D., Colonial Surgeon, P.M.O.
