“THE DIGGERS FOUGHT LIKE DEMONS”
(To the Non—flossed Wow.)
“ Shakes (disap)pear in Durban.”
Extract from 8.8. C. broadcast of accounts by Italian officers captured at Bardia: “The Australians
fought like demons.”
Extracts from “The Natal Mercury,” Jan. 16th, 1941: —“People
celebrate victories in various ways Durbanites have celebrated the
British victories in North Africa by methodically removing their black-out
curtains. For some months past Durban houses have been steeped in
Stygian gloom on account of permanent black-out accessories. Those who
were most scrupulous .... applied liberal quantities of black paint to
their windows. Almost the first result of the fall of Bardia was the
appearance in, Durban of hundreds of hcuseboys armed with knives, scrapers
and turpentine at the windows of innumerable homes.”
“THE AUSSIES FOUGHT LIKE DEMONS,” NOW, YOU, SIR, TOO, ARE TAKING
Is what the Italians say
Who met their steel at Bardia .
When the Diggers won the day.
Oh, iia>py day for Africa
That Bill—Jim has won through
And put the wind-up Musso’s hordes
From here to Timbuctoo.
WE’RE TAKING DOWN OUR BLACK-
OUT BLINDS
(From fear of raids released)
Since “ Mick ” went—to-it on our soil
Up North in Middle East.
DOWN
The “ black-outs ” which you braided
Your windows with, when we felt sure
That Durban would be raided.
Now vanished are our air-raid fears
For Bill-Jim in the North
Has broken Mussolini’s hunch
To send his bombers forth.
AND GIVEN HIM A “RIGHT-ABOUT”—
Worth writing home about!
Beyond Tobruk and Derna, now
The Wops are in full rout!
Say, Non-plussed Wow, your grouse against Oh, Non-plussed Wow, if not too fat.
These “ Micks ” is waxing thin.
You can’t find any kindred souls
Go down upon your knees
And thank your stars that the Australians
Came across the seas.
To you to listen—in.
LOOK UP INTO OUR NICE SAFE SKIES
(That is if your stiff neck
SO LATELY LIKE A LEAKY TAP
Your false aspersions dribbled—
Your fertile brain sought out small motes Will bend so far). Look all around
With which you greatly quibbled;
A juggler could not bring more hares
Nor mare’s-nests from his sleeve
Where might have lain the wreck
Of Durban, if Italian ’planes
Had dive-bombed our fair town —
At any rate, you, like us all,
Than you about the Diggers’ doings.
Here, have made—believe.
ARE TAKING “BLACK-OUTS” DOWN!
