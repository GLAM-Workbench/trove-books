PROPOSALS MADE TO THE BRITISH GOVERNMENT TO COLONIZE THE SOUTHERN
CONTINENT, IN THE SIXTEENTH
As early as the fifteenth year of Elizabeth, papers
were laid before Her Majesty representing the advan-
tages which would be likely to accrue to her kingdom
and people from the discovery and settling of lands
not already taken possession of by the Portuguese,
Spaniards or French, and especially of those countries
lying beyond the equator. These countries, though
only to be reached by crossing the torrid zone, were
believed to possess a climate like to their own.* A
later project in Secretary Walsingham’s handwriting,
for establishing a Company to trade beyond the Equi-
noctial line—Drake to be Governor for life —is still in
existence in the Record Office, London. Phis was
prepared in 1580, just after Drake’s return home from
his voyage round the world.
The Terra Australis, touched at by Portuguese and
Spanish voyagers, and known to lie within and with-
out the Tropic of Capricorn, was supposed to extend
round the South Pole. It is thus delineated on old
globes and mappemondes (1530-69), and it is so de-
scribed in Beste’s account of Frobisher’s First Voyage
(1578) ; parts already known being those lying over
against Capo d’Buona Speranza [i.e. Western Aus-
tralia], whither the Portuguese in their voyages to
India had been driven out of their direct course by
storms. The survivors of Magellan’s expedition had

seen the North-West and Western coasts in their
homeward voyage in February and March, 1522.
The only English Colonies settled or attempted in
the reigns of Elizabeth and her successor were those
in North America and Guiana.
In the meantime, Pedro Fernandez de Quiros having
discovered what he believed to be portions of the
Terra Australis in the South Sea \i.e. Santa Cruz
and the New Hebrides] had petitioned Philip the
Third of Spain to Colonize that part lest it should he
taken possession of by the English. All the known
Memorials of Quiros have been recently published
(Madrid, 1877-82) together with narratives of his
voyages in 1595 and 1606, and the preceding voyage
of Mendana to the Solomon Islands in 1567.+ One of
Quiros’ Memorials falling into the hands of Gresley,
Secretary to the English Embassy at the Spanish
Court, it was by him forwarded to his government
(1610). I
Raleigh’s First Colony in North America (1587)
had not succeeded ; but other Settlements in Virginia
and New England despite Spanish protests were now
being planted with some measure of success. Sir
James Lancaster, who had made voyages to the
| The Bibliography of Mendana’s and Quiros*, and of
other proposals to Colonize the Southern parts of the world on
behalf of Spain, will be found in the Section “Voyages” and
the works of Bishop Hall, Jacques Sadeur [Gabriel Foigny]
&c., among “Imaginary Voyages.” In the English
translation of Sadeur (1693) the names “Australia” for the
country and “ Australians ” for its inhabitants are used through-
out the work.
1 An English translation was printed in London, 1617 ; re-
printed [1723?]. To his discovery Quiros had given the name
Australia del Espiritu Santo , in honour of Philip the Third,
as head of the House of Austria, and because f rmal possession
of it had been taken upon his Majesty’s birthda: ;he Festival of
the Holy Spirit. In printing a corrected Eni 'sh translation,

East Indies, frequently proposed to have a ship sent
through the Strait of Magellan to the Solomon
Islands ; but without result. The policy of James the
First, too deferential towards that of Spain, did not
favour colonization.
In the last year of his reign, however, ah eminent
London merchant—probably the most enterprising
English merchant of his time—Sir William Courteen,
desiring to extend his trade to the Terra Australis,
petitioned the King for the privilege of erecting
Colonies therein. Sir William, who was joint-owner
of more than twenty ships of burden, employing four
or five thousand seamen, already carried on an exten-
sive trade on his own account to Portugal, Spain,
Guinea, and the West Indies. The following is a
copy of his petition, not printed before :
To the Kings most Excellent Ma tie
The humble peticon of S r William Courten Kn t
Most humbly sheweth vnto your Ma tie
That all the lands in y e South parts of y e world called Terra Australis incognita

Ma ties lofig and happie raigne.
Having lent large sums of money to the King, Sir
William Courteen had some claim upon His Majesty’s
consideration. But it does not appear that “ All ye
said islands and territories ” were granted to him.
He appears to have been satisfied with a bad title to
the island of Barbados, where he sent (1626) fifty
settlers, who built a fort {1627) and remained there
till it was taken from them (1628). He then sent
eighty men to the island and re-took it in the name of
the Earl of Pembroke. Sir William died in 1636.
His son’s claim to the title was not deemed a good
one, and was disallowed in 1660.
EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.
The geographers of the early part of the eighteenth
century continued to describe the Terra Australis
after the manner of their predecessors, adding from
time to time the names given to new discoveries,
chiefly those of the Dutch. Occasionally the philoso-
phers discussed the subject.

BIBLIOGRAPHY OF AUSTRALASIA.


The next item has relation to one of the numerous
projects of the time of George the First. As I know
of one copy only of the original—in the Bibliotheque
Nationale, Paris —I give it in full in the original
spelling. In the light of present knowledge this
document is of great interest: both from the truth of
the promoter’s conjecture as to the Southern Country’s
richness in the precious metals and from his use of
the name “New Wales,” fifty years before Cook’s
discovery and naming of New South Wales.
Captain _/ ohlVelbe
PROPOSALS
FOR
Establishing a Company by the name of the London
Adventurers for carrying on a Trade to (and settling
Colonies in) Terra Australis , and Working and Improving
the Gold and Silver Mines which there abound.
HEREAS ’tis well known that there is no nation that do Trade from the South
WSeas to the East Indies but the Spaniards, whose India trade is from Aca-pulco
(on the Coast of Mexico, in the South Seas) to the Philippine Islands in the
East Indies, which ships, in going, keep always in the North East Trade Wind ;
and in coming back they run to 40 or 45 Degrees North, to meet with a Westerly Wind, to
run them to the Eastward, for which Reason those Southern parts are not yet fully discover’d,
nor any part of them settled by any European whatsoever, they lying out of the way of all
Trading Ships.
If we look back and trace the Course of those European Ships Voyages that have
sailed round the Globe, it may be easily seen how far they were from making any Discoveries
in those Southern Parts, the Course of their Voyages not giving them any Opportunity for
so doing.
Magellanus, the Discoverer of the Sereights, called after his Name, the first that sail’d
West from the South Seas to the East Indies, sailed along the Coasts of Peru and Mexico,
till he came to California , and thence took his Departure for India, keeping in the North
East Trade Wind.
Sir Francis Drake said to be the first Commander that sail’d round the Globe ( Magellanus
being kill’d by the Indians at Mindano Island) kept the Coast of Peru and Mexico on board,
and sail’d West for India , in the North East Trade Wind.
Sir Thomas Cavendish the same.
Captain Swann, one of the Buccaneers of America, with whom Captain Dampier sail’d
the first time round the Globe, kept in the North-East Trade Wind from California to India,
and was kill’d at Mindano, as Magellanus was.
Captain Rogers in the Duke and Dutchess, with the Aca-pulco Ship, kept likewise in the
North-East Trade Wind.
It is here to be observ’d that from the Coast of Pnu West, to the East Indies, is upwards
of 2,500 Leagues, which to the Southward of the Line is undiscover’d to any European,
(Captain Welbe excepted) who, in the course of his Voyage round the World with Captain
Dampier, in the Year 1703, 1704, 1705, and 1706, having many extraordinary Opportunities
of satisfying and informing himself what Discoveries had been made, by Order of the
Viceroys of Peru, for 150 Years past: Was thereby well assured, that the islands, named (by
the said Captain Welbe) St. George's Islands and New Wales, and some other Islands there-
abouts, which abound with Mines of Gold and Silver, belong to no European Prince or State,
and are therefore free for the first Discoverer to take Possession of, which Mines the Under-
taker doubts not to prove, will enrich the British Nation upwards of 50,000,000 Sterling, if
taken Possession of, and Colonies settled, which is not half what the Kingdom of Peru has
produc’d to the Spaniards since their first Settlement there, under Francisco Pizaro, the
first Viceroy.

NEW SOUTH WALES.


It is therefore propos’d that a Joint Stock, not exceeding 2,500,000 be raised to fit out
Ships, and settle Colonies forthwith, that the Improvement and Advantages of such Valuable
Discoveries may not be lost. And in order thereto, the said Captain Welbe is now ready to
grant Permits to such Persons who are willing to be Proprietors and Adventurers in this said
Undertaking. On Grant of which Permits, the Proprietors are to pay in is. on every Share,
viz., 1 os. for 1,000/. to enable the Undertaker to apply for, and obtain a Patent, and defray
other charges; and no more is to be paid in until at a General Meeting of, and by the
Proprietors, Directors, and Treasurers be chosen; and then no more on each Share than
what the Directors, at such Meeting, shall agree on, and find necessary for carrying on
effectually so valuable and advantagious a Trade.
N. B.— The proposer has no sinister Ends, nor Self-Interest, In View, and expects no Pay,
nor any Reward, but such Part
themselves shall think fit, and a
the neat Produce of Profits, as the Directors
to allow him.
agree,
Among the Sloan MSS. (British Museum) is an
earlier proposal by Capt. Welbe to the British Govern-
ment for a full discovery of the Terra Australis. But
none of his proposals or his petitions appear to have had
any result. His long-waiting, however, brought him
to distress and a debtors’ prison. Two years later
the following memorials—advising the settlement of
colonies in South Africa and South Australia —were
published in Amsterdam :
Collation : Title, Advertisement [Sketch of Authors’
Life], Address to my Lords the Deputies to the
Assembly of Seventeen Representatives of the General
Company of the East Indies of the Low Countries,
Method, &c.
The ‘ ‘ Advertisement ” is as follows
John Peter Purry, the Author of the following Memorial,
was born at Neufchatel in Switzerland , about the year lxx of
the last century, who, having engaged for some time in the wine
trade, and meeting with misfortunes in it, contracted himself
to the Chamber of Amsterdam for the East Indies in Batavia
about the beginning of 1713; where by his Plantations and by
being Reader to the Reform’d Church in that City, having pretty
well repair’d his Fortune, in the Year 1717, he presented to the
Governor-General of the East India Company, a proposal for
settling a Colony in the Land of Nights, not far from the Isle
of Java, which not having the good Fortune to be Approv’d of,
he obtained leave to return to Europe.
In doubling the Cape of Good Hope , he was so taken with
the admirable Colonies he found there, that he was more and
more confirm’d in the Thought of immortalizing his Name with
some settlement in the 33rd Degree, either of Northern or
Southern Latitude. Arriving at Amsterdam in 1718, he pre-
sented there in French the Memorial we now give the Reader
in English, to the Lords the Directors of the Diitch East India
Company , who determine all matters relating to it. Neither
this Memorial, nor another which accompanied it, were well
receiv’d, insomuch that a Friend of his told him privately he
had best get out of the Way, for that some Things had been
observed in both Papers which ought not to be made public. He
took the advice, and went into France ; from whence he made a
Tour into his own Country. But returning to Paris in that fatal
year 1720, he lost in the Mississippi Company, what he had
got in the East Indies. Here his former scheme reviv’d and
having modell’d it to the French settlements, he presented it
to some of the Prime Ministers, who referr’d it to the Royal
Academy of Sciences. Mons. Fontenelle return’d this cautious
Answer, that they could not pass a Judgment on a Country
which they had never seen, and that therefore it would not
be advisable to make expensive settlements in Places they were
with. This was all the Determination that could
be got frcm him. The Joicrnal des Scavans, however, took
notice of he Proposal, -and gave a fair Representation of it.
Rejected a Second Time, Mr. Furry came into England, and
printed his Proposal here for establishing a Colony on the
English coast of America, Southward enough for his favourite
Degree. It was presented to the Duke of New Castle as he was
walking with the King at Kensington in 1721. But neither here
could his Scheme boast of the expected Approbation. I remember
however that Sir Isaac Newton, to whom I communicated it,
agreed in general to the principles of it, with a Proviso that the
Nature of each Country and Soil should be first examin’d before
settlements were attempted.
But about this time Georgia beginning to be talk’d of, Mr.
Purry at the request of some Merchants, who wanted to know
the condition of that Country, went thither. At his Arrival, he
first took a general Survey of it, then pass’d into Switzerlaiid,
and brought from thence enough of his Countrymen to establish
a small Colony, at the extremity of Carolina, just upon the River
which divides it from Georgia, where he died about ten years
since, in an advanced age; having first built a Town as a
Monument to himself, which still bears the name of Purisburg.

[HIS
BIBLIOGRAPHY OF AUSTRALASIA.


At this time the learned and accomplished Monsieur
de Maupertuis having accepted an invitation from
Frederic the Great to settle in Berlin, he there ad-
dressed his Letter to the King of Prussia on the Progress
of the Sciences. Among the sciences whose improve-
ment stood in need of the support of a sovereign were
foreign discoveries, and first of all, that of the Terra
Australis.
In the Terra Australis, the eminent savant believed there
would be found species different from what are contained in any
other parts of the world, for they never could have gone out of
their own continent. Near the same were islands in which
“navigators assure us they have seen savages, men covered with
hair, having tails; a middle species, between a monkey and a
man. I would rather,” he writes, “ have an hour’s conversation
with one of these than with the greatest wit in Europe.”—See
English translation in Appendix to “ The Schemer; or, Universal
Satirist, by that great philosopher Heltervan Seeker,’’London,
1763, pp. 249 et seq.
Charles De Brasses, President of the Parliament of
Dijon, also collected in two quarto volumes (Paris,
1756) the accounts of all the Voyages which had been
made to Terres Australes. De Brasses divided his
work into three sections, viz.: Austral-Asia, Poly-
nesia, and Magellanica.
The subject is also treated in Harris’s Voyages
(2 vols., folio, London, 1744-48), Vol. I. sect. 22,
by Dr. John Campbell (?) and again in
Terra Australis ; or, A History of the Southern
Continent. [Book XIV., Chap. XII., of Universal
History] being Vol, XI. of Modern History, pp.
2 73-553- London. 1759.
The writer (probably Harris’s editor) suggested that the
African Company should be invested with the exclusive right of
making discoveries and settlements in the Southern Continent.
If neither the African nor the East India Companies should think
it expedient or consistent with their interests to establish such
settlements,'he thought the duty should then devolve upon the
South Sea Company, who by their charter had the power to
do so.
An English translation of De Brasses, with addi-
tions, was printed in three volumes, Bvo. (Edinburgh,
1766-68). At the end of the third volume (pp. 715-745)
the editor, John Callander, added a chapter :
“ Of the Method of Forming Colonies in the Terra
Australis, and the Advantages that may be expected
to result to Great Britain from Such Establishments
in that Hemisphere.”
The writer,_ following De Brasses, advises the Settlement of
New Britain, in Australasia, as being in the most advantageous
situation with respect to the Countries where commerce was
already established. “Another advantage,” he adds, “that
distinguishes it, is the climate, as lying not far from the Equator,
where (according to Dampier) we may always expect to find
more materials for commerce, than in higher latitudes; Van
Diemen s Land and New Zealand lie far to the South and are
little known. The coasts of New Holland are of very difficult
access, and the parts that lie next the South Sea, absolutely
naked and barren. Carpentaria labours under the same dis-
advantage. None of these places ever appear fit for the first
attempts, though they may be settled afterwards, and perhaps to
advantage. . . . Both Roggewein and Dampier agree in giving
preference to New Britain. _ De Brasses ( Terres Australes,
tome 11., p. 385) thinks there is no place so proper as this to fix
on. He proposes to settle it by sending three ships from
Pondicherry ” (pp. 742-43).
b rom this time forward voyages were made for the
sake of science rather than plunder. In 1764-68 three
expeditions—including vessels under the command of
Byron, Wallis, Carteret, and Cook—were sent to the
South Seas under the patronage of King George the
Third. Alexander Dalrymple, who had been in the
East India Company’s Service, and had returned
home to advocate Southern Discoveries, hoped to have
received the command of the Expedition sent out
under Cook the object of which was primarily to
observe the transit of Venus in the Island of Tahiti.
He published—
An Account of the Discoveries made in the
South Pacifick Ocean previous to 1764. Part I.
Bvo. pp. xxxi. 103 with charts. London. 1767.
Not being chosen—a Naval Officer being indispensable
Ualrymple subsequently continued his researches
and produced :
Historical Collection of the Several Voyages
and Discoveries in the South Pacific Ocean.
With maps. 2 vols. qto. London. 1770-71.
To the three Divisions of De Brasses, Dalrymple pro-
posed to add a fourth— Australia, thus reviving a
name used before, but which had lapsed for nearly a
century. *
The advantages to that Power which should secure
a footing in the Southern part of the world foretold
by Quires- —long since forgotten, but more recently re-
vived by De Brasses and Dalrymple—were made
manifest upon Cook’s return. He had discovered the
insularity of New Zealand and sailed all along the
East Coast of New Holland, which he named New
South Wales. t These advantages which had now
been secured for Great Britain were emphasized in :
Political Essays concerning the Present State of
the British Empire. 4to. London, 1772. pp. 3,
463, 464.
This may be considered the last word of the pre-
colonial advocates of Australian Colonization, for in
1776 the Declaration of Independence by the Thirteen
Colonies of North America stopped the transportation
of English Criminals there. And “loyal” Colonists
were seeking new settlements : some removed to
Canada and Nova Scotia: others thought of emigra-
ting to the Southern Continent. James Maria Matra,
dating from Frame, Somersetshire, August 1783,
proposed to the Home Government that New South
Wales should be set apart for their reception, where
they might repair their broken fortunes.
Capt. Sir George Yonge, R.N., submitted another
plan (Jan. 1785) which was printed | :
The Following is a Rough Outline of the Many
Advantages that may result to this Nation, from a
Settlement made on the Coast of New South
Wales, folio, pp. 4. [London. 1785.]
These schemes § were duly considered, and resulted
in the determination on the part of the Govern-
ment to utilize New South Wales as a Penal Settlement,
a decision arrived at during 1786. The subject was
debated in and out of Parliament. John Howard
considered the “Botany Bay Scheme” as “expen-
sive, dangerous, and destructive.” Others advised the
establishment of Penal Colonies nearer home or in
smaller islands in mid-ocean, such as that of Tristan
d’Acunha. With these writers, the Bibliography of
New South Wales and Australian Colonization
properly begins.

Publick on the Intended Thief-Colony at Botany Bay.
[By Alex. Dalrymple, Hydrographer to the Admiralty.]

Dalrymple recommended the Island of Tristan d’Acunha as
more suitable for a Penal Colony than Botany Bay. The pam-
phlet (written in September and October, 1786) includes a letter
(dated July, 1785) addressed by the Author to the Directors of
East India Company, advising them against a project for settling
Norfolk Island, which was then within the limits of the Com-
pany’s Charter.

Lists of Convicts and the Ships by which they
arrived were at one time in existence in the Colony.
It is doubtful if they are now extant. Phillip’s
“ Voyage” gives a long list of those who were sent
out in the “first fleet,” but as a large number died
before leaving England and during the voyage, it
cannot be called a list of “ Arrivals.”

Upon the conclusion of this work in parts, it was followed by

Both volumes were re-issued in 1810: pages 465 to end (p. 476)
of the “Voyage” are re-arranged, and include descriptions of
several plates from the “History” to which readers had been
referred for accounts in the first edition. There is also a preface
to the latest edition of the “Voyage,” and an Account of Bar-
rington's death, and of the property he left in the Colony. To
the new edition of the “History,” a Supplement is added,
bringing that work down to 1809, with a new index, making
altogether 548 pages.

to which is added his Life and Trial. Svo.
pp, iv. 184. New York. n.d.
These works were compiled in London. A comparison with
the works of Phillip, Collins (1798), &c., will discover their
true origin. In an anonymous work on New South Wales.
[By G. Paterson, see 1811], the writer says (pp. 390-391) that
“For a considerable time previous to his death, Barrington was
in a state of insanity brought about by his serious and sorrowful
reflections on his former career of iniquity He expressed
a very considerable degree of displeasure, when he was in a state
of sanity, at his name being affixed to a narrative, which he
knew only by report, as being about to be published.” See also
Turnbull's Voyage (3 vols.) Vol. I. p. 54 ; 4toedit. pp. 81 —82.
The celebrated “ Prologue ” said to have been spoken at a
Theatrical performance in Sydney, 16th Jan., 1796, including
'.fie lines
“ True patriots [We] for be it understood,
We left our country for our country’s good,”
and which appears in “ Barrington’s History ” (edit. 1802 and
1810, pp. 152-153) has often been attributed to him, but in all
probability it was written by the compiler, or compilers, in
London. The de tails of the performance even to the names of the
principal performers, are evidently taken from Collins (edit.
1798, pp. 448-449), but as Collins says nothing about the “Pro-
logue,” it may be inferred that it was not written or recited
in the Colony—more especially as it does not appear in the
earlier “ Barrington” of 1800. See page 8.

The Essays and fragments collected in this volume were
gleaned by a commercial gentleman whose business relations
brought him into connexion with Travellers, Merchants, and
Ship-owners. The pieces having reference to New South Wales
are ;
(1) Remarks on Reading in Phillips’ Collection
(June 1810) a French Voyage to New South Wales
[on Floods in the Hawkesbury, &c.]
(2) Present State of the Colony in New South
Wales, related to me February 14, 1809, by the
Rev. Mr. Marsden the Chaplain, pp. 180-186.
(3) Copy of a Letter, dated Sydney, May 23, 1805,
received October xoth, 1805 —half a year ! —from an
Officer’s Wife, Mrs. Hartley, to her sister in Beverley,
Mrs. . pp. 186-188.
This is the letter referred to by West {Hist, of Tasmania , I.
p. 30) and by Bonwick {Port Phillip Settlements, p. 79).
Much to Mrs. Hartley’s regret, Lieut.-Gov. Collins settled his
Colony at the River Derwent, in V, D, Land, in preference to
Port Phillip. “My pen,” she writes, “is not able to describe
half the beauties of that delightful 5p0t,”.... “ Port Phillip is
my favourite, and has my warmest wishes. During the time we
were there [three months] I never felt one ache or pain, and I
parted from it with more regret than 1 did from my native
land.”

A Letter, pp. 188-191,
(5) From a Letter in 1796 or 7. p. 192,

MELLISH. A Convict’s Recollections of New
South Wales. Written by Himself. An Account of
the Treatment of Convicts, and how they are dispos’d
of in New South Wales. A Fragment. •
London Mag. N.S. Vol. 11. 49-67. May, 1825.
French Translation : Souvenirs d’un Deporte
4 laNouvelle-Galles du Sud.— Revue Britannique,
Vol. VIII. pp. 108-153. Paris. 1826.
The genuine composition of one Mellish who had returned
from Transportation, and being again committed to the gaol of
one of the Midland Counties, recorded his experiences for the
amusement of the gaoler’s wife in a copy-book, which was filled
even to the covers. On the back was inscribed “ Mellish’s
Book of Botany Bay.” The period described is that of
Governor Macquarie, from 1810 to about 1815. Mellish tells
of life aboard the convict-ship, the manner convicts were en-
gaged by settlers on arrival at the “Bay”-—Government first
securing the mechanics; condition of tickets-of-leave; female
convicts ; up-country life, cattle and sheep stations ; the natives
and some of their customs ; the native dog, kangaroo, bandicoot,
insects, birds, &c. When Mellish left the “ Bay,” he shipped
himself as “servant to a gentleman and lady which had been
convicts, but had accumulated enough to retire to England with.”
But, bringing with him six stowaways, who were soon after-
wards discovered, he with them, was confined in the hold till
the vessel arrived at the Cape, where they were all put ashore
and left. The story breaks off abruptly, and in the middle of a
sentence, so that we do not know how Mellish found his way
“ Home Again.”

success, and worse than that, worn out and exhausted in body
and purse....hundreds have been totally ruined—scores have
made fortunes—hundreds have done pretty well—thousands
have done nothing—and many have found a grave.... Wb all
conceived the opportunity had come for making a fortune, and
have endeavoured to embrace it, and have wished others to
share in it, but like a ‘ will-o’-the-wisp ‘ it has receded as we
have endeavoured to grasp it; and it will ruin the whole country
unless the pastoral and agricultural interests can hold their
position as well as the gold. At present they are entirely
neglected, and we may look upon the country as already
lost ”
