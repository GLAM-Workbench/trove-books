THE MAN-WOMAN
MYSTERY.
Tue aphorism that “Truth is stranger than fiction” is rapidly becoming
a truism. Without reading Robert Dale Owen’s definitions of what is
mysterious and what natural, and considering his many carefully adduced
instances of those every-day occurrences to us that were beyond the wildest
flights of the imagination of our forefathers a few centuries ago ; without
regard to the religious science or scientific religion in whose support he
writes, we have in ourexperience and our own consciousness full and sufficient
proof that these advanced times are realising not only the most wonderful
dreams of the past, but things more wonderful than the past could ever dream
of. There is not the slightest doubt that the greatest and most mysterious
discoveries of this century are those that have been made in connection
with man himself as a being. When we consider that magnetism or mes-
merism overcame the scepticism of the old school of physicians, that som-
nambulism was demonstrated beyond contradiction, that clairvoyance and
psycopathy have obtained too powerful a hold on belief to be lightly
laughed away, all within the present century, we may well wonder at the
advance we have made, and since so much has been discovered, ask our-
selves how much more is yet within the reach of our knowledge.
There are two incidents that come to us from the United States of
America, that world of latter-day wonders, which form a fitting prelude
to the strange case we are about to describe. They are both well authen-
ticated ; have been published in the papers there, and are said to be true.
Certainly they seem wonderful, most wonderful, but our readers would do
well to remember that ‘ ‘ There are more things in Heaven and earth than
are dreamt of in their philosophy,” and to bear in mind the motto of the
French philosopher, Arago, “ He who, outside of pure mathematics, pro-
nounces the word impossible , lacks prudence.”
The first case is that of Mollie Faucher, a young woman living in New
York, whose wonderful history has astonished and shocked the savants of
America and of the world. Three years ago she met with an accident,
and since then she has been a living corpse. She cannot. move from her
bed, but she can speak, and reason, and yet she scarcely ever sleeps, and
scarcely ever eats any food. During the whole three years she has not


eaten aa much as an ordinary person would consume in a week, and fre-
quently has remained a month without tasting anything. Medical science
cannot account for the phenomenon, for it sets all its laws at defiance, nor
can any explanation be found of so wonderful a mystery that is yet so true.
The other case has closer reference to the subject of our pamphlet. It is
taken from a New York journal, wherein the editor writes :—“ Eight years
since, when we were engaged as city editor of a Milwaukee paper, there
lived in this State an editor named Powell, now connected with a Chicago
paper, we think. In 1862 Powell was married to a Miss Ellen Burnham, of
Brodhead, Wisconsin, after a courtship of some months. Miss Burnham’s
parents were residents of Brodhead, and of high respectability. The
daughter taught music, had a large number of pupils, and was very attrac-
tive. Powell lived with her as a husband for two years, she being all that
time a good wife in all respects—presenting him but one child. At the
expiration of about two years Mrs. Powell’s voice was changed, she grew
light whiskers, and gradually changed her sex, developing into a man
in all respects. The husband and wife separated when the wife became a
man, and Mrs. Ellen Powell took the name of Edgar Burnham, donned
male attire, sought and obtained employment as a clerk in Chicago, and
lived a single young man for one year. During this time he fell in love
with a niece of Senator Morgan, of New York, but did not marry her, for
reasons not pertinent to this article. But about the end of the year he
did marry a young lady of Brodhead, Wisconsin—a Miss Gerta Everett,
who was a music pupil of his when he was Miss Ellen Burnham, over
three years previous to the marriage. This second marriage was about two
years ago. Soon after this marriage 1 Edgar’ Burnham and wife removed
to Waterloo, lowa, where they now reside, or did not long since. The
former girl is now a man, the former wife is now a husband, the former
mother is now a father, the former young lady teacher of a young lady is
now that young lady’s husband.”
EDWARD DE LACY EVANS.
Without further preface, we come to the history of this woman, who, for
the last twenty-two years, the greater portion of her life, has dressed,
lived, and worked as a man; has been intimately known to hundreds of
persons, and, strangest of all, has had three wives. For a girl of 19, as she
was at the commencement of her impersonation, to don male attire in a
spirit of fun or mischief, would be, though somewhat a strange proceeding,
nothing to excite our wonder; but for the same girl to maintain that dis-
guise as thoroughly and completely as she has done, for over a score of years,
and not only that, but to live and sleep with three different women—one
for two years, another for eight years, and the third for eleven years, seems
so improbable a story that the strictest proofs are required before we can
believe it. And yet the facts are so clearly and circumstantially proved that
there is no reason for doubt.
To begin with the discovery of the imposture perpetrated on Sandhurst
for so many years, we will detail how the man Evans was found to be a
woman.
On the 22nd July, a man named Edward de Lacy Evans was brought
before Messrs. Samuels and Holdsworth, J.P.’s, at the Sandhurst Polioe
Court, on a charge of lunacy. He was examined there by Drs. Cruiok-


shank and J. Boyd, who certified that he was suffering from amentia, or
softening of the brain, and recommended his being sent to the lunacy ward
of the hospital, to be temporarily detained there until he was committed
to Kew. The magistrates made the order accordingly, and Evans was
conveyed to the hospital that day. The first step on the admission of
patients is to give them a bath; and the attendants proceeded to strip
Evans for that purpose- However, he resisted violently, and managed to
escape from the institution, and returned to his residence at Quarry Hill.
Next day he was brought back by his wife and some friends, and confined
in the lunacy ward. He told the doctor that he had a bath at home, and
his wife corroborated the statement, so that, in the face of his repugnance
to the operation, it was not insisted on. He was placed in the charge of a
wardsman named Qundry, who slept in the same room for nearly six weeks.
This wardsman describes the patient as an active, wiry little fellow, about
•sft. 6in. in height, with broad shoulders, and muscular arms, and hands
that bore the evidences of hard work. He was very quiet, except when
the bath was mentioned, and then his exclamation was, “No d fear.”
He was continually smoking, and could chew tobacco in the most approved
style. Over his pipe he told Gundry that he had been mining for twenty-
two years, that he had a wife and one child, and that Ms wife was a sister-
in-law of , a miller and mining speculator of Sandhurst. He also
Stated that his parents were Irish, but that he was bom in France. Gundry
addressed some French phrases to him, but he replied that it was so long
since he left France that he had forgotten the language. During Evans’s
stay in the hospital, Gundry noticed several peculiarities about him. He
would never undress or wash himself before the wardsman, but Gundry
had no suspicions in consequence, and only “ thought the man rather
bashful.” It has to be considered that a man confined as a lunatio might
naturally be supposed to have some eccentricities, but the probabilities of
his being a woman were so very distant that the wardsman can be well
excused for not imagining so extraordinary a circumstance. Some evil-
minded individuals circulated a report that Gundry knew very well the dis-
guise of his patient, but the wardsman strenuously denies the soft impeach -
ment, and his very moral character backs up his assertion. Moreover, to
show the impossibility of any such thing as these gossips imagine, two
wardsmen had charge of the patient, and watched in turns; so, unless it is
imagined that they were in collusion, the slander is refuted, and the wards-
man triumphantly acquitted.
It might be suggested that a medical examination would have exposed
the deception. Doubtless it would, but there are two good reasons why
none was made. The medical certificates on which he was committed
stated that he was suffering from softening of the brain. No bodily disease
was suggested, and the patient had all the appearances of being quite
healthy, so that, in the first place, the examination was not necessary. Then
it was known that his detention in the hospital was only temporary; so
that, in the second case, it was only superfluous. No one can impute any
blame to Dr. Poland in the matter, for his care and attention to patients are
too well known to admit of a suggestion of neglect.
But if a crowning proof is required that there was no cause for suspicion,
it is found in the circumstance that the patient was visited nearly a dozen
times by his wife and child , in company with her relatives. One of them
addressed Evans as “ Uncle,” and the child that his wife had brought with
her called him “Dadda.” Though the presence of a “wife” might not


always satisfy some sceptical individuals that she was married, the child
should be, at least, good circumstantial evidence that the “ husband” was
a man.
At any rate, the hospital officials were satisfied, and when, on the 30th
August, Messrs. Bayne and Strickland, official visiting justices, inspected
the ward, and ordered Evans to be sent to Kew, they had no scruple in
sending with him the following statement concerning Edward de Lacy
Evans: —“Male ; 37 years of age; married; native of Kilkenny, Ireland;
miner ; Protestant; living at Quarry Hill; temperate ; first attack, about
a week in duration; cause not known; not subject to epilepsy; not
suicidal; dangerous to others; suffering from amentia; quiet while in
custody of police.”
On the following Monday, Ist September, Evans was taken to Mel-
bourne in company with another patient, bound for the same destination.
His wife was at the Sandhurst Station to see him depart, and he took a
most affectionate leave of her, entreating her to be careful of the child. As
the train left, both husband and wife were weeping copiously.
Evans was very peaceable during the journey, and conversed freely with
the constable in charge. When he reached Kew he remained quiet until
the attendants came to prepare him for the bath, customary on admission.
Then he resisted forcibly. On this occasion, however, resistance did not
avail, as custom had made it in them “ a property of easiness,” and the
attendants knew how to deal with resisting patients. He was prepared for
the bath, and then—the secret so well kept for two-and-twenty years was
a secret no longer.
The authorities had no power to detain the woman on the masculine
commitment contained in the document that accompanied the patient
Evans, and on the 3rd September she was sent back to Sandhurst.
Her appearance on returning was greatly altered, so much so indeed that
her room companion, previous to her metamorphosis, could scarcely
believe, as he put it, “that the woman was the same man.” After so long
an absence she had again returned to petticoats, and the change did not
appear congenial to her taste. Her face is long and thin, and the features
are of a very accommodating nature. They would do well for either a
man or woman. Her face is totally devoid of hair; her cheeks sunken and
pale, and her brow and face covered with wrinkles. Her nose is aquiline,
her eyes grey and piercing, and her mouth sensual. Her hair is brown,
with a light sprinkling of grey, very wavy, and rather long for a man.
Her wrists are white and very small, forming a great contrast to her large
and thick-jointed hands, covered with excrescences generally consequent
on the hard work of miners. Her bosom is perfectly flat, the breasts
resembling those of a man; this, of would be the result of so many
years’ hard work in an occupation uncongenial to her sex. On her arrival she
desired to be put to bed, and there she has since remained. She appeared
feverish and stated that she was ill. She also said that the “ examination”
at Kew had “ injured” her. What she meant to convey is not known.
Next day, when the particulars of this strange case were published in
The Bendigo Independent and other papers, the city was thrown into a state
of great excitement. People could not believe that for so long they had
entertained an angel, i.e., woman, unawares, and a general suspicion of
each other was engendered. Anyone who had a married friend that
was not blessed with encumbrances, regarded him with a doubting
scrutiny, and the genders of the pronouns used became so mixed that


they were almost being abolished altogether. Naturally, attention was
•directed to the wife of this amphi-sex individual, and, leaving the patient
for a while well cared for at the hospital, we will come to
THE WIFE.
“Mrs. Edward John de Lacy Evans” is a lady-like woman about five
feet five inches in height, very dark complexion, with dark brown eyes, and
jet black hair. She has suffered for a long time from hip disease, which
causes her to limp. She is a native of Jersey, her parents also being
French, and is 36 years of age. She would appear to be of a very lethargic
temperament, speaks with a drawl and in a simple manner, which, if not
affected, shows the woman to possess a somewhat child-like demeanour.
Her maiden name was Julia Marquand, and she has two sisters; one
married, living in Sandhurst, and the other married also to a gentleman,
formerly of Sandhurst, but now living in England. About twelve years
ago she was engaged as a dressmaker at Messrs. Francis Bros.’ Beehive
Stores, Pall Mall, and became acquainted with a Miss Helen Moore, who
was also engaged there. Miss Moore resided at Eaglehawk with her
sister, who was married to Edward de Lacy Evans, and introduced Miss
Marquand to the family. In August, 1867, Evans’s wife died, and he soon
afterwards commenced to keep company with Miss Marquand. Evidently
he was an adept in the art of making love, for his courtship extended for
twelve months, and was brought to a successful issue. He proposed, was
accepted, and preparations were made for their marriage. At his request,
she consented that the ceremony should be performed at Ballarat, and
they proceeded there for that purpose. They were married on the 18th
September, 1868, at the Presbyterian Church, Ballarat, by the Kev. W.
Henderson. The marriage certificate describes the bridegroom as a native
of Paris, 28 years of age, and a widower. After the wedding, he took
her to an hotel, and provided her with apartments, whilst he stayed at
Sweeney’s slaughter-yards, where he had obtained work. In a fortnight’s
time he took two rooms in a private house, and they lived together for another
fortnight as man and wife. He then left her at Sandhurst, and went to
Stawell, where he was engaged driving a horse and dray, and, in order to
maintain herself. Mrs. Evans accepted a situation as machinist in a
draper’s shop in Bridge-street, which she retained for eighteen months.
One evening, in returning to her lodgings, she was insulted by a man
in Bridge-street. She wrote to Evans, begging him to come to her. He
accordingly came down from Stawell, but did not offer to take her back
with him, and, after staying a few days, he returned to Stawell. Shortly
afterwards she followed him, but he did not offer to provide for her, and
wanted her to go back to her place at Ballarat. This she resolutely
refused to do, and then took a house, and they lived about two years in
Stawell, when he left and went to Sandhurst. She remained about three
months there, maintaining herself by sewing for Messrs. Allingham, the
drapers, when, being very miserable, she wrote to her friends at Sand-
hurst, gave up her situation, and came to them, concluding that, as he did
not pay her any attention, ho had only married her for her to keep
him, which she would not do. At this time he had obtained work as a
miner, and they went to live together at View Grove Cottage, Quarry Hill.
Soon afterwards, as he was away at night, for the sake of the company,
they removed to her sister’s house, where they lived for two years. On her


leaving for England, Evans built the house his wife now resides in, Jersey
Cottage, off Eussell-street, Quarry Hill, where they have lived for four
years. During the whole of this time he followed the occupation of a
miner, and was working at the Great Southern Company and the Sea
Company, and between four and five years ago he met with an accident
at the latter company’s mine, owing to a fall of earth. The first indica-
tions she noticed of Mm not being right in his head were in February last,
when he became very strange in his behaviour; this was after he had
been laid up for two months with fever, and she attributed it to that. Ho
continued to be strange in his ways, was very exacting in his requirements,
and if everything was not ready for him, and done to his liking, he would
“blow up fearful.” In July he became much worse, and used to use
his wife and child so roughly that Mrs. Evans became alarmed, and
consulted Dr. J. Boyd, who had always been in the habit of attending the
family, as to what she should do. He recommended his being arrested
for lunacy. On the 18th July, when he went to work at the Great
Southern mine, the manager noticed something wrong about him and sent
him home. On the following Monday (the 21st), he was taken in charge
by Constable Bradley, and brought before the Police Court next day. Ilia
subsequent adventures have been already described.
His wife stated that she used to visit him in the hospital three times a
week. He always cried very bitterly when he saw her there, and seemed
to have a heavy load on his mind, as he continually muttered that “if he
got out of that he would make it hot for somebody.”
But the great difficulty, as far as the wife is concerned, still remains.
She has a daughter fifteen months old. People were convinced of the
impersonation; with great difficulty they managed to believe that the two
women had lived together as a man and wife for eleven years ; that the
wife did not discover the deception was a great stumbling-block, but the
child was a complete barrier to their understanding. It was thought that
the wife herself would throw some light on the matter, but she only made
the mystery more mystifying. Nor can the paucity of information
obtained from her be ascribed to any lack of desire on the part of the public
to be enlightened, but must be admitted as due to the extreme delicacy of
the subject. The question asked by everyone was, why she lived as wife
to another woman for eleven years. Her statement is, that she believed all
the time that Evans was a man, and the chief peculiarity about him (apart
from that which it is reserved for medical science to explain), was that ho
would never allow her to see him undressing, or washing himself. Even
more anxiously was information sought regarding the child. At first, she
stated that she thought that Evans was its father, but afterwards admitted that
her opinion on that matter had changed. Her explanation of the mystery was
not so ingenious as Danae gave, or even as that of more modem Oontrarini,
but it was, that one night, when she expected her husband to return from
work, some other man came in his place, and she did not find out the mis-
take till he was gone. Such is her story.
A few more particulars are given by Mrs. Evans, which, as they serve
to corroborate the statements of other persons acquainted with the impostor,
may as well be given here. She says that when her husband was ill, four
years ago, in consequence of an accident at the mine that injured his head,
and also when he was laid up for two months with a fever a short time
previous to his lunacy, he was attended by Dr. Boyd, who, strange to say,
did not discover the sexual imposition that had been practised. She also*


states that her husband frequently used to tell her he was a nephew of
General de Lacy Evans, of Spanish revolution and Crimean repute, and
actually got her to direct letters to the general.
Having now described this extraordinary couple, as far as concerns their
relation with each other, it is necessary to leave the history of the wife,
strange though it doubtless is, for the far more wonderful career of the
man-woman, whose dupe she, to a great extent, has clearly been.
ELLEN TREMAYE
Is, without doubt, the real name of the patient, or, at least, the name under
which she came to the colony. Although she has not herself admitted it,
it is clear, from the admission she has made, and from her identification
with the emigrant girl both now and long ago, by persons who recognised
her in her male attire, that she is no other. It would be asked, and very
naturally, why anyone who saw her in male garb did not disclose her
imposition, but the reason given is that it was generally believed on the
vessel that the girl was really a man, and her subsequent appearance as
such was only considered a return to the proper sex.
The first recognition was that by Mrs. Holt, a nurse at the hospital, in
whose charge the patient was placed on her return from Kew. Mrs. Holt
states that she knew the patient the moment she saw her. From her story,
and that of other passengers, it appears that the Ocean Monarch left
Plymouth for Australia, and arrived in Hobson’s Bay on the 22nd June,
1857. Among the passengers was this girl, Ellen Tremaye, who attracted
the attention of everyone on board. She was young, good looking, and of
a lively nature and amiable disposition. She was evidently of good educa-
tion, could sing well, and often amused and interested her companions.
Not only was she interesting, but there were several peculiarities about
her that excited general wonder. In the first place, she had, in addition
to her own luggage, a trunk labelled ‘ ‘ Edward de Lacy Evans, ’ and
bearing the notice—“ Not wanted during the voyage.” It was brought
on to the vessel with her luggage, and taken away with it when they
reached Melbourne, and none of the passengers knew anything about its
contents. The second peculiarity was, that she used to tell the other girls
she was a man, and always wore a man's shirt and drawers underneath a
woman’s dress and petticoats. The girls used to sleep in couples, and
Tremaye’s bed-fellow was a girl named Bose Kelly. During the voyage
this girl took ill, and at Bio Janeiro she died. Concerning her second
bed-fellow, and the one who continued so to the end of the voyage, there
are different statements, and each, in some way, corroborates the others.
Mrs. Holt states that the girl’s name was Mary Montague, and that,
when the vessel reached Port Phillip, she remained in Melbourne, and
Ellen Tremaye went up the country. Mrs. Holt also says that a few
months afterwards she heard that Ellen came down again, and, under the
name of Edward de Lacy Evans, married her bed-fellow, Mary Montague,
who was
THE FIRST WIFE.
Mrs. Holt was not greatly surprised at the intelligence, for she believed
all along that Tremaye was not a girl. She says that when the Ocean


Monarch reached the quarantine ground in Sorrento, or, as it was then
called, Port Phillip, the girl Ellen Tremaye used to tell the other girls in
the vessel that she was a man, and would chase them in the bush, and pull
them about. At last, they became afraid of her, and believed that she
really was a man.
The married pair went up the country, and the next thing Mrs. Holt
heard was that some time previous to her own marriage, on 17th May,
1859, Mary Montague, or Mary Evans, as was her married name, died,
and was buried in the then new cemetery, North Melbourne.
The statement made by a Mrs. Thompson, living at Eaglehawk, is
entirely different, but she is equally positive of its correctness. She agrees
as to the death of the first girl, but says that the name of the second was
Mary Delahunty, an orphan possessed of £9OO, whose family were religious,
and intended to send her to a convent, but who through some freak
decided to emigrate to Australia. Mrs. Thompson stated that Ellen
Tremaye used to say that she would marry Mary Ann Delahunty when
she reached Melbourne, and that she was a man in disguise. That after
their arrival the two were married, and Mrs. Thompson heard nothing of.
them for many years afterwards. One day she accidentally met Ellen
Tremaye, who was dressed as a man, and married under the name of De
Lacy Evans. They recognised each other, and Mrs. Thompson inquired
what had become of Miss Delahunty. Evans replied, “ Oh, my dear lady,
wife and boy died of consumption, and were buried in Melbourne.” On
being asked what had become of her money, Evans stated that she sent it
home to a convent.
Yet a third story is told concerning this first wife. A miner living in
Sandhurst was intimately acquainted with Evans in 1858 at Simmonds’
Beef, Mount Blackwood, where he was employed by Guppy to cart quartz,
lie was married, but his wife was not living at Blackwood, but at Bacchus
Marsh.
Mr. E further says:—“l had not been long at Blackwood when
Evans’s wife came up there, and they lived together. She was a little
woman, fair complexioued, and looked much older than Evans, whom
I would have taken, by his ruddy, smooth face to be a lad of 18. She
kept a school at Simmonds’, and people used to call her Evans’s mother;
she seemed too old altogether for ‘ his’ wife. I used to know Evans
very well during the year I lived there, and until I left in 1858. In
fact, we were regular chums, and he would do anything for me. I
took a liking to him, too, for he was not a bad little fellow, and I being
quite a young chap then, we used to knock about together, especially on
Sundays, He has often accompanied us when we went to bathe, but
would never go in himself. I could not make out his smooth face, without
any hair on it, and I used to tell him I believed he was a girl. ‘ He’
would laugh at it until I caught hold of him, and then he would get into a
passion. I often used to tease him, and call him “Polly,” and many a
time he has chased mo with a knife. I believed he would have used it, too,
when he was in a temper. He was generally very close as regards keeping
his own counsel, but he used to tell me that his father was a magistrate,
and that his uncle was General De Lacy Evans. He always persisted in
saying this, and said he expected to have a fortune left him some day. He
swore he was a Frenchman, but none of us believed him, for he had a
regular Irish accent. He used to show me letters to prove his statements
about his father and uncle. They were signed De Lacy Evans, but, of


course, I don’t know if they were genuine; he might have written them
himself. When I left Mount Blackwood, Evans and his wife were living
there. I saw no more of him till five years afterwards, in 1863, when I
was working at the Great Eastern Reef, Axe Creek. One night I was at
Simpson’s Hotel, when a man came there with a cart of vegetables to sell.
lat once recognised him as Evans. I spoke to him. Of course he knew
me, and we had a long talk over old times and the people of Blackwood.
He said he was working for a farmer named Brennan, at Emu Creek, and
his wife and he lived together there. He stayed at the hotel all the evening,
and for the only time while I knew him he got drunk, and had to be taken
home. A few days afterwards he brought his wife in to introduce her to
me, but judge my surprise when, instead of the delicate little woman whom
I knew at Blackwood, I saw a big Irish girt, head and shoulders over him.
I expressed my surprise, and he then told me that his wife was dead. That
satisfied my wonder, and I thought no more about the matter.
“ I left them at Axe Creek, and in 1866 returned to Blackwood for a few
mouths. On inquiring from some relatives of mine there, I found that
Evans’s first wife was not dead, as he had stated, but living at Blackwood.
My relatives told an exciting history about them. That Evans and
the girl Montague came out together as immigrants, and went up as ser-
vant girls to a farmer’s house at Bacchus Marsh. That one night the
farmer went away from home for a few nights, and while he was away, his
wife desired one of the girls to sleep with her for company. Evans was the
one chosen. What passed is not told, but next day the wife sent for her
husband, and when he came home he gave Evans a horsewhipping. Both
the girls left and went to Melbourne, where Evans dressed as a man and
married the other. He went up to Mount Blackwood, and she to Bacchus
Marsh, and afterwards joined him as’l have stated. They told me that
after I left, Evans and lie wife did not seem to agree well, and at last she
left him. There was a great scandal in Blackwood, for it is a little place,
and everyone knows everyone else’s business, but the wife excused herself
by saying that Evans was not a woman’s man, that he was a woman in
fact. Evans got into a great rage, and threatened to kill his wife. He
offered to go to a doctor, and have it proved that he was a man, and
actually went to the next township for medical examination. Whether he
went to the doctor was not known, but he said he did, and soon afterwards
went away. This was the story told me by my relatives, and I have no
doubt that it is perfectly correct. When I left Mount Blackwood Mrs.
Evans was living there, and I believe she was afterwards married, and
resides in the same place yet.”
Erom these accounts it will be seen that Evans’s first wife is not a subject
on which history can be positive. It appears that Evans admitted to Mrs.
Thompson having married Miss Delahunty, and stated that she was buried in
Melbourne. Mrs. Holt is positive that he married Mary Montague, and
believed that she was buried in Melbourne. There is other evidence that his
wife at Blackwood was alive a few years ago, and is believed to be still
living. The position consequently is perplexing. It is quite possible
that it was Miss Delahunty, and not Miss Montague that died in Melbourne,
for the difference between Mary Ann Evans and Mary Evans is very slight,
but still there are two girls to be accounted for, for Mrs. Holt knew them
both on the vessel, and there is no possibility, as might be imagined, that it
was the one girl with two surnames. What the maiden name of the
wife at Mountßlackwood was, is not at present known, or else the difficulty


would be partially overcome, but the only conclusion is that Evans must
have married both girls. One died in 1858, and his marriage with the wife
previous to the present one did not take place till 1862. There is no doubt
that he must have had another wife in the meantime.
At any rate, if there is a difficulty about the matter—and the culprit has
sufficient offences clearly proved—it would not be fair to saddle him (or her)
with a fourth marriage, unless the evidence of it is clear beyond a doubt,
and the number of wives must therefore be considered as three.
THE SECOND WIFE
was Sarah Moore, a tall, buxom, dark-complexioned Irish girl, fully 6ft.
9in. in height, and about twenty-four years old when Evans married her
in 1862. She was bom in the county Down, but her parents were Scotch.
She was a strong and willing worker, and appears to have given great
satisfaction at the various places where she was employed as general
servant. She first became acquainted with Evans when she was a servant
at Punch’s Hotel, Golden-square, and he was cutting and carting wood in
the vicinity. They were married at the Hibernia Hotel, and Evans took
a room there, and stayed with his wife for a few weeks. She afterwards
was engaged as cook at the London and Dublin Hotel, and he lodged there.
On one occasion, it is said, the landlord found him in one of the servants’
bedrooms. He was charged at the police court with this offence, and
received a sentence of seven days’ imprisonment.
While at Golden-square, Evans distinguished himself in a manner that
caused him to be remembered rather more acutely than fondly. When he
first went there, in 1862, a Mrs. M*Evoy (since murdered atMyers’ Flat) re-
cognised him as Ellen Tremaye. She called him “ Nellie,” and he seemed
surprised, and said he did not like that name. A Mrs. Hill, now living at
Golden-square, was present at the time, and remembers Evans’s career very
well. She designates him as an “ arrant swindler.” It appears that Mrs.
Hill placed £175 in the Bank of New South Wales in the name of an
Italian, Joseph Dorrizzi, with whom Evans had been living and working,
leaving the receipt with Messrs. Harris and Boyd, gold brokers, of View
Point. Evans knew that Dorrizzi, better known as “Joseph,” had the
money, and was occasionally tormenting him to lend it to him. On one
occasion he worked upon “ Joseph,” and got him to draw out the money
and give it to him, as he wished to buy a hor**e at Corni«h and Bruce’s
sale, in Golden-square. Evans got the receipt from Messrs. Harris and
Boyd, and obtained the money. He then attended the sale, and bought a
fine black mare for £64 with the Italian’s money. He also purchased a
dray for £l9, and a new suit of clothes, with high top boots. Evans
returned to the Italian’s, and ploughed a paddock for Mr. Hill with the horse-
he had bought. It was said by the neighbours that “ifhe is a woman, he’s
a fine ploughman,” the ground being ploughed in really excellent style.
When at work wi f h Dorrizzi he premised to give him a gold watch and
chain which his uncle in France was going to send out, and he also promised
several things to the neighbours. Almost every second day he would
tell Dorrizzi that he had received another letter from France, stating that his
father was getting plenty of money, and was going to send it out to him.
He stated that his father was a Frenchman, and his mother Irish. After a
few weeks’ work, splitting and carting wood to Allingham and Moore’s
crushing machine at Golden-square, he sold the horse and dray to a Mrs.


Stark for £42. Some time afterwards Dorrizzi went home, and when he-
returned he one day met Evans at Eaglehawk, and asked him for the
£175. Evans replied when he got some gold he would settle with him.
“Joseph” soon after sued him in the Sandhurst County Court, and got a
verdict against him. Evans returned with the Italian, and said he would
split some wood to the amount of £l5O, and settle the account. Ho got
the tools and split about ten tons, and again cleared out. “ Joseph,” who
now resides at Golden-square, has never heard of him since, until he was
informed that his lively friend had been discovered in the manner now so
well known. Previous to leaving, Evans told Mr. Hill that he would show
him papers which would prove that be was De Lacy Evans, and was a
relative of General De Lacy Evans. Mrs. Hill states that whilst in the
house Evans was full of fun, and was good company. Not the slightest
suspicion was entertained by them as to Evans being a woman, his only
peculiarity being an effeminate voice.
After leaving Golden-square, Evans and his wife went to live down
M'Crae-street, and early in 1863 they were both engaged by Mr. M.
Brennan, for his farm, at Emu Creek. Mr. Brennan, in speaking of them,
says :—I fell in with the person known as Edward de Lacy Evans under-
the following circumstances: In the end of January, 1863, I inserted in a
Sandhurst paper a notice to the following effect—“ Wanted a married
couple; man to plough, wife as general house servant. None but a first-
class ploughman need apply; 10 o’clock sharp, Labour Office, Bull-street.”
At the hour and place named, I was confronted with a tall, decently-clad,
young Irish woman. I would not call her handsome, but she was
decidedly prepossessing. In reply to my questions, she said that she could
bake, wash, iron, milk, make butter and cheese, &0., and, in fact, was a
thorough general servant, and, in truth, to do her justice, she was as good
as her word. I was much pleased with her appearance. But what about
her husband. "Well, he was then engaged,she said, at a puddling machine
in M'Crae-street, was a first-class ploughman, and had taken first honours
at Bacchus Marsh. Certificates would be produced, as also the local paper,,
containing an account of the great contest. Religion, Protestant; nation-
ality, French. The religion to me, I said, was a matter of indifference,
but the country didn’t suit, as my horses bad not been educated in the
French language. “Oh,” she replied, “ but my husband speaks English
well; in fact, is a good English scholar.” The bargain was therefore-
made, subject to the husband passing muster. So we started down M'Crae-
street in pursuit of that gentleman. “There he is,” said my companion,
pointing to one of a group of men who were hard at work washing off a
“ mill of stuff.” We entered a cottage, and in a few minutes the husband
came in also. On entering the door of the cottage, he seemed quite
abashed, but soon rallied, as his wife'said, “Edward, Mr. Brennan; Mr.
De Lacy, my husband.” He made a rush at me, shook me as warmly by
the hand as if I had been an old acquaintance; turned round, seized a
billy, ran out, and in a couple of minutes was back with a billy full of ale.
Under the new influence we ratified our bargain, and on my expressing
a wish to see the testimonials—for my faith in Edward’s abilities was
much shaken by his appearance —the “wife” went to rummage a box
for it. But things had been so much tossed about that it could not be
found. However, it would be forthcoming on the morrow, when I came-
to take them away. I did come on the morrow. Edward and the wife
were quite spruce, and I was much pleased with my bargain, particularly-


as there was a great cry out for the “ domestic servant” at heme. I
advanced them £l to get some things, and we became quite chummy. The
“wife” was from the next county to myself, and “Edward’s” French
accent - soon degenerated into an Irish brogue. On reaching home, I con-
signed “Sarah” to the care of my wife, who was glad to get her, while
“ Edward’’ took up his position among the male hands, and soon showed
his ability by the easy manner in which he criticised everything, from a
hen to a horse. Up to this time I have taken credit to myself that I was
a versatile man on the farm, and used to “ blow” that I was the only man
I knew who could dam a stocking, bake a damper, or write a letter to the
Governor, with all the intermediate stages, but “Edward” soon took me
down a “ peg.” If doing a piece of smithwork, “ Edward” would show
me the exact heat to put on the iron, and the exact chemicals to use
before it wotild weld. Were I cutting up a pig, the sweep of the hams
would be pointed out to me with an easy confidence. His manner of
putting up and salting a dead pig was only surpassed by the skilful style
in which he would operate on a living one. About this time the first
ploughing match ever held in the Bendigo district was being got up.
“ Edward” made me put a pair of horses into training for that event, as he
was sure to carry off first prize on the strength of his Bacchus Marsh
victory. On the morning of the contest I discovered, to my chagrin, that
my champion ploughman was indisposed, and was not able to go. I can
picture his pale face, looking out from beneath the blankets with a
resigned look, as he reached me his hand, and expressed his sorrow at my
disappointment. But he and I went as visitors, and he was no time out
when he got better, and the manner in which he criticised the work done,
and the regrets expressed at not being a competitor, and, to use his own
words, to “ carry all before him,” are as fresh in my mind to-day as the day
on which the circumstance occurred. Nor can I forget the hearty manner
in which he cheered, and the pathetic manner in which he clapped his
hands while I was making my speech at the luncheon. His wife and
he slept in a detached hut adjoining the stable, of which they had the
exclusive use, as it had been fitted up for their accommodation. Evans repre-
sented himself to be Edward de Lacy Evans, nephew to the military hero
of that name, and son to a gentleman of the same name who lived near Kil-
kenny, Ireland ; that he had been bom in France, removed to Ireland when
young, stole £BOO from his father while at home on vacation, and left for
Australia; that he married a shipmate soon after his arrival in the colony ;
that the wife died in childbirth at Tarrangower (Maldon), after he had
lost all his money in mining speculations ; that his furniture, including a
piano, was still at Tarrangower, but that he came over to Bendigo, saw,
and married his then wife, Sarah Moore. This story he stuck to without
the slightest variation, during the sixteen years that I knew him. He was
for taking Sarah Moore back to Ireland, where he was sure he would be
welcomed as the returned prodigal, and raise her to fame and fortune. If
his wife went out for a piece of firewood, he would chide her for exposing
herself to the sun, as she would not be fit to be introduced to his sisters at
home ; if she went too near the fire it was the same. The question arises, was
Sarah Moore a party to the whole fraud—a fraud that has no parallel in his-
tory, a fraud before which the Tichbome case sinks into utter insignificance.
I am thoroughly convinced that so long, at least, as Sarah Moore lived at
our place, and for at least a year after, she knew nothing about, nor did she
•even suspect, the deception that was being played on her. I could adduce


a hundred proofs in support of this—one will, be sufficient. On one
occasion, when De Lacy was going into Bendigo on business for me, he
got £2 to spend on behalf of himself and wife. When he came home in the
evening he had neither the money nor the goods, and was taken severely to
task on the matter. He produced, instead, quite an armful of Irish news-
papers, which he said had arrived that day by the mail, and the letters
with remittances were, as a matter of course, to follow at once. Mrs. de
Lacy became at once mollified, and, to show her good nature, ran in with
three or four of the papers to me, amongst which was a copy of the
Illustrated London News, with the wrapper unbroken. On taking up the
paper, I saw the first line of the address was in an unknown female hand,
and was written, “Mr. Edward de Lacy Evans,” underneath which was
written, in a hand which I knew well, “Sandhurst, Victoria.” I made
some remarks on the peculiar writing of the latter portion, when Mrs. de
Lacy, who had not left the room, remarked that I could have never seen
the handwriting before, as it was from “Edward’s father, in Ireland.”'
I contradicted her, by asserting that the writing was that of John Neil
M‘Kartney, the then agent for the Argus, and pointed out that there were
no post-marks on the paper. Mrs. de Lacy seemed to pause for a while,
and then burst into a flood of tears and passion, ( and said her husband must
be a schemer. There were several other scenes* which convinces me that
Mrs. de Lacy never knew that her husband was a female. Perhaps the
most extraordinary, or one of the most extraordinary, parts of the whole
affair is the power of physical endurance possessed by De Lacy. In looking
over my diary of the time (I have kept a diary of all my transactions), I find
“ Edward” engaged as ploughman, haymower, potato-digger, tree-grubber,
and hay carter; and he had invariably, after his ten hours’ ploughing, to
turn a chaff-cutter, a job which I have more than once seen a stout navvy
refuse; and, on one occasion, I knew him to cut a quantity of chaff, and
feed the chaff-cutter himself; this he did voluntarily. On one occasion, De
Lacy, and his wife and I, met at an hotel, kept in Sandhurst by a mutual
friend. Mrs. de Lacy first shook my hand, then Edward shook it, each
declaring I was the best employer that they ever had. Then one fell on my
neck and kissed me ; then the other did the same, and I never—in Victoria,
at any rate—was so nearly smothered with kisses. De Lacy and his wife
left early in August (1863), and went to the Great Eastern Hotel, as they
said, to better their circumstances. Here I was well acquainted with them
for over a year. They then went to Eaglohawk.
In addition to the interesting information contained in the foregoing
excellently written sketch contributed to The Bendigo Independent, it is
stated that while at Mr. Brennan’s house Evans cut a neighbour’s hair,
and did it so well that he was complimented, which led his wife to remark
that he always cut his own hair. Of course this was done to prevent
identification. After leaving Mr. Brennan’s, Evans went out to work at
Axe Creek, as a miner at the Great Eastern mine, the late Mr. Henry
Hattam being manager, and Sarah Moore went to service at the Great
Eastern Hotel, in the immediate neighbourhood. A few months after, Evans
built a hut, and he and his wife lived together. Evans used to tell her
that his former wife had been very much kinder to him than she was. This
naturally annoyed her very much, and on one occasion she struck him on
the. breast, which caused him to fall in a fainting fit. When Evans
recovered he said, “You wretch, you knew my weak place.” She used to
complain to a neighbour that Evans had deceived her, and this, taken with


what Evans said about the “weak place,” would lead to the supposition
that she had found out Evans was a woman While at the Great Eastern
mine, she used to drink heavily, and whilst she was in that state, Evans
generally thrashed her. When Evans went away from Mr. Brennan’s
house he left behind him a hook, the title page showing it to be “ A Manual
■of Conversation in six languages: English, German, French, Italian,
Spanish, and Russian.” The imprint was “Leipsio, 1848.” The book
had evidently been sent direct from the German publishers, for on the
•cover is a portion of an eld foreign stamp. On the fly-page are the
initials, “E. J. De L.”
While Evans and his wife were staying at the Great Eastern Hotel at
Axe Creek, Mr. R , previously mentioned, was intimately acquainted with
them. He says that the wife was very much afraid of her husband, and
used to tremble when he was angry. Mr. It had many conversations
with her, and his opinion is that she was perfectly cognisant of the deceit
at the time he knew her, but did not expose Evans, because she believed
his story of expected wealth from his rich relations. She used to say that
some day Edward would have his fortune, and then they would be com-
fortable
In 1864, Evans and his wife removed to Eaglehawk, where they lived at
a house in Victoria-street, Evans working as a miner. During his residence
here he got into financial difficulties, and became insolvent. One day
during the year 1867 he met Mr. E , who had also come to Sandhurst,
in the Mall. They recognised each other, and Evans said, “ Halloa, you’re
the I’ve been looking for; I’m boss of a claim at Eaglehawk, and you
know I don’t know anything about it. Come out and work for me.” The
other would not consent, however, as he felt certain that Evans’s temper
would prevent them from agreeing.
In the month of August, 1867, this wife died. It is stated that at the
time Evans was in so impoverished circumstances that his wife’s body had
to remain three or four days in the house until he could procure the money
to bury her. She was buried, according to the certificate, on the 31st
August, 1867, in the Eaglehawk cemetery. It has been stated that she
died in childbirth, but this is incorrect. She had a sister, Helen Moore,
who subsequently married a resident of Sandhurst. The sister died in
■childbirth, and this must be how the mistake arose. This sister, Helen,
lived with Mr. and Mrs. Evans at Eaglehawk, and was engaged as a
dressmaker at Messrs. Francis Bros.’ Beehive Store. She then became
acquainted with a Miss Julia Marquand, engaged at the same establishment,
whom she introduced to her sister and brother-in-law. When Sarah Moore
died, Evans kept company with, and subsequently married, Miss Marquand,
who thus became
THE THIRD WIFE.
It is very clear that Evans did not “ persevere in obstinate condolement”
for his dead wife very long. Very soon afterwards he attempted to pay
his addresses to her sister, but she declined the hasty, and, moreover,
illegal alliance. Nothing daunted, he courted her friend, and she
proved less unkind, for on the 18th September following (1868) they
were married at Ballarat. The history of the married life of this last
victim has been previously sketched. There are only a few incidents in
•connection with it gathered from various sources that may be detailed.


While the wife was living at Stawell, Evans at that time being in Sand-
hurst, an affaire is said to have occurred. It appears that a man, who lived
next door to her house, was in the habit of chopping wood for her during
the absence of her husband. One night this man returned home drunk,
and mistook Mrs. Evans’s house for his own. Whether he considered the
services he was in the habit of rendering an excuse for his error is another
■consideration. The mistake was not found out till next morning, and then
Mrs. Evans created a disturbance. The matter was settled, so the story
goes, by the intruder paying £5 for the night’s rent of the room, and the
wife left Stawell and came to her husband in Sandhurst. This occurrence
took place about three years after her marriage. About two years and a
half, subsequently, Mr. E again met Evans in Sandhurst. The
latter asked him to come and see his wife, informing him that Sarah Moore
was dead, and that he was married again.
Mr. R——says:—“We went up High-street, and into a little shop
past the City Family Hotel, where his wife had a dressmakers’ shop, and
some girls assisting her. There was a child there about fifteen months old,
just able to walk about. I asked him to whom it belonged, and he said,
“ Oh! it’s ours.” His wife laughed lightly, but did not make any remark,
and after a little conversation Evans and I went away. We had a drink
together, and were talking for over an hour. He told me he was out of
employment at the time. I asked him about the child I had seen, and he
said, “Oh! my wife had that child before I married her.” I did not ask
how long he had been married, but if it was in 1868, as is said, the state-
ment made by Evans must be untrue. Perhaps the child has died since,
but I know that I saw one in the shop, and that the wife did not disclaim
it when Evans said, “ It’s ours.” Whether the Stawell incident accounts
in any way for this mystery, of course I cannot presume to say. During my
conversation with Evans on that occasion, I said:—“ You’re a nice fellow.
You told me your first wife had died. Now I was at Blackwood since
and she was living. He appeared greatly astonished, and said, “Well, you
won’t tell anyone about it, old man, will you P” I said, “ No, lad, I won’t.
Let bygones be bygones,” and we parted. After that he always shunned
me, and we never spoke again.
A woman who lives near the Great Southern mine, at which Evans
has worked during the last three years, states that she knew him well.
He used to tell her that it took all his earnings to support himself
and wife, as he required the very best of nourishment to keep him up
to his work. This woman became very well acquainted with both Evans
and his wife. She used to often interchange visits, and used even to
allow her daughters to go up to Mrs. Evans’s house and keep her company
when Evans was engaged at the mine at night. The wife used always
to appear in fear of him, and he used to “ domineer over her in fine style.”
The wife used to fetch him refreshments at the mine, and when he was
at home used to go for his beer; in fact, “she was a foolish kind of
thing, and used to do just as he told her.” He used to enjoy his glass
of ale with the men, in fact "enjoyed a good many glasses of ale, and
also used to indulge in the colonial luxury of swearing pretty freely. It
was a very noticeable fact that when Evans was transferred from the lower
to the upper shaft, where the workings were very wet, that he would not
change his clothes on coming to the surface as the other miners did, but
would go home in his wet clothes. This was much wondered at, and when
he was asked about it, ho would reply that it was not worth while changing,


as he lived so close to the claim. Through ■working iij the wet shaft,
he suffered in one of his legs, and used in consequence to walk partially
lame. He used when at his work to wear big, rough, loose-fitting clothes,
but, at other times would be “got up immense,” and appeared to take
great pride in dressing stylishly.
Evans’s last return to Sandhurst was in 1872, when he obtained employ-
ment in the New Chum Extended mine. He afterwards worked at the
Cosmopolitan and North Sea Tribute, and since October, 1876, was
engaged at the Great Southern mine. During the time he worked at the
North Sea Tribute he boarded at the Hibernia Hotel, Golden-square, and
was a lively member of the family. This was during one of the periods at
which he was living apart from his wife. He had a great habit of dancing
Irish jigs and reels, and could do them very well. One miner with whom
he was very friendly asked him where he learnt these Irish dances, and he
told him that he had been in Ireland. He said that he ran away from a
college in France when he was 14 years old, in company with another boy.
They stole £SOO, and went to Ireland, to the seat of the Marquis of Water-
ford, who was a particular friend of General De Lacy Evans, his uncle.
This was the statement of Evans, and was as much as he could be induced
to say about his early history. He was continually in the habit of playing
practical jokes, and often used to dress up as a woman for the amusement
of those at the hotel. He had a fine voice, and frequently sang. He took
a delight in singing contralto, and sometimes, when he thought himself
alone, he would sing in a purely woman’s voice. Evans always wore a
cap while he was working, and his beardless face and feminine voice caused
the miners to express doubts as to whether he was a man. On the day
that his wife’s child was bom he appeared quite jovial, and “shouted”
for his fellow-workmen in honour of the occasion. However, the event
seemed to have puzzled him (and it might very naturally have that effect),
for ever since he has moped about, and appeared to have lost all his
vivacity, so that the miners called him the “ old woman.” He worked in
the mine up to the 18th July, after which his proceedings are public.
It might be mentioned that when Evans arrived at Myer’s Creek, in
1862, and entered into the employment of Joseph Dorrizzi, he continually
stated that he was a nephew of General De Lacy Evans, and had buried a
wife and two children in Melbourne. He was considered very young to
have passed through that experience, but his reply was that he was not so
young as he looked. He used to take great trouble to prove his relationship,
and had a stock of letters always with him, which he made a practice
of showing to everyone he met. A man, who now resides on Sandhurst,
states that one night he was overtaken by a storm at Myer’s Creek, and
took shelter in Dorrizzi’s hut. Evans, whom he considered a raw lad of 18
or 19, was in the hut, and had only been there cutting wood for two or
three days. The man had his supper, and took no notice of the lad, so
after a while Evans said to him, “I suppose you don’t know who I
am.” He said he did not. “ Then I’ll tell you,” said Evans
“I’m Edward De Lacy, nephew of General De Lacy. Read
that,” at the same time handing him a letter. The other handed
him it back, saying, “ I don’t want to read other people’s letters.”
Evans then read it to him. It was written in a female hand, which
Evans said was his sister’s, and purported to give an account of a fortune
he was to receive. Evans pointed particularly to a list of figures contained
in the letter, which, he said, were the amounts coming to him, and the


dates on which he Was to receive them. The man, however, took very little
notice of what Evans was telling him, and when it was time to go to bed he
inquired where he was to sleep. There were no spare beds, so he was told
to sleep with Evans in a bed on the floor. He did so, but states that he
slept on the outside of the bed, and remained in entire ignorance of the
fact that his bedfellow was a young and handsome woman.
Mrs. M'Evoy (already referred to) accosted Evans, the first time she saw
him, as “ Nelly Lacy.” Evans seemed greatly astonished, and said he did
not like that name. Mrs. M'Evoy told her neighbours that Evans was a
woman, whom she had known well in Ireland, and whose maiden name was
Ellen Lacy. She said that there Ellen Lacy married a sailor named Tremaye,
by whom she had two children. She went with her husband to Quebec, and
some time afterwards returned to Cork with the children, but without the
husband. She left the children in charge of her parents, and emigrated
to Australia. Mrs. M‘Bvoy positively stated that when she left Ireland,
some short time after Ellen Tremaye, the children were in the charge of
their grand-parents. The doubt about Evans’s sex was a subject of
notoriety throughout the neighbourhood. One thing noticed was the
appearance of ms throat, which was truly feminine. After being accosted
by Mrs. M‘Evoy, Evans kept out of her way, and generally was very
reserved. But the way in which he used to work, especially ploughing, at
which he was an adept, dissipated the idea of his not being a man, for the
people used to say, “Well, if he is a woman, he’s a very good plough-
man.” It has been suggested that Evans’s matrimonial proclivities are
accounted for by an inter-madness, which must all along have affected him.
If that be the case, however, there appears to have been great method in
his madness. He married Miss Delahunty, who had £BOO, and his marriage
with Sarah Moore has all the semblance of a match for money, not “ love.”
It appears that the girl Moore had saved up about £4O, and Evans knew it.
After they married, he said to her one day, “ Sarah, lend me £5, will
you? I’m rather short just at present.” She replied that she thought
she was marrying a rich man, and had sent her money home to her parents
in Ireland. This was another disappointment to Evans, for Miss Dela-
hunty had pursued a similar unsatisfactory course with her money.
Another proof of his “ method” is seen in the clever manner in which he
swindled Dorrizzi of his £175, and his care to place himself beyond the
criminal law by entering into partnership with the Italian, and obtaining
management of the funds for “ Evans and Co.”
This concludes the known history of Evans’s masculine career in the
colony. There can be no doubt ihat it has been an exciting one. With-
out regard at all to the question of the disguise, the various phases of life
through which, as a man, Evans has passed, the many different occupa-
tions he has been engaged in, and his evident adaptability for them all, the
continued reverses that have overtaken him, and the continuous uninter-
rupted term of hard work that he has endured for two-and-twenty years
may well attract our attention. But when, in addition to the fact that
the trials of life have been so fully borne, we have to consider that the
individual who sustained so large a proportion of the troubles of mankind
was not a man, but a woman; when we recollect that, actuated by shame
or fear, she assumed, and for a score of years maintained, a disguise of her
sex that may be said to have unsexed her altogether, to have robbed her
of every womanly sentiment and impulse, and even, to an extent, subverted
her very nature from the original disposition of creation; when we bear in


mind the continual increasing anxiety that must hare tortured her brain
by day, and driven sleep away at night, lest she should be discovered, and
that, at last, the cause of her exposure is due to the fact that the con-
tinual strain which her unending worry had upon her reason, has, at
last, conquered her sanity and taken her beyond her ovn control; when
we consider all this, should we feel disposed to harshly criticise her impos-
ture ? The suffering she has undergone should plead in her own behalf,
and make us regard her as one to be more pitied than condemned.
THE PA T I ENT
Was brought to the hospital, from Kew, on the 3rd September, and put to
bed. She—for once more she was a woman—has remained very quiet, and
obstinately silent. She was examined by the doctors, who state, as a
result, that she is not an hermaphrodite, but a real woman, and that she
has borne one or more children. As far as the disease that brought her to
the hospital—her insanity—is concerned, the attack does not seem a very
bad one. The circumstances of “ his’’ life make it very probable that
“ his” chief ailment is cerebral mania, which has caused the insane desire
of marrying women, and which of a necessity produces amentia. The
cause of none of the wives exposing the deception practised on them has
been, without doubt, nymphomania. It is considered likely by Dr.
Poland—and his experience should be a sufficient judge—that, in a few
weeks, the patient wall be all right again. All required is rest, quiet, good
nourishment, and the absence of the practices which have caused the mental
weakness, to restore her again to good mental health, and it is believed that
in a short time she will be all right again.
Since her return to the hospital she has been interviewed by many people
who knew her as a man, and many who did not know her, but were
curious to see her. On the day she arrived, her first visitors were the
reporters, who found her a very unsatisfactory subject for interviewing.
She asked if the “ old woman” was all right; said she was 41 years of age,
and a miner, but this was all that could be possibly ascertained from her ;
and, in reply to other questions, she gave disconnected and absurd answers,
such as saying “she was married by an hotelkeeper.” Constable Bradley,
who had served Evans with a summons for rates four years ago, called at
the hospital during the day, and addressing the patient, asked, “ How are
you?” She replied ,“ Well, Bradley, old man ; I’m first-rate, thank you.”
The next day, Mrs. Evans, “the wife,” visited her. She did not bring
the child. The wife appeared to be in a sad state, and innocently inquired
of the doctor if the statements that Evans was a woman were true. He
assured her that they were, but she insisted that she had never been
aware of the fact. In order that she might not be in any further doubt,
the wife, at the doctor’s suggestion, satisfied herself by examination of the
correctness of his statement. Mrs. Evans was accompanied by Mr. and
Mrs. , old friends of the family. Evans accosted the friends and greeted
them cordially, but gave the wife a cold reception, upbraiding her for having
brought “him” into all this trouble, through causing “his” removal into the
hospital in the first place, when such a course was quite unnecessary. To
the gentleman friend Evans said, “Ah, old fellow, I’m cooked now; I’ll
never get over this.” “He ” was told not to speak so foolishly, but per-
sisted in the remark, maintaining that “he” was done for, and all through


“ his” wife. Evans said, “Well, never mind ; wait until Iget out, and then
I’ll make it warm for somebody,” and afterwards stated that “he” never
was a fit subject for such a place. “He” maintained that “he” was per-
fectly right,but that the dreadful treatment “he” had received since in the
hands of the authorities was enough to drive one mad, especially at the Kew
Asylum. ‘‘ He’ ’ complained of the female clothing supplied, and said, “Look
here at these d—d petticoats they want me to wear. I wish I had a proper
suit of clothes, such as Ihad before.” Evans added thatif “ he” could only
get a suit of male attire, that “he” would leave the hospital, and says that
no one can keep “him” there ‘ ‘ He’ ’ also begged Mr. B to bring ‘ ‘ him’ ’
a suit of men’s clothes. Evans called his wife to “him,’’and in a low
tone of voice said, “ You keep your own counsel; they shall never get any-
thing out of me ; you have said too much already; you had better go home
to your old father. I worked hard to make a good home for you, but you
put me in this position.” Softening down a little, “ he” then said, “Iwould
work again for you, for you are my wife, and belong to me in spite of the
world, and I defy them to take you from me.” “He,” however, seemed very
affectionate to the wife when parting, and wept, also cautioning her to get
possession of the marriage lines. Evans remarked that the matter had made
“ adevilof astir” in the papers, and was sorry it had gained such publicity.
On Friday, sth September, she refused to take any food, and said she was
very ill. One gentleman who visited her was taken for a clergyman, for she
told him that she wished she were in Heaven, and wept bitterly. She asked
the gentleman alluded to to get the doctor to leave the outer door open, as the
air was very close. He showed her how well her room was ventilated, but she
made no answer. It would appear probable that this request was only a
ruse to enable her to get away. During the day she admitted that she
had borne a child in Ireland, but would give no further information con-
cerning herself. The same afternoon Mr. visited her, as he had pro-
mised on the previous day he would. She appeared pleased to see him, and
asked if he had brought the suit of clothes. He said he could not bring
them in there, as the hospital officials would prevent him. She made no
reply, but as soon as the nurse, who had been in the room, went out, the
patient suddenly jumped out of bed, caught hold of Mr. , and
endeavoured to pull off his coat. Mr. is not a man of great stature,
but he struggled with the woman, and managed to retain his garment till
help arrived, and she was put back in the bed.
Since Friday, the patient seems to be improving, and it is quite likely
that in a few weeks she will be able to go about again. What her course
will be then it is difficult to conjecture. A charitable suggestion has been
made to raise a subscription in order to enable her to leave the colony, and
go to some place where her history is not known. Whether it will be
carried out remains to be seen. In the Melbourne SeraU of Monday,
Bth September, appears a letter signed James Ross, for 17 years Res. Sec. of
Wis. Ed. and Pub. corroborating the remarkable “ change of sex,” which
is extracted from La Crosse Democrat, and published in the beginning of
this pamphlet. The particulars regarding the Evans case are obtained
from reliable sources, and can be depended on as correct. _ The case
is certainly the strangest that has ever occurred in this portion of the
globe, and as wonderful, perhaps, as any that has happened. There is,
without doubt, a great romance in the full history of this mys-
terious woman, but that could be only ascertained from her {lips,
and she is silent. But the information concerning her that has been


obtained is sufficiently marvellous to astonish not only Australia but the
world, and is not likely to be forgotten, until the advancement of the world
in the knowledge of things mysterious shall render few miracles strange,
and none impossible.
On Wednesday, 10th September, a magisterial inquiry concerning the
patient, Ellen Tremaye, was held in the board-room of the hospital, before
Messrs. Sterry and Osborne, J.P.’s The following evidence was taken:—
Catherine Holt, a married woman, and a nurse at the hospital, deposed
that she was a passenger in the ship Ocean Monarch , which sailed from
Plymouth in October or November, 1856, and arrived in Melbourne on
22nd June, 1857. She identified the person now in the lunatic ward of
the Bendigo Hospital, under the name of Edward de Lacy Evans, as a
fellow-passenger who went by the name of Ellen Tremaye, and who
arrived with witness and the rest of the passengers. After landing, she
remained in the depot for a few days, and then took a place up-country, and
witness never saw her again until she saw her in the lunacy ward of the
Bendigo Hospital. She was in male attire then, and witness did not
recognise her then, but she recognised the voice, only she could not tell
where she had heard it. When she (Tremaye) was returned to the hospital
from the Kew Asylum, witness recognised her at once as her fellow-
passenger, Ellen Tremaye. Witness had not the least doubt she was the
person who came out as Ellen Tremaye. She appeared to be about 21
years of age. She was somewhat strange in her behaviour on board ship.
She used to wear gentlemen’s under-garments, and tried to make the other
girls believe she was a man. There was another girl on the ship named
Mary Delahunty, who slept with Tremaye from Rio Janerio. Witness
afterwards heard that Tremaye had married this girl Delahunty in
Melbourne.
Mary Rutledge deposed that she was a married woman, living on the
M‘lvor-rc ad, Sandhurst, and arrived in this colony from Plymouth about
23 years ago, in a ship called the Ocean Monarch. She was then unmarried
and amongst the passengers was a girl called Ellen Tremaye, who
landed in Melbourne, and went to the depot with witness. Witness had
never seen her since then until this (Wednesday) morning in the lunacy
wards of the Bendigo Hospital, under the name of Edward de Lacy Evans.
Witness recognised her at once as Ellen Tremaye, her shipmate. She had
never seen her until she saw her on board the ship, but was fully satisfied
it was the same person. The female passengers used to remark that she
was more like a boy than a girl. Witness was unwell during the whole
voyage, and Ellen Tremaye occasionally paid her little attentions.
Dr. Poland deposed that he had examined the lunatic, Ellen Tremaye.
She was suffering from dementia, and was unfit to be at large. He recom-
mended her to be sent to the Kew Lunatic Asylum. She was the same
patient who was committed on the 22nd July, 1879, to the lunacy ward of
the Bendigo Hospital as Edward de Lacy Evans. She was then dressed
in male attire, and wss subsequently transferred to Kew Lunatic Asylum,
from whence she was returned, having been found to be a female, and has
since remained in the lunacy ward of the Bendigo Hospital under his
treatment. She is a female.
Dr. Hinchclifl deposed that he had examined the female at present in
the Bendigo Hospital under the name of Ellen Tremaye. She is suffering
from dementia, and is unfit to be at large, and he recommended her to be
forwarded to the Lunatic Asylum, Kew.


The magistrates ordered her to be forwarded to the Lunatic Asylum,
Kew.
On the same day Madame Sibley, the phrenologist and mesmerist, who
was on a visit to the city, had an interview with Ellen Tremaye at the
Bendigo Hospital, and the result is the following chart of the woman’s
phrenological developments:—“The brain is extraordinarily large for a
female, structure of body coarse and fibrous, animal propensities excessively
developed, and situated low in the occipital region. The reasoning facul-
ties are very compressed. These combinations impart sensual and carnal
passions as well as obtuse feelings and intellectual capacity. Constructive-
ness, ideality, self-esteem, firmness, combativeness and coneentrativeness
occupying such prominent positions in her organisation, impart great
desire for physical exercises and manly occupations ; also desires to be her
own master, and not have her actions curbed by man’s influences. Naturally
argumentative, and inclined to be domineering and authoritative, and would,
if taught, have made a good practical engineer, blacksmith, or coach and
carriage builder, as the brain shows splendid mechanical devices, and a
powerful perceptive ingenuity. Memory is failing through disease, and the
pareital and frontal bones show indications of pareital separation ; this, I
feel assured, would be produced by over-anxiety and study in reference to
things of a mechanical nature. There is also the appearance of a soft fluid
between the skins on the top of the head, which, I infer, is the cause of the
present mental depression. Benevolence and parental love being so large,
naturally produces love and kindly feeling to children. Appetite for food
moderate, and for tobacco and drink more than full. Language very small.
Floral, horticultural, as well as agricultural pursuits, are rather a passion
with her from her organisation.’’
In the Melbourne Herald of Bth September the following official corrobo-
ration of information previously given is published:—“Some further par-
ticulars were obtained on Saturday last relative to the woman Tremaye, or
the He Lacy Evans case. At Williamstown there are at present living two
persons who came out in the ship Ocean Monarch with the girl Tremaye.
Upon our reporter interviewing them, a detailed account of the voyage of
the vessel, from the start at Plymouth to anchoring in Hobson’s Bay, was
obtained. One of these persons at the time was under matron, and in her
charge the girl was placed immediately after the ship getting to sea. Her
name then was Miss Wain, and she had with her another assistant named
Miss Hind. These ladies were under the supervision of the head matron,
Mrs. Matthews, and not Mrs. Holt, as has been reported. The other person
interviewed was Mr. Paine, at present engaged at the crushing works,
Williamstown, and who, while on board the Ocean Monarch , had frequent
opportunities of seeing the girl Tremaye. In all the circumstances they both
agree as to what took place on board the ship. Through some delay in
the fitting out of the vessel, the emigrants were not put on board for a
month after the time agreed upon. This would be in November, 1855,
when the vessel sailed. They were kept in the depot at Plymouth, and
the peculiarities of the girl were at first noticed there. She was very
anxious to be allowed to frequently leave the depot, and appeared every-
day to be expecting to see some one come after her. Her conduct was so
unusual that the passengers remarked that she had the appearance of being
a boy dressed in girl’s clothes. Shortly after the ship got to sea, the
head'matron, on making an examination of her charges, noticed the cuffs
of a man’s shirt protruding under the sleeves of a sealskin jacket the girl


wore at the time, and, drawing them up, jocularly remarked to her:
‘ ‘ What! do you wear shirts ?’ ’ Seven days out, when the vessel was in the
Bay of Biscay, with a very high sea on and a heavy stretch, the ship was
dismasted; and the weather being so had that she could not return to port,
she was hove to, and it was some days before the floating masts could be
recovered and the vessel proceed on the passage. As Mr. Paine states, the
masts were completely shaken out ef the ship. During the whole of this
time all kinds of jokes were played upon Tremaye, and they used to taunt
her with being a boy. In playing, she would grasp her playmates by the
shoulder as a boy would do. Just before reaching Rio Janeiro, it
was found out that a severe fever had broken out on board, and all
haste was made to that port. Several of the passengers succumbed to
the disease, and when the vessel arrived, all were transferred to a
man-of-war frigate that was there, so that their own vessel might
be cleaned and fumigated. Here Tremaye lost her berth companion,
a tall, fair girl, who died from the cholera. Several of the girls also
ran away from the ship at this port, but came on to Melbourne afterwards.
A delay of over two months ocoured; then the ship again weighed
anchor, and proceeded to this port. For some little time all went well,
and the emigrants again began to get into a happy mood. The chaff was
again bandied about among them. One day it was reported to Captain
Lawson, who was in charge, that some of the passengers had been robbed,
and the perpetrator not being found, it was determined that the whole of
the passengers* luggage and the berths should be searched. This was the
work of some time, and the matrons had great difficulty in performing the
task. Tremaye objected strongly to have her effects disturbed, and it
was with the greatest difficulty and persuasion that Miss Wain, the matron,
in company with another, could induce Tremaye to open the only trunk
she had in her cabin. Upon doing so, instead of a quantity of female
clothing being found therein, a very scanty lot of men’s clothing, together
with several shirts, were the objects presented to their view. This having
got bruited about the ship, of course more talk was made of Tremaye s
appearance, and, at the request of some of the passengers, it was determined
that Tremaye should be taken before Dr. Burke, who was in charge, and
he was to decide the question as to what sex Tremaye belonged. The
head matron was communicated with, and she, in turn, informed the doctor
of the suspicion that had been raised. He without any hesitation sent for
Tremaye, and, in company with the matron, an adjournment to the surgery
was made. The result of such investigation was anxiously looked for by
the greater number of passengers on board, who flocked round the door,
awaiting the decision of the medical gentleman. However, that was never
made known on board,’as, when the doctor emerged from his surgery, the
only remark he made to them was, that they were all to go away about
their business, and not to let him hear any more of that nonsense. At times
she was very quiet and reserved, and would only speak to her companion,
a little dark girl, whom she had become acquainted with since the loss of
the other friend at Rio Janeiro. At other times she was the life and soul
of those on board, and very lively, and was often heard to remark she would
surprise some of them yet, and wished she had left with one of her friends,
Tilla Isaacs, at Rio Janeiro. She would never go into the lavatory for
washing or other purposes while any of her fellow-passengers were there,
and this also was a matter of remark to them. One peculiar circumstance
with her was, she wore the same outer clothing the whole of the passage,


from the day she arrived at Plymouth to leaving the vessel in the Bay.
This was a common green kind of merino dress, and the sealskin jacket
spoken of, which reached nearly down to her feet. The box she bad with
her was a kind of boot-trunk, and had the words “ Do Lacy Evans” painted
in legible letters on the lid. At times, when the weather was very
rough, and some of her associates were afraid the vessel would be lost,
she would turn round to them and tell them not to be afraid, as she
was bom with a caul over her, and there was no fear of her losing her life
or the vessel going down while she was on board. Before the vessel could
reach the Bay, it was found necessary to put into Port Eairy, as the
provisions had entirely run out, and they could not proceed further. Here
a delay of several days occurred, and some of the passengers commenced
fishing, Tremaye joining in the sport, and being the first to make a haul,
which she handed over to her cabin companion. The ship, after being
quarantined, reached the Bay on 27th June, 1856, and was boarded by Mr.
Board, immigration officer, and Dr. Wilkins, medical officer, who, after
inspecting the whole of the passengers and immigrants, gave them clearance,
and they were transferred into the tug Kangaroo , and conveyed up the
river to Melbourne. Tremaye and her companion remained on board to
the last, and left together.”
A correspondent of The Bendigo Independent at Simmonds’ Reef, Black-
wood, gives a few particulars regarding De Lacy Evans whilst living at
Blackwood and elsewhere. He says :—“You ask me if I know De Lacy
Evans. I know him rather too well. He is like a great many more. He
left something behind that I don’t suppose he will ever pay. As for your
saying his wife (the first) is living at Blackwood, that is a mistake. She is
now a married woman, residing at Daylesford. Evans came to Blackwood
from Melton, near Bacchus Marsh, where he married his first wife. He was
living here for some time before he sent for her. Evans was at that time
driving horses for a Mr. Guppy. After his wife rejoined him they did not
live comfortably together. He used to say he would or could not support
her. Soon after she started a private school, and did very well, as she was
a very good scholar and an excellent teacher. She appeared to earn a great
deal more money than Evans did as carter. Her present husband became
acquainted with her while she was keeping this school. He also learned
that they did not live comfortably together, and knowing the reason, of
which both spoke plainly, that Evans was not a man, but a women, he got
her to leave Evans. The neighbours thought the gentleman alluded to did
nothing but what was right. He soon afterwards took the woman and
married her. A year afterwards they had a child, but there was no children
born during her career as Evans’s ‘wife.’ I have heard Mrs. Guppy say
that her husband knew Evans was a woman, and was the same person that
he had seen in Melton engaged as a servant girl at a public-house. Evans,
it appears, after leaving this public-house as a girl, returned there a few
months afterwards dressed as a man, thinking she would not be recognised,
but the landlord of the hotel said he was sure she was the same person.
Owing to certain events that had taken place during the time Evans had
been engaged there as a general servant, the landlord made a great noise,
and he and his wife, it is said, nearly separated over it. However, the
husband, when he saw Evans in male attire, made it very hot for him, and
he had to clear out as fast as he could go.”
Regarding Evans’s last marriage at Ballarat, another correspondent
writes : —“ In 1868 or 1869 I knew Evans. He was staying at the Royal


Mail Hotel, Lydiard-streot. I knew he was about to be married to a young
woman who had just arrived from Sandhurst. I was asked to go to the
wedding. I would not go, but consented to take charge of the hotel bar and
dining-rooms, in order that the landlady, Mrs. Stoney, and a groom in her
employ, might attend the marriage and sign the register as witnesses.
Mrs. Stoney’s name is on the marriage lines as a witness, as also is the
groom’s. They were married by the Rev. Mr. Henderson at his private
residence. The parties stayed three weeks at the hotel before they got
married. On leaving they left a sewing machine behind them as security
for an unpaid bill.”
In default of information from the woman herself as to the circumstances
that caused her to disguise her sex, and to adopt the name of Edward de
Lacy Evans, the public must rely on the probabilities that are suggested by
the information obtained. It seems tolerably clear that the immediate cause
of her leaving Ireland was the disgrace consequent on giving birth to
an illegitimate child. After that event she, for a short time, lived an
immoral life in Ireland. The particular reason (for a reason there must have
been) why she chose the name of De Lacy Evans, and steadily persisted
throughout in maintaining that she was a nephew of the general of that
name, can only be surmised. It is evident that her choice was not made
by chance, for even while she bore the name of Ellen Tremaye on board the
vessel, she had a trunk labelled with the name she subsequently assumed.
How did she become possessed of that ? A supposition, quite a reasonable
one, in the absence of proof, is that Edward de Lacy Evans was the name
of her seducer, and the father of her child, and that when induced by
shame to leave the place where she had so disgraced herself, he promised
to accompany her, and sent his trunk on board, in order to delude her into
the belief that he was going. This idea was first surmised in The Bendigo
Independent two or three days after the imposture was discovered, and
nearly a fortnight afterwards the same journal published the following
paragraph, that greatly supports its supposition :—“Another very interest-
ing fact has just been stated to us, which at the present stage is certainly
of a startling nature, viz., that a young man, supposed to be the genuine
Edward de Lacy Evans, has actually been working in the Bendigo district.
It appears that some twenty years ago, Mr. C. H. Read, a member of the
Strathfieldsaye Shire Council, had in his employ as a labourer, at his farm on
the Sheepwash, a young man who was known under the name of Edward
de Lacy Evans, and it is clear he was not the same individual as the
impostor, Ellen Tremaye, the description being entirely different. He was
a rather handsome young fellow, well-developed, and with fine flowing
whiskers considering his age. Since that time, however, Mr. Read has
never seen him.” Moreover, a well-known chemist, residing in Ballarat,
has written to a gentleman residing in this city to the effect that on the
ship Matoka, by which he came to the colony in June, 1858, there was as
passenger a young man named De Lacy Evans, whose description
corresponds with that given by Mr. Read. He appeared to be a rather
“loose sort of character,” and was considered “very fast.” The gentleman
alluded to knows nothing of his proceedings after reaching Victoria,
but his authority is sufficient proof of the man’s actual arrival. If this
theory be adopted, for which, as it must be admitted, there is fairly good
evidence, the perplexing mystery of the celebrated name which the impost't
adopted is to a great extent solved. Read by the light of the admissions
which the patient has herself made, nothing appears contradictory or


improbable, and the imagination may well be permitted some scope in a
theme so wonderfid and strange.
The Corop correspondent of The Bendigo Independent , writes “ I leam
that there is a lady in this district who knew all about Evans's early dsys.
The person I refer to does not like to go into particulars too much, as she
has friends and relations living in the same place as De Lacy Evans came
from. However, I gleaned a little news from her that I have not seen in
print yet. She says that Ellen Lacy was bom and reared in a village named
Harristown, parish of Temple Orem, county Kilkenny, and about 12 miles
from Waterford. Her parents were well-to-do farmers, and very respect-
ably connected. When about 17 or 18 years of age she met with a mis-
fortune that brought disgrace on herself and family, so that she had to go
away. She went to Liverpool and thence to America, where she made her
appearance in the highest social circles as Mrs. De Lacy Evans. She was
supposed to be married to a foreign count of that name. She caused quite
a sensation. She was a splendid dancer, singer, and horsewoman, and, in
fact, was quite a belle. Then she went over to her native country, and
visited all the notable places, and showed her husband (supposed) the
beautiful scenery that Kilkenny is noted for. Amongst the places they
visited were the Marquis of AVaterford’s and the Earl of Bessborough’s
estates. The latter was at one time Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. They
were also present at the launch of the Wonder, a ship built by a man
named Dewan, and bis seven sons, all the timber used in building her
being taken from the Bessborough estate. The ship was christened the
Wonder by a Miss Gregory, daughter of the minister of Pittown, an
adjacent village. During the ceremony the crowd hooted Ellen De Lacy,
and at last they dragged her off her pony, and she had to clear out. It is
supposed that it was there that Evans (the reputed husband) found out her
previous character, and immediately afterwards they left the country, and
it was generally supposed that they went to Australia ; but they were
never heard of afterwards. The lady who gave me these particulars did
so very reluctantly, as there is a large family of the Laoys at Harristown.
They are very respectable people, and she is also afraid to have her name
mentioned, as the news is bound to go home, and she would not like to
open afresh the old wounds. Ellen's father used to keep the beat of blood
horses, so she was a splendid rider.”
ELLEN TREMAYE'S CONFESSION.
Though a good deal of information has been obtained from the patient
herself that did not find its way into the papers, she is not at all oisposed
to be communicative, and when questioned, relapses into a sullen silence.
It is evident now that her insanity has been very slight, and that she is
rapidly recovering altogether from its effects. The items here given are
obtained more by accidental admissions of the woman than from her direct
statements, but she vouches for all she does say, by continually exclaiming,
"That’s the truth, every word of it.” Up to a few days ago she con-
tinued moping and crying, and when she was tol I that she was to be trans-
mitted to Kew, her grief became excessive. However, a gentleman con-
nected with the Hospital Board, by whom she was at one time employed,
visited her, and seeing her great distress at the prospect of removal, inter-
ested himself on her behalf, and obtained a revocation of the order con-


signing her to Kew. "When she heard that news, she became quite light-
hearted, and has remained cheerful ever since. The wonderful alteration in
her appearance during the fortnight she had been in the hospital seems
really magical. She has become altogether effeminised, and it is difficult
to believe now that so womanly-looking an individual could ever have
passed for a man. Her breasts have regained almost their normal condi-
tion ; the wrinkles in her face have disappeared, her arras are becoming
fleshy, and the scars and marks on them being eradicated Her former
silence was not, it appears, so much the result of her desire for conceal-
ment as the consequence of an affection of the throat, which prevented her
from speaking without pain. Still, although she says she is willing to
tell anything, her replies are so meagre and contradictory that her good
faith may well be doubted, audit appears probable that though her “mad-
ness” has left her, the “method” has remained. Hitherto she has been
very sad and serious, but latterly she allows herself to smile, and occasion-
ally indulges in a laugh. Sho spends her time sitting near the fire in a
woman’s dress and shawl during the day, and sleeping at night.
The first information she volunteered was concerning the [events that
brought about her mental derangements, and the immediate circumstances
connected with the discovery of her imposture. She had no hesitation in
speaking about her wife, and said that she knew who was the father of the
child, and stated also that the wife was again enceinte. She said she worked
hard, and worked the flesh off her bones to make the wife comfortable,
until she found out that she was not “true.” After the child was born
also she became entangled in financial difficulties, and “somehow lost the
house” she lived in and owned. “ Everything coming together,” shesaid
“was enough to drive a man mad.” She was asked whether she did no
know that her disguise was sure to be discovered when she went to Kew,
and she replied that she had lost all care about it, and didn’t mind if she
was found out. Her account of the discovery was rather comical, and its
relation seemed to amuse her considerably. Her own words were :—“I
was sittin’ in the carriage at the railway station, an’ the wife was oryin’,
an’the kid squealin’, an’ I waslaughin’ at’em. Well, when we got to Kew,
the fellers there took hold o’ me to give me a bath, an’ they stripped me fo
put me in th e water, an’ then they saw the mistake. One feller ran off as if he
was frightened; the others looked thunderstruck an’ couldn’t speak. I
was handed over to the women, and they dressed me up in frocks and
petticoats. They sent me up here, but kept my men’s clothes behind,
and as soon as I went to bed they took back the woman’s clothes
they had lent me.” She then commenced to give a history of her career,
but her statements were so disjointed and erratic that it would be
almost impossible to follow her. She admitted that she gave birth to an
illegitimate child in her native village, near Waterford, but would not
state the name of her seducer. She said after that she led an immoral life ;
but after a few months was obliged to leave the country, and she went to
America. This statement is in keeping with the account given by the lady
at Corop. She then came out to Australia, and the next year went back
again to America, and subsequently to Ireland. When asked about the
child, she said it had died at home, but was persistent in saying that “it
died honestly.” She states that she came out a second time to this colony
in the Ocean Monarch , in 1857. When asked about the man De Lacy
Evans, said to have been in Mr. Bead’s employment 20 years ago, she
admitted that ho had been in the colony, but said she did not know where


he wu now, or she would write to him for money. She would say nothing
at all regarding his relation to herself, and seemed especially reticent as far
as he was concerned. It was suggested that she ought to write home to
her parents, but she replied that she did not know where they were, and
that she could work for money. She said she had worked all her life, but
hadn’t a “ shilling in the world” now, but if anyone gave her money to go
away, she would pay them back. She asserts positively that she only had
two wives, Sarah Moore and Julia Marquand, and says that she knew Mary
Ann Delahunty on the voyage, but did not marry her. On this point she
is evidently speaking untruthfully, for she adds that she never lived at
Mount Blackwood. She became very irritable when closely questioned, and
at last refused to speak at all. At the conclusion of the interview, how-
ever, she shook hands warmly with her visitor, and wished him “ all sorts
of good luck.” This is all she has stated, and it is needless for curiosity to
be too pressing on her. If she has sinned she has suffered, and her long
life of hard work ought to be a sufficient penance for her youthful weak-
nesses. At the age of forty-four years, she is now, as she says, without a
friend and without a shilling, so that pity for her misfortunes is the most
charitable and most just sentiment, and if to that is added a little generous
help to remove the unhappy creature to a country where her career of im-
posture is not known, our citizens will have earned the reward which
attaches to the performance of a good action, the sense of having done
their duty as Christians and men.

In reply to your letter of this day’s date concerning “Ellen
Tremaye,” I have the honour to inform you that this person, when known
as “ Edward De Lacy Evans,” was employed as a miner by several com-
panies of which I am the legal manager, and was always considered a good
and hard working miner.
De Lacy Evans was engaged by the Southern Cross Gold Mining Com-
pany, Registered, as “ working boss,” to sink an engine shaft from the
surface, having full charge of the work, which was done to the satisfaction
of the directors.
De Lacy Evans also worked as a miner for the Sea Quartz Mining
Company, Registered, and for two years and nine months prior to the
discovery of sex was employed in the mine of the Great Southern Garden
Gully Company, doing all the work of an experienced miner satisfactorily
to the managers of each company.
I have the honour to be, Sir,
Your obedient servant,
SYDNEY GEO. COLE, Legal Manager.
