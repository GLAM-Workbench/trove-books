DR. DILL MACKY
SOUVENIR
“One of the bravest, one of the noblest, one of
the most fearless, one of the most transparently
honest, one of the most unsophisticated, one of the
most lovable of men in the community.”

the overstrain of the work, he resigned the
position, and took up the work of evangelis-
ation in the South and West of Ireland,
where he had many an encounter with the
priest who gave him the soubriquet of “The
Cock of the North.'’ Another of his uncles
was the Rev. Richard Dill, of Osmond Quay
Presbyterian Church, Dublin, the founder
of the Magee College, in which Dr. Dill
Macky received his theological training for
the work of the ministry.

filled with ability and popularity for several which came to her after the death of
Doctor Macky in Doctor’s Gown.

ASTRIDE “ROARING MEG.”
When about sixteen years of age, Dr,
Dill Macky, whose educational training had
hitherto been confined to the National
School curriculum, began the study of the
Classics in a seminary situated on the walls
of Derry, and overlooking one of the Bas-
tions in which were mounted the old guns
which did battle at the Siege. Dr. Dill
Macky still speaks of how, as a boy, he
used to sit astride “Roaring Meg” and pic-
ture to himself the bygone days when the
brave fathers held the “maiden city” in the
face of King James’s army, and answered
every challenge sent to them, whether of
threat or promise, with their own battle cry,
“No Surrender.”
A DERRY PRENTICE BOY.
In these days Dr. Macky was a member
of one of the “Prentice Boys” clubs, whose
title, by the way, was again No Surrender.
The great event of the year in connection
with these clubs is the celebration of the
anniversary of the “shutting of the gates”
on the 18th December, 1688. On the re-
turn of this day (which has been continu-
ously observed through the two centuries
which have since passed), Lundy the Trai-
tor (who would have given up the city to
King James’s army, and who saved his life
when his treachery was discovered by
sneaking out of the city disguised as a pea-
sant with a bundle of scallops on his back)
is publicly burned from the top of Walker’s
Monument, amidst the salvos of cannon and
the huzzahing of multitudes (who assemble
in thousands from the borders of the neigh-
bouring counties.) No doubt these early in-
fluences and environments helped to the
deepening and strengthening of Dr. Dill
Macky’s Protestantism, which, as he has
often declared from the platform, he im-
bibed with his mother’s milk.
THE CROSS OF BALLINASCREEN.
In 1869 Dr. Macky matriculated for the
study of Arts in Magee College, and four
years afterwards, having finished his arts
course, he entered the Theological Hall.
During these years he gained many prizes
and scholarships, and at the end of his
course in 1876 was licensed by the Derry
Presbytery to preach the gospel. In .the
early part of the same year, 1876, he re-
ceived a call from the members and adher-
ents of the congregation of Draperstown,
popularly known as the Cross of Ballina-
screen, to become their minister. He ac-
cepted the call, and was ordained by the
Presbytery of Magherafelt in the month of
November. Here he laboured for ten years,
beloved by all the Protestant sections of
the community, who testified the love and
esteem in which they held him, by subscrib


ing a public testimonial in the shape of a
purse of sovereigns and an illuminated ad
dress on resigning his charge of Drapers-
town preparatory to his coming to New
South Wales. This address Dr. Dill Macky
still has in his possession.
DARING TO STAND ALONE
On two other occasions during his minis-
try in Draperstown he was the recipient of
addresses and testimonials from his own
people. In politics Dr. Dill Macky was at
this time a strong Conservative, and took
an active part in the Parliamentary elec-
tions. Most of the ministers of the Pres-
byterian Church were then strong Liberals
and staunch supporters of Mr. Gladstone.
Indeed, in his own Presbytery, the Presby-
tery of Magherafelt, he stood alone, as he
has done many a time since, in advocating
the principles he believed. Dr. Dill Macky
distrusted Mr. Gladstone and his policy in
connection with Ireland. He disbelieved
in him even when he was declaring that
Parnell and his company were “steeped to
the lips in treason.’’ The last election
■campaign he engaged in was when Colonel
McCalmont, Conservative, was fighting
Caunty Derry against the Liberal (Mr. Find-
later) and the Home Ruler (Mr. Tim
Healy). In this contest all the members
of the Magherafelt Presbytery were fight-
ing strenuously for Gladstone and Mr.
Findlater. Dr. Dill Macky alone among
them supported the Conservative candidate.
He warned the Presbyterians of County
Derry of Mr. Gladstone’s ulterior aim, the
granting of Home Rule to the Irish, but
such an idea at that time was ridiculed. It
must have been some kind of satisfaction,
therefore, to Dr. Dill Macky some two or
three years later to see his forecast fulfilled
and the General Assembly of the Presby-
terian Church of Ireland called together
specially to denounce the Irish policy of the
man whom at one time they almost idolised.
THREATENING LETTERS.
In Dr. Dill Macky’s own parish the Ro-
man Catholics were by far in the majority,
and especially was this the case in the little
town which is the centre of the parish.
Most of the shopkeepers and all the publi-
cans, of course, belonged to the Roman Ca-
tholics. They were furious at the Doctor,
and many a threatening letter did he re-
ceive of what would happen if he did not
keep his tongue quiet. But such threats
he treated then, as he has done ever since,
with contempt, although he was always pre-
pared for the worst. One one occasion he
accompanied Colonel McCalmont to Gar-
vagh and made a powerful speech there on
his behalf.
A PLOT THAT FAILED.
At the close of his speech Lady Garvagh’s
coachman sought a private interview with
the Doctor, and told him that he had over-
heard a conversation between the carman
who had driven Dr. Macky from Drapers-
town and some Garvagh Roman Catholics,
in which the carman stated that he (Dr.
Macky) was to be waylaid that night on his

return home, and beaten within an inch of
his life. The coachman strongly advised
the Doctor to dismiss his carman, employ a
Protestant cardriver from Garvagh, and re-
turn by - a different route from that by
which he had come. Dr. Macky simply


is certain —Barney did not return by the
road he had come, and he landed the Doctor
safely at his own house in the early hours
of the morning.
ARRIVAL IN AUSTRALIA.
In the year 1880, Dr. Dill Macky was mar-
ried to Ellen Elizabeth Morwood, the
youngest daughter of John Morwood, Esq.,
M.D.. the late Government Medical Officer
of Draperstown. As the Doctor’s family by
his mother’s side inclined to the office of the
ministry from bygone generations, so Mrs.
Dill Macky’s family by her father’s side in-
clined to the practice of medicine, her bro-
ther, father, and grandfather for over a cen-
tury filling the same office of Dispensary
Medical Officer in the parish of Ballina-
screen. In the year 1886 Dr. Dill Macky’s
attention having been drawn by various cir-
cumstances to Sunny New South Wales, he
determined to come hither, and accord-
ingly resigned his Draperstown charge, and
in the month of November sailed with his
wife and three children for Sydney. He
landed here in the Ist of January, 1887, on
board the “Austral,” the very next trip after
her foundering in Sydney Harbour.
SOME SPY HAD “BLABBED.”
He had been led into telling a lie by
some Roman Catholics in Garvagh taunting
him about the people of Ballinascreen allow-
ing the Doctor to perambulate the country
lecturing against Home Rule without giv- SUCCESSOR TO DR. LANG,
ing him something that he would remember. In the following May he was unanimously
“I was ashamed,” he said, “of our doing so, called to the pastorate of the old Scots r

night. Some spy,” he said, “has overheard time through the death of the Rev. Milne

there is no truth in it.” Whether there was ably connected with the memorable name
or not cannot now be known, but this much of the Rev. John Dunmore Lang, D.D., who
smiled, told the coachman to have no fear
for him, and immediately ordered his own
carman to yoke up. It was then about
eleven o’clock on a cold, wintry, moonless
night. When they had started on their
journey homeward, and were about two
miles out of Garvagh, the Doctor, suddenly
addressing the driver, said: “Well, Barney,
I understand I am to get a fearful beating-
to-night. Where about on the road is this
interesting event to occur?” For a minute
or so the man was silent, then uttered a
great D and began lashing his horse
into a gallop. After a little Dr. Macky
spoke again. “Well, Barney, I would ad-
vise you to get me home in safety, for I
have two sixshooters on me at the present
time, and my fingers are even now on the
triggers, and should anything untoward
happen to me, the first man, I may tell you,
who will bite the dust, will be the driver of
this car.” Then Barney told his story.
Dr. Macky as President A.P.D.A.


founded it in the year 1820, and filled the
pulpit for a period of fifty-five years. Dr.
Lang was a unique man, a great statesman
as well as a great preacher, as is testified
to by the bronze monument erected by a
late Government to his memory in Wyn-
yard Square. What New South Wales, and,
indeed, all the States of the Commonwealth,
owe to him, has never yet been written. It
will, no doubt, one day, and then it will be
seen without invidious comparisons that no
man who ever landed on these shores did
more for the betterment of all classes of the
people than this celebrated divine and
statesman—John Dunmore Lang.
WHY HE BECAME AN ORANGEMAN.
Dr. Dill Macky was not long in Australia
before he joined the Orange Institution.
The reason for his doing so he has often
told from the public platform. “I was not
an Orangeman,” he said, “prior to my com-
ing to New South Wales. In my youth I
was an Apprentice Boy, and I suppose they
are half-brothers of Orangemen. But when
I saw the determined effort of Rome to
dominate this free country, I felt it to be
my duty to assist, by every means in my
power, those who were endeavouring by
-constitutional organisation to check her en-
croachment, and so I joined the ranks of
the Orangemen and was initiated in No. 1
Lodge within a year of my landing.” Since
then Dr. Dill Macky has been actively con-
nected with the Institution. For many
years he held the position of Grand Chap-
lain, and of his own free will resigned the
position in order, as he himself explained
at the time, that the Grand Lodge might
have the opportunity of passing the honour
along to some other worthy brother. Dr.
Dill Macky holds very strongly that these
high offices should circulate frequently, not
only for the sake of honouring brethren who
are worthy to fill them, but also for the sake
of invigorating the Institution itself by the
introduction of “new blood.”
FOUNDING THE A.P.D.A.
During sixteen years Dr. Dill Macky
while working vigorously in the Orange In-
stitution, was more and more possessed
with the feeling that the great body of Pro-
testants could never be enrolled as Orange-
men; that there were many men and wo-
men “who,” as he put it, “could not be
dragged into an Orange lodge with a team
of bullocks,” and yet whose hearts beat
true to Protestantism —men and women
who, for one reason or another, were pre-
judiced against Orangeism, and therefore
he conceived the idea of forming an organ-
isation for the defence of Protestantism
with a door wide enough and a platform
broad enough to take in the whole Protes-
tant community—men and women. In this
way the Australian Protestant Defence As-
sociation was formed by the Doctor in June,
1901, and of this Association Dr. Dill Macky
is still the honoured president, although he
has repeatedly offered, and asked to be al-
lowed to resign the position in order that
the honour might be conferred on some

other brother who has worked as loyally
and vigorously in the cause as himself.
TOOK HIS LIFE IN HIS HAND.

INAUGURATING “THE WATCHMAN.”
The story of his inauguration of “The
Watchman,” the press organ of Protes-
tantism throughout the Commonwealth, has
been so often told that there is no need to
repeat the details. It is sufficient to say
that, with less than two hundred pounds
capital, subscribed largely by working men
and women, Dr. Macky started this paper,
nursed it as a mother would a child, edited
it for a period of over two years, and at
last succeeded in floating it under the man-
agement of a company whose directors for
the present year are; —John Wheeler, Esq.
(Right Worshipful Grand Master of the
Orange Institution of Australia), A. B. Pur-
sell, Esq., James Burns, Esq., and Joshua
Heath, Esq., with the Doctor as president of
the Board. The good work which the paper
has done and is doing in connection with
the cause of Protestanism cannot be rec-
koned. Its influence is felt not only in
every State of the Commonwealth, but in
New Zealand, South Africa, Canada, and
even in the home land, where “The atch-
man” is extensively quoted, and where par-
cels of the paper are distributed every week.
“The Watchman” has now its own plant and
its own premises, and notwithstanding the
sneers which ushered in its birth, it has
become evident even to the greatest sceptic
that it has come to stay.
In his own Church —the Presbyterian
Church of New South Wales —Dr. Dill
Macky has always held a foremost place.
In 1899 he was elected Moderator of the
General Assembly, and during the same year-
received the degree of D.D. from the Pres-
byterian Theological Faculty of Ireland. In
connection with the latter honour, he was
made the recipient of an illuminated ad-
dress, with a Doctor’s gown and hood, pre-
sented to him by the members and adher-
ents of his own congregation and other out-
side friends. Dr. Dill Macky has always
taken an active part in the work of the
Christian Endeavour. In 1898 he was elec-
“Hazeldeen,” Dr. Macky’s Home at Manly


ted President of the Association in New
South Wales, and during his year of office
he devoted much time and energy to the
work, not only in the city, but in visiting-
societies throughout the State. In 1897
he was elected President of the Evangelical
Council —a year memorable to the public be-
cause of the newspaper controversy carried
on by Father Masterton, S.J., and the
Council, on the ethics of equivocation and
mental reservation, which the Jesuit sought
to defend.
In the Sydney Town Hall on the 6th of
April, 1904, a packed house assembled to
do honour to the champion of Protestant-
ism, by presenting him with a purse of sov-
ereigns, and a beautifully illuminated address
in book form, bound in morocco. On the
first page of the address there is a splen-
didly executed painting in water colours of
William crossing the Boyne. The address
is as follows:

Rev. and Dear Sir
and Bro., —We, the
members of the vari-

A.P.D.A., and Lodges
of the L.O.L. in this
State, desire to mark
our sense of the unsel-
fish devotion, untiring-
zeal, and splendid ser-
vice rendered to Pro-
testanism by your
able and fearless advocacy of the cause of
Civil and Religious Liberty for several years
past.
As our leader in that cause you have at
great personal risk raised the banner of
Protestantism in many places when others
feared to raise it, and by your able lectures
and courageous championship won our ad-
miration, esteem, and love.
We therfore ask your acceptance of the
accompanying purse of sovereigns as a
slight expression of your splendid leader-
ship, and pray that you may be long spared
to fight our Lord’s battles in this Common-
wealth. —

Dr. Dill Macky attained his majority this
year as the pastor of Scots’ Church, and yet
he seems to be as full of vigour and ability
to labour to-day as he ever was. We be-
lieve that there is not another man in Syd-
ney, or indeed, in the Commonwealth, who
responds to so many invitations to preach,
lecture, and deliver platform addresses as
the worthy Doctor, and we are sure we
voice the feelings of the multitude of his
admirers throughout, and beyond, the Com-
monwealth, when we say—“ May his bow
long abide in strength.”

men in the community is Dr. Dill Macky.”
—The Rev. W. Woolls Rutledge.
“The great asset of the State, the chil-
dren, would rise up, he believed, and call
Dr. Macky blessed for the work he had

“I rejoice in the knowledge I have of Dr.
Macky. We have been comrades in many
a well-fought battle, and live in expectation
of many a fight yet to be fought. We ought
to pass a vote of thanks to old Ireland for
sending Dr. Macky to Australia.”—Rev. P.
J. Stephen.
“He was glad to testify of what Dr. Macky
had done for Protestantism. In the demon-
strations on the recent Empire Day, he felt
they could hear Dr. Macky’s voice. They
were told that 2,000,000 children sainted
the flag, and the heartiness in their cheer-
ing was largely because of the influence of
Dr. Macky’s work. To know Dr. Macky
was to love him. He liked his courage and
straightforwardness, and though he spoke
out straight, there was not a touch of malice
in him.” —The Rev. W. Ash, M.A.
“He distinctly remembered the thrill of
pleasure that come to him years ago when
he was introduced to such a leader and
standard-bearer among them as Dr. Macky.
Going about among the people of his pai'ish
he had found that the love and admiration
which the Doctor had won among his par-
ishioners was something any man might be
proud of. They honoured and glorified God
for his work among the sick, the fatherless,
and the widow. They needed men like the
Doctor to stir people up and bear witness to
the truth. He was honestly proud to be
able to join in the congratulations, and bear
testimony to the influence of Dr. Macky and
the Scots’ Church. The Doctor would be
able to say to the Captain of his salvation
what the dying soldier on the field of battle
had said to his officer, T have led them
straight.’ ” —Canon Bellingham.

“I am in cordial agreement with the pro-
posal, for Dr. Macky has well earned such
a trip, and the benefit which the rest and
change will bring to him, and especially has
he deserved such a recognition from the
friends of Protestantism. I have much
pleasure in enclosing my cheque for £1 Is

P.M., Hon. Sec. No. 62, L.O.L, Vic.
“He is a grand Protestant. I have his
photo hanging up in my office.” —William
Nelson, Alexandra, Vic.
“We have a small lodge here, and not
much money. We would have liked to have
sent twenty-four pounds, instead of as many
shillings, for the great Australian champion
of Protestantism.” —Charles Wynne, Sec.
No. 40, L.O.L.

“Great pleasure was expressed at our
meeting last week at the large figure your
list had reached, and a hope voiced that the
subscriptions would continue to flow in.” —
(Miss) Ida Robb, Treasurer, Ladies’ Lodge,
No. 361, Kiama.
❖ ❖
One subscriber from the country 'writes
of his district: —“This is the Tipperary of
Australia, and a hell upon earth for such
as I.”
* * ❖
“I feel proud that there are so many who
are not ashamed to honour their champion.”
—William Marshall, Nangus, via Gundagai.
* * *
“We have much pleasure in enclosing
cheque towards the movement. With Car-
dinal Moran at the head of Roman Catholi-
cism in this State, we need a militant cleric
to expose that duplicity and those shams in
which the Cardinal is such a past-master.
We hope Dr. Dill Macky may live long to
protest with all the fervour of his nature
against the wiles of this Roman prelate, and
we hope he will come back again rejuven-
ated by his trip, again ready to uphold, as
he has so worthily upheld, the banner of
Protestantism.” —A Subscriber.
“I enclose my mite towards the ‘G.O.M.’
testimonial, and hope you will succeed in
getting a good sum, for he well deserves it.”
H. C. Cook, Bondi.
❖ ❖
“I am pleased to see the list filling up—
a noble object for a worthy cause. I hope


the good Doctor and Mrs. Dill Macky will
be blessed in their journey to the Home-
land, and safely return to the Common-
wealth.” — Robert Rutherford, Slowport,
Tasmania.
❖ ❖
“I only trust that the testimonial may be
in a small degree worthy of him whom you
seek thus to honour.” —Rev. Victor Clark-
Duff, 8.A., Cessnock.
❖ ❖ ❖
“Every Protestant worthy of the name
should consider it a privilege to contribute
towards such a worthy cause.” —Allan Liv-
ingstone, Grafton.
Sfc ❖
“This is an opportunity Protestants should
not miss in showing their appreciation of
the self-sacrificing efforts made on behalf of
our Protestant faith by our worthy cham-
pion.”—John Robertson, Coolangatta.
❖ ❖ ❖
“We shall miss the Doctor greatly while
he is away, and I hope he will be spared
to return to us, and to carry on the fight
for Protestantism with renewed vigour.”—
Geo. Ha slam. Orange.
“I esteem it a privilege to be able to take
part in the testimonial to the Rev. Dr. Dill
Macky, and enclose cheque value one
guinea.”—J. Marshall.
* *
“I beg to acknowledge the great and valu-
able services of our esteemed friend and
champion, Dr. Dill Macky, and herewith en-
close cheque for one guinea towards his
testimonial, and wish him a happy, well-
earned rest. May God bless his future la-
bours.” —George Boulton.
“I hope he won’t be long absent from Aus-
tralia, as he has few equals in this conti-
nent. If Protestants won’t wake up at our
elections, this grand country will in the
near future be as had as Ireland, which,
owing to a weak Government, I fear is now
doomed to be again governed by Popish
priests.” —John Makim.
* ❖
“As an old friend of Dr. Dill Macky I
have much pleasure in forwarding one
guinea toward the good object.”—Rev. A.
McClinchie, Culcairn.
“I do hope that Protestants throughout
the Commonwealth will bestir themselves
and do their duty towards our champion of
the cause we espouse, love and maintain.
‘Long live Dr. Dill Macky,’ is the prayer of
his Queenstown (Tas.) brethren.” —J. E.
Kingsley.
* *
“This trifling sum only slightly represents
the feeling of admiration I have ever had
for the courage, heroism, and loyalty of our
grand champion of the Protestant faith.
We cordially unite with hundreds of good
people that our esteemed brother may long
be spared in the Master’s service, and that
strength may be given him to grapple with
the dire evils of the Popish system —‘A
Curse to the Church, a Menace to the Na-
tion.’ Kindly convey to Dr. and Mrs. Dill
Macky our very best wishes that they may
have a pleasant voyage, a prosperous career
(in the best sense of the term) in the old
country, and a safe return to the land of
their adoption. May the Angel of the Cov-
enant go before them, guiding and guarding
them aright.”—M. A. Moore (an old Fiji
Missionary’s widow).
“Dr. Dill Macky, a brother whom every
true Orangeman here holds in very high
rank as the champion of Protestantism. We
trust his trip to the old land will be bene-
ficial to his health, and that he will return
determined to do more and more for the
noble Order of Orangeism. All brethren
here sends frateimal greetings, and wish
him the height of good luck and prosperity
for a safe return.” —A. Mitchell, Rookwood
State Hospital.
❖ *
“My lodge wishes the Doctor an enjoyable
trip, and trusts that he may be able to open
the eyes of our people in the old land, and
that he will return to Australia with re-
newed vigour, to lead us on to victory.” —
Fred. G. Palethorpe, Secretary No. 33, Too-
woomba United.
❖ ❖
“Am highly delighted with the success of
the movement. The dear Doctor de-
serves all that is being done for him, and
a very great deal more. I most sincerely
hope and pray that God’s richest blessing-
may he with him always, and that he and
Mrs. Macky may have a most enjoyable and
healthful trip, and return to us safely.” —W.
G. Evans, Gunnedah.
