MEMS. FOR THE MONTHS.
January.— On New Year’s day the midsummer race
meeting takes place on the Flemington Course, the principal
item being the two year old stakes. There are, also, plenty
of other sports afoot to celebrate the New Year which in
Australia is held to. be the holiday of holidays for general
fin J°y m ent. As it is difficult to keep cool and comfortable
on the mainland during the month of January we advise
all who can make it convenient to run down south to
Tasmania, or away to the Southern parts of New Zealand
Nearer home there are the Islands in Western Port Bay
Cowes, the capital of Phillip Island, possesses two hotels
and there appears to be plenty of accommodation in that
direction from Melbourne. Recent circumstances make
the following paragraph appropriate to this season:—
Our ‘Dear Hotel-Keepers. —Mr. Punch, the great
Reformer of Hotels has still work before him in that direc-
tion and he means to do it. Shall he not take his ease in
his Inn, without fear of the bill ? Liberal, nay, handsome
remuneration he is ever prompt to render to his Host for
a comfortable hotel is an admirable institution and to
know that one can walk into it at any hour of the day or
night is much. But gold may be bought too dear, and so
may comfort. In the interest of the Public, which he is
sworn to protect, he means on all occasions to speak out
when an Inn becomes inhospitable.” The game of cricket
is at its height.
February. We repeat our January remark—go
down south, if possible, or camp out in Fern Tree Gullv
or elsewhere In selecting a spot for the tent, see that it
is sheltered from the wind, and that the ground is sufficiently
elevated and sipping to be clear of water ; in fixing it, mind
tle pegs are driven home. We suggest to some enter-
prising proprietor of Livery Stables in Melbourne to have
for lure a few waggonettes with covers, suitable for small
parties of excursionists camping out for a night or two and
requiring to sleep in and about a conveyance. At the
present time vehicles of the right kind cannot be hired at

PREFACE.
“ Dum Vivimus Vivcunus.” Whilst we live let us
live is the best of the wisdom of the ancients. It
is agreed now that we do not know so much more
than they did. We begin to perceive that we should
work to live, and not live to work. The farmer who
takes continual crops out of his fields, never letting
them lie fallow, impoverishes and destroys the soil.
We do the same —we of the all work and no play
school. Life will be gone e’er we have lived. The
eight hours’ revolution in our social state will be of
little use to us unless we learn how well to occupy
the sixteen balance.
This Guide to Recreations and Calender for 1874
is the only publication of the kind issued at Mel-
bourne. To those who have assisted its production
the publisher tenders his grateful thanks. He hopes
that its patrons who may, while using the book,
detect any errors or omissions which they can correct
from personal knowledge, will have the kindness to
note them down, with the date at which they were
made, on the blank pages in the book, which can
then be torn out and forwarded to the office of the
Guide, 75 Chancery Lane, Melbourne. This will help
to make the little Annual more useful as it grows
older.

any stables in Melbourne. The Fern Tree Gully is situated
in the Dandenong Ranges, distant about 21 miles from
Melbourne. The route is along the St. Kilda Road to the
Junction, then turn to the left, along the Dandenong
Road to Oakleigh, and there take the road which branches
to the left of the Turnpike Gate. This far, the way cannot
be mistaken. Between Oakleigh and the Ranges there is a
half-way house, called “The Cheshire Cheese:” inquire
there about the one turning where there is a possibility of
going wrong. The road is very good for half the distance,
the other part may be considered as tolerable.
March. —During this month the Autumn Race Meet-
ing takes place, which includes the very notable contest for
the Australian Cup. Still we say go down south. Sea sick-
ness need not be suffered now. Several of the surgeons
and passengers of the Cunard line, and many surgeons and
passengers of other ships sailing round the world, say that
a cure for sea sickness has been discovered at last by Dr.
Chapman, of London, who has published the handbook of
the remedy in a convenient form, particulars of which can
be had at the office of this guide book. Those who cannot
manage to travel further should certainly use the Bay.
Sailing boats or yachts can be had for fishing parties or
excursion trips to Queenscliff, Schnapper Point, Indented
Heads, or any other point of attraction on the bay, at
moderate charges,—about five shillings per hour, or two
pounds per day. These boats are owned by the watermen
of Hobson’s Bay plying from the various piers, but princip-
ally from the H. B. Railway pier. The yachts are partly
decked over, so that parties remaining out all night may
“turn in” somehow. For fine weather, there is also an
assortment of rowing skiffs, suitable for parties visiting
vessels in the bay, or out for an airing ; the charges for
use of which are also moderate. The Autumn season com-
mences on the 20th.
April. —The Melbourne Annual Regatta comes off at
Easter which occurs in this month. It takes place on the
Upper Yarra, the course being from Prince’s bridge to the
Botanical gardens bridge—a distance of about a mile and a
quarter. At this time the Rowing Season may be said to
be at its height. The exercise is practised (when the flooded
state of the Yarra does not interfere) throughout the year.
The paths by the river between Prince’s Bridge and Botanic
Gardens Bridge are the best approaches to the Botanic
Gardens from Melbourne. The South path is probably


preferred at present, owing to its being shaded by trees, j
especially near Brander’s half-way ferry-house, where
refreshments are sold in seated arbors. But when the
newly-planted trees by the North path grow tall enough t
afford shade, that will assuredly become the preferred path
on account of the carriage drive, which is generally spoken
of as our future “ Rotten Row,” running parallel with the
footpath.
May —The game of football comes into fashion and
cricket goes out. The football season may be said to com-
mence in May and end in September. The Hunting season
commences at the end of this month or early in June and
terminates in October. In Victoria no such a thing as a
jumpable brook is ever seen in hunting. All natural water-
ways short of rivers and larger than mere drains have, from
the dryness of the summer season, such rotten banks, or
have their banks so undermined by the winter floods, as to
render any attempt to jump them highly dangerous ; and,
as they can usually be avoided by a divergence an attempt
to jump them is seldom, if ever, made. With regard to
post and rail fences, we would advise every one to ride
steadily at them until he knows his horse well, unless, in-
deed such fence be backed up with a ditch of any width
in which case the rider must take all risk and ride fast that
his horse may land clear of the ditch. A log fence or brush
fence almost every horse which will jump at all will jump
well and the rider may please himself as to the pace at
which he will approach it. Never be in too great a hurry
to begin : ride patiently and carefully until you find out
your horses’ tempers and powers, always remembering that
an apparently very slight risk may easily result in a very
serious accident.
June.— On the 14th of this month the shooting season
closes as regards three species, viz., emus, black swans and
geese, because these breed early. On the first Wednesday
in June the entries are made for the Melbourne Cup of the
year, and for the Ascot Vale, Derby and Oaks of the follow-
ing year. The Winter season commences on the 21 na
which is the shortest day of the year.
July commences with a holiday to celebrate the separa-
tion of the Colony of Victoria from New South Wales, and
with it ends the Victorian Shooting season. The peace
lasts till the 20tli of December.

month° V ember.— Bream fishing commences with this
month The angler in the early part of the season will
generally get very good sport in the Saltwater river from
in% J !Tf 10n Wlt l i he Yarra up as far as Raleigh’s Punt and
in fact for some distance beyond; but later say in March
and April, the higher up he goes the more likely lie is to
find sport, for the fish are well up the river, and may be

tween Gellibrand s Point and Point Cook. These are the
nnmh aces ’i but + flsh be cau S bt > although not in such
numbers, almost anywhere in the bay at half a mile’s dis-
furom u r0m the sh ? re ‘ ~T he best s Port is to be had with

Hve k « f° r i b . ey , ar ! V , ery powerful Ash in the water, aiid
g good deal of play. To enjoy the sport more fully
many gentlemen fish with a stiff rod about six feet long’


and a large Nottingham reel capable of holding about 50
yards of stout cord line. With these appliances, this fish
will give nearly as good sport as a salmon.
December is made memorable by the Shooting season
commencing on the 20th. A specially interesting event.
Shooting in Victoria, (we mean, of course, shooting
"game”) is regulated by the provisions of the “Fisheries
and Game Statute of 1864,” and the various proclamations
of the Governor in Council issued under it. The “ first
day of the season” is the 20th of December, and from that
day to the 14th of June wild ducks of any species, teal,
bittern, emu, native companions, wild turkey or bustard,
black swans, wild geese, wild pigeons, mallee hen, and all
species of quail may be bagged by the ardent sportsman.
The season then closes as regards three species, viz. :
emus, black swans, and geese. These breed early, and
we doubt whether ducks should not also be included with
them for a similar reason. However, as the law stands at
present, all other kinds of “ native game other than those
three are subject to continued danger to the Ist August.
Upon that date commences the Victorian “ close season,”
which terminates, as we have said above, on the 20th
December. The lover of the double-barrel need not how-
ever be utterly idle in the interim. Snipe, being migratory
birds, visitors only to the colony during a few of the spring
and early summer months, have not been included in the
game list, and arrive very handily to keep the sportsman’s
hand in at period when he would otherwise be apt to
grow—like his gun— a trifle “ rusty.” The Summer sea-
son commences on the 22nd, the longest day.

RECREATIONS.
Hunting in Victoria. —In a work like the present, any
eulogy of or general disquisition upon hunting either viewing it
as a science or as an athletic sport, would be out of place ;
because as the main object of this work is to afford to the tourist
and pleasure-seeker a means of ascertaining, amongst other things,
what kinds of sport exist in this country, and where they may be
had, it would be a mere waste of space to deal in generalities
whose only advantage would be to commend the sport or exercise
to persons not previously acquainted with its nature and its
merits. Moreover, it may be reasonably inferred that any excur-
sionist or tourist arriving from the old country would not desire
to commence hunting in this colony, where it is less perfect and
is attended with much more risk and difficulty than in Great
Britain, if he had not already learned something about it in that
more favored region, in which case he would not need to be
stimulated by a dilation upon the delights of the sport, as if he
were altogether ignorant of them. Hunting in Victoria divides
itself into three classes, —(1) kangaroo hunting with kangaroo
dogs, (2) kangaroo hunting with fox-hounds, and (3) hunting a
variety of animals with fox-hounds. In Victoria no such thing
as a jumpable brook is ever seen in hunting. All natural water-
ways short of rivers and larger than mere drains have from the
dryness of the summer season, such rotten banks, or have their
banks so undermined by the winter floods, as to render any
attempt to jump them highly dangerous ; and as they can usually
be avoided by a divergence, an attempt to jump them is seldom,
if ever, made. Stone walls are often backed up by deep ditches ;
therefore it is advisable, as a rule, to ride fast at them, in order
to avoid dropping into the ditch which might result in a broken
back. With regard to post and rail fences, we would advise
every one to ride steadily at them until he knows his horse


well, unless indeed such fence be backed up with a ditch of any
width, in which case the rider must take all risk and ride fast
that his horse may land clear of the ditch. A log fence or brush
fence almost every horse which will jump at all will jump well,
and the rider may please himself as to the pace at which he will
approach it. In conclusion, we give this piece of advice to all
who consult our pages,—never be in too great a hurry to begin ;
ride patiently and carefully until you find out your horses’ tempers
and powers, always remembering that an apparently very slight
risk may easily result in a very serious accident. The meets of
the various packs of hounds throughout the colony are advertised
each week in the weekly papers which are published every Satur-
day morning, and in the columns of which accounts of the
preceding Saturday’s run with each pack also appear, with all the
other sporting information of the week.
Racing.— -It is generally admitted that every properly
constituted Briton takes an interest in horse racing, and without
doubt, we in Victoria are in no way behind our countrymen in
any part of the world in our admiration of the noble sport. The
principal race in the colony (we may say, indeed, in the southern
hemisphere) is the Melbourne Cup, which creates as much
excitement with us, as the Derby does in the old country. At
the commencement of June the entries are to be made for the
Melbourne Cup of the year, and for the Ascot Vale, Derby, and
Oaks of the following year. The Spring Meeting (during which
the Melbourne Cup and Derby are run for) takes place at the
end of October ; the Midsummer Meeting on the first of January;
and the Autumn Meeting in March. The principal racing
institution in the colony is the Victoria Racing Club, the annual
subscription to which is £5, payable on the Ist of August; but
members elected between the Spring and Autumn Meetings are
required to pay only one-half the annual subscription for the
current year. The Race Course is situated at Flemington, four
miles from Melbourne, near the Salt-water River. It is an
irregular oval, one mile and a half in circumference, left handed,
and almost as level as a billiard table. There is a commodious
grand stand, capable of holding 1500 people. The hill reserve
behind the grand stand, (to which an admission of two shillings
is charged) affords a splendid view over the whole course and
accommodates over 40,000 spectators. The annual subscription
to the Victorian subscription betting room is two guineas. Dur-
ing the race meetings, cabs and trains start for the course every
few minutes, at reasonable fares.
Shooting in Victoria (we mean of course, shooting
“game ”) is regulated by the provisions of the “Fisheries and


Game Statute of 1864,” and the various proclamations of the
Governor in Councilissued under it. The “ first day ° f the j
season ” is the 20th of December, and from that day to the 14th
June wild ducKS of any species, teal, bittern, emu native com-
panions, wild turkey or bustard, black swans, wild geese, wild
pigeons, mallee hen, and all species of quail may be bagged by
the ardent sportsman. The season then closes as regards three
species, viz. emus, black swans, and geese. These breed early,
and we doubt whether ducks should not also be included with them
for a similar reason. However, as the law stands at present, an
other kinds of “ native game ” other than those three are subject
to continued danger to the Ist August. Upon that date com-
mences the Victorian “ close season,” which terminates as we have
said above, on the 20th December ; quail are however protected
until the 3lst of January under the new act. The low of the
double-barrel need not however be utterly idle in the mtenm.
Snipe, being migratory birds, visitors only to the colony duvi g
a few of the spring and early summer months have not been
included in the game list, and arrive very usefully to keep the
sportsman’s haul in at a period when he would otherwise be apt
t o g row —like his gun—a trifle “ rusty. The penalty for killing
native game out of season is £2 in addition to a sum of ss. per
head ; and the penalty for either selling or “ knowingly having
in possession” native game, £5, in addition to a sum of £2 per
head • while the taking, destroying, or possession of eggs subjects
the offender to a penalty of 10s. per egg. Imported game is
protected also by stringent penalties. The killing of it subjects,
in the first place, the offender to a general fine of £2, m addition
to which he is mulcted in a sum per head, according to the
following scale : —Pheasants, partridge, grouse, hares, and swans,
£5 ; deer, and antelope, £ls ; all other birds not indigenous to
Australia and their produce, £l. Shooting generally cannot
be said to flourish satisfactorily in Victoria. Acclimatising game
lias proceeded very slowly hitherto, only those pests the rabbits
.(which by the bye are not game) having thoroughly succeeded,
although the deer are gradually and surely multiplying in the
Lilydale, Wimmera, and other ranges. If the sportsman cares
for rabbit-shooting he can be accommodated with it ad lib ovei a
very large area of the Western District, and m many parts there
will be received, even if unknown, with welcome arms, to such an
extent are the “ bunnies ” feared and detested. Quail are generally
to be found, in the season, in the neighborhood of cultivated and
well-grassed regions not too much disturbed. Snipe are pre-
carious—here one day, gone to-morrow. Ducks are to be found
almost everywhere throughout the colony. The neighborhoods of
Dandenong, Cranbourne, Mordialloc, &c., are perhaps the best
viz., the range of a day’s drive from the city of Melbourne—for


an “ out” with the gun, but if the shooter can spare a week, or
two let him wend his way to Gipps Land, or the Western District,
or French Island in the Western Port Bay, and the chances are
he will get a fair bag of something.
Abstract of the Game Acts of Victoria. —The act
passed September 6, 1867, divides “ game” into two classes, or
schedules—“ game,” and “ native game.” Under the former
heading are pheasants, £5 ; partridges, £5 ; grouse, £5 ; hares,
£5 ; deer, £ls ; white swans, £5 ; antelopes, £ls ; all birds
not indigenous to Australia and their produce, £l. Under the
second schedule are wild duck of any species, teal, bittern, emu,
native companions, wild turkey or bustard, black swans, wild
geese, bronzewing, and other wild pigeons, mallee hen, quail.
The penalty for killing any game mentioned in the first schedule,
at any time, is the sum affixed to each in the list—with the
exception, now, of hares, which, by an act passed 17th December,
1872, are withdrawn from the act of 1867. The following are
the clauses in it “1. This act shall be called and may be
cited as the ‘ Amended Game Act 1872.’ 2. That from and
after the passing of this act the owner or occupier of any land
may at any time kill or destroy hares being on the land owned or
occupied by him ; and may grant permission to any person with
dogs to enter in and upon such lands and kill or destroy hares
thereon. 3. If any person shall wilfully trespass on any land
not being Crown land in search or pursuit of game, on complaint
of the owner or occupier of such land, and on conviction before
any two justices, he shall forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding
ten pounds; and having in his possession implements for shooting,
or being accompanied by dogs, shall be prima facie evidence of
the purpose of such trespass.” With regard to the native game
under schedule 2, the close season commences on August 1 of
each year, and ends on December 20, with the exception of quail,
which are now protected until the 31st of January, the close
season having been lately extended to that time by the Governor
in Council. By a proclamation dated 29th June, 1868, the close
season for emus, black swans, and all kinds, of geese, was altered
so as to commence on the 14th of June of each year, ending on
the 20th of December. By an act passed on the 23rd of November,
1871, sparrows and minahs were taken out of the Game Act,
and it is lawful now for any one to destroy those birds at any
time. It will be seen from the above that snipes and landrails
are not protected, and may be shot at any time.
Bat Fishing.—Considering the noble bay which we have,
abounding as it does with a great variety of fish, from the delicate


whitebait to the voracious shark of a dozen feet in length, it is
not to be wondered at that deep-sea fishing has become a tavonte
amusement with us. On a fine day, dozens of boats may be
observed drifting with the tide, like waifs on old Father Neptune s
glassy bosom, or anchored over some well-known reef or sand bank,
Many persons prefer this sort of fishing to angling, because the
excitement is much greater, and there is likewise a spice of danger
attending it, which is enough of itself to prove an inducement to
some daring spirits, for the bay is subject to sudden squalls, which
raise a nasty lumpy sea in a very short time. For this reason,
it is very unwise for persons to attempt bay fishing without having
an experienced boatman to accompany them. Many valuable
lives have been lost for want of taking this precaution. A person
may be able to manage a boat pretty well on the river, but it is a
very different thing to have to contend with a south-westerly
“buster” two or three miles from shore. Besides, it must add
materially to the pleasure where there is no responsibility, for the
loss or damage of an oar or sail would be a considerable additional
item to the expenditure of the day. So, all things considered, it
is always best to have a sailing-master. To enjoy this sort of
fishing, you must be no lie-a-bed ; you should be up an hour
before sunrise, so as to be able to be on the fishing-ground as
soon as old Phoebus shows his fiery nose above the horizon. The
early sail may make you feel chilly ; but the chances are ten to one
that five minutes after you commence fishing you will have for-
gotten that, especially if you happen to get hold of a good lump
of a schnapper or dog-fish.
Barracoota Fishing— Sea Fishing.—We were between
the Heads and the chain of islands which stretched from Australia
to Tasmania, the beacon peaks of a submerged mountain chain.
At one time it would be Wilson’s Promontory, a bold, rugged
headland, with not a sign of vegetation on the surface of its bare,
parti-colored granite, against which its white lighthouse stands
out with singular distinctness. Five or six miles off is the
Rodondo, a conical-shaped mound, 1200 feet high ; then there is
Curtis Isle, called by sailors “ the slipper,” from its configuration;
Judgment Rock, described by its name ; the Devil’s Tower,
small but conspicuous ; Hogan’s Islands, where wild dogs are
found ; and the Kent group, on the highest peak of which a
lighthouse is perched, twinkling like a star in the firmament.
The seabirds build in myriads on these islands, but what is more
to be wondered at is, that they are infested with snakes. If an
editor wishes some novelties in the way of snake stories let him
catch one of the adventurous spirits—and they are to be met
with —who have passed a summer in these localities. Then not
a watch passed without some new vessel sailing by, inward


bound, or joining us company on the outward voyage for a
short season, and it was amusing to note how the sailors
could pick out the “ Salem,” the “ Lady Emma,” or the
“ Sword-fish,” afar off, by some patch in the fore-sail, or
some cut of the jib ; and how they had the full, true, and
particular account of the ownership, qualities, and adven-
tures of each at their tongues’ end. But the great amuse-
ment, morning and afternoon, especially just before and
after sunrise and sunset, was Barracoota fishing. This was
a novelty to me, and a very enjoyable one, for there were
really any quantity of fish to be caught. A long line is
hove overboard, with a round piece of wood about three
inches long strung to one end immediately above a stout,
unbaited hook. The fish rise to the wood and hook them-
selves tight and fast. At convenient times and places, and
especially when the vessel is making her four or five knots
per hour they bite freely. Two of us hooked as many
dozen in the hour, fine, fat gentry scarcely one of which
was less than three feet and a half long. “ Better sport than
the Upper Yarra, my boy,” ejaculates the skipper on the
weather quarter, as he secures a good one. “No need of a
microscope here,” responded I, lifting a long three-footer
over the lee, and gleefully thinking of the unfortunate
frequenters of the colonial streams, who though ostensible
anglers, are really, nine cases out of ten, chasers of the wild
goose. The barracoota may not be a first-class table fish,
eaten fresh ; but dipped in a bucket of brine, and dried in
the sun, it keeps for weeks, and in that condition is an
article of diet not to be despised. East of Wilson’s Promon-
tory, the barracoota is never met with until it reappears
on the New Zealand coast. Several times during these days
the vessel was surrounded with shoals of fish about the size
of a mullet. The appearance of these shoals is very
singular. The surface of the sea is agitated like a boiling
cauldron, and the disturbance travels along the surface with
a noise like a hailstorm sweeping over the waters, the noise
being due, net only to the fish, but to the thousands of
birds which hover over, settle upon, and dive into the water
in quest of their finny prey. Birds and fish took such little
notice of the schooner as she lay idle on the water, that
they would come close enough for us to drop a biscuit
amongst them.
Angling Round Melbourne. —The most favorite re-
sorts of the angler located in Melbourne and the suburbs
are the Saltwater River and the Lower Yarra. In the
Saltwater River, fish may be caught for about eight months


out of the twelve, and in the Lower Yarra for about six.
There are only two sorts of fish in these rivers, which are
worthy the angler’s attention—the bream and mullet, ine
first is by far the best, as it not only yields more sport, but
is also a better fish for the table, when in season, hor
bream, the best places very much depend upon the time or
year. The angler in the early part of the season will
generally get very good sport in the Saltwater River, trom
its junction with the Yarra up as far as Raleigh s Punt and
in fact for some distance beyond ; but later, say in Marc
and April, the higher up he goes the more likely he is t
find sport, for the fish are well up the river, and may be
sought for with advantage as high as Solomon s Ford, ibe
next place in importance as a bream stream is the Werrib ,
which is crossed by the railway about half way between
Melbourne and Geelong. The Werribee is a tidal river up to
within a short distance of the station bearing its name, ana
consequently bream maybe caught within an easy distance
of that point; but if the angler desires really good sport
he must follow the river down for at least a couple ot miles.
The tyro intending to try the Werribee would do well to
apply to Mr. Streat, the landlord of the Camp Hotel, near
the station, who for a small consideration will drive him
down to the best part of the river. To a person who has
plenty of time on his hands, the Werribee is the best place
to go to : for he has not only a complete change of air, but
a chance of first-rate sport. If blackfish are preferred to
bream, they can be got in any number, and of good size,
about a couple of miles above the railway.
The Art op Velocipede Management. —As in most
other accomplishments, practice alone can make a skill u
rider of velocipedes. The tyro can, however, profit by the
experience of others, and I give a few rules for his guidance
as well as directions for his practice. The first point is to
gain confidence in, and familiarity with, his wheel horse.
If he has but recently purchased one, he should walk by its
side guiding it by the handle until he knows its movements
thoroughly. He will see that it obeys, almost like a “ thing
of life,” the slightest movement of the handle, and follows
the driving-wheel in all its tortuous movements. The
second step of progress is to gain and keep the balance
when astride on the saddle. This is apparently a very diffi-
cult feat to accomplish, but really it is not so. . After sit-
ting for a few minutes in the velocipede, with the toes
touching the ground, the vehicle may be placed on a slight
incline, so that it may run down of its own accord. The


handle must be gripped firmly and steadily, and the feet
just lifted from the ground. If there is a disposition to
swerve either to the right or left, in consequence of the in-
clination of the body disturbing the equilibrium, a slight
alteration of the pressure on the handle will restore the lost
balance. In the riding-schools it is usual for the assistant
to steady the velocipede in the earlier lessons ; but, like
learning to swim on corks it is far better to dispense with
this extraneous aid, so that the rider may study the action
of the machine himself. He will find the sensation peculiar
at first, but a slight practice will habituate him to it. At
first he will wish the handles were firmer, for each nervous
twist that he gives it as the machine moves is calculated
either to upset his balance or to turn the vehicle out of a
straight line. A few runs down an incline will pave the
way for the first real lesson on self-propulsion. At first, it
will be better to lift each leg alternately, so that they may
follow the movement of the pedal without exerting any
force. This will habituate the knees and feet to the move-
ment. It is during this practice that the arm of a friend
or the ready hand of a skilled assistant is valuable, as there
is always a disposition to press too hardly on the pedal. It
does not require the strength of an elephant to turn the
driving-wheel, even on the roughest road ; and in these pre-
liminary trials it is quite unnecessary. Should there be
any danger of falling, take the foot off the pedal on the
side and rest it on the ground, and commence afresh. It
is by no means uncommon for the learner to be able to run
a distance of fifty or sixty yards after a few hours’ practice.
To alight it is only necessary to apply the brake by turning
the handle. To slacken the speed, release the feet from the
pedals and place them simultaneously on the ground. In
all the earlier essays choose some unfrequented road for
practice, and avoid as far as possible a crowded street.
Practise at first down hill; the use of the brake will at all
times prevent excessive speed. Beware of advancing
vehicles and abrupt crossings of roads. Do not ride on the
footpaths ! When practice has given a tolerable command
over the vehicle (and a young, active man will acquire that
command in a fortnight’s practice of a couple of hours a
day), the legs may be elevated to the rest when the veloci-
pede descends a hill, so that it may run free. The right leg
is raised on the cross rest beneath the angle, whilst the
hands firmly grasp the handle. A slight effort will raise
the left leg to the other side of the rest. The velocipede

Bowling.— The game of Bowls
is indulged in principally by gentlemen whose years or form
renders it inconvenient and undesirable for them to ]om
in the more athletic and active amusements of cricket and
football. This game is played generally between the mont
of October and May, but upontwoorthreeof the greens
around Melbourne it may be played throughout the yea
pnnspouence of some clubs possessing a second orsuppie
mentary plot which may be used during the time that the
usual or “Match” one is undergoing its annual renovation.
Thp nrincinal Bowling Clubs in Victoria are those of the
pSe.llt "oy fthe West MdtoorK B.owl“§


Station, and the other in the Bridge Road. Books of rules
and every information regarding entrance fees and sub-
scriptions may be obtained by applying to the secretary of
either club at the address given above. This game is be-
coming a very favorite one in Victoria and every year new
clubs are being formed so that before long every borough
wdl have its Bowling Green. Inter-club matches are
played every season and considerable interest is manifested
“ r ,l sult of these friendly trials of skill. At present
the Melbourne B. C. is the premier one of the colony
Each club is governed by a President, Vice-President,
Secretary, Treasurer, and Committee. On a fine summer’s
evening a Bowling Green is a fashionable place of resort
The refreshing verdure after the heat and dust of the day
is grateful to the eye and as each member is at liberty to
introduce a friend we would strongly advise the visitor
from the adjacent colonies to avail himself of the oppor-
tunity. The Greens are open to the public after 3 p.m.
Boating on the Yarra. —Boats for hire may be pro-
cured at Prince’s Bridge from Edwards, Puller, or Green-
land. The two former have each an establishment on the
north bank of the Yarra immediately above the Bridge, and
Greenland’s Wharf is posted on the south bank below the
Bridge. Prom either “pleasure” boats may be had ; by
this term we style those heavier and safer boats adapted
rather for conveying people for recreation than for racing.
The above-mentioned boat proprietors have also sheds on
the south bank, in which are housed the more delicate and
rapid craft in which the proficient oarsman delights. Their
charges are : —for sculling boats or canoes, one shilling per
hour; pair-oared boats, one shilling and sixpence ; and
four-oared gigs, two shillings. Por half a day, or a whole
day, the price is considerably reduced, ten shillings being
sufficient to hire the largest boat for a whole day except,
perhaps, on Christmas and other holidays. On these terms
you get the boat and instruments without the propelling
power; if you want to hire the latter you can arrange
either with one of the above-mentioned proprietors, or with
one of the watermen who bank their boats just above
Edwards’s ; terms according to agreement. There is one
charge, however, made by the watermen which may be con-
sidered as fixed, and that is sixpence a-head to or from the
Botanic Garden’s stairs. Pleasure boats may also be hired
at Brander’s Perry ; and at Richmond Punt, from Green-
land, Burn, or the punt-man, Gardiner. The sheds at


Prince’s Bridge, besides housing the boats for the general
public, are used for the building and repairing of boats, and
accommodation of those belonging to the various clubs, and
contain dressing and bath rooms for the members.
Walking. —Exercise is indispensable to the physical
well-being of man, and walking is one of the most useful of
the various modes of exercise. As a people we ride too much
and walk too little. If we are in the country, and have a
mile or two to go, we wait —perhaps long enough to walk
the entire distance—for a horse to be got ready, and then
sit lazily in our seats while this noble animal rapidly carries
us to our destination. If we are in the city, and have a
short distance to go, we get into an omnibus or a car
and sit our journey out, just as though we were not created
with legs the same as horses are. The nation’s legs are
rapidly diminishing in size for the want of exercise, hence
the demand for false calves and for easier modes of loco-
motion is on the increase: so, also, is dyspepsia, liver
complaint, general debility, and other physical derange-
ments, which result in great part at least, from a lack of
muscular action. The advantages of walking, as an exercise,
are many. Perhaps the most important is that it takes us
out of doors, and keeps us there in the pure air and the
bright sunshine. The exercise, which is gentle and pro-
longed, increases not only in the frequency but fulness of
respiration, thus bringing a much larger quantity of oxy-
gen into the lungs, and through them, to the blood, thereby
giving the finishing touch to the process of digestion and
vitalizing “ the red current of life.” Another advantage
to respiration is this :—when a person is sitting or standing
still, the exhaled air from the lungs, which is unfit to be
breathed again, fills the space about the face and a portion
of it is taken into the lungs at the next breath ; especially
is this the case if the head is bent forward: but when a
person is walking, and expels the air from his lungs, his
head is carried past the expired air before he draws in
another breath, and thus he gets a supply of pure air, with
its full proportion of oxygen, at every inspiration and thus
is the vigor of the vivacity which results from exercise in
the open air partially accounted for. Walking is very
beneficial to the digestive organs, by the gentle yet constant
motion which it imparts to them, and which is essential to
their long-continued healthful action. It brings into action
and properly develops more muscles than any other one
mode of exercise. It tends to equalize the circulation of
the blood. Pedestrians, rope-dancers, and those who exer-


cise their legs a great deal, are not troubled with the almost
universal complaint—cold feet. The reason is that exercise
calls the blood to the parts exercised, and the blood feeds
and warms. One objection to walking is that it takes so much
time. True it takes some time more, as a general thing,
than it does to ride; but so does the accomplishment of
anything desirable ; and is not good health desirable ? In
the end, however, it results in the saving of time, by pre-
serving the health, and increasing the vigor of all the phy-
sical and mental functions. In no way is there so much
time wasted, to say nothing of vitality, as in being sick,
and yet people are unwilling to give time to keeping well.
To obtain the greatest amount of good from walking,
it must, like everything else, he done right. In the first
place, it is always best to have some definite object in view
when going out to walk, some particular place or object of
interest to see, some purpose to accomplish, or some friend
to visit, and not walk merely for the purpose of walking,
if any other object can be attained at the same time. But
better walk without any other object than not walk at all.
The position of the body while walking is of great import-
ance. The body should incline slightly forward from the
hips, if walking slowly, and the inclination should increase
according to the rapidity of the walk. The head should
be kept on a line with the body, the shoulders and hips
held back, and the chest unimpeded in its action by tight
clothing or otherwise. The arms should be allowed to
swing freely at the side. The respiration should be carried
on entirely through the nostrils, and not through the mouth.
In commencing a long walk, walk slowly at first, and
gradually increase the speed. Invalids and persons who
are unaccustomed to walking, should begin with short
walks, being careful not to overdo, and increase the distance
as their strength and endurance increase. Any one who
will practise this precept—never ride when you can just as
well walk—will not only be more vigorous and healthy, hut
will accomplish far more than he or she otherwise would.
On Training. —As the enjoyment arising from many
of the amusements to which we have referred, will be sensib-
ly enhanced by an improved state of mental and physical
health, we here introduce, as not inappropriate, a chapter
on training. In the following remarks will be found re-
liable hints towards the attainment of a condition at once
so desirable and important to the excursionist, whether in
the pursuit of health or pleasure. It is universally ac-
knowledged that no animal is so much improved by training


as man ; none can endure such long and severe preparation
with advantage; and none exhibits the difference between
condition and its absence in so great a degree. It is not
only that man may be enabled to perform feats of strength
and activity that training is desirable, but also for the pro-
motion of his general health. A man in condition can run
a race of three or four miles, and at the end be all but ex-
hausted ; yet after half an hour, he could repeat the task,
whilst a man out of condition would become hopelessly
prostrated. To enable the man, sound in condition, but,
from mismanagement, out of health, to go into training with-
out causing mischief, requires great skill and self-command.
There are two kinds of excess which prove detrimental to
health, —excess in eating and drinking, and excess in seden-
tary pursuits. Either will, for a time entirely upset the
powers of the stomach, and, in fact, the whole system ; and
each will require distinct treatment. For instance, a per-
son who has been indulging to excess in drinking, smoking,
etc., although for a time able to withstand the consequences,
eventually loses appetite, refreshing sleep, and is threat-
ened with delirium tremens. If under such circumstances,
a man goes into training, the disease makes its appearance,
or the stomach refuses to do its duty, and the prescribed
work cannot be performed. By a little time and care, how-
ever, this state of things may be removed. In the case of
a young man whose fare is sparse and humble, but who is
suddenly allowed to drink to excess, he has no resource, no
out-door games or other occupation to engage his mind ;
the result is, beer, tobacco, and spirits commence and wind
up the day. Such a man suddenly finds all his energies
going, his mind dull, and his body enfeebled. In a happy
moment he bethinks himself of boating or some other amuse-
ment, and at once proceeds to the river or the road. What
is the consequence ? He is completely knocked up and per-
haps discouraged from further trial; in fact he requires
more care to render him fit for such exertion than the man
of habitual excess. A far greater difficulty lies before the
reading man, whose system has been over-taxed by exces-
sive application : his muscular system becomes unfit for
exertion, and is rendered stiff and cramped from the slight-
est effort. This state of things requires a considerable time
to restore the system to a fit state to undertake any severe
work, the muscles having become flabby, and the nervous
system wholly deranged. The same results frequently arise
from excessive drudgery in the counting-house. Some re-
lieve this unnatural condition by earty rising, pedestrian or
horse and rowing exercise. It is also most important to


have the mind agreeably occupied. There is no point more
neglected, both for preparation for training, and in the
actual period of severe work, than this, and of all others
should he most insisted upon. Bodily exercise without
amusement is mere drudgery ; it tires but does not lead to
a restoration of power. The diet should be plain, but varied.
It is almost unnecessary to inculcate the free use of cold
water every morning. It is not desirable to bathe regularly
though in warm weather a plunge is very serviceable ; but
at all seasons the whole body should be sponged every
morning; using in very cold weather, water at 60 or 65
degrees Fahrenheit. The body should be well rubbed with
a rough cloth, until a glow is produced. If reaction is
speedily produced, a calico shirt may be worn, but, if other-
wise, flannel, in winter, should be put on under the shirt.
Draughts. —The game of draughts, though not so
scientific or popular as chess is very interesting and when
played by equally matched opponents extremely exciting.
A person desirous of playing the game well, should always
engage with as good or better player than himself and if
easily beaten should take a handicap, by playing against a
lesser number of men thereby keeping the interest alive
with both players. The game should always be played in
a generous manner, there should be no “manning” in
the play; that is when an advantage in the number of men
is gained giving and taking so as to reduce the field still
further in favor of the greater number, it is almost unne-
cessary to say that in this kind of play there is no science
or amusement and it too often causes ill-feeling. Another
objection the player should guard against is moving apiece
and then withdrawing the move, this though not unfair,
produces vexation on your opponent’s mind and consequent-
ly destroys the pleasure of the game, let your motto be
touch and move, make up your mind what to do and do it.
When a player puts a piece in position to be captured the
opponent is bound to take, if the one offering so pleases ;
otherwise the one refusing to capture is “ huffed ” thereby
losing the piece that should have taken and the move. For
a person who desires to learn the game thoroughly we cannot
do better than recommend the purchase of Routledge’s
handbook on the game, price sixpence.
Football— This manly and athletic winter sport has
become thoroughly popular in Victoria, and is indulged in
by all classes of society, from the member of parliament
down to minute specimens of the rising generation. The


Melbourne Football Club (the oldest and strongest in the
colony) was first started by Mr. T. W. Wills—the famous
cricketer—upon his arrival from the “Old Country, about
12 years since. There are clubs now in almost every town
or village, and an excellent and simple code of rules, styled
the “Victorian Rules of Football,” has been unanimously
adopted. Upon all occasions of grand matches, m which
the leading Club competes against the military, the ponce
force, or such powerful rivals as Carlton or South Yarra
twenties, many thousands of people congregate to witness
the contests, and from the laughter at the scrimmages and
spills, and applause when some clever bit of play is exhibite ,
seem thoroughly to enjoy the sport The grounds are
situated as follows :—Melbourne Club, Yarra Park (outside
the M.C.C. reserve) ; Carlton, Royal Park ; South Yarra,
St. Kilda Cricket Ground ; Albert Park, Albert Park ;
Richmond, Yarra Park; East Melbourne, Yarra ParK ;
Hotham, Royal Park. There is a first-class match played
upon the Melbourne Club Ground almost every Saturday
during the season, which commences about the middle ot
May, and ends with September.
Hints on Hiking Horses, etc. —When a party is bent
on a day’s “ out,” it is in the highest degree advisable that
one should be well up in the art of driving, and possess a
thorough knowledge of harnessing : it is the want of this
that occasions the majority of mishaps. The “Jehu should
visit the proprietor of a respectable livery stable one or two
days previous to the “ out ” and make an engagement, letting
him know exactly the distance it is desired to go. Before
starting look particularly to the vehicle and horse : see that
the “ trap” is sound ; that no screws are missing ; and that
the harness is sound, and not patched up. Moreover, be
especially careful to see that you are properly “ put to :
everything depends on this. As the day wears on, the
greater care is necessary; grooms and helpers about stables
are sometimes careless, and the carelessness increases with
the number of “ nips ” travellers thoughtlessly give the™ :
therefore on all occasions before starting, walk round the
horse and examine for yourself. When driving, and within
a quarter of a mile of a house, where you intend to avail
yourself of the accommodation provided for “man and
beast,” it is desirable to slacken pace, so that your horse
may arrive comparatively cool. On putting it up it is very
necessary to see that he is fed; some grooms appear to think
the food unnecessary and return it to the bin. It is a good
plan for one of the party at intervals to visit the stables at


this critical period; it must be remembered that it is your
duty to the person you hire from, as well as to yourselves,
that you see that the horse is well fed. It may be incidentally
remarked here that no drink should be given to a stableman:
you unfit him for his business, and are liable to reap the
result of his negligence. If you feel disposed to give him a
gratuity, hand him a shilling on leaving, as he is enabled
then to keep it or spend it as his taste may dictate. With
regard to the law of hiring, etc., we give no opinion ; but
merely surmise, from a common sense view of the relations
between hirer and livery-stable keeper, that the latter is
bound to furnish whatever kind of horse that maybe required
for any particular purpose, whether for carrying a lady,
riding to hounds, hacking, or what not; on the other hand,
nothing should be disguised from him: if it is intended that
a long distance over bad roads should be traversed, let him
know beforehand, and you will get on much better. It is
the too common practice for a horse to be engaged for the
afternoon, for a trifling sum, and something like forty miles
taken out of the poor beast, which has probably been at
work in the morning. As they are generally busier at livery
stables on Saturdays and Sundays, the expense of an “out ”
would, probably, be lessened by selecting some other day of
the week.
Croquet. —Who in this colony of Victoria would not
play Croquet ? It is such a pleasing game with so many
little episodes and contretemps, besides such opportunities for
pretty spoken passages that no mortal on the right side of
forty can possibly resist it. How inviting the little emerald
sward appears, how grateful to the eye, how soft to the tread,
and shaded so nicely by the rustling trees. The hoops are
placed, the parti-colored balls and mallets are ready, and it
only remains to choose partners; but perhaps that is already
done and the game begins. It is not bad fun for us old
folks to look on and watch the play and bye-play. How
carefully each tends the steps of his pretty partner croquet-
ing aside perchance some interloping ball and urging on the
right one, through hoop and hoop, till at last the goal is
reached, the belle is rung, or at least there seems a speedy
prospect of it. But how about the losers ? They are too
engrossed with their own little game to feel hurt: but the
laggards have not been remiss, they have been running a
waiting race contenting themselves with the good old adage,
“ Better late than never.”
Billiards, one of the most fascinating games for tyro
or adept ever invented, has become so popular amongst all


classes of the community that it is probably entitled to take
precedence of all the in-door recreations. Not only may
billiard tables be found in almost every hotel and cafe but
also in most gentlemen’s private residences whose means
will permit of the luxury. This game like all others has
its uses and abuses. Tor those who have sufficient self-
control to play it in moderation there is no more healthful
in-door exercise, and many whose sedentary pursuits and
long hours render them either unfitted or unable to indulge
in those athletic sports which more favored individuals
pursue find that billiards combines exercise and excitement.
But let the novice beware who makes his essay at this
game or probably he will find the fascination so great that
instead of using it as a healthful amusement he will become
a slave to it and end by damaging both his health and
pocket. Let him confine himself to the legitimate English
game of billiards and not be inveigled by the insidious
wiles of a knowing “ marker ” into playing “ five shilling
general pin,” or “ devil’s pool ” or he will find himself
encroaching on the small hours imperceptibly and probably
wake in the morning with heavy head and light purse. It
would be useless in such a passing notice as this is intended
to be to attempt to explain all ,the intricacies of the game.
The rules are always to be found in every billiard room and
that is the proper place and the quickest method for the
beginner to make himself acquainted with the game and its
variations. Practice is the secret of proficiency. Anyone
can in course of time become a moderate if not a first-
class player. No doubt the game may be found rather
expensive if played constantly to those who cannot well
afford it, still if one confines himself to the legitimate game
and is satisfied to play with equal players, it is not more
expensive than many other more hurtful recreations which
one may pursue after dark. There is no game where the
tyro may be deceived more readily by one more experienced
than himself and no game perhaps by which so many
apparently respectable people manage to make a living, so
that one cannot be too careful with whom he plays. The
only way to avoid being beaten is never to play for money.
It should be borne in mind that playing for money destroys
all the legitimate excitement of the game and creates a
morbid propensity for gambling. The player who can
refrain from this will find billiards one of the most interesting
and healthy amusements which he can practise.
Cricket. —There are various cricket grounds in and
around Melbourne, the Government having been exceed-


ingly liberal in granting land for this purpose. The
principal is the Melbourne Cricket Ground which is
pleasantly situated in Yarra Park (familiarly known as
Richmond Paddock), about a mile from town ; and contains
about 11 acres. It was reserved some sixteen years ago, is
now vested in trustees, being the only one which is held on
a permanent tenure and is the head-quarters of cricket in
the colony. It has been vastly improved since it was first
occupied, and now has a very handsome appearance. The
beautiful level sward, unsurpassed even in England—
the comfortable-looking, well-kept buildings—the orna-
mental trees, and the trim garden—combine to present a
most pleasing picture. The ground is at all times open to
visitors ; and while many people frequently visit it for the
sake of its own intrinsic merits, many others do so on
account of the recollections connected with it; for, con-
sidering the age of the colony, it has a number of what
may be called in these go-ahead times, historic reminiscences.
It was here that the first of those cricket contests (which
afterwards became annual, and still continue) between
Victoria and New South Wales took place. It was here
that the English Cricketers played their first match, and
showed their immense superiority, in the presence of twenty-
five thousand spectators ; and it was here that the black-
fellows, who afterwards went to England, made their
appearance before the metropolitan public : in fact, all our
great cricketing events have taken place on this ground.
Here, likewise, at intervals, meetings are held for ped-
estrianism and other sports ; and it was here that our
athletes met the English champion pedestrians. There is
nothing very striking about the other cricket grounds,
except Ballarat, which is a perfect bijou of a place : the
insecurity of the holding—it being at pleasure—and the
impecuniosity of most of the clubs having prevented them
from making many improvements. The principal ones are
the East Melbourne, situated at Jolimont, at the foot of
Spring-street ; the Civil Service, situated in Yarra Park,
near the Friendly Societies’ Gardens ; the Richmond, which
is bounded by the Brighton Railway, Police Barracks,
Punt Road and Yarra park ; the South Melbourne, situated
in St. Kilda Park, facing the three-chain road ; and the
Carlton, a triangular piece of ground behind the University
and in immediate proximity to the Generel Cemetery.
Each of these has a good turf in the centre, the outer
portion however being somewhat rough ; and each has
what by courtesy is termed a pavilion. Those on the East
Melbourne, Richmond, and Carlton grounds are neat


erections. There are also the Warehousemen’s and the
Fawkner Park grounds, situated at opposite sides of the
St. Kilda Road, two miles from town ; the St. Kilda ground
east of the Railway Station ; the ground of the Fitzroy
Club at the north end of Brunswick-street; and that of
the Williamstown Club at the rear of the Battery. There
are a few other plots which, in time past, have been
used for cricket, but as they are not now held by any club,
they may be said to have reverted to the State.
Management of Holidays. —ln the first place, be
quite sure to get your holiday. Let nothing cheat you of
that. I know men gluttonous of work who refused to take
holidays ; some of them knocked up under softening of
the brain, or something of that sort. I knew -a man who
refused to give his two sons any holiday. One is in a
lunatic asylum, and the other cuts his father when he
meets him. The man who works with a great deal of
holiday really does much more work in the course of a year
than the man who takes no holiday, and he also continues
to work for a longer number of years. My principles are
the Great Holiday Principles, and I nail my glorious colors
firmly to the mast. I vote for abbreviating all hours of
labor and increasing all hours of holiday. lam firmly of
opinion that many boys and girls need not be kept so close
as they are, and I have no sympathies with people who
write complaining to the newspapers because a week has
been added to the summer holidays. But, no doubt, a holi-
day requires a deal of management. Perhaps people are
not allowed to have so many of them as they might because
they don’t know how to manage them properly. In that
case, it is perhaps better that they should have few, I have
known people, very well behaved in ordinary life, become
fretful, irritable, dissatisfied during their holidays. It has
been a relief to others, and probably to themselves, when
the holidays are over. It all arises from the want of a little
management, and we are quite sure that this will not be
your fault or mine, my reader. I think that the reason is
that people indulge in vain, indefinite expectation, and do
not sketch out to themselves the course which the holiday
season is likely to run. This is the reason why the old
stagers often enjoy their holidays much more than the en-
thusiastic young people. They know what to expect and
what not to expect. They have moderate aims, and such
aims are rarely disappointed. Now there are people who
are disappointed because they have no adventures, because
their hotel bills are too high, because the weather is rainy,


because no elegant girls nor eligible men turn up, because
the scenery does not come up to their expectations. Now
all this might have been avoided by a little management,
that one word which regulates all the minor miseries and
happinesses of life. Wordsworth makes his Happy Warrior
see what he foresaw. First sketch out your programme, and
do not pitch your note too high. I think there is no greater
pleasure than the construction of programmes. Sometimes
on a very dull day I will take up Thomas’s Guide to Ex-
cursionists, and presently be planning a tour with a far
greater zest than will ever belong to its accomplishment.
Learn to make allowances. Many a friendship has been
sundered because men who knew and liked each other for
years could not agree as smoking companions. I think it
is Tyndal who somewhere told the story of two German
students parting in mutual disgust, because they totally
disagreed in their theory of the glaciers. Many a long
matrimonial joy in life has been first marred by the
incipient disagreement of the honeymoon. Not only make
allowances for companions, but for alterations in weather
and fortuitous circumstances. Never be afraid of a rainy
day; you can pull hard on the Guidebook gossip, which
has been especially composed for your delectation. If you
have sweet temper and good companionship you are safe
for nine-tenths of the happiness of which this paltry planet
is susceptible. Then work up diligently the ground which
you take up for your summer campaign. We are entitled
to a certain amount of cheerful anticipation, and if we don’t
get it we lose one of the best ingredients of the social salad.
Get your guide books, procure a map, consult books, look
up views and photographs, procure introductions if you can
have them, make inquiries among your friends. You are
intensifying your holiday and making it a treasury of re-
collections and associations when you may have to lay aside
touring, when the pleasant paths of life fall into the hard
dry road of duty and routine.
CAMPING OUT.
It is generally understood that most people make up their
minds to “rough it” on such occasions, but there is really
no reason why a little comfort should not enter into one’s
arrangements. Indeed, if there were more of this, we
should not so frequently hear of rheumatism and premature
decay afflicting our sporting men. I know we cannot take
feather beds and mosquito curtains : but we need not
necessarily sleep on the bare ground, nor need we blister


our backs by alternately exposing them to the piercing night
wind and to the roasting fire. Mrs. Chisholm’s notion, that
a man can comfortably sleep under a gum tree the whole
year round in Australia, may “go down,” in England; but
hardly here. No sporting man should be without his little
holland tent and his ’possum rug : and if his trip is likely
to extend over a few days, a complete change of clothes
from head to foot. Having thus prepared for the exterior,
he will, of course, not forget the comfort of the inner man.
It is a great mistake to go short of “ grub ” at any time, but
especially is it so on trips which stimulate the digestive
organs to extraordinary action. Having, then, looked to
the stock of provisions generally, the inevitable “billy,”
with tea and sugar, must not be forgotten ; nor must the
matches. An axe, or strong tomahawk, will be found handy
to get firewood, and to fix the tent.
In selecting a spot for the tent, see that it is sheltered
from the wind, and that the ground is sufficiently elevated
and sloping to be clear of water ; in fixing it, mind the
pegs are driven home. I know it is the custom to hurry
over this work, thinking “Oh! it’s only for a night; ” but
believe me, a little time spent in making a secure job of it
is time well spent. It is frightfully uncomfortable to wake
up at midnight in a driving wind and pelting rain, and find
the tent about your ears, bedding wet, and clothes saturated.
Besides, it is worth something, on turning in, to have the
sense of security. I’ll defy a man to sleep soundly if he is
in mortal dread of a collapse, should the wind rise during
the night.
This work done, cut some ferns and lay them on the
spot intended for your bed; over these ferns spread a
good layer of dry grass (cut from the tussocks prevalent
in most parts of the bush,) and over all spread the
’possum rug. A king might envy the sleep of the tired
man who turns in at the close of a weary day, with just
one glass of grog inside him, on such a couch.
In forming a large party, it is customary to appoint
some two or three, a few days beforehand, to attend to the
victualling department; and this is a good plan, for if
matters are left till the last day a hundred things are for-
gotten : everybody thought everybody else would think of
it, and so the pleasure is effectually marred, and what was
intended as an enjoyable “ out ” is discovered to be a com-
plete “ sell.”
It is essential in all parties, whether large or small,
that one good man, experienced in such matters, should
be appointed captain, whose orders shall be cheerfully
obeyed by all: it saves an immense amount of discomfort.


It is also a great point to secure a proper division of labor :
members should be “told off” for such necessary duties as
the captain may think well to have performed. One will
take charge of the firearms,—will see that on any return to
camp they are all placed in a proper spot and not taken
loaded into the tent; and at night he will see to their being
cleaned and secured. Another will take charge of the
stores, and direct the cook as to his duties. Another will
keep the key of the grog, and serve out the allowance
decided upon.
Of course, much of all this will depend upon the ex-
tent of the party, and will be affected by circumstances.
Even if a cook be taken to attend to the creature comforts
of the company, it is still a capital plan to appoint a cook’s
mate from the party; and, if a new man is appointed day
by day, there is a little emulation at work as to who will
produce, the best dishes, and give the most satisfaction.
The writer suggested this plan once, when in command of
a large party, and it worked admirably. The feeds we got
in those days were something to remember, even at this
distant date. Besides the plan named fixes responsibility:
a man is fairly “on his mettle ” if he knows something
good is expected of him ; and I verily believe that, had a
systematic observer like M. Soyer been present he would
have gained a wrinkle or two, and a few new dishes would
have been added to his list of entrees which, I fear, are
now lost to the world.
Moreover, it is a great comfort to feel that, on return-
ing to camp, you have in a cook’s mate some security
against a drunken cook. It is a great sell, after a tiring
day to find the grog broached, the cook drunk, the fire out,
and nothing ready to eat or drink. Experientia docet stultos.
Of ordinary, well-known tents, the one most likely to
satisfy the varied wants of excursionists is Evan’s three-
pole tent, illustrated below. After that choose a small
marquee ; but it is less secure in wind, and the pitch of
its roof is bad for rain, and the straggling tent-ropes are
objectionable.


Chess. —This truly noble game has long had the place
accorded to it at the head of all in-door amusements. The
elaborate analysis to which it has been subjected—its end-
less combinations, the long continued study requisite for
becoming a proficient, and the mental qualities of calcula-
tion and foresight called into action by it—almost elevate
it to the rank of a science. At the same time the pleasure
it affords to the tyro equally with the most advanced
master must always render it fascinating to all who over-
come the prejudice against it on account of its supposed
difficulty, and who take the trouble to learn the moves. Of
late years a taste for the game has spread rapidly over the
whole of the Australian colonies. A strong club, numbering
about seventy members, was formed in Melbourne in 1866,
and has done much to promote the interests of chess l)y the
public tournaments and Intercolonial matches it has inaug-
urated. This club meets daily throughout the year after
4 p.m., at Nissen’s Cafe, Bourke-street, where play will
generally be found going on after the hour mentioned. The
entrance fee for members is 10s. 6d., and the yearly sub-
scription £1 Is., but players from the country are always
welcome as visitors, if introduced by a member. All necess-
ary information can be obtained at the club room from the
honorary secretary, or from members of the committee,
some of whom will generally be found in attendance. There
is also a club at St. Kilda, which meets at the Town Hall,
and another at Emerald Hill, which holds its meetings at
the Mechanics’ Institute. At Ballarat, where there are
some strong players, there is play going on every evening
at the Mechanics’ Institute, and other clubs will probably
soon be formed in most of the more important provincial
towns. In both Adelaide and Sydney flourishing clubs have
been established, with'the former of which the Melbourne
club had an interesting encounter by telegraph in 1868,
which resulted in victory for Melbourne by a majority of
sto 1. To promote such friendly trials of skill between the
colonies, and the interests of chess generally, the “ Chess
Association of Victoria ” has been formed, which players
in every part of the colony, who have the interests of chess
at heart, ought to join. The subscription is only ss. per
annum, and members, besides having the privilege of
witnessing the matches, will be furnished with a copy of
pamphlets containing an account of the matches with the
games, should the number of subscribers be sufficient to
warrant the committee to publish them. The first match
under the auspices of this association was played on the 9th
November 1870 with New South Wales, terminated in a


victory for Melbourne, which virtually won four games,
drew two, and lost one, out of seven games played. The
literature of chess if collected would form quite a library
many writers of high ability have devoted years to
analysing the infinite combinations of the pieces. The
learner should, however, at first content himself with con-
sulting some elementary treatise on the most common
openings ; after having mastered which he will find the
more elaborate works on the game a comparatively easy
study. For beginners, we would recommend the Handbook
of Chess, by G. F. Pardon, published at the low price of
sixpence, which may be procured from Mr. Mullen, Collins
street. For well advanced students there is nothing better
than Staunton’s Handbook and Praxis, varied by a course of
Morphy’s games. For a faithful account of colonial chess
the reader should consult the well-conducted chess columns
of the Leader and Australasian, where he will find many
good colonial problems and well played games, accompanied
with judicious criticism. In Adelaide the Observer has also
a column devoted to the game ; and Sydney has two chess
organs in the Weekly Mail and Town and Country Journal.
Gardening.— Sages have pronounced that the enjoy-
ments afforded by a garden are among the purest of
pleasures. If this has always proved true, even in the
countries with the icy winters of the north, how much more
grateful must be the task of gardening in our genial clime.
Abundance of flowers can be commanded here throughout
the year by the exercise of that mere slight attention which
any amateur may so readily bestow on any plot of ground
around him. . For the preservation of health the recreative
occupations in a garden are most conducive, and within
every one’s reach : even the window of a dusty street may
be adorned with gay flowers, such as pelargoniums and
succulents, not to speak of others requiring more careful
tending. How many humble cottage is, or might be
rendered bright in this sunny Australia by the gayness of
flowers, without any expenditure or real toil. The mind is
expanded when it reflects on the wondrous forms of beauty
which the flowers of so many countries present: the
r . e< r 1 0 !} cctl 1 0ns of what we saw in the gardens of our early
childhood remains ever unobliterated. To the invalid a
garden plot at his house frequently offers the only source
o± pleasure, and for lofty inspirations of mankind under all
Ce^ 0f life ’ flowers have furnished an inexhaust-
Lnd recrcn'tinrf WG Step be^ond culture for mere pleasure
and recreation, we may see many a waste spot utilized and


rendered cheerful around many dwellings. By the united
efforts of the colonists in raising trees on their property
much may be done, not merely towards the comforts of a
family, but for the benefit of whole communities. To
render occasional spare hours profitably and pleasingly
employed, most colonists have a fair chance by planting
trees and utilitarian bushes. Trees planted now may stand
after centuries as a grateful monument of forethought,
while the raising carries always with it its own reward at
once to the operator and proprietor.
Rabbit Shooting at Shelford. —Shelford is a
township about 67 miles from Melbourne; the journey,
accomplished in four hours, is by railway 55 miles the
remaining 12 miles by coach. A trip to this locality is
amply repaid by the fine scenery surrounding the township
which is situated in a valley, and enclosed by very high
hills, from whose summits extensive views are afforded the
visitor; but the attraction, par excellence, to this district
is undoubtedly its rabbit shooting. The hills around Shelford
are alive with rabbits, that give capital sport within a mile
of the township. In Shelford there is a comfortable hotel
—the Settlers’ Arms, at which the charges are most
moderate. Mr. Stewart, the proprietor, will afford visitors
facilities for obtaining first-rate sport, and will also provide
ferrets for their use. Both methods of shooting rabbits,
over ferrets or dogs, require skill and quickness, rabbits
being very lively animals. Shooting over ferrets we
consider the better sport, as the rabbit rushes from its
burrow and affords the sportsman a quick and pretty shot.
Shooting over dogs is also good : It is obtained in the “ tus-
socks” (long tufts of grass), which require to be carefully
gone over, for rabbits will lie almost as close as quail.
From October to the following June is the best time for a
trip, as the young are well grown in October, and do not
interfere with the working of the ferrets. There are
young rabbits all the year round, but not to the same
extent as during the three months we exempt. The trip can
be done in two days, but still better in three, for which
time a return ticket by railway can be obtained. The
coach meets the 6.30 a.m. train from Melbourne on Tues-
day, Thursday, and Saturday in each week ; but we would
suggest to a party going there that they should write
to Mr. Stewart of the hotel, stating by what train they will
leave Melbourne, the number of the party, &c., and he will
send his buggy to the Leigh Road Station, and, if desired
drive visitors at once to the warrens. As Shelford is the


nearest point to Melbourne at which rabbits can he shot in
quantity, it will probably become very popular amongst
sportsmen, and especially to those to whom time and money
are objects. The route to Shelford is by rail to the Leigh
Road station on the Melbourne and Ballarat line. Thence
by coach to Shelford.
To Pedestrians. —Never choose a walk too long for
your strength, and try as much new ground as convenient.
Remember that “ when fatigue commences, enjoyment
ceases,” and “ variety is the charm of life that gives it all
its flavor.”
Change of Air. —An occasional change of air may be
said to be almost necessary to the well-being of every man.
The workman must leave his workshop, the student his
library, the lawyer his office, or, sooner or later, his health
will pay the penalty ; and this, no matter how great his
temperance in eating and drinking ; no matter how vigor-
ously and regularly he uses his limbs ; no matter how open
and dry, and free from sources of impurity, may be the
air of the place in which he is employed. In the slighter
cases of impaired health, sleeping in the suburbs of the
town in which the day is chiefly spent, or even spending a
few hours of detached days in some accessible rural district
a few miles distant from the dwelling, may suffice to restore
the healthy balance of the bodily functions, and maintain
the bodily machine in a fit state for its duties; but in cases of
greater urgency, or of somewhat more aggravated character
a more decided change of air, for even a few days, once or
twice a year, may be required to adjust or restore the due
economy of the system.
Rowing. —To the true oarsman rowing is not merely
a pastime, it is a second existence. Every motion of the
boat as she leaps with convulsive speed through the parted
water is like a new pulse beat. His heart swells, his frame
dilates, his eye brightens, every muscle grows taut and
nerved with an unaccustomed strength. Leaping as if
every movement were a fresh enjoyment to her, the boat
springs ceaselessly forward, dancing coquettishly ahead of
the roguish ripple which strives to embrace her, like the
mythic JE a, pursued by her watery love, Phasis. And the
oarsman gliding along smoothly and silently, watching the
long streak astern which, like, the parting in a fair girl’s
hair melts and thins away into shadow, feels a buoyancy,
an elevation of feeling, in which all petty cares are sunk


and lost. All his thought and attention are concentrated
for the time on the one object. To her he is like some
kind husband, guiding her past the shallows, turning her
aside from rude obstructions and sunken dangers which be-
set her path, staying her against adverse currents, and
directing her ever fearlessly onward. Few pleasures,
exceed that felt when bounding along, in a light racing out-
rigger, dependant for motion on one’s own strength and
skill, feeling the boat yield obedient to every impulse, and
distancing all competitors by reason of the perfect sym-
metry of her form. Or, if you are lazily inclined, you may
lie back in her, and float listlessly down stream, or drift
beneath the shading willows. Remember it is a mistake to
think one cannot lie down in an outrigger, but don’t attempt
it unless you are a skilful oarsman, and don’t let go of the
sculls for an instant as you value a dry shirt. If you are
an exceptionally indolent man you may take a canoe and
paddle about in an aimless sort of manner, moving, along
like some big water snail. If you want gentle exercise and
companionship, join a club and pull up in racing time to
Church-street bridge, “ spell,” and then off again to Pear-
son’s tea gardens, or Roberts’s, lower down, refresh there,
and back again in quick time to the sheds. There are
many clubs in existence, and the entrance fee and subscrip-
tion is low —generally a guinea at initiation and two guineas
per year. The ballot is usually resorted to to test quali-
fication, but very few clubs are exclusive, save, of course,
those formed of special coteries, such as the Warehouse-
men’s,” the “Banks’,” the “University,” &c. If you prefer
sculling, it is best to eschew clubs and arrange with one of
the boat proprietors, who, for a weekly or monthly charge,
will let you have a boat to yourself as often as you require
it, If you are good-looking, with a decent voice, an exten-
sive acquaintance among the ‘fair sect,’ and a taste. for
pic-nics, hire a big boat and make many pleasant excursions
up to the Survey Paddock, where you can stop to tea, and,
if you like, pull over to the gardens for fruit, &c. But
when you want a quiet spooney chat with “ the desire of
your heart and the light of your eyes,” cab it down to the
Johnston-street bridge over the Yarra, help her up the
broken-down wooden steps on the left of the cutting, cross
over the hill, and there, just opposite the Bend, you will
find about a dozen pair-oar, pic-nic and sculling boats for
hire. The latter hold two very comfortably, and while one
pulls, the other can sit gracefully in the stern ; cast down
long lashes over expressive eyes, and sing pretty tender
sentimental songs which suggest sentiments pleasant to


utter, pleasant to hear, and fruitful perhaps in bringing all
the light and beauty into your life for which you have ever
hoped. But please not to forget the boat, for the stream is
snaggy : look out for broken water ahead, mind your
steering, and if you get into a mess, be cool, calm, and
deliberate, remembering that you have to depend on your-
self not on passers by for help. If you are ever inclined
for a long bachelor solitary cruise, launch a canoe below
the falls bridge by Queen-street, and paddle down to the
Saltwater river, or get a party of jolly fellows and share
the expense of a four-oar with them. Remember one thing,
don’t trust yourself on such an expedition with tyros in
rowing, and be prepared for a wet shirt, if not for being
occasionally swamped by the swell of the steamers. All
other information and advice you can obtain from the boat
proprietors Edwards, Fuller, and Greenland, who have sheds
nigh Prince’s bridge, and at the lakes on Ballarat. If you
will take an old oarsman’s advice, it is this : Do not get
into a light boat until you are thoroughly able (in other
people’s opinion) to manage heavy ones ; do not bother
about sailing in so narrow a river as the Yarra ; keep
always on the south side of the river when going up stream
xrom Melbourne, and on the north side when coming back
to it ; preserve good temper if you have a collision or an
accident; and never think of anything but your boat from
the time you get in her till you have her safely out of the
water. Remember for the nonce she is your sweetheart,
and a very exacting one ; if you do not devote undivided’
attention to her, she will assuredly bring you into mischief.
The Annual Melbourne Regatta, is held at Easter
on the Uppey Yarra, the course being from Prince’s
bridge to the Botanical Garden’s bridge—a distance of
about a mile and a quarter. There are generally about
ten prizes to be competed for, including Grand Challenge
Cup for all four-oared boats, Champion Sculls, the “ Gar-
dmer ’’ Challenge Cup for four-oared gigs, and the Victo-
rian Challenge Pairs for all pair-oared boats. These races
must all be won three times consecutively by the same
club, or competitor, as in the case of the Challenge Sculls,
before the prize itself becomes the property of the holder,
n addition to the above, there are races in different classes
ot boats for maiden oarsmen, in which the aspiring puller
generally makes his debut. In consequence of the narrow-
ness and tortuous nature of the river Yarra, and the
number of competing crews for almost every event, the
committee of the Regatta have arranged that only’ two


boats shall start for each heat, the winners rowing off till
finally decided. The river is also buoyed with red flags from
start to finish, defining the course to be observed by each
competing crew. It may be remarked that, as at Lton,
the water assigned a boat at starting in a race belongs
to it throughout the race ; and a boat going the wrong
side of a buoy is thereby disqualified. The thousands
of people who annually throng the shady banks of the
meandering Yarra to witness the pluck and skill of the
competitors, bear ample testimony of the favor with which
aquatic sports are viewed in this offshoot of that country
which has always held its own, and been always so invincible
on the water against every nation and clime. The annual
opening day of the aquatic season on our own little larra
is a sight, the like of which lias rarely been witnessed in
any country. Over forty four-oared boats, extending over
a distance of about half-a-mile, formed m line on the last
opening day, and rowed to Church-street bridge and bac ,
in the presence of several thousands of our respected citizens
and colonists. Innumerable pairs, sculler’s and watermen s
boats gave the festival an appearance of magnitude which
must be seen to be realized. In addition to the races which
take place at the Annual Regatta, there is scarcely a week
that we have not scratch fours or pairs amongst the mem-
bers of the various clubs : these are called club matches.
In fact from the moment that fine weather sets in--about
the beginning of September—till the latter end of autumn,
our river is the arena of the most manly, and, when takei
in moderation, the most healthful of all athletic pastimes.
(Gymnastics properly understood, should teach how
to systematise exercise, so as to make it applicable to every
individual requirement at the most different st g
health and strength, for old people as well as young, ami
women as well as men. Melbourne and environs possess
four public establishments in which exercise of the above
description is practically taught, viz. : the National Gy -
nasium on the East Melbourne Cricket Ground, facing t
Treasury Reserve and the Eitzroy Gardens • instructor
Mr Techow : the Victorian Gymnasium, corner of Russell
and Little Flinders streets : instructor, Mr. Johnson: the
St. Kilda Gymnasium, in the Orderly Room of the local \ol
unteer artillery : instructor, Mr. Beyer : Herr■
Gymnasium, Collins-street west. From these centres
knowledge and practice of gymnastic exercises have of late
years widely spread. Not only have all the principal schools
(girls’ and boys’) more or less spacious erections and aie


regular classes for the training of common school teachers
established at one of the above-mentioned places, by
authority of the Board of Education, but in many private
houses. also the pullies, for expansion of the chest, or
the. pair of rings, or one or the other favorite among the
various parts of a complete gymnastic apparatus, have been
introduced. It would, however, be a great mistake to
believe that a more or less complicated machinery is indis-
pensably necessary for the practice of gymnastics. The
free standing exercise with addition of dumb-bells, or bell-
bars, or simple poles are quite sufficient for all purposes of
health if properly understood and systematically carried
out, but they require a good deal more learning than at
first sight is generally believed. A course of instruction of
twelve months under a competent teacher will in most
cases be sufficient to acquire the necessary knowledge for
the safe and beneficial practice of gymnastics at home. A
mere random practice, without previous instruction, will
often prove dangerous and generally remain useless. There
are a good many books now on the subject, which may
with advantage be consulted. The principal ones are the
following, viz :—l. Raven stein and Hulley (instructors in
the large London and Liverpool gymnasia) Handbook of
Gymnastics and Athletics.—London ; Trubner & Co. 2.

nasium, Melbourne) Manual of Gymnastic Exercises.—G.

ment of certain chronic diseases, &c. ; the last two for
use in families and schools.
Directions to People Lost in the Bush.—l. As
soon as you discover yourself astray, sit down and quietly
consider what course you should take, and do not be flurried.
When you have made up your mind, go straight ahead, and
never change your course on any sudden impulse, but only
attcr sitting down and considering carefully your position.


2. When you find yourself utterly lost, stop at once and
wait for your friends to find you. If you cannot do that
3. Never leave a road when once you have found it. It
must lead somewhere. 4. If you come upon a fence, stick
to it. It must lead to a gate and a road. 5. Find a water-
course, and follow it down ; not in the channel, but in sight
cutting off the bends. It must lead to open country. 6.
At short intervals, cast your eyes upon the ground and
around you, taking care not to change your course.— g.s.l.
The Bowling Alley.— American and German Bowls.
Behind the Excelsior Hotel at the top of Bourke-street some
enterprising men have opened a bowling alley, where both
American and German bowls are played. The evening
seems to be the time generally chosen, but players visit there
both morning and afternoon. As a means of exercise few
games are better and many not so good. The balls used are
from five to twelve pounds in weight. A genial warmth or
a slight perspiration may be attained in from one to three
games. One to four players can join in a game, the average
length of which is twenty minutes. The American game is
counted on the number of pins knocked down in five
attempts or strings of three balls each ; the pins, or such as
are knocked down, being set up again, after the rolling of
the blind ball. Should the unusual luck occur of all the pins
being knocked down at the first or second ball, the first,
which is called a “ strike,” and the second a “ spare,” an
extra number is counted to the player on the next and second
balls, and the pins again set up. The German game is one
of substraction, not of addition, played with nine pins, each
player being credited with a 200 score, and debited with the
result of each two balls thrown. All pins knocked down
over six count with additions and the getting of a strike, or
all pins with one ball count to 36. The German game lasts
longer than the American, and is in many respects, economy
being one, decidedly preferential. Try both.
The Shooting Gallery. —Shooting has apparently
become one of the businesses of life, and being shot at is
another. We may any day be involved in a European
quarrel, and then the best shot will be the hero of the day.
It is certain that the coming man, whatever he may or may
not do, will positively shoot and shoot well too. It is a
matter of congratulation that those who may not be volun-
teers can learn to handle the rifle, for there is day, evening,
and nightly opportunity of doing this at the shooting
gallery in Bourke-street, opposite the Theatre Royal, where


there is a right-of-way leading to the omnibus stables, and
to it. As you approach the place you can hear the pops
and the bangs, or, more properly speaking, “ The rattle of
arms and the ring of the rifle.” A half-hour’s or an
hour’s match with a friend will cost a shilling, and deter-
mine whether our hands and our eyes will serve us at need
—should that need come. To be forearmed is to he fore-
warned some one has said, and if not wanted otherwise,
the art is worth acquiring that it may be used amongst the
ducks during the holidays, when far away from Bourke-
street.
The Games op the Ancients were mostly of a
religious nature, serving as important institutions for the
promotion of harmony and social union. The education of
the ancient Britons chiefly consisted in proficiency in the
following games The lifting of great weights, running,
leaping, swimming, wrestling, riding, archery, sword-play,
two-handed sword exercise, spear exercise, coursing, fishing,
fowling, music and heraldry.
Every man, in trying to lay out his life to the best
advantage, in seeking to attain to the true savoir vivre, takes
great count of his holidays. There is an action and reaction
in these things. The more thorough and complete the
holiday the more thorough and complete will be one’s life.
Plain Directions por Bathers.— Avoid bathing
within two hours after a meal. Avoid bathing when
exhausted by fatigue or from any other cause. Avoid
bathing when the body is cooling after perspiration ; but
bathe when the body is warm, provided no time is lost
in getting into the water. Avoid chilling the body by
sitting or standing naked on the banks or in boats after
having been in the water. Avoid remaining too long in the
water. Leave the water immediately there is the slightest
feeling of chilliness. On leaving the water wrap a dry
towel round the head ; this serves not only to dry the hair,
but prevents headache. Avoid bathing altogether in the
open air, if, after having been a short time in the water,
there is a sense of chilliness, with numbness of the hands
and feet. The vigorous and strong may bathe early in the
morning, but the young, and those that are weak, should
bathe from two to three hours after breakfast. Those who
are subject to attacks of giddiness and faintness, and those
who suffer from palpitation and other sense of discomfort
at the heart, should not bathe without,first consulting their
medical adviser.

noinrrm to this subiect for the amusement of its readers,

The Clubs of Melboubne are three in number, less
numerous than in Sydney ; they are the Melbourne Club, at
the east end of Collins-street; The Athenaeum, in the middle
of Collins-street, and the Yorick, next the Argus office, in
the same street. The Melbourne is the oldest and most
exclusive of these institutions. The Athenaeum is a pro-
prietary club, established seven years ago, supported by the
leading mercantile and professional people of the city, the
entrance fee is live guineas, annual subscription five
guineas. The Yorick Club provides for the tastes of the
literary, scientific, and artistic members of the community,
and is a flourishing and compact little institution. Its
entrance fee is two guineas, and subscription two guineas.
Some people consider that any old clothes will do for
travelling ; this is a mistake, and especially if the journey
be a long one, as, apart from' appearance, old clothes
frequently require repairing at most inconvenient times and
places. A travelling suit however coarse the material it is
of, should be new and strong. No more clothes should be
taken than are essential, as in case of need others can be
purchased.
It is not sufficient for a pleasure excursion that the
traveller has money enough to meet his expenses. The
comfort which a tourist is likely to enjoy in an excursion
will greatly depend on his carrying with him a ready stock
of good temper and forbearance, which have more certain
currency than gold in the purchase of civilities and efforts
to please. A man will see more, enjoy more, and learn
more by carrying with him his head and his heart in good
travelling trim than can be obtained by having his pockets
full of letters of credit without this necessary state of mind
and feelings.
Reading Aloud.— Probably nine out of ten of our
young cornstalks consider reading at all as a very “ slow ”
amusement; and as to reading aloud, why “ they cannot be
bothered.” But we would respectfully observe to such
individuals that their prejudice against reading, and
especially reading aloud—for it can be nothing but prejudice
—springs from that prolific source of the hateful feeling—
ignorance. What we do well we soon learn to like, and
anybody who, by a judicious amount of study and practice,
has acquired the graceful art of reading aloud will soon
become so proud of the accomplishment, that the boredom
—if any—attendant on its practice will be likely to be


entailed on those who are forced to listen to the reader s
rounded periods. But there need be no bor edom invoived
in the matter at all. What can be pleasanter when the
weather is inclement for one m a company to select a volume
calculated to be most pleasing to those and vf n l
his or her companions are engaged m needlework, drawing,
or what not, to “ read with accent true and good discretion
the verse or prose as the case may be. And it 1
vouns man—we will say-is asked to read thus to a
company, that the benefit of a little previous instruction m
the 1 common rule, of elocution will be found myatab to.
“Oh!” but I think I hear my reader exclaim, no one
looks for elocutionary effects from a person under sue
circumstances.” Granted, but I would ask my hypothetical
objector, if in his experience he has not, on L tine
occasion, been pained to hear a person reading, or attempting
to read, with no sort of ability for the task— stuttering,
stammering, getting red and uncorafort^ l^o e o lf ’ N a
making everybody in the company uncomfortable too. JNo
a little^previous preparation would have obviated all this
discomfort The reader would have derived gratification
from a little innocent display of ability, and his audience
many or few—would have been pleased. Young lady or
young gentleman reader, take the advice of an old stager
nractfse yourself in reading alound. Read both verse and
Se but especially the former, as it presents the greater
IlEilties Read good lyrical poetry, say Tennyson s,
Milton or Wordsworth’s blank verse; and, notably for

When you have a Long Holiday, do not make it a mere
conglomeration of little holidays. Make it perform the
functions of a long holiday. Go to some place which is a
very long way off, or do some nearer locality very thoroughly
or obtain a thorough change in all your belongings. So the
Long Holiday will yield solid provender for memory and
thought, and will help the practical work of life.
How to Avoid Sunstroke.— When exposed to excess-
ive heat the natural perspiration or sweating must not be
checked ; let the sweat flow, and do not throw off all the
flannel garments. Wash the head and neck frequently


cold water ; and if exposed in the sun or in any very hot
place, wear upon the top of the head, under a hat, or other-
wise, a light handkerchief or other thin folds of cloth wet
with cold water. Remember that the head and neck must
be kept cool, and also free from the pressure of tight cloth-
ing. If headache, dizziness, a feeling of tightness across
the forehead, a failing of sight, or a feeling of weakness
and prostration (“ giving out ”) occurs, let the person im-
mediately go to a cool place and lie down with the back and
the feet covered, and have a few quarts of cold water pour-
ed slowly upon the head and the sides of the neck. If the
symptoms are not at once relieved send for the nearest
good physician. If the patient is still sweating let him
drink freely of cold black tea or coffee ; tea is best. But
if sweating has ceased there is very great danger. Then
the head, face, neck, and entire chest should be rapidly
sponged with ice water, and a bag of pounded ice, well
covered with a towel, should be kept under the head and
the back of the neck. Give a mixture of carbonate of
ammonia (hartshorn) and muriate of ammonia, eight or ten
grains of each in water, every ten or fifteen minutes, until
the physician comes, or until the patient rallies and sweats.
Enfeebled, intemperate, poorly-fed, over-fed and irritable
persons are most in danger of the fatal effect of heat.
People who live and sleep in foul air and unventilated
places, and who are over-worked and under-fed, and who
use intoxicating drink suffer greatly. Instead of intoxi-
cating drink, and the baneful habit of morning and evening
drams, let good black tea and coffee, and good nourishing
and well-cooked food be regularly taken. Bathe the whole
body early in the morning, in order to have a clean skin
and good natural sweating during the day. Remember
that by natural sweating (perspiration) the body is kept
healthfully cool when exp sed to excessive heat, and that
over-exertion, passion, and all kinds of intemperance must
be avoided.
HINTS TO EQUESTRIANS.
A great many works have been published, having for
their object the instruction of novices in the art of riding,
and the general management of the horse.
It is the great fault of most works of this nature that
they attempt too much ; go into the question too deeply ;
lay down rules too arbitrarily. The result is that the


reader is more perplexed upon the subject than he was
before perusing them. . A
No art in point of fact is less arbitrary as to its details.
You see good riders with each a seat and method of his
own, and there are several classes of riders having their
peculiar characteristics and excellencies, as the bush or
rough rider, the military rider, the jockey. ,
In the first place, with reference to the choosing of a
horse : to thoroughly understand the various diseases to
which the horse is subject; to be able to detect the. pres-
ence of them in an animal; and arrive at a conclusion as
to his powers, upon a mere inspection, is what no one in
our opinion, however great his experience, can pretend to
do. A good judge, however, if he has seen the horse going,
and has had the opportunity of examining him thoroughly,
will generally arrive at a correct conclusion. But there is
nothing like a trial. We have seen a horse parted with
by one individual as a “ duffer,” eulogised by a fresh owner
as an animal of extraordinary value ; both were sensible
men, each having some experience of horses. lne tact
was that the one looked for certain qualities which the
other was indifferent about. t ...
No doubt good breeding is a thing to be looked to ;
but you cannot have a worse hack than a broken-down
racer ; thoroughbreds seldom make good hacks. Bick
your horse for his qualities, and, if he suits you, do not
trouble about his pedigree. ■ ,
We will now suppose you to be possessed of a horse
that suits you, and proceed to discuss bridles and saddles.
The plain snaffle is the best of bridles. If you study ap-
pearances, you may have a double reined one. Some horses
require a curb ; their mouths, perhaps, have been spoiled
by bad handling, or they may be so hot-tempered that they
may require the restraint of a curb, in such case use one
by all means ; but if you have a horse with a pleasant light
mouth, why spoil his action and temper by using an instru-
ment that tortures him unless very skilfully used ? Let us
advise you never to use a martingale unless your horse
actually requires one. Some horses have a nasty habit or
throwing up their heads ; double rings generally check
this sufficiently, and, as they confine a horse’s head less than
the ordinary martingale, are to be preferred. Use a breast-
plate or crupper if the shape of your horse requires them ;
both are necessary in a hilly country.
Now about mounting. Stand on the. near side of the
horse—a little more forward than, his girths—draw your
reins backwards over the saddle with the right hand, take


them up short with the left, and take, at the same time, a
good hold of a lock of your horse’s mane, about six inches
before the wither; throw the ends over on the off side,
bring down the right hand and seize the near stirrup, raise
the left foot and place it in the stirrup, and seize the cantle
of the saddle with the right hand, you can then with a slight
spring stand erect with the left foot in the near stirrup, and
by throwing the right leg over the saddle, and picking up
the off stirrup with the foot, the act of mounting is accom-
plished. A little practice will soon teach you the most
convenient length of stirrup ; avoid either a very long or a
very short stirrup.
Practice, and nothing but practice, will give that power
of accommodating yourself to the motions of your horse,
and address in handling the reins, which characterises a
thorough horseman.
Many excellent works upon the art of riding may be
perused with advantage ; but do not expect too much from
them. If you select a good rider as the companion of your
equestrian excursions, he will teach you more in the course
of a few rides than all the works that have been written on
the subject.
HINTS TO EQUESTRIENNES.
“ ’Tis good to see a steed of noble race
By woman ruled with skill and mastery ;
The smitten air gives freshness to her face,
And animation glistens in her eye ;
Her very breathing quickens into grace,
And e’en a fault enchants. Few things outvie
A lovely woman on a fiery horse,
The mingled form of gentleness and force.
In the first place, ascertain whether your horse has ever
been ridden by a lady before. If so, how long since, and
when last ridden by anyone. Get some one to mount him
(if a strange horse), and canter for a few minutes up and
down turning him suddenly, at the same time flapping a
towel > or piece of cloth round and about his flanks and
nuarters while he is going. If lie has any inclination to
buck or he restive, he will most likely exhibit it then or
not at all. Next look to your bridle. See that the bit is
not so low in his mouth as to allow of his getting it in his
teeth, or so high as to gag him. If you do not know your
horse or have not been accustomed to use the curb rein
(which is always the best with a light hand) you will
have to put up with the snaffle rein, as a punishment for


which you will most likely have to carry your horse’s head,
which you will feel the effects of in a long ride. -Next
comes the saddle, the greatest difficulty of all. What lady
who has ever ridden a long journey, especially if she hap-
pens to be a tolerable weight, does not remember the
misery of sore backs, and the constant inclination to slip oil
on the near or stirrup side, causing her to be incessantly
pushing herself over to the off side to keep her balance.
This arises from the absurd shape of the ordinary side-
saddle, which may be remedied to a small extent if a piece
of cloth or an old carpet be doubled a few times, and placed
as a pad under the fork of the saddle-tree on the near side,
and then girthing up, with a strong hand, as tight as pos-
sible. Saddlers, lam bound to say, study ornamentation
more than comfort. ..
A comfortable side-saddle should be stuffed one-halt
more on the near side than on the off, so that, when placed
on the horse’s back, it should have an inclination to the off
side, which, when the lady is mounted, will bring it down
to its proper place, give the rider a comfortable seat, and
prevent galling withers or croup. The seat should never
be of smooth leather or all over hogskin, as the trade are
so fond of informing you, as if all over hogskin meant all
over glory. For a strong, useful or every-day sadddle,
nothing can be better adapted for the seat than our own
colonial kangaroo : mind the flesh side out. For more
expensive saddles, I recommend buckskin, which prevents
slipping, but is troublesome, always requiring cleaning
with pipeclay, which is apt to come off on the habit, or the
seat in the course of time becomes slippery. I know, per-
sonally, that Queen Adelaide of lamented memory, as
well as Princess Victoria, used saddles with velvet seats
as being the least liable to slip, but I think that plush
would be a firmer and much more lasting seat. I have
recently had made a few saddles of the above materials by
a first-rate mechanic who, luckily, was not too conceited to
take a hint from an old riding-master. The first lady (a
well-known equestrienne) who rode one exclaimed, “I have
been accustomed to horse exercise for years, but I never
knew the luxury of it before: I have always felt more or
less uncomfortable, but now I feel as if I could not fall.
I am in justice bound to state that they are made by Blake,
of Bourke-street, Melbourne, and their cost is considerably
less than the imported Peter Pindars ; and so “Advance
Australia.” A newly-stuffed saddle will always come down
with a week or fortnight’s work, so be careful to see that
you can freely pass three fingers between the throat of the


saddle and your horse’s withers, and two between the eantle
or back part of the saddle and his loins. It is better to
wear a crupper, if your horse has been used to one, as it
prevents the saddle rolling and thereby chafing his back,
but don’t attempt it on a strange horse, as nothing sets them
kicking so viciously. In walking, or quiet cantering, you
may use one hand (the left of course), but when in danger,
or taking a leap, have the right hand always ready to take
up the right rein. Keep your toes turned in close to the
saddle, pointed rather downwards ; in danger, bring them
as far back as possible : this will give you a firm grip of
the horns of your saddle, which should always have the
extra one, or leaping head as it is sometimes called.
In a well-written article on horsemanship in the last
edition of the Excursionists’ Handbook, I see it stated that
the snaffle is the true and proper bridle for all occasions.
This is going rather too far ; give everything its proper
place. The writer has evidently been accustomed to ride
across country, and not to teach. He talks of himself and
for himself when he says that a snaffle-bridle, without a
martingale, but simply two rings, is sufficient for all pur-
poses. He is right as far as he goes, but he goes such a
very short journey ; it is all very well for a light-mouthed
horse in the field, with a pair of powerful arms to haul
away with ; but for a lady with a delicate hand, nothing
can be superior to the curb, both for controlling your hors<?
and making him carry himself stylishly. Having said so
much, we will proceed to business.
First, to mount. Previous to mounting, walk quietly
up to your horse’s head (never behind), speak to him, gently
pat him, and smooth him down the face, see yourself that
your girths are tight, and the bridle put on properly. If
your horse is at all fidgety, two persons should be in attend-
ance ; one should stand in front of the horse, holding the
bridle by the snaffle rings to keep him steady, for should
he move, which is very apt to be the case at the moment
of the spring, not only is the seat not gained, but the effect
of coming suddenly to the ground is often painful. The
person who is to assist the lady to her saddle, now places
his left hand under her left foot, his right hand flat under
her left arm, she holding the pommel with her right
hand, she makes a spring and is easily placed—however
heavy on her horse. She should then pick up her reins
in the centre with her right finger and thumb, drawing
them through her left hand, with the back upwards, until
she gets them to the right length, the spare part of the
reins to be dropped on the off side of the horse’s neck, the


right knee thrown over the pommel, and the left foot placed
in the stirrup just sufficiently long for the knee, when the
toe is pressed down, to touch the safety horn. The lady
should take care, before mounting, that her attendant has
not placed his foot on her habit-skirt, as in such case the
habit would be most likely torn, besides the danger of an
awkward tumble.
In dismounting, there is not the slightest occasion for
the attendant to open his arms to receive you, which of
course with certain persons would be objectionable, hirst
of all, throw your right leg out of the crutch, then see that
your habit is perfectly free from the horns, place your right
hand on the pommel, and your left having a portion of your
habit in it (sufficiently pulled up to see your toes) on the
assistant’s shoulder, when you may slide slowly to the
ground without further trouble. If necessary, he may
place his right hand under your arm, as in mounting, and
lower you gradually down.
In putting your horse into a canter, the first movement
is to advance the bridle hand towards his head, thus giving
him freedom, bend gently forward from the hips, and with
a slight tap of the whip on the off shoulder or flank, he will
at once, if properly broken, assume the canter. Should he
go too fast, throw the body well back in the saddle, and,
if necessary, shorten your reins, and put the right hand up
to assist the left. Should you overdo it, and he breaks
into a trot, you must again ease the hand and apply the aid
as at first.
The trot is the most difficult pace to obtain anything
like success in, and is only accomplished gracefully by first-
class horsewomen ; in fact, no written instructions would
be of any service ; tuition and nothing but long and con-
tinued practice will enable a lady to rise and fall with every
second step, so essential to the comfort and appearance of
the rider. The only advice I can give on paper is, before
attempting it, lengthen your stirrup a hole or two ; the
position on horseback should always be perfectly upright,
with the shoulders square to the front; the eyes looking
straight between your horse’s ears, carefully looking out
for vehicles, obstructions, road holes, etc.
In halting from a canter, let the body be thrown well
back, and both hands applied firmly to the reins, so as to
bring him up on his haunches, thereby avoiding ten or
fifteen yards of an unpleasant bumping trot. Keep your
elbows close to your sides, with the right arm, when
not engaged with the rein, hanging down without stiff-
ness. Never lift your arm or whip above your head, as it


is not only unnecessary but outre in the extreme. By a
little practice, the horse can be punished sufficiently by
lifting the forearm from the elbow only. In turning to the
right, tap your horse gently with the whip just on the flank;
whenturnmg to the left, strike him on the right or off
shoulder : this will assist you materially, as the animal will
always recede from where he is struck.
I am afraid time and space will not permit my going
any further at present into this interesting subject, but if
anything I have said may be the means of rescuing beauty
from ridicule or mishap, I shall be amply repaid and Well
Melbourne Laudek > Riding Master, Stephen-street,
ABOUT COLONIAL DRIVING.
There is scarcely anything that strikes the new arrival in
Australia (especially if possessing sporting proclivities)
more forcibly than the utter absence of style and system
m everything connected with driving. The residents of
Sydney, Adelaide and Melbourne may be said to in-
elegantly resemble each other in this particular.
At present I am frequently compelled to pass through
the streets of Melbourne and cannot but notice the ignorant
manner in which horses are hauled about by fellows call-
ing themselves coachmen, from the well-to-do merchant
who “fancies himself,” and drives his own pair into Town
down to the butchers’ and bakers’ boys, it is a fact that
not more than one in ten know how to hold their reins right
and few are sufficiently sagacious to keep their proper
side of the road, which accounts for most of the accidents
reported in the newspapers. Should you attempt to show
colonial drivers a better way than predominates they in
many cases indignantly protest against instruction Shure
and they have been dhrivin off and on for the last so many
years and its poor work if they don’t know how to hould
their reins by this time. Surely if the British people can
claim superior knowledge in anything it is in their success
in breeding, breaking, riding, and driving horseflesh. It
is not that the voyage washes out the knowledge but the
class of people exported never acquired the art of drivino-
before leaving the old country. The man who drives his
four-in-hand, pair, or tandem at home does not visit these
colonies. Neither do first-class coachmen or well-trained
grooms. These classes of persons who know their bus-


inesses to the minutest details do better at home than
here. With the exception of a few picked men (brought
out by Governors and one or two rich colonists) who do
their work right and can be identified at a glance, we have
few amongst us to look up too as a pattern. Certainly
once or twice a year you may see a Watson or a Bowes
and one or two others who seem to know what they are
about and who put one in mind of what used to be, but
these are the few and rare exceptions.
The origin of what I complain of is easily discovered.
A successful tradesman or merchant starts a carriage (the
first of his family probably) and advertises for a coachman.
Fifty raw emigrants apply for the situation, all profess-
ing thorough knowledge of the requirements. One is
engaged. When the horses come to be put too, the success-
ful party finds that the new coachman knows as much
about the matter as he does himself which is simply noth-
ing at all. To hide his own ignorance he considers it the
best policy to make as few remarks as possible, but when
he finds the hames buckled on the collar upside down
dubiously suggests that it does not seem to fit. So they
peg away. The coachman clawing his reins with one
thumb stuck over each ear and incapable of controlling his
horses with the smartness necessary in a crowded thorough-
fare. The error committed at first is confirmed by long
use, others copy, and in a few years wrong becomes right.
Look at the buggies and many other carriage nuisances.
What old British gentleman would condescend to a seat
only nine inches high, his knees up to his chin, his horse’s
tail within a sensation of his nose, light trashy harness
snapping like pack thread on the least extra exertion, and
his body within kicking distance of the heels. Add to
these blessings, wheels so close together that he can neither
get in or out unless the miserable wriggling machine is
perfectly stopped and the horse slewed half round. It is
not only the painful and ridiculous position of the driver,
with his legs cramped and his body bent but he can have
no command over his horse, hence so many accidents.
Such is the present colonial fashion introduced by Amer-
ican speculators in cheap trash. If a machine only seems
light it is considered to be all right. Give up every com-
fort, every conformity to decent appearance, risk a smash
and’its consequences, so long as you can vulgarly face
everything on the road
For the public safety no person should be allowed to
drive a carriage of any description within a certain distance
of a large town without passing an examination and get-


ting a certificate of his competence to do so. One hour’s
teaching is sufficient to make the most stupid person
understand the rules of driving which a little practice after
will perfect.
Numerous books have been published on the art at
prices within the reach of all. I shall therefore not
attempt here to give advice or instruction. But every man
before commencing to drive a horse should get some one
who understands driving to give him a half-hour’s spin.—•

Bowls. —This old-fashioned, healthful and friendly
out-door pastime was established as a Public Amusement in
Victoria by Mr. John Campbell at Windsor in 1864, by
the formation of a club called the Melbourne Bowling Club,
and so popular did the game at once become that the estab-
lishment of clubs at St. Ivilda, Fitzroy, West Melbourne,
Carlton, and two at Richmond, rapidly succeeded each other.
The grounds of the Melbourne Bowling Club are pleasantly
situated at Windsor adjoining the railway station, (are the
freehold property of the club,) and consist of two greens,
one for summer use, 160 feet long by 120, the other espec-
ially raised and prepared for use in winter is 120 by 120.
The green is open to the members for play all the year
round. Attached is a comfortable pavilion, refreshment
room, lavatory, &c. The public are admitted daily after
two o’clock p.m. to inspect the grounds.
The Upper Yarra—lts Boat-Builders and Boat-
Houses. —Should any old resident after an absence of a
few years re-visit that most modern of great cities, Mel-
bourne, and from Prince’s bridge behold the ever-flowing
river placidly gliding to the lower Falls, unpolluted by the
defilements which it will erewliile reach, he cannot but be
astonished at the remarkable change which has come over
the genius of the scene. As the last Minstrel said—
View each well known scene,
Think what is now, and what hath been.
I remember when the proprietor of the pile of buildings
which strikes the eye of the onlooker from the bridge, (Mr.
James Edwards) first erected his “ steam-boat waiting-
room,” it was some fifteen years since, and there were in
those times mimic steam boats plying between Prince’s bridge
and Cremorne Gardens. Edwards had purchased the fore-
deck house of the Expert, steamer, and transformed it into
a temporary dwelling with a waiting-room attached, which
together with a commodious landing stage was a great
accommodation. This he followed by the purchase of a


few boats, and having been an experienced Thames (Lon-
don) waterman, his advice and assistance in training and
in teaching rowing was sought for by our amateur oarsmen,
and enabled “ Jemmy Edwards,” as he was then familiarly
called like Norval’s father, to increase his store. The
next step towards the formation of his vast boat-building
establishment (en passant, it has no equal on the Thames)
was the initiation of the Melbourne Rowing Club, for the
accommodation of which, Edwards erected a very large
boat-house, replete with every convenience. This was,
however, nearly destroyed by the cyclone prophesied by
Saxby, and by the great flood of ’63 ; but Edwards, with a
persevering energy, surmounted all difficulties, and as
rowing came into favor—a reaction after a plethora of
cricket—-and regattas were largely patronised, so did his
business expand till it has assumed its present gigantic
dimensions—undoubtedly the largest in the Australian
colonies. The river above the bridge formerly presented,
as it does now half a mile beyond the boat sheds, its silvery
reflection of the sky on its placid bosom, as on a mirror,
save when a slightly angry wind disturbed its smoothness ;
but its surroundings are wonderfully changed. Where
formerly all was peaceful, pastoral and blooming, the busy
hammers of the boat-builders’ shops are now heard, only
varied by the launching or landing of the crack club boats ;
nor is this to be wondered at when we find that Edwards
has to supply accommodation for six or seven aquatic clubs,
and is building boats for almost every regatta of importance,
and for most matches. For instance, the boat in which
our ’Varsity crew achieved so unexpected a victory at
Sydney, and the boat sent to Hobart Town for the Inter-
colonial Champion Gig Race, open to all colonies, three gigs
for the Sydney Rowing Club, two for Swan River, and two
for Freemantle, were all built under his direction, by the
best workmen from England, of the best material, and on
the latest and most approved models ; and as his boats have
been very fortunate, it is not surprising that he is patronised.
To meet the growing demand there has been recently erected
a leviathan boat-house, 62ft by 100 ft, with four entrances,
a second floor for show-rooms, meetings, baths, dressing
rooms, and every other appliance for a boating club-house.
This building being now completed Mr. Edwards will feel
honored by a visit from any members of clubs, or by the
lovers of aquatic sports from the colonies or from Old
England. I, in conjunction with all admirers of colonial
enterprise, wish him the success in his business which he so
eminently deserves. — aquarids.


EQUESTRIANISM.
Observing the extent to which horse exercise is affected
among us, and searching among our litterateurs for exponents
of our social feeling envers les chevaux, we find in Newton
Goodrich’s “ Married in Black ” some lines which, if we
prefix their burden as a title, run thus—
THE OLD GREY HACK.
Steady, Bob ! nay ! from thy floundering race
With thyself thou should’st fall to a firm, dainty pace !
—Thou can st not, for old age, alack !
Thou’rt brave as thou’rt gentle !—thy gallop’s for fun !
Or to show what, in times that are past, thou hast done !
Though small thy pretentions—no prize hast thou won—
Thou’rt only ‘ Our Old Grey Hack I ’—
—Yet—many a weariness, sorrow, disgust,
Or vexation, of mine hast thou cast, with the dust
Of thy heels, to the winds at my back !
And many a joke, or wise word, or kind look
Had I missed—or steep glade, or still vale, or wild brook,
Or flower-gemmed verdure-set, joy-lighted nook—
Without thee, good ‘Old Grey Hack !’
When somewhat ‘ used up,’ and ‘ life ’ seems ‘ a mistake,’
For the coach-whirl and waggoner’s whistle I make,
Where the Post-horn enlivens the tract.
And notes of the song-birds and horse-bells abide,
And farmers look after their hay-loads with pride,
And sunny, smiled greetings of market-maids glide
After me and thee, ‘ Old Grey Hack !’
When rankles my thought, through some friendship estranged-
bome loved one departed—some fair prospect changed—
Some hate, come my spirit to rack—
Some loss of content with myself or my lot—
Of power some smooth villian’s use, or what not—
How I steal off 1 to ride them all down, in a trot
To the fields thou well know’st, ‘ Old Grey Hack 1’
And when friends have lauded my rhymes, with a hint
So like pity ! —at years that should pass ere I print,
While foes vowed for rhymes I’d no knack,
How I’ve pitied the pity, or laughed at ill-will,
As I’ve cantered away, vain enthusiast still,
To be kissed into song by the breeze on this hill
Or embraced by yon woods, ‘ Old Grey Hack !’
Up ! Soho ! Steadily ! —How the scene dreams.
Here, in tableland-slumber ! —the distant hum seems—
faint-coming, o’er the expanse—
Ihe, low sigh of its Spirit,—whose murmur appals,
As mid the lone silence it solemnly falls
<Jn thought of the hush when the Death-angel calls
Our loved and lamented ones hence !
? tlll steadily!—Here the road dips,
atn the trees, to the turn where the little bridge skips
a„j uaisy-banked creek and cascade,—
O’pr th J tr o £? U n ds the hill whence the village-cots peep
By the littWn^v? t-crossed river, and climbs where the steep
In broad 3 u Cro '!! ie ? oer vvhich £ reen will °ws heap V
uroad masses their quivering shade.


—And now we go down from ‘ The Traveller’s Rest,’
’Mid a canopy’s leaf-dropping whispers, to test,
Where it coolingly crosses the way
At the bottom, the fussy old brook’s tiny force, —
And anon—wait to look o’er the low fence of gorse
Where Pilgrims repose, at the close of life’s course,
Round the House where they’d halted to pray.
************
—How stilly she sleeps—’neath her grass covered mound—
By this Little, Lone Church-with the holy gloom round,—
Gloom which grows, as I gaze on it, black !
—Twas hard,—oh, God ! hard I—She .'—my loved when a boy—
Who’d counsel my manhood —and fly to employ
Her frail strength to defend me, or find me a joy !
—There!—get along ! Old ‘Grey Hack ! ’
Now, Newton Goodrich’s verses, and the poetical effusions
of others who might be mentioned, are, we suspect (because
such things almost always are), the public, general, sym-
pathetic expressions of individual feelings which are the
outcomes of the various phases of colonial love of horse-
flesh, and, since, by pen and practice, a wide-spread fondness
for the saddle is indicated, our readers will we think be
neither surprised nor displeased to find us adding, as in
this year’s “ Guide,” from time to time, fresh paragraphs
to our old
HINTS ABOUT HORSES.
Bran and chaff make the proper food for saddle-horses from
whom only a good brisk pace is required or expected—
that is, perfectly sweet, good chaff, and coarse, bright, clean-
looking bran,—but, as neither are likely to be always up to
the mark in quality, it is best to make it a rule to secure
something like quality in them by putting to every bushel
of bran three quarts of crushed oats and three pints of
crushed maize. One measure of this bran-mixture and two
measures of chaff make as strong manger-feed as should
ever be given to saddle-horses used for ordinary purposes,
and if given to them well mixed and well wetted four times
a day, with a pound of chopped carrot in it each time, the
horse will love you (of course if you give him enough), and
he’ll most likely never have the gripes even if he lias a
constitutional tendency to them ; —you won’t have to give
him much water —he’ll neither require it nor seek it.
Find out what makes the largest carrot-flavoured meal
of this kind that your horse will, without stopping, eat
clean up to the last morsel, four times per day for a week,
and then rely upon it that a little (only a little) less than
that will be the proper quantity to keep him in health,
strength and spirits.


Never cram a horse’s comparatively small stomach with
extra food because he has been doing a little extra work.
Never after midday attempt to refresh a heated and
tired horse by hosing or washing his legs with cold water—
it may check the perspiration and give him cold, and in the
horse, as in the human, gripes and cholic are as often brought
on by catching a little cold as by anything.
When your horse comes oif a journey take him at once
into the stable—slip the halter on, throw a small bit of old
dry cornsack, or something of the sort, over the hollows
where his loins join his hips—take a wisp of hay, or an old
dry rag, and give him a brisk rub all over, especially be-
tween his ears—about his head—under his throat—over
his neck—and his chest, right down between his fore legs.
You need not be five minutes about it. You won’t have
rubbed the sweat off—you won’t have rubbed him dry; but
the friction will prevent his chilling, and he’ll cool down
without catching cold. Don’t smother him up with cloths—
cloths are of no use except to make coats shine without the
trouble of good grooming, or in cases of sickness.
If your conscience tells you that you ought to do some
thing to refresh his “ poor feet,” and legs, after a fatigu-
ing journey, dab a few little bits of soft soap about them—
dip a hard brush into a little hot water and brush the soap
into lather, especially about the pasterns and under the
fetlocks, and leave him, with the thick strong lather on
his legs and feet, in peace and quiet, to his meal. Re-
member—his meal is supposed to be mixed and wetted
ready for him when he comes home, so that he digs his
nose into it the instant the halter is on his head. Turning to,
at once, to a hearty meal will be almost sure to prevent
an over heated and wearied man or horse from catching
cold, —as a preventive it’s more effectual than a stiff glass
of grog—though we don’t always object to the grog for
either man or beast. Cold water to brush and wash the
soap out of the legs and feet next morning.
If you have a horse such as Hotspur describes, and
great speed is required, and required always, and less flesh
and more muscle are desirable, crushed oats must be re-
sorted to, and given liberally and very methodically,—but
remember—very few good horses are very quiet if they
have been fully fed for the last six weeks upon oats, unless
they are old or hard-worked. The first mentioned bran-
mixture-carrot-and-chaff feed is I know, from long exper-
ience, capital for keeping a sadd/e-horse, without much
expense, in flesh, health, spirits, and wind. A horse kept
for such a purpose as I have supposed and in the way I


have recommended should have no hay given ft to munch
a horse with a fresh bellyful up a hill,—
do you think our poet, Newton Goodrich would serve his
“ Old Grey Hack” so ? How would you like to be served
go ? It would break your wind, / know. _
To find out whether a horse is vicious, feed him on
stimulating food for a month, and let him have little to do—
he may then have too much spirit for you—may trouble-
some—too full of pranks—but if he shows no spitefulness
you may trust him after,—it will he easy to steady him by
giving him a little more work, or lowering the quality of
his feed.
Morning WALics.-These should never exceed about
10 miles, though Dickens used to extend them to 25. To
enioy them they should be arrived at gradually. 3 miles
?o begin with, then 5, then 7, and then 10. Beginning with
3 on the first of a month, 10 miles are easily done towards
the end of it, and done with an invigorating pleasure to
which the non-pedestrian is a stranger. If a companion
can be got who is equally good on his pins the walk is
thereby shortened to one half. It sounds Hibernian to say
so but it is nevertheless true that company makes so
pleasant the path of life that both figuratively and on the
road the journey is shortened imperceptibly. W e deduce
from that that a married man’s life must seem to be in
length half only of that of the single handed bacheloi. The
W wav to enjoy a 10 miles walk is to vary on each
occasion of going out. To that end a map of Melbourne
and suburbs should be taken and a circle drawn around it,
the radiating lines of which should be about five miles long.
About 25 of these lines could be drawn and they should be
each walked down and retraced by those who would see
with what real prettinesses our city is surrounded,
specify them all would be to deprive our pedestrian of the
honor and glory of their discovery. Nothing adds to a
pleasure like the zest of finding out a new road.
Our Twelve Drives published in the Guide to Excursionists
from Melbourne may be shortened into twive walks, at
pleasure, and will be found to offer a variety that even to
that small extent many amongst us do not think of.
Boerhave, that first of physicians, has told us that no exercise
calls into play so many muscles as walking does.

Music, as an evidence of the refinements of our social
life, occupies a prominent position amongst our in-door
amusements. The societies whose titles we give number
many hundreds of conscientious amateurs on their muster
rolls, and their performances generally are of an order
that speaks well for the future prospects of music as an art.
There can be little doubt that many happy influences,
climatic and' otherwise, will be the means of producing
from amongst our people singing voices of the very
highest order. The following is a list of our local musical
societies, exclusive of numerous classes in the hands of
private teachers :

Yachting until lately has been almost unpractised by
Melbournites which is much to be wondered at, when
taking into consideration the facility offered for that sport
in the Hobson’s Bay. The chief obstacle however lies in
the great expense one must needs incur in bay yachting.
To be perfectly safe and comfortable no vessel under 15
tons is fit for a cruise round the Bay, as the sudden and
violent change in the weather so often occuring there,
renders sailing in a small craft a very dangerous under-
taking. The Victoria Yacht Club has lately been inaug-
urated and already possesses some 17 yachts, the greater
number of which however are small, but the promoters
appear to be actively moving in the matter, and no doubt
ere long it will become a “crack club.” Another club has
also lately started on that beautiful sheet of water, the
Albert Park Lagoon, hitherto so strangely neglected. On
a summer’s day sailing on this lake, the view from it is
exceeding pretty, with the Government house reserve to
the east, St. Kilda to the south-east and the Albert Road
to the north. A sum of £6500 has been voted by the
Government for the deepening of the lagoon, and improve-
ments to the Park in the shape of a carriage drive, planting
trees, seats for ladies, &c., and when this is completed, it
will without doubt become the most fashionable resort in
Victoria, in fact the equivalent in Melbourne of the
Serpentine in London. The club is styled the Albert
Park Yacht Club, and although but recently in existence,
already numbers about 60 members. Several of whom
own private boats, and after these are entered, the boats
required to make up a race are hired by the club from boat-
proprietors. Great activity has been displayed in the
formation of this club, and it will in time without doubt
take a leading position in the aquatic world. The lagoon
has this to recommend it, viz., there is not sufficient depth
of water to drown a body, but ample space for learning
boat-sailing, and also for masters in the art to display their
skill in handling a boat. To suit the depth of watar the
yachts are of necessity small and cannot afford to carry
much ballast, and in a breeze, if not well managed are
bound to capsize. It is a capital school to turn out yachts-
men hereafter for the bay sailing clubs. Another great
advantage it possesses is that the public can see a race from
start to finish while leisurely strolling round the Park or
seated on the banks.
The Gardens of the Horticulturat, Society of
Victoria.— There are comparatively few people acquainted


■with the Richmond Park : still fewer, we believe are aware
of that delightful retreat, the pleasant gardens of the
Horticultural Society. The park in which they are enclosed
was known of old as the Survey Paddock, but modern
advancement has given new features, —a railway and a
garden, and fashion has given to it a new name. All the
old “ paddocks ” are disappearing under their new guises
and more aristocratic names of “ parks,” and by and by we
shall stare at the old “ chum who talks of the “ Survey
Paddock,” or the “ Richmond Paddock.” Apart from the
many natural beauties of the landscape, these gardens have
an especial interest for every colonist. Being formed for
purposes of experimental horticulture, the Council of the
Society is collecting here every fruit tree known to the
world and suitable to this climate. Here are planted out
hundreds of varieties of apples, pears, apricots, cherries,
vines, plums, peaches, nectarines, figs, strawberries, etc.
When the truth of each variety is proved, the tree is
planted out to form a permanent standard of comparison,
and as a guide to persons about to plant orchards, etc.
In a register, kept at the Gardens, is regularly entered
every particular respecting each tree : its peculiarities of
growth and its general adaptability to the climate are noted,
-tfith remarks upon other phenomena, such as attacks of
blight, etc. Being intended for practical usefulness, not
very much has been done towards ornamental planting.
Still, there are some beautiful borders devoted to flowers
and shrubs, and some of the finest specimens of trees adapted
for decorative planting may be found here in perfect
luxuriance. This portion of the Gardens is kept distinct
from the fruit garden, and an hour cannot be better spent
than in a saunter round its well-kept parterres. When the
new garden is planted, Richmond Park will prove still more
attractive and interesting. The Richmond cars from
Swanston-street put down passengers at the Hawthorn
Bridge, fare 3d., and the Gardens are about half-a-mile
south of the Bridge. A long avenue of pines and elms
extends from the gates of the paddock to the railway
crossing at Picnic Station, and the white gates of the old
gardens are a few hundred yards further on. The land
enclosed for the new gardens adjoins the railway line, and
the whole reserve is nearly encircled by the Yarra Yarra.
The Health of Melbourne.— As a city, take it in
all, Melbourne is a healthy place, notwithstanding the
endeavors to create fevers and bring on pestilence by
unhealthy manufactures in and around it, and on the banks


of the Yarra, which river, so far as filth is concerned,
resembles old Father Thames; but fortunately for the
Melbourne public it is a short river, compared to the
Thames, or it would ere now have dealt death around with
no sparing hand. As it is, the constant flow of the river
carries its impurities into Hobson’s Bay, and, unlike the
Thames, does not return its foul contents. There can be
no doubt that Melbourne would be more healthy than it is,
if it were rid of the foul and offensive manufactures carried
on, and such fevers as we have, there can be little doubt,
are caused by unhealthy smells. Melbourne, as a rule, is
favored by constant changes of wind and few calms ; but
for this fact, the attempts of man to change the pure air
God has been pleased to give us, into one of death-giving
properties would be fearful to contemplate ; it being an
observed fact that cholera is far worse in calm than in
windy weather. The Melbourne public would be wise
were they to remove all unhealthy manufactures out of
town, and the Werribee would be about the best place to
remove them to; for though at present we do not suffer
from very great sickness, yet the outflow of the Yarra is
laying up in store for us in Hobson’s Bay a deposit of foul
mud that will fill up the Bay in a few years and cause
much sickness, for even now unwholesome vapors arise,
causing sickness on board the vessels tying on its blackened
waters. There are four causes by which Hobson’s Bay is
filling up : Ist, the silt brought down by the Yarra ; 2nd,
the mud deposited by the dredging punts just outside the
Bay, which foolish and slovenly plan of getting rid of the
material dredged up, has been carried on for years, although
this practice was brought under the notice of the Govern-
ment, and condemned by the then Admiralty Marine
Surveyor, some years since ; 3rd, material brought down
from the Geelong outer harbor, and along the coast; 4th
and last, by dust storms. The low land around Melbourne
is likely to produce sickness, as it is often covered with
water; but should banks be formed around the outer edge
of these flats, and self-reefing windmills be placed at various
points with pumps to drain the water from the land ; not
only would it tend to make Melbourne more healthy, but
the land would become valuable for building upon. The
Dutch would take us to be a very foolish people, were they
to see us attempting to fill up our Bay with mud, instead
of raising banks to shut out the water from the low-lying
land, and thereby increase our health. Should any serious
sickness arise, there are several very healthy localities on
the Bay, where the sick could retire to gain health and


strength; but unfortunately at present the means of
arriving there are limited, slow, and expensive. Were a
railway laid down along the coast line of the eastern side
of Port Phillip, persons would be enabled to travel, at a
rapid and cheap rate to Mordialloc, Frankston, Mornington,
Dromana, and Point Nepean, which last is unrivalled for
health both as regards its proximity to the pure sea air, its
sandy and limestone formation, and its excellent and safe
bathing grounds. A short voyage across the water, from
Point Nepean, would enable those who wished it, to take a
trip to QueensclifE where, close under its lighthouses, pass
the shipping to and from Port Phillip. A railway even to
Frankston, over the level ground between the Brighton
Beach Station, and the pretty coast between it and Mor-
dialloc, thence to Frankston, would be of great benefit, by
shortening the coach and steam-boat traffic, not only to the
places mentioned, but to Phillip Island, and a large portion
of the County of Mornington. The expense would be
comparatively small, and the profits large. Money may be,
and is often, of great use to man ; but what is wealth
compared to health ? Change of air is one great means by
which the health of man is promoted. Who that has for
a time left the busy town to revel and drink in the pure air
of fields and woodlands, or has wandered on the sea-shore,
gazing on the mighty ocean, with its storm-tossed billows,
bringing with it health and pleasure, has not returned to
the town strengthened and refreshed.
The Refreshment-rooms on the Victorian Railway
lines are let for two years, from the Ist July, 1873, to the
following persons : —Melbourne, J. W. Baines ; Geelong,
T. Asche ; Kyneton, C. Sampson ; Sandhurst, Honner ;
Ballarat, W. Irvine ; Castlemaine, 11. Caulfield ; Echuca,
J. Johnson ; Sunbury, J. R. Cathie ; Williamstown, J.
Purcell. The refreshment rooms at Footscray, Werribee,
and Woodend are closed.

FAVORITE OUTINGS.
Brighton Beach, 10 miles, is the furthest beach out-
ing from Melbourne, which can be conveniently and cheaply
reached by aid of the suburban railways. It is also a
favorite drive from Melbourne by way of St. Kilda, along
the road to the Elsternwick Hotel, turn to the right and
pass through Brighton on to the Esplanade, where there are
several good hotels. You need not return the same way
exactly. To Brighton Beach by rail or otherwise may be
said to be a very favorite outing from Melbourne.
Cheltenham, 12 miles from Melbourne, on the
Schnapper Point Road, is conveniently situated when a
longer drive is undesirable. Host Etheredge of the Exchange
Hotel, is very willing to take care of Excursionists from
Melbourne.
Ferntree Gully, 21 miles. The route from Mel-
bourne is along the St. Kilda Road to the junction, then
turn to the left and along the Dandenong Road to Oakleigh,
and there take the road which branches to the left of the
turnpike gate. This is a delightful outing for a day or two,
and better still if a week or more can be spared to explore
the ranges. There is a comfortable hotel at the foot of the
gully.
Geelong. —A trip to Geelong, on the shores of pleasant
Corio Bay, is daily afforded by means of rail and steamboat,
the distance being by rail 45 miles; by water, 48 miles.
Kyneton on the Echuca line of railway is situated
about 50 miles from Melbourne and 2000 feet above it,
consequently the denizens of the metropolis of agriculture
in Victoria enjoy a cooler climate than those of the metro-
polis of the colony. Several favorite outings radiate from
Kyneton, notably the Hanging Rock near Mount Macedon,
the Reservoir close to Malmsbury, &c. There are the usual


number of hotels in Kyneton, amongst which the Royal Oak
is a well-known comfortable house ; between it and the
river Campaspe the proprietor has one of the most beautiful
gardens in the colony.
Lilydale, 25 miles from Melbourne, may be described
the vineyard outing. The usual way to go there is
through Kew, Nunawading, Ringwood, Brushy Creek, on to
Lilydale. A coach leaves the Star Hotel, Swanston-street,
Melbourne, daily at 8 o’clock in the morning, returning ffom
the Lilydale Hotel every evening. Parties driving there may
return to Melbourne by a different road to the one detailed
above. Host Lithgow is always willing to point the way
and give information about the district.
Little River on the Geelong and Ballarat line is the
nearest railway station to the You Yangs, the highest
point of which is known as Station Peak, where the view
is as extensive as it is varied. The Host of the Railway
Hotel ; Little River, attends to the comforts of fishing and
shooting parties and excursionists generally.
Mordialloc, distant 15 miles from Melbourne possesses
especially attractions for excursionists. Here the creek and
the road to the Heads meet close to the Bay. A coach runs
daily from Cobb’s office, Melbourne, to Mordialloc and a
bus meets trains at the North Brighton Station and runs to
and from Mordialloc. It is a good road all the way for
riding or walking. Those who travel there through Brighton
and Cheltenham should return to Melbourne by the Sea-Side
drive or vice versa.
Nepean. —Portsea is the name of a new watering-place
on the Bay in the parish of Nepean which is a narrow neck
of land stretching from Arthur’s Seat to Port Phillip Heads.
The first settlement in the colony of Victoria was made at
its western boundary three miles from Queenscliff and 36
from Melbourne. The routes there are, by steamboat from
Melbourne to Queenscliff, thence by the same steamer or a
sailing boat across the bay to Portsea, or by coach from
Melbourne to Dromana, thence by conveyance or on horse-
back along the beach. The steamer “Williams,” leaves
Melbourne for Queenscliff every Saturday and occasionally
at other times ; coach from Melbourne to Dromana daily.
Nepean has very interesting coast scenery and the best


fishing grounds in the bay are close at hand. On its ocean
coast, are abundance of crayfish, shellfish, seaweed, and
pretty shells; there are also calm sheltered nooks for bathing
which make it a delightful retreat during the summer
months. In the district hunting and shooting may be
enjoyed. Kangaroo and wild duck are very plentiful, the
latter about Christmas time. Ford’s Nepean Hotel, at
Portsea is a very comfortable house, and most conveniently
situated for excursionists from Melbourne.
Oak«,eigh is situated upon the main Gippslaud road,
ten miles from Melbourne and half way to the famed
Ferntree Gully, the great resort of pleasure seekers in the
summer time. The roads are good and the journey can be
accomplished in a day. Scenery unsurpassed in the County
of Bourke.
Queenscliff is the favorite watering-place on the Bay.
New Baths have been recently erected.
The Hanging Rock, near Woodend.—The shire
councils of Newham, Kyneton, and Romsey, are very
desirous that the Government should purchase, from the
present owner, a site of land, about four miles from Wood-
end, and six miles from Kyneton, and on which stands the
famous “ hanging rock ” which, according to a deputation
waiting on Mr. Casey, minister of lands, was a great
attraction to people in every part of the colony. The base
of the rock occupies about thirty acres, and it was suggested
that Government should purchase forty acres, so as to
allow a good access to the rock. The thirty acres had
been purchased by the present owner for £550, and £SO
would cover the outlay for all improvements which had
been made. The present owner was in the habit of charg-
ing a fee from picnic parties who visited the rock. It
was pointed out that the revenue of the railways was
benefited by reason of the many people who visited the
curiosity in question. After some conversation, Mr.
Casey said the deputation had better find out for what
moderate amount the owner would part with his land, and
when that was ascertained he should have a pleasure in
submitting the matter to his colleagues. He admitted that
the rock was one of the leading curiosities of the country,
and that the land on which it stood should not have been
sold.


The paths by the river between Prince’s Bridge and
Botanic Gardens Bridge are the best approaches to the
Botanic Gardens from Melbourne. The South path is
probably preferred at present, owing to its being shaded by
trees, especially near Brander’s half-way ferry-house, where
refreshments are sold in seated arbors. But when the
newly-planted trees by the North path grow tall enough to
afford shade that will assuredly become the preferred path
on account of the Baths and Refreshment house opposite the
Botanic Gardens, where boats may be hired, and the carriage
drive running parallel with the North path, which is already
generally spoken of as our future “ Rotten Row.”
Warrnambool. —To the excursionist, with time and
money at his command, a trip to the Westward will be
found one of the most enjoyable which this Colony affords.
Boasting of a climate like that of England ; of well built
and populous towns ; of a wealthy and thriving population;
and of perhaps the richest and most productive soil in the
world ; assuredly the Garden of Australia may be deemed
worthy of a visit. The tourist can journey thither, either
by land or sea. The former route will enable him to become
acquainted with the main features of Geelong, Winclielsea,
Birregurra, Colac, Stony Rises, Camperdown, and Terang.
Nor are these places the only objects of interest to the
stranger. Every mile reveals some new beauty, and the
“Lake country” offers attractions to the artist, the sports-
man, and the lover of nature. Warrnambool itself is a
thriving, well-built, and lively little town, pleasantly situated
on the coast. It is a convenient head-quarters for the
tourist, and many enjoyable excursions are to be accom-
plished within a day’s walk, ride, or drive. Tower Hill is
the Lion of the neighborhood. It is an extinct volcano,
situated in the centre of Lake Koroit, and is a most charming
spot for a picnic. This volcano, vomited forth in some
former age, the rich loam which now supplies not only our
markets, but those of the neighbouring Colonies, with the
celebrated Tower Hill potatoes. Fortunately for the lovers
of the picturesque, a potato looks better in the ground than
out of it, and the view from the summit of the chief crater
will rival, in our memories, many a dearly cherished one in
“ the old country.” Warrnambool may also be reached by
sea ; the passage, ventis secundis, being generally accom-
plished in about sixteen or seventeen hours


Portsea, and Point Nepean. —The charming water-
ing place known as Portsea, and closely adjacent to Point
Nepean, has only very recently sprung into note, but its
future popularity is assured on account of its very numerous
attractions. It faces a quiet bay completely surrounded by
cliffs, except where a path leads from the pier to the Nepean
Hotel, which lies in a picturesque valley within 300 yards
of the shore. The waters are called Ticonderoga Bay, but
to sailors and fishermen it has long been known as
Abraham’s Bosom, on account of the tranquil security it
affords in bad weather. To the south-west lies the
Sanitary station, which stretches to Point Nepean, and on
the east is Sorrento (two miles off); otherwise it is sur-
rounded by the sea, i. e , Port Phillip Bay on the one side
and Bass’s Straits on the other. The country is mostly
hill and dale, intersected by bush paths and clothed with
ferns and dwarf shrubs, such as scented wattle and tea-
tree. The opportunities for pleasure are unusually
numerous. Within a mile from the Nepean Hotel, in a
south-easterly direction, is the Back Beach which faces
Bass’s Straits. Here the shore scenery is such as is rarely
equalled. The cliffs are high, and at their foot are reaches
of sand strewn with good shells, and the finer kinds of sea-
weed. Stretching into the sea at short intervals are sand-
stone rocks of bold and eccentric outline and configuration.
The arched grotto known as “ London Bridge,” and the
rocks between that and Point Nepean, are in truth un-
commonly fine. Some of the best faery scenery painted by
Hennings for pantomime openings at the Theatre Royal,
are simple sketches from nature taken at the Back Beach.
When the tide is coming in the effect of the sea tumbling
and foaming through the caves and blow-holes is indescrib-
ably grand. Pic-nic parties to this point are of course
plentiful, for the distance is extremely easy both for ped-
estrians and vehicles. In respect to sea-fishing no place in
the colony affords better sport, for it is to the Portsea
waters the Queenscliff fishermen have to come. Glorious
“yellow-tailing” is here enjoyed in perfection ; schnapper,
whiting, pike, parrot-fish, gurnard, and all the better class
of Victorian edible fishes are here in abundance, and delicate
ladies are often the most successful with the lines, for the
sea is so quiet that they, being freed from the dread of sea-
sickness, can fish at their ease. With a rod and line there
is also famous sport to be had at the Back Beach, when the
tide is low. The angler stands on the table rocks which
are covered by the high tide, and fishes in the deep holes
as fast as the tide recedes to enable him to do so ; and he
almost always gets enough bites to keep him extremely


busy till the time of flood, when he must retire. Boating
is a popular amusement because the wind can rarely be so
very awry as to prevent a return to port. Kangarooing
and wild rabbit shooting offer employment to those who
have tastes that way, and those who love long walks can
ramble for hours through the glades and dells which lie
between Portsea and the extreme of Point Nepean.
Early Closing Association. — To this admirable
institution many of our community are indebted for the
opportunity which has been afforded them of enjoying a
health-giving and inspiriting half holiday on Saturday.
Before the Association came into existence, we might
look in vain for the shutters to be put up at any
retail establishment on Saturday afternoon. Now, we are
happy to find that through the well directed efforts of
the Committee, almost the whole of the leading
firms in the city give their employes the opportunity of
recuperating their physical powers without trespassing
on the sanctity of that day which most right minded
people object to convert into one of mere idleness or
amusement. We are glad to find that the members
of the Association are still exerting themselves with
considerable energy to cause the remaining firms of
the city to give the word for shutters to be put up
at two sharp on Saturday afternoon, so that their
young men and women may go to enjoy themselves
at any of the innocent recreations described in the
pages of this “guide.” We hope that every reasonable
man and woman in our community will assist the
Committee of the Early Closing Association in endeavoring
to achieve the wish of their hearts by causing all
places of business to be closed at six on ordinary days,
and two on Saturdays. Let us aim chiefly at trying
to convince the unthinking portion of humanity that
it would be for their own good to adopt the early
closing movement. If all would but make a firm
resolution to do their shopping before the hours men-
tioned above, we should soon find that shopkeepers
would not be so foolish as to keep open and have no
customers coming in. There would be neither fun
nor profit in consuming gas and wasting time merely
for the delectation of those brainless people who go
about for the sole purpose of gazing into shop windows.
Let all then do their shopping early on the first five
working days, and let Victorians proclaim it as a law
established by universal custom that Saturday shall be
a half holiday.


Werribee. — Excursion tickets to this place are issued
at cheap rates, especially on Saturdays, thanks to the
present Commissioner of Railways. The next place in
importance to the Saltwater River as a bream stream is the
Werribee, which the railway crosses about half way between
Melbourne aud Geelong. The Werribee is a tidal river up
to within a short distance of the station bearing its name,
and consequently bream may be caught within an easy
distance of that point; but if the angler wishes to have good
sport he must follow the river down for at least a couple of
miles. The tyro intending to try the Werribee would do
well to apply to Mr. Streat, the landlord of the Camp Hotel,
near the station, who for a small consideration will drive
him down to the best part of the river. To a person who
has plenty of time on his hands, the Werribee is the best
place to go to ; for he not only has a complete change of
chance of first-rate sport. If black-fish are preferred to
bream, they can be got in any number, and of good size,
about a couple of miles above the railway. There is
occasionally good shooting to be enjoyed in this neighbor-
hood on Mr. Chirnside’s stations between Geelong and
Melbourne but it is said that sportsmen must get his per-
mission, enquire of Mr. Streat at the Camp.
Yarra Flats, (Burgoyne), about 30 miles from Mel-
bourne, on the Woodspoint Road, possesses attractions for
excursionists and sportsmen. There is a coach from
Melbourne every other day. The Yarra Flats Hotel is a
first-class house kept by Mr. Batt.
Newton Goodrich’s New Volume. —We see by
advertisements that Newton Goodrich, the author of the
wild yarn, “ Raven Rockstrow,” and the clever polished
rhythms of “ The Martyrs of Myletene,” “ Married in
Black,” “ Angel-beckoned,” etc., etc., is again a candidate
for poetic honors. His forthcoming volume (a rather bulky
one, we are told) is already in the press and will appear
shortly. His numerous friends seem determined it shall
succeed, and, if talking Mall make it a success, a success it
will be. This time, it seems, we are to have a collection of
poems accompanying a sort of prose poem in dialogue
called “ Pitman’s Brief, or, The Stebbington Mystery—a
Dramatic Story,” some parts of which are spoken of by the
“ privileged ”as being very fine. We are not yet prepared
to endorse the confident declaration of Newton Goodrich’s
admirers that, he is the Victorian Poet par excellence , but
we are quite prepared to find that a volume by him has
added somewhat real and abiding to Victorian literature
and we look for its advent with interest.


Gallery op Paintings. —Lovers of art should not fail
to visit the gallery of artistic gems in connexion with
Messrs. Johnstone, O’Shannessy & Co’s photographic
rooms, next the Post Office. This unique collection is open
to the public free, and contains well chosen examples of
the modern English school of oil and water color painters,
which can be met with nowhere else in Melbourne. It
possesses the rare distinction of embracing nothing that is
either uninteresting or faulty in art, while the walls are
closely covered with works which no connoisseur can view
without pleasure. The proprietors invite the public freely
to visit their elegant little gallery.
French Quoits. —This game and several other amuse-
ments are to be had at Debeaux’s French gardens at Yarra
Bank, by the side of the Richmond Punt. As Madame
Debeaux states in her advertisements, these gardens,
though so near Melbourne, are “ trooly rooral.” We
excuse her French spelling, when we know how good her
meaning is. A row down the Yarra to these gardens, and
a glass of colonial wine, and an hour spent there puts one
in good trim for the row back, and what is better, in good
humor, too. ’Tis satisfactory to reflect on time well spent.
The ancients said that it constituted “ Euthanasia ” —that
pleasant dying that will come some day to us if we are
good.

THOMAS’S
GUIDEBOOK ADVERTISER.
The great advantage of this medium of advertising for
those who are desirous of communicating information to
Excursionists, Tourists and Travellers, can scarcely be
questioned as it enables Steam, Railway and other Public
Companies, Landlords of Inns, Tradesmen, and others, to
bring under the immediate notice of Tourists and others, in
the most direct way, the various merits of their Railways,
Steamers, Hotels, Taverns, Articles of Merchandize, Works
of Art, and such other information as they may desire to
make known. Instead of being limited to the casual
publicity of a daily, weekly, or monthly periodical, the
Handbook Advertiser has the additional merit of being
displayed in a permanent work of interest, and of perpetual
reference by the very class of persons for whom it is
specially intended. The charges are—a page, £3; half-
page, £1 15s. ; quarter-page, £l.

Sir,—We beg: to request that you will obtain for us an analysis of our Ales at
your earliest convenience; and to remove any impression on the mind of the public
that any particular sample or special brew should be placed in your hands for that
purpose, we will take it as a particular favor if you will call on any of the under-
mentioned customers, who are constantly supplied by us, and procure what samples
you require.

Messrs. E. Latham & Co., Carlton Brewery, Melbourne.
Gentlemen,—Agreeably to instructions conveyed in yours of the 25th inst.,
that I would make an analysis of your Ale, and, in order to remove any impression
that such only referred to some special brew, would collect samples myself from
your ordinary customers, 1 have to inform you that I purchased such samples from
five of the hotels mentioned.
These samples were all remarkably similar, having a specific gravity nearly
equal, and uniformly yielding six per cent of real alcohol when distilled. A pint
of the Ale left on evaporation about three-quarters of an ounce saccharine and ex-
tractive matter. All the samples were light-colored and clear, possessing a very
pleasant aromatic odour of the hop, combined with the agreeable bitterness char-
acteristic of good ales when only hops and malt are used.
I could not detect any difference between these and some from my own cel-
lar (having long been supplied through your agent with your ales for my own family
use); and I can, from personal experience as a consumer, vouch for the general
wholesomeness and purity of the ales I have examined from your establishment.
WILLIAM JOHNSON, Government Analytical Chemist.

“To sit a horse well, through all his paces ; firmly, yet gently, to control his
impatient curvettings ; fearlessly, yet elegantly, to manage him at speed, with a
hand firm, light; steadily, yet gracefully, to keep the seat; to unite courage with
gentleness ; and to employ energy at no cost of delicacy ; these are the essential
attributes of the lady-like and accomplished horsewoman.”—Mrs. Stirling
Clarke’s Eqsestrian Guide.
Jgg” Horse exercise is highly recommended by the most eminent medical men
for many complaints. Persons to the age of fifty may rest assured that they can
be taught to ride quiet horses without the least danger or difficulty ; the system
being, to do everything by degrees, quitely and safely.

THERE are Three Processes of Printing—by Type,
by Plate and by Stone. The first is the most
general useful and the least expensive, and was invented
during the fifteenth century. The second is the most
beautiful but also the most costly, and was discovered
nearly simultaneously with the first. The third
(chiefly used for ornamental purposes) first became
practised about the close of the last century. At the
printing office, 75 Little Collins Street West, Mel-
bourne the process most suitable is employed, or where
necessary the three combined by which means printing
is brought yet nearer to perfection than hitherto.
