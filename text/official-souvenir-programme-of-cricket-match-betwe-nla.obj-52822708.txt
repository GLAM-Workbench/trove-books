How The A.I.F. Team Originated.
By W. A. OLDFIELD.
(Australia's former champion Test ’keeper.)
(By courtesy of Messrs. Hutchinson & Co. Ltd., publishers of
“Behind the Wicket,” by W. A. Oldfield).
There can be no doubt that the high morale of the Australian
soldiers, in fact all British troops, was definitely maintained by the relaxa-
tion gained by indulging in some form of recreation at every opportunity,
and paramount amongst these sports was the grand old game of cricket.
Whilst awaiting their embarkation orders, the many thousands of
troops encamped in Egypt engaged themselves in cricket matches between
the various units.
Despite the excessive heat and the extreme glare of the Egyptian sun,
cricket was still played to the delight and benefit of everyone concerned.
The majoriy of these friendly matches were played on coir matting
over sand that had been watered and rolled hard. The outfield was sandy,
in fact we were surrounded by sand and hundreds of large tents, on the
edge of the desert.
On occasions, combined English sides comprised of the best perform-
ers from the garrison regiments, would meet a composite Australian side—
many keen tussles resulted. As far as I can remember, neither side
was much stronger than the other, each side having a fair share of vic-
tory.
After spending four months in Egypt our unit was transhipped to
England, and it was not long before I found myself in France. Despite
the sordidness of those days, nothing could kill our love for cricket, and
at every opportunity, war was forgotten temporarily in light-hearted
matches.
If it were not convenient to arrange matches with the infantry, artil-
lery, or other units, we played scratch games amongst ourselves. These
games were fought out in a most competitive spirit, and were most enter-
taining.
Our games, although they were played well within the constant roar
of guns, were a great relaxation and were consequently in popular de-
mand. While our division was moving towards Ypres for the great offen-
sive of 1917, we still played cricket, at almost every resting place.
In those circumstances we were not attired in cricket flannels. During
such matches in France we generally played in riding breeches, puttees,
khaki shirt and our heavy tan bools, but in the hotter climate of Egypt
our dress for cricket changed to khaki shorts, loose shirts, topees and

sand-shoes. Truly Kipling never visualised "playing fields” like these.
Much as we enjoyed these games played at intervals during the war,
in Egypt, France and England, the news of the Armistice re-awakened
the love for serious cricket and other sports. An event which was destined
to be of far-reaching importance to Australian Test Cricket, was the for-
mation of the Australian Imperial Force cricket team a few months after
the Armistice. My International cricket career began when I was ul-
timately chosen as a member of that team.
It was the intention of the Australian Cricket Board of Control to
organise a team of A.I.F. cricketers to tour England during the 1919
season, and the usual programme of fixtures was arranged. However,
owing to several players desiring to prolong their stay in England after
the war, the Australian and English cricket authorities would not under-
take the risk of financing a comparatively unknown team; consequently
the idea was abandoned.
It was then that the A.I.F. team was formed and became the respon-
sibility of the A.I.F. Sports Control Board. This Board was formed by
the Australian Military authorities in England to organise and control
sport of all branches undertaken by the troops in the various military
zones.
The selectors were E. J. Long, C. E. Pellew and R. L. Park, with C.
Docker and E. J. Cameron in an advisory capacity.
Our programme of matches against Great Britain comprised 34 first-
class matches, 15 of which were won, 15 drawn and the remaining 4 lost.
The successful performances of our team in England were, no doubt,
instrumental in an invitation being extended to us from the South African
Cricket Association.
In South Africa we played eight matches chiefly against the main
provinces. Six of the matches were won by us and the remaining two
games were drawn. Our tour through that hospitable country was suc-
cessful from every aspect, having cemented many happy friendships.
When I look back, as I often do, on the tour of the A.I.F. team in
1919, I feel I am looking back on one of the most enjoyable times I have
ever had. We had emerged from the horrors of war to the happy days of
peace—from the hardships of the trenches and bully-beef to the luxuries
of hotel life.
The tour was an unqualified success, not only from the point of view
of our team’s successes and experiences, but also from the viewpoint of
English county clubs, which benefited considerably financially. The spirit
of comradeship which developed during those months was one of the most
pleasing features of the tour, because it brought together on a common
level, officers and men of the ranks. A great spirit of camaraderie was
apparent almost from the team’s inception, and this invaluable asset of a
match-winning quality has been of inestimable help to Australia’s subse-
quent Test teams.

A GOOD SCORE standing alone
is a freak ! There should be
another one, and a better, and then
a better still ! Thus the player
establishes his reputation for con-
sistency and reliability.
So with the score in your Bank
Pass-book. If you saved so much
last year, you should do better this
year. The secret is simple—
Save Systematically I
Have a definite goal, a certain set
sum, and deposit a fixed amount in
the Bank every pay-day until you
reach your goal.

THE VALUE OF THE A.I.F. TEAM TO
AUSTRALIAN CRICKET.
Not only did the A.I.P. Team provide an outlet for the energies of
the members after their war experiences, but it also played a wonderful
part in the building up of Australian Test Teams. When these games
were resumed after the cessation of hostilities, England had suffered very
severely, not only through the death and incapacitation of prominent
players in the War, but through the loss of four years actual cricket in
England. The loss of this period meant that thousands of young- players
were deprived of a chance, which should have come to them at their
age, to develop into players of class. The result was that when the games
were resumed, England had to depend largely on her players of experience,
some of whom had reached the age when they could not be expected to
perform as they had previously done.
Australia too had her losses, the most notable being that of “Tibby”
Cotter, her great fast bowler, who was killed in Palestine, and R. J. A.
Massie, a great left-arm bowler, whose cricket was cut short by a war
injury.
It is in this respect that the A.I.P. Team proved of great value to
Australia. Some of the players such as Collins, Kelleway, Pellew and
Taylor had made their name to some extent before leaving for the War,
although only Kelleway had reached real eminence in the game. This
A.I.P. Team developed the powers of men like Collins, Taylor and Pellew,
and it brought to light in particular players hitherto unknown in Aus-
tralian cricket in Jack Gregory and Bert Oldfield and who, for years
afterwards, were among Australia’s greatest performers.
Gregory’s fast bowling, vigorous left-hand batting and wonderful slip
fielding, backed up by a remarkable personality, made him one of the
outstanding Australian cricketers of all time.
Bert Oldfield quickly fulfilled the promise that he gave with the A.I.P.
Team and took his place among the world’s greatest ’keepers. Many
consider that he was the equal of Jack Blackham, the “Prince of ’Keep-
ers,” and some think that he was even superior to the great Victorian.
One thing is certain, and that is, that Australia has never had a more
polished 'keeper or one less addicted to mannerisms, and she has never
had one who played the game more in the right spirit of cricket.
Of this team, Kelleway had Test experience, and the A.I.P. gave to
Australia new Test men in Gregory, Collins, Taylor, Pellew and Oldfield.
It is safe to say that neither Australia nor England has ever had a group
of new players the equal of these. The last of them to appear in cricket
was Oldfield, who held his position as wicket-keeper without dispute for
about 18 years and established a record among all wicket-keepers for the
number of his victims in Test cricket. Collins, a good batsman before
the War, became a great one after the War, even then his style was not
marked by many of the graces of batsmanship. Australia, however, has
had few better opening batsmen than he, and few more astute captains.
Gregory’s career was unfortunately made shorter than it should have
been by injury, but he came on the scene meteoretically just when Aus-
tralia needed another great fast bowler. Students of Test cricket are
never likely to forget the great fast bowling combination of J. M. Gregory
and E. A. McDonald on the 1921 tour of England. They literally mowed
down the English batsmen who were completely hopeless against them.
Of the other A.I.P. men, J. M. Taylor and C. E. Pellew were among
Australia’s greatest batsmen after the War and their outfielding on the
1921 tour of England was one of the things that sent English critics into
raptures.
Thus it will be realised, what a wonderful thing this A.I.P. Team was
to Australia. It was largely due to the doings of the men named that Aus-
tralia, in the last two or three Test series after the War, completely
Overwhelmed England.

The War Veterans’ Homes Trust
and its Objects.
It is now two years since the War Veterans’ Homes Trust of Victoria
was formed.
For an entirely unpreconceived new organisation with such a wide
conception and task to fulfill, its progress to date has been remarkable.
To many people, it is still unknown, much less its objects, so let us first
examine its formation and its motives. A body of public spirited men,
headed by Mr. G. C. Hawker, a member of the Heidelberg Council, and
Mr. G. W. Holland, C.8.E., President of R.5.5.1.L.A., de-
cided that something must be done to provide for distressed Returned
Soldiers, by providing homes in happy and congenial circumstances for
those who, through war disabilities and advancing years are unable to
obtain reasonable housing conditions. They felt that it was a national
obligation for all concerned to make a supreme effort in this respect.
Hence the Trust was formed, composed of responsible men gathered
around Cr. Hawker, as Chairman.
The first task was to secure the land. This was achieved through the
initiative and energy of the Chairman, who obtained at the nominal sum
of £l, from the Council, a large area of land situated at the corner of Ed-
win and Forster Streets, Heidelberg. The Heidelberg Council thus set a
highly commendable example to other Municipalities, by its generosity in
facilitating the transfer of the land for so worthy an object.
Subscriptions and donations were then sought from the community
and up to date approximately £4,000 has been obtained, which sum will
enable the immediate erection of 5 Units of Houses facing Edwin Street,
Heidelberg thus providing accommodation for five couples.
Mr. G. Burridge Leith, a well-known Melbourne architect, and one
of the Trustees, has drawn up plans and specifications which have been
approved by the Trust and tenders have been called for.
It is hoped to be able to lay the foundation stone on Anzac Day next.
What time could be more fitting?
The Trustees thank the public for their patronage of this match, the
proceeds of which will be devoted entirely to the Trust Fund, and respect-
fully invite further donations, which should be sent to the Hon. Secre-
tary (Mr. J. Farrar Sutton), Box 4018, G.R.O. Melbourne.
