A PLEASING INCIDENT.
Appearing amongst the names in the above list will be
noticed that of Lieut. Craig. Mr. Craig is a native of Western
Australia, and married Nancy, General Birdwood?s (a name be-
loved and respected by all dinkum Australians from Digger
upwards) younger daughter. Mrs. Craig is accompanying her
husband home, and the General was present at the boat at
Devonport to bid farewell, God-speed and a safe return to his
fledgling and all on board.
This Officer, who is by the way a member of the Royal
Flying Corps, was charged with :
Xarceme from the person
in that he did feloniously and clandestinely steal, take, and carry
away ? Birdie?s Wing,?
He was convicted and fined twenty-five shillings.
At the conclusion of the case congratulatory remarks and
well wishing sentiments were extended to Mr, and Mrs. Craig by
his Honour and supported by the Clown Persecutor and Counsel
for Defence, and at the termination of the remarks cheers were
called for, and given, by the Diggers, as they only can.
Mr. Craig suitably responded and regretted that instead of
being with the R.F.C. he had not been all the time with the men,
a specimen of whom were then on board. He then, in very well
chosen words, congratulated Pte. J. V. Woods, Y.C., upon his
achievements and the attainment of this decoration, washed him
well, and called for cheers for the V.C. wanner, which with in-
tense enthusiasm w'ere given.
IRONY OF t
THIS r * will tend to remind all on
board that the Ship upon
which this is written was
once a German Liner, hidden for five years behind the
German mine fields and a fleet which was not game to
come out and fight, and was at the conclusion of the
War surrendered by the Germans to ultimately become
a Transport to be used as a means of repatriating the


3fl 5^7
Australian troops who have done so much to bring about
the defeat of Germany and Victory to the Allies
It is reported that she was fitted up by the Enemy
in such a manner as to be capable of accommodating over
6,000 soldiers, which in the Court?s humble opinion
could be intended for only one purpose, viz., an attack
on England?such is Fate. This is her first trip since
her surrender.
Grateful all that this awful War is over and sincerely
hoping that never again will there be any opportunity to
place on record a similar Souvenir to this.
I. O. U. Corruption,
Judge of the Diggers Court.
