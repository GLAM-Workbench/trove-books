In and Around Sydney
INTRODUCTION.
HERE is a geologist in who has advanced
a striking theory to account for the existence
of the finest harbour in the world. Years ago,
he contends, a volcano existed off Sydney Heads.
This volcano, more active than Mt. Pelee and
higher than Vesuvius, occupied its business hours
in making physical geography. The curious volcanic dykes or
clefts, to be seen at Watson’s Bay, and which all converge on
a central point to the eastward, are advanced as proof. It is
only necessary to add, in order to strengthen the mental
digestion to those who require a source of reason for every-
thing, that the Harbour is a gigantic fissure of the same rvpe,
enlarged, altered, and deepened by natural forces since the
post-trissanic period, with a final result of splendid achieve-
ment not to be paralleled along the entire coast lines of the
world.
If the visitor’s thirst is of a romantic character and suffi-
cient time can be spared for a week’s travelling in and around
Sydney Harbour, ample material will be gathered for many
happy recollections. There are scores of accessible pleasure
spots each worthy of a visit, and hundreds of beautiful scenes
whose memory will live to delight future days. Panoramas
will be unfolded before entranced eyes, and one may lounge
in the quiet shade of secluded trees and take their fill of
dreaming bays and sweeping reaches. The visitor may em-


bark on many ferries and harbour steamers, and ride on many
waterside tramways. “The round trip” by electric trams
to Watson’s Bay, catching glimpses of Rushcutter, Double
and Rose Bays en route, and return by steamer in the moon-
light, when the harbour offers her naked silver to the kisses of
an impassioned spring moon, is a delightful experience. One
may follow the pleasant windings of Lane Cove and Parra-
matta Rivers, and catch a breath of tropic bloom from rich
orangeries along the slopes of Ryde, mingled with the fra-
grance of peach and pear blossoms in adjoining orchards. As
the day draws all too quickly to an end white-winged yachts
go gliding homeward across the darkening waterways; and,
steamer after steamer, deep with singing crowds, churn out
from the Pier of Manly, Pearl Bay, Cremorne, Watson’s Bay,
Clifton Gardens, Clontarf, and a score of popular resorts,
freighted with pleasant memories, with love stories new told,
with old lives gladdened, and young lives coloured and fresh-
sweetened.
Such is the picture of the world’s most beautiful Harbour;
and as one allows his eye to wander, it passes on to the great
Queen City of the South, as she lies with her miles and miles
of foreshores, and away in the dim distance clock towers,
domes, and church steeples raise their heads and stand
silhouetted against the sky, the scene stretching in every
direction as far as the eye can reach—a truly magnificent
spectacle.
The broad streets, magnificent parks and gardens, and
grand architecture, place Sydney easily in the first position of
colonial cities, while its tram, railroad and other means of
locomotion may be equalled, but not excelled in any portion of
the world.
