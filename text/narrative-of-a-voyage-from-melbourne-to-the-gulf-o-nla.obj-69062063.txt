PREFACE.
Soon after my return to Melbourne from Sourabaya, I deter-
mined to place before the public a brief narrative of my
voyage to Carpentaria, and the circumstances connected with
the wreck of the Firefly on Sir Charles Hardy?s Island. I
have no desire to cast reflections upon any of the parties
engaged in the Expedition, and in these pages have simply
stated facts, for the truth of which I can positively vouch.
J. KIRBY,
Master of the Ship Firefly.




NARRATIVE.
The ship Firefly, chartered hy the Government of Victoria
� nv -t7/ tores ? c *? or Bx pl� r ation party sent in search
r i on i fat6d ex P lorers > Burke and Wills, left Melbourne on
July 29th, 1861, under orders to proceed to Brisbane, Queens-
land, to take in the gentlemen who undertook to search for
the missing men, as well as the horses required for the Expe-
dition. ihe crew consisted of myself (captain), two mates, a
carpenter, cook, and six able seamen. I was under instruc-
tions to proceed to Sourabaya, with spirits and other goods,
after landing the explorers, horses, and stores, at such point
on the Albert Elver as Captain Norman, of the colonial
steamer Victoria, might deem advisable. For the first few
days the weather was fine, but when off Mount Direction we
encountered very heavy gales, and after twelve days arrived
safely at Brisbane, Queensland, on the same day as the Vic-
toria, which had left Melbourne some days before us. As I
have no intention to make a book, I shall not describe Bris-
bane, and will simply observe, that during the ten days of my
I received much kindness and hospitality, and a truly
English welcome. Here we took in thirty horses, which were
for the most part (so far as my judgment goes) wretched half-
starved animals, utterly unsuited for the labours they were
about to encounter, some six months forage for these horses,
provisions for the parties of Landsborough and Walker, and
various stores required for the Expedition, as well as the ex-
plorers themselves, and some native blacks engaged as
guides. We left Brisbane in good order, the horses being
comfortably housed and every arrangement made for their care
and safety, the Victoria keeping us company, and arrived in
Torres Straits in eight days, exchanging signals regularly
with her. The weather was at first tolerably fine, but within
a few days the gale commenced, and became gradually worse.
On Sunday, September Ist, took observations at noon, and
compared the ship?s position with that of the Victoria ; found
it agreed to a mile. ' The gale still increased, and at 2 p.m.
we reefed topsails, and desired to communicate with the Vic-
toria. At 4 p.m. had an interview with Captain Norman,
who recommended me to lower sail, and keep close to the


Victoria during the night. Reefed fore and aft canvass, and
stood south-east, the gale still increasing, until at last it
became such a hurricane that we could no longer keep sail on
the vessel. At sundown the Victoria was not in sight, and
at S p.m., the gale becoming furious, we made signals and
threw up rockets to attract her attention, but with no effect. At
12 p.M.?the storm being still terrific, the pumps continually
working, and an immense volume of water upon deck?-every
effort was again made to attract the attention of the Victoria,
but with no effect whatever. At this time we were in a most
critical position, being within fifteen miles of Earner?s Reef,
the vessel drifting at the rate of two-and-a-half knots per
hour. We all felt our danger, and the complaints of the ex-
plorers of the absence of the Victoria at this critical juncture
were loud and continuous.
I desire to cast no reflections upon Captain Norman, but
firmly believe that if the Victoria had kept near us, she would
with her steam power have been able to save us from all
danger. At 10 a.m. the weather seemed inclined to break,
and a few glimpses of blue sky led us to believe that the storm
had exhausted its fury, and that the worst was over, but the
current was so strong that I at once saw that I had no pros-
pect of weathering Barrier?s Reef, and therefore determined to
make at once for it, and endeavour to reach it before night.
At 11 a.m. the weather again became so much worse, that I
thought it better to wear the ship, and endeavour once more
to sight the Victoria. She was, however, (Captain Norman
can best say for what reason) many miles away, and indeed
had she been near us, the atmosphere was so thick, and the
fog so heavy, that we could not have seen her. During this
time it was evident that we were in great danger, but my
officers and crew did their duty well, and showed no fear;
the explorers were, however, completely upset, and bewailed
their fate to such an extent, that I really pitied them, and
endeavoured to keep up their spirits as far as possible, as I
feared their terrors might affect the crew. At midnight, as a
last resource, the gale being still most furious, we set the mam
trisail and foretopmast staysail, and by burning brilliant lights
made a last but ineffectual attempt to attract the Victoria.
On Tuesday, September 3rd, I told Mr. Landsborough that
we were in much peril, and explained to him that, as a last
resource, I thought it advisable to run for Heine Island Beacon.
I did so, and at half-past 9 A.M. sighted it, the distance from
the ship being about three miles, the explorers losing heart
more and more, and wishing that they were back in Brisbane.
The weather was still very bad, and the current very strong ;


we were running almost with bare poles, and could carry but
little canvas, topsails close reefed, steering south-south-west;
saw outer detached Barrier Reef, bearing south-south-east,
giving ship?s position eight to ten miles from the reef, drifting
towards it at the rate of two-and-a-half knots per hour. At
half-past nine entered Heine Island Beacon, topsail and foresail
close reefed, weathered the White Patches and made Ashmore
Banks ; made more sail, wishing to weather Middle Bank, and
as the weather was still thick, with heavy rains, steered for
Sir Charles Hardy?s Islands. While running for them, sighted
the wreck of the Lady Kinnaird, bound from Melbourne to
Calcutta with horses and copper; she was under the lee of
the island, sunk in about four to five fathoms water. lat
first (the weather being extremely thick) took her to be the
Victoria, and said as much to Mr. Landsborough, but soon
after, when the weather cleared a little, found out what she
was ; anchored soon after under South Island, in five fathoms
water, but as the bottom was a bed of coral, the anchor would
not hold. At this time the current ran fully five knots an
hour, and the ship kept drifting to the lee island with her stern
close to the reef. We remained all night in this position, and,
to add to our horrors, had heavy squalls, and some of the
most vivid lightning I have ever seen. On Wednesday, Sep-
tember 4th, the port-chain parted, and at 8 a.m , while in the
act of sending down topgallant masts and yards, the starboard
chain parted. We at once set the jib and trisail, and loosed
the two topsails, but before we could get steerage way on
the vessel, she struck on the reef and bumped heavily. The
sea was at this time running mountains high, breaking clean
over the decks and smothering everything. The masts and
yards bent like twigs, and the elements presented a frightful
appearance. I saw at this time that there was no hope of
saving the ship, and as I feared the masts would come down
by the run, and endanger the lives of the passengers and
sailors, I ordered the carpenter to cut them down ; and being
anxious to land the explorers as soon as possible, lowered the
quarter boat; but as the sea was very heavy, she was stove
in in a few moments, fortunately, however, before either pas-
sengers or stores had been placed in her. At 3P. M. succeeded
in lowering the long boat, and landed Mr. Landsborough and
party safely (Mr. Campbell, a volunteer, kindly remaining on
board to assist in getting stores ready). At 5 p.m. the tide
had fallen considerably, and the men who had conveyed
Landsborough and party on shore had to wade to the ship up
to their waists in water. We succeeded, with some difficulty,
and after much hard work, in getting the camp equipage and


provisions on shore, and. proceeded to make all snug for the
night as we best could. _ .
At this time the horses were up to their middle in water,
in the hold of the vessel. I walked, or rather waded on shore,
leaving Mr. Scott, my chief officer, in charge ; found the ex-
plorers, who seemed to know nothing about rigging tents or
lighting fires, although drift-wood was abundant, in a most
deplorable and comfortless condition, but, with the assistance
of the sailors, soon got things in shape. During the night one
of the seamen swam on board the vessel to obtain liquor; he
came on shore very drunk, and whatever may have been said
to the contrary, I can conscientiously declare that this was,
during all these trying scenes, the only case of drunkenness
among the crew of the Firefly. Amid all our misfortunes we
had reason to be thankful, for we had, as I have observed,
fuel in abundance and two beautiful springs of pure water,
and when we had rigged our tents and got our provisions on
shore, we found ourselves as comfortable as we could, under
the circumstances, have expected. When we had a little
leisure and were able to walk about the Island, we found
grass in abundance, but few trees, and these of small size.
The Island on which we were encamped is from three to four
miles in circumference, and would not seem to have been in-
habited, if we except the occasional compulsory visits of ship-
wrecked mariners. On the day of the wreck we cut a hole in
the ship?s side, extricated the horses from their perilous
position in the hold, and landed them in safety ; we then
made preparations to raise upon the long boat, and proceed to
Brisbane; but while our preparations were in progress, the
Victoria hove in sight, and soon after Captain Herman made
his appearance on the scene. Had he been with us all through,
I believe we need never have run for Sir Charles Hardy s
Island. Of the thirty horses shipped at Brisbane, which, as
1 have observed, were in bad condition and unfit for rough
work, one died at the entrance of the Straits, and three of the
others were all but dead when the wreck took place, as they
had suffered much from the length of the voyage and continued
confinement in the hold of the vessel, and were knocked about
a good deal when the ship struck on the reef. Twenty-five
were landed safely, and one who swam five miles against wind
and tide to .South Island, in a place abounding in ravenous
sharks of the largest size, was afterwards recovered. The
horses were, on the whole, in better condition than when
shipped at Brisbane, and, with the excellent feed at Sir
Charles Hardy?s Island, soon got up in flesh. During all
these events the officers and crew, on the whole, behaved


well. It is true that a case of boots was opened after the
wreck took place, but they were urgently required by the men,
who were barefooted, and whose feet were lacerated. They
were, however, returned to Mr. Landsborough in good con-
dition ; some slops, too, which had been left in the cabin tied
up in a canvas bag, after Mr. Landsborough had made an
issue to his men, were used by the sailors; but although
much stress has been laid upon this, they could hardly be
blamed, and, to my knowledge, the slops were returned. On
the arrival of the Victoria, boats were sent to run out an
anchor with the view of keeping the Firefly from getting
further on the reef, but I regret to say that the sailors of the
Victoria behaved badly while performing this duty ; they
broke into the hold of the Firefly, got spirits, and were drunk
for days, and while in that condition plundered the ship?s
stores to a considerable extent. As it was, under the circum-
stances, impossible to prevent them from getting at the grog,
it was determined, at Captain Norman?s suggestion, to destroy
all the spirits on board the vessel, which was accordingly
done. Luring the greater portion of this time, the sailors of
the Firefly were laid up with wounds and bruises received in
landing from the wreck, and after they were partially restored,
a survey was held on the vessel, when she was declared by
the officers of the Victoria to be worthless, and it was agreed
that she should be abandoned. From' that time the crew of
the Firefly ceased to be under my charge, and were placed
under that of Captain Norman. We remained on the Island
for fourteen days, and were busily employed in getting up
stores from the wreck and making other arrangements, when
another difficulty arose; the horses were indispensably re-
quired for the prosecution of the Exploring Expedition, there
was no room for them in the Victoria, and the Firefly was a
wreck. The question was, what was to be done under the
circumstances, and there seemed to be but one of two alter-
natives?either to abandon the horses, and thus virtually
abandon the Expedition, or reship them in the Firefly and
tow her astern of the Victoria. The latter course was decided
upon, the horses were again returned to their old quarters,
and all arrangements made for a start. From the date of the
wreck we (the captain and crew of the Firefly) were con-
tinually at work, receiving from the time of Captain Norman?s
arrival but ships? rations, and for these services we have to
this day received no remuneration whatever. On the comple-
tion of the repairs to the Firefly, we embarked in the Victoria
en route for the Gulf of Carpentaria, the Firefly conveying
horses towed by the Victoria.


We touched at Booby Island, where we left letters, and
also found some on account of Native Lass ; we then proceeded
up the gulf to Bountiful Island, which is some six miles in
circumference, and in some places one hundred and fifty feet
in height. This Island ought to have a corporation and aider-
men of the old school, as the finest turtles I have ever seen were
to be had in the greatest abundance for the trouble of
catching them ; to people who had been on salt provisions for
months, they proved a most acceptable treat. We saw no
animals on this Island, if we except snakes of a large size,
which were most disagreeably abundant; in fact, it was im-
possible to walk twenty yards in any direction without meet-
ing with some of those reptiles ; birds were, however, abundant,
more especially cockatoos and buzzards, which were to be seen
in all directions. Bountiful Island does not seem at all
adapted for settlement, and is merely a place for ships to touch
at to obtain turtles.
From Bountiful Island we proceeded to Sweer?s Island,
where we arrived in about twelve hours. I was rejoiced at
last to find a spot admirably suited for European settlement f
the harbour is excellent and affords shelter at all seasons, and
from all winds; the Island is about twelve miles in length by
about six miles in width ; it is for the most part composed of
flat land, with trifling undulations ; there is an abundant and
never failing supply of good water from springs, and, indeed, the
pure element can be obtained by sinking a few feet on any
part of it. The temperature when we were there was from
90� to 100�, and the climate seemed to be remarkably salubrious.
There are no large trees, those we saw being stunted in their
growth, and of small size ; we saw neither plants nor fruits.
The soil is a dark loam of considerable depth, and, except on
the beach, there is little or no sand ; no animals were seen, but
birds of the cockatoo, pheasant, and parrot tribe are abundant.
There can be no doubt but that tropical fruits would grow
most luxuriantly ; and if the Albert River become ere long an
important settlement, Sweer?s Island must also be a place of much
consequence. Fish are to be had in the greatest abundance,
more especially codfish, weighing from seven to twenty pounds,
and I see no good reason why a fishery of a remunerative
character might not be established there. The natives are
not numerous ; they are mere Australian blacks, and are dis-
posed, so far as I can judge, to be on friendly terms with
Europeans. I could not ascertain that they belong to any
tribe, neither would they appear to have either king or
government. I have crossed the Island and seen most of the
natives, and do not believe that they would be any serious


obstacle to settlement. There is no appearance of volcanic
action, neither would it seem to have ever been subject to
earthquakes. It is but twenty miles distant from the mouth
of the Albert River, and must ere long become an important
place. Parties fit for the business, with moderate capital,
who would occupy Sweer?s Island, would eventually do well.
Bentick?s Island is within three miles of Sneer?s Island. This
is a very fine place, being about thirty miles in length by
twenty in width. The soil is much the same as at Sneer s
Island, but the trees are much larger, and of better description.
Bentick?s Island swarms with natives who would seem to have
been pitchforked there from the mainland; we, however, saw but
little of them, as they did not care to come too near white men,
after an occurrence between them and one of the officers of
the Grecian. It would seem that some casks were landed on
Bentick?s Island, with the view of obtaining water, and when
the poor ignorant natives saw the casks standing by their
water holes, which were diminished in quantity, they fancied
that the casks drank the water, and were proceeding to
destroy them, when the sailors came up, and one of the officers
of the Grecian fired at a native and wounded him seriously.
The act was generally condemned as being indiscreet, and has
proved a very great obstacle to intercourse with the natives
since; _
Bentick?s Island is admirably suited for settlement and cul-
tivation ; the climate, as at Sweer?s Island, is excellent, and the
land all seemingly fit for the plough. During the day the heat
is sometimes unpleasant, but the evenings are so cool that
blankets and a fire are by no means to be despised. During
the period of our stay the men enjoyed excellent health, and
this locality seems to siiit the European constitution very well.
For my part, I only wish I were one of a well-equipped party
bound for these Islands ; I believe they offer a most favourable
prospect for intending settlers. In all probability they would
for years to come be left in undisturbed possession of their
ocean homes, and as civilization came near them, they would
be the pioneers of the new settlement, and there locality a
place of call for those bound for the plains of promise, and
other splendid lands opened up for the first time by the
honoured and never-dying exertions of Burke, Wills, and the
other explorers whose names will ever be inseparably blended
with the embryos of future empires.
To the many emigrants daily leaving their fatherland for
these colonies, I would suggest these Islands as presenting
most favourable opportunities of settlement and cultivation at
a small cost ; such persons must, unless the fault be their own,


be successful, ?good harbours, fruitful fields, fine timber, and
abundant water, with every prospect of these Islands being
the centre of a large traffic, should be strong inducements,
coupled with a fine climate, so admirably suited for European
constitutions. At Sweer?s Island, we found the brig Grecian
and schooner Native Lass, chartered by the Government of
Victoria to convey coals and stores for the use of the Govern-
ment steamer. We soon after formed a camp on the island,
and Mr. Woods, one of the officers of the Victoria, started in
a boat with Mr. Landsborough for the Albert River. Here
my connection with the Expedition may be said to have ended,
and I am happy to say the objects were fully accomplished.
Of thirty horses shipped at Brisbane, twenty-five were, under
unprecedented difficulties, safely brought to their destination,
and the exploring party, fully equipped with all necessaries,
started from Sweer?s Island in good health and spirits for the
scene of their labours. I regret that feelings of duty to the
owners of the Firefly prevented me from accompanying the
explorers to the Albert River, but I had no discretion, as by
the regulations of the mercantile marine it was imperative
upon me to proceed, with the least possible delay, to the port
to which the vessel was bound, in order to report her loss to
the proper authorities. I believed at this time that she was
insured, but have since learned that such was not the case.
It will for the remainder of my life be a source of the deepest
regret to me that I was unable to accompany Mr. Landsborough
and party to the end, but, under the circumstances, I had no
discretion whatever. The Firefly, abandoned on survey, was
taken by Captain Norman, and despatched to the Albert
River, while we (myself and crew) went on board the Grecian
to proceed to Sourabaya.
While we were on board the Victoria, I received the
utmost kindness and courtesy from the captain and officers,
and shall ever gratefully remember their attention. After
the Grecian had discharged her cargo, we weighed anchor,
and again touched at Bountiful Island ; our provisions being
scarce and those on board being in bad condition, obtained an
abundant supply of turtles, and from thence, with light and
variable winds, proceeded down the gulf to Copang, where
we remained for two days to obtain water and provisions;
while there I did myself the honour of waiting upon the Go-
vernor, who received me with much courtesy. The town is
clean and well-built, containing about five thousand inha-
bitants?a motley mixture, Dutch, Chinese, and Malays.
There is a handsome fort erected to protect the harbour.
The houses are for the most part of Chinese architecture ; the


climate is temperate and salubrious, fruit, fowls, and vegeta-
bles being cheap and abundant. There are neither hotels nor
lodging-houses, but hospitality is universal. Arrack, the
spirit chiefly used, can be had for four shillings a gallon.
There is but little beef and no mutton. The Governor lives
in a fine house built of bricks, and some of the soldiers on
guard wear the European dress. Oopang is a good place for
ships to water, and if it be true that copper has latterly been
found in great abundance, it will become a place of very con-
siderable importance. The authorities at Copang have request-
ed me to state, which I take this opportunity of doing, that
from and after the Ist May, 1862, the port would be free to
vessels of all nations. This will probably have the effect of
very considerably increasing the trade. Left Copang, after a
very pleasant visit, and sailed for Sourabaya ; the passage
was tedious, the winds being light and variable. On 20th
December arrived at Sourabaya, and reported the loss of the
Firefly to Messrs. P. Carvill and Co., the agents, and also to
the British Consul at the port; placed the crew in his hands,
and paid them their wages. Spent Christmas-day at Soura-
baya, and enjoyed the town and scenery much; remained
there nine days, and embarked in the ship Eeine des Anges
for Sydney, she being the only vessel in Sourabaya bound for
the Australasian colonies. On the Ist January, 1862, left
the Ballay Straits, the eastern end of Java, weather very bad,
steering southward ; on the 10th, perceived strong indications
of the near approach of a cyclone ; pointed out the danger to
the captain, but he seemed to know nothing of Peddington?s
theory, and, indeed, appeared to be ignorant iipon the matter.
I deeply regretted leaving Sourabaya, as the captain was unfit
for his duty, and the sailors were, for the most part, laid up
with illness. At midnight we encountered a fearful thunder-
storm, the lightning being most terrific ; the rain came down
in torrents, and the wind blew at once from every point in
the compass with fearful violence. Captain Gilliard was
young and inexperienced, and knew little of the danger of his
position; the ship was under close-reefed topsails, taking in
volumes of water. I advised him to break the bulwarks, and
let the water out, but he refused to do so. At 10 a.m, the
hurricane struck her on her beam ends, and but little assis-
tance could be obtained from the crew, who were nearly all
laid up with fever. At 3 p.m. the foretopgallant mast and
royals broke, and hung in the rigging, taking the flying boom
with them ; and to make matters worse, a heavy sea struck
the after part, carried quarter boats and all on deck away
with it, including all our live stock and fresh water. At 10


p.m. the hurricane still increased, the ship crossing the centre
of the cyclone in a north-westerly direction. During this
time we were shipping fearful seas, and at 10 P.M. stove in the
cabin bulkhead, and had several baskets of sugar washed out.
T was at this time on the poop, and on going into the cabin
saw the water going down the hatch in great quantities ;
jumped upon the hatch and kept it close, to prevent it from
washing away. During all this time the crew of the French
ship were useless, some of them being laid up with fever,
while the others were so much frightened that they would not
leave the forecastle. At daylight the appearance of the sea
was awful in the extreme. The waves were mountains high,
breaking fore and aft over the ship, which was rumiing with
bare poles in a northerly direction. She now seemed to get
heavy ; we were in the centre of the cyclone, when a heavy
sea burst the cabin open, started the poop deck on the star-
board side, washing away provisions, chronometers, and every-
thing belonging to the passengers. The captain, mates, and
some of the crew, were washed out of the cabin. My former
chief-officer, Mr. Scott, was at the wheel, and in order to save
the captain from certain death, we lashed him to the mizen
mast. At this time the captain (being utterly incompetent to
manage the vessel) placed me in command. I ordered the
pumps to be sounded, and found eight-and-a-half feet of water
in the hold, and she seemed to be settling down fast ; our
position was most desperate; we could not work the ship,
which lay like a log on the waters, and to make matters worse,
we had hardly two days? full supply of provisions or water
that could be come at. We succeeded, however, in getting
up some damaged bread from the hold, and with that and
some arrack, made the best of our position, which was indeed
a deplorable one. At midnight on the 12th, the jib-boom
went, all the spars being adrift, and the vessel was a total
wreck. We were at the pumps the greater part of the night,
but received no assistance from the Frenchmen, who were
now convalescent, and well able to work, but were skulking.
The French are wretched sailors, and are very easily un-
manned by difficulties; and in all our troubles we could not
avoid comparing them with our own British tars, who are
always ready to meet difficulties half-way, and to conquer
them too, and my men often jeered them, and said it was no
wonder that Nelson licked them. These remarks were badly
received by the Frenchmen, who retorted with many and loud
sacres. At midnight on the 13th, the gale at length abated,
and Mr. Martin (son of the owner of the Firefly), Mr. Scott,
and myself, made sail and stood in a northerly direction.


I had been in these seas before, and knew that wherever we
met with land I should find myself at home. We soon suc-
ceeded in getting things to rights a little, and my first care
was to see what provisions we had on board. We found that
our supply for eighteen men was about one hundred and seventy
pounds damaged bread, fifty gallons water, fifty pounds of
pork, a sack of flour, and a cask of arrack. We placed the
water and arrack on the poop, and doled them out carefully;
Mr. Scott volunteered to act as cook. Soon after we sighted
breakers all round the ship, and I informed the captain that
we were close to Hibernia Reef ; some four days after, sighted
Rotti Island, and immediately knew the ship?s exact position.
The vessel being still in my charge, I told Captain Gilliard
that there were no means at Copang available for taking the
ship to the Australian colonies. He said, ? ? Take the ship to
Sourabaya.? I did so, and soon after, sighted Sandalwood
Island, and re-entered Bailay Straits about the middle of
February. The captain of the French ship learning his posi-
tion, now took charge, and, with my assistance, navigated the
ship to Sourabaya. For a considerable time during this
dismal voyage we had no provisions, and supported existence,
as we best could, upon scalded peas. When we arrived at
the pilot station some fifty miles from Sourabaya, we were,
what with hunger and weakness, in a fearful condition. Pro-
cured a pilot, and returned to Sourabaya, after having been
almost starved, and having experienced most fearful weather,
being out since leaving Sourabaya fifty-eight days. For all
these services, although I can conscientiously declare that but
for the exertions of myself and crew, the French vessel would
never have entered a port, we have never received a single
shilling, and the English Consul, Mr. M ?Lean, although we
were English subjects in great distress, gave us no assistance.
I placed the matter in the hands of Mr. P. Carvill, agent for
the Firefly, who laid it before the French Consul; that official
was pleased to say, that the whole affair should be most care-
fully considered, and that justice should be rendered to all
parties concerned; but to this day I have received no remu-
neration, and even my passage-money has never been returned.
�IOOO would (considering the value of the cargo) have been
but a moderate remuneration for the services rendered.
Remained at Sourabaya for six days, and had to pay my own
expenses, as well as the cost of medical attendance, and again
embarked in the Woodlark of Aberdeen, Captain Taylor,
commander, having to pay 200 rupees for my passage. We
were most kindly treated on board the Wooklark ; and with-
out desiring to disparage the French as a nation, I must say


I prefer an English to a French bottom. Off Cape Liptrap
we fell in with a vessel bound for Melbourne, the Norman, and
Captain Taylor kindly placed us on board her. Here our
troubles ended ; we had a pleasant passage to Melbourne, and
arrived in safety after an absence of about nine months.
I was not at the Albert River, and cannot, therefore,
speak of the country on and about it, of my own knowledge,
but from all I have seen of the Islands of its vicinity, and have
heard from others, I believe it to be the land of promise.
Here ends my narrative ; it is brief and unadorned, but it
contains the truth, and those who peruse it will see the diffi-
culties and dangers encountered by all those who visit new
and unexplored places. The names of Burke and Wills will
live in the grateful memories of the colonists, while those
engaged in subordinate capacities in connection with the Ex-
ploring Expedition, however great their labours or endurance,
will be forgotten and disregarded.
The above pages are now sent forth for what they are
worth, and it is for the public to peruse them and decide as to
their merits.
