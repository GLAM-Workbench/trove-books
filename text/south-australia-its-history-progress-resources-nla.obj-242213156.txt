SPECIAL NOTICE.
The account contained in the following pages, of the “ History, Progress,
Resources, and Present Position of South Australia, 1 ” was originally written
for the South Australian Register and appeared in a Supplement to that
paper on September 6, 1879, It was prepared specially as a contri-
bution to the South Australian Court at the Sydney Exhibition; but, as
the facts which it contained were considered worthy of general distribution
at the Exhibition, it was reprinted in pamphlet form by the order of the
South Australian Commission.
The present edition, carefully revised to date, is issued under
instructions from the Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration
(the Hon. Thomas Playford, M.P.) The Commissioner desires to
place in the hands of persons intending to emigrate to South Aus-
tralia a Hand-book which will give them a clear, succinct, and impartial
account of the colony to which they propose to proceed. With this
object copies are placed at the disposal of the Emigration Agent for
this Colony, No. 8, Victoria Chambers, Westminster, S.W., for gratuitous
distribution among persons making enquiries respecting South Aus-
tralia, A copy of the hand-bill issued by the Goverment, relative
to the advantages offered under the Land-order Warrant system, is
printed on the opposite page, and a full description of such system
will be found on page 37 of this pamphlet.

PREFACE
The facts recorded in the following pages will furnish abundant cause
for satisfaction as to the past, and hopefulness with regard to the future
of South Australia. Commenced on a broad and liberal basis, without
some of the adventitious advantages enjoyed by other British provinces
this colony, under the stimulus of true Anglo-Saxon energy, has so far
pursued a prosperous career. Its early history was chequered, and at
times the difficulties which the pioneer settlers had to contend against
threatened to become overwhelming. At a later period the attractions
of the gold discoveries in Victoria produced a temporary depopulation
here, especially of the industrial element, and for a time the progress of
the province was seriously retarded. These and other embarrassments
were eventually overcome through the abundant natural resources of the
land and the steady perseverance which has largely characterized its
occupants. Although no such rich and permanent gold-fields have been
proved to exist in this colony as those which have made the colony of
Victoria famous, our copper mines have given employment to tens of
thousands, and have earned a world-wide renown. At present this
industry is depressed all over the world, but those who are well
acquainted with the localities where cupriferous deposits abound do not
hesitate to predict a prosperous future for our mining interest. The
Capabilities of the country for the production of pastoral wealth have
been recognised from the first, and as regards agriculture South Austialia
not only holds the premier position in the whole Australian group, but in
regard to the quality of its cereal products it surpasses any other pait of
the world.
The three sources of wealth referred to above —mineral, pastoral, and
agricultural—have necessarily developed trade and commerce to an
extent that appears surprising when the statistics of population are
taken into account. The entire number of inhabitants barely exceeds a
quarter of a million, and the fact that the total import and export trade


of 1879 amounted to between £10,000,000 and £11,000,000 sterling
speaks well for the general prosperity. Of the staple exports of the
colony, wool, copper, and wheat hold by far the most prominent position.
Notwithstanding the falling-off in copper, the combined value of these
exports amounted last year to close upon £4,000,000. Year by year,
with only occasional fluctuations, the figures grow larger. Comparing
the returns of last year with those for 1869 it is found that the exports
of wheat and flour have increased about three-quarters of a million, and
of wool nearly as much. Nor is there the slightest ground for apprehen-
sion that the limit has been reached. Of late years, through more
liberal land legislation, vast areas have been brought under cultivation
which only a short time ago were believed to be unfit for the plough.
As lines of railway are being constructed the produce of the interior is
more quickly and economically conveyed to the port of shipment, and the
boundary of agricultural settlement is receding further from the seaboard.
The colony has an extensive coastline, and the land which will ultimately
prove available for cultivation is almost unlimited. Some of the fore-
going remarks also apply to mining pursuits. Rich and valuable mineral
properties in the interior have hitherto proved comparatively valueless on
account of the cost of conveying the ore to a market, but the railways
that are being pushed on with vigour will materially lessen this draw-
back. With regard to pastoral pursuits, the opening of the vast interior
by the construction of the telegraph line to Port Darwin, the results of
the researches of various exploring parties, and the construction of a
transcontinental railway—the first link of which is in progress—arc
destined to facilitate their expansion to an extent which it is at present
impossible to estimate. When it is borne in mind that the area of the
colony (including the Northern Territory) is upwards of 900,000 square
miles, of which little more than one per cent, is alienated from the
Crown, and less than one-third is in occupation, the undeveloped
resources of the colony will be seen to justify vexy sanguine anticipations.
When regarding the progress of South Australia, the initial difficul-
ties it had to contend against and its slow growth for the fii'st twenty years
should not be forgotten. Twenty years ago the interior was compara-
tively unknown. What were then scattei-ed sheep-runs are now immense
stretches of waving corn. The trackless wilderness of those days is
now occupied by the squatter with his countless flocks and herds ; it is
traversed by the electric wire, and will sooxx be startled by the shriek of
the locomotive. Then the shipping trade of the colony was confined to
vessels of small capacity and was for the most part limited to Port
Adelaide, but now lines of magnificent ocean steamers take us in their


•way, and sailing ships of the largest tonnage trade regularly between
here and London, while along our extensive coastline outports have
been opened, to which traffic converges, and which are being continually
improved. Twenty years ago there were only 264,462 acres of land under
cultivation; now there are over two millions and a quarter. At that time
the population was 113,340; now it numbers 260,000. The revenue
of the colony in 1859 was £505,870 ; in 1879 it was £1,662,497.
Other statistics of a similar nature might easily be grouped to illustrate
the same fact, but these will suffice to show the steadiness and solidity
of our material progress. In other respects there is much cause for
congratulation. From the first there has been no alliance between State
and Church, and all denominations are agreed that the voluntary
principle has proved a success. A great impetus has been given to
primary education during the last few years, and there is a general
desire to make our educational system as perfect as possible. The
founding of the Adelaide University, and the liberal endowments it has
received, attest the value set on higher education. In politics we have
happily escaped any such complication as that which has prevailed in
an adjacent colony. Our fiscal responsibilities are increasing, and a
further augmentation may be expected if the public works, which are so
urgently required, are carried out; but the resources of the colony are
equal to a much greater strain than has so far been imposed upon them.
We do not in the least envy our neighbours on the Australian Continent
who have thought fit to emulate older nations in organizing Exhibitions
at which the resources and the producing power of the world are to be
represented. On the contrary, we cordially congratulate them upon the
courage and enterprise they have shown, and sincerely trust that they
may be amply rewarded. South Australia can afford to wait a few' years
before following the ambitious example of New South Wales and Victoria;
but there is no reason why the time should be greatly prolonged. New
South Wales has held her International Exhibition, which has been a
grand success ; Victoria is about to hold an Exhibition in testimony to
the marvellous progress she has made; this colony may very appro-
priately make her jubilee in 1886 the occasion for a like grand com-
memorative gathering.
May, 1880.




INTRODUCTION.
EARLY EXPLORATIONS.
Although South Australia cannot be said to be the direct offspring of
New South Wales in the same way that Victoria and Queensland are, its
early history—not perhaps as a colony, but as a part of the great Australian
land—is to a considerable extent identified with the names of men who
already had done good work for the premier province of New Holland.
Among these names the chief are those of Flinders and Sturt, the former
being the first to explore with care the coastline of South Australia, and
the latter the first to sail down the River Murray into what is now South
Australian territory. As early as the year 1800 Lieutenant Grant, in charge
of His Majesty’s ship the Lady Nelson, sighted a part of South Australia,
and placed Cape Northumberland, Mount Schanck, and Mount Gambier
upon his maps. It was not until Captain Flinders came upon the scene that any
really valuable knowledge of this colony was acquired. In 1795 and following
years, when holding the rank of a midshipman in the Reliance, he had shown
a remarkable taste for exploration, and had examined a large part of the
coast of New South Wales, besides having, in company with Mr. Bass, proved
that Tasmania was an island. In 1800 he returned to England, and the
publication of his charts led to his being entrusted with the command of
the Investigator and to his receiving a commission to continue the
work of exploration along the Australian coast. In 1801 the expedition
started, and after a voyage of five months Cape Leuwin was reached.
Sailing slowly eastwards along the coast which is now traversed by the
electric wire connecting South and Western Australia, Captain Hinders
reached and duly named the Great Australian Bight, Fowlers Bay,
Smoky Bay, Streaky Bay, Anxious Bay, Coffin’s Bay, and other
physical features which he came across, all of which are still beyond the
principal settlements of South Australia. His 'first important discovery was
that of the magnificent harbour of Port Lincoln, which, to use the words of
one of the French navigators who subsequently visited it, is “ worthy to rival
Port Jackson and is one of the finest harbours of the world.” Unfortu-
nately, owing to the nature of the land around it, the founders of South
Australia were unable to fix upon Port Lincoln as the principal port the
colony. Proceeding northwards, up what proved* to be Spencers Gulf,
Flinders was extremely disappointed at the appearance of the land forming
the western boundary of the inlet at the head of which now stands Port
Augusta—the sea terminus of a railway line 200 miles in length now in
course of construction, and which is regarded as the first link in an iron road
to span the continent from north to south. Coming back towards the ocean
along the low-lying coast of Yorke’s Peninsula —which is the site of the
famous Wallaroo and Moonta and other rich copper mines, and which besides
skirts a most important agricultural territory— the appearance of the country
was still barren and forbidding. Having got safely out of Spencer’s Gulf,
the corner of Yorke’s Peninsula was turned, and, being then overtaken by a


storm, he found Nepean Bay a harbour of refuge, and the island of which it
is a prominent feature was named Kangaroo Island, after the numerous and
extremely confiding kangaroo or wallaby which were discovered in great
numbers upon it. From this place Mount Lofty, the highest eminence in
the charming range which forms so lovely a background to the Adelaide
plains, was sighted ; and a visit to the mainland disclosed the richness
and beauty of the country that surrounds what is now the capital
of South Australia. Passing out through Backstairs Passage, lying
between the main coastline and Kangaroo Island, the Inves-
tigator sailed into Encounter Bay, so named because of the
meeting with the French vessel of discovery (the Geographe), under
Captain Baudin, with whom, notwithstanding the hostile terms on which
the English and French nations then stood, Flinders exchanged friendly
greetings. Proceeding onwards, he noted that remarkable saltwater channel
which runs a short distance inland along a large part of our south-eastern
coast—the Coorong—and, passing Lacepede Bay, Guichen Bay, and other
inlets now well known, sighted the mountains already referred to as having
been discovered by Grant. Thence he continued his voyage along the coast-
line that bounds the adjoining colony of Victoria.
Thus far we have hastily traced the history of South Australian explora-
tion as far as its sea boundary is concerned. The information acquired was
useful, but the examinations thus made necessarily failed to give any idea of
the value of this part of Australia. So mistaken, indeed, was the opinion
held of it that in 1822 we find it gravely stated by a captain of His Majesty’s
Navy, who read a paper before the Philosophical Society of New South Wales,
that “ The south coast of Australia is barren, and in every respect useless
and unfavourable for colonization.” For Captain Sturt—an officer of the
other branch of His Majesty’s service—was reserved the discovery that the
character of this part of the continent was not by any means so bad as had
been made out. Captain Sturt was an ardent believer in the theory, which
was largely held in the early days of New South Wales, that the rivers of
Australia terminated in a vast inland lake. Determined to put this theory
to the test, and having already discovered the great Darling Kiver, he made
up his mind to trace it to the point where its waters were emptied. In 1830,
with a small party in two boats, Sturt found his way from the Murrumbidgee
into the Murray, and traced the latter river to its mouth in Encounter Bay.
The journey was made under difficulties that would have appalled men of
ordinary mebtle ; but this brave man and his trusty followers proceeded
undaunted, suffering from want of food, in constant danger from natives,
and wearied with work until the discovery was complete, and then gradually
made their way back up-stream, arriving in Sydney after an absence of six
months. There is no doubt that Sturt was disappointed with the country
through which he passed, and particularly with the discovery that the mouth
of the Murray was not easily navigable. But that he was not altogether un-
favourably impressed is shown by these few words which we quote from his
own records : —“ Hurried as my view of it was, my eye never fell on a
country of more promising aspect or of more favourable position than that
which occupies the space between the lake (Alexandria) and the Ranges of
St. Vincent’s Gulf, and continuing northerly stretches away without any
visible boundary. ” General Ralph Darling, Governor of New South Wales,
who had dispatched Sturt upon his expedition, afterwards sent Captain Barker
by sea to St. Vincent’s Gulf ; and one who accompanied the party writes—
‘ The soil was rich, there was abundance of the finest pasturage, no lack of
resh water and then, becoming poetical in his enthusiasm, he remarks


that “it was a spot in whose valleys the exile might hope to build for him
self and for his family a peaceful and prosperous retreat.”
COLONIZATION.
Although South Australia was not actually established until 1836, it was
only a year after Captain Sturt’s explorations—namely, in 1831 —that the
first attempt to found a colony on the southern shores of South Australia was
made. In that jear an influential committee was formed, and application
was made to the Imperial authorities for a charter giving permission to occupy
and colonize the land that is now comprised within our boundaries. The
application was not, however, received with favour, and the scheme remained
in abeyance until 1834. when it was taken up again, and this time with
success. At a meeting held at Exeter Hall the details of the project were
explained. Profiting by the experience gained in other attempts at coloniza-
tion, this new undertaking was to be carried out upon a basis that would
secure a due proportion of labour and capital, and thus ensure success from
the beginning. In the case of Western Australia large grants of land had
been made to persons willing to emigrate, but these vast estates had proved
a burden rather than a blessing to their proprietors. The size of the blocks
had had the effect of isolating the settlers at great distances, and the land
having been parted with without any substantial consideration the colonial
authorities had no revenue to import the labour without which the ground
could not be turned to account. To obviate these fatal disadvantages to the
settlement of a new country Mr. Edward Gibbon Wakefield had propounded
a new scheme, of which the features were that the land should be sold at a
somewhat high price, and that the revenue so derived should be devoted to
the importation of labour. The price of the land was at first to be twelve
shillings an acre, and was afterwards to be raised to a pound. Thus, the
blocks that would be purchased would not be larger than the buyers could
easily cultivate, and as the land was to be sold in districts the colonists would
be able to unite in various organizations for the common good,without which
no country can flourish. These were the principles laid down on the plat-
form of Exeter Hall, and which formed the basis upon which the promoters
applied to the Imperial Parliament for an Act to authorize their scheme. In
August, 1834, the necessary legislative sanction was received, and in a sub-
sequent session an amending Act was passed. Taking the two measures
together, their leading principles were, first, that South Australia
should not be a charge upon the financial resources of Great
Britain, that she should be free from any State Church, and
that no convicts should be transported to her territory. South
Australians are justly proud that the original terms of this charter have not
been altered, and that they have been able to raise their adopted country to
its present pitch of prosperity without the adventitious aids either of
Imperial money or of convict labour; while the absence of State aid to
religion has, by encouraging self-reliance, given strength to religious efforts
somewhat remarkable in a new country. An attempt was made while the
colony was young to violate this last principle, and grants were actually made
to religious bodies ; but at the earliest possible opportunity the colonists
repudiated this attempt to associate Church and State, and for many years
the voluntary principle in religion has been in full operation.
The authorizing Act having been passed, Commissioners were appointed
to give effect to it, of whom Colonel Torrens was Chairman, and Mr. (after-
wards Sir) Rowland Hill, the originator of the penny-postage system, whose
death has just been recorded, was the Secretary. The passing of the Act


was one step—and a very important one—in the work, but before the colony
could be actually established a certain quantity of land had to be sold, and
great difficulty was found in finding purchasers for it. There was now great
danger of the whole scheme falling through ; but at this critical juncture
Mr. George Fife Angas—who recently died in the colony at the advanced
age of ninety years—promoted the South Australian Company—an Asso-
ciation still enjoying a profitable existence—which purchased sufficient land
at twelve shillings an acre to relieve the Commissioners of their difficulty.
The way was now clear for the real work that was to be done ; a survey
party, under Colonel Light, of the Rojal Engineers, was dispatched ; several
vessels with colonists were laid on ; and on December 28, 1836, the first
Governor (Captain Hindmarsh) landed on the shores of Holdfast Bay, and in
the presence of the little knot of people who had already arrived proclaimed
in the name of the King the foundation of the colony of South Australia.
The boundaries of the colony at this time were comprised between the
132nd and 141st degrees of east longitude, and between the Southern Ocean
and 26th degree of south latitude. Her territory amounted to nearly
300,000 square miles, or 192,000,000 acres, including Kangaroo Island,
which contains 2,500,000 acres. In 1861, 80,000 square miles of land
between the western boundary of South Australia and the eastern boundary
of Western Australia—a tract of country then known as No Man’s Land—
was added, and the western boundary is now the 129th degree of east
longitude. In 1863 her boundaries were further extended by the addition of
what is known as “ The Northern Territory,” which consists of the country
stretching northward from the 26th degree of south latitude to the Indian
Ocean, and lying between the 129th and the 138th degrees of east longitude.
South Australia therefore now extends from the Southern to the Indian
Ocean, and contains an area of 903,690 square miles, or 578,361,600 acres.
PHYSICAL FEATURES.
This colony has a very extensive coastline, and has a great advantage
over the other provinces of the group in the possession of the two large gulfs
to which we have referred as having been discovered by Flinders in his
voyage in the Investigator. These are named St. Yincent and Spencer, and,
reaching as they do to a considerable extent in the interior, they give means
of water carriage to a very large part of the colony. It was upon the eastern
shore of Gulf St. Yincent that the first settlement took place, and within a
few miles of the landing-place are the capital of the colony and its principal
port. Separating the two gulfs is Yorke’s Peninsula, to which we have
already alluded as being the site of the celebrated Wallaroo and Moonta
Mines. Besides Port Adelaide there are several important harbours
along the shores of the two gulfs, the most noted being Ports Augusta,
Pirie, and Wallaroo in Spencer’s Gulf, and Port Wakefield in St. Vincent’s
Gulf, all of which are termini of important railway systems. Both gulfs
are indented by numerous bays, in many of which jetties have been
erected for the shipment of produce. The coastline between the eastern
entrance to St. Vincent’s Gulf and the boundary of Victoria is rich in bays,
none of them of any great natural suitability for harbours except Lacepede
Bay, which is a splendid reach of water kept in a state of almost permanent
smoothness by some invisible bar. From this port a railway extends inland
towards the Victorian border ; and from a port further to the eastward—
Rivoli Bay—the iron road also runs for a distance of over fifty miles, termi-
nating at Mount Gambier, the principal centre of population in what is
known as the South-Eastern District of South Australia. Although the


Murray runs through our terrritory, and finds its way to the sea in Encounter
Bay, South Australia has not extensive means of river communication.
With this exception there is no navigable stream, and of the Murray we
have only partial possession. It has its rise in the Australian Alps, in New
South Wales, and afterwards forms, for a considerable part of its course, the
boundary-line between that colony and Victoria. Before entering the South
Australian territory it receives the waters of the Murrumbidgee and the
Darling, its chief tributaries, and continues its course until when nearing its
mouth it expands into two lakes of wide expanse but shallow depth, again
narrowing as it flows into the sea near Goolwa. The mouth of the river
is not actually unnavigable, for a regular trade is carried on through it by
at least one steamer ; but it is exposed to the full force of the Southern
Ocean, and is obstructed by a sand bar. the position of which is constantly
shifting. Port Victor, a harbour in Encounter Bay, distant a few miles
from the mouth, has therefore been chosen as the sea terminus of the
Murray. It is connected with Goolwa by a light railway, and very large
harbour works are now going on, which it is hoped will give an immense stimulus
to the river trade, and result in a large part of the produce from the interior
which now goes to the ports of Victoria and New South Wales by railway
coming down the river, so that it can be shipped for the markets of the
world almost direct from the Murray boats. To facilitate this trade a railway
communicating with Adelaide has recently been carried to a point on the
Murray some 180 miles from the mouth, known as the North-West Bend,
and judging from the experience of the past year it is likely to serve its
purpose admirably.
From Cape Jervis, the southern point of Gulf St. Vincent, there extends
for several hundred miles, with more or less definiteness, a chain of hills,
of which the Mount Lofty Range forms the principal and most striking part.
This range runs for a considerable distance within a few miles of the sea, and
forms the eastern limit of the Adelaide plains. Its highest point is Mount
Lofty, which rises to an altitude of 2,334 feet above the sea-level. “The
hills,” as they are commonly called, are constantly resorted to by the people
of Adelaide, and afford within a distance of five or six miles a delightfully
cool climate, with scenery of the utmost beauty. The railway which is now
in course of construction to Nairne will render them more accessible, a.nd
therefore more popular. In the valleys alluvial soil of the richest description
exists, and the advantages of prolific land and equable temperature permit
the cultivation of the most delicate fruits and vegetables at times when they
would be parched and withered by the heat on the plains below.
FLORA AND FAUNA.
The fauna of the Province of South Australia does not differ in any
important particular from that of the remainder of the continent. The
mammalia number somewhere about seventy species, ot which over forty
belong t<> a section of the animal kingdom that has become exinct in almost
every other part of the world, namely, the marsupialia. The birds number
nearly 700 species, remarkable in very many genera—such, for instance, as
the parrots—for the beauty of their plumage, but destitute, with few excep-
tions, of that power of song which is so charming a characteristic of many
of the birds of Europe and America. The fish of our coastline and rivers are
as yet but imperfectly known. From many causes, arising principally from
the physical configuration of this province, the flora is not so diversified as
that of other portions of Australia, where the conditions for the increase of
vegetation are more favourable; consequently the genera and species are


less numerous. The preponderance of the two moat extensive genera, the
Eucalyptus or gum-tree, and Acacia or wattle, gives a peculiar monotony to
the arboreal features of the landscape generally, although many beautiful
shrubs and flowering-plants and ferns reward the searcher after the beauties
of nature. The almost entire absence of edible fruits in the vegetation of
bouth Australia is a remarkable feature, but at the same time few poisonous
plants are known, the one mcst dangerous in the country, and the most
generally distributed, being the Lotus australis.
THE ABORIGINES.
The aborigines of South Australia were never, it appears, numerous in
proportion to the vast area they roamed over, and since the white men have
settled here they have gradually dwindled away, until some tribes have
become wholly extinct, and others have been reduced to mere handfuls of
natives. They were never remarkable for warlike dispositions, although
cunning and treacherous, and their average intelligence is not of a high order,
they live by hunting the kangaroo, emu, and other indigenous creatures,
lead a nomadic life, neither cultivating the soil nor erecting fixed abodes,
ihey are divided into tribes, which have become decimated by internal
quarrels, barbarous customs, disease, and the irresistible march of civilization.
Attempts have been made, and are being continued, to ameliorate the con-
dition of the aborigines by the establishment of training-schools and missions.
A census of the native population was taken in 1876, and gave the number
in the province as 3,953 of all ages and both sexes. Of these about 1 000
only are said to be fp.und in the settled districts. The South Australian natives
have been charged with practising cannibalism and infanticide, and conclusive
proofs that both horrible customs were once followed have been received.
The best-known tribes are the Narrinyerie, the Adelaides (extinct), the
Encounter Bays, the Port Lincolns, the Dieyeries, and the Woolnahs
(Northern Territory), all speaking different dialects. The language is
musical, abounding in vowels and liquids, and several vocabularies of the
best-known dialects have been published. The Australian natives are
believed to be more nearly allied to the Papuan race than any other, but
have so many peculiar characteristics that the period when they and the
Oceanic Papuans were one people must have been very remote. They have
nothing of the type of the negro about them, although their skins are black :
their hair is not woolly, though curly, and they have abundance of hair upon
their face. They display small intelligence in the construction of their
weapons and articles of defence, which are limited to spears, throwing-sticks,
and shields of bark. One weapon they have, however—the boomerang—is
very remarkable, being cut in a peculiar curved form, which gives it the
extraordinary power of returning upon its course when thrown. They show
some cleverness in making nets and baskets of grass or fibre, but their
accomplishments are few as compared with other races of savages. Some
of the South Australian aboriginals who have been civilized, however, have
exhibited considerable intelligence, but the majority of the men are
so imbued with the wild principles of the savage that they
can rarely if ever be depended upon to remain at any settled
employment. The aboriginal men have, as a rule, well-formed shoulders
f n< 7v C V es , ts ’ u .° ad foreheads and noses, large mouths and magnificent
teeth, but their lower limbs are generally weak and small in proportion to
their frames The physical development of the women is poor, and the life
of complete drudgery they undergo at the hands of their lords and masters
soon ages them. Although persevering attempts on the part of benevolent


persona are made to arrest the decay of the native tribes of the province*
there seems to be little hope of their eventually escaping the inevitable fate
of inferior races when opposed to the progress of civilization —it is merely a
question of time.
ADELAIDE, PORT ADELAIDE, AND SUBURBS.
Adelaide, the capital of the province, is beautifully situated on the plain
which lies between Mount Lofty and the eastern shore of St. Vincent’s Gulf.
The site was fixed by Colonel Light, and although in the early days of the
colony great difference of opinion was expressed as to whether his choice was
a wise one, all now agree that no better or more suitable place could have
been selected. Not only has Adelaide all the advantages to be gained by
proximity to the seacoast, but it is surrounded by land of the most fertile
description both in the hills and on the plains, and it is easy of access from
all parts of the country. The city is divided into two parts—North and
South—by the River Torrens, which is spanned by a number of fine bridges.
The Torrens is not a noble stream, but descending from the ranges it serves
a good purpose in supplying Adelaide and its suburbs with a splendid supply
of water, stored in two large reservoirs in the neighbourhood of the hills.
North Adelaide is not so much used for business purposes as for residences.
It rises somewhat abruptly from the banks of the river, and its eminence not
only makes it for sanitary reasons an excellent site for dwellings, but affords
charming views of hill and plain and sea, which makes it a favourite site
for villas. South Adelaide is the centre of business and trade, but also contains
numerous residences. Here are situated all the principal Government offices,
banks, and business and mercantile buildings, many of which are of great
size and of undoubted architectural beauty. King William-street in particular
is a magnificent thoroughfare. It is two chains in breadth, and is thus on©
of the widest streets, not only in the Australian capitals, but in the world.
Moreover, it is ornamented by manv of the finest erections in the city, in-
cluding the Post Office and Town Hall (white freestone structures), the
Government Offices, the Law Offices, seven out of the eight banks doing
business in the colony, and other important edifices. On North-terrace are
the Railway Station, Parliament Houses, Government House, the Institute
and Public Reading-room, the Hospital. The new University buildings,
and a fine public library, are now in course of erection there. At the north-
east corner of the city are located the Botanic Gardens, and beyond
these again one of two asylums provided for the accommo-
dation of the insane. The wholesale houses are mostly situated in
Grenfell and Currie streets : and in Bundle and Bindley streets
the bulk of the retail business is done. We have a large theatre, which is
acknowledged to be one of the handsomest in the colonies, a bijou
theatre and a concert-room, in addition to the Town Hall, which is
largely used for public entertainments, several Clubs, and churches in great
number, many of them being large and of considerable architectural excel-
lence. The city is surrounded by belts of “ Park Lands,” reserved for the
use of the citizens, the total area amounting to no less than 1,850 acres.
There are also six squares in the heart of the town, some of which are taste-
fully planted, and all of them are favourite resorts. South Adelaide is a
mile wide by about a mile and a half in length, and the streets of the
city are broad and laid out at right angles, many of them being planted
with trees, which afford a very welcome shade in summer, besides being
pleasant to the eye. The population of the city proper is now estimated at
over 38,000. Adelaide contains over 8,500 buildings and nearly 79 miles of


made streets, the annual rateable value of the property, excluding Govern-
ment offices, churches, charitable institutions, and schools, which are not
assessed, being £354,000. The total value of the property in the city, at a
low computation, may be put down at not less than from eight to nine
millions sterling. Adelaide is under the control of a Mayor, elected annually
by the citizens, and twelve Councillors, chosen by six wards, one Councillor
for each division being appointed yearly. Water is supplied from the two
reservoirs we have already alluded to, gas is laid on by a private Company,
and an efficient system of deep drainage is now being provided under a
scheme approved by the late Mr. W. Clark, C.E.
In almost all directions the city is surrounded by populous and, in most
cases, well-built suburbs, and new townships are constantly being laid out.
To the east are Kensington, Norwood, Kent Town, Stepney, Magill, Glen
Osmond, and other places ; to the south, Unley, Mitcham, Fullarton, Good-
wood, Parkside, and lesser townships ; to the west, Hindmarsh, Bowden,
Thebarton, and Brompton, which are largely occupied for manufacturing
purposes ; and to the north, amongst others, Walkerville, Prospect, Medindie,
and Ovingham. To several of the suburbs tramways have recently been
laid down, and others are in course of cotstruction. It is worthy of remark
that, except for an abortive attempt made in Sydney some years ago, Adelaide
is the first city in Australia proper in which the tramway has been introduced,
and this means of travelling has become highly popular. There are also
numerous seaside resorts, chief among which are Glenelg—the calling-place
of the P. & O. steamers—a largely-peopled and handsome towncont aining
many fine residences ; and the Semaphore, at which the Orient and other
ocean steamers call. There are also Marino, Brighton, Henley Beach, the
Grange, and other places which are more or less rapidly increasing in
popularity and importance. Glenelg is connected with the city by two
railways, constructed by private Companies. The Semaphore is reached by
a continuation of the railway which connects Adelaide and its chief port.
Port Adelaide is about eight miles from the capital, and is built upon an
arm of the sea, being thus sheltered from all the prevailing winds. A large
expenditure in dredging is continually going on, and the wharf accommoda-
tion is constantly being increased. As a safe harbour it cannot be surpassed,
but a scheme originated several years ago for establishing p.n outer harbour,
principally as a calling-place for the large steamers which visit Australia, is
still under consideration, and if it is carried out great advantages will accrue
to the colony from the additional facilities afforded Port Adelaide, like the
city, is surrounded by suburbs, with some of which it is connected by rail-
way, and with others by tramway. It contains many important public and
mercantile buildings, and gives good evidence of the prosperity of the colony,
of which it is the chief harbour. We must not omit a reference to the
numerous country towns, which are well laid out, contain many large and
handsome buildings, and are the centres of trade for extensive areas of
country which surround them. Many of these towns are under municipal
government.
PROGRESS OF SETTLEMENT.
Considering the limited population of South Australia, only amounting
to 260,000 persons, about a third of whom reside in the city and suburbs, the
extent of country that is profitably occupied in farming, pastoral pursuits,
wine and fruit growing, and manufactures is creditable to the enterprise
of the people. The area of land sold to the end of December last was
9,229 acres, being an average of over 35 acres for every soul in the


community. The returns of cultivation for 1879 are not yet issued, but
taking the figures for 1878 we find that about one-fourth of the land alienated
was under cultivation. In 1869-70, with a population of 178,722, we culti-
vated 850,576 acres, or 4|- acres per head. In 1878-9 the rate of cultivation
had advanced to 8j acres per head of the population. In addition, however,
to nine million acres which have been alienated from the Crown, principally
for agricultural and horticultural settlement, immense tracts of country are
leased or otherwise held from the Government for pastoral purposes. A
quarter of a century ago these tracts did not exceed 5,000 or 6,000 square
miles ; in 1875 they had increased to 80,000 square miles ; on June 30,1879,
the area reached the enormous quantity of 213,700 square miles, or
136,768,000 acres of land. These figures will serve to show what marvellous
progress is being made in the direction of pastoral and agricultural
settlement in the province. But, after all, if we exclude the runs
in the interior taken up by some of the more adventurous of our
squatters, the settlements are a mere fringe along the coast, and there is
yet room for indefinite expansion and progress. The work of exploration to
which South Australia owes the practical possession of such a large territory—
is still going on, and year by year fresh discoveries are being made which add
largely°to the capabilities of the colony. South Australia, indeed, owes a
great debt of gratitude to those men who, regardless of personal peril, have
penetrated into the unknown parts of the continent and proved that vast
tracts of country which were thought to be worthless can be turned to profit-
able account. Captain Sturt, as we have pointed out, was the first to dissi-
pate the idea that “ the south coast of Australia is barren and in every respect
unfavourable for colonization.” By him other valuable explorations were
made when in later times he held the post of Surveyor-General of South
Australia. Ten years after Sturt’s journey down the Murray, Eyre travelled
through what are now some of our most fertile agricultural districts in be-
ginning that memorable journey to King George’s Sound which will ever be
remembered as a triumph of persevering heroism. Since that day the work
has been carried on by numbers of intrepid men, among whom must be
numbered John McDouall Stuart, who, after two unsuccessful attempts, was
the first to cross the continent at its greatest breadth from north to south,
and over his track the overland telegraph now runs; John McKinlay, who
also traversed Australia and opened up large tracts of good country ; Peter
Eger ton Warburton, who, not content with the efforts of his earlier days,
recently at an advanced age succeeded, after enduring great privations, m
crossing to the coast of Western Australia ; Ernest Giles, whose explorations
have been conducted with equal success in the same direction, and others,
such as Frome, Horrocks, Goyder, Babbage, Gosse, Freeling, Boss, Swinden,
and Hack, who, although their journeys have not become so celebrated as
those of others whom we have mentioned, have done much in preparing the
way for the successful occupation of the country. South Australian territory
has also been to a large extent traversed by explorers from other colonies,
who have added considerably to the knowledge of our territory. But although
so much has been done, great interest is still felt in the subject of exploration.
Parties equipped by the Government are constantly in the field examining in
detail country that has been but cursorily examined, and it is to be hoped
that private enterprise will still be brought to bear upon the exploration of
the interior.
CLIMATE.
The climate of South Australia, though liable to frequent changes of
temperature, is one of the healthiest and most delightful in the world. In


the height of summer the heat is frequently excessive, the thermometer
having on a few occasions registered 115° (Fahrenheit) in the shade, but a
week rarely passes without two or three days of cool breezes, and even at the
greatest heat the air is so dry that there is none of the oppression felt in
moister climates. Ram falls in every month of the year, but the greatest
quantity, of course, comes in the winter, which is at its height in the months
of June, July, and August. The average rainfall for the year in the
neighbourhood of Adelaide is about inches. Rain is rarely continuous
and even at the wettest season bright sunny days are the rule rather than the
exception. The temperature in the daytime in the depth of winter is very
seldom below 50 ; but in the hilly districts ice is frequently seen, and snow
occasionally falls there. Besides being admirably suited to innumerable
vegetable productions, of which we shall speak hereafter, the climate of
bouth Australia has been found very beneficial to persons suffering from
WcaK CIIGSIS.
PROGRESS.
The brief sketch that we have given of the history and progress of South
Australia shows that from small beginnings the colony has been raised to a
very satisfactory position. Her advancement has been upon the firm base
laid by the prudence, sagacity, and industry of her founders, and as a
natural result it has been sure and constant. The last few years have been
years of more rapid development—a fact that is amply shown by the detailed
articles and tabular statements which follow—but there is every likelihood
that in the future progress will be still more marked, and that the province
will attain to a yet higher rank among the colonies which will one day be
united in a great Australian federation.
- LITERATURE, ARTS, &c.
As might be expected, the colony has not so far made much advance-
ment in literature and art. The people have been too closely engaged in
practical work to turn their attention to such pursuits. Of newspapers there
is a full share, but the fruits of more matured literary effort have so far not
k® 6 * l copious. A few South Australian authors have given books to the
world, but they have not been generally of a class to ensure immortality to
the writers. In arts, too, we are far behind ; but surely, if slowly, higher
tastes and a more general appreciation for refined studies are being developed
amongst us. What we can fairly boast of is that, as regards natural unre-
strained social intercourse, and the ready attention to the claims of needy
or suffering humanity, the community stands unsurpassed, if not unrivalled
in Australia.
POPULATION.
The population of the colony has not multiplied at such a rapid rate as
could have been wished, but the advance has been steady and continuous.
ISatural increase has been the chief source of supply, but immigration at the
public expense has also contributed somewhat to the population The
number of persons now coming here from the United Kingdom is rapidly
increasing, owing largely to the greater facilities provided by the P. &O.
and Orient Steam Companies, each of which have steamers calling at our
ports fortnightly. The Orient steamers proceed direct from London, via
Plymouth, to Port Adelaide, and make the through voyage in from 36 to 40
days, thus affording excellent opportunities to persons of all classes who
propose maxing South Australia their future home. The Government offer
special inducements in the shape of Land Order Warrants (referred to im


page 2) to all suitable persons proceeding direct to the colony and intending
to remain here. During the last two or three years a considerable number
of persona have come here from the neighbouring colonies, and principally
from Victoria, which at one time offered attractions irresistible to many
South Australians. The total inhabitants of the province is, as we have
before mentioned, estimated at 260,000 During 1879 the births numbered
9,902, marriages 2,229, and deaths 3,580, the excess of births over deaths
being thus 6,322. The proportion to each thousand of the population
was —births, 38'8; marriages, 8'78; and deaths, 14 03. The marriage rate
in 1869 was only 6*68, and the increase was steady until 1878, when the
rate was 9 47. Last year, owing to temporary depression, there was a slight
falling off.
GOVERNMENT AND LEGISLATION.
The privilege of constitutional government was not conferred upon
South Australia until many years after the foundation of the colony. Its
affairs were originally under the control of a Board of Commissioners
resident in London, represented in the colony by a Commissioner of Public
Lands. The powers given to the Board by Act of Parliament in 1834 were
to borrow money to carry on the government of the colony, and to defray the
cost of transporting emigrants. The Board had but a brief existence. The
Act provided that a form of local government should be granted to the
province as soon as its population reached 50,000 persons, but it was some
years before this had been effected. The Commissioners did not at first find
their task one easy of accomplishment. In order to assist them in their
endeavour to found the colony, the South Australian Company was formed,
mainly through the exertions of the late Mr. George Fife Angas, who
relinquished his post of Commissioner and became Chairman of the Company.
Under the operations of this Association the work of colonization proceeded,
and from the appointment of Captain John Hindmarsh as Governor in 1836
until the year 1851 the work of local legislation was carried on by the
Governor and a Legislative Council, consisting of four non-official members,
all appointed by the Governor. In 1851 the first Constitution was granted
to the province. A new Legislative Council was constituted, which was to
consist of twenty-four members, one-third to be nominated by the Crown,
and two-thirds to be elected by the people every five years. Members of this
Council were required to possess freehold property of not less than £2OO annual,
or £2,000 total value. Voting was based upon a small property or household
qualification, and persons holding property in more than one district were
allowed to vote for members in each district in which their property was
situated. This Council, however, had no control over the land revenue,
which was expended by authority of the Governor alone.
The new Council was no sooner fairly formed than the colonists began to
agitate for responsible government in its entirety, and in 1856 the present
Constitution Act was passed, and having received the Royal sanction was
proclaimed in the colony in October of that year. By this Act the work of
legislation devolves upon a Governor and two Houses of Parliament.
The Parliament is triennial, and the sessions are generally held
annually. The two Houses are called respectively the Legislative Council
and the House of Assembly. For electing members to the former the whole
province is one electoral district. A member must be thirty years of age, and
must have resided in the colony for three years. Electors for the Legislative
Council must be twenty-one years of age, and have a freehold estate of £SO
value, or a leasehold of £2O annual value with three years unexpired, or


must occupy a dwelling-house of £2O annual value. There are eighteen
members of the Legislative Council, who nominally retain their seats for
twelve years. As, however, there is a provision that one-third ©f their
number shall retire every fourth year, the average length of service is re-
duced by deaths and resignations to considerably under twelve years. This
House cannot be dissolved by the Governor. The House of Assembly at first
consisted of thirty-six members, elected by seventeen districts, two of which
returned only one member, while Adelaide returned six. In 1801 a redistri-
bution of seats was made, based upon population. The colony was then
divided into eighteen districts, each electing two members. In the session of
1874 a further alteration was made, by which the colony was divided into
twenty-two electoral districts, three returning three members each, one re-
turning one, and the remainder two each, so that the Parliament now con-
sists of forty-six members. The division of the electoral districts, owing to
the increase of the population and the progress of settlement, stands once
more in need of alteration. An agitation is proceeding for an alteration of
the Constitution of the Legislative Council, which, it is felt, does not provide
adequate means for bringing the House into accord with public opinion.
Several Reform Bills have been introduced by Government and private
members, but none have as yet proved acceptable. A Bill to consolidate and
amend the electoral laws was passed last session. The principal changes
effected in the existing law relate to the management of elections, and
provide for punishing persons guilty of offences against the Act. Vito,
a view, too, of lessening the cost of elections, it is provided that,
if a certain number of electors do not vote at any polling-place
it shall be abolished until such time as it may be found necessary to
re-establish it. Under the present Constitution Act all persons qualified to
vote are eligible to become members of the Assembly, which is elected by
manhood suffrage, the only requirements being that the voter shall be
twenty-one years of age, that his name shall have been on the electoral roll
six months and that he is untainted by felony. Aliens not naturalized are
incapable of voting ; but all that is required to become a naturalized subject
is to take an oath of allegiance and pay a fee of 10s. 6d. All elections are
conducted by ballot. Judges, officiating ministers of religion, and aliens who
have not lived five years in the colony, are ineligible for election to either
The Executive Government is, as in England, dependent upon Parlia-
mentary majorities. The Executive Council consists of the members of the
Ministry for the time being, with the Governor, who is appointed by the
Queen, and is her accredited representative, as President. Members accepting
office in the Administration are not required to go to their constituencies for
re-relection. The Ministry recognised by the Constitution Act of 18ob
consisted of five members, who were all required to have seats in Parliament.
A few years ago a sixth Minister was added, and provision has been made that
the Attorney-General need not necessarily be a member of the Legislature.
The Ministry is now composed of the Chief Secretary, Attorney-General,
Treasurer, Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration, Commissioner
of Public Works, and Minister of Education, each with a salary of iI,UUU
per annum Any member of the Legislature renders his seat vacant by
any office of emolument under the Crown excepting those above-
mentioned, and the same restriction exists with regard to contracts under
the Government ; moreover, the members are required to take an oath or
make affirmation of allegiance to the Sovereign of Great Britain. All the
affairs of the colony, including the management of the Crown lands, the
proceeds of which have been placed entirely at the disposal of the colonists,


are under the control of the two Houses of the Legislature. The Houses
possess equal powers, with the exception that the Legislative Council cannot
originate any measure for appropriating any part of the revenue or for
imposing, altering, or repealing any rate, tax duty, or impost. The whole
of the details of the financial affairs of the colony are dealt with by
the Assembly, the duty of the Council being to consider such measures as
are described above after they have been passed by the Assembly. Several
taxation Bills have been vetoed by the Council in the exercise of this power.
The public expenditure is entirely regulated by the House of Assembly,
in whose hands consequently rests the power of making and unmaking
Ministries. The present Governor is Sir William Irancis Drummond
Tervois K.G.C.M.G., C. 8., and the Ministry of the day is composed as
follows’—Hon. William Morgan, M.LC., Chief Secretary and Premier;
Hon. Charles Mann, Q.C., M.P., Treasurer and Leader of the House of
Assembly; Hon. W. H. Bundey, Q C., MP., Attorney-General; Horn T.
Plavford M.P. Commissioner of Crown Lands and Immigration, Don.
G. C. Hawker, M. A., M. P., Commissioner of Public Works ; and the
Hon. T. King, M.P., Minister of Education.
The colony possesses complete self-government all but in name. The Crown
retains power to disallow measures opposed to the principles of Imperial legis-
lation ; and Bills affecting the well as some others, nave to be
reserved for the royal assent, which is, however, in most cases a formal pro-
ceeding, and hence the government may be said to be a pure form.of
democracy The two Houses model their proceedings in accordance with the
practice of the House of Commons, and similar forms are observed m both
Houses. The Legislative Council is presided over by a President, and the
Assembly by a Speaker, and but one member of the Ministry—generally the
Chief Secretary—has a seat in the Council. There is no distinction between
the classes of members of the two Houses, and neither House can be said to
be representative of a class, both Chambers being returned solely in the
interests of the whole community. The members of the Council are dignified
by the title of “ Honourable.” The majority of the members of both Houses
are engaged in commercial pursuits. Owing to there being no broadly defined
political parties, the tenure of office of Ministers is very precarious, and very
frequent changes of Administrations occur. This is not altogether an un-
mitigated evil, as it guards against corruption in the distribution of olhcial
patronage, but it operates detrimentally in many ways to public business. The
Ivil is one, however, which it may be hoped will be remedied m course of
time. Indeed, it is noteworthy that the present Ministry, with one slight
modification, has held office since September, 1878. Notwithstanding the
frequent struggles for office that occur, the proceedings of the South
Australian Parliament have always been of an orderly character, and have
fortunately not been marked by any of the discreditable scenes and disturb
ances which have become so common in other colonial Legislative Assernblies.
Moreover, the legislation has, generally speaking, been of a practical and
progressive character. Indeed, in several respects, as in the enactment of the
Real Property Act, and in the Act authorizing the marriage of a man with his
deceased wife’s sister, the colony has taken the lead iniinportantrefor ms.
None of the members are paid except the Ministers, the President of the
Council, the Speaker, and the Chairman of Committees ; and the expenses of
Parliament are consequently not very g^at— averaging between
£II,OOO per annum. There is no official Hansard staff, but unde
arrangements with the proprietors of the EegisUr reports of the proceedings
of Parliament, after being published in that paper and supplied to members
for correction, are bound up in a separate volume for reference.


REAL PROPERTY ACT.
This measure, of which South Australia may justly feel proud,
inaugurated a new and simple mode of conveyancing which swept away the
heavy expenses and evils attendant upon the old system of tranferring real
property. The author of the measure, which first came into force in
was Mr. R. R. Torrens, afterwards Registrar-General of South Australia,
and now Sir R. R. Torrens, lately a member of the House of Commons for
Cambridge. The principles of the Act are thus set forth by a Commission
appointed to enquire into its provisions and working : —“ The objects of the
Real Property Act are to give security and simplicity to all dealings with
land, by providing that the title shall depend upon registration, that all
interests shall be capable of appearing or being protected upon the face of
the registry, and that a registered title or interest shall never be affected by
any claim or charge which is not registered. By this system every one who
acquires any estate or interest in land, upon being registered as owner thereof
obtains a title absolutely secure as against every one whose claim does not
appear upon the registry ; and the two elements of simplicity and security as
regards the acquisition of land appear to be effectually attained. ” All land
alienated from the Crown in this province since 1858 is declared to be under
the Real Property Act; and land acquired before that date may be brought
under its operation upon application after certain precautionary public
notices have been given. Several amendments, found necessary by expe-
rience, have been made in the Act, and a certain amount of protection is now
definitely given to equities arising in connection with properties; but the
main principle has always been successfully maintained, and the value of
property now brought under the Act amounts to several millions sterling.
The fees upon transfers, mortgages, and transmissions are small, and
transactions under the Act are so simple as rarely to call for the
intervention of a solicitor. Where a block of land is subdivided separate
certificates of title are issued by the department for each allotment,
and the greatest care is taken in defining the measurements and
boundaries. The survey of all Crown lands is effected by officials in the
employ of the Government, so that the risks of confusion and complication
in reference to the interests of different owners which exist in England do
not arise here. All applications to bring land under the Act are examined
by solicitors specially appointed for the purpose, and have to be passed by a
lay tribunal known as the Lands Titles Commissioners. If the application
is approved a certificate of title is issued, and all the old deeds are cancelled.
Thus sources of error or opportunities for fraud seldom occur, and costly
‘‘abstracts of title” are unknown. In fact, the title embodied in the
certificate issued from the Lands Titles Office is to all intents and purposes
indefeasible. The South Australian Act, slightly altered, has been adopted
by all the Australian Colonies.
THE LAND AND ITS OCCUPATION.
HISTORY OF LAND LEGISLATION.
The labours of the first settlers in South Australia were without a
moment’s delay devoted to the task of subduing the wilderness. Their
attention was first directed to the fertile plain lying between the sea and
the Mount Lofty Ranges. The progress of settlement outwards from
Adelaide was for years exceedingly ‘slow. The statistics of these infantile


times in South Australian history are very imperfect, but we find that as late
as 1841 the total area of land under cultivation was no more than 6,722 acres,
of which 4,154 acres was devoted to wheat-growing ; that there were but 890
horses, something like 20,000 cattle, and no more than a quarter of a million
sheep. The difficulty of obtaining labour was a serious drawback. It is
true that the system under which the colony had been founded provided that
the proceeds of the sale of waste lands were to be devoted to the bringing out
of immigrants, but at this time the quantity of land alienated did not greatly
exceed 300,000 acres, and much of the money thus raised found other em-
ployment than in introducing man-power. A terribly hard struggle these
pioneers had, and more than once heart and hope were on the point of failing
them. Step by step, however, difficulties were overcome. The cultivation of
wheat, begun with fear and trembling as a hazardous experiment, proved to
be a most remunerative undertaking. By-and-by courageous colonists pushed
their way into the ranges, and from the rich hill-sides and richer bottom lands
great store of grain and vegetables found its way to the young metropolis.
The hopes of the settlers for the future success of South Australia as an agri-
cultural country were long dubious, owing to the exceedingly limited area
supposed to be fit for wheat growing. The districts south and east and
north-east of Adelaide, and between the city and the sea westward, were
thought to offer iuducements to the farmer, but people looked askance at the
vast tracts of country, much of it scrubby, some of it heavily timbered,
extending away to the northwards, and the sanguine souls who dreamed of
the time when these territories would be brought under the plough were
pitied as unreasonable enthusiasts. The plains extending northward to
Gawler, a distance of some twenty-five miles, were doubtless fertile, but
beyond that stretched vast regions doomed to no better fate than a perpetual
occupancy by cattle and sheep. How unfounded these forebodings have
proved to be the present generation of colonists know full well.
The law under which settlement was entered upon contemplated the eut-
ting-up of the land into eighty-acre blocks and the sale of it at £1 an acre.
Owing to the difficulty experienced in London in disposing of the quantity
which it was thought necessary to alienate before inaugurating the work of
colonization the area purchasable for ,£BO was increased to 134 acres, and thus
a number of persons came to hold what are known as preliminary sections.
With each of these sections the buyer received a town acre in payment of an
additional one pound ; and it is significant of the enormous increase in the
value of city property that an allotment in Adelaide which cost the original
purchaser a few shillings an acre has been sold at the rate of £260 a foot
frontage. After the colony had been formally established the upset price of
country land was kept at £1 an acre, and that rate has been maintained ever
since. The upset price for township allotments, and blocks suburban
to townships, varies according to position and other circumstances, the
upset price being fixed by the Governor on the recommendation of
the Surveyor-General. As a means of deciding between competing
claimants for the same land the auction test was introduced ; but for
many years the competition, except for choice blocks, was not brisk. The
population being small, the requirements for legitimate purposes of cultiva-
tion were small also. As time progressed it did not suit the convenience of
the Government that alienation should go on at so tardy a rate as would have
been the case had sales been kept down to the actual needs of settlement.
The land furnished a facile source of revenue, and hundreds of thousands of
acres were forced into the market. Persons who had taken up country for
pastoral purposes, finding that they had no alternative between purchasing
their runs and being driven off them by other purchasers, exhausted every


effort to raise funds to pay the price demanded by the Government, and thus
it came to pass that immense estates were amassed under pressure which now
are worth almost fabulous sums. But the pastoral tenants and the agri-
cultural settlers combined could not absorb all the land offered for sale, and
so encouragement was given to a class of middlemen who bought for specu-
lative purposes. In process of time the existence of this class led to terrible
abuse. Holding as they came to do vast tracts of land, it was necessary for
some of them to resort to peculiar shifts to dispose of it. Had things gone
on in a natural course they would speedily have been surfeited, and the
ordinary buyer would have been still able to obtain his eighty acres or more,
as the case might be, in the Government auction mart for a trifle over £1
an acre. To prevent this a system of levying blackmail was initiated, which
grew to scandalous proportions. Numbers of the middlemen attended the
auctions for no other purpose than to be bought-off, and it frequently
happened that the bona-fide purchaser had to pay a commission to several of
these cormorants to prevent their bidding against him, and running-up the
price to an unreasonable limit. The natural consequence of this was that it
became cheaper to buy from an agent land previously alienated. So out-
rageous at last did this evil become that legislative action had to be taken
against the blackmailers, and severe penalties were enacted to put a stop to
their nefarious practices. To some extent this had the desired effect; but
it required the complete alteration in the land laws which was adopted in
after years to put an end to the doings of the so-called “ land sharks.”
Between the years 1841 and 1852 the progress made in the alienation of
land and its application to farming purposes was comparatively slow.
These were the„ days before the process of forcing land into the
market, to which we have referred, began. The financial wants of
the Government were comparatively small, the revenue during the last-
mentioned year being under a quarter of a million sterling, and the
expenditure much less than that. The total alienation of land for the
twelve months was but 86,672 acres, and the area of land under cultivation,
at the outside computation, 80,000 acres. The opening-up of the gold-
fields in Victoria marked an entirely new departure in the history of settle-
ment. Hundreds of South Australian colonists who had done well at the
diggings returned to settle on the lands, bringing with them scores of other
persons, who, finding the land laws more liberal, and the prospects of reward
for steady plodding work brighter here than in the neighbouring colonies,
took up farms and prospered upon them. Up to this time the land-
sharking had not developed to any extent, and for £1 Os. 6d.
an acre many a good holding was obtained. It was not long
before the fallacious notion was exploded that wheat would not
grow beyond Gawler, and north, south, and east spread the stream of
agricultural settlement. In 1853—213,321 acres were sold, and although in
some subsequent years the area disposed of fell below this, the acreage culti-
vated exhibited a regular and even a rapid advance. In 1854 it reached
129,692 acres ; five years later it had increased to 361,884 acres ; and by 1867
it had gone up to 810,734 acres. From this time forward for some years
there came a marked decrease in the rate of progress. To this result several
causes contributed. Farmers who had purchased or leased eighty-acre sec-
tions some years before began to find that the area was insufficient to pro-
vide them with a sustenance. Continuous cropping, chiefly with wheat, had
diminished greatly the producing capacity of their small holdings, and at the
same time their families had grown up and required a wider field for their
operations. The system of land-sharking already referred to had now reached
its height, and fresh farms could only be obtained upon extravagant terms.


Thus cramped in their old homesteads, and heavily handicapped in their
efforts to get new ones, farmers began to turn their eyes longingly to other
colonies, and especially to Victoria, where the land laws had been greatly
liberalized and where there seemed a prospect of shaking-off the malign in-
fluence of the blackmailer. Hundreds of farmers, and among them scores ot
Germans who had come to South Australia in early days, and had by their
industry and thrift made a little money, which they were fearful of losing,
set off in search of fresh fields and pastures new. It was not long before
the exodus across the Border became so alarming as to excite the attention
of Parliament, and session after session Bills were introduced to amend the
land laws. It was not until 1869, however, that the reformatory action took
practical shape. In that year an Act was passed providing for free selection
after survey in certain declared areas, the selector being allowed a certain
number of years to pay his purchase-money, but being compelled in the
meanwhile to pay interest at a moderate rate and to comply with certain con-
ditions of residence and improvement. The thin end of the wedge of a
liberal system being thus inserted, it was not long before it was driven home.
Year after year further reforms were introduced, until at last the method
now in force of disposing of the lands was instituted In this which will be
found described further on, there are no doubt still some defects, but in
many respects it is far more liberal than that of any other Australian colony
The effect of the new legislation was almost magical. The migration of feouth
Australian farmers elsewhere was checked, and if the terms offered av ®
failed to attract any very great number of settlers from abroad, they at ail
events have led to an expansion of settlement and of cultivation which com-
pletely throws into the shade the progress made in the same direction in
other provinces of the Australian group. The demand for land for agricul-
tural purposes has grown with such astonishing rapidity that it has
been difficult for the surveyors to keep pace with the re-
quirements of purchasers. Runs held for pastoral Purposes, par-
ticularly in the North, have been resumed by wholesale, and vast tracts ot
country which not long ago were declared uncultiyable have been seized
upon by selectors, and at the cost of comparatively little outlay m clearing
and ploughing have been made to yield abundant harvests. As a conse-
quence of the stimulus given by legislation to agriculture the yearly increase
in land brought under crop has been enormous. In 1870 it sprung from
850 576 to 959,009 acres, and each twelvemonth since has witnessed a like
advance, until we can boast of a cultivated area of more than two and a
quarter million acres. As we have before pointed out, ten years ago, with a
population of 178,722 souls, the land under cultivation was at the. rate ot
4facres per head ; now, with a population of over 260,000, it amounts to
between 8 and 9 acres a head.
THE PRESENT LAND ALIENATION LAWS.
The great aim of the Land Laws now in force is to promote agricultural
settlement as contradistinguished from other forms of occcupatinn l
former times the farmer, the stock-breeder, the person desirous of founding
a large estate, and the speculator all met together in the auction-room and
pafd cash ?or the blocks of land that fell to their share as the result of
bidding We have already explained how by this arrangement the bona-fide
agriculturist was often pushed to the wall or made- the victim of extortion.
The fundamental aim of the Acts now in force is “ ot *7ckofalHho
this harassing and unfair competition, but to give him thes first pi lck ° E a J.* h ®
country offered for sale. The modus operand* .is as follows .—To begin with,
notice is given to a certain number of pastoral tenants occupying waste lands


of the Crown upon lease that their runs are to be resumed within a certain
period—it may be six or it may be twelve months, according as the law
demands. This done, the lands are surveyed into sections not exceeding 500
acres in extent, and the whole of those situated within certain hundreds are
advertised for sale on a fixed day. The intending buyers having assembled are
divided into two classes—those who contemplate residing personally upon the
land they take up, and those who intend to place another person, known as a
substitute, on the land they select, to farm for them. The policy of the
law is to give especial encouragement to the former class, and accordingly
in the first place it devolves upon them to bid for the sections comprised in
the area or hundred offered. The highest bidder for the section that is first
put up is empowered to select a sufficient quantity to make his holding
up to 1,000 acres, if ordinary country lands, or 640 acres if lands reclaimed
by drainage. Another section is then offered, and so on until all the
°P en on day has been submitted, or until there are no further
biddings. The like course is then followed in regard to the second
class of purchasers, the unselected sections being offered for their
biddings. When the auction is over the remaining sections (if any) become
available for selection at £1 an acre, which is the upset price in the
case of all ordinary country lands. The blocks having been selected,
either at the time of the auction or afterwards, the purchaser is re-
quired to pay down 10 per cent, of the amount he has agreed to give, and
for three years this is the only payment he is required to make to the
Government. This payment is not reckoned as part of the purchase-
money, but as interest or rent for the period named. He has further to
enter into an agreement with the Government (1) to make substantial
improvements, in the shape of buildings, fencing, well-sinking, reservoir-
making draining, or clearing and grubbing, to the value of ss. an acre
during the first two years, of 7s. 6d. an acre during three years, and 10s, an
acre during four years ; (2) to plough and have under cultivation not less than
one-tenth of the land during the first year, and at least one-fifth during
subsequent years ; and (3) to reside on the land personally or by substitute
as the case may be. At the end of the third year he has to pay a second
instalment of 10 per cent, interest to carry him on for other three years. At
the end of the sixth year he must pay a fourth of the purchase-money and
interest on the balance at 10 per cent., which will meet all his obligations up
to the close of the ninth year, when he is expected to complete his purchase
and obtain possession of his deeds. It is further provided that the selector
may from time to time, as he is able, pay off portions of the purchase-money,
and in the case of personal residents the right is given to pay for the land
outright at any time after five years from the date of selection. From this
abstract it will be seen that the principles of the Act are :—First, purchase
after survey ; second, deferred payments ; third, limitation of area held upon
credit to 1,000 acres of ordinary lands, or 640 acres if lands reclaimed by
drainage ; fourth, conditions of improvement and cultivation ; fifth, as far
as possible compulsory personal residence. In cases where a selector wishes
to obtain a portion of a section only to complete his maximum area, he is
permitted to have such portion on paying the cost of survey.
There are some other features in our land system which deserve notice.
Thus, although ordinarily the upset price of land is £1 an acre, there are
exceptions, as in the instance of township allotments and suburban sections,
—the upset price is invariably higher—sale is by open auction, and the terms
are cash. Again, in the case of what are known as reclaimed lands—that is,
lands which have been rendered available for cultivation by drainage—the
cost of reclamation is added to the upset price—the usual interest is charged


upon the total amount and deferred payment allowed for the land and the cost
of reclamation, and the largest area that any selector can take up is 640 acres.
Then there are special provisions in the case of poorer or scrub lands, persons
being allowed to take up a large area on a twenty-one years’ lease with right
of purchase, the rental being fixed very low' conditionally upon money being
expended in clearing the land. Furthermore, it is provided that any
country land which has been open for selection during two years may be put
up to auction and sold for cash to the highest bidder, the upset price being,
however, still kept at 20s. an acre. Finally, there are lands which have
failed to attract purchasers either by private contract or at auction, which
are let in large blocks at a moderate rental, no conditions of improvement
being imposed, although a right of purchase is granted. It is worthy of note
that, notwithstanding the introduction of so many modes of occupancy
and alienation, the State has remained faithful to the principle
established in early times of demanding at least £1 an acre
for all territory which it parts with. That it has not suffered
by its firmness in this particular is manifest, for the demand for land
has been steadily maintained, and each year hundreds of thousands
of acres pass into private hands, much of it to be immediately
brought under cultivation. Altogether the purchase of 5,296,858 acres had
been completed at the end of 1879, and there were besides at that date
3,180,955 acres held upon credit, the greater proportion of which will in
due course pass absolutely to the purchasers.
AGRICULT UR AL SETTLEMENT.
The general character of the land in South Australia, so far as it has been
taken up for farming purposes, is in a high degree favourable for advan-
tageous settlement. It may be divided into three classes—the plains, which
for the most part are at once, available for the plough ; hilly country,
where more or less clearing is necessary to be done to fit it for cultivation ;
and scrub lands, which in some cases are of very inferior quality, but in
others are only kept from being cultivated owing to the expense and labour
that would be involved in removing the timber. A fourth class might be
added, consisting of comparatively level country, sprinkled with sheaoak and
other small timber, which can be removed at a comparatively slight cost.
Notwithstanding the comparative dryness of the climate, the rainfall being
about 21J inches, the soil proves very productive. Not only do English
fruits and cereals of all kinds grow to perfection, but many semi-tropical
fruits and vegetables do equally well, the earth yielding a bountiful return
for a very moderate expenditure of labour. The system of farming resorted
to in South Australia is unfortunately, as a rule, still very careless. There
is not sufficient care taken to return to the soil the ingredients which are
taken from it by the process of vegetable growth. The land is cropped year
after year, for the most part with wheat, until it becomes thoroughly
exhausted. This wasteful system has no doubt been greatly encouraged by
the extent of new country available for occupation, and, of course, as settle-
ment spreads, and the quantity of cultivable virgin soil diminishes, a change
will take place in this respect. As we have before mentioned, the area of
land tilled in South Australia is, as compared with the population, enormous,
far surpassing anything known in the other colonies. Besides wheat, the
staple growth of the colony, attention is bestowed upon the production of
hay, barley, oats, rye, potatoes, field peas, lucerne, and, to a small extent, flax,
hops, and artificial grasses ; but the whole of these articles combined do not
occupy much more than one-half the area devoted to wheat. The total yield of
barley during 1878-9 was 142,933 bushels, gathered from 12,089 acres; of oats,


35,202 bushels, from 2,931 acres; of peas, 48,191 bushels, from 4,233 acres ; of
hay, 210,974 tons, from 218,369 acres; and of potatoes, 14,378 tons, from 5,398
acres. It should be stated that a number of Associations exist throughout
the colony which give attention to agricultural matters. The Central
Association—the Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society—carries on
operations upon a very large scale, and is doing useful work in promoting
the interests of the cultivator of the soil. Within the last year or two
Farmers’ Associations, on pretty much the same model as the “ Granges” of
America, have been organized in different parts of the country.
The system of wheat-growing in the colony is extremely simple. The
selector merely ploughs the ground to the depth of a few inches, seldom more
than six ; the seed is usually sown broadcast, and if it is not put in after the
proper season, and if there is no visitation of red rust or other destructive
plague, a crop of from ten to twenty bushels an acre is obtained, according to
the quality of the land. In the older agricultural districts the yield is often
very small, as there are difficulties to be coped with in the shape of weeds
and exhaustion of the soil, resulting from continual cropping without manure
for the past ten, twenty, or thirty years. The commonest plan in such cases
is to allow the land to lie fallow and depasture cattle upon it for a year or
two, after which it will often again yield a remunerative crop of wheat. The
keeping of sheep has of late years become a favourite expedient for recruiting
the soil. Red rust, locusts, a disease known as takeall, from the fact of its
entirely destroying patches of the crop, hot winds, and storms are among the
chief ills with which farmers have to cope. Of late years many of the farms
in the old districts have gone into pastoral occupation, the small holders
having sold out and obtained land from the Government in one or other of
the newly-opened districts. The land now being occupied is thus from 60
to 280 miles from Adelaide, and situate from a few hundred yards to a hundred
miles from shipping places on the coast. The extent of land under cultivation
with wheat is increasing with amazing rapidity, the figures fcr last season being
1,458,096 acres. The production of wheat at the last harvest gathered in
December, 1879, was 14,260,964 bushels, the season being a moderately
favourable one. The increase on the totals of the preceding year was in area
152,245 acres ; in quantity 5,028,915 bushels. The ability to gather in the
largely extending areas of corn is explained by the fact that harvesting in
South Australia is done by means of Ridley’s reaper, or stripper, which
removes and thrashes the heads in one operation. This machine, invented
by Mr. Ridley, a South Australian, has proved a perfect godsend to the
colony. At the most it requires only two persons to attend to it, and is
frequently worked, owing to the dearth of labour, by one man, who drives
the horses and steers the machine himself. One of these machines will reap
and thresh from eight to ten acres of crop per day, after which the grain has
merely to be passed once or twice through the winnower to be ready for
market. Although the average yield per acre is not so high as in some other
countries, the quality of South Australian wheat, probably owing to the
climate, is superior to any other. This is demonstrated, not only by the
prizes obtained at International Exhibitions, but by the fact that Victoria
and New Zealand and other colonies, although producing more than
enough for their home consumption, annually import South Australian wheat
to mix with their own in the manufacture of flour. The skin is much
thinner, and the quality of the flour superior to that of other wheat. It is,
moreover, very greatly to the advantage of this colony as a competitor with
other breadstufis-producing countries that the cost of preparing the soil for
ploughing is, generally speaking, insignificant, and that the conformation of
the coast is such that produce has not, as a rule, to be taken very far in order


j._ +v. e seaboard Of course, as settlement expands the distance which
havecarried will increase, but the bulk of the lands now
cultivated are near to ports. Moreover, the wise course is being adopted of
pushing railways out in all directions, thus facilitating greatly the conveyance
of produce, and securing for the farmer a better price for his wheat. Owing
to the circumstances we have thus pointed out, South Australian farming
stands on an excellent footing, and agriculturists can thrive here on an
average per acre that would be looked upon elsewhere as a starvation yield.
This colony is not only the granary of Australia, but she exports considerable
quantities Y of breadstuff* to the Mauritius, Cape, Great Britain, and other
countries.
OLIVE, HOP, AND TOBACCO CULTURE, &c.
The olive thrives luxuriantly in South Australian soil. Many of the best
varieties were introduced soon after the colony was established, and for years
small quantities of oil of very excellent quality have been made. It is only
during'the last three or four years, however, that systematic attempts at its
mnrmf mture have been made. These attempts are owing largely to the
Xoolcy of the interest by Mr. Samuel Davenport. There are now several
persona engaged in the business, and some thousands B«lkns f p
will be made during the present season. The Sheriff (Mr. W. K. hootn y|
has taken especial interest in the industry, and the Park Lands near the Gaol
are covered whh olive-trees which yield good crops. Ine oil when made
commands a ready sale at 10s. per gallon, being equal to the best imported.
Severn"attempt have been ...ado to establish senen tore as a colonial
industry but hitherto with no very substantial results. Some of the
roelns produced here, which were sent to Marseilles, have been pronounced
by the fnrm of silk merchants to whom they were consigned to be equal to
any ever wound by them.” The climate of South Australia appeals to be
admirably suited to the silkworm, while the mulberry trees required fo
tts food grow rapidly and luxuriantly. The colony has also been proved
experimentally to be well adapted for the growth of many ot J er P l^' lcts -

WINE-GROWING
has, from the early days of the colony been pr,,per£
for which our soil and climate are particularly suitable, and althougn ongi


nally carried on with all the drawbacks of inexperience and conseqnont risk
of failures, there is abundant evidence that wine of the finest quality can be
produced in South Australia. The rich chocolate loam and the ferru°inous
clays of our hillsides and plains are admirably adapted for the production of
wine grapes of excellence. Indeed it is marvellous over what a stretch of
territory in the province the vine flourishes. Nearly all the best kinds of
grapes from France, Spain, and elsewhere have been introduced, and our
vignerons have during the last few years both discovered those best suited
for our climate and learned the proper way of treating them so as to bring
them to perfection. The wines produced vary from those of the lightest and
most delicate character to the full-bodied and generous wines such as are
produced in Spain and Portugal. The extent of land planted with vines in
1878 was 4,207 acres, and the produce of wine in 1877-8 was 453,303 gallons.
These figures exhibit a satisfactory increase in the returns for the previous
twelve months. The greater pare of the wine grown here is consumed in the
colony, where a taste for the good and pure article is gradually and steadily
growing. A moderate trade has been established with the neighbouring
colonies and other parts of the world, one or two growers shipping their
produce regularly to England, where a remunerative market is obtained for
them. Our wines have also secured medals, prizes, and honourable mentions
at all the International Exhibitions. At the Sydney Exhibition the pro-
portion of prizes obtained was enormous. The value of the wine exported
during 18/ 9 was £16,019. Spirit manufacture is also carried on to a con-
siderable extent.
HORTICULTURAL.
The varied climate of the colony is remarkably favourable to the cultiva-
tion of fruit. In good seasons many kinds grow in such abundance, and the
price is so low, that it does not pay to bring the produce to market, and it is
consequently left to rot where it falls. The earliest of the spring fruits is the
loquat, which ripens before the end of September. Cherries and strawberries
follow in October and November, and then gooseberries, currants, and
raspberries make their appearance. At Christmas time the first of the apricots
and figs are ready for eating, and soon after peaches, plums, and grapes in
abundance are ready not only for home consumption but export, considerable
quantities being sent to the other colonies. Apples, pears, melons, and a
variety of other fruits carry the supply on till the orange season, which begins
about June and lasts until November. In former years almost our entire
stock of oranges was obtained from Sydney; but now, although the trees
require artificial watering, they are very prolific, and we are able at particular
periods to supply some of our intercolonial neighbours. The Sultana,
Muscatel, and other vines are largely grown in the vineyards which are
established all over the country. The produce from them is made into
raisins, and the quality is pronounced by good judges to be excellent.
During the summer season an immense quantity of jam is made, much of
which is exported.
PASTORAL SETTLEMENT.
The pastoral lessees, more commonly called squatters, have been from the
earliest days the pioneers of settlement. The enterprising squatters, who are
now amongst our wealthiest colonists, have gone out into the distant bush,
with one or two men, a year’s stock of rations, a few horses for riding, and a
few thousand, or perhaps only a few hundred, sheep, and, selecting
some spot where water was obtainable, they have had so many square
miles roughly surveyed or delineated for them, thus constituting what are


known in the colonies as their runs. Here they have made their abode, far
removed from the confines of civilization, not seldom enduring severe
physical privations, besides being deprived of intercourse with refined
society. Generally speaking, in the course of years these men have reaped
the reward of their enterprise and self-denial by finding themselves in a
position of independence, if not of wealth. Occasionally, however, they
have met with a very different experience. The greatest difficulty against
which outside settlers have to contend is the scarcity of water, and this draw-
back is especially felt in the Far North, where there are no rivers, where the
watercourses are for the most part mere winter torrents, and where the
underground supplies are not only precarious but often so salt as to be unfit
for consumption. In good ordinary seasons the rainfall furnishes a reason-
able store of water, but there are times of drought when the country
becomes uninhabitable. Sheep die by the thousand, and the unfortunate
proprietors are put to the greatest shifts to preserve alive a sufficient pro-
portion of their flocks to resume the struggle for a competency. As may be
supposed, the difficulties of occupation increase according to the distance of
the runs from the settled districts ; and inasmuch as the pressure of agricul-
turists, to whom the land has to be given up when they require it, and the
multiplication of applicants for country are driving the squatters further and
further out, it will be seen that the spice of adventure connected with pas-
toral occupation is being well maintained. Of late years the plan most in
vogue has been for young men to associate themselves with wealthy colonists,
and push out into the interior, trusting to the results of their enterprise for
a return for their labour. The advantage of such an arrangement is that
persons with little capital but plenty of spirit and determination are enabled
to obtain a footing as squatters which they could not have secured as the
result of their own unaided efforts. Capital is required to dig the wells, to
construct dams or reservoirs, and to tide over times of drought, when
the income from stock is reduced to vanishing point. To these
hardy pioneers necessity has been the mother of invention, and the
contrivances that have been introduced to facilitate the work of pro-
viding and storing water and distributing it among the flocks and
herds are as varied as they are ingenious. Formerly when no per-
manent surface water could be had dependence was chiefly placed upon
wells, and fortunes have been sunk in the tantalizing work of procuring
supplies by this expensive and precarious process. More recently the plan of
storing water in dams and reservoirs has come into general use, and
thousands of pounds are often spent upon one waterhole. Four or
five years ago one energetic squatter (Mr. Peter Waite) —a partner
of Sir Thomas Elder, whose liberality towards the work of exploration has
already been alluded to—devoted himself to the perfecting of a combined
steam-plough and scoop for excavating reservoirs. His labours have
been crowned with complete success, and the echoes of the far-distant bush
are now stirred by the whistle of the steam-engines engaged in the task of
making artificial lakes, capable of holding scores of millions of gallons—a
sufficient supply, in fact, to make the proprietors, if not independent of the
seasons, at all events able to tide over a two years’ drought. Even where
these appliances are not resorted to, dams have been or are being formed
large enough to store water for many months. Quite recently the plan of
boring for water has come into vogue, and in some cases with most satisfactory
results. The Government have imported a most effective boring apparatus,
with which experiments are now being made upon the plains to the north-
west of Adelaide.
As in other places, there has always been in South Australia lessor more


-of antagonism between the public at large and the squatters. The latter
have been accused—andoften with good reason—of striving to keep possession
of the people’s grass upon terms absurdly favourable to themselves. There
were times when the pastoral tenants, by absolute misrepresentation, and by
dint of the influence of their wealth and position in the country, kept back
the tide of agricultural settlement. Their conduct in this respect reacted
fatally upon themselves in stirring up against them popular animosities which
developed into the demands for higher payments from them than the justice
of the case warranted. However, a modus vivendi seems at last to have been
established between the two sections of the community. The squatter has
been driven from the good farming lands within an easy distance of Adelaide
and of the seaooast, and even jealousy and envy cannot find argument against
allowing him to hold at a moderate rate territory in the remote North,
One great source of satisfaction to the stockholder is that the climate of
the Far North is singularly favourable to sheep, such diseases as scab, fluke,
and footrot being unknown. Moreover, it is only fair to the colony to
repeat, that while numbers do fail to make anything out of squatting,
and even lose their all in the attempt to make money, the majority
are well recompensed for their toils, privations, and risks. The increase
in good seasons, especially in sheep, is so great, and the clip of wool so
satisfactory, that the returns are most gratifying. Legislation, too, of late
years has been of a character to encourage pastoral settlement. Absolute
fixity of tenure is not guaranteed, leases, according to the situation of the
runs, being resumable in some cases upon twelve months’, in others upon
three years’ notice. Where resumption takes place an allowance is made
for permanent improvements, such as wells, dams, reservoirs, and fencing,
and in certain cases for buildings of a substantial character. In the more
remote interior, to which the three years’ notice applies, the lessee is also
entitled, upon resumption, to compensation for the loss sustained through
his having been deprived of the opportunity of obtaining a reasonable
return for his expenditure. To prevent persons monopolizing immense
tracts of country, and turning it to no account, provision is made that runs
taken up on lease shall be stocked within three years to the extent of ten
head of sheep and three head of great cattle per square mile. In the case
of the most distant territory the duration of the lease is fourteen years, with
a right of renewal for a like period, and the terms of occupation are as fol-
lows:—For the first fourteen years an annual rent of 2s. 6d. per square
mile, with an assessment at the rate of Id. a head upon sheep, and 6d. upon
great cattle ; and for the second fourteen years a rental of 55., and an assess-
ment of 2d. and Is. per head respectively. For the nearer runs there is no
right of renewal, the rent is not less than 2s. 6d. per square mile, and the
assessment is 2d. a head for sheep, and Is. a head for great cattle, for all
stock in excess of the minimum of fifteen sheep per square mile. There
are many other conditions and qualifications to which it is not necessary to
allude, but it may be mentioned that special encouragement is given in the
way of remission of rent to those who fence in their runs. This provision
has led to a great revolution in the mode of managing sheep-runs. Formerly
all flocks were shepherded, now in the great majority of instances they are
paddocked, and it is found that the latter course conduces greatly to the in-
crease of the carrying capabilities of the country.
Notwithstanding the enormous areas that have been withdrawn from
pastoral occupancy of late years, there are now held under lease from the
Crown for stock-raising purposes no less than 177,000 square miles, besides
23,000 square miles held under preferential-right claims. During the past
twelvemonth the area taken up upon lease amounted to 6,700 square miles,


and under preferential-right claims to 11,000 square miles, much of the
last-mentioned area being in the very remote interior. There are, however,
still some 155,000 square miles in South Australia proper altogether un-
utilized. These figures brought up to the latest stage have been supplied to
us by Mr. G. W. Goyder, who for many years has discharged the onerous and
varied duties of Surveyor-General with distinguished ability. The develop-
ment of stockbreeding in South Australia has not been so great as in some
of the other colonies, but the latest official returns issued show that there are
in the province 121,553 horses. 251,802 horned cattle, 0,377,812 sheep,
13,858 goats, and 103,422 pigs. Ten years ago the numbers were-Horses,
73 828 ; cattle, 119,697 ; sheep, 4,436,955 ; goats, 13,977 ; and pigs,
so that in every department of stock-breeding there has been an enormous
increase during the decade. The production of wool has advanced during
the same period from 27,022,671 lb. to 56,710,851 lb., or more than 100 per
cent. At the same time the value of all wool either used in or exported from
the colony, including the produce coming down the Murray from New
South Wales, has increased from .£1,127,568 to £2,41i,097. The
favourite kind of sheep here is the Merino, which has proved itself
to be admirably suited to the climate of South Australia, but
the longwools thrive in some parts of the colony. In cattle the great
maiority are of a mixed breed, but several of our wealthy breeders are
laving themselves out for the establishment of high-class herds, and pedigree
stock, both of the Shorthorn and Hereford _ breeds is being introduced,
many splendid animals having been purchased in England at great cost. At
present pleuro-pneumonia is proving rather destructive among South Austra-
lian herds, and the question of excluding cattle from the adjacent colonies, and
making inoculation compulsory, is earnestly discussed. There are one or two
flocks of Angora goats in the colony, but no great progress has been made in
the rearing of this class of animal. In the opening-up of the Far North the
camel is being found extremely useful, its services being of especial value m
connection with the work of exploration. In the breeding of horses South
Australia does not, perhaps, stand in the forefront of the colonies, but that is
not owing to any climatic or physical reasons. There are a few gentlemen
who are applying themselves to this industry, and among the names of those
who are possessors of pedigree stock of first-class quality may be named Mr.
Gerrard, the owner of Talk-o’-the-Hill, Tregeagle, and other noted thorough-
breds ; and Sir Thomas Elder, the proprietor of the famous Gang Forward.
Many of the horses reared in South Australia have distinguished themselves
upon the turf both here and in other parts of Australia. As a matter of fact,
horse-racing has not hitherto taken so high a position here as in Victoria and
New South Wales; but South Australians inherit from their ancestors the
love of this sport, and of late more systematic attention has been given to
affairs of the turf. There are several meetings during the year, including
Hunt Club races, and recently an enterprising lover of the sport has instituted
Newmarket races, which are held every few weeks.
THE BOTANIC GARDEN.
The Botanic Garden is the pride of Adelaide, and justly so. With
a site far inferior in natural advantages to the sites of the public gardens of
Melbourne, Sydney, and Hobart Town, it has yet been admittedly rendered
one of the most if not the most beautiful place of the kind in any of the
Australian Colonies. This distinction is chiefly due to its having been for
many years under the superintendence of the present talented Director, Dr,
Richard Schomburgk, who, besides being one of the most learned botanists of
the day, possesses special stall in ornamental gardening, and, aided by the


liberality of the Legislature, is ever extending not only the attractions of the-
grounds as a popular resort, but also the usefulness of the institution as a
means of scientific, agricultural, and horticultural education. The Garden
proper, which immediately joins the eastern corner of the city, consists of
forty-five acres of land, and the several portions of it are laid out with all the
skill and diversity which an elegant and cultivated taste can devise. Some
portions are planted so as to present as much as possible the appearance of
natural landscapes, while others are arranged with the elaboration which is
associated with the French and Italian styles of gardening. In one place a
grand avenue of pines affords shelter from the sun and relief to the eye on
the hottest day ; and in another stands a rosary, where a surprising array of
different species of the queen of flowers meets the view ; here are beds which
form masses of colour of one kind of bloom, and there stretch ribbon borders,
exhibiting fine lines of rainbow hues. A creek, whose banks are skirted by
weeping-willows, runs through the Garden, and winding about amid rare,,
graceful, and curious shrubs and trees —the product of all quarters of the
globe—innumerable walks pass between lawns which are evergreen, flower-
beds, conservatories, ferneries, and fountains. A few pieces of statuary are
scattered about the grounds, and under trees in all directions comfortable
seats are to be found. A large hothouse has been erected for the reception of
the grand water lily—the Victoria Regia—which annually unfolds its gigantic
leaves and delicate flowers, while a beautiful collection of orchids is also here
accommodated. A very handsome palmhouse of iron and glass is the chief
ornament of the Garden. It has a length of 100 feet by a width of 35 feet,
and a rotunda 40 feet high. Standing on a terrace raised six feet above the
natural surface of the ground, approached by two flights of steps, flanked
with statues, and surrounded by a grass margin adorned with quaintly laid-
out flowerbeds, it presents an artistic and imposing appearance. The build-
ing was erected at a cost of about ,£3,000, and contains a fine variety of
palms and other rare plants. Here are also several aviaries filled with
colonial and other birds of brilliant plumage ; and a large aviary has recently
been constructed for the Acclimatization Society, which is the abode
of some English songsters. The collection of birds at present in the Garden
numbers 435. There is also a collection of native and foreign quadrupeds
and reptiles, which includes 144 specimens. A small museum has for some
time been in existence, but a much larger one, 104 feet by is now in
course of erection, and will shortly be finished. In addition to the sum of
£I,OOO, which was first voted for this building, an additional grant of £1,500'
has been made. It will receive amongst other things the extensive herbarium
that Dr. Schomburgk has been for years arranging. There are now 10,350'
rare plants and flowers in the Garden, in addition to the ordinary varieties.
Adj lining the Garden is an area of eighty-four acres, which has more recently
been set aside as a park. It is planted with many thousands of trees, and
laid-out in walks, avenues, and carriage drives, and it is intended when the
last-mentioned are completed that the place shall form the Hyde Park of
Adelaide. An experimental garden is maintained, wherein grasses and other
fodder-plants, &c., which it is considered would be useful to be cultivated in
the colony are grown, and Dr. Schomburgk is always ready to supply plants
and seeds to any persons who wish to try and acclimatize on their own
account. From the Garden, trees are also furnished to the Government,
to Corporations, District Councils, the Forest Board, and cemeteries, and to
private persons in exchange for others. The Director in his annual report,
besides giving an account of the progress of the Garden, adds a vast amount
of information on subjects of agricultural, horticultural, and arboricultural
interest. The amount voted for the maintenance of the Garden and Park


last year was .£5,385, exclusive of the Director’s salary. The Garden is open
on weekdays from sunrise to sunset, and on Sunday afternoons, when there
is usually a very large crowd of visitors. The total number of visitors to the
Gardens during the past year is estimated at over 280,000 persons.
ROYAL AGRICULTURAL SOCIETY.
The Royal Agricultural and Horticultural Society, which is the chief of
several Agricultural Societies in existence in the colony, was established in
1848. For a long time its influence on colonial affairs was limited and its
sphere of usefulness contracted ; but for some years, dating, it may be said,
from the first visit of the Duke of Edinburgh to South Australia, in 1867,
when unusual efforts were put forward to secure a fine Exhibition, its
progress, under a much more vigorous system of management, has been
rapid. Originally confining its operations to the offering of prizes for those
classes of objects which naturally come under the cognizance of an Associa-
tion of the kind, it has gradually extended its aims and taken under its
auspices the pastoral, viticultural, and, in conjunction with the Chamber of
Manufactures, the manufacturing interests, besides devoting attention to the
consideration of subjects appertaining to agriculture, such as the cause and
cure of diseases in wheat. The Society holds periodical Exhibitions
of sheep and cattle, colonial produce, and manufactures. The Exhibi-
tion Building, which is situated on the North Park Lands adjoining the
Botanic Gardens, is 100 feet in length by 90 feet in breadth, and surrounded
on three sides by a spacious verandah. It stands in the midst of a large
enclosure, in which are pens and boxes for sheep, horses, and cattle, and a
circle for the showing of horses in action. All this accommodation, both of
building and grounds, already proves inadequate to the requirements of the
Society, and a movement is on foot to obtain another and more extensive
site. The affairs of the Society are managed by a President (at present Mr.
R. D. Ross), four Vice-Presidents (of whom Mr. S, Davenport, who
represented South Australia at the Philadelphia and Sydney Exhibitions, is
one), and a committee of about fifty members, controlling the following
departments :—Agriculture, pastoral and wool, horticulture and floriculture,
wine, manufactures and miscellaneous, finance and library. Mr. C. J. Coates
is the Secretary. During the year ending March 31, 1880, three Shows took
place—one in September, 1879, for live stock, dogs, poultry, birds, and
game ; the second, in January, 1880, for wine ; and the third, in February,
for agricultural produce, wool, implements, horticulture, floriculture, and
industries and manufactures. The Society also held a trial of reapers,
mowers, and winnowers. A trial of wheat-harvesters was also held for a
bonus of £4,000, but as none of the machines exhibited complied with the
requirements this bonus was not awarded. The Judges, however, awarded
prizes of small amounts to those machines they considered worthy. Grants-
in-aid were made to one country ploughing match, and the total amount
awarded in prizes during the year was £1,020 15s. The grant-in-aid paid
by the Government for the year was £I,OOO, and the total receipts amounted
to about £3,000. The sum of £I,OOO, which was promised by the Govern-
ment for improving the grounds, has been received. The Association have
had a pair of dies for prize medals engraved at a cost of £2lO. The Society
suggested to the Government that, with the object of advancing the agricul-
tural interests of the colony, a map of the colony divided into agricultural
sections on a climatic basis should be prepared, and that there should be
established in Adelaide an ample chemical laboratory, well furnished with
appliances for the analysis of soils, manures, waters, &c., and appointed to
the charge of the most able agricultural chemist procurable. Further,


that at least three Inspectors of Agriculture should be appointed, the
common qualification of whom should be the possession of sufficient
knowledge of vegetable physiology, composition of soils, and organic
chemistry and rural mechanics as would qualify them to give instruction on
those subjects by lectures in various parts of the colony, they to send in
periodical reports and recommendations to the Government of all that
affected agriculture. A definite reply has not yet been sent to these
suggestions. The subject of red rust in wheat and how to mitigate its
disastrous effects is now receiving the attention of the Association, and a
large amount of valuable information has been collected. Tbe custom of
reading papers monthly on agricultural or pastoral subjects was begun at
the February meeting of the General Committee, when the President (Mr.
Ross) delivered the inaugural lecture on the “ Prospects of Agriculture in
South Australia.” Mr. 0. Sabine, J.P., has since read a paper on the
tl Pastoral Interests of the Colony.” The Society now numbers about 400
subscribers. Last year a resolution was passed in the House of Assembly to
the effect that “ it is desirable to establish a school of agriculture, in order to
encourage a better mode of farming. ” The best means of carrying out this
resolution is now under the consideration of the Government.
IMMIGRATION AND LABOUR.
We have already explained that one of the fundamental principles of the
establishment of the colony was that the money derived from the sale of land
should be devoted to the introduction of labour. This system was carried
into effect to a limited extent ; but in the course of years, when the proceeds
of land became large and the requirements of the settlers in the way of roads,
bridges, public buildings, and so forth, correspondingly great, it was thought
well to divert a portion of the Land Fund to the execution of public works.
By-and-by, as the labouring population increased, the prejudice against spend-
ing public money in bringing out immigrants grew apace, and for many years
there was an entire cessation of immigration. Money set apart year by year
for this service accumulated to such an extent that at length eager eyes
were directed to it by needy Treasurers, and although at first the form of
borrowing the money was gone through, in the end the bonds were destroyed,
and the process of absorption was made complete. Five or six years ago the
demand for labour so vastly exceeded the supply that the advocates for
bringing out population at the public cost bore down all opposition, and a
considerable amount, on one occasion £lOO,OOO, has since been annually appro-
priated for and spent upon immigration. By this means thousands of persons
have been introduced from Great Britain and Germany, to the great mutual
advantage of the community and of the immigrants themselves. Latterly,
owing to the depression in copper and to a succession of indifferent wheat
harvests, the supply of labour has become rather larger than could be con-
veniently absorbed, and the old demand for the discontinuance of immigration
has made itself felt. A sum of £25,000 only was voted last year, and free
immigration is now temporarily stopped. It is more than probable, however,
that it will become necessary to renew it before very long, as the prosperity
of a young Colony like this is greatly enhanced by a well-regulated system of
immigration. The control of immigration affairs rests with the Commissioner
of Crown Lands and Immigration in Adelaide, and their management in
London is entrusted bo the Agent-General for the colony, Sir Arthur Blyth.
While emigrants were being sent out at the rate of several hundreds a month
there were two travelling Inspectors at work—Mr. Henry Taylor, whose


duties were confined to England, and Dr. Robertson, who was employed in
Scotland. Special representation of this sort in Ireland has never been
necessary, as it has always been easy to obtain a contingent of eligible Irish
emigrants. Latterly the services of the gentlemen named have not been
required, as operations are now confined, except under the Land-Order
Warrant system, to bringing out the relations and friends of persons in the
colony.
NOMINATION OF FRIENDS AND THE LAND-ORDER
WARRANT SYSTEM.
In the system of immigration now in force provision is made for
enabling colonists to nominate their friends for free and assisted passages.
These friends have to undergo examination as to their suitability for
colonists before they are sent out, as every care is taken that none but
thoroughly strong and healthy persons are introduced at the Government
expense, but the obvious advantage of the plan is that such of the nominees
as are declared eligible have on their arrival in the colony some one to take
an interest in them. The system has become exceedingly popular, and there
are still a considerable number of nomination certificates outstanding, the
free passage nominees being obliged to wait until the state of the labour
market in the Colony will render it expedient that further importations of
man-power should take place. What is known as the “ Assisted Passage
system is still, however, in operation, and residents in the Colony, and
persons now arriving or to arrive, who decide to settle here can obtain, on
application at the Crown Lands and Immigration office in Adelaide assisted
passages for their relations and friends, if eligible, by contributing, a small
proportion of the passage money. Persons nominated under these regulations
have a prior right to passages and are accordingly afforded opportunities
of joining their friends in the Colony before those nominated for free
passages. A statement of the classes that are eligible for assisted passages,
and Sf the amounts to be contributed, will be found on page 4 of this
A feature in our immigration laws deserving of special notice is the Land-
Order Warrant system. The nominations just referred to are intended tor
persons of the industrial classes, while the Land-Orders are offered as an
inducement to persons of all grades who, having a little capital, desire to make
a new home for themselves and their families, the order is issued with a view
to enabling such persons to recoup themselves, in part at least,rthe cost of
their passages out. The course to be adopted to secure these orders is t .
Any person having decided to proceed to South Austraha and settL l e
should intimate such intention to the Emigration Agent
whose office is 8, Victoria Chambers Westminster S.W London. The
Emigration Agent will then require him to furnish certificates, on a to ti
whidi will be supplied for the purpose, to the effect that he has paid his
passage-money in a ship that is to sail direct to South Australia he
has not previously resided in any of these colonies, also a certificate a
health of himself and family. He should then call at the office of the
Emigration Agent (as above) with these certificates for examination and
approval, when, if approved, a Land-Order Warrant wdl be issued to him
after which he can proceed on his voyage. Care should be taken that all
these requirements are strictly complied with, as it is absolutely necessaiy to
obtain the Warrant before sailing, otherwise there is no claim whatever for a,
Land-Order. On arrival in the Colony the holder of the Warrant should call


at the Crown Lands and Immigration Office, Adelaide, when his Warrant will
be exchanged for a land-order. The value of the land-order is £2O for each
adult, and £lO for each child between the ages of one and twelve years.
If the recipient of the order decides to take up land he should call at the
Government Land Office, Adelaide, where all information he may desire
upon the subject will be given. When he has resolved upon a block of land,
he may tender the order in part payment for same, and in this way he will
secure (without the sacrifice of any of the capital he may have brought with
him) the right to what may, by his own industry, become in the course of a
few years a valuable property. Thus, a family consisting, say, of a father
mother, and five children over the age of one year, would be able to claim
orders worth at the lowest computation £9O. This amount would be sufficient
to meet the first payment of interest upon 900 acres of land if taken up at £1
per acre, or upon rather more than 640 acres if taken up at 275. or 28s. an
acre, the average rate which land sold upon credit has realized of late. This
in many parts of the colony would be a holding quite large enough to give
profitable employment to a family of seven.
To enable the new comer to set to work with a reasonable prospect of
success, he should have money enough to purchase four or five horses, a
couple of ploughs, a pair or two of. harrows, and a few other articles’of
husbandry. Be should also be able to spend a few pounds in providing
a small residence for himself and his family, and to have enough to keep
him and those dependent on him during the months spent in putting in
the crop and obtaining a harvest. As we have before explained, it is only
here and there that any large amount has to be devoted to clearing the lands,
and supposing the selection is taken up not later than March there is every
likelihood of the selector being able to obtain a crop the same year. The
system of farming hereis so simple that the most inexperienced hand would
have no difficulty in making a start. The cost of ploughing, sowing, and
harvesting is comparatively small. There is no need to buy a reaping
machine the first year, as it is easy to obtain the loan of one, but it is no
doubt the part of wisdom for the farmer to provide himself with all those
labour-saving appliances as soon as possible.
With a capital of two or three hundred pounds a selector might with safety
start farming in South Australia. Indeed, there are innumerable instances in
which a beginning has been made upon a much smaller amount. The second
instalment of interest—also 10 per cent.—falls due in three years, and of
course it is necessary for the farmer to observe the conditions as to improve-
ments and cultivation referred to under the head of “ Agriculture,” page 26.
It must be evident, however, that the Land-Order Warrant system affords to
persons in the mother country, who, having a little money, are anxious to
obtain a home for themselves in the colonies, a ready means of econo-
mizing their funds and getting a start in life as tillers of the soil or otherwise
in South Australia. This colony is so admirably adapted to agricultural
pursuits, and particularly to wheat-growing, that it offers peculiar inducements
to intending settlers. Those persons who have obtained Land Orders but
who do not propose to take up land, can transfer the orders after a residence
of two years in the colony. They will have no difficulty in procuring almost
the full nominal value for them.
MINING.
The mineral resources of South Australia are vast and rich. Gold,
silver, copper, iron, and lead exist in many parts of the colony, and have
materially promoted its prosperity. The first mineral discovery was made


shortly after the site of the City of Adelaide had “been laid out, when a lode
of silver-lead was found within four miles of the city, on the side of a hill at
Glen Osmond. The find was not a valuable one. Years have passed since
the explorers of this deposit discontinued their efforts, and it is only worthy
of record as the first indication of the mineral wealth which has done so
much towards the development of South Australia. Other discoveries of
silver-lead have since been made, but none have proved of a permanently
remunerative character. The ores have yielded as much as from oo to 75 per
cent, of lead, and from 55 to 65 oz. of silver to the ton, but they have not
been found profitable to smelt, and the industry has been abandoned for
many years. There is little doubt that many other such deposits exist m
the hills which surround Adelaide, and in other parts of the col^ n y*
Recently a silver-lead vein has been struck at Kangaroo Island, which
is reported to be rich. Several gold-fields have also been discovered and
worked, but although gold is to be found in nearly every part of South Aus-
tralia, none of the deposits of the precious metals have so far proved of great
extent. The bed of the River Torrens has yielded a small quantity, but
none of the finds have proved of an enduring character. The Echunga gold-
fields which were discovered in 1852, were the only ones of any value which
had been worked up to that time, but they only gave employment to a com-
paratively small number of diggers. The same may be said of the Jupiter
Creek Diggings in the same locality. The Barossa gold-fields, distant about
thirty-five miles from Adelaide in a north-easterly direction were the next
discovered ; but these did not prove very rich as compared with the deposits
in the sister colonies. Alluvial gold-digging was carried on for years at
Barossa, and something has been done there in the way of mining. About
three years ago, however, operations at the Lady Alice Mine, which had been
profitably worked for some years and had yielded very rich quartz, were dis-
continued, capital not being forthcoming for carrying on deep-sinking. Gold
has also been found in the Waukannga District, in the North, where for
some years several reefs were worked with fairly satisfactory results. An
effort is now being made to obtain money for reviving operations in the
district, and the prospects of success are promising. . ,
The colony is rich in iron ores. It has been stated that there is scarcely
an acre of ground which does not contain a slight proportion of this valuable
metal. Some very large veins of iron ore —several as much as 40 feet in
width—have been discovered. The ores are entirely free from arsenic or
sulphur, and yield excellent iron. Unfortunately the enterprise of smelting
has P not been very vigorously prosecuted Various causes have contributed
to this. In the first place there are no local coal supplies, for although
has often been rumoured that coal exists in the colony no satisfactory traces
of it have yet come to light. The Government have not given up all hope
in the matter, and are now offering a bonus of £4,000 for the discovery o a
payable coal-field. It is true that wood abounds in the colony, whic
least as well suited as coal for the smelting of iron, but no systematic attempt
to smelt the ores with wood has been made. One or two experiments have
been tried, and a few tons of pig-iron have been turned out, but the f u™aces
were spoiled through the want of skill on the part of the workmen, and the
undertaking was discontinued. These deposits, however, are too valuable
always to remain neglected, and there is doubt that in course of time
they will be worked to the advancement of the commerce of the colony.
There are other mineral productions found in South Australia, viz , silver,
cinnabar, bismuth, mercury, nickel, ochre, platinum, salt,,
tellurium, cobalt, antimony, arsenic, lignite, magnesia, marble, strontium,
asbestos, manganese, baryta, dolomite, fireclay, fluorspar, fullers earth,


gypsum, kaolin clay, sulphur, bitumen, calcspar, soapstone, and native
sulphur. Precious stones have also been discovered in various parts, and
there seems little doubt that diamond-fields exist within thirty miles of
Adelaide, at the Echunga gold-fields. Several of these valuable stones have
been found there, and some which were forwarded to the Paris Exhibition
were most favourably reported on by a leading London diamond merchant.
The report has excited considerable attention here, and the Government
have caused the ground to be inspected by a gentleman possessed of consi-
derable experience, whose opinions confirm the general belief that diamonds
exist in payable quantities at Echunga. The difficulty that presents itself is
the cost of working the ground and the lack of skilled diamond-diggers. Two
of the diamonds already discovered have been forwarded in a rough state to
the Sydney Exhibition, as also a rich collection representative of the mineral
wealth of the colony. Other stones have been found in small quantities,
viz., the amethyst, agate, beryl, bloodstone, cornelian, cairngorm, chalcedony,
emerald, garnet, lapislazuli, onyx, opal, spinal ruby, and sapphire, sardonyx,
and topaz.
It is, however, in copper that South Australia is principally rich. In
more than one season of agricultural depresssion the copper-mining industry
has come to the rescue of the colony and tided it over its temporary troubles.
The first discovery was made in 1842 by a son of Captain Bagot/a very old
and valued colonist, at Kapunda, forty-five miles due north of Adelaide. In
the following year operations were commenced, and from the first proved to
be very profitable, although many obstacles had to be overcome. All the
ores raised had to be carted to Port Adelaide, a distance by road of nearly
sixty miles, and stores and machinery had also to be conveyed to the spot by
means of bullock-drays. In spite of these and many other difficulties the
Kapunda Mine developed into a very rich property, and has since yielded
Vast quantities of copper ore of all varieties. At present, however, it is
only being worked on a very small scale. Fifty miles to the north of
Kapunda is the celebrated Burra Burra mine, which has enjoyed world-wide
fame. This mine was discovered two years after that at Kapunda, and
during the palmy days of copper-mining paid in dividends a sum of no less
than .£782,320, having yielded copper to the value of £'4,000,000. The
English and Australian Copper Company, which has been long associated
with this mine, owns fine smelting works at Port Adelaide, and also in Kew
South Wales. Of late the yield of the Burra has diminished, and although
some four or five years ago an attempt was made to utilize the low-class ores
that had formerly been rejected, and expensive machinery was procured for
the purpose, the mine has succumbed to the blow struck at the copper trade
by the depreciation of prices, and at present exists only in name. These two
valuable discoveries were but the forerunners of still richer ones. Sixteen
years after the Burra Burra had been discovered a fortunate shepherd picked
up on a sheep-run within 100 miles of Adelaide, on Yorke’s Peninsula, a
piece of copper. Within a year a mine ricfrier than any previously known in
South Australia—the famous Wallaroo mine—was being worked, and
although for two years success seemed doubtful the proprietors were amply
rewarded at the end of that period for their enterprise. For the first five
years the average outturn was somewhat under 8,000 tons, but it increased
rapidly, and in 1869 had risen to 26,000 tons per annum, at which it
remained for over five years. The low price of copper in 1878 rendered it
necessary to reduce the output, and accordingly the proprietors desisted
from bringing ore to the surface, and contented themselves with merely
developing the mine. Ultimately they found it expedient to leave this
work off partially, but operations upon a moderate scale have lately been


resumed. In the neighbourhood of the mine is a flourishing township, which
it has called into existence, but which is not entirely dependent upon the
mining industry, as it is in close proximity to a large _ agricultural district.
Some seven miles from the property, and connected with it by tramway at
Port Wallaroo, are the smelting works established by the proprietors of the
Wallaroo Mines, which are the largest and most complete in Australia, ihe
works include no less than thirty-six furnaces and twenty-one calcining kilns,
where in former times over 200 men were constantly employed, ihe pro-
prietors also possess smelting works in New South M ales, on the Hunter
River. A fleet of vessels carry coals from Newcastle to N\ allaroo, and take
back from the last-named port to the New South Wales Smelting Works ores
from the Wallaroo Mines and others in their neighbourhood, thus diminish-
ing the cost of freight of coal materially. In the immediate neighbourhood
of the Wallaroo Mine are several others of more or less value, the most
noticeable being the Kurilla and the Devon Oonsols. The Doora was also
worked for many years with profitable results, but operations there are
n ° W In 1861 a still more valuable discovery than even the Wallaroo Mines
was made by another shepherd to the south-west of the Wallaroo Mines, and
distant some eleven miles from them. This property is situated about two
miles from the coast, and is known all over the world as the Moonta. As an
evidence of the richness of the mine, it is worthy of mention that at the
expiration of twenty months from its opening 8,000 tons of ore had been
raised, and dividends paid amounting to £64,000. The average yearly re-
turn of the mine until the depreciation of the copper market checKed the
outturn has been 18,200 tons of ore, of the average value of £197,2,0. Ihe
total quantity of ore raised since the opening up to March, 1880, has been
347,591 tons ; and there has been paid in dividends a sum of £1,024,UUU. A
great number of shafts have been sunk on this extensive property, of which
twenty-seven were worked until recently. The mine has given employment
for many years to over 1,500 persons. The Moonta continues to be worked
vigorously, and the return of ore sold is fast extinguishing the liability to the
Bank incurred during the period when the price of copper was very low. Ihe
latest reports on the condition of the property are extremely favourable and
there is little doubt that the Moonta will still yield arge profits to its share-
holders. There are several other mines in its neighbourhood, one or two ot
which have been worked very successfully. Among those are Hamley,
which has lately naid a dividend, Parramatta, the Yelta, and the North lelta.
At the Hamley and the Parramatta operations are still being carried on.
Nearly all the ore from these mines is conveyed by tramway to the smelting
works at Wallaroo for treatment. , ,
The mineral resources of the Far North, as yet scarcely touched, are
believed to be enormous. Lodes of copper ore can be traced for miles across
the country. There are a great number of mines to the north, north-
east, and east of Port Augusta, from which a quantity of ore has been
raised. The diflaculty of cartage and its immense cost, as well as the high
price of labour, has, however, checked enterprise in this part of the colony.
Sooner or later it will be opened out by railway, and the rich deposits will
no doubt eventually be worked to great advantage. Some idea of the \ aiue
of the mineral industry in South Australia in the past may be gathered from
the fact that since the first mine was discovered the total value of the copper,
copper ore, and regulus exported up to the end of 18,8 has been £16,106,944,
of other minerals exclusive of gold £294,612.


MANUFACTURES.
Although manufacturing industries have not developed to so great an
•extent among us as in some of the other colonies, the progress that is being
made in this department is steady and encouraging. A few years ago several
of the leading manufacturers in Adelaide formed themselves into an Associa-
tion, having for its object the development of industries adapted to the
climate and condition of the colony, and so far their efforts have had very
beneficial results. They have now a Chamber of their own, where novel or
interesting mechanical contrivances, inventions, or manufactured goods of
unusual merit are exhibited to the public free of charge. Some time ago the
Chamber published an approximate return of manufactures in South Australia.
Though this statement is by no means complete, only 300 persons out of 500
having returned the circulars sent out, the figures given are interesting as
showing the relative importance of several of our leading industries. They
deal with the year 1876, and they show that the aggregate wages paid to the
6,127 persons employed in the various factories during the twelve months
amounted to £586,000. Miners and smelters got by far the largest proportion
of this amount, though the mining industry was even then in a very depressed
condition. The aggregate wages paid to the 1,045 men were £139,248. The
amounts received by engineers, machinists, &c., was the next highest, and
exceeded £BB,OOO. Then come the timber merchants, builders, &c., with a
wages fund for the year of £54,000 ; brewers, distillers, wine-makers, and
cordial-makers, with £42,660 ; clothing manufacturers, with £35,856, divided
among the women and men employed by them ; boot and shoe makers, with
£35,500; tanners and fellmongers, with £22,730 ; brickmakers and potters,
£22,000 ; cabinetmakers, £16,300 ; printers, £16,200 ; iron and tin workers,
£14,000; shipbuilders,. &c., £13,000; and coachbuilders, £11,700. The
return from which these figures are taken shows that of the 6,127 persons
employed 853 were females, 600 of whom are engaged in the clothing
factories, which have now to a great extent reduced the importation of ready-
made goods. The boot factories in the city have also been developed con-
siderably of late years, and the importation of many kinds of boots has now
almost ceased. At one or two of the boot factories over 100 hands are
employed, and the proprietors have gone to considerable expense in
introducing steam-riveters and other labour-saving machinery. In the boot
and clothing factories together over 1,200 men and girls are employed.
The Government returns, based on the census of 1876, show that there are
twenty-four boot factories in the colony, employing 520 men and 155 women;
and thirteen establishments where clothing is made up, and where seventy-
five men and 458 girls are engaged. These numbers, although they do not
represent the exact totals at the present time, are still approximately correct.
Over 1,100 persons are employed in the production of agricultural implements,
engines, and machinery.
Most of the agricultural implements used in the colony are made here—
all the reapers or “strippers”—there being no less than forty-three imple-
ment yards, many of which are in the country towns, particularly to the
north of Adelaide, in which direction settlement has lately been rapidly
extending. No locomotive engines have yet been made in the colony, and
most of the stationary engines are also imported ; but the erection of these
and the necessary repairs give employment to a large number ot hands.
There were at the last census 814 workers in metals, including 291 iron,
brass, and copper founders; 276 engaged in smelting copper, 154 iron and
tin smiths, and 85 manufacturing goldsmiths and jewellers. This latter
branch of industry has lately been extended, and Adelaide-made jewellery


has secured very high commendation at the Paris Exhibition and elsewhere
beyond the limits of Australia. Indeed the showcases of two of our local
jewellers were generally spoken of as amongst the most attractive exhibits at
Paris. Carriage-building is extensively carried on in Adelaide* and all kinds
of vehicles are turned out, from the railway carriage and tramcar to the
humblest trap that runs on wheels. The carriage and wagon factories give
employment to two or three hundred men, including a large number engaged
by the Government in connection with the railway system which is in their
hands. Brickmaking has lately received a stimulus by the city drainage
works, the forts, and other undertakings being carried out by the Govern-
ment, and there are now twenty-five yards, principally at Hindmarsh, where
also are most of the sixteen limekilns to be found in the colony. The tan-
neries and fellmongers’ establishments give employment to over 500 persons,
and there are a few soap and candle factories that have been in existence many
years and have made a sound reputation for themselves.
Though English ale is a popular beverage in the colony, and wines and
spirits contribute not a little to the public revenue through the Customs, the
local brewers, winemakers, and manufacturers of spirits, cordials, and aerated
waters chiefly minister to the wants of the thirsty public, and in all they
employ some hundreds of persons. In 1876—207 were engaged by the brewers
or in malthouses, and 139 in preparing aerated waters, liqueurs, and
other mysterious fluids that are so freely used in a hot climate; but
in addition to these a large number of adults and children are engaged
in the production of colonial wine. Fruit-drying is now carried
on somewhat extensively, and the strong prejudice in favour of the imported
raisins and currants is gradually diminishing. About 120 persons are engaged
in this industry. Adelaide jams are appreciated beyond the borders of the
province, though the demand in the colony is almost as great as can be met,
despite the extension of many orchards and the erection of new factory
premises. The cultivation of the olive is becoming more popular, and there
are at present over 50,000 of these trees planted in the colony. Sericulture
has been taken up at intervals, but the high price of labour retards this
industry, which otherwise might be made a source of profit. The same cause,
added to a somewhat small capital, proved fatal to a Glass-bottle Company
recently established at Brompton. An attempt has for a few years past been
made to carry on a tweed factory at Lobethal, but after several spurts, and
in spite of a Government bonus, the task has at length been given up, and all
our woollen goods are now again imported. Two or three tobacco factories
have lately been started in Adelaide, and they and the small establishments
in the same line appear to be prospering. There are sawmills in the colony
employing, in 1876, 316 hands ; of flourmills there were in the same year no
leas a number than 113 scattered throughout the length and breadth of the
land. These gave employment to 800 hands, and had in them 376 pairs of
stones, and engines having an aggregate horsepower beyond 2,000. Since
then there have been important additions to this branch of manufacture. A
considerable portion of the flour is exported. The official returns give the
number of manufactories and works in the colony at 397 ; the amount of
power, supplied by steam, gas, or wind, as equal to that of 145 horses ; and
the number of persons employed 6,313, including 760 females.


TRADE AND COMMERCE.
IMPORTS AND EXPORTS.
The remark has been made, and is capable of proof, that no colony in the
British dominions can boast of a higher rate of individual progress than South
Australia. Our tables of imports and exports and our banking statistics
show far more convincingly than words can the marvellous strides which
have been made in the trade and commerce of the colony in the compara-
tively short interval that has elapsed since 1836. We have already referred
to the enormous expansion of agricultural and pastoral settlement, and the
figures relating to interchange afford evidence little less striking as to the vast
strides that the colony has made and is making. Our tables of exports and
imports reveal the rapid development of our commercial relations. In 1838
the value of our exports did not exceed .£5,000; in 1869 it amounted to
,£2,993,035 ; by 1876 it had advanced to £5,355,021, or £22 os. 3d. per head
of the population ; but in 1879, owing to the reduced value of produce and
not to the quantity exported, the amount fell to £4,762,727, or £lB 15s. per
head of the population. The imports, which in 1869 were £2,754,770,
reached £5,014,150 in 1879, or £l9 14s, lOd. per head of the
The total amount of the import and export trade has increased from £5,747,805
in 1869 to £11,074,632 in 1878. The figures for 1879 show a failing off, being
£9,776,877, but during the present year the united import and export trade
is likely greatly to exceed any previous year, on account not merely of the
increased production but of the advance in the value of produce.
Our chief staple exports are breadstuff's, wool, and copper, though we
now ship away a considerable quantity of wine, bran, pollard, hay, fruit,
tallow, bones, hides, wax, gum, honey, bark, &c. In 1838 little or no wheat
was grown in the colony, our supplies for the purpose of consumption coming
from Tasmania ; and up to 1842 inclusive the exports only comprised wool,
whalebone, and oil, lead, timber, slates, butter, cheese, and tallow. In 1843
breadstuff's were added, and from that date we have continued to supply
customers outside the limits of our own province. In 1843 the value of the
exports of wheat and flour amounted to £10,032, and quinquennially since
that it has been as follow :—ln 1848, £34,815 ; in 1853, £208,647 ; in 1858,
£474,612 ; in 1863 (bad harvest), £698,994; in 1868, £554,585; 1873,
£1,692,738 ; 1878 (poor harvest), £1,646,434. As regards quantity it may
be mentioned that in 1878 and 1879 the exports of wheat and flour were as
follow :
1878. . 1879.
Flour 62,282 70,519 tons
Wheat 3,113,834 3,376,917 bushels
Daring this year the exportation of breadstuff's will in all probability reach
300,000 tons. The increase in the production and export of wool has been
correspondingly rapid and striking. In 1843 wool was exported to the value
of £45,569, and taking every fifth year from that point the rate of progress
has been marked, as will be seen from the following figures 1853,
£236,020; 1858, £420,833; 1863, £715,935; 1868, £1,305,280; 1873,
£1,617,589 ; and in 1878, £183,071. In 1879, owing to the diminished
value of wool in the home market, it was £1,694,976. Copper and copper-ore
exports stand thus : —1843, £2O ; 1848, £310,387 ; 1853, £176,347 ; 1858,
£359,182; 1863,’£532,861 ; 1868, £608,423 ; 1873, £768,522 ; and in 1878,
£407,587. In 1879 the amount was £352,264, but as copper has advanced
very much in price the exports for 1880 will no doubt exceed those of the
past two years. The decline during that period has restricted production,


but it in no way implies that our mines are exhausted. Those on Yorke’s
Peninsula, for instance, are practically as rich as ever, and since the rise in
Conner there is quite a revival in the mining industry of the colony. Wine
is beginning to form an important item of export. In 1869 we shipped away
,£5 825 worth; in 1878 we exported £25,267, and in 18i9the value was
£16,019. Jam, butter, eggs, gum, fruit, &c., also swell our list of exports,
and are yearly increasing. , ,
Our imnorts, which in measure represent the payment for the produce
we have sent away, and show the extent of our business with other countries,
have augmented concurrently with our exports. In 1838 they stood at the
moderate sum of £158,582 ; in 1856 they had increased to £1,366,529 ; in
1869 thev were £2,754,770 ; in 1873 they were £3,841,101 ; and in 18,9 they
reached the large amount of £5,014,150. The total imports for the whole
term embraced within the 40 years from 1838 to 1878 amounted to no less a
sum than £74,545,940. Our chief import trade is carried on with Great
Britain, but frequent shipments of goods are received from the other colonies,
from the Baltic, Singapore, Java, China, India, Mauritius, the United States,
and Canada. We have a Chamber of Commerce, which serves as a rallying
point for the mercantile c immunity, and sees to the 'representation ot its
interests.
SHIPPING.
In 1844 70 ships from various parts of the vyorld arrived at Port
Adelaide, representing a tonnage of 9,530 tons ; in 1854 the arrivals reached
476 ships, with a tonnage of 146,666 tons ; in 1864, 617 vessels arrived, with
a tonnage of 160,095 tons ; in 1873 the figures are 799 and 265,437 respec-
tively • °and in 1878 they were 943 and 406,325. Direct steam communica-
tion has been established between Adelaide and the United Kingdom ; and
steamers with a capacity of from 2,000 to 4,000 tons, owned by the P. & O.
Companv and the Orient Steam Navigation Company, visit St. Vincents
Gulf fortnightly ; other steamers make less frequent trips. There are also
three lines of fine clipper ships, ranging from 800 to 1,700 tons register each,
which are partly owned by merchants and capitalists residing in the colony,
and which trade regularly between London and Adelaide. Steamers run
regularly between Port Adelaide and Melbourne, and there are now two
steamers which have direct communication with Sydney, and one of them
calls at Tasmania en route. In addition to these we have a large number of
barques, schooners, and other craft, which run between our own ports and
the other colonies.
THE RIVER TRADE.
What is known as the river trade forms an essential part of the com-
merce of the colony. The Murray, into which the Darling and Murrumbidgee
flow runs through and empties itself in Australia, which thus
possesses all the advantage of the down stream. This circumstance has been
of great benefit to the province, as it has enabled our merchants to maintain
business relations with the settlers of Riverina, despite the prodigious efforts
which both Victoria and New South Wales have been making to monopolize
the trade. South Australians were the first to practically recognise the
importance of the river traffic and the necessity of securing it, or as much
as possible of it, to the colony. Sir Henry Young (a former Governor) the
late Mr. Younghusband, Messrs. Acraman, Main, & Co., Captains Gadell,
Randell, Johnston, King, and others took considerable interest in the
navigation of the Murray and its upper streams, and principally through
their exertions we commanded for some years the bulk of the trade. At


that time the traffic wag very limited, but the development that has taken
place in it since then is something wonderful. In 1853 there was but one
vessel on the Murray ; in August, 1878, there were 152 steamers and barges
engaged in the trade ; now the number is about 156. Of these by far the
larger number belong to this colony, the total tonnage being, for South
Australia 8,040 tons, and for Victoria and New South Wales together 8 648
tons. The number of steamers and barges owned in South Australia is
respectively 32 and 34 ; m Victoria, 15 and 31; and in New South Wales,
24 and 16. It would thus appear that in the important essential of shipping
accommodation for the rivers South Australia stands ahead of either
of her competitors. For several years Victoria, by means of a railway
to Echuca and concessions on the freight charged for inland carriage, managed
to divert a large portion of the Darling traffic which legitimately belonged'’ to
South Australia, and it was some time before our legislators became alive to
the necessity of keeping pace with the sister colony in the competition. In
July, 1876, an Act was passed for the construction of a line of railway from
Kapunda to the North-West Bend. In March, 1877, the work was com-
menced, and in September of the following year it was completed. The line
wa ? !?:T lly on October 18, 1878, by His Excellency the Governor,
and the benefit of the railway has already been experienced in the quicker
transit of goods both to and from the river. At Victor Harbour, too im-
portant works are being erected with a view of still further aiding the
evelopment of the traffic. A breakwater is in course of construction, and
when tins is completed vessels of the largest tonnage will be able to load with
the greatest facility. The very announcement of the efforts which are being
made has directed attention to tee position which South Australia occupies
naturally with regard to the great waterway of the continent, and the
statistics of the past two or three years show that a steadily increasing traffic
is following the downflow of the stream, much to the benefit of our traders
hrora official statistics we gather that the exports via River Murray were as
follows 1869, to New South Wales, .£81,309 ;to Victoria, £216 ; 1872, to
th + r 6988 ’ 1 , 03 V to , Vlctoria > nil; 1878, to New South Wales,
iota ■ i’ . 0 * lc l° ria > nU. It should be borne in mind that from 1873 to
1876 inclusive the returns show but a small portion of our exports via the
Murray As the trade in duty-paid goods was free from any Customs restric-
tions—South Australia paying to the neighbouring colony a lump sum in
commutation of duty—no return of them could be furnished. Our imports
by way of the River Murray have been chiefly from New South Wales, but
Victoria has contributed a, little. In 1869 we received £209,953 worth of
produce from New South Wales, but nothing from Victoria ; in 1874 the
figures were £253,054 from New South Wales, and £42,390 from Victoria;
and in 18/8 £714,199 from New South Wales, and £15,095 from Victoria.
Uur imports from both colonies consist principally of wool; but in addition
to that staple we get sheep, hides, copper, tallow, and wood. In 1878 we
fM/non 0 ess than 3 C bales of wool from New South Wales, valued at
x 604,032, or one-third of our total export of wool for that year. In the same
year we got 625 bales of wool, valued at £10,275, via the Murray from
Victoria. In 1879 the quantity of river wool brought into South Australia
was over 30,000 tons. The producing power of the Riverina country is capable
ot considerable expansion, and our traders look forward to a vearly increasing
business with the settlers of that important district. '


FINANCIAL.
As must of necessity be the case with all young communities, a con-
siderable portion of the supplies flowing into the Treasury consists of the
proceeds of loans. Hence the sums received by the Government may be
ranked under two distinct heads, the General Revenue and amounts in
the English money market by the sale of South Australian bonds. Dealing
first of all with the General Revenue, it may be classed under three or four
distinct subdivisions. This can be most readily illustrated by a reference to
the figures for the year 1879. It should be noted that the financial year
closes°on June 30, but for the sake of uniformity the returns relating to
finances, as well as the other statistics, are made up for the natural year.
For 1879 the total General Revenue was .£1,662,498. Of this amount
£433 402 was derived from the sale of Crown lands. The system of disposing
of these lands, which has been in force for several years, is elsewhere fully
explained; and it will be sufficient here to state that of the sum just named
£ll4 811 was paid into the Treasury for interest on credit sales, £318,591
on account of sales for cash and first and subsequent instalments of purchase-
money of credit selections. The amount raised by taxation was £526,366, of
which £l2 935 was received on account of Probate and Succession Duties,
and the balance from Customs and Excise. Another division of the revenue
consists of the sums received for services rendered. Thus, Railways and
Tramways yielded £328,332, the Postal and Telegraph Departments produced
£124 046 the Waterworks £46,825, and Marine £12,019. Under another
division the rents of Crown lands leased to the squatters and other tenants of
the Crown brought in £72,939. The other sources of revenue consist of
rents of land set apart for educational purposes, business licences, reimburse-
ments-in-aid, and miscellaneous. The expenditure of the General Revenue
is authorized in the usual way by an Appropriation Bill, The total oxitlay
for 1879 was £1,847,256. It is understood that the Land Fund should be
appropriated to public works, immigration, and the redemption of the national
debt For public works the outlay was £327,277, for immigration £08,893,
for redemption of bonds £34,200, and for survey &cf of Crown lands
£69 802. The interest on the bonded debt absorbed £297,898, railways and
tramways, that is for working expenses and maintenance, £260,382 ; the
Postal and Telegraph services, £164,284 ; and Education, £84,-90. The
other particulars of expenditure do not call for any special remark, as they
consist of the ordinary items of outlay required for J.he maintenance of
government in a civilized community. . , ... , , q
The tariff now in force was passed in the year 1870. A short time back South
Australia could claim to be the most lighty taxed per head of any of the Aus-
tralian Colonies, though at the present time we believe this is not the case. As,
however, nearly the whole of the taxation is raised by means of Customs
duties, and the existing tariff is calculated to briag “> "P°” , th ‘’ »
slightly lower revenue than the one which it superseded, the higher rate of
taxation per head may be accepted as an indication of the growing prosperity
of the country rather than the reverse. Thus, in 1873 the population was
198 075, and the Customs revenue £362,246, or nearly £1 16s. id. per head.
In 1879 the population was about 260,000, and the Customs revenue
£513,431, or about £2 Is. Id. per head. Including Probate and Succession
Duties the total taxation per head last year was a trifle under Thus the
increase in the rate of contribution during the last six years is owing almost
entirelv to the large consumption of dutiable goods, and not to the imposition
of additional burdens. The tariff has been passed for the purpose of raising
a revenue, and not with a view to protection, but there are traces in it of the

principle of giving encouragement to native industry. A number of articles
are placed on the free list. Most articles of drapery, furniture, carriages,
drugs, earthenware, jewellery, certain kinds of leather and leather goods,
stationery and fancy .goods, and fish and meat in pickle or brine, are placed
on the 10 per cent, ad valorem list, and engines not exceeding sixty horse-
power, and agricultural implements are placed on the 5 per cent, ad valorem
list. The present list was in some respects the result of a compromise, and
there is little doubt that at the next revision the duties will be very much
simplified still further in the direction of free trade. The highest duties
have for the most part been placed on articles which can be manufactured in
the colony ; but that even these are in no sense prohibitive is proved by the
fact that the imports, and consequently the duties receivable by the Govern-
ment, have so largely increased. For a long time past the feeling has been
growing that the incidence of taxation needs to be readjusted. The necessity
for additional revenue in consequence of the growing requirements of the
colony, owing to the rapid expansion of settlement that has taken place,
furnishes a fitting opportunity for undertaking this task. The Government
proposed last year to seek the authority of Parliament for the imposition of
a small property and income tax ; and it was intended to employ the extra
sum thus raised partly as an aid to revenue and partly for the purpose of
making good any remissions or reductions in the Customs. The Bill did not
pass, but the necessity for some such system of taxation is urgent.
A word or two now as to the national debt. The money thus borrowed is
employed in carrying out large public works, such as railways and telegraphs.
Many of these will, no doubt, ultimately not only pay for maintenance,
working expenses, and interest on outlay, but will also yield a profit. At
first it is impossible they can do so. In the meantime, however, they are a
very direct advantage to the country. The remoter districts are opened and
developed, the value of property is increased, and facilities are afforded for
bringing the produce of the soil to a market or port for shipment. Within
the last six years the public debt has advanced very rapidly. On December
31, 1873, it stood at .£2,174,900 At the end of 1879 it amounted to
£9,882,900. It should be explained, hovever, that this amount included
bonds to the value of over a million and a quarter forwarded to London before
December 31, but not actually sold till after that date. At one time the
bonds issued bore interest at 6 per cent, ; subsequently the rate was reduced
to 5 per cent , and for the last six years all the debentures have been made
to bear 4 per cent, interest. The total debt on March 31, 1880, after
deducting the value of bonds redeemed, stood as follows :
In explanation of the rapid increase in the public debt during the last few
years, it should be stated that what is commonly known as the Boucaut policy
included plans for opening-up the more distant lands by the carrying out of
railways and other public works to be paid for by means of borrowed capital.
In the main the money raised has been wisely expended, and there can be no
doubt that an impetus has been given to the progress of the colony by the
spirited and comprehensive policy initiated by the present Mr. Justice
Boucaut when he was Premier in 1875. In addition to the bonds already
issued Parliament has given authority for the raising of further loans amount-
ing to £977,084. The question may naturally be asked—What is there to


set against this indebtedness ? In the first place, the amount due at the close of
1879 by credit selectors was <£4,490,245 13s. 9d. The value of the public works
of the colony is estimated at something like £8,000,000. Hence the country
can show a security of more than £12,000,000 for the £9,882,900 owing.
This, however, is only one view of the case. Within judicious limits, which
have certainly not yet been exceeded, the outlay of borrowed capital in the
directions indicated affords direct help to the development of the country, as
is shown by the growth in the revenue to which we have referred. Alto-
gether it may, without boasting, be said that in its fiscal policy, and in the
nature of the security it can offer to the British capitalist, South Australia
stands second to none of the Australian provinces.
This article would not be complete without a reference to the Banks
established in the colony and the trade done by them. We have now eight
Banks established in Adelaide, two of them being essentially local in-
stitutions, and one or another of which has branches in every township of
any importance throughout the colony. In 386 L the deposits, bearing
and not bearing interest, lodged at the several Banks, reached a total
of £743,738 ; in 1874 they were £2,237,524 ; in 1879 they were £3,010,365.
The total average assets have always shown an ample margin over the
liabilities. In 1869 the liabilities of the various Banks were £1,096,861,
and the assets £3,478,165 ; in 1874 the figures were respectively £2,714,212
and £4,736,675 ; and in 1879 £3,550,923 and £7,207,815. The Savings
Bank returns give ample evidence of the prudence and thriftiness of the
community. The institution was founded in 1847, and is managed by a
Board of Trustees appointed by the Governor. In 1848, with a population
of 38,000, the deposits amounted to £5,313 ; in 1853 the amount had in-
creased to £54,356 ; and the figures for every fifth year subsequently are as
follows :—IBSB, £63,881; 1883, £189,144 ; 1868, £312,728 ; 1873, £709,343;
and in 1878, £993,721. In June 1879 the fund had increased to the extent
of a few thousand pounds. The number of depositors has increased from 214
in 1848 to 31,394 in 1879, and the average amount at the credit of each de-
positor has augmented from £24 16s. 7d. in 1848 to £3l 16s. 2d. in 1879.
The rate of interest declared has varied from 1 per cent to 6 per cent. For
the year just closed the race was 5i per cent. The Bank has £487,715 lent no
mortgage, and £312,916 invested in Government and Corporation securities.
PUBLIC WORKS.
The public works of runy country, when fairly tested by proper standards
as regards character of design, suitability for the purposes for which in-
tended, cost, and revenue directly or indirectly derived therefrom, furnish
one of the best possible gauges by which to measure the material prosperity
of the people by whom they were carried out. Viewed from this standpoint
the colony of South Australia may proudly challenge comparison with any
other country of equal population and resources. That her public works
have in every instance realized in their financial returns the sanguine
expectations of those who were responsible for their initiation no one will
contend; but, on the other hand, their construction has undeniably con-
duced to the settlement of large tracts of country which were either previously
inaccessible, or so situated that the cost of conveying goods to the seaboard
left no margin of profit to the producer. Up to the end of December, 1879,
the sum of £7,381,727 lls. Bd. had been expended on public works
out of loans specially raised for the purpose. Of this sum £3,804,504 has
gone for railways ; £527,755 for harbour improvements; £725,860, water-


works : .£590,311, telegraphs ; £620,703, main roads ; schoolhouses,
£226,671; jetties and lighthouses, £122,660 ; and the balance for sundry
other works. Beyond this, however, millions of money taken out of the
Land Fund and out of General Revenue have been disbursed upon roads,
bridges, buildings, jetties, lighthouses, and other undertakings of a public
nature.
RAILWAYS.
In this age of steam and iron, the iron horse and the road on
which runs must take the precedence of any other means of com-
munication in a colony like ours, where the coastline, although very
extensive, bears but a small proportion to the total territory, and the
inland navigation is practically confined to the Murray. The standard gauge
of the colony for the main trunk lines starting from Adelaide is 5 ft. 3 in.—
the same as that adopted by Victoria. This gauge, including lines con-
structed and authorised, extends from Port Adelaide in the south to a point
near Terowie in the north ; also from Adelaide to Nairne in the south-east.
The extensions outside those limits have been projected and constructed
on the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge. It appears probable that extensions into
Victorian territory will have to be made on the broad gauge, and junctions
with Queensland and New South Wales on the 3 ft. 6 in. gauge, though
many reformers are of opinion that if the narrower gauge be found to
answer the purpose economy of working will necessitate the reduction of
the broader gauges to the narrower, or the adoption of a double gauge, such
as has been laid down on the Great Western Railway in England. The
income from railways for the last financial year was £312,527, and the expendi-
ture £213,688, leaving a balance to the good sufficient to pay interest at the
rate of about per cent, upon the money spent in constructing the lines.
The average cost of the South Australian lines as regards construction has
greatly diminished of late years. The first few miles of the broad gauge
averaged complete over £lO,OOO per mile across easy country. The exten-
sions on the same gauge have not exceeded £7,000, whilst the narrow-
gauge lines do not now average above £5,000 a mile complete, and some
extensions are not expected to cost more than £4,000 a mile. There are
now 614 J miles of railway open to the public, made up as follows :—Ade-
laide and Semaphore, 9jr; Dry Creek and Port, 5 ; Adelaide and Hallett,
127|; Strathalbyn and Victor Harbour, 32 ; Port Wakefield and Hoyleton,
28; Hoyleton and Blyth, 14; Port Pirie and Gladstone, 324; Gladstone
and Caltowie, ; Caltowie and Jamestown, 8 ; Port Broughton and Ba-
runga, 10 ; Kingston andNarracoorte, 53 ; Kadina, Wallaroo, andMoonta,
164 ; Kapunda and North-West Bend, 57 ; Port Wakefield and Kadina, 35;
Kadina and Barunga Gap, 26 ; Rivoli Bay and Mount Gambier, 50f;
Hamley Bridge and Balaklava, 21-|; Barunga Gap Extension, 64 ; and 70
miles of the Port Augusta and Government Gums line.
The following lines are under construction :—Port Augusta and Go-
vernment Gums, 199 (including the 70 already opened); Adelaide and Nairne,
33J miles ; and the Hallett and Terowie line, 20£ miles. The Adelaide and
Nairne Railway works were begun by the Government, but the contract for
the earthworks of the first portion of the line as far as the romantic hill
station at Crafers, a distance of about nineteen miles from the town, was
recently let to Messrs. Walker & Swan for £182,158. This portion of the
line will be opened by June or July, 1882, if no unforeseen difficulties are
encountered in the very heavy works—tunnels, viaducts, and deep cuttings—-
which have to be made. The estimated cost of this line is £672,378, being
an average of about £20.375 per mile, the earthworks and tunnels alone


amounting to nearly ,£8,500 per mile, although the first few miles till the
foot of the hills is reached run over easy country. The average gradient
ascending the range will be 1 in 51, the ruling gradient being 1 in 45.
Surveys have been undertaken for the Terowie to Pichirichi, with branch
from Yongala to Jamestown, j Moonta to Moonta Bay, ; for which
the assent of the Legislature has been obtained. A tender has been accepted
for about twenty-one miles of the Yongala line
There are at present only three lines of railway in private hands, viz., the
Adelaide and Glenelg, the Brighton and South Coast, and the Holdfast Bay
Raiiwajr, making in all about seventeen miles. They are built on the 5 ft.
3 in. gauge. The Holdfast Bay line is just completed, and is one of the
cheapest lines in the colony. This Company have running powers over the
first portion of the Adelaide and Nairne Railway.
ROADS AND BRIDGES.
The main-road system of South Australia is acknowledged to be
the moat efficient in the Australian Colonies. From the earliest days
large sums have been spent upon the construction and maintenance of
macadamized thoroughfares, and the roads through the Mount Lofty Ranges
especially are excellently made. The main arteries are constructed and
maintained at the public expense, the local roads being under the
charge of District Councils ; their expenditure upon such roads derived
from local rating is supplemented pound for pound by the Govern-
ment. There are now over 3,300 miles 35 chains of main roads in the
colony, on which in the financial year 1878-9 £85,000 was expended in
maintenance. It is proposed to spend £lOO,OOO during the current financial
year. The majority of the main roads are under the care of “ Local Boards
of Main Roads,” of which there are eight. The Central Board, which meets
in Adelaide, has 1,031 miles 40 chains of main line under its charge; the
Northern Board, 359 miles ; the Flinders Board, 129 miles; the Victoria
Board, 162 miles 48 chains ; the Albert Board, 356 miles 14 chains ; the
Peninsula Board, 295 miles ; the North Midland, 168 miles 40 chains ; and
the Midland, 372 miles. In parts to which the jurisdiction of Boards, Cor-
porations, and District Councils do not extend the Commissioner of Public
Works exercises direct control over the making and maintaining of the
roads.
BRIDGES.
The colony can boast of several fine bridges, the most notable being that
at Edwards’s Crossing over the River Murray. This is the largest bridge
in the Australasian Colonies, and cost £124,000. Its total length is
1,905 feet, and 4,125 tons of iron have been employed upon it. There
are five spans of 114 feet each over the river, and twenty-three spans
over the swampy approach on either side. The cylinders are sunk from forty
to eighty feet below high-water mark, and have a, headway of thirty feet.
The next most important bridge is the one over the river at Port Adelaide, and
known as the Jervois Bridge. This consists of four fixed spans of forty feet
each, and a central swing portion, having a clear opening of fifty feet on
either side. The central pier is composed of castiron cylinders, upon which
the bridge swings by hydraulic power on frames and The forty-feet
sidespars are carried by ordinary plate-girders resting on cylindrical piers, and
provision is made for carrying a six-inch main to convey water from Port
Adelaide to the Semaphore. The bridge is so constructed as to be adapted
to the large vehicular and foot-passenger traffic of the Port, and also carries
over it the railway traffic of the Adelaide and Port Extension on the 5 ft.


3 in. gauge. There are also several handsome bridges over the Torrens in
Adelaide ; and many substantial structures have been erected across the rivers
and creeks in country districts.
WATER SUPPLY AND DRAINAGE.
The water supply to the City, Pojrt, Semaphore, Glenelg, and imme-
diate suburbs is taken from the Rfver Torrens at a point nine miles
from Adelaide, at which point a weir is thrown across the river, and
the water led by a 42-inch main and an open channel to a reservoir at
Thorndon Park, capable of storing 138,000,000 gallons. This was the only
source of supply for many years, but the rapid growth of the city and suburbs
demanded additional storage accommodation, and a storage reservoir was
constructed at Hope Valley, which, with a depth of 30 ft. 3 in. of water, con-
tains 210,500,000 gallons ; and it is proposed by additional puddling to in-
crease the capacity to 461,500,000 gallons, or more than double the amount
stored during 1878. It is supplied from the weir through a continuation of the
channel which supplies the Thorndon Park Reservoir. The supply to the city
leaves the reservoir in an 18-inch main, which is carried into the reservoir
and rises in a water tower seventy feet in height, consisting of an external
casing of iron, lined with brick in cement. The main is carried up inside
this tower and fitted with branch pipes at various levels communicating with
the outside, and furnished with straining cages. Each branch pipe is opened
or closed, as the oase may be, by a sluice-v,alve, whidh is worked from an
internal stage. There is an external gallery running all round the tower.
The straining cages are drawn up by suitable gear to the level of this gallery
for examination, cleaning, &c. Even since the additional storage accommo-
dation afforded by the Hope Valley Reservoir has been supplied great incon-
venience has been experienced during the summer months by the intermit-
tent-supply system necessarily occasioned by the low pressure and the rapidly
growing and spreading suburbs. With a view to obviating this inconvenience
a storage reservoir or tank for the supply of the Port, of a capacity of
1,000,000 gallons, has been constructed on the Park Lands at North Adelaide.
This reservoir, which cost „£10,156, is filled at night by the main from Hope
Valley, thus affording increased pressure during the day to the high-lying por-
tions of the city and suburbs. The suburbs of Burnside and Mitcham being
at too great an elevation to be supplied from the main, reservoirs have been
furnished with independent sources of supply, that at Burnside being derived
from Second Creek, and that at Mitcham from Brownhill Creek. In both
cases the water is stored in a circular tank or reservoir of brick, that at Burn-
side having a capacity of 300,000 gallons, and that at Mitcham 275,000 gal-
lons. Apart from works of this nature appertaining to the city and suburbs
there are very large and important works of a similar nature in existence, in
course of construction, and in contemplation throughout the Colony. A
considerable sum of money has been expended in the recent construction of
a dam and reservoir at Nelshaby for the supply of the rising town of Port
Pirie, one of the principal outlets for our wheat-producing areas, and in a
large reservoir and dam constructed near Kapunda for the supply of that
town. Schemes for the supply of Mount Gambier, Port Augusta, Gawler,
Glenelg, Brighton, and the Semaphore are also receiving attention.
WATERWORKS.
The sanitary condition of the city has of late occupied much public
attention. Various systems have been advocated, surface scavenging and the
use of earth closets among the number. Deep drainage, however, is the
system most generally acknowledged the best in this particular instance.


During the recent visit to the colonies of Mr. W. Clark, 0.E., the eminent
engineer, he was engaged to report upon the subject, and he decided in favour
of deep drainage. The subject was first taken up by the Corporation, but
ultimately it was thought it would be better if the Government took the
whole work under their control, as the city system of drainage might have
at some future time to be connected with the suburban towns, and com-
plications might arise if the Government had not the control, seeing that
the waterworks are under their management. Tenders for three separate
portions of the main sewer have been let, and the work is now being pushed
on. Mr. Clarke’s estimate is about ,£222,000.
HARBOURS, JETTIES, AND LIGHTHOUSES.
A very large number of small jetties are in course of construction at
various points on the coast. These works, though not in most cases of an
ambitious character, are of incalculable service as aids in the cheap transport
of our staple products. The largest work undertaken by this department is
the breakwater at Victor Harbour, for the construction of which a contract
was let in July, 1878, at £107,457 12s lOd. It is believed that this work
will be completed by July, 1881. Quarrying on a large scale is an important
feature in the carrying out of the contract. Charges of as much as five tons
of gunpowder at a blast are employed, and on two occasions 30,000 cubic
yards of rock—some blocks weighing over 100 ton's—were blown out at one
shot. The object which this breakwater is designed to attain is the
development of the River Murray shipping trade.
For some time past the subject of suitable accommodation of the many
large vessels of from 2,000 to 4,000 tons which make regular visits to Port
Adelaide has been under consideration. The approach to the Port itself is
by a winding stream, which, though navigable for vessels of a large size, is
not made use of by the P. &O. steamers or the larger vessels of the Orient
line, which seek a safe anchorage in the roadstead outside the Port. Various
schemes have been propounded, and have attracted a large share of public
attention, but though all parties are agreed as to the desirability of further
accommodation, the greatest divergence of opinion exists among professional
men as to the best means of attaining the object in view. The four most
practicable schemes before the public are : —l. A pierre-perdue breakwatsr at
Largs Bay (near the Semaphore), for steamers to anchor inside, together with
jetty at Semaphore to accommodate lighters and tugs in all weathers;
estimated cost, £273,725. 2. A jetty at Largs Bay, giving depth of 27 feet
at low water, and starting from the end of the Semaphore Railway ; estimated
cost, £372,000. 3. Harbour at Marino about ten miles south of the Sema-
phore, and utilizing breakwater for approach to wharf. The official estimated
cost is £560,000. 4. Harbour and pier at Glenelg ; estimated cost, £975,600.
A Board of Advice, appointed to enquire into the whole subject, reported in
favour of the breakwater and jetty at Largs Bay, with certain limitations,
but the work has not yet received the sanction of Parliament.
The lighthouses are fourteen in number, and are situated at Semaphore,
Glenelg, Port Adelaide, Cape Jervis, Cape Willoughby, Carpe Borda, Port
Mac Donnell, Troubridge Shoals, Port Wakefield, Rivoli Bay, Althorpe
Island, Tipara Reef, Cape Bridgewater, and a new one now being erected at
end of the Kingston Jetty. The one at Cape Bridgewater is on the boundary
line between South Australia and Victoria, the cost being divided between
the two colonies. The Port Adelaide light is visible for fourteen miles, and
the Cape Jaffa light for twenty miles. The Tipara light is of the same order
as that at Port Adelaide. That at Althorpe Island, which is one of the most
recently erected, is a first-order dioptric light, on a tower forty feet high.


The light was first exhibited on February 14, 1879, and the lighthouse is the
best finished of any in the colony. The works were carried out under great
difficulties, having been constructed on an island which has almost perpen-
dicular sides, and rises some 300 feet above the sea level. The light will be
of great service to vessels navigating Investigator Straits. As South A ustralia
possesses a safe coastline, and a complete system of marine survey, the
shipping disasters strictly within the provincial limits have been but few.
PUBLIC EDIFICES.
The principal public buildings are situated in Adelaide and Port Adelaide.
Many of them possess considerable merit from an architectural point of view,
and all of them are constructed in a substantial manner. Increased accommo-
dation is required for Government offices, and this is being afforded by the
erection of new premises in Yictoria-square. The style is Italian, and
the cost will be about .£60,000. A new Institute is now in course of
erection on North-terrace, the contract being let for about £36,000. The
basement contains strong-rooms and suitable cellarage for the storage of
books, papers, &c. On the floors above are the reading-room, library,
news-room, lecture-room, museums, offices for Secretary, Curator, and
assistants, ladies’ reading-room, cloakroom, and the usual offices. The
University building now in course of erection will be a fine building, Gothic
in style. The existing public offices in King William-street are all Italian in
style. The external face, unlike the new offices, is of cement stucco. The
Post-Office is also of the Italian style, the frontages to King William and
Franklin streets being of freestone. There is a tower at the south-east angle
of the building, about 150 feet in height; this is furnished with a clock
which chimes the quarters. The dials are eight feet in diameter, of white
opaque glass, and are illuminated at night. On the summit of the tower
there is a lookout and flagstaff, whence the arrival and departure of the
English mails are signalled The Supreme Court, situated in Victoria-square,
is a handsome building of Italian style, and executed in freestone. The new
Houses of Parliament will be of Italian style of architecture, and are
estimated to cost when completed £120,000. The Marine Board Offices and
the Institute and Library are the chief public buildings of note at Port
Adelaide. They are built of freestone, and are, both as regards design and
the accommodation afforded, well suited to their respective requirements.
POST-OFFICES AND TELEGRAPHS.
The rapid advance of settlement in the Northern districts entails an
ever-increasing demand for postal and telegraphic facilities—a demand far
in excess of what the population of the colony, if less widely dispersed,
would require. Consequently the expenditure of the State in this direction
shows a heavy increase every year without a corresponding addition to the
revenue. The advance, however, having regard to the peculiar circumstances
of the province, is fairly proportionate to the expense incurred. The depart-
ment is under the energetic and able management of Mr. C. Todd, C.M.G.,
who was formerly one of the astronomers at the Cambridge Observatory, and
in 1855 he was appointed by Lord John Russell Superintendent of Telegraphs
and Government Astronomer for South Australia, the Imperial Government
having been asked by the authorities here to select a competent scientific
man for the purpose. He arrived in November of that year, and in 1870,
when the Post and Telegraph Offices were amalgamated, he was entrusted
with the charge of the twin department, which has now extended its
ramifications to very wide limits.


THE TRANS-AUSTRALIAN TELEGRAPH.
principal feature of and the greatest achievement in South Australian
telegraphy is the construction of the line across the centre of the continent to
Port Darwin, a distance of about 2,200 miles. This line is the means of
bringing the Australian Colonies into continuous communication with
England and the rest of the civilized world. Nothing could exhibit with
treater force the enterprise which characterizes the people of this province
than their undertaking on their sole responsibility, and in the face of almost
insuperable difficulties, the task of bridging over this vast and almost unknown
territory. As long ago as 1857 Mr. Todd brought under the notice of the
Government the desirability of connecting Australia with the Old . W orld by
means of telegraphic communication, but nothing was done in the matter.
On the return of John McDouall Stuart, the explorer, to Adelaide, in
December, 1862, from the expedition in which he bad penetrated right across
the continent, and through the portion which up to that time had been
considered an impassable desert, the subject was again considered; but the
undertaking was regarded as too gigantic for South Australia to engage in,
and the question was allowed to remain in abeyance. The matter once more
cropped up in 1869, when it was prominently brought under the notice of the
Government, and various schemes were suggested for carrying out the work.
Amongst these was one by the British-Australian Telegraph Company, who
offered to lay a cable to Port Darwin if the South Australian Government
would construct a land line to meet it there ; and the result of the negotia-
tions which took place was that an agreement to that effect was entered into,
the Government pledging themselves to have the line completed and open
for traffic on January 1, 1872, or within a period of twenty months. The
greater portion of the distance to be traversed was unknown, and for 1,850
miles it was unexplored. It was true that Stuart by crossing it had shown
that its passage could be effected in certain seasons by a party lightly
equipped, but the country for the most part was barren ; for hundreds of
miles there was no timber, and the posts for the line, which for a great
portion had to be of iron to escape the ravages of white ants, had con-
sequently to be carted over the entire distance, where, of course, no roads
existed The wire and insulators had to be imported from Europe, and the
materials were landed at Port Augusta and Port Darwin, so that the
construction might be commenced simultaneously at each end. A practical
route for the line had to be selected, and this was expeditiously effected by
Mr. John Ross. .
The line was divided into three sections, the northern and southern
beino- let to contractors, and the Government undertaking the central and
most 3 difficult, which stretched over a distance of 600 miles, and subsequently
extended to nearly 800. Water was known to be scarce, roads, bridges, and
wells had to be made, precipitous ranges to be surmounted, and sandy
deserts to be crossed, besides which every morsel of food had to be earned
by the parties themselves. The cost of the work was originally estimated at
£l2O 000, an amount which, even under the most favourable circumstances,
would have been very small, but in the face of the unforeseen obstacles which
presented themselves turned out to be absurdly low. The Government
expeditions started from Adelaide in August ,1870, and the first pole was
planted at Port Darwin in the middle of September, and at Port Augusta on
October 1 All the necessary arrangements had been made, and every thing
was progressing satisfactorily, the middle section being nearly completed,
when the contractors at both ends fell behind in their work. Assistance was
immediately rendered to the southern contractor, and he had got over his


difficulties, when the expedition of the northern contractor, after putting-up
aoout 120 miles of poles, utterly collapsed, principally owing to most of his
draught stock, which was required for transit purposes, having died, and the
contract was terminated by the Government Overseer. At this period only
six months remained of the time by which the line was covenanted to be
completed, and the public anxiety was extreme. The Government at once
dispatched to Port Darwin Mr. R. C, Patterson, the Assistant-Engineer of
the colony, in charge of a large and very powerfully equipped party,“to finish
the work, offering Mr. Patterson a bonus of £1,500 if he could effect it in
time; but_ this expedition also encountered unexpected difficulties, which
rendered its task impossible. Mr. Todd was consequently himself sent
round with reinforcements, the steamer in which he embarked sailing 100
miles up the Roper River, which runs into the Gnlf of Carpentaria. 0 He
made the spot which he reached the basis of operations, and thus saved 300
miles of cartage that going to Port Darwin would have entailed. Notwith-
standing that the wet season set in almost as soon as he arrived, renderino 1
the country next to impassable for teams for some weeks, the work was
prosecuted with so much energy and activity that the two ends of the wire
were joined on August 22, 1872, or a little over eight months bej ond the
specified time. Thus this grand undertaking was successfully finished within
a period of two years. The line up to this time had cost £370,000. Mr.
Todd returned to Adelaide overland, and with his party were entertained at
a grand banquet in the Adelaide Town Hall, at which messages were
exchanged with London and Washington. Since that time iron poles have
been erected throughout the length of the line, and the expenditure has
brought up the outlay upon it to £453,711.
It was thought probable that the blacks would interfere with the wire
but electric shocks which'were given to some of them during the progress of
the work appears to have given them a wholesome dread of the “ white man’s
devil, as they call it; and though they have attacked the stations, and in
one or two instances with loss of life to the operators, they have never
touched the wiie. The total distance from Adelaide to Palmouth is 12 500
miles,of which 9,146 are laid with cable. Reckoning the interest on 5 the
cost of the land line, it is worked at an annual loss of £30,000, but the returns
from the line itself nearly cover the working expenses. Fourteen stations
have been established between Port Augusta and Port Darwin, and the
Adelaide daily papers report in each issue the state of the weather at each.
Messages pass between London and Adelaide in ten hours. The benefits
which have been derived by the whole of the Australian Colonies from the
carrying out of this work, which might fairly be considered a national under-
taking by one of the group, has met with the most warm acknowledgments,
not only from those principally interested in the existence of so extremely
valuable a mode of intercourse with Europe, but also from the mother
country and other nations of the world. So far, however, the whole cost of
maintaining the telegraph has fallen upon South Australia. The construction
of the line, amongst other indirect advantages, has tended in an eminent
degree to the opening-up of the previously supposed worthless interior of
Australia; and there is no doubt that in the not very remote future the
whole of the continent will be utilized and probably settled.
THE LINE TO WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
The geographical position of South Australia rendered it, prior to the
construction of the line to Eucla, practically the most westerly of the Austra-
lian group; and, being the first port of arrival and the last of departure for


the mail steamers running between them and the mother country by way of
the Suez Canal and the Cape of Good Hope, the necessity for telegraphic
communication between Melbourne- Sydney, and Brisbane was many years
ago recognised. The latest move of South Australia, which proves how much
alive she is to the importance of the position she holds, is the construction of
the telegraph line to Eucla, on the boundary of Western Australia, so that
the earliest intelligence may be received of the news brought to King George’s
Sound by the mail steamers and the latest transmitted there on the departure
of the vessels. The undertaking and the difficulties to be encountered were
only second in magnitude to the construction of the line across the continent.
The length is nearly 1,000 miles, of which only 220—the section to Port
Augusta—had previously been erected. The country traversed was mostly
sandy desert, and all the material, fodder, and water had to be carried by the
teams, in some cases the distances within which the last could be procured
being over 100 miles, and the work was prosecuted during an extra dry
season. The cost was .£75,214.
TELEGRAPHS IN GENERAL.
The first line of telegraph in the colony was erected in December, 1855.
It extended from Adelaide to the Semaphore at Port Adelaide, a distance of
about nine miles and a half. In 1870 there were 75 telegraph offices, 1,183
miles of line, and 1,718 of wire. The messages numbered 128,485, and the
revenue reached £10,649. At the end of 1879 there were 4,393 miles of lines
and 5,934 of wire, the length of lines authorized or in progress being 850
miles. There are 149 telegraph offices and 237 operators connected with them.
Last year the number of telegrams (local and intercolonial) was 494,620, and
of international telegrams 21,028, The receipts were for local and inter-
colonial messages £33,766 12s. 10d., and for international £18,948 7d.
The business, therefore, of this department has more than quadrupled itself
since 1870, and the revenue has become very nearly five times as great. The
total expenditure on telegraph lines and stations, excepting the Port Darwin
line, to June, 1879, was £342,072. Communication is established with the
colonies of Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, Western Australia, Tas-
mania, and New Zealand. The telegraphic tariff of the colony is as follows :
From Adelaide to London, 10s. Bd. per word, inclusive of names and ad-
dresses. Between Adelaide and its shipping-place, Port Adelaide, 6d. is
charged for ten words, exclusive of addresses, &c., and Id. for every
additional word. The inland rate is Is. for ten words, and for intercolonial
messages 2s. to Victoria, New South Wales, and Western Australia for ten
words, 3s. to Queensland, 7s. to Tasmania, and 10s. 6d. to New Zealand, the
additional amounts in the last two instances being rendered necessary in con-
sequence of the cable charges.
POSTAL ARRANGEMENTS,
The head-quarters of the Post and Telegraph Offices are the Adelaide
Post-Office, a very handsome building of fine white freestone, the foundation-
stone of which was laid by the Duke of Edinburgh during his visit to the
colony in 1867. Its chief feature is a spacious public hall, around which are
placed the various departments. The roof is coved, and of glass,
which gives a very fine effect. The Albert clock tower is 149 feet in height.
By railway, coach, and ship, the average number of mails dispatched from
Adelaide daily is 326. As showing the great progress which has been made
in the postal business, the following figures may be interesting In 1870
there were 274 post-offices throughout the colony ; the letters carried during
the year numbered 3,049,818, and the newspapers 2,198,47 v, and the revenue


amounted to ,£30,398. On December 31, 1879, there were 449 post-offices.
During the year 1879 the number of letters and packets which passed through
them had increased to 1,008,414, and of newspapers to 6,141,956. The
revenue of the Post-Office in 1879 was £73,174 2s. sd. Money-order
offices are established in connection with many of the post-offices ; in 1879
there were 108 of the former, and the number of orders issued by them was
34,181, covering an amount of £108,826, the net revenue derived therefrom
being £1,153. Money-orders are allowed to be sent by telegraph. Regular
communication with the adjoining colonies is maintained by steamers, and
also daily by an overland mail to Melbourne, which travels 500 miles in
sixty four and a-half hours. The inland and intercolonial rate charged is
twopence per half-ounce for letters, and newspapers not more than seven
days old are forwarded free to any place beyond the town in which they are
published.
A direct fortnightly mail communication with Europe and the East is
carried on by the P. & O. Company, who have a contract with the Victorian
Government, to whom South Australia pays a yearly sum in proportion to
the amount of mails carried. The service is punctually performed, on an
average in about forty days. The mail steamers, whose outward terminus is
Melbourne, now call at Adelaide ; but prior to their doing this, so anxious
was South Australia not to lose the advantage of her geographical position,
that at great expense she regularly dispatched a steamer to King George’s
Sound to meet the ocean vessels and tranship the mails. On letters the
charge is Bd. per half-ounce, on newspapers Id. each. The vessels of the
Orient Steam Navigation Company also arrive and depart fortnightly and
carry mails, so that it may almost be said that there is weekly communica-
tion with Europe. American mails are brought by a line of steamers run
between San Francisco and Sydney.
The total revenue of the Postal and Telegraph Departments during the
financial year 1878-9 was £122,424, and the expenditure £153,463. The
estimated revenue for 1879-80 is £134,400, and the expenditure £162,153.
This is irrespective of the amount of outlay on new lines and offices. There
are employed in the post and telegraph offices, including country post-
masters, labourers on the Port Darwin line, &c., 984 persons.
METEOROLOGICAL.
In addition to these departments Mr. Todd has control over the meteoro-
logical and astronomical observations of the colony. The Observatory
possesses a very fine equatorial telescope, having an object-glass eight inches
in diameter and ten-feet focus. With it valuable observations have been
made of the transit of Venus, Jupiter and his satellites, Mars (for the
delineation of its parallax), Encke’s comet, &c. Meteorological observations
are noted on a very extensive scale, there being 140 rain stations—a greater
number than is possessed by any of the other colonies.
LOCAL GOVERNMENT.
Local self-government in South Australia extends back to a very early
period in the history of the province. It presents itself under two systems—
Municipal Corporations, managed by members elected at stated periods by
public vote, and invested with extensive powers under a special Act; and
bodies styled District Councils, elected by ratepayers living within the limits
of a proclaimed district. To the operations of both these bodies within the
sphere of their authority the colony has become largely indebted for much
that has enhanced its prosperity and developed its natural resources. By


their aid, and that of Boards entrusted with the expenditure of public money
upon the main arteries of traffic, streets and roads extending their ramifica-
tions in every direction have been constructed, and for the most part, main-
tained in a manner calculated to win for South Australia the credit of having
highways second to none in the colonies. The first and most important sub-
stantial system of local self-government introduced in South Australia was
that of
MUNICIPAL CORPORATIONS.
The first Municipal Council in Adelaide consisted of a Mayor, Council-
lors, and Aldermen. It was created under an Ordinance promulgated by
Governor Gawler in 1840. The English Statute of 1835 formed the basis of
this, but after a trial of the new system it was found necessary to resoit to
the plan of governing young Adelaide by a City Commission. This not
answering, on account of its cumbersome character and expense, a new Cor-
poration was formed in 1852, under which the affairs of the city were con-
ducted, till it became necessary to pass a measure whereby municipal insti-
tutions could be extended to other localities. This Act gave power to
establish a Corporation on the petition of not less than two-thirds ot the
ratepayers “in any town or place,” and specifically brought within its scope
all adults in the province who on October 1 in any year occupied or owned
any 66 land, house, warehouse, country house, or shop within the mumci-
pality, either as owner or tenant,” thus making them citizens. _ In the
first city assessment the annual value of rateable property was estimated at
£Bo,ooo—it now stands at over £364,000. A new Act was passed in 1861,
since which time the number of Corporations has increased to twenty-one, all
having similar rights to the municipality of Adelaide. The Municipal Cor-
porations now existing in South Australia are, besides Adelaide, Port
Adelaide, Kensington and Norwood, Hindmarsh, Glenelg, Brighton, Unley,
Gawler, Burra, Kapunda, Clare, Kadina, Moonta, Wallaroo, Mount Gambler,
PortPirie, Port Augusta, Strathalbyn, Goolwa, Jamestown and Yorketown.
There is a Municipal Association, consisting of delegates from each, oi the
above bodies. The object of this association is to watch the interests, and
to promote the welfare of the municipalities. The population of Adelaide
has advanced to over 38,000 souls ; the number of houses is more than
8,500. The total rates levied on assessments of property in one year are not
allowed to go beyond Is. in the pound, unless by the consent of a public
meeting of ratepayers, and then the utmost that can be levied is s. _.
in the pound. The Government supplement rates expended upon public
works pound for pound. The city is divided into six wards, viz.,
Gawler, Hindmarsh, Grey, Young, Robe, and Mac Donnell Wards, each
returning two Councillors, and the elections for Mayor and half the number
of Councillors are annual. There are no Aldermen at present, and in all the
municipalities the Mayor is elected, not from the Council, but from the
general body of ratepayers. There are eighty miles of streets within the
city boundaries. The houses, public buildings, &0, are supplied with
water laid on by the Waterworks Department under Government c °ntrol >
and with gas from the South Australian Gas Company s works, and the
streets are lighted with gas. Within the city are public swimming, tepid,
hot-water, and vapour baths. The public squares are kept in order by a
staff of gardeners under the Council. There are three markets in the city,
two for produce, one of which (East-End) is managed by a private Company,
and the third is a sheep and cattle market. There are seven miles of tram-
way within the corporate boundary, and another line (making in all three
distinct lines) is in course of construction.


In the country districts circumstances make it necessary to adopt a
different form of local self-government, and the people find it better to
organize themselves under
DISTRICT COUNCILS.
These now number 110. For their mutual advantage the Chairmen of these
Councils have an Association which meets periodically to discuss matters of
general interest. The extent of the districts under the jurisdiction of the
Councils varies from a few hundred acres to 253 square miles. The rate-
payers can obtain authority for the proclamation of a District Council by
petitioning, and the Council, when formed, has the power to levy and collect
rates for road maintenance, the Government subsidizing pound for pound
such of these rates up to Is. in the pound as are spent upon works. The
sum voted for Corporations and District Councils for 1878-9 was £50,000, and
for 1879-80 it was £55,000. The total assessment for District Councils
in 18(8 was £849,754, and for 1879 it was £964,730. This form of local
government was introduced in 1852, and has been found to promote not
only the advancement of the districts themselves, but the interests of the
colony generally, by the facilities offered for the transport of produce, the
opening-up of the country, and the encouragement of settlement through the
medium of the numerous roads maintained by the Councils as feeders to the
trunk lines.
BOARDS OF HEALTH.
For the improvement of the sanitary condition of the city and the
country generally a Central Board of Health was appointed under an Act
which came into effect in January, 1874. For the purposes of this Act the
various Corporations are created Local Boards of Health, and are required to
co-operate with the central body. Much benefit has accrued from the action
of these organizations. That Board consists of a salaried Chairman (Dr. Gosse)
a paid Secretary (Mr. R. G. Thomas), and an Inspector (Mr. G. H. Ayliffe)’
and five members. _ Powers are given to Local Boards to collect rates and
make such regulations as are deemed best calculated to improve the sanitary
condition of the districts within their jurisdiction, also to take steps for
checking existing disease and for mitigating nuisances. The Central Board
i® empowered by the Public Health Act to have special supervision over all
districts not included within the jurisdiction of any Local Board, and its In-
spector pays periodical visits for the purpose of reporting upon the sanitary
state of such localities. He has to report upon slaughter-houses, piggeries,
manufactories, schools, houses, dairies, cowyards, pollution of streams, and
general nuisances where the interests of public health are concerned. During
the year ending March 31, 1880, he paid 1,559 visits, travelled 4.520 miles,
and served 630 notices for abatement of nuisances. The extension of the
area of the Board’s operations has been considerable during the past twelve
months, owing to the growth of settlement in the colony.
LOCAL DEFENCES.
The colony has, strictly speaking, only within recent years entered upon
anything like a thorough system of military defences suited to its condition.
Beyond the temporary stay of a detachment of one of Per Majesty’s regi~
ments and the formation of a volunteer force, the colony during the first
twenty-nine years of its existence was destitute of any trustworthy means of
defence. In 1865 a very promising volunteer force, composed of men who-
enrolled for a period of three years was raised, and was maintained for


time; after which a Rifle Association, mainly composed of old volunteers,
were all that remained to represent the defensive element of the colony, but
eafly in 1877 public attention was forcibly directed to our defenceless state,
ment to take the matter in hand. In consequence of the feeling of insecurity
in the colonies, Sir W. F D. Jervois, now Governor of South Australia, and
Colonel Scratchley were appointed by the Home Government to visit the
Australian Colonies and report upon the means of defence best suited to
their circumstances. On May 31,1877, an enrolment of volunteers took place.
It was proposed to have two batteries of artillery and eleven companies of in-
fantry. The British Government, at the instance of the local authorities,
recommended Colonel Downes, R. A. , as Commander, ami Major Godwin, of the
103rd Regiment Royal Bombay Fusiliers, as Adjutant of the Local Forces,
These officers arrived in the colony towards the qnd of 1877, and at once
took charge of the volunteers, who had previously been commanded by
Colonel Biggs. Martini-Henry rifles, which were pronounced to be the
simplest and most effective military weapons existing, were procured from
England by the Government, and the work of getting the new Local Military
Force in a thorough state of discipline was begun. In addition to the
cannons already in the colony, two 10-inch 20-ton guns, with carriages and
platforms ; two 9-inch 12-ton guns; two 64-pounder guns of 64 cwt. ; also,
two 80 pounders, of 5 tons ; eight 16-pounders, with all the carriages,
limbers, &c., complete, were procured from England, and other measures
were adopted to give effect to the recommendations of the able military
authorities who reported upon our defence requirements. The Local
Military Force is a paid one, and consists of two batteries of artillery, one
troop of cavalry, and'nine companies of infantry, numbering at present 1,000
men. _
After the establishment of this force the South Australian National
Rifle Association offered to raise a body of men who, if provided with
Martini-Henry rifles and ammunition, and allowed certain privileges, would
find their own uniforms, engage to perfect themselves in company and
skirmishing drill, and bind themselves to serve as auxiliaries to the L.M.F.
in case of fnvasion. This proposal met with such favour and the movement
became so popular that the Government passed a short Act authorizing the
enrolment of rifle companies, and appointed Colonel Downes Inspecting Officer.
Under that Act every member of a rifle company is subject to inspection
twice a year, and has, among other things, to drill at least ten times a year,
turn out for military service under the officer commanding the forces in cases
<k invasion, but they cannot be ordered for service outside the province.
They are not paid, and find their own uniforms. They are governed by a
Council elected annually at a meeting of delegates from rifle companies, and
the South Australian Rifle Association, as it is now called, numbers upwards of
500 men. In accordance with the advice of Sir Win. Jervois, forts have been
erected oa Lefevre’s Peninsula to serve as a protection to the shipping at
Port Adelaide, and a military road is being constructed at the rear of the
sandhills skirting the coastline of St. Vincent's Gulf.
JUDICATURE.
Am[de provision is made for the administration of the law in the colony.
There is a Supreme Court, Insolvency Court, and in all the principal towns
and townships in the province Local and Police or Magistrates’ Courts. The
Supreme Court enjoys all the powers of the Courts of Queen’s Bench, Common
Pleas, and Exchequer. Besides this it fulfils the functions of the Courts of


Chancery and Vice-Admiralty. It also grants probates and letters of ad-
ministration, and hears appeals from all the tribunals of inferior jurisdiction.
This Court was first established by Act in 1855-6, but its constitution and
procedure have been materially altered since then. Until 1867 the Judges in
Banco together exercised the two branches of the jurisdiction of the Court ;
but as this was found unworkable and productive of inconvenience the two
branches of the Court were separated, and one of the Judges was appointed
Primary Judge, upon whom until lately has devolved the task of determining
all suits coming within the equitable jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
By an Act passed in 1878, modelled upon the English Judicature Act,
but containing several emendations on that measure, law and equity
have been fused, and last year regulations prepared by the Judges of the Su-
preme Court, who have taken a most active and creditable part in the work of
reform, received the sanction of Parliament, and have been ever since in
operation. In addition to the radical change involved in the abolition of the
old cumbersome and tedious technical forms of pleading, the proceedings of
the Court have been simplified in several other ways, and as a natural con-
sequence litigation has been rendered less expensive, and the administration
of justice in future will be speedier. One of the present occupants of the
Bench—the Hon. Mr. Justice Boucaut—was the Premier of the Ministry
under whose auspices the Bill was carried through Parliament. The Admiralty
Court is presided over by the Chief Justice. There are eleven Civil Sittings
of the Supreme Court in each year. Under an Act passed in 1868-9 power is
given to the Governor to form Circuit Districts in the colony and issue Com-
missions to hold Oircuic Courts. These tribunals are Courts of Record, of
Oyer and Terminer and general gaol delivery, and stand in the same relation
to the Supreme Court as such Courts in England do to Her Majesty’s Courts
at Westminster. In the Supreme Court actions are heard either before a
Judge or Judges, or before a Judge sitting with Assessors, or before a Judge
and Jury, or in certain cases before the Master, or a special referee or referees.
An appeal lies to the Full Court from a judgment or order of a single Judge,
and when the amount at stake is over £6OO the judgment of the Supreme
Court may be appealed against as a matter of course, but when the action
involves a lesser sura leave to appeal has to be obtained. Appeals lie to a
Local Court of Appeal, consisting of the Governor and Executive Council,
with the exception of the Attorney-General, and to the Judicial Committee of
the Privy Council.
When the Supreme Court was first established it was presided over by
only one Judge, Sir John Jeffcott, Mr. (afterwards Sir) Charles Cooper
succeeded Justice Jeffcott, and in his time a second Judge was appointed. In
1856 the title of Chief Justice was conferred upon Sir Charles Cooper, and in
1858 the number of Judges was increased to three. In 1861 Sir Charles
Cooper (who still lives, and receives a pension from the South Australian
Government) retired, and was succeeded by Mr. (afterwards Sir) R. D.
Hanson, who died in 1876, and was succeeded, in the same year, by Mr.
Samuel James Way. Mr. Justice Gwynne, who was appointed in 1858, is
now the Second Judge. The third seat on the Bench is filled by Mr. Justice
Boucaut.
The Local Courts of Full Jurisdiction can adjudicate in all personal actions
in amounts up to £IOO, and in actions of ejectment where the land is under
the Real Property Act and does not exceed £IOO in value. A Special Magis-
trate and two Justices of the Peace, or a Special Magistrate and a Jury of
four, constitute this Court, while one Special Magistrate or two Justices
form a Court of Limited Jurisdiction for the hearing of suits involving
claims under £2O in value. The Insolvency Court is a distinct institution.


and is presided over by a Commissioner, who has power to grant first,
second, and third class certificates, the last of which does not operate as a
discharge from debt, and to order imprisonment for a term not exceeding two
years in cases of fraudulent insolvency. In Adelaide and at Port Adelaide
Police Courts are established, where offences against the peace are dealt
with, and persons charged with serious offences are committed for trial at
the Supreme Court. Authority is also given to deal summarily with
certain larcenies and other minor criminal offences. Throughout the colony
there are numerous Local Courts, presided over by a Special Magistrate or a
Special Magistrate and two Justices, as the case may be. There is a. Coroner,
who presides over all inquests held in the city and suburbs, and in important
cases attends inquests in country districts. Inquests in the country are
usually conducted by the Magistrates or Justices of the Peace. The police
force is very efficient. It is managed by Mr. Commissioner Hamilton, and
comprises 296 constables for the whole colony, of whom 128 are mounted.
The Metropolitan Police Force consists of 91 men, eight detectives, and a
guard of four men at Government House. In the country districts there are
44 foot police, who are assisted in the principal towns by the mounted
troopers. At Port Adelaide there is a force of ten men, eome of whom
are water police ; and in the Northern Territory there are eleven constables.
The troopers, who are a fine body of men, do excellent service,and are dis-
patched on duty to all parts of the colony. Owing to the orderly character
of the community a large force is not necessary.
EDUCATION.
THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS SYSTEM.
Within the last few years educational affairs in South Australia been
completely revolutionized, and our public school system, which previously
was the worst in the colonies, is now undoubtedly one of the best. The
object kept steadily in view is the education up to a certain standard of
every child in the colony. The standard is a low one, the only compulsory
subjects being reading, writing, and arithmetic, but instruction is also given
in other branches. The ages during which children are obliged to attend
school are from seven to thirteen, and the rule is made imperative except as
regards those who are able to show that they are being otherwise educated or
have attained the standard. The Act establishing the present system was
passed in 1875. Under it the public schools were placed under the charge of
a Council with a permanent President, the Council being subject to the
Minister of Education, who, however, rarely interfered, except on matters of
policy. This plan of administration had a three years’ trial, ami under it a
great impetus was given to the erection of new schools, the appointment and
classification of competent teachers, and the weeding out of those who might
have been considered competent under the old regime, but were now no
longer regarded as suitable instructors for the youth of the colony. But the
Council did not do as much as had been expected of it, and the system of divided
responsibility was condemned. In 1878 an Act was passed abolishing the
Council, and entrusting the entire management of the schools to the
Minister, who alone is responsible to Parliament. The executive head of the
department is Mr, J. A. Hartley, 8.A., B.Sc., formerly President of the
Council, who now has the title of Inspector-General of Schools. The
Secretary of the Council has been made the accountant under the new
arrangement, and the office staff consists of seven clerks and one cadet. The
central department is assisted by Local Boards of Advice, who are appointed


in all parts of the colony, and perforin their duties without fee or reward.
There _ are five School Inspectors, each of whom has a certain district
apportioned to him, and recently an Assistant-Inspector has been appointed.
About a year and a half ago the compulsory powers of the Act were brought
formally into operation, and School Visitors were appointed to wait on the
parents and try and induce them to send their children to school. There are
now a Superintendent and seven School Visitors. The compulsory clauses
are being enforced in twenty-three districts, but so far there have been
exceedingly fewprosecutions, the moral suasion exercised by the Visitors and the
threat of legal proceedings having been enough to induce nearly all parents
to send their children to school during the thirty-five days in each quarter of
a year which the law requires them to attend. Uniform fees of 4d. per week
for children under eight years of age and 6d. for older children are charged
, in all schools ; but in cases where the parents are too poor to nay for the
education of their children that duty is taken upon itself by the State.
During 1879 the fees of 3,689 children were ftius paid out of 35,276, the
total number attending school. This aggregate was 1,274 in excess of that
of the previous year, the increase being mainly due to the continued depres-
sion in the copper mining districts. During 1879 the fees paid by parents
amounted t 4 .£17,770 Is. 9d., and by the State to £909 15s. lOd. The
education given is entirely secular, though the teacher is allowed to read the
Bible before school hours if the parents of his scholars wish him to do so.
He is not, however, permitted to take part in other religious instruction in
the school buildings, though they are let for Surtday-school purposes or for
divine worship in country districts where there are no more suitable rooms
available. In such cases a small charge is invariably made.
There are now 221 school buildings the property of the department. Of
these 108 have been provided since January 1, 1876. Most of them are of
stone, with brick dressings, but recently contracts have been let for the
erection of wooden schools for districts where the population is fluctuating.
Some of the stone buildings are very handsome, and those in the laro- e centres
of population have cost from £B,OOO to £IO,OOO each, including °the land.
There are three of such schools in the City of Adelaide. During the years
1876-7-8 the expenditure on new schools has varied from £so,ooo'to £70,000
and last year there was expended on new buildings £37,244
ss. 7d , and on improvements £4,242 2s. lid. The cost per head of’the
accommodation provided during 1878 was £ll 45., and in 1879 £ll Is. ;in
previous years it was a trifle under £lO per head. The number of children in
attendance at the public schools during last year was 30,528, while 4,748
attended provisional schools—small schools in country districts where a
grant-in-aid^is given to the teacher, but not in the form of a fixed stipend.
Of the 35,276 children on the school rolls in the province there was an average
daring 18/9 of 18,523. This aggregate shows an increase
of 1,768 on the previous year in the average attendance. The total number
of public and provisional schools under the department at the close of 1879
was 342, as against 268 in the year 1875. But the increase in the accommo-
dation during the three years has been much greater than these figures
indicate, as many small schools have been closed when larger ones have°been
built. The staff of teachers consists of 788 persons, 460 of whom are
females. The increase from 1878 to 1879 was 89. The teachers of the
schools in large centres of population Model Schools as some
them are termed—receive fixed salaries, the fees going to the State,
Other teachers, besides receiving a certain fixed stipend, are allowed a bonus
according to the percentage of scholars who pass a prescribed examination,
and another for instructing pupil teachers. They also obtain the fees paid by


the children and other small allowances. The average percentage of
passes in the public schools during 1879 was 71T8 against 73 83 in the
previous year, and in the provisional schools 54"30 as compared with 60.
Besides the schools named there are 69 evening schools in operation. A class
for imparting instruction in mechanical drawing has also been established,
and during 1879 it was attended by from 15 to 20 pupils, most of whom are
journeymen mechanics or apprentices.
Under the direction of the Minister of Education an advanced school for
girls was opened in Adelaide in September, 1879. It was begun with 30
pupils, but during the second quarter the number was increased to 50, and it
now stands at 70. The teaching staff consists of a head mistress and three
assistants, besides special teachers for French, German, and drawing.
In the city there is a Training College. There are now 31 students
in training for the position of teachers. Fifteen of these are females.
Under the Act of 1875 the department grants scholarships and exhibitions
annually as a stimulus to the scholars in the State and private schools.
The most valuable is the South Australian Scholarship, which is worth
£2OO a year, and is tenable for four years, the holder being entitled to
become a student at one of the European Universities. This is competed
for annually by students who have been at least five years resident in the
colony, and was won at the end of 1879 by T. H. Beare, 8.A., Adelaide.
Then there are three University Scholarships, worth .£SO a year each, tenable
for three years, annually offered, and open to all schools ; besides six
exhibitions, worth £3O a year each for three years, and open only to
State-school children. The way is thus opened up for the poorest child to
gain access to the best seats of learning if only he be clever and diligent
enough to gain one of the scholarships offered by the State. The Act of
1875 gave power to the Government to set apart 20,000 acres of land
per annum as an endowment fund, out of which the increasing demands of
the educational system would have to be met. Besides this there has been a
yearly grant of money made by Parliament. The revenue from the education
lands was formerly managed by the Council of Education, but it is now
added to the general revenue of the country, and a vote large enough to
cover all the requirements of the year is made by Parliament. At the end of
1879, 163,789 acres of these lands were leased, and the revenue derived there-
from was £8,988 19s. 2d. The total cost of instruction during the year,
including the expenditure for the erection and improvement of school
buildings, was £123,335 15s. sd. The revenue derived from rents of lands,
Model School fees, &c., amounted to £16,621 os. 7d. The vote on the
Estimates last year was £87,257 145., exclusive of the cost of buildings,
which is defrayed out of loan. Including all the payments made to teachers,
the cost to the State of each child instructed during last year was £1 13s. Id,,
and of each child in average attendance £3 4s. 2d.
In addition to the State schools there are in the colony several private
schools of the grammar-school type, which are well managed and are entirely
self-supporting. Some of these deserve to be placed on an equal rank, as
regards the curriculum of studies and general management, with the two
large Colleges alluded to below.
ST. PETER’S COLLEGIATE SCHOOL.
This is a Church of England school, situated in grounds of thirty-six
acres in one of the suburbs on the north-east of Adelaide. The Bishop of
Adelaide is ex officio Visitor, and the affairs of the school are managed by a
Council of fifteen Governors incorporated in 1849, of whom the Bishop, the


Dean, and the Archdeacon of Adelaide are ex officio 'members. The school
was originated chiefly through the exertions of the late Ven. Archdeacqci
Woodcock and Mr. Marshall MacDermott, and was first opened as a pro-
prietary school in Trinity Church Schoolroom in 1847. It has since been
endowed, partly by private munificence and partly by the Society for Pro-
moting Christian Knowledge. A large number of scholarships and exhibi-
tions are attached to it, three of which are for the encouragement of natural
science. The foundation-stone of the present handsome buildings was laid
by the Bishop in 1849. Since then they have been extended at various
times, and, besides accommodation for boarders and a Head Master’s house,
consist of a large schoolroom, classroom, ar#i chapel. The latest additions
opened this year are a lecture-room for natural science, with laboratories
attached, five courts, and a gymnasium ninety feet long, and provided with
complete apparatus. The school and classrooms have also been refurnished,
and a room built for the use of dayboys out of school hours. The school is
open to all boys not under seven years of age who can read and write and
will conform to the rules. The course of instruction, as determined by the
Governors, is that of the public schools of England. Greek is not com-
pulsory, and attention is paid to modern languages and natural science.
The religious worship and teaching, as dictated by the Act of Incorporation,
is in accordance with the formularies and liturgy of the Church of England,
under such regulations that the advantages of the school may be participated
in by the children of other Christian bodies without interfering with their
peculiar religious principles. The number of boys in September, 1879, was
155, of whom twenty-seven were boarders. There were seven masters, of
wliqm four are resident, one is lecturer in natural science, and one teacher of
modern languages, besides visiting masters of drawing, music, and gymnastics.
Elementary drawing and singing are, however, taught to junior boys as a
part of the ordinary school work. Many old pupils have taken high positions
in the English Universities, Woolwich Military Academy, and elsewhere.
The Head Master is the Rev. W. Bedell Stanford, M.A., Ball. Coll.,
Oxford.
PRINCE ALFRED COLLEGE.
This is a collegiate school which was founded by members of the
Wesleyan Methodist denomination, whose governing body is a committee,
and whose Chairman is a Wesleyan minister appointed by the South Aus-
tralian Conference. It was established to secure the benefits of a sound
education for the sons of Wesleyan Methodists, but the school is open to all
other denominations. The foundation-stone was laid in 1867 by the Duke of
Edinburgh, after whom the institution has been named. The building is of
the Elizabethan style of architecture. The central portion was opened for
the admission of boarders and day-pupils in July, 1869. The prosperity that
attended the College induced the committee to erect a new wing to the
building. This addition, comprising large schoolroom, classrooms, dormi-
tories, lavatories, laboratory, &c., was opened early in 1878. The present
Head Master is Mr. F. Chappie, 8.A., B. Sc. (London), who resides at the
College, and in whom is vested its entire control. There are on the staff
two other graduates of London University—the second master, Mr. S.
Churchward, B. A., and Mr. R Wainwright, B.Sc., third master. Besides
those already mentioned there are six resident assistant masters, and
German, drawing, and music masters. There were on September, 1879, in
attendance at the College 180 day scholars and 50 boarders. Five scholar-
ships are annually competed for at Christmas, the two highest being of the


value of £ls 15s. each. Many students from this College have secured high
University honours since the .establishment of the University of Adelaide.
Three University scholarships of the value of £l5O have been wen by them
since 1876.
THE UNIVERSITY.
The University of Adelaide was founded under an Act passed by the
Legislature in 1872 ; a handsome new building to cost <£25,000 is now being
erected ; two munificent donations of £ 20,000 each have been given by
wealthy colonists; four professors have been appointed, and are regularly
conducting classes ; and Her Majesty the Queen has been petitioned to
grant letters patent to the University. The issue of the charter has been
delayed, because the Imperial authorities object to the claim of the Adelaide
University to grant degrees of Bachelor and Doctor of Science. There is a
strong feeling in the colony that the power to grant these degrees should be
obtained ; but the University authorities have decided to concede the point
for the present, and when they have got the letters they will
seek additional powers to grant the degree in science, and also degrees to
females. An Act was past last year to alter the original Act in the
direction indicated by the Secretary of State for the Colonies, but the
Government have given the assurance that after the charter is obtained—s©
that students who have taken degrees may get the full honour of them
without delay—an effort will be made to obtain the necessary sanction to
confer the other degrees. The establishment of the Adelaide Uni-
versity was largely due to the generosity of Mr. W. W. Hughes,
a wealthy South Australian, who offered to give £20,600 towards
the foundation ot Union College—an institution chiefly supported by the
Presbyterians, Congregationalists, and Baptists—with a view to providing a
means of higher education, especially to young men desirous of entering the
Christian ministry. With commendable wisdom and liberality the gentlemen
who took a prominent part in this movement, and in whose hands the £20,000
was to be placed, decided that it would be better to devote the money to the
founding of a University, in order that its benefits might have a wider
application than would have been possible in connection with a Theological
College. Thereupon Mr. Hughes agreed to apply his donation of £20,000 in
founding two Chairs in the proposed University. An appeal was made to the
public, and a University Association was formed in September, 1872, which
set before itself two objects—to procure an Act for the incorporation and
endowment of a strictly unsectarian University, and to collect the necessary
funds. After some delay an Act carrying out the views of the Association
and founding the University of Adelaide was passed by the Legislature in the
session of 1874, and assented to in November of that year. It provided that
no religious test should be administered to persons becoming students or
officers of the University, and it granted an endowment of 50,000 acres of land,
a building site of five acres (which was afterwards somewhat reduced) on North-
terrace, Adelaide, and an annual grant from the general revenue of £5 per
cent, on all moneys contributed to the University, providing that such grant
should not exceed £IO,OOO in any one year. The annual grant for the last
few years has been about £2,000, exclusive, of course, of the revenue from
the handsome land endowment. As soon as the Bill became law the Hon. (now
Sir) Thomas Elder imitated the noble example set by Mr. Hughes, and
placed £20,000 at the disposal of the University authorities. The manage-
ment of the University is vested in a Council of twenty members. To this
Council the Association surrendered its trust on November 11, 1874. The
first Chancellor was the late Chief Justice Sir Richard D. Hanson, who was


succeeded in April, 1876, by the Vice-Chancellor, the Lord Bishop of
Adelaide (Dr. Short). The present Vice-Chancellor is Chief Justice Way
(the Hon. S. J, Way). The four professors are—Mr. David Frederick
Kelly, M.A., Hughes Professor of Classics; Rev. John Davidson, Hughes
Professor of English Literature ; Mr. Horace Lamb, M A., Elder Professor of
Mathematics; and Mr. Ralph Tate, RGS,, Elder Professor of Natural
Science. A large number of gentlemen who had matriculated at other
Universities have had ad eundem degrees conferred upon them ; but only five
matriculated students have yet earned an original degree at the Adelaide
University, namely, Mr. Thomas Ainslie Caterer, who took his B.A. degree
in April, 1879 ; Messrs. Stirling Smeaton, Hans Hamilton Mack, Percy
Ansell Robin, and James Henderson, who took their B.A. degrees in April,
1880 ; and Thomas Hudson Beare, who won the South Australian Scholarship
in December, 1879, is also entitled to take his B.A. degree, but is at present
continuing his studies in one of the European Universities. There are at
present fourteen young persons, male and female, studying for degrees; and other
non-matriculated students are attending the University classes as follows :
Physics, 26 ; Chemistry, 24; Latin, 3 ; Elementary Greek, 3 ; and Literature,
15. The classes are held in temporary rooms. The new University build-
ing, the foundation-stone of which was laid by His Excellency Sir William
Jervois on July 30, 1879, is to be completed on July 1, 1881. A portion of
it, however, is to be ready for occupation by December 1, 1880. The archi-
tect is Mr. W. McMinn, who took the prize for the best design. The total
income of the University during 1879 was £14,964 19s. 3d. Three of the pro-
fessors receive £I,OOO per annum each, and the fourth £BOO.
THE. SOUTH AUSTRALIAN INSTITUTE.
The South Australian Institute, for the promotion of the study of the
arts, sciences, literature, and philosophy, was incorporated by Act of Parlia-
ment in 1855. It is managed by a Board of seven Governors, and has a
Secretary, Librarian, and three Assistant-Librarians, and a Curator of the
Museum connected with the institution. It contains a circulating library, a
reference library, a museum of natural history, and a free reading-room,
which is stocked with all the leading newspapers and periodicals of Eng-
land, America, and all the Australian Colonies, and in which any books
from the library may be read free of charge. The circulating library
contains 22,286 volumes, and there are over 700 subscribing members. The
free reference library contains 1,862 volumes. The Society of Arts and
and the Adelaide Philosophical Society are incorporated with the Institute
and share its advantages, while separately promoting their several objects.
Classes are held at the Institute, and annual examinations have taken place
for six years past, the successful students being rewarded by certificates of
merit. The subjects taken up are drawing, painting, modelling, French,
German, and phonetic shorthand. Lectures are also delivered on scientific
subjects. Besides the South Australian Institute in Adelaide there are
ninety country and suburban Institutes affiliated to it, all of which are sub-
sidized by Government. A resolution was carried last session in the House
of Parliament authorizing the opening of Institutes at certain hours on
Sunday afternoons, and in conformity with this expression of opinion the
South Australian Institute has been opened since then on Sunday—so far with
satisfactory results. A new Institute is now being built in Adelaide close to
the site of the present establishment, which will afford far greater advantages
to the public, and will give greater accommodation for the display of the
valuable collection comprising the Museum of Natural History.


RELIGIOUS.
It has contributed not a little to the social and religious well-being of the
community and to the harmony which has existed among the various sects
that the foundations of the province were laid upon principles entirely
opposed to any connection between Church and State. There was, it is true,
a temporary departure from these principles between 1846 and 1851, when
the Legislative Council—then a nominee Chamber —at the dictation of Gover-
nor Robe, who held strong views on the subject, placed sums of money on
the Estimates for division among the different sects of professing Christians
in proportion to their numbers. In 1851, however, the colonists, led by the
late Rev. T. Q. Stow and others, determined that this recognition of religion
bv the State should cease, and they returned a sufficient number of represen-
tatives to the Legislature to carry their point. The endowment of religious
bodies was abolished, and since then the various Churches have gone on their
way prosecuting their work, supporting their ministers, and extending their
operations upon the purely voluntary system. It is gratifying to note that
the utmost harmony prevails among different religious bodies, and there is
more healthy and general association in good works than in perhaps any other
colony. Taking as being still practically correct figures prepared in September,
1879, there is an average of one place of worship to every 280 of the popula-
tion. There are in the colony 902 churches and other buildings used for
public worship, and the total number of sittings is 142,530, thus providing
accommodation for more than one-half of the entire population. There are
571 Sunday schools in the province, having a staff of 5,180 teachers and
39,670 children. , .... ~
The Church of England, spread over the entire colony, constitutes the
Diocese of Adelaide, and numerically stands at the head of all the denomina-
tions. The Right Rev. Augustus Short, D.D. (Oxon.), was appointed Bishop
by Her Majesty’s letters patent in 1847, and His Lordship still holds the
position. The diocese has been endowed by Lady Burdett Coutts, and by
legacies left by Mr. Leigh and Captain Allen. The affairs of the Church are
managed by a Diocesan Synod, composed of the clergy and lay representatives,
who are elected by the individual Churches. There are several organizations
and benevolent institutions established in connection with the Church. Ine
Clergy Widow and Orphan Fund for the ten months ending April 30, 18/J,
shows an income amounting to £1,713, and it has a capital and guarantee
fund of £6,298 ; the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in loreign
Parts had an income during 1878 of £3,603 ; the General Synodal Endow-
ment of Churches Fund has a capital £15,650 ; the Incorporated Church ot
England Endowment Society shows the receipt from its foundation ofno less
a sum than £25,419. The Bishop has under him the Dean and Archdeacon
of Adelaide, the Archdeacon of Flinders, two Canons, a staff of forty-hve
clergy and 125 lay readers. A handsome Cathedral has been partially
finished on a site between North and South Adelaide, and services are regu-
larly held in it, albeit it will be many years before the full design is com-
pleted. There are seventy-nine churches and a number of unconsecrated
places where divine service is held. ~ .. , ~
The Roman Catholic Church stands high in the religious statistics of the
province. It is presided over by a Bishop (the Right Rev. Dr. Reynolds),
who was consecrated in November, 1873. There are a Vicar-General and
thirty-seven priests, and over sixty churches, chapels, and other buildings
which serve for religious and school purposes. There are three religious
Orders for men, viz.:—The Jesuits, the Benedictines, and the Christian
Brothers, with the Dominican nuns and Sisters of St. Joseph for ladies.


The principal schools are the College of St. Aloysius, Sevenhilla, con-
ducted by the Jesuit Fathers ; and the Christian Brothers’ in Wakefield-
street, Adelaide. The Dominican nuns have a convent for young ladies in
Franklin-street, while the Sisters of St. Joseph conduct schools in Pirie
and Russell streets, and in many places throughout the colony. There
are likewise an Orphanage (over which the Very Rev. F. Byrne, Y. G.,
presides) and a Home for Unfortunates under the management of the Sisters
of St. Joseph.
The Wesleyan Methodist Church is governed by its own Annual Con-
ference, which is composed of an equal number of ministers and laymen.
The President of the Conference this year is the Rev. H. T. Burgess.
The Churches are united first in Circuits, under the charge of a minister, and
the Circuits are also formed into the following Districts ; —The Southern,
Middle, Northern, and Yorke’s Peninsula. Over each District a Chairman pre-
sides. The following statistical returns were given at the Conference of 1879:
—Circuits, 38; churches, 202; other preaching places, 61 ; ministers, 46 ;
local preachers, 300 ; Sunday-school teachers, 1,932 ; Church members, in-
cluding communicants, &c., 5,538; Sunday-schools, 172; Sunday scholars,
14,335; attendants on public worship, including members and others,
36,582. The South Australian Church is connected with the entire
Wesleyan body of Australia and New Zealand, and once in three years a
General Conference is held, when representatives from each Conference and
colony take the whole affairs of the Connexion into review. The General
Conference alone has legislative power ; the annual Conference can only
be administrative. The next General Conference will be held in Adelaide in
May, 1881.
The Congregationalists owe the origin of their first church in South
Australia to the exertions of the late Rev. T. Q. Stow, who was sent out
from England in 1837 by the Colonial Missionary Society. This eminent
minister laboured vigorously in the colony for five-and-twenty years, and at
his death a very handsome Memorial Church was erected in Flinders-street,
Adelaide, as a tribute to his memory. The Congregationalists have forty-
one churches erected by them, twelve rooms for preaching, between thirty
and forty ministers, and a staff of lay preachers. They have formed a
Congregational Union and Home Mission of ministers and laymen. The
Chairman elect for the current year is Mr. Augustine Stow, a son of the late
Rev. T. Q. Stow.
The Baptists had representatives among the earliest settlers of South
Australia. Their first place of worship, which was in Hindley-street, Ade-
laide, was established in 1839. The Baptist Association, of which the Rev.
S. Mead, L.L.8., M.A., is Chairman for this year, meets twice a year, but,
like the Congregational Union, it exercises no jurisdiction over individual
congregations, its object being to promote Christian fellowship and to carry
out various objects in which the Churches have a common interest. The
Baptists have 37 churches, with a personal membership of 2,264; 17
ministers are in charge of churches ; there are seven preaching stations and a
staff of lay preachers. There are 3,047 Sunday-school scholars, with 317
teachers. The total revenue last year was £9,159, and the amount of debt
£9,223. Last year 118 baptisms were reported.
The Presbyterians have fifteen churches, fifteen other buildings, and
eleven ordained ministers. The Presbytery meets usually four times a year,
the Rev. J. H. Angus being Moderator for the present year ; the Rev. D.
Paton, M.A., 8.D., Clerk of the Presbytery.
The Free Presbyterians have six churches and three ministers. They
are governed by their own Presbytery, which meets half-yearly. The Rev.


Jno. Sinclair is the Moderator, and the Rev. James Benny is Presbytery
Clerk. . . . .
The Lutheran Church holds a prominent position here. German immi-
gration into South Australia was in the first instance mainly due to religious
persecution in certain parts of Germany. The late Rev. A. Ravel, who
brought a band of his fellow-countrymen with him, was one of the pioneers
of the colony. The German Evangelical Lutheran Church at the present
time has 50 chapels, 20 rooms used for worship, and 20 ministers. The
Lutherans have established mission stations at the Finke, MacUonneil
Ranges, and at Bookaltaninna, near Cooper’s Creek.
The Primitive Methodists divide the colony in 18 Circuits, within which
are active religious organizations connected with their denomination. They
have 107 chapels, 27 other preaching places, 24 ministers, and 17*j local
Christiang have 23 Circuits, within which are 102 chapels, 25
preaching-rooms, 31 ministers, and 131 local preachers. .
The “Church of Christ” has twenty-two places of worship, the pulpits or
which are supplied by evangelists and by members of the different congre-
& £ < Christian” denomination has seven chapels, six pastors, and
several assistants. , ....
The Methodist New Connexion has one church, a fine building, in
Franklin-street, Adelaide, which was established by the late Rev. James
Mauo'han, who was a man distinguished not only as a minister but also in
the ranks of literature and science. The Rev. M. J. Birks is the present
minister of the Church. , , ... ~
The New (Jerusalem) Church has one building for public worship m
Adelaide, of which the officiating minister is Mr. B. G, Day.
The Society of Friends has two meeting-houses, one in North Adelaide
and the other at Mount Barker. Mr. H. W. Phillips is the Registering
Unitarians have a neat church in Wakefield-street, Adelaide. The
Rev. J. C. Woods, 8.A., is the minister. Services in connection with this
denomination are also held at Woodside and Mount Barker. . ,
The Jews have a handsome synagogue in Bundle-street, Adelaide, or
which the Rev. A. T. Boas is the minister.
PUBLIC AND PRIVATE CHARITABLE INSTITUTIONS.
South Australia is well supplied with public, semi-private, and private
charitable and benevolent institutions. We have Hospitals for the sick,
Asylums for orphans and neglected children, for the poor and infirm, tor the
deaf and dumb and blind, for the insane, and for dipsomaniacs ; a Retreat
for sailors, a Club for bushmen, a Children’s Hospital, a Home for Inebriates,
and Mission Stations for the natives. There are here, as elsewhere, a certain
proportion of the population who, from age or infirmity, cannot earn their
own living, and these are cared for at a Destitute A sylum on N orUi-terrace,
which is managed by a salaried Chairman (Mr. J. M. Solomon, J.P.) and a
Board. The Asylum affords a home for the aged and decrepit, and there is
also a lying-in department where destitute women can receive medical
attention and comforts. The Board, which has branches in the country
districts, and is supported out of State funds, affords relief to persons outside
the institution, the number varying with the circumstances of the colony.
The boarding-out system for children, an effort to establish which in Sydney


is just now being made, has long been adopted here with satisfactory results.
Industrial School for such destitute children as are not thus cared for is
in existence at Magill, a few miles eastward of Adelaide, and there is a staff
of nurses to attend to the wants of the inmates, and of teachers to educate
them. There are two Lunatic Asylums—one in Adelaide and the other at
Parkside, a suburb lying eastward of the city. Both are under the able
superintendence of Dr. Paterson. There are two State Hospitals—one in
Adelaide and the other at Mount Gambier, in the South-East. The Adelaide
Hospital is managed by a Board, the members of which are nominated by the
Government, the private subscriptions not having reached the amount which
entitles the subscribers to exercise their power of electing uny members of
the Board. There are two Resident Surgeons and a large staff of nurses and
attendants. The Mount Gambier Hospital is under the management of Dr.
Jackson. Recently a fine Hospital has been erected at Kapunda, a town
about fifty miles north of Adelaide. Mr. F. H. Dutton, a wealthy absentee
holder of land in the district, contributed £2,000 towards the cost of the
building, a block of land was given, and with the addition of other donations,
subsidized pound for pound by the Government, a sufficient sum of money
was raised to erect a commodious building. Smaller Hospitals have been
established at the Burra, Port Augusta, Port Lincoln, Port Wallaroo, and
elsewhere. The amount voted in 1879-80 for public charitable institutions
was £73,695.
THE RELIEF OF THE ABORIGINES.
A sum is voted every year in Parliament for providing the natives of the
colony with clothing, blankets, stores, and medical attendance. Last year
the amount so voted was £5,254, and upon officials called Protectors of
Aborigines devolve the duty of apportioning the various articles which may
be bought for distribution. An institution known as the Aborigines’
Friends’ Association, partially supported by Government, has done useful
work in connection with the educational and moral and religious training of
the natives. It has a farm and mission station at Point Macleay, Lake
Alexandrina. The contribution of the Government does not amount to more
than £I,OOO a year, and this with private subscriptions and the profits of the
farm make up the income. A large number of natives have availed them-
selves of the advantages of the institution, have been taught to read and
write, and fill situations on sheep-stations and farms. Some have been
comfortably married and settled on land which the Government have handed
over to them. There is an unsectarian Church on the station, and it com-
prises fifty members, thirty of whom are blacks. There are two deacons,
both of them aboriginals. In June last the Rev. George Taplin, who had
held the position of Superintendent of the station for twenty years, died,
his death producing profound grief among the aboriginals, by whom he was
greatly beloved. Mr. Taplin was peculiarly well qualified for the post he so
long occupied. He had a good knowledge of medicine, and acted as doctor
and surgeon in cases of sickness and accident; he was an excellent
mechanic, and was able to superintend all the departments of the farm
and station ; and he was a philologist of no mean repute, his works bearing
upon the language and habits of the native tribes being greatly appreciated
by the learned Societies of London.
The Poonindie Mission, on the western shore of Spencer’s Gulf, a
few miles from Port Lincoln, was the first institution where any effort
on a large scale was made to civilize the native tribes of the colony. It
was founded by Archdeacon Hale (now Bishop of Queensland) in the year
1850. He bought a run at Poonindie with 5,000 sheep upon it,


and proceeded thither with five married couples and a single
man—all aborigines who had been educated in the Government school
for natives in Adelaide. To this run the Government added an aboriginal run
and a yearly grant of £3OO, and the Society for the Propagation of
the Gospel contributed sufficient money to purchase 160 acres of land. Under
the Archdeacon’s supervision the mission prospered, attracting a large
number of natives. A chapel was built, a day school for women and chil-
dren was started, and the station was well looked after. In 1856 Archdeacon
Hale left to become Bishop of Perth, Western Australia, and he was suc-
ceeded by the late Rev. O. Hammond. Unfortunately, however, the mission
now became disorganized. Parliament withdrew its annual allowance, and
the number of natives decreased. The sheep-station was still worked, but
the efforts to civilize the aborigines fell into abeyance. These efforts were,
however, renewed in 1866, when Mr. G. W. Hawkes was appointed co-
trustee with the Bishop of Adelaide and Mr. Samuel Davenport. A system
of regular daily work was brought into operation ; the natives were not only
taught how to do things, but were paid for their labour; the school was kept
open day and night, and everything was done by means of music and rational
amusements to promote the comfort and happiness of the inmates. This mode
of management has continued, and the result has been satisfactory. In Sep-
tember, 1879, there were over eighty natives resident at the Mission Station,
many of them having lived at Poonindie from ten to twenty years. Two
families have been there over twenty-five years. In the season of 1878-9
10,529 sheep were shorn, 200 acres of wheat were reaped, and a crop of hay
was cut. All the work of the station and farm is done by the natives, only
one white man and an experienced boundary-rider being employed in con-
nection with the farming operations and management of the stock. There
were 130 head of cattle, 26 horses, and a good breed of Berkshire pigs, &c.
The report of the Acting-Trustee at the close of 1878 was satisfactory, there
being no sickness and the conduct of the aborigines being good. Since the
year 1866 no Government aid in money has been given to the institution,
which has been self-supporting, the natives maintaining themselves and
families by their own labours. We may add that at a ploughing match
which took place last year at Port Lincoln three of the Poonindie natives
won the first and two other prizes for ploughing with horse teams.
According to a Parliamentary return prepared in May, 1878, the quantity
of land held by the various Aboriginal Mission Stations in the colony is as
follows:—Point Macleay, 4,113 acres; Point Pierce, situated on lorke’s
Peninsula, 17,920 acres; Poonindie, 15,617 acres; Lutheran Mission
Association, 452,480 acres. The operations of the last mentioned Associa-
tion are carried on at Kopperamanna, east of Lake Eyre, and at the Finke,
south of Mac Donnell Ranges, and reports speak well of their praiseworthy
efforts to civilize the blacks of the Far North.
BUSHMEN’S CLUB.
For many years a bush missionary, of whom nothing whatever was
known save that he was engaged in evangelistic work, travelled from
station to station all over the colonies of Australasia, depending
for food entirely upon the hospitality of those he visited, declining
all pecuniary aid, and doing many kindly acts of charity for the
lonely shepherds with whom he came in contact. He called himself
tf William,” and was known by no other name. In 1866, while in South
Australia, this philanthropic man, viewing with pain the debaucheries of
bushmen when making their short visits to the city after shearing-time, con-
ceived the idea of establishing a retreat for them similar to the Sailors


Homes. He accordingly opened the project to Mr. J. H. Angas, J.P., who,,
with his father, the late Mr. George Fife Angas, and several other friends,
took the matter up warmly, and became large contributors to a fund for the
establishment of a Club. The house and grounds formerly occupied by Sir
Charles Cooper (one of the early Judges of the colony), in Whitmore-square,
were secured, and on the 20th of May, 1870, the Home for Bushmen, with
“ William” as Hon Superintendent, was formally opened by Sir James
Fergusson, who was Governor at the time. Since then the original premises
have been extended by the addition of two wines, a large central building
and four baths, and the grounds have been greatly improved. The rules of
the Club provide that “no intoxicating liquors are allowed within the
buildings or grounds, and any person infringing this regulation is liable to
expulsion.” In spite of this strict rule, the Home has been and still is
largely resorted to by the class for whom it was established, and the success
of which is in great measure due to the labours of “ William,” now known as
William M. Hugo (a relative of Victor Hugo), who has continued to hold the
position of Hon. Resident Superintendent Manager. The institution is now
incorporated, and is self-supporting, the bushmen paying members’ subscrip-
tions and moderate charges for board and lodging when in town. The
newspapers of the day and various periodicals are supplied, and a number of
amusements are provided. The following facts and figures in relation to the
operations of the Club will be of interest; —From May 20,1870, to December 9,
1878, over 13,000 weekly and casual boarders have been entertained, 1,547
tickets of membership have been issued, and 355 distressed persons have
received relief. The balance-sheet issued in December, 1878, showed the
receipts for the year to have been £96 ss. over the working expenses, and
the total assets, consisting,.mainly of buildings and land, leave no less a sum
than £7,298 over the liabilities. Since the balance-sheet was made out the
new centre building has been completed and paid for. Great credit is due to-
the various Boards of Management and to the Trustees for their long and
faithful services to the institution.
BLIND AND DEAF AND DUMB ASYLUM.
This institution, which was originated through the philanthropic exertions
of Mr, W. Townsend, M.P., is now successfully established at Brighton, a
marine township near Glenelg. A very handsome edifice has been erected at
a cost of about £5,000, jointly contributed by private individuals and the-
Government. In September, 1879, there were thirty inmates, of whom,
seventeen are blind and the rest deaf and dumb.
ADELAIDE AND BENEVOLENT AND STRANGERS’ FRIEND
SOCIETY.
This purely unsectarian Society was established in the year 1839, and
claims to be about the oldest institution of a benevolent character in the
colony. It was started for the purpose of assisting strangers who might
arrive here sick or in distress, widows who might be left with large families,
and persons overtaken by misfortune to whom timely aid would be of the
utmost consequence. It receives no aid from the State, being entirely sup-
ported by voluntary contributions. It seeks to help those who are honestly
striving to help themselves, and lends no encouragement to idleness and
pauperism. The Hon. John Colton, who has taken an interest in the Society
for very many years, holds the position of President. The number of cases
relieved range from 200 to 300 a year.


ADELAIDE FEMALE REFUGE.
This institution is also supported by voluntary contributions, and i»
managed by a General Committee, a Ladies’ Committee, and an Hon. Secre-
tary (the Rev. W. B. Andrews). It was founded in the year 1857 with the
object of ameliorating the condition of victims of profligacy and checking the
spread of vice by affording a home and protection to those who desire to turn
from their evil courses. Means are taken to seek out fallen girls and induce
them to enter the Refuge, where, by kindness and the ministrations of
various clergymen and friends, they are encouraged to reform and helped into
situations. The work done is shown by the following figures : —On March
31,1878, there were—lnmates, including two children, 11; admissions and
readmissions, 73; total, 84. Gone to situations, 38; gone to friends, 10;
gone to Destitute Asylum, 8 ; gone to Hospital, 3; absconded, 3 ; left of
their own accord, 7 ; in the house, March 31, 1879, 15 ; total, 84.
BELAIR INEBRIATES’ RETREAT.
A few years ago a number of philanthropic colonists decided to establish
a retreat to which habitual drunkards might retire with the object of getting
the better of their pernicious habits. Subscriptions and donations to the
extent of over £3,000 were collected, and the Government subsidized that by
an equal amount. A convenient house and grounds were purchased at
Belair, about eight miles south of Adelaide, and the late Mr. George Fife
Angas added to the property of the institution by a large gift of land in the
same neighbourhood. Up to August, 1879, there have been seventy-two
admissions, and the committee feel satisfied that the influence of the residence
at the Retreat has been very beneficial. Mr. Thomas Osborne is the present
Superintendent.
HOME FOR INCURABLES.
Through the active exertions of a few citizens a Home for Incurables
was established in 1878. Subscriptions to the amount of about £1,900 were
collected, and the Government has supplemented that by an equal amount.
This has enabled the committee to purchase a block of nine acres of land,
together with a house, at Fullarton, and the premises have been renovated
and furnished.
ADELAIDE CITY MISSION.
This is an unsectarian Society started for the purpose of relieving the
distress of people living in the city and of giving them spiritual help and
consolation. A large Mission Hall has been erected in the west part of
Adelaide ; three missionaries are employed, and a Mothers’ Mission and a
Visiting Committee have been established. A series of lectures, concerts,,
and literary entertainments are provided in the winter months, and have
proved very attractive to the class for whom they were instituted. Mr.
Berry, the senior City Missionary, has initiated a house scheme by which he
is enabled to let cottages to poor people at a much smaller rent than they
would have to pay to ordinary landlords. He has about thirty houses under
his care, and he states that during the past year he has been able to save
about £l5O in rent to the persons who tenanted his cottages.
YOUNG MEN’S CHRISTIAN ASSOCIATION.
Within the past few months a Young Men’s Christian Association has
been established in Adelaide under the most favourable auspices. Com-
modious premises have been taken in Gawler-place, and the Board off


Management have provided reading, recreation, smoking, and lecture rooms.
There is also a capital gymnasium. At the present time there are about 600
members. Mr. C. H. Goode is President of the Association.
OTHER INSTITUTIONS.
In addition to the foregoing there are a number of private benevolent
institutions :—The Convalescent Home, the Sailors’ Home at Port Adelaide,
St. Vincent de Paul’s Orphanage, the Orphan Home, and the Cottage
Homes, which are carrying on their work in an unostentatious but effective
way.

THE NORTHERN TERRITORY.
As already stated, South Australia proper extends from the Southern
Ocean northwards as far as the 26th parallel of south latitude. Be-
tween this and the Indian Ocean is what is known as the Northern
Territory of the province. The successful crossing of the centre of Australia
from south to north by the intrepid explorer, John MacDouall Stuart, in
1862, led in due course to the annexation to South Australia of this extensive
region, containing, as it does, an area of 531,000 square miles. Settlement
in the first instance took place at Escape Cliffs, Adam Bay, at the mouth of
the Adelaide River, the site of the township having been decided upon
by Lieutenant-Colonel Finniss, the first Government Resident. These
early attempts at colonizing the newly acquired possession proved a
failure, the position of the spot on which it had been decided to


build the chief town being found unsuitable. Mr. G. W. Goyder, the
Surveyor-General, was next sent to the North Coast with a thoroughly
efficient party, and before very long determined upon making the elevated
land on the eastern shore of the harbour of Port Darwin the
site of the chief town of the settlement. The choice was
an eminently felicitous one. Indeed, it is doubtful it a more
eligible locality for the purpose could be obtained throughout
the length of the northern coast. Palmerston was the name given to the
town, which is healthily situated on the summit of very picturesque cliffs,
some 80 feet high, covered with tropical vegetation, which reaches to the
water’s edge. The advantages of the elevated position are very apparent.
The inhabitants get the full benefit of the cooling breezes that come off the sea
in the evening almost constantly throughout the year, and the land is also
effectually drained. In the wet season, no matter how heavy the fall of rain
may be, the water in a few hours disappears, leaving the ground as dry as
ever. The risk to health from stagnant water is consequently small. The
cliffs somewhat suddenly slope to the shore, and leave a small valley between
them and the terminating headland—Fort Hill. In this hollow the Govern-
ment camp was first pitched, and here also on either side of the hill is to be
found all the wharfage accommodation that the settlement yet boasts of. This
is the site of the port of Darwin as distinguished from the town of Palmerston
on the hill-top. .... . , - * , ~
Port Darwin Harbour itself is one of the finest in the whole ot Australia.
It covers a very large area, and affords a perfectly safe anchorage to vessels of
any size. The entrance, which is two miles wide, with a depth of aboutfifteen
fathoms, can be approached without danger, King a Table, the only hill of any
height in the neighbourhood of the harbour, being an excellent guide to ship-
masters. At Palmerston the offices of the Overland Telegraph Department
and the establishment of the British and Australian Telegraph Company stand
side by side, and from the latter proceed the two cables which place all
Australia in direct communication with the remainder of the civilized
° The climate of the Northern Territory is tropical in every sense of the
word, and there are but two seasons. The wet season begins about the end of
October, and lasts about five months. During the months of January and
February the rainfall is something tremendous, and it is during this period
that the settlers suffer most from the heat. The maximum temperature in the
shade during the day at this time of the year as recorded by Mr. J. A. G.
Little, senior officer of the Telegraph Department, is 96°, and the minimum
during the night 65°. The temperature during the remainder of the year is
equable and not extremely hot, except perhaps just prior to the setting in of
the rainy season. Day after day there is a clear bright sky, the sun never
being shadowed by the semblance of a cloud. Mr. Little s observations
during the months of June and July show the maximum temperature during
the day to be 84°, and the minimum during the night 56 J The annual
rainfall registered at Port Darwin during the last nine years varies from
51-820 inches to 80 050 inches, while the wet season rainfall for the
same period ranges from 47 590 to 77'873 inches. The sickness most
prevalent amongst the settlers is a kind of intermittent fever, accompanied by
a<me, or, as it is commonly called, “the shakes.” The time at which this
very trying, though not really dangerous, complaint makes its appearance is
just after the wet season, when the south-east monsoon sets in. The swamps
in the low-lying lands rapidly evaporate under the fierce heat of a scorching
tropical sun, exhale malaria, which is not only injurious to the health ot the
new-comers but also most pernicious to the aboriginals themselves. It has


been noticed that tlie wetter the season the more virulent and general are tie
attacks of the fever. They were particularly severe in 1873, and a«ain
during 1878-9. “
The character of the soil in the Northern Territory is somewhat variable,
but its fertility generally is unquestionable. No difficulty is experienced in
rinding large blocks of rich land capable of growing tropical products in luxu-
riance, This is especially true of the lands in the neighbourhood of the rivers
and watercourses which thread the country in all directions. Maize *rows
profusely and the experiments made justify the belief that such articles as
sugar, cotton, ana indigo would also prosper in certain situations. Mr. J. G.
Knight aUhe time of writing the following remarks (1875) was Secretary to
the then government Resident, and had every opportunity of arriving at a
correct judgment as to the agricultural capabilities of the Northern Territory.
He says ; Nearly all the kinds of tropical fruits and vegetables which have
been fairly tried are found to thrive and flourish in these latitudes The
plantain and banana grow wherever they are stuck in the ground and pro-
duce excellent fruit. A number of cocoanut-trees planted three or four years
ago look in splendid condition. Pineapples of delicious flavour reach matu-
rity with great rapidity in the Government Botanic Garden. The ‘ custard
apple, also known as the‘sour-sop,’and the ‘papaya’ yield most delicious
fruit. The tamarind-tree grows well. The guava thrives also, as likewise the
rosella. bplendid specimens of the mango are obtained at Port Essingtoh.
Ihe lemon and orange trees in the Government Garden are growing rapidly
and appear to take kindly to the soil and climate. In vegetables the melon
tnbe succeeds admirably, and will soon grow as weeds in certain favourable
localities. Ihe yam and sweet potato are being cultivated with great success.
Arrowroot has been tried on a small scale, and thrives exceedingly well.
Excellent sugarcane is grown at the Government Garden. It is believed
that the tea-plant would thrive well in certain districts, and the same may be
said of spices, but none have yet been planted. One or two cotton-trees in
the grounds of the Government Resident have yielded excellent-lookim*
staple. Indian corn has been sown in several portions of the Territory, and
from the success which has attended the experiment in cultivation will soon
be greatly extended. In provender for cattle the couch-grass thrives in a
wonderful manner and is eaten with avidity. The buffalo-grass also promises
to grow both rapidly and well.”
- lP ecial regulations weL ' e framed under the Northern Territory Land Act
m 1873 in order to induce the occupation of land as plantations for the cul-
tivation of ‘ nee, sugar coffee, tea, indigo, tobacco, or cotton, or for special
purposes. They provide that the intending planter should be entitled to
select a block of country land not less than 320 acres in area, nor more than
1,280, at an annual rental of sixpence per acre, which land should become
his own absolute property if he complied with the following conditions
That within thirty days after the expiration of five years from the date of
application he show to the satisfaction of the Government that he had at, the
end of two years cultivated in a proper manner one-fifth of the extent of his
bolding with any of the above-mentioned productions ; that after such second
year he had annually cultivated in like satisfactory manner an additional
one-tenth of the entire area of his land ; and that at the expiration of the
full term of the five years he had one-half of the land cultivated, and the
whole of it enclosed with a fence, wall, or permanent hedge. The same
regulations also provided that two or more selectors might amalgamate their
selections and cultivate the land, either in co-partnership or as a registered
Company. This special provision for inducing the selection of land in the
lerntory for plantation purposes expired on January 1, 1876, but its applica-


tion was further extended for a further period of four years, namely
until January 1, 1880. The Government offered a bonus of £5,000 for
the first 500 tons of sugar produced and manufactured in the Territory,
and the offer has had the effect of inducing sugar-growers to test the
capability of the soil for “ growing the cane.” A short time ago an
agreement was entered into between the Government and Messrs.
John Spence, David Spence, and William Owston, merchants of Melbourne,
who are willing to test the capability of the Territory for the growth of the
sugarcane and other suitable products. The agreement sets forth that Messrs.
•Spence and Owston shall, up to and inclusive of the 31st day of December,
1880, have the right of searching for and selecting 20,000 acres of wastelands
of the Crown in the Northern Territory for a sugar plantation; the said lands
to be comprised of the alluvial river flats in not more than two blocks of a
rectangular shape, the length not to be greater than twice the breadth, the
breadth to front a river or a leading road, should the land abut thereon. Per-
mission is given to select the site on the Adelaide River or the Daly, if suit-
able. The survey to be done by a Government surveyor free of cost to
Messrs. Spence and Owston, who are to commence the planting of sugarcane
or other products from the date of their selection. Upon proof to the Govern-
ment Resident of the bona-fide expenditure by Messrs. Spence and Owston of
£lO,OOO in cultivating the land and in plant and machinery for sugar manu-
facture, and upon the production of not less than 500 tons of merchantable
sugar or other products of equal value obtained from the land selected,
Messrs Spence and Owston will be entitled to a grant of the lands in fee-
simple. The deaision of the Government Resident in this matter is to be
fined. Six years are allowed for the cultivation of the land and expenditure
of the money. Duri»g next session of Parliament a Bdl is to be introduced
giving effect to the provisions of the agreement. If the Parliament refuse to
pass the Bill the agreement will be void. The agreement was signed by the
parties concerned and by the Hsn. T. King (Minister of Education) on behalf
of the Government on March 8, 1880.
As to the pastoral capabilities of the Territory there can be no doubt,
and within the past two years 160,000 square miles of country have been
taken up by squatters, who are stocking it as quickly as possible. Mr. W. J.
Browne, of Adelaide, has recently formed both sheep and cattle stations on
the River Katherine, and Mr. Roderick Travers, of Sydney, has started a
cattle station at the Fountain Head Reef, situated about the centre of
Ike gold-fields. The existing regulations, specially framed for inducing
pastoral settlement, provide that the person who shall describe any country
not previously applied for within the Territory and without the settled
districts for pastoral purposes shall be entitled to a preferential right to a
lease for any period not exceeding twenty-five _ years, of any portion in
one block of not less than twenty-five nor more than 400 square miles in
extent, at an annual rental of sixpence per square mile for the first seven
years and ten shillings per square mile for the remainder of the term, on
condition the run is declared stocked within a period of three years at the
rate of two head of great cattle or ten lieau. of small cattle for every square
mile of country. No lease will be granted until the run has been thus
stocked. There are still 360,000 square miles available for occupation, and
as the accounts given by those who have lately examined the country in nearly
every direction are favourable it is not improbable a large portion will soon
be taken up.
In the latter part of 1877 Mr. A. W. Sergxson explored a great deal of
the country to the westward between the Daly and Victoria Rivers, and
from that gentleman’s report we learn that for soil, grass, and climate he is


of opinion the country in the vicinity of the Victoria River is second to
none. Some very steep ranges were crossed between the Daly and Fitz-
maurice, and the report says—“ Everywhere amongst these ranges extensive
valleys were met with, all beautifully grassed and with running creeks.
These valleys fenced would make excellent paddocks and homesteads.” Mr.
G. R. McMinn, who examined the country to the south of the Daly in the
early part of the same year, was not, however so prepossessed, the only
really good patch seen by him being “a block of splendid basalt and
limestone country, containing from 600 to 700 square miles, principally rich
block soil, and well watered with springs.”
North Australia, as before indicated, is remarkable for the number and
size of its rivers, and some of the principal of these run their course within
the boundaries of the Territory. There is the Adelaide, which empties
itself into Adam Bay, and is navigable for a distance of fifty miles ; the
Roper, which flows easterly, and finds its way into the Gulf of Carpentaria,
and is navigable for nearly a hundred miles ; the Victoria, in the western
portion of the Territory, which can be navigated by small craft at least 100
miles, and forty by large ones ; the Liverpool; the South and East Alligators
the Daly, which discharges itself into Anson Bay ; and many others, into all
of which rivers of less magnitude, but nevertheless fine watercourses, find
their way. The Daly was traced by Mr. McMinn for 240 miles. It may
fairly be said that no portion of Australia is better watered than the
Northern Territory, and the advantages of such splendid means of communi-
cation when the country becomes settled cannot fail to have a wonderful
influence in the rapid development of its riches.
Hitherto the only industry carried on to any extent has been that of
gold-mining, but that of itself is insufficient to advance the prosperity of the
settlement. Gold there is in abundance, as was proved by the trophy which
was forwarded to the Sydney Exhibition. Some splendid nuggets have oc-
casionally been obtained from the alluvial diggings, and the quartz-crushing
returns have in many cases shown as much as four, five, and six ounces
to the ton. Of course it often happens that the stone only yields a few
pennyweights ; but in one case a few tons of quartz, possibly picked stone,
gave the enormous amount of 81 ounces of gold to the ton. However, from
a report of Mr. J. A. Plunkett, formerly Warden, we learn that “ the
average of thirty-three crushings was 1 oz. 12 dwt. for every ton.” The
principal reefs at present opened are the Stapleton Creek, the Howley, John
Bull, Yam Creek, Union, Extended Union, and Pine Creek. The gold-
bearing country is mostly situated to the south of the plains that skirt the River
Adelaide, and these plains constitute one of the most serious difficulties with
which the mining population have to contend. They extend from the river a
distance of about twenty miles, and during the rainy season are transformed
into one vast sheet of water, which for weeks together puts an end to the
transport of all provisions and material to the miners, thus enormously
increasing the cost of cartage and consequent price of goods—dear enough in
the first instance, seeing that everything is imported from the southern
colonies.
For the past three years the settlers have continually agitated for the
construction of a railway from Southport to Pine Creek, in order that regular
communication between the reefs and Port Darwin may be ensured at all
seasons of the year, and the cost of carriage and time occupied in transit
lessened. In the session of 1877 a resolution was carried in the House of
Assembly that a survey of a line should be made from Port Darwin to Pine
Creek, and the work was completed towards the end of 1878 ; but the
estimate deduced from the report of the officer entrusted with the survey


showed that the undertaking would be so costly that the Government have
decided that they cannot carry it out. Some English capitalists, however,
have had their eyes upon the Territory for the last year or two, waiting a
favourable opportunity to develop its resources, and negotiations have been
opened up by their agents with the South Australian Government, with a
view to the construction of the Pine Creek line, and the taking up of large
blocks of land for plantation and other purposes. Mr. J. G. Knight who
has filled important Government positions in the Territory for the last seven
years, strongly advocates the construction of the line to Pine Creek, in a
pamphlet just published by him on the Northern Territory ; not, however,
merely as an easy means of reaching the gold reefs, but as part of a grand
railway which shall bridge the continent. e: Notwithstanding its natural
resources and the large sums of money expended on the place,” he says, “ the
progress of the Territory has been most disappointing. The first thing that
naturally suggests itself is to give life and form to the proposals made from
time to time to open-up the country by means of a railway, designed with a
view to its eventually being carried across the continent, and connected with
the line now being pushed forward to the Government Gums, via Port
Augusta.” One of Mr. Knight’s propositions is;—“ That tenders be called
for in London and the colonies for the formation of the entire line from
Farina to Port Darwin, provision being made to make the first section from
Palmerston to Pine Creek (150 miles), the work being paid for in land defined by
the Surveyor-General, and the contractors to state the price per acre at which
such land shall be valued. As a matter of course those who asked the lowest
sum for making the railway and offered the highest figure for the land would
be the most eligible for the undertaking, ” The matter will doubtless come
before Parliament in its next Session.
During o Port Darwin was made a free port, in the hope that the
trade of the place would be appreciably affected for the better. The antici-
pations of the settlers in this respect have not, however, as yet been so fully
answered as they desire. Nevertheless, the enactment has considerably
lightened the burdens which under exceptional circumstances weigh heavily
on the population, and has also been the means of inducing a greater number
of vessels to make Darwin a port of call. There is a feeling that the imposi-
tion of duties on some articles, especially those used by the Chinese, who
have settled in the Territory in great numbers and contribute but very little
to the revenue—such as tea, rice, fish, and especially opium—would prove
beneficial; and a duty on beer and spirits would not be generally objected
to as a means of increasing the limited revenue of the settlement.
Port Darwin is the point on the north coast which is now chosen by all
explorers as their goal. Small parties frequently make their way from
Queensland across the Border to the overland telegraph line, which they
travel down to the seaboard. These parties are generally in charge of stock
for the Port Darwin market, or are travelling in the expectation of discover-
ing new grazing country. The most important expedition of late was the
Queenslander Transcontinental Railway Expedition, under the command of
Ernest Favenc, and fitted out by the enterprise of Mr, Gresley Lukin, the
spirited managing proprietor of the Queenslander newspaper, the object being
the construction of a line of railway to the western boundary of Queensland,
and thence north-westward to Port Darwin. The exploration was success-
fully made by Mr, Favenc, who found that there were no insuperable
engineering difficulties in the way of the project. But there were other
impediments to its fulfilment, not the least being the improbability of South


Australia sanctioning the scheme, for reasons which it is scarcely necessary to
narrate, the colony naturally having a preference for a line of railway having
its terminus in her own country. Mr. A. Forrest, the well-known Western
Australian explorer, during last year successfully made his way from the
De Grey River, on the north-west coast, to Port Darwin, having explored a
large extent of country, but little of which had then been traversed. It has
since been determined by the Government of Western Australia to establish
a settlement at Beagle Bay, and to develop the resources of the rich country
lately discovered by Mr. Forrest in that part of the continent. The Northern
Territory will consequently ere long have a useful and valuable neighbour to
the westward.
The distance of the settled portion of the Territory from the seat of
government has had a very depressing influence on the development of the
possession, and unfortunately many causes, which perhaps it has been im-
possible to avoid, have tended to make it a very expensive incubus on the
parent State, splendid possession though it be. The Government have at
times endeavoured to make the country more self-supporting, but success has
not attended their efforts. Making Darwin a free port had a slightly bene-
ficial influence ; the contract entered into with the Netherlands India Steam-
ship Company has done good service, Port Darwin being as a consequence
brought into direct communication with the Indian Archipelago ; and the
liberal provisions which have been made in regard to the pastoral settlement
of the interior have also been instrumental in largely opening-up the country.
But the true cause of the settlement not progressing is the want of capital
and the absence of a population engaged in cultivating the products of the soil
—not one devoted solely„to exhausting the treasures of the mines. A mining
population of itself will never place the country on a prosperous basis. The
settlers themselves are of opinion that by regulating the introduction of the
Chinese element, which has lately become overpowering, the construction of
a line of railway to the reefs, and direct representation in Parliament, the
disabilities with which they have so long been familiar will pass away ; but
something further than this will be required to be done. The occupation of
the interior by pastoral lessees will in all probability ere long lead to a better
state of things ; but those portions suitable for agriculture must also be turned
to account before the onward progress of the Territory can be said to have
begun in real earnest. The population of the settlement is not increasing
at present. It was estimated six months ago that there were in the Territory
about 1,000 whites and 3,000 Chinese, but the European population has since
somewhat decreased.
STATISTICS OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
In compiling the following tables we have endeavoured to compress
as much useful information as possible relative to the progress and present
condition of the colony. We have had recourse to various official returns
and such other reliable documents as we could command, and have endeavoured
to secure perfect accuracy in every particular. It will be observed that
as a general rule we have chosen quinquennial periods, the term of five years
being sufficiently long for purposes of comparison, as well as for securing
brevity in the results :

LAND SALES,
The country Crown lands were originally sold at a uniform price of £1
per acre, with the exception of “preliminary sections,” which were disposed
of at 12s. per acre, each section containing 134 acres. Subsequently the
land was sold by auction to the highest bidder at the upset price of £1 per
acre. In 1868 an Act was passed providing for the sale of agricultural lands
upon credit, the object being to encourage the occupation and cultivation of

The gross amount of the purchase-money agreed to be paid by the

15s. 9d. on account of 993,507 acres either forfeited or of which the purchases
were completed at the end of 1879. This leaves £4,490,245 13s. 9d. due to
the Government upon 3,133,744$ acres held on credit. This sum will fall
due at various periods extending to the year 1888.

* In consequence of the disturbing effects of the gold discoveries in
Victoria in 1851 the agricultural statistics were not collected during that and
the two succeeding years. We have, therefore, substituted those for 1854 in
place of 1853 in the above and in Table VII.
The official records of the quantities of grain and other crops annually
produced in the colony do not extend further back than to the season 1878-9.
The following table has been compiled from these later returns
Table VI.
LIVE STOCK—PASTURAGE.
The pastoral lands of the colony contain 321,124 square miles, as shown
in Table 11. The returns for the year ended March 31, 1879, show that the
number of living animals, including horses, cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, and
poultry, within the counties was 6,023,755, and within the pastoral districts
1,477,390, making a total of 7,501,145, being an increase of 363,827 upon the
previous year.

IMPORTS AND EXPORTS,
The first recorded exports of staple produce took place in 1838, and con-
sisted of wool valued at £770, and of whalebone and oil valued at £4,270. In
1839 the exports of these articles amounted to £9,165, and in 3840 to
£15,650. In 1841 slates, lead, timber, and a few other articles were included
among the staple exports. In 1842 butter, cheese, tallow, and bark were
added. The first exportation of flour, wheat, and copper ore was in 1843,
when barley, oats, vegetables, salted beef, hides, barilla, and salt were also
included ; after which year the exports were still more numerous. The
quarterly returns of the Collector of Customs are very voluminous, and show
that more than 120 different kinds of staple articles are now annually ex-
ported. We have classified the whole under the several headings indicated
in the following ;

REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE.
. TJl ® “ General Revenue, 5 ' so-called, includes the “ Land Fund,” Customs
duties, and various other receipts, but the “Loans for public works” account
is kept separate in the official records.

contrary, the aggregate general revenue during the five years ended De-
cember 31,1878, amounted to £6,501,373, and the expenditure to £6,615,334.
It is necessary to explain also that the expenditure includes the amount? paid
on account of interest on and redemption of loans for public works.
The revenue for 1879 was £1,662,489, and the expenditure £1,847,256.

BANKING.
There are eight banking establishments in the colony, two of which have
been opened within the last three years. By an Act of Parliament passed in
18G3 the Banks are required to prepare periodical abstracts of their liabilities
and assets, upon a uniform plan and for fixed periods. The following tables
have been compiled from these returns :
Table XV.
Statement of the average liabilities and assets of the Banks, made up to
the end of 1863 and each subsequent fifth year ;
two columns, and the “ bills in circulation” and “ balances due to other
Banks.” So also the “total assets’’' contained in the right-hand column
include, not only the amounts given in the other two columns, but
“Government securities,” “landed property and Bank premises,” “notes
and bills of other Banks,” and “balances due from other Banks,” the
particulars of which are contained in the official returns.
The total average liabilities of the Banks for the fourth quarter of 1879
amounted to £3,550,924, and the assets to £7,207,815.


SAYINGS BANK.
This is one of the most flourishing institutions of the colony. It was
established in 1847, and the deposits in 1879 amounted to £569,661, or
£10,955 per week ; and the amount standing to the credit of depositors at
the end of 1879 was nearly £1,000,000, being at the rate of £223 7s. 6d. for
of the population. The following table shows the progress
every hundred of the population. The folk

The rent of a dwelling suitable for an artisan and his family in Adelaide
or the immediate suburbs varies from six to fifteen shillings per week, but in
the country towns the rate is less. Large numbers of artisans, however,
reside in their own freehold cottages. The savings of a few years have, in
many instances, sufficed to enable them to accomplish this. Land is cheap,
and the necessary advances for the erection of dwellings are readily obtain-
able from the several Building Societies. Cottages, with fuel and water, are
provided for ploughmen, shepherds, and other labourers employed on farms
or sheep-runs. The following are quoted rates for house-rent and for board
and lodging ;
House Rent.
Two rooms, 4s. to 6s. ; three rooms, Gs. to 10s. ; four rooms, Bs. to 15s. ;
six rooms, 12s, to 255., free from taxes ; single room, 2s. 6d, ; ditto (fur-
nished), 6s. to 9s. per week. Gas is Bs. to 12s. per 1,000 cubic feet, and
water laid on at Is. 6d. per 1,000 gallons.
Board and Lodging,

men, shopmen, &c., 15s. to 18s. ; clerks, &c., 20s. to 30s. : single females,
10s. to 15s. ; private lodgers at hotels, 20s. to £4 4s.
