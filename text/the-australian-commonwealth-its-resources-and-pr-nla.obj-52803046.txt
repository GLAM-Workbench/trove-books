PREFACE.
In the following pages, issued under the authority of the Prime
Minister, the Honourable Alfred Heakin, M.P., a brief account
is given of the Resources and Production of the Australian
Commonwealth.
The figures, in general, are those furnished in the first Official
Year Book of the Commonwealth, giving statistics for the period
1901-1907, and published under the authority of the Minister for
Home Affairs (Senator the Honourable J. H. Keatino). To this
work reference may be made for more detailed information.
The illustrations furnished are characteristic of Australian life
and scenery, and give some idea of the scale of development in this
part of the British Dominions.

I.—AUSTRALIA:
ITS AREA AND PHYSICAL FEATURES.
rWCSIdUVEASEV comprises (a) the island continent of Australia,
JmmMlk which is made up of the five States of New South Wales,
Victoria, Queensland, South Australia, and Western Aus-
tralia, (b) the adjacent island State of Tasmania, and
(c) the Islands of New Zealand. The five mainland States and Tasmania
were formerly independent colonies, but on the Ist January, 1901,
they were united to form the Commonwealth of Australia. New Zealand,
however, remained outside the Federation.
Australia is situated between the meridians of longitudes 113° 9' E.
and 153° 39' E., while its northern and southern limits are the parallels
of latitude 10° 41' S. and 39° 8' S., or, includ-
ing Tasmania, 43° 39' S. On the north it is
bounded by the Timor and Arafura Seas and
Torres Strait; on the south by the Southern

Ocean. Including Tasmania, the Commonwealth has an area oi' 2,974,581
square miles, the mainland alone extending over 2,948,3(5(5 square miles,
and in its vast area it contains nearly every description of soil and every
variety of climate from temperate to sub-tropical. Australia is about
twenty-five times as large as the United Kingdom; it is more than
fourteen times the size of the German Empire or Franco ; nearly sixteen
times as large as Spain ; and more than seventeen times larger than
Sweden. It is about three-fourths of the size of Europe ; a third of
that of the whole of North America ; and over a fourth of the whole
British Empire.

is now under tkc jurisdiction of South Australia.


From north to south the Australian Continent extends nearly 2000
miles, while its greatest breadth from east to west is about 2400 miles.
The coast-line of the Commonwealth, exclusive' of minor indentations,
measures 12,210 miles, which gives an average area of 244 square miles
to one mile of coast-line.
As regards the general appearance of its land surface, Australia may
ho described as a. plateau, fringed by a low-lying, well-watered coast,
with a depressed and, for the moat part, com-
paratively arid interior. In the early days of
the settlement of Australia it was thought
PHYSICAL FEATURES.
that the interior part of the continent consisted chiefly of desert plains ;
as settlement progressed, however, it was discovered that these districts
comprise some excellent pastoral country.
SNOW DRIFT AT MOUNT KOSCIUSKO, NEW SOUTH WALES.
The main mountain feature of Australia is the Great Dividing Range,
which, starting in the Cape York Peninsula in Queensland, runs parallel
with and close to the eastern shore of the
continent through the States of New' South
Wales and Victoria. In the south one branch

of (he range sweeps westward towards the boundary of Victoria and
South Australia,, and the other—the main branch —ends in Tasmania,
which is, to a largo extent, covered by ramilieations of the range'. The
greatest height attained is in New South Wales, near the Victorian
boundary, where Mount Kosciusko reaches an altitude of 7300 feet. The
Dividing Range', with its lateral spurs, receives various sectional names
in the Slates through which it passes. The seaward slope of the range is

generally sharp and precipitous, and in places marked by extensive
chasms and lofty precipices. On the inland side the descent is more
gradual, the mountains merging by easy degrees into the great plains
stretching towards the centre of the continent. In South Australia a
chain of mountains runs northward from the neighbourhood of Adelaide
and terminates in the Flinders Range, near Lake Torrens, while the
plateau in Western Australia is traversed by ranges in various localities.
The three largest rivers of the eastern coast are the Burdekin, dis-
charging into Upstart Bay, and draining an area of about 53,500 square
miles ; the Fitzroy, which reaches the sea at
Keppel Bay, and drains 55,600 square miles ;
and the Hunter, which drains about 11,000
RIVERS.
square miles, and empties itself at Newcastle. The River Murray, with
its numerous tributaries, drains a considerable part of Queensland, the
major part of New South Wales, and a large part of Victoria, and is one
of the longest rivers in the world. It forms for a considerable distance
the boundary between New South Wales and Victoria, and subsequently
entering South Australia, flows into the ocean on the southern coast of
that State. In good seasons it is navigable for 2345 miles from its mouth,
its total length, including the Darling, being 3282 miles. The rivers
flowing into the sea on the north-west coast of Australia —e g., the
Murchison, Gascoyne, Ashburton, Fortescue, De Grey, and Fitzroy —are
of considerable size, as also are those of the northern coast — e.g., the Vic-
toria, Daly, Gregory, Leichhardt, Cloncurry, Gilbert, and Mitchell Rivers.
The Victoria River, estimated to drain 90,000 square miles, is said to be
navigable for the largest vessels for fifty miles.
Though much of the rainfall received over the vast area of the Aus-
tralian continent passes off by evaporation or finds its way to the sea, a
large volume sinks into the earth and helps
to swell the store of artesian water contained
in subterranean channels and reservoirs.
ARTESIAN WATER.
The two most important artesian basins are (a) the Great Australian
Basin, about 569,000 square miles in area, and extending over parts of
Queensland, New South Wales, and South Australia, and (b) the Western
Australian Basin. Large numbers of bores have been sunk by the
Governments as well as by private individuals, the water thus obtained
proving invaluable for watering stock and for irrigation purposes. The
discovery of artesian water has, in fact, completely changed the outlook
over thousands of square miles of country where surface water was the
only want, and has opened the way for the development of areas as yet
barely touched. It has also enabled stock to be travelled where formerly
such a thing was difficult or impossible.


II. —THE FEDERATION OF THE COLONIES.
For many years now there has been complete political freedom in
Australia. As the newly-founded colonies increased in wealth, commerce,
and population, and their resources and in-
dustries were developed, the evils of a prac-
tically irresponsible form of government
RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT.
began to be felt. During (ho decade 18b! to 18(10 all the Australian
colonies were granted responsible government, with the exception of
Western Australia, which remained a Crown colony until 1890.
GOVERNOR GENERAL'S RESIDENCE AND BOTANICAL GARDENS, MELBOURNE.
Although in the early days of the colonisation of Australia the ten-
dency was towards the separate evolution of isolated settlements, it was
not long before the desirableness of considering the interests of the
Australian colonies as a whole was recognised.
.Movements in the direction of (he establishment of some form of a
Federal Conned took place before the middle ol the nineteenth century,
and when responsible government was granted
the evil of want of union among the colonies
was from time to time forcibly shewn. From

that time the idea of federal ion gradually increased in the popular favour.
At last, on the Ist January, 1901, after several .intercolonial conferences


had been held, the six colonies were federated and united of their own

dust as, prior to Federation, full powers of self-government in loeal
matters had been enjoyed by each separate colony, so now each State
retains its former powers of legislation and
administration, except in certain matters,
over which exclusive control has been sur-
rendered by all the States, The legislative

powers of the Federal Parliament embrace, among other matters, trade
and commerce, navigation and shipping, railways, taxation, naval and

telegraph, and like sendees; census and statistics: emigration, immigra-
tion, and naturalisation; currency, banking, weights, and measures; and
conciliation and arbitration in industrial disputes.
Various departments and sub-departments have been transferred
from time to time from the States to the t'ornmonwealth, while other
departments necessary for the due performance of the Commonwealth
functions have been created. In the former elass are such departments
as those of Patents, Trade dlarks. Copyrights, Designs, Naturalisation,
and Meteorology, whilst in the latter are the Ministerial departments of
External Adairs, Home Adairs, Treasury, Trade and Customs, Deleneo,


Attorney-General, and Postmaster-General, as well as such general de-
partments as Audit, Treasury, Crown Law Department, Census and
Statistics.
The Sovereign is represented in the Commonwealth by a Governor-
General, and in each State by a Governor. There are two legislative
chambers both in the Commonwealth and in each State Parliament, the
members of one House of each of the Parliaments, and of both Houses of
most of them, being elected by the people.
A feature of Australian public affairs worthy of special mention is the
system of local government which has been established. The whole of
the settled parts of the country have been divided into municipal districts,
each of which is under the control of a council or board elected by the
ratepayers to deal with matters of purely local interest and to carry out
local works.
Since the advent of systems of responsible government, steady and
strenuous efforts have been made by all the States to develop the resources
of the country and to improve the condition
of the people. To this end commerce and
settlement have been assisted by the con-
struction of great railway systems throughout

IMMIGRATION.
the States; by the extension of highways wherever settlement has gone;
by the construction of irrigation works, not only for domestic and stock
purposes, but also for the irrigation of the land; by subsidising steamship
services, and by the construction of extensive docks, wharves, and jetties
at the coastal towns. The “bush” has been explored, surveyed, and thrown
open to settlement. Facilities have been granted both to hona-fide
settlers on the land and to the working classes in the centres of more
dense population to acquire possession of the soil, and special induce
ments have been offered to immigrants by the introduction of new forms
of tenure on easy terms and conditions. Postal services have been ex-
tended throughout the settled portions of the land. Free schools have
been established and are maintained in all the States. Thoroughbred
live stock have been imported for the purpose of improving the Aus-
tralian breeds. Agricultural colleges, experimental farms, and technical
schools have been established. Money is advanced to settlers by the State
Governments to assist them in the construction of improvements and in
developing their selections. Instruction and advice is given to farmers,
dairymen, fruitgrowers, and stock breeders in the best methods of con-
ducting their several businesses. It, is recognised that the present popu-
lation of less than 4j- millions is inadequate, hence the desire on the part
of the Government to secure desirable immigrants, who, while assisting
in the development of the Commonwealth, may participate in its
benefits.


DENSITY OF POPULATION THROUGHOUT THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA
ACCORDING TO CENSES OF 1901
This map furnishes a graphic representation of the distribution of the population of the Com-
monwealth at the date of the. last Census, 1901. For this purpose the density of the population of
variously constituted districts in each state has been computed, and the areas representing these
has been shaded in accordance, with the scale, of density given at the foot of the map. The dis-
Inets dealt with in the several States are as follows: -New South Walls, Counties; Victoria,
Counties; Queensland. Census Districts ; South Australia, Counties; Western Australia,
Magisterial Districts; Tasmania, Electoral Districts.
This map must he considered, as furnishing only a rough approximation to the true distri-
bution of the population, owing to the, fact that a small densely populated area may exist in
certain cases within a comparatively largo district, the balance of which is sparsely populated.
Thus, in such a case, owing to the density of the whole being alone taken into account, the fact of
a concentration of population within a small area is lost for purposes of representation.

III.—THE AUSTRALIAN PEOPLE.
The population of the Commonwealth taken at the last census on the
31st March, 1901, was 3,773,801, exclusive of aborigines, the estimated
population at the end of 1907 being 4,197,037.
The density of the population—that is to say, the distribution of the
people per square-mile of country —is shewn on the map on the opposite
page. It will be seen that practically the only
districts which may be considered as at all
well populated are comprised in a fringe of

country near the coast. The area of the Commonwealth being 2,974,581
square miles, and the population 4,197,022, the average density is only 1.41
persons to the square mile, and Australia is, therefore, the most sparsely
populated of the civilised countries of the world. For other continents the
densities are approximately as follows : —Europe, 100 ; Asia, 49 ; Africa,
15 ; and America, 9. The densities of the populations for the latest dates
available of some of the principal countries in the world are given in the
following table:
At the end of the year 1800 the population—excluding aboriginal
natives—of what is now the Commonwealth was 5217. At the end of
1900 it was 3,765,339, shewing the gain dur-
ing the 19th century to have been over 3
millions in an original population of a little

over 5200. The population at periods of twenty years since 1800 was as
follows:

It may be seen from the figures given above that the increase in
population has been of fairly rapid growth; nevertheless it is still very
small in relation to the total area, to the national needs of the country,
and to the generally prosperous conditions of Australia.

The greater part of Australia was originally occupied by a number
of aboriginal tribes, who lived in distinct communities, each restricted to
its own territory. Although they were expert
fishers and hunters, and although they shewed
remarkable skill in some directions—more
THE ABORIGINES.
especially in the use of implements of war and chase —no traces of an
agricultural instinct have ever been discovered in them. As regards their
laws, habits, customs, and language, the tribes were very diverse. Since
the advent of the white man, the natives have gradually decreased in
number, and, although it is now only 138 years since Captain Cook
landed, they have been practically submerged by the wave of civilisation
which has spread over the country, notwithstanding the many attempts
which have been made by the States, as well as by private individuals,
to regulate their lives and to promote their welfare.
Naturally, no proper census of the aboriginals exists, but at the last
census, in 1901, the number of full-blooded aboriginals and nomadic
half-castes living with those of full blood remaining in New South Wales
was 4287, while in Victoria the total was only 271, and in Tasmania the
last full-blooded aboriginal native died in 1876. In the less settled parts
of Queensland, South Australia, and Western Australia, on the other
hand, there are considerable numbers of natives still in the “savage”
state. The total number of aboriginal natives enumerated at the census
of 1901 was 41,389, of which 22,712 were males and 18,677 females.
The total number of aboriginal natives at present in Australia has been
roughly estimated at 150,000.
The population of each State, both male,
female, and total, at the end of the year 1907,
was as follows :

periods since 1861 was as follows :
During the period 1861 to 1907 the gain to the Commonwealth
population by excess of arrivals over departures was, therefore, 784,982
persons, while the gain by excess of births over deaths for the same
period was 2,266,455 ; that is, nearly 26 per cent, of the increase was
due to “net immigration” and 74 jser cent, to “natural increase.”
That Australia is one of the healthiest countries in the world is
shewn by its low death rate, which in 1906 was only 10.85 per 1000 of
the population. Its enviable position in this
respect —a position only surpassed by that of
New Zealand —as compared with other coun-
tries, will he seen from the following table,

PEOPLE.
which gives the information for the latest available dates :


The smallness of the Australian death rale is doubtless duo to
some extent to Ihe comparalively few persons of very advanced age con-
tained in the population, but, even after making due allowance lor this
fact, (he rate furnishes indisputable evidence of a healthy condition of
the, people, which is no doubt due largely to the splendid climate, the
dry air and sunshine enjoyed during the greater part of the year, to the
absence of intense aggregation and overcrowding of the population, and
to the small amount of extreme poverty. In Australia there are no
endemic diseases. In the early days, with their careless ideas of sanita-
tion. typhoid and diphtheria were introduced, but, with (he general
improvement in the sanitary arrangements of the towns, the number of
eases has gradually decreased. Small-pox, Asiatic cholera, and other
• loudly diseases are quite unknown.

IV.—CLIMATE.
Australia presents in climate, soil, and season, a very wide range for
choice to those who may desire to become colonists. As the south of
Tasmania is in a latitude corresponding roughly to that of the south of
France, or of New York, in the northern hemisphere, while the northern
extremity of the Australian continent corresponds to the south of India or
Ceylon, it is obvious that the Commonwealth must have a great variety
of climatic conditions. Its climates, in fact, range from tropical to
temperate, missing, however, both the extremes of the tropical and the
frigid zones.
Australia may generally be divided roughly into three belts or zones,
marked by broad climatic differences, which are, perhaps, more noticeable
in the productions of the orchards than in any
other of the fruits of the soil. In the southern
belt —comprising Tasmania, the greater part
CLIMATIC ZONES.
of Victoria, and considerable parts of Xew South Wales, South Australia,
and Western Australia —the climate is similar in many respects to that of
the south of France or the north of Italy. In these lands are the farms
and the wheatfields, and the apple, pear, plum, and cherry grow to per-
fection. In the south of Victoria the thermometer rises above 100° in the
shade on the average on five days during the year, and generally on about
three nights during the year it falls to about two or three degrees below
freezing point. 'The middle belt —comprising parts of all the continental
States —was, in the early days, with the exception of the coastal districts,
devoted almost entirely to sheep stations, and is the natural home of the
peach, grape, fig, and olive; while in the northern belt—comprising the
Northern Territory and the northern parts of Queensland and Western
Australia--the mango, pineapple, cocoanut, and banana flourish, the
inland districts being mainly occupied by cattle runs. Even to these
broad climatic zones there are numerous exceptions. The farms and
wheatfields of the southern belt stretch north through Xew South Wales
to the plateaux and coastal districts of Queensland, and even in the far
north dairying is a profitable industry. Again, the sugar plantations
and other sub-tropical vegetation come down from the northern belt and
blend with the vegetation of the middle belt.
By reason of its insular geographical position and the absence of
striking physical features, Australia is far less subject to extremes of
weather than are regions of similar area in
other parts of the globe, and, latitude for
latitude, Australia is far more temperate.
Thus, in parts of Europe, Asia, and North

is no less than 171°, and in North America 153°, or, say, about double the
Australian range, which is only about 81°. Thus it is that in hardly any
of the great farming districts of Australia is it necessary to house live
stock, while people live comfortably in cheaply-constructed houses which
would be considered almost uninhabitable in countries where the climate
is rigorous.
For the purpose of comparison the fallowing table of temperatures is
given for the capital towns of the Australian States and for various
important cities throughout the world: —
The range of summer and winter temperatures in Australia, as in
other countries, increases with increasing distance from the coast, but
even in the interior, where the heat is greatest, the nights are cool, and
the extreme dryness of the air renders the heat easily bearable and very
healthy.

The'average annual rainfall varies from about five inches in the Lake
Eyre District to about 145 inches at Geraldton, in Queensland. Its general
distribution is best seen from the map on
page 16, shewing the areas subject to average
annual rainfalls lying between certain limits.
RAINFALL.
The following table of average annual rainfalls is given for the purposes
of comparison:—
Though much has been said and written about the recurrence and
the evil effects of droughts in Australia in past years, when the agricul-
turists suffered loss chiefly in consequence of
their having been too speculative and not
sufficiently provident, the beneficial influences
DROUGHTS.
of the droughts have been to a large extent overlooked. In nearly all
countries in the Northern Hemisphere the harvesting of crops for fodder
has to be undertaken every year, so that the stock may be fed during the
winter months, when the soil is resting and regaining its fertility and
chemical constituents. In Australia the droughts will probably ever
remain, but, with reasonable care and the proper conservation of water
and of fodder under the hands of the experienced agriculturist in the
years when there is a superabundance of rain and herbage, they will be
looked upon in future days as by no means evils with no redeeming
features, but rather as one of the provisions by which nature enables the soil
to re-establish those properties which have been exhausted during a suc-
cession of bountiful seasons. The beneficial effect of resting the soil in
times of drought is shewn by the extraordinarily rapid recovery, by the
increased fertility, and by the abundance of the harvests in the seasons
immediately following the droughts.


RAINFALL OF AUSTRALIA.
The above map has been prepared from a chart shewing the isohyets (curves of equal mean
annual rainfall) for every 10 inches for Australia, and compiled from the most recent information.
It was impracticable, on the small scale map to distinguish between the areas with 40 to 50, 50 to
60, 60 to 70, and over 70 inches of rain annually.

2.—AGRICULTURE.
Although Australia is pre-eminently a pastoral country, the value
of the return from its flocks and herds far exceeding that from any
other industry, nevertheless, as the above figures shew, the agricultural
industry is of considerable importance, and, judging by the advance in
recent years, bids fair to occupy a still more distinguished place as a
factor in Australian wealth.
The progress of agriculture at various intervals since 1880, and
during the last six years, appears below.
The figures quoted are exclusive of lands
under permanent artificially-sown grasses: —
AREA UNDER CROP.
During the period of twenty-six years shewn in the table the area
under crop has increased by over 100 per cent. The great extent of the
Commonwealth permits of an almost unlimited range in the variety of its
products. A summary of the acreage under the principal crops is given
in the next table :

of this trade during the last six years is shewn hereunder.
Competent authorities have pronounced Australian wheat to be
second to none in the world. In brightness and hardness of grain, in
milling qualities, and in the whiteness of its flour, it stands unequalled.
At present, it is not quite equal in the quality known by bakers as
“strength’’ to some of the Canadian flours, but here the experimentalist

is coming to our aid, and it is believed that ere long an Australian wheat
will be produced as near perfection as could be desired. The excellence
of the grain is attested by the high price realised for it in the British
markets, as compared with wheats from other countries.
The only other cereal crops grown to any extent in Australia are oats,
barley, and maize. In the table hereunder
will be found the area and production returns
for these crops during the period 1901-6 ;
OATS, BARLEY, AND MAIZE.
Oats and barley are grown throughout Australia, although Queens-
land grows very little oats, and only about 1000 acres are under barley
in Western Australia. The warm, humid climate of the coastal districts
of Now South Wales and Queensland is admirably adapted to the growth
of maize, while very heavy yields are also obtained in selected districts
in Victoria. There is ample room for the extension of cultivation of
these crops, and particularly of malting barley, for during the last five
vears the annual import of malt into (lie Commonwealth averaged

Xext to wheat, the hay crop is the most important in the Common-
wealth. In other countries the hay is principally made of various
grasses, but here it is found very profitable
to use wheat and oats for hay-making. Har-
ley is also used to a less extent, and in Xew

South Wales and Queensland excellent hay is made from lucerne. The
acreage and yield of hay at various periods since 3SO I are shewn in the
table hereunder: —
Hoot and tuber crops of all sorts thrive excellently in the Common-
wealth, but potatoes and onions are the most
important of this class grown. The progress
of potato cultivation is shewn hereunder; —
ROOT AND TUBER CROPS.
The other root crops grown comprise onions, mangolds, beet, turnips,
and sweet potatoes. Experiments have demonstrated that sugar beets of
a high saccharine percentage can be grown in Xew South Wales and
Victoria, but, in view of the success of the cane-sugar industry, it
is not likely that much will be done in this direction at the present
time.
Owing to the strides made by the dairying industry in the Common-
wealth, it is only natural to expect that there
would have been a considerable increase in
the area under artificially-sown grasses and
green forage. The progress in this direction

The grape vine flourishes in all the States on the mainland of
Australia, but wine-growing is carried on
most extensively in South Australia and
Victoria. Figures illustrating the progress

of the viticultural industry are shewn hereunder: —
The raisins and currants referred to in the above table were grown
in Victoria and South Australia.
Despite the fact that Australia produces wines of excellent quality,
many of which have obtained medals and certificates at foreign exhibi-
tions, the industry has not achieved the success which it deserves. This
is due to a variety of causes. In the first place, Australians do not use
■wine as a beverage to any great extent, and consequently the local
market is limited. Entry into British or foreign markets is rendered
difficult by the circumstance that the new and comparatively unknown
wines of Australia have to compete with well-known brands. Further,
the Australian vigneron, instead of using distinctive names for his wine,
has adopted foreign names, which in many instances tends to confusion,
since the Australian wine, while being of fine body and flavour, is very
often quite different from its prototype.
The value of the oversea imports and exports of wine is shewn here-
under :
The sparkling wine included amongst the exports is mainly foreign
wine re-exported.

Although, as will appear from the above figures, the Australian wine
trade can hardly be regarded as satisfactory, it is pleasing to note the
rapidly-growing demand for locally-dried raisins and currants, the raisins
especially having, to a large extent, displaced the imported article.
Sugar cane is grown in Queensland and New South Walt's, the area
under crop in the former State being naturally
by far the more extensive. The area and
yield for the Commonwealth during the last

six years were as follows:

Notwithstanding the increase in production, there is still a fairly
extensive import trade, the principal countries from which supplies are
obtained being Java, Mauritius, and Fiji, The total net import in JOOO
amounted to 054,4-17 cwt, valued at £291),450.
Space will permit only of the briefest reference to the wonderful
variety of fruits which the Commonwealth is capable of producing. For
example, in Queensland excellent pineapples,

other tropical fruits can be grown; in Tas-

mania apples, cherries, raspberries, strawberries, ami all fruits which
prefer a cool climate thrive to perfection. During the last six years the


value o£ the exports of fresh fruits from the Commonwealth averaged over
,£195,000 per annum, apples forming the chief item in the list. That the
fruit-growing Industry is susceptible of considerable extension is evidenced
by the fact that in 190(5 there was an import of fresh fruit to the value of

A52,(i55, while nearly X 138,000 worth of (hied fruit was imported. At
the latest available dale, the area under orchards and fruit gardens in the
Commonwealth was about 102,000 acres.
Amongst the minor crops grown in the Commonwealth may be
enumerated tobacco, hops, grass-seed, millet, cotton, coffee, arrowroot,
rhubarb, and various gourd crops. Experimental cultivation has proved
also that dates and rice will flourish. Olives of excellent quality can be
grown in South Australia.
In the territory of Papua, transferred to the control of the Common-
wealth in February, 1905, there are considerable areas of rich agricultural
land which may be acquired on very easy terms by settlers. The most
reliable and lucrative plantation industries arc para rubber and cocoa-
nuts, but all sorts of tropical fruits, fibres, and spices, in addition to
many valuable drug-yielding plants, have been proved to thrive to
perfection.

3.—THE PASTORAL INDUSTRY.
As shewn in the opening paragraph of this section, the pastoral
industry is by far the most important of the productive industries of the
Commonwealth. During 100(i the total value of the yield from all indus-
tries was about 117 millions sterling, and of this sum 45 millions, or
over 30 per cent., was contributed by the pastoral industry. Wool, of
course, was the main factor in this yield. The qualities of Australian
wool are well known, and are evidenced in the prices paid for it by
British and foreign purchasers.
The production of wool, stated as in the
grease, is given below for the last six
years :-
WOO!..
The sharp decline in the production during the years 1002 and 1903
was due to bad seasons, but the great recovery which has since taken
place shows unmistakably the wonderful recuperative powers possessed
by the Commonwealth.

of very favourable seasons has brought the total up to about 84 millions.
The table hereunder shews the number of sheep in Australia at various
intervals since 1860 :
The fact cannot be gainsaid that the methods adopted by the great
majority of pastoralists were until quite recently of a somewhat happy-
go-lucky description, for comparatively little provision was made in the
way of effective water conservation or accumulation of stocks of fodder to
tide over the lean years. Too much reliance was placed on the well-
known recuperative powers of the country, but, happily, it has come to
be recognised that the policy of simply letting the good years pay for
losses incurred in bad seasons is, apart from its cruel indifference to
animal life, uneconomic. Tor some time past great and increasing-
attention has been paid to the question of combating years of drought
by means of extensive water conservation and storage of fodder in the
shape of hay and ensilage, and every year sees the Australian
better prepared to cope with the vagaries of the season.
The Commonwealth conducts a large and rapidly-increasing trade
in frozen mutton and lamb, the exports
during the last two years amounting to over
£1,000,000. A statement of the trade since
FROZEN MEAT FOR EXPORT.
1901 is appended ;
The total export for the six years shewn above was £4,626,000, and
of this £3,133,000 was taken by the United Kingdom. It is, perhaps,
needless to remark that. Australia in the size of its sheep flocks and
general value of its production from the sheep-breeding industry far
exceeds any other country in the w r orld. The sheep flocks of Australia
in 1906 numbered 84 millions, the only other countries which approached
these figures being the Argentine Republic, with 74 millions, and Russia,
65 millions.

4.— DAIRYING, POULTRY AND BEE FARMING.
During the last twenty or thirty years dairying has made great
strides in the Commonwealth. This rapid development is due to a
variety of causes. In the first place it may be noted that the Australian
climate is so mild that, excepting very few regions, stock thrive out of
doors all the year round. The dairy-farmer is, therefore, not under the
expense of providing stall accommodation for his herd during the winter,
while stall-feeding is in most places unknown. Any winter fodder
required in Australia is as a rule simply given to the cattle in the fields.
In some cases clumps of shelter trees are grown for the protection of the
stock, while other farmers rug their cows during the colder months, as it
has been found that the practice results in an improved milk yield.
The old-fashioned idea that heavily-grassed country was alone
suitable for dairy stock has been abandoned in Australia, for it is found
that dairying pays well on very lightly-
grassed country. With the introduction of
the cream separator and the spread of the

factory system tlie industry has advanced rapidly, so that at the present

almost entirely to dairying. When Captain Phillip established (he
settlement at Sydney in .1 788 the live stock consisted of one hull, four
cows, one calf, and seven pigs. At the end ol IUO6 the dairy herds ol
the Commonwealth numbered 1,311,835, the total number of all cattle
being about 9,350,000. The number of dairy cattle in the Common-
wealth at the end of each of the last six years was as follows :■

position will be still more secure. The following table will give some
idea of the magnitude of the export trade in milk products:—
The chief trade is, of course, confined to butter. Although cheese
and preserved milk of fine quality are produced locally, the Common-
wealth still imports annually a small quantity of cheese, while the im-
portations of concentrated and preserved milk in 1906 were as high as
£189,000.
Pig-breeding is carried on principally in conjunction with dairying,
but the industry has by no means received the attention which, economic-
ally, it deserves. The number of pigs in the
Commonwealth fluctuates considerably, the
figures in 1861 being 319,147; in 1881,
BACON AM) MAM.
703,188; in 1901, 931,309; and in 1906, 813,509.
The production of bacon and ham during each of the last six years
is shewn in the following table: —
The oversea trade in pig products is at present small, and susceptible
of considerable expansion. During 1906 the net oversea export of frozen
pork was about £57,000, of bacon and ham £ll,OOO, and lard £7OOO.
Poultry-farming has only recently attained any importance amongst
the industries of the Commonwealth, and the returns relating to it are so
incomplete that any estimate of the value of
the production therefrom is at best very un-
certain. In the earlier years it is to be feared

that owing to imperfect management the aggregate output represented
little more than cost of production. Better methods are, however, now
in vogue, and Government experts in all the States give instruction in

private persons are engaged in breeding the best type of bird for Laying

some importance amongst Commonwealth sources of production. At the
present time, so far as eggs and live poultry are concerned, the balance
of trade is against the Commonwealth. There is, however, a fairly con-
siderable, though fluctuating export trade in frozen poultry, the returns
for the latest available six years being shewn below :
Bee-farming, like poultry-raising, has generally been carried on in
conjunction with other industries, few persons devoting their attention to
apiculture alone. Returns of production arc
available for three States only, the figures for
the years 1905 to 1907 being as follows :
BEE-FARMING.
Both honey and wax are produced in sulficient quantities to supply
local requirements, while a fair quantity of each is exported oversea.
During the last five years the average quantity of honey sent oversea was
71,000 lbs., and of beeswax 58,000 lbs.
5.—FORESTS.
It has been estimated that the forests of the Commonwealth
cover about 107 million acres, or 5.02 per cent, of the total ax - ea,
while the area specially reserved for timber is 15,308,000 acres, or 0.81
per cent, of the total. Special areas have been set apart in all the States
as “ State forests” or “ timber reserves,” the reservation being made in
perpetuity in some cases, in others for a definite period, while in some
instances the reservation may be cancelled at any time. The present
abundant natural supplies are in most of the States supplemented by the

establishment of forest nurseries and plantations. Limits of space pre-
clude more than a passing reference to the number and variety of the
forest timbers of Australia. It may be remarked en paxsant that the
Australian forest is not always “a continuous assemblage of mournful-
looking gum trees” as his been sometimes supposed, for the beauty
and diversity of bush and undergrowth in many parts of the coastal
jungles is often very striking. Amongst hardwood timbers the various
species of eucalyptus, popularly known as ironbarks, are very highly
prized for all work requiring great strength and durability. Builders
prefer ironbark girders in many eases to those made of steel or iron.

for the ironbark does not bum easily, nor does it bend or buckle
with heat. Large quantities of other species of eucalyptus are used
locally, as well as exported abroad, for wood-paving, such as jarrah
(IC. manjinata), karri {E. diversicolor), Murray red gum (IC. rust rata), etc.
The stringy barks and the turpentine ( Syncarpia Inurifolia) are valu-
able timbers for whaives and bridges. There are vast numbers of
other “gums,” boxes, and “mahoganies,” all of greater or less value
for industrial purposes. Then there are the pines of various sorts, which
give valuable timber for ceilings, box-making, etc. Amongst furniture
and cabinet-making timbers may be included red cedar ( Cedrela aus-
tralis), a beautifully-marked and easily-worked timber, rosewood, white
beech, silky oak, tulip wood, red bean, figured blackwood, and hosts of
others. Sandalwood in considerable quantities has been exported from
the Commonwealth for over half a century.

6.—FISHERIES.
Numerous varieties of valuable food fishes abound in the coastal
waters of Australia, while the freshwater rivers and lakes yield abundant
supplies both of natural and acclimatised species. The fishing industry
has not, however, developed to the extent it deserves. It has been said
that the Australians are not an “ichthyophagous race,” but the compara-
tively heavy import of dried and preserved fish appears to disprove the
statement. The natural explanation seems to be that the industry is ill-
managed —the consumer has to pay too much, while the fisherman re-
ceives too little; and the system of distribution of the catch is often lack-
ing in method and in daintiness. The Commonwealth Government
having recognised the possibilities of the industry, is making special
efforts to encourage its development, and considerable attention is being
given to it in some of the States.
To attempt anything like a complete account of the food fishes which
abound in Commonwealth waters is here out of the question. Amongst
sea varieties may be mentioned “snapper,” or
“schnapper,” which is taken by line in quanti-
ties off the coast of the mainland, and which is

reckoned amongst the finest edible fishes in the world. Then there are
hosts of others, such as whiting, mullet, trevally, sea perch, black and
red bream, sole, groper, rock cod, garfish, barracouta, trumpeter, flat-
head, sea carp, herring, etc. Amongst fresh-water fish may be enumerated
the Murray cod (which sometimes reaches a weight of over 50 lbs.),
perch, and mullet. Suitable streams on the mainland have been stocked
with English trout and other fish. The trout-fishing to be obtained in
Australia is said to be unsurpassed anywhere. Fine sport is also afforded
by the trout and salmon in the lakes and rivers of Tasmania. Lobsters,
shrimps, prawns, and edible oysters and other shell-fish are found in
abundance throughout the Commonwealth.
The Federal Government has taken in hand the conduct of
trawling experiments, and for that purpose has recently constructed
and equipped a steam trawler.
Pearlshell is obtained in Western Australia, Queensland, and the
Northern Territory, the two last-mentioned places also exporting fair
quantities of beche-de-mer and tortoiseshell.

That there is considerable room for development in the fishing
industry is evidenced by the fact that the average value of fish imported
into the Commonwealth during the last five years was £332,(100.
Fishermen from the United Kingdom have decided to commence a
curing and canning industry in New South Wales, and it is hoped that ere
long the undertaking will become of considerable magnitude.
7. — MINERAL WEALTH.
Although the annual return from the mining industry is now con-
siderably less than that yielded by the pastoral and manufacturing
industries, nevertheless it was the discovery of gold in 1851 that
attracted large bodies of population to Australia, and thus laid the
foundations of its nationhood. This question has been alluded to at
greater length elsewhere. It will be sufficient to note here that, while
the population of Australia in 1841 was only 221,000, the total had
increased to over 1,168,000 by the end of 1861. At the present time, in
the richness and variety of its mineral resources, Australia compares very
favourably with any other country in the world. What the future may
bring forth with respect to the development of the mineral industry it is
difficult to say; at all events, it is known that a large proportion of the
mineral-bearing areas have up to the present been merely scratched,

TIN DREDGING AT GREENBUSHES, WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
Preliminary returns give the production in 1907 as £15,535,000.
Including the value of gold taken away from Australia by successful
“ diggers” in early years, the amount of which was not in all cases
recorded, the total production up to the end of 1907 could not have been
far short of 500 millions sterling. Remarkable masses of gold have been
found in the Commonwealth at various times. The first “nugget” was
discovered at Hargraves, in New South Wales, in 1851, and weighed a
little over 1 lb. The Burrandong nugget, found near Orange in the
same year, weighed 2218 ozs., and the “Brennan” was sold in Sydney for
£115(1. The “Jubilee,” found in 1887, weighed 347 ozs. In Victoria a
nugget which -weighed 1(320 ozs. was found in 1853 at Canadian Gully.
The “ Welcome,” found near Ballarat in 1858, weighed 2217 ozs., while
the “ Welcome Stranger,” unearthed in 1869 near Dunolly, weighed
2280 ozs. Probably the largest mass of gold ever found was obtained at


Beyer’s and Holtermann’s claim at Hillend, New South Wales, in 1872.
The specimen was 4 ft. 9 in. high, 2 ft. 9 in. wide, and about 4 in. thick,
and contained only a comparatively small admixture of quartz. An offer
of £13,000 was refused for this prize when it was first exhibited. A
miner in Western Australia “dollied” out £15,000 worth of gold in 1890
from the cap of a reef on the Yalgoo field, and £20,000 worth was won
in a few days by the discoverer of the Wealth of Nations mine.
The Broken Hill silver field, the chief lode on which was discovered
in 1882, is one of the richest and most productive fields in the world.
The output of the various companies operating
on the field to the end of 1900 was valued at
£40,798,000, while the dividends and bonuses

copper produced in the Commonwealth was valued at £3,345,000. The
production from other metals is given in the table, but more extended
reference to them cannot be made here. It may be remarked, however,
that the small return from iron by no means represents the possibilities
of working the metal, as there are vast deposits of iron ore throughout
Australia which have never been touched.
Coal was discovered at a very early period in the history of Aus-
tralia, the first mention of it being made in 17D7, when its existence was
noted in New South Wales by some survivors
from the wreck of a vessel, who had walked
from the southern portion of Australia up the

tributed by New South Wales. In the Newcastle and Northern District
of this State is situated one of the most productive coalfields in the
world, the coal-bearing strata extending from the Newcastle Harbour to
a distance of about thirty miles inland, and containing practically inex-
haustible supplies of excellent coal. There are extensive deposits in the
Southern District, while the Western coalfields are in close proximity to
vast stores of limestone and high-grade iron ore. Victoria possesses
deposits of valuable black coal in addition to immense deposits of lignite
and brown coal, the beds in the Latrobe Valley being over 800 feet
in thickness. In the event of the application of a cheap and efficient
process of manufacturing fuel briquettes from the product, the value of
these vast accumulations of soft coal can hardly be over-estimated. Good
coal is also mined in Queensland, Western Australia, and Tasmania.
In view of the very great wealth in coal, iron, and limestone possessed by
the Commonwealth, its success as a manufacturing country should un-
doubtedly be assured.
The salt shewn in the table is produced principally from salterns in
South Australia and Victoria.
Gems are found throughout the Commonwealth, the most important
being opal, many beautiful varieties of which are found in New South Wales
and Queensland. The official returns by no
means adequately represent the total produc-
tion, as much of the opal raised is sold to
OEMS.
foreign buyers on the fields, and is not recorded. The same remark
applies in the case of diamonds.
8.—MANUFACTURING.
As shewn in the first paragraph of this section, the return from the
manufacturing industry in 1906 was a little over thirty-one millions
sterling, and represented about 21 per cent,
of the total value of Commonwealth produc-
tion. Owing to the changes in methods of
tabulating, accurate comparative statistics are

Unfortunately, the figures in the last three columns do not represent
complete results, as the information set out in the headings has hitherto
not been collected in all the States. Incomplete as the results are, they
nevertheless give evidence of material progress, for while, through
absorption of smaller establishments, the actual number of factories
shews a slight decrease, in other important respects there has been a
considerable improvement.
Some idea of the relative importance of the various classes of indus-
trial establishments in the Commonwealth may be obtained from the next
table, which shews the distribution of the returns for l!)0(i under similar

The progress of the dairying industry in the Commonwealth has

class is shewn hereunder :


The Commonwealth Government is making special efforts to
encourage the local manufacture of machinery, and particularly those
machines and implements used in connection with agriculture. More
extended reference to this subject will bo found in the pages of the
Commonwealth Official Year Book.
It is impossible within the limits of this pamphlet to present any-
thing like a complete account of the position and prospects of the manu-
facturing industry of Australia, but it is hoped that the brief resume
contained in this section will shew that solid progress has been made
during the last few years. The future of manufacturing here will, of
course, depend largely on the rate of increase of population, since the
ELECTRIC POWER STATION, TASMANIA.
present market is not sufficiently extensive to permit of the establishment
of those branches of industry which require an extensive sale in order
that they may be carried on at a profit. There can bo no doubt as
to the natural potentialities of the Commonwealth for manufacturing:
for of coal there is an inexhaustible supply, while the deposits of iron
ores and limestone have so far barely been touched. For years past
Australia has been the world’s greatest supplier of wool; we could, if
need be, produce in Queensland and the Northern Territory all the cotton
required in our local manufactures ; while the Commonwealth Possession
of Papua is capable of producing inexhaustible supplies of rubber and
other valuable tropical products.


VIII.—SETTLEMENT ON THE LAND.
The chief wants of Australia at the present time are firstly agricul-
tural settlers with small capital, w T ho will devote themselves whole-heartedly
to the development of its agricultural areas, and secondly other suitable
immigrants with health and willingness to work on the land, who will come
to the country and enter into the life of the Australian people with mutual
advantage. To such people Australia has to offer the choice of a variety of
soils and healthy climates in a country where the arduous work of the
pioneer has already been accomplished, and where a high state of modern
civilisation has been attained. In Australia, because land may be obtained
on such easy terms, a large proportion of the settlers own their own farms,
and any capable agricultural labourer may himself become an owner.
It may truly be said that no country in the world can offer greater
advantages to wdieat-growers, cattle-raisers, wool-growers, dairy-farmers,
fruit-growers, and for raising lambs for export.
Of the total area of the Commonwealth
namely 1,903,731,840 acres only about
87,250,000 acres, or about one-twentieth of
AREA AVAILABLE FOR
SETTLEMENT.
the whole area, have been alienated absolutely, that is to say, the freehold
has been sold or granted by the Crown outright. About 35,375,000 acres,
or one-fiftieth of the whole area, are in process of alienation, or, in other
words, are held by settlers who are purchasing the freehold of the land on
easy terms by the payment of a small sum annually for a period of years.
About 746,500,000 acres, or nearly two-fifths of the whole area, are let by
the Crown under leases or licenses to occupy for various periods, while the
remaining, 1,034,600,000 acres, or over one-half of the whole area, are
unoccupied.
Of the unoccupied lands large areas are already available for settle-
ment, while other areas are constantly being opened up by the Govern-
ments, whose policy it is to heartily encourage settlement on the land,
because a fertile soil and great natural resources are of no value unless
people are there to develop them. In all the States, also, what are called
Closer Settlement Acts have been passed. It has been found that the value
of the produce of a large estate, originally considered as being at its full
capacity, compares unfavourably with the returns which may be obtained
from the same area when subdivided and cultivated by settlers. Under the
Acts just mentioned the State Governments, therefore, repurchase large
estates which have in past years been alienated by the Crown, and by
cutting them up into areas of suitable size they are thrown open to settle-
ment on easy terms and conditions. The subdivision and sale of lands by


private owners is also going' on all over the country, but the terms offered
by such owners are not, as a rule, nearly so easy as those offered by the
Governments, which do not desire to make a profit, and which can insist on
the permanent occupation of the land by carefully chosen tenants.
The diagram given below shews the condition of the public estate in
the Commonwealth. The large square represents the total area of the
Commonwealth, while the relative areas of individual States are shewn by
the vertical rectangles. The areas alienated absolutely, in process of alien-
ation under systems of deferred payments, and the areas held under leases
or licenses are shewn by the differently shaded areas, as described in the
reference given below the diagram, while the areas unoccupied are left
unshaded-


It is not possible within the scope of this sketch to enter with any
degree of completeness into the different methods by which land may he
taken up in the several States. Though there
is a considerable similarity between the prin-
cipal forms of tenure in the States, the terms

and conditions vary very considerably in detail, and therefore a general

indication only of the most important systems will here he given. More
detailed accounts will he found in the “Commonwealth Year Book.”
Reliable information regarding the several States as to land available, price,
and conditions, as well as to numerous other matters of interest to the
settler, may he obtained from the Agents-General in London, or from the
Government Officers in Australia, whose names and addresses are given at
the beginning of this pamphlet, and to whom all intending emigrants
should apply.
In all the States, the freehold of the land may he acquired under what
are known as systems of conditional purchase by deferred payments; that
is to say, the settler may purchase the land by the payment of small half-
yearly instalments upon terms which are very liberal, viz.:—The settler
must reside upon his holding and must fulfil improvement conditions of the
lightest nature —conditions inserted simply to guarantee that the occupier
will become of benefit to the community by making a reasonable effort to
make his holding wealth-producing. The maximum area which a settler


may select in this manner varies from 200 to 2560 acres, according to the
situation and quality of the land. The purchase price ranges from ten
shillings an acre upwards, and the payment may he extended over a period
of from twenty to thirty-four years, the annual amount payable ranging
from sixpence an acre upwards. The selector must ordinarily reside on his
holding for at least five years, and must carry out certain prescribed im-
provements, such as clearing the land and enclosing it with a fence.
Friends or relations may take advantage of the co-operative or family
system of settlement, under which they may form a small community
amongst themselves, and while holding their land separately may assist one
another by the reciprocal use of implements and stock. Under the Closer
Settlements Acts, repurchased lands are from time to time divided into
allotments for farmers, for agricultural labourers, or for working-men’s
homes. They are thrown open to settlement under systems of conditional
purchase by deferred payment, but the land being already improved, the
price is usually larger than in the case of unimproved lands available for
THE “GORGE” LAUNCESTON, TASMANIA.
settlement. Under these Acts, and under the Small Holdings Acts, farm
labourers and working-men may acquire freehold property near the centres
of work, and money is advanced to them by tbe State Governments on easy
terms to assist them in building homes. Special areas are set apart for
orchards, vineyards, and gardens, while other areas are from time to time
specially reserved for selection by settlers from Great Britain.


Instead of selecting the land by conditional purchase, a settler may
purchase the land outright, or may obtain a lease for an indefinitely long
term —called a perpetual lease —upon payment of a small rent. Provision
has also been made for convenient forms of leases for various special pur-
poses, or for persons who require a considerable area for pastoral or agri-
cultural purposes.
In Western Australia free homestead farms of 160 acres are granted to
settlers upon residential and improvement conditions, and upon payment
of fees amounting to £4.
For the purpose of assisting settlers in erecting buildings and carrying
out improvements on their holdings, systems have been established in all
the Australian States, except Tasmania, under
which financial aid is rendered to settlers by
the State Governments. Though not yet
ADVANCES TO FARMERS.
adopted in Tasmania, the Government of that State lias in contemplation
the introduction of a system on similar lines to those followed in the other
States. The amounts advanced and the conditions regarding interest and
repayment differ somewhat in the several States. Generally, advances may
he obtained on freehold property or on conditional purchases for the purposes
(a) of paying off existing encumbrances, (h) of making improvements or of
developing the agricultural, pastoral, horticultural, or viticulture! resources
of the land, (c) of building homes on the land, or (d) for the purchase of stock,
machinery or implements. Loans, together with interest at not more than
5 per cent., are generally repayable by half-yearly instalments within 31 years.
To the end of the year 1907, the total amount of such advances was
£5,377,307, the balance due being £2,792,816. Special clauses are inserted
in many of the Closer Settlement and Small Holdings Acts, providing for
advances to persons taking up land under the Acts on similar lines and for
similar purposes to the above. By taking advantage of the opportunities
thus offered for borrowing money at a low rate of interest and repayable in
small instalments, many farmers have been able to make their holdings
wealth-producing at an early stage, when otherwise they would have had a
hard struggle to surmount the initial difficulties incidental to the cultivation
of virgin lands.
The Governments of some of the States have arranged to grant assist-
ance towards the payment of the passage money of persons desiring to
settle on the land or to engage in farm or dairy
work, or work of a similar nature, to domestic
servants, and to other persons who can satisfy
ASSISTED PASSAGES.
the Agents-General in London that they will make suitable settlers, to-
gether with their wives and families, if any. Arrangements have been made
with several of the best known and most up-to-date shipping companies for
special reductions to intending settlers, in addition to which the Government
contribution reduces the cost of the passage to the immigrant to so small an


amount as £7. Persons resident in Australia may nominate their relatives
or friends to come out by assisted passages. Immigrants have the choice
of travelling by any one of a number of fast and well-appointed steamships,
and the actual amount of passage money will, of course, depend upon the
class of accommodation required. Those who have availed themselves of
assisted or nominated passages are met on arrival by Government officers,
who make themselves acquainted with the needs of the passengers and help
them in every possible way. Special concessions may also be obtained by
immigrants in the way of railway fares and freights from the port of
arrival to the railway station nearest to their selection.

One of the most important considerations to the intending settler is
the question of selling his produce at a profit. Naturally, the market prices
fluctuate considerably from time to time. The
table below, however, gives a general idea of
the prices prevailing in Australia during the
year 1907 for various classes of produce and

in the markets of the six capital towns, and shew the minimum and maxi-
mum wholesale prices quoted, as well as the average prevailing wholesale

Another consideration of great importance to the intending settler is
the cost of getting his produce to market. In each State various descrip-
tions of goods are classified, and the freight is
charged according to classification. Both the
classification and the rates charged vary some-
what in the several States, but generally it

following table shews the minimum and maximum rates charged and
also the average rate, for various classes of goods. In preparing this table
the rates' charged in Tasmania have not been taken into account, the
distances in that State being but small: —
It may be seen from the above table that the principle which lias been
followed has been to diminish the rates rapidly in proportion to distance,
so as to enable distant areas to compete in the principal markets. Special
rates have been fixed in the interests of the producer for particular classes
or for small packages of produce. The producer also has the benefit of
reasonable rates in getting his implements, stock, and necessary commodi-
ties to his land.
The education of the farmers is a subject to which much attention is,
given by the State Governments, which have established five agricultural
colleges, where, for moderate fees, pupils
receive instruction in the theory and practice
of all branches of agriculture. There are also,
in various parts of the Commonwealth over

CULTURAL INFORMATION.
forty experimental farms, orchards, and vineyards, where the most
advanced and best methods of farming in all its branches are studied by
the Government authorities. Experts on dairying, on horticultural and
viticultural and other matters, are sent out to lecture in various country
districts and to give practical demonstrations. Advice is given to farmers
by means of the official Agricultural Journals, special bulletins, or by letter
when asked. There are also in practically all the settled districts, agricul-
tural and horticultural societies, and associations of farmers and stock-
breeders, having the one general aim of improving their methods of
business.
In Australia the position of the farm labourer and of other persons,
employed in agricultural and pastoral pursuits is much superior to what it
is in England, where they have but few chances
of improving their position. In the Common-

to time in different localities, according to the state of the labour market
and according to the prosperity of the seasons. The table given below has
been prepared from official returns, so as to give a general indication of the
ordinarily prevailing wages, and also the minimum and maximum wages,
paid in Australia during the year 1906. In addition to the rates shewn
below, board and lodging, or rations, are found: —
* It is believed that in cases of some of the highest rates neither board and lodging nor rations
are found.

IX.—TRANSPORT AND COMMUNICATION.
The people of Australia possess a valuable asset in the railway systems
which have been constructed throughout all the more settled parts of the
country. As these systems, with but few exceptions, belong to the State,
they can be devoted primarily to the development of the natural resources
of the country, and to the assistance of settlers in opening up new districts.
The principle adopted by the State Governments has not been to run the
railways solely as a commercial speculation, viz., to make the largest
possible profit, but has been to consider largely the development of the
country’s resources, to the maximum extent consistent with ensuring a
reasonable return from the railways as a whole, taking account of cost of
working and interest charges on capital expenditure.
As may be seen from the accompanying map, the eastern, south-
eastern, southern, and western parts of Australia are now equipped with a
considerable network of lines, providing means
for conveying the produce of the agricultural,
pastoral, and mining districts to the principal
RAILWAY SYSTEMS.
towns and ports. Wonderful progress has been made in the way of rail-
way development during the last fifty years. The first line was opened in
1856, and at the end of that year there were 16J miles in operation. In
1907 there were no less than 15,258 miles open for traffic, while there
were 692 i miles of line in course of construction. The main interstate
line, which permits of direct communication between the four capitals—
Brisbane, Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide —has a total length of 1790 i
miles. The journey from Brisbane to Adelaide occupies about three days,
including one stop of nearly nine hours at Sydney and another of nearly
four hours at Melbourne, while the longest railway journey which can be
undertaken in Australia on one continuous line is from Longreach, in
Queensland, to Oodnadatta, in South Australia, a total distance of 3303
miles. In Western Australia the railway systems, which connect the
principal coastal towns, and which run inland to the goldfields for nearly
600 miles, are not as yet connected, with the railways of the eastern States.
The Commonwealth Government has, however, recently voted the sum of
£20,000 for the survey of a line between Port Augusta, in South Australia,
and Kalgoorlie, on the Western Australian goldfields, and the work is to be
undertaken immediately.

The table given below shews the mileage of State-owned ami private
lines open for traffic on the 30th June, 1907. The greater part of the
private lines has been laid down for the pur-
pose of opening up forest lands or mining
districts, and is not generally used for the
conveyance of passengers or for public traffic.
MILEAGE OPEN FOR
TRAFFIC.
In each State of the Commonwealth the policy has now been established
that the railways should be kept under the control of the Government, and
this policy is adhered to, excepting in cases presenting unusual circum-
stances :
* Exclusive of lines engaged solely in haulage of timber and minerals.
In spite of the great extension of State-owned railways which has
taken place in recent years throughout the Commonweath, there are still
vast tracts of country into which lines have
not yet penetrated. As population increases
and funds are made available by Parliament,
the States are constantly providing increased

SETTLEMENT.
mileage to assist settlers in the cultivation of the soil, and to generally
foster the producing interests in places where there are reasonable
prospects of settlement and traffic being likely to follow. The lines now in
course of construction are chiefly of the“ pioneer” class, and are made with
a view to affording communication at moderate speeds to districts in which
the traffic would not warrant the expenditure necessary to provide
thoroughly equipped lines. As the traffic increases, the permanent way is
strengthened in order to allow the heavy types of rolling stock to run over
it. In this way feeders to the main line are built, so as to cover a great
area of country and thus open up large districts to settlement.
The particulars given below for the last finan-
cial year shew the large proportions which the
traffic on the Government lines has reached: —
A YEAR’S OPERATIONS.


Tlie above figures shew the gratifying results which have been
obtained by the States in carrying out their railway policies. Notwith-
standing the sparse population of Australia, her railways, which have cost
over £137,000,000, and have been constructed for developmental as well as

commercial reasons, shewed for the financial year 1906-7 net receipts equal
to 4.35 per cent, on the cost of construction and equipment. This defrays
all charges for interest on railway loans and leaves a profit of £992,947.
In the previous section on The Australian People, a statement will he
found to ttie effect that a considerable proportion of the population of
Australia live on a fringe of country near the
coast, hence it will he easily understood that
sea-borne traffic by coastal vessels plays an

important part in the transport of the country. At intervals along the
coast, rivers or harbours provide ports of call for the vessels, thus enabling
produce to he taken at a small cost to the various markets. On many
routes the passenger and goods traffic alone would not pay. A considerable
addition to the profits, however, is made by subsidies paid by the Govern-
ment for the regular conveyance of mails. The first regular coastal service
was started in 1842, while others shortly followed. From the start success
attended these enterprises, and the services thus initiated were rapidly
extended and their operations broadened. At the end of the year 1906, the


eleven largest of the coastal shipping companies owned 122 steamships
engaged in regular coastal and interstate services, having a gross tonnage of
207,320, the aggregate indicated horse-power being 149,345. The total
passenger accommodation of these vessels was 11,983, and the total num-
ber of crew employed was 4142. Though this shipping carries goods from
port to port within the Commonwealth, and is called coasting, the word by
no means expresses all that is meant to he conveyed, many of the vessels
being magnificent and fast modern ocean-going steamships, ranging up to
nearly 7000 tons gross tonnage.
The postal service of the Commonwealth extends to all the settled
parts of the country, and postal facilities are furnished to new settlements
as soon as they are formed. At the end of the
year 1906 there were 5256 post offices in the
Commonwealth, being an increase of sixty-

eight over the number for the previous year. This shews that new post-
offices were being established at the rate of nearly six a month. During
the year 190(i there were 317,119,000 letters and postcards, or seventy-

five per head of the population, dealt with at the Australian post offices,
shewing an increase of about 10 and 7 per cent, respectively on the
corresponding figures for previous years. The postal rates in Australia are
low, and compare favourably with those in other countries.


Facilities are provided by the Post office for the transmission of money
by means of money orders and postal notes. A money order, which may
be issued for payment either within the Com-
monwealth or abroad, may not be granted for
a larger sum than £2O, nor a postal note,
which is payable only within the Common-

despatched at all post offices. During the year 1906 money orders to the
value of over £5,000,000 were issued, the value of postal notes sold
being £2,081,533. The rates of commission charged on money orders are
low, and vary according to the value of the order and to the place in which
they are payable. Rates of poundage on postal notes are also low.

Australia is well supplied with telegraph and telephone systems, both
of which are owned and operated by the Commonwealth Government.
The total length of telegraph lines, exclusive of
railway telegraphs, available for use in 1906
was 43,674 miles, the corresponding length of
telegraph wire being 134,649 miles. In the

same year there were over 10 million telegrams, exclusive of cablegrams,
dealt with by the Postal Department. The telephone system is largely
utilised throughout the more densely populated parts of Australia, and is
being extended in the rural districts, so that the farmers may benefit by
being kept in close touch with the markets. At the end of the year 1906,
there were nearly 80,000 miles of telephone wire, exclusive of telegraph and
railway telephone wire, available for use, the number of telephone connec-
tions being 38,152.

X.—THE TRADE OF THE COMMONWEALTH.
Relatively to population, the Commonwealth of Australia occupies a
high position amongst the trading countries of the world, as the following
table will shew. The figures given therein
represent, for the countries indicated, the im-
ports for home consumption and the exports
of domestic produce (including bullion and

specie) for the year 1906 in the case of the first five countries, and in the
others for the year ended December, 1905 :
From the figures just given it will be seen that in total trade per head
of population the Commonwealth occupies fourth place on the list, while,
if allowance be made for the transit trade of Belgium and Switzerland, its
position would doubtless be still higher.
The following table shews the growth of the
trade of the Commonwealth at quinquennial
periods since 1886 :

During the earlier years shewn in the preceding table, i.e., up to the
end of 1891, the balance of trade was in favour of imports, hut from 1892
onwards the reverse lias been the case. The increase in value of imports
during the whole period dealt with is equivalent to an annual rate of 1.36
per cent., whereas the exports increased at an annual average of 6.01 per
cent, per annum.
The total value of imports during 1906 was £44,741,912, and the value
per inhabitant was £lO 19s. The following table shews the average

As the figures shew, the proportion of imports from the United
Kingdom is now considerably smaller than it was during the first quin-
quennium, while imports from foreign countries largely increased during
the period covered by the table. It would be erroneous, however, to con-
clude that there has been a marked diversion of trade from the United
Kingdom to foreign countries to the full extent of the figures indicated
above, for inquiry reveals that such has not been the case. The subject is
discussed at some length on pp. 516-522 of the first “Official Year Book of
the Commonwealth.”
The imports into the Commonwealth during
the year 1906 may be classified under the
following headings :
CLASSIFICATION OF IMPORTS.
For detailed reference to the imports from each country, the reader
is referred to the chapter on Commerce in the ‘ Commonwealth Official
Year Book.” Space will permit of only the
more important items from the chief countries
being mentioned here. For the year 190(5
these were as follows;

The figures given refer to imports according to country of shipment.
Imports according to country of origin in some cases give widely different
results. {Vide table on p. 499, “ Commonwealth Official Year Book.”)
The total value of exports during 1906 was £69,737,763, and the value
per inhabitant was £l7 Is. sd. The average annual value of exports to
principal countries for each of the quinquen-
nial periods 1887-91 and 1902-6, and also the
increase or decrease in such values, are given

Exports in proportion to population have a larger value in Australia
than in any other country in the world, except New Zealand. The com-
parison with other countries is instructive, and may be seen from the
following diagram :
VALUE OF EXPORTS PER INHABITANT, AUSTRALIA AND OTHER
COUNTRIES.
As was the case in regard to imports, so with exports, the space avail-
able permits only of reference to the more
important articles sent to the chief countries.

It has been urged that the Commonwealth tariff is an unduly restric-
tive one, but comparison with other countries
will show that this is not the case. In the
table below will be found comparisons with
Canada, New Zealand, and the United States
of America:—
THE COMMONWEALTH
TARIFF.
The above figures clearly show that, excluding alcoholic liquors and
tobacco, the equivalent ad valorem rate of duty in Australia was much
below the average of the other countries named.
Reference has already been made above (see p. 58) to the interstate
and coastal steamship services between ports in the Commonwealth.

CIRCULAR QUAY, SYDNEY, FROM DAWES POINT.
From the figures above it may be seen that the shipping business of
the ports of Sydney and Melbourne is only exceeded by that of four ports
in the United Kingdom, viz., London, Liverpool, Cardiff, and Newcastle.
The tonnage of vessels owned in Australia has rapidly increased, and
in 1906 there were 367,030 tons (net) of shipping on the registry books of
various ports in the Commonwealth.
The ship-building industry has been established in Australia for some
years, though it cannot he said to have been developed in the past with any
degree of rapidity. Plans are, however, projected for the building of new
yards, and with the development of the iron industry, now established at
Lithgow in New South Wales, for the manufacture of pig iron and steel,
there is every prospect of a marked development of ship-building in Aus-
tralia in the near future.


XI.—COMMONWEALTH AND STATE FINANCE.
A more adequate account of the finances of the Commonwealth as a
whole, and of the States as component parts thereof, is given in the
chapters on Commonwealth and State Finance, in the first issue of the
Commonwealth Official Year Book” (see pp. 638 et seq.)
Under the Constitution, the Federal Government can alone impose
duties of Customs and Excise, State powers in this respect having passed
to the Commonwealth on its inauguration.
The Constitution also confers on the Federal
Government the power to make laws regarding
other forms of taxation, but up to the present
COMMONWEALTH
REVENUE.
this power has not been utilised. Customs and Excise receipts constitute,
therefore, the major portion of the Federal Treasurer’s revenue, but there
are, in addition, revenues from services transferred from State to Common-
wealth control. The revenue from all sources for the financial year 1906-7
was £12,832,891, of which Customs and Excise yielded over 91 millions,
while postal receipts accounted for about 3 millions. Patents and Trade
Marks furnished together a sum of about £24,000. Per head of population
the total receipts amounted to £3 2s. 3d.
At the outset, it may be noted that up to the present the Commonwealth
Government has not raised any loans. The disbursement by the Common-
wealth Treasurer of the revenues collected falls
naturally,under the “book-keeping” system (see
sections 89 and 93 Commonwealth Constitution
Act), into three divisions : (l) Expenditure on
COMMONWEALTH
EXPENDITURE.
transferred services; (2) expenditure on new services; (3) payment to
States of surplus revenue. Of these three, the first two are actual expendi-
ture,'while the third item is merely a transfer, the actual expenditure being
incurred by the States. In accordance with the provisions of the Consti-
tution, the expenditure on transferred services is debited to the several
States in respect of which such expenditure has been incurred, while the
expenditure on new services is distributed “ per capita.” Surplus Common-
wealth revenue is paid to the States monthly. Until the end of the year
1903-4, new works, etc., for transferred departments were treated as trans-
ferred expenditure, and were charged to the States on whose behalf the
expenditure had been incurred. In subsequent years, all such expenditure
has been regarded as expenditure on new services, and has been distributed
amongst the States “per capita.” The expenditure by the Commonwealth
Government for the financial year ended 30th June, 1907, was £4,987,317.
Of this total the transferred expenditure amounted to about 3f millions;
ordinary expenditure absorbed £764,000, while about £472,000 was spent on

total expenditure averaged £1 4s. 3d. Under sections 87, 93 and 95, the
Constitution provides for the payment to the States of all surplus Common-
wealth revenue, such payment to amount in the aggregate to not less than
three-fourths of the net revenue from Customs and Excise during a period
of ten years after the establishment of the Commonwealth.
The table hereunder gives a comparison of the surplus revenue actually
paid to the several States since the inauguration of the Commonwealth,
together with the statutory three-fourths of net Customs and Excise revenue
for the same period:—
The table also shews the amount paid to the States out of the one-
fourth retainable by the Commonwealth. For the period covered by the
figures this amounted in all to £5,728,349.

monwealth service during the year 1906-7 is

It is impossible to draw any hard and fast deductions from mere con-
sideration of the actual totals of revenue and expenditure of the States as
compared with similar figures for other coun-
tries. In the first place, the functions of

themselves, while they differ widely with those in force elsewhere. The


railway and tramway services may lie cited as a very important example
in illustration of the truth of the latter portion of the preceding sentence.
In other countries these services are chiefly in private hands, while practi-
cally the whole of the railways and many of the tramways of Australia have
been built and are controlled hy the State Governments. It is on this fact,
moreover, that a good deal of outside criticism of Australia’s loan indebted-
ness is shattered, for, as will be shewn later on, the bulk of the loans has been
raised in connection with these railway services, which not only constitute
an excellent set-off against the corpus of the debt, hut were absolutely
essential to the development of the country. Australia, it must he remem-

section could never have been achieved.

As the figures shew, practically half the entire revenue was obtained
from public works and services. The chief items in this category are given
hereunder; —
A scrutiny of the above figures compared with those in the preceding
table shews what an important place is occupied by the railway and tram-
way services in the list of sources of State revenues.
The land revenue of the States is obtained from sales and rental of the
public lands, the amounts from each source being practically identical in
the aggregate during the year 1906-7.
As explained previously, the power to impose duties of Customs and
Excise now rests solely with the Commonwealth, and the major portion of
STATE revenue from
taxation.
the surplus revenue, shewn above as returned
to the States by the Commonwealth Govern -
ment, was obtained from those sources. A
fair amount of revenue is, however, obtained
by the States from other forms of taxation. These are set out in the
accompanying statement: —

According to the above figures, the largest share in the expenditure was
incurred for interest and sinking funds in connection with the public debts.
In addition to the expenditure from consolidated revenue, the States
expend varying amounts each year for loans.
The amounts so spent during the six years
1901 to 1907 are given hereunder;—
LOAN EXPENDITURE.
It will perhaps prove of interest to shew how the States expend their
loan moneys. The statement hereunder gives the details for the year 1906-7:
The aggregate loan expenditure by all the States up to the 30th June,
1907, was £231,108,346. How this was expended is shewn in the table

A natural corollary to the statement just given is one shewing the
actual public debt of the Australian States. This is set out in the
following table. The figures in the table
of aggregate loan expenditure represent the
amounts actually spent, while those in the
table below refer to the loans still unpaid at
a given date :
THE PUBLIC DEBT OF
AUSTRALIA.
From the figures just given, it will be seen that the public debt of
Australia at the 30th June, 1907, was about 240 millions sterling, or £57
15s. Id. per inhabitant. At first sight, the total appears somewhat heavy
for a country with such a comparatively small population, and Australia
has been subjected to a good deal of hostile criticism on this account, by
people who, it is to be feared, were not sufficiently conversant with the
circumstances under which the bulk of the debt was incurred. A study of
the conditions under which the development of this country proceeded,
will make it fairly clear that Australia’s progress is largely the result of
Australia’s debt. In explanation of this rather paradoxical statement,
allusion may again be made to the fact that Australia is practically
destitute of navigable inland waterways. In the absence of these the
effective development of the rich lands distant from the coast line rendered
imperative the construction of expensive roads and railways. A glance at
the figures in the table on page 76 will shew what a large proportion of
the debt was incurred on these services alone. It will be seen also that
the major portion of the loan moneys has been spent in services necessary
to the opening up of the country. Without this expenditure, the progress
which has been achieved in the development of the productive resources of
the country would have been impossible.


SOCIAL CONDITIONS IN THE COMMONWEALTH.
1.—EDUCATION.
In all the States of the Commonwealth, except Tasmania (where a Bill
to provide for free education will shortly be introduced in the local Legisla-
ture), public primary education is free, while in those States possessing
THE UNIVERSITY OF SYDNEY, N.S.W., WITH MEDICAL SCHOOL TO THE LEFT.
public higher schools and universities, free admission is granted to the
children of parents unable to pay the fees. Moreover, throughout Austra-
lia, there is very liberal provision in the way of scholarships and bursaries,
which are open to all children without distinction of class or religion. It
has always been the aim of the Australian Parliaments to spread the advan-
tages of primary education as widely as possible, and this is accomplished
in various ways. All the capital cities and the larger towns are, of course,
provided with a considerable number of schools, which in respect of general
design and equipment are very similar to schools of the same class in the
United Kingdom. Then in the more sparsely-peopled country districts,
there are smaller public' or provisional” schools. In still more thinly-
]>eopled areas, half-time schools are to be found, i.e., schools which are
visited alternately by the one teacher, while itinerant teachers visit the
scattered settlers in the “back blocks.” In some States, the plan has been
adopted of closing clusters of small country schools, and replacing them by
a larger central institution, to which the children are conveyed each day in
comfortable vehicles. This plan, besides being more economical, leads to
greater efficiency.
1. In Australia a “ public” school is generally speaking a State primary school.

That the States have been successful in at least spreading the benefits
of primary education is clearly set forth by the following table, which shews

fairly accurate results can be obtained at tbe census.
From the above figures, it will be seen that whereas only 48 per cent,
of the children between five and fifteen could read and write in 1861, the
proportion had increased by the year 1901 to nearly 80 per cent.
PUBLIC SCHOOL SPORTS, SYDNEY CRICKET GROUND, N.S.W.
The marriage statistics also shew the great spread of primary education
since 1861. In that year, nearly 25 per cent, of the persons married signed
the marriage register with a mark, while in 1906 the percentage had fallen
to as low as 0.89.
The State schools of the Commonwealth had an enrolment in 1906 of
610,000 pupils, and an average attendance of 413,000. The schools them-
selves numbered 7308, that is to say, there is one public school in the

their worth from the highly successful results obtained by many of them at
the various University public examinations. Considerable sums of money
have been spent on buildings and equipment of the higher grade institu-
tions, the buildings and sites of thirty-seven of the most important schools
being returned as worth £911,000.
In Australia, the State concerns itself mainly with primary and
University education, very few distinctly secondary schools being under
State control. How best to secure an effective

educational activity is a problem which is

manufacturing industry, further extension of technical training in the arts
and crafts will become a necessity. During the past six years the
Commonwealth expenditure on technical education averaged about £78,000
annually, a very trilling sum compared with that expended on primary
education.
Space will not permit of more than a passing reference to the spread
of education, as evidenced by the number and distribution of the public
libraries in the Commonwealth, of which at the latest date there were
1500, containing about million hooks, the institutions at Melbourne and
Sydney respectively containing 192,000 and 180,000 volumes. Of the
numerous Scientific Societies the most important is the Royal Society of
New South Wales, which has 350 members, corresponds and exchanges
with 432 kindred societies throughout the world, and possesses a library of
about 20,000 volumes, including many interesting works on the early
history of Australia.
2. — RELIGION.
There is no State-established religion in the Commonwealth, nor are
any religious distinctions operative in public affairs. There is, moreover,
no religious test for admission to any of the
rights and privileges of citizens. By far the
largest proportion of the inhabitants of the
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY.
Commonwealth belong to the Church of England. The Roman Catholic
is the next most numerous denomination, followed by the Methodists,
Presbyterians, and Baptists. At the decennial census fairly accurate
returns are obtained of the professed religions of the people, although if
a person has conscientious objections he is not compelled to state his
religion on the census schedule. The last census was taken in 1901, and
the distribution of the denominations was then recorded as follows. Only
the larger branches are separately mentioned: —


The professed adherents of the Church of England thus comprised
about 40 per cent, and the Roman Catholic Church about 23 per cent, of
the entire population of the Commonwealth.
3.—PUBLIC JUSTICE.
The great body of Australian law is, in its basic principles, founded on
British law, but there have, of course, been considerable modifications and
extensions to suit local circumstances.
LAW COURTS, PERTH, WESTERN AUSTRALIA
Throughout the Commonwealth there are minor courts for the trial of
petty offences and the settlement of trivial civil actions, such courts being
presided over by magistrates or similar func-
tionaries. Next in order come courts of
various designation, such as Courts of Quarter
COURTS OF JUSTICE.
Sessions, District Courts, Circuit Courts, then the Supreme Courts, and,
lastly, the High Court of Australia. In certain circumstances appeal may
he made from an Australian court to the Privy Council. The purity of the
administration of justice in Australia, from the lowest to the highest stages,
has never been seriously impugned.

Despite the rapid changes in social and industrial conditions which

the statistics here prove that not only lias there been a very considerable
diminution in crime compared with the record of forty years ago, but that
the decrease, even during the last six years, has been persistent. Taking
the convictions at Lower or Magistrate’s Courts for offences against
the person and property, the rate in 10,000 persons was as shewn
hereunder: —
CONVICTIONS FOR SERIOUS CRIME AT MAGISTRATES’ COURTS.
Year 1881. 1891. 1901. 1906.
Convictions per 10,000 persons ... 69.3 44.8 29.1 28.2
A more satisfactory test still is afforded by taking the persons com-
mitted for trial at the Superior Courts of the Commonwealth. The rates
per 10,000 of these were as follows :
COMMITTALS TO SUPERIOR COURTS.
Year 1881. 1891. 1901. 1906.
Committals in 10,000 persons ... 12 11 8 7
There has also been a remarkable decline in the gaol population.
Although complete figures are not available for the earlier years, the
results even during the period 1901 to 1906 shew that the improvement is
continuing. The prisoners in gaol per 10,000 of the population during the
sexennium were as follows ;
PRISONERS IN GAOL.
Year 1901. 1902. 1903. 1904. 1905. 1806.
Prisoners in Gaol, per 10,000 ... 11.2 10.9 10.7 11.0 10.0 9.0
The expenditure in the Commonwealth on
police, prisons, and other matters, connected
with the administration of justice was as
follows :
EXPENDITURE.
During the period dealt with, the expenditure on gaols decreased by
£12,000, while the expenditure on Courts of Justice and miscellaneous
diminished by about £67,000.


4.— PUBLIC BENEVOLENCE
It would he absurd to affirm that there is no poverty in Australia, hut
it can truthfully he said that the number of absolutely destitute persons
forms a comparatively negligible proportion of the entire population. No
poor rate is levied in any part of the Commonwealth, for there is
practically no pauper class to need it.
The hulk of the work of looking after the sick and destitute is in
private hands, although the States maintain orphanages and asylums for
the destitute and insane. At the latest available date there were in the
Commonwealth 313 hospitals, in which 10(i,000 patients were treated, the
total expenditure being £5(57,000. Hospitals for the insane number 27.
The expenditure on these during the latest available year was £403,000,
and the number of indoor patients 17,000. In benevolent and destitute
asylums, 1(5,000 indoor patients were received, and the expenditure came
to £177,000. The total expenditure on all charities at date of latest
returns was £1,700,000. These amounts are exclusive of payments in
connection with old-age jtensions in New South Wales and Victoria, where
the amounts in 190(5 were respectively £510,000 and £189,000. A
Commonwealth scheme of old-age pensions has also been adopted and
will come into operation on the Ist July, 1909, or on such other date
as may he fixed by proclamation.
