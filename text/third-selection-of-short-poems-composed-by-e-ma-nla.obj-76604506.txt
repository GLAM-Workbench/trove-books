PREF A C E
TO THE
-THIRD EDITION-
This is the third Collection we are sending out on Mr. Davis? be-
half. We desire to thank friends and the public generally for
the hearty reception of the first and second Collections which has
inspired our suffering friend to again put into print a few other
little poems, And has he tells us in the first piece, ?An appeal?
God as given him work to do, that he may be able to earn his
daily bread, and be kept happy and trustful in the meanwhile.
How comforting is the knowledge; that
?In some way or other, the Lord will provide.?
When all ahead seemed dark and drear, our God in His infinite
Providence opened up a way for his child through the wilderness
and has made that way to blossom as the rose.
Faithfully yours.
THE PUBLISHER.


AN APPEAL.
?And unto one He gave five talents, to another two, and to another
one, to every man according to his several ability.??Matthew xxv 16.
Kind friends, when you my poems read,
Just pray with them I may succeed ;
The Lord hath given this work to me,
To help and keep me cheerfully.
King David, in his Psalms hath said,
He never saw the righteous begging bread;
To prove what David said is true,
The Lord hath given me work to do.
That I may earn my daily meal,
Be upright, and not beg or steal,
Oft when in pain, in the weary night,
The text will come a poem to write.
Blind and paralyzed I?ve lain,
Nine years upon this bed of pain ;
Trusting and waiting for the call ;
To dwell with Christ my all in all.
In that bright land so pure and fair ;
No sin or sorrow can enter there;
Where all is love; Oh let me rest,
Fair Rose of Sharon, on thy breast.
THE DYING CHRISTIAN?S DREAM.
? To depart and to be with Christ, which is far better.?-Philippians i. 23
On Clifton Hill, a cottage stands
In a garden fresh and neat,
And the fragrance from the roses,
Fills the air with perfumie sweet.
In the front room of that cottage,
A dying Christian now doth lay,
Patiently waiting for the summons,
His spirit soon will pass away,
From this cold earth to realms of bliss
On Canaan?s golden shore,
In peace and love he there will rest,
With the Lamb for evermore.


Beside him sits his mother clear,
Her heart is full of bitter grief,
Bathing his hot and feverish head
To give her darling some relief.
I am so happy mother, he said
I have had a pleasant dream ;
All the sights so pure and holy,
Pilled my soul with joy supreme.
First there came a band of angels,
So calm and holy, pure and bright;
All around my bed they gathered : ?
Mother, ?twas a glorious sight.
Then they played such heavenly music
On their golden harps to me ;
0 then what rapture filled my soul,
So sweet they sang this song to me.
?We are coming, dearest brother,
We are coming bye-and-bye ;
Be thou ready, dearest brother,
For the time is drawing nigh.
I then awoke, but they had gone
Back to the glory land,
To sing their song before the throne ;
Hosanna to the gentle Lamb.
Mother, dear, come near and nearer,
My eyes are getting very dim.
Hark, I hear the angels coming,
I hear the flutter of their wings.
o
Open wide the door, dear mother
And let the angels in ;
They are so very bright and holy,
So, pure and spotless, free from sin.
Mv Jesus He is coming
? o
With His bright angelic band,
Through the valley safe He?ll guide me,
To my home in Beulah land.


THE SECOND COMING OF THE LORD.
? And what I say unto yon I say unto all, Watch." ?Mark xiii. 37 t
Watch, brethren, watch, Oh watch and pray,
The time is drawing near,
When Jesus with His angel band
Will in the air appear.
The S ; on of Man hath so arranged
In the twinkle of an eye
His saints on earth will all be changed,
And meet Him in the sky.
Watch, brethren, watch, Oh watch and pray,
And all be ready found,
To meet your Saviour in the air,
When the mighty trumph shall sound.
And if ye will not ready be,
This truth bear in your mind,
When Jesus comes to claim His bride,
You will be left behind.
Like a lightning flash the Lord will come
When the mighty trumph shall sound,
To gather all His children home,
All who are ready found.
Watch then, my brethren, watch and pray,
? Be ready from near and far,
?Twill not be long, soon will appear
The Bright and Morning Star.
A CHILD?S LAMENT.
Blessed aie they that mourn, for they shall be comforted.??Matt, v 4
Come, gather round, my children,
And a story I will tell,
About that little orphan,
Her name is Lily Bell.
My heart is sad, O very sad,
For I love sweet Lily Bell,
O ! how she wept o?er h�r mother?s death,
The story I now? will tell.
Friends led her gently to the room
Where her dear mother lay,
And told her softly she had gone
To her rest in Heaven that day.


The child looked up, O hush ! she cried,
My mamma only sleeps ;
She would not leave her Lily dear
In this world alone to weep.
Speak, mamma, speak one little word,
Why do you lie so still 1
You look so cold and white, mamma,
Oh tell me, are you ill 1
Open your eyes, dear mamma,
And smile again on me ;
?Tis I, your pet, your Lily dear,
You loved so much to see.
Oh, bring my mamma back to me,
I cannot live alone,
My little heart I?m sure will break ;
Where has my mamma gone ?
Farewell, my dearest mamma,
Thou hast left me here alone
A little friendless orphan,
In this wilderness to roam.
Thou Lily of the Yalley,
And Rose of Sharon fair,
Hear now my simple story,
My little humble prayer.
My mamma told me, Jesus,
If I gave my heart to Thee,
To Thy bosom you would fold me,
And my Shepherd you would be.
Watch o?er me now, Lord Jesus,
Till my trials all are o?er,
Then take me home to mamma
Where parting is no more.
SINNERS, BEWARE.
? Because there is wrath, beware lest lie take thee away with his
stroke : then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.??Job. xxxvi 18.
Sinner, poor sinner, beware of the day,
In the midst of thy sins if you?re called away,
The day is fast coming, the time is quite near,
Soon before the white throne you will have to appear.


What then will you say when Jesus you meet,
With His glorified saints on the great judgment seat!
O tremble, then sinner with fear, if you stand
Unwashed or unoleansed in the blood of the Lamb.
Hasten then sinner and make no delay,
Reject not the pardon you?re offered to-day ;
The Saviour is waiting with arms to receive
All penitent ones, who will ?only believe.?
But if you?ll not take this warning from me,
And reject still the Lamb of Mount Calvary ;
Depart now, ye cursed, the Lord will you tell
Into fire everlasting, and torments of hell.
Oh, dreadful the thought, for eternity to be
Amidst the blackest of darkness in great agony ;
The gnashing of teeth and the cries or despair,
Alas, alas, poor sinner no mercy for you there.
THE WANDERER?S CONFESSION.
? I will arise and go to my father and will say unto him, Father I
have sinned against heaven and before thee.??Luke xv. 18.
Almighty God, Thou great Jehovah,
In Jesus? name I come to Thee ;
In Thy wondrous love and mercy,
Do not hide Thy face from me.
Hear, oh hear me, Ho'y Father,
Listen to my humble pl�a ;
I am weak and heavy laden,
All my sins I bring to Thee.
Blessed Jesus, loving Saviour,
Thou my Intercessor be
I would know Thy love and mercy,
Plead, oh plead my cause for me.
Many years from Thee I wandered,
Many years I gave Thee pain,
But Thy gentle love and mercy.
Hath won my heart to Thee again,
Far away across the mountains,
Through the desert and the plain
I have heard Thy gracious calling,
Oh, restore my soul again.


THE VALLEY OF DEATH.
?Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death. I will
me I ??psahi art With m 6 ? fchy rod and th y staff they comfort
I am walking through the valley,
Through the dark and lonely valley,
I am walking through the shadow of death.
I have Jesus by my side,
And safe He will me guide,
Through the valley of the shadow of death.
I am walking through the valley,
Through the dark and lonely valley,
lam walking through the shadow of death.
No evil will I fear,
My Saviour?s with me here,
In the valley of the shadow of death.
I am walking through the valley,
Through the dark and lonely valley,
I am walking through the shadow of death.
His rod and stafi?to me,
A comfort now will be,
Through the valley of the shadow of death.
The valley now looks bright,
For I see the heavenly light,
The Morning Star is shining all the way.
My pilgrimage is o?er,
I?ll sorrow never more
In the valley of the shadow of death.
GENTLE JESUS.
?Tliy Holy OhiH Jesus, whom Thou hast anointed.?-ActsUy. 27.
Gentle Jesus, meek and mild,
Once thou wert a little child
Nestling on Thy mother's breast,
Helpless, holy babe at rest.
Gentle Jesus, Thou didst go
Through this world of pain and woe,
Meek and lowly, good and kind,
Healing sick, and lame, and blind.
Gentle Jesus, Thou didst pray
W hen in dark Gethsemane thou didst say,
Father Thy will, not Mine be done,
While blood-like sweat didst from Thee run.


Gentle Jesus, Thou hast died,
And for our sins was crucified ;
In wondrous love to set us free,
Thou suffered death on Calvary.
Gentle Jesus, Son of man,
Who sittest now on God?s right hand
To intercede for one and all
Who on Thy holy name will call.
Soon from that seat, Thou?ll rise to come
To bring thy blood-washed followers home,
And in the mansions fair they?ll be
With Thee for all eternity.
THE COLD HEART.
?To do good and communicate forget not, for with such sacrifices
God is well pleased.??Hebrews xiii. 16.
Cold, cold the wind is blowing
Across the lonely moor ;
But colder far, the heart that hath
No kind words for the poor.
Cold, cold the wind is blowing,
Cold is the hail and rain,
But colder far the unkind heart,
That to the poor gives pain.
Cold, cold the wind is blowing,
The snow falls fast and thick,
But colder far the selfish heart
That will not help the sick.
One little word of passing love,
To a poor and sinful man,
May be the means of saving him
From eternity with the damned.
Then throw your selfish pride away.
Kind words of comfort give,
Stretch forth your hand where?re you be,
To help the poor to live.
And God will bless your work of love,
It is His great command
To preach the word and help the poor
That live throughout the land.


THE TEMPTER.
? Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light.??2 Cor. xi. 14.
Tempter, away, begone from me ;
FT o friendship do I want from thee;
A liar thou art from beginning to end,
And never to thee shall my knee bend.
Tempter, away, begone from me ;
A curse thou art on land or sea ;
Thou cometh to us in the hours of night,
With thy honeyed tongue as an angel of light.
Tempter, away, begone from me ;
False one, avaunt, I love not thee,
I fear thee not, for when I call
On Jesus? name, you backward fall.
Tempter, away, begone from me ; .
I have a Friend that?s true to me ;
To Him alone I?ll bow the knee,
He is my Friend of Calvary.
A SOLDIER AND THE BEGGAR.
? If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily fond, and one of
you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled, notwith-
standing ye give them not those things that are needful to the body,
what doth it profit.??James ii, 15, 16
While walking one day in the month of July,
A poor looking woman I happened to spy;
Her garments were tattered, she looked very old,
She was trembling and wet from the rain and the cold
?Good brother,? she cried, ?speak kindly to me,
I have been out all day seeking some charity ;
I cannot do work, for I?m sixty years old,
And, I?m perishing now from hunger and cold.?
?God bless you, my sister, to you I will speak,
I see you are old and looking quite weak;
I can?t turn a deaf ear to your call of distress,
For I wear the red guernsey, the shield, and the S.?
?God bless you, my brother, for the kind words you
speak,
I feel the hot tears run down my poor cheek;
1 knew by the guernsey, the shield, and the S.
You would not pass by a poor soul in distress,?


?Ah, yes, my dear sister, a Christian should be,
Full of love and compassion and sweet charity.
Who doeth not these things, I give you my word,
Is not a consistent follower of God.?
?Come along then, dear sister, to the Home let us go,
Our kind friends will give you a welcome, I know ;
They?re true to their Master and kind to the poor,
And ne?er turn a case of real need from the door.
FEAR THOU NOT.
?Pear thou not for I am with thee, be not dismayed for I am thy God.?
Isaiah xli, 10.
Last night, amidst much pain and sorrow,
Came a whisper soft and clear ;
Saying, Murmur not, my brother,
I am with thee, do not fear.
Though the clouds are hanging o?er thee,
And they all seem dark and drear,
Behind them is a silver lining,
Soon they?ll break forth bright and clear.
Though the nights are long and weary,
And thy body?s racked with pain,
Fear thou not, I love thee dearly,
Soon thy sun will shine again.
When the pangs of death assail thee,
Fear thou not the terror King,
Holy Ones are watching o?er thee,
Death for thee hath lost its sting.
I have won the victory for thee,
I have conquered death and hell,
Be thou faithful, do not falter,
And for thee all will be well.
Fear thou not, then, dearest brother,
Angel bands now o'er thee bend,
I?ll not leave thee nor forsake thee,
I?ll be with you to the end.


A MOTHER?S LAMENTATION
She goetb unto the grave to weep there.??John xi.
One bud, the Gardener gave me,
A fair and lovely child,
My little Constance Edith Bell,
With blue eyes soft and mild.
I thanked the Gardener for His gift,
My little fair-haired child,
He gave her to my keeping,
To cherish undefiled.
Eor fourteen years I nursed my bud.
And taught her how to pray,
Alas ! one day the Gardener came,
And took my bud away.
0, how I miss my pretty flower,
My sweet, my blue eyed Bell,
I loved her with a mother?s love,
Such love no tongue can tell
Just like a tender ivy plant,
Around my heart entwined,
The joy and comfort of my life,
ISo faithful, true and kind.
No more her little prattling tongue,
Will sing that song to me,
??Wash me, Jesus in Thy blood,
That flowed on Calvary.?
In that little church-yard yonder,
Wljere the weeping willows wave,
I?ve laid my darling down to rest,
In her dark and lonely grave.
And every day I take a walk,
Down to that sacred spot,
And linger till the setting sun,
For I forget her not.
The summer comes with pretty flowers,
The winter wind and rain,
But oh, my little blooming bud,
Will ne?er return again,


Farewell, farewell, my pretty flower,
My own, my blue-eyed Bell,
My heart, my heart is very sad,
My grief, no one can tell.
At Zion?s bright and pearly gate,
I?ll meet my pet in prayer,
And ask her for to watch and wait,
Till her mamma is called up there.
Oh what a meeting it will be,
Ho pain nor sorrow there,
God will wipe all tears away,
In that happy land so fair.
And on that bright Celestial shore,
A song of praise we?ll sing,
Hosanna to the Lamb of God,
Who redeemed us from our sins,
AN INFIDEL?S DEATH-BED.
'The Lord said. My spirit shall not always strive with man.??Gen. yi.
In that noble mansion yonder,
A dwelling fit for England?s Queen,
Surrounded by a lovely garden,
Peace, you?d think reigned there supreme.
But you must not judge that book
Because it hath a pretty cover,
For inside that noble mansion,
Nought is there but pain and sorrow.
Upon a rich and downy bed,
My heart is sad, the truth to tell,
Lies the master of that mansion,
A wicked, dying infidel.
Beside him sits his faithful wife,
Bathing his hot and aching brow,
And terror-stricken in his soul,
Death?s icy hand is on him now.
Dear wife, he cried, in bitter grief,
The truth to me my heart doth tell ;
There is a just and living God,
And He will cast me into hell.


Oh ! husband dear, if you believe,
The Lord is just, His word is true,
There?s mercy at the eleventh hour,
For a sinner even vile as you.
?Tis too late now, I cannot pray,
And ask for pardon from your God,
I?ve been too long an infidel,
And laughed to scorn His holy word.
?Tis not too late, for Jesus came,
To seek the lost, poor souls to save,
And for you on the cruel tree
He paid the debt, His life He gave.
All, all is lost, in pain, he cried,
No more I?ll see the rising sun,
O ! mountains, hide me if you can,
0 ! hide me from the wrath to come.
The dying thief upon the cross,
Could say, Oh ! Lord, remember me,
In Paradise, the Lord replied.
This day with Me you?ll be.
Your pleading now is all in vain,
Hell hath commenced within ray breast,
My tougue for ever now is sealed,
Come quickly death and give me rest
In wild delirium now he starts,
Look ! see there comes the hellish band,
To claim their own, their infidel,
To dwell for ever with the damned.
THE WITHERING SHEAVES.
?Lift up your eyes and look on the fields ; for they are white already
to hai vest/ ?John, iv 35.
Come, brethren, let us now go forth ;
Why sit we here at ease ?
The harvest is white and very large,
And full of withering sheaves.
Reapers are wanted, for wide is the field,
Then why sit we here at our ease ?
When one little word of kindness and love,
May save some poor withering sheaves.


To the work let us go, with love deep in our hearts,
And pray to the Lord on our knees,
In His wonderful love and mercy so great,
To save the fast withering sheaves.
Let us work with a will as our duty demands,
And our Father in Heaven we?ll please !
And to the dear Saviour we ever shall look
To save the poor withering shelves.
When our work for the Master is finished, and we
Are called from all lands and all seas ;
The Lord Jesus Christ will welcome us home,
As we come with our bundles of sheaves.
THE PENSYLVANIA FLOOD.
? For when they shall say, Peace and safety, theh sudden destruction
cometh upon them.??l Thessalonians y. 3.
At Jolmstown, in the dead of night,
Three miles of water, (what a sight)
Burst from the reservoir like a sea,
Sweeping hundreds of souls into eternity.
A'ext morning when the sun was bright,
Horror of horrors, what a sight.
On the floating debris, hear the cry
Hundreds perishing, no help being nigh.
The raging water rose higher and higher,
And the floating debris was now all on fire ;
Oh the shrieks of the drowning, their piteous cry,
For by water or fire thy surely must die.
When the mighty waters at last did subside,
Hundreds of bodies lay side by side,
Just the day before they did sport and play,
But the flood came and hurried their souls away.
It was truly a sad and mournful sight,
To see the dead mothers with their babes clutched
As if death had met them in their effort to save
Their darling pets from a watery grave.
In the midst of life we are in death,
Spurn not God?s grace while you have breath;
The hour you know not; or the day
W hen the Lord will call you from earth away.


Now, the lesson God would have us learn,
Is to trust in Christ, nor mercy spurn ?
For by faith in Him we are secure,
Though the swellings of Jordan we?re called to
endure^
THE FREE BREAKFAST WORKERS ,
? Whoso shall receive one such little child in My name receiveth Me,?
?Matt, xviii. 5.
?These things saith the Son of God I know thy works, and
charity, and service, and faith, and thy patience.??ltev. ii. 18,19
The Free Breakfast workers meet every Lord's day morning , and provide
a Free Breakfast at 8 a.m. in the Mission Ball, Wellington Afreet, for the
Poor Children of Collingioood and surrounding Suburbs. A service is held
after breakfast.
I?ve heard you speak, dear brother
Of rich men, good and kind,
Who are always giving money,
To help the poor and blind.
I?ll tell you of a Christian band,
Free breakfast workers named,
Whose great delight is to relieve
The poor, the sick and maimed.
They do not seek for worldly fame,
But great their reward will be ;
Their Father in Heaven is watching,
Their love and charity.
They never turn their hacks upon
The poor in pain and grief,
But speak a kind and loving word,
And freely give relief.
?Tis now five years since they began
To give a breakfast free,
And children poor from near and far,
Are invited there to be.
They do not boast of what they give,
But published it shall be,
In hundreds more they want the poor
To attend the breakfast free.
A kind reception they?ll receive,
And welcome all will be ;
Every Sunday morn at the Mission Hall,
To the breakfast given free


0 Father, bless this noble band,
The breakfast workers free ;
And help them in their work of love,
And acts of charity.
And when their earthly work is done,
United let them be,
And in sweet love for ever rest
With the Lamb of Calvary.
SISTER COME.
Ihn lonely dear sister without you,
Oh why do you tarry so long ?
I love to hear your pleasant voice,
In holy prayer, and song.
Come read to me dear sister.
How Jesus prayed for me ;
Prostrate upon the earth one night,
In dark Gethsemane.
Tell me the wondrous story,
How Jesus came to save;
And for the poor lost sinner
His life on Calvary gave.
Tell me also now dear sister,
Hdw His feet and hands were torn ;
And how they pierced His Holy brow
With a cruel crown of thorns.
What wondrous love did Jesus show,
When cried that suffering One
??Tis finished, Father forgive them,
They know not whart. they?ve done.?
FOR GOOD FRIDAY.
?And they crucified Him and parted His garments, casting lots; that
It might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Prophet; They parted
My garments among them, and upon My vesture did they cast lots ?
Matthew xxvii. 35.
This is the anniversary,
The day when Christ was led
From the Judgment Hall to Calvary?s mount
Where His blood for us was shed.

This is the anniversary,
Methinks I see Him now
Nailed to that rugged cross of wood
With the thorns upon His brow.
This is the anniversary,
Of the death of Christ the Lord,
The Holy Son of God who died
According to God?s word.
For in the ages passed before,
The Psalmist thus declared ;
? I come, oh Lord to do Thy will
A body hast Thou prepared.?
And in that spotless body, there
He hung between two thieves,
His blood atones for all our sins,
The guilty, God reprieves.
All glory to the Lamb of God,
Who did salvation bring ;
Jehovah?s great redemption,
His remedy for sin.
