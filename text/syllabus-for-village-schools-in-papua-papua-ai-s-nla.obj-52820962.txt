NOTES FOR DISTRICT MISSIONARIES.
1. This Syllabus has been kept as simple as possible in
order that it may be applicable to the smallest one-teacher
schools. In schools that are larger, or in which the teacher has
some help, it will probably be found desirable to subdivide
each class into an upper and lower group. The Time-table has
also been drawn up on the assumption that only one teacher will
be available for the whole school; and it can be improved upon
where helpers are available. The Time-table also assumes a
three-day school week, as this arrangement is almost universal
among L.M.S. schools in Papua.
2. It is recommended that some guidance should be given to
teachers in selecting the most suitable group of letters with
which to begin reading instruction in Class C. Generally
speaking, it is best to choose one vowel and four or five
consonants, but which these will be will vary with different
vernaculars. The aim should be to choose those letters which
lend themselves to the formation of a large number of words.
After the initial group have been learned, the remaining vowels
should be introduced one by one, and then the remaining
consonants.
3. Guidance should also be given in connection with writing.
The best method is probably to teach the “ printscript ” style of
writing to Class C, with a gradual transition to ordinary cursive
writing in the upper classes. Teachers should be warned
against allowing very small writing, and also against teaching
ornate styles of cursive writing.
4. From time to time, at teachers’ gatherings, suggestions
might be given for topics and modes of treatment in connection
with the “ General Knowledge ” section of the Syllabus. But,
on the whole, this type of lesson is most successful when it issues
spontaneously from the teacher’s personal experience or interests,
rather than when it results from the mechanical following of
“ notes ” or “ helps.” Teachers should therefore be encouraged
to follow their own bent as much as possible in this subject.
5. No suggestions have been made in the Syllabus as to
handicraft work, as conditions vary so much from place to place.
The desirability of the school curriculum including such work is,
however, obvious ; and provision has been made for it in the
Time-table.

SCHOOL PRAYERS.
Morning School should begin with :
Hymn
Prayer
Bible Lesson.
Remember that prayer should be short. In your prayers,
do not talk to God about the boys and girls ; talk to Him as a
boy or girl would talk to Him.
For the Bible Lesson, you will take a lesson from your
book—“ Jesus, the Friend of All.” Take one lesson each week.
On Monday, tell the story. On the other days, ask questions
about it that will help the boys and girls to think about it and
to understand it.
When school is finished for the day, all should say the
Lord’s Prayer together.
DRILL and GAMES.
If you know how to do drill and physical exercises, it is a
good thing to give the boys and girls about ten minutes of this
work when you change lessons in the middle of school time.
Remember that it will help you in your work if you join in
the games of your boys and girls, and sometimes teach them new
games. In this way, they will think of you as their friend,
and will listen to you better when they are in school.
DIVIDING YOUR SCHOOL INTO CLASSES.
Divide your school into three classes, and call them A,
B and C. A will be the top class, B the middle one, and C
the bottom one. Try to get the children of your village to start
school when they are quite small.
If you have some boys and girls who are too good to stop
in Class A, then you are ready to start English lessons, and to
use the Government books, and you should speak to your
missionary about this.

Letters and easy Do not teach all the letters at once,
words. Choose a few letters (about five or six)
(Small letters only, and teach them first. Make words from
not capital letters.) these letters and write them on the
blackboard. Do this again and again,
until the boys and girls know these few
letters well. Then teach one new letter,
and make a lot more words with the new
letter and the old ones. Then teach
another new letter, and make a lot
more words. Do this until you have
finished all the letters. A good way is
to teach one new letter each week.
Reading Cards for Get a lot of small pieces of cardboard or
teaching reading and strong paper. Write a different word on
writing. each card, in print writing. Choose
short words and use small letters only,
not capital letters. Give a card to each
boy and girl, and let them write the
word in the sand, or with small shells.
While they are doing this, let them come
to you one by one to read the word to

WORK. HOW TO TEACH IT.
Number Work.
Counting 1 to 100. Do this work with shells, stones, or small
Multiplication tables sticks. Do not say the tables only, but
up to 6 times
ask questions about them too. When
they have said the 2 times table, ask
questions like this; 2x6? 2x3?
2x9? 2xl? 2x11? Do this again
and again till they can answer quickly.
Then start the 3 times table.
Multiplying and Teach this work with twenty small
dividing small stones, as you taught adding and sub-
numbers. tracting to Class C.
Writing numbers and Teach the boys and girls to write small
sums, 1 to 100.
sums like the ones they have done with
stones. When they can do these well,
teach them to write numbers from 21 to
100, and to do bigger sums using these
numbers.
Reading and Writing.
Capital letters, Teach the capital letters, and write
sentences and stories. words on the blackboard with a capital
letter at the beginning. Then write
sentences with a capital letter at the
beginning of the sentence, and with
capital letters for names of people. Put
a full stop at the end of the sentence.
Then write verses from the Bible, or
short stories. Be careful to put capital
letters, full stops, and commas in their
proper places, and teach the boys and
girls about them. The boys and girls
will read all these things from the
blackboard, and will write them.
Reading Cards.
Make Reading Cards, as for Class C, but
write a sentence on each card instead of
a word. Use the cards for reading and
writing as in Class C.
NOTE. Keep your school things in a cupboard or big box.
You should also have two small boxes, one for Class C Reading
Cards, and one for Class B Reading Cards ; also a box or tin for
the shells, stones, or small sticks you use for number work.

HOW TO TEACH IT.
Teach the new tables one by one, as you
did the ones in Class B.
When the boys and girls can multiply
and divide by numbers up to 12, then
you can start teaching them to multiply
and divide by numbers bigger than 12.
But do not be in a hurry to start these
harder sums.
Show the boys and girls copper and
silver coins and paper notes, and teach
them their names. Teach them to
answer easy questions about the prices
of things, and about the change they
should get when they pay for things
at the store.
If you have one gospel in a small book,
use that. If you have the four gospels in
one book, then teach them like this :
Luke 2 (1-20), Matthew 2 (1-12),
Luke 2 (11-52), The whole of Mark's
Gospel, Matthew 5 (1-16), Luke 6
(27-49), Luke 10 (25-37), Luke 15,
John 15.
Do not always read “ all together.”
Make the boys and girls read one by one.
But a little reading together at the
beginning of a lesson is good, because it
helps the slow boys and girls to learn.
Put a picture where all the boys and girls
can see it. Tell them to write a short
story about the picture. When they have
finished, look at their stories, and tell
them about their mistakes. Write a good
one on the blackboard for them to read
and copy.
Tell the boys and girls stories about
other parts of Papua, and the people who
live in them, and, if you can, about other
countries too. Also stories about the
things they buy at the store, such as
rice, kerosene, etc. —where these things
come from, and how they are made.
