PREFACE
It was spring when, in njy travel, I
arrived at Innisfail, Queensland, I was a
guest of my father's friend, Mr, Taam Sz
Pui of the Tung Woh Store. Mr. Taani was
kind enough to show me the inanuscript
of his autobiography and instructed me to
write a short introduction. Alas, lam no
Scholar and therefore, not equal to the task!
Nevertheless, as it is not courteous to
disobey a command of an elder, I do what
I can so as to discharge my duty.

As I finish reading the manuscript of
Mr. Taatn, I realize that his clear perception
of truth and firmness of mind surpass all
others. By my observation, he has three
outstanding qualities which are beyond our
reach• First of all, from youtli to manhood
and thence to - old age, he endured hardship
for fifty years as if it were one day. Never
did he look tired nor wasted his labor.
Secondly, he contents himself with simpli-
city and holds himself steadfastly to honesty.
Kindness is what he loves to dispense and

righteousness is what he lives for. Thirdly,
he is very agreeable to be associated with*
Neither cross words nor angry looks has lie
ever employed towards Ws fellow men. He
is wealthy but not proud• With these fine
qualities, I have no wonder that liis family
has become prosperous.
Finally, in committing to writing his
experiences for his descendants, he has tnade
a model of himself* The words which, lie
used to express the deepest meanmg of life
are simple and clear. The rules of bueittess

Consequently I depended on her for support-
My Tincle was a small merchant and

worked £〇r him, obeying all Ms instructions
and commands and never dared to complain
about hardship. After three years, my

latter slipped off my hands and was broken
to pieces. My uncle, without consideration,

There was a rumour then that gold

But since we had come, we might make

Early on the third morning, we resutned

Proceeding to the 72nd mile, we reached
a place called u The Foot of the Great
Mountain 11 . Behold, before us was a great
mountain with the peak projecting high up
into the clouds and whose height was
beyond my calculation. We made our climb
at a slow pace and zigzaged down on the
other side. Inquiring of some companions
X was told we had travelled eighty two
miles- Completely worn out atid weary,
some discarded part of their supplies to
lighten the burden, and some were in tears.

“Alas, to suffer this torture of the flesh for

It took us fully three months to cover
one hundred miles in our journey. We then
began to sift sand but to our utter disap-
pointment, there was no gold. Mr. Kwok

kindly gave us instructions. We then
obtained one or two candareens per day.
This was just sufficient to pay our daily
expenses.

here we remained atratided for a considerable
number of years. I first thought of being-
a peddler which idea, my father favoured.
But in this business a heavy load on the
shoulder would restrict the territory one
could cover; yet the lighter the load, the
less the gain would be. Next my thought
turned to domestic service, but the position
was disrespectful and the wages poor.
There was no work that seemed to fit.
Finally I was driven back to take up my
former occupation of digging for gold.

about sixty pounds.
By that time, tny Savings had increased.
A peddler named Yuen Kiu was offering to
dispose of his whole stock-in-trade because
of reverses in gambling. I knew there was
profit in it and went into partnership with
Mr. Luk Fui to purchase the whole business.
We sold the goods later at favourable
prices, and each shared some profits. Hen-
ceforth my mind was set to become a
merchant.

consider the dem.fl.ticl. Do not stock a

goods are in demand at profitable prices it

2. Always serve your customers with
courtesy and patience. Show them patient-
ly as many samples as you can. If one does
not suit them, ofJer £hem others. Always
try to please them in order to extend the
trade.
(3). In wrapping up articles for the
customers make sure that there are no mis-
takes. In case a customer complains that
the figures are not correct, you should be

patient to check over them again. If there
be errors, apologize and make the correc-
tions accordingly. If there be no mistakes,
explain the fact with great tact so as not
to displease the customer and loose his
patronage.
(4), When there are too many cus-
tomers to enable you to attend to them all
at the same time, then ask courtesously
some of them to wait for a while. You
will thus not disappoint them and will
retain their goodwill.

(5). When a customer becomes lax in
the settlement of his account, sound bus-
iness demands collection. However, one
should employ careful terms to avoid an-
noyance. K letters nor calls result in pay-
ment, devise some other achetne. FinaUy
request him to pay by iustallmetits should
he keep postponeing. Do not loose control
for a moment and resort to legal procedure
for a lawsuit will eventually bring evil-
