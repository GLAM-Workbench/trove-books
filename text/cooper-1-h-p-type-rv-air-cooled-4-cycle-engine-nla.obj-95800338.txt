How to Start
1. Be sure crankcase is filled with oil—see “Lubrication,” page 3.
2. Fill base with petrol.
3. Pull upon choke button. Do not, however, use the choke to start when
engine is warm, unless necessary.
4. Turn engine back until compression is felt. Put knotted end of cord
through slot in starting pulley and wind cord tightly over top of and around
pulley until ball on other end is close to pulley. Grasp ball in hand, and,
standing back from engine, pull smartly on cord, when engine should start.
Illustration shows what is required.
5. Push choke button in gradually immediately engine starts.
How to Stop
Press stop button at the back of flywheel housing. See illustration, page 1

Lubrication
buonbunon
Lubrication of moving parts is accomplished by the SPLASH system. The
cam gear operates in an oil sump in such manner that oil is picked up between
the teeth of the gear and is forced out with considerable pressure as the teeth
of this gear mesh with those of the crankshaft gear. The spray of oil from
the gears is picked up by the revolving crankshaft and is distributed throughout
the crankshaft and cylinder. Thus, an ample supply of oil reaches all bearings
and bearing surfaces. i
It is essential that the crankcase be kept full of oil. With the engine in
constant work the oil level should be inspected daily and “topped up” as
needed. Oil circulation commences the instant the engine is started.
The use of an S.A.E. No. 20 oil, manufactured by a reputable concern, is
recommended.
Care of Fuel System
No difficulty should be experienced with this system if good, clean petrol
is used and is poured into the base from a clean container and funnel—be sure
both are clean. See that plug with hole is always screwed into petrol tank. Do
not confuse it with oil filler plug in crankcase.
The check valve assembly at the bottom of the fuel pipe, in the base,
should be removed periodically for cleaning. Simply blow through the pipe
from the screened end after washing the screen in petrol; it is not necessary
to take the check valve assembly apart.
When connecting fuel pipe again make certain connections are airtight.
This is important, since the carburettor is of the vacuum lift type and air
seepage at either end of fuel pipe will result in hard starting and faulty
operation.
Carburettor Adjustment
When adjustment of carburettor is found necessary, proceed as follows: —
1. Turn needle valve to right until it rests gently on its seat. In no
circumstances screw it down tightly, as this will injure both needle and seat,
and make it difficult to obtain satisfactory adjustment thereafter.
2. Unscrew needle valve approximately | turn.
3. Start engine, and allow to run under load until normal operating
temperature is reached.
4. Turn needle valve
slowly to right until engine
loses speed through mix-
ture having become too
lean. Note position of
marker, and then turn
needle valve slowly to left
until engine appears to
labour and the speed drops
slightly. Note position of
marker again, then slowly
turn needle valve to right
until it is midway between
the lean and the rich set'
tings. On an average, this
will result in the valve be-
ing about half a turn open
under full load when en-
gine is warm.


If the carburettor throttle lever has been removed, or if it needs adjust'
ment, turn butterfly valve (see “Governor Throttle Control”) to right until
completely closed, then, with governor arm in wide'Open position, replace
throttle lever on butterfly shaft. Draw up lightly on screw, rotate throttle
lever to right until governor arm is parallel with, or slightly beyond, crankshaft,
then tighten lever screw.
Governor Throttle Control
The engine is
designed to
operate at speed
shown on name
plate, and the
carburettor is
constructed with
a butterfly valve
controlled by a
mechanical gov-
ernor as the en-
gine load varies.
The governor
is built on to the
crankshaft and is
of the fly'weight
centrifugal type,
connected to the
carburettor valve
by means of a
small crank arm
and link.
While the em
gine is motion'
less the butterfly
valve is held
open by a small
spring attached
to the control
link, but upon its
being started the
governor weights
are thrown out'
wards, due to centrifugal force, thus causing movement of the governor arm
which results in partial closing of the butterfly valve, with a consequent reduc-
tion of the charge admitted to the cylinder. As the engine speed increases the
greater is the effect on the governor weights, and the resultant movement of
the governor arm will close the butterfly valve to the point where correct
speed is maintained.
Any increase in the load put on the engine will cause a drop in the
revolutions, thereby diminishing the centrifugal force on the governor weights,
which action will result in the butterfly valve opening to admit a larger charge
until normal engine speed has been reached.
Governor control is adjusted at the factory and should not be altered.


To Adjust Engine Speed
The speed of the engine is controlled by the action of the governor and
the tension of the governor spring, therefore, any change in the tension ot
this spring will affect the speed.
Since the spring acts to hold the butterfly valve open to admit a full
charge to the cylinder, a decrease in tension will result in slower engine speed.
An increase in the speed is then obtained by increasing the tension of the spring.
If it is thought that the engine is not running at right speed, use an
indicator on the crankshaft to check it. If the speed is higher than that uv
dicated on name
plate slacken tern
sion of the
spring. If the
speed be found
lower than it
should be, it
may be raised
simply by in-
creasing tension.
CAUTION.
Do not attempt
to stretch the
governor
spring. Any
change in its
a length will ren-
* der it useless for obtaining correct speed and speed variation.
Cooling
The fins on the cylinder and cylinder head of the engine radiate excess
* heat generated within the cylinder.
To ensure ample supply of air for cooling purposes under all conditions
a blower system is built into the engine. The system comprises a series of air
fins cast on to the face of the flywheel which is covered by a shroud the
purpose of which is to direct a blast of air continuously on to the cylinder
and cylinder head. This system ensures the maintenance of a satisfactory
operating temperature.
The cooling system requires no attention. In the event of overheating
consult the Trouble Chart, page 14.


The Magneto
This is a selTcontained unit and consists, chiefly, of an armature plate
on which are mounted ignition coil, condenser, and breaker points, with a
permanent magnet built into the flywheel.
Its operation is extremely simple. As the pole pieces of the magnet pass
over the heels of the coil a magnetic field is built up about the coil, causing
current to flow through the primary winding.
At the pro-
per time the
breaker points
are opened by
the action of a
"flat" machined
on the crank
shaft, thus
breaking tht
primary circuit
This stops the
flow of primary)
current, causing
the magnetic
field about the
coil to break
down instantly,
thereby indue' J
ing an clectri- [
cal current of ■
high voltage in .
the fine sec-
ondary winding
of the coil. • This high voltage current is carried to the spark plug where it
jumps the gap between the points, to ignite the compressed charge in the
Owing to its rugged construction the magneto may be relied upon to
function efficiently throughout the life of the engine. It needs no lubrication,
and no attention other than an occasional inspection of the breaker points and
spark plug connection.
Care of Ignition System
SPARK PLUG—Remove occasionally for cleaning and adjustment oi
points, the correct gap between which is .020".
Examine insulator of plug for cracks, as hard starting, missing and faulty
running of engine are often caused by a defective insulator.
Be sure insulator is both clean and dry before replacing plug. Wipe off
any traces of moisture with dry cloth.
Test the plug by placing it, with cable attached, on cylinder head of engine,
and turn engine over to observe the spark between points. In a very bright
light the spark may not be visible, but a pronounced “snap” is audible when
sparking takes place.


IMPORTANT. —-When a new plug is required be sure to get one with a
14 mm. thread.
MAGNETO. —In no circumstances tamper with this unless it is evident
that the hard starting and faulty running of engine is due to some irregularity
in the magneto.
Before attempting adjustments, remove cable from spark plug and hold
terminal on cable about from cylinder head, and turn engine over. If
there is no spark between terminal and engine, or only a weak one, the
trouble will most likely result from improperly adjusted, pitted, or corroded
breaker points. In such case it is necessary to remove the flywheel.
Proceed as follows: —Remove shroud covering flywheel, then flywheel
nut and grooved starting pulley. Get someone to grasp the rim of the
flywheel, to absorb shock, then strike end of crankshaft a light blow with a
mallet or piece of wood. One or two blows usually suffice. BE CAREFUL
NOT TO INJURE END OF CRANKSHAFT.
Any risk of injury to the crankshaft can he avoided by using a
simple flywheel puller obtainable at low cost from the factory.
To examine the points, spread them with a blunt instrument. If pitted
or corroded, turn crankshaft until points close, then insert a small, flat file
between them. Draw file gently back and forth to dress down the points.
To check breaker point gap, turn crankshaft slowly until points have
opened wide. Insert feeler gauge between points —correct gap setting is .012".
If necessary to make corrections, loosen breaker plate adjusting screw —
see page 6. Increase the gap by moving breaker assembly towards crankshaft;
reduce it by moving the assembly in opposite direction. NOTE. —Breaker gap
is governed by distance from follower to centre of crankshaft when passing
over flat section.
Tighten breaker plate adjusting screw.
Replace flywheel, pulley and nut, making certain flywheel key is properly
placed in key way. THIS IS IMPORTANT.
Tighten nut with large wrench.
Replace shroud. Attach cable to plug and start engine as directed
Allow to run for 1015 minutes, then stop and re-tighten flywheel nut.
CAUTION. —A loose flywheel will result in the engine knocking, in
irregular running, in flywheel hub cracking, and in possible injury to both
engine and operator.
Removing Carbon and the Care of Valves
After a long period of operation it may be necessary to detach the
cylinder head to remove carbon from the combustion chamber, the head of
the piston and the valves.
Scrape off the carbon with a blunt instrument, taking care not to scratch
the head of piston. After scraping, wash cylinder head, head of piston, valves
and gasket with petrol.


Excess carbon deposit should be removed, also, from the valve seats and
the valves. To do this turn flywheel slowly until one valve has opened; apply
small quantity of kerosene to valve and seat; turn flywheel until valve closes,
making sure valve has seated; turn valve back and forth with valve-grinding
tool to work off carbon from both valve and its seat.
Adopt same procedure with the other valve.
GRINDING VALVES. —If the valves or valve seats are badly pitted,
the valves must be ground in if loss of compression is to be overcome. This
necessitates the removal of the cylinder from the crankcase, as well, of course,
as the head from the cylinder, likewise the taking-off of the flywheel, shroud
and starting pulley as directed on page 7 under “Magneto.”
Remove the nuts from crankcase studs and lift cylinder off. Compress
valve springs to withdraw retainer pins. Remove valves, retainers and springs
Note that exhaust valve is distinguished by marking not found on the inlet
valve, and care must be taken, when replacing valves, to see that each is put
back into its right place.
Scrape excess carbon from heads and stems of valves, and from valve
guides and seats in cylinder block, then wash with petrol.
Next, coat the face of valve with medium-fine valve-grinding compound.
Replace valve in guide and grind in by turning back and forth with
valve-grinding tool, making sure the valve is on its seat. Two minutes of
grinding should be sufficient for each valve.
With petrol, wash off from both valves and seats all traces of the grinding
compound, taking care that none of the compound is washed into the engine
cylinder or the valve guides. Replace valves in their respective guides, as
stated previously.
Now check
tappet clearance.
This is done by
seeing that the
ends of the valve
stems (with the
valves seated)
are flush with
the base of the
cylinder, and
that the tappets
are flush with
the face of the
crankcase as
shown in this
illustration and
that on page 9.
When the gasket
is in position be-
tween crankcase
and cylinder the
necessary tappet clearance (.010" to
.012") is provided.


Should it
be found,
however, that
the valve
stems pro-
trude beyond
the base of
cylinder,
grind the
ends of the
stems care-
fully until
they are flush
with the base.
Make certain
that the end
is ground off
square with
stem. The
tappets are
adjusted flush
with the crankcase, at the factory, and should require no attention other than
an inspection at intervals. Now reassemble valves, springs and retainers in
the order in which they were taken apart. .
Coat both sides of the gasket lightly with grease, place it in position over
the studs in crankcase, and replace cylinder in position, compressing the piston
rings slightly to facilitate piston entering cylinder. Take care not to break,
or even bend, rings. A sprung ring will never seal properly.
Replace nuts on crankcase studs and tighten them evenly—each one a
little at a time. Then replace cylinder head.
Next, replace armature plate, flywheel and shroud as instructed on page 7.
IMPORTANT. —Be sure flywheel nut is tight. Run the engine for from 10 to 15
minutes, then re-tighten nut. .Serious injury to both crankshaft and flywheel will result
if engine be run with flywheel nut loose.
Timing
Ignition. —Since set ignition timing, without either advance or retard, is
provided in the engine, the timing of the ignition is done at the factory and
cannot be altered. The width of the breaker point gap, of course, has some
effect on timing, nevertheless, if the breaker points be adjusted in accordance
with directions given on page 7, the timing will be correct.
Valves.—The valves were pro-
perly timed before the engine left the
factory. However, if the engine has
been taken down and the valves thus
thrown out of timing, proceed as
follows to re'time them: —Note the
punch marks on cam gear and crank'
shaft gear. Put crankshaft in engine
with the punch-marked tooth of the
gear downwards, as shown in the
illustration. Then insert the cam-
shaft in the engine so that the
marked tooth of the crankshaft gear
is between the two marked teeth of
the cam gear.
