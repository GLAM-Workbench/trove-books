Vicar of Calverley, 1823-45.


History of Parsley Parish Church.
ARSLHY CHURCH, dedicated to St. John the Evangelist, was consecrated by the Right Rev. the Lord
j Bishop of Ripon, on Friday, October 27th, 1843. The Church is situated in a very populous
district, where church accommodation was much required. The site, which is at the south part of the
Township of Parsley, on which the Church is erected, was kindly presented by the late Thomas Thornhill, Esq.,
of Fixby Hall, the Lord of the Manor of Calverley, and who, besides giving the whole of the ground on which to
erect the Church, and that which was necessary for the burial ground, generously contributed one hundred guineas
towards the building fund. Through the active exertions of the Rev. Samuel Redhead, the Vicar of Calverley,
several other handsome donations and subscriptions were obtained for the building of the sacred edifice, and the
whole sum, augmented by grants from the Ripon Diocesan Church Building Society, from the Incorporated Society
for the Building and Enlarging of Churches, and from the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, amounted to £1,892. The
erection and fitting up of the Church, we understand, did not much exceed that sum. It is remarkable that so
neat a religious edifice should be erected for so small a sum as this, and the design of the building, and the care
with which every part is finished, do great credit to the professional skill and taste of W. Wallen, Esq., of
17


Huddersfield, the architect, who liberally gave his services gratuitously. The style of the building is Early English,
with a substantial Pinnacled Tower at the west end, and a neat Chancel at the east. The Nave is 66 feet long
and 36 feet broad, and the Chancel is 25 feet long and 21 feet broad. The Windows, twenty in number, are
surrounded with dog’s tooth enrichments, and are in strict unison with the Chancel arch, which is richly moulded
in stone, and with the rest of the edifice. A stone Baptismal Font, richly carved by Alfred Bedford at twelve
years of age, was presented by the Rev. H. J. Bailey, then of Drighlington, which was placed at the west end of
the Church. At the west end is a neatly erected gallery, capable of accommodating 200 persons with comfortable
sitting room. The Burial Ground was afterwards consecrated by the Bishop.
By an Act of Parliament, Parsley is now constituted an independent new parish, and the Church a Parish
Church. The first Vicar to be appointed, was the Rev Irwin Lloyd, M.A., in 1843. His Incumbency was only a
short one lasting three years. The mural tablet to his memory in the Church reads thus: —ln memory of The
Rev. Irwin Lloyd, M.A., The first Incumbent of this Church, and afterwards of Southgate, Middlesex, Who died
April 6th, 1838, Aged 42 years.
In 1846 the Rev. Parsons James Mailing became Vicar of Parsley, and during his long incumbency much
was done for the good of the parish. In 1848 he collected £I,OOO to build a Vicarage, with the result that a very
neat and well-arranged house was erected of the Elizabethan style, and a commodious school for the education of
the youth in connection with the Church of England. The former cost £BB9 3s. Bd., and the latter £630 14s. Bd.
The balance sheet, dated October 1848, for both these buildings, showed a debt of only £B3 17s. sd. on the Schools,
and £SO 7s. Bd. on the Parsonage. The donations and offerings at the opening of the Schools amounted to
£3O 14s. 3d. One item in these balance sheets is noteworthy as evidence of the enormous increase in the value of
land in Parsley in 60 years. The cost of “site and law expenses” of Schools is entered at £ls 13s. 6d. The
“cost of site” of Parsonage £l9. The donation list contains the names of 91 subscribers and it does not appear
that one of them is now living. Amongst them it is interesting to note the following earnest supporters of the Church in
Parsley in days now long past: Messrs. John Hainsworth £2O, William Varley £2O, Thomas Turner £2O,

The following is an extract from the
speech of the Bishop of Ripon (Dr. Longley,
subsequently Archbishop of Canterbury), at the
annual meeting of the Diocesan Society in
1848: “1 can point to one place (Parsley
Parish) where the blessing of a church and
resident pastor was so little appreciated that
no more than £l6 could be raised towards its
erection in a district swarming with a manufacturing population, and the clergy were ill-treated when they proceeded
to lay the first stone of the building. The work, however, was persevered in, the Church consecrated, a diligent
minister appointed, and before long £2OO is raised by these selfsame people towards providing a parsonage for him ;
they contribute largely towards the erection of a National School, and guarantee the payment of any balance
beyond the estimated cost.” Thank God the days of religious intolerance, at least in Parsley, are over, and the
relations between Christians of the various congregations are of the happiest kind and the Church of England able
to pursue its way unmolested.
In 1853 a Tower Clock was erected. A Committee was formed of which the Rev. P. J. Mailing was president.
£2OO was collected, and the work of construction of the clock was intrusted to Mr. Potts, famous for his notable


work and construction of Leeds Town Hall Clock. Mr. Denison, Q.C. (afterwards Lord Grimthorpe), gave his
careful supervision to the work, and the clock has gone very admirably ever since. The four dials were presented
by the late Mr. John Butler, of Stanningley Foundry. They were made at his own works and are much larger than
is usual for their altitude, the diameter being Bft. Sin. and the minute hand exactly 6ft. long. A good tenor bell (G)
strikes the hours
In the years 1853-4, the Rev. P. J. Maning asked and freely obtained the sum of £l6O to give a general
repair to the whole of the Vicarage, both inside, outside, and its boundary walls and gates. It was inspected and
pronounced in good order according to law.
The Church, which had been closed for about five weeks for repairs and painting, and also for the
erection of a memorial to the late Rev. Samuel Marsden, was re-opened on Wednesday, July 10th, 1867, by the
Lord Bishop of Ripon. The event took place under the most favourable and propitious circumstances. There was
a numerous attendance of the clergy and gentry of the neighbourhood.
In the year 1875, a great deal of invaluable work was accomplished in the Church by a Committee
composed of the following gentlemen:—Mr. Slater (Chairman), Ashville, Parsley, who subscribed £100; Mr. Lambert
(Treasurer), St. John’s Villa, Parsley, £5O; Mr. Hawkeswell (Churchwarden), Woodslands, Parsley, £100; Mr. Butler,
West Royd, Parsley, £100; Mr. Elsworth, Sunfield, Stanningley, £2O; The Vicar, the Rev. Parsons J. Maning, was the
Vice-Chairman ; and Mr. Samuel Hainsworth and Mr. Samuel Butler acted as Secretaries. These gentlemen raised
about £l,OOO, to which they were, with a Committee of ladies, the chief contributors. They caused the whole of
the floor of the Church to be re-laid, and a most complete seating of oak neatly and substantially executed, with
new pulpit, prayer desk and chancel stalls, in carved oak; also a very fine organ, built by Mr. Abbott, of Leeds;
also a warming apparatus, and the whole Church was thoroughly ventilated; the erection of an organ chapel
on the north west of the chancel, a complete set of new gaslights, besides the decorating and painting of the
Church. The roof of the nave was covered or lined with pine and varnished, the vestry floor re-laid and a new


entrance screen and doors at the west end. Choir seats close to the organ, in neat carved oak, were also erected,
with a general searching repair of all the Church and its boundary walls, doors and gates.
In 1891, Mr. Mailing resigned the living of Parsley, owing to increasing years and infirmity after a
vicariate of 45 years, during which time he endeared himself to many hearts. His memory is lovingly cherished by
many of his old parishioners who remember his earnest and devoted pastoral work. He died in 1900, full of years
and honours. A fine portrait of Mr. Mailing, recently given by Mrs. Varley Roberts, hangs in the vestry.
Mr. Maning was followed by the Rev. Dr. Edwin King, during whose vicariate many important improvements
w6lO effected in the Church. In 1893, when the Jubilee was celebrated, the chancel arch was enlarged and a
spacious organ chamber erected with two arches north of the chancel, a screen wall, and other various
improvements at a cost of close on £l,OOO. In 1895, the tower, which had shewn indications of insecurity, was taken
down together with the west bay of the nave, and rebuilt on a substantial concrete foundation laid at a much
lower level. In 1898, the south porch was added to the tower, and interior improvements include the oak reredos
m triptych form, the installation of a new heating apparatus and improved ventilation. Not the least effective
improvement has been the substitution of paint for colour wash which had previously decorated the walls. This
extensive catalogue of improvements was concluded by the painting and gilding of the tower clock.

behind the communion table is naturally of the most importance, and so stands slightly in front of and rises higher than
the wings. It is divided into three compartments, the centre being occupied by the picture surrounded by an
elaborately moulded frame studded with carved patera?. Above the picture the work projects in a cove of four
bays, carrying pendant tracery pierced and carved. Above this is an embattled and moulded cornice, finished with
a richly carved cresting, the bays being marked by crocketted pinnacles. The centre part is carried well above the
rest and terminates in a richly carved floral cross. The enclosing leaves of the picture are panelled and carved on
both sides with two heights of elaborate tracery, and the panels are enriched with shields bearing alternately the
emblematical devices I.H.S. and the crown of thorns. The wings and the frame of the picture are richly gilded
and painted in red and green, the colours that formed the favourite decoration in old work.
The sides of the reredos or wall panelling, as they may be called, are also of oak treated in a more
simple manner, each side being divided into three bays of two compartments filled with linen pattern panels, and
the whole finished with a well moulded cornice at the height of the east window sill. The work has been
creditably executed by Mr. J. Taylor, of Yeadon, and the decoration by Messrs. Powell Bros., of Leeds, the whole
being from designs by Messrs. F. H. and F. Healey, Architects, of Bradford.
Ihe picture in the centre was copied by Van Lil from “The Descent from the Cross” in Antwerp
Cathedral, painted by Rubens, and generally considered this great artist’s masterpiece. It is one quarter the size
of the original.

The Pulpit.
THE Pulpit was erected by Miss Maning, of
Shrewsbury, in memory of her father, the late
Vicar. It is of carved oak, slightly fumed and
polished. In style it harmonizes with the Church, being
early English. Each of the principal angles contains a
pedestal with moulded base and carved capital, carrying
a sculptured figure standing beneath a trefoil-headed
niche. The figures selected are Moses, Isaiah, St. John,
and St. Peter, the most prominent being St. John the
Evangelist, the patron Saint of the Church. The pulpit
is crowned with a moulded cornice richly carved. Along
the base runs the following inscription :
“Co the Glory? of (3o£> anb in memory? of
Iparsom? James /Iftamno. ihcar 1845=1891.”
The pulpit was designed by Messrs. Healey, of
Bradford. The statuettes were executed by Messrs.
Rattee & Rett, of Cambridge, and the carving of the general structure was done by Mr. Clayton, of Leeds, for Messrs
Thomas Taylor & Sons, Contractors, Salem Street, Bradford.
The pulpit was dedicated Sunday, November 11th, 1900.


Rev. Samuel Marsden,
Rev. Samuel Marsden.
Aged 70.


A short Biographical Sketch of Samuel Marsden.
Jf/ r x H E particulars of the life of this interesting, enterprising and sterling Christian are well known,
j i -'./j and his special claim on the gratitude of the inhabitants of this country consists in his
having been the first to introduce the Australian wool into England. The late Mr. Marsden was
born at Parsley, near Leeds, July 28th, 1764, and was educated at Hull Grammar School, which he left in
1789. He then proceeded to Cambridge, and left Magdalen College in 1792. He was ordained by royal mandate
on January Ist, 1793, and appointed by special commission Chaplain to the New Settlement at Sydney, Australia,
1793. In 1794 he arrived at Botany Bay, and was appointed a magistrate in 1796. The next fourteen years of
his life were spent in constant toil in the performance of his duties as a Chaplain. He laboured assiduously in
the erection of Churches and Schools, and was particularly
for the rearing of sheep. He sailed for England with the
and Leeds in 1808. The circumstance was brought under
(Lord Castlereagh), with Sir Joseph Banks, introduced the
ordered a suit of clothes to be made from the first cloth
active in establishing “ The Model Farm ” of Sydney,
first wool in barrels, and arrived with it at London
the notice of the Government, and the Prime Minister
Rev. S. Marsden to King George 111. His Majesty
manufactured out of Australian wool in 1809. His
29


Majesty next presented Mr. Marsden with five sheep
(rams), Merino breed, for “The Model Farm ” at Sydney.
Mr. Marsden arrived safely with them in Australia in 1810,
and the wool trade of Sydney dates from the year 1811.
Mr. Marsden, still intent upon the duties of his office as
a minister of Christ, fitted out an expedition to New
Zealand to Christianise and civilise the cannibal tribes
of the Northern Island, and took with him cattle, horses,
sheep, &c. He was the first missionary from whose
lips the natives of New Zealand ever heard the sound
of the Gospel. He was the first white man that
succeeded in teaching them religion, agriculture and arts.
The place where Samuel Marsden deposited the first wool which he brought
from Australia.
The spot in Turner’s Fold where Samuel Marsden was born.
He preached the first sermon ever heard in New
Zealand to crowds of savages on Christmas Day, 1814,
from the text Luke ii., 10-11 : “Behold I bring you glad
tidings of great joy.” For twenty-three years he had
the supervision of the missionary operations in New
Zealand, tending and pastoring the Churches he had
been instrumental in founding. He made seven voyages
to and expeditions through those extensive Islands, and
wherever he went he taught religion, and instructed the
natives in agriculture and the mode of rearing sheep.
He also concerned himself diligently in building Churches
and Schools for the education of the people, until at
last civilization took deep root in the country.


Site of the First Christian Service held in New
Zealand, and where the Rev Samuel Marsden
preached his first Sermon December 25th, JBI4.
This remarkable man closed his laborious life at Sydney, May 12th, 1838,
aged 74 years. He was buried in his own churchyard at Parramatta, his
remains being followed to the grave b\ r over sixty carriages, and representatives
of all classes of the community were there to nav their last resoects. Somp id^n
community were there to pay their last respects. Some idea
may he formed of the extent to which he was admired and beloved in those
far-distant regions
the earth from the fact that, when he died, by a
gratitude, the people raised to his memory a memorial
spontaneous impulse
which cost £6,000.
Since iMarsden was born at Parsley, it should never be forgotten that
he has been compared to Augustine, the Apostle of our own England;
indeed it has been said that “ Marsden played Gregory’s part, as well as
Augustine’s. Like Gregory, he happened as it were by chance upon some
remarkable-looking heathens in a city remote from their native land, was
struck by their apparent superiority to other barbarous races, and never rested
until he had succeeded in inciting others to preach the Gospel to the people of
the land whence they came; like Augustine, braving both ‘perils in the sea’ and ‘perils by the heathen,’
he went and evangelised them himself.”
In November, 1866, a number of gentlemen formed themselves into a Committee for the purpose of
obtaining subscriptions towards some recognition of the eminent services Samuel Marsden had rendered, with the
result that stained-glass windows were placed in the Chancel of Parsley Parish Church, and a monument by the
front gate in the Churchyard erected to his memory. It is hoped, however, in the near future, that something
more imposing may be erected to his exalted piety, sterling character, simplicity, unselfishness, high purposes and
noble enterprises. We are sadly in need of a building suitable for our Sunday School and parochial meetings, &c.
Would it not be possible to erect a building and call it “The Marsden Memorial Hall?” We have every reason
to be proud of this great man in Parsley, and seek to emulate his noble character.

Hymn.
O Lord of heaven and earth and sea,
To Thee all praise and glory be;
How shall we show our love to Thee
Giver of all ?
The golden sunshine, vernal air,
Sweet flowers and fruits Thy love declare ;
Where harvests ripen, Thou art there,
Giver of all.
For peaceful homes and healthful days,
For all the blessings earth displays,
We owe Thee thankfulness and praise,
Giver of all.
Thou didst not spare Thine only Son,
But gav’st Him for a world undone,
And free y with taat Blessed One,
Thou givest all.
W T e lose what on ourselves we spend,
We have as treasure without end
Whatever, Lord, to Thee we lend,
Who givest all.
Whatever Lord we lend to Thee
Kepaid a thousandfold will be,
Then gladly will we give to Thee,
Giver of all;
To Thee, from whom we all derive
Our life, our gifts, our power to give.
O may we ever with Thee live,
Giver of all! Amen

OGOD, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our sbeltei from the stormy blast
And our eternal home :
Beneath the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure ;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone ;
And our defence is sure.
Before the hills in order stood.
Or earth received her Irame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.
A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone;
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the lising sun.
Time, like an ever rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away ;
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.
O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come ;
Be Thou our guard while life shall last,
And our eternal home. Amen.

The wise may bring their learning,
The rich may bring their wealth ;
And some may bring their greatness
And some bring strength and health
We too would bring our treasures
To offer to the King.
We have no wealth or learning,
What shall we children bring ?
We ll bring Him hearts that love Him,
We’ll bring Him thankful praise,
And young hearts meekly striving
To walk in holy ways.
And these shall be the treasures
We offer to the King,
And these are gifts that even
The poorest child may bring.
We’ll bring the little duties, /
We have to do each day, A
We’ll try our best to please Him /1
At home, at school, at play. I 1
