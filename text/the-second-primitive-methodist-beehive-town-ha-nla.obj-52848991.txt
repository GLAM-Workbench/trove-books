WHY THE BEEHIVE ?
four years ago a Mission was started by the PRIMITIVE METHODIST CHURCH at Sandy'Bay,
the Services being held in a private room.
A few of the friends, encouraged by the success which attended these Meetings, decided to form a Sabbath
School, and we have great reason for thankfulness for the good that is being- done there.
The cause having grown considerably, the room was found too small, and measures w-ere taken to provide
more commodious premises. Accordingly a Trust was appointed, and the members of this body, having secured
a suitable piece of land in a central position at Sandy Bay, erected a Building in which to preach the Gospel and
conduct a Sabbath School at a cost, including the ground, of about £(>oo.
On September 26th, the first “ Beehive ” was opened, the proceeds of which, after all expenses were
paid, totalled the handsome sum of £ll5. Donations of cash have also been received and entertainments held
periodically, until at present the debt has been reduced to £3OO
To enable the Trustees to cope with this amount, the idea of holding a second “ Beehive” was mooted, and
the ladies of Sandy Bay at once entered into the work heartily under the able leadership of Rev. Mrs. Dawe. It
is anticipated that at h ast will be raised by this effort.
We have had very pleasing evidence that our work commends itself to the generous sympathy of many
outside our own Church, donations having been received from all parts of the Colony.
We offer to all our grateful thanks.

"Gloria in Excelsis.”
Primitive Methodism in Tasmania.
On November ist, 1857, in a little room on the Windmill Hill, Launceston, six persons
gathered and formed the first Class Meeting of the Primitive Methodist Connexion ever held in
Tasmania. About seven weeks later a Tea Meeting was held (quite characteristic of Primitive
Methodists), and the money raised thereat, together with a few donations, totalling in all about
£6O, was sufficient to send for a Minister from England.
The Rev. f. Langham was appointed by the Conference, and commenced his labours in
the Launceston Circuit at the beginning of the year 1858.
Young Town, a little hamlet three miles from Launceston, was formed as a branch of this
Circuit in the same year, and in the year following a Church was built there, costing about £3OO,
which stands to this day, being generally known as the “ Grandmother.”
In November, iB6O, Rev. E. C. Pritchard arrived in Hobart, and formed a Society there,
starting with ten members, some of whom are still living. The Opening Service was conducted
by this worthy servant of God, assisted by the Rev. J. Langham, in the Domain, and the
influence of that open-air meeting lives to this day.
A small building in Argyle Street was rented, in which the Gospel was preached for nine
months, when the present Church was purchased.
Other Parts of Tasmania have been missioned, and now Ministers are stationed at Laun-
ceston, Hobart, Sandy Bay, Beaconsfield, Penguin, Burnie, Longford, and Zeehan; each of
which has its Branches and a large number of adherents.
“ The best of all, God is leith us.”
